Thursday January 1, 1829. I wish you"Happy New Year" is sounding upon our ears for the morning salutation. There is some indication of a snowstorm in the weather this morning. Business not very brisk. It began to snow this afternoon about 4 o'clock and I think from the appearance of the weather we shall have some sleighing. I think of going home Saturday morning. 
Chichester Friday January 2, 1829. There came about 3 in. of snow last night and it snows yet. Father came over today and I expect to ride home with him. We started at about 6 o'clock in our open waggon, it snows considerably. Arrived at home at about 9 o'clock, folks all well, had supper and went to bed at 11. Sleighs do[d]ging about briskly. 
Saturday January 3, 1829. 1 arose this morning about 10 o'clock. It's very cold today, perhaps colder than we have [had] for the year before.

There is considerable talk about the balls, celebrations &c. on the "Glorious 8th." There will be an ox roasted whole at Goffstown, and in this town there will be a ball at the Eagle Coffee House and a dinner at the Washington Hotel by Mr. Smart, and there will [be] other preparations in many different towns, all prepared by the Jacksonites. We go to bed at lb and arise at 7 o'clock. Old Col. Kent and his wife and the Tucker girls are going to Boston tomorrow. 
Thursday January 8, 1829. 1 awoke this morning and the first [sound?] that assailed my ears was the Jackson swivel, which sounded very dull. I have heard firing almost all day from almost all directions. At 12 o'clock the swivel was hauled out again and fired. The dinner at Mr. Smart's was very thinly attended, I heard tonight. Snow began to fall this forenoon but long towards night it turned to rain. I should think there had fell 4 in. There is a great driving about of chaises, carriages and sleighs to carry the folks to the balls this evening. I heard this morning that the ox at Goffstown caught afire yesterday and burnt up owing to the fat. The ox cost them SOdoll[ar]s and they had to get another one.

My boots that I had footed pinch my toes considerable so that they do not feel very comfortable. 
Been filing up papers a part of today. 
I was thinking today that a very important part of the business of a merchant is in answering all letters as soon as received and not lay them aside and by that means forget them untill a month after.wards and then place all the blame upon the clerk by saying that he layed aside among some papers when he was gone and smooth it over in that way by a miserable excuse. The fruits of such delays are often severely felt.

Hanaford has gone to muster and all are in a breese [breeze] about it here. I shall not go. I had a letter from home yesterday. The folks are all well and my cloak is done &c. Sit up late. 
Thursday September 24, 1829. Sat up late last night til 12 o'clock. George arose about 3 this morning and went to muster in a waggon which Esqr. Magoon fitted to carry a number. I arose between 6 and 
7. Almost 1/2 the school have gone to muster or somewhere else. It is one of the finest days that I know of in the country. I studied all day. Jewett had the headache badly today. George arrived from muster about 8 o'clock this evening, tired and dissatisfied with it. He said he saw a number of Concord folks there. There has been a number of very heavy frosts along back.

Worth took lead in speaking. There was a lecture at the Village at 7 o'clock. 
Thine earthly Sabbath, Lord, we love, But there's a nobler rest above; To that our longing souls aspire, With ardent pangs of strong desire. 
No more fatigue, no more distress, No sin nor hell shall reach the place; No groans to mingle with the songs Which warble from Immortal tongues 
No rude alarm of raging foes; No cares to break the long repose; No midnight shade, no clouded sun, Obscures the lustre of thy throne. 
Around thy throne grant we may meet, 
And give us but the lowest seat; 
We shout thy praise and join the song 
Of the triumphant, holy throng.

Went over to Capt. Norris' tonight to husking. There was a number there and we had a good supper but I did not eat any. I got home about 9. I have looked my lesson over once. 
Thursday October 1, 1829. Another month has past never to be recalled. And it ought to be mine as well as every one's duty to look back on the past month and see if we can in any way perceive how we have improved it better than its successors [ predecessors]. If in Iooklng back we perceive no improvement in our studies and if we cannot see that we are better prepared to meet our end with resig.nation it ought to be the duty of every one immediately to attend to these concerns. 
Who can recall past months and years? No one, I answer. Ohl that I might realize the instability of human life. 
Weather very cold and windy for the time of year. I went over to Collin's room this afternoon to study. We have to get for a lesson more than 2 pages, which is more than we have got before. I was appointed on a written debate this morning by the Profs.

We did not have a Bible Class lesson assigned today for tomorrow. 
Sunday October 11, 1829. It was very foggy this forenoon and rainy in the latter part ofthe day. We went to meeting at the usual time and found that the folks had assembled in the Chapel but on account of the number they soon went to the Meeting House. It has been used by the men to fix their clapboards in to cover the house, which makes it very dirty. Mr. Evans preached with his usual good spirit for the welfare of us unworthy sinners. There was a considerable number present considering the weather. George attended the Berean Soc., which commences at 9 o'clock and continues till meeting time. At noon we had a very interesting prayer meeting instead of a Bible Class because no lesson was given out. It was held at the Meeting House. I have not got any lesso11-for tomorrow because I went a gunning yesterday. 
Never did I see Christians more anxious or make greater exertions for the salvation of lost and perishing souls than they do here. It appears to be their cheif object at all times whether in meeting or out, whether on Sunday or week days, to awaken sinners to a scence [sense] of their condition and to excite their brethren to greater exertions in the same Glorious Cause! I hope their exertions may not prove fruitless and void but that they may have the comforting thought to cheer them at all times that they have done their duty both to their Maker and to their fellow Beings around them. 
This will bear them up against all evils and be a consolation in 
time of adversity. They will have a mind con[s]cious of rectitude  and  
a soul that knows no guile.  
What  an  enlivening  thought  they  must  have  that  they  are  
treading  the footsteps  of their  Messiah. Christ  is evangelizing  the  
world.  
The Sabbath! What a blessed day!  
A season which the Lord has made  
For Christians to go up and pray  
In houses which the Lord has laid.  

82. 
It rains considerable to night. George has gone to the village with Mr. Cram to help take lead of a meeting there. Jewett and I went up to the prayer meeting at the Academy.

Monday October, 12, 1829. Weather quite pleasant today. I did not go up to school this morning because I had not my lesson. We got through the first course of the Greek Reader which is a very short time to go through. We go about 3 1/2 pages next lesson. I received my things from home which I have been expecting. They sent me my portable desk which I like very well, except the lock.

At noon we had an interesting Bible Class from the 16 and 1 7 Chapters of Luke. Prof., instead of asking the students questions, let the students ask him. Went to a good prayer meeting in the evening. Four young converts arose and addressed the meeting solemnly. 
There are many in this place who are under conviction. I never saw a meeting so well attended and such a general seeking after the one thing needful. There is an inquiry and prayer meeting appointed at Dea[con] Gordons tomorrow evening. 
Monday October 19, 1829. Weather quite pleasant although some windy and chilly. Rescited as usual but did not have my lesson very well. Sold my fowling piece to Theodore Davie for a lot of books, a gold ring and $1.00 in money. I called the gun worth 7 dollars. I dont know as Father will like my selling it very well. I have been thinking for a number of days back about my course of life that I have been living, which is in total enmity against God and my mind has been very deeply impressed with my state as a sinner. We went to meeting at Dea[con] Gordons which was a very interesting one to me. There was an inquiry meeting in our room.I went into it. There was about a doz[en] in the whole. We had a very solemn meeting. Mr.Farnsworth and Evans was with us and talked with us separately.

I did not go up to the Academy this morning because I had not my lesson and I dont feel capable of studying in such a state of mind as I now am in. I have been very much troubled today in my mind on account of my condition. I cannot see my sins. This is my greatest source of regret and sometimes I think my convictions will wear away and this again fills me with sorrow. But I hope I shall be made to see my sinfulness. O! Lord do give me instruction from above. Started for the village to meeting about dusk. We had a very good meeting. Most all females attended. The room was crowded at the inquiry meeting. There were 6 who were inquired of. Miss Hadley, one of the instructresses, a Miss Hardy, Miss Perkins (Sophia), Mr. Philbrick and another young man and myself. I was some cold going and coming. 
Wednesday October 21, 1829. Weather very cold and windy for the time of year. Arose this morning about 6 o'clock. I feel about the same as ever. I feel that I am sinning against God with every thought. 
I spent this forenoon in prayer and reading. Dant feel any relieved from the burden that rests upon me. The most that I fear is that my convictions will wear away, and leave me in a worse state than before. But I hope, not. 
Thursday October 22, 1829. I feel about the same as ever and as anxious as ever, I think. I went over to the "Mansion House" with George and talked upon religion with Mr. Braybrook and Hutchinson.

Kent, George Kent, Col. Ambrose, Jacob Perkins, Mr. Tenney and Mr. Hopkinton. This was rather unwelcome news to me but there is no help for it now it is done. She wrote likewise that Father thought he could pay all if no more cost was made on it.

The Chapel caught on fire this morning by the stovepipe, which came apart where it went through the chamber floor and there caught. It was soon stopped. 
I was very cold when resciting this morning because the pipe was taken down to be fixed and we had no fire. Charles Eastman, a young fellow with whom I was acquainted at Pembroke, entered school this morning. Mr. Taylor at the village is his uncle and he boards there. I shall have to sit up late to get my lesson in Greek. I enjoy my mind very well now at times. But some times I am sorely 
tempted  and my mind  is filled with evil thoughts  which  by the help  
of God I hope  to [drive?] far away from  me.

The new building is shingled. Mr. Farnsworth will move into his new house next month.

It is in History and Biography. I went up to the R. E.'s this afternoon. One 1/2 of the students spoke, the other wrote a debate (one half of the Alphabet, I mean). It was my turn to write a debate but I did not and so I was excused. The Ex[ercises] were not very good. In the evening I went to the Singing School at the Chapel which has just began. There were about 15 there.

We have from 15 to 20 boarders here now. Mr. Ingalls has about 65 scholars in his school at the village which began Monday.

I went to meeting tonight and there were about 15 to 20 present and all had experienced religion except 2 boys who were [?]. We had a very good meeting. I spoke a few [words] and I think it relieved my mind considerably. I think it is the duty of everyone who has entertained a hope that they have been born again to endeavor to advance the cause of the Glorious Redeemer by speaking of his goodness to us un.worthy creatures and of warning sinners to turn from the error of their ways. 
And I feel that if I was able to speak better in his cause that it would be a great pleasure to me.

part of my debate this afternoon and a letter home. I wrote in it something concerning baptism &c. Mr. A. Rand wanted me to go over to Kelly's Pond with him to help take care of the boys a skating and I went, had quite a skate. I was so unused to it that it made me very stiff. The pond is frozen very hard.

I sat in the singing seats in the afternoon. The Meeting House was quite full. There was a church [meeting] at noon at Mr. Evans house. At noon I went down to Mr. Ingalls, boarding with Mr. Farnum. Last evening I went down to the village to Mr. Ingall's singing school. It was the last evening and there were quite a number of spectators in. I played on my flute.

Wednesday December 30, 1829. Weather quite pleasant. I have my debate done. The question is, "Is it just to use death as a mode of punishment for any crime?" The "R. Ex's" were very good. Mr. Farns.worth went away about 3 to go over to Mr; Casswells ordination at at Meridith tomorrow. Mr. Braybrook and I sit up tonight at Mr. _ Websters. An foolish woman died there this morning, aged 52. We were very sleepy. We went home in the morning about 5 and went to bed and slept till 9 o'clock. I went to the singing school this evening. There were not many there on account of the ordination tomorrow. Two or 3 new famil[ies] attended. We got along very well. There will be no school for 2 days now because tomorrow will be the ordination and a funeral here and Friday will be New Years Day. 
Thursday December 31, 1829. Weather some windy yet not very cold. I dont feel the effects of sitting up much today. Mr. Braybrook and I went up to Mrs. Perkins to see her and the boarders there who are Misses Hazeltine, Hall, Harris, Abbot. We had a very happy time in talking on religion. We staid about 2 hours. We then came home and studyed some. Most all the folks here have gone to the ordina.tion. Mr. Braybrook and I went over to Mr. Kelleys district this evening to attend a meeting. There is quite a revival there, it is about 2 miles below the village on√° the left-hand Bristol road. There have been 7 born again there, I believe, 3 in one meeting. We expect to go again next Tuesday night if we can. I had 2 papers from home the other day. 
With this close of this day closes the year 1829 and with its termination, 0 that all my sins and sinful thoughts might close with it. This year I consider as a glorious year to me, as I trust, and to many, I hope. In this year I was careless, anxious and rejoicing. This has been a year of Jubilee to me, as I hope, and this a year when began to live to Christ. What reason have I to thank God for his goodness towards me in preserving me and keeping me to this year when, as I trust, I have found "peace in believing"? A few months ago and I was as careless and secure as anyone, but now can I rejoice 
98 
in the Lord that I ever saw this year. This is a year when I hope shall die to all that is evil and live to all that is good. It is important that we should now look over our books and accounts with the year 1829, see how we stand and see how we have spent our time because He is soon to bear an account of all our doings to heaven where they will be all registered and to be answered for when time shall be no longer. Millions during the last year have gone to their long home where they will have one eternal year either of happiness or of misery. And O Lord I thank thee that thou hast spared me to the present time and not cut me down as a cumberer of the ground. But the time draws near when I must lend the parting hand to 1829. The time has come. Farewell, my dying friend 1829, and welcome 1830!!
