# Pearson diary

Jonathan Pearson (1813-1887) was a Union College graduate, instructor, and administrator. After graduating in 1835, he returned to the College to teach chemistry, natural history, and botany. He served as the college's librarian for more than 40 years and as the school treasurer from 1854 to 1883.

Pearson began keeping a diary as a teenager in 1828. His accounts span forty-seven years and amount to 2,500 pages in length. Pearsonâ€™s son, John Magoun Pearson, donated the first ten volumes of the diary to Schaffer Library in 1934. Five additional volumes were donated by Jonathan Pearson III in 1953. 

The fifteen-volume diary is housed in Union's [Special Collections and Archives.](https://www.union.edu/special-collections)
