. ·' Student Aid . . . . ' . by ROSLYN STONE The Student Aid Office announced this week that the applications for all forms of financial aid avaHable to Union students are now available. The applications must be obtained from the Student Aid Office in Old Gym Hall. The Office of Education will process the BEOG applications and send .3 copies of the Student Eligibility Report (SER) to each student applying. All 3 copies must be presented to the Office of Student Aid, Joseph Maras will then determine the exact amount of the award and this amount will be cr~d to the student's account in 3 equal portions (one each term}. 11 Volume 107,. No. 10 January 11, 1978 Joseph T. Maras, the Director of Student Aid, wishes to impress upon all students receiving aid that new applications for aH forms of aid must be turned in every year. This is now a new year so that all forms must be submitted for processing by their respective deadlines. It is very important that all forms be picked up in Old Gym Hall as soon as possible, as the deadlines are all around March l, 1978. New Union Varsity Team Photo by Jeff Wilklow This year -the Student Aid Office is requiring an additional form from all students applying for aid for the 1·978-79 academic year. The form, commonly called the Financial Aid Form (FAF), is. a standard form similar to the Parents' Confidential Statement (PCS). The FAF is being required in addition to the PCS, not in place of it. The F AF is filed with the College Scholarship twice, as is the PCS. The major advantage of the use of the F AF is that is an application for the BEOG (Basic Educational Opportunity Grant) as well as verification of the information supplied by the PCS form. The F AF must be filed hY March l, 1978. The fee for FAf processiJ,lg is $4.50. Union Hockey Lives On by ANDY ALTMAN and ED PAIKOFF For the first time since a December 21st romping of McMaster, Union College put a varsity hockey team on the ice to face an opponent. In terms of the number of goals scored, the final outcome of the game played on Sunday the 7th with Queens College of Canada did not exactly come out in Union's favor. But a courageous showing by Union's team of junior varsity and \walk- on\ players, complemented by the ardent supp~rt\ of the Union (()lJe~s .~~ptn1U:nit~ which cheered incessantly from the time the ffist Union p1~Jyer s}Cated on to the ice, gave good reason to believe that hockey is still alive at Union. F,ellowing Sunday's showing against Queens College, many otllers were skeptical about the future of varsity hockey at Union. The players and coach put that worry to rest Monday afternoon when they voted unanimously to continue playing as many varsity games as there are teams with whom they can be competitive. It was decided to drop all scheduled games against Division I schools which include Northeastern, St. LawrenCe and Ohio State. Canadian schools such as Western Ontario, · McGill and L~~r:n~ian )~9r~ . . al.~o.. ~r9.PJ.?i;~ . fr()Ili . the ~scliedule:\ ~ttflefk Oirectot Sakala noted that. \the program direction is n~w 'kn~w'n, and the team is ·comfortable. with the schedule as it stands for the rest of the season.\ After deciding which schools Viere out of our class, at least for this year, seven varsity games remained on the schedule. This schedule will be supplemented Viith a number of junior varsity ~ames and possibly with other Division 2 and Division 3 schools which Sakala hopes to work out arrangements with. Some of the more challenging games slated for play are two with Union's old rival, Bt.Jffalo State, and a single llame with Division 2 P,owerhouse, Merrimac~, on the ~6ppont!nr8 · horlie · ice. . While Sakala .and othe.r c;ollege offici,flls are hoping that support for.the newly formed b,ockey team This form tfrocessoo\\'by the College Scholarship Service and·a • Financial Need Analysis RepQrt (FNAR) win be sent to the College. A \Master Application\ will be sent to the student. This new form is the first major step by the financial aid community and the federal government to simplify and New Resignations consoli4ate applications for financial aid. The form hopefully will decrease the amount of paper work required from students appiying for aid. The Office of Student Aid also · reports that Congress has passed legislation which will increase the maximum award of BEOG. ihe maximum award will be increased to $1 ,6CJO when Congress appropriates the funds necessary. All indications are that the monies will most definitely be appropriated. This is clearly a break for the students in need of financial aid. by DAN ROSENBAUM AND),' ALTMAN AND . _LINDSAY TAN . Cl~ining that .. student affairs administrators... are not utilized, consulted, or respected\ at U nion 1 Suzanne Dowling, Director of Housing for the College, has resigned, effective this Friday, January 13. ln a sharply worded letter to Concordiensis, (see p. 2), Ms. Dowling characterized members of the current administration as \opportunistic\ and as .. people with little or no credibility, experience, or principles.\ Further, she accused them of creating an atmosphere of a \battle in which \human beings are being treated as pawns.\ Dowling's move cornes three months after the departure of her superior officer, former Dean of Students Mark Smith. While Ms. Dowling's resignation apparently was not prompted by Smith's termination, it seems cleat the same issues which led Smith to blast Union's upper administra- tion led to Dowling's decision to leave. Although Ms. Dowling's resignation becomes effective on Friday, she stated that she may stay on for a few weeks, unless doing so would interfere with her accepting another position. In any event, she said that s_he would not stay \much after January.\ No successor has been named as of yet. Ms. Dowling, a 1975 graduate of the University of New Hamp .. silire, has been Director of Housing since the academic year 1976-77; succeeding Deborah K.ilgus. Dowling's tenure had been marred by student protests over certain proposed and implemented policies. Miller Alter live years at U naon College as Director of the Office of Career Resources and Placement and Assistant Dean of Students, Susanna M. Miller submitted her resignation on Mon. Jan 9th to be effective April 21, 1978. In this capacity she has served as a career counselor to . · •'Students. and · alumni , and·. has·. attempted to increase their awareness of the job opportunities available to them. Mrs. Miller described the programs of her office as vital, trying to build a program to teach people how to grow and what to do Viith one's self while in college and after graduation. This process, she says, has to be learned and does not happen by magic in the senior year. In addition to her usual duties, Mrs. Miller chaired a Parent's Weekend, coached the first women's lacrosse team and served as a member of the task force that studied and reorganized the entire student work program including the Grant-in-Aid program. She has also been actively involved· with women\s affairs on campus. Looking bac_k at her years at Union, Mrs. Miller described them as being \demanding fun, challenging, and rewarding.\ At this point, however, because of the .. dramatic administrative changes\ and \the drastic changes in atmosphere\ she has lost much of the satisfaction she formerly derived from her job. Holding the position of a middle-level administrator (as Asst. Dean of Students are classified), Ms. Miller experienced a sense of isolation. This feeling grew over the past year as she said that she had not been given the opportunity to contribute and participate in decision making as she had done previously. The situation has continued to d ~line wifh the appointment of a..:udy Nydeggar as Acting Dean of Students according to Ms. Miller, · .coatlhued on Paae 10 will continue, it is uncertain how many season ticket holders will want their money back. Through the Queens game, approximately 15% of the total season ticket holders asked for and received reimbursements. It is probable that many members of Sunday's crowd who held season tickets but were a little less than enthusiastic about the team Union has fielded for what appears to be the remainder of the season, will also demand refunds. The fact of the matter remains: Union's hockey team and fans are anxious to continue the season, and have no intention of letting up now. . - -~ ~ - A listing of the schedule known to date may be found below: Jan.

.. ;. I ': ·! ·:: . I •I, .. : .. _;' . ., ·' .P6ge 2 ·:EDITORIALS··-_,· ACha...-.Seene umon College has unquestionably changed its complexion, visibility and attitude during the past month. Many students, upon returning to the campus, were stunned by the resignations of the Varsity Hockey Coach, Ned Harkness, and the Assistant Coach, .Andy Rickard. The shock was deepened by the unanimous decision of the varsity team to terminate their careers as the Union College Skating Dutchmen. While these issues were ringing through the rested minds of the students returning from vacation, many aspects of the issue remained unclear since the events had occured while aU were absent from the college. Much of the information which many individuals were forced to utilize had been delivered to them 5t1cond hand by the Schenectady, Albany and New York City Press and Media. The most disturbing feat·ure of the dilemma was the distinct bias of the local media .towards the rights, hopes and expectation~ of the local community and not the well-being and health of Union College. WGY and WRGB were among the most serious offenders, both claiming that the area had been cheated to its right of a developing rivalry bct~een Union and the Engineers in Troy, and also deprived of a truly competitive college sports program. However, the good of the school, the depth of the dilemma at Union, and the complete picture involving the President, the Board of Trustees, the Admissions policies, and the campus atmosphere were never completely explor~d or revealed. Rip Rowen of Wl EN, stated as did many others, that Union's academic spheres ~ould not accept the succ<.:~~ wh1ch the Hocke} program enjoyed. Many also attacked Linion's high academtc standards and the contention Y+as made that other reputable schools had maintained a ~trong ~ports program while not sacrificing their academic reputation. ~o mention was made of the special con~ideration; granted to those stuJent> in ,u.;h r<.:putahlc schools ~uch as remedial courses and \minimum grade~.\ Concordiensis feels that these outside forces were unjustified in their editorializing .concerning union's ~porb program. Although sports reporting aUows for the greatest amount of \mixed\ journalism, the area reporters should have sought out d more ~ompn:hen~i.-~ and complete picture on such a. political . and controver~1al ,ubject. Furthermore, Loncordicn~l~ tceb that n 1~ not Within their authority to wntend that they know how to mstruct Lnion or solve its problems for it appear~ that they do not and cannot begin to understand the complex..itie!>. fhe academic standards of Union are its own internal business, and to think that local tele\ision and radio could imply that Union's standards are too high is as ludicrous as Concordiensis questioning the above mentioned group's electronic specification~ for broadcast. During the incidieni it took the local media at least three days to begin .to repon upon the views of tho~e who were opposed to the program and in favor of maintaining the academic integrity of the institution; a period which allowed most of the local community to become :polarized against the school. After the resignations, but before President .Bonner's public st~tement concerning the issue - \\.hich Concordiensi:. feels was delayed too long (a period of a week) -- the same local media was attempung to promote the prospect that Harkness and the learn might return. This acted as yet another clear attempt to instill false hopes in the community and maintain the winter ice action at Union. Why were the community and media so reluctant to support the Schenectady Sports Complex proposed a few years ago, and why after such an unexpected and misunderstood event at Union were they compelled to act as a labor mediator and provide routes of negotiation requested by neither side? The issue, however, does not end with the media's coverage. Concordiensis feels strongly that Ned Harkness was wrong in leavmg mid-season. His decision which in the future may cause him trouble, is one which unqucstiolli!bly made life very uncomfor.taple for t!lose c.losesl to him -- his players. The players were the ones who were ulumatdy laced with a loyalty or value decision. ·They had to decide whether their loyaltie~ rested with their coach who had .opened the· __ gate to their future or with a school which no longer employed that man. They of course felt that the man meant more to them and they could no longer wear Union's colors. Even when two leading players were offered the player-coach positions. the1r collective loyalty n·maaned detached from the :;chool. The ex- varsity team tl'uly skated fc>r 1\ed Harkness, and therefore would ne\'t:r '~a-te lor anyone- d!>e at tJmun. 1 he movement of e1ght player> to pro !arm clubs lurther mdac<~tes th.:1r deadened intere~t in Unwn.

The suspension of the four players appears to have been · handled professionally and properly, and the treatment of the players on campus had seemed to reach a nearly normal state. Player~ were treated as second class citizens only when they acted and perlhrmed like that caliber of per:.son. In general, the atmosphere towards hockey had improvecl. Opponents now knew where the program stood and in what respects the school had compromised its values. The real issues were beginning to be dealt with in positive rational discussions and honest actions. The possibility of building a team whicll did not compromise Union's standards seemesJ possible. For these reasons Concordiensis feels that Coach Harkness left Union for some undisclosed reason larger in scope than those in popular .belief. Concordy does not know the nature .of this proposed reason, but has reason to believe it exists, and is engaged in det~rmining its identity. Within a week of the varsity, team's resignation, Union had a new team formed by J.V.'s and walkons; less than a week after their promotion to the varsity level; they challenged Queen's College. Although defeated, their spirit, ambitions and ,sense of sportsmanship was superior. The new team has the full support of Concordiensis and hopefully the entire campus. The game Sunday, showed thili in most respeets, however many of those cheated 1ocals felt wmpelled to come to Union and show their dissatisfaction by cheering and encouraging Union's opponenh. For those who felt deprived of the opportunity to see college hockey, the chance again exist~. Unfortunately, for many in the community, hockey without Ned Harkel)s isn't hockey or it isn't enjoyable if t.he horne team 1sn't a sure wmncr. if they want to become 1molved in Uo.ion Sports, Concordiensis would like to know why they don't Sltpport the other sports on campus. Furthermore, the actiDns of some of the ex-hockey team at the game were unjustified and im:x.cusable. The desire to be able to play at another school may have prompted their desjre to see Union'1l new program fold, but it seems that they wot!ld have some respect for those representing the school. Their actions were totally unjustified; and in the past, when .they were on the ice. even though some opposed the program's foundations, everyone: wanted the team to win. Also Coach Harkness' prediction concerning the level of .activity of Schenectady's Ambulance Corps never reached ftdfillment. Queens and Union played a dean, injury-free game. Concordiensis would like \'sw~n:Sa1f\bi:~t!se 1 ~l''1'~\\'·'1rtftd ~'~ 0 \'''\Vhti<'lt-te''StilVtW ·tf$11 tU'tlSe a ·\'ol!i1ff~1;'lif\·H\t~1ii1V'''''··i'·.;,:ntt:lf~ • ·, discrttt<iir ~ ,;in'-' }ronr · · \behcavior. ··students· · ~ere . •..

If thi~ i!> the unfavorable atmosphere o1 the pa~t tall !u 1.\llach Harkness referred, then he 1s denying the members of this campu~ a ba~1c democratK r.ight ·- that of critictsm and disagreement. The suspension of the four players appears to have been handled professionally and properly, and the treatment of the players on campus had seemed to reach a nearly normal state. Players were treated as second class citizens only when they acted and performed like that caliber of person. In general, the atmosphere towards hockey had improved. Opponents now knew where the program litood and in what respects the school had compromised its values. The real issues were beginning to be dealt with in positive rationaJ discussions and honest actions. The possibility of building a team which did not compromise Union's standa·rds seemed possible. For these reasons Concordiensis feels that Coach Harkness left Union for some undisclosed reason larger in sc()pe than those in popular belief. Concordy does n<lt know the nature of this proposed reason, but has reason to believe it .exists, and is engaged in determining its identity. •' M,ore Enthusiasrn \ \, ', ·, Within a week of the varsity, team's resignation, Union had a new team formed by J.V.'s and walkons; less than a week after their promotion to the varsity level, they challenged Queen's College. Although defeated, their spirit, ambitions and sense of sportsmanship was superior. The new team has the full ~upport of Concordiensis and hopefully the entire campus. The game Sunday, ~bowed this in most rcspeet~. however many of tho~e cheated locals felt wmpelled to come tu Uni•m and ~how the:r dissatisfaction by cheering and encnuraging Union's upponent~.

The de~tire to be able to play at another school may have prompted their des,ire to see Union's new pwgra:m: fold, but it seems that they would have some respect for those representing the 1 school. Their actions were totally unjustified, and in the past, when they were on the ice, even though some opposed the program's foundations, everyone · wanted the team to win. Also Coach Harkness' prediction concerning the level of activity of Schenectady's Ambulance Corps never reached fulfillment. Queens and Union played a clean, injury-free game. Concordiensis would like to take this opportunity to wish the new team luck lin 1ts upcoming games.

OPINION In 197.5 it. was announced that the former coach of the Detroit Red Wings, Ned Harkness, would be building Union College's first · hockey team. Given Harkness' prior success at both RPI and Cornell, Union Sl'lemed destined to become a major contender in . the ECAC At· the ume, however, no one at. U ni'on was ·able to or chmt: not to ~ foresee the ceopt-roversy that would emerge m the little over 21;2 years that Harkness served as coa<.:h. It culminated in Harkness' surprise resignation and the subse1.1uent walkout, en masse, by the hockey team. No one can fault Harkness. By virtue of his past perlormances and experiences, he came to L: nion to establish a nationally competitive hockey pov.er. It i~ not important whether he wa~ lt:d to believe that he had rm~ rein to establish this program or whctht:r he deliberately misled wllcgc administrators, faculty and ~tudcnh in his clait•l that he hau no intention ol expandmg intu o:vision I competition. What is important is that Harkness was a winner and someone should have hi.td tht: loresight tn see that this program would expand. For an academic inst·itution to build a wmpetitivt: team. i.n any sport, it must be wi·l'ling to compromise its academic ~tandards to attract athletes. While there are mam scholar athletes, no institution that wishes to be a major powe~ ~:an draw enough to till the ranks of its teams. The institution must be ~A.illing to trade oft some academic performance to get good athktic material. There is nothing wr:ong with this. After all, the athletes make contributions to the imtitution in their own right. Yet, to attract the superstars and build a major athletic power (certainly a Division l team), the colleges and universities must be willing to bend the rules and sacrifice many of their academic standards. Extensive recruiting must be carr:ied out in addition to the compromise of admission and financial aid ~::ligibility requiremenh. Once these students are enrolled, they generally face a tough academic battle. A heavy burden is added when the athletes ha\e rigorous competitive scheduks, not to mention practice, added to their academic and social lives. Some targe schoob, by virtue of the1r size alone, can alford to bend certaia standards to accommodate their lew athletes. In many institutions with high caliber athletic programs, exceptions arc made for their athletes. They are there to play and the institutions will go out of their way to keep them enrolled. But. in small colleges that maintain high academic standards, such as Union, the collegiate ideal- scholarship above all ebe must hold firm. Any deviation from this principle is in direct conflict \\·ith the stated goal of the .college. Over the past 2 years there has emergt:d a stark division in the college community, separating hockey supporters trom dissenters. Although the cata,lyst behind the dissenters was a core group ol involved student leaders and concerned laculty members, it ~oon mushroomed tO include a si1able port ion ol. students, faculty. and administrators . Tempers flared, sparked in part by inflammatory student · l)ewspaper ar.tides and the energies of many people became invested in issues of athletics rather than academics. The hockey controversies finally· set:med sctth:d last ~ummer when the Union College trustees voted to leave tht: Ne'vli England Small College Athletic Conference, but when they did so the} informed Harkness that Union College hockey would go no further than Division II competition. Harkness resigned three weeks ago after the suspension ol I our hockey players for academic reasons. It is my belief that Harkness resigned because ef the trustees' decision not to enter Division I. Harkness is a winner and Union refused to let his athletic aspirations interfere with education. Throughout these conflicts, Harkness stated he recruited academically competmt athletes. A Sports Illustrated article a year ago asked us. to believe Harkness recruited academic superstan. Yet when the team quit: eight players left school to join the pros. lt shows how academically oriented the recruits were. The .case of Ned Harkness and hockey at Union College points up the larger issue - the role of athletics in a small ins tit uti on, such as Union, deeply committed to academic excellence. While sports programs are an integral part of any academic institution, Harkness' goal to create a nationally competitive hockey power could only be realized in an institution with a stronger commitment to athletics and greater resources to fulfill this commitment. Lnwn College is obvious~y not.such a place. -BEN GREEN 1 Ed' . h. f ' · 1tors-m-c se .........................................................

But, in small colleges that maintain high academic standards, such as Union, the collegiate ideal - scholarship above all ebe must hold firm. Any deviation from this principle is in d1rect conflict with the stated goal of the college. Over the past 2 years there has emerged a stark division in the college community, separating hockey supporters t rom dissenters. Although the catalyst behind the di:-,!>entcrs wa~ a core group ot involved student leaders and concerned !acuity members, it soon mushroomed to include a sitable portion of studenb, faculty. and administrators. Tempers flared. sparked in part by inflammatory student newspaper articles a.nd the energies of many people became invested in issues of athletics rather than academics.

Harkness resigned three weeks ago after the suspension ol lour hockey players for academic reasons. It is my belief that Harkness resigned because of the trustees' decision not to enter Division l. Harkness is a winner and Union refused to let his athletic aspirations interfere with education. Throughout these cont1icts, Harkness stated he recruited academically competent athletes. A Sports Illustrated article a }ear ago asked us to believe Harkness recruited academic superstar:-,. Yet when the team quit: eight players left school to join the prm.. It shows how academically oriented the recruits were. The case of Ned Harkness and hockey at Union College poinb up the larger issue - the role of athletics in a small institution, such as Union, deeply committed to academic excellence. While sports programs are an integral part of any academic institution . Harkness' .goal to create a nationally competitive hockey po\\.er could only be realized in an institution with a ~tronger commitment to athletics and greater resources to fulfill this commitment. Union College is obviously not such a place. -BEN GREEN ·cmlon coa.,. • • concorOtens1·s 1 Editors-in-chief ........................................................ Joe Cappuccto.

It was determined that nineteen students were in this pos1t10n, among them, four members of the Varsity Hockey team. the way in which this matter wa...:; bandied by college officials was severely criticized by Coach Ned Harkness, and in addition ;to other , .. bones of contention'' led to his eventual resignatio11:: as hockey coach and Director e»f Achilles Rink. This action was in turn follo-wed by the resignatiol1! o.f the entire Union College Varsity Hockey Team. Union College Athletic Director, Richard Sakala, was informed. that same Friday of the committee\s decision, but as the Hockey Team was on the road in Hanover, :Ne-w Hampsbire at the time, a decision had t() be made as t() tile llandling ()f the matter. It was <lecided thl!t the four student ·play,ers in question would be penni::tted to play in the Dartmo 'lit b Btue-Green . :-_. Tournament on December 16th and 17th. The four students met with Dean of Students Nydegger, Athletic Director SakaHt. and Coach Ned Harkness tm· Monday, December 19th. At the' meeting they were advised that they were- being dropped from the college for academic reasons. Dean Nydegger explained the situation thoroughly to all parties involved, although the official:, word on this matter was communicated later by letter to the students and their parents. As was the case with all the other students affected by the committee's decision on student standing, the letters were mailed out on Wednesday, the 21st. In the eyes of President Bonner, Dean Nydegger and Athletic Director Sakata, the method of notification was totally proper, and \done through normal channels,\ leaving n() doubt as to the equity by whicll the matter was handled_ Following a review of NCAA and ECAC rules governing eligibility of athletes, it was decided that in the best interest of the college, the four student athletes would not be permitted to participate in Wednesday evening'.s game with McMaster. This particularly fl.nnoyed Coach Harkness as it left him with only thirteen available players for that night's contest. Between the time of verbal ,-,·:.·':\ ... notification on Monday and .the McMaster game Wednesday nigbt, information regar~ing the ~identities . of the stu5i~nt . players involved became ·known-.to the-- · I'Ocal- n~\)!s media: This.;· information came from ·neither· President Bonner nor any other officer or representative of the college.

Richards has been appointed Personnel Director at Union College. Richards, when contacted by Concordy, said he was \pleasantly surprised wh.en notified of his appointment. He added that he '\Wanted to come to Union very much\ because he desired an occupation involved with an institution of higher learning and he found Union's environment very exhilarating. maximize the efficiency of these workers. Mr. Richards received his B.A. from Wilkes College in 1958, and later attended the University of -Rochester as a graduate student. His appointment came as the result of a four month search by the school fm a Personnel Director. It was the school's second search, as the first was terminated because of a lack of appropriate applicants. George R. Richardson, appointed Director of Personnel Richards formerly worked far a professional consulting firm where he specialized in various types. of insurance plans. He also has Worked as Personnel Director for Clifton Springs Hospital and Clinic in Clifton Springs, N.Y. and was in the field of emp-loyee relations and management development for the University of Rochester. Though excited about his new position, Richards said that it also entails tremendous responsibility, as his department is the \watchdog of a lot of dollars.\ As Director of Personnel, he is in charge of a full range of pr(.)grams for hourly employees but also the faculty and administrators. First Meeting of Student Forum As personnel director, Richards has .set. a number of short-term goals for himseif. He. 'pians to reevaluate the various programs while cutting their cost. Additionally, in response to the complaints of some employees under his jurisdiction, Richards plans to clarify these employees job descriptions as they are vag11e and indistinct. According to Richards, clarification of employees' occupations is only part of a larger program that he has developed which would On Monday, January 9, the Student Forum held its first meeting of the winter term. President Mike Ganz opened the meeting with. the sad news that sophomore Wendy Bernstein passed away over the vacation. Various ideas were discussed and it was then agreed that an award would be established in her name. A plaque will be awarded each year to a sophomore who best represents the ideals upheld by Wendy. It was then noted that the NYPIRG Pamphlets explaining the new marijuana laws, which were ord(!red .in September, had been received. It was suggested that they could be given out free of charge to students at a booth in Carnegie Hall. Also at that booth will be the student phone directory, available for fifty c.ents. Bob Weinbaum and Ben Rubin were present at the meeting in order to present to the Forum the constitution of the Health Society. Some of the goals of the Society according to Ben Rubin were to \update student interest DALE TIMBERLAKE in the health field on current events, for example - new exams? new trends and types of schools to apply to .and to expose both people applying and the general Union College public to current topics of interest going on in the medical world.\ ~annin~ dogs from the library be strictly enforced. This measure, \'hirh will include fines, will be taken by the Traffic and Pet Court of the School. It was also decided that other recommendations of Ms. Evans to· keep the back door of the all night study locked and a guard placed at the entrance to the library during library hours should be discussed and brought up at the next All College Senate Meeting, in February. The next meeting of the Student Forum is scbeduled for Monday, Jan. 16 at 10:00 p.m. in SS 110 and is open to all members of the Union CoHege Community.

Next, a motion was proposed by Randy Feldman, that the space provided on the Editorial Page of Concordy to the Student Forum, be used instead of exclusively by the Student Trustees, by other members of the Forum. This was agreed to. The last item discussed concerned the possibility of changing the grade point system. Last term it was agreed that a poll would be taken to find student sentiment on this topic. The poll will take place on Thursday, Jan. 19. Before the poll, facts and opinions concerning the possible change will appear on the Editorial Page of Concordiensi~. . The next topic of discussion was the recommendation of Ruthann Evans, that . the rule In addition to the above function, the PHC column will state the views of the Pan Hellenic Council on any campus issue. Any opinions expressed in the column will be discussed and endorsed by the council. They are not necessarily the opinions of any Greek Society member. soctal budgets of fraternities and sororities and consequently this will allow more parties to be planned where they might not otherwise have been able to be financed. The extent of use of Greek cards has been left to the discretion of the individual houses. It is not mandatory that the cards be used at every function and the admission price itself will be determined by the Fraternity or Sorority according to the cost of the event. Since all Greek .society . members pay a social fee each term to their houses, Greek members will still be footing most of the bills for social events. These cards are simply an attempt to distribute these costs among the entire campus since most parties on campus are attended by independents as well as fratermty and sorority members. As a point of information, this policy is not new to college campuses where Greek Societies exist. Many other schools such as Hamilton College and Lehigh University have a policy such as this one in operation or are in the process of instituting such a policy. The first announcement to be explained is the recent distribution of \Greek Society Member\ cards to all present members of Fraternities and Sororities. This policy was passed in a meeting during the fall term by a unanimous vote. The cards will be used as passes into future Fraternity and Sorority parties. This policy may at first be erroneously interpreted as an attempt to segregate Greek society members from independents. This is not the reason that th.e cards are being used.

This show, sponsored by the Union College \' Gallery, will run from January 7 through February 19. . :~ ·~ •. ''•' :···· Weinberg, who earned his B.F. A at the Rhode Island School ef Design, and his M.F.A. at Yale University, has been an artist-in-residence at Union College for over a year. His many major exhibitions include the Museum of Modern Art, the Jewish Museum, and the Guggen- heim M·useum in New York City, and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. He has taught at Cooper Union, Dartmouth College, Boston University, and Temple University. Weinberg is currently teaching sculpture, design and graphics at Union. The show is not a true retro- spective. Instead, it touches on various subjects that have intrigued Weinberg. His earliest theme in the show is the Hebraic religious, although the pieces are not old examples of this theme. He often returns to a theme many years later with fresh ideas. .The major theme of the show is the moralizing theme of the mad dog, portraying \man's inhumanity to man, by using the symbol of the mad dog taking over the seat of reason.\ This symbolic device represents how irrationality '\occupies destroys, and grotesquely mimics the rational.\ This device is not unique. Both Goya and Picasso (among others) have used the image of man being bestial. Other themes in the show can be categorized as religious, bridal, and classical mythological. The cheerful bridal theme was inspired by a trip to North Africa that \triggered a series of exotic bridal interpretations of Bedouin and Yemenite origins.\ The themes of classical mythology covered are those of Charon, \the fellow who carries the dead across the river,\ Pandora's Box, Leda and the Swan, Narcissus, and Saturn and his children. The themes of this show are less heavy than some of the themes that Weinberg has used in the past. Weinberg hesitated to say which was his favorite piece in the show, since \artists are not very ()bjective about their own work,\ but finally chose \Night Gate,\ a small bronze piece made up of diverse elements. It is from the surreal camp, representing the mystery of night. Although it is an individual piece and not part of the mad dog series, the image of the dog is again used, sitting as a brooding spector. One is left with a question about \the oncoming mystery of night.\ The oldest piece in the show is the Moroccan Bride, made in 1959. Much of this show is \an axe to grind,\ especially the mad dog theme. Generally, however, Weinberg feels that preaching has no place in sculpture. He prefers story-telling art, although realizing that it is a \dangerous area.\ The 20th century does not smile on this style of sculpture. Nevertheless, he has always been moved by literary sources. \For myself, each has his own fountains of inspiration.\ Sculpture is concerned with space and 3-dimensions. There is a unique sensation from placing something in space; the \thereness\ of it. Wood is Weinberg's favorite material to .work in, although there are no wood sculptures in this show. It is a \warm\ material. You work in it and produce it directly. Bronze encompasses the majority of the sculptures in the show. \I love bronze ... , hut it doesn't have the immediacy of wood.\ He has also pieces in terra cotta and marble. There is no average work time for a sculpture. Although a lot of sculpture involves pure manual labor, some things you can't solve quickly. Weinberg has worked as long as 1 V2 years on a sculpture, and as short as one day. Among the most fascinating pieces in the show are #36-\City Dog,\ a provocative piece with a dog held on a leash by a disembodied hand; #7-\Bound Angel,\ a small, but beautifully detailed work; and #4~\Harry Escapes,\ an amusing sequence of an ape escaping from a box. Another very inventive sculpture is #48-\Flight of the Mad Dog.\ The details of this piece were extremely interesting. According to Weinberg, the purpose of an art-show is two- fold. First of all, he semi- humorously said, it is vanity. But it is also for communication, to show what you do to other people so they can share an experience with you. There are. many people who are interested in· art, and want to see each other's work and mutually stimulate each other. He student to go on in the arts without warning them of the great risks involved.\ There are many ups and downs. \But that doesn't :;;&''Mw)<r~\!JtW'fif.f.J. fMiii:Wt%t%~~'il\.tb.<· minimize how important l think it ·''\ ....... , •. ,.,,,,,:.;;hiN.;tlWMt···'·''\\'\'·''; is.\ After the basics, what else is ··· · · \'· ,., ·•· 'c · · · ,,., there but the development of non- ' ' --~ :· .·. material values? \You're only on this planet a short time, and it's a . fabulous place to be.\ One of Weinberg's greatest satisfactions is seeing students outside of the arts learn to enjoy art and see themselves participating in it. Once they get over their initial inhibition, they can really enjoy art. However, he feels there is not enough time in Union courses to teach all of what the study of art really requires. Although basic cr.aft work can be taught, it is ., hard to show the essence of art. Photo by Nevin Dub~~ .. Art ha~ a little something else; an excitement.

Every great craft enough space so that \you can spotlight something and reveal its volumes.\ Equal lighting ruins this. Sculpture depends on the lighting; it becomes a . different thing with different kinds of lighting. \It is a wonderful feeling when the things can be seen well.\ Weinberg compared art with sports. People like sports for several reasons other than violence.. They \appreciate the artistic value, the great skill, of the players.\ Art can be great because of the artistic value of its resolution. The main difference bet wee~ tbe. two is the i~mediacy of sports. In both forms, you are dealing with people who have passions - intensity, love and commitment.

Page6 CONCORDIENS/S, January II, I978 culture Elbert Weinberg Sculpture Here by MITO-U . .lL WOU!'i An exhibit ()f forty-lour works ol sculptw~: hy Elbert Weinberg arc nov. on exhibit at the Schenectady Museum. This show, sponsored b) the lJ mon College <.iailery. Will run from January 7 through February 19. Weinberg. who earned his B.F.A. at th.e Rhode Island School of Design. and his M.F.A. at Yale University, has been an artist-in-residence at Union College for over a year. His many major exhihition~ include the Museum of M()dern Art. th•: .Jewish M meum. and the Ciuggen- heim Museum in J'l.iew York City, and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington ll.C He has taught at C()oper Union, Dartmouth College, Boston University, and Temple University. Weinl>erg is currently teaching sculpture, design and graphics at Union. The show is not a true retro- spective. Instead, it touches on vanous subjects that have intrigued Weinberg. His earliest theme in the show is the Hebraic religious, although the pieces are not old examples of this theme. He often returns to a theme many year~ later with fresh ideas. The major theme of the show is the moralizing theme of the mad dog, portraying \'man's inhumanity to man, by using the symbol of the mad dog taking over the seat of reason.\ This symbolic device represents nOW irrationality \occupies. destroys, and grotesquely mim1cs the rational.\ I his device is not unique. Roth Goya and f>icasso (among others) have used the ima.ge of man being bestial. Other themes in the show can be categorized as religious. bridal, and classical mythological. The cheerful bridal theme was inspired by a trip to North Africa that \triggered a series of exotic bridal interpretations of Bedouin and Yemenite origins.\ The themes of classical mythology covered are those of Char()n, \the fellow who carries the dead across the river,\ Pandora's Bo:x, Leda and the Swan, Narcissus, and Saturn and his children. The themes of this show are less heavy tll.an some of the themes that Weinberg has used in the past. Weinberg hesitated to say which was his favorite piece in the show, since .. 'artists are not very objective about their own work,\ but finally chose .. Night Gate,\ a small bronze piece made up of diverse elements. It is from the surreal catrlp, representing the mystery of night. Although it is an individual piece and not part of the mad do ,g series, the image of the dog is again used, sitting as a brooding spector. One is left with a question about \the oncoming mystery of night.\ The oldest piece iA the show is the Moroccan Bride, made in 1959. Much of this show is \an axe to grind,\ especially the mad dog theme. Generally, however, Weinberg feels that preaching has no place in sculpture. He prefers story-telling art, although realizing that it is a \dangerous area.\ The 20th century does not smile on this style of sculpture. Nevertheless, he has always been moved by literary sources. \For myself, each has his own fountains of inspiration.\ Sculpture is concerned with space and 3-dimensions. There is a unique sensation from placing something 1n space; the \thereness\ of it. Wood is Weinberg's favorite material to work in, although there are no wood sculptures in this show. It is a \warm\ material. You work in it and produce it directly. Bronze encompasses the majority of the sculptures in the show. \I Jove bronze .... but it doesn't have the immediacy of wood.\ He has also pieces in terra cotta and marble. There is no average work time for a sculpture. Although a lot of sculpture involves pure manual labor, some things you can't solve quickly. Weinberg has worked as long as 11;2 years on a sculpture, and as short as one day. Among the most fascinating pieces in the show are #36-\City Dog,\ a provocative piece with a dog held on a leash by a disembodied hand; #7-\Bound Angel,\ a small, but beautifully detailed work; and #4-\Harry Escapes,\ an amusing sequence of an ape escaping from a box. Another very inventive sculpture is #48-\Flight of the Mad Dog.\ The details of this piece were e~tremely intefesting. According to Weinberg, the purpose of an art-show is two- fold. First of all, he semi- humorously said, it is vanity. But it is also for communication, to show what y()u do to other people so they can share an experience with you. There are many people who are interested in art, and want to see each other's work and mutually stimulate each other. He student to go on in the art~ without warning them of the great rish involved.\ There arc many ups and downs. \But that doesn't minimize tlow important I think it is.\ After the basics, what else is there but the development of Flon- material value-;? \You're only on this planet a short time, and it's a fabulous place to be.\ One of Weinberg's greatest satisfactions is seeing students outside of the arts learn to enjoy art and see themselves participating in it. Once they get over their initial inhibition, they can really enjoy art. Hov.c\ er, he fecb there is not enough time in Union course~ to teach all of what the study of art really requires. Although basic craft work can be taught, it is hard to show the essence of art. ;how br Nevm Dubin \Art has a little something else; · an excitement. A great craft is especially excited about this object can have a magical show because the Schenectady presence. Without the magical, Museum offers a true opportunity art endeavor remains craft.\ to show his sculptures well. The However, the two are not lighting is very fine. There is separate entities. Every great craft enough space so that \you can spotlight something and reveal its volumes.\ Equal lighting ruins this. Sculpture depends on the lighting; it becomes a different thing with different kinds of lighting. \It is a wonderful feeling when the things can be seen well.\ Weinberg compared art with sports. People like sports for several reasons other than violence. They '\appreciate the artistic value, the great skill, of the players.\ Art can be great because of the artistic value of its resolution. The main difference between the two is the immediacy of ~ports. In both forms, you are dealing with people who have passions -- intensity, love and commitment. It would be marvelous if people could appreciate the arts on an equal level with sports. \If people could be exposed enough ... they could have intense experiences in the arts.\ But generally, art is thought of as purely decorative, to \fill up empty wall-space.\ This is usually because of a lack of exposure to ideas about art.

CONCORDIENSIS, January 11, 1978 Pagel arttl culture Tartar to A'ppear by JIM ANDER._SON On Friday, January 13th poet Helen Tantar will apppear at Cnion in severa'l events ~ponsored by the IDOL literary magazine. Ms. Tartar comes originally from Washington state, but has for the last five }t:ars rived in New Haven, Connecticut. She strives for directness and simplicit in her poetry, infl~enc~d strongly by her study ol Oriental verse and her interest in :Eastern philosophy and thought. Elizabeth Bishop, John Berryman and Wallace Stevens are among the AmericaR poets she enjoys reading, but Ms. 1 artar is reluctant to identity herself with any ~articular school lll poetic thought. Most tmportant she feeb is for the poet to find a voice to express the interaction between internal and external worlds.

Then at 7:00 P.M. in Hale House Lower Lounge Helen Tartar plans to read her own poetry, followed by a brief question and answer period d.uring which wine and cheese will be served.

'·' Nott Memorial Photo by Ed Platz A structural study undertaken in 1971 by Restorative Architects found the interior to be deteriC;>rating at an alarming rate. These architects~ retained by Union:'s Trustees and Alumni Council, blamed the prevailing condition of the Nott on \decades of deferred maintenance.\ Th.e study revealed the necessity for urgent roof repairs. These repairs were made, and according to Prqfessor Huntley, Chairman of the Campus Plannia-g Board, ~,ach succeeding year has seen more roof repairs. However, sooner or later, some permanent work will have to be dontl in order to save the bqilding from complete deterioration.

But persons from the Maintenance Depar.tment and the company that is installing a ri.ew fire detection system in college buildings had reason to become hea,ted up last month when they found that 25 fire alarms and 30 fire extinguishers were inoperable and had not been in working order for an undetermined time during the just-completed fall term when students occupied the buildings. Once located, .the damaged equipment was replaced in two days by six wo.rkers. The extinguishers were put out of service when their contents were emptied. The vandalized alarms would not have sounded if a fire had begun. \We found towels arid papers stuffed in back of the alarms,\ said Clifford Wood, Director of Security at Union. ••111 some of the alarms, the plunger had been turned so that it would not sound if activated. Others had been ripped from the wall, disconnecting the wires.\ Suzanne Dowling, Director of Housing, said that no one knows who broke the ex. tinguishers and alarms. \If the R.A.'s. had known, rm sure they would have told me,\ she said. \But the students who caused the damage know who did it. And I'm sure they didn't realize the seriousness of their action:· Ms. Dowling understands that the alarms can be annoying -- e~pecially when they ring in the early hours _of the ENGINEERING - OPTIONS & OPPORTUNITIES The Office of Career Resources in conjunction with the ASCE and ASME student organizations are presently organizing a program to be held Wednesday, January 18, at 8:00p.m. in Hale House upper lounge. The purpose of the program is to ex.pose any student who is interested in an engineering related career to the variety of options where one could direct specific i~diyi~!l~l. in- terests and skills. · The· ·basic format of the progratn will consist morning, as occured several times during the fall term. \So it doesn't seem like much to stop the alarm outside your room from ringing,\ she said. \It's the same way when a person empties a fire extinguisher. He's just. having some fun, and doesn't think it's going to harm anyone. But it does. Tampering with the fire detection and prevention .system can have catastrophic effects. Those people are jeopardizing students' lives. They're endangering their friends and themselves.\ Twelve of the broken fire alarms were located in Davidson House. Anoth~r twelve were in Fox House. Two were in Hickok House, and one was in Smith House. In addition to the damaged alarms and extinguishers, the central fire detector panel on the ground floor of West College had been tampered with. The repairs cost abou.t $2000. Engineers who had been installing Wifing for Union's new centralized fire detection system had to stop work and check each of the alarms and extinguishers to make sure they worked. All of these units were working when the 1977-78 academic year began last September, according to J. Richard Mills of Physical Plant. \But they hadn't been checked since then,\ he said. ··so they could have been out of service for months.\ The damaged equipment was located several days after the fall terrn ended when the dormitory alarms were tested so that they could be connected to the wiring for Union's new detection system: of a panel composed of engineers from businesses within the Schenectady community. All students are encouraged to consider attending some of tne many workshops to be offered through ·the office of Career Resources during the winter term. Please stop by the office to sign up.

An alarm can be disconnected without disconnecting th.e whole .circuit. And the extinguishers could have been eptptied at any time.\ Conditions during the winter term here greatly increase the chance of a fire stfl,rting. Heating in the buildings is· always operating, and students tend to spend more time in the dorms. \We're going to have to be especiallly careful,\ Dean Nydegger said ... If this kind of damage continues, we're going to have to conduct fire drills to make sure the alarms are working. And there's nothing worse . than having to stand outside during the winter in Schenectady.\ To further p-revent blazes from occuring, as well\ as to educate Union's student bGdy about fire prevention, Dean Nydegger and the housing and maintenace departments met with R.A,'s last Thursday.

The Tournament held at Union's Memorial . Fieldhouse saw RPl defeat Marist in the 'first game of the doubleheader. Union then played Albany in what turned out to be the most exciting game of the tournament. . The contest started at a fast pa<:e; Union playing its typical aggressive defense, Albany working the ball around the outside until finally scoring. However, Albany's offense proved too strong as the Great Danes built an early eight point lead. Yet, Union did not stop their hustling, baU ... hawking defense. Soon, Albany saw their slim lead dwindle as the Dutchmt:ti, led by Mike Smith's ·.eleven ·first-ltalf pQintS'~ ·evened· the score at thirty- five when the half ended. the second half started much the same as the first. Yet,.instead of Albany jumping out in front, . ... the Dutchmen held theu ground. In fact, Union slowly took control as guards Tony Coles and Cardney led the charge. C~udney, a freshman from Plattsburgh, N.Y., began hitting numerou. shots from twenty feet away. These baskets forced Albany to pull its defense out, thus enabling the Dutchman hoopers to work the ball inside to not only Captain Smith, but also forwards John Montanile and K.R. Marshall. Soon Unipn had a three point lead . Albany, however, used an .effective full court press- which troubled Union for much of the half. It was this press that kept the Great Danes in the game. With just minutes left in the contest, Union held a slim lead. Coles was on the bench and Ca:rdney was leading the offense. Then on a controversial call, Cardney fouled out. This· appeared to be a crucial downfall for the Dutchmen. Scanlon called for Coles, and Coles delivered and took control of the floor with sharp passing and a couple of clutch steal~<. With just seconds to play, Union led by two points. The crowd was anxious for a first round victory, especially over rival Albany. But this goal was postponed as Albany scored, putting the game into overtime, 69-69. \ The overt1me period was the highest scoring done by either team. UniQn jumped out in front early as .. shots were made by Smith underneath and Coles from both the outside and. on fa11tbreak · layups. As a result of their personal heroics an«;; the entire .tea111's aggressive ·effective play, the Dutchmen went on to win, 89- 85. . The Finals appeared to be the easier match fot the Dutchmen. , After beating a strong foe such as Albany, the Cagers eyed a championship over the weaker Engineers of RP!. This goal, however, was not attained as RPI possessed a three point lead at the .half. The Engineers, who never lost their lead throughout .the contest, continued to play tough. The second half play continued in RPI's favor as Union's aggressive style of play seemed to be lacking its normal zest.

Women's B-Ball Opens Season by LYNN BATEMAN !t appears that it's going to be a favorable year for the Union Women's Varsity Basketball team as they are armed with much- improved coaching, a stronger and more skilled team, and an enthusiastic spirit. Practices have been hard (between 12-1 S hours per week), but they are paying off, as the Dutchwomen proved in their two · pre-vacation games, victorious in their first against HVCC, and losing by a hair in their second game to Potsdam. The women face some tough opposition this season, starting off against physical Russell Sage Jan. 23,. and finishing up against Colgate Feb. 27. The members are as follows: Cathy Reals, · co-captain; Lynn Bateman, co-captain; Dot Scarpinato, Sheila ()'Donnell, Kathy Mahar, Debbie Sears, Kathy Lett. Jill Henry, and Andrea Bowers.

Dutchman Bob Smolens garnered the \black vitamin\ along the boards in the Union zone. Firing the disc across ice, Mark Taube hauled it in. Skating past a defender, he moved in on goal. A quick flick of the wrist and the puck sailed cleanly over the goaltender's left shoulder, rippling the cords. Union goal! Union goal! The bench emptied, the crowd roared, and the familiar chant of \sieve\ bellowed from the stands. Union had lost the battle but won the war. Eight seconds later the game was over. Queens had outshot Union 87-20 and outscored the Garnet 19-1. The Dutchmen had been totally outplayed in every phase of the game. Yet, as Coach Bob Driscoll's squad left the ice, beleaguered goaltender Dave Schmertz raised his fist toward the applauding Union supporters as if a championship had been won. No, a championship had not been won, and wouldn't. Not thi§ year and probably not for years to come. \' * * * futures of many individuals were jeopardized. The future of Union College looked bleak. Schenectady claimed of an \injustice.\ Ned Harkness had resigned as hockey coach due to things that \compromised my ·\ effectiveness as a hockey coach.\ Following suit, the entire team quit, refusing to play the remainder of the schedule. It was the painful ending to a rollercoaster controversy Union had ridden with since the sport's institution in 1975. to the ice on January 8, 1978. As the climax of what easily could have been a James Michener book, the Garnet skaters only served as background a~tors in a play. On January 3, 1978, the student body returned fnom their winter recess. Quickly, news spread of players departing for professional teams while others remained at Union, in solitude, unsure oftheir futures. A new varsity team was composed and this group was sent * * * * The game itself was not much. Queens was clearly superior. Winger Gary Brandt seemed at times to skate through the Union defense at will. On the other hand, the Dutchmen alsa had its heroes. Deserving of praise are Randy Clark, Robert Knibb, Schmertz, Taube, and especiaJly Jerry Kirby. Anyway, it became obvious during the first period that Union surely could not win nor even be competitive. Only one task needed to be fulfilled - they ~114 io sc.ore.

Winter Track Begins by ALLAN MOLHO During these winter months, you may be pleased to know that there are men and women running around in shorts and t- shirts to brighten the dreary days ahead. They are the Union College Indoor Track Team. They have been training for the past few weeks and soon they start trying to attain their success of last year as they represent one of the best Division lil teams. Coach Chuck James is excited about this year's team not only because of its many strengths but also because of the increased participation. He feels equally. as important is the hard workmg attitude of all the team members. This is very evident as most of the team arrives at practice one half hour before the schedul~d beginning. Coach James feels this positive attitude is indicative . of the leadership that the co-captams Bob Moffat and Kevin Scheuer have given. Their hard work and their many accomplishments seem to encourage the rest of the team. Bob and Kevin were All- Americans last year and have set numerous records at Union and last year just missed qualifying for • ' • • • !-\ • )' the National Championships. Though Bob is a versatile runner, doing extremely well in the 440, 600, two mile and the mile relay, this year he will be able to concentrate more on his best event, the 600 (in which he holds the school record). This is because of the team's other capable runners. Junior Kevin Scheuer excells in the I 000 yard run and the mile. Kevin has the record in the 1000 and at a pre-season meet had an excellent time in the mile. Besides Kevin and Bob, the team has solid and consistent runners in Pete Vielkind, Matt Guilfoyle running the middle distances, Brian Liss and Jack Connor in the long distances and Lee Parrish and Ed Dingman sprint for the Dutchmen. Union is also well endowed in the hurdling event. Premier Crimmins and rookie Cliff Rodgers. In the pole vault, there are high hopes for freshman Jim Zalucki who vaulted 13'6\ last year. Coach James feels Jim will more than better the 14 foot mark by the end of the year. Admittedly.the Dutchmen have not been quite as strong in the field or weight events in past years. This year however there are hopes that football players Ed Kulick and Mike Heevy, although inexperienced, will learn quickly and help bolster that department which includes Doug Koch and Steve Vincent. There are several women on the team yet James would like to see more interested women talk to him about joining the team. He would like to .see Union have even more of a total track and field program. hurdler Matt Blum who holds For the first part of its the school record in the 55 and 60 schedule, Union wili use the Cor- yard hurdles, has Mark Nazon, . nell Invitational· for experience Tom and Phil Stegeman and for the younger members while he Andy Barber not- too far behind sends his best athletes to a h.

The statement is part of the process by which the school is accredited every ten years by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Union professors have served in just this capacity in the accrediting process at other sc!lools. Certain things about the statement need to be understood. First of all, it is a draft and not a final copy, and is therefore open to response by the entire coHege community. In fact. the Planning and Priorities Committee has stressed this and ur.ges as much response as possible.

Editorials Aeademie ~a.leodar Over the past few years, many suggestions have been proposed concerning the possible changing of the school calendar. These proposals have advocated both shifting the starting and finishing dates as well as abandoning the trimester system. The most current proposal was brought up by Professor Board during a recent All-College Senate meeting. This pn>posal suggesteq remaining on the trimester but beginning the fall term earlier. We of Concordiensis see no advantage to this system. It will only serve to shorten an already too short summer vacation and lengthen the time between terms when Union isn't but almost every other College is in session. For many, not leaving for school until mid-September is an important asset in obtaining a job, somewhat overcoming the diffi!:Ulties caused by spring term's extention through mid-June. The rationale given when the proposal was made seems ludicrous. It was stated that beginning the term earlier will avoid the conflict between the Yom Kippur holiday aRd the first days of classes as has happened in recent years. The fact is that the way the school calendar is now, classes do not begin until after the holidays a large percentage of the time, enabling religious observation while the student is still at home. Moving the calendar up, all but eliminates the possibility of being home for the holiday. This new system clearly offers no solution to the major problem concerning Union's calendar: namely, that of the late finishing date in the spring. It is possible that beginning fall term earlier would suggest that winter term could start before the first of the year. However, it seems that the Union College community is reluctant to give up the traditional Christmas vacation having it closer to Thanksgiving as well as not desiring the interruption of winter term by a 3-week break. Thus, starting the trimester calendar earlier does not seem to solve the problem. Concordiensis is in full agreement with the position taken by Division Ill at that Senate meeting: \that the only calendar change it could approve is one that will end the year earlier.\ Athletie Outlook In light of led B1ck\ propo~al (p. 6) concerning athletic~ ..

Dear Rudy, After extensive considera- tion, I have decid~d to submit my resignation to be effective April 21, 1978,. taking the last month as my vacation. At that time l shall have served as the Director of the Office of Career Resources and Placement, Assistant Dean of Students for almost five years. These past five years have been demanding. fun, challenging and rewarding. I have learned a great deal and I've accom- plished much of what I had hoped l would. I leave with ·many fond memories and a . deep sense of satisfaction. My decision to leave at this point is prompted by the dramatic administrative changes of the last year and the drastic change in · atmosphere those changes have wrought which has made it more and mQre difficult for me to derive satisfaction from my work. Since you have been at Union only a year, it may be difficult for you to fully a pprecia.te the sense of commitment, enthusiasm, p<Irticipation, tea~work and challenge that administrators,. particularly those in Student Affairs, shared al'mo·st unanimously in my first three and a half years at Union. There are frustrations and difficulties in our work ~ and fewer rewards for us than are available to other profes- sionals in higher education. On the middle administra- tive level, our work is often routine there are few opportunities for personal recognition, our work is not dictated by out own interests but by the demands and needs of students. We never receive the ~ecurity of tenure, never have the ()pportunity for sabbatical leaves. or trips abroad. We are paid a minimal salary and given little opportunity for advancement since promotional opportunities are few. Yet I loved my work - a feeling' I believe most of my colleagues shared ~ because we felt it was important, because we were in it, together because we shared in decisions and in the .search for solutions to problems. We saw our programs improve and begin to meet the needs of the student body. We were asked to contribute in large and small ways - we stepped in when asked to do so and we took on responsibilities often beyond those described in our somewhat vague job descriptions. To illustrate. without intending to boast, I have done the following in addition to my regular respon~ sibilities: -Chaired a Parents' f. Weekend · -Coached the first Women's Lacrosse Team - Assisted students in the founding of the Women's Caucus, including organizing of several Women's Weeks ~ Participated on the Com- mission on Racism -Organized and administered the founding of the President's Commission on the Status of Women -Chaired the search committee for our current women coaches -Was one of the four original organi.t:ers of the Union College Child Care Center - Member of Task Force that ·studied and reorganized the entire student work program, including the Grant- in-Aid_ Program My interests and contri- butions have extended far beyond my .specific job respon- sibility and into those areas .that my title of Assistant Dean of Students might indicate. But :it wasn't unusual for faculty members and contemporary context re~ults in a parochialism which not only blinds students to possible consequences of knowledge or actions, but also keeps them largely ignorant .of social and cultural circumstances which will affect them throughout their professional and personal lives. This is as true, for- example, of an artist unaware of contemporary technological achievements as it is of a scientist or engineer unaware of the control or\ natural resources by cultures witl;l different values and human priorities. 1 hese three characteristics should be fundamental to all educational programs at Union College. While it is fashionable among some people to dismiss engineering as \vocational education\ and therefore incon- sistent with the rest of an undergraduate program ded- icated to liberal education, this need not be the case. Critical thought, specialized knowledge, and a sense of context are as important to the intellectual development of engineering stu- projects above and beyond those required of us. That, I believe, is what made our work interesting ~ tl).at's what made up for the lack of rewards enjoyed by other professionals in Academia. I, at least, felt a sense of belonging to a community, being needed by a community ~ that was my motivation, the source of my morale. But the (lhanges on campus have been so devastating, and there are so few left who would remember or care that frankly. I have not had that sense dwriftg · this entire academic year. With your appointment as Acting Dean the situation has continued to decline and now that you have declared yourself a candidate for the .permanent position I see no reason to believe that the situation will improve in the foreseeable future. It may be a simple matter of politics, but as you know, none of us in Student Affairs were informed about or given the opportunity to comment on the President's decision to fire Mark Smith and appoint you acting Dean of Students until bath actions had alreadY occurred.

Evaluation l.)f all programs, · current or proposed, must proceed from this mission. .rf\.cademic programs will be expected to make a direct educational contribution to this missien by promoting critical thought and at least one of the other tw9 objectives for liberal education. Other programs, ranging from admissions and athletics to placement and public relations, must be evaluated in terms of the extent to which they contribute to the quality of undergraduate liberal education at Union. If the contribution of a pr9gram is indirect, it must be demonstrated that the program does not contradict or detract from Union's pursuit of high quality liberal education, and it must be clearly shown that such a program does, in fact, make the indirect contribution claimed for it. ihe assessment of such programs must take into account the full rang~ of potential impact. Net financial contribution is important, but should not stand by itself as sufficiept justification for a program. Financial data are . often \softer\ than their numerical expression implies, and non-financial costs must not be ignored simply because they cannot be precisely measured or quantitatively expressed. In particular, programs which produce a net financial contribu- tion but have potential diminish- ing the clear-minded pursuit of high quality undergraduate liberal education ought to be regarded with special caution. Wht:m developed from this perspective on the College, a mission statement should stipulate: l. That the mtsston of Union .

Some people hme argued that ~tudents don't tall into the explicit categories of the current system. That within each grade point there is a wide range of unmeasured achievement and that a grading system should be created to measure these differences of achievement. An example of this is that two students in the same class could have respectively an 89 average and an 80 average and still receive the same grade of B. Along these lines, many professors have stated that they find it difficult to make borderline d~cisions, being forced to push students in one direction or another. Thus, possibly not giving the mark that the student actually deserved. In other words, a plus or plus/ minus system might make it more possible to give the student a more accurate evaluation of his or her performance. $\lott .time.

Evaluation of all programs, current or proposed, must proceed from this mission. ~cademic programs will be expected to make a direct educational contribution to this mission by promoting critical thought and at least one of the other two objectives for liberal education. Other programs, ranging from admissions and athletics to placement and public relations, must be evaluated in terms of the extent to which they centribute to the quality of undergraduate liberal education at Union. If the contribution of a pmgram is indirect, it must be demonstrated that the program does not contradict or detract from Union's pursuit of high quality liberal education, and it must be clearly shown that such a program does, in fact, make the indirect contribution claimed for it. The assessment of such programs must take into account the full range of potential impact. ;\let financial contribution 1s important, but should not stand by itself as sufficient justification for a program. Financial data are often \softer\ than their numerical expression implies, and non-financial costs must not be ignored simply because they cannot be precisely measured or ,quantitatively expressed. In particular, programs which produce a net financial contribu- tion but have potential diminish- ing the clear-mincled pursuit of high quality undergraduate liberal education ou,ght to be regarded with special caution. When developed from this perspective on the College, a mission statement should stipulate: I.

I ,.·1 I 'l I Page4 CONCORDJENSIS, january 18, 1978 Forum members hard at work Forum Meets by RANDY FELDMAN On Monday night, January 16, the Student Forummet at ten, o'clock. The first order of business was the unanimous ap·proval of the previous meeting's minutes. The first item discussed was the new Guidelines for Committee Selection which was drawn up and presented by the Committee on Committees. After a few minutes of debate, the proposed guidelines were approved· unanimously. (A copy of these· guidelines appears in this issue of 1 Concordy .) These guideline I changes stemmed from the John Margolis affair. Margolis asked ~hat a synopsis of his requests, as well as a statement by the Forum be published in Concordy along with the new guidelines. After much debate, a statement was written and submitted to Concordy. The statement and guidelines follow in this issue. The next order of business was a proposal by Judy Blan~ of the Student Life Committee that the chairperson of the Orientation Committee be selected by the Committee on Committees. The present system gives the chair- person of the Orientation Committee the authority to select next year's chairperson. The Blank proposal was app'roved. It was then decided that the poll asking if students want a change in the grade point system would be held Thursday, January 26 (see Opinion page). Admissions Process Explained A motion was then made by Brien O'Toole to change the· by- laws of the Student Forum to include a member of the Education and Policy Committee (EPC) on the Forum. This motion was passed by the required two-thirds majority. IJ.y MA~~- NAGORSKY Applications for admission are evaluated via the use of a point system which was first enacted at Union College when considering the Class of 1981. The admissions staff, working out of Old Gym Hall, originally developed the idea of the point system in an effort to protect themselves from criticism by members of the faeulty, administration and other concerned parties. They pf<lposed a system of rigidly defined admission criteria as well as delegation of the decision on some borde\'Jine cases to the admissions committee. The committee, chaired by Professor Joseph Finkelstein and consisting .()f administ61tors, faculty and students, adopted the staffs proposal and began implementing it a year ago. Although the new system is more quantified and objective than the old system, Director of Admissions Jay Shupe does not believe that it altered the makeup of the present freshman class in many ways. Shupe further stated that the real benefit of the new . system will come from the knowledge gained by eval11ation of the progress of students strong in certain areas allowing for revision of the system at a later date. Points are awarded in three general areas: Prior Scholastic · Record, Standardized Test Scores and Personal Evaluation. A maximum of 25 may be accumulated. Up to eleven points are awarded on grounds of previous academic work. A graduate of a public high school who ranks in the top 5% of his or her class is awarded eight points; in tb.e top 1()% -seven points; top 20% - six points; top 30% - four points. etc. If the applicant graduated from a private school, the percentile is halved and points awarded ~ccordingly. Thus, ranking in the top 20% of a . private school earns seven points just as ranking in the top l 0% of · a public school does. In the case where students are not ranked, p1>ints are awarded accordiilg tq the applicants' numerical average. applicant who has attended one· of these sixty schools.ln addition, one point is awarded to an: applicant whose Guidance Counselor submitted an enthusiastic recommendation, · in addition to one point for taking, an advanced or Honors curriculum. the second category is Re- evaluation of Standardized Test· Scores. An applicant's SAT verbal and math scores are combined yielding a total between 400 and 1600. A score of 1400 or better earns ten points while scoring between 1300 and 1400 nets the applicant nine points. A score of 1200 receives seven points, etc. A similar scale is used for evaluating the ACT test which is taken by a small percentage of Union's applicants. The final category considered is the Personal Record in which it is possible to obtain seven points of which only four may be used. One point is awarded if the applicant resides outside the northeastern U.S., while two additional points are given to the son or daughter of an alumnus. A maximum of two points may be awarded as a result of extra-curricular non- athletic endeavors. If the applicant was a leader (Student .Body President, Yearbook Editor, Club Founder, etc.) two points would be received, while those with a participatory role would receive only one point. Lack of participation results in zero points. As with the above case, up to two points ma,y be awarded for athletics, providing the applicant receives the highest rating by a Union coach who feels that the applicant will be an asset to the particular team. Each coach has an unlimited number of highest ratings and may also give lower ratings deserving of one point. An athlete who is not rated by one of . Union's coaches receives no / points in the athletic category. Thus there are twenty.five possible points that an applicant may acquire, In the applicants for ~ the class of 1981, <>lie student - . . . I received twenty-four point$, three ; others had twenty-three, while 1 thirteen had twenty-tw() points. : From all of these only o.ne of the.; The admissions office has ~oJ:tlpiled. a list of sixty second\*ry schools across the c.ountry that are cc>nsiderc;d to be &f a Very high caliber.

Eight applicants with nineteen points, wer(l', ,rejJl~t¢d ·~·~bile-:._ the lowest score - of an accepted candidate was four points. The average point total of the applicants that were accepted was · 15.94 points. To be accepted by the· admissions staff, the applicant must have at least thirteen points. An applicant with less than thirteen points must be reviewed by the Admissions Committee before acceptance may be granted. ihe staff can· reject any applicant having between zero and sixteen points unless the applicant is pursuing a career in medicine (not necessarily applying for the six-year program but anyone who is considered to be pre-med). The staff may reject any pre-med application with up Shupe argues that the correlation between SAT scores and MLA T scores as well as between high school and college grades make this evaluation of the probability. of medical school acceptance possible. There therefore exists at · Union a double standard concerning admissions requirements; one for pre-meds and another for the remainder of the applicant pool. Discussion then centered on the possibility of an increase of student tax. It was decided that this issue would be discussed at the next meeting which. will be held, as usual, on Monday night in room 110 of the Social Sciences building. Student attendance is encouraged. to twenty points. Beyond these figures, sixteen for regular and twenty for pre-med applicants, the committee must be consulted for rejection. There is an upper· limit of 130 pre-med students ~n the entering class in an effort to keep class and laboratory sizes small, and attrition l,'ates low. The schoQl does not want to accept any pre-med student who on the basis of high school achievement does not have a feasible chance of • acceptance into medical school.

The cross-country coach has, let us say, 5 p0ints to distribute this year, and his team is such that Stan will mean the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful season; he decides, therefore, to tac!C 3 of his .points onto Stan's total. The admissions staff may then admit this candidate, since he now has 15 points - and in fact, if it decides to reject him, the staff must return the coach's 3 points, along with a written explanation of its action. Again, by boosting Stan into Union, the coach acknowledges that Stan is a risk; the College, by accepting him, assumes the responsibility for minimizing that risk. II.

At Union, parents of applicants for financiEtl aid are required to submit a .confidential financial statement to. the College ~cholarship Service (CSS), which computes the amount of the annual contribution which can be expected from the family. Union's financial aid office subtracts this figure from the estimated costs at the Coll~ge, arriving .at a figure called the applicant's need. If the applicant is accepted; the aid office attempts to meet that need by means of a \package which normally consists of 3 Should you decide to print it, the hope is that a number of people will wish to exp1·ess views on the proposal itself and j or the issues which it assumes or raises.

Department of Mathematics ., Preamble. If we have learned anything from the debacle of the past 2 years, then whatever it is must include the fact that strong, ambitious people abhor a vacuum as much as nature does. In particular, we have ~~ome aware of how dangerous 1t as to operate an athletic program without a well-denined, widely accepted, an<! strictly enforced athletic policy. What is proposed here is a series of guidelines which, if accepted, would govern the admissi()n and awarding of financial aid to student athletes. As such, it may form P!lrt of an overall policy. The propo:sal which follows is based quite frankly on the assumption that. for a variety of reasons which will not be discussed here, a strong athletic program, vigorously publicized, is in the best interests of the College. Those readers who feel • rejects that philosophy; Union should enter every contest equipped, and expecting to win. Even more radically, those readers should stop here who feel that Union can have a strong inter-collegiate athletic program withcmt vigorous recruiting and, in some cases, specia'l consideration in admissions and financial aid for athletes (which, by the way, does not exclude similar consideration being given to tenors, sculptors or computer science geniuses). There just aren:~t enough, • • Bilr Bradleys to go around · · ..:.ll.' · that is, candidates whose academic credentials are strong~ enough to guarantee admission, whose athletic abilities are strong enough to truly upgrade our programs, and whose fathers are presidents of prosperous banks. Briefly, then, for the benefit of those who are still reading, the operative assumptions are that the College would benefit trom the image of an institution which combines strong athletics with· its- strong scholarship~ and that at least some of the athletes required for this effort will have to be given special consideration in admissions and/ or financial aid. The proposal below would provide explicit rules to govern such special consideration; a postscript discusses some of the responsibilities which the College assumes toward such special candidates when they are enrolled. that Union should stand pat or Proposal. cut back in the area on inter- Although the proposal is collegiate athletics, may as well stop reading here. Similarly, divided into two sections, the· readers who wish to see the basic idea in each is the same: to College strive to win half of its provide coaches with some contests should be advised that ammunition in their recruitment this writer regards such a posture of student-athletes. For as being on a par with being 1 illustrative . purposes, we shall satisfied with a \'C\ in every : carry a hypothetical case through course - and that this writer 1 the proposal.

That assuming that on the average, system runs roughly as follows: candidates would, receive 4 points. each candidate for admission is This does not mean, however, awarded a prescribed number of that. the coach must divide his points for academic credentials- paints evenly - the basketball SAT scores, secondary school coach may use his 12 points as he record, and so forth, and perhaps sees fit; perhaps 3 players with 4 additional points . for non· points, perhaps 2 with 5 each, 1 academic credentials - athletics, w~th 2. Observe also that, if the other activities, geographical average of 4 points is realistic, the distribution, or an alumnus football coach could recruit, on parent. Roughly speaking, the the· average, 6 players per year - admissions staff can accept any after 4 years, he would have candidate with l3 or more points about 24 players who were • (and in. fact cannoT . reject I specially recruited·. That is not candidates w~th 16 or more enough for the entire squad, so wtthout the concurrence of the admissions committee); canda- dates with 12 or fewer points may be rejected by the staff and in any event, cannot be accepted without the approval of the committee. I. Admissions. At the outset, I think that there should be a lower bound beneath which the College should not go in accepting any candidate. To provide a point of departure for discussion, I will propose that no student who scores lower than 7 points on the academic part of the admissions scale should be admitted under any circumstances. That said, this part of the proposal would provide coaches with a collection of points which could be assigned by them to student-athletes which they have recruited. Again, to provide definite figures to argue about, I suggest that points be assigned to the various coaches according to the following table.

In compliance with this drive, the science labs require students to wear a new type of goggles designed to maximize the protection of a student's eyes from damage. Running the department, Professor Scaife contends has been a new experience for him because of the many businesslike decisions he must make. It is his responsibility to maintain the upkeep of appliances and chemicals. In addition to research under- taken at Union, Professor Scaife is also engaged witb other professors in writing the second volume of an introductory .textbook to the Health Sciences. The first volume was completed in 1975. ..~- .

Num~rous reasons in- iluenced him to travel to England. Unlike many other graduate students in his field, Professor Scaife wanted to expand his scientific horizons with further study. The large measure of independence granted at the University of York was the primary factor which convinced Scaife to go to that school. · Guidelines for Selection Since he knew he would be teaching at a small college (such as Union), he felt that one of his primary duties would be to impress upon students the importance of a broad academic and social background. Large colleges ·and universities are often geared toward specialization in one academic area, and Professor Scaife wants to make sure that while students are concentrating in one particular area, they should branch out into other areas. When asked to contract the English and American Systems of Higher Education, Professor Scaife emphasized the wide ideological gulf between the two countries. The English system employs a restrictive educational policy which allows only a small percentage of Great Britain's residents to receive · a college education in an English institution. In other words it is primarily \the cream of the crop.\ Though neither system would be directly operable within the systein of the other country, Professor Scaife feels that Americans can profit from some of the ideas inherent in the English system. He prides himself on his ability to incorporate some At the first Student Forum meeting of the 1977-1978 calendar year, a case was reviewed by the Student Forum. Jon Margolis presented the Student Forum with three proposals as follows: 1. That he he installed as the Chairpersen for tl!.e Copduct Ombudsmen Committee because of inconsistencies which occurcred during the previous year's Com- mittee on Committees selection process. 2. That the Committee oh Committees publish its guidelines for Committee selections m Olncordiensis. 3. That the %campus be informed of the above two proposals. The Forum reviewed proposal number one and decided that Margolis ·should remain a member on the Conduct Om- budsmen Committee and that Committee on Committees was within its jurisdiction to deny him the chairpersonship. P:roposal number two was passed and Committee on Committees presented the following Guidelines to the Student Forum and they were approved by the Student Forum Committee on Committees presented the foflowing Guidelirtes to the Student Forum and they were approved by the Student Forum at their January 16, 1978 meeting. Thus the Committee on Committees Guidelines are as follows: I, Applications and Application Process JoAnne Messina, Chairperson of Committee on Committees · 1. Notice of the opening of the committee application process will be made available ·to the various media outlets on campus for disbursement to the student body at least four (4) days previous to the opening of the p.rocess ... 2. Eleven (11) days ·will be allowed from the opening of the application process to the date when all applications are due. No extensions will be allowed. 3. Applications for committee positions will be available in the Student Activities Office. All applications must be returned to the StHdent Activities Office. No Student Forum member of C.o.C.Jrtember may collect appli- cations. 4. Posted with the applications will be the Committee on Committee's guidelines for committee selection and a summary of each committee's charge. · 5. When filling out the application, applicants must not write their names on the form. The application should bear instead the student's l.D. number. Those applications that bear a name will he discarded. 6. The application forms will be reviewed periodically by the C.o.C., and any changes will be made by the C.o.C. The C.o.C. will also review periodically these guidelines, and make changes where necessary. All changes will be subject to the approval of the Student Forum. 7. In no case will any student be appointed to any committee who has not applied for a committee, or in the case where applications are not necessary has not signed the Vacancy and Ad Hoc Committee list, in the current comm~ttee year. The new committee year is defined as starting when committee 'selec- tions are made public in the spring. II. Committee on Committees Operations I. Using the quality of the written application as its sole criterion, the C.o.C. will narrow down the number of applications to each committee to a workable number for that committee. 2. After the applicant pool has been screened for the first time, and a workable number of · candidates have been selected for the committee positions avail- able, applicants' names will be attached to their applications. 3. Selection for committee positions will then be made based upon information contained in the application, obtained through . interviews, and obtained from / character references. 4. The C.o.C. reserves the right to determine whether or not it will conduct interviews for positions. Ill. Current .. G9m~itte~ Members Appl:yinJH 1 UfOI\: th«!; Same or Different <;ommi4ee l. Committee positions are appointed for one·' (1) fuH committee year, except in the case of appointments to fill vacancies which are for the remainder of the cornrnittee ye~J.r, and appointments to ad hoc committees which are to last until the committee completes its assigned task. 2. Present committee members who wish to serve on, 'the same committee for tlte following year or on a different committee must submit new applications for those positions. 3. Any member of the C.o.C. may reapply for the: C,.p.C. or apply for a differe'P.'t committee. ' •.• : ...

C.o.C. members are to follow the same procedures as outlined for all applicants. IV. Vacancies and Ad Hoc Committee Appointments I. Anyone who applies for a committee and is not selected will have his/her name put on a list of students interested in committee service. 2. Committee vacancies and ad ho<,: committee positions will nm'm~lly be~ filled with students whose· names are on the above list of students. 3. The C.o.C. reserves the right to · req.uire applications for vacancies or new committee positions whenever they deem it advis~ble.

The list of interested students. will be thrown out each spring when the applications be- come available. Those applicants not chosen for committees will be put on the new list. 5. Each fall term, the existence of such a list will be made available to the various media outlets on campus for disbursement to the student body. 6.

An attempt will be made to clear up any questions that someone contemplating pledging may have. Pledging refers to the period of time a person spends after he/she has been accepted by the members of a Greek society up until he/she is inducted into the society. Typically, pledging lasts for three months. In most cases being a pledge is not a large c?mmitment. It involves eating s1x meals per week at the chapter house at a cost of $90 per term. If a student is on a meal plan, the funds will be shifted to the Greek society he/she pledges. Some hous7s ask that pledges pay a fract1on of the house social fee which entitles tbe pledge to all th~ social benefits of a brother or sister. . Contrary to popular beliefs, the purpose of the pledge period is not to administer a torture ritual - at least· ~t Ynion this is not the purpose. It is actually a get- acquainted period. During this tirne, a pledge has the opportunity to get to know all of the active chapter members. Also, the brothers or sisters of a society can become better acquainted with the pledge. If at any time during this period a pledge feels hetshe no longer wants to join the fraternity or sorotity, he/she need do nothing more than co!llmunicate these feelings to a member. Then pledging does not I forcefully lock a persot1 into a Greek society one may depledge at any time. Usually there are no \hard feelings\ toward someone who has depledged, since the members of that particular house realize some of the problems of pledging. They have all gone through it. It is not too late to pledge. This may be done by confiding one's feelings to any brother or sister of the house one wishes to pledge. If the members of the house accept the person, he/she will become a pledge .

He has been called everything from muckraker, to consumer crusader, to public defender. His documented criti- cisms of government and industry have had widespread repercus- sions on public awareness and bureaucratic power. He is, as Time magatine noted, \the U.S.'s toughest customer ... an infinitely dedicated, inex- haustibly persistent crusader whose entire working life is devoted to the causes he champions. Hearing Ralph Nader lecture is an experience unto itself.. Notjust due to his oratory pr.eficiency, but owing more to his obvious sincerity, the listeneF cannot help but be impressed by his facts and figures and motivated by his ideals. ·Page9 The crusading attorney who first made hcadlin~s in 1965 with lu~ book lins!lfe at Any Speed, the scathing indictment that lambasted the auto industry for producing unsafe vehicles, has been responsible for at least six majar federal consumer protec- tion laws. He has made countless advances in the areas of safety, sanitation, pollution control, advertising, credibility and politics and economic power. The N~w York Times said of him \What sets Nader apart is that he has moved beyond social criticism to effective politi<;al action.\ Nader wiiJ appear in Memnrial Chapel at 8:30 p.m. on Monday.

Union Student Scolded By Escaping Steam Union Gets All Steamed Up Nader graduated Magna Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa· from Princeton University in 1955 and rec-eived his law degree from Harvard in 1958. He first became interested in automotive safety while an undergraduate and be wrote several articles for the Harvard Law Sch(lol newspaper, one of which was later expanded on to form the basis for his book. Working in his modest, one-room Washington office for sometimes sixteen or twenty hours a day, often seven days a week, Nader is by JIM DAVIS Whenever the heat's on, J. Richard Mills, director of physical plant operations at Union, gets steamed up. And so do some of the pipes that heat buildings on campus. Since last October, steam has been rising from an underground manhole between the Nott Memorial and Schaffer Library. These geysers are caused by the leakage of moisture in the soil onto the underground steam distribution pipes. College buildings are heated by steam that is produced by two oil- fired steam boilers. The steam is then carried thro1;1gh under- ground pipes, that r-urt for about a-mile-and-a-half-. to the buildings. 1 In the radiators, the steam is converted into water. This conversion produces heat. The water is then carried back in another pipe to the steam boilers in the college's central utilities plant, near the computer center. The pipes run alongside each other and are encased by a tile sleeve. The sleeve is designed to protect the pipes from eutside moisture. But the tile between the library and the Nott Memorial has developed leaks that allow ground moisture to come in contact with the pipes. And when water touches the pipe that is carrying steam 1 at about 250 degrees, it turns into steam. \But portions of the system do fail,\ he said. \So we have a continuing_ replacement program for the pipes. The last section was replaced last summer.\ Mr. Mills is sorry that leaking section of tile that is causing the formation of steam didn't fail sooner. \Had the problem become apparent a little bi.t earlier, we could have repaired it,\ he said. For most members of the Union community the escaping steam is merely an interesting spectacle. But for' the' emph>y~es of the campus · stor.e in N@tt Memorial and ·its manager. Holley D.

This condition was most severe after one weekend during fall term vacation. \The wind must have blown a lot of steam in,\ Mr. Greene said. \We had to close the store for four hours while the machines were dried out.\ During the week, while the store is open, no such steam build-up occurs. That's because people are constantly walking in and out of the store, opening the doors. and letting the colder air from the outside in. ..The steam that comes into the stockroom is drawn out into the colder air,\ Mr. Greene said ... lt's like what happens when someone takes a shower. When he opens the door. the steam escapes into the colder air.\ Usually, the stockroom door leading outside is kept closed. and the amount of steam that enters the stockroom is kept to a minimum. But on January 3, this door had to be kept open to receive deliveries of books for winter term courses. \To draw the steam out, we had a fan blowing the steam that entered the open door into the bookstore,\ Mr. Greene said. \We also kept the front doors to the bookstore open so that the steam would be attracted into the cold air outside. A lot of students wondered why we kept the doors open on such a cold day. They might haVe gotten chilled; but the steam was drawn out.\ This year's steam build-up may cause Mr. Greene and the patrons and employees of the campus store to become heated up, but it's by no means unprecedented . \Some portion of the tile for the steam distribution pipes leaks just about every year,\ Mr. Mills said. \The section between the library and the Nott Memorial just happened to be the point at which it decided to leak this year.\ On Tuesday, Jan. 24 at 12:30 p.m. in the Women's Center (2nd floor Carnegie, opposit~ WRUC) elections for 2 student representatives to the PRES- IDENT'S COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN will be held.

The sum is the third grant that tlie research group has received from United Way and will support the research of two students: Marilee Jones, a graduate student of BiolQgy, and Edward Boucheron, a Mechanical Engineering major. The research, directed by J. Richard Shanebrook, chairman of the Department ef Mechanical Engineering, is aimed at developing an artificial valve that will reproduce the flow of blood created by the natun~l valve. That is hoped to be accomplished by the incorporation of a \hemofoil. valve; a valve design developed at Union with decided advantages over other artificial valves. Long range goals of the research are the development of a left ventricular assist device (a device which would be implanted in order to help a failing heart), and the development of an artificial heart. ~-Eats and Honky Tonks-- Jloucheron's werk involves not only the development of the artificial valve itself but also the task of refining a cardiac simulator used to measure the art:ificia1 valve's mechanical efficiency. Marilee Jones is planning the procedures for the implantation of the artificial valve in an animal for testing. · Other Union students involved in the research are Steven Epstein, a senior interdepartmental major; Timothy Wiita, a senior Mechanical Engineering major; and Cynthia Bruso, also a senior Mechanical Engineering major. by ED CLOOS III transformation is complete.

Thus far, the response to the statement has been fairly good, although there has been little on the part of the~ students.

Larzer Ziff, a scholar o( American cultural history, has assumed the Washington Irving Chair of Modern Literary and Historical Studies' at Union College for the winter term. Ziff has been University Lecturer in American Literature at Oxford University and a Fellow of Exeter College since 1973. Previously, he had been professor of English and chairman of graduate studies in English at the University of California at Berkeley, where he began teaching in 1956. The recipient of a number of fellowships. including ~a. Guggenheim and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Ziff has lectured widely at universities in the U.S. and in Europe. He has been visiting professor at the University of Paris-Vincennes, University of Copenhagen, and University of Warsaw. His book The American 1890s won the Christian Gauss Award after its publication in 1966. Puritanism in America, published in 1973, was nominated for the National Book Award and was hailed by the W.as\ington Star as \surely one of the most insightful and enlightening books on American culture ever written.\ Ziff also is author of The Career of John Cotton: Puritanism and the American Experience. Ziffs inquiry into American cultural history continues in his work-in-progress on the relation of literature to society in America in the decades prior to the Civil War. As Washington Irving Professor, Ziff is teaching two courses on American literature at Union. On Jan. 12, he also delivered the Washington Irving Lecture, on the subject of the \American Literature and the , National Identity: The Literary Traveler Abroad.\ His lecture e.x,amined th~ .ways in which m;tjor literary,-Jigures of the 19th century arr1:.qed · at a sense of · Arrierlcan identity during their ~travels in Eurbpe.

Marked by six.ty minutes of hard hitting hockey, the g;une saw the Dutchmen, except for occasional lapses due to failure in clearing the puck fn;>m the defensive end, play their opponents dead even. Prior to the opening face-off, it was clear that Schenectady had virtually forgotten Union l:lockey as the majority of the season ticket holders' seats were unoccupied. The anti•hockey rooters\ although present in small numbers. were more subdued. On the other hand, students backing the new varsity quickly made themselves apparent by producing a roar 11pon the appearance of the Garnet on ice. Union proved early that this contest would be no pushover. In the first minute, winger Bob Knibb skated in on .goal alone, only to shoot the puck over the net. This was only the beginning of end-to-end action which lasted for the first seven plus minutes until the Dutchmen rec.eived a tripping penalty at 7:28. Down a man, Union stayed in their defensive box but failed to clear the puck. This resulted in a powerplay goal by Buffalo's Frank Anzalone-the first of his three,..at 8:10. · An emotional letdown at this point resulted in a second Buffalo tally at 8:41. The Dutchmen then returned to their strong play for the remainder of the period, getting ma·rvelous goaltending from Dave Schmertz and stalwart defensive play from Ben Lasher and Robert Murray. A wrist shot from just outside the circle by Knibb in the closing minute needed an acrobatic save to keep Union off the scoreboard. The second stanza was more evenly played than the first. Buffalo scored twice, raising their lead to 4-0 before the first Garnet tally. The period was marked by a number of outstanding efforts. First, Kevin Moore and Randy Clark did a magnificent job of penalty killing .early in the period. Lasher was ubiquitous, not only Unidentified UColl skater aimsgoalward vs. Buffalo because he was on ice all the time but because he was playing superbly.

Women's Hoo~ Track 0 en Two Buffalo penalties 54 seconds apart paved the way for the Dutchmen's first tally. The penalties, for tripping and charging, gave the Dutchmen a two man advantage for over a minute. During this time, Mark Taube came close on a shot from straight on and then flicked the rebound high. Finally, after Buffalo controlled and killed off the iirst penalty, GJidden sent the puck into the corner where Kevin Moore made the play by digging it out and sending it to Ben Lasher at the left point. Lasher let fly with a bullet which sailed over the goalie's left shoulder for a powerplay goal. Buffalo scored four goals in the slow moving final period, as they too were weary. The score rose to 8-2 but the Garnet still refused to die. Once again, last minute heroics resulted in Union's third goal and almost a fourth in the waning seconds. \ .. ; . :;\~~ Later, wh~ri,:!}Jnion was.·. on another power p1ay, Buffalo lkoke out on a two on zero break. Only Schmertz stood between the attackers and Buffalo's fifth goal. A sprawling arm save sent the Garnet to the locker room down but not out. The goal was a result of a sprint down ice by Taube with the rubber disc moving to the corner. laube snapped the puck in front and Bob Knibb rammed 11 home at 19:34. The near miss occurred seconds later when Glidden failed to convert a backhander from in front which left him frustrated for the evening. having found himself and the puck within shooting distance numerous times during the game. Actually, the final of g_J simply :does not show how well Union performed.

The streak started with a relatively easy victory over the Met:chant Marines of Kings' Point. This game, which Union dominated from start to finish·, saw junior Greg Soboscinski con- nect on his first nine shots in a row.

Bob Moffat displayed a ~- f the qualities that were made· ous by the television star of similar narne at the Dartmouth Invita- tional this past weekend. To start off, Bob won h.is heat in the 400 meter race. Later he finished fifth overall in the 400, yet his time of 49.4 seconds set a new school record m that event. He then participated in the 500 meter run 1n the open division, which includes the top-notch runners of the Invitational. The first two runners finished with official times of I :03 and I :03, a world record for the event. To the naked eye it seemed to be a dead heat. Eventually a photograph of the finish determined that Doral Wattley of the Gazelles Track Club had out-lunged Kevin Price of Adelphi by an almost insignificant amount for the world record. Bob finished an incredible two-tenths of a second behind them (I :03:2) -just two- tenths of a second off the new , world record time. At practice this week Bob seemC;:d almost, but not quite, as excited as his coach, Chuck James, about his performance - Eob just seemed to take it in stride. Co-captain K.evin Scheuer also went to the Invitational and did extremely well. In the 1000 meter event, he ran in the open division and, although placing sixth at 2:28:9, finished very close to the winning time of 2:24:6. In the 800 meter event, he was runner-up in the medal division (considered a step under the open division) with a time of 1:54:8. Matt Blum represented Union . iP the 55-~a.-d hurdles.

Though Coach James was very pleased With the results from Dartmouth, he was disappointed that the team could not make it to the Cornell Invitational because of the bad weather. He wanted to use the meet to see how the freshmen and sophomores per- formed in actual meets, and also as a needed and valuable experience for them. Nevertheless, the Dutchmen must now prepare for their first meet. It wili be against Hamilton, Middlebury and Williams, this Friday at 7:00 p.m. in the Memorial Fieldhouse . They continue to train at their steady and hard pace, improving With each day. One example of the rigorous training is Earl Chilton, who m last week's article was mistakenly left out. Earl competes in the difficult triple jump for Union, and 1s now working especially hard in order to overcome a bothersome leg injury. Coach James feels the team is ready for Friday's meet and has most of the event lineup set. However, this is still tentative because James is concerned with a small outbreak of flu on campus; Therefore, if you think yolt have the flu, don't cough or sneeze in their presence and avoid close contact with any of the members of the team. This will make Coach James very happy and you and the rest of the school will benefit from being able tc watch an exciting and heafthy Union team on Friday. Behind Sobosdn-ski, tbe Dutchmen cruised to an easy 68- 58 victory. Saturday night, the Union hoopers travelled to Plattsburg to participate in the annual Plattsburg Winter Tournament. The first round slated Union against Lyndon State of Vermont. Lyndon State, -led by hot-shot Greg Sutton .proved .no match for the much · quicker Unior. Dutchmen. The game started slowly, as both teams appeared to be \feeling each other out;\ then the Union cagers broke loose. Strong rebounding by senior Mike Smith enabled Union to unleash a devastating fa~t-break offense which resulted in numerous easy lay-ups. Because of this faster style of play, Union opened up a large 44- 25 lead late in the first half. M<>reov~r, not only had Lyndon State been outscored, they had been physically run into the ground.

Joe Cardney, despite a poor night from the field, drove to the hoop several times causing much confusion amongst the Lyndon State defense. CardD.ey finished with 8 points, well below his average. High scorer for the Dutchmen was Smith as he tallied 23 points and more importantly, 18 rebounds. . Benind Smith was Soboscinski with 14 points. Final score - Union 92,. Lyndon 75.

Volume No. 107, No. 12 Janu~ry 25, 1978 II Ralph Nader Speaks by MARK Li.EBERFARB and W. PETER PEARRE On January 23, consumer advocate Ralph Nader addressed a near capacity crowd in Memorial ChapeL Nader has been instrumental in the formation of public interest groups, the elimination of Red Dye # 2, the recall of over forty- four million automobiles by General Motors in the past decade, and is recognized as the founder of \Nader's Raiders\ among other things. His book Unsaff! at Any Spf!ed, first brought his consumer advocacy crusade into public view. Today, Nader is deeply involved in many important and vital issues, such as the debate over solar or nuclear energy. In his speech, he touched on many of these p.oints. Nader believes that our society is controlled and manipulated by corporate monoliths due to .the · fact that the American people are ignerant of and refuse to exercise their constitutional rights. He particularly emphasized the important role that we as students must play in solving these pmblems. Nader listed eleven of what he considers to be the most serious domestic problems in the United States. They· are: (1) poverty; (2) inflation; (3) inadequate housing; ( 4) quality and ,availabilit¥ .of .health. care; (5} mass transit; (6) corporate fraud; (7) government corruption; (8). poor tax structure; (9) pollution; (10) work place hazard; and (ll) low quality of education. particularly, at the elementary school level. The issue of corporate corruption figured prominently in M r . N a d e r' s delivery, Corporations, he said, are controlling many facets of our life an<! government. Their lobbies · are so powerful that they are often able to impose their will upon Congress. Many corporations are so immense that they have astromonical yearly budgets. For example, Exxon's budget last year surpassed the national budget of Brazil. Nader illustrated the tremendous overall power of corporations in a rather stark, revealing way in his statement that General Motors controls the air we breathe. people unfortunately tenJ to be either ignorant or apathetic about I these issues. We are pre- programmed and often told what · to believe by our government and mass media which is usually controlled by major corporations (the three major television and radio networks being a prime example). People tend to base their opir ,ons on what they are told by Walter Cronkite, Howard K. Smith, and Eric Severeid instead of on their C'lWn analysis. If we are to rectify the problems our nation faces we must first recognize that their existence is wrong since if one has no sense of what is right or wrong it is impossible to ask questions. In universities and colleges, are often confronted with apathetic masses, Nader feels. He illustrated this point by pointing out that in Schenectady,. General The quality of education was also central in Mr. Nader's .speech. Education, he feels, is rapidly declining in quality. Many of our coHege graduates are not proficient in the written and spoken word. Furthermore, the emphasis in higher education is often placed on reaching graduate or professional schools, and not on receiving a solid education. In other words, science students often have little or no exposure to the liberal arts and vice versa. Nader traces this problem all the way back to our elementary school system. Children at this level are at an impressionable age Continued on Page 7 d U · Trustees COiiVene when the base for future The January meeting of Union education should be formed.

Timberlake, who had served as Treasurer of the college as well as Comptroller. Plans were finalized as to the makeup and direction of the Review Committee. The committee consists of four off- .campus members: George Hazzard, President of W.P.l.; Robert Wood, a former President of the University of Massachusetts; J.L. Swingle, past President of the Association of Governing Boards; and David Robinson, Vice~President of the Carnegie Corporation. This Review Committee was charged ''to assist the Board of Trustees of Union College in charting a course that would be most effective for the future of Union Co !lege, both in the short and lon.g range. To the extent necessary, the performance of the Trustees, the President, the Administration, the Faculty, and the Students should be reviewed.\ Forum Pushes For Calendar Change This appears to be a major switch from the originally implied intent of the committee - namely a presidential review. At the meeting of the Department Chairmen on Monday past, the intent of the charge was made clear (before formal acceptance by the trustees on Wednesday.) Faculty Trustee Kenneth Schick, apparently :;;urprised by the fact that the charge calls for .a campus rather- than _ presidential review, suggested at the Chairmen's meeting that this was not the original charge tentatively accepted by the trustees in December. Sometime during the last month the intent of the review has been altered; at this writing, Concordiensis has not yet been able to ascertain why or by whom. The Review Committee will be on campus Thursday and Friday although plans for a ret urn visit have not been finalized. It is hoped that all concerned parties will be able to have an input to this review. The report of this committee is expected io be completed by the April meeting of the Board. by MURRAY LEVISON The Student Forum met Monday night for its weekly meeting.

The second item on the agenda concerned the sending of Concordiensi!l to those students on terms abroad. It would cost about $25 per term for two or three issues to be mailed every two weeks. The Tax Committee Chairman stated that he would see to it that this expense will be added to Concordy's budget. The next item concerned a proposed inc~ease in the Student Activity fee and.the submission of budgets, both brought by the Tax Committee. Stan Geberer, Chairman of the Tax Committee reported that the suggestion to raise the Student Tax by $25 year will really amount to nothing. At one time there was $50,000 in a reserve fund; now there is $1,000. · Because of overspending that occurred the last three years, . there will be a deficit budget next year. The school will pick up the 1 tab over the ,summer, but will bill the Tax Committee in September.

' ' ' ~ CONCORDIENSIS, January 25J 1978 Correction · Editor, C01uordiensis: ~The lead editorial in the last Coneordiensis mistakenly , ,identified me as the propo11ent in the AU-College Senate of a plan to begin the fall tenn at an earlier date. The trutb is that I have never consciously considered such an alteration in the calendar. and I have yet to attend a meeting of the All- College Senate. Being, by inference, criticized for a plan that I did not offer is a little like suffering a hangover on the-morning-after without ·· · taken a drink the,..llight- before. Actu.ally, my own pre· ·f<;rence would be to begin the year Jater and end it earliel'. Constructively yours, Joseph B. Uoard Robert P.

Review Who E-ditors, Con~ordy: ·Official word has just reached me that the hng awaited ·~presidential review\ has been mysteriously .transformed into a \college nwiew~' which will commence tomorrow. This news will no doubt be greeted with jubilation at the Presidential Palace~ bl.lt it should be clearly understood as a defeat for ' Union College as an educational community. Presidential review was to have been the means of resolving Union's year·e>ld leadership crisis in an orderly, reasonably objective, anct fair· tnanner fQr aU concerned. By contrast, a review of the college as a whole implicitly follows from President Bonner's now familiar line that the root of all his problems at Union has been the governance system which hampered him from carrying out his \mission.\ In short, presidential review is to college review what, for a faculty member, ~·tenure review\ would be to an attempt to revise the tenure rules to accommodate his or her particular candidacy. ·There is a word for this- self~ serving. Half-mast the flag;. an idea Whose time had almost cotne at Union is dead. Robert Sbarl~t Political Science Evaluation begun a process of finmense significance, the review of President Thomas Bonner's performance in office. This review may turn out to be a sham - or it may be intended to be and become a serious. penetrating evalU:ation of the effectiveness and ·credibility of the top leadership of the college. In any event, it is essential to the welfare of the institution that all members of the college community follow this review with deep interest, that they inform themselves as to whether it employs the kfnds flnd scope of inquiry and offers the kinds of assurances to ·· witnesses (including indemnification) that would · · signal the earnest evaluation that the college and its <:onstituents . have been promised and deserve. I will be particularly interested to learn, of course, whether the evaluation team 'intends to pursue the numerous and clear facts on which my letter of September 30 was based. As many of my former administrative colleagues, the student trustees, the former news editors of Concordiensis~ and others know, this indispensible information is readily available, under appropriate assurances. We shall see; And what we see will have much to say about the future of Union College and its chances of regaining its dignity and' well- being. One thing seems clear even now: If it doesn't get better, .it wi!~ get worse. · · Sincerely, Mark W. Smith Landmark Editor, Con~ordiensis: It is time not only to think seriously, but to take direct action in saving the Nott Memorial. The fact that well over $1 million is required. to repair the building need not be quite the harrier it seems. Since the search for a large~ scale donor has not yet been successful, it would be wise to begin raising some of the necessary funds right here. ideas: a \Save the Nott\ campaign including paper drives, car wa&hes, bake sales, record and book sales. special Mountebanks performances and cabaret nights. concerts. dances, etc.; a contest between floors, fraternities and sororities and also between faculty departments to see whii::h can raise the most money for the Nott; smaU- scale aliimni donations; approaching area businesses amount. a large-scale dollQr would have to supply. Equally important, such efforts would show others that the Union community cares about..,.their N o;t Memorial enough not to depend entirely on · 'help. The whole cam.pul! community might lend support to the Campus Planning Board in its efforts to save the Nott. How unfortunate that it is not unthinkable that Union, involved with its sports image, might not spare the necessary effort to preserve somethin1! lasting value ~ not ·union's own, but a po,tetlt!J(i~) national landmark.

It is up to the July. In fact, the original .deadline committee to suggest a balanced for the budget review was set for budget consistent with r¢source sometime during the fall. With limitations and with the prior,ities the failure to meet that deadline, of the school. This reflects, there should new be a certain obviously, the definition of the element of concern since there is a committee, as planners and as definite need for some lead time ordere.rs of priority for the school. to effectively carry out the various school. specifications in the budget. In the past few years the Prof. Kenney- Chairman P&P responsibility center heads arid a<!vising the administration on the matter of budget. This process of review, which began earlier this month, should last roughly until mid-Febunuy, at which point the committee will submit a written statement of advice to the admin•istratioil, or more specifically to the Cabinet. The Cabinet, after revising the budget, will again subj.ect it to committee examination, Finally, the budget will be submitted to the Board of Trustees, probably in April. The function of the Plal).ning and Priorities Committee is ·to evaluate the relative ·importance Qf the .different components of the school in terms ef their budget requests and to reflect this in their advice on the budget. There is a wide range of budget considerations ranging from new courses and other academic advances, to improvements in the physical plant of the school. The committee must order a wide range of tequests. It must evaluate the individual expenditJJre requests and then determine the varying degrees of importance of each. In this sense, the world ••priorities\ · is well committee's advice has had a great deal of influence on the ultimate budget, and has been taken very seriously by the administration. Nonetheless, the extent to which the advice is hec;:ded in this or in any year does ultimately lie with the administration. WRUC Perpetrated An aspect of the budget procedure which is very iJD.portant is timing. The decisions of budget and · fund alloeation need a certain amount of lead time.

Similarly, ·maintenance projects, which can only be undertaken . during certain times of the year by DAN ROSENBAUM At 12:45 a.m. last Wednesday morning, Jan. 18, three men attempted to take over the WRUC studios. on the second floor of Carnegie Hall. The trio, dressed in army fatigue jackets and burlap sacks to cover their heads, appeared in the station lounge, and announced, in British accents, ••we are taking over the radio .station.\ According to Peter Raymond, newly appointed Music Director and DJ on duty, they were unarmed except for a loaded H 2 0 fire extinguisher. They stated they wanted to say something over the air. Raymond, who until this time thought the whole operation was a prank, refused, at which point one of the three began to struggle with him. When the DJ broke free, two of them retired into the hall outside the studios to ••talk it ov.er.\ The remammg intruder commented that Raymond had ••good taste in music, but I don't have time for it.;' At that point, he reached over, and turned the turntable from 33 rpm to 78 to speed up the four minute cut Raymond was playing at the time. Raymond and the intruder moved the speed back and forth a few times. when the two began to wrestle. During the struggle, the Mixing Board was knocked off its table broadcasting was discontinued. The intruder then ran out of the station. The two who had left earlier never re- appeared. The whole incident took Jess than 20 minutes. Zeta Beta Tau Rechartered Two of the hats worn by the would-be pirates were recovered outside the studios. They were genuine Navy surplus watch caps. No cJue to their identity .has yet been found. The Schenectady police were called in to the case immediately be Security. Security responded to Raymond's call ·within thirty seconds but could not locate the perpetrators in the building. Zeta Beta Tau, the third largest collegiate frat~rnal organization in the United States, has officially reactivated a chapter at Union College. The rechartering ceremony for Union's Chapter of Zeta Beta Tau was held at Hale House on January 17, In addition to the brothers of ZBT at U nlon, and the brothers from other chapters of ZBT, noted members of the college's administration, including President Thomas N. Bonner, Provost C. William Huntley and the Acting Dean of Students Rudy V. Nydegger Were present. Zeta Beta Tau first appeared at Union in 1914 but closed down in 1927. Two other fraternities, however, Kappa Nu (later Phi Epsilon Pi) cmd Phi Sigma Delta (both were absorbed into the Zeta Beta Organization by 1970) were also organized in 1914 and eventually became the leading fraternal organization on campus before their demise in the late 1960's. The tWo fraternities' incredible power in fraternal activities Was demonstrated in the Brown Cup competition. From 1950, when the Brown Cup was conceived, to the years 1968-1969 when both frats simultaneously collapsed, the two fraternities won a combined total of thirteen Brown Cups. The recreation of a new Zeta Beta Tau chapter at Union began early last year when three freshmen, John Levin-Epstein, Victor Gittlrman and Dave Swenken decided to create a fraternity that would be responsive to their own ideals and needs. They wanted to build a frater:nity based on a closely knit brotherhood th.at, while emphasizing communal responsibility, encouraged each brother to realize his potential as an individiual and to develop his organization. This relationship eventually led to the support and aid of the parent organization for a new chapter here at Union. With the election of Cbris McCarthy as president this year, Union's Chapter of Zeta Beta Tau entered a new phase of development. As president, Chris McCarthy demonstrated his exceptional organizational talents and unusual lead.ership abilities. He was able to secure living accomodations, eating facilities, and furnishings for the fraternity, while proving a critical factor in the financing of Union's chapter. When asked about his achievements as president, Chris discussed the enthusiastic participation of the fraternity brothers in the creation of ZBT and above aH emphasized the importance ofSt~ve RiChards' help to the fraternity. Richards, the president of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity; constantly advised and aided the ZBT pledge!! (as they were officially called before their rechartering} in their efforts to create a fraternity. Without his ' j own personal interests. With the help of the school's administration John, Victor and David were able to establish a firm .• .r¢1a.t'i<ii\Sbiri·. :-,WiHt; .t.l\e• • ~ \ national Zeta . Beta Tau, help, Chris felt that it would have been virtually impossible to have established ZBT on campus as succe~sfully as the brothers have done. In addition to his other contributions, Chris has also been according to one brother, \an unbelievable leader\ as he has combined a large number of pledges with widely diversified interests into a cohesive brotherhood. The culmination of the efforts of · ZBT's pledges occurred January 17, 1978. They were officially accepted into the National Zeta Beta Tau fraternal organization in a secret ceremony at the ZBT chapter house, and then honored at a formal dinner at Hale House. The secret ceremony was held in the early evening in the company ·of only •the ZBT brothers at Union and an initiation team comprised of ZBT brothers from chapters at NeW England College, Syracuse U n i v er s i t y a n d • C o r n e II University. Speeches were given by the president of Union, Thomas N. Bonner; Thomas Amato, the President of the Pan Hellenic Council; Mr. James Green, Executive Director of the national fraternal organization; and Chris McCarthy, the current president of the Zeta Beta Tau Station Manager, Dave Marker, says the station was off the air for about 10 hours.

The budgeting process for '77-'78 is finally complete (an itemized report coming soon) and preparations for next year's funding already underway. Applications for positions on the Audit (Tax.) Committee for the year '78-'79 will be made available in Student Activities office in a few weeks (keep following Concordy for more infa.). These positions are vital to the smooth operation of Student Activities and dedicated people are needed. There will be three openings on the Committee which must be filled by April I, 1978. Other positions will be filled by the incoming Chairman and the newly elected Secretary in the spring. The coming few years will be particularly challenging for the new committee, but also uniquely rewarding. With the current fiscal situation the Tax Committee, as well as Student Activities, will find .the availability of new funds for new equipment and programming restrictingly low. Because of lack of foresight, the stud~nt tax fund barely has enough money .this year.to fund the over 42 student clubs and organizations not to mention newly formed dubs and those who receive no funding due to their organizational status. Relief is coming soon~ This past Monday - the · Student Forum voted to propose a substantial increase in the yearly activity fee to·· cover impending costs and reestablish the Student Tax Contingency Fund which has been wiped out over the past three years. To be more specific, the proposed increase, would raise the activity fee from $25 a term to $50 a term. In all this represents a $150,000 annual increase to take place over the coming two to three years. The annual Student Funds would then total $300,000 which is sorely needed. Initially $50,000 will be set aside to replenish the ailing contingency fund. Next, monies will be granted for new projects such as, a weekly speaker, forum lecture series, the expansion of WR UC to 10,000 watts, or contracting professional artists, directors, theater companies, and mus1c1alis through Mountebanks. Finally, d'ue to lack of new funds, Student Activities has been unable to keep up with rising costs where on the average prices have gone up between 35-40 percent and in $Xtreme cases have risen as mucq as 150 percent. These new funds will then enable Student Activities to maintain and upgrade, in some cases, the present quality of programming without taking austerity measures. Also, the date for new budget requests for 1978- '79 will be no later than March 10, 1978 so that funding for next year can begin promptly upon returning from !ipring break. ·

CONCORDIENSIS, January 25, 1978 P & P Reviews Budgets by DOUG BURNS The Planning and Priorities Committee is reviewing budget requests for the 1978-79 year. The commit:tee is charged with the responsibility of assessing the requests, discussing them with the responsibility center heads and suited to the committee. The extent of the Planning and. Priorities Committee's influence insofar as the budget is concerned should be understood. On the one hand, it is the administration that must present a balanced budget to the trustees. The Cabinet, though, in the course of preparing the budget, seeks the counsel of the committee. lt is up to the committee to suggest a balanced budget consistent with resource limitations and with the priorities of the school. This reflects, obviously, the definition of the committee, as planners and as orderers of priority for the school. school. due to climatic limitations, are also contingent on a knowledge of available funds. In short, there cannot be too much time lag in the oudget prepar-ation, as it can upset necessary programs and courses of action. In this sense, the budget should be completed fairly soon since it covers the fiscal year beginning in July. In fact, the original deadline for the budget review was set for sometime during the faiL With the failure to meet that deadline, there should now be a certain element of concern since there is a definite need for some lead time to effectively carry out the various specifications in the budget. Prof Kenney - Chairman P&P advising the administration on the matter of budget. This process of review, which began earlier this month, should last rol:lg)lly until mid-feburary, at which point the committee will submit a written statement of advice to the administration, or more specifically to the Cabinet. The Cabinet, after revising the budget, will again subject it to committee examination. Finally, the budget will be submitted to the Board of Trustees, probably in April. The function of the Planning and Priorities Committee is to evaluate the relative importance of the different components of the school in terms of their budget requests and to reflect this in their advice on the budget. There is a wide range of budget considerations ranging from new courses and other academic advances, to improvements in the physical plant of the school. The committee must order a wide range of requests. It must evaluate the individual expenditure requests and then determine the varying degrees of importance of each. In this sense, the world \priorities\ · is well In the past few years the committee's advice has had a great deal of influence on the ultimate budget, and has been taken very seriously by the administration. Nonetheless, the extent to which the advice is heeded in this or in any year does ultimately lie with the administration. WRUC Perpetrated speed up the four minute cut Raymond was playing at the time. Raymond and the intruder moved the speed back and forth a few times. when the two began to wrestle. During the struggle, the Mixing Board was knocked off its table broadcasting was discontinued. The intruder then ran out of the station. The two who had left earlier never re- appeared. The whole incident took less than 20 minutes. An aspect of the budget procedure which is very important is timing. The decisions of budget and fund allocation need a certain amount of lead time. Financial aid decisions, which involve the designation of funds, cannot be properly made without a knowledge of exactly how much money is availab~e. Similarly, maintenance projects, which can only be undertaken during certain times of the year by DAN ROSENBAUM At 12:45 a.m. last Wednesday morning, Jan. 18, three men attempted to take over the WRUC studios, on the second floor of Carnegie Hall. The trio, dressed in army fatigue jackets and burlap sacks to cover their heads, appeared in the station lounge, and announced, in British accents, \We are taking over the radio station.\ According to Peter Raymond, newly appointed Music Director and DJ on duty, they were unarmed except for a loaded H 2 0 fire extinguisher. They stated they wanted to say something over the air. Raymond, who until this time thought the whole operation was a prank, refused, at which point one of the three began to struggle with him. When the DJ broke free, two of them retired into the hall outside the studios to \talk it over.\ The remammg intruder commented that Raymond had \good taste in music, but I don't have time for it.\ At that point, he reached over, and turned the turntable from 33 rpm to 78 to Zeta Beta Tau Rechartered Two of the hats worn by the would-be pirates were recovered outside the studios. They were genuine Navy surplus watch caps. No clue to their identity has yet been found. The Schenectady police were called in to the case immediately be Security. Security responded to Raymond's call ·within thirty seconds but could not locate the perpetrators in the Zeta Beta Tau, the third largest collegiate fraternal organization in the United States, has officially reactivated a chapter at Union College. The rechartering ceremony for Union's Chapter of Zeta Beta Tau was held at Hale House on January 17. In addition to the brothers of ZBT at Union, and the brothers from other chapters of ZBT, noted members of the college's administration, including President Thomas N. Bonner, Provost C. William Huntley and the Acting Dean of Students Rudy V. Nydegger were present. Zeta Beta Tau first appeared at Union in 1914 but closed down in 1927. Two other fraternities, however, Kappa Nu (later Phi Epsilon Pi) and Phi Sigma Delta (both were absorbed into the Zeta Beta Organization by 1970) were also organized in 1914 and eventually became the leading fraternal organization on campus before their demise in the late 1960's. The two fraternities' incredible power in fraternal activities was demonstrated in the Brown Cup competition. From 1950, when the Brown Cup was conceived, to the years 1968-1969 when both frats simultaneously collapsed, the two fraternities won a combined total of thirteen Brown Cups. The recreation of a new Zeta Beta Tau chapter at Union began early last year when three freshmen, John Levin-Epstein, Victor Gittlrman and Dave Swenken decided to create a fraternity that would be responsive to their own ideals and needs. They wanted to build a fraternity based on a closely knit brotherhood that, while emphasizing communal responsibility, encouraged each brother to realize his potential as an individilial and to develop his own personal interests. With the organization. fhis relationship eventually led to the support and aid of the parent organization for a new chapter here at Union. With the election of Chris McCarthy as president this year, Union's Chapter of Zeta Beta Tau entered a new phase of development. As president, Chris McCarthy demonstrated his exceptional organizational talents and unusual leadership abilities. He was able to secure living accomodations, eating facilities, and furnishings for the fraternity, while proving a critical factor in the financing of Union's chapter. When asked about his achievements as president, Chris discussed the enthusiastic participation of the fraternity brothers in the creation of ZBT and above all emphasized the importance of Steve Richards' help to the fraternity. Richards, the president of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, constantly advised and aided the ZBT pledges (as they were officially called before their rechartering) in their efforts to create a fraternity. Without his he 1-p of t h e s c h o o I' s administration John, Victor and David were able to establish a firm , ,rcla.tionsltip • ,wi.tl.:t •• ~h,e, , .. national Zeta Beta Tau help, Chris felt that it would have been virtiully impossible to have established ZBT on campus as succe~sfully as the brothers have done. 1 n addition to his other contributions, Chris has also been according to one brother, \an unbelievable leader\ as he has combined a large number of pledges with widely diversified interests into a cohesive brotherhood. The culmination of the efforts of ZBT's pledges occurred January I 7, 1978. They were officially accepted into the National Zeta Beta Tau fraternal organization in a secret ceremony at the ZBT chapter house, and then honored at a formal dinner at Hale House. The secret ceremony was held in the early evening in the company of only the ZBT brothers at Union and an initiation team comprised of ZBT brothers from chapters at New England College, Syracuse U n i v e r s i t y and ' Co r n e II University. Speeches were given by the president of Union, Thomas N. Bonner; Thomas Amato, the President of the Pan Hellenic Council; Mr. James Green, Executive Director of the national fraternal organization; and Chris McCarthy, the current president of the Zeta Beta Tau building.

The budgeting process for '77-'78 is finally complete (an itemized report coming soon) and preparations for next year's funding already underway. Applications for positions on the Audit (Tax) Committee for the year '78-'79 will be made available in Student Activities office in a few weeks (keep following Concordy for more info.). These positions are vital to the smooth operation of Student Activities and dedicated people are needed. There will be three openings on the Committee which must be filled by April I, 1978. Other positions will be filled by the incoming Chairman and the newly elected Secretary in the spring. The coming few years will be particularly challenging for the new committee, but also uniquely rewarding. With the current fiscal situation the Tax Committee, as well as Student Activities, will find .the availability of new funds for new equipment and programming restrictingly low. Because of lack of foresight, the stud~nt tax fund barely has enough money this year to fund the over 42 student clubs and organizations not to mention newly formed clubs and those who receive no funding due to their organizational status.

Unlike the two other concurrent overseas pr<>grams (France and Italy), our term began in late September (a week after Union started, to be exact); consequently, many of us were sources.

The Scene from Bath able to travel in Great Britain and on the continent for as long as three weeks. On September 28, however, the 35 of us converged upon Bath, our home for the next 2~ months. Arriving in that pleasant town \entirely con- structed of Bath stone,\ we made our way from the Brit-Rail sta .. tion to the Fernley Hotel~ where, we had been told, we would meet our \parents.\ These people came singly or in couples. Over tea and cookies we each made our initial acquaintance with them. Then it was time to be taken home, affording us the chance to discover the difference between British and American residences. For most of us, the first thing we found was that showers are almost totally non-existent in private homes. This caused some consternation in our group, but, as our presence at Union this term testifies, we survived no worse for the wear. inhuman heat in some Union dorms would have been a blessing at times like these. Some of us had a better time of it, though. The day after we arrived, we went to the University of Bath for an orientation. The school is on the top of a hill, a mile or two bus ride from the center of town. Most of us had to take two buses every day if we felt like attending classes (for some of us a big \if'). After meeting our \lecturers\ and being given synopses of our courses, we were- taken on a tour of the city. Bath is a very old city; people have lived in the area since Roman times, when the town was used as a rest-stop for the Roman legions. The city was built around the hot-water springs over which the Romans constructed baths; their soldiers and wealthy citi- zens soaked in them to \cure .. their diseases. A museum and excavation allow modern visitors to see the remains of these baths. In the 18th and 19th centuries Bath became the hub of British society; all buildings were constructed of beige-colored Bath stone and were built in the \Georgian\ manner. The most conspicuous architectural achieve- ments in the area are the long. flowing crescents, which are row houses built in half-moon stretches.· Sath Abbey is also year, and the few British students important, but every self- whom we were able to befriend. respecting town has an abbey or a We joined clubs on \Club?s cathedral; this gets to be a bit Fayre;' night (the word is not monotonous after a while.

For most of us this long weekend gave us our last chance to do any serious travelling, because our term ended December 9, the last day of Union's finals. Having only three weeks to get home, become re- acquainted with American life, unpack and· re~pack for school and move our belongings into our Schenectady re~jdences, a va~t majority of us left Britain by the 16th of December. We did have one last fling, though. The night of our last day of classes we had a catered dinner (;Jn the campus for the Union group and the l,ecturers, professors and administrators involved with our program. Afterwards we took a bus to The Ram Pub, where we stayed after pub-hours to say our final goodbyes and have our last drinks as a group. (Pubs close at 10:30 P.M. Sunday-Thursdaycand at 11 P.M. op Fridays and Saturdays, unless you have a private party, which we had arranged fot earlier in the week.)

On the trip we took which did not directly relate to our stu<lies, we went to Glastonbury Cathedral and T er (hill), two places deeply imbedded in the King Arthur legend. At the cathedral (which is now in ruins as a direct result of Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries), we viewed the alleged burial place of King Arthur and Queen Guenevere. Presently. there is no solid ~vidence that they were ever buried there. Foru.m Conti;nued- At this point something should be said about the British educa- tional system - not much.

The· number of clubs and organizations will probably increase, as will th.eir budget requests. Geberer stated that there may be a need for cutbacks in the spring, due to the increase in the number of organizations approved by the Forum recently, and to the unwillingness of the Forum to not fund the Glee Clubs, which would have forced the College to look at the issue of the funding of organizations and to hopefully fund the Glee Clubs. Various suggestions were introduced, varying from incremental increases over five years, to a statement in fhe cat~;tlog that the tax is approximately some dollar figure. Finally, Jeff S'cheininger proposed that the tax be raised up to $150for '79-80. President Ganz introduced a friendly amendment asking for immediate relief from the Trustees in the form of an approval for an increase to $99 for '78-79. The . p.rQposal was approved, with only Mark Burnett dissenting. · Geberer then made a suggestion that ·the Tax Committee mandate the submission of budgets three years in advance, with allowances for ·yearly reviews. Geberer's reasoning was that with the probable d()ubling of the tax fund in two years, more clubs will want to form and all clubs will ask for more money, only because they know that there is now more money available. He feels advance budgets wiU cut down on this inflating of budgets . Alan Rutkin, Assistant Chairman of the Tax Committee, disagreed with Geberer. He felt that before the Committee tried to budget three years in advance, they must catch up Qn this year's budget. lt was also pointed out that an organization's interests and members change frequently, and that subjecting a group to a budget submitted three years beforehand is urtfair.. As the two Tax Committee liaisons were in disagreement, it was agreed to table this matter. Bob Morgan, Chairman of the Elections Committee, introduces his proposed amendm'ents to the By-Laws of the Student Forum. After brief discussion, it was decided that the document introduced by Morganwas in fact Guidelines for the Elections Com- mittee. After minor changes, the Guidelines were approved with no dissenting ¥otes. · As time passed we noticed other differences'. Home appliances are smaller than their American c:ounterparts; for example, most refrigerators are the 5 cubic foot (i.e. normal suite) size, and television has only three stations (two of them nationalized). Later in the term something more immediately ap- parent caJ)ght our attention - houses are .;:old!

There are many reasons for these high prices .( b~d weather, recession, the list is as long as the imagination of the area owner to whom you are speaking), but the fact is that we are now paying as much as fifteen dollars for a lift-ticket.

Concordiensis also asks whether non-athletic activities should be stressed just as much as athletics might be. The pertinent question concernin.g an application should be whether a student can make a contribution to the college community. Both athletic and non-athletic talent shoud be taken in to consideration. According to Union's present admissions policy, as many points can be earned for non-athletic as for atheltic activities. It is not unreasonable to suggest that an extremely talented artist, with a respectable transcript, should be given the same extra consideration as a first rate runner. Finally, concerning financial aid, Prof. Bick has set forth a proposal which could make more money available for increased financial aid for athletes which with the help of alumni gifts would not take much away from the financial aid of non-athletic applicants. One specific example illustrates the use of this pool graphically. Last year a recruit was accepted. to Uni4.:m with 540 I 720 boards. When he applied for financial aid, the Parent's Confidential Statement determined that he ~ould need $400 to attend Union. The financial aid ,office offered this recruit no aid and he consequently went to the University of Rochester. The financial aid office may have had reasons for not offering this recruit aid. Nevertheless, such a proposed pool of aid for athletes would have made it possible to offer aid to this recruit without taking the full amount that he needed from another applicant . The college administration therefore should not procrastinate in forming policies concerning future athletics at Union. Prof. Bick has made the first step and this is always the hardest. The athletic issue is a central problem on campus and it should be treated as such. Big Brothers- - Sisters Just across the border in ln light of the recent loss of waiting list at Union.

1'age6 ~ ' • . ' t . \ ~ • . CONCORDIENSlS~ .Jtznuary 25, 1978 . . A Concordy Exclusive ~ . - •. by ANDY ALTMAN and ED PAIKOFF Concordy: Much has been said both pro and con a:bout the C<>nsumer Protection Agency which you and your organization have proposed. What would be the primary functions of this agency? Nader: Well, its primary £unction is to develop a core of trained professionals. economists. engineers, physicists, lawyers and accountants. who would present a competently prepared case before other Federal agencies who are considering issues such as natural gas pricing, food and drug safety, auto safety. transportation rates and whose decisions affect consumers. The problem now is that corporate lawyers and corporate trade associations all have their representatives before the Food and Drug Administra- tiotl or the Interstate Commerce C()mmission but the consumer's chair is empty. The Consumer Protection .Agency is designed to redress that balance and to take these other government agenCies to court where they do not enforce the law as Congress designed it to be. Concordy: Upon returning frorn winter ·recess, Union students were faced with unusually high phone bills. We were charged for the entire month of December while in years past we had had only been charged for one week plus a nominal discon- nection-re-connection fee. The change in policy was carried through without prior notification. What recourse do we have against such a large corporation? Nader:This has happened with other students in other states and that's one of the things which the Pul>lic Interest Research Group in New Yotk State (NYPIRG) can ltelp out . with. They have materials on how to challenge the telephone company and have also ilad experience on how students can band tc;»Beih.er for- better .cCJflSI!finer services, whether from llanks in the community or from the utilities. It is very important ta do this as a group, because there is stren8th in numbers. If you act individually, it is more likely that the phone company will be able to pre~ail. Concordy: What can consumers do if they are unhappy with what tlley buy in stores? Nader: They - can do three tltings. One is to become a more· savvy consumer, because after all, most consumers will spend hundreds of hours buying a car or f()od for the family. Why shouldn•t they spend a few hours a year learning how to buy a new car, and how to buy nutritious fo<Jd? Second, they've got to or,ganize. This is a society that permits organization, but if large gr<>ups don't organize, they're going to l>e . victimized · by co:mpanies that do. Third, they should re!;llize that there are services in government that. they . ' ( . can avail themselves of. For example, there are a whole series of tollfree 800 numbers that permit consumers to call the Department of Transportation, the Product Safety Commissiop., the Inte.rstate Commerce Commission and other offices damages, the courts set aside the judgment pending a review of overb~oking and no-shows by the Civil Aeronautics Board. What, if anything, has come out of this review? effected across the Board for all airlines within a yeal', and this will pretty much solve the abuse of overb()oking. Contordy: Why does it take so long for variouS' safety mandates ·such as air bags to go into effect? Nader: Because .the organized power of the companies exceeds the unorganized power of consumers. That's what the consumer movement is all about to make sure the consumer community in thi~ country has enough information and enough advocates to fight · General Motors and Ford in Washington and beat them. Coneordy: Do you feel that a $ZOO payment to purchasers of these cars is an equitable settlement? Nader: The Attorney General representing ·you, the motorist, worked out a settlement wtth General Motors which is not the strongest one, but it's a lot stronger than it was a few months ago. General· Motors has not only had to shell out rrriHions .of dollars, but it has gotten terribly adverse public relations, and as a result,. I don?t think they'll try anyrhing like that again. Nader: Well, first of all, the .Supreme Court reversed the ·decision of the Circuit Court and file District Judge a few days ago decided in my favor again. The res11lt of all this litigation is that tlte airlines now have to notify people that they may be over• booked. The Civil Aeronautics 8oard is issuing new rules shortly which will in effect severely penalize the airlines for over- booking and permit the airlines to devise a system that will eliminate overbooking. Actually, Eastern Airlines virtually solves tQ.at :problem now, because if you phone Eastern and the company says that the plane is full, they will put you on\vhat is known as \Leisure Class.\ This means that if you go out to the airport and y<>u do not get a seat on the plane, you get a free ride on the next plane.

This procedure will be Nader: It's simply a case of clear fraud. They're basically selling buyers a higher priced car with the engine of a lower priced car. Nader: Yes, to the extent that automobile companies ·have to recall or pay compensatory damages, they are goi~g to say to themselves, ••isn't it cheaper and easier to improve our quality control at the factory level and prevent the need for recall or damage payments to consumers?\ The more pressure there is on them from Washington and from the public at large, the more likely it will act as a deterrent to vehicle defects coming off the production lines and cars which they know to be consumer frauds, from ever le&ving the factory in the first place. Concordy: Do you feel that government agencies which regulate business affected with consumer health and safety are better than they were under the prior two administrations? Concordy:-Could you detail the charges you laid out against Congressman Stratton? Nader: Sani Stratton is a representative in Washington who Nader: Yes, but there is a .long way to go. First of all, they must get more competent people. They have to get more adequate resources and they have to be more firmly rooted. in the expectation level of America everywhere.

Nader has helped inspire the development .of 24 Public Interest Research Groups. These groups operate on a state leve~ and have combined annual budget of $1.4 million. The first of these organizations was established in Oregon by students at six colleges in 1970. The New Y6rk Public Interest Research Group, Inc. (NYPIRG), termed ''a nonpartisan research and a d v o c a c y o r g a n i z a ti on , established, directed, and supported by New Yotk State College and university students,\ by one of the group~s descriptive pampb:lets, was e~tal>llshed . in the action which led to the ban of red dye No. 2, a widely used coloring agent. Nader has also been active recently in launching a sports consumer group called Fight to Advance the Nation's Sports (FANS). This organization is designed, according to Nader, \to give the fan a voice in the big business of sports.\ · He says, ''fans are mistreated by arrogant multi-national organizations that own most or the pro sports teams, charge outrageous ticket prices, and trade !>allplayers like they were bubblegum cards.\ Taxpayers, Nader says, pay for the construction of municipal sports facilities, and have a right to have a voice in the determination of pro sports teams· procedures - a voice FANS hopes to provide. Nader is now seriously con- cerned with the development of new energy sources to help alleviate the current fuel shortage. He believes the production of nuclear energy is potentially dan- gerous and is being promoted by large corporations like General Electric because its· development will pring financial rewards. He says it cannot be considered as a solution to the energy problem. Rather, Nader believes that solar power should be tapped for energy. ..Solar energy is free and limitless,\ he says, and an effort sfiould be made .to develop the technology that could utilize its potential. To encourage this development, a national ..

Nader:No, we haven't really gone into many new issues in the Nader Continued from Page l Electric is constantly polluting the environment. yet nut once has the Union College student body protested this or instituted student research. Mr. Nader feels that students, as well as all people;must become involved in alleviating these problems. Our society has the technology and the ability to achieve this. 1-iowever, only through education, hard work, and .dedication caa we do ~so. We as students are at a point in our lives when we shculd be at the height of our idealism; we are free to think, innovate, and experiment. To pass by this opportunity, Mr.. Nader said, would be a terrible mistake. through. In some sense, we're like rep()rters who will do an article on this area and then next week an article on that just to open up the horizons and the opportunities, and explore the abuses. As far as our follow~ thmugh is concerned, we have several areas that we've been with now for several years, and have become very expert. Concordy: What are your plans for future areas of investigation? Nader: What we're now most interested in is giving consumers ,the tools to organile themselves as consumer cooperatives as consumers vis-a-vis utility companies, trying to help students organize such as the NYPIRG model or the public interest group model across the country. That's probably more important now than going into a substantive area such as say, cosmetics, or clothing. What is most important is trying to give people all over the country the know-how and the tools so they can vastly multiply the effort~ of consumer justice.

The Chinese Students Associa- tion, comprised of both foreign and American Chinese, was farmed at the beginning of the 1976 Fall Term. The basic concept for the formation of this group was twafold.

Following this philosophy, this year the C.S.A. provides a full- day pro_g{am beginning at 2:00 p.m. Prof. Bruce Reynolds of the Economics Department and Prof. Susan Blader of the Chinese Language Department together with some students from their classes are also helping out. At Hale House there is an art display, Chinese games and calligraphy, two slide presentations, musical entertain- ment, demonstrations and talks. There is also a five-course Chinese dinner which opens at 5:00 p.m. The cost of the dinner is $3.50 before Saturday and $4.00 at the c;looL Tickets are availa-ble at the Student Activities Office or with any member of the C.S.A.

Placement: Boston Internship by DAN ROSENBAUM This past Winter Break, When m~ny of us were passively pondering our post-Union lives and what should be done with them, one group of Union students made an effort to discover their alternatives. The Pl~cement Office, in cooperation with the Boston Alumni Club, sponsored an Alumni Intern Week on December 13-16; 1977. Thirty students were the guests of 21 Boston area alumni. The students followed the alumni around for the 1 week, observing what it is that goes into the different jobs, and getting an idea about whether or not what they saw was appealing. The alumni covered a wide range of professions: doctors, lawyers, politicians, publishers, store · managers, stock brokers. and others were hosts. Some problems with the program developed. Sine~ many of ,the students were not from the Boston area, providing accommoc;lations proved something of a challenge. Winter weather in the city didn't help, making travel difficult. In addition, the Christmas season made the week more hectic than it might ·have ordinarily been. Despite these difficulties everyone that participated enjoyed the program and obtained some kind of positive result from it. Some students discovered that the job they observed was not what they had expected it to be. In part this was what the program was expec~ed to produce. Ben Green, one of the participating students spent a day in a large company. He noted that the Boston Internship was \a relaxed, interesting and informative inside view into a company without actually being employed by that company. It was an opportunity to see how I could eventually fit into the business world. A beneficial after- effect is that the_ experience may seve as a contact for a future job.\ A program .in New York also took place over vacation. Students spent an evening with an alumni panel. A wide range ol professions were represented incl11d-ing medicine. law, personal management! - a.nd marketing. Each panelist discussed his I her work for about ten minutes. A program is being set up-with Schenectady area alumni, for the week of Feb. 20-24. Already, 20 alumni have indicated willingness to participate and the Placement Office expects it to be a greater success than the Boston program. Many of the problems that beset that program will not be present in Schenectady. Sign-ups will be at Placement on Feb. 2,3,6, and 7. The office is considering making ' the internships a year-round · event, but on a smaller scale, if the interest is shown.

Of tl'tese, certain scenes will be acted ()Ut and directed by the students in these two classes, giving both d'irectors and actors and actresses experience on a smali scale.

Sound far-fetched, crazy, and impossible? Hilrdly! This fall, l7 Union College students had the opportunity to travel to this World and spend two .months in beautiful Rennes. 'Rennes you say?'Gi~hat i$ a Rennes? No it is not another Secaucus, New Jersey - it is a city of 230;000 residents about 35() km west of Paris in the heart of enchanting and unspoiled Bretagne . The opportunity is part of the term abroad program offered in France during fall tetm. In Rennes the ~tudent lives inde- pendently with a family and participates in the normal cultural life of the city. The course of study include~ a language course (La .plume de ma tante ... ), a civilization course (all right, who the hell was Claude?), and an independent study project related to the. students' own interests and experiences in Bretagne (Le. - the different types of toilet paper in European bathrooms). Students having a cum of over 2;0 and taking a preparatory language course - FRN 1.33 - or its equivalent are eligible to apply for the term abroad in Rennes and I heartily recommend it to each and every one of you. The e~perience is one which we The faces of the people As they scatter in the rain Reflect a silent fear .. Will spring come once again?\ The rain it beats the earth To wash her fears away will never fmget ~ to escape the grip of Schenectady and to ex.ist in a whole nev; culture and lifestyle. Firstly, we had the chance to eat, sleep, and live with a French family who spoke little or no English. this situation gave us the opportunity to actual1y experience the French way of life ~ something which few-of us ever do. There was such a good feeling to sit down to Sunday dejeuner and have some aper11tifs before eating, !lOttie champagne before aperatifs, some wine w.ith ·your meat, a different Wine with your cheese ami l>rea<l, another wine with your fruit, and finally sips of 13 varrous bottles of digestifs ranging from ~ognac to Top Job (Sorry, no Wild Turkey!). I don't · know ex.actly what this feeling was, but it sure was good. Also, it was because of my family that my French improved so greatly. Going from a totally English· environment in Schenectady (well, semi--English), to a totally French speaking family was the best way to start speaking the language. If you didn't, you would have never found out where the bathr.oom was l Seriously, my family was really excellent along with the oth~;rs and they did so much to help make our stay an enjoyable one. The city of Rennes was another factor in the excellence of the program. One might think, standing in the railroad station with backpack on back and Eurailpass in hand, that Rennes was an unimpressive city, but · don't let tllose rabbits, ducks, boars. and elephants hanging in And the faces fade like raindrops As they mingle in the crowd And I call your name, I hear your voice But you're lost among the sound So today li-sten more closely . Hear what l have to say the windows feol you. Rennes, m its own way, is beautiful, f!'t:r from the metropolitan city of Paris where you can run down the block and buy a Big Mac with some fries,. and close to the quaint villages of Bretagne where the tradition~ and custems of the Bretons still run the lives of m!lny. To be able to ride mobylettes down the cobblestone streets seeing if Frefich cars fall apart when you bounce off of them, to run down to the corner Patisserie between classes to grab a delicious hot croissant, to buy a 6-pack of wine for 60q: and go to the park to \feed the pigeons,\ and to get psyched for a rendezvous at the Picadiliy were all moments that added sa much to the program. Finally, I cannot talk about our trip without l)J.entioning a factor that made our time there absolutely formidable. Professor William Thomas, the faculty member who accompanied our group,. was the biggest asset to the program. Without him; the trips to the Chateau Valley and St. Malo, the aftermath of Lucky Pierre's classes, La C1gale, and the whole ten weeks would have been void of something vital - his presence (and besides, Prof. Dressayre wouldn't have had any cigarettes). I can just picture him now on the bus in Tours - ··where the hell is Whit?'' Merci Prof. Thomas. All in all, France was a triumph, a program with nothing to lose and everything in the world to gain. Now we are able to look back upon the two different cultures and really cherish what we have here in the states. It is an eye-opener th.at no one should miss.

The contest, which marked the 92nd match between the two rivals, was well played by both squads during the first half. HamHton, known for its devastating fast-break offense, came out strong hitting their first 8 shots in a row. However, the Dutchmen, led by strong rebounding from K. R. Marshall, connected on ·several hoops themselves. Moreover, Union's persistept defense contained Hamilton, slowing them down to a pace more suitable to the Dutchmen's style of play. Their defense truly· proved itself, as Hamilton was one of the highest scoring teams in the national last year. As a result of this asset, Union trailed by just 5 points at the end of the half. 41-36. The start of the second half proved to be the difference as Hamilton controlled the opening tip, and proceeded to convert a 3-' point play. Furthermore, the Continentals, ranked· seventh in the nation for Division III schools, tallied four more fast points enabling them to stretch what seemed to be a mere five points into a somewhat uncatchable 12 point lead·. Led by all-American forward Cedric Oliver, Hamilton moved into its traditional run and gun offense. Union forced to play catch-up basketball, had little choice but to try and tally as quickly as pGssible. It was this fast play that turned a close game into a relative rout; both teams trading baskets with Hamilton obtainirl.g the better \deaL\ e With just minutes to play, Hamilton hc:d opened up a 72-50 lead, To make matters even worse, Union's leading scorer, Mike Smith, was held to just Women's B-ball Caged by Sage \ by Lynn Bateman Nerves were taut and muscles tense as the Union women's varsity basketball team began their season Monday night against their cross-town rivals Russell Sage.

Unfortunately, the first-game jitters plus Sage's full court press began to force Union into some poor passes which resulted in a number of turnovers and points for Sage. Union came close to breaking Sage's lead at 8 points, but then Sage pulled away with some fine hustling play of their own to finally win 58M. eleven points as *he Dutchmen · offense could not penetrate Hamilton's stingy 1-3-l defense.

Lower WeiliCht Gaps Put Wre,stlers 3-7 by Jon Schorr On cold winter afternoons while the rest of us have been nerding out, sleeping or watching \Batman tile Union College Wrestling Team has been sweatjng it out in the wrestling room of the gym. The hard work thus far has produced a 3-7 record. Numbers, however, can lie; or at least tell half truths. The 3-7 record is not indicative of a lack of talent or ability, . but rather a lack of wrestlers. The problem for the ~\grapplers lies in the lowest two weight classes ( ll8 & 126 ). This · year's squad, coached by AI Bagnoli and ex-grappler Mike Paquette has been without a wrestler to fill the first weight class all season long and because of an early season shoulder injury to Carl Calabria, the 126 pound class has been unfilled since December. Despite great strength and flexibility in the middle and upper weights, the team's overall performance has been hurt by the lower weight class problems. As Coach Bagnoli points out, spotting your opponent 6-12 p(}ints each match is no way to start out if you hope to win. The middle and upper weights are the strength of the Union squad. The 142 lb. class is the unchallenged preserve of junior George Redder. Redder can boast a near perfect 8-l record, the only loss coming to a traditionally strong Springfield opponent. Redder, who was chosen as an alternative to the east-west \lew York State All-Star team, seems to just \out-tough\ his opponents. Senior captain Jim Sutton has sole title to the 158 lb. weight class where he has lost just once. Sutton, who was recently named to the New York State east-west All-Star team receive!> accolades from teammates and coaches alike. When asked about his squad's captain, coach Bagnoli let go with an unending series of superlatives. Beginning with the 16 7 ib~ weight class, the grapplers great flexibility stands out. Pete Felicer, Cliff Farrell, Josh Salzman, Matt Van ~nthem and Fran Rindenfello can be used almost interchangeably in the five highest weight classes. Salzman and Felicer have been chosen as alternatives to the east-west. Coach Bagnoli gives much credit for any success to his junior partner, Mike Paquette, a 1976 Union graduate who was the first All-American wrestle~ in Union history. fhe wrestling team next faces King's Point, a\vay.

The economics major, at 5 ft. 10 in. and 165 lbs., tended goal at Kalamazoo better than anyone could have expected an inexi)Srienced 20-year old would, and Detroit's G. M. Ted Lindsay was impressed.

Despite Friday's heavy snow, Union's track team did not become bogged down •. in fact they almost effortlessly ran away from the opposing teams. Union dominated Sl:lturday's meet, accumulating 78'12 points as Williams, Hamilton and Middlebury had 48!12,- 22, and 12 points respectively. Out of the 15 track and field events, Union grabbed first place ·1:2 times. Junior co-captain Kevin Scheuer. In the field events, freshmen Jim Zalucki vaulted 13'0'' to win that event and Dave Cozzens flopped 6'6'' to win the high jump. Though Union?s putters faired well, they were no comp.etition for Ham·ilton's Jasinski who with ·his characteristic bone chilling yell, reached the first three places in the triple jump with Earl Chilton first, and in the long jump, Bob Moffat had a very respectl:lble leap, only a foot off the winning distance, finishing fifth. Union displayed its superiority however in ,the runnin_g events. Matt Blum excelled in both tile 5.5 yd. hurdles and the 50 yd. dash twice hitting the wire first with excellent times. On Blum's heels in both races were Mark Nazzon tied for second in the hurdles and Ed Dingman, 2i)d in the sprint. Co-captain Kevin Scheuer, ex·hibiting his machine-like style, won both the one mile (4:1 7.4) and the I 00.0 yd. (2: 16. I) events finishing far ahead of the rest of the field in each race.

As expected, Junior distance ace Doug Richardson got off to a successful start, winning both his distance freestyle events. Richardson, a junior from Norwalk, Conn., holds the college record for the 1000 and 500 yard freestyle. Other· wins were turned in by Captain Jim Lowe. of Schenectady, in the 200 yard breaststroke; Junior Mark Peronto of Pittsfield, Mass., in the 200 butterfly; Freshman Andy Berquist of Clarence, N.Y., in the 200 lreestyte and Senior fom Broadbrooks, Cottage Hill, HI., in the 200 yard backstroke.

Union's relay team h:as gained the reputation of being one of the best in their division and is always respected by the schools who oppose them. Last week's team of Guilfoyle, Vielkind, Scheuer, and Moffat seemed very confident and loose as they gathered together in a huddle just before the race and chanted a few words, their significance known only· to them. The crowd's total attention was now focused on this c:vent, the ·last of the day, and one could sense their anticipation. As the race began however, Union promptly fell behind ta third place and as the leg ended~ you could . feel a sense of panic spreading throl1gh the fieldl:touse. It seemed Kevin Scheuer realized the gravity of the situation as he grasped the baton and started on the third leg. With cool determination he slowly pulled even with the lead runner.
