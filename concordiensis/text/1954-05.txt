Colonel Edward Souliere, PAST at Union, disclosed this afternoon that the cam- pus A. F. R. 0. T. G. would be activated immediately for duty at Dien Bien Phu. The unit, it was further an- nounced, will function as an infantry group because of the insufficient training which time has permitted. The Colonel, with tears of un- bounded patriotism streaming down lais battle-tired cheeks, stood be- fore an enormous reproduction of \Washington Crossing the Dela- ware\ and as a portable phonoJ graph played the stirring powerful strains of \Into the \Air Junior Birdmen'' a.n.notmced the following: \We the men of A. F. R. 0. T. C. unit 545, stand ready to defend the mud flats of Indo-China through sleet and storm and dark of night. We will fight to the death of the last valiant cadet, if it be necessary to accomplish our goal of a free Indo-China under total French rule. · We are the first unit in the his- tory of the R. 0. T. C. to be called to active duty, and we are proud of the hQnor, Pr91Jd of this trust in our fighting spirit, proud to be selected. We are a proud outfit. We are a fighting outfit.'' With this, the Colonel removed his ·gun hand from his jacket, took off his three-cornered hat, anQ. was silent. Mter a few moments dur- ing which no one spoke or mrade a sound, with a feeling of humble Indo-Chinese patriotism every- where, one of the reporters at this full-scale press conference asked when the cadets wcluld leave. Be- fore answering the question, Sou- Here stressed_ the point that the men were to go on a purely volun- tary boois; he then said that 90 per cent of the car.npus corps bas asked to go and that they would leave as soon as the few deserters Oa.ter established as 239) were ap- prehended. In regard to the other 10 per cent, Souliere was quoted as follows: \Those yellow-bellied cowards.\ This reporter asked the highest ranked officer on campus who had given the order to mobilize. \There- in, lies the tale. It seems. that the order came directly from the top, from General G. David Schine who has ta,ken over, as you know,. be- coming Commander of the .Anrted Forces.\ Asked what rank the cadets would be given, the Colonel replied that they will all/be commissioned as second lieutenants in the Indo- Chinese infantry and would receive a stipend of 500 a month. \Dol- (Contintied on Page 6)

OPPORTUNITY For Unique Experience in Human Relations As time has drawn close upon th<' •·nd of another marking period, the inhabitants of Union College hav<' had it once more pressed firmly on their minds that college consists of som..thing rr.ore than Beer, Bull, anrl Brawn. It is a shame that this must be, but par- •·nls hav•.· pe.culiar id.eas. T'h<'Y i.n- clude a fourth \B'' in the curri\ culum Books. Therefore let me talte this opportunity to eKplain to thr· uninitiated just ,;;hat this means. Book,; nre something written by tcachrrs to ~lw out thPir existence with. Th\Y are ~-;enerally written on paper, although some, Ir.Ore for the novelty than for their utility, have b<'•'n writt<'n on such varied substancrs as steel plates, tree leaves, and typ<•writer ribbons. One uf the inos-1: famous of these, \Care of The Hands or How to Ha1•e Paws That Refresh,\ was en- graved on Coca-Cola bottles. Books then, are pieces of paper bound between something stiff such as cardboard. plywood, or a tVI'o- ounce shot of Kentucky Mountain Dew. These covers arc colored in varied huee, so it is Impossible to tell ,;;hat a boolt is about ,by the color of the outside. Many serious accidents can happen because of this idiosyncra..qy of the publishers. One lad I kn~w once studied a whole term's Economics out of a Calculus book because the cover was the same &hade of sickly green as the cover of his last three Eco books. SizPs and shapes vary quite a bit, too. the larger, heavier, books containing about the sarr.e number of facts as the small, light ones. It is often advisable to visit the Bookstor.e before signing up for any courses to sec how heavy the books for that course are. It is not advisable to have twa. classes on the same day both of which re- quire books of over four pounds. Many good men have been ruined for life, by having to carry weighty ones. Books may contain pictures, charts, and graphs along with the text, which, by the way, is the word used to denote all the writing inside of a ·b<>ok. Books wlllch In- clude these to vary the mon<>tony are much more interesting than thoee that are just bare pages filled with unintelilgible print. Some of these boolts, particularly those per- taining to Biology and Its allied sciences, are almost as entertain- ing as page four of the Dally News. The News, however, is much easier to !'ead and digest. (There is less stomach-irritating tar in The News.) Charts and graphs are sometimes very interesting to those intellectual individuals who like crossword puzzles. Many happy hours can be spent trying to ar- rive at the proper conclusion hid- den among the lines. The only drawback is that the answ.ers are not printed in special boxes. Parents have the right idea. Everybody should ow.n a book. No home is complete without one. They are useful in many way&, such as for paper-weights, missiles, and bottle-openers. Many people like to keep books about because they lend a scholarly atmosphere to a ro.om, but this ean be carried too far because of the fact that booke are great dust collectors. Among the boo ll:s I would recom- rr. end for beginners are \Lysi9- trata\ by Aristophanes, Anything by Rabelais. and \Official Bar- tender's Guide.\ In closing, Jet me reinind you that the College .keePs a large number of ·books on exhibition In that round building across from Hale House, If you are broite and can't affot•d to buy a book drop in there; it's open quite frequently. the second In a series of 12,469 dif~ ferent ground-breaklngs to come up sometime in the future, each in turn to be a gala festival, with the end result that the entire excava- tion will be dug, by band, by our bard-working president.

Ode To A Weekend They say I have to write a My shirts are cast in dis- poem array To welcome you all here Upon the bathroom sink When I'm not happy that And some fair lass, I'm forced you've come to say, (And come to stay, I fear.) Dropped tooth paste in my ink! You ~se my bed and read my At last you'll leave my lonely mall room And powder up t~le floor Completely ripped asunder- And steal my pm-ups from And all my buddies wonder the wall why And gri1;e me to the core. I rant and I'ave and thunder. There's :ipstick on my brand I guess I should have been a ne\v tie girl And nial-goo on my shoes. And done what you are doin'. And \V011l out stockings in my Then I could join the fun clesk- you've had A bra that I can't use. And helped to cause the ruin! p Something About Books As time has drawn close upon the <·nd of another marking period, the inhabitants of Union College hav<' had it once more pressed firmly on their minds that college consist» of soml'thing rr:ore than Beer, Bull. anrl Brawn. It is a shame that this must be, but par- <·nts han· peculiar ide;;ls. \rh.cy in- clude a fourth \B\ in the curri- culum Books. Therefore Jet me talw thi,; opportunity to explain to thP uninitiated just what this means. Books nre something written by teachPrs to eke out their existence with. Th<·y are generally written on papPr, although some, rr.ore for the nowlty than for their utility, have bc•'n writt<'n on such varied substances as steel .plates, tree leaves, nnd type·writer ribbons. One of the mo>rt famous of these, \Care of The Hands or How to Have Pa>~s That Refresh,\ was en- graved on Coca-Cola bottles. Books then, are pieces of paper bound between something stiff such as cardboard. plywood, or a two- ounce shot of Kentucky Mountain Dew. These covers arc colored in varied hues, so it is imposeible to tell what a bool; is about by the color of the outside. Many serious accidents can happen because of this idiosyncrasy of the publishers. One lad I knew once Rtudied a vt\hole term's Economics out of a Calculus book because the cover was the same shade of sickly green as the cover of his last three Eco books. Sizes and shapes vary quite a ·bit, too. the larger, heavier, books containing about the same number of facts as the small, light oneSl. It is often advisable to visit the Bookstore before signing up for any courses to see how heavy the books for that course are. It is not advisable to have two_ classes on the same day both of which re- quire books of over four pounds. Many good men have been rained for life, by having to carry weighty ones. Books may contain .pictures, charts, and graphs along with the text, which, by the way, is the word used to denote all the \Writing inside of a book. Books which in- clude these to vary the monotony are much more interesting than those that are just bare pages filled with unintelilgible print. Some of these ·books, particularly those per- taining to Biology and its allied sciences, are almost as entertain- ing as page four of the Dally News. The News, however, is much easier to read and digest. <There is less stomach-irritating tar in '!'he News.) Charts and graphs are sometimes very interesting to those intellectual individuals who ·like crossword puzzles. Many happy hours can be spent trying to ar- rive at the proper conclusion hid- den among the lines. The only drawback is that the answers are not printed in special boxes. Parents have the right idea. Everybody should own a book. No home is complete without one. They are useful in many way&, such as for paper-weights, missiles, and bottle-openers. Many people like to keep books about because they lend a scholarly atmosphere to a room, but this can be carried too far because of the fact that books are great dust collectors. Among the books I would recom- mend for beginners are \Lysis- trata\ by Aristophanes, Anything by Rabelais, and \Official Bar- tender's Guide.\ In closing, let me remind you that the College kee}}s a. large number of books on exhibition in that round building across from Hale House. If you are broke and can't afford to buy a book, drop in there; it's open quite frequently. FRIDAY, MAY 7, 1954 A Field House, They Say? Hmmm.m For Your Info MONDAY, MAY 1()....-Professor N. G.

The team has a 2-1 record se far this season, and will be out to better that mark. For the benefit of thos~ who start the weekend early, Mr. Bradbury, tennis coach, has asked us to emphasize that tennis balls are not edible. \.Also remarked coach Bradbury, \they are not in any way sjmiJar to the feminine sex. Regardless of the fact that they bounce and can be knocked around, they are meant for only one sport- and that is tennis.\ Two hours later, at 3:30, the la-<e•>-' --------------- Die-Hards In Early Game The time-5 a.m. Saturday Morn- ing; the Place-Library Field; the Event-a Softball game?; t:he par- ticipants-Delta Upsilon and Phi Sigma Delta; the prize--one case of Beer (cold). Looking Around At Current Sports In baseball, the Pittsburgh Pi- rates won the National League pennant on the last day, fin.ish!ng the season with a 46-game wmnmg streak the longest in history and giving' them a total of 48 wins for the year. The Giants were second, copping the last-day triple header from the Dodgers, and the Chicago Cubs finished third. The American League ·saw the Detroit Tigers win two more on the last day to bring their already record-breaking total of wins up to 143. The Athletics were second, eight games back, and the ~e~end­ ing champion Yankees f1mshed last. crosse team meets Adelphi on Daley Field. The Mullanemen have a 1-4 record this year but hope to get on the winning trail. Coach, Ray Mullane has asked us to make the same comments concerning a lacrosse ball as Mr. Bradbury did about a tennis ball, and has asked us to add that a lacrosse stick is not a javelin and that the nets do not resem1ble an outdoor fire place. In past years, the team has had to give up practice for several days because Union students did not realize these facts. Tomorrow morning sees baseball games take place on Library Field. In connection with these, Dean Huntley has asked for a little quiet in the game that takes place under his window, Last year, the Dean was not only kept awake by the noise, but some of the par- ticipants in the game mistook his window for home plate, and Dr. Huntley awoke amid broken glass, empty beer bottles, bases, ·bats, full beer bottles, and three ferndnine cheer leaders, who, believe it or not, were sleeping on top of the whole mess. Basketball made the headlines this week because the N.B.A. passed a ~ew rule which limits players to six feet in height.. .The This forthcoming athletic event, Mineapolis Lakers have offleially so far as we ·can tell, is one o.f the announced that they are on strike, earliest evidences of Union's new and the matter 'Will be brought up athletic prosperity.

The only other organized event of the weekend that could be called athletic is the debate which will take place at 10:00 this evening in the gym. The event will feautre the Philomatheans and certain long- winded members of the faculty (unanimously picked by the Con- cordiensis staff). It is felt that this may be a contest, not of skill b\lt of endurance, but both sides are confident, and student interest runs high. Most are not able to see how either side could possibly lose in that sort of event. The question will be \Are tennis balls edible,\ two of the students claiming that they have tried it, and the faculty taking the opposite stand. training rules \n preparation for.

These sporting activities will take up most of the weekend, and we feel confident that the students can figure out what to do with the rest of it. According to DU coach Inkey Atwell, a training table has 'been set up in the house and strict rules prohibiting drinking, stu.dying, and women have been impQsed. At- well bas expressed some concern over the dark pall of secrecy that is pervading the Phi Sig hCJuse.

I I I I I ! I I I ! ! 6 What's) In A Garden? Jackson's Gardens ... the den of iniquity? . . . the root of all evil ..• Union College in every sense of the word? No, not that. What is this place that sends shivers down the spines of hardy men, makes strong women melt, and mothers scream? Lest we forget, let us go back tt> that little pamphlet that started us toward Schenectady, the Union College Bulletin. What does it have to say about this infamous plot of ground? \In the plan of 1813 an ample area athwart the college brook was indicated for a garden. It was begun in 1831 as an avocation of Professor Isaac W. Jackson and now, as Jackson's' Garden, remains the finest land- scape feature of Union and, as its sons firmly believe, of any col- lege.\ It's all hearsay then. There's nothing diffet·ent about it. It's just anothGr garden, a place of beauty. But why this change that has sud- denly come over the campus? The certain heady bubbly lightness in the ·air. The pronounced feeling of camaraderie which abounds. A cig- arette? C'ertninly, which hrand? Oh, no, never mind·, keep the whole pack . . . Light? Sure, here you are. Tricky little lighter, isn't it? , .. Yeh, I picked it up in Indo- China. Here, you keep it. There's lots more where that camJe from. Heh, heh ... Yes, the campus of Union Col- lege this weekend is a veritable promised land oozing with milk and honey. Why? Hour tests haven't been abolished. Some of the professors have even scheduled them for Monday morning. Why do we have such dreamers'? There is still a Chapel point requirement. Then why this sudden bursting of the old barriers of furtive black looks, swift knife thrusts in the dark, and blood stained pre-meds? A weak voice of protest is heard. \G'wan kid. You're drunk. Just because the Spring Prom is being held this weekend is no. reason to contract mental paralysis. What's so hot about the Spring Prom?\ With an animal-like snarl we reach for the dagger which is hid- den under our block U, and hurl ourselves on the heretic, scream- ing, \Then die, blaspheming dog!\ Thereupon, the blaspheming dog dies. To return to reality, the air at Union is pregnant with the ex- pectancy of the Prom. How we have joyously looked forward to this hallowed weekend!, What an eternity of preparations we have made! Flowers, tuxedoes, room reservations, swindles, tickets, transportation, threatening letters to irate parents, wrathful notes to confidently unaffected dates, and best of all, that hour we spent every night in front of the mirror, practicing passionate puckering, suave raising of the eyebrows, and suggestive flaring of one nostril. ·To many of the students and their dates this is all a new ex- perience,-their first Spring Prom. Many of the more adventurous members of the student body will try to visit our Gardens for the first time in the company of a date. If they are lucky, they will malte it before curfew. If they fail, they will stand outside and won- der how that other couple got in. They will conclude that the boy is a close friend of the campus cop, perhaps the cop hirruself. Then, as so many other couples have done in the past, they will slowly, pain- fully climb the fence, proVing once again that love knows no bounds. ---•0--- Prom Weekend Glossary A few of these words may come in handy this weekend: Pick-up-frustration followed by hope. Blind date-hope followed by more hope. Fix-up--Csee blind date and pick- up.) Pinned-hope followed by frustra- tion. Going steady - eliminates costly weekends. Pill-sits close tt> the chaperone. Prude-sits next to- the pill. Chaperot:es-sons and daughters of the American Revolution. House mother-the American Rev- olutio-n. Mug - whether it's porcelain or flesh, it holds beer. Dolilinio Carbone, Junior Prom Committee chairman. has re- quested that all visitors to Jackson's Gardens during the Jazz Concert refrain from trrunpling, mutilating, or pick- ing flowers. This is necessary if such affairs are to be held in the future. U you must pick the tulips, please do so at some time other than that at whic.h Carbone is responsible for the maintenance of the place. FRIDAY.

Mr. Ab€ Cohen, owner of the Imperial Store at 325 State ,Street, has established a new $100 annual scholarship. The Im- perial scholarship, which will ·take. the foi\m of a direct annual grant, will be awarded each year by the Scholarship Committee of the elol- lege. Cohen established his original Imperial in Octob'er of Hl12 at the site of its present location. Throughout the years, the store has undergone variou.s enlarge- ments, climaxed by a $100,000 ex- pansion program in 1948, and cur- rently occupies most of a three- story building. The firm today employs sixty-five people. Mr. Cohen's Interest in Union College is one of long standing. His oldest son, Bernard J.

F owulecl at Union· CoUege in 1817 SCHENECTADY, N.Y.; MAY 14, 1954 The prog.ram 0f alumni suppon uf faculty salaries was inaugurated in April, 1953, with a gift of $29,- 000 which was collected in the 1952 Alumni Fund drive, As a result of that gift, the College was enabled· to establish new faculty salary no ors of $6,000 for full Professors, $5,000 for Associate PI\ofessor and $4,000 for Assistant Professors. In· so doing, Union took its place in the top ten per cent of colleges its size in. the Middle Atlantic region in salary scales. Dr. Davidson stated in accepting this year's gift from the Council: \I wish to express again this year my deepest appreciation to all of our alumni who have contributed so generously to tb,eir alma mater. and, in particular, to so vital a cause. Alumni generosity, as evi- denced by this new gift, will en- able us to continue the high level of faculty salaries which were established last year. Certainly no single issue is more closely related to Union's financial well-being and to the con.tinuation of her present high standards of education.\ \Whether large or srn<all,\ Dr. Davidson continued, \a college can only be as good as its faculty. Over its many years of existence, Union .ha:;; constantly striven tQ maintain its identity as a small, privately endowed institution offer- ing a well-balanced program of courses.\ Thy Childrett's Chorus Read Page 2 :PRICE' 10 CENTS :Registration for malta--up \'tests to be given on Tuesday- W etlnesdn.y,.

' '• 2 Y'All Come We believe it is the job of a student newspaper to aid in any way it can, '!.he activities of the campus. This may best be done through the valuable publicity which we can afford to these activities. Such publicity usually appears in the form of feature stories which are aimed at obtaining maximum interest in campus functions. It is a ra11e thing, however, when the paper devotes its editorial space to obtain student support for an activity. Tome>rrow there will be a dance held on the campus. It is as has been already announced in Chapel and at the fra- ternity houses as the \Tennis Court Cotillion.\ It represents a new type of activity at Union. It is the first event which will be sponsored by the House Presidents CounciL It also stands out in my mind as the first dance to be run by any group fer the campus. However, this is not the only unique feature of the \Tennis Court Cotillion;\ the fact that this dance will be run to obtain money for a worth- while project desel'ves the consideration of every man on campus and should be enough incentive to prompt all of us to purchase tickets for the event, whether we plan to attend or not. ~ We believe that the council in selecting their goal for this dance did g-o to extremes, but they selected, nevertheless, an objective which we deem highly desirable. The total profits from this year's dance will be allocated to a fund to build a new electric sco!'eboard on Alexander Field which will serve both for baseball and football games. The total cost of such a scoreboard has been estimated at $1500, and the council does not expect to gross this figul'e or even come near it. They are hoping, however, to have as large a turn- out as possible. The larger the profit, the closer we are to the eventual goal of a new scoreboard. It is felt by many people that the dance without support, will fail to meet its expenses; it would be discouraging- if the student body now aware of the pmposes of the dance do not give it their maxi- mum support. We are taking this space to ask the campus to support the H. P. G. dance and thereby help them to help the school. -G. R. K. In Passing Minor Grievances Which Are Worthy of Mention The college finally decided to do something about the l'oad between West College and the North College parking area. This stretch of road, termed the pasture path, has always been a sore spot to the men who are forced to use this parking area. The college's recent interest in the road was encourag-ing, but unfortunately their efforts wel'e washed a\vay with the first rain. We know a good many drivers who a.re hoping for some relief from the present sore spots on this thoroughfare. Speaking of highways, that little stretch behind the g;ym could also use some repair work. Campus roads, and this is often overlooked, are as important to the appearance of the school as are the grounds and the buildings; and if they are allowed to fall into poor condition they are one of the first flaws to impress a campus visitor as well as being a hazard to the students. * * :(. There is an imposing list displayed on the wall of the Chemistry library. It contains books which are now missing from the shelves. This library maintains a complete collec- tion of books which are invaluable to students doing re- search in the field. Worst of all is the honor system em- ployed in signing books out. The student takes the book leaving the card with his name in a box supplied for that purpose. It is shameful when students abuse such a system. We would like to see these books returned that they may be used by students who have no other access to this material.

CHI!OUL.A.TION STAFF Alan Chesler, Bernard Cohen, Fred Roberts, :.rartin Stein, Charles FRIDAY, MAY 14. 1954 Letter to the Editor Dea:r Editor, I regretted readip.g in last week's Concordiensis that the College plans to tear ' down the faculty housing in Dutchman's Vi'llage to mi!Jke way for two baseball fields. The admiinstration argues that the Village is unsightly and should be to VI n down. I agree. Thy Children's Chorus However, if the Village is torn down and replaced by baseball dia- monds, it v\Hl result, Ln ,effect, in the equivalent of ,a:t Teagt a five hundred dollar cut in the salary of the faculty member who live t'her.e. This cut would not be made up, as erroneously believed, by the sched\ ·uled increase in student .tuition, as this money will be used to help pay for the new wooden field house. The Village currently provides cheap housing for the faculty at a cost of thlrty six dollars per month, plus the cost of heat. Com- parable housing in Schenectady, such as Sheridan Village, costs ninty five do'llars per n:onth, dis- regavd'ing the added cost of tJ1ans\ portation. By dismantling Dutch- man's V!llage, capable young pro- fessors will be attracted elsewhere instead of coming to Union. Some of the better faculty members al- ready here would be forced to leave. The college would lose its annual profit from the Village. Thus 'by tearing down the VH!age without providing replacements, We will 10~ er our academic standards. The main resons for tearing down the Village and not replacing it with new housi·ng are that this would cost money and two new baseball diamonds could not be By Hans Groot Some fool junior ran an old gar- net towel up the Psi U flagpole last week, thereby depriving the college the chance to fly a decent American flag for Prom Week- End. The authorities have de- elaNd that all of us must suffer the consequences of this prank and that the towel shall fly until Com- mencement. Actually it probably will come down shortly before, but it will cost the college about $50 to hire a steeplejack and repair the damage, Various pennants and other curi- ous objects have flown from the Psi U pole since it was dedicated in 1933. Shortly after its erection, a dead cat was hauled to the top and flew for several hours before tail and cat parted company in a high wind. Some West Point cadets> hung out an enormous Cun- ard Line banner in 1939. A pro- fessor of French found his bicycle dangling from the pole a few years later. RPI pranksters hung a Union footbalelr in effigy just be- fore the war. An ash can full of water nearly ruined the expensive pole in 1941, and spilled on the grounds crew who tried to pull it down. Psi Upsilon gave the handsome pole, located in the center of the campus, in recognition of its hun- dredth anniversary in 1933. Leroy J. Weed, '01, then and now a mem- ber of the .board of trustees, was principal sp~eaker at the dedication, Also in attendance for the function were Governors Cross of Connecti- cut, and Stephens of Rhode Island; Senator Moses of Vermont; Nicho- las Murray Butler, President of Columbia and Professor William Lyon Phelps of Yale, all Psi Us. Cost of the flagpole and the \seat of stone\ on which it is mounted totalled $2,300. Dean Huntley has suggested that the college might protect the Psi U in- vestment and save itself the main- tenance problems arising out of pranks such as the recent one by collapsing the pole somehow into an underground cavity after dark each night. Meanwhile, he sug- gests that pranksters desist from hacking the rope' ·apart, regardl~ess ·of what other evil intentions they may have. One wonders whether the Field House which seems to be progress- ing so rapidly n:ay not meet the same fate as a predecessor-over which it is n<Jw being constructed. The ill-fated forerunner, Union's last attempt at athletic construc- tion before the field house, was a hockey rinl1. The rink was built beside the college brook in 1936, but failed to survive two seasons of use. Designed by some Union College civil engineers, the rink was quite unique, in that it drew its w·ater directly from the nearby brook, whose course could be diverted through the rink by means of a dam. Remains of the dam and a large concrete retaining wal! can still be seen behind Delta Phi. Most of the forrr.er rink will be covered by the field house itself. Charlie Waldron writes of the fate of the ·hockey rink in the l:nion Alumni Magazine of Janu- ary, 1938: \the rink seems fated and what gave promise of being a very valuable piece of sports equipment continues its record of misfortune. It was bad f'nough to have the engineers overlook the terrain on which it was built, only to find when !t was completed that a ditch ran through it carrying a sewer. Excavation for the sewer had required .blasting and had made the ground so porous that the rin!1 refused to hold water. The ·situation was corrected last surr mer and it looked as if the rink might be used.\ \It was 'full of water early in Decembel'. 'The water seemed to stay at the proper level and ice had formPd. Then one morning an abandoned automobile was found near the rink and in the ice v. as a hole. \Was it a suicide? The fire department and police turned to, the water was drawn' off, the ice smashed to bits, and the rink became a shambles in no time. But no body was found. Several days later, the owner of the car, a Schenectady boy, turned up in At- lanta, Georgia. \Now 'with winter upon us and no water running in the brook that fE>eds the rinlt, our hocltey en- thusiasts are back where they were before we s11ent our $11,000.\ The World of Art By Charll's Spl'irs A striking contrast of gtyles is afforded by the current tw·o-man exhibit on view in the Old Chapel Gallery.

One thing is sure, the faculty can't sleep in tents on the dia- monds or on Library field, as then the growth of grass there might be impeded, There are two practical solutions for this problem. The fir&t would ·be to .sec1,1re a FHA loan to build permanent faculty housing. This solution, however practical, has no chance of being adopted at Union because of the Trustees' -fot:~rteenth century fear that the government and every- thing to do with it is intrinsically ev:il. However, the following solution coul'd be adopted a:t Union. The college maltes a good deal of rr.oney through it:s endowment, VI hich 'is largely invested in rea:l estate and which produces a return of aJbout .f 1 k percent. My proposal is that the ·Colelge withdraw $250;- 000 dollars from the endowment and use it to ·construct thirty pe~­ manent faculty dwellings at Dutch- man~s Village to replace the cur- rent structures. The College could charge a rent of 65 dollars per month, plus the cost of heating, for this housing. ·Out of this rent twelve dollars would adequately cover electricity, gas, water, and maintenance. The remaining 53 dollars would go into the college fund as interest. The rr.<Jney re- ceiveq as clear profit to the college would be better than six per cent, (Continued on Page 4) Guerra's Pharmaeyl Prescriptions - Dr11gs Fountain Servic:e 600 Union St. Cor.

Adelphi might harass the Garnet Williams re·bounded with two goals, when goals by Ross Saddlemire, one by John Cypiot, high scorer for DeSantis, and Dave Gregory soon E ,_ t b 1 th et•a;ck·ed th·e 1-1 tie and left the the · p .. man, 0 a am:e e score 2-2 entering the second period.

Particularly notable, according to Hall, is that campus interest in sports in general, and lacrosse in particular, has, increased enormou.s- ly ove·r previous years. When Bill Hall receives his dip- loma, this year Union will be losing a fine laJthJete and scholar, .a com- bination which is tough to beat. It will indeed be di:fficnlt to thinlt of the lacl'<Jsse team next year as it enters the Post-Hall era. Bill, perhaps the best lat'rossp playel' Union has ever known, is naturally our candidate for All-America hon&rs. It's w long- pul1, Bill, but we an hope you nm.lte it.

This seems like a g·ood time at which to repmt .p:rogress or lack of progress toward these goals. 1. To Complete the War Memol\ial Field House. As you all know, the construction of this bui1ding has been started, and we are told that we will be in the build- ing by next winter. This is undoubtedly the greatest single accomplishment of the year. JJ>oes it mean that you've learned which are the \gut' 'courses, and how much you have to study to pass an exam? Does it mean that you now know which houses have the liveliest parties, and which profe mark too hard? Does it mean that you go to your last Prom and are able to look back haughtily and say that you've been to seven others? Does it mean that you've spent four years here and know your way around the place and the people? Sure it does, but all these bits of wisdom are valueless now. They've enabled you to spend a good, happy four years away from home, but come June 13 you'll be on the move again. You'll need something more then than just a set of cloistered ideals like these. So you sit down and puzzle out just If you had it all to do over ag·ain, though, you probably wouldn't want to change one day. It's been a long time, but lt'g been fun.

One of the major advances in curriculum this yea1· has been the five-year combined course leading .to the A.B. and Engineering degrees. The new freshman class has a group of considerable size enrolled in this five year program. 4. To bring faculty, adminish-ation, and students into c:loser what these four years have really meant to you. When you came here you were an idealist; you expected. to imbibe knowledge with all the pleasure of a Hedonist. But you found out that the true meaning of knowl- edge doesn't include submitting to too-frequent exams. You >had plenty of school spirit four years ago, and you still have it. But what's hap- made a lot of good friends. But . it's all over now. \rile unknO'Wn is no longe;r ~tnknown·; it's time to move on. · These four years look good in retrospect, after all. Maybe they'll : look even better 25 years from to- day. Of one thing yo.u're sure. You · wouldn't trade these four years at Union for anything. It's been won- derful being here-11Jld it will be wonderful to leave. personal relations with one another. One of the most successful meetings of the yea!' was an informal supper discussion in the President's House among members of the Student Council, the House Presi- dents Council, and the administration in which the new policy concerning alcoholic beverages was discussed and worked out. The Tippecanoe conference was also highly 8 successful. I believe that more of this type of relation- • ship could be sought. Dr. Girdner has proved himself a very helpful personal counsellor to many students dur- ing the year. the year there have been a large number <Jf faculty mem,- bers away on s2:bbatical leaves. Next year only Pro- fessors Lowen, Bristol, and Sussman will be away. With additions such as Professor Burlin in Art, Drs. Kilburn and Nelson in English, Dr. Mozley in Biology, Professor Thomas Hoffman in Electrical Engineering, and Pro- fessor Raymond Eisenstadt in Mechanical Engineering, our faculty should be the strongest that it has been in its history. We are of course hit by the 1·~trements of Professor Male, Professor Jones, and Dr. Arony, but we hope that their replacements will soon find an important place in the life of the campus. To enlist the support of students and faculty in the en- couragement and selection of an outstanding entering class. Directors Pearson and Moon inform me that we have the largest number of applications for admission in the his- tory of the College and that the mutual acceptances to date indicate that the entering class of 1958 will .bring top scholastic ability aand leadership in athletics and 5. To help the fraternities clarify and attain their social and educational objectives. The establishment of the House Presdients CO.uncil to replace the old Interfraternity Council has mar'ked a long step in the right direction. 6. To encourage reasonable student prujicipation i~ the ac- tivities on campus. · J must confess that I have been ~omewhat discouraged about progress in this field. On the other hand, the Band ~as been better this year than at any time in re- cent history, and Lacrosse and Tennis are stagino· a other activities with them. · Obviously we hvae not reach()d ou:r goals in several .of these areas, but we have moved, I believe, in tl1e right direc- tion, and next fall we can review our situation to see where we might head during 1954-55.
