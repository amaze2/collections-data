In spite of the steady downpour and increas- ing-ly slippery field, no word was sent about to the effect that the game \you lei be postponed, and it was the duty of every Union man to be in the Garnet cheering section. For less than one third of the student body to be present was shamefu1 enough, but il'l addition comes the report that a goodly number of freshmen, and a few upperclassmen, were seen on their way to theatres downtown just before or while the game was in the summer, mostly engineers, in this kind o£ work, and I am sorry to lose them in the fall.\ Thus a man who employs thou-· sallds of men yearly answers the ac- cusation of a lack of responsibility and reliability in the college man. -A student.

McKibben of. rr================================.i the Civil Engineering department is I the author of an art-icle in the Engi-J neering News-Record of September 29, in which he describes 14 reinforced concrete structures in which chemical action has caused patrial or total fail- ures of these structures. This has ben caused by the rusting of the steel reinforcement, which in turn was the result of the chemica:! action or salt water present. The structures to which the article refers, and which were examined by J Professor McKibben, are located in I Buffalo, Atlantic City, Paris and Nice, I France, and in the British West In-1 dies. The article is timely becaus.e of\ the recent fail·ttre of a portion of a reinforced concrete roof in a large I hotel in Atlantk: City, due to corrosion of the imbedded steel. The purpoE!e 1 of the article is to call attention to the i importance of careful designing, build-' ing, and inspection, rather than to eondemn this ty-pe of construction, be- eause many thousands of such build· ings are rendering good service.

Saturday, 0 ctober 22, 1921 THE INTEIRCOLLEGIA TE CONFERENCE Prominetit among the questions before the students today is whether or not Union should be represented at the intercollegiate conference on disarmament at Princeton. The Princeton semor aouncil has as ked 71 colleges to send represl:'nta ti \·es, and Union throt1gh its president ancl its publications has been invited. The principal pnrpose of the conference, according to those in charge, is \rather to stimulate discussion oi the question in the colleges, than to seek to influence deleg2:!es to the \Nashington conference.\ relations. The foreign policy adopted . under the Wilson regime, and persist- ing unabateg under the present ad- ministra ti6n, involves the 'COI1'struc- tion of incomparably the strongest navy afloat. This policy Prof. Derry ascribed, after recounting a hitherto unpublished series of indignities and embarrassments sustained by the United States at the hands of some o\ the principals in the late war, to the grave misgivings which our highest government officials, in unofficial pro- nouncements, are at no pains. to· con- ceal in regard to the disinterestedness and good-faith of om foremost naval rivals, Great Britain and Japan.

NEW FENCE FOR ALEXANDER FIELD North Side to Be Protected By · Cyclone BarrieT-Gates Now Erected The men in charge of the campus ground-s have been busy recently erecting a t1ew fence on the north side of Alexander Field. The old fence was becoming w.eakened by rust, and dur- ing the recent football games the small boys of the neighborhood, (and others . not so small) have made a practice of going \over the top\. As a _result it was in bad shape, <tnd it was decided to remove it. The new fence is of t.he \anchor post\ type like that of the garden, being very heavy, .and with barbed wire at the top. Only the north side will be protected this fa:ll by the new wire, Mr. Walling said Tuesday, but next spring it is the intention to extend it around the back oi the gym, so that the entire field wiLl be strongly protected. A pro- position to extend the ornamental iron fence along Lenox Roa.d to the culvert back of the Delta Phi house is also be- ing oonsidered. Eventually such a barrier will be erected along Seward Place, and before many years the cam- pus will be completely surrounded, so that if desired the place can be en- tirely dosed. • The process of erecting new gates at the entrances to the field is now nearly completed. Entr~nce can now be gain- ed only through the South Lane Gate. OH, FROSH! Ftosh: Bar bah,' how long will I have to wait for a shave?\ Barber, (glancii1g at him): Oh, about two years.

Tinker, of the In-. ternational Student Y. M. C. A. will (Contributed) Students in many of the colleges are placing themselves on re- cord as being r.eady to help break the railroad strike. It seems like good sport to fire an engine or throw switches for a :few days. News- papers and employers will applaud you for doing so. My native college, thee, Fount of ras·cality, ·be one of the pri.ncipal l•eaders. Mr. PatroJLize 'Our Advertisers Bnt rem.ember that when you do so you are taking the places of men \\'ho expect to fo1low these occupations all their lives, who have to support their families from their earnings. Ask yourselves whether you would be willing to work permanently at the jqbs, under the conditions ancf for the wages which these men will be :forced to accept if the strike is lost. If not, is it good sportsmanship to help the employers defeat them? It may be sport, but is it sports- manlike? Thee do I praise. Thy widows were so tame, Now .they increase your fame, For you can see their aim, Is hell to raise. Tinker spent a large part of last year in Europe, studying student conditions there. The committee in cha;rge of the Union conference consists of William C. Ostrom, Union '23; H. L.

Section men receive only $1,049 a yar. Sixty thousand men among the strikers of one crait alone-the trainmen-receive only $1,800 .a year. _Many thousands of others make no more than $1,600, others no more than $1,200. Is this enough? How many of you could receive a college education if your fathers received wages like these? The United States 'Bureau of Labor statistics gives $2,226.47 as the minimum amount necessary to maintain a normal :family in health and decency. Wages were reduced last July. Now the railroads want to reduce them still more. In addition they are attempting to break down agreements gained by the workers during the ·war on upwards of 75 ndhoads. Operating expenses could be cut down to a point where no wage reductions would be necessary, if the employers had a genuine con- ception of public service. Instead they waste a billion dollars a y. ear. A young lady asked the C. C. whether the ynoung lady who 1s •OC- casionally· seen with a man named Chase, is named Diana because she seems to be Goddess of the Chase. How do we know? Several fraternities have already held dances. Due to the law of supply and demand the price of cosmetics has gone up. It has been estimated that if all the words, which the Union college stu- dents use in describing the intensity of t.heir devotion for chapel exercises, were placed side by side, word for word, the length of words would ex- tend approximately three and eighty- seven hundreds inches. A few days ago a certain profess'()/].\ remarking on the phrase \a dum: through operating inefficiency.

But we won't mention his name, he might incur the wraths called it. It involves their whole livelihood and it would not have been called unless they believed they had real grievances. Do you know what these grievances are? Do not rely on the newspapers for the whole story. Find out the issues involved, and then act when you are sure. the goddesses. HOW ABOUT UNION?
