Frederic A. Wyatt, Direc- tor of Alumni ARelations announced in Chapel Thursday. T ' a·boo Says SDC . The original suggestion for the fieldhouse came from the alumni. Last June, the Board of Trustees endorsed the action of the Graduate Council. Then, the alumni started planning in conjunction with the athletic staff, the admin- istration, and the college architects, l\IcKim, Mead, and White. Plants in operation at the University of Rochester, Wesleyan, Amherst, West Point, and Swarthmore have been studied or visited as well as plans for fieldhouses at Middle- bury, Trinity, Vermont, and Muhlenberg.

Building Modet•nized The renovation of the old Philo- sophy Hall capped a long and in- teresting history. It \as originally one of the buildings designed by Ramee and built in 1852 with two stories. The first movement to mod- ernize the building appeared in 1945, while Professor Peter I. Wold was Professor of Physics. Nothing was done about it until the Ameri- can Locomotive Company showed its desire to improve the laboratory \to strengthen the links between science, education, and industry.\ The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees of Union in con- sultation with Robert H. Wright decided that the two stories be re- moved and three stories erected with artificial ventilation and illumination on the second floor. During the process of demolition of the two stores, it was noted that the walls were honeycombed with scores of flues. This caused specu- lation that Eliphalet Nott, who ex- perimented with and invented non- exploding anthracite-burning boiler for Mississippi riverboats. used the building as a laboratory. Ll'('tures S~heduled After the dedication of the build- ing, the guests will attend a series of lectures and demonst1·ations. Fil·st of this series will be a lec- ture by H. B. Huntington of Rens• selaer Polytechnic Institute. This will be followed by a lecture by W. F. Westendorf of the General Elec- tric Company. After luncheon, the delegates will attend demonstration experiments given by F. J. Norton, of General Electric cCompany; A. T. Goble, of Union College; H. R. Larsen, Chief Engineer of Gurley Instrument Company. Troy; Miss Herta R. Long, Rensselaer Polytechnic In- stitute; Miss M. O'L. Crowe and A. Walker, of the Research Division of N. Y. State Department of Health; and Lewi Tonks, of G.E. A motion picture of V-2 launchings will be presented by R. W. Porter of the General Electric Company. Through feelings of pride of ac- complishment and companionship. Professor Rojansky expresses the regret that Professor Wold will not he here to see the new building. Latest tl~: Library New books offered by the li- brary this week are: \Forgotten First Citizen: John Bigelow\ by Margaret A. Clapp, a biography of a fa- mous alumnus of Union, class of 1835. ~·----------------------------- Union Host To Officers For the second time in the history of Union, the college is acting as host to the annual meeting of the Eastern Col- lege Personnel Officers meet- ing Nov. 6 through 8, in co- operation with the General Company. The theme of the meeting is \The College Grad- ate in His Job and Commu- nity\. This year, the attend- ance is expected to double the number attending the first Union sponsored ECPO meet- ing, held in 1938. Wide Participation All colleges in the New Englar.d States, New York, and New Jer- sey, and all the principle com- panies in the east will be repre- sented. Up to October 30, 132 per- sons had sir:nified that they would attend. Industry will be represent- ed by 47 delegates, including 6 women. Of the group represent- ing education, 43 are women and 42 are men. Union College will be represented by President Davidson, Mr. Frederic Wyatt, program com- mittee chairman of the organiza- tion, and Mr. William Yates. Main Speakers Scien<'e Refot·ming Dr. Noyes, cila:rman of the chem- istry department of the University of Rochester speaking as a scient- Ist said: \Since science has con tri- buted to making wars what they are today, and since scientists are among those who seem to suffeJ: most from the restrictions which have arisen from this situation, we as a group are more interest€d in the cause of international cooper- ation and in the furtherance of peace than any single group.\ In the course of his address Dr. Noyes declared that \The United States should talte a firmer stand on policy matters. Delegates from other countries have always been able to be effective because they had a prograiU which was de- veloyed by frequent discussion based on personal contact.\ Speak- ing further on the problem of United States particcipation in sci- entific discussions he said, \Some small beginnings have been made in changing this situation, and it is hoped that by the time of the next meeting in Amsterdam in 1949 to have a group of chemists thor- oughly familiar with the workings of the International Union of Chemistry and anxious to partici- pate in strengthening it.\ ---{)1---- Attention is calle>d to the fact that in cases of physical violence, stealing of pt>rsonal property etc.; whether the violator be fresh- man or upperclassman, he will he callE-d befort\ a ·board composed of faculty members aud student coWlcil membt>rs to give reasons as to why he should remain in college. ------------ ... -·--- IRC Attends Peace Panel ------- ~ Site Undecided 'Relax'-Plea Of Campbell The location has not yet been chosen but at present it is thought that the area north of the Gradu- ate Council Field, on the Dutch- men's Village side of the College Brook is the most suitable.

Education as defined by \\'ebster's :'\e\\ International Dictionary is \the act or pro- cess of educating; the impartation or acqui- sition of knov,·ledge, skill, or discipline of character; also the act or process of training b~· a prescribed or customary course of stud~· or discipline.\ In trying to reconcile the dictionary's definition and the apparent defi- nition of the word as interpreted by their instructors, the college student is, to say the least, confused. On all sides, he is faced with conflicts and inconsistencies. This feel- ing has been apparent for the last few years and has increased instead of deereased as students become acclimated to college life. Lately, however, the undereurrent seems to have increased at a rate beyond what could be considered normal. It could be that the crowded conditions and the greater competi- tion caused by the students themselves me responsible, but the students look for more cogent reasons. The reasons usually given seem to be related to the cunicula. One of the pl'ime reasons for confusion. as related b~- man~· students. is the differ- ence in the method of presentation by a sub- ject by two or more different instructors. At pt·esent, it is almost impossible to take a course that is not taught b~- more than one professor. Each one emphasizes what he thinks is important, and very seldom do two teachers in the same course emphasize the same points. At first thought, this does not seem important, but considering- that the finals are not the result of one instructor's work, the student is at a loss to know just what to concentrate on, unless he has a photographic memory. Even more confusing is the course in which the professor g-oes through the book without special emphasis on any points. So - called \elementary courses\ increase the confusion as the students who register for the course, expecting that the pmfessor believes his students have no knowled<Ye about the subject and are required to subn~t papers discussing and criticizing articles written by masters of the subjects. This condition is increased when pre-meds or engi- neering students take courses in aBilev Hall or the Social Studies majors take sci~ntific courses ,as in each case the student is forced to form concepts and abstractions entire!\· foreign to his interests. · Not in the least of their troubles, is the fact that each instructor believes his course the most important. Therefot·e, he piles on the homework, disregarding the fact that the student has four or more other subjects. In this case the student has the alternatives of neglecting other subjects or dropping the course . As one student put it, \What I get out of Course A is not in proportion to what 1 put into it, so I think I'll drop it.\ That this feeling is not limited to the average student is indicated by the fact that the stu- dent just mention has been on the Dean's List with a 4. plus index. Even the marking system comes in for its share of credit in causing confusion. Stu- dents cannot rationalize their class averages of 40 or 50 per cent on hour exams. College Let's All Be Miserable By A. J. I<;astel'bl'ool< From the excessively hot end to the sum- mer, through the beautiful and temperate period of the last few weeks we have now arrived in the week encting November 8th. The lenves, so l'ichly coloured during thr fall have at last dropped from the trees and the branches arE' naked ag-ainst the ~ovem­ ber gky. ~chenectady has ~uffered uuder min, winct and cold this last week but llnion College has gTovellect under an e\·en gTeater hnrd~hip. On every side stuctents have been :wen bearing huge volumes of notes, gigantic text bool\s and worried expressions. This has bL'l'H a week of huut· tests. Those unfor- tunate being-s secure in the knowledge that they have scoi'ed an .-\ average smirk sel.f'- consciously as they stroll along· in the shad- ows of Baile~· Hall, the Physics building m· l!ale House. The men whe) are quite certain that their work has netted them straig·ht F's are happy that their hour of trial has passed. These two categories, however, do not exhaust the student body. What of those who are biting their finger nails down to the quick'? The~· will have to worry and wait until next week to hem· the results of their puny efforts. Thus it is that whatever the outside world may experience in the way of weathet· next week, these creatures \'ill live under a cloud of uncertaint~·. The end of next \Veek however, November l:Jth, is a time that has stood out large in the minds of most of u:s here at Lnion. To some it will be a week-end of jolification, to others a chance to get out of Saturday classes; but to the great majority, it will be the time when thev will know finally which Dean's List they wiil appear in. Is it significant that at the Dance in the Alumni Gymnasium the colour of the male dress will be black\? Despondency is writ large on every side. We remark cheerfully to our neighbours that it has been a lovely summer but with an air of intense satisfaction add that it must theretore follow that we shall have a per- fectly awful winter. To bolster up this con- clusion we point to the rain, the mists, the temperature, even to the number of Commu- nists that .Senator Brewster has discovet·ed in the Blankville LacHes Knitting Circle! Certain!~· the \Veather is disgusting, certainly it will get worse, it is absolutely certain that we shall be thrown out of College in the very near future. Let's all be mberable_ How long can this state of affairs last? In two weeks time it will be Thanksgiving. .Several da~·s will be spent in gorging turkey and we shall return to Schenectady just in time for the really cold weather and, dare it be said, more hour tests. The time b e t w e e n Thanksgiving and Christmas will be cheerfully filled with fore- casts of the number of feet of snow that will grace the campus this winter and before we have gathered our wits we shall be slipping and cursing our wa~· behveen the dorrni- toJ·ies and the classrooms. When it is actual- ly snowing there is absolutely nothing to look forward to, nothing but more snow and more snow and more. But stop, there is still some- thing else that can be forecast-the end of the snow. Can't you just hear those who ski cursing the fact that there will only be one more outing, and just as they had it taped too. Wherever we look and at whatever time of the year we find someone groaning under insuperable odds. Sure it's raining, slll\e it's going to snow, probably worse than it ever did before so let's all be miserable. students are matriculated supposedly be- cause they are the pick of the high school pupils. AI e the instructors trying to ex- amine their students Ot' outguess them'? Last, but not least, there is quite a bit of pressure on all students to particiuate in extracurricular activities in their spare time. To which the students reply, \What spare time?\ Are these causes unrecognized by the pro- fessors; are they recog-nized but tolerated to develop discipline; or are they designed to decrease the enrollment? Letter to the Editor D0ar Sir: This letter was prompted by last week's editorial \Fail' DPal or Fast Shuff!~?\ We use the world \ed-itorial\ rhetoricaUy; it mig-ht, more appropriately, be termed \malicious and fallacious nonsense.\ In the futun>, we suggest that the editor-in-chief entrust the composition of the paper to more competent <at l<'ast better informed) personnel. Fol' the present wo> shall l>e concerned with the undoing, as far as possible, of damage already wrought. 'Fo this end, if each reader wiJ.l recover last week's paper from the wast<' baskPt and spread it before him, we shall indi- l'ate many of the unsound generalities and distor- tions of fact to be found in this harangue. Begin with the second paragraph. The words \incidPnts\, \mpmhprs\, a·nd \vie\\·s\ hPcarne si-ngular in the second sentence and remained so throughout. \lneidents\ was translated \opposition\ but, as we shall show, was never pstablished; '\members\ be- came \Coordinator of Student Activities\ for reasons not va.Jid; and \views\ we shall leave to you. In sp(•aking of the Coordinator, the author men- tions \control of campus organizations\ as a duty \not implied' by the title of the Coordinator. He d<>t'S not support his U\'' of the word \control\ nor <loPs h<' dt>nHmstrate any profound knowledge of what the duties of the Coordinator are. Then you find \The facts are:\ staring you in the face. Let us point out the 1·easuns why this is a misnomer. Th<' editor reports that administrative approval of the American Veterans Committee has been sought sine<' March 1946, while in reality the fil'st petition rpceived was received in May, 1947. He g-oes on to say \Tht•y have been l'efused a meeting place on campus.\ They have not been refused; in fact, one meeting was held, prior to his artie!!', in Old Chapel. No group of students is ever denied a meetiug place on the campus. Later we read \But now we must give you the be- hind the scenes details,\ whatever this may imply, for nothing has been hidden from view. Then. \The Committee on Student Affairs and Relations will not allow a member of A VC to attend its meetings.'' Thc•se met>tings are closed to everyone, including A VC members, regardless of the topic at hand. 'l'here is no discrimination here. That bubble or righteous- ness was followed by anothpr geb, to-wit: \Instead the committee will malte its decision on the basis of a report by the sub committee assigned.\ As a point of information, every item coming befol'e the committee is assigned to a sub committee. That is the normal procedure for the recognition of any gruup by the Student Affairs and Relations Com- mittee. Does that fact destroy the inference of the !'ditorial? It does, but there is still his point of \undemocratic procedure\ to contend. If he could show us a democratic institution that did not employ committees as an expediency. we would concede him a point. However. courts have jul'ies; congress has committees; and, in all probability, the AVC has committees also. The next point of issue is \were it not for the fact that the Coordinator· is ehairman of the sub committee.\ The Coordinator is, after all, a member of th_e body and subject to appointment; and no mentiOn of the fact, that he asked to be excused but was obliged to accept at the insistance of the ehairman. was made. Then, via the route of hearsay, the coordinator is attributed with a statement regarding the AVC which Is de~ied oy him and unsupported elsewhere. Followmg this occurs a gross distortion of fact, which ~an hardly be construed as anything but intentional, masmuch as the o.uthor was informed by the Secl'e· tary of the Student Council as to the exact wol'ding of th~ motion. The author reported the Student Cou_ncil as havi~g \passed a resolution recomm!'nding demal of perm1ss10n for th!' A VC chapter\ whereas the Council resolution re'commended that the AVC ~?t ~e allowed to. use the name of Union College in 1t s title. The ed1to_r _continued by stating that the resolution was precipitated by a discussion \started FRIDAY, NOV. 7, 1'947 · ou uessed i.t.\ Such was not the case. ~r:;;-~~~·rJnat~·. an ex-officio memher of the Council !

George· Best, 18 year old sophomore from Scotia, played a spectacular game at quarterback and scored both touchdowns.

He netted the first score on a 40 yard l'}ln on the sixth play of the game, and made the second tally on a line plunge from the ten yard marker during the second quarter.

Panthevs Will Be Hard The Dutchmen will not only be looking for their third win of the season tomorrow afternoon; but they will also be out to break up the 17 game series which started in 1903 and now stands at six games won by each team with four· of the contests ending in draws.

During the second period the Scotia sophomore ar.ain climaxed a sustained drive fr·om midfield to the Purple ten yard stripe, by going aH the way on a center plunge .for Ur ion's second tally.

For the Purple, it was a different story. They too started the game minus •heir star back, Pat Higgins who was suffering a sprained ankle from the Williams tilt with the Eng.ineers of Troy. Grabbing at a 'ast chance the Williams coach sent Higrins into the game in the last ten minutes of play. Higgins came up fairly well to his advance notices by getting off several fair runs for some yardage; but his llresence was not enough for the Ephmen who were still held score- less by a hard hitting Union squad. Ken Whalen's punting ability contributed in no small measure to the Garnet victory. It was largely through Whalen's gifted foot that the Ephmen always found themselves with their backs to their own goal post on first downs.

Williams took the race 23-32 last Saturday over the Williams course by copping the first three places. Union showed fine finishing bal- ance by placing in the next four positions with Culver, Garlock, Belanger, and Wright finishing in that order within 13 seconds of each other. Brightman was tenth in the race, 1 minute, 10 seconds behind Culver. Union was 30 sec- onds too late all the way down the line, but this was against the best team in the history of Williams College, according to Plansky, Williams' cross-country coach. Ketzmen Run Well Their course record is 21 minutes, 1 second. The first three men in for Williams ran in 21 minutes, 14 seconds; 21 minutes, 23 seconds; and 21 minutes, 36 secor.ds. The Ketzmen ran well, but were not able to better this exceptional strength shown by Williams this year. Bellanger and Wright ran the best races of their careers last Saturday, which is a credit both to them and to Union. Wednesday afternoon of this week, Coach Ketz sent his charges over the 3 mile course, conditioning them for the Middlebury tomorrow. Garlock, Culver, ar.d Belang.er ran it between 15 minutes, 30 seconds, and 15 minutes, 45 seconds, which is good time. Loomis has rejoined the squad this week and will make the trip to Middlebury.

They previously won over R.P.L 24-33, and Bt·ooklyn Poly 15-40. Middlebury beat Trinity 25-30 last Saturday:, which doesn't, however, give any indication of the compara- tive strength of Union and Middle- bury. Last year, Middlebury beat us 26-29. The run is over a golf course, .and according to Coach Ketz, a good course in dry weather. 0 Collegians Score Win Over Duanesburg as Canez Leads Squad The Collegians, Union College's unofficial representative in the I local soccer circles, notched their first win of the season last Sunday when they plowed through the Duanesburg Dominoes in an im- pressive 5-0 victory at Duanesburg. Previously the Collegians had dropped two and tied one, but with the best foot forward, the locals now eagerly await their meet with Amsterc'am next Sunday, when the Garnet steps up into the Reserve Div.ision. Outstanding in last week's game were Canez who scored twice, and Marvin Cellande and Bt•ookline who scored one goal each for the Collegians.

They will be ably supported by other seasoned actors. The play itself takes place on the Brooklyn waterfront at Canar- sie. Such places as Steeplechase Pier and Sheepshead Bay are im- portant scenes in the show. Brook- lyn Night Court also enters into the picture, as does a steam bath. The production staff has been working hard the past few weeks to complete the difficult scenery that includes two level stages, rock- ing boats and the aforementioned steam bath. With only two more night of grueling rehearsals to endure, the cast is all in high spirits and expect to present excellent performances. ---01--- Blodgett Edits Cultural Work The purpose of the lecture series on so vital a topic is, in the words of Dr. C. Victor Brown, \to help people develop a clearer under- standing of phychological, emotion- al and moral factors that make for wisdom in courtship and harmony in marriage,\ The third lectur.e will be deliv- ered by Mrs. Wilma D. Scott on Tuesday, Nov. 18th. It is entitled \Factors that make for harmony in marriage.\ The concluding lec- ture wi!J be concerned with the physical factors in marriage with Dr. Charles Godcharles speaking. The successful response to the lecture series by the .Jarge number in attendance was said to have brought this comment from an in- terested party, \It's the largest ~t­ tendance for a function that d1d not receiv.e credits for chapel attendance.\ ----o---- Chester Arthur Will be Honored Chester A. Arthur, whose lifelike statue looks off across the campus from where it stands behind the Nott Memorial Library, is to be honored during the annual Found- ers Day ceremonies in February.

Union, Elmira Clubs The traditional Union-Ham- ilton football rivalry moves to Alexander Field Saturday aft- ernoon at 2 :00 p.m. with Union ruling the heavy fa- vorites to win its final game of the year. The record now stands at twenty wins apiece, eleven ties, eight of which have been scoreless. This is the game of the year when statistics are tossed to the wind, the underdog often surprising with a win. Last year, Union was favored and Hamilton defeated the Garnet team 7-6. It has long been tradition that every victory by Hamilton over L'nion be celebrated by the tolling of the bells in Clinton throughout the night and Sunday morning. The Dutchmen are de- t~rmined that this year Clinton will be a quiet town. It is fortunate for Union that the game breaking the tie should be played in Schenectady. Since the start of the series, Union has only managed to beat the Buff and Blue three times on Hamilton territory. The \jinx\ has been almost unbeat- able. The rivalry, the oldest intercolle- giate rivalry in New York State, began in 1889 with Union the victor by a 26 to 10 score. It wasn't until the third year of the series that Hamilton came through with a win, the score being 14-6. The tradi- tion of having the two teams close their respective seasons against each other started in 1912. So far this year, Hamilton has defeated only Wagner. The score on that one was 13-7. They have lost to Harwick by 20-0, Oberlin by 20-7, Rochester U. by 48-7, Hobart 19-7, and Haverford by 00-0. On the other hand, Union has won two games, beating Vermont by 20-7, and Williams by 14-0. Union lost to Rochester by only 18-13 and to Hobart by a 6-0 score. Union's other losses include a 27-6 loss at the hands of St. Lawrence, a 33-24 loss to RPI and a 26-12 loss to Mid- dlebury. Sam Donahue, billed as America's most creative composer an·anger, a formidable title indeed, will play for the dancing couples and if we can believe reports from Wi!iiams College he will undoubtedly live up to it, At approximately midnight-half time-there will be an interval, when members of Fraternities and their partners will retire to their booths on the upper floor; and neutrals, who do not wish to take advantage of any invitations they may have, may find resting places in the booth belonging to the off- campus men. During this time, the assembly will be soothed by the singing of Songs of the Gay Nine- ties by the Union College Octet. Later, the Octet will lead a bout of community singing and then, on with the dance. Hangover Day At two in the morning, the offi- cial celebrations will cease; and it would perhaps be better to continue with an account of what is to hap- pen later on, on Saturday. During the week the various Fra- ternities have been busy devising decorations for their houses. The (Continued on Page 6) ---o--- Dancing Classes; Prancing Lasses Girls! Do you find that your date is exceptionally light on his feet and yours too? Is he tripping the light fantastic with a smoothness you thought unimaginable? Do his size twelves seem as if they were eights? Prof. Harold W. Blodgett, chair- man of the English department, has completed and turned in to the pub- lisher the manuscript of the revised edition of \The Roots of National Culture\ an anthology of Am·erican Literature from its beginnings to 1830. This volume Is one of a series entitled \American Litera- ture: A Period Anthology\ issued by the Macmi!Ion Company under the general editorship of Prof. Oscar Cargill of New York Univer· sity.

AI teaches dancing faster than Murray!! For several weeks those men who have desired to brush up on their dancing and learn the newer and more popular steps have been able to do so as the result of \The Roots of National Culture\ was originally edited fourteen years ago by Prof. Robert E. Spiller of th-e University of Pennsylvania, who shares with Prof. Blodgett the co-editorship of the revised edition. In the revision the volume has been doubled in size. some two hundred thousand words being added. Besides many additions there was enlargement of existing sections on Ben Franklin, Thomas Paine, Alex- and·er Hamilton and Thomas Jeffer- son among others. A concluding section on Indian literature h·as also been enlarged to include, among other items, a selection from the early Indian treati-es. Editorial aids in the volume include full annotation and biographical sketches a.s wei! as prefatory essays. On Saturday, November 22, 1947, at 8:30 P. M., the Union College Glee Club and the Elmira College Glee Club wi!J present a joint con- cert of secular and religious music in the Union College Memorial Chapel. The Elmira Glee Club, under the direction of Mr. Gwynn S. Bement, consists of approximately 87 girls, to which v. ill be added the voices of the 43 members of the Union glee club. The attire for the c?n- cert will be full dress, the gtrls wearing formal gowns and the boys wearing tails. The tentative schedule calls for the arrival of the girls at three o'clock on Saturday. The two glass clubs will rehearse together until five, at which time they will eat dinner in Hale House. After dinner the girls will be met by the people at whose homes they will stay for the night. The concert is at 8:30, and if present plans go through, wilJ be followed by a dance in the mess hall at Hale House. Plans for this dance are being made by the Social Chairman, Art Welsh. On Sunday, the two glee clubs will sing together in the morning chapel servke at eleven o'clock. The service wil! be broadcast over WG'4, from 11:15 until 12:00. The job of finding houses in which the girls may sleep Saturday night has been handled by Mr. Van Voast of the Union Alumni Council, Mrs. William Bennett of the Facul- ty Wives' Club' and Miss Sally Elck of the Elmira College Club. The two groups expect to pre- sent the following selections: Sacred Group-- The Three Ships, Colin Taylor; Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming, Michael Praetorius; 0 Holy Night, Adolph Adam; Christ- mas Song, Gustav Holst.

This ~·ear, we shall forego any such unnecessary references_ The prom should be an unqualified success, the guests undoubtedly beautiful (even more so as the weekend progresses) and the hosts happy. That finishes our stint and brings us to a traditional piece of humo1· perpetrated by one of our predecessors slaving for the Concordiensis in 1942. We have been accused in the past of being rather drab for lack of humo1·, but perhaps this alone will com- pensate for all past seriousness: welcome, girls who come this weekend welcome, from this far from meek end welcome you dear Skidmore's suzie ' .

Editor, The Concordiensis, Washbur·n Hall, Union College. Dear Sir: November 11, 1947 In the Concordiensis of November 7 I was mistakenly credited with planning the program of the meeting of the New York State Section of the American Physical Society at which our South Physics Laboratory was dedicated on November 8. The excellent program was in fact arranged by the following committee: G. H. Car- ragan of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, J. F. Co!Uns of the Mont Pleasant High School, A. T. Goble of Union College, F. J. Studer of the GenE'ral Electric Company, and Hugh Templeton of the State Education Department. Mr. Studer, who is also Research Professor of Physics at our college, was chairman of this committee. Special acknowledgment for the success of the nl<>E'ting is also due Professor Goble, who was in charge of the local arrangements, Sincerely yours, V. Rojansky Crowding the Line Although this subject may prove to be distasteful to many of our compatriots, the time has come to mention cuts and absences. Gmnted few of us lose too much sleep over the matter, this being especially true this weekend. But for those hardy souls who al'e flirting with their cut limits, this is a last minute attempt to tell them that they are also flirting with sure disaster. In the past, over-cutting was tolerated almost paternally by the administration. Action was taken only in extreme cases. However, if you are still operating in bliss- ful ignorance, the Committee on Student Standing is no longer playing games. Crowd- ed conditions, increased application and low- ering of the college average have been fac- tors in this change of mind. As a convincer, we might mention that six men were \re- lieved of their duties\ last year. This may only lJe a beginning. In the Right Direction On several occasions during the past year, we have published rather critical comments on the religious program and its director here at Union. If criticism was rightfully due in other matters, we should be equally assiduous in giving- credit where it is due. After a considerable wait, we have found our opening. It is the newly-instituted lec- ture series sponsored by the Christian Asso- ciation on Sex, :Marriage and Courtship. In the main, the series is intended for married veterans, but many others have attended. Too often, institutions, fearful of trans- gressing social taboos and alienating the community, have bypassed this vital matter. Too often, college merely perpetuates the misconceptions and guilt complexes previous- ly acquired by the student. In this light, we believe that the Chaplain should be con- gratulated for recognizing that sex education is one of the responsibilities of the educa- tional system, although it is a sad com- mentary on our cultural values that this education must be conducted on a college level at all. ----------------------------------- Kappa Alpha, Our First Fraternity Early in the school year of 1825 John Hart Hunter, Issac W. Jackson. Thomas Hu~, and Arth~r Burtis Jr. were conspicuous for their leadership and intelligence in Union College. Between thf' four, friendship had deepened into comradeship. To the imaginative mind of John Hunter came a vision of a new type of student association; his rev~­ lation to the three comrades met a sj-·mpathetJc response. \The yearning of the u~salisfied w.as f?r fellowship of kindred souls and 1ts expresswn m organization.\ Five others of the upper classes were admitted to the inner cirC\Ie. Conferences led to the maturity of a plan. On November 26. 1825. a meeting was held. As many times before, so then, history was being made unaware. . The meeti.ng was the genesis of the Greek letter social fratermty sys- tem in American colleges. This initial meeting was held in John Hunter's room. It was the spacious chamber still to be found on the fourth floor of old South College, South Section, on the college campus. Shortly after that the first formal initia- tion was held, and three other undergraduates became members of the society. The ritual was gradually taking form. and the Key was selected as the badge by which all Kaps wer~ to be !mown, a square disc pendant from one angle. As the mt>mbers grew in numbers, they moved into the Philomathean Hall across the corridor from John Hunter's room and held their meetings there. In the course of time, North College became Kap headquarters. About 1867 they moved downtown behind the old Givens Hotel, and in 1877 an abode was taken over the old Schenectady post office on Wall Street. They remained there until the first lodge was built. The early years were a period of ordeal for Kappa Alpha, in part because of the intense riva!ry of the new societies, still more because of Wide-spread hostility to the principle represented. The term \secret\, bestowed at nativity upon the Greek letter fraternity system, has been for it the source of woes unnumbered. Measures repressive and oppressive were adopted by the college faculty. The_ maj?rity of the students waged bitter war Upon the assocmtes who were enrolled in the \secret\ and exclusive society. But the Kaps merely assumed a more im- penetrable veil of secrecy than before, and the Governors of the College finally saw that their efforts were fruitless. No one was expelled from the college, and anti-secret opposition slowly dwin- dled away. The chapter's first home was built in 1901 and stood until the end of the first World War when its limitations were severely felt. In the spring of 1924 sufficient funds had been collected to warrant im- mediate construction of a new home. The new lodge was completed in the fall of that year on the same plot of ground occupied by the first lodge. In ex- terior architectural design it harmonizes with the older college buildings. The Union chapter or Kappa Alpha has contributed a great deal to the coll~ge. The Union Alma Mater was written by a Kap, Fitzhugh Ludlow, who was also the author of the \Terrace Song\ most popular of undergraduate ditties at Union. Captain Jackson, one of thl' founders, created the beautiful college garden. named for him. Among the more distinguished Kaps is Rev. Sam- uel McCrea Cavert, a delegate to World Conferences of Churches in 1928, 1937, and 1938, and author of several volumes on religious subjects. Since 1921, he has been General Secretary of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America. W. L. Mc- Kenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada, is a Kapp from the Toronto chapter, and Lt. General Andrews G. L. McNaughton is a McGill Kap. Thus was Kappa Alpha originated, the oldest member and the acknowledged parent of the vast college social fraternity system. . . , . when there is a good· wind and you .

The crumbling ruins of the ancient cathedral and its once pretentious bishop's castle, the sea battered stone pier jutting out into the bay, and the wind eroded stones of the Collegiate Church of St. Salvator all give rise to a feeling, when you walk down the street, that the world has run backward four hun- dred years. At night, wh-en the soul - searing mercury arc street lamps are turned out to save power after midnight, and only the old, dim, square gas lamps light the way, one would hardly be surprised to s·ee the founder of the Univer- sity, Bishop Wardlaw, step out of the remains of his palace and wan- der over to the United College quadrangle to see what has become of his offspring since he gav-e it its initial sanction in 1411. At four dif.ferent spots in the town there are markers in the pavement indicating that some per- son was martyred by fire there. There is one such marker right in front of the main gate of the col- lege quadrangle and bejants and be jan tines (first year students) are warned that no one treads on the spot. A chat with some of the more imaginative members of the community often brings out a story of some number of spirits who walk abroad in the old ruins at one time or another. The University itself is more deeply bound by tradition than even the oldest of our American Universities. This is the only one of the four Scotch Universities which still maintains the practice of wearing scarlet gowns as stand- ard academic dress. It presents a colorful picture contrasted against the sombre black of the traditional scholars robe as is worn at Oxford and Cambridge. Every Sun day morning following the chapel serv- ice, all those who are up and around walk down to the water- front and out on to the stone pier. Coming back, th-e men climb up on the narrow upper level and march back single file while the women stay down on \safe\ ground. It is a bit of a trick to walk on top Letters to the Editor The Editor of Concordiensis Dear Sir: Cries of anguish have been heard recently in one outstanding college course, to the effect that class members are unable to break down that course into a page or two of single - syllabled summary. When one cannot boil down the material covered to the dimensions of a few crib notes, it is obvious that exami- nations cannot be prepared for and \hit\ with ninety-nine per cent cer- tainty. All of this is infinitely dis- tasteful to the by no means slender portion of Union men, whose pri- mary interest in college life is the making of prettily-shaped letter grades of the \A\ or \B\ variety. When confronted with a subject handled on a rather mature level, embracing various d-ebatable con- cepts and attempting an objective, Catholic approach to difficult ma- terial, this vociferous group feels its security threatened, its sense of academic propriety outraged, Pre- dictability has flown, and no amount of frenzied warmup on the evening before an exam can guar- antee successful pursuit of the treasured grade. stretch oHt the legs aft·er sittmg wiN be placed on one of the othe1 through the chapel service.

Now my usual procedure is to open the other eye and slowly drift into a state of consciousness, but this morning I received a rather violent shock which served to force both eyes open at ONce ... My room-mate missing since Friday night, had come home, and, moreover, looked as though he was breath- in.g normally which was quite amazing at the time, consid- ering what the poor innocent boy had just been exposed to, his first prom week-end.

However, the experts admittedly have achieved an excellent average in answering most of the thirty- five questions which have been tossed at them auring the two weeks the program has been on the air, Siesel said yesterday. Fashioned after the former \Re- maining Starting\ radio show, the new version \Tues. 7:30, 640 on the diall consists of questions sub- mitted by students, ar.d directed by Siesel at four faculty members, two permanent and two f uest experts.

A brief account of his :life is given and of the steps in. ·his successful career in the oH indus- try which have elevated him to his present position of Vice President and General Manager of the Cities Servict> refinery at La'ke Charles, La. This refinery is rated as one of the world's finest. rettes. Not always is the program a seri- ous exchange of questions and answers, Siesel explained, and men- tioned one incident. The question was: \the road to \where the devil is housed) is paved with good in- tentions. Although the experts answered unsuccessfully, Prof. Larrabee drew laughter when he said it was likely written by \anon.\ Once upon a time a baseball catcher complained because his roommate ate horned animal crackers in bed. What was the the r.ame of that catcher? The experts puzzled over this for some time, and final!~· gave up. The catchet· was none other than Ossie Schteck. It was Rube Waddell. the great pitcher, who ate the animal crackers in bed. And who was the famous auto racer who became Mayor of In- dianapolis. Surely the experts would know this, but they didn't. It was Ab Jenkins of course. Naming three plays in which ap- peared love passages from Shakes- phere also cefied all the logic and analysis mustered by the experts. One was \there's begging in the love that can be reckoned,\ \An- thony and Cleopatra) and another was \love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee\ 'Henry VIII>. Professors Coffin and Larrabee are permanent experts on the pro- gram. Guest experts thus far have been Dean William Huntley and Professors Benjamin Whitaker, Orin Fan·ell and William Murphy.

His topic was \Grounds for Optim- ism,\ In his opinion, optimism was a kind of eleventh commandment \without which the other ten must fall.\ He pointed out the growing cynicism of a great many persons and showed that it was not some- thing common only to the \Post- Hiroshima\ era. By way of evid- ence he chose some statements from a book by Lincoln Stephans written just previous to the first World War, during an era now be- ing regarded with some nostalgia. Dr. Moore recalled that Mr. Ste- phan referred to his era as one in which the spirit of graft and l;'LW- breaking was \the American spirit.\ The fundamental characteristic of American civilization is not ill- ness, as some would have us bel lieve, but rather a growing pessim- ism due to the increasing com- plexity of life. For examples, he chose the traffic situation, the in- creased size of the field of knowl- edge, and the problems Involved in the recent attempt to solve the tariff problem. He felt that mod- ern man could not specialize his ethics to match the strides of science. exhibit consists of reproductions of term Freshmen. famous French masterpieces in- clud·ing works from Fouquet to Cezanne. The paintings are on dis- play in the corridors and the rooms of the building. The exhibit is the first of a series of exhibits that will be presented by the Language Department this year. Starting next week there will be on display a show of 19th Century Mexican engravings which were lent to the department by the Fan-American Union. The Language Building will be open for visitors who wish to see the exhibit on Friday evening and Saturday aftemoon from 2 to 5 P.M. Students, Faculty and the general public are invited. 0 Send Suggestions For Fieldhouse The chairman of the Memorial Committee, Frereric A. Wyatt, is very anxious to receive suggestions from the students as to their desires and tastes concerning the field- house that will be constructed on the campus in the early 50's. While planning is in the forma- tive stage and only the preliminary drawings have been received from the architests the committee feels that the students are in closer touch with the needs and the uses of the proposed fieldhouse. The fieldhouse will be used for many sports including Football, Baseball, Track, Lacrosse and other racquet spirts, Basketball, Boxing and Wrestling and Handball. The· dirt infield will suffice for many of these sports while rooms will be provided in the case of others. All students are invited to make their opinions known by writing to the Memorial Committee In care of F. A. Wyatt's office in the Well's House located on campus. The cost for the structure must be kept within the planned $500,000 ex- penditure and if that is to be done some sports will be sacrificed as far as individual requirements are concerned. In the breakdown of figures, 283 students are ·on the Dean's List. (The November marking period for 1946 found 282 men on the Dean's List with fewer men in college.) T,here are 116 men on Scholarship warning. (The 1946 figure for the ad-interim report was 56 men on warning.) With 290 first term stu- dents enrolled in college and with further breakdown it is discovered ~ ~ ~ ~ BOX SCORE At the Dean's Office that in Term One there are 38 men on the Dean's List and 48 men on Scholarship warning. Term Two with 98 students has 15 men .on the Dean's List and 7 on warning. Term Three with 430 men has 79 on the honor list and 35 on warning. Term Four with 141 men has 17 men on the honor list and 6 on the warning llst. Term Five with 204 men has 41 men on the Dean's List and 13 on the warning !st. Term Six with 125 men has 32 on the Dean's List and 4 on Scholar- ship warning. Term Seven with 148 men has 39 on the honor list and 3 on warning. Term Eight has 50 men with 19 on the Dean's List and 0 men on warning. Prom Is Success The recent Gridiron Ball was adjudged to be the most suc- cessful ball held by the IFC. Profit on the dance and all its ramifications amounted to ap· proximately $600 which will re- vert to the college by one means or another. The IFC has sev- eral projects in mind, one of them being that the money be contributed to the Fieldhouse Fund. The IFC also announces that three of its members will be representatives at the annual National interfraternity Council meeting in New York City on the weekend of November 29th. Fraternities Vie for Cup In .Beat Hamilton Contest Originality and cleverness of execution as determined by the judging committees were the factors that were con- sidered in awarding the first prize for the best fraternity house decoration to the Kappa Alpha group. The prize was a cup which will be a permanent acquisition of the Kapps. Sponsored by the Inter-Fraterr ity • Council the judges of the contest WRUC I H t T were Dean and Mrs. C. W.

The Three More Times With shows Wednesday and Thursday nights behind them, the players have three more to give, tonight, tomorrow afternoon and tomorrow night. At last reports almost all tickets for tonight's and Saturday night's performances were sold out and only tickets for the Saturday matinee remained avail- able. Tickets may l>e bought at the box office or at the mail room to- morrow n1orning. The play itself is about two mild old men, Jonah Goodman and Philip Ananos, played by Art Cohen and Vin DeBaun, respectively, who de- sire nothing more than peace and quiet and the right to catch a few f fish from their small boat, the 1 Enterprise III. Early in the play trouble rears its ugly head in the form of Harold Goff, played by Bob Riesner. Goff is a shakedown ar- tist selling protection against pi- rates in Sheepshead Bay. The story is a mixture of humor and pathos in the lives of the ordinary people in this world. After the judges viewed each ex- hibition they discussed them and the KA's triumphed over the Phi Delta Theta's and the Sigma Chi's who were very close in the final balloting. Pictured above is the KA exhibition; the Phi .Delts came up with a novel and quite startling exhibit, a large replica of the Idol with the remains of a Hamilton footballer (dummy of course) clutched in the jaws. The lighting effect showed it up very well. The Sigma Chi's took advantage of 96-0 score, Union on the long end, to decorate a large billboard front- ing the porch of their house. The Beta's while not outdoing them- selves were quite original for over their porch was a large sign hav- ing written on it in large imposing conference is being held to coordin- More Work Planned ate network activities in this re- Casting will begin Monday night gion.

The question uppermost in many a hungry chapelgoer's mind, what is Skid- more's answer to civilization's increasing special- ization, was cunningly evaded.

The difficult sets wet·e extremely well done, but the interminable length of the eleve~ scene chll;nges on tne opening mght were mex- cugaJbly !<mg. Such a handicap 2;1- most tended to bt·eak the dramatte continuity. However, on the sec· ond night, the changes were ac- complished in less than half the time. The Mountebanks' players can nut be judged .by the intenti(')n. o.f t_h_e playwright, bnt only by theu uti!t- zation of the macerial suppHed by the auth(')r. Shaw's play ranks as a leading achievement in the Am- erican Theater In the past twenty years, despi·te several weaknesses. The .play is structurally pliable ~.nd p(')ssesses thA qualities of \good thea:ter;\ and the cast bas d(')ne a notably go(')d job in making mani- fest the symbolism that lies behind Shaw's taut script. But there are several insta:nces where some mem- bers of the cast were at a loss as to what to do when they weren't speaking their lines. Mr. Robbins, who played the part of the Judge, pr(')bably lacked the time plus ex- perienced assista:nce to enable him to properly organize and prepare careful stage directions. This reviewer can not expect pet·- fection; he would undoubtedly be unable to recognize it if it were to pass his way. And yet the Mountebanks, breaking with the current Little Theater convention of aping capital successes, achieved the tenderness and strength of gentle people.

Tomorrow at 2 p.m. on the G!·ad- uate L.ouncH J:<ie1<1 the annua:l faH Intramural class games for the 188'1 Lact·osse L'rophy will take place. l'ne L;iass 01 1951 will play the \cpnoa and the winners w!H meet the team victorious in the .J umor- :::ienior competition. Sophs Heavily Favored The Sophomores are the heavy favontes with the largest number oi termer lacrosse players. The J umors are defir;itely in the run\ ning and although not up to the Glass of '50 in the number of play- ers, may turn out to be the dark horse in the final competition. The JH'osh are sporadic and make up what they lack in numbers by con- dition and fight. Rumor has it, however, that several of the fresh- man football squad will augment and strengthen the class represen- tation. The seasoned senior outfit will need exceptional staying power in view of their dirth of numbers. Potentially the Class of '48 is a serious threat to the younger stick- men. Byron G. George, varsity captain for '48, will lead the sophomore team. Charles W. Reeb is orga- nizing and sparkplugging the '49ers. The captaincy of the '51 club will be shared by Carr, Matt, and Wag- ner. In the senior ranks pouglas Barry, Gerald Coonan, and Frank B. Ketcham will pilot the team. In the managerial ranks William S. Anderson, Jr. has the Sopho- mores well in hand. James A. Baar, varsity managet', will handle the Juniors. While Richard E. Geyer's interests will be with the Sophomores, he has been asked to assist the Seniors, and Peter D. Fyfe has the '51 situation under complete control. Flynn A wa1•ded Lacross Trophy James A. Flynn, defenseman, was awarded the annual trophy as the most valuable member of the 1947 squad. The presentation was made in Chapel on Thursday as part of the letter awarding cere- monies. Candidates Continue PractiCl' With over 125 lacrosse aspirants in college, the coaching staff, con- sisting of Die Balch '41 ar.d Fred Wyatt '32 is optimistic. Practice sessions will continue on the Graduate Council Field until the weather forces the squad indoors. The daily practices are aided con- siderably by the use of the lighting facilities installed by the Depart- ment of Athletics on the· field.

With the 194 7 season behind them the Dutchmen are looking forward to a highly successful season next year. Uf the 38 men on the squad all but three are returning next year. Hal Enstice, Tom Crone and .l:\ete Spezzano are the three seniors who linished up their football careet·s at Union last weekend. Now thoroughly familiar with their T formation, which Coach Jack McLaughry inaugurated in midseason anc. further bolstered by the almost complete return of this year's squad; tne Dutchmen may well be on the brink of a new era in Garnet football. So effective was Coach McLau- ghry's introduction of the T for- mation that of their three wins, two were made while the Dutch- men were cperating out of the T. With each game, victoi'Y or loss, adding experience to an enthusi- astic squad in capable hands, the Garnet may indeed look forward to a highly successful season on the gridiron next year. Hamilton Swamped The Garnet finale last week-end was a personal victory for the Union captain Hal Enstice, who in the last game of his career at Union rolled up more yardage rush- ing than the entire Hamilton squad, while the entire Garnet squad roll- ed up 158 yare's. Carrying the ball twenty times Enstice compiled 126 yards rushing, completed one for one in the air for ten yards and was on the end of two passes for another 50 yards. Over the entire season the Union star made over 1000 yards in the five games he played in. Union's scoring in the afternoon was done by Tony Coppola and AI Wade; Coppola was responsible for or.e of the Union tallies and Wade for the other two. Union Opened Fast Hamilton won the toss and elect- ed to receive and in their opening plays could do nothing. Union re- ceived the Hamilton punt on their own 45 yard Hne and from there it took them cnly siX plays to draw first blood. Two plays ar.d a back in motion gained the Garnet only two yards. On the thiicd p!.y Strauss tossed a ten yard pass to E:nstice on the Hamilton 43, who galloped to the Hamilton 25 yard stripe bef0re he was pulled down. Best and Strauss niac!e three mme, then Coppola on an end around went aU the way for the Union scOI·e. AI Wade's attempted conversicn was r.o good and Union went ahead 6-0. Ken Whalen's punt was partially blocked to set up a Hamilton threat half way through the first stanza; but the Union line buck- led down and held the Buff and Blue down, until Dick Zeliff recov- ered a Hamilton fumble on the Ur.ion 14 yard line. Taking over where it recovered the fumble the Garnet sent Hal Enstice up field for 25 yards t0 the Hamilton 40. Hal Lundstrum went through the center for three more, followed b·; a Strauss-Wade aerial which the 'Garnet halfb9ck took on the Hamilton 15 yard line and then galloped the rest of the way to score standing up. Again the con- version was wide. Union 12, Hamil- ton 0. In the second quarter it was again Hal Enstice who sparked the Dutchmen. HE! opened up a 76 yard march by rushing 24 yards in two plays. Then it was AI Wade who went 52 yards over left tackle to provic'e the spectators with one of the thrills of the game. Tile 167 pound half.back was almost stopped twice after crossing the line of scrimmage but finally broke into the cleH on the Hamilton 35 and went the rest of the way in one of the most brilliant exhibitions of broken field running that Gar- net spectators have seen this year. Wade attempted the conversion but his kick was wide. The score at half time was Union 18 and Hamil- ton 0. Three partially blccked punts set up all the Hamilton threats. The Continer tals played a very rushing game and crowded Ken Whalen so that his usually potent punts were rendered highly ineffec- tive. It was not until the fourth quar- ter that the Continentals, against the Union second stringers, dis- played any sort of an offensive. Then the Buff and Blue marched 50 yards befcre the Garnet subs could put on the brakes. Do you like Dancing ? 3 Here's a dance nobody likes. Arthur Murray never taught it.
