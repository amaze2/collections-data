' . i. Page 10 OONOORDIENSIS, April 7, l98S THE ARTs· The Court Gestures ByLORIFAVATA This spring will bring a new taste of theater to Union. Scott Bloom and Anna Tucker are in the process of creating Union's first improvisational comedy troupe. The idea originated from these two actors' view that Union needs ·a more diverse type of theater. The Court Gestures wiU be a series of performances, each unique, focusing on spontaneous comic entertainment. The novelty of these shows will be the em- phasis placed on audience participation. Scott refers to the project as one in which ''the audience will be as much a part of the show as the actors themselves.'' Tryouts for the comedy team began last term. Of many en- thusiastic respondents Scott and Anna have selected about nine performers to make up the At The Egg- O'Neill Drama With an all-black cast from the Richard Allen Center for Culture and Art, Eugene O'Neill's drama LGng Day's Journey Into Night will be performed at the Egg in Albany on April 22. The acclaimed production was rescheduled after a postponement last November because of the illness of one of the actors. The Richard Allen Center's decision to stage O'Neill's masterpiece with black actors was greeted with skepticism. The play, after all, and its author and its family of characters have always been identified specifically as Irish Catholic American. Yet Geraldine Fitzgerald, who long has been closely identified with the play after taking the role of the mother\\ in four separate productions, believes strongly that the black and Irish experiences in America are greatly parallel. She saw the universality of the play's story and message and wanted to direct it herself, working with the talented performers of RACCA. When the play opened a season ago, critics and audiences upheld her vision, praised the performances, and reaffirmed the greatness of O'Neill's drama. Hazel Bryant, operatic soprano and actress, founded the Richard Allen Center for Culture and Art in 1968 in New York City. A presenting and producing arts institution, the Center has produced more than a hundred musicals and plays, including both new works and classics, drawn from the rich diversity of worldwide black culture as well as from international theatre repertoire. Each year the Center mounts a season of classic plays and musicals in a chamber theatre series and presents the annual National Black Perforill.ing Arts Festival at Lincoln Center. RACCA also conducts training programs in acting, musical theatre, and set and lighting desig~. . A particular interest of the Center is the development of new musical theatre r· ieces exploring unique uses o black American history and folk literature for the stage. . cast. Because of the-· ex· periinental nature of the project new talents are continuously being auditioned. As of now the cast consists of Scott Bloom, Anna Tucker, Bill Martuscello, Craig Shalmi, Marcy Wilder,' C.J. Zaruba, and Bonnie Rosenberg as stage manager. An important characteristic of an participants is the energy ··generated from their per- formances. There will be no written scrlpt to be followed; instead the cast will act out scenarios based either on previously planned ideas or topics randomly thrown out from members of the audience. The format wiU remain flexible allowing for instant changes' in the direction of skits and even audience participation on stage when required. The group is now rehearsing about four times a week, acting out a variety of skits and im- provlsational exercises. The leaders. Born a slave shortly before the American Revolution, he purchased his freedom and became an itinerant Methodist minister. When leaders of the Methodist church decided not to permit full and equal participation of blacks in worship services, Allen protested and organized' what is called the first public resistance to racial discrimination in America. He then founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church and later was elected lts first bishop. He also called and organized the first national conference of black people in America, formed the Free Mrican Society to serve some of the basic needs of the black community, and led in the development of black educational programs. The RACCA production of Long Day's Journey Jnto Night will be perfonned. twice in the -main theatre of the Egg, at 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Friday, April 22. ''New Plays\ Playwrights and audiences, the opposite ends of the theatrical spectrum, will . collaborate with actors and directors m a series of staged readings of new plays at the Egg in Albany, April10 through 16. These elements of the theatrical experience will be united by the Empire State Institute for the Performing Arts as it branches out into what the playwrights call an important part of the future of . the theatre in America. \The most promising new plays no longer originate ill New York ·City,\ explained Obie · Award-winning playwright Romulus Linney, who is serving as consultant for the ESIPA series. \I am very much a part of the New York theatre, but that is no longer the center of American theatre. Broadway is too expensive to take chances.'' Noting that \Broadway ·has become. host now to many, many plays\ that were first tried out in resident theatres across the country, Mr. Linney finds thf:lt creative development to be \the best thing in the American theatre in the past ten years.\ ideas explored during rehearsal ate recorded by Chris Hand for the purpose of future reference. This method provides the structure necessary for this type of project. The ultimate goal of these rehearsals is for the cast members to be able to antic-ipate each others responses and act accordingly, providing unified comical scenarios. Both Scott and Anna are very enthusiastic about this new venture. The .first set date for the project. is April 19 in the Cabaret room. There will be two other Tuesday night shows later in the term and possibly im- .promptu performances in places such as Library Plaza and even dining halls. Watch for the Court Gestures this term; they're apt to pop up anywhere and entertain you with a comic routine. director Lynnie Godfrey, who will stage .J'ack Gilhooley's Shirley Basin. She describes the process as being on a fine line betwe.en giving a simple reading and a staging so elaborate that the result becomes almost a full production. Her challenge and her whole purpose \is to focus in on Jack's work without over- producing it\' while \giving the actors enough to do so that they feel comfortable.\ W. A. Frankonis, who Will direct William Gibson's new play Goodly Creatures, also spoke of the difference between a staged reading and a full- scale production. \Each provides its own kind of excitement, and in each case there is no doubt that theatre is occurring. In a staged reading, however, the focus is almost entirely on the script itself ... What we see, in fact, is a work in progress; what we get is a glimpse of the creative process in action.u Each play will be staged three tinies in the Recital Hall of the Egg, with audien~es invited to join discussion-afterward. Jack Gilhooley's Shirley Basin will be presented at 2 p.m. Swuiay, April10; 10 a.m. Thursday, April14; and 8 p.m. Saturday, April16. · The staged reading-of William Gibson's Goodly Creatures will take place at 8 p.m. Tuesday, April 12; 10 a.m. Wednesday, Arpil 13; and 8 p.m. Friday, April15.

'· Page 12 OONOOBDIENSIS~ April 1, 1983 THE ARTS Pink Floyd·•s: . . The Final Cut By CHRIS SMITH Monday, March 21, 1983 brought to a close an era of Pink Floyd music with the release of the last album, The Final Cut, a requiem for the post~war dream. Manyof us grew up with such classics as Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, but their recent albwn The Wall was the band's most exhaustive effort to date. For lyricist Roger Waters (Mr. Pink himself) The Wall was a full scale display of his inner doubts and fears. The Wall movie pictured Pink as a shriveled fetus cowering against . a mammoth brick wall. This exposition no doubt left the band drainec;l, a post~war hollowness vaguely . reminiscent of \Apocolypse Now\ and \All Quiet on the Western Front.\ It was in this void that The Final Cut was conceived. Side one begins in the eerie reverence of a church organ guided by the boyish and serene voice of Mr. Roger Waters. Meditative post-war im- pressions question his father's death in the war, Japanese ship building, and the verse is given a brassy military back up by the National Philharmonic Orchestra. The tune winds down with a David Gilmour guitar theme asking ''Maggie Thatcher what have we done . . . to England . . . what hap- pened to the post-war dream?\· Like other Floyd albums, artful placement of background sounds and subsurface echos add considerable depth to the recording. An 'explosion sets off \One of your possible pasts,\ a somber driving tune with sounds o! children playing at a short distance.. The hollow lyrics put across the existential mood of the work easily. Metronomic clock ticks glaze through \one of the few\ then kick into David Gilmour's flighty guitar ripple from \Run Like Hell.\ Background wind noises usher in \The Gunner's Dream,\ a superb lyrical work with just about the only shred of optimism in The Final Cut. Roger envisions a place where \you can relax on both sides of the tracks and maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by News Story? Concordiensis 370-6155 RENT ! !ANNOUNCES!! NEW CARS $115 WEEKLY 350Miles Free SCHENECTADY 382-8111 To Qualified Customers r.emote control, and everyone has recourse to the law and no one kills the children anymore. Side one ends defeated: \Now you're lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age, behind paranoid eyes.\ pespite the defeated nature of the work it is as much of a classy intended production as any of their previous releases. Political perceptions arrive on side two with ''Get Your Filthy Hands off 1\{y Dessert,\ a jaunty spoof on the Falklands crisis. Judicious· placement of conventional instrumentals with synthetic noises together with ~oger and company humming the \Maggie what have we done\ theme in the background really make this tune the gem that it is. ''The Fletcher Memorial Home\ refers to Eric Fletcher Waters (1913·1944), father of Roger Waters, who was killed in the war and to whom the album is dedicated. Roger never knew his father and this was a large source of grie1 for him and · ultimately his music. The song puts \Reagan and Haig, Mr. Begi'n and friend\ as well as other contemporary politicos in :a \home for colonial wasters of lifEr ·and limb.\ Pretty bitter stuff. \Southhampton Dock\ on a' happier note, picture·s a girl waving ''with hankerchief and summer frock\ ,to the boys going away to war. This leads into \The Final Cut,\ a heavy serious tune with a lone singular piano accompanime.nt. \Through the fish.eyed lense of tear stained eyes,. I can barely define the shape of this moment in time.\ \Not Now John\ is a violent frustrated reaction to the calmness of \The Final Cut\: \Fuck aU that we gotta get on with these/' Side two ends in the tired yet calm reassurance of \Two suns in the Sunset.\ This one leaves with an image of finality sitting· by a roadside after a note on the inevitability~ of death: ''ashes and diamonds, foe and friend, we're all equal in the end.'' Overall, this album seems a sUfficient end to the Pink Floyd saga. Like other Floyd albums it will be appreciated more as time goes on. For the band that dared to show us the \dark side\ The F1inal Cut is a fatigued out fitting way to call it quits. >'•:'· ·\''··: • ; •. , Union College Coffeehouse · presents·: Stephen Baird, Street Singer 8:30pm- AprH 8th Cabaret Room Tick.ets $1.50

An evplution will take place in the average fan from the beginning of spring training in late ·February through the springt summer and ensuing fall. Spring training is possibly the most fascinating time of the entire season forthe true fan of our national pa,atime. The promise of World' Series ap- .pearances and the Qptimism dished out by m~agement and players alike is only surpassed by the keen interest the fans take in this springtime ritual. Each divisional race is wide open throughout the sj!dng as the scenario evdlves on the shores .of Florida to the deserts of A.rizona. The ~ever 'of spring training brings fans from an walks of life together under the sun to enjoy a taste. of the promise and optimism· of baseball in March. The diehard fans are a given in the towns and cities that call themselves the winter homes of our twenty-six major league squads in the Grapefruit and Cactus league circuits. But this spring ritual draws fans. that most people would not 'think would get callght ·up in the spring~raining. atmosphere. City ~ouncll Prestde!lts, lawyers, msurance executives and stock- brokers all flock to the fun in the sun that surrounds this month and a half .of practice. The two places that seem to hold the most \action\ for the migrating fans are the practice complexes and·- each teamts hotel which they call their winter homes. In the early days of spring training the players on each team's forty-man roster stayed in their respective hotels, but with the advent of million dollar contracts and the increasing family man status of many players only twenty to thirty of the big leaguers lodge in the team's dwellings. Coaches, management, and the press stay in these same hotels that are ogen to the public. Except for a conunon stream of airline pilots and crews the majority of the other roorr:s are take.n by the variety of hometown fans that have travelled for a .week or two to enjoy the sun w~ile taking in all the fun that spring training has to offer. The best place to glimpse these big leaguers is in the l~bby of the liotel. Fans mill around the lobby trying to look as unfun-like as possible: as they ~ry t~ strike up a con- versatiOn w1th a Schmidt or a Jackson. Many have trouble rec?g~i,zing the players out of the~ armor\ and let their - s~rmg training opportunities Sli:P aw~y.

Many of the faithful who do not fiokon the ~<>C:ld with the big club . e to watt m the lobby for the bred players to return so they can make it look like they really care how they did on the trip to Who know's where. The typical day for the players starts at six-thirty as they wake up and go to break· fast by .seven. The faithful fans get up with the sun and travel over to the field, to · catch the morning's practice. This is the time that even the oldest of fans can vicariously play out their childhood dreams by getting up close to the field and seeing tbeir fav.orite players work. out. With dour organization teams all working out at the same time · and running around ln .often make.sbift unifonns, it's y:out best guess if you just really got an autograph from Manny Trillo or some scribbling from a two-bit minor leaguer. These morning .practices. are the best chance for the real fan to ,even walk out, on the field with players .from his (avodte team and become a true part of the fanfare that surrounds pro ball. While this is all going on at the parkt the many wives and c~ildren of the lawyers and insurance men are waking up in just enough time to beat the 10:00 a.m. rush to secure one of 'the few lounge chairs by the pQol. The average uniform of the fan at the park is shorts, a T- shir.t,. and a cap of some sort tbat sports a team emblem. Ironically, the average uniform of the so-called \die-hards that circle the pool and miSs half the day of baseball (what they traveled many miles for?} is· a bright Jordache warm-up suit, extensive gold chains and a home town paper to read about how the team they're staying in the same hotel with is doing. Often in the morningst away from the parkt team trustees in town for their organization's annual meeting, convene with perfunctory brevity and talk of finances and profits while team members enjoy their mid·day shower before the game at the 4,000 seat spring park.

Union had battled back from an early 4-0 deficit to take a 5-4 lead into the final inning, only to see R.P.I.'s Don Friedberg rip a game-winning two-run double. Mter R.P .I. had taken the lead with a four-run second inning, the Dutchmen finally got on the scoreboard in the fourth as Joe Clinton singled home Joe Wood who had earlier doubled. Union then knotted the score in the next· inning with three runs. Ed Moriarity began the rally with along triple to left. Kead-off hitter Tim Alibozek followed with a double making the score 4•2. After John Moretti reached on an error and George Oberstat walked, Alibozek scored Union's third rim on a wild pitch. Joe Wood then punched a single to right scoring Moretti and tying the -xcore. Union's final tally came in the sixth. Tom Blackburn led off the · inning with a single to right and advanced _to third on an errant pick-off attempt and a wild pitch. Then with Charlie Hickey at the plate, Blackburn made a dash for home and scored the go~ahead run as the ball escaped the grasp of the Engineer catcher. Bolstered by the fine pitching of Nat Harris and Doug Metz, and the superb outfield play of Oberstat and Andy Dreh~r, it looked as if the Dutchmen would make their one run lead stand up, but Friedberg's ninth inning hit proved otherwise. Union received a solid pit- ching performance from Nat Harris as he went seven innings giving up only five hits and no ' earned runs. Both Harris and Metz were victimized by errors as they gave- up just one earned run combined. Joe Wood paced the Dutchmen with three hits, while Clinton and Blackburn chipped in with two apiece,. The Dutchmen will play their first home contest th!s afternoon a$ they hOst Division I Siena at Central Park. Coaches Audino, Lovett and Teevens feel that with defensive improvement apd timely hitting the Dut- ·chmen will turn in a successful season. *SUPPORT UNION SPORTS* ByM.SOLOWAY Spods Staff The Union College Ruggers got off to a fine start this season. On Saturday Apri12, both the A and B teams defeated the engineers from RPI 15-9 and 7-0 respectively. In the first half of the A game, the Union ruggers jumped out to a 6..0 lead by a run resulting in a try .from Walter Fredricks. The RPI team bounced back with three points from a drop kick by co-captain Russ Backhouse. The first half ended 9-3 in favor of Union. · low by some good taclde.sled by Union's fullback. Scott Collins. However, the rusty h()me team committed too many penalties, .allowing RPI to tie the game with two successful penalty kicks. With ten minutes left, Pete Ladd collected the ball with a one-handed pick-up and stormed over three RPI ruggers to score Union's second and winning try. With only un- successful attempts from .RPI to tie the score, the game ended 15-9 in our favor. Serum co-captain Keith Dean commented after the game that and line-outs.

Sports Staff Two years ago the Union women's softball team made it to the state tournament. Last year, plagued by· a few injuries, the team fell just short _ of qualifying. This year behind the strong coaching of Kathy Lochner and Jim Cara.fano the .team looks hopeful. With stress on conditioni.hg and flexibility the team began practicing in the field house on February 15th and just recently had their first outdoor practice With less than two weeks before the season starts. In addition to the returning lettermen of - Brenda Hugick, Peg L,aden, Kelly Liese, Dina Pliotis, Karen Roth (seniors); Barb Bailey, Carolyn Sigda, JoAnne Dolan, Linda Gutin (juniors); and Peg Petro (sophomore), the team has many impressive newcomers including,.Cathy Bentley, (senior), Melissa Viglielmo (junior); Cheri Wong (sophomore), and two fresh- men, Lisa Foley and Patty Page. The team is managed by Natalie Stone and the scorekeeper is Louisa Rooney. The once All-American player turned coach feels , very op- timistic about tl1e season to come. Kathy cites the players' individual strengths as well as their ability to play together as a team as the basiS for a good, healthy season. In addition, she points out that the team is very well rounded, with people practicing at more than just one position, in order to be well prepared for the unknown. There is no way to predict who this year's stars will be, espeCially since the emphasiS will be on team effort and team success, but the returning players Dina Pliotis, Brenda Hugick, and Peg Petro will ttndeiliably ntake up a big part of the team's backbone. This is Dina's fourth year as starting pitcher and her accuracy and speed-will be a major part_ of the team's defense. The one problem foreseen, with -the graduation of relief pitcher- leftfielder Kristen Petersen, will be Dina's endurance and the intense pressure irivolved. Brenda will also be playing her fo1lrth year starting in the outfield. Her defensive playing ability coupled with her bunting prowess make her another imp9rtant part of the team's strength. After making an impressive . debut last season sophomore Peg Petro returns to her position as starting shOrt- stop, where her diving ability keeps everything on her side of the infield from getting by her.

By DOUG LANDON and GAYLE ROSENFELD A freshman enters Union with high expectations foF · a challenging curriculUm, but may or may not encounter tms situation in every course. Because of the strong emphasis on . achievement at Union, students tend to strive for grades rather than lmowledge. With this in mi.ndJ the depart- ment of mathematics has deciqed that action is in order. Professor Ted Bick_, chairman of the . department, has drawn Up a proposal that will be considered· by the Academic Mfairs Council (AAC) .. The proposal, presented to the AAC at Tuesday's meeting, would provide for the automatic placement in Calculus 12or 14 of any freshman who has had calculus in high school said Dwight . Phaup, Chairman of both· the AAC and the Depart- ment of Economics. The actual problem is that some students will take Calculus 10 although they have already studied the subject in high school \That's not to say that people don't have a legitimate concern for the quality\ of their calculus courses in high school, com- mented AACmember Professor Bill Zwicker of the math department. Many students wish to refresh their memories or simply are not confident with the calculus knowledge they ·have, so they retake the course in college. . The proposal, according to Phaup, would allow students who could convince the math department chairperson that their high school course was inadequate to take Calculus 10, are also. Instructors \want to teach people,\ said Zwicker, and are not motivated to teach subject matter to students who already know the material. Also this problem affects a third party, the college. Those cynical students tend to generate a negative at- mosphere for the college. \The fact that they're able. to get away with it has had b.~d effects on the AAC to the proposal for how the Math Department handles their own department.'' Formal vote on the issue will probably take place the week . after next. In the meantime, Phaup stressed\ that \the AAC would welcome comments on this matter. We are not trying to do anything without letting the campus be informed., ''Not· Like Dreams Do'' Preview- P. 7 but only on a pass-fail basis. However, there is that small minority of . cynical and manipUlative Union students who want the proyerbial \easy A.\ It is these. people who cause the problem. \They discourage other students who struggle\ in the course, said Phaup. According to Zwicker, students \should feel chailenged at appropriate levels\ and if· they're not \exposed to new and exciting ideas\ as soon as they enter college then they may become lax in their studies. Zwicker added · that t)lere exists a i''dual morale problem.\ Not only are .the students whO haven't had calculus hurt,. but professors on the campus as ,a whole,\ mentioned Zwicker. · Since a letter grade is presently required for math maj9rs, along with courses 12, 14, 30 and one other, the proposal seeks to eliffi!nate the introductory course from department graduation requirements, Phaup ex- plained. Calculus 10 (or its high school equivalent) will continue to be a prerequisite for 12, however, whether taken for a letter grade or as a pass-fail course. \Implicitly it is there, explicity it is not there,\ he added. \I think we'll accept the proposal,\ Phaup said, . . . \There is no strong opposition An added consideration here is in how this problem affects other departmen~s on campus. The AAC sent out letters to all chairmen heads as to how this problem reflects itself ln their departments. A few responses have been received by the AAC. One department that has already circumvented this issue is Modern Language. This department screens high school transcripts and achievement or CEEB tests very carefully before it. places a student at the appropriate level. The Computer Science Department responded that though it . has · no major problems now, it may in the future as . Iil9re and more .. ,• . · .. students are exposed to com- puters in high school. Phaup also raised the issue that many non-science majors take Calculus 10 as a liberal learning E credit, and since such credit is now only given for letter grades another conflict arises. He said that AAC is considering making Calculus 10 \the exception to the rule,, and allow credit to students who pass the course under a pass. fail system. If the AAC receives no intense objections from other departments, Phaup expects the provision to be adopted. Phaup sees the proposal as a viable way to curb repetition of curriculum and create a more eq1,1.itable atmosphere for Calculus 10 students. Since SAT's don't test for calculus, the Math Department \doesn't have a good screening mechanism\ in place at the present' time, he said. This plan is patterned after but not identical to a program at Brown University designed for the same purpose. Phaup summed up the proposal as an \intellectually more honest system.'' Both the AAC and the Math Department want to· eliminate the practice of giving credit for material already learned by the students.

Pete Wool and Andy Rosen, chairpersons of the Film Comrilittee, .stated that this year has not ·only been an ex- ceptionally good year for the FUm Committee, but it has been an even better year for those students who took advantage of the excellent opportunities offered. mitt~e-'s budg.et is ap- proxunately $22,000,. of which $11,760 came f.rom Student Activities funds and the remainder from revenue generated by ticket sales. Film committee finances are spent in an attempt to accommodate a wide variety of interests, and to provide viewing opportunities for some more obscure and less publiciZed films which are not frequently shown.. Films such as The Graduate, Fast Times and Ridgemont Higb or the ·upcoming R<>llifig Stones' fibn, Let's .Spend the N!ght T9gether were each selected with these objectives in mind.

Even after she gets her masters degree in industrial social work next fall from the University of Wisconsin, she doesn't think she has much of a chance tQ land a decent job. \I don't have any hope of getting that $25,000 a year job,\ says the 38-year-old mother of two, who holds down a part-time job at the university's Con- tinuing Education Service. In her job, she gets to see increasing numbers of people in situations like hers: recent college grads who, after periods of trying but failing to parlay their degrees into the jobs they were trained for,· are now lowering their sights and ex-_ pectations. It is happening at similar continuing education and retraining · offices around the country, too. _ ''The people coming in for counseling are in their twenties and thirties, and they feel angry, frustrated and betrayed,\ says Kent Lesan- drini, a UW career counselor. Especially among recent grads, \1 think there is disen- chantment, and expectations are not met,\ adds Judith Gumbener, San Diego State University's associate planning director. ''More people are being educated, thinking this is going to open the doors,\ says Dr. William Bryan of the University of Alabama's Continuing Education Program. \But it is not.\ Students and recent grads \have seen a pretty. hard decade for employment,\ summarizes Pa.ul Barton, head of the National Institute for Work and Learning in Washington, D.C. \These people don't see themselves doing as well as their parents, and that is part of the disap- pointment.\ \There is a feeling that people are not in cQntrol of , their future,\ Lesandrini explains. He sees post~graduate depression most often among liberal arts degree holders like teachers and social workers, but also among a surprising number of people who have earned their masters of business administration (MBA). MBAs, of course, were considered the golden job ticket of the late seventies. Part of the reason for the . widespread disappointment and the increasing traffic at con- tinuing education programs from recent grads is that students treat their educations too much as employment tools, the counselors say. Gumbener's clients \are tremendously frustrated because the job opportunities are not the same as they were three year~ ago.\ Williard Wirtz of the National Institute for Work and Learning says much of the un- deremployment and depression among recent grads can be traced to a fundamental shift in the American economy, not just to a temporary recession. \This has always happened\ when economic activity moves Freshman Honored ByJUDIESTE~RDT Freshman Lisa Freed, of White Plains, New York, has received two scholarships for her skills as an undergraduate ' civil engineer. She received a $4,500 three-year scholarship from the Society of Women Engineers and a $4,000 award from ··the Associated General Contractors' Education and Research Foundation. Both awards were national scholarships which required interviews and essays. She was chosen on the basis of academic performance, extracurricular activities, and financial need.

Many of the college grads are now in CTC's auto mechanic, medical technician, welding, diesel emchanic and building main- tenance programs. Technical school enrollment nationwide has gone up 20 percent over the last two years, in part because of the influx. of college grads, reports Christopher Davis of the National Association for Trade and Technical Schools. By E. T .. BORER Staff Three more Union College A.S.M.E. members joined ~ long tradition of our school's Winners this weekend when six of the society's members and faculty ad'visor Pr.ofessor Guntur traveled to the University of Rochester for the American Society of Mechanical Engineer's Regional Student Conference. The conference is held annually at one of 28 schools in the region so that participating members can share and learn about research and projects currently being done by other students. This year's conference, at- tended by engineering students from Washington, D.C. to New York, consisted of: two mor- nings of project presentations, an afternoon of tours at the University of Rochester or Kodak, an evening of en~ tertainment, and ended with an awards luncheon. Both Jablonski and Ted Collins, Union College seniors, presented projects to the conference. Jablonski was awarded first place for the , presentation of his. paper on \The Measurement of Strain in an Artificial Hip\ and Collins came in fifth for his presen- tation on the \Development of a Small Internal Brake Dynamometer\. Both felt that they had been well prepared after earUer presentations -made at Union and in com- petition at R.P.I. At cthe awards luncheon Frank Skorima, the Union Student Section president, received the ''Outstanding Student Member\ award for _Union, and the school's section itself was awarded third place in the Bendix Contest; an an- nual competition sponsored by Bendix: Corp., to encourage section activities and student participation. 9-ary St. Onge, a 1982 Union graduate and 1ast year's national competition winner, was present to hand out the awards. Union students have won at least one award at the conference since 1975, in- cluding seven first place win· ners. Jablonski's award this · year allows him. to compete in the national ~speaking com- petition in Boston next November.

Staff The Presldent's Commission on the Statl1S of Women at Union college was chartered in 1975 for the purpose of advisillg the Administration about the needs and concerns of women at this school. Thomas Bonner, the president at the time, established this group .after the college had-.just recently gone co-ed and women were new on the campus. . The President's Commission presently has been successful in meeting many ·Of the needs of women at Union, and serves all the female students, faculty - members, staff, ad- ministrators, and faeulty wives. Professor Catherine Clinton, a member of the history depart- ment and the President's Commission, remarked. that although the women students, faculty, staff, and ad- ministrators are all represented, the commission has not been as successful in keeping wives of faculty or continuing studies graduate students, unless directly in- volved- otherwise with the college, involved. Nevertheless the commission continues to be dedicated to serving the whole female community at Union. Debra Gray, a staff member of the physics .department and former chairperson of the Commission, listed many o£ the programs the President's Commission were involved in instituting at Union. Because of the input from the commission, an Affirmative- Action Office was established, although this only serves faculty and ad- ministrators and excludes female staff members. Up until this year there was no women's health services, let alone a gynecologist available on campus. Through the commission's influence, the infirmary now provides such services. Clinton added ad- ditiona! _programs to this list: · Chilcl care leave for faculty, staff, and aclministrators, various committees which deal with rape awareness, safety. and self-defense, and a women's support group. She also added that the commissic;m has spoken to security about the lighting on campus. The conunission also .sponsors awards and scholarships for outstanding women who excel in scholastic-s, athletics, and community service~. The Luncheon Colloquium, helC:i on alterniite Wednesdays in the Banquet Room of Car ... negie Hall, is also spansored by the commission. It provides speakers on topics of p!>Utical and cultural concern to women, as well as a. place for women to get together. It has been very successful, Grey believes, in bringing community women to the campus. She explained that \The Ad- ministration seems more concerned with the sensibility of the male faculty than the security of women.\ the·· Luncheon Colloquium and other educational activities, such as the film series spon- sored last year, was the com- mission's way of filling in ~he gaps of a -women's studies program in the curriculum at Union. In regard to such a program, Clinton said that two members of the commission have developed a women's studies bibliography. This bibliography is intended to make students aware of literature and material, in order that it might be in- tegrated into the curriculum. She also said the conuriission is currently drafting a committee whose purpose is to recommend curriculUm reform. One of the major concerns of the commission is sexual harrassment. The Dean of Students does have a policy and procedure for undergraduate students being harassed, but the issues of female faculty and _ female $tudents being har~ed by male faculty are of grave importance. . Clinton stated that the Ad- ministration is not willing to enforce a concrete policy because of the fear 9£ opposition or offending some of the faculty. \The Administration seems more concerned with the sen- sibility of the ~le faculty than the security of women.\ She forcefully said that this is im- moral, that the whole women's community should pay such a great cost in order that . the administration not offend or oppose anyone. \We recognize the problem as much more serious clearly than the ad- ministratiqn acknowledges,'' Clinton remarked. _ When asked about the par- ticipation of the women at Union in the President's Commission, Clinton stated that she feels, as a faculty member, that after a decade, there has been only \token changes\ on campus for the needs of women, which is good only as a \prelude\ to re51l changes. .Clinton said she'd like to s.ee the day when there is no need to have a special group to fight for women'S needs and when the ... Administration will equally consider the women on campus and provide for their needs. Until then the commission is important. She also felt that despite the fact that the com- mission operates on a small budget, provided by the president as a discretionary fund, the hard work of the members has succeeded in making the commission very effective. The President's Commission on the Status of Women at Union College meets on alternative Wednesdays and the meetings are open, so anyone with con- cerns or interests is welcome to attend. Professor Cather.ine Clinton speaks o1:1t .for women _Alcohol Awareness Group Formed By JENNIFER SCONYERS Staff Tuesday, AprilS, was the first organizational meeting for a new committee on alcohol awareness. Headed by Dave Wood, Director of Residence Life, and Michael Andolina, Associate Dean of Students, the committee will consist not only of students, but also of faculty and staff. The first meeting was held to discuss the intended purpose of this group with all interested students. The six students who attended will make up the student part .of the Committee on Alcohol Awareness. Rather - than being prohibitionist~ the committee intends to educate the college conununity about both the use and abuse of alcohol. The committee will provide in- formation on how to prepare and serve alcoholic beverages, :how to plan events with alcohol, how to successfully plan a non- alcoholic event, what alcohol abuse is, and where to find help for a problem with alcohol. Uniting students, faculty, and staff will hopefully create a new sense ·Of _campus-wide awareness. The major benefit derived from this group is that it gives all members. of Union College the chance to ex:press their opinions and concerns about a serious subject. The use of. alcohol has become an accepted part of all aspects of campus life. Little consideration has been given to the impact of alcohol on each student's life at Union. Hopefully this com- mittee will be able to give some answers about why we not only use but also abuse alcohol and what some other alternatives might be. Few exact details were given at the April 5 meeting because the specific goals will not be officially set until the entire committee meets on Monday, April 18. If any student is in- terested in or feels strongly about this subject, please contact either Dave Wood or Michael Andolina. ., ttl Ol ·:t: u Cll c:: .c.

Private school ad- ministrators, for the first time in recent years, received smaller pay increases - 5.6 percent compared to 6.6 percent - than th~ir public school colleagues. Of all administrators sur- veyed, deans of medicine received the highest salaries, $86,700, followed by law school Q.eans at $67,787. Nursing administrators at student health centers made the least at $16,640, followed by · bookstore directors at $18,740, Women and minorities continue to be the lowest paid administrators. Compared to their white male counterparts, women earn 44.8 percent less and minorities make 37.2 percent le!!S, the study shows. Miller says a number of factors, such as length of em· ployment, could explain the disparity between minority and non-minority salaries.

Tickets are $2. \ Leary Timothy Leary was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the fall of 1920. After receiving his BA from the University of Alabama and his MS from WashiQgton State University, he went· on to receive his Ph.D in Clinical Psychology from the Univ~rsity of California at Berkeley in 1950. Dr. Leary's most important accomplishments of the 1950's were in connection with his position as the Director of Psychology Research at the prestigious Kaiser Foundation in Oakland, California. It was during this time that he became a founder and leader of the new \humanistic\ psychology movement; his ground- helped revolutionize traditional approaches to psychotherapy. In 1959, Dr. Leary left the Kaiser Foundation to accept an appointment at Harvard University as Lecturer in Clinical Psychology. During the summer of 1960, he had his first psychedelic experience at the home of a friend in Mexico. Back at Harvard, he became the Director of the Psychedelic Research Project at the Center for the Study of Personality. In its first year, carefully con- trolled psychedelic sessions were conducted with over two hundred volunteer subjects. By 1966, Ti.rrwthy teary had become an internationally known leader of the con~ sciousness movement and champion of personal freedom, He became known as the \High Priest\ of the 1960's (publishing a book of the same name)., and coined the phrase \Turn-on Tune In, Drop out,\ which echoed a statement of self- discovery and self-actualization throughout the world. Dr. Leary has written several b ... ooks including ExoP- sycbology, What Does Wo Man Want? and lnteWgeuce Agents, and has lectured ex- tensively. His recent talks have focused on the personal and species ~spects of evolution and \the creation of the future.\ His message of personal freedom and growth has recently taken the form ·Of three ideas whoe time have come: Space Migration, Intelligence Increase and Life Extension (S.M.I.L.E.).

White he is \a thoroughly dangerous man.\ Yet Barbara Walters says \he has a brilliant mind\ and in the opinion of the late Stewart Alsop, \in another time . . . he would have been regarded as among the bravest and the best.\ G. Gordon Liddy, the Watergate ''mastermind\ who successfully defied the efforts of all three branches of the United States government to force him to betray his associates through four and a half years of imprisoiiment, including 106 days of solitary confinement deadlock, is one of the most controversial figures of our time. -· Born in New York City in 1930, he earned a bachelor of science degree from Fordham College and a doctor of law from the Fordham LawSchool, where he was a member of the Law Review. Mr. Liddy served two years as an Army officer and five as a Special Agent of the FBI where, after six com- mendations, ile became, at 29~ one of the youngest men ever to serve as a Bureau Supervisor on the staff of J. Edgar Hoover. After practicing international law in Manhattan, serving as a prosecutor and an unsuccessful candidate .for Congress, Mr. Liddy returned to Washington where he served as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury and its Enforcement Legislative Counsel before becoming Staff Assistant to the President in the first Nixon administration~ There he served in the special·. in- vestigative unit \ODESSA later to become known as the \Plumbers then became General Counsel to the Com- mittee to Re-elect the President, from which he directed the Watergate break- in.

Humor- All About Engineers By MA'M'HEWBERNICK and FRANKLIN SCHNEIDER Staff What do you pre-meds and liberal arts majors picture in your mind when you think of an engineering student? . Do recollections of skinny eggheads; bent over a compu\er terminal in S~E on a Satti,rday night come-to mind? Or are they thoughts of the guy who tried to pick you up in the Pub with the line, ''Wouldyouliketo come up to my room and see my hydraulic system designs?'' To dispel these and other myths about engineers, investigative reporter Franklin Schneider and eng·ineering consultant Matthew Bernick held an ex- clusive. interview with senior civil engineering student Nermal Likarnelli. (We met Nerm, as his friends call him, in his room on Second Floor Webster House. He greeted us at the door and led us into a room with plush car- peting, framed prints on the walls-and track lighting above. An inunense loft with mirrors -on the ceiling and a well-stocked bar were also present. However, there wasn't an engineering. book in sight, nor was there a calculator, T- square, blueprint or computer printout to be found anywhere. He offered us a drink and ushered us over to an over- stuffed couch, placing himself opposite !IS in an easy chair.) Q: As an engineering student how do you feel about the stereotypical image of Union engineers? A: Why, have the police 'been asking about me again? How mucb do vou know? Q: Wel( what sort of image do you feel that people have of Union engineers? A: Well, let's put it this way, at RPI you always see someQne running around with blueprints in hand or sitting extremely frustrated at a computer ter- minal, Do you see that at Union? No. not a trace! Q: If you are not working on the latest engineering discovery, where are youJ. A: Have any of you pre-meds been to Rupsis on Monday night, followed, by Kelly's on Tuesday, etc.? Q: How 'ao you manage to do so academically well with such a demanding curriculUIIi: as engineering? A: (He draws closer to us and lowers his voice in a c<>n• fidenti<H manner) Actually engineering is the easi~st majo; .... we have been putting on a front for years. · Q: :Sut what about all the .prestigious work Union students have done? How about the numero~ awards and honors Union engineers have won? A: Did you ever .hear about the Tacoma-Narrows Bridge? Or about the elevated walkways at the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel? I worked on those two projects personally! Actually, during their respective collapses they performed up to specifications. It was just a problem with the wind and the people. Q: But whaf about the Whipple Bridge; it works? A: Who are you trying to kid, that was 1850, buddy! Q: Your responses seem to reflect an out of the ordinary approach to problem solving. Just how do you go about solving complex engineering situations! A: Well, the way I look at it, if you don't get the answer right off, sit back, pop open a Schlitz, and go over-the problem in your mind. Then if you are still having trouble, finish off a six- packor two, setting the .problem aside for a new day's effort. Though this often leads -to .alcoholism, I have come up with some extremely creative an- swers to problems. · Q: Where do you place hard work and determination? A: What? Want some pop- pers? Q: Uh, ~o thanks ... So wh~t you are basically saying .is that Union Engineers are a highly SQcia:l group of students? A: Baby, we are PARTY ANI1'4AlS!! (Suddenly a gir~'s head pops out of the loft qwz- zically asking, \Nerm who are . those people?\ He answers ·ba~k, \I'll be right with you, honey.\ Then turning to us,. .. ) You will have to excuse me gentlemen, I've got some, shall we say, engineering problep1s to attend to.

There was a time in the history ·Of Union College where bell ringers were given grants- in-aid to ring the bells.. As the years went by, this. policy disappeared as. did the ringing of the bells. Professor Huntley, a clo~k collector, became in• terested . in the clock of the chapel and received gifts from. alumni to repair the clock and bells. The bells. have now been rung for the past three years. The tower of the chapel contains the console f{)r th8 ringing of the bells and the eleven bells themselves. Since there are only eleven bells, the selections that can be played are very limited. These songs. must be compressed to fit the eleven notes and there is very Ringing the bells; according to Tim Smith, is physically rigorous work since one must run all around pressing the certain levers. If one .is ·really good at bell ringing, he can eventually play with two hands. Smith also emphasized the difficulty in practicing the the bells since -one mistake can be heard by the whole campus community (which usually ;results m a large round of ap- plause). · . The clock is a twenty-four clock that chimes every q1,1arter of an hour during the day and every hour during the evening (much to the dismay of those who live in . South College). Sometimes, though, the bells keep ringing in the middle of tbe night which usually results in Professor Huntley having to run across the campus in his night shirt to tum them off. · So, the next time that you are walkiag across Library Field to the Wedding March, just think of Tim and Liz in the tower of Memorial Chapel playing the bells. And, if you are interested · in ringing the bells here, contact Professor Huntley. Hopefully there will be enough interest on the campus to keep this tradition alive here at Union.

B. BLANK Staff Nora Sayre spoke to a crowd of fascinated listeners in the lower Hale House Lounge last Tuesday. . The subject, \Women's Roles in Films in the 1950's.\ The event, part of the Women's Week Celebration at ,Union, proved informative, ~ducati~;~nal, as well as en- joyable. The movie of the 1950's em- phasized love, sex and marriage, Sayre began. pnhappy married lives, as seen m James Dean films, proved to be . common storyUnes. However, within the \last five minutes,'' Sayre noted, all their lives became happy once again, as many problems were solved through pregnancies or raises in husbands• salaries creating newly contented wives. Sayre commented that tqe unhappy suburban - marriage themes suggest that security tnakes people restless .. Husbands ·were \outgroWing\ their wives, and valid representative frustrations existing in society appeared. Divorce provided popular subject matter. Society's values snone through however' death, Sayre noted, was often preferred to divorce. Before a divorce was finalized one of the spouses died. Divorced women suffered most in films, especially when children were involved. Unhappy couples tried to stay together at all costs, surviving \ghastly n~conciliations\ as the people accepted the fact that \All we'vegot is each other.'' Long Hot Summer showed women to be only half art entity without a man. Even the screen romances of the 1930's and 1940's lost their popularity to marriage con\' .flicts. ... Cat on a Hot Tin Roof starring Liz Taylor examined married women's suffering through the common sexual frustration themes of the 1950's. Sexually frustrated women turned into lunatics as Splendor in the Grass of 1961 demonstrated. Here Sayre noted, as do many historians, that history studied in decades often crosses over into the succeeding ones.

Women~ were blamed for giving men the \wrong idea\ and Sayre noted, \the higher the heels, the lower the morals.\ · Sayre distinctly noted the way age played a role in the images · women portrayed. Women were confined to comforting and being charming. Shirley Maci..aine foUnd herself playing cuteness. Contrasting with Jane Fonda and Jessica Lange of today, young actresses of the 1950's were limited in the scope of character roles. These lhnited roles were enforced . by a ''popular culture,\ Sayre noted, and used Audrey Hepburn as a primacy example. Hepburn, Sayre continued, perpetuated the notion that women should be in no way threatening to men~ Playing opposite older men, Sayre explained Hepburn was made to appear childlike and helpless. Sayre jokingly described Hepburn's continual weat:ing of white gloves ac- centuating her innocence as a \well-gloved mentality.\ Sayre said Doris Day's \good-girl\ roles portrayed her as a late adolescent. Not only were women to remain innocent, but the award- winning film All About Eve rebuked Bette Davis and Anne Baxter for being ambitious, Sayre explained. Women must be neurotic if they care about careers, after all. Sayre con- tinued, they can't be real women without husbands. When asked whether Hollywood mirrors society or society sets Hollywood's standards, Sayre explained that both work with each other. The · industry does want to \give the public what it wants\ and at- tempts to get a feeling for our tastes and attitudes. However, once these nnages appear on the screen, the feeling and values are reinforced. Sayre also noted that audiences have changed through the years. As television grew in popularity in the early 1950's, Hollywood saw its au,.dience staying home for entertainment. Bible epics were created as a result to bring its public. Actresses in these \beads and sandal movies,\ as Sayre termed them, were still beautiful and \made to look ageless.\ Only recently h;we actresses like Jane Fonda played their true ages. The individuality of today's women's characters, Sayre re- emphasiZed, simply did not exist in the 1950's. It was a process that ~ook time, but many negative sterotypes still may be found today. The talk discussed much of Sayre's most recent novel, Ru~g .Time: Fllms of the COld War. Prior to this work Ms. Sayre gained a National Book Award nomination for Sixties Going on Seventies in 1974. Ms. Sayre was a film critic for the New York_ Times. Sayre is presently working on a book about the 1950's which she defines to be a cultural history; it will discuss attitudes, states and ment'alities existing and associated with the decade. 81& IRIJTHER$--8/G SISTERS Group Calendar for Spring 1983 .

Sometimes Dre-ams Do By JODI COHEN Staff gver Since Mountebanks, the oldest College theater organization in the nation was reestablished at Union in 1980, the group has taken on a .new dimension. Whereas the original Mountebanks relied almost entirely on professional directors and established scripts, this new group is taking on the challenge of producing totally original shows. Since 1980, Union audiences have applauded the talent and in- novation -of those involved in Noah was a Righteous Man and a Damn Good Carpenter; too ... or Noah's Nott, and Student Bodies Which were student written and produced, and Rebel written and directed by Daro Beninati, technical director of Union theater. Each of these three was an e~­ periment which differed from · anything previously seen · at Union. Along comes_ another ex- periment, equally as daring, equally as innovative. This particular one is entitled, \Not Like Dreams Do\. The book is written by Julie Baretz, the music is by Joel Beckerman and the lyrics by John Cozzi. It is being directed by Bambi Schlauch and choreographed by Jean Carney. Originally the impetus to undertake this project came from senior John Cozzi, who was interested In doing a musical, but not a typical one. Holding Julie Baretz as captive audience _on a ride home, he persuaded her to write the script. Around the same time, he proposed his idea to· Joel Beckerman who had written the music for Student Bodies last year. \My persuasion was not incredibly effectual at first,\ laughs Cozzi., ''buthe eventually broke down.\ The play itself centers around Michael Jordan, a mid 20.:ish executive, rising in a large corporation. The authors are careful not to divulge much more than that about the plot for fear of \giving it away.\ They will say that it is a one-act musical drama and that the entire play is about Michael's conflict. Baretz says that the purpose of all the other characters - such as family friends and co-workers is to show the audience more about Michael, thereby revealing more about the nature of his conflict. When asked about the plot of the play, Baretz says \I tell people one of two things: Either that the play is about a college graduate confronting- the real world or the conflict between reality and idealism. \The main issue of the play is compromise,\ Cozzi e:lq)lains. \We take the liberty .of setting up an idealist and shattering his ideals.\ · The play has an interesting evolution. The original idea for the play was based upon per- sonal religious conflicts. Cozzi wanted a chance to create a character to express his disillusionment with the Church. \People will go to church to pray and believe and then ig~,9re church doctrine in their daily lives,\ he says. \I wanted to express my conflict between the religion of the church . and a greater morality.\ For Baretz, her involvement stems 'from her concern with the sometimes disillusioning relationship of the American Jewish community to Israel and the phenomenon of ''chec}(book Zionism.\ \At this point we realized that what we had was Chariots of Fire,\ laughs Cozzi. Their biggest problem was coming up with something believable and realistic that has not been done before. \We· caine up with phenomenal ideas· but kept finding movies or plays such as- Monsignor and Nine which treated the same issues,\ ex- plains Baretz. One of their major obstacles was the lack of a book to take their characters from. \If we had a boolt, M says B~uetz, \and we wanted to put the characters in a certain situation we could refer back to it, to see how he should behave. The hardest part was starting from nothing.'' In Uildettaking an original script, the authors spent three weeks of discussion just to define characters. A word or note could not be committed to paper .until they were completely familiar with the people they were creating. Once the-script was com- pleted, the project was turned over to Bambi Schlauch. All the creators took part in the casting, however. What they expected was a harrowing evening of conflict and com- promise, particularly between director and composer over the choice of the right man for the right role. As it turned out, the two were in complete agreement. \We were looking for the same things in our cast members. We were particularly interested in the actors' ability to give an honest interpretation of music and lyrics, and an ability to take direction,\ says Beckerman. They all agree that what makes this an attractive project to all is the excitement of creating characters for the first time, pulling them off the page and making them live. One of the unique aspects-of the show is the use of musical narration throughout. Music takes place durilitg Non-time or \surreal time,\ as Beckerman calls it. At the point where musical narration interrupts the dramatic action, time ceases to be linear: These narratives . play a very important role ·in 'c;haracter development since they are expressions of the subconsCious struggles within the characters themselves. They are clandestine thoughts exposed during suspended time. Therein lies- the strongest deviation of this show from a typic~l Broadway musical. The authors claim that unlike in a typical musical, these moments of song are not superimposed on the script in order to add bits of description or advance the plot. They are moments of intense WOMEN'S WEEK -CABARET T_HU·RSDAY, APRI.L 14 8:45 & 10:45 . ... WOMEN'S NETWORK -LAUREN FINK -KAREN WEISGERBER -PLUS ... M.C.: RENEE HABER · . beer &wine with proper IP · character development where song lyrics are just as im- portant as spoken lines .. Director Schlauch explains, \this is not a musical comedy. Songs are scenes, not ap- pendages of scenes. Sometimes scenes come out ·of songs.\ She goes on to explain that all thinking and commenting on stage is done musically. The last scene of the play certainly deviates from the Broadway norm. It is entirely a musical number involving virtually the entire cast which expresses the subconscious conflict which has bunt up in Michael's mind. J oei Beckerman, composer, describes his music as a fusion . of jazz and rock. unlike in his last project, Student Bodies, where he felt pressured by lack · of time (He wrote the score in a week and a half), he feels that this show gives him . the. op- portunity to reacha higher level of complexity. ''Student Bodies was not meant to be a musical,'' he says. \People were not screened .for their musical ability.'' Thus, he had to restrict his musical demands upon the cast members. Atthough Beckerman's background is · mostly rooted in classical music and Jazz, he composed a rockn style show because it best reflects the action of the play. The repetition inherent in rock characterizes the continuous circular pattern of thoughts which reoccur to the main character as he approaches an incident from different angles; The show is being choreographed by senior, Jean Carney. She points out that the dancing in the show will not be traditional. \It is more like movement than dance,\ she explains. There will be no splashy dance nwnbers because the show, by nature does not call for them. Movement will be used to enhance the music and action on stage. Director Bambi Schlauch, a veteran of the Union stage hopes that Not Like Dreams Do will be the culmination of her theatrical career here. Although she has spent the majority of her hours in the Nott in the limelight, she is eager to · take on a different role. Even though she is technically in a _ position of authority, \It is not wielded.\ she says. ''The cast is the people who are performing, and I am the observer on the outside looking in. I can point out things to them that they cannot see because I have a different perspective.\ Joel Beckerman, Julie Baretz and John Cozzi Schlauch feels that her role as director is to stimulate actors to make choices on stage and think about what they are saying and doing. It was Schlauch who named the show. \Reality can work for you, but not like dreams do,\ she states. ''We all have dreams but should realize that what we fantasize is not what will come about. One must have the foresight to compromise one's dreams to fit real life. One cannot divorce dreams .from reality and expect them to work. Cozzi adds, \The main theme of the show is com- promise and the re'\elation of its necessity. It is something that everyone has to deal with, especially those of us who are about to take the jump from living in college, an idealistic state, into the real world. We start to realize that it is great to have certain ideals, but one has to live every day.\ The authors emphasize that Not Like Dreams Do is different bqt not bizarre. It is a show with a message but it is not heavy. Life is funny and comedy lies in real life situations. I Comedy Workshop By CHRIS HAND Over the past weekend, the Union College Mountebanks hosted 2 professional comics who came here to participate in a Comedy Workshop. The comics--Paul Guskin and Laurie Barnett--amazed the Union partiCipants. Unfor- tunately, only a dozen or so students attended. Those who ignored this special opportunity missed a special treat. It was a two day affair that ended in what could be called a ''festival of food.\ It started from more modest beginnings. Mr. Guskin and Ms. Barnett began with what ap- peared to be a simple, serious lecture on the nature of the things that make people laugh. After a few quickly stifled yawns, they changed the pace by putting the participants into scenes. Small sections of plays and musicals were analyzed for their eornic content, or lack thereof. Some of the works analyzed included Tbe · Importance of Being Earnest, Bye Bye Birdie, Luv and School for Scandal. After that a quick lunch break was taken, featuring a fantastic salad made by Daro Beninati. After lunch, the discussion and participation veered towards freer forms of comedy, such as improvisation and stand-up. These bits were lots of fun. Their performance was a mosiac of bits and pieces of the history of comedy. Better bits inc I uded ''Telephone,\ originally done by Mike Nichold and Elaine May and an excerpt from The Importance of Being Earnest. Sunday morning, the group returned to the Nott for an orgasmic brunch of Bloody Mary's and Steak and Eggs. Guskin and Barnett then held mock auditions, a great aid for those funny people who wanted to continue in life, being funny. The weekend was very suc- cessful and enjoyable for those participating. . Unfortunately, too many people missed out on this opportunity. · THE UNION COLLEGE ARTS DEPARTMENT PRESENTS An American Premiere SUNVAV, APRIL 1'7, 1983 <Lt 8:00PM UN1 ON COLLEGE MEMORIAL CHAPEL Sche~ecladq, Netu Yolt.k T-i.cf<U.O: $6. 50 a.du.U& $!.50 otllcletW./ oCJr.ioJt: cA.-Uzem. r.i.ckao aJte ocva.Uttbte .a.t the Clilt~eg.i.e Cea.teJt Box 0 0 6-i.ce and the Vepalt.tl»e•l-t o 6 the lvr.:tA, U.Uon Co.U.ege; -Itt t;he. doo>r.; and co ... u..Uy Sol< 066-ic\-4: P'Wc.tOl!A Mea.de,. 370-0047 Colo >til?- -Cellte.n., 4 58-7 530 .

Finally the Math Department .has put forth a proposal to eliminate the borqerline fraud committed by students who ,seek to exploit the academic advantages they were given in high school. This department and the AAC have seen a need to end a situation perceived as only a joke by some students, While it has caused a great deal of anguish for others. The whole idea of an introductory course such as Calculus 10 is to introduce the material to the student; not to provide a review session for those who have already taken the course and want an \easy A.\ The existing situation not only allows an unfair advantage to some for the all-importan~ GP A, but it creates a blatant injustice for those who register for the course to act\lally learn something. They struggle for a decent grade, while the veterans are afforded the luxury of skipping class and blowing off homework. · The proposal has now been made and indications show it well on the way to success. We urge Professor Phaup and the entire AAC to approve this measure as soon as possible, so that we can avoid subjecting another of Union's classes to this gross academic inequity. The Plague A serious disease has invaded our campus; one for which there appears to be no cure. Hundreds of undergrads have fallen prey to a vicious epidemic of apathy that is taking its toll on student activities. The officers of eight clubs and organizations failed to submit budgets for 1983-84 student activity funding by Tuesday's deadline.. They consequently run the risk of receiving no funds, since the already submitted budgets total over $100,000 more than the Forum has to allocate. Only twelve people met the original deadline for thirteen open committee chair positions, and even after the COC extended the deadline and publicized the openings, a total.of 28 made the effort to apply. These positions are supposed to be prestigious, but there is little esteem in being selected for an honor when you are the only one who has applied! If our sQ.ldent activities are to survive in any respectable form, we must stop this trend o:f apathy now_ In this season of committee seats and club offices changing hands, let's take an interest in our school, be conscientious in the jobs we have, and put some competition back into these positions.

I say this because I don't think the draft - registration law is fair and because I think that, in some cases, including this one, it'.s okay to defy the law. I suppose that draft proponents might respond that if someone is going to deliberately not register, well, that's okay, we won't prosecute you, but we wi:ll ta,ke away your financial aid. What is the intent of that? William Safire has said that the motive is simple: these non-registrants are leeches who take money from taxpayers, but wouldn't ·-fight to defend the country. I think that's how a lot of people feel. If so, it's clear that people don't think it's okay not to register. Now, I don't think these people are being guided by the assumption that every law should be obeyed, no matter what. Exceeding the speed limit is a form of law- breaking, though most people are not trying to make a statement by speeding; they're just trying to get somewhere a little faster. The same goes for writing up double bills of sale to avoid some sales tax - they're just trying to save a little money. They think the sales tax is too high, or, what's more likely, that's how they justify what they're doing. They don't understand people who break laws because of principles. For example, one person might cheat on their income tax to save money (or for the thrill of telling friends that he or she fleeced the government) and maybe justify it to themselves by saying that income tax rates are way too high these days anyway. That person often doesn't understand someone who refuses to pay a portion of their tax because they are against weaponry being built with their mflney. The effect, however, is the same in both cases. The government is deprived of revenue.

Eventually, the United States will be dlrectly threatened, and by fighting in places like Vietnam, we nip the problem in the bud.

It's a problem. of perspective; not being a small ~ country with little or no rnilitary force, we don't understand what it's like to have foreign armies come in and fight on our soil. The sometimes indiscriminate killing ·of North ·and South Vietnamese was indefensible. However, how can we stop Communism if riot by fighting in countries where it fs trying to establish itself? Is it unrealistic in the scenario just advanced to renounce military action and embrace diplomacy? I think not.

Page 8 CONCORDIENSIS, April 14, 1983 OlvltOlrbirnsis FourukcJ. al Umon College! 1817 ------------ ----------- Pass or Fail? Finally the Math Department has put forth a proposal to eliminate the borderline fraud committed by students who seek to exploit the academic advantages they were given in high school. This department and the AAC have seen a need to end a situation perceived as only a joke by some students, while it has caused a great deal of anguish for others. The whole idea of an introductory course such as Calculus 10 is to introduce the material to the student; not to provide a review session for those who have already taken the course and want an ''easy A.'' The existing situation not only allows an unfair advantage to some for the all-important GP A, but it creates a blatant injustice for those who register for the course to actually learn something. They struggle for a decent grade, while the veterans are afforded the luxury of skipping class and blowing off homework. The proposal has now been made and indications show it well on the way to success. We urge Professor Phaup and the entire AAC to approve this measure as soon as possible, so that we can avoid subjecting another of Union's classes to this gross academic inequity. The Plague A serious disease has invaded our campus; one for which there appears to be no cure. Hundreds of undergrads have fallen prey to a vicious epidemic of apathy that is taking its toll on student activities. The officers of eight clubs and organizations failed to submit budgets for 1983-84 student activity funding by Tuesday's deadline. They consequently run the risk of receiving no funds, since the already submitted budgets total over $100,000 more than the Forum has to allocate. Only twelve people met the original deadline for thirteen open committee chair positions, and even after the COC extended the deadline and publicized the openings, a total.of 28 made the effort to apply. These positions are supposed to be prestigious, but there is little esteem in being selected for an honor when you are the only one who has applied! If our stJ,:tdent activities are to survive in any respectable form, we must stop this trend of apathy now. In this season of committee seats and club offices changing hands, let's take an interest in our school, be conscientious in the jobs we have, and put some competition back into these positions. They look good on resumes, too ... Writers Are Needed for News, Features, Arts and Sports!

By CHRIS ESHELMAN I don't think there should be any punishment of any sort for draft non-registrants. I say this because I don't think the draft registration law is fair and because I think that, in some cases, including this one, it's okay to defy the law. I suppose that draft proponents might respond that if someone is going to deliberately not register, well, that's okay, we won't prosecute you, but we will ta.ke away your financial aid. What is the intent of that? Wimam Safire has said that the motive is simple: these non-registrants are leeches who take money from taxpayers, but wouldn't fight to defend the country. I think that's how a lot of people feel. If so, it's clear that people don't think it's okay not to register. Now, I don't think these people are being guided by the asswnption that every law should be obeyed, no matter what. Exceeding the speed limit is a form of law~ breaking, though most people are not trying to make a statement by speeding; they're just trying to get somewhere a little faster. The same goes for writing up double bills of sale to avoid some sales tax - they're just trying to save a little money. They think the sales tax is too high, or, what's more likely, that's how they justify what they're doing. They don't understand people who break laws because of principles. For example, one person might cheat on their income tax to save money (or for the thrill of telling friends that he or she fleeced the governrnnent) and maybe justify it to themselves by saying that income tax rates are way too high these days anyway. That person often doesn't understand someone who refuses to pay a portion of their tax because they are against weaponry being built with their meney. The effect, however, is the same in both cases. The government is deprived of revenue. No, what really turns people's stomachs when they think of draft resisters and draft non- registrants is not that, \My SENIORS Are you planning · any events for YOUR Weekend? A COMMinEE IS NEEDED!

' ' I.E.F. Deadline By JACK ANDERSON and JOE SPEAR WASffiNGTON -The second civil war in four years is currently raging ·in Nicaragua. ·Our associate Jon Lee Anderson has been traveling with the · · rebel forces inside the country. Here is a recent report: The man· directing the in- ·vasion of Nicaragua is Enrique Bermudez, who used to be the defense attache in Washington for the late dictator Anastasio Somoza. As J;Jermudez explains it, the main attack on Nicaragua is eQming from Honduras in the north. Miskito Indian guerrillas are operating on the Atlantic Coast in the northeast. FinaUy, another rebel group is maneuvering along the Costa Rican border to the south. Bermudez: says he is directing the three-pronged civil war from Honduras by means of a central command center inside Nicaragua. He uses bqth human messengers and coded radio communications. The deadline for proposals for the Internal Educati.on Foundation in two categories --student- ' . initicsted resemrch proiects and \educationally in- , · novative proiects\ falls on May 6. Government forces have retreated, says Bermudez, leaving the rebels a chance to occupy territory and distribute arms to the native population. The · most significant development, the exile leader claims, is the way the peasants have rallied to the rebel cause . He predicts the civil war will be largely a rural operation, and he is confident that his forces will control the countryside. Proposals for student•iQitiated research projects must ~e the written approval of a faculty advisor who has agreed to supervise· the project. The . proposals should be submitted. to the Dean's Office (Sl 00, Science & Engineering Building) on forms available there. Similarly, members of the College community .who have \educati~nally innovative\ proposals should submit them to the same office on forms available there. Guidelines with respect. tQ the I.E~F., are available in the Dean's Office. Inquiries should be direded to Dr. Ilene M. Kaplan, Associate Dean of. Faculty. Thus the situation ·in Nicaragua appears to be similar to that in El Salvador: The govE!rnment controls the cities while the rebels control the outback. The difference is ~ that in Nicaragua it's the lef~ tists who are trying to defend the cities against anti- communists in the hills. Bermudez insists his people will keep fighting \as long as there is a Marxist-Leninist AMaLGaMaTeD BL.i DGeT&, LTD. regime in Managua.\ DEADLY LOOPHOLE: A dangerous loophole in the nation's environmental laws permits businesses that generate up to one ton of toxic wastes each month to dispose of them in c-ity dilrtlpS. But un- fortunately, such dumps were never constructed to handle tqxic wastes. Under the loophole for small industries., even the most deadly of chemicals, including , dioxins and PCBs, can be dumped in urban sites - as long as the monthly total for each business does not exceed one tQn. This adds up: Nearly 2.7 million tons of toxic wastes are dumped in city sites every year. This is nearly six percent of the nation's hazardous wastes. Last year, former Environmental Protection . Agency Acfministrator Anne Burford teamed up with in- dustrial bigwigs and suc- cessfully defeated a legislative. effort to close the loophole. Now that she is no longer around, Congress will try again.- FAMILY AFFAIR: After the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, the Kremlin installed as its puppet president former deputy premier Babrak Karmal. He left his wife behind in Czechoslovakia, where he had been living in exile and took up residence with a mistress in the presidential palace in Kabul. Karma I' s mistress was assigned to oversee at least three government ministries. Her brother landed a lucrative post as the head of the National Institute of Carpets. Rugs and carpets are among Afghanistan's leading exports. Karmal then selected his own first cousins as the chief of the secret .police, the nlinister of • defense, the minister of finance, the ambassador to Hungary and the charge in Washington, D.C. Another first cousin was named to a high public-:-health post.

Last week in Union's opening triangular meet with RPI and Norwich, Britton shined. He won the 100 meter in 10.8 seconds and then the 200 meter in 22.5 seconds. In addition to his two individual victories, Britton also contributed to the winning 4x100 relay team, which won in 45 seconds. As a member of the indoor OONCORDIENSIS, A.pril1~, 1983. Athlete of the Week track team this past winter, Winston was third in: the state 400 meter with a time of 50.65 seconds. He also won the Union Invitational Track Meet's 400 meter with a time of 50.5 seconds. Britton, ~ transfer from Bethany:.College, hails from the Bronx, N.Y. He attended the Cardinal Spellman High School where he was the Catholic High School Athletic Association's 200 meter champ in 1980.

Players allowed their instincts to overrule their heads. On the positive side Union defended well, leading the way in tackling was fly-half Andy Klumpp, and there was an exciting run which got the crowd cheering by fellow rookie Allan Markus. Again congratulations to the home side for tying with a team containing over half '~' team players. The final game of the af .. ternoon was Union 'C' against Schenectady 'C'. Both sides fielded about ten 'C' team players and filled in with people who wanted a second game. To my knowledge this is the first time in Union College history that a sport representing our college has fielded three dif- ferent teams on the same day. This must surely be a good thing both for the college and for the Rugby Club. Let's all hope that this unprecedented support from both spectators and players continues for what is a great game. This coming Saturday Union's A' antt 'B' squads play away at the Sienna and Albany State tournaments respectively. The 'A' team includes: (forwards) John Tierney, Marc Soloway, Meade ·summers, Pete Ladd, Ed Hart, Keith Dean, Jody Carlin, Doug Baumgarten; (backs) Steve Patterson, Eric Serilli, John Wilbur, Walter Fredericks, Kyle Woodman, Tom Jengo, Scott Collins; (sub) Bob Waaler.

SPORTS Alerting the media ••• Sports Talk With SCOTT WYKOFF Sports Staff. Over the last few years many of the Union ·College athletic teams have enjoyed banner seasons. With good campaigns comes recognition for the coaches and players who make ithappen on the field. Members of the campus conununity and · fans ftom the area read and hear .about these coaches and top players in the Schenectady media and through the college's newspaper and radio stations. If not for the one-man show performed by George Cuttita from his tiny second floor office in Lamont House, none of these successful teams would ever gain the media and print at- tention that they warrant. George A. Cuttita III is Union College's Sports Information Director (SID). He works (rom behind the scenes to· publicize the fortunes of the many men's and women's varsity teams at Union. In the late seventies and early eighties Union College realized the importance of a strong and well-rounded athletic program for the overall benefit of the school. The signing of new coaches for key positions and the renovation of the fieldhouse along with the new astroturf field were im- portant moves made by the school to upgrade its program. A major step in the positive direction was the school's decision to hire George Cuttita as its first full-time SID in August of 1980. George is a graduate of Shenendahowa High School and Albany State University. A strong background in writing is very important for any SID and Cuttita built his base by receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree upon his graduation from Albany. The majority of George's time., when not at athletic contests, is taken up by the tough task of continually pumping out articles and press releases of timely importance. George spent his first working years as a sports writer for two of the Capital District's top newspapers. In April of 1973 Cu.ttita joined the sports staff at the Times-Union and worked as a reporter for one year. It was time to move on and the young Cuttita became assistant scholastic editor for the Schenectady Gazette for the following four years. The ex- perience be received from his daily work on these two newspapers prepared him for the duties he took over at Union in the fall of 1980. George wears many hats in his job as Union's SID and always seems to enjoy all the tasks he is asked to perform. He often works as an artist as he handles a majority of the photography chores of his office while creating the informative programs for our football, basketball and hockey teams. He also acts as a public relations man for the institution as he works diligently to saturate the local me~a with Dutchmen athletic news. It is his job to keep the many local television and newspaper reporters happy and up--to-date by supplying them with more information than they need to make their job of reporting Union sports .an easy one. George continually updates team .stats throughout the season and makes sure all concerned parties receive them when needed. When Union Dutchmen teams are presented favorably in the local media, an increase of local fans at sporting events and increased revenue for the Athletic Department is often the result. Prior to the hiring of Cuttita, the respective coaches and team managers were continually bogged down with the responsibilities of informing the local press daily. With their many existing responsibilities, sports i{lformation seemed to take a back seat which caused a lack of strong coverage of Union athletics. George has a fine rapport with the media and caters to each and every one of their needs. The results can be seen daily. A day rarely goes by without a Dutchmen article running in a local-paper or over the broadcast media. This exposure spurs interest for the Athletic Department. George's many hours behind his word processor and on the road with the Dutchmen benefit many other aspects of the Union community. He is. always sending out articles \datelined Schenectady\ to players' hometown papers to help saturate the entire United States with the fortunes of Union's athletic teams. This acts as a great tool for the recruitment of all students for possible admission to our school. People from all backgrounds, with all sorts of interests are able to see the name of Union in print because of the hard work produced by Union's fourth-year SID. Alumni love to see the old alma mater in their , local morning paper and it often puts them back in touch with the in- stitution they once attended. Top athletes also read about hometown friends playing on strong Dutchmen teams and look into possibly applying for admission. George acts as the top players' press agent as he helps present them in a strong light to those who select post-season all- star teams as well as to those who present post-season honors. Union stars like Bodmer, _ Fobare, and Clinton credit Cuttita with playing\ a major role in their post-season laurels. Hats off to George C~ttita for all his fine work as Union's behind the scenes man in charge of sports information. Another one of the many members of _the Union campus community who never receives the recognition that they so wholeheartedly deserve. SPORTSLINE Live Over the Air MONDAYS 11:30 P.M. WRUC 90.9 FM

Student Journal Faces Uncertain Future By MARCY BURSTINER News Editor A stupent research journal , published recently, which had previously received an IEF Grant; has been beld over for additional funding. Unless further funds are uncovered .for this unprecedented project; the issue which came out last week may be the only one that the administration, faculty and students will see. The Union College Undergraduate Review of Humanities and Social Sciences is a compUation of·· research studies completed by students of the College, and of other colleges similar to Union in both size and undergraduate academic quality. The project, irtitiated by students Win Thurlow, Jeff Van Detta, and Dave Wollin, is the first of its kind here at Union and, as Wollin in hi!'! enthusiasm claims, is also the only one of its kind in the nation. Its purpose, ~s explained in the Journal 1tself, is to \provide a forum •.. by which student research could b7 acknowledged and elicit discussion within the academic community.\ · · The Internal Education Fo'Qndation {IEF), although it offers grants for student and faculty research, generally offers the monetary awards for the purpose of getting the project started. It is only a ~hort term funding organization and has rarely continued grants to any one project for more than· one or two times, according to Jay' Newman, Chairman of the IEF and Assistant Professor of Physics. The publication is an im- portant step for Union, for it gives the school, as Martha Huggins, Professor in the Sociology Department com- mented, ''very good publicity as a school that is involved .in solid student research.\ \It adds frosting on the cake for Uhion,'' she remarked. Huggins, one. of the two faculty members on the editorial board along With Professor Thomas Warger of the Modern Languages Department, · is deeply conc~rned over the dubious fate of the journal now that the IEF Grant has been stalled. ''We don't want to have to worry about IEF Grants in- definitely,'' She went on. \This is not a fly-by-night opet·ation,\ Wollin added. \This is something that will enhance the quality of the education of the College, and. if one part .of the College does not fund this th~n it ·seems that they're lacking in a certain com- II\ittment to this type of project.\ ''Union has always been known as a school that supports and fosters undergraduate education above all else, and I think the journal is the epitomy of what Union can do with un- dergraduate education,\ Van Dett~ also added. Sexual Harassment p. 3 The three editors are hoping that now that the first issue bas been published and is being distributed among the ad- ministration and faculty, in- terest will be generated and support for continuation of the project will grow. Unfor- tunately they have no definite avenues for money to which they can turn. \We're broke,\ Wollin remarked. \We have no money,\ Thul'low stated. \When we applied initially for funding, IEF said 'no' on two grounds. One, they generally don't fund a project after its initial starting period, and secondly at the time we requested additional funding the journal hadn't been published and we really hadn't anything to show them. For them to give us a grant of $3,000 was unusually large in the first place, and for them to give it to us again would have been a gamble I think on their part.\ The idea for the project arose, according to the three students, when Wollin and Thurlow were invited to attend a New Mexico con{erence to present a study they had completed for Huggins' \Methods of Social Research\ class. \We were thinking it really is a shame that other people don't have a chance to have their work recognized ... and so we thought wouldn't it be nice if there were some kind of forum for people to have their research and really fine articles ... to be published some place and let other people know about them other than just the professor,\ Thurlow ,elaborated. After speaking with several ptQfessors · from various departments they drew up a proposal to IEF, included two faculty members on their editorial review staff, received the funding, and were ready to begin. This process though was not an easy task in itself, they claim. In order to get the grant, the entire structure of the journal had to be drawn up. \It was very difficult to do this,\ Van Detta commented, \because you had to decide what the outcome woUld be before you woUld really start planning anything . . . you had to say 'this is what we want as a finished product' before we actually saw what we would get.\ \Then there was the idea that, well listen, this would be nice for Union, but why don't we expand this and get other schools involved too, and create an entire network of exchanging undergraduate studies and of giving people the opportunity at other schools to see what we do at Union, and so that we at Union can find out what they're doing at other schools,\ Van Detta explained. Forty-five letters were sent to other schools and four papers were submitted through this channel. Of these, one was chosen for the issue; it was a research study on sexual preference written by a student at ClarkUniversity. \The papers from Union Continued on page ~

Jn~hlef Representatives from United Campuses to Prevent NuClear War (UCAM) were informed at the Aprilll Forum meeting that their organization is not eligible to receive student activity funds. The Forum, giving its decision on UCAM'.s request for monies to Chris Eshelman and Barry Tils, explained that guidelines prohibit funding of interest groups.

The result of this collaboration between the two servic~s was a· panel discussion on an~relia nervosa-,bulimia entitled_ \Learn how to reach out\ held on Wednesday, April 13. The panel leading the discussion included Gail George, a psychotherapist who deals with anorexic patients, Nan Wmdmuller, a nutritionist,. Dr. Peter Purcell, a physician, and two college student$ who shared their experiences with these two eating disorders. The auclience, on the other hand, included health and food service professionals from colleges including Russell Sage and Union, professionals frOm the various hospitals in the SChenectady-Albany area, and Union students. The purpose of this panel discllSSion was to talk about the problems of anorexia nervosa and bUlimia, to see how they have affected college cam- puses, and to see if cllmpus programs can be developed to alleviate some of the problems. Because the goals of this discussion panel were varied and because the panel was attempting to meet the needs of both students and doctors, the panel tried to encompass both clinical and personal ex- periences with anorexia ner- vosa and bulimia. Recognizing that about 13 percent of the college age population will probably be bulimic, this discussion in- cluded the personal experiences shared by the two students. One student revealed her ex- periences with bulimia which are still continuing. Bulimia; by definition, is ail eating disorder whereby periods of extreme binge eating are· followed by vomiting. She shared her ex- periences with the audience by indicating her daily schedule last summer. She wpuld spend the day at work and than at the beach until the dinner hour without eating any meals. At dinner she would consume excessive amounts .of food; and then soon after, she would vomit because she would feel guilty for eating that much food. This activity continued every day during th~ summer tintil she eventually realized that she was out of control. Bulimia, she said from her experience, usually affects those students, mainly girls in their older teenage y.ears, who have low self- . esteem, who are preoccupied with dieting, a11d who cannot communicate their problems. The other student included on this panel also suffered from an eating disorder, anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa, by definition, is the loss of hunger _resulting from the willful voluntary choice not to eat. The fatality rate of this disorder, estimated between five and twenty percent, indicates the seriousness of this disorder antl therefore rules out the idea of treating it as a \phase\ that a teenager .passes through. Recent attention has been focused. on this disorder due to the death of Karen Carpenter, a smg~r who had suffered from anorexia nervosa before her death. The syillptoms of this disorder are · numerous and include enormous weight loss, lethargy, sickly appearance, extreme sen8itivity to cold, loose hair, tingling sensations, and a pale skin. The college student who participated in the panel discussion revealed that after working out at a body-building place last summer, she felt \very good\ about herself. Later, she started working and was also helping out at home due to her mother'S hospital stay. All these pressures on her time made her less concerned about herself and. gradually this 5'7\ teenager's weight had dropped to 93 pounds. After many emotional battles with her parents, she continued to lose weight until she realized that at 85 poun~s she was becoming physically sick from her extensive weight loss. At this point, she decided that she needed help and became in- volved with a psychotherapist, a nutritionist, and a self-help group. With the support of these three entities, she is gradually being cured. The psychotherapist in this panel discussion revealed the necessity of . having the nutritionist, the family, and the self~help group there to support the patient. The nutritionist's role is to make sure that the anorexic gradually puts on the weight by following a carefully monitored diet developed by both the patient and the nutritionist. The self-help group's role is to give the anorexic an opportunity to share her experiences with other ·anorexics. Finally, the psychotherapist, the family, and the patient work together to treat the actual disorder through therapy sessions. The panel stressed that the best w~y that a friend can help one with one of tnese two eating disorders i~ to provide support for the patient by encouraging her to talk about it. The anorexic or bulimic ·patient really oeeds to decide for herself that she needs to be helped but supporrcan greatly aid this process. The director of health, s.er- vices at Union, Doris Richards, stressed that this panel discussion was the first step in trying to combat the problem on the campus. Other features of her plan include collaborating with both the food and coun- seling services to determine the extent of the problem and to provide a way of treating anorexia nervosa-,bulimia on this campus. She also indicated a need to work with the residence advisors in the fall term of next year, and therefore be able to provide a more beneficial program on anorexia nervosa-,bulimia. monies must support the view$ at Union., . ·overseeing .the of the student body as a whole, spending of a $250,000 grant and no exceptions can be made. . from the A.P.

He then joined one of Philadelphia's largest law firms, Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis. In 1969, Adams became a member of the Court of Appeals of the Third. Circuit c, in Philadelphia. While active in his profession, Adams has maintained in- volvement ih the educational system. Not only has he been Judge Arlin Adams among the faculty of both the American Institute of Banking and of the University of Penn- sylvania Law School, but he has also served as. Trustee at several institutions within the realm of the University of Pennsylvania, including the law school, the medical school, and the School of Social Work. In addition, he has· also been involved as the Chairman of the Advisory Board at the School of Social Work at Bryn Mawr College as well as trustee. Presently, he participates on the Board of Overseers of the Wharton School, Board of Advisors of Columbia University Center for Law and Economic Studies, Chainnan of the Board of Trustees at the Fels Institute of State and Local Government of the University of Pennsylvania. Adams has also found the time to be active in the Bar Association, both in Philadelphia and on the national level. In the community, Adams has been active on the boards of several hospitals and foun- dations. Under Governor Scranton, Adams was the secretary of Public Welfare for Pennsylvania. It is evident by his ac- complishments that Judge Adams is eXJierienced in the field of law. During his visit, he will be discussing such issues as the First Amendment, law schools, human rights, and the government. Daniels explained that Adams' week at Union will consist of a public lecture, various visits to classes, a dinner given by President ¥orris, and possibly a meeting with the Schenectady County Bar Association, ;;unong other possibilities. Daniels said that one improvement he would like to make after Raskin's visit is to be able to set .up more informal meetings with Adams, possibly in dorms, where he can meet students and faculty, and speak individually with them. TheWoodrow Wilson National F.ellowsbip Foundation ''created the Visiting Fellows- Program in 1973 to enlighten students about the 'world of practical affairs and to show students that what they are studying is relevant to issues and events outside the realm of the college cCJmmunity .' \ Union has been chosen to participate in the program this year, and will continue receiving Fellows, two per year, for the next two years. Daniels has already begun working on next year's week- long program, trying to find a time in the fall for the Fellow to come, and cboosing the field of interest he would like the next Fellow to .'be involved in. Finally Daniels expressed his en- thusiasm for tbe program and said that he ''hopes we can utilize (the fellows) to the fullest potential. The College's ability to participate in the Visiting Fellows Program was made possible by a generous grant from the John Ben Snow Foundation, Inc. APPLY NOW!

Other keys to finding these networks can be found in two books on the subhect which Tobie'ssen recommends: What Marshall Berman, the author of All That Is Solid Melts Into Air. will be at Union College Monday, April 25, to present a lecture sponsored by the Minerva Committee. His talk, titled \The Artist in the City: Lower East Side\ will be held at 8 p.m. in the Strauss Lounge, Carnegie Hall, and is open to the public. Berman is a professor of political science at the City University of New York, and has taught at Stanford and the University of New Mexico. His articles have appeared in The New York Times Book Review, The Nation, Ramparts, Par~ tisan Review, and Dissent. Berman is the author of The Politics. of Authenticity as well as All That Is Solid Melts Into Air, which discusses moder- nism in the arts and the modernization of society. Health Care Talk SCHENECTADY-Or. Ira M. Rutkow will discuss \Health Care and Unnecessary Surgery\ in a talk at Union College Thursday, April 28; The Administrative and Engineering Syst·ems Colloquium will begin at 3:45 p.m. in Bailey Hall, Room 312, and is open to the public. Rutkow graduated from Union in 1970 with a combined major of biology and sociology and obtained his M.D. from Saint Louis University School of Medicine. His surgical residency was done at Boston City Hospital and Johns Hopkins. He also obtained his master's and doctorate in public health at Johns Hopkins. He is currently in private surgical practice and has his own consulting firm dealing with the administration of health care. Rutkow's presentation will cover the history, definitions, rates, decision making, and research related to surgery and will conclude with a discussion of unnecessary operations. Hidden Job Market The recruiting season is almost over on college cam- puses, and many students are saying, \I still don't have a job. Now what?\ Joanne Tobiessen, director of the Career Development Center at Union College, has an answer to that question, and it lies in what is known as the \hidden job market.\ Tobiessen explained that advertised openings comprise only 20 percent of available positions; the remaining 80 percent are usually filled by friends of employees, others known somehow to the com- pany, or a person who has made direct contact with· the com- pany. With a poor economy making jobs scarce, it is vital that a student find ways to learn about these unpublicized openings, she said. \Students need to look at the networks that are available to them,\ Tobiessen said: organizations to which the student belongs, friends of parents, college and even high school alumni. At Union, the names and occupations of alumni in related fields are available to ~tudent job seekers, who can contact them for a helping band-a path that has proved very rewarding for ·Color Is Yo11r Parachute? by Richard Bolles and The Hidden Job Market by Tom Jackson. People in these networks should be approached first for information or advice, Tobiessen said. \Ask for suggestions, not a job. This .is more confotta'ble for both parties . .A person may not have a job to offer, but is frequently very pleased to give advice.\ A student's main goal should be to obtain a personal in- terview-the most effective job- search technique, Tobiessen said. \It behooves the job- hunter to creatively and assertively go a.fter personal interviews.'' Tobiessen stressed a student should try to get an interview whether there's a job opening or not, advice particularly im- port;mt to the liberal arts student. \It gives you a chance to demonstrate your interest, your communication skills, and to discuss how your background could benefit that employer.'' This contact will be much more memorable to the employer than a mailed-in resume, she said. At the end of that personal interview, Tobiessen said, \Let them know you'd like to be considered for the next opening. Ask if it would be alright to stay in touch, and then do so.\ Book Published A collection of papers which offers new perspectives on the development of New York State in the .late 18th century titled New Opportunities in a New Nation: The Development of New York After the Revolution has been published by the College and is being distributed by Syracuse University Press. The book, edited by Union professors . Manfred Jonas, Washington Irving Professor in Modern History and Historical Studies, and Robert V. Wells; professor of history, brings together four papers which were .first presented at an October, 1981, conference by the same name at Union. Post-revolutionary New York was selected as the topic for the conference because this period, during which Union was founded, has been relatively neglected by historians; tnough, as Wells points out in his intrOduction to the book,\it probably would have received attention comparable to that given to the Puritan experience or the Virginia planters if it had not occurred just as the new nation took shape.\ The conference, funded by a ' matching grant from Patroni Scholastici, sought to detail this \period of enormous growth for New York,\ ac- cording to Jonas. \New York in this period foreshadows what happened in the rest of the country over the next 50 to 80 years,\ he said. \The papers in this volume,\ Wells writes, • \offer some fascinating insights into the history of New York during· what must be one of the most dynamic and creative periods in the state's past.'' Newport Daytrip A day trip to historic Newport, Rhode Island, is being offered by Union· College's Office of Graduate and Con- tinuing Studies. A bus will leave Union at 6:30. a.m. on May 7 for Newport, the pre-revolutionary capital of the colony of Rhode Island and a great commercial seaport. The morning will focus on colonial Newport with a walk through the Old Brick Market area; along Washington Sq:ua.re with its 17th and 18th Century homes; past Colony House, the Quaker Meeting House, Old St. Paul's Church; and ·back to Bowen's Wharf, the center of shipping untill890. After lunch at Johnny's Seafood Restaurant overlooking the beach and ocean, the bus will tour the coastal section along Ouean Drive .. The group will 1;top to visit Hammersmith Farm, an historic. oceanside estate built in 1887 by John · · Auchincloss, where the wedding reception for Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy was held. Next, the group will visit Marble House, one of the most sumptuous of Newport's \cottages.\ Completed in 1892 for William Vanderbilt, the house is built entirely of marble and contains all the original furnishings. The bus will leave Newport at 5:30 p.m., returning to Schenectady about 9;30 p.m. Nancy Mancini, administrative assistant for Graduate. and Continuing Studies at Union, will be excursion leader, and Peter Stine, associate professor of English at Gordon College, will be tour guide.

On.ISC -· ISC-1n what many in the higher education community viewed as a remarkable demonstration of \fiscal In. teg.rity ·and. dogged d~ter­ mination!'' Governor Cuomo and the legislattve leaders fulfilled their constitutional responsibility late last month as anew state budget of more than $31.5 billion for 1983,114 was adopted by the Legislature. After fouryears in which Aprill came and went without an approved financial plan, the new state administration met its obligation with timely dispatch. Although the budget proposed by the Governor on Febr-uary 1 anticipated personnel reduc. tions at the State and City universities to achieve a balanced spending program, negotiations in the intervening two months. produced a plan that will avoid the layoffs. Funds for CUNY and SUNY in the amount of $9.4 and $10 million, respectively, were restored. Among the means employed to accoiilplish this result, increases in user fees were imposed, including a $300 per year tuition hike at SUNY and a $150 per year tuition hike at CUNY. With respect to those tuition increases for this fall, no students at SUNY -CUNY whose net taxable incomes .are $14,000 . or less will be required to pay additional charges because of the automatic award ·increase they Will · receive fro01 the state's Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), In shar:p contrast, the in- dependent sector lost the equivalent of 1,800 faculty and staff positions this year because of the $40 million in revenue cuts sustained in last f~ll's 7,000 student enrollment decline. For the coming year, our students face a tuition rise expected to ·be at least $600 on weighted average, double that an- ticipated for SUNY's tuition increase. But, unlike needy students .at SUNY and CUNY who will be immune to ,tuition increases and buffered thriJUgh increased TAP, there will be no compensating ·TAP grant rise for independent sector students. In addition, no serious con- sideration was given by either house of the Legislature to the joint proposal of the ISC, Commission On Independent Colleges and Universities (CICU) and Higher Education Opportunity Program Professional Organization (HEOP-PO) to increase HEOP support, the CICU effort to obtain repair in the BUNDY formula which has been static since 1979 or the ISC-CICU request that the $200 TAP \uppercut\ be eliminated. · Student Review Published . Continued from page 1 really were, I think, by and large superior to the papers we got from other schools . . . we also did give a certain con- sideration to the fact that it was our first .issue and we were the Union College Undergraduate Review and that it ·was im- portant while we had such fine papers from Union not to ex- clude them just for the sake of adding pape'rs from other schools,\ Thurlow explained. There are seven papers in- cluded in the f~rst issue, selected from among 13 total submi.ssions. All involved agreed that the number of submissions was a little disappointing but that it was to be expected for the first issue. \We're pretty confident;'' Thurlow added, \that now that an issue is out, that a lot of people's initial apprehension will be overcome. They'll see that we were able to produce something that looks quite professional . . . When the college community here at Union and when other colleges see it we'U be able to generate (more submissions from other areas).\ \We also hope that this will generate research--a student, knowing that there _ _is a possibility of getting published somewhere, -will say to them- selves, \why don't I undertake a project that I wouldn't normally because I could possibly get published,' \ Wollin added. Huggins also commented that the journal offers a way for students, if they are willing to continue that research and revise it, to stand out when compared to other students. She explained that students of Union generally have good grade~. yet upon graduation they will be competing with other students from other quality institations who also have good grades. This represents a practical benefit of being published in the journal. \It makes you stand out on paper,\ she went on.: As a student, ''it is a reality that you are compared . ., Although now that the issue is out, reaction seemingly favorable, and IEF more in- clined to give them a second chance, the journal's creators seek. a more reliable avenue for funds. \We want the administration to include the journal in the line item of the budget,\ Huggins stated. Continuation is the key ingredient, she stressed, because other schools will be less reluctant to submit research if they see that the journal is a publication which comes out year after year and has the backing of the coHege administration. · Dean Mammola (center> accepts award from Sargeant Andy Calvanese, Major Doug Lane, and Captain Reggie Bond, representatives of the U.S. Air Farce for recognition of the College's support of the Air Force Medical Scholarship Program.

Tobiessen began by discussing several factors that contribute to women enjoying their· work. Studies show that women desire recognition for their work, an understanding employer, · and also have very strong needs to relate with other people. Fifty percent of women surveyed liked the people they work with as compared with 43 percent of the men. \Superwoman syndrome,\ which is another name .for · a woman's dual role as housewife and career woman, was also discussed. The general opinion of the group was that men are beginning to take a more active role in the traditional, female household chores·; these chores are simply too much of a burden for most women to handle in addition to a full..,tiine career. The other solution would be to hire someone to do household chores and look after the children. This, needless to say, runs into large amounts of money. The Wellesley study showed that a higM~vel job is the largest single factor con- tributing toward self-esteem. According to this study, one's self-esteem depends on the right combination of roles; a womari with a career and a family will have a high sense of well-being. Women who are married, but childless and unemployed, usually judge themselves as having .a low sense of well- being. Health problems arise when jobs are low in prestige· and salary, high in frustration and insecurity, and when women feel that they are not in control of their lives. Many people derive pleasure from occupations which create large amounts of stress; these jobs do not create large amounts of health problems. According to Michael Mac- cciby's book The Gam.esman, the qualities most important to the average American in- dustrial corporation are the ability to take the initiative, pride in performance, and self- confidence. Friendliness, compassion, and idealism are ranked as the least important qualities. The important thing to consider is what our values are, and in what kind of setting we wish to spend forty years of our lives. Whether one wants to totally commit herself to a high- paying, high·pressure job is a matter o.f choice, and is something to think about. The mest important point .of the discussion was that one should go into a career which fits one's style and values in orderto lead a satisfied and fulfilled life. Women Against Pornography By EMILY LOOSE Staff The delicate and volatile issue of pornography was the center of a discussion and slide show held last Friday in Carnegie Hall sponsored by the Women's Network. The talk was presented by a representative from Women Against Por- nography, a national organization that is protesting this appalling practice as both a symptom and cause of the prevailing social climate which degrades· women. This New York City based-organization of 5,000 members asserts three specific purposes: to raise pornography as a feminist issue; to educate the general society about assorted dangers of pronography; and to bring pornography out of the realril of socially acceptable diversion. The speaker differentiated pornography from erotica which is the erotic stenuning fro;m. sexual freedom. Por- nography was defined as stemming from an implied sexual power imbalance, that is a male domination of the f.e:male. Pornog1'aphy, ac- C()rding to this defination, consists not of nudity or of sexual images or innuendoes alone, but of the depiction of nudity or such sexual images in a manner degrading to women. This degradation follows three basic lines. The first asserts that women are sexually masochistic. The second views women as the sum of their sexual parts. And the last suggests that women sholild be unconditionally sexually available. In reference to the danger of pornography, evidence was presented of the cumulative effect of such\anti- woman propaganda\ and the desensitization to such degradation resulting from what the organization considers the penetration of pornography into mainstream publications. This presentation consisted largely of subliminal ad- vertisements, suggesting rather than showing., sexual op- pression.

Tobiessen began by discussing several factors that centribute to women enjoying their work. Studies show that women desire recognition for their work, an understanding employer, a11d also have very strong needs to relate with other people. Fifty percent of women surveyed liked the people they work with as compared with 43 percent of the men. \Superwoman syndrome,\ which is another name for a woman's dual role as housewife and career woman, was also discussed. The general opinion of the group was that men are beginning to take a more active role in the traditional, female household chores; these chores are simply too much of a burden for most womer:~ to handle in addition to a fultl-time career. The other solutien weuld be to hire someene te do household chores and look after the children. This, needless to say, runs into large amounts of money. The Wellesley study showed that a high-level job is the largest single factor coR- tributing toward self-esteem. According to this study, one's self-esteem depends on the right combination ef roles; a woman with a career ar:~d a family will have a high sense of well-being. Women wbo are married, but childless and unemployed, usually judge themselves as having a low sense of well- being. Health preblems arise when jobs are low in prestige and salary, high in frustration and insecurity, and when women feel that they are not in control of their lives. Many people derive pleasure from occupations which create large amounts of stress; these jobs do not create large amounts of health problems. According to Michael Mac- coby's bollk The Gamesman, the qualities most important to the average American in- dustrial corporation are the ability to take the initiative, pride in performance, and self- confidence. Friendliness, compassion, and idealism are ranked as the least important qualities. The important thing to consider is what our values are, and in what kind of setting we wish to spend forty years of our lives. Whether one wants to totally commit herself to a high- paying, high-pressure job is a matter of choice, and is something to think about. The most important point of the discussion was that one should go into a career which fits one's style and values in order to lead a satisfied and fulfilled life. Women Against Pornography By EMILY LOOSE Staff The delicate and volatile issue of pornegraphy was the center of a discussion and slide show held last Friday in Carnegie Hall sponsored by the Women's Network. The talk was presented by a representative from Women Against Por- nography, a national organization that is protesting this appalling practice as both a symptom and cause of the prevailing social climate which degrades women. This New York City based organization of 5,000 members asserts three specific purposes: to raise pornography as a feminist issue; to educate the general society about assorted dangers of pronography; and to bring pornography out of the realm of socially acceptable diversion. The speaker differentiated pornography from erotica which is the erotic stemming from sexual freedom. Por- nography was defined as stemming from an implied sexual power imbalance, that is a male demir:~ation of the female. Pornography, ac- cording to this defination, consists not of nudity or of sexual images or innuendoes alone, but of the depiction of nudity or such sexual images in a manner degrading to women. This degradation follows three basic lines. The first asserts that women are sexually masochistic. The second views women as the sum of their sexual parts. And the last suggests that women should be unconditionally sexually available. In reference to the danger of pornograph~ evidence was presented of the cumulative effect of such \anti· woman propaganda\ and the desensitization to such degradation resulting from what the organization considers the penetration of pornography into mainstream publications. This presentation consisted largely of subliminal ad- vertisements, suggesting rather than showing, sexual op- pression. Studies conducted over the past five to ten years by groups other than Women Against Pornography have shown a substantial rise in both the incidence of violence against women in pornographic publications and the incidence of actual violent crimes against women. The organization asserts from these studies a correspondence between pornography and the general societal attitude toward women. The group believes that this is where the danger of por- nography lies. A seven billion dollar-a-year business, more lucrative than the film and record industries combined, pornography, it seems, must be considered as more than mere diversion; perhaps it is both the satiation and catalyst of a need for sexual oppression.

Page 6 CONCORDIENSIS, April $1, 1983 FEATURES Students Intern In Albany r .. I Union Lampoone By FRANKLIN SCHNEIDER Staff Apart from the ordinary types of clasees, Union offers several courses of a different nature, ones in which the student is more directly involved. One such program is the Albany Internship Program. In this program, Uni·on students work in the offices of state legislators or lobbying groups. Working for several hours per week for two terms, the students become part of the office, able to observe the ''true legislative process\ in action. Before the internship begins, students are set up in Albany offices, usually ones in which other students have previously worked. Before .beginning work, the student talks to members of the office to get an initial feeling for whom he will be working. Once in the office, the nature of the futern's work varies, some answering telephones while others research information for a new piece .of legislation. Students spend an average of approximately twelve hours per week working in 'the office, although some students devote more time. Though the program may sound similar to the term abroad in Washington, there are. differences present. In par- ticular, though the student may work in an Albany office, he still is taking two other courses at Union. One must be willing to overcome the discomforts of commuting, especially during the winter term. Political Science Department Chairman James Underwood, one ,of the coordinators of the program, commented, \I view the program as quite valuable. It provides the student with an opportunity to be involved in the actual legislative process.\ \One also gets a better un- derstanding of people and of their interactions. We all know of the politicking of legislators, but there are equally important politics occuring within and between legislative offices. The student is a witness to this.\ The Dutch Pipers By J. L. KOSHEL Staff It should be music to our ears to hear that..the Dutch Pipers have been revived. This Union College singing group lormerly consisted of only Glee Club members when it first began in 1955. In time, however, the off- shoot of the Glee Club became independent, and began giving area concerts. In the early 1970's the group went defunct; later that same decade, a group modeled after the Dutch Pipers called the Eliphelets, after none other than Mr. Nott, began singing occasionally for alumni. Tim Smith, class of '84, began singing with the Eliphelets his freshm~n year - the year during which a constitution was written for the group and funding was obtained from the Student Forwn. Through the Director of Alumni Affairs, Harry Demgen and his . assistant, Edie Berkeowitz, the Dutch Pipers got five hundred dollars from the alumni council to help the group along. Smith is manager of the group, which has returned to the name of the Dutch Pipers, and has plans to see the group go places -but also to stay at one place in particular. That place is Union. Smith says, \I'.m only going to be here through next year and I just hope the Dutch Pipers will continue after I'm gone.\ As for going places, the Dutch Pipers have already performed for the New York City and Fulton-Montgomery County alumni clubs this year. Smith would like to see the . Dutch Pipers travel with ad- missions officers when they visit high schools. There are currently eleven singers in the Dutch Pipers; th~ir goal for next year is to have fifteen. According to Smith, other plans for the future include getting other singing groups to visit Union \to promote an understanding on campus as to what the Dutch Pipers aspire.\ Next year, the Dutch Pipers hope to sing at other schools as well as alumni clubs. As for the remainder of this year, the group will have what it considers its debut on Parents' Weekend. They hope to perform at reunion dinners during graduation weekend. . The Dutch Pipers' repertoire consists of a variety of styles including a barber shop song, \Light a Rose\; the classic fifties do-wop \Silouettes\; and the traditional, \Union College Medley\. If these are the kinds of song in your heart, the Dutch Pipers can be found rehearsing Tu~sdays, 9-11 p.m. and Thursdays, 6:30-8:30 p.m. in Memorial Chapel or in room 204 · in the Arts Building. Cornell Law School Undergraduate Prelaw Program June 6 to July 19, 1983 A demanding six-week program for college students who want to learn what law school is.Hke. For further information write to Jane G. Death, Cornell Law School, 634 Myron Taylor Hall, Box 20, Ithaca, NY 14853 Besides the formality of the office humdrum, the student . intern learns to deal with the members of his office under more relaxed conditions, such as at social functions. Valuable opportunities are present for the student to get to know the office personnel. The observation of Iegislative politics in action is not the only purpose of the program. Students also have op- portunities to observe the legi·slative process itself. \Often states Under.wood, ''offices become dependent upon the interns working there. Students sometimes cover meetings or help co-sponsor legislation which they have worked upon.'' This exposure to the legislative process sometimes changes the student's attitude. \Normally a student has read about the 'legislative process' and has many preconceptions as to how the government works,\ Underwood says. \Upon working at . their respective offices, these notions are subject to change. In some students it signifies the end of a student's interest in politics, while in oth-ers it i·s heightened.\ Besides the office work there are other requirements for the course. Classes are held .from one to four days a week, along with assigned reading. Two papers are required, relating to the student's work. In addition, one of the papers in initially presented as an oral report. The course itself is not limited to political science majors. Students of other disciplines are equally encouraged, with preference for the limited number of spots being deter- . mined by class. By LESLlERHUBIN Staff Union Lampoone humor magazine will publish its first issue ,during the week of April 26. The magazine, which has been in,planning sipce last year, will cost .50 cents and will be on sale in Carnegie, · ,Enthusiasm is running high throughout the staff according to Co-Editor Paul Ginsberg. He thinks that the Lampoone is of high quality, although perhaps a little controversial. Ginsberg said that any time a satil:'ical publication is printed people may become upset. On the whole he feels the campus will welcome it. Co·Editor Larry D~utsch suggested that there might be strong reaction from some people over the Lampoone's portrayal of certain groups. Deutsch said that if the Lam- poone had been a bland magazine no one would be in- terested in it. ''If a third of the people .are going to think it's funny, a third of the people may be offended,\ he said. Although no specific provisions have been made for feedback from readers, the editors believe- that letters to the magazine and to Con- cordiensis will show how the campus generally reacts to the humor magazine. Deutsch expects that most advertising will be done. through word of mouth. Pre-publication response has been enormous. The Lampoone was accepting copy from any . interested writers until February 25. The editors were hoping they would have eno.ugh copy to be selective. In fact, they received more than enough. The Lampoone now has a file of humor pieces that wm. be used in other issues. Basically, Bins berg believes; there were no real problems with putting the first issue together beyond being un· familiar with the technical aspects of production, These problems, he said, will disap- pear, now that they ·have sQme exp.erience. Ginsberg feels that Lampoone will become an institution. At one point he felt the Student Forum and the Finance Committee were letting the magazine go ahead on a probationary basis. Deutsch is still a bit wary and believes that receiving money for next fall's publication will be contingent on the campus' reaction to some of the controversial articles. Although Deutsch has doubts abou( funding for next year, he has no worries about the staff's ability to produce mote issues. Deutsch says that the talent and willingness are there to produce more and more lengthy issues. Deutsch says that at the moment the staff is ac~epting copy for a fall issue from any interested writers. Copy can be mailed to Deutsch's box, 0009, or Ginsberg's box, 1451. The editors expect that most of the staff will remain the same and any new recruiting will begin in the fall to attract fresh- men. As for the first issue, the 50- cent price has been set up to help defray publishing costs. It took $1.00 to publish each copy; - money received from readers will go back to the Student Forum. The content of the Lampoone is satirical. Ginsberg thinks it will be well received. \Everyone is going to like it. I encourage everyone to buy it.\ Pack Your Bags!

'The question I re.call was should the Federal government offer student loans to young men who vefuse to register for the draft. The question is by no means simple, but it does. have a simple an· swer, no. To the best of my knowledge there is no provision in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights which guarantees Federal loans for education; and therefore the loans .from the government are not a right that we are entitled to. Student loans are a privilege, the privilege of oir taining an education; and that privilege .is extended by Uncle Sam to those who cannot afford the high costs .of tuition. What makes the \pacifist's\ remarks so disturbing is that he is. more than willing to point an accusing finger at the US Government, calling it iinmoral for retaining a military; but the same pacifist si,ngs a different tune when that ''immoral\ govern- ment is willing to ~ubsidize - at great expense .... the pactifist's education. If ·the Conscientious Objector really feels that the government is bad, why would he want to ave anything to do with its money? Low interest loans for college education are important; and just like subsidized health care, social security, and food programs, it represents a real commitment on the part of our government to provide for the needs of its citizens, should they have trouble doing it thetn· selves. My feeling is that the Federal government is and has been there for those who have needed. help, and registering for the draft is just a part of our reciprocal agreement should our government need us to protect the very \life liberty, and pursuit of happiness\ that your writer spoke of. Uncle Sam has not and. will not turn his ' back on us; but I don't feel that the government owes an~hing at all to those individuals who break the law or espouse Civil Disobedience.

Carolyn Stein Manager Late Nite Bite Cafe ALack Of Class To the Editor: · Speaking from a few years . limited experience, I would like to call attention to a trend creeping its way into Union · College. tradition -lack of class. I was shocked to find out that parents were informed of our · seniors' rite of passage -- . Commencement ..- through a xerox copy of a letter not even on original letterhead. The document was a copy on a copy. To add insult to injury, a limited number of printed invitations wer.e \graciously\ offered to · my classmates at a cost. These are but two examples of Union College banking pennies at the expense of proper and; in my opmion, called for details. Perhaps I am being overly critical and picayune. But if the College wishes to be a class institution, she must begin at the bottom and work up. The adage ''penny-wise\ has been taken to beart by our administration and has set up permanent residence in that organ. Sincerely, Adam J. Brodsky Class.of 1983 Founded al Union College 1877 ------------ -------------- The Good· Die Young / They did it. Everyone's skepticisms about the success of an undergraduate review have been alleviated. The culmination of months and months of hard work was achieved last Wednesday as the first copy of the Union College Undergraduate Review of Humanities a'flll. Social Sciences was lifted from the box. • Dave; Win, Jeff and their faculty advisors must be commended first for recognizing Union's need for what they call a ''forum for undergraduate research,'' and, secondly for taking the initiative and effort to produce it. The Review will serve as an incentive to student research for years to come. Or will it? If we decide to consider this proje.ct finished, the concept will soon be forgotten as those of us who have the copies and know the editors depart from this school. The Review must be perpetuated as a Union institution. Consider, though, as you read your \free\ weekly campus newspaper, that publication costs money. In light of the overwhelming fruition of what is, hopefully, only the first edition, the Administration should see the light and ask tor the privilege of funding a project that ''makes Union loo){ good. \ This is not just another expensive student whim. Rather, it :i$ an undertaking that can help keep our school where it belongs in the academic community. Greek Weak The admissions office claims that students at Union are encourag~d to take the initiative and become involved in campus activities. Two students have decided to take this initiative and attempt to expand Greek life on campus. With 17 fraternities and only three sororities, they felt the need to help balance out this uneven number. Since the Administration is striving to achieve a 50-50 male to female ratio, it seems logical that the balance between fraternities and sororities should also even out eventually. Efforts to start a new sorority on campus have been discouraged by the Panhellenie Council. The 109 women who signed the petition represent approximately fifteen percent of the total female popula.tion. Obviously with such a large number dissatisfied with the Greek system, the need for a new sorority is there. The Panhellenic Council is placing the interests of the three houses over those of the women students who wish to belong to a sorority but do not .feel 1hey fit in among the limited choices available. These women are asking to have the Nationals come onto campus and explore the possibility of a new Greek organization, but have, been denied that opportunity. Even if it is not feasible, even if the Administration and the Nationals vote the idea· down, should not the Panhellenic Council be supporting the proposition rather than shooting it down? Appeasement? For m.onths now, both the Women's Network and the President's Commission on the Status of Women have been after the Administration to come up with a policy regarding the sexual harassment of students by faculty members. Finally, President Morris has formulated a policy of this sort. Obviously one. must recognize that a problem exists before a solution can be found. Yet one cannot help but wonder if the policy was drafted merely to satl.a te the demands of women on campus. Whatever the motivation behind this action, the protection of our students must be placed above the risk of offending esteemed faculty members. Sexual harassment is a violation of many sections of the Student Conduct Code, most notably: Any behavior that interferes with one's rig~t to conduct a?ademio pursuits in a peaceful 1 umnterrupted envtronment. Hopefully a situation will not arise in which this new policy will have to be tested. •

COMMENTARIES On U.S. Mid-East Policy By WAYNE GODLIN As a concerned observer of the Middle-East conflict, I am writing to express my opinion regarding President Re~;tgan's current policy of withholding F- 16 deliveries to the State of Israel. For me, this policy lacks consistent logic and ·seems extremely .short-sighted. MiTitarUy speaking, the Syrian state is 'being built up by the Soviet Union at an tm• precedented rate. This build-up includes not only thousands of Sov:iet military advisors and per.sonnel but the rn.ost sophisticated . surface to air missiles in the Soviet fleet. The President's failure to'respond to the current Soviet actions and his decision to sus~nd the sale of tbe F-16 fighter jets to Israel may be read in Moscow as a •signal that the Administration; for whatever ·reason, is prepared to tolerate this bold Soviet initiative. While it is obvious that Reagan's moye was an attempt to bring Hussein of Jord~n into the peace negotiations, the Administration's policy has ~pparentlyfailed on two counts. No. 1} The Administration's policy, rather than encouraging Hussein to join tb;e peace ~process, did exactly the op- posite. It convinced both Arafat and _ Hussein that the Administration was determined to force the Israelis into con- cessions, thereby. taking the pressure off of Hussein to do anything constructive. And, No. 2) it has:sent the wrong signal to Moscow by exemplifying the American reluctance to stand firmly behind her long-te~ ally. How can this policy be · effective in bringing about long· term peace? While it is possible that the ~otive of the Reagan Adnlinistration was to attempt to decelerate the arms race with the Soviets,. various other Administration actions would seem to contradict this logic. Recent Administratjon an- nouncements that the U.S. would sell the Israelis the sophisticated sidewinder missiles in addition to the ad- vanc~d American technology needed for the production of the Israeli Lavie fighter jets are hardly reassuring signs for Moscow. How then can one explain the Reagan Administration policy? ln tbe midst of the complexity of the Middle East, the Administration seems to have sent the wrong signals. Should this policy continue? It is obvious that the Israelis· want peace. So do the Americans, and especially the Lebanese. Monday's bo:ntbing of the American embassy·· in Beirut by an Islamic Fun- damentalist group {most likely protected and trained by the 'Syrian and Soviet personnel-in · the Bekka Valley) ·gives testimony to the fact that the . Soviet Union wants to subvert the peace efforts. of the West. If this is true, what can be said of the possibilities for the total withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon? Do the Syrians really intend to .. withdraw tpeir 40,000 troops? Sbould the Israelis withdraw if the Syrians do not? Certainly the Lebanese would not want this as an alternative, for even though they desire very much for the Israelis to withdraw, they appreciate what the Israelis have done in removing the PLO. infrastructure from Lebanese soil. lt is obvious that, in the eyes of the Lebanese, the Syrians -backed by the Soviets- are much more of a threat than the Israelis. If the prospects for with- drawal and peace are ever to get underway, the Reagan Administration must lift the ban on the sale of the.F-16s and give total support to the Isra 1 E!'lis. · This measure would perform three functions: (1) It would prove to the Soviets that the U.S. is willing to meet the Soviet challenge. If this is done, the cost to the already over- extended Soviets of remaining in LebanQn (via the Syrians) will increase tremendously. This might force the Syrians to re-evaluate their ·costs of remaining in Lebanon. (2) This action would reassure the Israelis of U.S. support thereby increasing her willingness to move towards making con- cessions in the withdrawal negotiations, and (3) If the Israelis make these conciliatory moves, she might be able to convice the Saudis to apply leverage on the Syrians to with- draw from Lebanon. Clearly, if the U.S. really wants to effectuate peace in the region, she must execute a foreign policy with insight and determination. The Soviets will . only respond to an effective American show of force. Policies of appeasement never work. (April 19, 1983) Applications for winter 1984 terms abroad are now being accepted.

Even while Ruckelshaus is awaiting Senate confirmation, briefing papers prepared for him by the EPA staff are first sent to Budget Director David Stockman's office for review.

EPA officials confirmed that the briefing papers routinely go to the.budget office before they are sent to the administrator - to make sure they are \accurate and complete,\ an agency spokesman said.

Our sources say the briefing papers contain candid suggestions that might indeed be politically embarrassing. For example, one document complained that Interior Secretary James Watt has been butting in on EPA's water policy. The EPA staff wants Ruckelshaus to keep Watt off their turf. Another document is even more disturbing. It calls for strengthening EPA's en- forcement division. Why should this question be reviewed at the White House? Ruckelshaus is expected to enforce the en- vironmental laws without any political interference. Indeed, that's what the EPA scandal has been all about.

By BOBBI COHEN You're out for an evening and having a good time, and sud- denly you discover that you've had a drink too many. You're having a little trouble walking and taking in what's going on around you, and you're not really in control. All of a sudden you find that sameone else has taken control of you. Maybe they walk you home saying they want to make sure yeu get home okay. Maybe a friend of a friend offers you a couch. Never thinking about how vulnerable you are, physically in- capacitated by drink, an offer like this seems totally ac- ceptable. After all, you don't want to spoil your friend's good time, and what can it hurt, a friendly gesture like this? Who would believe that here, among the aspiring doctors, engineers, and lawyers of Union College, are people who will take advantage of any situation, capable even of violence, who feel that in your trust is an in- WINTER TERMS ABROAD vitation '! How many times have I heard it said that ''girls like that\ ask for \it?\ Heaven help the girl who isn't careful, whe like her male cehorts drinks copiously, without imposing restraint. Because if yoU're not very careful about drinking, about accepting friendly, even seemingly harmless offers of help, you deserve whatever you get. No one would ever think of calling it rape. Just because you say no, and just because you're powerless to stop any violence committed te your person, that's no reason to caH it rape. Does anyone think, or care, what damaging acts of violence are being committed right here at Union? The situation is ignored, no protest is made even when incidents like these do become knewn. No offender is condemned. The girl feels guilty. Unclean is the word I've heard used most often. Powerless she may have been, vielated, but she will say nothing, point no finger, because she feels that she will be the condemned one. How many times have I heard this story? It doesn't just happen here, but this is where I live. I would like to change the situation, make it less common, and I want to start here. It is not worthwhile to live in fear. Being careful is one way to lessen the possibility of something like this happening to you, but no way to stop it from happening to someone else. Men who offend in this way are misguided by our acceptance of this situation. And so long as this is accepted by all of us, excuses made, instead of protest, this kind of rape will go on. .. COMMENTARIES On U.S. Mid-East Policy By WAYNE GODLIN As a concerned observer of the Middle-East conflict, I am writing to express my opinion regarding President Reagan's current policy of withholding F· 16 deliveries to the State of Israel. For me, this policy lacks consistent logic and seems extremely short-sighted. Militarily speaking, the Syrian state is being built up by the Soviet Union at an tm- precedented rate. This build-up includes not only thousands of Soviet military advisors and personnel but the most sophisticated surface to air missiles in the Soviet fleet. The President's faHure to respond to the current Soviet actions and his decision to suspend the sale of the F-16 fighter jets to Israel may be read in Moscow as a ~signal that the Administration, for whatever reason, i:s prepared to tolerate this bold Soviet initiative. While it is obvious that Reagan's move was an attempt to bring Hussein of Jordan into the peace negotiations, tbe Administration's policy has apparently failed on two counts. No. 1) The Administration's policy, rather than encouraging Hussein to join the peace process, did exactly the op- posite. It convinced both Arafat and Hussein that the Administration was determined to force the Israelis into con- cessions, thereby taking the pressure off of Hussein to do anything constructive. And, No. 2) it has sent the wrong signal to Moscow by exemplifying the American reluctance to stand firmly behind her long-tenn ally. How can this policy ae effective in aringing about long- tenn peace? While it is possible that the motive of the Reagan Administration was to attempt to decelerate the anns race with the Soviets, various other Administration actions would seem to contradict this logic. Recent Administration an- nouncements that the U.S. would sell the Israelis the sophisticated sidewinder F!lissiles in addition to the ad- vanced American technology needed for the production of the Israeli Lavie fighter jets are hardly reassuring signs for Moscow. How then can one explain the Reagan Administration policy? In the midst of the complexity of the IVIiddle East, the Administration seems to have sent the wrong signals. Should this policy continue? It is obvious that the Israelis want peace. So do the Americans, and especially the Lebanese. Monday's bombing of the American embassy in Beirut by an Islamic Fun- damentalist group (most likely protected and trained by the 'Syrian and Soviet personnel-in the Bekka Valley) gives testimony to the fact that the Soviet Union wants to subvert the peace efforts of the West. If this is true, what can be said of the possibilities for the total withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon? Do the Syrians really intend to withdraw their 4:0,000 troops? Should the Israelis withdraw if the Syrians do not? Certainly the Lebanese would not want this as an alternative, for even though they desire very much for the Israelis to withdraw, they appreciate what the Israelis have done in removing the PLO infrastructure from Lebanese soil. It is obvious that, in the eyes of the Lebanese, the Syrians -backed by the Soviets- are much more of a threat than the Israelis. If the prospects for with- drawal and peace are ever to get underway, the Reagan Administration must lift the ban on the sale of the F-16s and give total support to the Isra·elis. This measure would perform three functions: ( 1) It would prove to the Soviets that the U.S. is willing to meet the Soviet challenge. If this is done, the cost to the already over- extended Soviets of remaining in Lebanon (via the Syrians) will increase tremendously. This might force the Syrians to re-evaluate their costs of remaining in Lebanon. (2) This action would reassure the Israelis of U.S. support thereby increasing her willingness to move towards making con- cessions in the withdrawal negotiations, and (3) If the Israelis make these conciliatory moves, she might be able to convice the Saudis to apply leverage on the Syrians to with- draw from Lebanon. Clearly, if the U.S. really wants to effectuate peace in the region, she must execute a foreign policy with insight and determination. The Soviets will only respond to an effective American show of force. Policies of appeasement never work. (April 19, 1983) Applications for winter 1984 terms abroad are now being accepted. The deadline for ap- plications is only two 1 weeks away, on May 2. Winter terms to be offered will be a term in Athens, Greece, Sevi lie, Spain, and a kibbutz in Israel. Each program requires a prerequisite course. For Greece the' prerequisite is Classics 21i for Spain, the prerequisite is Spanish 10 for the first track and Spanish 133 for the upper track. The term in Israel requires Hebrew 10 as the prerequisite. The cost for all programs abroad next year is similar to the cost of tuition, room and board here on campus. Additional expenses are airfare to and from your destination and per- sonal and recreational expenditures. For more information and ap· plication blanks, come to the Terms Abroad office in HU 211.

Page 10 OONCORDIENSIS, April 21, 1983 THE ARTS Concert Review- Success In The Nott By MARY PHILLIPS wl.thANDY ROSEN As a photographer I never expected that I would have to write an article for the paper, but that day finally came. Last Tuesday night, April 12, the concert committee sponsored a free concert in the Nott Memorial. Union was fortunate enough to host Buzzy Linhart and Aztec Two-step. It was just going to be another photo assignment--get there late, leave early, but I was to be :pleasantly surprised. It was 8:00 and Buzzy hadn't arrived yet. I met the members of Aztec Two-Step, Rex Fowler and Neil Shulman., in the banquet room where they were eating dinner to ask about taking their picture. They were extremely friendly and we talked about things like home (the New York area). It grew us Festival This year's Us Festival will be held on Memorial Day weekend at Southern Califor- nia's GlenJielen Regional Park. Tickets are $20.00 a day · and the line up is well worth it. At a budget of $15 million the - schedule is• Saturday: the Clash, the .Stray Cats, Men at Work, the English Beat, A Flock of Seagulls, Oingo Boingo, Wall of Voodoo, the !vinyls, INXS, . and . Little Steven and the Disciples of SouL Sunday will feature hard rock: Van Halen, the Scorpions, Triumph, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, Motley Crue and another odd choice, Joe Walsh. Monday is more varied: Bowie, Stevie Nicks, John Cougar, the Pretenders, U-2, Quarturflash. . close to showtime· and it was time to leave. I went over to the Nott late. Buzzy was already on stage. I looked around and was disappointed at the spa·rse cmwd, but those that were there were enjoying themselves thoroughly. My first impression of Buzzy Linhart was that he was, well ... unique. His music consisted of sound effects and audience participation I'd never heard of in music before (he had the best fake sneeze). He sang songs from his five albwns, including ''It Hurts So Good It Must Be Love\ off his latest double album, The Four Sides of Buzzy Linhart. As I looked around I could see that people were singing along and enjoying themselves. He finished his show with a song he wrote for Bette Midler (one of his countless credits) called ''Friends.\ He then went into the audience to cheer on Rex: and Neil. Next, Aztec Two-Step came on stage.. Their music could be classified as up-beat folk, very similar .to the sounds of Crosby and Stills, and to the Spirit of Woodstock. They sang old favorites from their previous three albums, many of which I recognized, and from their latest, The Times :of Our Lives. For someone who knew nothing about either performer I can say that it was an e'!:cellent concert, one that more people should have taken advantage of. Special thanks to the concert committee.

Busch, his brother Herman, .E Rudolf Serkin, Mareel Moyse _g and Louis and Blanche Moyse to c. set up a summer music program. They . could have set up another series of -concerts but instead they felt that per- forming musicians with ·the pressures of professional concert careers needed more time to study and play chamber music. Marlboro's participants are in residence at Marlboro for two months to study in depth and play the repertoire combining piano, strings, woodwinds, brass and voice. Since its informal beginnings, well over 1,000 musicians have been in residence at Marlboro, many now holding key positions in our major orchestras and at our leading conservatories, colleges and universities. In order to share Marlboro music-making with people throughout the U.S. and to extend Marlboro activities into the regular concert season, \Music from Marlboro\ was created in 1965. Approximately 25 musicians are selected each season to form the five annual \Music from Marlboro\ tours which involve generally 10 cQncerts in a two week period, with ensembles ranging in size .from three to eleven members. For many of the more than 175 artists whO have participated on a \Music from Marlboro\ tour, this. has represented their first touring experience and the . opportunity to perform in such cities as New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. It . has given these out- standing young musicians firsthand knowledge of the disdpHne demanded of a performing professional, as well as the chance to put into practice what they have gained from- a summer in Vermont. The final concert in the \Music from Marlboro\ series sponsored by the Schenectady -Museum and Union College will be held Tuesday, April 26. Featured will be works by Mozart, Hindemith and Beethoven. The concert. will begin at 8 p.m. in Memorial Chapel with Beethoven's .Sextet for two horns .and strings, Opus 8lb-an ~arly work scored for an unusual combination of in- struments. Also to be per- formed is Paul Hindemith's String Trio No. 1, Opus 34, first performed in Salzburg in 1924. Concluding the program will be Mozart's Divertimento No. 11 in D Major, K.251, which was conceived ·as a birthd~y sur- prise for his sister. It dates from 1776 and is scored for seven 1nstruments: four strings, oboe, and two horns. Tickets are free to the Union community and can be picked up at Carnegie Hall. . .

The perfor~ance took place in Memorlal Chapel, and represented the culmination of a great joint effort. Some public funds had been made available by NYSCA, as well as spon- sorship by the Union Arts Department and Amherst College. The performance was actually the. first .of three. On Saturday April 23 the produc- tion will perform at Amherst, and on Sunday April 24 it will premiere at Harvard .. The production, based on the Greek Classic by SophoCles, featur~s the Union College Gl~e Club under the direction of Hugh Allen Wilson, the Amherst College Glee Club under the direction of Bruce Mcinnes, and the Schenecta(\y Symphony FAST FREE DELIVERY Orchestra, as well as a cast o~ nine actors. The production follows a format ·of a musical presentation with dialogue dispers·ed between the characters. ' The overall production was impressive. The ferWard pews of the ·Chapel had been removed to allow for the or.chestra, and Charles Steckler and Daro Beninati created a unique set and lighting design. The actors, under Union's Barry Smith, gave convincing performances. Tom Rice, playing the sentry, was the only Union student and provided the comic relief. George Siletsky, who has a~ppeared at Union before as Macbeth in the Union APts production last winter, was by far the most outstanding. He was emotional, without .being over dramatic, and :seemed unaffected by the limitations of the format.

These compliments do not suggest that there were no problems with the Union I!U~r­ forma.nce; but it is this reviewer's opinion that most of the difficulties arose out of Union's lack of a proper facility. Union has outstanding athletic £acUities, an up-to-date science center, and. yet there is no proper auditorium for presentations of any type. The Chapel was designed for ~eligious services., and though a grand.effort was made to adapt it to this special use, the effort just wasn't enough. Lighting for the production was a problem because it was possible to do none. The house lights were left at full the entire performance. The lyrics of the choral pieces were totally lost because space necessitated that the Glee Clubs be placed opposite each other on fhe balconi~s, thus theY tended to face the stage in order to see the conductor. The (!lee Clubs, not wanting to stand throughout the entire two hour per- formance..,.would rise and sit at the start and finish of each chorale interlude, creating a total. break in mood with the thunderous sound of their movement. As a final com- plaint, one is always more receptive when one is com- fortable; needless to say, two hours in the Chapel is not comfortable. It is a shame that an effort made so gallantly on the part of so many, to be original and create something unique ·for the benefit of this campus, should be impeded, not for lack of interest, nor certainly for lack of talent, nor even for lack of financial support, but simply for lack of a proper forum to spowcase that effort.

Amnesty Exhibit By PEBJUE ALBERT andSTEFFI PROPOS Presently, in the Arts Building, there is an eXhibit of original prints, lithographs and posters done by famous artists for the benefit of Amnesty International (AI). AI is a private, non-governmental human rights organization. The group was founded in tondon in 1961 where its headquarters still remain. It was established in the United States in 1965, headquartered in New York. There are national sections in 40 countries around the world. Included among these nations are all the Western European countries, most English speaking nations, and others including Japan, Greece, and Barbados. AI devotes itself to freeing prisoners of conscience. A prisoner of conscience is one who is .imprisoned, in trial or awaiting trial for a non-violent act of conscience. The process for freeing these prison'ers begins by assigning three cases to a group at one time. These groups are assigned the task of creating bad publicity for the government which has im~ prisoned the victim. Before a ' group can take action, they must research the case and make sure ,that it remains in accordance with the AI charter. Violence is not involved. Also, a group cannot take on a case involving someone within their own country, due to the necessityfor impartiality. The premise involved is that most countries need the good Will and support of other countries. Therefore, bad publicity would only force the government into deciding which is more im- portant: holding the prisoners or their foreign aid benefits. Professor Sharlet of the Political Science Department is an active member of the Capital District Division of AI. He is a specialist involved with the coordination of cases dealing with prisoners in Eastern European countries. Artists such as Valder, Miro and Lieberman donated their work. to AI for the promotion of Amnesty as well as to raise money for the relief of political prisoners. Union was able to obtain the exhibit with the help of Professor Sharlet. The exhibition of the three stages of work from original print to poster teaches the careful observer how to notice the subtle differences within an artist's work. The exhibit will be on display until the end of April. Posters are available for sale in the Art Department office and Posters Plus on Jay Street. The cost of these posters ranges from $20 to $50 for an unsigned poster and up to $200 for a signed limited edition. Most of the money from the sales goes to Amnesty Inter- national. There is a group on campus called the Amnesty Inter- national Network: Anyone in- , terested in getting involved should contact Lisa Ryan or Judybeth Greene. It is highly recommended that everyone stop in at the Art Department Gallery and ·view the exhibit.

Page 14 OONOORDIENSIS~ April 21~ 1983 Lax Bows to Larries By NED RACINE Sports Staff Despite a fine defensive effort by the Dutchmen's lacrosse team, the highly ranked St. Lawrence squad aotlasted Union, 5-3. Union played good disciplined lacrosse for a full sixty minutes, but, although . they controlled the ball longer than St. Lawrence, they had trouble putting the ball in the goal. Union started the game strongly, and did hold a 2-0 lead in the first period, largely due to the outstanding play of goalie Steve Koscs, who kept Union close all game. The strong St. Lawrence attackmen could not be denied, and came back to overtake Union for good 3-2. Both defenses dominated the rest of the game. St. Lawrence's defense was able to intimidate the young and ineXperienced Dutchmen attackmen, while the trio of Steve Sullivan, Marty Sands, and Ben Maynard hung tough against the potent Larry Keep your Engines running! offense. Most notable was the containment of St. Lawrence's Steve Lawler, arguably the best division three attackman in the country. Lawler, who is averaging six points a game, was held to two points, as Maynard blanketed him all day. Coach Fran Meagher was happy with his team's per- formance, but realizes his of- fense has to start clicking. \We had a great defensive effort today. Listen, we'reallowing 7.6 goals a game against us, which is just fabulous for any team. Granted, we're not scoring as much as we should, but if we play like this for the rest of the season,wehave a good shot at a winning season, and with a lot of luck, the play-offs aren't out of reach.\ Considering their 17•2 shellacking of Union last year, St. Lawrence probably drove back to Canton with a new image of Union's lacrosse program, and maybe ideas along the same lines as Meagher's. Chi P·si's Rally Postponed until Tues., April 26th :.'····- .. ,i Ruggers Take· Third 'In Mud UyRB Sports Staff In conditions meant to reduce the game of rugby to a· masochistic mudfight, Union 'A' team played three games at the Siena College Tournament~ while the 'B' team played Plattsburgh at Albany. For the 'A'', the hardest game was the first; against the host team Siena. Union started slowly and were lucky to end the first half without being scored upon. After the break, however, the Dutchmen. began to gain the upper hand but failed to convert under pressure. The Union forwards began to dominate the game as Doug Baumgarten and Walt Fredricks came· close to scoring, but committed penalties allowing Siena to counter the attack. After an extra period, the score remained 0-0. The game was decided on 'goal kicks' wihch UniQn unfortunately lost. As a consolation, the ruggers won the remaining two games comfortably by scores of 16-0 and 8-0, taking the third place trophy and not conceding a point throughout the tour• nament. Try scorers were Russ Backhouse, Walt Fredricks, · and Brad Nicholson. In the last two games, tne conditions improved considerably allowing the team to play more proficiently. Playing in very similiar conditions at Albany, the· 'B' team got off to . a good. start. Tries by Dave Beal and Jack Snapkowski gave Union a quick 10-0 lead. PlattsbWlgb pulled back a try before half time and looked better and better going on to score twice more in the second half despite good defense by fullback John Foster. The ~A' team record so far stands at 3-1-1 and the 'B' team is 1-1-1. _ ~ 411 Wfll, l.l%1f,W- •W'if\\~ ''.M[J!liiL/ ::w\'~ ,-· '.> . ~~~- .. •. -:~:.· .> ,,;'(:''<·>'· ,<,., ... ~.-··<··. ·,.~~:. ,,,·~ Fr.

Staff The Dutchmen baseball team has gotten off to a rocky start this season, dropping three games .last ~eek, bringing· its record to a diSmal 0-4. All four of the losses have been by a single run, with three of the defeats occurring in the final inning. The winless record can be attributed to some hard lUck, but also to a lack ·of tenacity in key situations. Union began toe week facing a solid Williams ~quad on th(:l outburst featuring a prodigious two-run homerun by Joe Wood, and capped off .by a sacrifice fly by John Merretti. Carrying a 6-3 lead inte the bottom of th,e tenth, the Dutchmen seemed assured of victory, but Williams battled back, and. with the aid of two walks, an error, and a hit batsman, came up with four runs and the victory. Wood finished with three hits and three RBI's for the Dutchmen while Blackburn and Moretti . adcJ.ed two hits apiece. ThursdaY's home•opener was much the same story for the about as .pretty as the score indicates. Both teams took advantage of shoddy fielding, wa:lks, and timely hitting to amass their run totals. Union looked as if they were conceding this one early as R.P.I. built a 13·5 lead through six innings. The Dutchmen came alive in the seventh and made a run at the Engineers:, however, as they sent eleven men to the plate ana scored seven runs to close the margin to 13-12. The key hits -were RBI singles from Moretti and Reinhardt Walker and a two-nm double from Pete union pitcher Ted cannon gets the called lf;trlke. Cannon pitchedwell_again$t Hartwi7k as he went 8 1- 3 innings and gave up ten hits. He did not get the win though as Hartw•ck defeated Unron 6-5. . . road. The game was a pitchers' duel entering the eighth inning, with Williams on top 2•1. Nat Barris had allowed only four bits through the .first seven innings; while tbe Dutchmen bad collected five, their only run coming on an RBI single by Ed Moriarty. Union took the lead in the eighth as Joe Wood doubled home Tom Blackburn who had singled, and Andy Dreher lofted a sacrifice fly scoring George Oberstadt with the go-ahead rllll. This lead was short-lived . however, as Williams tied the game in tbe Garnet as H~twick came up with two .runs in the ninth to again snatch Victory away from the Dutchmen. John Mor~tti's two-out RBI double in . the seventh bad given tbe Dut- chmen, who managed just .five hits on the day, a 54 lead ~hich they held until the mnth. Hartwick came up with three hits and two runs in the final stanza to.send Union down to its third setback. The Dutchmen received a fine pitching per- formance from Ted Cannon as he went 8 1-3 innings, scattering ten hits and pitching out of -Cohan. Union .was aided by three R.P.I. errors in the in- ning. The rally fell one rmi short and the Dutchmen could not come up with any runs in the . final two innings. Although Union fell to its fourth defeat, the bats did seem to come around. Freshman Reinhardt Walker, in his first varsity game, collected three singles in three at bats, while Oberstadt,. Dreher, Moretti .and Clinton all had two hits. Coaches Audino and Teevens are encouraged by the fact that the Dutchmen have been in a position to win each ball game and feel that the team has the ability to turn things around. UniGn will be looking for that elusive first victory in games with ,North Adams on Wed- nesday and Norwich on Saturday, both at home. These games stand to be rescheduled with the recent snowfall, however. Suppo-rt Union Sports SPORTS Sports Talk With SCOTT WYKOFF Sports Staff \Notes off the cuff\ Spring is a busy time for sports at Union. With the constant juggling of schedules due to inclement weather and the low profile that sports in the spring are associated with, here are a few assorted notes dealing with the Dutchmen goings-on of this spring. Meeting of Minds-A small scale basketbaU coaches' convention was staged at Central Park during a recent Dutchmen baseball game. Union hoop mentors Scanlon and Montana were in at- tendance as were Worcester Academy head coach Tom Blackburn and ex-University of Connecticut head coach Donald '~oee •·• Rowe. Scanlon and Montana enjoyed talking basketball with their two associates who were in town to see their sons suit up for the Dutchmen. Tom Jr. plays right field for the Garnet and Grey .. while Don Jr. is a Dutchmen relief ace. USFL bl S«!henectady--Word bas it that a nwnber of regional scounts. from the United States Football League hav.e shown some recent ·interest in Dut- chmen senior Steve Bodmer. Bodmer had a banner season on defense for Union's 8-1 football squad and has tD .be excited about the opportunity knocking at his doQr because of the in- ception of this new pro league. Steve received many post season honors including .being named to the Kodak All- American team. Musical Chafrs.,.John Lovett, a four-year member of the Union .football coaching staff, departed Schenectady last week for nowhere else but Brown University. \Levi\ is the third Dutchmen football coach in the last year to le<tve Union for the Ivy League school in Rhode Island. Ex-head coach Joe Wirth departed Union for associate head coaching responsibilities at Brown a year ago this spring while offensive whiz Mark Whipple jofued on with Wirth at Brown after the completion of this last fall's campaign. Lovett, for the first time in his career, Will be able to act strictly as a full time pigskin coach in his duties at Brown. While at Union he split his time between football, wrestling and baseball. Hoop Scoops.--With the graduation of senior guard Joe· Clinton, a great deal of pressure will rest on the shoulders of his returning backcourt mate, junior Joe Wood. Coaches Scanlon and Montana hope that transfer guard Pete Torinsello will be able to take much of the pressure off of Wood. Torinsello transferred to Union from the University of Rhode Island this year and was forced to sit out the 1982-83 campaign because of NCAA rules dealing with transfers. Pete's a local product and a pure outside shooter that can throw 'em in from anywhere. --Sophomore center Ken D'Orazio has yet to near from Columbia University on the status of. his transfer ap- plication. Ken has always wished to play at Columbia and would enjoy being closer to honie. Good luck to Ken in his bid to transfer to Ivies! --The fine Dutchmen basketball backcourt tandem of Joe Clinton and Joe Wood have successfully made the spring transition to the baseball diamond for first year coach Audin'sDutchmensquad. Wood is a fine pro .prospect and hopel:1 to sign a pro baseball contract at the completion of this spring season. Woody was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals out of high school and at press time is hitting at a .500 clip while playing shortstop for the Dutch- men. Clinton holds down the chores as Union's first baseman and is one of the best spray hitters on the team. Lax Observations--This reporter is disappointed at the dismalfan turnout at Alexander Field for Dutchmen · lacrosse games. Lacrosse is an exciting spectator sport that combines many of the skills and talents used in hockey, football, and soccer. Soph Mark Eudin has been playing incredibly on the offensive end for Coach Meagher's squad while junior Ben Maynard controls the defensive zone for the Garnet laxmen. --Congratulations to the Dutchwomen lax squad who won their first game of the season last Monday. Both Holly Howard and Emily Monosson are closing out fine athletic careers this season and deserve a big round of applause for their field hockey, lacrosse and Block U service while at Union. Sen!or first baseman Joe Clinton slides into second safely in action agamst l-lartwick. Athlete of the Week bottom of the inning. Neither team could score in the ninth so the game went into extra in- nbngs. · It looked as if the Dutchmen had put the game. away in the top of the tenth with a three-rllil several jams.

STRUMMER Sports Staff For the second time this year the Athlete of the Week goes to co-captain Russ Backhouse of the rugby team. In inClement weather last Saturday, Backhouse was instrumental in securing Union's. third place finish in the prestigious Siena Tournament. · Union's high scoring fly-half · scored three tries converting on two in the second and most important game of the af- ternoon. This proved to be all of the scoring in the game as Union ran to a 16-0 victory over the powerful Albany Law School team. Backhouse has proved to be one of the most versatile players in the Union Rugby Club and has put all his efforts into bringing the club's quality of play to the level he has been accustomed to at St. Andrews, in Scotland. Hard .hitting and smart play have constantly been a major aspect of Backhouse's rugby philosophy. Co-Captain Keith Dean commented that \Backhouse's fine positional play, sharp' passing, and precision kicking m such adverse conditions appeared to break the backs of the opposition as well as to inspire the team to victory.\ Congratulations to TRuss, apd best of luck to the rugby club for the remainder ·Of tlieir season.

Page 16 OONCORDIENSIS, ApriZ 21, 1983 SPORTS \The Magic is Back•' Union Seven, Opponents Love ByDAK Sports Staff The seemingly unbeatable tennis team continued to crush its opponents this week winning three matches over Skidmore,6- 3, Siena 8-1, and Hobart 9.;(}. The talk about the courts has been \the magic is back.\ Some owe this new success to the well seasoned veterans Steve Eskanazi, and Dave Pataleta, while others are suggesting the success is resulting from the new catalyst, freshman Bruce Hammer Goldsmith. With these three victories the team's record stands at 7.;(}. Union encountered dif- ficulties in the Skidmore match but ultimately persevered and won 6~. David Space. Patalito, Rick Molot and Bruce Gold- smith each had relatively simple two set victories. The outstanding play of the day came from Steve Eskanazi. Steve had a fierce three set set 7-4> having been down 4-1 in the third set tiebreaker. Ehen asked to comment Coach Al BagnoH said in a tight situation, ''Eskanazi's as tough as steel.\ The dosble team of Molot and Moore won a well played two set doubles match. While Bruce Goldsmith and I>avfd Katz pulled out a lhitd set victory in a close tiebreaker .. The crack squad then traveled three and one-:half hours to smash Hobart netmen !J-Q. Hobart has beaten Union in the past three seasons, thus this victory tasted even sweeter. Fine singles play was rendered by Dwight Moore, David Patalita, Steve Eskenazi, Bruce Goldsmith, and David Katz who all won two set victories. Rick Molot began to show his form which was present in his '82 season, and won a powerful three set match 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. Ag~in the well trained doubles teams of Moore and Molot, Eskenazi and Collin Green, and Palatita and Goldsmith aU ... looking for first win trampled their opponents in some fine doubles play. The Dutchmen then traveled to Siena College and prevailed over their oppon~nt 8-1. Singles players Dwight Moore, Dave Patalita, Steve ·Eskenazi, Bruce Goldsmith, and David Katz each gave up less than three games per match. The doubles squads of RICK Molot and Dwight Moore, Steve Eskenazi and Collin Green, and David Patalita and keshman · Bruce Goldsmith again swatted their opponents and aU the teams won two set matches fairly handily. Thus Union enters the second half .of the season with an un- defeated record, and . hopes of achieving their first undekated season. Players are sharp, spirits are high, and coach Al Bagnoli is optimistic. In future weeks the team's more im- portant matches are Hamilton, Albany State, and Coigate. Good luck Union squad, and remember \:the magic is back.\ .; I Senior Steve Eskanazi fought back from a 4·1 def;cit in the thitd set tie-breaker to win the set and match against !'lis Skidmore op ponent.

The team hosted Siena on Tuesday, April12, and although the Dutchmen lost 9-3 (one must keep in mind that) Siena just moved down a division this year, from Division two to Division three. In ad- dition to the poor weather there were many other vactors that contributed to the Dutchmen's loss, including some crucial errors and poor hitting. There were, however,. quite a few highlights: third baseman JoAnn Dolan got a single, scored and later laid down a beautiful sacrifice bunt; shortstop Peg Petro blasted a ·:~ , d: ' ' . triple and scored on a fantastic suicide squeeze (with two outs) by Barb Bailey. The. big hitter of the day was Kelly Liese, who went2 for 3, getting a single and driving a triple deep inte left field. Pitcher Dina Pliotis contributed an RBI with a shot to right field. On Thursday, April 14, tbe Union women lost 10·1 to last year's state champions, Albany State. Union faced a very fast and very accurate pitcher who kept the Dutchmen from rallying successfully. Even though Union cut down on their errors considerably, Albany managed to control the game from the start. Hitting well for Union were catcher Carolyn Bigda, and left fielder Kelly Liese, who both got singles, while shortstop Peg Petro· Dutchmen trackster George Cappozzi sprinted to .a second place finish in the TOO meter dash (11 :5 sec.) in a quadrangular meet involving Union, Hamilton, Norwich and Marist College.

Federal Communications Conunission (FCC) allowing the station to increase its power to 100 watts. What this means i..'l effect, is that the station will, by Sep- tember, have a coverage that will reach, according to Geoff Tyre, technical manag~r on the WRUC Executive Board, as far as downtown Albariy. The permit to increase wattage has been sought after by the radio station for the past five years. They first applied for the permit, according to Jeff Dinces, the WRUC program . manager, in 1978. The process has taken a long time, he ex- plained, because of several problems. Two years after the permit was applied' for, possible in- terference probl¢ms Were discovered with a Kingston radio- station. In Aprll of 1982, t!Jis problem with Kingston was fmally worked out, Dinces went o~, and a lawyer for WRUC was hired at that.t:inie bythe general manager .. Other problems developed however, hindering the station from achieving its goal. When . interference, problems with Kingston were· finally worked otit, Channel6 in Albany filed a protest with the FCC claiming that increased wattage for WRUC would result in in- terference with the television station. . Dinces clai.J:ns that Channel 6 filed their protest in September of 1982. As soon as the executive boar~, the fact about the protest and the possible interference problems, they notified the Dean of Students .. The Dean of Students and President Morris then went to General Electric to ask the corporation to persuade Channel6 to droptheir protest. Rich Beigen, the present general manager of WRUp added that another possible factor wWch convinced the FCC to finally issue the permit was a report written by a team of Union engineers which \proved without a doubt that inu terference would not be created with Channel 6.\ Although the significance of such a .report is debated among members of the executive board, found out remains that 'the protest was dropped in early December of this past year. Even then they claim, it was a ''tremendously long bureaucratic processn for the station waited four months, from early December when the protest was dropped, until early April, when tbey were notified Room Lottery, p. 3 that the permit had been issued. .Now that the petmit has been received, plans are underway to construct a new antenna. The 100 watts represents the amollllt -of v~,>ltage and current which will be supplied to this antenna. According to FCC regulations, construction must begin by June 12. This deadline is misleading, however, Dinces claims, because by construction the FCC means that the equipment needed w~ll have been ordered at that time.; definlte plans set down on paper, and engineers brought in. Tbe station is not worried, be continues, about the deadlines because ·· an engineer has already been consulted and has visited the station; plans have begun. The official building construction is tentatively planned for September. Beigen stated that the station will be broadcasting With a 100 watt power range by the end of fresh- man orientation. Four engineers have been consulted at present, and bids have already been received The people hired for. the actual construction, he commented, will have no connection with the College. \We are looking for the highest quality at the lowest cost,\ Dinces remarked. The FCC also requires the station to have a test period and is now scheduled for September 6-20. At that time; Tyre ex- plained, if anyone on campus dis<!o'Vers interference on their television sets with Channel 6, they are invited to pick up a pamphlet at WRUC which will explain how and why such in- terference exists. No fundamental program- ming changes have been planned as yet for the increased coverage range accordirjg to Dinces. The station · will, however, put more pressure on the staff to become more organized and to \do things properly.\ The executive board intends that by the third week of fall term the station will be broadcasting 24 hours. The only problem they seem to face, he pointed out, is that ap- proximately 60 percent of the station's disc jockeys ate now seniors. The change in wattage wlll cost the school an estimated total of $20,000. In addition to the construction of the antenna, the station is in need of a new broadcast mixing board. \The engineer says there is no hope for it,\ Tyre remarked. Quotjng Bob Hellenback, the student engineer referred to he said, \It should have been retired two years ago.\ According to Beigen, the . board is asking for some funds from the Student Forwn but added that the station is donating $5,000 from its own Continued on page « > u tO ....1 <II \i: J: u > _Q -E J: a.

/ . . ' . OONOORDllilNSIS, April $8, 198~ Sight? New By-laws • In \ \ Stu'~:lent Forurn president Ilene Landress Delay on .Draft- Aid Law Granted By LISA FOLEY Staff national basis, a higher per- centage of minorities apply for financial aid; thus the amend- ment discriminates against them alsQ. Frishberg adds that male students are not the only recipients of financial aid. She, like many others who oppose the law, wonders why the law singles out male students, excluding people receiving other entitlement benefits such as food stamps and unem- ployment insurance. By GA: YI.E ROSENFELD Staff Within the next two weeks, the Student Forum should finally have the. updated bylaws it has lacked since 1980, In that year, on May 1, a new student constitution was created. However, this constitution uses the bylaws of its antecedent which are not always relevant when dealing with present issues. With new bylaws, a more systematic format of procedure can be followed by the Student Forum,. once again. The bylaws themselves are what\ president of the Student Forum Ilene Landress cans· \procedural guidelines\ or, rather, ''how the Forum should operate.'' Tehy basically assure a workable constitution un- derstandable to the Forum and the student body. However, with various conduct ,controversies occurring on campus last year with several extra-curricular ,groups, the Forum has been criticized for not having formal and accurate bylaws. Thus, the Forum was held accountable for its lack of action on the matter. With this in mind, upon Landress' ascendance to her post, ·she · promised to in- corporate new bylaws into. the constitution by the ninth week of winter term. Obviously, this did not ensue; however, a rational explanation was given by Landress. She was waiting for the conduct codes to be restated, which has 'occurred, in the hope that they would not be a part of the bylaws themselves, thus keeping the Fortllll an administrative and not a judicial body on campus. At this time the bylaws have been drawn up by Landress and sophomore representative Steve B'ensan. These two Forum members will next meet with Professor Byron Nichols of the Political Science Department, chairman of the committee that created the new governance .system of the college in 1980~ After this, the Student Forum shall ·confer and, with a two.. third vote of . this .group, these bylaws will be officially proposed. as an amendment to the 1980 cofi.stitution. This spring 25 percent of the student bo(,ly must vote, with at le~st two-third of them in approval, to ratify this amendment on a ballot that will arise during the elections for the Forum for the 1983:.84 academic year. These probable v!)ting procedures are taken from Article XI of the student constitution. According to Landress, \We're correcting the con- stitution, '' but, \we're not making anY vast changes.'' The new bylaws are relatively ~imilar to .fheir predecessors but with one major difference. Currently, (our students are appointed to the Academic . Affairs Council,. including one voting member of the Student Forum. Landress and Benson have proposed that this fourth member be selected by the student body, thus allowing for a more democratic procedure. What remains interesting in all of this is how the Forum bas operated duripg the last three years without concrete bylaws. Landress pointed out that last year's Forum was rather haphazard in .its utilization of the constitution; however, ''this year, we'Ve been pretty con. sistent.'' Landress continued to say that with the new bylaws the Forum is merely \writing down what we've been doing\ all along. Each succeeding Forum tended to followthe 'lead of the previous Forum. \You just try to kind of pick up what happened last, year,\ com- mented Landress. Custom is the key element here and. with the actual writing of the new bylaws, this tradition will pass from mere observance to a documented record. Minnesota's Civil Liverties Union gained a Federal Court injunction, delaying the amendment to Title IV of the Higher Education Act, until its constitutional validity can be determined. The amendment, which was to go into effect July 1, would have mandated students to inform colleges about their compliance with Selective Service registration in order to receive Federal fmancial aid. Because .of the injunction, students need not provide such information in the Statement of Educational Purpose-Regist- ration Compliance, in the 1983- 84 Student Aid Report, or any other form which asks about a student's registration status. The proponents of the law have already lessened their demands from requiring proof. from the students as to their status, to requiring their signatures to verify the status. Frishberg says that Union will comply with the court's decision. However, she added, ''If a student had a good reason for.objection to the law, Union would review these cases· on an Fewer Grads Recruited The opposition, led by Min- nesota's Civil Liberties Union and strongly supported by students and members of the financial aid personnel com- munity, points out the discrimination of the defeated proposal. According to Assistant Director of Financial Aid Ellen Frishberg, the law: singles out only those students who need financial aid, thus discriminating on the basis of wealth. Furthermore. on a individual basis.\ The Department of Education states that, \Depending on the outcome of the court case, students may be required to provide information concerning their Selective Service registration · status at a later date. Should such a requirement ta:ke effect,\ the Department continues, ''their receipt ·Of Federal financial aid could be delayed if they have not provided the information.\ (CPS)-Despite some en- ·couraging signs that the nation's economy may be starting to pull out of the worst American recession since World War II, the .recovery has yet to show up on campus, and probably won't in time to help this spring's graduates find jobs right away, college placement officers say. In fact, campus recruiting and the nwnber of job offers to graduating seniors are down again this spring, while experts say starting salaries are lagging behind even the declining inflation rate. Even engineers and computer science majors, who generally have had their pick of jobs in Apartheid Reexamined ByLYNNHANO Staff Professor Mark Dawson of the history department is putting together a series of three speakers represenUng both sides of the. black and white controversy in South ·Africa. Dawson, who teaches a course on the post-WWII history of South Africa, feels that students should be aware of the racial problems .in South Africa. He points out that in the next ten to fifteen years South Africa Will be a major crisis point in world affairs. The speakers include Domisani S. Kumalo, a black South African jqurnalist, Hanning Pieterse, Executive County General of the South African government., and if the arrangements can be made, a . representative of the African ' National Congress. Kumalo, the first speaker, spoke on April 27 on \Divest- ment and the Role of U.S. Corporations in South Africa.\ Kumalo was a journalist in South Africa since 1965 working for the Post newspapers, Drum g magazine, the World, and the ~ Johannesburg Sunday Times e> Extra (black edition). He § founded the Union of Black !- Journalists which was banned ~ by the South African goverrru ,g ment in October 1977. ~ a :§. journalist he exposed conditions of the black migrant workers in the mines, use of child labor, abuses of police power, and police harassment in South Africa. Following police harassment Kumalo fled the country in Jtme 1977 and is now in the United States. He has written reports in numerous U.S. newspapers and addressed many campus groups and other public forums. The next speaker will be Hanning Petersie, who is a member of the white ~ dominating govet·nment now in power. in South Africa. This · speech will be open only to Union students and the date and time will be announced. Professor Dawson stresses that students should show courtesy and allow him to present his ideas before they start to challenge him. It is important, he explained, that whether one agrees or disagrees with South African government policies, all sides of the issue should be given the chance to be presented. For the last speaker, Professor Dawson is trying to get a representative from the African National Congress who would present an opposing view from H~nning and show how African governments, such as Zimbabwe,. that are now led by the black majority have worked. In keeping with this topic, Professor Dawson, on May 18, at 10:30 a.m. will be showing to his class and anyone. else who is interested, a film \Last grave in Dimbaza.\ The film depicts rural African life. Professor Mark Dawson arranged for South African speakers to ' . cotne to the campus. recent years, are having more trouble getting work this sprfug, the· officers add. \Last year 1\'aS a tough year, and thiS year's going to be even worse,'' warns Victor Lin- ·dquist, placement chief at Northwestern University and director of the Endicott Report, an annual survey of job prospects for college grads nationwide. \Companies keep waiting for this recovery that the president's trying to jawbone into place, hut it may be a long time in coming,\ he predicts. Back in January, the Endicott Report forecas~e~ American business would offer the Class of '83 11 percent fewer jobs than it did the Class of '82. '\'Now Lindquist says, \it's even worse than we thought.\ \For the Class of '83, it'll be the toughest year since World War II,\ adds Jack Shingleton, Michigan State's placement director and coordinator of that school's annual natienal student job survey. Other campus placement directors . report. spring recruitment is off, as much as 50 percent from last year's depressed levels. Consequently,. the summer job market will be more crowded than ever, with fewer jobs available as companies continue to delay hiring new employees.' \There'll be 1,300,000 students graduating this spring,'' Shingleton points out. \There'll be a million jobs open.\ Overall, Michigan State thinks students with bachelor's degrees. will get . 17 percent fewer job offers than a year ago. Liberal arts majors will have the hardest time finding work, Shingleton's study found. Things are better for elec- trical engineers, computer science, business and. other engineering grads, in that or- der. But there r .e stil112 percent fewer engineering positions available this year than last year, the College Placement Council says. Similarly, even schools that are faring relatively well this spring are in terrible shape. ''Our recruitment is down about 25 percent, and we're one . of the fortunate OJ:ltlS,\ Lin- dquist says. At New Mexico State' University, the number of employers recruiting on campus is down a whopping 44 pe,rcent, placement Director Steven Salway says. _ Company after company canceled recruiting visits, leaving seniors' job search nothing short of ''horrendous,'' hesays. _ Twenty-five percent of the firms scheduled to interview at Kentucky this spring canceled because they \just aren't recruiting in order to save money,'; Drema Howard, U's associate placement director, says. ''We're down about 36 .percent from a year ago in the number of recruiters, and we have 18 percent fewer students being interviewed,\ says Oregon State AssoCiate Placement Director Marjorie M. Bride. \In the oid days we'd have had 200 to 300 recruiters on campus in the spring. This year it's in the 50s bracket.\ · McBride is urging students to \get out, and contact employers directly,\ rather than relying on campus interviews. \This year is just the worst I've ever seen,'' she moans. \We'll be hiring considerably less this year/' says Phil DeLong, · spokesman for American Telephone and Telegraph's college recruit- ment division. ''Partly because of the economy, and partly because of our divestiture proceedings, we're taking a cautious, Wait-and-see at- titude.\ ''And salary offers are not increasing like they were several years ago,\ she adds. \For the last few years we saw salaries increasing by eight-to- ten percent a year. This year they've gone.

So all·of these things contributedto my contentment. By JUDIE STEINHARDT Staff Eight new faculty members have been hired so far for ne:x;t' year. Some were hired out of a need for more professors in the department, while others were hired because a professor was retil'ing. The faculty members were hired on a one or two year basis,. so tfie school can have a chance to see if it is going to work and the professor can have a chance to change his-her mind. After the one or two year . period, a new contract can be negotiated. The faculty that were hired are specialists in a variety of fields. Two of the people granted contracts wiU be joining the ·Economics Pepartment in September. One is Harold 0. Fried, who will automatically be an Assistant Professor because he already has his Ph.D. from· the University of North Carolina. Dr. Fried got his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan. He is currently an Assistant Professor at Tulane University and is particularly interested in International Economics. The other specialist hired in Economics is David-, Schaffer, who was hired to replace a professor who resigned two years ago and was never permanently replaced. Mr. Schaffer is expecting his Ph.D. from MIT in July of this year. He earned his bachelor's degree at Swarthmore College. His areas of concentration include Applied Micro Theory and Fiscal Economics-Public Finance. Dr. Fried .and Mr. Schaffer are welcome additions to the Economics Department ~cause there never seems to be enough Economics professors. . ' . Housing Lottery Begins The housing lottery will be conducted from May 5 to May 24. The computer will randomly assign nurtlbers to students by class year. That is ·to say, the computer randomly as$igns numbers to members of the classes of 84, 85, and 86 that live in college-owned residence halls: The computer then translates the random number to a number that is un- derstandable-! through 300- roughly the class size for each year. This will be done for each class with the exception of the irtconnng new students. . Members of the Residence Life Staff will distribute to eligiOle students a lottery card bearing the student's name, lD number, and lottery number. The student must present his- her ID and pick up his ... her lottery card in person. Only students presenting ID's .will receive a lottery card. If it is impossible for a student to pick up his-her lottery card that night, he-she· may do .so at the :Residence Life Office the next . day. The selection of available on- campus housing will be divided · into two categories: Singles, and doubles and suites .. Campus housing will be selected ac- cording to class year and by the lottery number assigned to each student. '..,. Singles Lottery: The .senior with the lowest lottery m.unber will have first choice. of avaUalile singles. The senior witll the next lowest lottery ntunber Will have the second cb9ice. If some singles have not · been selected and there are no more seniors ·present,. the junior .present with the lowest number will have first choice of the remaining singles. 'rhis process will continue until all singles have been selected or no eligible student is present to select a single~ lottery, and finally the sophomore lottery. The class member present with the lowest lottery number will have first pick. The class member with the next lowest number, and present, will ·follow. When a suite or double is selected, all roommates must be present and all must sign contracts. The room or suite will be placed back into the lottery if any of the roommates do not sign the contract when the room or suite is selected. All occupants of a room or suite who are found to have cheated will lose any right to the room or suite. Additionally, the person(s) who cheated will be fined $100. Points of interest: Class standing is determined by tbe number of credits received at· the end of winter term - no exceptions; you mu.st be on campus all of spring term to participate in the lottery.

Higgins expects her Ph.D; from Yale University some time this year. Her speciality is Middle English, especially Chaucer, and she wrote her dissertation on \Time and the English Corpus Christi Plays.\ Higgins went to the University of Connecticut as an undergraduate. She will be replacing Professor Murphy, who is retiring. A chemist who is currently lecturing at the University of California, Berkeley, where he also received his Ph.D., was hired for the Chemistry Department. He is Lawrence McGahey, and he received his bachelor of science degree from the University of. Notre Dame. Dr. McGahey is replacing Professor Sheffer, who is retiring. Two · math professors who were hired are R. Michael Canjar and V.L.N. Sarma. Dr. Canjar is currently an Assistant Professor at St. Mary's College, Maryland. He did his un- dergraduate work at the University of Detroit and he got his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan. He did his thesis on ''Model Theoretic Properties of Countable Ultraproducts Without the Continum Hypothesis.\ The only in- formation available about Sarma is that he's from India and he is very qualified. Ludmila Kapschutschenko was hired in the Modern Languages Department to be an Assistant Professor of Spanish. She is an Assistant Professor now at Vassar College. She earned both her bachelor's and master's degrees at Temple University and she got her J;>h.D. at the University of Pennsylvania. She was hired because various professors go away on the terms abroad program, and their spaces need to be filled. Priscilla R. Wella was hired . as a part-time accounting in- structor for the Institute ·of Administration and Management. She got her bachelor's degree at the University of Rhode Island, her master's at SUNY Albany, and is currently working on her Ph.D. at R.P.I., which· she hopes to complete in 1985. She will be continuing work on her Ph.D. while she teaches at Union. Vice President D'Andrea is pleased with the people hlred already, but he hopes to hire more people in the areas of Electrical Engineering-Com- puter Sciences, Sociology, and Physics. He says the way in which the school goes about hiring professors is really quite complicated. First, each department forms a committee for the purpose of deciding what kind of person is needed. Then the school places ads in various professional journrils, and it has to advertise very broadly in order to satisfy the Affirmative Action Officer. Union's Affir- mative Action Officer, Biology Professor Margaret Schadler, must make sure the school is being fatr throughout the process of selecting new professors. After advertising, the school starts to receive dossiers including recom- mendations, publications, and transcripts. The stronger candidates are then invited· to campus and granted in- terviews. They usually are asked to give a lecture in their area of interest. After they leave, the department com- mittee will caucus and the department chairman will notify the Vice President of their decision. By tbe time a professor is actually teaching · on this campus, he-she has passed a lot of tests. This is hOw we can be sure our new. professors are well qualified.

Well, I want tomakeclear, ... that this was a profes~ional not a personal deciSion. And indeed, I wanted to make it very clear that I'm not resigning because of 1 any personal campaign against me, but rather because of a general problem that women faculty suffer.

CONCORDY: And are these things that you made clear when you explained what your reasons were .for resigning? CLINTON: Yes, very clear. (pause) But, well I don't want to speak for the administration. Let me just say that I think when I expressed my feelings to Vice President D'Andrea about the dissatisfaction, he ex- pressed his feelings about my resignation and we were both well aware of each oth'er's at~ titudes on this particular issue.

CLINTON:· No. I don't thjnk that is really appropriate at this time, I would say that he ex· pressed no interest in .or con~ cern for my future, except. w.ishing me good luck. CONCORDY: Is there anything else you would like to add? CLINTON: No. I want to make this statement here·, and just make sure that everyone on campus understands the reasons for my leaving. l very much regret leaving the friends behind' who have made my four · years here most happy. But, I will be very pleased at escaping hostile detractors. CONCORDY: What are your plans for the futllfe? · CLINTON:. As a final note, I will be leaving Union to join the faculty of the Harvard History Department in September. I will be teaching my specialties o{ course: slavery, history of the old South, and I'm most pleased to be the first member ,of the Harvard History Department to teach a course on Women's History. CON CORDY: Do you have any objection to my speaking to your department chairperson? CLINTON: No. You can ask comments from anyone. I don't object to that. My interest is .to make my position cleat. I don't want this to be a debate between me and the administration over whether or not women are being fairly treated, or given equal civil· rights. After all, I. don't think they are; and that is w~y I'm resigning-which is pretty serious. How much more serjous' can you be about an issue? ·The difference of opinion is so great that I was forced to leave. I feel very strongly that I was forced to leave by my strqpg dissatisfaction. I know that many people find 111e headstrong and . perhaps idealistic about believing tltat an institution can change, and go forward, and improve itself. But I believe th~t there are many people her~ with fine ideals. They should make themselves aware of wllat is going .on around them. A.nd after becoming aware of these situations maybe they slto1,1ld not simply retreat into .their own officest and .their own personal concerns, but maybe look around the faculty and see what is happening to the deCline of . morale among their colleagues, most espedally those few women left on the faculty. CON CORDY: Well, what could somebody do if tney see a situation like this, especially if they are not yet tenured and are afraid for their position? CLINTON: Of course if someone feels that they bave not been fairly treated, there are appeals committees, and one can go directly to the President as I did {on behalf of a colleague) and write a letter. But at the same tirne, it's all climate and atmosphere. It's whether you have an open and concerned administration or you ·have an indifferent ar.d· ministration. And in my opil;lion the adminiStration wants to quiet and appease, rather than to. confront these problems. I hope they will change f.or tile better in future years. Professor Clinton's resignation will ,be effective September 1, 1983. At that time she will be joining the faculty of the Depattment of History at Harvard University.

KRUTOFF Arts Editor The Festival ·of the Arts for Peace., five days of quality theatriCal, educational and cultural events that revolve around the: is~Jie of nuclear disarmament, will be in the Capital Distrlct MaY 4 through B. Three groups:participating in the Festival will be performing here a:t Union next week. The Caravan Dancers The first group: to perform will be the Caravan dancers. They will appear 'Tuesday evenin~, May 3, in the Arts Building room202 at 6 p.m. 'fllis presentation is open to tbe public. The dance program consists of eight pieces, all of which have political themes. Som~ deal with specific issues, such .as nuclear disarmament or the United States' involvement in El Salvador, while others treat broader questions, such as the f11te of the individual in conflict with society. \Nuns Don't Run Road- blocks'' is .1;1 collaborative dance-theater piece created by Carmen Castaneda of E1 Salvador, Eva Gasteazoro of Nicaragua and Ha1lie Wannamaker of the U.S .. It addresses the issue of US. involvement in El Salvador aild Central America. By usi11;g spoken testimony of Salvadorans involved in - the. struggle, recorded statements of Reagan administration representatives, and the po.pular-cultural music of Yolocamba Ita, the choreographers personalize the effects of U.S. intervention as well as convey the hopes and aspirations of the Salvadorans struggling for their right to self- determination. \Red Density\ refers to Oile ' of the chemical .properties of radium. In Nancy Zendora's piece of that title a narrator describes Marie Curie's discovery of tadium-~tne ql:lestions she and ner husband, Pierre, asked themselves; the rnista'kes; the successes--as .three dancers move in an en- viromnent of symbolic red paper. They shred the paper as they approach the · audience, creating an ivcreasingly dense space. _ . \T(Ingo Echo Bravo Romeo November\ are among the code words used ·by the President to commence a nuclear attack. This piece choreographed by Martha Bowers was created in a workshop on Dance· and Disarmament given last spring a:s one of the events leading up to the June 12 rally. Using danc,.e, scripts from document;.lry sources about the arms race, dialogue and an original music score by com- poser Frank Ferrucci, the piece traces the escalating arms .buildup as· well as the personal feelings and dreams each df.lncer bas abo1:1t their own future. There is humor present in both text and choreography but it is a very black humor, indeed. · The last piece has grown out of the collective efforts of the entire group over a period of several months. It serves as an introduction, in movement, to the group and to the individuals within it. The Bread and Puppet Theatre The Bread and Puppet Theatr.e will be performing .on the Library field, Friday af- ternoon at 3 p.m. The group will be presenting their fun-filled '~CIRCUS.\ The Btead and Puppet Theatre was founded in 1~62 by German sculptor, Peter Schumann, who is the director, puppet-designer and show- writer.

It was produced at the American Place Theatre and won four Obies for best production· and best per- formance in 1980-81. According to William A. Raidy ·Of The Star Ledger, \Emily Mann's documentary-style drama about a troubled survivor of the Vietnam conflict, that war that almost everyone wants to forget but can't, 'Still Life' disturbs one with its stark reality.

PERFORMlNG ARTISTS FOR NUCLEAR .OlSAR- MAMENT is a group whose members include all those who make the performing arts happen: musicians, dancers and actors; playwrights, composers, screenwriters and choreographers; producers and directors; designers, technicians, administrators and critics - -united in an effort to bring about world-wide nuclear disarmament. They are offering their skills and talents te the many national and international groups committed to freeing them from the terror of nuclear weapons. They realize that the very survival of life on earth is threatened, while vast sums of money, needed to relieve human suffering, are consumed in building the means of an- nihilation. They reject the nuclear arms _race and the social and economic policies that sustain it. PAND is committed to educating the performing arts community and its supporters on all issues related to nuclear disarmament; to initiating and sponsoring performance events that will bring this crucial subject to public attention; and to creating vital links between the performing arts community and other organizations or groups working towards the goal of world-wide nuclear disarmament. As artists, they recognize their urgent duty to awaken in themselves and to share with their audiences the creative will' to turn the world back from death to life. They embrace all artistic means and forms which serve this end. o• Andrea On·· Drums By ROBIN MOLELLA Staff Union educators are always encouraging students to be well rounded, and it seems their . encouragement is not idle talk. Vice President D'Andrea, an educator by day, is also an accomplished · professional musician. D'Andrea, a percussionist, began his musical career as a young boy in Minnesota. His father, a miner, decided to teach young D'Andrea to play during the long winter months when it was not possible · to mine. D'Andrea soon became known as the boy who played the drums. In those days he played in the ~muniCipal band, marching in the Memorial Day Parade, Fourth of July Parade, and jamming with friends. As D'Andrea .grew and went off to college in Minneapolis, he went with full intentions to continue playing. He par- ticipatM< in many bands, and played at fraternity parties and dances. As he became more known, he played for wedding$ and bar mitzvahs and other Minneapolis social fwl<!tions. During the summers he got more steady employment. Music provedprofitable and Dr. D'Andrea was able to work his way through college and graduate school on his musical earnings. Most of what D' .Andrea played then was jazz and pop, but while in graduate school, he decided to take some lessons from the principal percussionist from what is now the Minnesota Orchestra. What he learJted was that what his father had taught him was absolutely correct. The per- cussionist schooled him iri the art of classical percussion, teaching D'Andrea how to play such instruments as the tym- pany, xylophone, and other assorted tools of the orchestra percussionist. Then by a twist of fate, D'Andrea was asked by his teacher to be a substitute in the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. D'Andrea made his orchestral debut playing \L'Histoire du Soldat,\ · a percussion showpiece, requiring great skill on the part of the one per· bership to Schenectady. He now looks forward to weekend jobs, and other opportunities to play. Most recently, ·during Schenectady County Com- munity College's week long festival of the arts, Dr. D'Andrea was the featured drummer in a jam session of local professional jazz Vice President D'Andrea: \Educat()r by day/\ drummer by night. cussionist. Since then D'Andrea has been involved in both classical music and jazz. Somewhere in the midst of attaining his doctorate D'Andrea was faced with th~ choice of whether he wanted to be a full time musician, or a professor. Education won. But ~hough music didn't come first, 1t has always come a close second. Throughout the past years, D'Andrea has used his music as a release from the tensions of his life. When he came to Union College several years ago, he transferred his union mem- musicians. D'Andrea has also played at different times on the Union campus. Dr. D'Andrea has two daughters, both of whom are talented musically. His eldest plays classical flute and piano, while the younger who also plays piano, plays the electric base, shares her father's love for jazz. • D'Andrea is an avid fan of Union's musical arts, and would like to see more of the secret musicians come out of the ''closet,\ saying, \It's a won- derful way to get your mind off things.\ 0 0 J::. c. 0 Cl c Q) t!)

'•· .. i ,, Page 6 OONCORDIENSIS, April 28, 19S3 THE ARTS Marshall Berman a·t Union By DEBBIE ALIJERT and STEFF! PROPOS Marshall Berman is currently a professor ef Political Science at City College of New York. In coordination with the Minerva Committee at Union, aided by Professor Smi'th, Professor Berman came to Union on April 25 to give two lectures. Professor Berman had just recently published a book, All that is Solid Melts into Air, which deals with the idea of modernism growing out of the self as a response to the changing environment. The book also discusses modern literature and thought, mainly European, and captures the beauty of the literature. At 3:30, on April 25, in the Humanities Lounge, Professor B-erman focused mainly on one.. chapterin'his book. The chapter dealt with the writings of the Fren·chman., Bordelaire. Berman read four poems from Bordelaire's book Paris Spleen, and then there was a discussion period where the audience was able to express their views. The four poems, \Crowds'' \Beat up the Poor\ \The Eyes of the Poor\ \Loss of a Halo\ were all written in the 1860's and then were written to be accessible to ordinary readers. In light of this, some were published in the local newspapers. After Ber- man read the prose, people began discussing their in- terpretations and opinions. The atmosphere . at this talk was very relaxed and the audience seemed to be eagerly involved in giving their ·views. Later that evening, in Strauss LQunge, at 8:00p.m., Union had the· privilege of viewing slides of Professor Berman. The lecture at night dealt with the Lower East Side in New York City. The Lovter East Side is a place of a tremendous past as well .as present. Recently, there have been federal proposals and approvals for establishing an artist housing development. Because of Professor Berman's interest, he became very in- volved in this project. Today, it is very hard to ignore what is happening in the Lower East Side. From his experiences, Professor Berman put together a slide shOw and lecture, Art, Ruins and the Politlcs of Meaning on the Lower East Side. Professor Berman discussed some of the nostalgia of the area and then went on to discuss the problems occurring there t()day. · In the 1970's, the Lower East Side saw sor,ne very bad times .. Drugs and arson became tne area's biggest industries and destruction was becoming a way of life. Due to these problems, homocides in- creased, and at the same Ume, some of the population left, and much of the housing stock was lost due to the arson. Most of the Lower East Side consisted. of large concentrations of refug.ees (Jews, Chinese, Hispanics, Irish, etc ... ) A large number of ·peo,ple have remained, but as time continues to pass on, the destruction of the area has not gotten much better. As Professor Berman described this destruction, \I felt like a piece of flesh was being ripped off me.\ However, as he later described, along with aU of the destruction, the area has gained a vast assort- ment of ruins. Anyone who is interested in Professor Berman's material, will be pleased to know that his book has come out in pap'er- back. Professor Berman provided Union with a unique view of life on the Lower East Side, as well as giving to all those who listened to him a greater understanding and appreciation of art and the artist.

The award-winning magician has substituted a somewhat trimmed program for the previously a_nneunced Broadway extrayaganza, but from all reports the concert version has all the makings of an impressive and thoroughly entrancing evening's en- tertainment. ' Similar appearances by the son of Harry Blackstone, Sr., one of the premier magicians of the Golden Age of American Magic, have prompted critics to proclaim the illusionist as \the best in the business; a second- generation master of hi;:; hap- pily revived art.'' Among the highlights of the Blackstone performance are The Floating Lightbulb, Harry Jt\.'s space age adaptation of one of his father's mo.st famous levitations in which a lighted bulb hangs stationary in the air while a ring is· passed over it- it then floats out over the heads of ,the audienc.e; the baffling Zig Zag lady in which Blackstone's wife Gay is divided into three parts and the vanishing bird- cage which disappears instantly while a mob of children from the audience are touching it. Audience participation is said to be at least fifty percent ot the Blackstone program including , one segment in which an audience member is selected as a ·candidate to be sawed in two. Rope escapes, The Dancing , ... Handkerchief, precognition and pick pocketing are . other features of the show that is sparked by Blackstone's ·showmanship -said to be comparable to Li:berace's, and wit -called a cross between the hwnor of Steve Allen and Don Rickles. Missing from the Schenec- tady appearance are . a few large animals which had originally been promised as part o£ the show. Upon receiving word that the show had been geared down, .Proc· tor's management renegotiated the contract with the magician anQ, decided to pass the savings on to customers. ''We know that our audiences will be tbrilled by the excellence of this master illusionist and showman,!! said Dennis Madden, Executive Director at Proctor's, \and in no way feel that this will be a less entertaining show than the one we had booked at first. However, the production does cost us less and we feel it is only right to allow our audience to share in the savings with the discount.\ ·Ticket prices for the evening have been reduced $1.50 with' a $1.50 rebate due all who have already purchased their tickets -either in cash at the Box Office up to the day of the per- formances, or· as a coupon worth cash at the door on the evening of the show. Tickets are now·priced at $13.50, $12.00 and $8.50. Any other transactions regarding Blackstone tickets- must be taken care of before May 1.

With such .an impressive line-up-the four men's college and university chori)Ses recognized as perhaps the finest in the Northeastern United Stat~s-an evening of high quality vocalizing was ensured. And to say that the Union men d:istinguished themselves would grossly understate their stunning performance.

Page 8 OONCJORDIENSIS~ April}~8, 1983 FEATUR·ES • / Attraction, Friendship and Love !Union 50 -veorsAgol By LORI FAVATA Staff Pro.fessor Donn Byrne, Ichabod Spencer Lecturer in Psychology, spoke on social psychological principles of attraction, friendship, and love, last Tuesday When interpreting attraction there are four characteristics that help determine the in• tensity: propinquity, need for affiliation, affect, and physical attractiveness. One interesting point made was that if two people live within 22 feet of each other there is a good chance , that they will become friends. If these same two people lived more than 88 feet apart, the chances of them meeting and becoming friends are nil. Our need for affiliation depends on factors such as how we were raised, whether or not the meeting occurs during an emotionally arousing situation, and the nwnber of friends we have as compared to the number we need·. He went on to say that in many instances we are- in a sense- assigned who our friends will be based merely on circumstances such as assigned seating. As might be expected, physical at• tractiveness is one of the most powerful variables in deter- mining attraction. It has been seen that people have a ten- dency to mateh with respect to physical attractiveness. Attractive children are rated higher by their teachers in terms of personal qualities. and it has also been detennined that attractive criminals may . be given lighter jail sentences than their fellow lawbreakers. The reasons certain people become friends while others do not can be explained by their attitude similarities, per- sonality similarities, . ~nd reciprocity of pos1t1ve WINTER TERMS . ABROAD Applications for winter 1984 terms abroad are now being accepted. The dead line for ap-. pi ications is on May 2. Winter terms to be offered will be a term in Atbens, Greece, Seville, Spain, and a kibbutz in Israel. Each program requires a prerequisite course. For Greece the prerequisite is Classics· 21; for Spain, the prerequisite is Spanish. 10 for the first track and Spanish 133 for the upper frack. The term in Israel requires Hebrew 10 as the prerequisite. The cost for all programs abroad next year is similar to the cost of tuition; room and board here on campus.

Se('mi ngl ~ trivial charac· ten;;IJcs. ::;uch as which shoe one ties first, can play an important role in determining with whom we will be friends. Love can be classified into three types: passionate love, breaking up, and companionate love. To lo:ve a person, one must find someone who is an ap- propriate love object. They have to take in all the cues around them in order to believe .and to know it is l'ove. And they must be aroused and miSin· terpret this arousal. In one study, men on suspension bridges were found to be much more interested in the women experimenter they encountered inunediately afterwards, than those encountered iri safer situations. Professor Byrne finished by spei;lking about how relation- ships. fall apart. He said couples reach a point where _positive things begin to drop off and the people feel comfortable enough with each other to do negative things. Some reasons many relationships don't last are tnat the relationship was not ''too rear' to begin with (in. cases such as love at first sight), one or both partners ~ecome bored, or they have .differences in interests, sexual habits, background or feelings about marriage. Byrne's advice to help keep relationships going is to base the .relationships on fhe same things friendships are based on. One strong factor is the decrease In negativ.e aspects and a continuous em- phasis on the positive. · Professor Byrne hastaught at San Francisco, Texas, Purdue. He is presently the chairman of personnel in psychology at SUNY Albany. He is the.author of twelve psychology books and over 150 research articles. Molsoa -· .......... . . . By DAPHNE CHIGAS Staff What was Union College like 50 years ago? According to Dr. Louis 'DiCa_rlo, class of 1932, Union was a far cry from that which we .know today. 'Or. DiCarlo spoke at a Pre-Health Society meeting two Tuesd1;1ys ago .. Fifty years ago, students were requiredtogo,to Memorial Chapel every morning to sing the Alma Mater. Those who missed even one word were given a \haircut\ also known as a crew-cut. Dr.DiCarlojokingly colllinented that throughout his career at Union; he rarely needed an off-campus haircut! In those days, Union was one of the top colleges in the country, in the same league as Harvard and Yale. Classes were rigorouS and lasted the whole day. At this time, students began forming a governing body. Every Saturday night was known as \Skidmore Night\ . and the whole ca~pus (which was aU male at the time) ventured up to Saratoga to visit Skidmore women. Well, some things never change! DiCarlo did not enter Union r·ight after high school but rather went int(l the Army-_and the State Police. After graduating from Union as valedictorian of his· class, DiCarlo spent some time ·working for the Department of Welfare and for other orgarJ~ation~ but for the most part he could nl)t ,find work. After finally· receiving a position at Syrac~tse University, DiCarlo has received, some 38 awardS of distinction for his work. in audiology, For those who are worried about .getting a job after college, Dr. DiCarlo's life is sure to be a, lesson. AU those years between high school and his career became the foun- dation for a brilliant career for Dr. DiCarlo. ~ ~ '·. .. ·:·:, ~: -;~~;;~~rtt.t :',•, AVAILABLE AT THE DUTCH ·H·OLLOW PUB· , ....... . ·The finest ale brewed il!ld bottled in Canadaj~po.rtedb~ Ma~tlet Importing Q;, ,Inc. ,.Great Neck, N.Y. © 1982, j,. ••

On a trial basis this year, two students from Cornell are being allowed to take the .program. Three Union students from the six-year medical program who are currently at Albany Medical College will be VVben asked about ptoblenns that have develop~d in Eastern Europe, Baker responded that there really have not been that many. During the first trip to Poland though the dormitory the group was supposed to stay at was \so roach infested that the group moved to a hotel.\ Another problem during one trip was that sonne Union students had drinking bouts with a Russian wrestling team. The Union students, for the most part, were drunk right under the tables in the bar. Professor Baker feels that By FRANKLIN SCHNEIDER Features Staff Party Animals: Or, I.Was a Victim of the Beer Rally I had .been practicing for this event for the past two months. An extensive training program had been followed, getting me into top shape. My car was all tuned up, with tne other crew members fueled up and ready to go. . Needless to say, I was in- credibly psyched up for tnis grand ~vent. Eagerly awaiting the start, the squad of myself, the driv.er; Pave, my navigator, manager, and co-pilot; and four of the best looking female drinkers on this campus. The flag was up and we were off. The shotgun at the Lodge went down easily, as we headed tawards our first off campus bar, Geppetas. The car had hardly idled when we were off to the next drinking establish- ment, the Wagon Wheel. We were on a .. roll, and victory seemed to be in our hands. Although we missed Roes on our first try, time was made up by the · incredible \chuggability\ of my crew members. They even impressed some of the regulars in the bar with their deep-throating ex• pertise. Our journey next found us at the· famed Froelich's, where a draft Bud was con- swned as ·if it werewater. Trouble soon found us at the Pawn Shop, where one of my crew members rejected the last fruit of her efforts. Fortunately I had · taken pre-race precautions and .bought a car with a hatchback to facilitate any brought on reverse peristalsis . .Sickness or nature's calling would not cause us to lose time. At the Burnt Hills Inn my other crew members became sick as well,. but my waste removal .system func- tioned as expected. Danny's Rodeo and Paul's went like blurs, but we got the job done!! Problems occured between Club 77 and Abner's, Where my crew members had to run diagonally across the street to go from one bar to the next. Though their paths were far HILLEL.

With hand-.held stomachs, and faces :hanging O\lt the window, they cried, .. Let's go ,on!!·'' I continued driving at a furious ;pace, when suddenly catching something in my rearview mirror: a pair of flashing red lights. Yes, even the Balston Spa Police had heard about the rally and were eag·et to participate. The charge was DWR (Driving While Rallying).. My half- crazed banterings .(we were losing time} failed me as the afficer announced all in the vehicle would be p1,1nished. Actually, the justice that was dealt did fit the crime · - two shots of Old Mr. Boston vodka for everyone.. Punishment received, we forged on. Saratoga was a joy~filled sight as we ,knew there were only two bar.s left. After a quick parallel park on Broadway, the crew and I dashed into the Bijou, where a 12 oz. draft was downed by all. Barclay's; the last stop, lay ahead of us. What sbould have been a short stroll down the street turned out to be a long stagger. This part of the trip also occupied the most time (gee, those girls are hard to carry). Safely at our destination, the last beer was downed, along with mY crew. As I sat in the booth, looking at my exhausted crew, I reflected upon the night's events. Though victory was not ours, Dave's and my gallant efforts were heartily rewarded by the other members of the crew. We may not have __ won, but we sure got lUcky. Breakfast Special This summer nineteen students will have, accor.ding to Associate Professor of Philosophy Robert Baker, \One of the most .memorable ex- periences of their lives.\ The students will be going to Europe as part of Union's Socialized MediCine Program. They will be studying in England, Sweden, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. The study of socialized medicine begins here in the United States with visits to the Albany Medical College, Capital District Psychiatric Center, and St. Clares Hospital. Most students begin the study of socialized medicine thinking that the most important issue is the method of payment. Very quickly, the students realiz.e, that the method of payment is only one of many questions to be put before them. ' Union College was the first college in the country to offer. the study ·of Sociali:~;ed medicine at the undergraduate level. Professor Baker first conceived the program and will .be the faculty member directing the program again this summer. Preofesor Baker, wanted to design the program to help create, \more critically ar- ticulate and thoughtful doc- tors.\ He feels that since medical school \is a trade school, if doctors are to have broadening experiences they have to occur before or after medical school. H According to Baker,only one other college in the country offers a program like this. For a number of years students from Ivy League schools have been trying very hard to get into the program, but they had never been allowed to take the going. · In each country the students in the program visit, they will have the opportunity to visit a private practice, , large acad~mic hospital, psyehiatric hospital, and a clinic. A private practice will be about the same in all of the countries but there Will be a number of differences in the other areas. Professor Baker said that some studentsdrop·out after the U.S. portion of the program, because, for some, getting acquainted With the hospitals is difficult. F.irst experiences with the sick, retarded or mentally ill can be very difficult. In European hospitals, students have been able to see operations performed and, once, in . Poland, they were allowed to watch an am- putation. Even in England, the .students are shocked. by the differences in the concept of patient care. In an English hospitai, it is not surprising to find patients in wards with 50 to GO patients, with a common dining table in the middle of the ward. Eating together, ac- cording to the British, is an act symbolizing being a regular member of the community. About one-third of the time spent in Europe will be devoted to learning about the culture as it relates to the delivery of health care services. Cultural differences can lead to dif- ferences in the concept and the delivery of health care. For example, the British consider the ward concept as normal, while we in the U.S. prefer our private or semi-private roo~. buy any breakfast speci a 1-coffee is free 8:00-10:00 a.m. Wednesday Nite- Steak Nite at the pub steak, salad bar, potato & glass of Tuesday Nite - SpagheHi Nite -a II the spaghetti you can eat -salad bar -garlic bread -glass of beer, wine or soda only $4.39 I) u T { beer, wine or soda $5.95 Mid· Afternoon Special 2:00-4:00 buy any sandwich- The beverage-half price Nice Weather? take our lunch to the gardens-- brown ba.g lunch: sandwich, fruit & beverage Bar Open Mon. & Wed. 4:30-8:30 ll{)LL()W Professor Bob Baker, director of the Socialized Medicine Term Abroad Eastern Europe is the most exciting part of the trip. Union's \.Study of Socialized Medicine\ term . abroad is an exciting and interesting ex- perience for all who participate. Most students return with a greater concept of what socialized medicine really is like. There has not been a general consensus made about socialized medicine at the end · of the terms abroad, but all of the students realize that what they thought in the beginning was too simple. Socialized medicine and how society allocates its resowces to fight illness and disease is a very delicate and complicated issue.

Soon there will be a new brand of FM radio in the Capital District, as. WRUC gets a sur.ge of power to strengthen its .. tirwaves to ten times their present wattage. The red tape for this project has taken a full five years, but good things come to those who wait. The problems encountered would h.ave discouraged most, but the administrators and students dedicated to . WR UC persevered to this final success. . Broadcasting range is expected to reach lowntown Albany as well as other environs of the same prox.imity. N.ot only will more Union students begin to listen as they finally recognize the legitimacy of their own radio station, but people and organizations in the area will become more·. aware of happenings on campus. The WRUC editorial boards and staffs of the past five years, and especially those students currently serving, deserve a round of applause from the campus community. Our radio station has, without a doubt, some of the most -enthusiastic undergrads involved in Unl()n student activities. Once again, congr-atulations. A 63-year-old tradition lives on, str0nger than ever. Resignation Unclear There is often controversy between ''The Establishment'' and those who find themselves confined by that EstabUshment. Union College is no exception. The resignation of Catherine Clinton is the most recent evidence of this. Although the Administration and the faculty may not always be at odds, it would be naive to believe that their interactions are without problems. The heated discussions that sometimes .prevail are conducted behind the veil of tradition, not to mention closed doors. If word of confrontation or accusation manages to escape these barriers, the Administration is quick to quiet this . . . • 'loose talk.\ The allegations made by Catherine Clinton will not be so easily quieted. Whether they are truthful or not is up to the Administration to demonstrate. In trying to examine the issues., Ooncordiensis found itself drowning in ambiguity. The faculty and Administrators, alias scholars and academicians,· appear to have a somewhat political if not sophistical side to their characters. It has been difficult to cut through tbe confusion and rhetortc in order to establisb exactly what is, and what is not going on. Vested interests ana personal conflicts have filtered into the issue making identification of the truth difficult if not impossible. The only discernible truth is that Catherine Clinton has resigned. The reasons that she supplies for ber resignation .must be viewed in the context of her perceptio'n of events. How closely these perceptions resemble reality is a frightening and unclear concern. Be A Leader Are we making any progress in curing that epidemic of apathy? In less than two weeks, .freshmen, sophomores and juniors will be elected by their classmates to serve as student government representatives and officers for next year. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually have more people running than there are positions open? Everyone on carnpus has some complaints about the workings of oar school. Here is the chance to ''put your money where your mouth ls'' and get involved. These positions still carry with them a certain degree of honor, too. , Last year, for three junior representative openings, exactly three juniors submitted petitions. and got their names on the ballot. Sure, this eliminates indecision on the part of the voter, but if pe<>ple continue to r.un unopposed we could end up with someone like Ronald Reagan on tbe Forum. Or James Watt. ·· Completed petitions are due next Friday. Show some interest in student activities and run for office.

Would you predict that such a system weuld (l) adversely affect the quality of the class per- formance {2) leave it unaf· fecte<l (3) imp11ove that quality. .(b) Assume the same grading system, but suppose, in addition, that the following temptations are competing for time; a close-by beach; a girlfriend or boyfriend eager for your attention;. the opportunity to earn a profit of $2,000 f?r more by simultaneously enrolling in exactly the same courses in the Evening Division. Would this situation (1) weaken your ·commitment to the course in which you are guaranteed a B; (2) leave it unaffected; (3) strenghthen it? (c) Assume the same. as in \b\, except that now the teachers announce that a .fraction of the class will receive almost insignificantly high~r grades (although they refuse to declare beforehand just how. much higher or exactly what the standards are .for earning them). Assume, further, that past-experience has led you ~o believe the ,teachers are not fair; that the exams and papers you submit for each course will be graded by visiting ·high school students and teachers from other courses,; that yQu will improve your chance for a better grade by turning in what you ,know to be nonsence and will almost certainly hurt those chances by sticking to your intellectual conviction.; that,. although you have the right to protest your grade, the teachers never bother to justify or ex- plain it. Would this set of cir:- curnstan~es (1) tempt you to try .to forg.et this insanity by heading for the beach with your friend; (2) ·not affect your ac- tions; (3) inspire you to give your courses your best shof?

The Editorial Board Union College Undergraduate Review of Humanities and · Social Sciences Response To Greek Weak 11o the Editor: The following letter is · a response to the editorial Greek Weak, which appears in last . week's edition of Concordiensis. The Panhellenic Council is the organization at Union devoted to issues concerning Union'S sororities. It is with concern about several ••myths\ cir• culating the campus that we present our position with respect to a fourth sorority on campus. The editorial began stating that \The Admissions Office claims that students at Union are encouraged to tak~ the initiative artd become in- volved in. Campus activities.\ This is certainly true, and it should be stated that the Panhellenic Co'UI).cil supports this ideaology wholeheartedly. The editorial continues to state that two students are taking such initiative and trying to start a fourth sorority at Unjon. The Pimhellenic supports an addition of a fourth ·sorority, and for that matter a .. fifth, sixth, and so on. The issue, however; is not the eventual addition -of a new sorority, but the timing chosen to solicit one. With the interests of the female Greek System at heart, the Panhellenic feels that now is not a good time to add a fourth sorority. This position is based on several good reasons. First, it has not been determined that there is a real, and . sufficient need for a fourth sorority. The list of names presented to the Panhellenic Council . by the · women working for a .fourth sorority contained a small percentage of women who , actually went through rush, and . were dissatisfied with e~isting sororities. The list does contain names of women who · have neve,r gone through rush, women already in an eltisting sorority, and senior women who would not be able to commit themselves to a fourth group since they presumably will have graduated. This leads the Panhellenic to conclude that the list is mis-representative ,of real interest in a fourth sorority. Second, the sorority system has not seen a substantial number of women participating· in formal rush to date .with ex- ception of this past fall. At present, the Sorority System, and the. Panhellenic is in a period of transition. Therefore, an additional sorority may make a further division of.the present numbers, leaving one or more of the present organizations at a disadvantage, Thirdly, the individual sororities, along with the Panhellenic, are in a period of transition, with the addition Co~nm;entary: of Delta Delta Delta. The system needs more time to organize and. become more cohesive before the addition of a fourth sorority. . . In conclusion, we once again refer back to the editorial which · ass.erts \Since the Adxninistration is striving to achieve a 50-50 male to female ratio, it seems logical that the balance between fraternities and sororities should also even out eventually.\ This goal to achieve a balance of 50-50 betw.een fraternities and ·. sororities is very idealistic, We should remember that Unions' fraternal. system has been growing since the early 1800's. Sixteen fraternities in ap- proximately 150 years is growth at a stable, reasonable rate. While the Panhellenic does not propose that we wait that long to find equality, we do feel that three sororities since 1978 (five years) is a healthy growth. We propose the postponement of a fpurth sorority until the present organizations are mote stable. We want to be behind any new group 100 percent to insure its success, and positive transition into the Union Panhellenic System; and in another year or two, if all goes well, we feel we can be. The Pari-Hellenic Council Reproductive Freedom? By ERIC LIPMAN Staff I heard an odd pl;lrase the other day, ''reproductive freedom.\ It struck me as odd, because it was used to defend the Medicaid funding for abortions as a way to preserve the freedom of women to reproduce, and to make essential decisions -about their own bodies. The trouble is, I have serious doubts about whether a woman who looks to the state to perform or pay for an abortion is really looking for freedom; and if so, freedom from what ?Is the child who has been conceived oppressing the mother? Is being conceived a crime for which a child should die? These are questions which bother me, as they cannot be explained away by fancy rhetoric. I feel that the goal of our nation is, and should be, not to deny anyone any freedom -we should be just; fair, and com- passionate. Our government, as our representative, should be DON 1 T BE APATHETIC APPLYNOWt Applications_ are STILL available for the following eommiHees: 1. Conunittee on Committees 10.

We should -no more turn the pregnant mother \into the back alleys,\ as we should extinguish the life of· a baby who has not had a chance to be a part of this world. Our orientation should be one towards life; which means a commitment to the life, liberty and freedom for both mother and child. It seems to me that the pregnant mother's ''reproductive freedmn,'' ex:ercised by an abortion, ends the hope that the child will exercise any freedom at all. 'l'he resources at our disposal should be committed to trying to provide for the health and safety of both the mother and child; and medical advances now allow the child and its parent to be separated quite early on, Which legitimately means the choice between \medical procedures\ which terminate life, and ''medical procedures\ which protect and preserve life. Given such alternatives, and noting that the United States is not an uncompassionate or insensitive nationt why should we continue to feel that \freedom\ might in some way be linked to kUling unborn children. COMMENTARIES Responses To Last Week's Dueling Opinion:· Should The Student Forum Fund Political Organizations · Or Interest -Groups By CHRIS ESIIELMAN The question of whether or not political or religioua groups should receive fllllding is very open to debate for a number :uf reasons. I think the foremost question, though, is whether or not it is possible to delineate what constitutes a c~mtroversial group. According to a recently passed resolution on recognition and funding criteria for campus groups, no group which sup- ports specific partisan or sectarian ideals can be funded. No group which is discriminatory on the basis of race, color, creed, or sex canbe funded. And no aw-areness group Which is funded can continue to receive funding if it continually presents only one side of a11 -issue. Cle~rly, the Student Forum is interested in making sure that no inherently unfair groups get funding. But these rules, as they're being enforced here at Union, are too strict. The JSO Hillel organizatiGns at both SUNY Albany and RPI are funded. Yes, they are, for all intents and purposes, closed to non-Jews, but they present cultural ac- tivities which are open to the entire campus community. The organization itself is closed, but its activities are not. Another groupatSUNY, the Puerto Rico Independence Solidarity Alliance, has received funding although it is stated in their constitution that they oppose Puerto Rican statehood. It would seem that funding for By ANDREW FUZZ WELLEN and DAVE HAVILAND We disagree strongly with the Student Forum's rationale for refusing funding to United , Campuses to Prevent Nuclear War (UCAM). The Forum draws the distinction between awareness and interest groups, classifying UCAM as the latter. They say that student activities money should not support in- terest groups because they further a cause which ,some students rnay be ideologically ·opposed to. This distinction· between interest and awareness groups is meaningless. The Forum must recognize that even \awareness\ groups funded with student activities money support a special interest, and make students .aware of this interest. Not every student is interested in Yachting or Frisbee, and yet these organizations receive funding. Although these groups may not take a political stance, they maintain a definite point of view. Since all groups further special interests, it is obvious that the Student Forum;s criteria for funding (based on whether or not an organization espouses a .special interest or political viewpoint) is absurd because it would lead to all groups receiving no funding at all. Instead, funds should be controversial groups is somewhat more lax at other colleges. At this college, the whole issue came up because of the efforts of United Campuses To Prevent Nuclear War to receive f11nding. One argument advanced by the group is that they deserve funding on the basis of their fairly sizable membership. The Student Forwn argued that this had nothing to do with the issue; that controversy is controversy. If this is the case; that the Student Forum feels that level of concern and participation are irrelevant to the issue, they weaken their own case which is based on the belief that large numbers of students would object to having a portion of their student activity fee go to support a group which might, among other things, lobby for a nuclear freeze. Student Forum is on the one hand legitimizing, nay, basing their whole argument, on level of student interest, and on the other hand, totally discounting it. Whatever the Forum finally decides about controversial groups and student apathy, I only hope they realize that the spectre of controversy is not the worst tbitig that could rear its ugly head on campus. Sure, it's fair to be concerned that with looser funding guidelines, a group like the KKK might be next on the horizon, but should we let this fear, like the hypochondriac's fear of disease; be the deciding factor in our policies? Area colleges have said no, and so do I. administered on the basis of student support for a group's particular interest, whether political or not. UCAM has ample student support with over 100 members, 25 of whom help to organize events. Fur- thermore, the campus com- munity has shown an active interest by participating in UCAM sponsored events. BecatJSe UCAM attracts more student interest than even some groups which presently receive funding, UCAM should be granted a budget. Students at Union College have little opportunity to develop political points of view outside of the social sciences departments. This has led to tretnendotJS political apathy on campus. However, the students' interest in UCAM demonstrates this willingness to think critically about alternatives to Nuclear Arms escalation. Groups such as UCAM provide support for ideas which are not fostered by the status quo. It is important that these ideas be heard and critically examined. If the Student Forum would recognize that political ac· tivism is an important part of campus life and would fund political organizations with sufficient support, political apathy on campus would decrease. This would generate enthusiasm_ amongst the students to express more openly their frustrations with stagnant American culture.

And that is where it belongs, trampled on the floor by run- ning pages and swept up as garbage by nnuttering cleaning women. · Perhaps it was said best by the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights- \it is time for Senator Hatch to recognize that his beliefs are not shared by the American public.\ The :right to abortion is a freedom guaranteed in spirit, if not the letter, of our Con- stitution. So determined the highest of courts in 1973. Orrin's hatchet work is offensive on many levels. It first has the gall to un- dermine the effectiveness of the Supreme Court by trampling the coRcept of separation of power. Such an action is only justified if a decision is violently in contrast to public opinion - the views of the actual majority. Such an enlightened work must have been created by the definitive authority on Con- stitutional law in the country. After aU, who else would have the nerve attacking the scholarly conclusions of a group of men, and now woman, chosen with at least an eye for qualifications. And to hit at the heart of the matter, how dare this an- tiquated politician pass judgment on an extremely private and individual decision. No woman takes the matter trivially or has he closed his eyes to the tears. Orrin Hatch's most heinous crime is not public stupidity but absolute insensitivity. If I were a woman, I would cringe in horror at this legislative invasion of my body. As a man, I can only seek to comfort the victim of this violation. And oppose it.

SPORTS . ••• Tourney Play Softball Splits Pair ByG,OOTS Sports Staff The Union College Women's Softball Team hosted a tour- nament, or at least half of one, on the turf this past Saturday. In their first game, against the Skidmore team, Union was the winner, breaking their two game losing streak. Fielding · well but hitting rather sporadically, Union· squeaked by their opponents 6-5. Offen- sive highlights for the Union team included third basemen Cathy Bentley and center fielder Brenda Hugick drawing three walks apiece, shortstop Peg Petro's hard hitting con- tinued, but after getting robbed of a few solid hits she ended up with only a single to her credit. In one of the early innings left Union didn't fare quite as well, losing to St. Rose by a score of 13~9. Behind the accurate pit- ·ching of Cathy Bentley Union played well defensively, with few errors but they allowed a few too many runs to score. Offensively on the other hand, , Union was kept to only four runs compared to St. Rose's 13, until the bottom of the seventh in- ning. At that point, with only one out left In the game, and St. Rose ahead by nine runs, Union's bats let loose and the Dutchmen experienced their first successful rally of the s~ason.

Dina came into the game with bases loaded and only one out, she walked one batter, and consequently one. run in, but came through a tense situation intact, retiring the side with no further scoring.

However; this record does not show the true. ability and pot-ential of the team. Most of the games have been high scoring for both sides, and many times the Union women have kept the score close throughout the game. communication between the zone players is led by Ber- nadette .Albanese. A notable , connector between offense and defense: is sophomore Kathy Furst. As the team's center, Kathy shows skill and agility necessary for this zoo position. This year's J .. V. team has exhibited exceptional skill and speed. Many ate only first year players, and together with the more experienced members their skillwork increases noticibly with each game. The team's present record stands at three wins and two losses. This team shows balanced scoring ability by the offense, as well as consistent defensive play. With more playing experience this year, the women should prove to be even stronger in. the years to come. Joanne Dolan handled the \hot corner\ for Union during tournament softbal·l action. Union has displayed good teamwork along. with strong defensive and offensive play. High scorers on attack ar-e Cay Lynch (12 goals), Hol!y Howard and Emily· Monosson (11 goals each).

Right fielder Cheri Wong also smacked a home run over the left fielder's head to aid the Dutchmen's cause. Both cat- cher Karen Roth and pitcher Dina Pliotis managed . two singles apiece helping the team emerge victorious. Defensive highlights included fast, ac- curate pltching by Dina Pliotis, and a great throw from catcher Karen Roth to second baseman JoAnn Dolan, who tagged the runner out in an attempted steal.

Unfortunately, after hitting incredibly (but a bit too late to win) Union lost to St. Rose, leaving the bases loaded. There were many more highlights from the game aside from the last i.Jming rally; center fielder Brenda Hugick laid down an awesome bunt and sped her way to first.

Knight finished the past season (11-11-22) ~trong after a knee injury sidelined him after just eleven games into his freshman year. The 6'0, 175lbs. winger is a native of Worcester, Mass., where he led St. John's Qf Shrewsbury to the state championship game. Prior to enrolling at Union, Knight took a post-graduate year at Deerfield. Knight is already looking to, next season. \I feel we have good people .involved with the program and it is going places. This season was disappointing, but we learned a great deal from it and the same mistakes won't happen next season.\ Egan is perhaps the best all- around hockey player returning next season. This is evident as Egan finished the season 9-11-20 after missing several .games , With a bad injury to his thumb and seeing a lot of playing time on defense. Egan ended this season seventeenth on Union's all-time scoring list with forty- ei·ght points. The Nepean, Ontario native was ''truly honored'' by the election and is also looking ahead - to next season. \The ultimate goal of Union's program each year is to make the playoffs.

The only c:: score of t'hts .game came on one § of the prettiest plays of the ~ season. Union won Syracuse's .o serum, and charged down the -E field passing the ball down the a line. The ball tra-velled from the serum via Steve Patterson to Backhouse to Wilbur to Fredericks to Woodman and across the goal line pefore S.U. knew what had hit them. The kick after went through the uprights and Union led 6..0. The rest .of the game saw a grueling fight with Union fighting .off attack after attack while S. U. found their hands full with a stronger and smarter Union offense. When the final whistle blew, Union had defeated the ex-champions 6..0. In the third game of the af- ternoon, Union was up against.a fresh Cortland team. This game was full of solo tackles, hard hitting and great strategic rugby. Unfortunately Union found itself on the wrong end of a win and the victorious Cor- tland went on to win the tour- nament. The B·side played later on in the afternoon, tying a more experienced Buffalo team, 0-0. One more highli&ht of the With SCOTI' WYKOFF · Sports Staff In college sports the word reputation is often thrown around when talldng about particular institutions and the athletic teams that represent those schools. Over the last two years Union's football team has earned a reputation for being one of the top squads in the East. Teams that have perenially romped ori the Dutchmen over the years are starting to take notice after having the tables turned on them by Bagnoli's boys in the fall of '82. The many years Of football obscurity are now in the .past for Union· and the Dut- chmen can only enhance their pigskin reputation in the seasons to come. Union College Skating Dut .. chmen hockey, much like football, has a reputation associated with it. But the evolution of Union's hockey reputation is much different from that of football in Schenectady. Amazingly, the Skating Dutchmen hockey team still carries with it the stigma that was created over .six years ago when Ned Harkness resigned as coach and the program came under a great deal of scrutiny for alleged wrongdoings. In this reporter's travels as a radio voice for Union hockey, I'm continually questioned in relation to what went on at Achilles while I was just a mere junior high school cub reporter back in Cleveland. People don't chat about Charlie Morrison or Tod Fobare but are more interested in talking about the past. Once, while watching an NHL game on television I marveled at the color com- mentator who mentioned that Ranger goalie Steve Baker was a graduate of the now-defunct Union College hockey program. Who know:S what it will take for Skating Dutchmen hockey to play down this reputation that follows the team presently. Six years have passed and hockey still has a reputation dating back to the Harknt::ss years. How about Dutchmen basketball, back in the early seventies they were the hottest tournament was that fly-half Russ Backhouse was selected to the Upstate Rugby Union Under-23 Team, a prestigious honor to both Russ and also to winter entertainment in the Capital District. Basketball had a fine tradition as a strong program that produced con- tinual winning campaigns. For the last several seasons though, Dutchmen hoopsters have .had the joy of playing in front of empty seats at the fieldhouse. But much like Union football, the Dutchmen basketball squad has in one year earned for itself a reputation as one of the best Div. III squads in the state. Observers quickly forget ab•,ut the years of obscurity and talk of the powerhouse that Scanlon has put together. Players and fans alike will go into next winter's season knowing the reputation earned by the 1982-aa Dutchmen hoop edition will be in the back of the minds of many Union opponents even though it's a brand new season. Led· by second•year head coach Russ Ebbets, the Dut· chmen track squad is quickly gaining a reputation as a strong program. Prior to Ebbets' hiring, track wallowed in ob- scurity at Union. Top track athletes would enter school as freshmen and show little in- terest in competing for such an lowly program. But with the hiring of Ebbets and the con- struction of the million dollar track facility, Union is now able to catch the attention of potential campus competitors and the growth. in numbers of team members speaks for it- self. Last year only aroWld fifteen students competed on the indoor team while this year over forty found themselves on the Dutchmen track roster. Ebbets' coaching peers marvel at the turnaround in Union track and predict a powerhouse in the near future. Dutchmen track, basketball and football have successfully earned for themselvea reputations for being able to win and win big. Although Skating Dutchmen hockey team bas not made postseason play recently, they, too- deserve recognition for the present and not for what transpired over six years ago. the team.

The . important aspect of momentum is that when a team has it, goals must be scored. In their first .game this week, Union wasn't able to do this consistently and lost to an opportunistic Middlebury squad, 16-7. In their second game, Union took full ad- vantage of their momentum, and crushed Oneonta 1&.3. In the Middlebury game, Union started off sky high, controlling the ball for most of the first period. Yet, at the end of the period the game was tied at one, as Union missed many opportunities to score. In the second period Union lost their intensity, and Middlebury put four balls past Steve Koscs to make the score 5-l at halftime. The third period resembled the second for the first ten minutes and soon Middlebury had built up ~ 8-2 lead. Towards the end of the period, though, Union regained the momentum, and this time it produced some goals. After two more quick goals in the first minute of the fourth quarter, including Mark Marro's second goal of the game, Union had come back to make it a 9-7 game, and looked poised for more. Then Middlebury's Dana Thomson, who had ten points on the day, scored a goal for Middlebury that seemed to take the wind out of the Dutchmen's sails. All phases of Union's game sagged and Middlebury eventually scored six more goals to make the final 16-7. The Oneonta game was a different story, as Union seemed to dominate the whole contest. Mark Ehudin scored enough goals alone for a Union win as he tallied seven. Union's defense was also outstanding. Not only were just three goals scored, but two of them came while Union was a man down. Ehudin had hiS hat trick by the end of the first quarter, and it helped Union to a 4-1 lead. Oneonta came back with two powerplay goals in the second. period .and were as close as 6-3 when the ;half ended. For the first twelve minutes of the third quarter no one scored a point, although Union seemed to be in control the whole time. Oneonta was not exactly a formidabl'e opponent for the Dutchmen as their 1'•7 record showed, and their haplessness continued~ at the end of the period when Ted Whitehead broke the third period scoring draught. In the fourth quarter Union put on a nine-goal scoring barrage that iced the game for the Dut- chmen. In order for Union to have a successful season, identical performances to the one put on against Oneonta will have to be played. Although the defense was not at its best against Middlebury it is the offensive punch that mainly concerns Coach Meagher and his staff. - . ...,.,.,. .•. ~---.<- \\·¢., ....... ._ ~~' ,....1L., ..

Hardballers Break Ice By BLACKNESS Sports Staff The Dutchmen baseball squad picked up their first victory of the· season after four straight defeats last Saturday with a 6-2 victory over Norwich in the first game of a doubleheader. The second game was called because of darkness after the teams had battled to a 3-3 tie through' the regulation seven innings. Union was able to find the clutch hitting that. they had been lacking in previous games. Pete Cohan's seventh inning grand slam produced a victory in the opener, and Joe Wood's two-.run home run in the sixth inning of the second game knotted the score and a:llowetl · the Dut- chmen to avert defeat. In the first game, Norwich scored a single run in the second to assumt the lead, but the Dutclunen came back with two runs in the bottom of the inning, the big hit being a bases-loaded single by George Oberstadt. . The Cadets tied the score with a run in the fifth and the Dut- chmen found themselves in the familiar situation of being deadlocked entering the final inning. This time Union prevailed, loading the bases with one out in the seventh, which set up the pinch-hit slam by Cohan. Nat Harris pitched superbly in picking up the victory, yielding just fiye hits and two runs in seven innings. Norwich jwnped on top again in the second game, scoring three runs in the second inning. Charlie Hickey scored Union's first run in the sixth on a ground ball. Then with two out and one on base Joe Wood lashed along shot to right-center field. With Andy Dreher scoring ahead of him, Wood legged it out for a home run. It was Wood's second round-tripper of the year, and it tied the game at 3-3.

Independent Colleges OONOORDIENSIS, April '1, 1983 Tobiessen, Plans Changes For _C.areer Center ByLYNN:~NO Staff. This spring the Career Center is beginning a new outlook with a new director, Joanne Tobiessen, and a new name, the Career Development Center. Ms. Tobiessen was carefully chosen by Union from a two- month search proce$8 which involved 100 candidates. Her association with Union goes back five years wben she co- taught a course on women going: back to work ln Union'·S Continuing Studies program. After gojng tlu~ough. several careers herself and' getting her master's in. s~ial wotk, this course spurred her interest in career planning. Prior to coming to Union Tobiessen was the director of the Career Center at Russell' Sage College. Her .enthusiasm and effectiveness ar~ already apparent in the rapid changes she is making in the Career Development Center. using para-professionals. The .para~profession,.ls will be Union College student$ who \ViJl run workshops ·for other students on the career planning process. Applications on the ··Rise The change in the name reflects the chalige in the objectives of the\ center. Tobiessen explains thilt the new function of the center is to \provide comprehtmsive career planning, from freshmen to senior ye81\.\ She stresses that\ it is important to think about one's career options, even as ~ly as freshman. year. This does not mean that a student must commit himself or herself· to a lifetime cm-eer as a freslmupl, but by starting early there is time to explore many possibilities. Stqdents can be aware of the r.esources, explore different areas and spend summers testing, careers. In addition, by start,mg early one can begin to develop .skillS that will contribute to skills involved in a particular j()b area. Tobiessen iS also bringing to Union an emphasis on ·the career plans. of the Liberal Arts student. She encourages the Liberal Arts students to come and $pe8Jt with her or the other counselors abo1,1t the po$sibiJities of. jobs~ She e~plains that Liberal Arts majors have many marketable skills, such ,.s writing and communicating and .adapting to different situations · that technical people don't· have. Tobiessen will be spending much. of her time contacting businesses and employers and · encouraging them to consider Liberal Arts students, as weU as creating ties witb these companies and Union College. (CPS) - Last fall private colleges shuddered in what they feared was the first stage of a long-expected decline in enrollment, while public schools managed a marginal nation- wide gain of 27,000 st!Jdents. But a just-completed study of freshnlan applications for the fall, 1983 term suggests just the opposite might happen next year. The number of freshman applications at private colleges is up seven percent over this time last year, according to the Chronicle ofmgber Education's annual survey of admissions trends, while applications to. public schools have dropped by eight percent. If those application figures hold, observers say, they represent 'a-. dramatic and unanticipated reprieve for many of the nations's 1600 in- dependent colleges and universities. in actual enrollment next fall,\ says Gary Hudgens, spokesman for the National .Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges. Hudgens speculates the decline reflects student reluctance to apply to schools early mote than it does a coming decrease in public campus enrollment. NAICU als9 plans to stick with its original projections of next. fall's private college populations for the time being, McNamara says, \although we'll be pleasantly surprised if those early application figures hold true.\ ''We're making an eff9rt to be less negative about this year's· enrollment than we originally thought,'' he notes, \especially . since financial aid wasn't cut like some people predicted. B.ut once you get a downturn like we badthis fall, it's extremely hard to pull out ol it .in one year's time~\ The downturn was dramatic. Private college enrollment fell by nearly four percentsince the 1981-..82 school y~ar. Observers attributed the declilte to a student migration .from the more expensive in- dependent campuses to cheaper four- and two-year public colleges. . The four-year public college . population did grow marginally. while community college enrollment jmnped by an estimated foul\ percent.

All involved agree that both the President and the Board of Trustees realize the need for such a center. Hauser feels that although Union. is a quality school, its education costs keep- increasing and the College must offer more than just a good education. Benson, speaking as a student on the conunittee, feels that it is the one outstanding feature that the College lacks. He explained that one reason that the campus is so enjoyable in the spring is that when the weather becomes warm everyone. congregates in front of the . library. In the winter there is no place where students can interact and . socialize comfortably and without going out of their way. It is for this reason that the . central location of Carnegie Hall was chosen for the prop·osed· site. Although no construction plans have been . drawn up it has been. stiggested that the Center might be extended in some way out behind Carnegie to where the machine and assembly plant is now locat~d. It .might possibly be deslgned, Mammola speculated; ~ith some relationship to Jackson's Gardens• The students involved in the committee seem very enthusiastic and -optimistic about the project.

At the present time, he explained, lounge space is / not adequate in m(lst buildings on campus. These buildings date back to wheil Union was a single sex college. The Center will give the campus greater opportunity \to come together as a College\ in terms of the relationships between the faculty and students and in the interaction students have with each othe.r.\ It will have a significant impact on campus social life for students, Mammola explained . Ideas for the program were self-generated by committee members and were also based on models of College C~nters in other campuses. The committee also drew infonnation from a report of the Student Activities Committee on the' collMe residence halls and fraternities and ·sororities, and a ·.report which was done a ~ew years back on the campus dining needs. Mammola also .stressed that the committee relies heavily on the input from the s~udent representatives. After the report is completed, revisions may be made based on ideas from the President and inp\Qt from the College community .

Cha.irperson Sought Draft;.Aid Link / By MA:RCYBURSTINER News Editor During spring term each year, the Committee on Com- mittees accepts a~plications for School Burden Eased (CPS)~ The U. S. Dept. of Education may relieve male students of the need to document that they have registered for the draft in order to get federal financial aid. At a congressional hearing last week, Undersecretary .of Education Gary Jones' said the department may change the contr~v:e.rs.ial pro,pose~d regulat.ron; and change its ·ef- fective date from July 1st, '1983 to February 1st, 1984. Under the new regulation, men would still have to declare whether or not they'd registered, but they wouldn't have to \verify'' their registration in order to get aid. The changes, Jones told the House postsecondary education subcommittee, \will re.duce substantially the ad- ministrative burden that colleges and scho'ols believe was inherent. in our proposed rule.\ Congress passed a law last year requiring men to show proof of military registration when they applied for federal student aid. The Dept. of Education has been struggling to draw up regulations to im~ plement the law. Draft protesters have argued the law is unconstitutional because it discriminates against men and would force nonregistrants to incriminate themselves. Financial aid officers. around the country have complailled the law would bury them in paperwork and force them to serve as the Selective Service System's police. · . Under the proposed change, schools wouldn't be involved in . helping the government verify . registration .for two years; . at which time verification procedures would be phased .in gradually ... ''It's a much more manageable situation,\ Martin says. \The schools would not be the policemen in these mat- ters.\ But opponents of the la:w it- self, which links financial aid and the draft, are unmollified-. ''Forget about the . regulations. The important thing iS that the law is un- constitutional,\ says Gail Sush- man, a lawyer .for the Min- nesota Public Interest . Group . (MPIRG'), which recently convinced federal Judge Donald Alsop to enjoin schools tem- porarily from requiring students to make any sort of registration statements when applying for aid. Sushman says the Education Dept.'s new regulation proposals are \an obyious political deal in order to get the pressure (from angry aid of- ficers) off them (department regulators).\ Indeed, Sushman asserts ''some sort of deal was cut between\ Rep. Gerald Soloman, who authored the law linking aid and military registration, and Dallas Martin, head of the aid,... administrators' association. She claims Solonian; who couldn't he reached ·f-or com- ment, wanted to escape aid administrators' lobbying and to strip their support·. from MPIRG's constitutional attack on the law. In the wake of the new proposals, Dennis Martin - Dallas Martin's assistant - did seem to take the constitutional issue less emphatically than previously. Asked if the proposed regUlations would help solve students-' constitutional dilemma in facing the aid forms, Martin said \that's a separate issue, and still-a very lively issue. But~t least this is a better approach from the Dept. of Education.\ Enforcement of the law would now \be a matter between the student and Selective Service . At least the schools would be out of the middle.\ \The kid signs the (new} form once, fills 'in the name of the institution and ticks off a box saying he's registered or that he doesn't need to register, u says Bob Jamroz of the Dept,. of Education. Department officials will conduct \on-site in- vestigations\ to verify if students ,getting aid are ac- tually registered, Jamroz says. If students lie on the form about it, 1 'we'll catch them.\ \But (the new regulation proposal) is no big deal anyway,'' Sushman maintains. \The law is still - un- constitutional. The courts will take care of that.'.'

This year the deadline .for ap- plications, April 4; was an- noWlced one month early in the March 4 issue of Concordiensis. Unfortunately, according to Larry Castelli, Vice President for Administration on the Student Forwn and Chainnan of the COC, only 12 applications were handed in for the 13 positions available. The turnout was ''disapm pointing,\ according to Castelli. In order to generate more applications he has extended the deadline one week. Unless enough applications for the positions are received, the Student Forum will be forced to accept those students who do· apply, regardless of thetr ability, experience, or character. \I want people to apply so I can make a choice ... I want to be able to pick the best people possible for the job,\ Castelli explained. The committees for which the chairperson position is open are the Concert, Conduct, Elec- tions, Filni, and Sooial Com- · mittees, Speakers Forum, and out that the announcement in Concordiensis came out one moJ]th ago and he feels that many students who did intend to apply for a position may have forgotten about the deadline in the interim. Although the result is ·disappointing, Castelli ex- plained, it is also somewhat understandable. He suggested that anotber major reason which keeps qualified students from applying for positions of responsibility is tbat next year many of them are going or are considering going on a term abroad. In the past the COC has discouraged those students from seeking readership 'positions on committees because of the problems it would cause within that com- mittee. · This year the COC is willing to make a few \exceptions to the rule,\ due to the current need for qualified students. As examples,- he suggested that it is possible to become chair- person of the Elections Com- mittee and yet go away fall term. It seems that the com- mittee does not-become actively 11 1 want people to apply so I can make a choice ••• I want to be able to pick the best people possible for the lob.\ · Traffic and Pet Court. As of Tuesday afternoon, no ap- plications were turned in for the Elections and Social Comm mittees or .for the Speakers Forum. Announcements for positions were publicized not only in Concordtensis but also at the Student Activities Box· Office and on WRUC. There were a number of reasons for this poor turnout, commented Castelli. The weekend of the deadline hap- pened to fall on the Easter and Passover holidays and many students went home for the weekend. In addition, final examinations, spring break and course registration may have taken priority in the minds of students. Castelli also pointed involved until winter term. In addition, one can chair the TrafUc and Pet Court and spend fall term abroad or lead the S~cial Conuni~tee and go away wmter term Without causing too much difficulty. He warned though, that .such exceptions are not always possible for many of the positions available. For example, if one seeks to chair the ·Concert Committee they must relinquish the opportunlty to spend a term abroad. Students are encouraged to apply this week for chairperson positions. Deadline for the applications is now April 11 and they are due at the Student Activities office in Carnegie Hall.

Staff The. fourth floor ,of the Schaffer Library is a very special place~ · This .place contains many of Union College's most valued posseSSic;>ns and artifacts from its history: •. AccorcUng to Ellen Fladger, the archivist of the college, -many students go through their four years at the college. without even realizing that the Special Collections section of the library exists. She ·feels that this is bad because -the archives.of ,the college can be an ~portant part of the total education that one should receive froJn the college. · When one first visits the Special Collections, that person will certainly be impressed by the diversity of items contained ()n thefourthfloorofthe library. InJact, many of the items could be found· in a museum. It is more than a collection of books. In many respects the Special Collections section is a type of museum- dedicated to the College's history to which JOIN THE HCK anyone is invited to visit. The following is only a brief list of some of the possessions in the Special Collections of the college. The history of . the college began around 1795 and that is the date when . the Special Collections 'begins what is called the \Union Collection.\ In this section of the archives is a collection of books written by faculty and students, old yearbooks, lecture notes from classes taught during different times, ·· every copy . of Concordiensis publiShed, and many old exams. AccoWlt books and financial records of the college from the very beginning are also part of thifl collection. Even vouchers .and receipts are kept here~ It is possible to see what famous alumni of the college paid in twtion, room, board, and in fines. The vef)' first books purchased for the College's library are kept in the Special Collections. All have yellow pages and are very fragile but you may take them out of their \acid-free boxes\ to look at COULD YOUR CAMPUS GROUP USEA QUICK $500-$1 000? . I • IF '(OU'VE GOT THE TlME ...

Prints from famous artiSts and photographs can also be found in the archives. ''The Bailey Collection,\ a collection of books that contain 19th century wit and humor, is also here for your use. Many of the books, besides being old, are also very rare. The rare books include \private presses,\ handalettered books, and books by famous authors. One of the rare books is a Bible. printed in 1478. Not all of the books in the Special Collections are special because they're old. Many bo.oks are special for reasons other than age. Pearson's Diary is a very Wlique item in the archiv,es. It is one of the best places that one can find out what was happening .at Union while Eliphalet Nott was president. Mr. Pearson worked at the college ina number of positions. He kept a diary of what was happening at the college and his personal .feelings of Mr. Nott .. His diary spans about thirty years and fills a number of volwnes. There are over 120 manuscript collections that are housed in the archives. The records of the Schenectady Academy of Science and Technology are also housed in the arcbives. Included in this collection is the records of F. W. Alexanderson, who worked on the invention of teleViSion. Also in this collection is records of the early research on the atomic bomb. other items in the Special Collections are a skull. a tombstone, a pipe shaped like the Nott Memorjal, swords owned by alumni, among many others. Ellen Fladger feels that having a s~cial section devoted to the college's history and valuable items enriches the college's academic cormnunity. Without such a collection, much of the college's history and many valuable and rare items would be-lost. The Special Collections section is open every weekday except Wednesday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Some items cannot be seen on short notice,. so one should get in touch with Ellen Fladger or someone at the Reference Desk first. No student should go through four years at Union without visiting the Special Collections at least once. You will find that it is a very special place. 1982 YEARBOOKS are on sale now at , STUDENT ACTIVITIES OFFICE $13.

I accidentally discovered the Nott Parking Scam - the sordid tale of how 'Qnion's most famous Iandmark..had illegaily parked i~self upon Library Field. This weelr comes the solution to the ,mystery surrounding a newly· arrived vehicle to the Union grol.Ulds - the notorious ''Tree Transporter.'' Whlle heading drowsily off to my 8:30 Monday morning, I suddenly awoke upon the sight of an enormous .vebi:cle apparently removing a tree from the .ground. -\Why?\ became the obVious question. Certainly such an insidious act reeks of corruption. The solution came today as I watched such an apparently pointless action take place. WhUe \planting'' a tree in front or Carnegie, a structure resembling that of an arm {or leg) stuck out of the \scoop'' of the truck. \No. it couldn't be· human,\ I told myself. Boy, was I surprised when .the shocking news came. Coming ·from the busbes was a suspect undercurrent of laughter. Hot on the trail of the clue, I found its source ..... a premedical student in hysterics. When I inquired to Knight Shirts (CPS) As man~ as 10 percent· of the .nation's. colleges and universities want to outfit Ted Knig'bt. Actor Knigl)t plays a character on the'DV show; ''Too Close For Comfort\ who has a pencbaDt for wearing college sweatshirts, an$! some 300 colleges have sent free . sweatshirts to l{nigbtto wear on the air, according to show publicist Henri Bol.lillger. The reason: valuable free publicity .. Bollinger couldn't estimate the actual vE.llue . of network exposure to a school, but points out the network sells 3();.second spots during the show for .$100,000. Penn, Boston College, Baylor, and Temple are among the. schools that have solicited Knight's body. It's a way of saying \please tell America that we're a college and we're out there,\ says Beverly Shurden, a spokeswoman for the series'_ producers. Knight is pleased because anything I can do to promote education in this country is worthwhile,\ the actor ·said. Bollinger says the whole thing started by acciden~ when Knight happened to wear a University of Washington sweatshirt. ''He would wear one every show now and again,\ he recalls. \people began to notice it.\ · · Still, some schools are unprepared when destiny calls. Sarah Lawrence College publicist Jan Levi sheepishly admits she wasn't as \aggressive\ as she should have been in badgering \Too Close For Comfort\ into using one of her sweatshirts on the air, and was. unprepared when the show called her. Show producer Don Taffner's dau,ghter started at Sarah · Lawrence last fall, and Taffner asked Levi for a shirt to use on the air. Levi had to search the campus \frantically\ to get someone to open the campus bookstore in order to rush a sweatshirt off in time for a taping. The shirt eventually became what may be the most expensive sweatshirt in · ~merica when Knight autographed and returned· it to Levi, who auctioned it off for a $100 contribution to the college scholarship fund on February 11. . Most of the other shirts are being stored, though Knight has kept ''about a dozen\ sweatshirts that he particularly liked, Bollinger says. - •Albany, NY • Connecticut • Garden City, i..l • Huntington, Ll •Ithaca, NY • Manhattan • Central & North New Jersey • Westchester ADELPHI UNIVERSITY OFFERS: Extensive 40-hr. or 32-hr. \Weekender\ courses •live lectures· Simulated exam conditions • Special.home-study materials • Tape library • Up-to-date course materials • Counseling a free and samp class covering the LSAT and the Law School admission process: CALL COLLECT: or write: (516) 481·4034 Adelphi University's LSAt Preparation Course Center for Career & Lifelong Learning . 307 Eagle Avenue, West Hempstead, N.Y. 11552 In cooperation with The National Center for .Educational Te~ting, Inc. wQ.at was so funny, he :responded by, \One down, one hundred nineteen more to go.\ · It seems that this student, who wishes to remain anonymous until admission at John Hopkins, is .part of an • 'underworld\ organization composed of pre-professional students. By eliminating tb~ir­ competition, they are guaranteed of entrance into g!'aduate school. . However. this is' not your traditional thrcoaty group of students. As the laughing student informed me, this . group believ~s in creative methods to eliminate one's cop:1petition. A case in pojDt would be the tree transplantation. First the unsuspecting victim. is lured into conversation with the assailant. Next, the two walk and converse heading in the general direction of the . tree transplanter - the new subject of conversation. The two students decide to take a closer ' look at the actual workings of the apparatus. Then it happensll Suddenly the unsuspecting student is thrown into the path of the converging blades. Another victim has fallen into the evil clutches of the sinister organization. . As for when the carnage will stop, my infonnant gave two possibillti~s: after the members of this group area all accepted into graduate school, or until they have eliminated (killed off) enough of their competition. Is there an end in .sight to this monstrous activity? Let's hope that someone in graduate admissions is doing their job. As for now, these apparently worthless acts will continue. But wait , why is the sound of a diesel engine looming in the background? Could it be? ... Arn I? ... Oh no!, I'm the next victim!! Prof(;lssor Josef Schmee directs Union's Institute of Administration \nd Management Robots at Union By JEREMYL.KOSHEL Staff The Institute of Administration and Management was established at Union College in 1962 to provide '• a· comprehensive decision- oriented education to students pre.paring for careers as managers in business, govern- ment, and non-profit en- terprises. 11 Within the I. A.M. is an · 1'4BA program in Health Systems Administration, which prepares graduates for entry level positions in health ser- vices and planning organizations. Union's .program in Health Systems Admin- istration is one of only four that are accredited in New York State. The Union College H.S.A. was recently accredited by the Middle States Association, although a similar program at New York University was turned down. Professor Josef Schmee, Director of the I.A.M., is pleased about the H.S.A. 's accredidation and the I.A.M.'s inception of a robot curriculum. The I. A.M. is in the process of exploring the potential Qf trobotization in industry. With the robot the I.A.M. has now students get a background that can lead to managerial em- ployment in a manufacturing environment as opposed to in a financial institution. The acquisition of \teach robots\ which are tabletop modelS, is a prospect for the I.A.M. curriculwn. The tabletop model is used to study bow robots can be implemented into business. The robot curriculum has boosted student morale and, according to Professor Schmee, \It is one of many interesting aspects of the l.A.M._, though not the dominating feature.\ Professor Sclunee is conscious of the issue of whether robots displace workers or create jobs. He feels that every stage of automation creates more jobs, and said that computer technology bas opened a wide range of employment op- portunities. In addition be said, \The robot creates wealth without humans having to do the work, 11 and felt that mon- tonous and hazardous jobs should belong to the · robot. General Electric has recently focused on robot development. Professor Sclunee felt that automation is not a fad and students will learn skills in the I.A.M. that will be lasting. As Professor Scbmee pointed out, \You will have failed as an educator if you do. not teach skills that Will be useful in years to come.\ Union's Special Circ·le K ByKATHIZUCKERMAN The CirCle K Club attended the 21st annual New York District Convention in Rochester on March 25th-27th. The two main purposes of this convention were to elect a new N.Y. District Board of Officers and to present awards to the outstanding Circle K Clubs · throughout the state. Union College walked away with the show: Past Secretary Cathy Good was presented with The Club Reporting Award, which is given in recognition of outstanding club minutes. This award also named Good the number one secretary in the state-an honor well deserved. Union also marched away with ·2nd place in Total Achievement, making them one of the most successful Circle K Clubs in the state. Past President Kathi Zuckerman was presented with The Distinguished President's Award, given to the top nine presidents in the state; Also, as a result of this convention, two Union Circle K'ers were elected to proceed on to the N.Y. District Circle K Board. Past President Kathi Zuckerman and Past Vice President Mark Sta_gewill stay on as a successful team; Zuckerman as Lieutenant Governor of the · Capital Division ·of the N.Y. District Circle K and Sage as her Administrative Assistant. The Union College Circle K Club, rechartered in 1978, is part of an international organization devoted to the service of others. Through campus and community ac- tivities, Circle K 'ers raise money and. give other aid to those less fortunate or simply those who ask for it. Circle K'ers work with local high school key clubs and neigh- boring Kiwanis clubs on projects ranging frotn dance marathons to funfairs to much, much more! Besides providing se~ice, Circle K'ers establish strong bonds of friendship and important leadership skills through these projects. Upcoming events include a 12 Hour Campus Wide Dance Marathon to raise money for The Muscular Dystrophy Association. This marathon will take place from Friday, April 8th at 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Saturday morning, April 9th at the Alumni Gym. Refreshments will be served and the campus is in-vited to dance, watch and party with the Circle K'ers!

• I)' Page 8 Founded at Union College 1877 ----~------ ----------- A Long Climb Constantly exhausted from climbing the three flights of stairs to this office, the staff of Ooncordiemis has finally been confronted with an appealing idea. An attractive, spacious and efficient student center is a concept whose time has come.

With those thoughts go the usual considerations one has to deal with in making a· decision about moving from the campus grounds into the streets of Schenectady. rea sou There are many legitimate reasons for moving off campus. S'ome students move off because their financial stQtus dictates that they do so. With increasing donn costs, there is a need to find an inexpensive place to live. There is certainly no question that in the majority of cases, an off-campus apartment or house is significantly less expensive than a donn. If cost does not play role in one's decision, there are other factors that do so. Many people are dissatisfied with the environment the dorms possess~ In a word, they're cold. Cinder block or plaster walls along with assembly line furniture and harsh fluorescent lighting are hardly the ideal living conditions for most people. It is difficult to create a homey atmosphere in a place put together in such a manner. The feeling of transiency is almost impossible to eliminate. An apartment or house off-campus can be just like a home if one is willing to put the effort into it. A lack of kitchen facilities in many of the dorms only emphasizes this point. problems A problem almost every person experiences in the donn from the first day he or she moves in as a freshman is the lack of privacy, for themselves, their actions, and thoughts. (I'm talking about the grapevine.) Also, having to brush your teeth and showering with four or .five other people is not the most enjoyable pastime for many.

Freshman applicants touring the facilities are disillusioned by the dingy, confining edifice that will most likely become the focal point of their social lives should they choose to attend Union.
