Eloquence is not alone an array of words and phrases, the weight of argument, a.nd the finish ofrhetoric; I but the whole soul beaming in the eye and animating every gesture,as if the orator were bore along on the resist- less current of his lofty conceptions- this is true eloquence. Some would- be orators, judging of the intensity of the flame from the crackle and s1noke, imagine that the secret of eloquence lies in the muscles of the arn1 and the vocal cords. How they howl and shriek and swell with a tempest of bo1nbastic fury! But we feel when the storm has passed, that nothing has been struck. \Montes laborant, 1zascitur rediculus 1nus.\ Eloquence cannot be forced, it must be spontaneous. Herein lies the difference between it and rhetoric. 1 Rhetoric is prepared for the occasion, eloquence springs from the occasiQn; rhetoric often deserts us when most needed, eloquence never comes save when it is needed. When the time for prompt and vigorous action is at hand, when measures of vital impor- tance are pending, when liberty gasps and justice shrieks-then ring out the clarion tones of heaven-born Till the spell is destroyed by your c1amoroHs prayer And the dread vision fades from the dark wizard eloquence. \The voice of Mirabeau was heard even above the shouts of nations, and one such thunderbolt as stream.

Statesmen study politics of Solon and Pericles; his- torians consult Herodotus, Thucydi- des and Xenophon; warriors follow the marches of Miltiades, 'fhemisto- , cles and Alexander; orators imitate Pericles and :Oetnosthenes, philoso- phers learn of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle; poets model after Homer, Sappho and Sophocles, and artists work after Phidias. The two principal states of Hellas, Sparta and Athens, furnished exam- ples of the two great forms of govern- ment, democratic and aristocratic, and throughout their lives exhibited the virtues and faults of each. 'Taking warning from their misfortunes, future nations have in great measure shunned both extremes, and extracted from both forms their advantageous fulness of their writings, and Thucy- dides,the first philosophical historian. Of the poets ofall ages, florrter stands prominent iD: epic fame '; the 1 yrical pieces of Sappho, Alcaeus, 1\nacreon and Pindar are unexcelled in beauty; Tyrtaeus is a good exponent of the elegaic style ; and the tragedies· of Sophocles} Aeschylus and Euripides in their awe-inspiring majesty and sublimity, surpass the productions of every age.

Upon that gorgeous canvas of my mind There breathes the living image of a face, A type wherein my calmer eye can find, Truth, virtue, beauty, writ in one sweet grace. And ever in those lights and shadows there, I mark tbe model of some Grecian art, The chiseled brow, the dressing of the hair, The eyes d()wn-cast and lips that life impart. Would sbe live twice, once in her own fair time, And once when beauty's beauty hath decayed? Then glide into my muse and touch my rhyme With something of thy noble soul, sweet maid ! And tbou shalt see, when age impairs thy brow, The reflex of those charms that know thee now. --A :Fresh was caught in tl:e act of kissing his girl good night by the fair dan1sel's mother. He don't go there any n1ore. The student does not return to college with the same feelings as those with which he left it before the excitement and pleasures of Christmas and New Year. The long vacation with its round of gayeties- theatres, dances, skating, New Year's calls, etc., instead of inspiring· him with vigorous thoughts and lofty as- pirations leave rather a void behind,. and he returns to his task with lan- guor and unrest, with a regretful longing for past joys, mingled, how- ever with the thought that such a feeling is unmanly, that he must lay aside all other aims and desires now except study and success. Let us, one and all, tnake \ Study and Success \ our motto for the new year. It can- not fail of reward if we keep it before us and heed it faithfully. To many of us Christmas at College has come for the last time, and the dangerous gulf of the great world yawns at our feet. Successful study prepares us to enter this gulf and to struggle man- fully with its storms. And what of those who remain longer than this year t Shall they wait and adopt the motto next year? By no means. Long training giyes the greatest skill, and the sooner in his course the student begins to pursue a steady course to- ward success, the more successful will he be at the close.

6z THE CONCORDIENSIS. - - - - - We cannot understand why the Senior class holiday should he placed just before C-on1mencement. It 1nust be given to the Seniors not merely as a mark of distinction, but for some definite advantage to them ; and it has always been understood that it is to enable them to prepare their numerous essays, orations, etc., for the graduating stage. Falling, as it has hitherto done, in April, it has been very useful ; but this. year the authorities have for some reason post- poned it to June. Now,. how do they expect men to write essays in June which tnust be handed in by the I st of May? Nor can those. who get on the stage put off the preparation of their orations to a week or so before Com1nencement. The holiday at such a time is worse than useless. Instead of having. an opportunity for going home, and enjoying Easter-tirpe with the homefolks after the hard Second Term's work, the Seniors will now have to keep right on, and when the bright summer days cnme, and the best period of college life begins, they vvill be 1 ea.ving. 'Ihere is not so much work and exciten1ent during Commencement week as to require two or three weeks of rest before ... ately upon leaving college, but there: is. scarcely one out of fifteen \vho. would do this anyhow. Holiday 1n. June compels S,eniors to do one of· three things, each of which is very· undesirable. They \vill either wan-. der aimlesly around college waiting· for con1mencemcnt; or go home and. have trouble of coming back again ; . or, what is still worse, go and not. come back at . all, and so miss the. pleasure of seeing their class graduate· and of uniting with them in the clos-. i1~g ·scenes. We sincerely hope that the former arrangen1ent will stilL hold. We regret very much to see that: the chapel choir is not getting on as. sn1oothly as at first. Now and then no organist appears, and there is of· course no singing for that morning:. Then again there is no \veekly re-. hearsal, and in consequence, the choir either sings ~11 the old~ familiar: pieces over and over, or else breaks. down in attempting some new tune. N.ow we think the first mistake was, n1ade in appointing Friday afternoon, for the time of reb ear sal ; for· the various class-meetings, declama-. tions, base ball games, the Senior hand; and what do m.en care fo-r this prayer-meeting, and other innumer-. short holiday when they are about to, able little engagements which are have a few n1onths 0f idle.ness.

We \vould strongly advise therefore that the choir hold a meetin.g immediately,elect a leader, if they have none at present, and ap- point some time in the middle of the w·eek for practice. It would also be a good idea to have two oro-anists b ' in order that when the regul'1r one is absent we may not be left without our music. Our present Reading-room is an in1provement on the former one, but a little care would make it much more convenient and comfortable. In the first place the benches are uncouth and tiresome things to sit on,and the reading-roo1n above all places should be provided with easy chairs, even if they should have to be taken fron1 recitation rooms. The books also ' ' \vhich are still in the old roon1, such as cyclopedias, dictionaries, etc., ought to be placed in the new room, where they ·will be convenient for reference. But the greatest improvement which could be 1nade would be to have some orderly arrangement of the numerous periodicals which lie piled up on a narrow little desk. 'The newspapers all are nicely placed on file, and the exchanges of the CoN- CORDIENSIS are kept on a desk apart frotn other papers, but the remaining periodicals are lost in a confused heap of miscellaneous n1atter. Could we not have a larger desk or table, and the papers so systematically arranged that we may be able to find what we want without wasting all our time in digging it up? Nearly every student in the college who did not take part in the remov- ing of the walk, and many \vhose class rank has always been very high have received notice from the Regis- trar stating that they are on proba- tion. Of course, out of the seventy- five sent, some went to n1en who had been guilty of doing injury to college property, but in more instances thi$ \vas not the case. Imagine a student who has always conducted himselfin a becoming manner and taken a high class rank, teceiving such a notice ; then imagine him reading it over a dozen tin1es and then calling on some friend to help him n1ake out what the idea is that it is intended to convey, and you have the case of the average upper-classn1an at the tin1e of receiv-- ing the following notice : \In consequence of the considera- tion of the standing of students and of connection with injury to college property, you are hereby notified that you are upon probation, subject to such penalties as may be ordered by the Faculty or Corporation.\

Now for a glance at several papers which we are behind hand with, as it was certainly our duty to have noticed then1 sooner. enterprise,. that it does not account for the increase in college patronage. Is there not an awakening? ·One bad crop year cannot seriously retard the tide of prosperity which sets so strongly and steadily to our shores.\ This is g-ood news, brothers .of the JJ;tirror, and we rejoice heartily \vith you that there is ,., an avvakening \in the .:south, especially in Educat-ion. Other interesting articles are \~ ... emale Labor in the South,\ \Ren1iniscences of Miss Hall,\ ''Rosalind Young,'' etc. No\v we will not assume the province of determining whether a coUege paper should be filled with topics of g-eneral interest written hy outsiders, but in the present instance it has made the J11irror very readable to anyone, while college papers are too often of local interest on 1 y. Still it is not well to over-do the matter, and we would ddvise our brothers of the JJ;Iirror to obtain as many sub- scriptions fron1 students as Jiossible, and to cut short a little ou tlide sub- scribers. '[hey have our best wishes and \ve shall always welco1ne the JVJz\rror at our sanctum. -As we lay aside the lvlirror and take up the Nassau Literary .J..~!faga­ zz'1le it is hard to realize that they: are both exponents of college life and thought-difference between them is so great.

Its claims are numer- ous but we will mention two only, viz. : it is one of our few southern exchanges, and it is really a good paper--in our opinion far better than many of 1nuch n1ore pretentious ap- pearance. In typo__sTaphical appear- ance the Mirror differs from our northern college journals, being a regular eight-page news-paper, in- stead ofhaving the magazine form, or an approach to it, like most of our papers. This feature we rather like, though a little smaller paper and rnore pages would be better, we think ; for its present form is· very unhandy for binding. The Mirror devotes the usual space to Locals, Persouals, Col- lege Gossip, Editorials, etc., but it is the Literary, Miscellaneous and Ex- tract departments that especially please us. Each of those is first rate -in fact some of the articles are capital, and if written by students would reflect great credit on Emory College. At any rate such selections are an honor to the editors. One article speaking of the south, says : \We are sure that while the inflow of northern capital may account for · much of what is bright i$n the picture of the new impetus given to southern , suffer no wrinkle from the mail bag, and its subject 1natter fulfills one's expectations.

In the Acade11zic of Cincinnati U ni- versity vve read the following criticism I of our paper : '' rfhe Concordiensis evinces its strong attachment to base- ball playing by assigning a special column for notes upon this subject and classing this column among the departments of the paper. Moreover the management of this division is intrusted to the literary editor in order to secure that attention de- manded by such a theme. The lit- erary departlnent proves very inter- esting reading, especially from the fact that it is made up entirely of· articles written by J an1es A. G-arfield for the lif/illia1ns Quarterly, at the tin1e when he vvas one of the editors of the papers as well as an able con- tributor.\ As the Acadcnzica is in its second year only we can harldy ex- pect it to be as good as older papers; still WE? find much that is pleasant.
