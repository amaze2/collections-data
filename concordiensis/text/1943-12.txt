He received his educa- tion at Harrow and Trinity Col- lege, Cambridge, and is now a fel- low of the University of London. Before the war, he was Professor of Russian literature, language and culture at the Universities of Lon- don and Liverpool. He is now Di- rector of the School of Slovanic \nd Eastern European Studies. He has been a member of the Univer- odty of M0scow, and, dur-ing the last war, was attched to the Rus- sian armies. Subsequent to the Rus- sian defeat in 1917, he became a member of the staff of His Maj- t•sty's Ambassador to Petrograd. During the period between the two •,vars, he made annual trips to Rus- sia, contributing articles to the ::\!!anchester \Guardian.\ He has written several books on Russia. An interpretation of Sir Bernard's · speech follows: Our Accord with Russia Representatives of Two i!aiths Disc:tt§S ReBigioMs toleration in Both Places Representatives of the Protestant and Jewish faiths will together occupy the pulpit of the Memor:al Chapel, Sunday morning at the 11:00 service. The speaket·s will discuss the problem of religious te>lerance in a democmcy. The Jewish speaker will be Mr. George Z. Medalie, former assistant dis- tiict attorney for New York City, U. S. Attorney for the southem dis- tl\ict of New York, who is engaged in private practice of law and President of the Federation for the support of Jewish Philanthropic Societies in New York City. He has held many offices in state. county and city bar associations. intensive drills in both defensive and offensive strategy stressing t~amwork and also individual play. Coach Perkins announced this week the names of the candidates who have been chosen on the seven tentative squads, from the first three of which will be chosen the quintet which will face the steam- roller Faculty Five next Thursday afternoon in the Alumni Gym- nasium. \It should be understood,\ em- phasized Jess, \that these team mrangements are strictly tempor- ary, and by no means will deter- mine the starting five who will meet the Sampson quintet in the opener on January 7. I have chosen these temporary teams from the players who looked good in only one week's practice, and there will undoubtedly be some changes made in the lineups as practice goes on.\ Those named on the first teams are listed as follows: Jst Team F.

Enoch, the I scintillating Light. and his satellite, .:'.liss Leslie James. and lesser stel- lar figures will p10vide the music for the evening's entertainment, which will cease at approximately 1 a. m. Sunday. ,Due to the early termination of the dance, fewer couples are expected to attend Sun- day Chapel in even-ing dress.

Ac- <'ording to the last 1·eports from the t irket salesmen, the dance has re~ C'~vied stron~ support in recent hours, and is expected to go over the top. Russia. after this war, will be in a similar position in regard to Si- beria as the United States was in 1 egard to the western frontier in this country's early years. Buried in the soil of Siberia are many of the 1aw materials required by the modern industrial state. Russia w!ll have to have help in this ex- pansion. She can choose between P.ngland and America, or Germany. Her choice is obvious. Russia owes a lot to a small group of technical <'Xperts who put her on a firm in- dustrial footing. The United States has had relatively unruffled rela- lions with Russia. During the last ~;; years, En~land has had five t•·eaties with Russia. It was in- <leed far-sighted of America to have opened relations with Soviet :lussia as early as 1933. The Protestant speaker will be Vlrillard Johnson, asssistant to the President of the National Confer- ence of Christian and Jews. He was at one time Dean of men at Drake University. He is an ordain- ing minister of the Congregational Church and the leader of the Des Moines Public Forum. VVill Also Sp<>ait on Town Meeting These two speakers will be joined by a third, representing the Cath- olic chmch to speak at the Empire State Town Meeting in the Old Chapel on the Union campus Sun- day afternoon from 1:30 to 2:00. Raymond T. King, an attorney of Springfield, Massachusetts, former- ly Corporation Counsel of that city, 1s a prominent Roman Catholic lay- man and will add the view of Roman Catholicism to the discus- sion. The subject will be \Unity of Effort of Three Faiths.\ The general public is invited both to the service in Memorial Chapel in the morning and the Empire State Town Meeting in the Old Chapel in the afternoon.

Causes of 1917 Fiasco A fm·m of government founded during the reign of Peter the Great had deteriorated, in the course of 1ime, into the worst government l~::mginable. Adding to the chaos was the Tsar himself. Weak in purpose, easily swayed by the am- bitious Tsarina, and under the in- fluence of the enigmatic Rasputin, the Tsar was no man for the job before him. The weakness in the govrenment was reflected in the Army. Badly :<•1pplied in arms and food, this flrmy fought a valiant, though los- ing battle. It has been estimated that the Russian Army was de- !'\royed three times in World War r. Each time it was rebuilt, only to be routed again. The regiment to which Sir Bernard was attach- <'d was composed of 4,000 men. Forty men and one officer survived. And so it went, total losses mount- ing to nearly 4,000,000 men.

The paper is published by the college, and stndrnts w1·.iting for the paper do so on sufferance from the coBege. This condition has existed for several months. and was pubJ.icly announc- ed· by President Fox early this term in Chapel. However, the an- nouncement was so we!l confused by our excellent president's flow- ing rhet01 ic, that few students re- alized its importance. The change :n management of the paper has not been accompanied by any bene- ficial effects, but has in fact seri- ously harmed the quality and use- fulness of the paper. Quite apart from the reasons the college gave for assuming responsibility for the Concordy, it has done an extreme- ly poor job of management from the beginning, and the situation has deteriorated steadilv. It is natural and desirable for men to take pride in the history or their fo1•ebears, whether they be of their own immediate blood or of a group, lilte a coliege or country, to which they belong. Such pride maltes Jlor self-confidence and, in the more thoughtful, develops a sense of responsibility, to l!le wor- thy of such an inheritance. In ex- treme cases it may become snob- bishness· or such a perversion of fact as the Nazi claim that they are the master race. Times were tarbulent, and their desire to found a college was un- heeded; the same was true of other petitions until, in 1785. they satis- fied themselves by the establish- ment of an aciDdemy. ~1.\l'iAta:\(; IIUA!Ul I.ymmt (;, !'otter, 19!G .................. r. s. s. !'.hi (·;ll'IIl'ltl!l lh•llll-:1-u2211 ...... ..

When, as a young boy, I first read about it, I got the impression that it had been a series of victories and that the American navy had swep1. the British off the seas. The facts, of course, are much different; and now that we are a great power, our pride does not need this false stimulus. Hardly a clay has gone by in the past month without someone asking us if we were going to the lnterfmtemity Ball. \Ve are. We hope you are too. We went to last year's \lnterfratemit~·\, and we1·e very much depressed b,v the whole thing. The attitude at the time was that \this is the last for the dumtion\. But to- molTO\\' night in the Gym we are going· to have another Interfraternity Ball. There are no house parties this year, and we don't have aHy football game to sit and be thril!l'd by. Hut we have the dance. To those who grumble and gr,oan about the lack of another night of fun anrl frolic, \\'e merely say there's a wm· on. \Yith the ad- vent of the ma,gic house of He1· arrival. the wm· will be forgotten, we hope completely, for a few hours at least. The1·e will be a prepondemnce of unifo1·ms present; the theme of the Ball is nautinll. But all t'his cannot dampen the enthusiasm of this dance. \\'e will all be there for the same reason : we are the present men .of l'uion; and for the same purpose: to have a good time, all 250 of us. To Reggie Carroll and the committee, hats off fot· a swell job; to our guests however fair and from however far, glad to have you auoard; to Enoch Light. welcome back to l'nion; to those who we1·e g-iven \the beam\ better luck next date. Om BaH this year is smaller· than the tra- ditional l'nion \Interfraternity\. But the spirit at the dance is no more nor less than what we put there. Some hardy souls have threatened to pitch tents on Lihmry Field in lieu of a room for their dates. Others have acquit·ed hiking shoes for the week- encl. So what if the old-fashioned luxuries areu'1. to be had? \Ve don't especially like it either, but let's not let a little walking ruin this dance. · Let's not let anything spoil it. The effect on the student edi- tcr!al staff has been to remove from them any real incentive to produce a really good paper. From the college has come no worth- while constructive criticism, and much that was destructive. The at- titude of the college authorities has been such as to destroy stu- dent initiative on the paper. Not only has the college not done anything to maintain the standards of The Concordiensis, but. by allowing divided authority Ill exist, has essentially destroyed the usefulness of the paper as an ~xpression of student opinion. Last term divided authority on the paper !tad serious repercussions in the mm ale of the whole student body, ns a result of the implied dissen- ;;ion in a paper which was two pa- pers. one civ·ilian and one Navy. That you may know more fully ·why Union men take pride in their college, I am writing, at the re- quest of the editors of the Con- cordiensis, these short sketches of our history. I shall seek to a void the exaggerations I found in those old school-books, for Union is now so old and so rich in honorable service that there is no need to gild the truth. The college Is a child of the American Revolution. The victory at Saratoga led the settlers in this area, which was then a frontier, to plan a college where their chil- dren might ·be trained to play a role in the new nation which they were sure would arise from the battlefields, It was in 1779 that they sent their first petition to the Revolutionary State Assembly. WANTED I •• ACTION This term the college has made an attempt to keep the censorship of the paper in the hands of a single individual appointed by the college. Supposedly he is complete- ly responsible for what is printed. In practice, however, the students are still held responsible by other people. In particular have those ·r.embers of the staff belonging to The role of the Editorial writer is some- times filled to the brim with pleasantness, and other times it is utterly devoid of all characteristics of interestedness. This week is an example of the latter. From all outward appearances, peace reigns at l!nion College. Whatever campus fig-ht~ there ma,'l· be seem pretty well covel ed up. Prexy hasn't perpetrated any nefarious deeds whose repurcussions amounted to anything. Nobod:-· seems to be doing anything· this week except rest up for the dance. ·we like to see eve1·yone have a good time at the Inte1·fratemity Ball, but we also like to see people doing things around campus. E\·en the Scuttlebutt is devoid of news. \\'on't some of you erstwhile men pull off a job of some kind? We're not especially particular what it is-anything from stealing the pillars on the Chapel to changing the color on the Idol will do. We are beginning to think that wm·-time supervision has de- stroyed whatever vestiges of initiative there used to be amund here. Somebody do something, please. a certain un-nameable- grou.p been subjected to an indirect but pow- erful censorship by persons com- pletely unauthorized. The questions before us now are: Will the college make an honest at- tempt to restore to the students S'.;me pride in their newspaper by making it possible fot· them to edit it themselves. subject only to such censo1 ship as is indispensable to tne general weltare: ~ill the col- lege cease its destructive ctiticism and offer something constructive; and will the college take the steps necessary to protect the paper and the members of the staff from the indirect coercion which now ter- rorizes them, at least in part? NEWEST ADDITION What all this amounts to, in short, is this: Will the college as- sert its sole and complete author- ity and responsibility for the pa-. per, or will it continue to destroy 'l'he Concordiensis by weak and vacillating supervision? We are very happy to have in this is·sue an mticle on the past of Pni'on CcJllege by Dr. Charles :r-.;. Waldron, '06, Alumni Secre- tary of the College. We hope to have more stories of a similar nature in future issues. lk \\'alrlron is well known to those stu- dents who attended Union before for his talks in Dail;-.· Chapel. We hope that more and more students will come to kno\\' him as time passes, for he more than any other man is the spirit of Union College. He has served the college long and faithfully, and has steeeped himself in the lore of the past, lm·e which otherwise would have long since been forgotten, which but for him \vould exists only in musty old tomes in the more hidden recesses of the Library. Anyone who associates with ·Chal'ley Waldron cannot help s~::nsing the great love he has for Union, nnrl cannot help catching- a little of his spirit. SHADES OF DEMOSTHENES tempt to state dogmatically that certain I opinions of his are absolutely right; he pro- posed them only as his own opinions. Paul F. Yergin. Patronize Concordie Advertisers However, the urge for a college continued and fmally on Feb. 22, 1795, .the newly establlshed Board of Regents granted to us their first college charter, and with its sign- ing the acRdemy became the new college. The leaders in this suc- cessful petition were the Dntch Reformed clergyman, the Re\. Dr. Theodoric Romeyn, and General Philip Schuyler.

No words at the time had a more honorable meaning, for the nation had just achieved union through the efforts of the fighting men of thirteen separate states, and the recently established na- tional government was the triumph of their political union. The word stood for the spirit that had made our country possible, and the thought of the foundet·s was ex- pressed in the motto on the col- lege sea.J. where in a border sur- rounding the hand of the Goddess of Wisdom, we read. \We are all brothers under the laws of Min- erva.\ We wish to congratulate the administra- tion for bringing Sir Bernard Pares to l'nion to give the first Ichabod Spencer Lecture for this year. Sir Bemard gave what is un- doubtedly one of the most worthwhile speeches heard here in a long time. Not only was his talk extremely fascinating, his grasp of his subject complete, but he did not at- Timely topics treated by competent orators haYe been very infrequent at Union in the recent past.

Thus it is that on Saturday night the pres- ent chapter, along with its almuni and other brothers from near and tar wHl gather at the Hotel Van Curler for a celebration marlting fifty years of fellowship. Promptly at 6:00 p.m. the festivities will be- gin, with Cecil J. Wilkinson, the executive secretary of the ft·ater- nity, and Joseph 'R. Brown, Jr .. TTnion, '03, as speakers, and Dr. Walter C. Langsam as toastmaster. \ Recalling the circumstances of the organization of the group, Ed- v.>in V. R. Payne, '95, one of the charter members, writes: \Brother Frank S. Hoffman, Knox '73, profes- sor of Philosophy, 1885-1917, was approached by Emmet Sloat, '94, and Nathan Beckwith, '94, and he encouraged them to get a select ;<TOUp of men and he would endorse them to the proper officers of the national fraternity for a Union <. hapter. The men they asked were Robert Van Buesekom, Jr., '94; I:>~dgar Brown, James A. Collins, Frederick M. Eames, James M. Cass, Edwin Van R. Payne, Class of 1895; J.

He is Chairman of the Student Finance Committee, formerly the Student Tax Com- mittee. During the spring of 1893, rep- resentatives of the national fra- ternity visited the campus to inves- tigate the prospective chapter, and, after careful scrutiny, the group v;;as given to understand that it had their approval. One of these men was Frank Keck of New York City who. after making his report, stayed on to help the new chapter get its start. He was in charge of the first initiation, which was held in the Edison Hotel, then Schenec- tady's leading hostelry. Following the ceremony, a banquet was held in an adjoining room of the hotel, and thus Union's twelfth fraternity started on its course. 1 • , . 0 na va 1 • , _ • • In civilian life he was the director The results of the Pearl Harbor • ramees at Cmon compnsed the • A tesene of $1o0 ts bemg held f . . h :!\1 h d Day War Bond Drice which toolr ;.:sible audience for the broadcast I for any emergency expenditures,!' ~t : t::mt~g sc ~ 0 : 1 at -.ore Kea 'Jlace from Dec. 1 to 'Dec. 7, have , which featured a. short talk by ; f!nd any new activities.

In 1906, it became evident that the chapter must owh its own house in order to meet the com- petition and to provide a suitable home for its members. On June 22, 1906, Chi Association, the local alumni association, which still owns the chapter house, was incorporat- ed, with its purpose \to erect a house for the Fraternity of Phi namma Delta at Union College, and to maintain the frjendships in the fraternity.\ The Association was fortunate in having as its forst president Dr. Charles P. Stein- metz, the electrical wizard, who, as a member of the Union faculty, had previously been made a mem- ber of the fraternity. The site of the house, owned by the college, was considered one of the best on the campus, and was secured by Dr. Steinmetz who, legend says, lhreatened to resign from the fac- ulty when the site was first re- fused to the undergraduate mem- bers of the association. The group finally obtained the site, however, r.nd, after ground was broken in June, 1907, the building was com- pleted and ready for occupancy in 1908. In 1921 it was brought to its present size when the dol'mitory was added, in memory of Brother Roy Schuyler, who died in action in World War I. The defeat was r!'garded as a ('hi!rud.

Of late the Concordiensis has been ac- cused b~· somE' people of being \merely a pawn in the lmnds of the adntinistt·ation.\ We feel that the readers of the paper de- serw to be enlightened on the subject. a:s we know, no article has been so treated. 'v\\ha tever censorship exists is .solely to pl'O- tect the g·eneral \·elfare and is exercised only after the papel' appears. We've never been quite a'ble to a·pproach the depths Pegler occu- pies, 'but we have made a practice from the beginning of criticizing everything that met our eye, pro- vided of course WP could get away with it. Rarely have we offered sug-gestions for the improvement of campus matters; instead we ,have men'lY found the weak points and have attacked from that an~;Je. To start 1•olling om· new cam- paign of constructive sug-gestions, we're going to ha,rk ,back to that old dispute of participation in ac· tivities by the Naval trainees. Par- ticipation by the tminees had in- creased t1·emendously since the Tlw fina.l accusation is that the Concordi- ensi~ is no longer the free outlet for student opinion that it used to be. :\lay we call at- tention to the fact that the criticisms them- seln>s were printed on these pages, in fact days of the \great dispute\ but we feel that there is still a great deal in an adjacent column of this pag-e, and were of untapped talent. not \blue-pencilled\ out of existence. The ~he principal agrument of the . . . . . tramees was that they had very good of all. This panther saw the dam and saw that it was different. He didn't like it because it wasn't lilie the dams all the other beavers had built. Maybe he was jealous. He 'became very angry anyway, and de- cidE'd l:le would build a bigger and bette1· dam. This he started to do. And after a while the dam kept getting more and more like the little beaver's. Tl:le little beaver was worried. He !mew the panther and his friends were up to something. He didn't know what to do, for the panther had always been in the woods and since the lions and elephants had gone away, thPy thought them- selves to be kings of the woods. He knew the little stream was not big enough for two dams. Oh, he was worried. He knew he was right, :but he wasn't very strong.

DOOR One important factor in Sunday Chapel services is the great publicity value to the College. This is probabl~· one of the most importnnt reasons for its existence. How- evel', we wonde1· if the College l'Ntlizes the loss of g·ood-will in the City caused by the fact that the college chapel service comes at eleven o'clock. thus competing· with local church~s. It is said, with some truth. that in some churches in Schenect~ld~· half the congregation deserts its own church when an outstanding speaker is appearing at the college. This is not good pulilicit;v for the college. and is not becorning to the colleg·e's pos'ition in the community. Fol' one thing·, not only would the good- will of local pastors be regained, but there is little doubt that they themselves would like to hear the men who speak and many more of their congregations would feel free i to attend. From the students' point of view,\ the change would be greeted with approval,, because it would mean that on the only j' fn•e moming .of the week they could sleep as late as the;; wished. To some it would: mean that they could attend their own i chu1·ch services, and still not miss the college: chapel sen·ice. which we feel is a vital part of enr~· student's college experience. While; it might be possible to have the service broadcast, \Ve would suggest that it would be better if it were not, and if it were con- ducted on a less formal basis or if at least pmt of the meeting- were brought out of the clouds down to the level of somewhat agnos- tic o1· even Q·nical students. -P.

The dance will be informal, and will cost $1.10 as at previous informal dances.

The raving beauty to be so honored will be selected from among conte>Jtants who will be young ladies escorted to the dance by students or guests The committee on selection has not yet been chosen, but it is hoped, Klar- man stated, to collect a bevy of connoisseurs of female pulchritude such as has never before been as- sembled within the hallowed gray wails of Union College.

As Christmas creeps up on us, in the bustle uf ad-interim marks, \Ve suddenly realize that fo1· some, the colleg-e life has just ended. But for many, this mm·ks the real beginning of their lives at LYnion, for now they ,.,.ill have an official scholastic standing- for the fi•rst time. The more conventional meaning- of Christ- mas remains foremost in our minds today, though. We ought not to forget \\'hat the season mea.ns. It is the time of \Peace on Earth, Good \\'ill to men\. This seems at first an anoma.ly in om· present situation, but afte1· all, what else nre we intent upon, for what else are we fighting'? We seem to have deserted the Christmas ideal fo•· a time. yet we nrust not let om·selves forg·et it. We must take adv<mta.ge of every opportunity which offers to renew our faith in the real v~dues. Above all, let us not confuse our minds with petty and trivial grievances. If we are inclined to wish for a longer vacation, let us remember those for whom there is no vacation, whose vigilance must be unceasing. lt is they who make it possible for us to have even these few days. Or let us remem- ber those for whom there will never again be any vacations, who will never again hear the strains of the Christmas music. They have made it possible fol' us to live, and to enjoy this season. We must not spare our- selves, when they did not spare themselves on our behalf. Peace on Earth, Good Will to Men, is not a condition of world affairs. It is an attitude in our own minds. Let each of us accept this holiday spirit wholeheartedly, and keep the world alive for the waJJderers who are at the ends of the earth at bitter, terrible tasks. THE GRASS LEAVES Thirty Navy V-12 Trainees from Union College were entertained last weekend by the girls of Green Mountain Junior Collge, Poultney, Vt. The high spot of the occasion was a :formal dance held in the college gymnasium on Saturday eve- ning. The majority of the men arrived during the late after11oon, a:t which lime they were shown to their rooms by thei-r dates. The \Moun- taineers\ College Store, seemed to be the greatest attraction before the dance, an it was here that the week-end's .festi·vlties started with Jallons of \coke\ and a \juice\ box. The dance took pla:ce from Zl.OO Llntil 2400. The gym was tastefully decorated with an abundance of ct·epe paper and symbolic of angels. Music was supplied by an orchestra ft·om Troy -to whose tunes men in blue and girls in white glided over t!:>e floor. During the dance refresh· ments were served in the dining room at Ames Hall, one of the women's domitories. On Sunday, Trainees and their dates were seen in the churches of Poultney and about the cam- pus. At mid-afternoon the men started to leave and Green Moun- tain Junior College slowly regained its normal hue. Trainees from Middlebury, Dart- mouth, and R.P.I. also attended. ----0---- CALENDAR Friday, Dec('Jnber 17 7·30-Speaking of Books, \Wenches with Wrenches\ by Elizabeth Hall, Old Chapel, WGY. i'laturday, December 18 8:15-Philomathean Debate with Colgate, \International Police Force,\ Silliman Hall.

NEW ALUMNI This week the pre-medical term ends, and as it ends many of our friends and class- mates leave, for the Army, Navy, and .1.\Iedi- cal schools. We bid them farewell now, re- alizing that it will be onl~· a short time until we omselves w.ill be departing from this place. We wish them good luck, \vho leave l'nion at this Christmas season, remember- ing anothe1· group who left us just a ~·ear ago, at the first commencement under the ac- celerated program. They are scattered far and wide, as are most Union Alumni, but they are always bound by the memories of the years spent together by the side of the \brook that bounds\. It might almost be ap- prorpriate to say here, to our departing fel- lows, \morituri te salutamus.\ But that would ue morbid. Let us rather plagiarize Dr. Kellogg and say \ave atque vale\. Lest e-m~· wonder, that means \see you in khaki\. WHAT DO YOU THINK? The principal idea of the Naval Organiza- tion class is. to acquaint the \'-12 men at l'nion with rustoms and procedm·es in our ::\<tvy. Aside from straig~ht lectures on these topics a lot could be learned from men who have been on Fleet duty telling of their pel'- ~onal experiences as reg-ards Naval opera- tions a.nd ethics. Why not have some of the Fleet men stationed here give a short five or ten minute talk on subjects which they are familiar with'! As an added feature to the N~~val Org: class it would help to drive across the points the Navy is trying to make and add a lot of interest for those who are absorbing them. .:.\la,terial for subject matter is practically unlimited as there are men stationed at Union who have .seen duty in the South Pacific, Africa, and many of the other battle- fronts of the world. Such experiences well told would help the Trainee realize something more of the service he has chosen and would educate him in the manner in which things are done in the Navy. Subjects such as task force composition, duty on various types of ships, and naval armament provide an unending source for discussion. There is no need to worry about the matel'ial from a military standpoint as the audience would be composed entirely of Navy men. The idea of having enlisted men give speeches during Naval Org- class has been used at other V-12 Colleges and has been considered successful. Let's give it a try here.

SH-H-H T o help make \all quiet\ on some of the war fran ts-at least as much as possible-General Electric has developed a new sound-level meter that gives a quantitative measurement of sound. Because man's nervous system is severe- ly agitated if he is subjected to a sound above 120 decibels, the efficiency of fac- tory workers is often lowered consider- ably by machinery noise. Highly sensi- tive, the instrument's range of 24 to 120 decibels covers the normal range of man's hearing and warns when the noise is harmful. Thus proper steps can be taken to reduce the sound. The meter can check submarines, too, that they may remain quiet enough to escape enemy vessels-and surface ships and airplanes, for they must be quiet enough to preserve the efficiency of their crews. EAD Measurements can easily be made almost anywhere at any time, for the meter weighs onlv 20 pounds and is portable. YAWN PATROL O N guard again.st over-fatigue of metals is the new electronic ma- chine developed in our General Engineer- ing Laboratory. For metals, like human beings, get \tired\ after a certain amount of work. One of the most important metallurgical tests is determining how much stress and strain certain metals can take under continuous vibration. Energized by especially powerful elec- tronic equipment, the new machine can vibrate a sample of metal back and forth about 10 million times in five hours---or in one-fourth to one-tenth the time pre- viously required.

The announcement of the elections came a short time after the Phi Beta Kappa elections . The new members of the Societ,y include one member of the class of 1943, nine of the class of 1944, and three from the accelerated class of 1945. The roll included f.ive of the six men recently elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Six pre-medics, three PhJ.sics, and four engineering stu- dents were on the list. Robert Henry Barnes, a pre med· ical student of the class of 1944, was Chairman of the .St·udent Tax CommHttee, a member of Delta Phi fraternity, and was elected t0 Phi Beta Ka-ppa. He received the de- gree of Bachelor of Science last week. Several Now in Medical School William Roy Breg, a pre~rnedical student of the class of 1945, came to Union from Texas Christian Uni- versit;y, and ran on the Union cross-country team this year.

As usual the program was written, acted, and produced by members of the Phi Delt platoon. The next program of the weekly sel'ies will be heard this coming Thursday. It wi:ll be presented by E1e Psi Upsilon Ship, As usual, an audience is welcome. The show starts exactly at 1930, and is over at 20QO. New Chief Interviewed UORS continued its practice of interviewing new members of the Naval staff when Chief Ma-rvi,n, the latest addition to the V-12 unit, was questioned about his life history, education, and ancestry. He submitted to the quizzing on Wednesday evening at 1930, imme- diately after the regular weekly news commentary of Mr. Joseph Hotundo. \Remai-ning Standing\ was heard a.s usual Tuesday evening. The guest of the week was Professor Helmer Webb, college librarian. As usual Messrs. Larrabee and Coffin made up the remainder of the board of experts. The highlight of the program came when Mr. Webb pro- duced a slide rule fr0m his pocket to help himself calculate the cost per acre of haircuts! He quickly turned up with the right answer, about $25,000. Robert Brocll:hurst, a premedical student of the class· of 1945, was on the staff of the Idol, the Garnet, and on the 'Swimming team.

(Continued on Page 4) Some of the interesting data about the organ, brought out by Dr. Tidmarsh in his opening re- marks, were that the organ in Memorial Chapel has 2000 pipes, ranging in size from 16 feet down to a few inches long. Forty stops provide a tremendous number of combinations of tones. tEd. note:- the number is 1,099,511,627,776). He then demonstrated some of the ver- satility of the organ by playing the same tone on all three manuals, first at the same place on each manual, then at different octaves on each of the three. He also showed the possibility of playing more than one note by depre~sing a :single ltey, by means of coup- lers. For the musical portion of the program, Dr. Tidmarsh played the \Prelude and Fugue in G Minor\ by Marcel Dupre; \Noel Ecos- sais\ arranged by Guilmant; \Carillon of Westminster\ by Vierne, and finally Franz Schubert's \Ave Maria.\
