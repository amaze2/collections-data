I was plodding .along beneath the elms that ling the terrace walk at an hour when only watchtnen and reporters can be seen astir an.d retain their respectability, when I observed a dusky forn1. approaching with weird and measured stride.

He rolled, first upon. one side and then upon the. other; he clutched the bed-clothes in his frenzy, anct seized the pillow -case between his teeth. Then suddenly giving a great lurch be rolle\d co1npletely off the bed, and landed in .the middle of the room, where he was imtnediate~y surrounde9- by his alarmed and anxious friends. ''Thank Heaven!'' he exclaimed as he awoke, mouthed these words : ''A story? Aye! That's a corker feir' a common sort o' man, the likes o' I:ne!\ It was the president of ·the dran1atic club. He saw nte. He stopped. And then I said: . , '' it \Vas only a drea1n. '' Then clearing his throat · he told a painful story, frequently stopping to , mop the perspiration from his agitated brow.

It was with a thrill of pleasure and satisfaction that I recently received the news of Robert C. Alexander's appointment as editor-in-chief of the New York Mai.l and Express, and I take this opportunity for shaking hands over the editorial table, and wishing hirn the same success in the future which has atiended him in the past. It seerns P-articularly fitting that one who now enjoys the privilege of wielding the editorial pen of THE CoN CORDIENSIS should congratulate Mr. Alexander upon juch an occasion, as it was only fifteen years ago that he finished his career as a college jour- nalist upon this same paper, and laid aside the editorial pen to seek other ap.d wider fields of endeavor. The distance from. the unpretentious sanctum of a college journal to the exalted chair of editor-in~chief of a great New York daily seems . a long one to cover in the remarkably short space of fifteen years. 1 deem jt my good fortune to be numbered among the legion of friends who rejoice at the success of ·' Bob'' Alexande1·.

Vainly he called upon the fleeing, leaping '' Schemmy\ not to lea-vH him to b.is fate. \Help help!'' he cried. The snow filled mouth and ears. All the sensations of drowning were his. But when he thought the end had surely come he spied Jim, the copper, with his lame arlll_ in the sling, floundering about n.ear by, \Help me, copper!\ he yelled in .agony. \Go to, go to,\ caine the gru.fi reply; \I can't get out myself 1\ ~ Slowly yet surely poor \Bee\ sank. Ah! it was sad for one so young thus to die! He struggled. He grasped at the air. He kicked-bang! He opened his eyes-not in heavea, but in the a.rrns of loving friends.
