To Our Subscribers MANDOLIN CLUB MEETS FRIDAY NIGHT There will be a meeting of the Mandolin Club Friday at 7.30 P. M., in Silliman Hall. BAND LOSES CAMPBELL; ATTENDANCE STILL SLIM The regula.r weekly band re- hearsall was held Tuesday even- ing at 7 :30 in. Silliman Hall. The organization will greatly feel the need of its president, Francis Campbell '19, who left ~uesday morning for the N ava1 Reserve. Campbell's departure only em- phasized more strongly the need of more men, especially new men, from the Freshman class. The band has now in its possession a slide trombone, two alto horns, a tenor, and a bass for anyone who will furnish the wind for them. Y. M. C. A. TO DISTRIBUTE MAGAZINES; MORE BIBLES William Kennedy still has a few Freshmen hand-books to dis- tribute to those who have not as yet received any.

Ten men of las~ year's band are not in col- lege this year and only four new men have been obtained to fill their places. Tuesday rehearsals at 7 :30 in Silliman Hall will be continued, for a time at least, in the hope that enough men will come out to make it possible for the band to play at the .remaining athletic contests.

In 1915 the Interfraternity Con- ference was formed with the object of p~romoting better feeling among the fraternities, of regulating rushing and of overseeing inter- fraternity functions. There is only one member of last year's confer- ence in college; yet it wo1.1ld be~ easy matter for each fraternity to choose a representative and then have \them organize. The obfect of the conference is threefold as before stated. That the feeling; between fraternities,- although relations ha.vc always been most friendly,-is much bet- ter as a result of the conference is a foreseen conclusion. But in rushing this year the need of the conference was sorely felt. In the first place there was no secreta·ry to keep an account of the Fresh- man and a record of the men pledg-ed. The only report was that made by TnE Co~coRDTF.Nsrs. This \Vas only a minor matter. Rule JV of the By-laws of the In- terfra ternity Conference was broken in at least one case. There were also some minor inf·ractions which mig-ht ha\'e been brought before the Conference for discus- sion. lig-ht, our co11temporary, \The Cor.

The game was very interesting to say the least, yet it is not on this account especially that it ought to be spoken of, but be- cause of the remarkably clean playing and good sportsmanship of the members of both teams.

If the proletariate see a policeman chasing a thief, thek sympathies are with the thief, not because they approve of thievery but be- cause they hate the govennnent, which. the policeman represents. The higher classes, including the upper middle class, are strong supporters of the govern:m.ent, as are the cla;ss of working people who benefit by the government in- surance. The theatres which the Kaiser ostensibly maintains is one of the means employed by the g-ov- ernment to win the favor of its subjects. The government seeks not only to conciliate its sttpport- ers with entertainment and insu r- anee but also to oppress its enemies. No Socialist can hold a goven~ment position nor are the factories which profit by govern- ment contracts supposed to ern- ploy Socialists.

ORIENTAL IDOLIZES LEFTY IN SWOON (From the New York Times.) The front page of a Columbia- Union football game program serving as letter paper, Com- mander Viscount M. Hotta, one of the blockading expec1ition of Port Arthur, and now Naval At- tache to the Japanese Ambassa~or at \Vashington, describes his op111- ion of the Ame1rican game of foot- hall after having seen the contest last Saturday b~tween Union and Columbia at South Field. The'let- ter is in Japanese and was ad- dressed to Mr. Takei, a Columbia student, who translated it into Eng-lish. The letter follows: \\Vashington Oct, 20,1817. \Dear Mr. Takei: After haYing called on you this afternoon I saw the football game of your country, and cannot help expressing my admiration. American spirit is chiefly fostered by team work I have been told, and today I think I could get the idea. \V e have about the same game at our Naval College, Edajima, but lt is almost valueless if compared with the one which I saw this afternoon.
