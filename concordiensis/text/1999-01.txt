The endowment fund more than doubled in the short time since West's arrival. The increase from 110 million dollars to 240 million dollars has opened up the availability for more endowment scholarships for new students. West also worked on the fund- ing for other beautifcations of the campus, such as grounds work and building renewals. At the reception held in his honor; West stated, \It is satisfY- ing to see the campus dev~lop and transfonn and I am privileged to have been a part of the team that made it all possible.\ A replacement for West will be hired after the Vice President has left. President Hull and Daniel Lundquist have begun to set up a search in order to fmd someone who will fill West's place. Accord- ing to West, the College Relations staff will carry on without a Vice President for some time. West's last day working for Union College will be January I 5. Unfortunately for West and his wife, Sidney, his first day at Swathinore is on January 18, leav- ing little time for the two to settle into their new home. Union Col- lege thanks West for all his hard work for the school and wish hirn the best of Juck for his future. by Gina CampaneUa Staff Writer Most of his stories are true and he writes them during what he claims are his \sacred hours,\ 8 AM to lOAM. Jesse Jackson Set to Speak A long time ago storytellers were traditionally paid with food and lodging because their audiences were incredibly grateful for the story and for the enjoyment of a · gathering. ~ese simple items were enough compensation for the sto- ryteller because he enjoyed the opportunity to share his tales. However, soon after these times; modern conveniences like television; radios and air condition- ing began to lure the audiences indoors and away from traditional storytelling. Tllis resulted in the near death of the art of storytelling. For the past few decades there has been a movement to resuscitate the dying art, Jay O'Callahan is credited with being ene of the frrst storytellers to begin this movement. In the beginning of his storytelling career, 0' Callahan re- signed from his position as dean of a private college to pqrsue storytelling as a career. For roughly five years he made an annually salary no greater than ten dollars. Then one day he de- cided to declare himself a profes- sional storYteller. When asked whatthatmeant, he replied, \That means I get paid.\ Now Mr. 0' Callahan makes roughly $1 ()0,000 a year telling his stories about the Northeast that consist of no props or costumes, simply words. Although O'Callahan's stories are all written ahead .of time, he makes it a habit not to memorize lines so they will always sound spontaneous. In a review of one of Mr. O'Callahan's . performanctts,. Alexander Stevens of North Shore Sunday writes, \As practiced by O'Callahan, storytelling is a 'Craft as refmed and subtle as any acting perfonnance. . 0' Callahan embodies each of the characters he conjures up in his stories, often recreating scenes as nimbly and seamlessly as :three ac- tors playing a scene.\ Time .magazine has hailed O'Callahan as a \genius among.the storytellers,\ · O'Callahan wilhoon visit Union College. He is ·gracing the college community with his stories on January 19 at 7:30PM in the Nott Memorial. He will be taking a break frotn his base job as a faculty member at the Lesley Graduate School of Cam- bridge, Massachusetts. While storytelling has become more lucrative, most storytellers do need to, hold down another, more permanent job. The visit by Jay O'Callahan promises to be intriguing and in- teresting, and one not to miss. His belief is that storytelling js a type of music; his most important piece of advice: \Be brave enough. to use silence.\ nered more than seven million by Jim DeWan ter.

Slavery Exhibition Honorable Mention for President by Laureo Thistle Contributi11g JJiri(er On Thursday, Januitlry 14 a dual exhibit exploring the American slave experience will open in the Nott Memorial. This exhibit win featnre photo- graphs, prints, ·documents. and ar- tifacts that will retell the story of Solomon Northup, a. resident of Saratoga Springs wllo was kid- napped from his horne and sold into slavery in I 841 . In addition, an installation ex- hibit by Terry Adkins will feature a series of sculptures and drawing, inspired by the story ()f Solomon Northup. The exhibit will run until March 14 and will feamre many key speak- ers and panel discussi()ns during this time. The story of Solomon Nmthup is one whichJJaints a clear picture of slavery in all its lights · and shadows. Mr. Northup's narrative entitled \Twelve Years aSJave\ is one filled with honesty and compassion. His story speaks from tl1e l1eart and is void .of biases and opi11ions. His honesty and courage()usn.ess al- lows all of humanity to feel tom- passion for his struggles and battles. Solomon Northup was born a thernan and lived for 30 years in freedom in the town of Saratoga. On Christmas day 182 9 he married a women named Anne Hampton and they lived a very normal life together. Yetin 1841, while visitit1g Wash- ington, Solomon Northup was kid- napped and sold into slavery, where he would remain in bond- . age for 12 years. Solomon eloquently describes . · wben he frrst realized he had been kidnapped and made a slave. \I found myself alone, in utter dark- ness and in chains.\ In 1853, Solomon Northup was rescued from a cotton plantation near the Red River in Louisiana. The story ofthisman is one which helps make us aware oftheinjus- tices in today'sworld and the world of slavery. The exhibit, which at times may he graphic and disturbing, will serve to docUinent the individual and collective stories of the Afri- can•American struggle for freedom and human rights. Many of the discussions which are scheduled deal with slavery as a wl10le. For example, the panel discussion scheduled for Friday January 29 at 7:30PM deals with the issue ofkidnapping free blacks priortothe civil war. o .. continuedfr~mpage 1 project at Beloit College in Wis- projects inclu.de p.ainting local l11itiative, which. is a broad.:based consin that showed miraculous bridges and buildi:ngs~ planting oeoirununity-.revitalizatioll program. improveomentforthecity.

This is the preliminary pari of the process. known as msh, which is basically an opportunity for those students who may wLsl1 to pledge in the future a chance t() experience what life in each ofthe different houses entails. Equally, it isachanceformem- bers of Gi'eek societies to be intro- duced to people, andrn(Jre ilnpor- tantly, personalities, which they feel will add to their org.anization. Though rush events vary from house to house, both Deborah Leif, president of the Panhellenic Coun- cil, and Jamie Drown., head .of the Interfratemity Council, listed din- ners and theme parties as popular yearly events. Typically, sorority events are \no frill,·~ meaning that expenses are kept at a minimum in. <Ul effort to place emphasis on the most essen- tial aspects, such .as the people and the goals of the organiZ<~tion. Likewise, as Drown ex.plained, fraternity events are kept low key as we II, stating, \We try to keep it informal so kids get t() see what each house is really like.'' The experience of rushing a so- rority differs from that of frater- nity rush in the extent to which rushees are expected to partici- pate in events. Leif explained that women are expected to visit and attend events at each of the campuses' four houses. \Each house has its own iden- tity at.1d knows what type of girl it wants to attract,\ she said, •• .. .like- wise, it's important for the girls to feel comfortable with the house they want to pledge.\ This year, sorority rush will oc- cur over the course of four eve- nings, three of which will place on weekends at last year's request of the faculty. \Last year, rush was spread out over three and a half weeks. This is the ftrst year that we've tried to schedule events mainly on week- ends. We've also tried to con- dense the whole process a bit.''· Leif coffilllented. Rush events for fraternities are more loosely coordinated. It is also usually to the discretion of the rushees )Vhich events at which houses they wish to attend. While this method may not give rushees as broad a view of each different house as that gained by sorority rushees, it does leave students with more time to pursue other ac- tivities. \Fraternity rush is as demand~ Rho Chi's help Freshmen women with their questions ab()ut Rush. ing as an.yone wants to make it,\ Drown explained. \We want everyone to have a good time and learn what brothers in each house are really like, de- spite common misconceptions stu- dents have about eCJ,ch of the dif- ferent houses. Comfort level is red ally impo1iant.\ TI1is year :fraternity msh begins January 18th and runs tltrough the week o£ February l()th.When asked how Greek life coincides with academic responsibilities, Leif said she believes that academics do not take a back seat to house functions. She stated t:liat, if any- thmg, living in a househas forced Jter to adopt a more scheduled lifestyle and actma.ll:y offers her a large support systetn of people to to. \We are all atUnion for the same , r€:asons,'' she stated. ·•we work hard and play hard ... the same as e'Veryone else.\ Though rush i:s geared towards freshman, there has been an in- creasing numbet- of students who are choosing to rrush theiT sopho- more year.

In all, she feels tllat the experienc-e ofbelonging to a Greek honse is sil111 ilar to other or- ganizations with several added ben- efits.

However, just because the ma- jority of the swdent body hiber- nates from Thanksgiving through New Year' sEve, does notmean that the Union College faculty and staff does. In fact, OW' favorite, and of course, only, mascot, Dutch, was ke~ping h11sy 011 the road with his Alumni Relations affiliates. On December I, Joe Finocchiaro, Assistant Director of Annual Giv- ing, and his assistant Ed Dombroski,Classof 1998, boarded a very early 5 AM train bourtd for NewYorkCi:ty; Packedalongwith their scarves, gloves and Union sweatshirts was that toe-headed avenger, Dutch. The two men ventured down to New YorkCity on alumni business. However; busin:ess was going to be mixed with a little publicity for the College. Dombrowski noted, ·\There is no carrying case for Dutch so he was a· little awkward to bring with us. So, I ended up walking through Penn Station wearing a blond head. What a strange experience that was.\ Dombrowski and Finocchiaro realized that Dutch was a great ad- vertising to1>l f()r the College and decided to use him to their advan- tage. Alas the idea for a syndi~ated sitcom fell tbrough and Dutch was for(led to seek an alternate televi- sion opportunity. They knew that the Today Show was holding a dri\p fl?r \T~ys for To~s.\ Natll~ rally~ they picked a spot in w.hicb to stand so that they would be in front of the camera andheaded to tile studio at 5 AM armed with Dutch, theirtoys and their Union gear .. Both were outfitted in their Union sweatshirts and, braving the cold, they stood.ready to rally for Union. However, they did need a third partner to, literally, fill the clogs ofDutch. A young girl from Oswego, New York was also in the crowd that day and she seemed a perfect fit Thus Dutch found her limbs and waved frantically in front of the television cameras. AI Roker, the weather forecaster for the showJ spoke with the Union representatives first and then they were asked to come inside for a special segment where they would be seen donating the toys.

ISraeli Prenlier's Party New Cuba- U.S. Foreign Policy Shows Signs oflnstability by Dan Kirsch StaffWriter In the United St1;1tes, we know when our national elections wH1 take place, and de .. spite the the~ori~ -of both major parties we have a relatiye~y stable governmental sys- tem in place. c - _ ln Is rae I, the _political process is so vola- tile that the fate oftl]e nation is seemingly at stake every time Israelis go to tlie polls, and when they do so is usually anybody'.s guess. Three years ago, lsraeli elections were held bask ally .as a referendum on the peace process. Voters. were asked to re- elect the labor _party, appanmtly on its- way to relinquish the West Bank and Gaza, whidi Isreal hacl gail1ed in the 1967 Arab-Israeli_ war. The opposition(Likud) party wanted to scuttle or halt the peace. Voters chose the latter by the inct\edibly close margin of 50.4% to 49.6.

Ricardo Alarcon. the president ofthe to- ea I legislature, a Castro ally and possible successor, issued the formal response from Cuba.

This is an inadequate response-not to say a flimsy excuse-not to say a manifestation of truly appalling priori- ties. As strongly as many of us feel about the paths and sidewalks of Union College, regarding them as among its most beauteous treasures and as infinitely worthy of historical preservation, we would like to think that the college values the personal safety of its students even more highly. But Concordy has a practical as well as a moral rejoinder to the salt-defense. A~ many of us know. and professionals clearly ought to know, there is a substance called calcium chloride that breaks up ice more efficiently than salt because it is efTective at much lower tempera- tures, and that does not conode concrete. Editorial research indicates that the Home Depot has calcium chloride in stock. and that it goes for $9.97 the 50 lb. bag. This is roughly twice the price of salt ($4.97 the 50 lb. bag). but considerably less expensive and far more needful th~n, for example. the anti-aircraft-style illllmination of the Nott Memorial, let alone the lawsuits the college's neglect of basic safety measures could lead to. [FYI Maintenance Mavens: After shopping around, we dis- covered that the Home Depot price for calcium chloride mentioned above is by far the best deal in town. The so-called True Value Hard- ware store is soaking consumers $17.99 the 50 lb. bag.] SAS You Can't Go Home Again by Ian Eletz Contributing Writer Well, we're officially back. The campus is once again showing signs of life. Professors and stu- dents are everywhere. The local bars are hopping with inebriated students. as are the fraternities. And a familiar question rings out everywhere. It's the first thing you hear from nearly everyone you see. It can start a conversation, or if necessary, it can substitute for one. Yes, during this time . of year. we hear it numerous times every day. If you haven't already guessed, the mystery phrase is: \How was your break?\ But this is not an article on how ninety-nine percentofthe time, Union students have ab- solutely nothing of substance to say to each other. Others break for me. I did somethiJJg drastically different this year. I ... stayed· on campus. Now hold on a minute. this is going sOJne- where. I swear. You see. the real issue here is that I can no longer handle home life. After just a year-and-a-half of college, just two short months at home have become very taxing.. Everyone knows what I'm talk- telligent conversations. And I most certainly present myself quite differently when I'm home. I would even go so far as to say that I'm a whole different person. I'm very much off-balance and uncentered. The whole effect is pretty nasty. So this year I decided not to sub- ject myself to all of it. I stayed on campus. I worked. I played ... and all in all had a pretty solid break. And if anyone finds themselves stricken with schooisickness over the break (as opposed to homesickness). I highly recommend the on- campus cure. Don't get me wrong. I love my mother. my friends, and my hometown. They have played a very important pm1 in my lite. anJ without my past. I couldn't be here today. But regardless. whenever I do end up back at home, I am reminded of the ,------~-----~-----~--------; have already addressed this issue, ing about. Mom and Dad always asking where you're going, tl1e same crowds you remember frotn high school, people and places that feel the same way that they did when you left. It all gets vety tir- ing to me. It wears on me. fact that the period in my life that they represent is very mnch over.

However, I was assigned to au• dition this term by my professor and thus spent a great many hours worrying about the one minute of tnemorized material I had to pre- pare.

Union College has-just about completeiy destroyed a long- standing tradition. Because of my vigilance, I hope to reverse this ex- termination ·of tradition on this campus. At this point in time please feel free to start humming the song, \TRADITION from Fiddler on the Roof. If you would like, you can even sing it twice, but please sing it with gusto. The tradition Union is slowly and clearly destroying is the prac- tice of painting the Idol. At the end of 1997,. with the' announcement that the Olin Building was being built, it became a necessity to move the Idol so thattheOiin Cen- ter could be constructed. It was moved aftera campus-wide survey to a spot next to the hockey ring in direct line of sight o( Security. Now, two years later with the Olin Building fmally completed, there has been no talk of moving the Idol, back to, or ~:;lose to its origi- nalhome. Union is not alone in the col.lege world with: the tradition of pick- ing an objeCt and having it painted over andover and over again, night after night.

Our services cost $.28 aniinute for daytime calls, 16 cents a minute after 5 P.M. and 13 cents a minute afte.r ten in the evening·and on the weekends. I surfed over to AT&T to find out what a basic rate would be for a residential calling plan, that's without the discounts they would give forha~ing 2000 people on the plan. AT&T was offering 15 cents a minute on the basic one · rate, and that's not a promotion ... that will expire. They also offer different rates, catering to your calling habits. I'm not a big fan of AT&T, but they were the easiest comparison, and they make the school's offer look expensive without offering any _discounts. ------------------------------------~-'- don'texpect much when it comes I Need A.

I'm complain- ing because Ops never got around to cleaning the walks, or if they did, it snowed over the clean parts. But in all fairness, when Ops gets to it, like the path in front in of Admissions, they do a wonderful job. Forthe final topic of the week, I will take a look at the Security Department. This is by far the most efficient and hard-working part of the campus. The security p.ersonal at Union are a dedicated group of individuals that protect this campus, but even with their help, ·the students need to help themselves. by Jon Tapper Staff Writer One of my many New Year's resolutions for 1999 is to get a new title for this God-forsaken article. Let me know if you have a11y ideas. I have hated the title Tapper's Commentary since Day I. David KKKay was the one who gave my column that title and I really dis- like it a lot. David Kay is another issue for later in this column. I think it is officially safe to say that I will be ba.ck to the old fonnat of not-sa-well-thought-out jokes, puns, and anecdotes for 1he next couple of weeks until a gpod issue pops into my bead that ldeem nec- essary to write about. This past week has been a very enlightening week to meacadeini- cal1y speaking. I have really broadened my horizons by read- ing some phenomenal works writ- ten by unbelievably complex au- thors. I read three different writ- ers and they all happened to be from different continents (which proves that the world really is get- ting sma11er and smaller every- day). I read a book by John Mbiti of Africa entitled, African ReB- gions and Philosophies. It's a great book, which really clears up a Jot oftnyths about Africaand it's written from an African point of view. I also read a collection of poems by England's T~nnyson, entitled, In Memoriam.· I never really liked poetry much but I couldn't put this collection down. It's really interesting and complex:. Tellllyson is a genius. Finally, I had the opportunity to read Mark Twain's, Huckle• berry Finn, for the fourth time. This is an American classic deal- ing with the controversial issue of slavery. If you haven't read tllis, do it and the same goes for the other two wtiters. I ha-ve never given book re- views before but while we are on the subject of books, I might as well fill you in on the plight of former Opinions Editor, David Kay. He has taken some time off from school (whether voluntarily or on Dean's vacation I have not confirmed as of yet) to write a novel You heard tne right the frrst time. Union's own village idiot is going to write a serious novel about a Vietnam soldier's quest to fmd true leve or some buUjunk like that. :First of all, this book has been · written before and itwas also made into a movie called, Good-Morn- ing Vietnam, starring Robin Will· iams. So to recap, David Kay's book is going to be a remake of a classic comedy film minus the comedy. Sounds like its going to l>e as much of a hit as David Kay ever was himself 011 this campus, aJJ.dthat would be not at all. Moving on, lam g.oing to prom- ise to stay away frorn a couple of ,issues in this term's columns. I will not be writing &bout Clinton! Lewinsky Impeachment I will not be writing about fre:.shmell drink· ing problems. I will not be writ- ing about the Greek system. And r will try to stay a~ay from the walking target, Roger Hull. What I am going to try to do is n~t just be my nontutl, .humorous seif, but to also edllcate through cllrnedy. I know thati am a valu- able asset to this catnp11S and I once a!lain want to prove to myself and to all of you that I can earn my kClei). So I hope to be stet>ping up the q11ality of articles sometime in the next couple of weeks. A Union campus with quality Jon Tapper articles is a much better place to live and learn not Jllst academi- cally, but also abo\lt life and its hardsh:ips and realities. Well, that's it for the fttst article. of 1999. As always send all fan lllail to Box #2037. Or you can reach me via email at t~pperj@union.edu. Until next time, I hope everyone has a happy and safe weekend. My final gripe about Campus Operations would have to be on behalf of those people who came back to school expecting running water. Can you believe that people expected to be able to go to the bathroom inside! Some people. And what about those other people who were dealing with water leaking into their rooms. They should be happy that they even have Wa!er, and don't have to go outside to the bushes to take a leak. Moving on, some people have approached me asking about the service at Silliman Hall in the in- fmnary. I respond to these people by saying that the people are nice enough there and they give me free samples of most anything that I need. While I say that, I know In the last 11 weeks there have been at least four attacks. The best known was last tenn, when a stu- dent ·was attacked near Silliman Hall. Neartheveryendoftheterm there were two attacks that very little was ever heard about. Finally, there was a recent attack thiS' term that .has quite a few people questioning how safe the campus really is. During this time, Security has actually increased its . presence, and is in the process.·of training even more officers to beef up the current number, but stu- dents that let strangers into their buildings late at night aren't help- ing anyone. It seems to me that if students want security to provide the pro- tection that they'repaying for, they should stop occupying security with vandalism and other such time-wasting events that occur on a daily basis. Well, now that I'm well over my word maximum, I'll stop and tell you that next week I'll be discuss- ing the Bookstore. Ifyou have any infonnation as. to the bookstore and its policies or anything else you would like me to look into, let rne know at gendtonm@idotunion.edu I'll.get back to you as soon as I can. liJ w Sl le al w e~ S< st m C< St bi gJ nc a Jt tb oJ m tr: th th b< .

After tbe New Year's Phish show in MSG, we showed up at my friend J<:mah 's house in New Jersey at 4:00 AM. What we saw were the remnants of something that resembled a party. We noticed a deep, funk emanating from the ins ide, a vomitous, fecal matter smell, if you will. I asked what happened. It turns out that eight underage drinkers had puked, and only three of them' made it outside. Some puked on toilet seats, some on the walls. It looked like everyone had puked into a' balloon, and some- . one popped it.. But that is only the prelude folks. One ofthe \pukers\ had found his way up to Jonah's bed and passed out. J onab goes up to his room and fmds this kid in his boxers with feces all over the room. For lack of a better word, the kid had defecated in his pants and was busy cleaning it up. He had defecated all over the sheets, the bed, his legs. Abso- lutely horrifying. This got me to thinking. What's worse? Defecat- ing in yotJI pants? Or REALIZ- ING that you just defecated in your pants. I mean, while it happens you're probably like. \Hey I am really messed up and I didn't feel like making it to the bathr()om, bee hee.\ But when you REALIZE what you just did, it's like, •cob my God, I just DEFECATED in my pants. How am I going to clean my clothes, I smell like feces, and once word ~ets out, 1 will never be able to live tbis down!!!!\ Which one do YOU think is worse? -

As a musician almost 'Obsessed with the cutwr.e ofCIIina pas~ and present, I salivated at the oppor- tunity tole~ the pipft(l Chinese lute) in its native setti!lg .. I likewise lunged at every opportunity I had to witness live and recorded per- formances of the pipa · and other traditional Chinese instruments and types of music. Each performance seemed itself a sign pointing to the spirit of the Chinese people; never had I heard in its natural setting, music more representative and relevant of the people who treasure it more than the composer who created it. Never before had the traditional music of a culture seemed so per- sonal~ yet able to escape a singu- lar bearing. Our European musical heritage, · on the other hand, contains some- what \strange\ degre~s of con- tained inwardness that in some ways are a1a loss for a common, recognizal;>le, \European\ cl!ltural personality.

Noh is a traditional fonn <>fJapa- nese theater centered between four poles, which serve as a stage. Titeactors wear brilliant costumes, and el(l.borate masks. The per .. formers tell a story to their audi- ence through slow, fluid move- ments, punctuated by a distinct motion, which follows the rhythms of the three piece Noh orchestral ensemble. Lorfand I were fortu- nate enough to stumble across the Prefectural Noh Theater of K:anazawa. We were accompanied in this venture by fellowavid \the.;. ater goers,\ Mike DeMicco and Rob.yn PeHtrtsky. The music which accompanies Noh, is foreign to the western ear ... to say the . least. Upon exiting the Shoarper- fonnance; little to none ofwhich was comprehensible, seeing as the play was performed in ancient Japallese, DeMicco said, \I thought it would never end.

It took a lot of work to organize and plan, but it will be well worth the effort. If the production is re- ceived with the anticipated amount of enthusiasm, there are hopes to do a second murder mystery in the near future.

Bryce is the founder of by Roger Noyes Staff Writer To herald in the new term, and in the time before art can possibly announce itself from the humdrum of students reacquainting them- selves with campus life, I thought I'd write something resembling an editorial about my musical experi- ences in China late last year. As a musician almost obsessed with the culture of China past and present, I salivated at the oppor- tunity to learn the pipa (a Chinese lute) in its native setting. I likewise lunged at every opportunity I had to witness live and recorded per- fonnances of the pipa and other traditional Chinese instruments and types of music. Each perfonnance seemed itself a sign pointing to the spirit of the Chinese people; never had I heard in its natural setting, music more representative and relevant of the people who treasure it more than the composer who created it. Never before had the traditional music of a culture seemed so per- sonal, yet able to escape a singu- lar bearing. Our European musical heritage, on the other hand, contains some- what \strange\ degrees of con- tained inwardness that in some ways are at a loss for a common, recognizable, \European\ cultural personality. Listening to the sometimes abra- sive and raucous strummings of the pipa, which at a momentous tum can sound like \large and soft pearls dropping on a plate of jade,\ quoting the Chinese poet Bo Ju-yi, I am amazed how a single instrument's construction can lend itself to such a variety of interpre- tation. To me it seemed- and seems- that no single instrument construed in our western musical tradition speaks more colloquially or person- ally than can this instrument alone- especially in our tradition obliged to more than personal expression, but also the worlds of the king's court and monastery. Even today's folk music and other personal projections into the far corners of western music, can- not speak more colloquially or inti- mately than does the language of the ancient fold of Chinese music.

A Petfect Murder Aftershocks by Jill Brodsky Contributing Writer As members of Professor Berk's Holocaust course, many Union students have had the opportunity to hear the horrific testimonies of Holocaust survivors. On January 20, the history department and Hillel are presenting a differentas- pect of the consequences of the Holocaust. Often, we focus our attention on the people who were survivors of the Holocaust .and forget to examine the effect thfs monstrosity had on the children of survivors. Ii1 the Capital District, Sharon Berko founded a group called the Children ofSurvivors ap- proximately ten years ago. The purpose ofthe group is to offer the members an opportunity to share stories of the aftershocks of the Holocaust. \Many Ms. Berko said, ·~have difficulty trust- ing people eutside of their own im- mediate families, Secondly, they have been raised if walking on egg- shells.\ The children of survivors often feel an intense responsibil- ity of bearing the names of those family members who perished in Hitler' s· death camps. Many have entered professions such as social work and health care because they were constantly told to use their time wisely and to ap- preciate life. Recently, a new sup- port group has been formed in the Capital District by Ron James. His hope is that eventually, the group members will be able to give talks in area schools \since people are popping up trying to discredit tile Jews, saying the Holocaust never happened.\ On Wednesday, January 20, Elizabeth Rosner, a child of survi- vors, will present a poetry reading in the fourth floor lounge of the Reamer Campus Center. The talk is scheduled to begin at seven o'clock in the evening. Rosner's poetry has appeared in literary jour- nals and magazines, which include Poetry East, The Cream City View, and Southern Poetry Review. She has received a number of awards for her work and was named \New Emerging Poet'' in the 1995 Anna Davidson Rosenberg Contest for Poems on the Jewish Experience~ She currently Jives in Berkeley and teaches at Contra Costa Commu- nity College ..

This winter seems to have plenty to choose from. Shakespeare in Love is topping the charts and has been nominated to receive the Golden Globe for Best Picture. It stars the Gwenyth Paltrow as the girl who wins young Will Sbakespeare ~s heart. A Civil Action, with John Travolta is the true story of a town's tragedy and the lawyer who represents the families involved. OK, even I could consider this one a \chick flick.\ If you really want to cry, check out Stepmom with Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon, just be sure to bring plenty oftissucs. Keep the tissues out to see Patch Adams with Robin WiHiams. It's Williams at his best as he takes on tile role of a med student gone gooll. Finally, At First Sight stars Val Kilmer as a man who regains his sightjllst in time to look at Mira Sorvino, and pronounce that she is what beautiful looks like. Don't forgetthat Proctor's The- atre shows movies each week for just one doUar, two if you choose the balcony, which I suggest is worth the extra d() Uar .. The movie and time schedule changes each week, so call Proctor's to get up- dated. Area museums are another sug- gestion. The nearby Schenectady Museum is horne to a fantastic planeterium as well as a daily 3-D show. The show changes regu- larly and is always interesting. Ifyou're still stuck for ideas and really need an idea for a hot date, your parents are coming to town, or you are just t:itred of the typical Union scene, grab a copy of Met:Foland Magazine which comes out each Thursday, listing all the going ons in the a.rea.

Six Days Seven Nights 1. A Perfect Murder Aftershocks by Jill Brodsky Cvntnbuting Writt:r As members of Professor Berk's Holocaust CQUtse, many Union srudents have had the opportunity to hear the horrific testimonies of Holocaust survivors. On January 20, the history department and Hillel are presenting a different as- pect of the consequences of the Holocaust. Often, we focus our attention on the people who were survivors of the Holocaust and forget to examine the effect this monstrosity had on the children of survivors. In the Capital Diswict, Sharon Berko founded a group called the Children of Survivors ap- prox.imately ten years ago. The purpose of the group is to offer the members an opportunity to share stories of the aftershocks of the Holocaust. \Many Ms. Berko said, \have difficulty trust- ingpe<lple outside of their own im- mediate fam.ilies. Secondly, they have been raised if walking on egg- shells.\ The children of survivors often feel an intense responsibil- ity of bearing the names of those family members who perished in Hitler's death camps. Many have entered professions such as social work and health care because they were constantly told to use their time wisely and to ap- preciate life. Recently, a new sup- port group has been formed in the Capital District by Ron James. His hope is that eventually, the group members will be able to give talks in area schools \since people are popping, up trying to discredit the Jews, saying tlle Holocaust never happened.\ On Wednesday, January 20, Elizabeth Rosner, a child of survi- vors, wH I present a poetry reading in the fourth floor lounge of the Reamer Campus Center. The talk is scheduled to begin at seven o'clock in the evening. Rosner's poetry has appeared in literary jour- nals and magazines, which include Poetry East, The Cream City View, and Southern Poetry Review. She has received a number of awards for her work and was named \New Emerging Poet\ in the 1995 Anna Davidson Rosenberg Contest f<>r Poems on the Jewish Experience. She currently lives in Berkeley and teaches at Contra Costa Ccmmu- nity Co liege ..

Efforts Unnoticed: Alumni Pride and Support by David Weiner Sports Editor This past weekend, I took my ftrst road trip witlt our Skating Dutchmen to help broadcast their games from Brown and Harvard on the radio. Before taking tltis trip, l never realized how strong the alumni fan base is both in the Schenectady area, but more importantly, around the country. Our alumni seemingly take .more pride in this school than many current students. Seeing how tightly knit these alumni groups have be- come and how loyal these alumni remain to Union and its athletics and academics clearly shows what our school offers. While the Dutchmen did not fare as well as they may have liked this week- end, the noise inside the arenas when Union blasted a puck into the net was bewildering. Friday night, through a blizzard and all, Union managed to put more fans into the Brown hockey rink than did Brown them- selves. Then, Saturday night at Harvard, nearly every seat on the Union side of the ice was filled with faithful alumni. Our hockey team is not the powerhouse of the ECAC for vari- ous reasons, but every game, the players go out and put forth every effort tq play wel1, score, and win. At the reception after the Harvard hockey game, coach Kevin Sneddon eloquently said, \I cannot promise how many wins we will end the season with, but J can say that we have the most faithful and loyal fans of any team in the ECAC.\ That, in and of itseolf, is a strong statement considering the teams that comprise the ECAC, but at every home hockey game, Achilles rink is packed with as many fans from Schenectady as stu- dents from lJn ion.

Montana Staf/Writel' Senior engineering students are always busy with their projects at this time of year. Many are trying to me~t early Spring Term dead• lines for completion and pr.esen .. tation to the faculty and their peers. Eight senior engineers, however, have had a.more inter- -esting experience than the usual. These eight students are Com .. puter Systems Engin.eeringmajors Barry Baker, Bill Desrochers, Dan Feldman, and Bianca Prumo as well as Mechanical Engineering majors Peter Flynn~ Philip Haynes, Aaron Pincus, and David Poindexter. They have worked in pairs en this.year's IVDS-Inter- national Virtual Design Studitr- preject. · Each Union College pair has · beep working with P!lirll of Elec~ trical Engineering majors from tile M-iddle East Technical University (METU) in turkey via the Internet. The task: each group of Union andMETU students, work· ing together, must design and build a robot that seeks out <:andles by the heat they give off, and extinguishes them. Two trials must be met in a cer··· tain amount of time. The ftrst in- volves a single candle on a table ofkn:own dimensions, the position of which is known. The robot, however, must be;ableto navigate amund an obstacle in order to g-et to the candle and put it out. The second trial involves ten randomly placed candles.. on a similar Jable. The robotmu~tftrt~ a}! ten •. put thetri out in the allotted time, and not go off the edge of the table. Sound easy? Prof~ssor Cherrice Traver of the EE/CS Department and Professor Rl()naldBucineUofthe ME Depart- ment serve as faculty advis()rs for the IVDS proje~t. They will be accompanying the students and robots on a trip to METU in Turkey from January23rd through the 31st. There the stu- dents will meet th~ir Turkish coun- terparts person-t()·person for the frrsttime, and the robots will com- pete to see if they can meet their tasks. On the faculty side, discus- sions will be held about problems enceunteredon this year's project, and ideas will be discussed for next year. Actually, according to Professor Bucinell, the faculty usually know what next year's project will be by the time they leave Turkey. This gives them a chance to get a feel for which students would be best for the task. The faculty try to come up with a project that is.challenging but not impossible. On the same token, Bucinell relates, \We want no one These added a·new dimension to the pr()ject that foreshadows . what engineering in the real world will be like, relates Flynn. Bucinel\l\ agrees. \Even though the Turkish students speak En- glish, the students had to find ways t() describe things without using too many idioms and slang terms.\ The time difference between Union and METU also played a role. \And usage of the Internet as the primi:ll)' form of communication provides ·lns ight, Bucinell says, Contiizued on page 5 Dance Students Meet Rejection with Anger by Brooke M. Barylick News Editor The room slowly filled with stu- dents who appeared somewhat. confused and forlorn. They knew that they attended this particular meeting to hear bad news. Some started conversations with those around them that con· sisted of questions about winter break and winter term classes .. Others simply waited in-silence f<lr the meeting to begin. Upon entering the studio,. the three professors managed smiles that seemed to illustrate a false sense of security. Hilary Tann, Dean of the Performing Arts o~ partment at Union College, wel- comed the students who dedi- cated this lunch period to a seri- ous topic. \The fun.rre of the Dance Pro- gram at Union College is in jeop- ardy and we, as professors in the dance dep~en~ called you here to solicit your assistance an<! sug- gestions in dealing with thi.s mat- ter,\ Tann stated. Tann continued by explaining that fer the past .tbree years an alumnus of Union College has generously donated money to help the dance programbeccrne stronger. The donation. paid the salary for a part-time instructor, Miryam Moutille~ who taught two full-credit dance classes: Dance in America and The Dance Experience. Unfor- tunately, the alUmnus decided to withdraw tlti!i. money, ending the funding for th.e part-time position and preventing the (Ontinumtion of tlte full-credit dance courses, The donor, Cllarles Lothridge, de- Cided .to withclrawhis donati<>n be- cause of .the lack of support from the administration at the College.

Montana Staff Writer Senior engineering students are always busy with their projects at this time of year. Many are trying to meet early Spring Term dead- ! incs for completior~ and presen- tation to the faculty and their peer~. Eight senior engineers. however, have had a more inter- esting experience than the usual. These eight stmknts arc Com- puter Systems Engineering majors Barry Baker, Bill Desrochers, Dan Feldman, and Bianca Promo as well as Mechanical Engineering majors Peter Flynn, Philip Haynes, Aaron Pincus, and David Poindexter. They have worked in pairs on this year's IVDS-Inter- national Virtual Design Studio- project. Each Union College pair has been working with pairs of Elec- trical Engineering majors from the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Turkey via the Internet. The task: each group of Union and METU students, work- ing together, must design and build a robot that seeks out candles by the heat they give off, and extinguishes them. Two trials must be met in a cer- tain amount oftime. The first in- volves a single candle on a table oflmown dimensions, the position of which is known. The robot, however, must be able to navigate around an obstacle in order to get solution to be superior in all areas.\ The eight students ha\ e found the I\' DS project to be a challengin~ but rewarding proce<>s. , As an engineering design project, they were faced · · with a rrohlem that rt·- quircd l\\trl'lllL'h 'llJ,h j,ti- ctted rPbPh ~~-- tht· \(liiJ- tion Tlil'IL\ 1\ L\IL' I .!Ill!

The second trial involves ten randomly placed candles on a similar table. The robot must fmd aJI ten, put them out in the allotted time, and not go off the edge of the table. Sound easy? Professor Cherrice Traver of the EE/CS Department and Professor Ronald Bucinell of the ME Depart- ment serve as faculty advisors for the IVDS project. They will be accompanying the students and robots on a trip to METIJ in Turkey from Januazy23rd through the 31st. There the stu- dents will meet their Turkish coun- terparts person-to-person for the first time, and the robots will com- pete to see if they can meet their tasks. On the faculty side, discus- sicns will be heJd about problems encountered on this year's project, and ideas will be discussed for next year. Actually, according to Professor Bucinell, the faculty usually know what next year's project will be by the time they leave Turkey. This gives them a chance to get a feel for which students would be best for the task. The faculty try to come up with a project that is challenging but not impossible. On the same token, Bucine11 relates, \We want no one been addressed in the classroom. These added a new dimension to the project that foreshadows what engineering in the real world wiJl be like, relates Flynn. Bucinell agrees. \Even though the Turkish students speak En- glish, the students had to find ways to describe things without using too many idioms and slang terms.\ The time difference between Union and METU also played a role. \'And usage of the Internet as the primary form of communication provides insight, Bucinell says, Continued on page 5 Dance Students Meet Rejection with Anger by Brooke M. Barylick News Editor The room slowly filled with stu- dents who appeared somewhat confused and forlorn. They knew that they attended this particular meeting to hear bad news. Some started conversations with those around the.m that con- sisted of questions about winter break and winter term classes. Others simply waited in silence for the meeting to begin. Upon entering the studio. the three professors managed smiles that seemed to illustrate a false sense of security. Hilary Tann, Dean of the Perfonning Arts De- partment at Union College, wel- comed the students who dedi- cated this lunch period to a seri- ous topic. \The future of the Dance Pro- gram at Union College is in jeop- ardy and we, as professors in the dance department, called you here to solicit your assistance and sug- gestions in dealing with this mat- ter,\ Tann stated. Tann continued by explaining that for the past three years an alumnus of Union College has generously donated money to help the dance program become stronger. The donation paid the salary for a part-time instructor, Miryam Moutillet, who taught two full-credit dance classes: Dance in America and The Dance Experience. Unfor- tunately, the alumnus decided to withdraw this money, ending the funding for the part-time position and preventing the continuation of the full-credit dance courses. The donor, Charles Lothridge, de- cided to withdraw his donation be- cause of the lack of support from the administration at the College. He claimed that the purpose ofhis do- nation was to help the Dance pro- gram grow into a larger and more successful part of Union College. Once he began donating, the scho<Jl assumed that he would continue this gift infinitely, which was not his plan. L()thridge noted, \It's a shame that the school does not realize how valuable this program is. I had hoped that they would have sup- ported my efforts. Since they did not, I retracted my gift.\ Tllis severely injures the dance program because, without these classes, a minor in dance can no longer be offered. Over the past six years~ the dance program has grown, implementing classes such as ballet and modem dance as well as the aforementioned offerings. In addition, Eduard Villella vis- ited the schoo I on various occa- sions to host workshops and de- scribe his experiences as a dancer and founder of the Miami City Bal- let. A scholarship was also estab- lished in Villella's name that alt()wed one student to participate in an in- ternship at his studio. In addition, technical advances such as new lighting and stereo systems were made that improved the studio im- mensely. These improvements allowed the dance department to hold their first performance last winter, which in- cluded presentations by members of each dance class. After Tann finished the explana- tion ofthe advances of the Dance Program at Union, she came to the bottom line of the discussion.

Therefore, the school would only be paying for the salary of the Vis- iting Guest Artist, Moutillet; which would amount to approximately $20,.000. She stressed that the amount of money was not large; since it is only a half-time position. · Tann then indicated that she and the other dance professors have sought the help of alumni and the administration to see what options can be ~stablished to keep the pro- gram atthe level it is now· and to prevent 1t from experiencing any setbacks. However, Tann infonnedthe stu• dents that her efforts to persuade the administration to see the value of the program have, thus far, been fruitless. \The administration rejected our pleas for assistance. Now it js up to you,\ Tann stated. Professors Moutillet and Meyers, both instructors of dance, noted that the students needed to be\ome actively involved in the situation in hopes that they can sway the decision of th~ adminis;. tration. They also stressed that they were open to any suggestions and ideas that might help the adminis- tration realize that money should indeed be allocated to the dance program at Union College. At this point, the students who attended the meeting began ex- ... co.,tinued from page 1 pres.si:ng their concern and outrage. Ideas were offered and suggestions were ma<le: Many participated in brainstorming while other.s pon- dered the troubling news.

It is ludicr()liS :not to support this pro- gran~.\ The meeting concluded as a list passed through the hands of the attendees on which they wrote their names and pnone numbers, in hopes that they will be able to · make a difference in the future of their beloved dance program. The students seemed deter- mined to prove to the administra- tion that the dance program is, in- deed, an invaluable asset to a lib- . eral arts college. The Dance Department hopes that these dedicated students can change the future so that others · who attend Union in the years to come can be blessed with the chance to experience dance as · they have done in their years at the College. Dance students are uncertain of their..future at Union College. stances on the issue. \There's a lot to be gained from both sys- tems, \r~plied Zandman, while· Markowski answered \I don't re- ally want to comment on that now.\ when asked how they would weigh in at the Board meeting early next month. Zandman also wanted to , see the material before he made a • declarative statement as to how he would intluence the discussion of · the Board. \I'll have to see the list of pros and cons,'' Markowski told Concordiensis. This list, presented to the AA C and being sent to the Board, was nothing more than a list of pros and cons of tile semester and trimester system, according to Cool. ln or- der to make sure the list reflected no bias towards either system, it was sent to two professors, one favoring the trimester system, the other favoring the semester sys- tem. Professor Tom Werner, who favors trimesters of the Chemistry Department, explaining \the tenn • system is the scaffolding of our· academic structure.\ He continued that things that set 0 nion apart, . including \terms abroad, under- g~aduate research, a strong major • and minor, and a nontrivial general education program\ would falter lJilder a semester system. Profes- sor J. Scott Scullion of the Clas.- sics Department was the other pro- fessor, favoring the semester sys- tem. Clnistina Sorum, Dean of Arts and Sciences, who also taught Classics, said that the Humanities disciplines often favored a semes- ter system, citing the extra time and told that she felt she was \com- pelled to shortchange students under a trimester system,\ .because ofthe five less weeks under a tri- . mester system. This list of pros and cons to he brought before the Board could not be shared with Concordiensis or the gener!:lT public, accor.ding to Cool. SheeJq>lained;Cool and Hull frrmly reiterated that this was not a fonnal proposal, rather a simple list. However, it could not be shared with Concordiensis or the general public. Cool explained, Hull reit- erated, saying \the trustees need to be informed.\ If the B()ard decides they would be open to a formal pmposal, changing Union's calendar, a cam- pus wide discussion would begin, starting with the AAC. The Stu- dent Forum representative to the AAC, Josll Mondlick, Vice Presi- dent of Academic Affairs, said he would survey the student opinion on the issue before making a deci- sion. Although some students were unhappy with parts of the trimes- ter system, including Janine Abbate '00, who said \Ending the school yea.r June makes it difficult for students to get internships over the summer. If we ended in mid-May, it would make things much easier.\ The majority of stu- dents that the Concordiensis spoke to were highly in favor of the trimester system. \I'd transfer if we had semesters. They were the reason I came here,\ said Shannon Conaty '02. Julie Senreich 'OOex- pressed similar sentiment for the trimester system, saying, \I like tri- mesters. They're what's ttnique about the schcol and they make Union what it is.\ AlthougliCool assured that \anything the stu- dents say will be taken ve1y seri- ously,\ Hull reminded the student body that no current Union stu- dent would be affected by a po- tential switch. According to Sorum, the earliest a change would be put in place would be for the 2002-03 school year, they ear after the current freshmen class gradu- ates. The faculty had a mixed reaction about trimesters. Professor James Underwoodofthe Political Science Department and fonner Dean of the Faculty from 1988 to 1995, told Concordien.sis \l love trimesters. I've taught under both the semes- ter and trirnester system at Union, and I prefertrimesters.\ Other fac- ulty members disagreed, express- ing their disdain for the system. Cool said that on an \abs<>lutely personal tevel, as Linda Cool the anthropologist, working on the tri- mester system has been painful.\ Both Cool and Hull were unsure as to wh!it the course of action would be if the Board agreed to entertain a proposal by the AAC that was endorsed by the fatuity and rejected by the student body. This situation seems plausible given inf<>rmal student reaction against a change to semesters. Sorum, on the other hand was op- timistic about the possibility of a semester system being approved by the faculty, saying that \the chances are better than they've ever beefl. 1 ~

At this point iH the school year, almost everything has become ha- bitual, the .same table, the same company, and the same food. Well, now there is reason to change. The Rathskellar may look the same from afar, but it is all a fayade. If one actually still looks at the menu, they will notice that there are many more itelJl.S avail- able to the students.

Library Lasts Longer by Erin Aloan Contributing Writer Last fall it came to the attention of the Student Affairs Council (SAC) that students were unhappy with the hours of operation of Shaffer Library, specifically the fact that the library closed so early on weeknights. Students were upset that they were forced to leave the library so early, when many people prefer to study late at night rather than early in the morning. This complaint was voiced to members of the Student Forum, who in turn took the issue to the SAC. The SAC is composedofthe Presidents of the Sophomore, Jun- ior, and Senior classes, as well as a Greek and Independent represen- tative, and faculty and administra- tors. The members wholeheartedly · agreed with the claim that the li- brary hours were insufficient, and began a joint investigation with li- brary director Tom McFadden to detennine how Union compared with similar schools. The results of the inquiry were surprising and disappointing. Union ranked last in total weekly hours of operation when compared to fifteen other schools surveyed, among them Middlebury; Williams, and Amherst. It was obvious that a change needed to be made in order to im- prove the intellectual atmosphere on Union's campus. It was decided that beginning with the winter term, the library would increase its hours of operation, remaining open late~ every night of the week. This term students will have the opportWlity to take advantage of the changes that were made. Fortlle frrsttime, Union's library will beopen for a total ofl 09 hours per week, moving it from fifteenth to fourth in the list of schools sur- veyed this fall. However. Cara Molyneaux, Head of Access Services at Shaffer Li- brary, says that so far thistenn, few students have taken advantage of the new library hours. close at 10 PM Sunday-1'h,ursday. Molyneaux also wanted to infonn students tltat 23 Resnet connec- tions have 'been added throughout the library, allowing students to hook up to their own accounts . while at the library; outlets with Resnet access are marked, and a map of their l<lcations will be avail- able soon.

Campus News ' Hillel Happenings A Heartfelt Donation by MichaelKreiner Contributing Writer It is easy to walk into West Col- lege and stroll right by the small plastic sign that reads, \Kosher Kitchen.\ The problem with such a small sign is that it does not rep- resent the many programs that Hillel, the Jewish Student Organi- zation on Campas, holds each week. Hopefully as time goes by this trimester each member of the campus community will recognize the Kosher Kitchen and the many events that are planned each week. Each Tuesday evening Hillel holds a weekly board meeting open to the campus community at 5:15 to discuss events and programs. These weekly meetings are a per- fect opportunity to visit Hillel and propose an event for an upcoming holiday or to suggest a meal for a Friday night dinner. It is easy to have ideas, but it is hard to fmd the forum to express them. Our Tuesday meetings provide the set- ting for such expression. Follow- ing the meeting at 6 PM for just one meal swipe you too cari have a home-cooked meal at Hillel. On Friday nights Hillel wel- comes Shabbat: conducting ser- vicesat5:40anddi:nnerat6:00. The service is a nice time tQ reflect on the past week and look to the fu- ture. It is not necessary to have any solid knowledge of the prayers, just the desire to learn and enjoy them. This past week Hillel welcomed back these who went on tenns abroad with a'lOneg Shabbat (dessert reception) following din- ner. We then watch.ed Mr. Satur- day Night, starring· Billy Crystal. This coming Saturday wewillbave a Havdalall Service at 6:45, and. then watch History of the World Part I. starring Mel Brooks. Mov- ies will be held on Friday or Satur- day evening depending on the home hockey schedule. In addition to our events that oc- cur weekly, Hillel continues to plan lectures and fund-raisers.

Union College Remembers a Great American Hero by Jon Kelson Staf/Wl'iter On Monday. January 18th, the Multi-cultural Affairs Group and the Africana Studies department hosted the Union College King Day Celebration in remembrance of the Reverend Dr~ Martin Luther King, Jr. History professor A.T. Miller served as the. emcee for the event, which was a forum for p_o- etry readings, personal tributes, and song singing all in homage to Dr. King. Union College President Roger · Hull began the speaking with a welcome, emphasizing the need for action to create a better commu- nity, much like Dr. King himself. He feels that deeds are most important, asking the audience, \What are we going to do?\ Student Forum President Beth Wierzbieniec was spoke next, read- ing a portion of Dr. King's 1964 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech. She was followed by Rob Bennett, VP of Multi-cultural Af- fairs. He chose to read quotations that stuck out from King's 1967 . speeches \Where We Go.From Here\ and \Black Power Defined.;' Bennett advised the audience to take King's ideals and plug them into our everyday lives in order to prepare for future generations. Gretchel Tyson, Director of Af- fmnative Action and Community Outreach at Union, and Professor Steve Berk each spoke next. Tyson emphasized the need for a greater sense of responsibility in ,our com- munity, while Berk called Dr. King \The Greatest American of the 20th Century.\ Dr. King was every- where where there was a battle for civil rights and \human dignity.\ He was inspirational, cmntc,rtillll!. a strategist, and a ··,.rl'ltt!! •. man of nonviolence,\ cording to Berk.

He commented on Dr. King and. his life, and also on society as we lmow ittoday, not only at Union, but in the country as a whole. Miller referred to Dr. King as confronta- ticnal and proactive, yet peaceful and nonviolent. He also offered a few statistics regatding the Afri- can-American population at Union, saying that there were approxi- matelythe same numberof African- Americans on campus in the fall of 1997 as there were about 25 years ago. Monday's celebration in honor of the great Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. w_as rich with literary excellence and marked by powerful speeches by -both students and faculty. Miller included the audience, as sparse as it was, by leading the '<chorus\ in stirring renditions of \We Who Believe in Freedom,'; \Lift Every Voice and Sil1g)\ \Keep Your Eyes on the Prize,'' ''Come By Here,\ and \Carry It On.\ The trib- ute was a tremendous rement• brance to a wonderful man, father, and husband. Dr. King's legacy will never be forgotten, as his life should be celebn!ted everyday, not just the 18th of January. 1 . ' ' l '

BMB Union Should Observe Holidays To the Union College Administra- tion, This past Monday was Martin Luther King Day, and for those who are out of touch with reality, (a common occurrence at Union College) it was a national holiday. However, the holiday was forgot- ten in Schenectady where this col- lege is a place mired in a make- believe land of superiority and elitism. The factthat this school fails to recognize national holidays is a severe problem. It is a bla- tan(lack of respect for freedom and shows just how out of touch with reality and the stu- dent body this administration is. To those who make the decisions, I must ask: Why are you so ignorant? Year after year, decade af- ter decade, the college has failed to recognize such holi- days such as Labor Day, Vet- erans Day, Martin Luther King Day, Presidents Day, and Memo- rial Day.

[ love snow.\ -~: . ' I now realize that these seem- ingly rude inhabitants qf northern New Jersey are, in fact, correct. A New York State winter, as I have experience!l it so far; is insane- no normal precipitation falls on the Union College grounds. To combat these rare types of accumulation and ensure our safety, my friends and. I decided to make a rule that we do not leave our residence hall when it is snow- ing. This rule is intended. to keep us safe. May I present two excel- lent reasons for not leaving your room when these Schenectady style snowy-ice storms are in ef- fect? First of all, it is near!y impos- sible to walk in these slick condi- tions because, no matter how often the walkways ate cleared (some- times with great frequency by our friend Mr. Williams and sometimes never) there is always a layer of \scary ice·~ over the c.oncrete. This is not nonnal ice, mind you. This is ice that cannot be seenwith the naked eye or conquered by even the most high-tech Gore-Tex en- cased hiking boot. This ice will, inevitably, knock you offyour feet. Rather than form a committee to outsmart this inge- nious Schenectady \scary ice,\ the school has decided to let snow cover it, seemingly in the place of salt. May I ask why this goes on? Does this school really not have enough money to purchase salt for the walkways? I suggest going to the local po- lice or :fire department and explain- ing our fmancial predicament. \In mosttowns, salt bags' are given out as a free service. This is one gov- ernmental program which. we should take advantage of. The second danger of traveling on foot in the· winter is the hazard · of unannounced avalanche. Yes, I realize that we are not a school nestled high in the Alps where a tradi1ionai avalan~he is more apt to occur, but believe me, this js an imminent danger. As you slip along the sidewalk, take care to stay alert. At any mo- ment, the snow and ice chunks on the roofs ·of a building may give way and come tumbling down. If this me~s lands on you, good luck. My guess is that you will be ren- dered unconscious and become covered with the snowfalL When spring rolls around and you ar~ found, .you will be either suffer~ ing from ex.posure or dead. Either way, it is not desirable, so stay on y(lurtoes. At this point in the article, most of you have realized that I had nothing better to talk about and , some of you have decided that I . have no idea what I am talking about. To the latter group) I offer this as an example of an ava- lanche. As I sat in my room on Friday, January 15, at lunchtime, I was startled by the machine gun frre outside my window. . What I thought was a full fron- tal assaulton North College turned out to be an avalanche of enor:.. mous proportions. When told of ·this avalanche, my RA apolo- gized, but unless she was up on the roof pllshing the snow off the roofwi1l1 a broom, it was not her is nothing that c~ be done about this high-altitude ac- cumulation, so help yourself; be readyto dive out of the way of fall- ing snow and ice. Whomever the evil genius is that created the freshman meal plan, the one that requires all freshmen to eat 15 meals per week at West, is raking in the money for the school. I may have consumed three meals last week· where does this extra money go? Certainly not to the up-keep ofthe grounds. I guess work in the front door - HA HA HA.'' One might ask, at a school as fmancially capable as Union, why we are still using the obsolescent key system. Would it not make more sense to graduate to a swipe card entry system? Students are less likely to lose their ID cards, because they are so essential to col- lege life. If an ID card was lost, it could be cancelled, and then there would not be a threat of some ran- dom person getting into the dorm. Of course, a more intelligent and feasible solution is retinal scans. Keys and ID cards can be lost, but it is very difficult to lose an eye. If campus operations purchased some salt to com bat The Brian Boitano Effect, students would no longer be in danger of an ice-re- lated eye injury and the plan would be foolproof. Voice recognition software is another solution. Students would simply speak a code word into the door, and it would·open. The only drawback to this software is the existence of people who are skilled in impersonations. Passwords are easy to carry and hard to lose. Residents could en- ter their password to unlock the door. If a password was entered incorrectly a certain number of times, campus security could be alerted to prevent outside people from breaking into the dorm. Again, the only threat to the pass- word system is amnesia 1 due to a fall on the skating rink we like to call a campus. . Residence Life's plan for re-is- suing keys was neither we11 thought out, nor well executed. We can only hope that they will con- sider alternative entry systems in the future, to prevent this kind of silliness from happening again. up to Matty G- the esteemed money chaser of the Concordy. As each meal at West costs my parents seven do liars, and I seem to have missed 12 of. them, the school has made 84 dollars off of me this week alone. Might I recommend that the school use this money to hire someone who was laid off by GE in 1984 to chop ice? Surely not all of these people have already found new jobs

International Community Responds to Kosovo Genocide by Stephen Nemeth Stq.ffWriter On Monday, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana \.yarned Yugoslav President Solbodan · Milosevi.c that he must abide by the October cease-fire and stoJJ h.is crackdmvn on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. SoJana also said that Milosevic must cooperate with cease-fire monitors from the Orga- nization for Security and Coopera- tioH in Europe, as wellas officials investigating last week's massacre in which 45 civilians were kH led. Solana said, \There is no ques- tio.n that regional responsibility lies on the shoulders of President Milosevic, he bears the majarity of responsibility.\ Solana com- mented that if Milosevic refuses to comply he wi U face .. the reality ofNA TO''- a reference to the pos- sibility ofNA TO intervention. He also stated that force would be a last resmt. Solana admonished the KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army) rebels for their reluctance to enter into negotiations and for continu- ing to fight against Serbian forces.

Meanwhile, Yugoslav forces broadened their ass au It beyond the Kosovo village ofRacek, where on Saturday the bodies of 4.5 civil- ians were found shot, many <'!t dose range. Serbian officials claimed that the bodies were those of Kosovo Liberation Army guer- rillas killed in combat even though the victims included were many older men, 3 won1en, and a bOy. In- ternational observers found the bodies on Saturday heaped on a hillside and in a muddy gully. The UN, NATO, and US condemned the massacre, the wo.rst killing spree in the year-long fighting be- tweell the KLA and the Serbian forces. The massacre also repre- sented the highest single death toll since UN Envoy Richard HolbroGkebrokered a peace settle- ment in October. \I consider this to be a very pro- vocative act by the Yugo~lav au- thorities, which have again broke the cease-fire;· said Britain's Ma- jor General John Drewienkiewicz, 'deputy head of the Organization for Security and· Cooperation in Eul'()pe mission in Kosovo. Drewienkiewicz also said all OCSE members were accounted for and that m<Jnitoring would cont_inue despite the killings. The UN ileld an emergency meet- ing in which members demanded ''an immediate and full investiga- tion\ into the gruesome killing. RichardHolbrooke commented on the severity of the atrocity. \The situation is as serious now -per- haps more serious - than it was in October,\ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke told CNN. At that time, NATO was ''96 hours away froni bombing,\ he said. William Walker, the US head of the Kosovo monitoring mission, called the massacre \a11 unspeak- able atrocity\ and ·•a crime v~i;ry much against humanity.\ \Nor do I hesitate to accuse the government ·secvrity forces of responsibilitY,\ he added. After Walker's statements. the governmen't ofYugoslayia issued a statement, saying, \The federal government... has decided to pro- claim William Walker an undesirM able person ... which binds him to leave the territory of Yugoslavia within 48 hours.\ The Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency also wasted no time in accusing Walker of\'flagrantly\ violating his mandate to oversee c9mpliance of the Oct(:)ber peace accords in which Mi losevic agreed to halt the crackdown on ethnicAl- banians. US State Department spokes- man James Rubin said Miloseyic was playing with fire and strongly urged him to ,reverse the decision to expel Walker. State Department and national security advisors met to discuss the most serious set- back to peace in Yugoslavia in a number of years. President Clinton condemned the ·killings ''in the stron_gest possible terms,;. and called tl1e atrocity ''a clear viola- tion\ of the Serbs cease-fire agree- ment with NATO. He also added that \'This was a deliberate and in- discriminate act of murder de- signed to sow fear among the people of KosQVO.\ After the mass~cre, Ethnic AI- bauian leader Ibrahim Rugova re- newed his call for NATO interven- tion after the \'cruel attack.\ The Albanian government echoed Ru,gova's remarksandaccused the· Se-vbs of \experimenting with the 1112\$Sann.ih ilation\ of ethnic Alba- niE~its, who comprise an estimated 90 percent ofthe 2 million people in Kosovo.

The two had in- ·· te11ded to leave on Monday, bu.t they delayed .the meeting after they were told Milosevic was too busy to see them. Despite the warnings, Yugoslav forces continued to shell th~ area· with anti aircr11ft guns. tanks,andheavy atiillery. One iry- ternational observer reported the Yugos-lav forces appear to be con- ducting a syst~matic assauJt on the area; ''It looks 1ike there may be a s·i- multaneous operation to hit three · or four villages in the at:ea,\ an ob- servertold reporters fh)Jn a hill .near Serbian positions.

Yugoslav border police re- fused to let Arbour into the coun- try on Monday. The officers claimed that she did n'ot have the proper documentation to enter the country. NATO ministers and UN mem- bers are determined to show Milosevic a strong and immediate response and the unity of the world against the atrocity. Th~y are al.sodetem1inedto bring about a coqclusion to the atrocity and prevent fi.tture ones from occurring.

Furthermore, Brazil an- nounced massive increases in short -term h1terest rates from 29% to 41% to encourage domestic in- vestment and to discourage the outflow of money.

Page 2 Once again this week, Riding the Pine will be used to keep Union tradition and lore alive. This ;past weekend, the Film Committee of Union Colle~e showed the teen horror film Urban Legend''· For those of you there that did not see the movie and have no idea what it is about. here is a quick little re- cap. The movie is about a small liberal arts college that offers a class in classic urban legends. In this class they discuss such things as the babysitter getting phone calls from the upstairs of the house she is in. Another one is about the young girl getting flashed by an- other car because there is a kHler in her back seat. In the movie. people start dying ii1 forms of tllese urban legends. However, the point of this week's article is not a re- view of this movie. After seeing the movie for the second time (yes I am a fan for really cheesy mov- ies) l started thinking that Union - with its long standing history - must have its own share of Urban Legends. To find my story I went off to the library, and instead of doing the homework that was assigned to me, I stai1ed reading up about the history of the sphool and the surrounding area. Let me tell you that the Brief Hislo!Jl of Union College is not that interesting. Then after almost giving up the search I stumbled on to a book about the history of the surround- ing area.

While this is an important issue, it is more the fault · of the professors for not ordering the correct number of books than it is the bookstore, for they are at the whim oflarge distributors. Another concern brought to my attention was that the prices on some books are crossed out with black markers, and then a UPC label is added to the book.

(Part 2) by .Jon Zandman Contributing WJ'iter Last week, we found out that in 1802, Union College had a total of about 50 students, all very well versed in Latin, and tllition was only $24 dollars. That would mean. by the way, that the anJ.Jual working budgc;:t was roughly $1.200. To put that in perspective, this year's an- . . nual' working budget is near $75 million. This week, VJe are going to del-ve fmiher into Union life almost 200 years ago and' take a look at · Chapter IV: Of Misdemeanors and Criminal Offenses. ''\Sec. 2.

Carlos explained that they could fetch higher prices for the adorable ani- mals by selling them to buyers personally instead of pawning off the purebreds to pet stores. You don't have to be an Eco major to see the advantages of cutting out the middle man. Still, tile idea of selling pets in the same manner with which push- ers vend dope struck me as just a bit odd.

The trick with this new hot technology is the fact that it changes very rap- idly ·and there is no real standard format in which to com pare the vari- ous types of DVD players. As in most cases,. salespersons who are pushing th~ DVD technol- ogy will tell you wh!lteveryou want to hear i11, order to get a sale froltl. you. Don't fa1l ihtothat trap; 111ake sure that you know exactly what features that you need before you enter the showroom. Ok, so what is DVD anyway? Even the meani11g of the name, DVD, is changing. Originally DVD stood for mgital Video Disc, but is now 1nore often ca11ed Digital Ver- ?atile Disc because it can be used to store computer data as well as video. DVD is a fom1at based on the compact disc. It is five inches in diameter and can l1ave two layers on each side. Essentially, it is the size of the all too familiar CD that can be placed into the common ste- reo. So how can ~fi vetimes the amount of information titon the same sized disk? Other than being two sided, the formatoftlle infonnation is also much more condensed. As you can see in the picture, the ~oles are more numerous for the sari1e amount ofspace. Since the infonnation is so much. more condensed, a new typeofla- 2, which givesahigherquality pic- serneeds to be utilized. I11 the case \turethan VHS.

This sig- nificantly increases the storage capacity, especially when you consider that DVD can b~ double-sided as \)'elf. So jltst how much information can you fit on one DVD? You can store approx i- mately :133 minutes of video on one layer, as . wel:l as 8 soundtracks, including a 5.1 soundtrack such as Dolby Digital, and up to 32 sets qf subtitles. Also, DVD gives the option of different camera angles to be stored on the disc so that tJ1e user can switch between them and also different rat- ings (such as PG etc:) and aspect ratios.

When I respond that I am majoring in music and minoring in physics, the comments I receive range any- where from complete understand- ing to bewildern1ent. ff I achiev~ wha1 [ intend to \vi thin this·article, then hopefttlly those who were less inc] ined to see the relationship be- tween the two will have an under- · standing, albeit a. simple one, of how musical notes are prodaced by various instruments. In m:derto get the idea, one must understand how a sound wave is propagated, or created. Sound is basically caused by the physical interaction oftwo objects, result- ing in the vibration ofone or more objects to produce vibrational waves that are then can·ied by a medium, such as water or air. When Ben Bwtt received his Acadetny A ward for sound effects in Star Wars, he said that it was ironic that he received this award since there is no sound in .space. This is tt-ue because there is no medium to carry the sound waves. 'These waves ofpressure then vibrate the ear drum and, in turn, are inter- preted by the brain as sound For the more scientifically-mindedread- ers, the aadibJe range oft11e e.lec- tromagnetic spectrum 1s from 16 to abollt 16,000hertz.

A given and distinctive vibra- tion is what gives a pa1ticuJar in- strument its timbre or its own.char- acteris!ic sound. Within a piano, wires are struck; in woodwind in- struments (with exception ~f the flute and piccolo), reeds are vi- brate.d. rapidly; and i11 the brass section, long metal tubing is used to matlipulate columns of air in or- der to give them their deer>, bold sounds. In describing two differ- ent instruments, tl1e violin and the flute, we can see that e-ven though they may seem to be ve1y differ- ent, in principle they :u:enot. A vio- · linist uses his how to make a par- ticular string vibrate. while at the same time lengthen it1g or shorten- ing the string to cause the pitch to · rise oi· fall respectively; In the same way, a flutist will lengtl1en or shorten the air column, Qr a pia~ist will strike longer orshorterwites .. A II of this creates the Slime effect on the various instruments.

. ' Rushmore Rushes into Union Student's Home and Heart by Daniel Pesikoff Contributing Writer I>uririg winter break last year, my :m<Jther received an interesting note in tbe door. A scouting agency -wanted to look at our. house as a JlOSsible set for a movie. They re- tu.:med a couple of times and finally tile director came to scout the llouse and mi;\ke the fmal decision. The amusing part about all this is 1hat the director was a best friend with my brother in high school. He ](:)ved the house and a few weeks later they began shooting. Wes Anderson, a native of H<Juston, directed and co-wrote his flrst film with his college friend ()wen Wilson. Bottle Rocket was an independent film but with the lJelpof James Brooks, was picked up and re-released by one of the 1liant production companies. The second film on Wes' plate is en- titled\Rushmore.\ This time, Wes signed on with Touchstone Pic~ tures, a Disney company, and be- 1\an production in the fall of 1997. \Rushmore\ is the tale of a Max Fischer, a high school stlldent at Rushmore, (ak.a..Wes andrny alma mater in Houston, St. John's School) who pl!rsues every pos- sible activity: editor of 11u year- book, founder of the glee club, founder of the fencing club, and Max yet in younger tenns. The other person whom Max be- friends is Ms. Cross (Olivia Will- iams) who is a new elementary school teacher at Rushmore. Max falls in love with Ms. Cress and while heeldlibitsmany mature ten- love with Murray's character. The film., though released by Touchstone, still has a very dis- tinct ftavo! of originality to it, so often forgotten in ·Hollywood to- day.

Kappa Alpha Hosts an Evening of Poetry This Week on Campus, by Kimberly Rohback A&E Editor Intellectualism at Union College is not quite dead. On Friday, Janu- ary 15th the Kappa Alpha Literary Society hosted its frrst poetry read- ing <>f winter term. Poets and po- .etry aficionados from all overcam- plls gathered in the living room of the KappaAlpha hollse in order to share and appreciate the art of po- etry. The evening was introduced by Aaren Hatalsky '99. Hatalsky ex- plained the only rules for the evening. Anyone who wished !O share either an original poem or one tllat they were particularly fond of, first had to remove the \writer's cramp\ from the game of\Opera- tion .. ' that lay before the lectern. She then proceeded to read the cards that the game was played with. They all had mocking capi- talistic undertones, w~· .;h set the mood as casual, wann, and &iendly. The poets read from a table adorned with candles while their au die nee sat on couches· and chairs enjoying the \coziness\ of the room. Hatalsky was the first t() read. She shared two <Jflter own p<Jems f(Jlbwed by a favorite of Whitman. Other readers :included: Seth Madi- son, Matt Aron()witz (of tile famed \Aronowisms\ column),. Josie Gluck, Dave Iv.tartin, Jackie Eatz, Shme Aldrich, Brooke Alkon,. Col- leen Reilly, Jay i<>ri, and U11ion's · own- Professor Jenkins. 'The subjects of the poems ranged from experiences at work <>ver winter break to the human C()llfrontation of the env'iro1111lent. Others shared theirexperiemt:espf having spent a tetm elsewhere (i.e. York), while some approaclled the lectern with a great sense er c<Jme- dic flare. All ofthepresenters were welcomed by a ftiendly an.d open audience, rnaking for an environ- ment that was conducive to the sharing oftlte. deepestofthoughts yet light en()ugh to laugh when laughter was,called for. When ask:ed about the motiva- tions ~ehind the Poetry Readings, Kappa Alpha member Seth Madi- son commented, \I don't know how to explain the purpose of the readings, they're just a lot of fun, and it gives you a chance to hear people doing what they do.\ Gina LaSorsa commented \It is nice to spemlaFridaynightdrmk- ing a beer a11d listening to my fel- low classmates share their work.\ Becki Danchick said\ It was a nice and wei corned change to Friday night.\ The KapiJaAipha Literary Soci- ety plans t~ hold rnore readings throughout the term, the next of which will most likely be a Profes- sor Poetry Night. Everyone is en- couraged to participate. \' Courtesy of Newsweek Magaine The opinions in this review. do notreflectthoseof Concordiensis or its editors \What Dreams May Corne\ is a noble but supernaturally dull movie. Chris (Robin Williams) is a doctor, his wife, Annie (Annabella Sciorra), a painter. They ar~ wealthy, rapturously in love and have two great kids. EarJy on in Vincent Ward.' s movie, Chris and Annie l<Jse their children in a terrible accident. Annie blames herself and goes within inches of crazy. Chris's love redeems her, but then he dies in an accident. The good news is that every- one gets to choose his own heaven and that Chris's is one of Annie's canvases. The bad news is that there's an angel (Cuba Gooding Jr.)ushering him around and dishing out metaphysical ·crapola. Before long, Annie kills herself, and suicides go to hell. Chris refuses to believe he'll never see his wife again, so he heads south on a rescue mission. Will- iams gives an ov~rly sentimental perfonn.ance here--.,-his own wife is -an artist3 and you get the sense that this movie is a bit of a love song for him-. but Sciarra seems con- vincingly raw and adrift in the world. \Dreams\ remains an impossibly remote, self~serious movie. And, unlike with other boring movies, you can't wish the characters would go ahead and die because they're already dead. \What Dreams May Come\ is playing Friday through Monday in the College Center Auditorium, at 8:00 and 10:00-admission is free.

Last Saturday they took on division rivals Hartwick and Springfield. The fmal scores were Hartwick 137, to Union 106, and Union 164.5 to Springfield 66.5. The Dutchman went into this meet with confi- dence. The Hartwick team was es- pecially strong this year (defeat- ing Union rival Harniltonearlier this month), but they had not beaten tile Dutchman in the last eight years. where Faulconer hit the pad at 1:56.94. It shmlld also be noted that Dave's time made the national B cut which is the first national qualifica- tion time for the team this year and also Dave's first in season strong swim in the 200 breast with a2:20.68. Head Coach Judy Wolfe had a few comments on the day; \Over half <Jf aur swims we:re in sea- son best times including five per- sonal records. I was extremely pleased by the performance of the ' '\\' coaching staff worked endlessly throughout the meet providing constructive criticism and more importantly altering the line up during the meet to pick up points where they were desperately needed. The manager must make sure that, even in the chaotic and day out year round for the few seconds or minutes where they need to make a difference. Win- ning a dose race is more than be- ing a talented athlete, it's about fo~us and preparation; making sure you're warmed up properly, that your heart rate is up when you get on the block, and tltat every- thing is in place.

Everyone counts in a close meet. A late injury and scratch of pri2ed sprinter and All-American Junior Bill Flick did Rot help the situation and tensions grew as the start of the meet approached. All- American Captains JeffHoerle ami Dave Searles kept the peace in the locker room with their leadersltip experience. The meet started out with a considerable bang; the D11tchman took first and third in the 400 medley relay getting a con- siderable jump up on Hartwick. The warriors crawled back into the race taking first, second and third in the 500 free. Senior JeffHoerle then won the 200 free with a time ()f 1 :48.07. All-American Junior Pete Hllmphries had an outstanding 50 free time taking second with a 22.85.

The Hard Work and Dedication Pays Off For Women's Swimming by Rachel Bukowski Contributing Writer On Saturday, January 16, the Union Swimming ancl Diving Du1chwomen took on Hartwick and Springfield Colleges in their first double dual meet of the season. Last year, the Dutchworrien de- feated their longtime rival, Hartwick, with a score of 138-103 and were looking to continue their winning streak in this meet. The meet was e:xtremely close, with each team switching leads after almost ev- ery race, but in the last two races, Hartwick and Springfield both pulled away to defeat Union, 130-109 and 140-102, respectively.

On Tues- day night, Ralph netted Union's only goal on an unassisted break to briefly tie the game at 1 before U-MASS Lowell slowly pulled away for the win. On Saturday, Ralph once again scored Union's lone goal against RPI in their 4-l loss. In .doing so, Ralph prevented RPI goaltender Joel Laing from breaking former Union standout Trevor Koenig~s ECAC record streak of scoreless J minutes. Jason's fourth goal of the season ended Laing's scoreless streak just L: 13 short of Koenig's record, thus keeping the Dutchman in the record books. Union had relied on specific goal scorers throughout the season, but Ralph's perfonnance this past week shows th.at he can score against top notch teams andthis is an abil- ity the team hopes will shine in the future. The Du.tt:hmen will skate against Army Friday night at Achilles Rink.

She led her team to their fttst back to back conference wins this past weekend, scoring .16 points and seven rebounds verse Skidmore. On Saturday, she was once again the high scorer with 17 points to go along with nine rebounds versus Hamilton. The previous two seasons have been billed as rebuilding seaso1}s. This year, however, the team possesses a number of v~terans that, along with their new freshmen have the ability to post the Dutch women's best record ever.

The truth is that none of the current crop of players has anything dose to .Magic-Larry-Michael appeal any- way. There are no worthy stars around whom to peg the next ad- vertising campaigns. When a few emerge, then we can talk. If Jordan is around to prop the league over the next five months, the powers that be might be fooled into thinking that noting is wrong. The nth is, however, that a great deal is wrong. Why did so many people profess indifference during - the lockout? The answer was obvious, even though no one wants to hear it. People were indifferent because they had come to realize that dur- ing tb.e past few years, the games were essentially boring. The inac- tive, possession-oriented 80-76 games in which neither team at- tempts more than 75 shots are a massive turnoff. If Jordan was not there to author an athletic poem, the game lacked redeeming social value. So let's get on with it. What last- ing good would come of having this abbreviated season once again constructed around Jordan? If one ~nan is so disproportionately important to the league's financial health, then it cannot possibly be a league worth saving. Short term, sure, having Michael Jordan back would be a good thing. But long-term? Nah. He doesn't need the aggravation, and he serves his league best by leaving it.

J:1son Ralph rrnvidcd the only offensive power the team could muster. On Tues- day ntght, Ralph netted Union's only goal on an unassisted break to briefly tie the game at 1 before U-MASS Lowell slowly pulled away for the win. On Saturday, Ralph once again scored Union's lone goal against RPI in their 4-1 loss. In doing so, Ralph prevented RPI goaltender Joel Laing from breaking former Union standout Trevor Koenig's L:CAC record streak of scoreless , minutes. Jason'::, fourth goal oflht: season ended Laing's scoreless streak just I: 13 short of Koenig's record, thus keeping the Dutchman in the record books. Union had relied on specific goal scorers throughout the season, but Ralph's performance this past week shows that he can score against top notch teams and this is an abil- ity the team hopes will shine in tbe future. The Dutchmen will skate against Army Friday night at Achilles Rink. Dutchwoman of the Week Leah Olivieri Junior Leah Olivieri, in her second season as women, s basketball team captain, has been displaying why she is such a valuable component to her squad. She led her team to their first back to back conference wins this past weekend, scoring 16 points and seven rebounds verse Skidmore. On Saturday, she was once again the high scorer with 17 points to go along with nine rebounds versus Hamilton. The previous two seasons have been billed as rebuilding seasons. This year, however, the team possesses a number of veterans that, along with their new freshmen have the ability to post the Dutch women's best record ever. Thus far, the women are 6-6 overall, but 2-1 in their conference. Fortunately, the majority of their remaining games are conference games, thus leaving the team's fate in their own hands. The Dutchwomen tip off against William Smith on Friday night and Hamilton on Saturday night in the Memorial Field House. This Week In Union Athletics , '. , , .

It used to be seen as a blessing because the west coast ofPeru and Ecuador nevet received any rain and, thus; their crops suffered tre- mendously.

The Blue Light emergency call box system bas been installed on campus to provide instant emergency communi~ation to campus security for all mem- bers of the campus community \in the event of an emergency.\ When the system is abused by deliberate misuse; as oceured over the weekend, safety· and security is ~om promised. Legitimate calls for serviee have to wait while the emergency call is atte11ded to. If the problem pe.rsists, regardless of how dedicated the officer is, tile offieer may believe the call to be another prank, when in fact an emergency exists. I don't want to see this happen and will · caution the officers regarding their appropriate resp()nse to Blue Light calls. I am asking the community to act resp.()osibly, to help us in our efforts to protect the community and to report any abuse or misuse of the Blue Light Emergency Call boxes. Announcements Dear Ca-mpus Community, Vandalism is a problem which hat; plagued'tl1e Union cam- put; forfar too long. What .the mlE)ori(y ofstudents may not know is that we are all payingfor the damage done by the thoughtless, irresponsible few. Tltr~ugh higher tuition each Union student is suffering the consequences. The Student Eo- tum, disturbed by th~:se acts, is taking steps UJ curb the ra$h of vandalism on our campus~ Tlte$.e acts are unacceptable and will no longer be tolerated. Offenders will be met with swift and severe punishment under tlte newly proposedguide- lines. It is the duty and responsibility of each and every Union student to respect and maintain tlte campus we call home. Therefore, it is the responsibility of each student to refrain from committing these acts of vantfttlism. Equally it is each student's ·duty to report witnessed acts of vandalism to the proper authorities. Each year, money is added to each t;tudent's tuition to cover vandalism costs. The responsible majority should no longer tolerate the disret;pt!ctful actions of the irre- sponsible minority. Through greater awareness, we can· all maintain and care for the caniplls JVe call home. Sincerely, The Student Forum Please stop by the College Center Atrium next week to learn more inform a ... tion about the cancellation of the Dance program. Look for signs for the time. An ad hoc committee ha~ been formed to consider the tenurability of A.T. Miller, Assistant Profossor of History. The committee members are ·Erik Hansen (History),. Byron Nichols (Political Science), Harry Marten (English), and Jay Newman (Physics), Chair. Any member of the campus commu- nity wishing to offer 111ritten or oral testim-ony con- cerning Professor Miller's teaching, scholarship or college service should contact Professor Newman (x6506, newrnanj@union.edu) or any other member of the committee.

I ' I i i Campus News C!I.nttruxbiensis• January 28, 19919 • Page 3 Recent Incidents Challenge Campus Security dents get lost in. A man was caught peeping into women's showers in Alumni Gym in the SpringandFallterms of1998. And justthis term, five men forced their way into a room ·on the f'Irst floor of Richmond Hall as the residents slept. What occurred in these three instances and what is being done to prevent them from happening again:? On October 8,. at approximately 10 PM,. a female student was walk,. ing alone in the dark c!Qrridor be· tw.een South College and Silliman Hall when a man grabbed her and \accosted\ her, according to the letter .sent to the campus by Frederick Alford, Dean of Stu- dents. She was fortunately able to escape r-elatively unscathed. The attacker also escaped before he could be apprehended; From the description given to Campus Safety by the victim, it is believed that the attacker was not a member of the campus commllllity. The clothes he wore along with his age led the student to make this as- sumption. In response to this incident, the administration sent out the above· letter, whi~h provided tb.e details of the :event as well as the pre• sumed precautionary measures students should ta}(e. In addition, a bright light illuminating the path where the attack took place was in- stalled, so that the chances of a similar attack occurring on that .pathway are reduced. Thankfully, incidents of this magnitude have not recurred The next series of events dates back to Spring term of last year, on April16. At9PMinAlumniGym, a female student reported that there was a male trespassing in the women's locker and shower area, to the shock of the student. This was the last of such incidents until September 30 ofFall term, when a nearly identical incident took place at 11:40 AM. Then, on November 11 and 16, this incident occurred again~ to the dismay and horrorof female gym-:goers. On January 4 ofthis year, Bill Scanlon, direct~r .oflntramurals and Recreation, no- ticed a \suspicious person re- ported previously loitering\ in the wet passage between the locker rooms and the entrance to the pool at 1:30PM. OnJanuary 8,. Scanlon reported a \suspicious male in the lower level of the gym.\ To prevent future incidents like this, a card access system was in- stalled in the women's locker room in Alumni Gym. To enter the locker room, visitor11 must trade theiJ: ID cardsattheCage for an ac~ess card to put into the lock. Without this access card, it is impossible to en- ter the locker room, Also, the locker rooms have been clearly la- beled in the wet passage, to pre- vent .a confused visitor from acci- ... continued.frqmpage 1 dentally entering the women's room. Judy W()lfe~ Director of Aquatics, was impressed tile way the incidents were ha11dled. \The response was very ,quick/ she said. Witll regard to the new card access system, she said, \The ac- cess cards are a v-ery g()od solu- tion. It makes it inccntve11ient for the wome11 on tile s~irn team, but the inconvenience is certainly worth it.\ The only remaining con- cern slle had was ttte J>Ossibility that a bystander in the weight room could see through into the shower area when the do()r is opened. \I wish they could do something about'-ihat.\ The first weekend' of Winter Term, as the campus C()Inmunity now knows, tworesidentsofRich- mQnd were the victim of attack by five males, including a former Union student and four visitors, whe forced their way into a first floorroom in Richmond. The five males gained access 1<> the dorm when two residents Jet them in. Criminal charges have been .filed against the five suspects, but some of the suspects have left tile state, and the possibilities of a lengthy extradition process are Cllrrently unknown. The SPD would not comment on fue ong()ing investi- gation. In response to thi.s event, Union has taken many precautions to make Richmond Hall safer. An alarm on the front door was installed before last weekend that is triggered when the :front door is· open for more than twenty sec- onds, .preventing outsid~rs from entering the building via a propped open door .. Additionally, all ()ther doors in Richmond to the outside have been equipped with crash bars that will set off an alarm if used. These alanns will be acti- vated shortly, according to Facili- ties Manager Dave Gryzbowski. Aside from this, Residence Life has encouraged all RA 's. in Richmond to approach suspicious persons tlley see and to ask what they are doing. No plans are in place to al- ter the current Campus Patrol Sys- tem or to replace it with the system that was previously used where a guard was stationed at the front desk ofRichmond and all non-resi- dents had to be signed in during evening hours. The system was giving residents a \false sense of security,\ according to Alford. The Campus Patrol System has offic- ers patrolling all of the residence buildings and walking through each building six or seven times a night, according to Director of Campus Safety Bill Sickinger. \We're using the same means to achieve better ends,\ said Alford. \I think it's working better,\ here- plied when asked how he thought the system was functioning. If stu- dents have problems with the . college's budget:img, Alford re- ferred students to tlu Planning and Priorities CommitteCJ and its student members, Julian G-oldstein, Dave Weiner, and Mark,NfcKee. Also, the Studemt F' ()rum partici- pated in a \Campus Walk About\ on January 13 :tCJ' alert Campus Safety ofproblemissues on cam- pus. As a result of:tf:Jiswalk about, Student Forum Jlrresident Beth Wierzbieniec sentadetterto Dave Gryzbowski listiilg thirteen prob- lem areas on camptas, tllat need at- tention. Almost all <Jftbese issues dealt with lighting,. either where lights were non-filnctional or non- existent. Wierzbieniec also cited the danger a victim would face, if attacked, by runnill.g o.n the slip· pery pathways. Gl)\zbowski con- firmed that these areas needed at· tention, and that they would all be dealtwith. Someh.ave aheadybeen taken care of, butmaJlyofthe light- ing issues could not be llandled under the ground thaV~s to allow a light to be installed. One precaution tll:atboth Alford and Sickinger rein.fmce<l to no end was student respons·ibility, and how far a little preve.ntion would go. \Students have to realize that their safety is depe11dent on tlleir actions,\ Sickingers:aid. \The big- gest precaution the. students can take is to be responsible and to think about their actions,\ Alford said. Weather P·attern Stumps Scientists Jackson Tickets Available time period beginning about 5,000 years ago, there are a series of light-colored sediment bands that occur approximately every ten years or less. The bands contain debris, mostly inorganic material washed from the slopes of nearby mountains, which would flow into the lake during periods of heavy rainfall or flooding. These condi- tions were most likely triggered by ancient El Niiio events. \We didn't know exactly\what we had,\ noted Rodbell. \When we took this core, we thought the light-colored striations from th.e landscape and flood eventS were very pronounced and unusual. We called them 'zebra stripes.' At the time, we were more interested in the climate change associated with the last ice age, but in the hack of my mind I wondered if these patterns were somehow connected to El Niffo,\ Noting that more work needs to be done, Rodbell indicates that this sample suggests that dttring the past 5 ,000 years, ElNiff.o occurred every two to eight years, which is the same frequency we see in mod- ern times. The sample also sug- gests that El Nifio was weak or non- existent between 5,000 and 12,000 years ago. The information discovered in this study is published in the Janu- ary 22 issue of Science magazine. Rodbell is the lead author of the piece. His co-authors are Newman, now at Humboldt State University taking classes in preparation for medical school; Geoffrey Sel1Zer of Syracuse University; David ,, •.• continuedfrompage 1 Anderson of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Mark Abbott of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; and David Enfield of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorologi- cal Laboratory. This study- even in its prelimi- nary stages- h~s generated much excitement among scientists world- wide who are attempting to dis- cover more about El Niiio and its causes. Understanding this phenom- enon could aid in predicting it and therefore, fmding ways to quell the damage it now creates. Professor Rodbell was recently awarded $90,000 fr()m the National Science Foundation t() ccntinue his investigation of the clilnatic record preserved in sediment cores from other high-elevation lakes in southern Ecuador. He will·travel to Ecuador again this summer~ joined by two or three students, i11 hopes of collecting more data. \Everyone wants .to ktlow what will happen in the futtlre 'With glo- bal warming,\ noted Rodbell. \From this discovery, we realize how complicated th1n~s rea.lly are. This study raises rn()re questions than it answers. Bu:t that is excit- ing because it means that there is even more to do no~.\ Professor Rodbell explains some detail~ of his fintifllgs. by Gina Campanella Staff Writer For those of you who do not know, February 1 marks the start of Black History Month. In honor of this important month of recognition, Reverend Jesse Jackson has been invited to Union College to speak to the campus community. The speech is being sponsored by many different campus organi- zations. These include; Speakers' Forum, the History department, the Africana Studies department, the Political Science department, the Alliance of Latino and African American Students (ALAS), Minerva, and the lntellectual En- richment Grant. The event will be held in Me- morial Chapel and seating will be limited. The faculty ofUnion College will be able to purchase tickets at five dollars a ticket; two hundred and · fifty tickets will be made available to them. The faculty can pick their tick- ets up in the Central Scheduling office on the fourth floor of the campus center. The students will be able to pick up one free ticket in the campus center beginning Mon- day, January25 from 11 to 2 PM. Tickets will also be available Tuesday through 1'htusday at the same times. However, it is important to re- member that tickets are limited to six hundred and fifty so,make sure you pick one up earl)'! Although the speech itself will not be open to the pul>lic, there will be a reception afterwards that will be open to the campu..sc()mmunity as well as the pub1ic. 011edoes not need a ticket for this teception. . Hemwatie RamllSami, President oftheSpeakers' F0ru111 has worked very hard to bring a speaker of Reverend Jackso11\s stature to campus. . A title for his speecl11las not yet been formulated; fl()wever it has been suggested that 11e will speak about student activism on the col- lege campus. Ramasami is happy with the pub- licity surrounding this event. As of Monday, look f01r tll.e posters which she promise:svrill be cover- ing the campus center walls. Still need incentivCJ to attend? It is rumored that Jaeks()n is consid- ering a run for the pr~sidency in 2000. Those who do not kn.ow much about Jackson or his beliefs could fmd the speecll verr informative.

As we approach the 21& 1 century, eur world is becoming more inter- related and countries can no longer affordte act independently. They must adapt to the in~reasingly con- nected global environment. Edu- cat()rs. across the country realize the need to prepare their students for the future, when they will be requued to work in the global mar- ket. PJ;ofessor Bill Thomas, Union's tetnls abroad director, believes that \futernational exposure, and cul- ture are part of one's education.\ This is a belief echoed by the stu- dents at Union as well. Marin Richardson, a physic.s major \.Vho took a term abroad in France this past fall stated, \you can't learn about another culture by sitting in a classroom, you have to actually be there and experience it. It's part ofleaming, you can't understandth.e world ifyou don't go out and see it for yourself.\ Union has become a leader among American colleges, expos- ing undergraduates to different countries. The college was ranked 14 by the Institute oflntemational Education among allbachelors' in- stitutions in the United States with the large number of students it sends on terms abroad each year. Currently, 55% of all Union stu~ dents Jlafticipate in the thirty term {!broad programs that Union offers. These take students anywhere from Kenya to Japan. Uni()n'sterm abroadprogram be- gan ill the spring of 1969 with a tenn in Vienna. Since that time Union has created some unique programs wltich have been emu- lated by other colleges. One example ofthisistheHealth Systems program Union created in 1977 which takes place during the summer. Students travel through- out Western Europe visiting hos- pitals and health care centers in order to learn about other coun- tries' health systems. There are several other unique options that Union offers such as the Barbados Educational Studies exchange program and the Fiji re- search program. A new feature ofUnion'sdesire to expose students to other cul- ·tures is that it now requires all en- gineering majors to have an \inter- national experience.\ This can be a term abroad or working on a project in conjunc- tien with students from another country and then traveling to that .country in order to complete that project. This is unusual because accord- ing to the Institute ofintemational Education, only 2% of all students who travel abroad study engineer- ing, yet here at Union that number is obviously much higher. Currently, the area Union is most interested in is exchange programs that would bring more international students to the campus. This. would help diversify the current student body and allow a student 'File Photo Five Union students recently e11joyed time in Greece. here at Union to learn with some~ ene not of their culture without leaving the country. Union will continue to expand its international program as the new millennium approaches. Professor Thomas stated that he \encourages as many (students) as [)Ossible\ to take a term abroad. ln- t~riJational experiences are essen- tialto <me's education, especially with the rise in interdependency l>etweens countries, and Union silldents will be among the best ()nes prepared to work in this envi- r<Jrunent.

At a tournament at Amherst Col- lege in Massachusetts, Union kids wh<J were brave enough to risk driving through bouts of freezing rain \'itll yours truly were intro- duced to the basics of Parliamen- tary Debate by some of the best teams in the nation. Competing against Stanford, NYU, and Yale, to name a few, Unio11 students held their own in their initial attempt at demonstrat- ing their ()ratory abilities. For th<Jse who are unfamiliar, Parliam(}ntary Debate is a style of debating largely different from the case-111etltod which, as the name suggests, involves the preparation of cases prior to the tournament. Parliamentary focuses on ex- temporaneous speech and the for- mation of a coherent argument witl1il1 a short period oftime with no previous preparation. ToJ)ics can cover anything from phi1()SOJ>hical issues to current events, making a broad range of knowledge especially useful. The foc1.1s is on the speakers overall education, rather than his or her abil it)' to research specialized top- ics. Here's how it works: A resolu- tion is announced fifteen minutes prior to the round. One of the two teams c<Jmpeting is designated the Government, the otlter the Oppo- sition. The Government must take the resolution and link it to a policy it will proJlose, a value judgment, etc. Durirlg tile Govemrnent~s presen- tation of their case, the Opposition must listen to the argument and construct a cased against it by showing that what the Government's proposition is flawed in S()me way ()r unneces- sary. 1'he team which presents ih~ .. , most so lid; logical, and often e11.:. tertaindllg case wins the round. Arriving at Amherst, we were informed that the \The Thundercats\ was the theme of the tournament. For tllose of you who are unfa- miliar with this television show (or who have mentally blocked it out for ()bvious reasons), the Thundercats was a popular 80's cartoO>n about a group of mutant cats from outer space who have taken it upon themselves to fight the forces of evil. The Union Crew was told that they n<eeded to choose a name off a list <>f \Tltundercats\ characters for their team. Am()ng th<Jse left was \The Constricting Pit.\ Realizing the metapbor between this and their appe.rent lack of experience was too go()d to pass up, they selected it and were ready to begin. Typically, after teams are paired; the resolution is announced. At this.parti<:uJartoml).ament, the reso- lution was a video clip from the \Thun<lercats.' 1 These are a few ofthere~olutions we encountered over the coruse offive rounds: - '\If you were as mean as you are ugly,.then you'd be trouble\ - \Rules are only meaningful if people a,greeto follow them. Oth- erwise, tbey 're just words\ - \Sna.rt: Snarf. 'Never had any use for c<>urage myself, it just gets them as has it into trouble\ How a team will turn this into a case is anyone 1 s guess. The Union opponents developed the first' resoluti()n into the statement \The Conne<:ticut Blue Laws Should Be Repealed.\ The otber Unionteam, acting as Government in this round, chose to argue against the death penalty. As it was tightly constructed and welJ.presented, their case led them to a victory over Columbia Univer- sity. There were three rounds on Fri- day, which lasted well into the night. Afterwards, the team was invited to the Lord Jeffrey Inn, a beautiful colonial restaurant in Amherst, for dinner and to relax. Though they were exhausted, this was a great opportunity to socialize with the other schools and pick up some pointers on the skills of debate. Despite the intensely competi- tive atmosphere, which prevailed during the tournament, everyone seemed pretty laid back latr;;r that evening. . val is planned for Feb. 5 and a for- mal on Feb. 6.

Alternative Medicine: Not What It Appears to Be by Brian Roache Staff Writer Are you stressed out? Do you reject western medicine? At Union College the answers to these questions is probably not, but if you say yes to them, you should have been at Old Chapel on Friday night.· The Student Activities Program As:sistants invited Donn Jay Wiedershine, M.D. to Old Chapel for a workshop on the alternative medicine he practices. Wiedershine, who was formally tmin~d in the United States, went to India to become more experi- · enced in Maharishi Ayur-Veda health care. · \Conventional medicine only 'band-aid's' the ailment,\ said Wiedershine. \Our methods treat the entire person.\ As he describes it, by treating the entire person instead of simply the area that is having difficulty, the patients will require fewer vis- its because their overall health is improved. Through herbal treatments, Tran- scendental Meditation, and most .importantly, a body.;type balancecl diet, Maharishi Ayur-Veda is a ho- listic approach preaching no side effects and an overall increase i11 health. The diet, which can be 'pre- scribed' by a properly trainedphy- sician, is designed specifically around the patienfsspecific body type, Vata, Pitta, Kapha, or anY' combination of'the three. If a .pa,- tient is lacking in V ata, Pitta,. <Jr Kapha, a diet .can be designecl. which will increaSe the lacking pavt to create homeostasis, and ac;;- cordingto Ayur-Veda, homeosta- sis is perfect health. Throughout the workshop, Dr.· Wiedershine made some stark comparisons as well as contrasts to conventional medicine. The as,. pect of holistic care, which he preached the most, was that his care is 100% free of side effects. When he asked the group how many of them had suffered side effects from conventional medi- cine, the majority of hands we11t up. As the doctor explained it, con- ventional medicine isolates certain molecules found in nature, and uses them to treat illness. How- Paul D'Au nibale/TC Students listen to Dr . .Wiedershine explain his techniques. ever, by isolating these molecules, the medicine is taken out ofhomeo- stasis, which is why people suffer side effects. Dr. Wiedershine says that humans can still use the mol- ecules from these pla'!ts, but they must use the whole plant, in its ho- meostatic state, to be totally healthy. When the doctor was asked what he could prescribe for the ailment that plagues most college students, no, not hangovers, stress. The doc- tor, thrilled with the question, re- marked that stress kills. Stress re- lated deaths do indeed outnumber cancer. To combat stress, Dr. Wiedershine's clinic would pre- scribe the Transcendental Medita- tion technique. Through a series of charts and graphs, Dr. Wiedershine demonstrated how this technique, used for twenty minutes- twice a day, dramatically reduces stress. Many students began paying closer attention be- . cause they were victims of chronic stress and were hoping to find out what method was used. Unfortunately for them, Dr. Wiedershine was not about to re- veal his wonderful methods to a room of people for free. Here's the catch, your Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) doesn't cover this type of care, so dig into your pockets. The doctor was asked just how much it would set someone back if they decided to free himself from the scourge of stress. The stress in the room doubled when his re- sponse was heard. It is $165 for the initial visit and $90 for each of the four follow-up visits. That is not a high price to pay for good health, but if you want stress to be gone, get ready to relinquish over $345 to learn the Transcendental Medi- tation technique. So, ifyou ate tired of the waiting room at Ellis, and you've got some spare change, visit Dr. Wiedershine up on Union Street. If not, keep taking the aspirin and let your Pitta get out of whack. Tune in next week as the Stu- dent Activities Program Assistants bring you the celebration of the Water Is an Integral Part of All of Our Lives h'_l v by Shaun P. Monmna Staff Writer Water. it's everywhere. It sur- rounds us........especially in the win~ ter in its frozen form. W.e all use it every day for cook- ing, cleaning, drinking, bathing and recreation. Everyone loves to va- cation near water. It is a fundamen- tal part of all our lives. But what happens when that water is un· safe? What h!:!.ppens when you can't make use of it the Way you'd want to because of someone else? This year's Environmental Studies Pro- gram Seminar explores what hap- pens when water gets mixed in with the law. . Professor John I. Garver, Dir~c­ tor of the Environmental Studies Program and organizer of these talks, said, \these talks focus on th.e big picture ... the driving force here is this seminar series involves not just the scientific aspect of water, but the social and political issues surrounding water use.\ He encourages students and faculty from all disciplines to at- tend, stressing \there's something for everyone in these talks, and these really are campus issues, things that affect every one of us.\ The key to this series is that wa- ter i,s a fundamental. part of ALL our lives, and affects everyone, not just scientists and lawyers. These talks are org ·nized around that key idea-· there's.~vmething for every- one here, from ecor..omists to lov• ers of the outdoors to even hope- ful Hollywood directors and pro- ducers. Forexarnple ... The movie A Civil Action,. star- ring John Travolta, is based on the best seller of the same title, and in it, Travolta plays lawyer, Jan Schlichtmann. Back in 19 86( Schlichtmann was ili.e lawyer for eiglit families in. what'becaiile a fa- mous case~ The families lived 'in WBburit: Massachusetts :whetie · ~ - ' ' . • I • there. was a small· area with· a Very hi~ inCidence ofleukemhi'in'chf:l, dren and adults~ The caus~ of the h:ukemia was thought to be con· taminated groundwater used by the residents.

But ·what if you couldn't make use of the water for recreation? Ami' t the rivers open for everyone? On Wednesday, February 23~ at 7:30PM in the Nott Memorial, at- . tomey William S. Helmer will speak on the famous \Moose River Case.;' The case involves this simple fact: times change. In July 1991, , five boaters canoed down a twelve- :mile stretch of the Moose River that runs through property owned by the Adirondack League Club. The trip started and ended on public property, but small obstructions forced the canoeists to go on the Club land to carry the canoe around obstacles. The Club promptly sued the boater for $5 million. The key to the suit is a 19th century law involving \navigability\ of waterways in the Adirondacks. The Club contends that ruling against them will result in the tremendous decrease of property valaes across the state and may affect over 20,000 miles of privately owned waterways. But ruling in favor of the club may af- fect the rights of people simply looking to traveldown a river from one end to the other for recreation. If you canoe on watetways in the Adirondacks, you should be thankful that the Club lost the ap- peal. The final talk, which also hits close to home, involves the incred- ible story of land use and water rights surrounding Great Sacand·aga Lake. In the early 1930's a dam was built on the Sacandaga River to ease flooding on thelowerHudsonRiver. Now, almost seventy years later, numer- ous secondary and tertiary inter- ests have taken the forefront in a complex case surrounding a river, a dam, and a lake. Dr. Willard D. Roth, Professor Emeritus of Bioi- ogy, will speak on Tuesday, March 9 at 7:30PM in the NottMemorial, discussing.the conflicting interests ~nd varyiug yiews involved. Over the· years~ numerous permanent homes, as well as summer camps and s~mer homes, hav_e grown up around the lake. Normally these homes are either on the lakeshore, but during time of low flow and high use the lake shrinks and the shoreline is a long walk away. Other people are inter- ested in how the water is used. On occasion, water from the lake is used to flush the Hudson River clean when saltwater intrudes the estuary as far north as Poughkeepsie, which uses the river water as a source of drinking wa- ter. Without the use of water from Sacandaga Lake, they will have to come up with different, likely more expensive, ways of desalinating their water. An important part of the contro- versy is the regulations of flow over the spillway. Niagara Mohawk has a power plant at the outlet to the Lake, and therefore water supply was critical to power generation. For relicensing of the power plant, the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee required a water qual- ity assessmep.t. This requirement, and the follow- ing public hearings, demonstrated just how many interests were in- volved. These include the inter- ests of a number of towns, two counties, the NY DEC, the Adirondack Park Authority, Na- tional Fish and Wildlife agency, and a host of organizations interested in land use and recreation. The result: one big mess. The settle- ment of the case is currently in progress, and Roth will provide a perspective as the President oft he Lake Association Hope to see you there!

enabLeD Seminar Provides Much Insight about Learning D;isorders by Erin ConncUy Contributing Writer On Friday, January 22,. a moti- vated junior named Jordan Lippman presented a panel on teaming disabilities and ADD in the college campus center. The small crowd was enlight- ened by a range of speakers. The highlights of the panel were Dr. Possin, Faith \Green and Attorney DavidGlass. Dr. CarolPossin, who is currently a vital support contact for students at Union with LD or ADD gave a hypothetical scenario which covered many of the ques- tions held by LD and ADD stu- dents. Her subject was named \Jack.\ \Jack who had been a very bright student in high school, new found himself slipping in his classes at college. Dr. Possin commented that \Jack\ could be suffering from many different possibilities. One could simply be the adjustment to college life, which could be ad- dressed by talking with his Resi- dent Assistant for a counselor. If this did not help, on the other hand,\ Jack\ could have an LD. Dr. Possin said that in cases like \Jack's\ it is important for these students to get in touch with the proper people. A good place to sta11 would be \Jack's\ academic .atlviser, who could introduce him to the people that are qualified to t;e~t for an LD or ADD. Early detection of an LD or ADD i!l1ows the student to start learn- ittg value stages for success. Dr. Jl<Jssin also addressed the issue of whether or not students with an LD should be attending a college such as Union? Dr. Possin stated that she has \never met a Union C0llege stu- dent who should not succeed.\ Slle used Lippman as an example of how an LD student can be suc- cessful with the right stargazes for him or her. Faith Green, currently a gradu- ate student a Virginia Tech fo- eussed on the teaching ap- ~roaches and what the individual student can do for himself. Green stated those students with LD or ADD's best weapon is being a self- advocate. The student needs to k:now what he or she needs and h.as to be able to ask for it. Unfor- tunately, too many students feel ashamed of their LD or buy into :!he myths ofLD. Students with an LD are not lazy, crazy or freaks. LD students can face a great n1nge of challenges such as \bril- liant verbal reasoning, but spells Paull>'A.nnibale/TC A panel explains learning disabilities to an interested crowd on a fourth-grade level or insightful class participation, but leaves the last half of the exam unanswered.\ (Dispelling the myths: College Stu- dents & Learning Disabilities- Garnett and LaPorta). Green stated that some useful strategies for dealing with these challenges are asking the professor for a lecture outline ahead of time and using a tape recorder in lecture in order not to miss any important information. Also, note-taking pares are a good way to make sure one has all of the information and un- derstand it. Highlighting one's notes also allows for greater understand- ing and easier studying for ex- ams. sAttomeyDavid Glassrep- resented the legal rights ofthose students with LD and ADD. Glass has struggled with his LD for many years. Due to the fact ofhisslowreading ability, he has had to take all major exams untimed. After completing Law school at Albany Law it can be time for him to take the bar. He applied for the normal untimed testing standards and was turned down, because the New York Board of Law Examiners did not think that an LD was really a disability. This catapulted him into a crash' course with the Americans with Disabilities Laws, which states that \no otherwise qualified handi- capped individual shall solely by reas~n of his handicap, be ex- cluded from participation in, bede- nied'the benefits of, or be subjected to disc:dmination under any pro-· gram ot activity which receives or benefits from Federal fmancial as- sistance.\ (Section 504 of the Re- habilitation Act of 1973) After ptoving that an LD was truly adisability,he became a cham- pion of LD rights by beating the New York Board of Law Reviews. He passed the bar untimed and is now saccessfully practicing law. Yet, Attorney Glass best de- scribed what living with a LD was like v.rhen he said, \ I may be. an attorney, but I would spell that word wrong 9 out of 10 time if I didn't bave spell check.\ LipJ>man's panel illustrated that having an LD or ADD does not make one predestined to be unsuc- cessful In fact, there are many new ways of dealing with an LD and ADD. Union college is standing at the door-way to the future, and thanks to Lippman bringing the is- sue{>fLD and ADD into the open, all U11ion students will be able to benefit Enviro~mental Studies Program Presents Series Regarding Lakes Talks Made Possible From Generous National Science Foundation GTant by Shaun P. Montana Staff Writer We have aU used lakes for recre- ation at some point in· our lives. Ever thought about the possibility that a lake could kill hundreds of people not on it? How about a lake serving as a historical record, or as a preserver ofhistory? The fact is, lakes have done these things and more. The Environmental Studies Pro- gram has organized a series of talks regarding lakes and the many dif· ferent ways they can be viewed. The talks have originated in part due to a four hundred and fifty thousand dollar grant ftom the Na· tiona! Science Foundation. This grant was awarded to foster inter· departmental collaboration, says Professor John Garverofthe Envi- ronmental Studies Program. The grant has also resulted in a course entitled Lakes and Environmental Change, which is taught by three professors: one from Geology, one from Biology, and one from Civil Engineering. This is, according to. Garver, a new approach to how we teach, and also a new way oflearn-· ing for students. Twc of the talks will focus on this class and the re- search that has been dcne arouncl its focal point, local Ballston Lake. The lecture series has been struc- tured to maximize overlap betwee11 scientific, social and political is- sues, Garver relates. The first talk in the series was held last Thursday in the Oli11 Building. Garver said there were about 40 people in attendance, a11 even split between faculty and stu- dents. We were pleased with the turnout, and hope more will come to() the next talk. The talk began at SPM, following refreshments 5;ervedat4:30. ThetopicwasLake Nyos, a crater lake lo.catecl in Cameroon, Africa, that was one of many studied by Dr. Curt Stager, in themid-1980's. Dr. Stagervisited the lake twice-once in 1985 when it was a peaceful body of water, and then again in late 1986, after it had killed almost 2000 people and thou- sands of animals in the area near the lake. How does a lake kill that much life? In the talk, Dr. Stager basically covered how one billion meters of carbon dioxide was suddenly re- leased from the depths of Lake Nyos in Cameroon. The surrounding area was about a mile lower in elevation than the lakr, and the carbon dioxide spread quickly, killing 1200 people in the village of Lower Nyos. It spread tllrough the valley, killing more than 500 people in other small vil- bges. All animals in the surround- ing area were killed almost in- stantly, but all the plant life sur- \ived. Plants need carbon dioxide 1() photosynthesize their energy, and the increase was not hannful 1() them. Animals, including hu- mans, need oxygen from the air, and the heavier-than'-air carbon dioxide pushed the air aside, basically as- phyxiating the animals. Some people survived the horrible or- deal, and between their reports and the visible evidence, scientists were able to piece together what they believed happened. The cause of the release of the carbon dioxide, however, remains a mystery. Its sour~e is believed to have been the bottom of the lake. All lakes experience a phenom- enon called turnover during the spring and fall seasons. Basically the sutface water and deeper water are at different temperatures, d~­ pending on the time of year. In spring and fall, cooler surface waters sink, and wanner deeper wa-: ters rise, resulting in the lake turn- ing over. This sometimes kills many fish, but has no affect on humans.,.. Except in the case of Lake Nyos, when this turnover is believed to have released the carbon dioxide. It may also have been triggered by un- derground tremors; scientists are uncertain. A small number. of gassy crater lakes like Lake Nyos exist in the world, but scientists find it un- likely that many store such huge deposits of carbon dioxide. Besides the loss oflife, the deaths of so many had a large psychologi- cal impact on the neighboring tribes and villages. When scientists first studied the event, they discovered that many tribes had old myths tell- ing stories of angry lake gods and demons who took their anger out on the people. This provided interesting infonna- tion to psychologists and anthro- pologists studying African tribes, on the potential effects natural di· sasters can have on such people. Defmitely an interesting subject, for people interested in not just sciencel but also history, anthropology, and sociology. This past Tuesday, January 26th at I 2:30PM in Bailey207, Professor Peter Tobiessenofthe Biology De· partment gave the second talk, en· titled Bacterial Ecology: From Oce- anic Depths to Ballston Lake. This talk dealt with a layer in lakes known as the chemoclime,.which is the tem- perature layer between the cooler and wanner waters .in a lake. The third talk has an interest- ing historical twist tg it. The title is The Evol11tion. and Sedimen- tary RecordOfLake Champlain, Vermont, given by Dr. Patricia Manley ofMiddleb\.}ry College. It will be on FebruarY 4th, a Tues- day, at 5:00PM in Olin ll5, the site for all the talks except the second. · Whife Or. Manley will discuss the lake, the talk will primarily fo- cus on the discovery of Benedict Arnold's !>oat at the bottom of the lake perfectly preserved, by Dr. Manley and colleagues dur~ ing their research. She will also speak on recent efforts to have the boat salvaged for donation to a museum. Tuesday, February 18th is the date for the fourth talk, Records ofClimatic Change from Lakes in the Caribbean Region and Impli- cations for Human Culture. Like Dr. Manley's talk, this one has a historical significance. In addition, it also. carries in- terest for anthropology, archeol- ogy, and politics. Dr. Jason Curtis of the University ofFiorida will speak on the demise of the Mayan Culture based on infor- mation on climate change found in lakes. Coincidentally, Vice President Al Gore,. before b~ing elected, cover this topic .in his bookEartll in the Balance : Ecol- ogy and the Human Spirit, won- dering if the environment could provide any insight to the end of the Mayans. Talk number five will deals with Paleoclirnatoiogy of The Tropi- cal Andes: The Record from Lake Titicaca(Peru/Bolivia). Tuesday, February 25th, Dr. Geoffr¥Y o. Seltzer of Syracuse University will talk <ln the research he and Union's Professor Donald Rodbell con- ducted on lakes in South Am eric~. Titicaca is the highest large lake in th.e world and its record is pro- viding scientists with new informa- tion regarding climate changes in the past. This data could possibly be used in the same way as the data Dr. Curtis developed regarding the. Mayan Culture, and could perhaps also. be ased to predict future cli- mate changes. The sixth talk covers Mercury Cycling In Lakes,. basically the pol- lutioll of lakes by industry. Given by Dr. Elizabeth A. Henry ofExpo- nent, a Schenectady company, it will examinewhatGarvercallsaNew York Pollution Story. It will be held on Tuesday, March 4th. The final talk will be on Thurs- day, April 29th. The conclusion to the series brings it back to the be- ginning. Professor Paul T. Gremillion of Civil Engineering will talk about the research done on the Sediment Record Of Ballston Lake as An Archive of Water Quality. This will be the first public pre sen· tation of over two years worth of research conducted by Union stu- dents and faculty from various dis- ciplines on Ballston Lake. All talks are free and open to the public. They start at SPMl with re- freshments served at4:30. All are in room 115 of the Olin Building. Garver hopes the talks will provide a more in-depth picture, where before a geology person saw just one part and a biology person saw only another and someone else saw only another. Take the time to attend this great series of talks covering a wide range of academic subjects. g, ·-· s. th~ \\V( he pl; 111' ca sc pi de.: H de Cf th to m 01 ti· w h· h d T n d v ;,

While the body receives Voice Recognition . ' Software by Daniel Kella manovich Stqft'Writer Have you ever wished that yollr .computer could understand what yol1 were saying? New software on the market is making this dream a reality, The two newest programs that allow for voice recognition are Via Voice by IBM and Na tu.-ally Speaking by Dragon systems. Both of these software titles <Jl- low for fairly accurate voice recog- nition. Voice t·ecognition software has been around for many years. but these new releases offer en- hanced accuracy and many mme options. There are many advantages tc using voice recognition software, The main· advantage is that it al- lows for easy input of text. The lat- est 'versions ofthese types of soft- ware allow the user to speak almost continuously while the computer types the text. This is a big benefit for people who cannot ty.pe quickly. These pmgrams also allow us- ers to give the computer com- mands. These commands can be used to start programs, edit text, and even move thii1gs around on the desktop. Using voice com- m'ands makes interacting with the computer rnucl1 faster. However. these programs do have some dis- advantage. The main disadvantage of using these programs is that they require a lot oftimeto make the computer understand the usel\ s voice. The program uses specific characteris- tics of tile user's voice and pro- nunciation to try and understand what \vords are being said. This requires that each user have a specific setup so that the pro- gram will be ab I e to understand his voice. To allow the program ro un- derstand the specific user's speech patterns, it is necessary to undergo a training session. The training session consists of the user reading several para- graphs of text while the computer attempts to correlate the speech patterns and pronunciation with the words. Training requires ap- proximately 30 to 50 minutes. The accuracy of the program is greatly enhanced after the training ses- sion. Another disadvantage of using these programs is that they do make many in istakes dudng the first few uses of the program. As the user uses the program more often, the software further adjusts itself to enhance recognition. Therefore, tl1e more mistakes the program makes, the more that it learns to correctly recognize the speech. The newest' voice recognition software titles also require a lot of processor power. The minimum re- quirements are usually a Pentium 166 Mhz even though a Pentium 200 Mhz or above is recommended. Another drawback is that the programs require a lt)t of hard drive space. That average space re- quired can exceed 200 megabytes. The software is als() fairly expensive ranging ti·om $70 to over $200. There are also many different options that come with each soft- ware package. ViaVoicecomes in a home, office. and execlltive edi- tion. The only differences are mi- nor add-on applications that allow for more control over the software. Naturally Speaking also has simi- lar versions available. Overall, voice recognition software is improving but still has some ptoblems. This article was typed using IBM's ViaVoice soft~ ware. Having experimented with the software. I find it to be a use- ful tool and something that every user should have. Voice recogni- tion software will change the way that people interact with · computers.

This search lasted no. m()re than 65 minutes, accord- ing to the report. The decision was made to replace alllocks.and cores on campus. Starting on January 13, a full seventy-seven days after the keys were lost, all locks and cores in residence buildings were changed over a week-long period. College official> cited insurance difficulties and bickering with Tucker's Launclry Service when asked about the two-and-a-half-month delay between when the keys were lost and the locks were replaced.

The administration is also guilty ()f severe procrastination in dealing with the incidents in Alumni Gym. The first case of trespassing in the women's locker room occurred in April of last year. Similar incidents regularly occurred over the following eigltt and a half months. No action was taken until the beginning of tlds term. This is a disgrace.

The administration has not done all it cilll to protect the residents of Richmond from an incident identical to tile one that occurred on Janu- ary 10. It only makes sense to place a security guard at the front desk of Richmond. Dean of Students Fred Alford said that a guard at the front desk of Richmond \would have been another checkpoint\ that could have prevented the attack in Richrn()nd on the 1Oth. Alford in- sisted, however, that there is a limited badget, and we could protect students by placing a guard in every dormitory on campus, but finan- cial constraints prevent such drastic measu.res.

Last week, we received a phone call from \John\, a stu- dent at Union who apparendy just wanted to talk to someone and as we give out the station number a few times per hour, he decided to caU us and chat. At the end of our conversation, he told us to dedicate a love song to ourselves because we \sound so cute on the radio.\ Now, that request cannot be cat- egorized as terrorizing, it is actu- ally flattering. We began to fear him when he decided to call us every twenty minutes to see how we were. He begged us for our last names- presumably to look us up in the face book and went on to tell us some story about how he lived in Pittsfield, MA. By the way, \John\ if you are reading this, you're stupid. time. I think that's the point. wall. The first show we ever did had But, the other night while I was a number of problems.

However, we still had a problem. As soon as we are on the air, we affect a bizarre accent. Itisamix ofBoston and Alabama; I cannot understand it.

I have struggled record, but it gives the guys some- thing to make fun of for the rest of the show. If we were to institute a similar program, I wouldn't have to talk about all of Bob's faults and traffic violations to enter- tain our ten normal listeners. Bob thinks that she has a good voice, but in reality, sfue sounds like a cow, chewing its cud while it is being stabbed and giving birth to a cat.

Fifty Fun Things to Do in an Elevator As You Plummet to Your Death by Lis Kidder Opinions Editor For those of you who haven't taken your life in your hands by riding a Union College elevator, consider this article fair waming. The elevators at Union are a death trap. Two specific elevators come to mind, when one thinks of easy sui- cide methods. The first is the elevator in the campus center. This elevator con- tains numerous defects, such as a third floor button that never lights up and a peeled off sign which used to indicate the emergency phone. This elevator is almost al- ways doing something mysterious and frightening. It started off the week with a bang by getting trapped on the second floor and sending an ear piercing alarm through the campus center. Steinmetz is the proud owner of the second elevator from Hell. This elevator is so scary that many fac- ulty members would rather walk up three flights of stairs than brave a ride. It periodically makes terrifying sounds and shakes violently when travelling between the second and third floor. Why are there no inspection cer- tificates in these elevators? Couldn't they at least afford a sign that says, \The scary noises and sparks are just an illusion! They're part of a new ride we're trying out for our new on-campus theme park. You're perfectly safe, re- ally!\ In honor of our fme elevators at Union, here is a sample of the wonders contained in the list Fifty Fun Things To Do In A Union College Elevator: 48. Give the rest ofthe scream- ing passengers nametags. Insist that your name is, \Aaargb we're going to die!\ WearyourJ)ametag upside down. 32. Bring a scale. When the el- evator reaches a free-falling veloc- ity of 87 feet per second, weigh yourself. Laugh at the passengers who believe you really weigh 12 pounds. 27. When the elevator gets stuck between floors, sing the Alma Mater backwards, \Stream sacred his of dream Grecian the let!\ while giving the other passengers menacing looks. 22. Shout, \''m having a mas- sive heart attack!\ Follow through on your claim. 19. Wear a puppet on your hand and talk to other passengers \through\ it. Repeat the q11estion, \Is today a good day to die?\ until someone hits you. 17. Bring a parachute. Just be- fore the elevator crashes, scream, '\Bombs Away!\ and pull the cord. 12. Offer to listen to other passenger's final confessions. When they begin talking, stick your fingers in your ears and shriek. 9. Say, \1 wonder what these do,\ and push all the red buttons. Cry when they don't stop the speeding box of death. 5. Bring a box filled with per- sonal effects. Label it, \riches for rny tomb\ in blue crayon. Com- pose a last will and testament on one side in green. 2. Yell, \Nooooo! Don't do it!\ When passengers board the eleva- tor. Repeat, \I told you so, I told you so,\ while you lie in tile rubble with the other victims Ulltil you lose consciousness. Laughter is the best m.edicine, next to morphine, which you will probably be taking to manage the pain. Remember, if you can find humor in any situation, you will live a better life ... or die a better death, as the case may be. Olon.cori'rittui£S ·January 28, 1999 · Page 9 Procrastination Is an Art Form by Michelle Smart Contributing Writer Last night marked my first ad- venture into essay writing this term. I was forced by rny history professor to write an essay on a book I never read. I don't under- stand these silly assignments. I got an early start, because I knew this essay would be espe- cially difficult. By three AM, I had my name and the date written at the top of a Microsoft Word docu- ment. Fly fingers fly! I suddenly realized that I had a mission of vital importance to complete. It was three-thirty on a Sunday night; time to recall and transcribe all of the state capitols. I had some trouble with a few. For example, I tried to make \Pierre\ the state capitol of Maryland, Wis- consin and Delaware, but I used my trusty encyclopedia to remedy the situation. A little after four, I decided that it was about time for a topic sen- tence. I summoned all my strength and opened up computer solitaire to help me think. Fifty-five games later, I had my first sentence, \This novel explored a wonderfully in- tricate time in American history in which the sweet land of liberty prospered with pride and tradi- tion.\ I should win a Nobel prize for essay writing. To reward myself for my effort, I popped a bag of popcorn and watched one of my favorite infomercials. Inspired by the drama, I wrote my second sen- tence, \During this age, Americans wished only to buy fast, because supplies were limited and they didn't want to miss out on the deals of the century, all of which were just $19.95 plus shipping and han- dling.\ At this time I realized that my room was in great need of a dif- ferent arrangement. I pulled out my tape measure and began work on a floor plan.. By six o'clock I figured out the optimal arrange- ment for my furniture. I then wrote my third sentence, \Most Americans lived in houses, (unless they were poor and could not afford one) which contained furniture that was probably not arranged very well since they didn't have tape measures back then.\ It's odd, the things you discover aboat your roommate at six-thirty in the morning. For example, my roommate apparently hates Dave Matthews. When I popped in their new CD and began singing harmo- niously along with Dave, she sat up and screamed, \I hate you! I want a divorce!\ and threw her alarm clock at me. I turned off the music and con- tinued with my essay, \Because there were few laws protecting women, domestic violence was rampant during this age, unlike today, in which there are many laws which are particularly harsh when it comes to assault and bat- tery with an alarm clock.\ Upset by my run-in with my psycho roommate, I decided that I needed a way to calm down. I left my dorm and watched the sun rise, as I ran naked around the Nott. On my third lap, I had an epiphany, and ran back to my dorm to work on my essay, \Many Americans were naked under their clothes, which gave them a common bond; they were all 'Vulnerable people. They worked together to form a more perfect union, which is also the name of the college I now at- tend. And bee a use l Jive in America, it means that I can read this novel and feel the strength of those naked Americans from so long ago.\ I felt a rush of satisfaction, for I had completed my essay. The long hours of procrastination had paid off. I recommend this strategy for the many challenges which life presents. Union's Ride Board Up and Rolling by A. Chaucer Contributing Writer Winter term at Union is prob- ably the most depressing of the three by far. Especially with the assault of bad weather that has stricken the region, this term has been especially dreary. So when it feels like you've been placed under a dark cloud and you haven't seen the sun for weeks, and you just want to &et away from the doom, the light at the end of the road may be found on the Union College Ride Board, pre- sented by the Environmental So- ciety.

If only the student body under- stood how lucky we are. Union Coll'ege, located in a venue that would include such curinary ma: chines as Scotti's, Fireside, Gepetto's, etc .. stands far and above as the grandest eatery in all of Schenectady. There are so many choices: Dutch or Rathskellar. Upper Class or West. Vending machine or convenient shop. The thought of such an as- sortment of goodies makes me wonder itTm in heaven. Let us begin with West, dubbed as the training grownd for the Union palate. With constants such as the pizza and pasta bar, as well as the sandwich center, all the other sectors ofthe cafeteria always have a creative and new feel to them. The carving section supply's our eager tummies with meats and cheeses from across the land. Thou shalt not forget the main area though, where greats like Veg- etable Medley Quiche and Turkey Cutlet have made their start. As good as West is, we must keep in mind that it is just a stepping stone to the next level, the cafeteria up in the clouds, Upper Class. Words can110t fully explain the \vay a sophomore feels the first time he steps in to this bastion of fine foods. The meats are meatier, the sauces are saucier, and the salad bar is a smor~asbord of healthv ~ ' delights that \Viii make you want to take all of your clothes off and run around a six teen-sided build- ing.

Allyield to the omni- present being us laymen like to call: the Rathskellar. The cavern- ous pavilion tucked away beneath Old Chapel holds scrumptious se- crets far too crude for the refined man. You don't even want to know what I would do to a chicken parm sub and a chocolate milkshake if it were in front of me right now. Un-Christian things indeed. Ask Jim down at the ''Rat\ why people flock to tl1is under- ground palace of goodness. He won't be slow to mentio11 the new chicken steak sandwich. or the new combo meals.

Conduct Charges File<! ariel Stu- dents put to death. . . · · · . by Jon Tapper give up-TI1is is the motto of the For those of you wondering what happened to my column last week (I know this only applies to two or three people. bt1t bear with me). it's really a simple explana- tion. You see, I have come to the conclusion that ifl don't have any- thing important to say, I am not going to fill my spot with mind- less crap for the sake of filling space. Rather. I will pass rny slot along to someone who actually has something to sa.y, as I did last week when Jim Owens took my spot. I think the rest of the writers of this fine piece ofl.iterary genius should fo II ow my lead and only write when they have something rel- evant and/or interesting to say (you know who you are). Union Students never cease to amaze me. Today, while waiting in line to receive my fi·ee tickets to hear the Reverend Jesse Jackson speak, I overheard some disturb- ing conversations. First of all, I was shocked to find out that half the people waiting in line had ab- solutely no due who Jesse Jack- son was. Which leads to my next question. Why would you wait in line for tickets to hear a lecture about sornething you have 110 clue about? It aJI comes down to the typil.:al Union College students answer, \'it's a status thing.\ That's right, just like everything e]se that everybody does on this campus, they are doing the right things for all the wrong reasons. Th.ey are not going to hear Jesse Jackson speak because he happens to be a great political figure in this c<>untry and the best speaker that Union College has attracted i.n years. But rather they are going because there is a line, so the prod- uct must be worth it. It's kind of . . like how attending hockey games is apparently not as \cool'' as it \Vas last year. They can't give those tickets away (but that's an- other story for another time). Not including a small amount of. people, most Union Col1ege sru- dents are mindless idiots walking around doing the will of one or two people on this entire campus who can actually think on their own. Seriously folks, does it have to be an event when you actually have an original thought go through your head? Oh and for those of you still reading to find out who Jesse Jackson is, I don't have the time ,to explain it - and you don't have the brain power to understand it- so what's the point? Go to the lecture, or better yet, do some background research on your own (I know, that's a scary thought) to find out the answer to that riddle. Moving on. I don't really have too much to say other than that. so I might as well just end this article rather than ramble on to till more space. As always, all constructive criticism is welcome.

Features by Heath Fradkofl' St(ljfWriter When asked, Michael Forman says he's m consulting. That's his little joke. On a train bound home. for Bos• ton from New York, I folllld my- selfsitting n~xt to Wendy Bishop. We quickly bonded in alliance against the woman seated behind us- she kept peering over the seat . instigating conversation even though I obviously wanted to sleep and Wendy just wanted to enjoy the window view. When this woman finally bid us farewell somewhere ,in Connecticut, Wendy and 1 shared a silent sigh of relief. I don't recall how old Wendy had said she was- somewhere in her fifties, I suppose. She was headed up to Vennontto get some respite for some physical- and ap- parently spiritual- illnesses she had incurr~d. In the midst of our con- versation, we paused as our ears :focused on voices in the chairs ahead of us. Wendy was actually the :fll'st to take interest;. sQmething that was being said gripped her in a way I couldn't immediately fol· low. She stepped in when th~ir dis- cussion turned to spiritual healing and a ceitairl healer in particular. I just listened. Micnael introduced himself for- mally after answering Wendy's question. Reclaimed to be in the same line of work as the healer they had been discussing but in a moredirect, less academic way. In short, Michael works for God. Retold us just how he came to be in his current occupation. Af- ter years in the business sector of Los Angeles, Michael had been struck with an unknown, unex- plainable illness and an insatiable desire to head out to a place called Sidona, Arizona. Feeling the full brunt of his ailment and believing that tllere may be no other alter- native, he placed all his belon[.· ings in storage. and headed out for the Arizona heat to pursue his In the past few days I have con- sum eel more food, run more miles and screamed at more people than I ever thought possible.

Then Michael turned his at- tention to the rest of us who had been listening. I offered some in- -formation, asked a few questions, as did the man seated next to him. A woman in her early twenties who had been straining to listen from a seat across the aisle came over to sit three abreast with Wendy and me. Yes- three strangers sitting snugly in two seats on a train lis- tening intently to the words of a man who claimed to be God's go- to guy. It was a bit strange. In the same light, I found it to be mov- ing and captivating. Whether or not Michael was what he claimed to be, he had in- stigated a conversation between five people. Michael and his co- passenger, Wendy, the young woman, and yours truly had never previously met and were now pouring out life stories to one an- other. To say the least, it was a touching event. Michael carried a little bag of trinkets to hand out as gifts. I still b.ave the quartz crystal he gave me. When the memory of that expeti'- ence comes to mind, I often won- der if it was at all real. I wonder if Michael Forman (though I took notice of his last name \For\- \Man\) was for real. It is very possible, I suppose, that he could have been nothing more than an eloquent, learned indi· vidual who, from unknown pres- sures, had been shifted just a bit offhis rocker. I realize that.

I don'tknow how much longer I am going to be able to sustain this level of stress. I am assuming that at some time I am either going to have a breakdown or will have eaten myself to the point wllere I am bedridden and am incapable of doing anymore work. This is all thanks to my sick de- cision to take four classes this tenn along with being Editor-in-Chief ofthe paper and participating in the Rush process in my house, I am in a constant state of agitation, afraid that I arn: wasting precious time and am consequently always on edge. I have forgotten how to relax, how to have an enjoyable weekend, and. how to have a calm conversation without a hundred pressing cir- cumstances running through my mind. My schedule is hectic and brain is in overload. It is amazing all of the things stress can do to someone. This in- tangible concept that can't be held, seen or felt is the cause of major difficuJties in so many people's lives. Withollt stress, a college stu- dent would never get things ac- complished, but maybe then they would l>e a bit healthier in mind and b()dy. It is so strange how ev- erything s~ems to rush in at once. We <:an have periods of calm coasting, only to be bombarded one vveek with three exams, meet- ings every night and two papers to write. It is almost as if the pro- fessors convene at the start of each term and synchronize their syllabi in order to arrive at the most stress- fully .entangled mixture of exams and class a;ssignments to torture all Union students. I suppose it may be better to get it all over with at once, bat right now there doesn't seem t() be an end in sight. So, if y<>u see me hysterically laughi11g i11 some comet of the college center with a supersize bag of Dorito's in my hands ... don•t worry abo\lt me. I'll be past the . point ()f saving. The stress will have taken me over by then. , Co11tinueil from Page 9 the weekend, or if you want to visit a friend, this might be the way to go.

Some carpooling advantages are: -Financial savings due to shar- ing commuting costs -Increases free time for riders -If a High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane is available, trips may take less time -Reduces pollution due to auto emissions The Ride Board was designed for Union College students by the Environmental Society, in hopes to add a new service to the school for all to use.

My strengths arc abstmclt verbal reasoning, but it is extrenndy difficult for me to do the initial processing of written language. 1 must read each line a few times before I understand what it says. lrt is also difficult for me to produce coherent written represen- · tations ofmyknowledge and ideas. When taking tests. I produ.ce im- pulsive responses. I must reanalyze and revise every answer to build a ''good'' answer. Bringing up the appropriate information needed to answer test questions takes a long time, and that is why I get extra time on my tests. Jesse, what if, g- d forbid, uncontrollable circum- stances made you unable to see, should society change their ·expec- tations of your performance? If your disability were to prevent you from leaming and taking tests. why shouldn't alternative testing condi- tions be utilized. so your knowl- edge and not your disability were evaluated'? Jf!sse: Jordan. I kn.ow you are very bright and intuitive. However, these skills are only a few compo- nents ofintelligence. The abilities to work quickly and effectively are just as important in the realm of academics. No matter how much intelligence you possess, if you cannot apply your skills, it does not make you an ideal student. Union, as stated before, is an in- stitution of higher learning. One ofthe aspectsofUnionthat makes it a desirable coHege, is that not ever)'One can attend here. '!fa stu- dent cannot keep up with his or her peers in the dassroo111. per- haps Union is not the ideal col- lege for him or her. This becomes relevant in ligiH ofthe factthat we are on a trimester\ system. The quick pace in tbe classroom would only add more stress for a student who is having trouble keeping up. JQtdall.' Unio11 is hard for leam- ing disabled students. Even with the a eadem ic adjust111 ents pro- vilded to Union students 1vitl1 dis- abilities, the playing tield is not equal. Nevertheless. when I ar>- plied to Union I made il clear that I had LD and ADD and that I wanted to come to Union to be challenged and to become more disciplined. I· have come a long way since my freshman year, as those who know me can verify. I have Wot•ked and worked. but still I have not reached my academic potential. Over the winter, l was re-diagnosed tor learning disabHi- ~ . ~ ties. and now I understand 1ny aca- demic strengths and weaknesses.

To fa~i litate communication be- tween Union's students with LD/ ADD and to spread awareness about challenges facing them so that the academic playing field is leveled, we have begun an aca- demic support group called. enabLeD. At the first meeting of enabLeD, on Wednesdav. JanLJarv ~ . .; 13, about fifteen people shared very similar stories about their struggles at Union.

I was happ_y to see about 45 people at the panel discussion. l-lopeful.ly the lives of students like me will be improved, because a little bit of understand- ing can go a long way. Although many members of the Administra- tion were i.n attendance, only two or ,three faculty members were in the audience. I sc;;nt out emai'l, voice mai.l, flyers and letters to the faculty asking them to attend the panel discussion. and to inform their classes.

\ J Spotlight on Ari Gottlieb: A Star of the Yulman Rising by Kimberly Rohback A&E Editor Ari Gottlieb. The name has be- come practically synonymous with theater at Union College. If you have yet to see him perfonn, clearly your appreciation for the dramatic arts at Union has been under.de- veloped. Gottlieb had taken to the theater as early as middle school. He participated actively in his middle and high school theater pro- grams,. while developing a particu- larly close relationship with his di- rector; Diana Canterbury. \She had a lot offaith in me. She is/was my mentor.\ Throughout his high school years, Gottlieb developed a passion for the perfonning arts. The aura of superficiality and hurt feelings that often SUI'I'ounds young actors as they struggle through auditions and perfor- mances began to distract Gottlieb from the thrills and excitement he had once enjoyed. Gottlieb be- came disenchanted with the the- ater. When applying to colleges, he selected schools reputable for their strong science programs. He entered Union as a biology major. As a freshman, Gottlieb at- temptedto concentrate on his aca- demic endeavors, but tbe lure of the theater, attracted him to the auditions for Noises Off \It was the worst audition of my life. I blanked halfway through it. I was surprised I even got called back.\ Gottlieb was not cast in the show. \In retrospect, I guess it was a good thing. It was humbling and it was bound to happen.\ After the audition, Gottlieb be- gan to seriously considering trans- ferring. Professor William Finlay changed his mind. He advised Gottlieb to drop his biology courses and to start taking theater classes. Finlay also cautioned against transferring to a school that strictly specializes in the dra- matic arts. \There is nothing worse than a dUillb actor,\ said Finlay, referring to the important role that a liberal arts education plays in the development of a petformer. Fall term ofhis sophomore year Gottlieb auditioned for Equus. This would prove to be a decisive influence in his career path, and an unforgettable performance. Gottlieb was cast by guest direc- tor, HelinaBinder,.as Dr. Dysart, the lead of the show. \This is the show that I look back on most fondly.\ Gottlieb not only gained a tremen- dous amount of experience from the show, but broke through his slump in performing. Winter term of his sophomore year, Gottlieb starred as Prior, in Amelia Teasdale's production of Angel's in America. \I loved that show. It was a departure from any- thing I had ever done. Prior was not a role that I am usually cast in.\ Gottlieb met the challenge of portraying a homosexual man dy- ing of AIDS with tremendous tal- ent and a great degree of profes- sionalism. Gottlieb was next cast as Leonardo in Finlay's pr.oduction of Blood Wedding. He had been cast as the sexy Spanish lover of a young peasant girl. \I had grown a bit of an afro at the time. It was very hard to look sexy with a Chia- pet growing on your head.\ His junior year started with a stellar performance as Trigorin in visiting director Sara Chazen' s pro- duction of the Seagull. \It was great to work with Sara,\ said Gottlieb ofhis former director. \She focused on everybody's acting- it was great to work with a real actor's director.\ given an opportunityto work with · In the Winter term, the Yulman the best actors and ,diFectors.\ Theater was gracedwith the direct- Gottlieb was afforded the chance ingtalentsofWilliamLacy-anex- to work with John Barton- the pert in Shakespearean perfor- greatest living teacher of mance.

After having observed his 11umerous performances and hav- ing been lucky enough to petfonn along side of him, this editor can truly say that Ari Gottlieb is not only talented but a beautiful per- son, and we all await the day that we see his name in lights over Broadway ... or wherever life takes him.

Dining Out With Gina LaSorsa by C.in 2L~Sorsa Staff'Fv.r-irer Last term was a sacl one for this beloved column, .B()oillofourfabu- lous A&E editorrs, I<im Rohback and Lori Green, were away in Ja- pan.

The .cfrive was only about fifteen to· tvle11ty minute~ long, and we listemed to some great tunes to pass the time. As a side note, I suggest liste~ing to The Wedding Singer!;omdtrack( espe-. ciaUy track sevem) dlll'\ing any ex- cursionyou miglttt>e-taking. This soundtrac·k mak::e5 everyone happy. Also, if yo11 pliin on dining at Sitar, it is best tllat you do not wear jeans. Thi$. (foe; not imply, however~ that youmn~twearyour favorite cocktail ])arty get-up. A pair of nice pants an<la sweater or shirt will suffice. Sitar i::; an ae~tlt'tti~ally pleasing restaurant, andth~ a3!nosphere was enj{)yed by all. n~ ills ide of the ·restaurant is accented by a tradi- tional Indian sty ]e. 'The service was not above or bel()waverage,how- ever, I suggest allocating a decent amount oftime if you plan on din- ing there. Whileolll' appetizer was quickly brought oat to us, we had to wait a good !tlll()unt oftime be- fore the entrees atrived. We started aat the meal with papdum·, which are large crispy wafers that,comewith a green cllut- ney sauce for dipping. We also tried las_si, whicb is a yogJJ.rt drink made with milk md mango. Siraj, who helped us .arder, suggested that we order a fe\V entrees and all share them. We decided on the Tandoori Chickenfor.$f3.95, the Chicken Tikka M!lllsala for $14.)0, tb.e Shrimp Massa[afor$16.50 1 and the PaneerPalakf<>r$10.95 .. Each entree came with a sideof.plain rice <>r nan, which is an Indian bread cooked in a clay oven. The 1andoori chicken consisted of a whole chicken, Cllt and mm:inated in yogurt and mild spices. The chicken was then charcoal broiled 1naclay oven. This was, perhaps; my favorite entree. The chicken was really tender and flavorful, and it was not the least bit slimy or greasy. The C.hicken Tikka Massala was the same type of c:hicken, cut up into small pieces and cooked in onion and tomato gra'Vy. The Shrimp Massala was shrimp cooked in onion gravy and mildly spiced. The Paneer Patak, whicb was Siraj's favorite, con- sisted of Indian homemade cheese, cooked with spinach and was also mildly spiced. There were no com- plaints from anyone about the food, .and our dinner consisted of a wide varietyofthe items offered on tlle menu. It should also be mentioned that Sitar offers a range of chicken, lamb; beef, seafood, and vegetarian specialties. Also available are a variety of rice dishes and Indian breads. If you are legal or if you just have a really good I.D., then you. may indulge in some of Sitar's alcoholic :beverages at . your table or at their cocktail lounge. While the dinner was a bit costly, it was not ridiculously .priced. I suggest it toanyone who enjoys Indian food or to anyone who is eager to try it. I also sug- gest ordering a few entrees and sharing them as we did. That way, you are able to try a Uttle bit of everything and you can just sp1itthe bill. Sitar is open seven days. a week, and take out orders are available by calling 456~6670. Overall, l .rate this restaurant as being()ne of the best I've been to inthearea. ,4 murthT mysteT:Y 6y Alan Bryce ~ /C' LVes Chaln Dumplimg Eating Contest At Chet's I Wrote Them All for You A&E's FYI by Kimbelrylt.l)llback A&E..Edf.t~r · This coming W~e<lne!iOday Chet' s and Thurston .H()USe C~re co-spon- soring aChinesedllliJ.P'ling eating contest.

/ World News . ·~. ·'.! -· President Clinton Pushes to Save Social Security by Charlie Tuthill StaffWriter On Thursday, January 19. Preside.nt Bill Clinton pushed his controversial plan for Social Security in State of the Union address. The plan would revolutionize the Social Se- curity system. Clh1ton aides believe that it would keep Social Security from going bank- rupt in the next 75 years. Social: Security is expected to .go into debt in the year20 13. In 2013, :taxes that pay for social security, will no longerbeabletocover monthly payments. Social Sec~:~rity's trust fund will be depleted by 2032. according to cxpe1is. The Clinton adm inistra t.ion wants to save Social Security. In his State of the Union address Clinton declared that ··even today, without Social Security, half our nations eld- erly would be forced into poverty.\ Clinton's plan to save social security is controversial. He plans to utilize the budget surplus in or~ der to revive the system. Last year's the budget surplus was around 70 billion dol- lars. The Clinton administration waAts to in- vest up to60 percent ofthe surplus budget to revive social security. It plans to do this over the next I 5 years. A porti·o11 of these funds will be invested in the sto()k market. The plan would devote an estimated 2. 7 tri11ion dollars to Social Se- curity. 650billion to 70()bi.llion would be invested in the stock market. Clinton eco- norn ic advisor Gene Sperling called the in- vestment \a very. very conservative amount.'' Investing in the stock market is a dra- matic change in the social security system. Payrolt taxes have traditionally paid for so- dal. security.

They oppose government investments Democrats in the House of Representa- in the stock market. The Business Roundtable is an organiza- tion that represents the major corporate lead- ers of America. They have openly expressed their dis,.. agreement with the plan. If.l a letter, 'the group stated that \direct investment tuns contrary to the fundamental princ.iples of democratic capitalism, and would result in undue con- centration of assets in certain ma1:ket seg- ments, share-price distortion, and market inefficiencies.'' The Business Roundtable warns that government investments in companies will gjve the government more power in how companies are ru:n. The group fears \tile potential for political invest'ing.\ The AI li- ance for Worker Retirement Security agrees. The alliance is a coalition of U.S. corpora- tions. Coalition director Leanne Abdnor stated that \government ownership ... is a mock- ery of the principles on which this country is founded.\ She believes that the govem- Jnent has no business investing in the stock market. President Clinton's plan also has support- ers. They argue that investment in the stock market will not be political. A New York Times editorial points out that Greenspan criticizes investment in the market; he be- lieves that it may turn political. The mticle argues that \Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board al'e them- selves a testimony to the ability of Congress to create an administrative body insulated fi·om politics.\ President Clinton's plan has many sup- potier and many opponents. The issue )las not yet been debated in Congress. Both sides still looking to gain popular support. The issue of Social Security reform is far from over.

The new heir. 36 yea!' old Prince Abdulla11, is a career soldier who leads Jordan' S· elite Special Forces. Although Abdullah has sh:own little political interest in the past, ana- lysts and diplomats said that his high rank and poptdarity within the Jordanian military and Jordan's Bedouin tribes would ensure a smooth transition of power in Jordan. which shares borders with Israel as we.ll as Iraq, Syriai!nd Saudi Arabia. Abdullah .is Hussien's son from hjs sec- ond marriage, to Princess Mona. the former Tony Gardiner, who was English. Abdullah attended military school in Englandandthe United States, but has kept close contacts with his peers in the Arab world. He is mar- ried to a Palestinian woman. There was speculation that a younger son Prince Hamza would be selected as crown prince. Haniza, · 18, is attending Sandhurst Military Acad- emy in England. But the teenage son of Hussein and his fourth wife, American born Queen Noor, the former Elizabeth Halaby, was seen as too risky a choice when his father was recovering from cancer.

The team split the meets, defeating RPI by a score of 130-108, and losing to Middlebury, 142-89, in their last home meet ofthe season. The win against RPI was the frrst ofthe season for the Dutch women, who have beeN struggling in meets this season due to the fact that the team is very small in comparison to other teams in the league. Head Coach Judy Wolfe couldn't be happier witfu her team's perfor- mance. \The superior numbers posted by our team speak for them- selves, as many points in this meet were scored by my swimmers on their depth,\ stated Wolfe. (Coach Wolfe was so happy with the re- sults that she gave the team Thurs- day night off!) The meet was highlighted by a series of wins, including Junior Captain Kerry Librandi in the 1650 and 500 Freestyle events, Rachel Miller in the 100 Freestyle, Erin Wittes in the 200 Individual Med- ley, Sarah Rankowitz in the I 00 Backstroke, and Vic Dreier in the l 00 Breaststroke.

The Dutchwomen were domi- Cory Silken/TC A Union Swimmer warms up before the meet this weekend nated by the depth of the Middlebury College team in their loss on Saturday, however, as their swim team showed up at Union with more swimmers on their women's team than the total num- ber of swimmers on the Union Men's and Women's Teams. How- ever, the times of the women's team continued to drop, as many swim- mers swam season -best times, and first-place finishes were turned in by Erin Wittes in the 100 Breast- stroke, the 200 Medley Relay of Sarah Rankowitz, Wittes, Vic Dreier and Rachel Miller, and ShoNtel Meachem on the 3-Meter board. As the season draws to a close for the Dutchwomen, Coach Wolfe is optimistic about how her swim- mers will perform at NYS Champi- onships. \I'm seeing dramatic im- provements in the fmer skills in my swimmers, such as their starts and turns, and the techniques they have been learning throughout the season are now coming together. The hard training is behind us now, and everyone is now refining their skills in preparation for taper.\ (For those ofyou who don't know, ta- pering happens at the end of the season when the swimmers are given more time to swim less yards in practice, ... \The best part ofthe season.\) This weekend, the swimmers will travel to Hamilton College, where they will take on their biggest ri- vals in what should be a great meet. Men's Swimming Leaves RPI in Its Wake by Drew Davitiao Staff Writer The Swimming Dutchmen had a strong meet against Rensselaer last Wednesday, trampling the localRPI team, 14 3-1 00. The Dutchmen hap- penecl to win all thirteen events. Senior Matt Mauriello won both the 1650 free and the 100 fly. Se- nior Captain Dave Searles won the 400 IM and the 100 back. Junior Adam Hershman again won both the one and three meter dives. Se- nior Captain Jeff Hoerle won the 50 and 500 free. The score was a bit closer than the actual lopsided outcome of the meet because, out of respect for the RPI team, Union started counting their swims as exhibition somewherenearthe end of the meet. Men's states will be held at RPI between Thursday, February 25 and Saturday the 27. Saturday, Union faced Vermont's Middlebury College. This was the last home meet ofthe 1998-99 season, and accordingly there was a ceremony to recognize the graduating seniors. It was also noted at this presentation that Se- nior Captain Jeff Hoerle was the fastest man to swim the 1 00 free in Union history. Saturday was also Parents' Day, with a dinner follow- ing the meet. Parents came ftom all over New England and from as far away as Detroit and Miami to catch the last meet. However, Union was not the only team to show up at the pool deck. Middlebury pulled up in front of Alumni Gym with two greyhound buses and a van. Union was out -numbered 37 to 80. Middlebury raced five swimmers in every heat where Union usually only raced three. The 200-medley relay took first with a state qualify- ingtimeofl-:39.87. SeniorCaptain JeffHoerle took second in the 200 free with a season best of l :45.26. Another Senior Captain, Dave Searles, won the 200 IM and 100 fly with a time ofl:5\).15 and 52.69, respectively. Junior Adam Hershman took second in the 1- meterdiving with a score of235.05. Junior Pete Humplrres W<>n the 100 breast with a time of 1:03.40, just out-touching the top Middlebury swimmer, who went a 1:03.77. The final score was Union 112, to Middlebury 122.

'' JD Sports Dutchwomen Split Weekend Series by Haig Goudsouzian Contributing Writer The Union College women's basketball team managed to stay afloat at .500 this week by splitting their decisions one win and one loss. They are currently 7-7 overall and3-2 in league play. The Dutch women lost the ·first game of the week to the number one team in the conference and tw\enty third in the nation, William and Smith, by the score of76-45. Despite another great gam~ by freshman phenom Katie Smith (15 pts, 6 rebs), William and Smith was just too much to h;mdle. Throughout the game, a three point shooting arsenal that almost set the nets hanging from the rims ablaze bombarded the Dutch women. William and Smith hit nine shots from behind the three point arc and shot 44% overall from the field. However, it was the three point shooting that Union coach Mazy Ellen Burt labeled the nail in our coffm. The leading three point assassin, Liz Cor1~e Brown, hit four tres. For Union, both Leah Oliveri and Beth Perry did a nice job on the glass, amassing a total of fifteen rebounds amongstthe two of them. Erin McNamara and Heather Bennett both chipped in eight points apiece, but all in all coach Burt felt that we didn't play our best and they played very well. They where a little quicker and shot the ball very well. It's tough to win with that combination. The very next night, however, it was a completely different ball game.. Union dismantled Hamilton by a score of 8.0-70. Hamilton tried to force the Dutchwomen in a hectic up and down game, hot the Union guards controlled the tempo throughout the game. This was a gut check game for this group ofladies. The tnain goals going into the game were to control Hamilton's hyper quick freshman guard Jenny Russell. She has been the lone bright spot throughout the Hamilton rebuilding year and has flourished in tlle helter skelter system they embellish. She did have to shoot through a hand for the whole game while McNamara and Kelly Johnson kept her in lock down, holding her to a paltry four points on 2/13 shooting. The key for Union was\ establishing the inside game. Oliveri was monster in the paint ,with 14 pointsand· 13 rebounds. Her domination of the interior opened up the game for Smith {13 pts), sharp shooter Kathleen Furlong ( 14 pts, 3/4 on three pointers), and McNamara (16 points). TheDutchwGmen found holes in Hamilton's defense all game long, and attacked the basket much better that they did versus William and Smith. Due to their attacking style, they found themselves at the free throw line 29 times and converted on 24 of their attempts, for 82%.

Although Elway will go down as one of the best passers ever to play the game and is a cinch for the Hall of Fame, Super Bowls have not been his ting. Elway has been in a funk when it comes to the greatest challenge in pro foot- ball, and his performances defi- nitely flunk when compared with his marvelous regular season num- hers. If you are pulling for Denver in Sunday's game against Atlanta, you have to be concerned about how Elway will play in what almost everyone believes will be the last game ofhis career. In his four previous Super Bowls, he has performed far below his norm. And in his last six post season games he has not been sharp, even though Denver has won every one. \He simply can't throw like he used to\ said one coach who faced Elway in the play- offs this year; \and he can'tmove like he used to either. But he's still dangerous. Every once in a while, he looks like he used ta in the old days, but not as often.\ In his four Super Bowls, Elway has completed just 58 passes in 123 attempts, with only two. touchdowns and seven interceptions. This flies in the face of every- thing he has done in the regular season during his glitt~ring career. He has been a 57 per cent passer (compared with 4 7 per cent in the Super Bowl) and has thrown 300 touchdowns against 226 intercep- tions, as a,pposed to just one ·touchdown every two Super Bowls. He's thrown less than an interception per game in the regu- lar season, almost two per game in the Super Bowl. Perhaps as troubling to Broncos followers is tile way Elway has thrown the ball in the last two post seasons. He was a miserable 13 of 34 against the Jets when the Bron- cos won the AFC title twoV!eek- ends ago and had just 43 yards passing three minutes into the third quarter. Elways' yardage total in that game was doubled on o:nep-lay, a47-yardpassto EdMcCilffiey and on the run, which he has done so impressively in the past, he did not have the speed or arm strength to do it welL In the regular season, Elway has. averaged just less than 222 yards Elway finished with a total ofj,ust per game in the air. In his last five 173 yards for the_ game.- He had post .season games he has thrown sevenil passes batted away befo-re far an average .of just 171'\ yards, they crossed the Iirte of scrirn:rn.c~ge, · and in his last two Super Bow Is and when he was forced to th:row' {1 08 · vs. San Francisco, I 23 vs. Dutchman of the Week Dave Musella Dave has been an integral part of the team's success and it was evident this past week. Green Bay) he has averaged only 115 yards. Surprisingly; those are not close to being the worst per- fonnances by a quarterback in the Super Bowl. The Patriots' Tony Eason gets that prize. He had no completions ,in six attempts, with two fumbles against the Bears in Super Bow l:XX. For two games~ former Bronco and Cowboy Craig Morton has the crown. In Super Bowl V, playing for Dallas vs. Baltimore, Morton completed 12 of26 passes for 127 yards with three interceptions. Playing for Dallas vs. Baltimofe in Super Bow1 XII, Morton had four completions in 15 attempts for 39 yards and f(:)ur interceptions. So, in the two games he threw for 166 yards on 41 throws, with seven in- terceptions and no ,touchdowns. Now, Ehvay may l'Iot he the youthful, energetic, and ability laden quarterback :we have grown to know. However, his supporting cast these past two years is sig- nificantly stronger. Nonetheless, it is the quarterback who leads his team and therefore, Elway will need to be at his best. In one way or another, the bur- den will fall o:n Elway. Ifheloses, he will become only the second quarterback (Jim KelLy being the first), to lose four Super Bowls. If he wins, he can join Bart Starr, Bob Griese, Terry Bradshaw, Troy Aikman, and Joe Montana as quar- terbacks who won them back to back. The Falcons will be a tough team to beat, but with Elway star- ing down the throat of retirement and his second Super Bow 1 t-itle on the line, look for the Broncos to be better than ever. Dave Musella, one of three starting freshmen for the Union Basketball team, outscored everyone during Monday's 81-48 loss to Division I Princeton. He ended the night with 18 points. Dave also led the Dutchmen in rebounding with eight, and assist with three. He demonstrated he could play with the best. He had only two minutes rest against Princet<>n and led Union in scoring Friday against Hobart with 19 points in Union's victory. He again led the team in rebounding with 12 boards.

Hamilton ended the afternoon with an 84- played. l think we played a strong game, but we were just fatigued at the end.\ He went on to say \Maybe I should have made some different moves in the second half, but l didn't\ Even with a loss, the Dutchmen showed they can compete with the best. Hamilton has always been a powerhouse, and this year is no different. The Continentals lead the league with Union a close third. Galletta had 2 I points for the day, and has scored in double digits in seven of his last eight games.
