The field is still open and it is a field that stands unex:cellecl. The toastn1aster next introduced T ustice Alden ... Chester, who, in response fo the toast ''The · Judiciary,'' cotnpared the judiciary systnns of New York and Massachusetts and claitned that these two states have the best systen1s of any in the land. He closed by saying that the principle question in the discussion of the retnoval of the . coUege is not the benefit it would be to Albany nor the loss to Schenectady, but the best in- · terests of Old Union. ''The Board of Trustees\ was responded to . by Rev. George Alexander, 0. D. He said that he was surprised to see the trustees called upon to act as bottle-holders in a contest be- tween the two Dutch cities. He said that Al- bany should have been anxions to secure the college one hundred years sooner and not have · waited until Old Union had tnade a natne for herself. lie also dwelt upon the good location of Dorp, it being the centre of n circle of thirty tnlles radius which includes one of the most thickly sett1ed portions of the country. Hon. Alex. J. Thompson; in response to the toast H Echoes frotn 'Old DoTp' \ said that he had attended the banquet ready for a contest with the Albany enthusiasts, but that none of them appeared. He then gave a short history of the founding of the college and said that it was owing to Gen. Philip Schuyler~ an Alba- nian, that the college went to Scbenectady. Mr. Thotnpson paid a grand tribute to Dr. Nott and his descendants for their dealings with the col- lege. He said that Albany wanted Union only because of self-interest and he scored that city for not caring for the part of the Universitf they already have. He concluded by saying that the controversy is injuring the institution. President Elliott of Harvard was the last speaker. In responding to the toast \Fair Har- vard\ he explained how their mode of govern- ment differed from 1nost colleges. At Harvard the trustees all live in Boston .and hold tneetings every two weeks and at these 111ee6ngs every- thing of interest to the university is discussed. · He seetned to be in favor of establishing colleges . i·n large cities and at great educational centers. He said the question of retnoval in his n1ind re- solved itself into the question whether the University could do effective work with the de- partm:ents separated as now. The foUowing toasts on the list were not re- sponded to o\ving to the absence of the speakers: ''The City of Albany,\ Mayor John Boyd Thacher; ·\Education and Citizenship,\ Mr. Seytnour VanSantvool'd; ''The Legislature,'' Senator Myer N ussbautn.

THE OONOORDIENSIS. 5 \Removing the co1lege to Albany would destroy all these and the r·everence and love of the alumni would exist no longer. They ·would take no in- te,rest in the new Awbany institution, although it should assurne the revered nan1e of their Ahna 1\tiater. The Alumni of Schenectady evidently in- tended to have a few words to say concerning . the matter of tb.e removal of the college to Al- bany. A tneeting was held on January 27 and \3d. The collAge was established at Schenectady a con 1111 ittee was appointed to draw up resolu- • by the voluntary contributions of liberal-n1inded citizens, 1uore than Oile hundred years ago, in spite tions expressing the sentitnent of the rneeting, of tlle opposing efforts of the City of Albany. ,She and that con1mittee reported as follows : has won weB me1·ited honor and esteen1 through \'Vhereas The question of re1noving Union • College to the city of Albany has again been • brought to public notice and eff.orts .are being Inad e by sou1e of the people of Albany to procure such • ren1oval, and \'Vhf'reas The n1ain ground for ren1oval, w hi('.h is presented by its advocates, is the benefit and ad vantage that will result the:refrom to the city •· of Albany, with little, if any, regard to the true · interests of the college. ''Resolved, That while we 1·egard such rernoval, nsing the language of one of the speakers at th.e rueeting held at Albany on last Saturday ni:ght, to he \only H drean1 and castle in the air,\ and have no fears or apprehensions of a deplorable ruisfortune to the institution which we love and revere, it is the duty of the alu1nni of the college, anrl particularly that of those re~iding in this city, to protest against such a proposition and oppose the sante by all the 1ueans \\vithin their power, for · the following reasons: ' 1st, The bare discussion of the question, by creating false irnpressions in reference to the want of success of the college, will result in injury to the college. ''2d. Such re1nova1 would be, and the bare agi- tation is, detrimental to the i'nierests of the col- lege. So far fron1 being moribund, as charged by one of the speakers at Saturday's 1neeting in Al- bany, the college is in a prosperous condition; the nurnber of students has increased annually for a nurnber of years, its income has been largely in- creased; its large property on._ Long Island city, the holding of 'vhich for yeaTs was only an ex- pense to the college, is now yie I ding an income and becOJning more valuable every year. \It is this dawning prosperity- and assurance of success which, in our judgment, has excited the greedy and grasping spirit of -those who are now agitating this question. \But the most valuable of its possessions is the reverence, affection and attachrnent of its alur11ni, based upon the associations and mernories of col- lege life. These are inseparable froin the old gray walls, the carnpus and the surroundings of our . Ahna Mater, the 111en whont she has graduated. The ren1oval now, without need ()r necessity, would be inequit- able and unjust to th.e citizens of Schenectady.\ bl}e Day of prayer. The Day of Prayer for colleges, Thursday, January 3oth, was fittingly celebrated in the chapel by tnorning and afternoon services, the fanner being conducted by President Rayn1ond · and the latter by Frank A. Kellar, Yale '92, for- merly of the Students' Volunteer movement. Both services were largely attended and thoroughly enjoyable in the highest sense oi the word. The sermon preached by Dr. Raymond at the rnorning service, vvas one that will be long re- menlbered and felt by all who heard it. In its povver and eloquence it was vvell calculated to influence to bette1· living and to higher aims, undergraduate and alun1ni alike. The text was found in the first Epistle of Paul to the Corin- thians, III., 9, \F()r we are laborers together wlth God\. Being a laborer together with God~ 1nan should airn at all that is true and good. That alone V\ 7 jll stand and when tnan's work is tnade tnanifest, that which is wood, hay, stubble., -false and untrue-will be swept away. Men n1ay often think that the fruits of deceit and dis- honesty are of lasting benefit, and so it may ap- pear for a titne-· bltt who can hope to escape the final judgtnent? God's laws are irrevocable. The house that is built without due regard to these laws in Nature, will fall, and as surely will fall the n1an who disregards them in his spiritual being. 'The whole serrnon~ in fact, was a plea for ab- solute truth of purpose, in every word and deed of our daily lives. I.

:. The track athletic and base-ball tea1ns have elected captains. Z. L. Myers, '96, has been chosen to direct track work, and C11as. SuUI- van, '97, base-ball. 1'he record of both of these men on the athletic field has been such as to make thetn eminently fitted for Hieir respective positions. Besides being athletes they are both_ students of excellent standing in their classes; they represent the highest standard of athletics because they show that with it can be co1nbined the work of the student. Mr. Z. L. Myers entered with the class of '96 and has ever been an enthusiastic class as wen as college 1r1an. He was President of his class during the Sophomore year and has served on • various connnittees. In literary and oratoricai · work he has always taken an active interest; last commencement he was a m-etnber of the - Adelphic's debating tearn in the Allison-Foote . contest. In athletics it would l)e hard to say where he has tnade the best showing; for on the track, in: the gymnasiu1n and on the grid-iron he has .ai- ways stood at the front. For three years, at the . mid-winter tneet, he has won the position of · college athlete ; he holds the Union record for · \OOp~rstOWI] \U,ii]S by a Small rnar9il]. The dual meet between the Cooperstown and Union teams at Cooperstown last Friday even- hlg was won by the forn1er teatn by only four points, the final score being 1334 to 1330. A good crowd greeted the contestants, amd the Union boys have nothing but praise for the manner in which they w-ere treated by tLe Cooperstown people. There were no un- pleasant features of any description, and ev,ery- thing went off in a stnooth manner. The contest proved to be highly exciting, and it vvas not until the last 1nan had failed on the high kick tl:at the result was at all certain. Taylor and Bowers did tnost of the work for Cooperstown, while Captain Myers and Hintnan did the best for Union. Three college records ()Ut of four were broken-Myers in the shot-put -o.f 40 ft. 5 in., the high kick of 8 ft. I I in., and Hinn1an in the fence vault of 6 ft. 5 in.

While playing at end during his Freslunan year, there was not a gain tnade around hitn. His record in all de- partl11ents is certainly exceptional and the track- team is to be congratulated for having elected such a captain. Tho-ugh Mr. Sullivan has confined his athletic · efforts to base-ball, he has nevertheless tnade an enviable record. He~ too, entered \\Nith the class of '96 but was obliged to leave college foT a year, thus causing hitn to drop back to '97, in which he is a tnetnber of the engineering course. He has already played three years on the base- ball teatn as catcher and short-stop and by his work has gained the confidence of players and students.

OF THE PAST-·· .. OF THE FUTURE. In days of old, when knights were bold, And of college heroes we've been told, We found in all that there were three classes, Which each, the other, at times surpasses. In the fall of the year the hero was he Who had broken hiE, arm or wrenched his knee; vVho walked on crutches with one eye black, A.nd suffered slightly from a broken back. The man whose n1uscles were hard and set, Used to the pounding he rnust get On the· foot-ball field, where he spent his life In an ever-increasing physical strife. We doffed our hats as he passed us by, And gazed on hh11 with adilliring eye. The foot- ball n1an in days of old Was a hero great and a warrior bold . Then, following him. in close contact, Game the n1an whose every finger was cracked Fro111 having coHided with: a \red hot liner,\ In some unfortunate, unheard of Inanner. Then, we thought the 1nan who could field a ball Was a hero true and an all in all, And we willingly worshipped at his shrine, For the base-ball n1an. was a hero divine. And following hhu with. steady pace, Caine the third ·Contestant in our hero race; · With for.rn so lithe, he touches the earth, And rebounds with a spring fron1 1nother earth. Do you wonder at our aduliration For such a physical creation, As he strides along with ease and grace, And easily wins in this mighty ra~e? Do you ask me now, if the track athlete Is not with honor and glory replete ? ~'{-- *** ** These were the heroes of the past, And we worshipped them fron1 first to :last ; · But the body now subserves the mind, And the n1en tal athletes are the kind · To who1n we bow our heads and say, Ye are the heroes of to-day. -;'f***** We now will speak of and will nurture, The college hero .of the future, ·. The n1ental athlete who knows not a zero, Demands his place as a college hero. He holds that college is not the place To break one's bones and scar one's face; But that its purpose is of one kind, To broaden ruan 's greatest of gifts, th~ 1nind. He advances an arguruent based on facts That withstands .an eleven's repeated attacks ; He asks a base-ball n1an, willing to serve, If in this plate girder, he's \on to\ the curve ? And advances a philosophical theory That would Iuake our swiftest runner weary.

At:te.r some thought we have co1ne to the conclusion that the schente which is now being carried out, of each class having a banquet of i~ts own is just as good a one. An undergraduate banquet of course has a g1·eat advantage in bringing all the Inembers of All subscribers who have not yet paid their · that body into a closer relationship, but it fails to subscriptions will find a blue mark on this para- mature in a very gr-eat deg1·ee the spirit that g:raph.

The faculty has made a ruling debarring 1nen who are not up in their work from playing on athletic teains-yet, but what of that? That is no reason why every athlete and every man in eoHege should lose all interest in athletics. Instead, it should encourage every. one to do tnore than l1e has ever done before to ·develop strong tean1s. What would · our sister colleges say if they beard that Union in· th~ future was to have no athletic teams? They would say, \The faculty ruling which barred pro~ fessionals and n1en who could not keep up their · college work bas killed athletics at Union. It is · a good thing, too, if she cannot run he-r teams on a strictly amateur basis.\ This criticism, of course, would be advanced, but that i~ not the case at all. Union College tea1ns have always been represen- tative undergraduate teams, bat. if we are not to let athletics go to the ground, i:t su.rely looks as if son1ething were wrong. We cannot affnrd to put for that appeals first to the college n1an's heart. But the author of the following see111s to love better the terpsichorean sport. Thus he sings : ''I cannot throw the hamn1er, Nor ride the fleeting wheel, But when the band begins to play, How I do love to spiel\. Bv request the nan1e of the cc ntributor IS withheld.

To this sweet singer the n1uses seetn to dele- gate the imtnortalizing .of accidents; listen to the soft, rhythtnic tneasures of this:

Beautiful as the above 1nay he, we still think that the one whorn th.e gods tnoved to write ''As to Blootners\ must bear away the pahn. lYlother earth now grown antique, Looks on with a bluHhing ehique, At maids petite, 0 terror boid; at leng,th thou say est Frosh !

At its sacred Tril'bys, I, a freshruan, knelt down. 1 Awake, ye Frosh! not only silent pray While n1en are mique And seldom spique, But turn around and look a wique. And Union has also her cheese poet. Such • an inspiring then1e could not possibly be passed by ; and this has roused one poetic soul at least. ''ln Union there is strength\ Sorne poet said at length: And he was rig·ht for Union is the cheese. Occasionally sotne one aspires to wd tea com- panion piece to the product of sotne older poet's ·pen. We would not take tin1e to con1pare the two, but vvill nxerely quote this new \Psaltn of. Life\. Deeds of sou1e rnen oft renlind us \Ve can by then1 our huprove, And before there grows upon us Bigger patches on our pants.

Let us then be up and doing, Pay our debts however ~mall ' Else when co1ues the Sophon1ore Soiree We may have no pants at all. There is one n1ore poetn that we are sure will bear careful study. It is filled wjth shy humor; and hidden in its lines are thoughts thai betoken no comn1on tnind. It is seldetn that a great epic is written of college life ; but here is one devoted to a particular class, \The 1\tiidnight Hy1nn to the Freshn1an'' ; ·would that so111e genuis would set this hytnn to tnusic. How the poet draws tears to the eyes with his pathetic touches, then rises suddenly to the sublilne; or again shrieks forth sotn~ terrible line as he hails the '• bloody So ph\.

JU. Y. G®NG®RDIGNSIS. VoL. XIX. UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 26, 189'6. No. 1 o. Our <eolle~e (jroul)ds. . One of the rnost noteworthy things about the colleges clustering about on the hill of St. Genevieve, and down below, '~the pleasant Pratutn where the students for centuries took th . . ,., h'l 1 . 1 ·eu recreation, w: r e t1e1r fe· lows elsewhere were too often cooped up in the crowded Union ·College is the place itself. The curious · old buildings, the pleasant catnpus, the coUege garden ~ nd the coUege woods, the view to the westward across to the Helderbergs and the . Gap,.-all these th..ings are, to a stranger, itn- · mediately striking. Doubtless they are not to all itn:m,ediately atb·active, but to many of those . who live in their i,ttfluence they ootne to have an extraordinary and enduring charn1. In the minds of such, no weather has power to nw:ke thetn, ugly. Some titnes and sotne seasons, doubtless, are better than others ; the deUcate evenings .of early surnmer, the bracing tnornings of autumn, or the moonlit winter's nights, these give the hill especial beauty ; but even in bad weather, in dull damp uncotnfortable weather, the hill has its own characteristics, and for not · tn.edieval towns. a few its own chann. Probably there are a g-ood n1any men who go through their four years at Union without any real appreciation of these things. But that is a pity, that is losing an opportunity, that is miss- ing something that is really worth while. For one of the itnportant things about a university or a college, perhaps especially about a col.lege, is its situation. Cardinal New1nan, who is almost a:lways acute and pene1 rating, began his informal papers on the history of universities by speaking of just this thing. He spoke particularly of Athens, he gave a fine description of the beautiful land of Attica, and of the city lying between the Acropolis and the sea. \~The stranger,\ said he, '' from a remote province, from Britain or . from Mauritania * * * learned at once what · a real university 111ust be by coming to under- . stand the sort of country which was its beautiful home.\ Later in history the University of Paris had a noble site, the left bank of the river, It is true that there are great universities which are not beautiful. Oxford and Cam- br,idge are beautiful ; one need waste no words on the:m ; everyone knows how lovely they are. The German universities, on the other hand, as a rule are not beautiful. They consist of a num- ber of buildings, often very large but usually rather ugly or at least cnmmonplace, all scat- tered about here or there or anywhere in the city. And the Gerrnan Musenstadt is rarely a very attractive town ; there are no universities at Nuremburg or Hildesheim. They are too often in very prosaic places like Halle. The consequence is, at least one consequence is, that the German student's life is influenced not by lovely surroundings but by other things. When he is not at work he is .in the bier-lokale, or the cafe, or the theatre, or at the mensur, and these give the local color to his life. Now and then in the sumtner he escapes from the stuffy town and finds the beauty wh.ich is there lacking, in the attractive country round. But there is noth- ing beautiful about the universities of Berlin, Leipzig, Gmttingen; Heidelberg happens to have the castle close at hand, and frotn J ena and Freihurg one can easily reach lovely country. But there is no beauty in the university sites. In America some universities have beautiful situations,-Cornell and Wisconsin have situa- tions which have proved themselves able to overcome anything the hand of man can devise. But some of our universities are not so fortunate. Harvard and Yale in the midst of good sized towns have some curious old building of no very attractive type intrinsically, and some beautiful new buildings which are very like

P'l!lt a bit of Union into the grounds of any otla er college and you would know it at once. It 1uts a tone, a temper of its own, which every Union man ought to appreciate. Union is in some :re- spects like other colleges and in some respe.c:ts different. And one of the things that she l~~as wholly to herself, not of the first importance per- . haps, but still not to be neglected, is her situa- tion, heT ::;urroundings. We should be sorry to lose thetn. But sorne of us do lose thetn every day, just so far as we do not notice and enjC>y thetn. Some people will have it that n1an is a verr • min1etic anirnal, that like the cbatneleon he takes • color fl~on1 his surroundings. It n1ay be so. But I do not think that one would become quaint . by living in our old buildings, nor beautiful b J going through the garden io chapel. Still the influence of surroundings is something,-. som,e- thing worth cou~ting on. And it is a good thing, too, to acquire the hflbit of getting th~ and is cotning to be one of the main features. No one, after listening to the stirring speeches at the college meeting on Friday evening could doubt that a man with a brain, and full of all the enthusiasm of college life, is better fitted to influence the world than any of his \bottle- shouldered, long faced critics.\ On Friday evening frotn five to seven ''Par- lor conferences\ for college delegates were held and the following subjects discussed: \Need of trained leaders in the college work, and how to get them,\ H. W. Georgi, Secretary, Inter- national Comtnittee; \The Development of a higher spiritual life among college students,\ W. H. Sallmon, Yale University; Opportunities for college men in association work in foreign lands,\ David McConaughy, Secretary for India. Later in the evening addresses were delivered by Dr. A. V. V. Raytnond on \Essential elements in a successful college association,\ and by ·Chancellor Day, of Syracuse University, on ''Power and possibilities of organized christian work by and for students.\ Both addresses were full of interesting points. •

He was · of Puritan stock. His grandfather served in. the French and Revolutionary wars and his father in the war of 1812. He graduated from Union College in 1851 and was ernployed as an instructor in 1nathen1~atics by Frof Charles Bartlett at College Hill .Academy in Poughkeepsie. He studied law in the office of J ud~e Em NJott, and afte1· his ad- mission to the bar form~d a partnershjp with Matthew Hale, now of Albany. In 1855 Gen.

The year after the outbreak of the war, at the suggestion of Mrs. Benson J . Lossing, wife of the historian, Smith organjzed the 150th Dutchess county regiment. Gov. Morgan offered him the Colonelcy, but he declined. He · accepted the office of Major, and fought -with his n1en in every engagement front Gettysburg to Bentonsville, going with his corps through the Tennessee and Atlanta carnpaigns, thenee with Sher1nan to the sea and through the Carolinas. He became Lieutenant-Colonel of the 150th Regi- Inent, and afterward Colonel. After the war he was breveted Brigadier· General, and w.as sent for . by President Johnson, who offered hin1 the Gover- norship ·Of any Southern 8tate during the recon- struction period. He refused. President John- son afterward appointed him Collector of Internal Revenue and Postinaster of Poughkeepsie. He held the latter office two terms. He was Recorder, and for thirty yea1~s was a men1ber of the Eoard of · Education. While he was President of the Board the Catholic Parochial schools were taken into the public .school system on what is now widely known as the Poughkeepsie plan. Last tenn 1nention was made in these colun1ns of a comn1ittee being appointed which was to obtain, if possible·, a free tnail delivery to each roo1n in college, thereby being a great conveni- ence to all the students. The corntnittee pre- pared a petition, which was signed by all the faculty and a large rnajority of the under- grad nates, and it was forwarded to the proper authorities. The resuH of the petition is most satisfactory to all, as can be seen by the follow- ing ~etters which have been received by. Dr. Raytnond: NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 1896. Re1J. A.. V. V. Raynwnd, D.

Enclosed find com- Inunications touching upon it, which I trust will be satisfactory to you as it is gratifying to me. Very respectfully, JoHN E . .AsHE, '66. Inspector in Chief, l~ew York State.

We also understand that the Editor-in- Chief has been complimented (?) several times on the ground that being an undergraduate he should not criticise the steps taken by men who are many years his seniors. Viewed in this light we heartily agree with the Albanians, and we do not for a n1oment wish them to understand that our re- marks have been made for that purpose. What we have said we do not consider as criticisin-it has been in the interest o.f our college and what claim these things, but we fail to see when these claims are to be realized. When these points are p1·oved then wiH it be tiine e'nough to consider the question of removal. A million and a half dollars cannot do it, and that is all they say they can possibly raise.
