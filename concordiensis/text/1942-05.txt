No. 53 Tax :Group Ma~kes Tentative Grants Fo:r Second Term Enrollment Doubt Causes Innovation: Definite First Term Awards Made Only tenta-tive appr0priations of Student Activities' Tax Funds have been made for the second semester of next year, because of the diffi- culty of predicting. the enrollment after January 1, 1943, according to the announcement of tax ap- propriations released this week by the Student Tax Committee. The number of students who will be contributing their $6 per se- mester activities fee for the Sep- tember-December period of next year wiH probably not vary from normal a great deal in either direc- tion, a tax committee spokesman said. Consequently, definite grants for the first semester have been made to the 14 campus groups sup- ported by the tax. Estimate Grants A tentative second - semester grant for each activity was esti- mated by the tax committee, and all managers have been informed as to what their appropriations will be if enrollment is nearly nor- mal. However, the committee has emphasized that these grants are subject to change, in an effort to prevent rash planning by the ac- tivities. As a second precaution against a possible enrollment decre~se, the committee has not appropnated all the money it expects .to col_Iect f?r the first semester. This savmg WIH be used to help tide the activities through the second semester, if necessary. The general reduction in appro- priations was made possible ~Y. t.he willingness of most of the ·activities to effect economies in their work, and the fact that in some cases a considerable reduction in the scope of work is planned. No ·Predictions Available Under normal conditions, the tax committee appropriates most of the money H expects to collect, on the basis of $12 per student. Usually, the number of students in college can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy, through mathematical use of percentages worked out over a long period of time. This year, however, the .com- mittee has been unable to obtain any reliable predictions concerning enrollment, because of the uncer- tainty caused by the war. The se- mester plan and the reduced ap- p!opriations have b~en set forth as an attempt to provide for any eventuality, the committee report said .

By now there is no single activity of human every- day experience in America or anywhere within the t·ealm of \civilization\ that does not, in some way, feel the effect of the struggle now taking place. Here in America, and more particularly, here at Union College, the physical aspects of the war, in terms of the dangers of actual combat, are no closer to us than they were when we started this school yeat·. But the wat·, in its ever-spreading sphere of influence, can be seen all about us. Not far from the campus, the machines of that war are coming off pmduction lines, al- most next-door to us lies the great supply depot of the United States Army, and one might go on listing indefinitely the thous- ands of small ways in which the \Var has really been broug·ht to Union College. Union men will remembet· this war year, as will everyone else, pt•incipally in terms of ways in which it affected their college life. However else the world remembers the past nine months, Union men will recall it in hun- dreds of minute recollections. They will remember a grim chill that hung over the campus during the middle weeks of the month of December, a chill unlike any that winter weather produces; a Junior Prom which saw five inches of snow blanket- ing the campus; the loss of classmates and fraternity brothers to the services; the in- evitable slump in the quality and quantity of academic work; the hopeless feeling of dis- appointment over the loss of the accustomed summer vacation for many; the awarding of the two most distinguished prizes fot· seniors -in absentia; the appearance of bicycles and the los.s of innumerable \family cars\ for weekend excursions in seat·ch of diversion; the substitution of hundreds of automobiles for the familiar flock of sheep in the college pasture; the sot·ely-felt abolition of spring sport .schedules; commencement weekend, which hardly waited for the leaves to put in an appearance on the trees about the campus before making its premature entrance to drop the cm-tain on another year. The Present Commencement, like the year that has pre- ceded it, is unlike any in a good many years. Aside ft·om its early place on the calenda1·, it entails, in its character, many featllt'es that have never been present before.

It is not hard to imagine how this figure compares with similar analyses over the period of the last ten years, when college seniors faced an outside world which held a future \vhich could hardly be adequately de- scribed by the word \indefinite.\ The Future Yes, the future of 99'; of the Class of 1942 offers little prospect of the tragedy of unemployment or the boredom of \getting in , a rut.\ It may be said that the future has I been arranged with such certainty, not by the training of the graduates. nor by their ability or qualifications to fill important positions, but by the pressure of the affairs I of the world. That this is true is p1·oven con- 1 elusivelY bv the fact that nearlv half of the men who ~ill receive their deg~·ees on l\Ion-1 dav rnornino- will be entering the armed! se~·vice of ti1eir country, and that a good share of the rest will be entering upon some ! vital part of the war effort. Expressed in other terms, this means that most of the class have jobs-val'ious kinds of jobs, but jobs which are all part of one big job-winning the war. Theit· days of \quarterbacking from the sidelines\ are over. From now on they, themselves, will be asked to \deliver the goods.\ The challenge is indeed a plain one. From the steps of l\lemorial Chapel, the Class of 1942 will look out on a world which, even at its best, has never smiled very ben- evolently upon them. And they will wonder to themselves, \Why does it have to be om class, our g·eneration that comes upon such troubled times? Are we the children of ad- versity, doomed to everlasting trial and tl'ib- ulation ?\ or else they will take the opposite attitude, \There's something- wrong out there, and something's g-ot to be done about it.\ And so the choice this year seems not to be one of choosing a pathway into the fu- ture, but rather one of interpreting and forming a courageous attitude toward the one which is so plaiuly pointed out to the Class of 1942.

It wants you to train now in any ac- credited college of your choice for active duty later. Trained men are needed. Trained men to become Naval Officers! And your college is ready to give you that training now. Here's New Navy Plan a Naval Aviation Officer; or be- come a beck or Engineering Of- ficer. Those selected for tra,ining as Aviation Officers will complete the second calendar year of college be- fore they are called to active duty. Those selected for training as Deck Officers and Engineering Officers will continue their college program until they receive their bachelor's degree, provided they maintain established university standards. All others will be permitted to finish the second calendar year ·of college work, and will then be or- dered to duty at a Naval Training Station as Apprentice Seamen; and later will be transferred to active service. Any man, however, who fails in his college subjects during this training program may be called to active duty at once, as an Apprentice Seaman. Your pay starts with active duty. Courses You Will Take This special Navy plan for college men calls for your concentration now on studies that will equip you to be of the greatest possible service later. All courses will be given by the faculty of your col- lege. The Navy specifies certain requirements that will fit you both physically and mentally for serv- ing your country in the Navy. If you wish to serve your coun- try by working for a Navy com- mission, enlist now for special preparation in any accredited col. lege of your choice. MAN OF THE YEAR If you're seventeen and not yet twenty, you enlist now as an Ap- prentice Seaman in the Naval Re- serve. Y au then continue in col- lege, including in your studies courses stressing physical train- ing, mathematics and physics. Af- ter you successfully complete 1Y2 years of college work, you will be given a competitive examination. DON'T WAIT ••• ACT TODAY 1. Take this announcement to the Dean of your college. The swift, incisive action by the college in converting its very being to the furtherance of the country's war effort has occasioned outstanding work by more than one member of the college staff. One man who seems to stand out particu- larly is Professor Augustus H. Fox, War Service Counselor, whose efforts have been truly heroic. Accepted in addition to his reg- ular teaching duties, Professor Fox's work as advisor to all students in regard to their individual service has been far reaching and efficient. Union has been fortunate in escaping much of the confusion which might have ac- companied the draft, the many-sided offi- cers' training programs, and the natural un- rest among students who wanted to \do their bit\. A calm, considered administrative attitude has done much to set the pace for Union's generally sensible reaction to these pressures. For the wis.e handling- of number- less individual problems, for an unbounded enthusiasm to do the right thing by his col- lege and country, however, full credit should be given Professor Fox. 2.

Then came Pearl Harbor, and things began to happen in a way not at all concurrent with the \ivory-tower\ theory of college 'life. Students were Hrged to remain in c01lege, but seniors in good stand- ing drafted a·fter the end of the third marking period were prom- ised degrees. Then there was that hectic week before Christmas, when the stu- dents got a chance to vote on whether they would prefer tw0 weeks vacation at Christmas, and none in the spring, or a week at each time. The vote went to the split vacation, and a revised col- lege calendar was published the next week which left little doubt that Union, too, was in the war. Freshman and minor sports wet e dropped, all spring athletics were curtailed, and a full month cut off the academic schedule. The now famous campus thief paid his first visits to Union fra- ternities in the week before vaca- tion, relieving students in ten houses of a total of $217.01. Only two lights marred an otherwise perfect blackout as the campus joined the rest of Schenectdy in its first air-raid defense test. Wendell Willkie, who takes uv his duties as honorary chancellor on Monday, was appointed early in January. Professor Augustus H. Fox began what has pro,red to be a most valuable service a~ War Service Counselor about the same time.

BECAU~E the.ocean i:n't equip- ~ ped with fillmg stattons every few miles, naval vessels must carry enough fuel for long voyages. l\nd finding storage room aboard for this fuel is a serious design problem. Most naval ships today are driven by steam turbines connected to the propeller shafts through reduction gears. And turbine engineers, work- ing with the Navy, have pioneered in the use of higher steam pressures and temperatures-producing tur- bines of such improved efficiency that in modern ships the fuel con- sumption per horsepower is from 25 to 40 per cent lower than in vessels of the same type used during the first vVorld War. Thus it has been possible to design ships with greater cruising radius for the same amount of fuel oil, or with more AU-TUB£-IOGRAPHV G ENERAL ELECTRIC'S Radio and Television Depart- ment, in its new Radio News Program with Frazier Hunt, is telling the story of Plectronics to a nation at war- a war in which electronics itself is one .of our most powerful tools.

So fast is it growing that there is a place here- an urgent need here- for every college man in America who can qualify for Officer's Training. The U. S. Army Air Forces need Flying Officers and Ground Crew Officers. And many of them must come from the ranks of today's col- lege students - men who make their plans now for the necessary Aviation Cadet training. Thanks to :a newly created Air Force Reserve plan, men of all classes - aged 18 to 26, inclusive -can en- list for immediate service or continue the scholastic work required for graduation before being called to active duty. You must meet the requirements for physical fitness, of course. In addition, you take a new simplified test to determine your ability to grasp the training. A college man should pass it easily. $75 A MONTH DURING TRAINING Those accepted who wish immediate duty will go into training as rapidly as facilities permit. As an Aviation Cadet, you are paid $75 a month, with subsistence, quarters, medical care, uniforms, equipment. In 8 months you can win an offi- cer's commission as a bombardier, navigator or pilot - and be well started on your way to serve America and advance yourself in aviation.
