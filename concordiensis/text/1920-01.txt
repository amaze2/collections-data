A Gateway~Electrical O NL.Y a forty-foot gateway bounded by two brick pilasters and ornamental lamps, but urilike any other gateway in the entire world. For back of it is the General Electric Com- pany's main office building, accommodating 2300 employees. And j11st next door is its laboratory with the best equipment for test- ing, standat:dizing and research at the com- mand of capable engineers. Then down the street--a mile long-are other buildings where everything electrical, from the small- est lamp socket to the huge turbines for electrically propelled battleships, is made by the 20,000 electrical workers who daily stream through. What a story this gate would t:J,l, if it couJd, of the leaders of the electrical industry and business, of ambassadors from other insti- tlltions and from foreign lands. The story would be the history of etlectric lighting, electric transportation, elect~ic in- dustrials and electricity in the home. This gateway, as well as the research, en- gineering, man11facturing and commercial resources back of it, is open to all who are working for the betterment of the electrical industry.

The oper:ing of the College Vnion marks another important step tolv-ard demco·atizi ng the student life of Union. It was with this aim that it was originaily conceived last spring. How far it is to fulfill. that purpose is going to depend on two things,-the patron- age, and the manner of patronage. Students must realize that it is their Union and treat .it as their c rea tio n and their property. It oug-ht to receive a stro11ger support from Union than that given to outsiders because it is entirely dependent on that support for its existence. But furthermore, that support must be of the right kind. Orderly gatherings are just what the College needs in order that the different types o£ men here may better know each other and so better unckrstand each other. At the first sign of disorder, con1monly designated as \·rcught-housing however, the Union will begin to deteriorate. The College Union, to be successful, must repre~ent the best that Union has and must be suppo,rted by the best men in College. If the general conduct of the patrons is odious to th~~m. the Union will deteriorate. There is no practicable means of enforcing order if it is not spontaneous. It is for every man to exert his influenre to :nip any carelessness in the bud so that it may not lead to some-thing worse. The Colleg-e LTnion was originally conceived as something to augment the social life of the College. It will be more than that. It is no longer only desirable, but O\\·ing to the r:a.pid enlargement in student registration, it now answers a practical demand. The fraternities are no longer capable of housing half the students,-a fact which shows that the other half eats and sleeps elsewhere. For these men, a place on the campus to eat and pass thei•r spare mo- me11ts is itwaluable. It is such a place that the Union now offers. The Union is going to de\·elop. That must be the slogan of every Union man. The present outlay represents an ·expenditure of consi4erable money, but a start has been made. A reasonably small tax on the_students each year will permit addition of furni- ture ~o that in a few years tl1e lTnion will he somewhat of the type of thing that its promoters hope to achieve.

A reasonably small tax on the_students e<1ch yE'ar will permit addition of furni- ture so that in a few years the Union \Yiil be somewhat of the type of thing that its promoters hope to achieve.

CATALOGUE SHOWS THE RETURN OF WAR VETERANS 'I'he new Union College catalogue brings out the fact that there are 28 former members of the class of 1918 now enrolled as Seniors in the col- lege. Thes·e men served in the army or navy and lost two years as a re- sult. In addition to these former 1918 students, there is an equal num- ber of former 1919 men enrolled as Seniors. The graduating class this year is expected to number over eighty, the largest in the history of the coilege. Of the Junior Class of 92 members .one-third entered with other classes but were forced to drop .back because of service during the war. The same is true of the Sophomore da.ss, although the percentage is smaller; The men who are returning are for the most part those who were most active in college affairs when they previously attended Union. Nine of the football players who received awards this year had lost at least one year through serving with th·e •armed forces. Other members of the team had been at camp, but were enabled to return without losing tl1eir class '\tanding. Thr·ee out' of the five reg- tilars of the basketball team at the start of the season had lost one or two years because of service. Greek <Freshman A). General Science (Sophomore). Engineering Law.

With belts and pulleys repilaced hy electric motors operating automatic-almost human- machines, many a slow and tedious process has been elimi- nated. The factory worker's task of yesterday is made pleasant by his command of this magic power. The Crane Company's plant at Chicago-electrical through· out-is a model of industrial efficiency. Its 1 0,000 horse- power of driving energy is brought by three small wires from a distant power plant. Then electricity drives the machinery which handles the coal for heating, cuts the steel, sifts the sand and sorts the material-in -fact does everything from scrubbing the floor to winding the clock. Such an institution is marvelous-superhuman-made thus by the man-multiplying force of electriCity. The General Electric Company has been instrumental in effecting this evolution. First, by developing successful electric gener- ating and transmission apparatus to furnish economically this modern form of power. Secondly, through many years of active co-operation with hundreds of maRufacturers, it has mastered the art of applying the use of electrical energy to a multitude of needs. And finally, through branch offices and other distributing channels, its products are made accessible to all. !Hauling material~ wifhtrain-operatecl :by: electric automobile motors. a ~V Sales Offices in Ji S.J all lruge CitieSJ. 95-l09EI SEE THE iBRO·GUE M .

With belts and pulleys replaced by electric motors operating automatic-almost huma;n-. machines, many a slow and tedious process has been ehmt- llated. The factory worker's task of yesterday is made pleasant by his command of this magic power. The Crane Company's plant at Chicago-electrical through- out-is a model of industrial efficiency. Its 10,000 horse- power of driving energy is brought by three small wires from a distant power plant. Then electricity drives the machinery which handles the coal for heating. cuts the st~el, sifts the sand and sorts the material-in fact does everythmg from scrubbing the floor to winding the clock:. Such an institution is marvelous-superhuman-made thus by the man-multiplying force of electricity: The ~ener~l Electric Company has been instrumental 1n effectmg th1s evolution. First, by developing ~uccessful electric gener- ating and transmission apparatus to furnish economically this modern form of power. Secondly, through many years of active co-operation. with hundreds of manufacturers, it has mastered the art of applying the use of electrical energy to a multitude of needs. And finally, through branch offices and other distributing channels, its products are made accessible to all. , General Of:fi.ce .SchenectaQY.N.'l lHauling materials witlttrain..operated by. electric automobile mot<>Is •. s trtc Sales Offices in all large citiesJ. 05·1090 ..

With belts and pulleys replaced by electric motors operating automatic-almost human- machines, many a slow and tedious process has been elimi- nated. The factory worker's task of yesterday is made pleasant by his command CJf this magic power. The Crane Company's plant at Chicago-electrical through- out-is a model of industrial efficiency. Its 10,000 horse- power of driving energy is brought by three small wires from a distant power plant. Then electricity drives the machinery which handles the coal for heating, cuts the steel, sifts the sand and sorts the material-in fact does everything from scrubbing the floor to winding the clock. .Such an institution is marvelous-superhuman-made thus by the man-multiplying force of electricity. The General Electric Company has been instrumental in effecting this evolution. First, by developing successful electric gener- ating and transmission apparatus to furnish ~conomically this modern torm of power. Secondly, through many years of active co-operation with hundreds of manufacturers, it has mastered the art of applying the use of electrical energy to a multitude of needs. And finally, through branch offices and other distributing channels, its products are made accessible to all. li'J.au'ling materials wifutrain..operated by: ~lectrlc automobile motors. 0 .... __....\\'ectrtc 4ia\ ~V_ sates o.m~. in ~.a & J :all targe c1tteSJ SEE THE BROGUE M ' ens at Shoes BARNEY'S LOOK!

With belts and pulleys replaced by electric motors operating automatic-almost human- machines, many a slow and tedious process has been elimi- nated. The factory worker's task of yesterday is made pleasant by his command of this magic power. The Crane Company's plant at Chicago-electrical through- out-is a model of industrial efficiency. Its 1 0,000 horse- power of driving energy is brought by three small wires from a distant power plant. Then electricity drives the machinery which handles the coal for heating, cuts the steel, sifts the sand and sorts the material-in fact does everything from scrubbing the Hoor to winding the clock. Such an institution is marvelous-superhuman-made thus by· the man-multiplying force of electricity. The General Electric Company has been instrumental in effecting this evolution. First, by developing successful electric gener- ating and transmission apparatus to furnish economically this modern form of power. Secondly, through many years o! active co-operation with hundreds of manufacturers, it has mastered the art of applying the use of electrical energy to a multitude of needs. And finally, through branch offices and other distributing channels, its products are made accessible to all. e General Office .Scb.enectadY.N:Y: lHau}ing materials wjfu,train-!lperated by electric automobaemotors. ® trtc V5·10QD SEE THE BROG'UE Men's Shoes at I[ BARNEY'S LOOK!
