Students Meet In Final Session Class Election Methods Outlined by Yunich At Monday Meeting On the first anniversary of the ::doption of the new student gov\ ~rnrnent constitution, freshmen and ..Jpperclassmen assembled in Old -:hapel yesterday morning for the rlnal student body meeting of the current year. David L. Yunich, chairman, pre- sided and explained the process of the coming elections for class offi- 2ers and student council members. He announced that class officers ,vould be nominated this weelt and elections would take place next week. These offices, he explained, have to be filled before the student council positions, because the offi- ce: s automatically become mem- bers of the student council and can- not be elected to both positions. N1rninations for the class offices will be open, while those for the 3tudcnt council will be closed. Nom· inations are to be made by the present members of the council. Prefe.r entia! ballot will be the sys- tem of election of class officers, he sa:d. The first choice will receive five votes, the second, three, the third, two, and the fourth, one. rl:e four highEst candidates will be president, vice-president, treas- urer, and secretary of the class, re- ;pectively. Detai:s of the Schenectady Com- mur.ity Chest drive we1e discussed, and the recommendation was made that the student bookstore be run on a cooperative rather than a profit basis. The recommendation was referred to the Student Coun- cil and action 'viii be taken at the meeting Wednesday night. Basing his estimates on the cost of the fence built around the Pbi Gamma Delta tennis court, Mr. Wittner estimated that a fence sur· rounding only the sidelines of the football field would coEt approxi- mately $3 000 and if it encircled the Festival's Theatre and was put up on the bank awa,y from the field, the cost would rise proportio-nately. A recent survey sho·ws that the drainage in Council Field is very good, grading and sowing of seed being the only necessary improve- ment aside from the proposed tence. Alexander Field, on the other· hand, lacks a .good drainage system and this deficiency would have to be remedied, Wittne.r stated. No Definite Plans Made Prof. Wittner announc.ed yester- day that he had not received offi- cial notice that the grant was be· ing made and that until he does, he will not be able to work out any . definite plans. He did say, how- ever, that he :ha·d written President Fox asking him for his ·position on the matter. The pledges of gifts include Mr. Baker, $500; Mr. Oppenheim for the Class of 1875, $100; Spencer B. Elddy, '21. $100; P. L. Thomson, '()0, $100; Everett L. Baker, '14, for his class, $100; Judge Arnold J. Hin- man, '99, for his class, $500; Cla~s of 1937, $50; and D. E. Griffiths, '02, for his class, $50. -IF--- Professor Peers Tells Purpose of Union Visit After being introduced by Dr. Fox as a professor of \Liverpool University and Union College,\ E. Allison Peers, speaking in Daily Assembly today, briefly described his purpose in corning ·to the cam- pus and outlined his program for his three weeks' stay. \I hope,\ Professor Peers con- cluded, \that when I go home, I will have close contact not only with the faculty of Union College but also with the students.\

Page Four Sockman Portrays Saviour as Prince And Divine Pioneer Featured Radio Speaker Urges Union of Foresight With Early Background Chl'ist was described as a \prince of or·ganizatian and a pioneer of exploration\ by Dr. Ralph W. ·sock- man, pastor of Christ Cbur.ch, New York City, as he deliver•ed a ser- mon in Sunday services at Me- modal Chapel. D1·. Sackman spoke before a congregation consisting in part of the delegates to the Na- tional Student Federation three day confe renee. Dr. Sackman said that his con- ception of a prince wa:o one of royal background, strong powers and great wealth, while a pioneer had a meager e~tate and long, for- mative future. He said, \These two characters are obvious-.ly very different, but Jesus fits both back- grounds. He was the prince of Hfe. Also, He was tha pioneer, because He started oomething so significant that we now date our calendar from His birth.\ Prin-ce and Pioneel' NPedl\d A prince is typical of the old tra- ditional background, while the pio- nPer typifies the foreground, ac- cording to Dr. Sackman. \'ho said \We need both today, better to balanre our civilization.\ 'I'he per- son who is intolerant of anything new was cited aR an example of the character of the background, while those who won't develop any- thing which is old are tyJJical of the foreground. \We must keep our background CALENDAR Today 8:00 p. m.- Lecture, Pr(;)f.

J, Hillis Miller, president of Keuka Col- lege, presented the confel'ence with a plan to malte the \college func- tion t-hrough student government\ in an addt ess at a d'inner meeting in Hale House. Dr. Miller. a mem- ber of .the national advisory board of thE> Amerirnn Youth Commis- sion, admitted that \it i~ impos- ;ible to eliminate extra-curricular activitie~ frcm the campus, but so ~ong as they aJ·e permitted to exist they must be supervisPd and man- aged as car<>fully as the offerings of the curriculum. Which is more important in moulding attitudes and in shaping- 'lives may even be a maHer of dPbate.\ In the upinion of Dr. Mil!C'r this gn•at importance necessitates joint con\ rol and \upervision of activi- ties by the students, faculty, and administration. He adv@cated the formation of a ~tudent-faculh· con- gress \organized along lines ~f stu- dent intenest.s and opetating as a ~oncrC'te illustration of democ!'atic ~overnment.\ In his conclusion, Dr. Miller urged that educator.s suppo~e \for a White ........... . ~A .......

Quoting from the last chapter of Ecclesiates, he showed that \the fear of high places\ still exists today. but he emphasl.zed the fact that it becomes greater as people grow oldet·. The family which rode up Pike's Peak was used as an example. The moth- er became frightened and lay her head on her husband's lap only to find that his lmees wen shaking and that he too was afraid. The young son, however, was hanging from the vehicle. trying his best to get closer to the edge of the precipice. Dr. Sackman praised this fearlessn.otis of youth, but said that \The trouble is when youth comes of age, it lases its ability and dar- ing to look ahead.\ Hotchkiss urged Union students to con tribute for the need of the community and for the support of the college soliciting team. \They need your support equally as much as any of your· athletic teams, foot- ball, bgsketb:1ll, or lacrosse,\ he added. In a final challenge, Hotch- ldss raid, \do you know any good reason why school children should raise money for the Chest while Union College gives only an apathetic $34?

He is a trustee of Coop·er Union Institute, Johns Hopkins University, tlle General Education Board, the Carnegie Institute (Washington), the National Geographic Society, and a member of the Board of Overseers of Har- vard University. Mrs. Stevenson's play centers around the chatacter of Challoner who is devoting his ample means and fine intelligence in the service of his country by furnishing Eng- land dispassionate information about both the Irish revolutionists and England's Continental enemies. John T. Boyt, '42, of Bloomfield, N. J., has created unusually effec- tive settings for the two plays. Al- though a freshman, his worlt this season is declared to be the best in the eleven years since the Moun- tebank,;. opened their campus thea- tre.

Barford '40, Elected Mountebanks Head Hannock '40, Installed As Student Manager: Wilder '40, Is Secretary The class of 1941 cast 298 ballots for Tirchuck. Robert Molloy was chosen as vice-president with 238. Harry Crosby, with 212 votes, and W. Bradford T. Hastings, with 197, were respectively chosen as secre tary and treasurer. Anderson nosed out Robert K. Baker for the presidency of the class of 1942. Anderson had 319 ballots cast for him while Baker had 297. Baker receives the offic<J of vice-president. William R.

Council Elections Wednesday Student Council election will be held in Daily As.cembly tomorrow, chairman Yunich announced today. Bodenstab, a neutral, has -consist- ently maintained a Dean's LiRt average. This past year .he has held the position of treasu~·er of the Student Council. He has earned a Block U in track, and is a member of the Garnet Key, the Glee Club and the Junior Prom Committee. Hammerstrom is affiliated with Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, a11d is captain-eleet of the varsity foJt- ball team. He holds membership in the Student Council, the Garnet Key, and the Juniot· .Prom Commit- tee. Burns, Theta Delta Chi, is chair- man of the Prom Commitee and a member of the Garnet Key. He has earned a Block U in football and is the 185 pound wrestling cham pion of the college. James P. Barford, '40, De1ta Upsilon, was elected· president of the Mounte-banks Theatre and will continue as production manager for 1939-40, according to an announce- ment -by Mr. Edward L. Carroll, '27, director. Barford succeeds Herbert B. Grant, '<19. The Executive Committee elect- ed a new slate of officers and new members for the committee at its meeting yesterday afternoon in Silliman Hall. Elwin W. Bannock, Jr., '40, Alpha Delta Phi, was elect- ed student manager to succeed Grant who held two offices this year. Baker was the exchange student at St. Andrews last year. He is a member of Psi Upsilon. He has won a Block U in football and has con sistently been mentioned on the Dean's List. ----OJ---- David T. Wilder, '40, Psi Upsilon, was elected a member of the exec- utive committee and its secretary to succeed :Jay P. Dayton, '40, who will, however, continue as a mem- ber of the committee. Unemployment Menacing Democracy, Says Meany Others Elected Other members elected to the executive committee which selects the plays, casts and production Etuff for the Montebanks and controls its policies, were Henry S. Mea.!ow, Neutral, '40, John T. Boyt, '42, Kap- pa Sigma, and Andrew V. Speziali, '42, Sigma Chi. Meadow is master electrician; Boyt was scene designer for all the productions this year; and Speziall played leading roles in two plays and appeared in another play. The election of freshman to the Executive committee is with- out precedent. The brilliance of their achivement this year made both Boyt and Speziali eligible for the Executive Committee, accurd- ing to Carroll. The Mountebanks also elected Clarence H. McCain, '41, and Roger D. MarshaJ.l, '41, assistant student managers. Keys will be awarded the follow- ,ing for their achievement in the Mountebanks: Christopher Cam- mack, '41, (now out of college), Meadow, Bannock, Dayton, Bar- ford, and Wilder. A budget for 1939-40 was also adopted, subject to the approval of the Student Tax Committee. New officers will be installed at the next meeting, scheduled for the week following Prom. Nothing is more menacing to our democracy than a condition in which those who are working are unable to obtain ample wages and work. under proper conditions. Trade unionism is the means of improving this condition and .thus take an important place in the de- fense of democracy whieh the country has increasingly found necessary in the face of ·political philosophies of the past few years, George Meany, president of the New York State Federation of Labor, told the student body in daily assembly this morning. Every action of trade unionism, according to Meany, is to the end of advancing the status of the worker. Any attempt to use the trade union movement for political ends is to defeat the purpose of uni1>nism and to discredit it in the eyes of the public, Labor must also be constantly on its guard against the isms of the totalitarian states which many who filter into the trade unions attempt to foster. The success of .the unions lie in re- mammg in their every action wholly American. Mea.ny further stated· that the State Labor Relations Act is the Magna Carta of Labor. He felt it is providing the necessary personal con tact of our earlier economy which was lost with the rise of corporate absentee ownership in om· industrial development. The Labot• Board provides a medium of personal conference for the. settling of mutual problems and difficulties.

Isstte Editor ................. Robert Schulberg Assistants Tuesday, May 9, 1938 DRY AND FAIRER? With $2,100 already pledged toward the repairing of Alexander Field by the Gl·ad- uate Council, as well as by individual mem- torials, the repairing of the field is not a luxury, but is an inevitable step, and as Pro- fessor Wittner indicates in his letter, the cost of putting it in order increases as time progresses. ln the meantime, football games are spoiled from all aspects, baseball games are cancelled, our athletes are exposed to in- jury, revenue is lost, and good will of both spectatars and visiting teams is alienated. It is all very well to state that the field must be repaired, and list reasons to sub- stantiate the contention, but this does not remedy the situation. Before any steps can be taken, the wherewithal to finance the work must be forthcoming. The logical ques- tion as to the source of these funds is a dif- ficult one to answer; President Fox has in- dicated that he does not feel that the Ad- ministration is in a position to finance the necessary work. The Graduate Council has, therefore, set out to raise the money from alumni. Speaking for the undergraduate body of Union, The Concordiensis wishes the Council complete success in its campaign, and • pledges whatever assistance it can render_ Practically the entire $370,000 being ex- bers of the Council, and with the appoint- ment of a committee, led by Mr. Dickinson Griffith, to further this work, it appears that at last the ball has started to roll, and the prospects or an improved Alexander Field now appem· brighter than ever before. . pended on the new gymnasium at Hamilton Co-llege was raised by alumni contributions. Union needs but a .small fraction of that amount, Professor Wittner having set the figure at approximately $15,000, and we have no reason to believe that there is any less loyalty in the ranks of Union men than Hamilton men boast. We do feel, however, It is with the purpose of attempting to keep this ball rolling that The Concordiensis i.s devoting today's editorial page to a delin- eation of the crying- need of this impl·ove- ment. The photographs, on this page, taken less than ten days ago, depict the condition of the field far more vividly than could thousands o-f words, and the letters fr<Jm President Fox and the team coaches and cap- tains represent the sentiments of men who are most vitally affected by the present state of the field. If there is a more democratic institution at Union than Alexander Field we cannot re- call it. Her.e all distinctions are forg-otten. Engineer and liberal arts student, fraternity man and neutral, freshman and senior, ace quarterback and third string pitcher,--'all become candidates to represent their alma mater here. In improving this field we are not aiding one division of study, one class, or one gl'Oup, but we are improving a facility common to all Union. No one will question the statement that the chances for accidents and injuries are gr!::!atly increa::>ed on a muddy field. Certai11- that a contribution from the student body in the form of a grant from the Student Council fund would do much to prove that we are sincerely interested in and concerned with the imp-rovement of the field.

Track Is Soggy To the Editor: Injuries· Prevalent To the Editor: It is encouraging to know that the present unsightly appearance and poor physical condition of Alexander Field will soon be rem- edied. In the first place we have in the location of this playing field one of the finest of nat ural seetings for athletic events, there being few college against whom we compete whose fields are so ideally situated. Opposing coaches and players have admitted this fact but generally pr·efaced their remarks by com- ment on the deplorable condition of the ground. Its present cond.t- tion not only evoked criticism by opponents but has drawn also nu- merous comments from many of the hundreds of daily passers-by. In brief, adequate repair will create better feeling between our oppon- Runners Handicapped To The Concordiensis: In the seven of the eight years that I have been at Union College the track team has been hampered by surface water both on the track and in the jumping pits. Our sea- son generally opens on the last Saturday in April and it is very unusual if our jumpers are able to practice in the pits for two weeks. fhis year our broad jumpers com- peted against Army without a sin- gle day of practice. This not only puts us at a disadvantage against our opponents but also is danger- ous inasmuch as the jumpers are liable to strain muscles that are not properly conditioned. The runners work under even a worse handicap. Surface water makes it impossible to roll the track and consequently the soft un- derfooting taltes Its toll upon the legs of our runners. This year our ·men were unable to practice under anything like favorable conditions until the Wednesday before the first meet. In order that our· runners might have a semi-dt-y track it is necessary to bail out several of the worst spots and the \drainage canals\ that make lhis practice pos- sible are dangerous. In 1932 om· leading miler turned his angle in one of the holes and was incapaci- tated for the rest of the season. Generally our men look as though they are playing leap-frog dodging the water puddles instead of de- veloping rhythm which is so essen- tial to the properly conditioned runner. The team as a whole looks for- ward to competing away from home for it allows them an oppor\ tunity to turn in their best per- formances. Conversely our oppon- ents dislike to compete in Schenec- tady for we have the slowest track of any of our usuaJ rivals. I sincerely hope that our track and jumping pits will he adequately drained in order that candidates for the team will be enabled to train under safe and favorable conditions. Sincerely, BILL KETZ. (Continued on Page 4) He1·e at Uni<ln we have an interesting paradox - a track that will hold w~Joter and a hockey rink that won't. We members of the track team are not much concerned about the hockey rink but we are ashamed to ask visiting teams to perform on a. kack that is not only soggy anod slow but also completely submerged in spots.

The mud and wa- tel' made the game very listless and disagrecbale to watch. What could Union have done on a d1 y field?

SCHENECTADY, N.Y. G~E tilm~~~,~~~o<h FLOATI·NG POWER T HE surging waves of a stormy sea are beautiful to an artist, disconcerting to a food-loving passcnge1·, but just another problem to an engineer. Whenever a sleek ocean liner plows her bmv through a heaving swell, her engines .feel an added load, and her captain wonders if the tuel will last. So, c;.E engineers built an all-electric meter that will accurately measure the power put out by the propeller of any boat, from a tiny tug to a transat!.an tic greyhound, The meter is essentially a combination of two electric generators mounted a little distance away from each other on the propeller shaft, and connected to instru- ments which can 'be located at any point on the ship. The generators are so mounted that at no load the \\dtages generated are exactly 180 degrees apart in phase and there- fore add to zero. When a load is ·placed on the revolving shaft; the torque causes a small angular twist in the shaft; consequently, the two generated voltages no longer add to zero. The the shaft twist and the propeller speed, and hence the meter can be made to read directly in horsepower. The installation can easily be modified to indicate .total horse- power-hours and to write an automatic log of the power delivered during the trip. Among the G~E engineers who developed the device are A. V. Mershon, Pratt Insti- tute '13 and Union College '15, and C. I. Hall, U. of Illinois '10.

These have been placed in a special room in the General Electric Research Laboratory at m3nus :20 degrees Fahrenheit, sprayed with water, and tested when coated with ice to a thickness of one and a half inches.

Peers Speaks On Spanish Culture The Spanish people are divided in temperament and character and do not mix easily because they are literally isolated in eight regions by geographical walls which have not yet been surmounted by mod- ern communication methods, ac- cording to E. Allison Peers, pro- fessor of Spanish at the University of Liverpool, England, visiting pro- fessor at Union in his address in Old Chapel on Wednesday evening. Stating that for political reasons alone, Spanish should be learned, Professor Peers pointed out that this language is \the key to the thoughts and actions of 160,000,000 people in Spain and Spanish Amer- ica.\ The most important reason for studying the language, according to the speaker, is to .be able to understand the true meaning of Spanish culture and literature. In this re&pect, he referred to the works of Cervantes, da Vega and Calderon. Professor Peers, who has been in residence on the campus sinc11 April 28, will leave on May 18.

It is la- mentable that something which had as good a beginning as this should be allowed to die out. The University of Chicago holds an- nually an Interfraternity Song Fest in the famous sunken gardens of that institution; and although the college is not one of the largest or most widely publicized school in the country, the occasion always attracts thousands of people, and is bmadcast over one of the national networks. The singing of colleg·e and fraternity songs by the students is something that is interesting to many people, and there are ve1·y few times when outsiders are privileged to hear them.

The n-ight before the Sche- nectady concert she sang the \Die Walkuere\ Bruen-hilde and folloW- ed· with the \Siegfried\ and \Goet- terdaemmerung\ Bruenhildes on Wednesday and F.riday nights re- spectively. These are probably in- terspersed with othet· incidental concerts and rehearsals. There are few voices, if any, which could stand a steady exploitation such as this. The miracle is that Flagstad can be consistently acceptable in spite of the tremendous demand her popularity places on her voice. In Richard Strauss' '\Caecilie she came the closest to the high stand- ard she set for herself in \Im Het·bst.\ Madame Flagstad's sec- ond group consisted of songs by her compatriot Norwegians, Hur- um, Alnaes, and Grieg. By far the most moving was the nostalgic '\Blonde Naetter,\ by Hurum. We had never heard this song before. but it immediately took its place among our favorite lieder. As an encore to this group, she sang \Ein Traum\ by Grieg. With the exception of \Sea Moods,\ by Mildred- Tyson, the thil'd group, sung in English and French, was quite a disappoint- ment. It has become almost axio- matic that Mme. Flagstad is never at her best except in Wagnerian operas and German lieder, as evi- denced by her complete failure to do justice to \Silent Night\ in the annual Christmas broadcast. Fol' some inexplicable reason, her art can not adapt itself to the lighter English ballads. It was only in \Sea Moods\ that an opportunity was offered her to exercise her unique dramatic talent. This criti· cism applies even mor·e strongly to her encore, \Morning by Oley Speaks. It was lil<e coming from a totally foreign land to one's familiar home environment w.hen Mme. Flagstad climaxed her concert with the \Elizabeths· Gebet\ and \Dich Teure Halle\ from Wagner's \Tannhauser Her own self-con- fidence and authority seemed to in· crease when she presented this music· through which she has .be- come one of the leading singers of the world. Especially in the last ar·ia did we feel the tremendous power and heroic s·cope of her sub- lime art. The simpering Mr. Edwin Mc- Arthur did ~- sympathetic job of ac- companying, although his person- ality was always in sharp contrast with that of the featured artist. l;.i[IJ iII Starting 'l'ODA Y!

IN THE MAIL Dear Culls from the Press, Your c0lumn of Friday, May 5, was very interesting-so much so that I consid€1' It worthy of an an- swer. You say, \While it would be ad· mirable for college students to be well informed about world events, no college student has ever both- ered to wonder why.\ That seems to be somewhat the case at Union but your statement holds no water if applied to hundreds of other col- leges and universities, and may I add, \Thank God for that!\ If you have conception of the forces of life beyond this Schenectady ivory tower, you will realize that such information. such interests are of the utmost value, ever indispensa- ble, to each and all of us. And I would be deeply ashamed to be re- sponsi-ble for -any such statement as you have so confidently made. Evi- dently you find blindness a state of bliss. Yes, I would have the student erect \monumeuts of erudition\ to himself, as an individual and as a body. Comprehension and expres- sion demand knowledge of funda- mentals. Every graduate will find such comprehension, expression, and knowledge concerning the mat- ters in question the most potent of his mental functions. The perils of national and international epilepsy have no floodgates to shut them off from an influence in every man's existence. Why shouldn't the student \in- crease his conversational reper- toire?\ What matters of talk are of more moment than those advo- cated? Take a look into the fields of government, business, agricul- ture, even teaching-smal'l talk and local news· are minor consider- ations. The earnest tongue and sound mind live on meat, not cup- cakes. Any man who does not \make a pertlous attempt to understand the tremendous forces at work today 11 is a '\.VOrthless 1nan, and as stu- dents, when we fail het·e, we fail in one of the primary duties an.d requisites of manhood.\ And why shouldn't the student \'enable himtself) to play an effec- tive part in democratic govern- ment?\' Don't you realize one of the greatest criteria of democracy is the sluggishness and indifference of its citizens towards their govern- ment? Yet you seem to advocate the continuance of such indiffer- ence. I don't understand why. ·well, there are the answers to your questions. Perhaps you only ~eant to interrogate rhetorically; tf so, no answers seemed inherent therefrom. and I fpJt it my duty to supply them. I'm tired of mental laissez-faire here. The alarm was sounded, yet only you seem to have been wak- ·ened, and then in an apparent op- position. Union must have an alert and participating group which will serve as a medium for undergrad- uate expression. It is the intention of some of us to bring about such a. group next fall; what its form a.nd procedures will be only time and experience will telL Respectfully yours, M.

His survey shows that since January 11, when the group was organized, more than ten br·oadcasts have been produced by the Workshop, while members have participated in severa-l other programs. The Radio Workshop was organi- zed by John S·heehan, '25, program manager of the General Electric shoz·t wave stations in Schenec- tad~·, and Milton M. Enzer, '29, as- sistant to the President for public announcement~. to provide Union men with an opportunity to get ac- tual rad-io exper·ience in all fields: acting, announcing, writing and p10dueing. An Executive Committee of seven st11dents, headed by Mr. Sheehan as Director and Mr. Enzer as adviser was formed, Fifty men are on the rostet· of the Worksho.p, although all have not been active. Since its .formation, the group has produced an educational pro- gram dealing with some phase of !He at Union College on the fourth Monday of each month, These pro- grams have been broadcast by W2XAD and W2XAF, the local short wave stations. Included among the subjects, which have been dealt with in this series, are fraternity life at Union, Founder's Day, musica:l activities at Union and educational facilities at Union. Another program is .scheduled for May 22 at 4 p. m. Faculty and administration offi- cials have aided the \V'orkshop in their regular Monday broadcasts. Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox spoke briefly at the opening of two of the pres- entations, Dr. Elmer Tidmarsh played the ot·gan on one, and Dr. Burges Johnson, Dr. Harold Lar- rabee, and Dr. Peter Wold con- ducted a roundtable discussion in the most recent program.

Prom is over, and once ag-,lin l'nion settles clown to its routine academic ta~ks. There i:s little doubt that, as in past ~·ears, the event was a definite social success. The much maligned band was enthu::;iastically received by most of the skeptics. and the g-eneral c;nnment was that \everyone had a good time.\ ).h·. Bm·ns and the rest of the Prom Committee are to be commended for their efforts. Candidates for membersl1ip to the Student Tax Committee are interviewed and selected on a basis of ability, and we fail to see any reason why this system would not work for the P1·om Committee. To appease the sting of thi:;; loss of democracy, the student body could honor its most popular members by yoting· them honorary membe1·ship in the committee, with attendant free bids, or sup- ply them with some other recog·nition. HYGIENE At one time l 1 nio-n sponsored a com·se for freshman in h,vgiene, requiring attendance at weekly lectures throughout the year and a final examination in the course. It began to degene1·ate when the examinations became somevvhat ,stereotyped and we1·e rather m- efficiently proctored. Since that time it has sunk further into the nature of a farce, until at the present time meetings are ,started but seldom last for more than two Ol' three months of the school year. The college has seen fit to omit the examination from the course, reducing the course to nothing more than optional lectures. The cunent issue of the college catalogue describes it as lectures included in a course in physical education. There is no less need 110w than formerly for instmction in hygiene, especially in the social emphasis of this matter. The nation at the pn~sent time is feeling the impact of propaganda for intelligent and enlightened action on the question of syphiHis, one of the outstanding considerations in personal and social hygiene. Union seems out of tune with the times in its lack of emphasis on this in- struction for freshmen. the willingness to go through rna- neon and then hooked up with a And who was the lad who get tions, the abject mimicry of ideas P.si U heshman--her roommate had: a telegtam from his girl at ~ot­ and attitudes without any attempt earlier in the week thrown fhe Psi neH that she would be in on the at an under·stand:ng of them.

This editorial is not intended as an indictment of the mem- bers of these committees, as these men did thei1· utmost to make these events both social and financial successes. If, however, in spite of the efforts of the committeef; of the pa~t two ,\·ems, deficits have t·esulted from these Proms, it is obvious that our system is at fault. Apparently well- founded rumors have been ci.rculated cia im- ing that the Prom is to be abolished as an institution, that a new system of selection to the committee is to be adopted, a.nd that there will be no more \big name\ band dances at Union. Possibly these rumors are based upon fact-we do not know, nor pre- tend to know. \Ve do know, howeve1·, that the Prom has lost several hundred dollal's in the past two years, and that this money must l.Je supplied by the Student Tax Fund.

Ted claims that the thing he misses het e above all else is the convenience of being able to call up a freshman, when unable to navigate the homewa1d trek, and have said freshman call for you with a wheelbarrow to convey you to your abode. We've heard of lots of different modes of transporta- tion, but we've never heard of trav- eling in a wheelbarrow. It sounds like a good proposition to us. Some- thing to add to the Union tradi· tions. Knowing Ted, we knew that soon- er or latE.'r he would come to the matter of drinks, and he did. We nave very little to adoi to the ones that can be obtained in the \Old Country.\ The ones that he had never run up agamst before are the ones mixed w1th Coca Cola. Friday, June 2-2 p, m.

The absence of ca;rs doesn't hamper them any over there. They have just as much fun as we do. Maybe more. Of course, we don't see why Ted should think that om little social occasion8 are any wilder than theirs, but he does. Maybe it's the type of girls that we have over here, but we can't help that. And from the little bits that we could gather, we decided that maybe the American girls are the reasons for Ted's little bursts of cynicism. And at that, we don't blame him. We get a little bit fed at times, too. As long as he doesn't judge us he~e by the girls we have, though, we won't wony. He thinks that Union men are all tight, and that's all that matters. As for the wild week-ends-he isn't at all averse to them, as nearly everyone knows. So maybe he can teach the lads at St. Andrews a few things about having a good time when he goes back there next year.

Wyatt, faculty advisor of the Club, who discloeed yesterday afternoon that the plans arc being laid to hold the roast on Monday, May 22. Since the occasion will be the fi- nal off'icial meeting of the club for the current year, it is hoped by Mr. W~ att that it will be well sup- ported. Pe<;ervations may be made with either Wyatt or Burton Olm- stead, newly elected president of the club. A ~,;harge of app1 oximately In some respects, Union Pacific is the best DeMioJ!e picture in years. 'Cecil B., you knaw, has been ham- met·ing away at these epical themes for qui~e a while without any no- table success, but it looks to these jaundiced eyes as i.f he's finally built something pretty substantial. With the story of the Union Pa- cific tailroad as mortar, Ceci'l's lit- tle pestle has pounded out a rou- tine romance, redolent of •lavender and old burlap and Barbara Stan- wyck. Telling the story would be equivalent to cataloguing the aged devices that make scenarios creak. It's not important. What is important, however, is everything that takes place when the story proper has been pushed aside to rnalfe way for shots of the actuaol track-laying, most of which are so well done that the¥ loa!{ like process shots borrowed from n e w s r e e I s . These \tmnsi tlon\ scene& are responsible for most of the appeal of Union Pacific; when the camera focuses again upon the aflahs of Miss Stanwyck a;nd Joel McCtea, the story relaxes into dormancy. As we see it, the cast isn't im- pot·tant. But if it were, we'd men- tion the names of McCrea, Over- man, Tamiroff and Preston. The management at Proctor's h2s apparently chosen to hold the pictUie over until Saturday, audi- ence or no audience. You'll find it much too long, overburdened with anti-climax. and pretty tiresome at times . . . but worth seeing any- way. Mr. Disney's in the barnyard, amusingly enough. • * * Down at the State, Oliver Hardy, sho1·n of his Laurel, is assisting Billie Burke, Harry Langdon and others in Zenobia. This is all about the elephant and its persistent memory, and well swear we've seen it before, but it must have been a long time ago. <Continued from Page 3) Villanova, reputedly one of the most powerful college nines in the East, was only able to eke out a 2 to 0 win ovet· the Pur,ple.

In tts match with Colgate, the tennis team will a·ffect the same lineup that has been used through- out the seas0n. Marve Dwore, Ed Jackma-n, Bob Carr, Captain Ben Rathbun, Doug Murphy and: George Miller will play singles in that or- der. :Dwore and Jackman, Cart· and Rathbun, and Murphy and Morri- son will be the three doubles teams. Bowler and Bmkhuic are the top men in the Colgate aggregation. With one victory under its belt in its only start to date, the year- ling baseball team will be a slight favorite to defeat Troy High School in tomorrow's game. Coach Hal Wittner will start Dave Clowe, his hurling discovery, on the mound, with Sherry Hillick behind the bat. The players in the order in which they will bat are Ned Reilly, second base: George Coley, third base; Hillick, catcher; Ered Chesebro, shortstop; Abe Dorsman, l'ight field; Andy Speziali first base; Mickey Rasso, left field; Jack Ehrcke, center field; and Clowe, pitcher. $.50 will be made for the function, Coach Frede1 ic A.

Roger Busha, '39, will be Grand Marshall. Procession Order Given The procession will begin at nine o'clock and enter Memorial Chapel in reverse order, with the Fresh- men leading. The Juniors, Sopho- mores, a,nd Freshmen will form a double line in front of Memorial Chapel and applaud while the sen- ior file oast into the chapel. In the actual mcv:ng-up process, the seniors will leave their regular seats as juniors, sophomores, and freshmen move into the seats they will occupy next year. The sopho- mores are requested to form a pro- cession in the right aisle, because it will be easier for them to get to the junior section. The seniors will take the balcony seats vacated by the freshmen. Jesse Sherman and Bob Hinckle will sing the \Alouette\ song, re- vealing the foibles and weaknesses of the out going seniors. When the classes move, the seniors will sing their class song. Life passes to Union athletic con- tests will be presented managers and captains of athletic teams.

Peers ,Ends Campus Stay Today Discoursing upon \Religion Edu- cation and Patriotism,\ Professor E. Allison Peers, Gilmour Professo.r of Spanish Literature at the Un.r- versity of Liverpool, delivered hts final talk :o Union college student\ in Memorial chapel on Thursday morning. On Satu~day Professor Peers is sailing for England from New York. Professor Peers thanked the stu- dents and the faculty of the college for bearing with him during his lecture and also wished good bye to lhe horn player who had kept him awake. \I give my blessing to the good and the evil. ones,\ he said. Professor Peers sa1d that the Con- cordiensis was the only colle_ge new~aper which fai_Ied to qmzz him on foreign affall's. He also stated that he felt he was out of touch with European affairs when in the Southwest because of the lack of interest shown by the peo- Jlle and lack of news in the ~apers on European affairs. Here m the East that wss not noticeable. Pl'O- fess~r Peers named several books which he felt that students must read to give them a background in order to understand the day by day events abroad. An examination of these boolts in the library by him revealed that one had been taken out by students once, and an- other read once by a member of the faculty. A third not at all. Religion, he said, was. in. one's own conscience and that rt drd not matter to which denomination one belonged. It was also up to. a person to educate himself. PatriOt- ism he believed was inherent. This was Professor Peers' sb~ly­ eighth lecture deUvered in Amertca, he said, and added that it was also to be his last.

Mcst of this academic ritual is the result of casua.J accumulaticm through the centuries. At Union College, the custom of passing the jug and the Dutchman's pipe at the last senior get-together has been ma-intained steadily. Further- more. Gardner Cottrell Leonard, M.A., Ph.D., LI.D. in a pamphlet \The History of the Academic Gown,\ relates that Union was one of the first four colleges in the UNited States of America to make use of the fm·mal cap-and-gown garb during commencement exer- cises. Mr. Leonard, continuing his ex· planation, points out that the uni- versities of the eleventh and twelfth centuries were consistent in lacking comfortable accommo- dations for their students. They believed that a conscientious pur- suit of learning in the traditional ttivium and mathematics would keep the book-delvet·s from notic- ing such casual discomforts as cold blasts of air whistling through classrooms and snow drifting un- der benches. Whether or not the student ·bodies acclimated themselves to these phenomena is not revealed by Gardner Cottrell Leonard in his tome. but he does tell us that the1•e was a .suddent strange increase in such extra-curricular activities as oneumon.Ja and the lilte. In self de- fense, the disciples of art and lit- erature adopted what seems a most practical custom in wearing warm. yet comfortable classt·oom attire. Black was an appropriate color because it retains heat, as every- one knows ... even twelfth cen- tur-y students. The hat, with its 1 ound bottom and square top, was selected because it shed rain and/or snow more readily than hats of other design. As the CJUest of knowledge be- came less and less of a battle with the elements, these ancestors of caps and gowns began to grow thinner, but were still retained. And that brings us, in tht·ee inches of type, five hundred years to the in- stitution of colleges in America at which time the caps and gowns were stowed away on the same moth eaten vessels that brought over the books for the American colleges. But the students in Amer- ica, rna ny of whom had to carry rifles for Indian protection while in class, could not be bothered with anything like caps and gowns so their us became less and less fre- quent until finally they- were con- fined only to such important events as Commencements. Thus the seniors will graduate on June 12 at the Union College Memorial Chapel capped and gowned. And now they know why. W. Neil B. Loudon Named . By St. Andrews Senate · To Study Here Next Year w.

In past years the conducting of the Union- Skidmol'e freshman parties has been the sole duty .of the group, but indications at present at·e that this function is to be tumed over to the Garnet Key Society next fall. ·we are not berating the Terrace Council, no1· attempting to question its existence, but we do question its present status as a pu1·ely h onol'ary organization, especially when we recall that at one time it was the most vital ol'ganization on the campus. Thel'e is no doubt that the Council, steeped in tradition as it is, could probably continue to exist as a strictly honorary group, but if this is to be the case, there will certainly be a loss of• }Hestige and decline of the group as a cam- pus institiition. Our suggestion is to delegate the Terrace Council some authority and give it something to do. Certainly it is a waste of talent to permit this group, composed of seven men \Vho have proved their mettle and ability in othe1· fields, to be entirely inactive. The Council is too much an integral part of Union tradition to allow it to die slowly of inactiv- ity. An attempt at revitalization should be afforded it. In the past two years it has become in- creasingly apparent that the smaller less pretentious dances of the All-College and Jn- tel'fraternity val\iety are becoming more pop- ular at Union. Why, then, would it not be a worthwhile experiment to have the Student Council assign one of these dances to the Terrace Council, and allow it to have com- plete charge of the function? The damce could be called the Terrace Ball, or be given some such appropl\iate title. In brief, our suggestion is-keep Te1·race Cuullcil alive uy giving it something to do. And so lads, what do you say vou seek a bit of variety in your entertainment-try Little Or'Phan Annie, for example-and grow up. WEEK'S BEST ED ITO RIAL Food for Thought For the last few months, we have heard almost incessant threats of war. OppQsing these threats, there have been nume1·ous pleas for peace, as well as definite action tal<en toward that end. This action has ranged from weak diplomatic bluffing and outright concession on one hand, to stern, ulunt warnings on the o-ther. The one thing, though, that is character- istic of all steps taken, is that they deal <lilly ·with surface factors of war. That is, they try to end war by tinkering with its results, rather than its causes. Practically all racial differences, territorial disputes, minority uickering, etc., are direct resiiits from past wars, and only as such they are factors in the cause of future wars. Now the efforts made to alleviate these surface ills are deserving of praise, but isn't it time that steps were taken to remedy this dangerous situation at its root\? That ro<lt is to be found in international economics. Through short.,sighted, greedy, power~eco­ nomics, the stronger nations have built up a system of high trade barriers which have served to stifle intemational commerce. Naturally, nations who have been refused the opportunity to buy needed materials and products at fair exchange, will take steps to gain them by force. This leads to \aggres- sion\ and war. This same poisonous system. is t·esponsible for the hopeless attempts at self sufficiency and isolation which goes so far to lower the standard of living in any country concerned, and which brings about internal political and economic unrest and even revolution. If we are ever to have the economic peace and quiet which is a prerequisite to las-ting world peace, it must come through fuller co- operation between nations. When nations be- come so inter-dependent that it is absolutely impossible for them to exist without each other, we may begin to hope for true world peace. -The Franklin OUR COLLEGIATE CONTEMPORARIES \Personality is the most important character- istic on whicb both men and women base thj>ir judgments of the opposite sex\ according to a poll conducted by the SWARTHMORE PHOE- - NIX.

Opens Six Game Week-End Schedule Against Nietmen Today The 44th renewal of the Union College-Rensselaer Poly- technic Institute baseball rivalry will take place this after\ noon at Cooperstown, N. Y. when the Dutchmen tangle with the \Figh hng Engineers\ as pat't of th€ centennial celebra- tion of the inauguration of baseball. Besides the varsity baseball game.~-----------­ six other Union teams .pe,rform this week-end, including the varsity tennis team which meets City Col- lege of New York this afternoon on the Union coul'ts. The .present Gar- net squad will be out to avenge the 9 to 0 whitewashing it suffered at the haB.ds ·0f the Violet last year. Tomorrow the varsity tennis team will again see action when lt jour- neys to Middlebury, Vt., to be ~n­ tertained by the Panthe!'s. The Mid- dlebury match will be the seventh of the season for Union and th'l final contest will take place a week from tomol'row in Troy against the Cherry and White. Track Team ut Home The only team at horne tomor- row will be the varsity Hack and field team which entertains Ver- mont UNiversity. The Garnet will be seeking its third straight win, and the chances for the victo1·y are good. The varsHy golf team participate3 ,n its sixth contest of the cuJTen! seascn when it travels to Hamil- ton, N. Y., to engage Colgate Uni- versity in the second of a home- and-home series. In the fit·st match played on the Mohawk Golf Clul> course, Colgate won, 7 to 2. Both lacrosse teams will be ac- tive in Williamstown, Mass., as the varsity tangles with the Sons of Ephriam and the freshmen will at- tempt to keep their record clean in a match with the yearling squad representing Williams. The line- ups for both teams will ·be the same as these which has seen corn· petition in previous contests. The freshman squad is favored to win, but it looks as though the varsity will suffer its seventh consecutive defeat of the season in the final engagement. Co-captains Doug Blue and Hank Clay, the only two sen- iors on the squad, will be playing their final lacrosse game for their Alma Mater. In the 43 years of Union-R.P.I. baseball rivalry thus far the Dutch- men have won 32 of the games while the Cherry and White has been satisfied with a mere eleven victories. The first game in the se- ries was played in 1868 and the game tomorrow will mark the 71st year of the rivalry, while it is one of several games scheduled be- tween college and major league teams which mark the 100th anni- versary of baseball. A large delegation of students and faculty is expected to be at the game tomorrow. Besides the game, a county song festival has been planned In which all the school children of Otsego County will sing. Gar,net :Nine Loses To WiHiams 1 7-6, In Tenth Inning Brod liler Hits Homer Myers, 1urdick Execute Triple Play; AI Mould Goes Route for Dutchmen The Union vat·sity diamond squad lost a tight game to Williams Col- lege at Williamstown Wednesday as the Pur·nle won 7 to 6 in ten innings. Ce.nterfielder Fitzgerald's single with one d@wn in the tenth ~cored Larr-y DurL·el! with the win- ning tally. AI Mould went the distance for the Dutchmen. He gave up only eleven hits. but his walking nine was a factor in the Purple vic- tO! y. Dur·ing the first seven innings he wal11ed at least one man each inning. His wildness is attl'ibuted to his inexperience under fire. A feature of the game was a triple play with Captain Frankie Myers and AI Turchick in on the kilL Hazard, Williams initial sack- er, lined to Myers when the Purple had men on first and third and the hit and run was on. Myers snagged the drice, tagged Seay who was coming inti> second and then threw to third baseman Al Turchick who caught Fox off third base. The Dutcllmen were trailing 4 to 6 when they came to bat in the sixth by virtue of four Epht·aim runs in the fifth. Rathlev, first bat- ter, doubled and Charley Brockner, who also homered, tripled him home. Hadley's wild pitch allowed Broclmer -to score the tying tally.

The game lasted three hours and a half m which six and one-half innings we1·e played. A combined total of 63 runs, 52 hits, and 20 errors were made. Four \throwers\ took the mound for the Trojans and •gave up 34 hits, while Coach Hal Wittner sent four pitchers to the mound for Union's cause. Andy Speziali led the attack for the winners with three singles and three doubles in six trips. Perhaps a world's record was established in, the fifth inning when the first six Union hitters, Speziali, Rasso, Phil- lips, Ehrcke, Shell, and Reilly cracked out doubles. It was in this inning the neophytes scored 14 runs on 12 hits, seven of them doubles. George Shell gets credit for the win, but he was relieved in the fifth with no one down by Fred Chesebro who struck out five Troy batters in the two innings he worked. rn the second inning Chesebro hit the ball out of the park in deep center field.

May 24, 1939 AU REVOIR, DAVE In a few hours, a new Student Council chairman will be elected, and \Dave\ Yunich will officially tum the reins over to his suc- cessor. We do not intend to wax in a maud- lin vein, nor do we wish to add to the words of praise that Dave deserves-the Bailey Cup is a fal' more fitting testimonial to his ability, personalit;..'. and achievements than any words of om·s might prove. To list his contl'ibutions to his alma mater would be an almost impossible assignment. We all recall, however, the judicious manner in which he has guided the Student Council in its first vear under the new functional arrangement: It was up to Dave to \make or break\ the new Council, and we do not think anvone will deny that he definitely \made\ the governing body an efficient one. The task of the new Council head will be made infinitely easier by the pioneering work of his predecessor. Little will be gained by merely mentioning these many contributions but they all total to the \good man and swell guy\ appraisal of Dave and his efforts by the entire college. Au Revoir, Dave.

Beer is no longer something to be discus- sed in hushed voices on the campus, and in view of the liberal attitude taken by the ad- ministration on this matter in relation to granting permission for bee1· parties, we see no reason why Union publications should not be permitted to solicit beer advel'tising, especially in view of the fact that several of the \bettel'\ institutions have granted this right to their newspape1·s and annuals. We have advocated, futilely we admit, for some Utopian scheme by which members of the Student Council will be elected on a basis of ability instead of popularity or athletic ability. We hope, some day, to see a Council wh:ch does not resemble a roste1· of the foot- ball and basketball teams with a few publi- cations representatives to round it out- We are definite opposed to a Prom Committee chosen by popularity election, and expect to \bear the torch\ for an appointed group in the coming rear. Finally, but foremost in our opmwn, we have attempted to awaken the student body, the administration, and the alumni to the crying need for grading and resurfacing Alexander Field, and we intend to bend every effort possible to effect the improve- ment of this facility.

IN THE MAIL To the Editor: It is a lamentable fact that the Union Col!ege ft•aternities should exhibit such an apathetic attitude toward the interfi-aternity song contest that has been held here fo1· so many years. Formerly, at the beginning of the series of contests, there was a certain amount of interest shown by thE' various chapters; but as time goes on, and the Union men become more worldly and find so many more wo1·thwhile things with which to occupy their time, the in- terest in the ocrasion dPclinPs rap- idly. It is Jogicnl that interest in some- f thing new £•hould be greater than It is, apparently, one of the paradoxes o that in something which is already human nature that luxul'ies and objects of established. but fraternity men are d d supposed to be endowed with the beauty close at hand are to be neg·lecte an necessary intelligence to distinguish overlooked, whereas tribute is generously between something worthwhile and something which is of no note. paid to these beauty spots when they are The Spring Night song-fest is an located at some distance. occasion th 1t could bring much favorable publicity to both the T11at these beauty s,pots at home are very college and the fraternities, if it _tpL to be overlooked is perhaps nowhere wer.e C'ntei·cd into with the proper spirit.

But about the best that can be expected in the dashes is a second in the hundr·ed and another sec- ond in the 220. Annese should take the half mile, but the mile event must be conceded to the En- gineers. Conceding Bodenstab a second in the shot-put and a first in the d.!scus, the final score should read about 58-68, with Union scoring no points in the pole vault or the javelin. Fresh from the conquest af the unbeaten Middlebury team, the varsity tennis tea.m should expect little trouble in downing the R. P. I. court squad in Troy, also on Satueday. The other teams in action will be the fre.shman tennis and base- ball outfits. The yearling nine should have an easy win over the Albany Academy team, when they travel to the ca. pi tal on Friday, but the outcome of the tennis matches here with the R. P.

Coach Bill Harlmess substituted every man avaiJ.able, totalln.g three, as the team was playing without the serv- ices .of Merle F:ay, Chucl{ Passe, Hank Clay and Faul Rieger. Wil- liams substituted 12 men. In the first period, the Garnet ten outplayed th.e opponents and led at the end by 2-1, on goals by co-Captain Doug Blue and Jack Gulbert. In the ne:xt period, Wil- Uams extra-man power began to tell, as the Union men began to tire and fell behind rapidly. Dud Holmes playecl. a magnifi- cent game in the goal, making al- most impossible saves, resulting in stopping 20 Williams' shots. Even after being knoclled nearly uncoz;- scious. he continued to play untJl the last few ·minutes when he was finally relieved by Molloy.

Dayton as David Owen, alias Julian Dulcimer, ingeniously plays a charactet· which is in turn repulsively weak and youthfully cha:t•mi.ng. He ha·ndles the mental tran.siti0ns laudably, particHiarly in the semi-final scene, the play'& climax. Miss Munger as Leonora Yale, a fit·m, clean speciman of blossoming womanho8d has our enUre oym- pathy throughout as she plays het' role with devastating sincerity. It is .&tagc affection for her that m0- tivates our hate for Julian as he becomes Dulcimer's coun tet·part. Douglas Murphy plays Mr. Owen successfully. His \hard livin'\ dia- lect is excellent. As fat· Dave Wilder's \Trump Dulcimer's man, he is pet'fection,-- the compl'ehending., obedient, pas- sive servant personified. Director Edward Canoll's touch was clearly apparent --and an artis- tic touch it was.
