Faraday's theory of lines of force is con- stantly applied in the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company in de- vising new electrical apparatus of which. Faraday never dreamed. Every generator and motor is an elaboration of the simple instruments with which he first discovered and explained induction. Handsome~· and he admits it! And he's ~ wise one, too.

After ·six months ·of expe.ctancy, the Alpha Delta Phi h{}use has bee.n graced with the pres-. ence of Joe Alph, this year's contribu- tion to Union's unique .gr-oup of hou>Se mascots. Rumor has it that envy has turned the shades of the late Psi U g.o.at quite green; but, when interview- ed, Alp.h modestly declared that the re.port was entirely un:substantia.ted. Up to this time, the Alpha Delt freshmen have been busily eng.aged in rushing the visitor, honey and •sugar bein·g the chief inducements. It is e:lel)ected .that Al.ph wilt be induced to become a permanent resident of the house, but doubt as to the physical haza'rds attendant to pledging have ca·used that ce·remony to be indefinite- ly postponed. When interviewed on this. head, Alph would make no· defi-: nite, or at lea:st intelligible, statement, but he promises at some future time to· treat the house to a couple of steak dinners and a fur rug. Alph comes from a country town in New Hampshire, and met the Union men more than half way by receivinng them at Glens Falls. He is not a lega.:cy and still seems to be quite igno-rant d. several important house· rule·s, hut it is thought that he will come through in fine shape later in the spring. \The co-operation ·of the President, Faculty, Alumni and undergraduates has been most encoura-ging. \'Every man an athlete' was my slogan. This was the aim oi every one entrusted with the training of the students at Union. And it is to this training, more than to any other . cause, that the success of my teams is undoubtedly due. Its importance can hardly be over-estimated. Through it, qualities are developed in the indi- vidual which, but for this training, would have remained ·forever latent. Physi-cal fitness, self-reliance, ~onfi­ dence, the cons-ciousness of one's own powers and the faith in the powers ·of one's associates, are developed to such a degree through this training that they find expres.sion in that spirit of invincibleness, whi·ch i:mpels men to be keen to dare because of their consciousness to do. In other words, the students were becoming trained athletes, ready and willing to fit th~m­ selves in, when it was a question of team work, but no less ready on that account to accept leadet·ship when that duty devulved upon them. To put it another way, the students were de- veloping the discipline of appreciation through this training; doing readily and cheerfully what was expected of them, because they had it impressed upon them in a prilctical way how essential team work was to success.

OUR MOST COMM:ON FAULT \Vhat is the most common fault of tl1e modern youth? Lack of concentration, maintains Dr. Lewis Petry, former professor ~n th~ department of English at WilLiams and now principal o£ the fa:mous Phillips Exeter Academy, according to an a.rticle i-11 a recent numb>er of the American nmgazine. Dr. Perry contends that lack of concent::ratio!) is the most u11iver-. sal fault in school beys, college students, and men of today, and he -goes on to point out that this is a serious defect, :Lor he 13ays: &'C0n- centration is esse11tial to any achievement\' from learning <l lesson at scho()l, to handling a case at law, perfouning an opt::ration in sur- .gery, or conducting a busihess ·of any ltiild .\ A little introspection will pro:ve this fad to t4!= m~jority of col- Jege students.

The object is to show how the theory •of the crystaHo-graphrc s>truc- tU>re of the mole~ule expla;ins some of the vaguely understood physkal and chemica:! phenomena. The first lec- ture, delivered on Thursday morning, introduced the subjed by §how.ing how the diffraction of X-raY'S by c~tain crys·tals was used as a means to deter- mine the distance between atoms.

Students in P. The outlook for next season is one of the brightest that Union has ever looked forward to. There \vill be but the loss of two men from the squad, and their positions have been creditably filled by substitutes in sereral of the games. It is interesting to note that dur- ing the closing minutes of play in the Alumni game, the team which represented the Garnet was composed of one freshman and four so- phmores. The enviable record set by the freshmen court team, of only one game 1Dst. points still further to success for futare Garnet fives. \Vith the coming approach of spring and spring weather, let us endeavor to protect and aid the beauty of our campus. As the snow gradually disappears we are moved to take that shorter way across the soft sod. Let us withhold, for if we do not, others may follow ottr course, and seriously injure the lawns of the campus in their future gTowth. A little reflection will show us that a moment's thoughtful- ness on our part will result in days of advantage to the grasses when they begin to grow in the spring. The other day I saw a man deliberately throw a paper beside one of the wa-lks of the campus. Certainly this is not true Union spirit. Such an act breeds carelessness and thoughtfulness and does a great · deal toward destroying student pride in the campus. Let us institute a spring house-cleaning, and as the refuse is cleaned up from along the walks after the disappearance of the snow, . preserve that appearance. Co-operation in this, a:nd thoughtfulness before taking shortcuts, will help materially in the beautifying of our campus. · game of this series will be played S. 2 will receive credit 'fo<r attending the series or for attending individual lectures.

Williams lather is heavier and holds the moisture in against the beard. Quicker and more thorough softening takes place. 2.

Avery, '25 March 21, 1924 HONOR There is the everlasting problem of honor ever facing us, whether \'\·e be in college or in business. Hundreds of things which we are set to do ench dav remincl us of what is honorable and what is not, and oft times we are. wont to pass by, unnoticed ,or without further thought, those which appear to us a bit beyond the bounds of honor. We are often reminded of tl)at old adage that there is even honor among thieves, and by happenings each day we \Vonder that if there isn't as much honor preYalen~ among thieves as among our own associates. If there is honor among men, why must \Ve subject ourselves to an honor sys-tem? \Vhen honor must have a \constitution'' and be straight-jacketed into a \system\, the dishonesty is better tolerated then to contaminate by tale~bearing the>se who cherish their sense of honor and justice. \Vhere gentlemen are concerenecl, an \honor sys- tem\ is an insult and worse than useless. The utoJl'ian ideal of an honor system ·would require a sense of honor thoroughly imbedded in the mind of every man, but the fact remains that no effort has been macle to inoculate students with a sense of honor. There are those who are ever honorable in thei'r work, ancl then there are those who relish in being able to \put one oYer\ for the immediate gain. The h0norable ones think not in terms of a system, but rely on their own good sense for their proper conduct, while to the others the system is just something else with which they match their wits and break, break, break at every turn.· It seems a pity that men. capable of undet-taking a college education, should not be gentlemen enough to conduct themselves in a manner worthy of the highest esteem. \\'hat is needed is a little missionary \.vork. Pressure brought to bear by the honorable :>tudents upon the dishonest ones could ra!ise · the standard of honor in the minds of this latter group to a marked degree and in the due course of time each man, unconsciously, would be upholding the honor and dignity of his name beyond any reproach. The need for such work on the part of each student is imperative and the gu'icker the students grasp the situation and determine to better conditions, the better circumstances we shall have to live in. As one · editorial writer puts it, \Crime like any other disease, is catching, and it is no idle metaphor when we say that the virus of dishonesty is. as contagious as any disease.\ Sigm~ Xi Initiation 1 1 And Banquet Planned.

Spain under the Moors was des·cribed by Mr. Cram as . a virtual fairyland, dotted with pleas- ure palaces and riotous gardens. Of 'all these rich architectural treasures, however, practically the only remain- ing evidence is the famous Alhambra. Many slides were shown of the various characteristics of the amazing palace, a:nd Mr. Cram added that, but for the efforts of Washington I·rving, who spent some years in Spain and became en.amoured of the beauties of the old ruin, the Alhambra would soon have ceased to exist as an architectural mon- ument of the past. After the Moors were finally expelled from Spain, .many cathedrals were started and all were dominated by a Which way for you Union n1en this Spring?

This Span- ish Gothic, as it is called, ·continued to be active in the field 175 years later than in the northern European coun- tries. This late period produced per- haps the best of the Spanish Gothic, for at that time the style had reached ·its highest development and had· re.:. •ceived the revitalizing force of the Flemish influence, ·because of the union · of the two countries under Philip 11. A very important thing from the ar- tistic viewpoint is the fact that the Reformation, as deadly a s•courage in artistic matters a:s Attila was to the . Roman civilization, had no effect at all upon Spain and thus her ·cathedrals, have many o£ them, remained to us in all their original glory. The most delightful thing about Spanish architecture is the happy blending of Gothic with Renaissanc·~ to produce a 'homogeneous whole. Some very fine slides were shown to ilustrate this fact. Even classic was mingled with Gothic with perfect suc- cess, as shown in the CathedraJ of Salamanca in which a classical dome harmonizes suitably with Gothic sur- roundings. Mr. Gram described the Cathedral of Seville as the greatest Christian temple in the world, all'd 'he. ·spent some time irt enlarging oti the wonders of this building 1 with its three aisles on each side of the ·crossing and its multitudinous pillars, 11 feet in diameter.

Donovan '26 March 25, 1924 LIBERALISM College students haYe been commended often on their lihera:lism, but as a matter of fact, do we merit approbation for the e\'incing of toleration? As ready as tnost of us are to form new acquaintances, when we discover a characteristic 1n one of our friends which is re- pugnant to us, we are often prone to censure an.d still more frequent-~ ly to break oif amicable relations on this account. There are some of ns who a~ttempt to correct the \\-ealmess of our friend by reminding 1 biro of his infirmity. Such a course .of action, howe,·er, is merely an- other means of attaining the same ultimate end of losing one's friends. As Henry Fielding once aptly stated, \There is, perhaps. no surer mark of folly, than an attempt to correct the natmal infirm- ities of those we lo\'e.\ Fielding-'s contention was that eYen tl1ough we are conscious of imperfections in our friends, we shnul<i not let knowledge of this nature lessen our d.e\·otion. He argued, \I know of no friend without a fault; and I should be sorry if I coulrl imagine that I had any friend who could not see mine.\ If a man confines himself to a small group of associates with whom he is compatable, he is missing one of the finest advantages of a college education, that of associating with all kinds of people. To. be sure, after leaving college a man will not be permitted to chose his associates. He will not enter a busj.,ness house who chases him be- cause he is of their \crowd''. He-1ril1 meet up against all kinds of men ~1 his ability to get along with all classes will in a large mea- sure determine his success in life. In any business or profession whatsoever, the ability to make friends is an itwaluahle asset. DEBATJ;NG Dehating at Cnion College is not receiving the support that it should receive frot:n the student l1ocly. So far this year the debating teams hCJ.ve not been successful in their contests, but the fault is not to he l;~icl exclusively at the door <>f the team. It was a small number of students that had interest enougl1 in the team to attend the debate \vhich was held in the chapel Frida}' night, although there were prac- tically no other college affairs taking place on the campus at the time. The success of debating tean1s depends largely upon the ability and training of the men that make them up. Very few men reported for the intercotlegiate debate try-outs this year. and practically all of those who were on the teams were upperclassmen. Freshmen and sophomores should be encouraged to come out for debating. 1f they n~ceh·e the necessary training early in their college careers, they will become more and more valuable as dehaters when they become up- perclassmen. Debate;;, especially intercolleg1ate debates, are not always repr- itions of dry facts presented in a formal and uninteresting manner. Often the two teams can be seen in as heated a contest as athletic contests usually are, although the 'veapons are words. The final in- tercollegiate cleha te of the season \.vill be with Buffalo Univer.sity in the college chapel Friday night, and it is to be hoped that the stu~ dent attendance at the contest wilil be larger thQ.n that of last Friday night.

News- . vvriters Training Bureau, Buffalo, Buffalo, N. Y. - and still they say college men don't study! The critic who charges college men with la.ck of diligence never heard a freshman repeat his roll of fraternity chapters without a slip, or a senior dilate on the life history of every football captain from 1890 on. Of course this takes study-sometimes too much study. The student must be cautioned against the mental strain resulting from concentration on too limited a field of thought. It is a good thing to specialize, but not to the extent of becoming narrow. If it is right for the man who concentrates on engineering to be up· on his campus activities, it would seem right for the man who is quoted on the history and phi· losophy of Comparative Baseball Scores to have some knowledge of the chemistry and thermo· dynamics from which he expects to make his living. For it is still true that in industrial councils the talk sometimes swings from batting averages to coefficients of expansion and the hysteresis losses in iron. ~ This is aH a matter of balanc~, and satisfactory mental balance is a means to an important end- satisfactory bank balance.
