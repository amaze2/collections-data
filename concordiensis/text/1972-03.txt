Examines Self- I mage Of B.lacks ;i.: by TIM CAIN The \stars\ in Herbert Dansher's film· \Right On!\ are three young blacks who call themselves \The Last Poets.\ They are not just poets, though; they are performers. Instead of just reading a poem, they perform it, and this performance adds an extra entertaining dimension to their works. The Last Poets are vibrant, imaginative . .actors. They use their poetry to dramatically portray the attitude of black people towards white people, blacks towards blacks, and the attitudes of whites towards blacks. The film, which was shown to an audience of about sixty people in SS016 yesterday afternoon, also made clear the Last Poets' feelings concerning the ideal attitude a black person should have towards himself, his race, and white people, \Right ·On!\ consisted entirely of different poems, presented one after another, and filmed almost entirely on a rooftop in New York City. The message conveyed by the poems was basically the idea that black men should be proud, defiant, and agressive rather than meekly submit to ·a society whose ••oppression makes even God David Dellinger, the old veteran of the new left, will lecture smell foul.\ The poems that were presented at Union College, Tuesday, March 7 at 8 p.m. in Memorial in this film not only pointed an .. Chapel. accusing finger at the society that The 56 year old pacifist, has been an outspoken anti-war has historically been the black crusader for more than three decades and twice during World man's oppressor, but the black War II was jailed for failure to register fot: the draft, despite man himself was also the object of the last Poetf cnt1c1sm and biting satire. Blac.ks .who accept. llnequal treatment and are content with th~ir second class status in society are called \Niggers\ by the Last Poets. The first poem in the movie urged black people lo \get it together,\ and try and do .something t·o improve conditions .. · Later poems exhort black Americans to aggressively and courageously assert themselves. Blacks who are afraid to do anything or lack the initiative are again considered as \Nigger\ and, say the Last Poets. \Niggers are very untogether peopie.\ Black people, _ it is suggested, should not be afraid of killing, violence, or death: · \Hey man, we have died already Somewhere in the r-iver of timelessness, Hey man we is already was We have died a!ready ... \ The impact that l_ife has in· a· deteriorating urban environment on its black inhabitants · was discussed in several poems. One of these poems was sort of an ode to Black Women; it contrasted the green, natural African home of black women with the cold, gray and steel of New York City. Drugs, an ever- present aspect of ghetto life, was the subject of the poem \Cocaine Lady.\ Then a strange poem about New York nightlife was presented along with film clips of dancing couples in Harlem bars. Traditional symbols of black success such~ ns the Supn:mes, Louis Armstrong .. , and Jftnws Brown are alliu ·the obje.cL of the Last Poets' satiric imitations.

Heard a police officer tell a police sergeant: 'Lots of niggers dying in Viet-Nam.' Niggers have been dying for 400 years, Dying in Ivy League suits, dying in offices ... Niggers watch niggers die. The effect of the poetry and the musical rhythmic background is striking. The Last Poets present their material in such a forceful, imaginative manner so that words that would ordinarily constitute a high-pitched harangue, become an interesting and compelling examination of the frustration and anger that is so much a part of the hlack experience in America today. qualifying for a ministerial exemption from the armed services.

Of Administrators A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale and former student at Oxford and then the Union Theological Seminary, Dellinger is the author of \Revolutionary Nonviolence,\ published by Thursday afternoon's College Stnate meeting revolved around two major issues, those of the Student Senate report on administrative evaluation and the report recently released by the Doubleday. Views Interfraternity Coun:cil WinteF -Weekend As Success JIM SMITH Last weekend, the Union College Interfraternity Council sponsored the annual Winter Weekend. The festivities lifted everyone's spirits, as the ten participating houses generated a good deal more excitement than is usually obesrved on a typical Union weekend. The highlight of the entire affair was the formal ball held on Saturday night at the Girling Center clubhouse. The evening was a complete success for • the 400 people who attehded. Among those at the ball were Professor Martin and his wife, who seemed to enjoy the music and the band even more than most. They treated those with a more limited experience to a free dancing demonstration. In preparation for the evening's festivities, the IFC held a Winter carnival on Saturday afternoon. The various fraternities competed in the five events, spurred on by the prize of a trophy and a keg of beer to be awarded to the winning house. Delta Upsilon came out on top, winning three of the five events for 28 points. Their homemade sled won two events for DU, the sled race and the sled judging contest. DU also· won the wrecking contest, by smashing .~our dining room chairs and a bureau faster than any other house. Sigma Phi finished a close second, with 26 points, taking second in the snow sculpture contest, and in the cross-country ski relay. They also took the prize for having erected the largest snowball. The ski relay was won by a Phi Delta Theta foursome, including two pledges, Jim Smith and S~amas Johnson. Interfraternity Council social chairm~;n, Rich Jaszczak, stated his hopes that the Winter Weekend, in addition to providing a wonderful time for all those involved, would do something to bring together the various houses and to promote unity. A substantial sum of money was found Thursday, March 2, at 12:30 PM, in a parking lot on campus. If you lost it, and can identify the amount and denomination of the bills, and location where lost, caU I Scottie. at 346-9935 to claim it. · College's Long-Range Planning Committee. Regarding the discontinued administrative evaluatory procedures, most of the Senate members speaking, who appeared to reflect general sentiment among the faculty, felt that the questionnaires intended for evaluation were unfair. In this view, few people are knowledgeable enough to properly evaluate administrators, and the procedures were unclear as to exactly who would be evaluated and how this would be done. There were two. beneficial aspects of this evaluatory system mentioned during the meeting. In the process of filling these forms out, some administrators may undergo a useful self-evaluation. Furthermore, administrators distribute memorandums which inform the College community of their functions. However, it was thought that the negative aspects of the procedure far outweighed these positive results. One professor remarked that it is difficult to combine all the diverse qualities constituting a effective administrator into one rating. Concerning the Long-Range Planning Committee, its major goals, as relayed in a statement by President Martin, are the following: l) maintenance of the present distrihution among . . programs In eng1neenng, sciences, social sciences, and humanities, to the greatest extent possible; 2) providing a campus climate which encourages intellectual activity; 3) development of more transdisciplinary programs, and consequent topical courses; 4) development of alternatives to the traditional four-year undergraduate collegiate program; 5) offering of certain graduate programs that will serve to complement undergraduate studies; 6) an attempt to increase the socio-economic diversity of the student body, involving the addition of more minority-group students. The Senate considered the report, but no definitive action was taken on it. There was a suggestion that the Planning Committee could also ponder the question of tenure in discussing the College's future. Thursday's agenda also included a proposal for an addition of students to the President's Ad Hoc Committee on 'tenure, which is currently deliberating on the issue. After a discussion period, the Senate advrsed the President to instruct the committee to call upon students for their views;

Ed. 32 Art and Creativity which is being given in the spring term. Since they have variously identified it as, \the course in Mysticism, Meditation, Cons..:iousne.ss, Occultism, etc.\ I'd like to dear up some misconcept-ions. The overall intent is to make a systemati~ study ot creativity with emphasis on art and the practi~al applications ot creutive intelligence ·to the ongoing process ot lite. The course will he divided into tour parts. In the tin;t part the ll nion Arts faculty will present situations which will call for the creative participation of all the students. Drawing, weaving. musi<;, and drama wi!l he included. In conjunction with this direct experience in the creative process we will examine the process as it is described by eminent artists, scientists and thinkers. The second section of the course will deal with impediments to creattvtty impediments which are found in one's environment, especially in education, But emphasis of_ this· section 'will be on subjective blocks to the growth of one's full· creative potential. We will ra.Ik about physiology and its relationship to consciousness in terms of various psychological theories at this point. Means f0r increasing creativity will be di~ct;.;sed in the third section. Since virtually .!II the good Work in this field comes from the East -· China. India_ and Japan - we will examine philosophies and techniques which promise unlimited development of individ ua I creativity, Taoism. Zen. Yoga and Transcendental Meditation . will be investigated. As a complement to this conceptual framework, the direct experience of Transcendental Meditation will be offered. Great works of art which provide examples of the perfection of creative expression will be the subject of the last part of the course. About two-thirds of the course will consist of guest speakers, videotapes, films and recordings. Videotapes from the International Symposium on the Science of Creative Intelligence conducted by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi will be shown. These will consist of discussions by specialists in the fields of political science, architecture, poetry, quantum mechanics and physiology. Mahari.shi's convocation address and his comments on the other preseritatrons will be included. The ·readings in the course <Jre designed to offer alternative points of-view to'those·presented · in class. Although enroUment will be limited, this course was designed with liuge numbers of students in mind. · I hope this outline of Comp. Ed. 32 will answer your questions. Sincerely, Peter Erskine Department of the Arts * * * * To the Editor: As many students know, this term David Snider is teaching a Comp. Ed. course using four students as helpers. These five people make up the teaching team. at! having an equal say in all the decisions made concerning . the course. Recently I have been made aware that certain. members of the faculty and staff of the college are having some condescending chuckles at the expense of this particular endeavor. I. resent this, being one of the members of the team. In response I offer this comment as food for thought. We dared to do something different than is ordinarily done on this campus because we saw a chance to offer some sort 0f realistic learning experience to the students. We tried to make. our classroom sessions more meaningful by playing, psychological games designed to dramatize the concepts we were discussing as they occurred in real life situations, we invited various speakers who were involved in the kinds of activities we were discussing, we used films and smaU group discussions to draw out what the members of the class were really feeling and thinking about what was taking place in class, we allowed for team projects designed to investigate m real life the situations and concepts we studied and discussed, we encouraged action oriented projects that would begin to combat what we saw to be wrong with the \Great Society.\ '1\low while we may not have been I 00% successful in our attempts, nonetheless, every week we had visitors come and partake of our classroom activities (some got to be and are still regular auditors of the class) and every week ther.e are from 5 to 15 students who remain (anywhere from. half an hour to ali hour) in the classroom and continue the discussions .past the en.tJ. :of the session of the scheduled class. In addition to all this, we have a lot of good times in the process and actually enjoy the learning experience. While we may not be any closer to loving one another as \brothers\ we most certainly have come to realize the gut feelings of the resp.ective members of the class and an · understanding is developing as a result of the honesty that is actively encouraged. Ours is a cl'ass where you are not safe in playing it safe because someone who is just a little more honest will challenge your hesitancy. No one escapes, not even the teaching team members, · and because of this attempt at equality among participants, everyone learns. Our subject is institutional and individual racism and our experience has shown us how we all, both black and white, are victims of the policies that grow out of a racist value system. We do not present rose colored half-truths in the guise of reality, nor d0 we limit the alternatives of those concerned witb change to the narrow choices offered in some of the courses I've taken, if these courses· offered any alternatives at all. All things ·considered I am still wondering wpat the he,H all the chuckling is about. William Adams DICTIONARIES WEBSTER L1brory size, 1971 edttion, bran. new, still on box.

Page4 CONCORDIENSIS, March 3, 1972 Concordy Sports Howie Tests Perfect Mark Three Others ·ro Oswego by MARK MINDEL While most of the I 972 grapplers are back in thei-r dorms studying for finals. Al Calabx:o, Mark Zullo, J.;~rry Dagastino, and \Heav-y\ Howie Benedict will be shacked up four deep in a single motel room somewhere in or around Oswego. The four will be representing Union College this weekend in the NCAA's national wrestling tournament. in the western New York City. Benedict, who went t0 the tournament last year at' 190 bulked up to 220 pounds for football and decided t0 stay · at that weight for wrestling .. Of the four he has the best chance of making it through the early brackets of the tourney into the tougher final rounds. Howie brings an 18-0 record to Oswego while Zullo, the captain of the squad this year, is 14-3 in his I 26 pound class. Calabro, who wrestled most of the year at 134, two waight calsses above his normal I 18, will bring a 9-4 record to the classy affair. Alan will be wrestling at the lower weight for the meet. Dagastino, a frosh from Schenectady's Mont Pleasant High, is going in place of fiery . Pat Wardell who is unable to make the trip. Oagastino is 9~6 at 142, while Wardell compiled a 12- 7 record at 190. Howie, Mark, and Alan, all sophomores, should be accustomed to . Union's low budget travel, but Larry may be surprised. He just might find himself sleeping the nights away on the floor next to light- (bed)- mates Zullo and Calabro, while hefty Howie enjoys the luxury of a double bed, custom fit for his large frame.

r Founded at Union College 1877 Vol. lOt, No. 36 SCHENECTADY, NEW YORK March. s, 1972 Price Twenty Cents Committee Established To Recruit Provost Ski Patrol .Has ~ . . by PETER DICKERMAN Although not yet known by most students, an administrative change of great importance is abeut to occur, that being the establishment of the office of provost. According to plans devised by President Harold Martin, the position of provost is to be one of far-ranging. almost total responsibility for day-to- day administration of the College. This information was disclosed in an interview with Professor Willard Enteman, who is Chairman of the Provost. Search Committee, a body appointed by President Martin approximately three weeks ago. Other committee membe.rs are C ·o· .. z··z.eg·e· c· ha·•·· .· .··•· r.nte.r· .. ~:~~es~l~~n~h=~~br~~~. ~~;~~: r Dean Lichterman, Comptroller Dale Timberlake, students Susan Bergan and · Bob K urtter. Professor Enteman explained that the committee, which first met Fe.bruary 18, has aJn~ady sent letters to numerous college presidents and administrators reQuesti.ng informati<m and recommendations for the job of provost. The comm'ittee expects to compile a list of (in Enteman's terms) \a couple dozen,\ who will then be interviewed personally by several committee members. After the list is further narrowed, six or eight candidates for the position will be brought to the campus to interact with various members of the Colle~e by BARBARA ROTTlER Happiness and relief now exist at Union College for aU avid and altruistic skiers! There is a Union College Sid Patrol Club which is registered with the National Ski Patrol Systems. The purpos~ of the National P.atrol is to r.escue and administer first aid to injured skiers. This service was originally· set up in 1938 because death due to shock and the delay' in unorganized rescue was a frequent result ·of skiing accidents. This necessity still exists today, especially since more and more people are becoming skiers. Not widely known is the fact that a patrolman does not have to be a flashy skier, l>ut a controlled skier. He must be . expert in stopping, turning, and controlling his speed on any hill, alone and with .a toboggan, for this is what guatantees the safety ·of ·an injur.ed skier. The patrolman must be able to determine the smoothest path down the hill so the passenger will not be jostled. The first aid requirements are simple: Red Cross standard and advanced first aid, Red Cross Refresher course for Ski Patrol, ~d a review Continued on Page 3 community. Finally, the committee will present a list of three or four people in order of prefen:nce, and President Martin will theoretically choose the provost from this list, hopefully by no later than July. The title of provost is not new at Union; most recently Theodore Lockwood served· in that post until 1968. However, the envisioned scope of the new provost's job will make· it much more significant than the past title. Professor Enteman stated that the position of provost will be analogous to that of a corporate executive vice- president. He added that its establishment may be evidence of the creation of a sort of \internal- external presidency,\ with the College's president mainly concerned with fund-raising and other external affairs while the provost handles matters of internal administration. Every administrative branch of the College, with the exception of the Office of External Affairs, will report directly or indirectly to the provost. President Martin's decision to create such a post is related to the belief that he must now spend a latge percentage of his time, perhaps as much as 50 percent, engaged in off-campus activities for the College. .·In speaking of the kind of person desired for the job, Enteman asserted at the outset that he or she should be a scientist or engineer; this is a result of the President's \strong preference\ in favor of a more academically balanced administrative staff. The provost will have \tremendous responsibilities,\ particularly in matters of management and finance, where there are urgent Continued on Page 3 Speaker Reviews Advertising· A·buses by TIM CAIN \Human Engineering~ was the subject of the talk given by Charles Henderson at the Chi Psi Lodge Monday night. Henderson is assistant dean of the chapel at The Union College Patrol serves the students in several ways. Vitally, our own patrol provides a convenient organization to work with; for every patrolman must register with a national patrol. tb.e organization facilitates the travel necessary for training and helps reduce the expense involved. Equally important, · the patrol creates the companion8hip that is often present among people with similar goals. Free skpng, service to a particular ski area,. and pride in one's ability are personal gratifications. President Meets Junior~Faculty To Discuss Tenure Problems Princetown University and has written a book entitled \The Nixon Theology.\ In his presentation and talk, he made use of a film which consisted of fourteen different television commercials. These commercials, Henderson asserted, not only sell . a product, but they also sell and promote a way of life. The advertising industry, centered largely in New York City, uses its commercials to perpetuate and accentuate certain values, he said. The fourteen advertisements shown in the film were chosen because they were representative of the industrys' efforts to shape or manipulate values in American society. For example, Henderson pointed out l•lat several years ago hair colorings and dyes were looked upon as \immoral perhaps, or unnatural. Advertisers were aware that hair coloring suffered from a poor reputation so their goal was to improve the image of these products and to make them seem \natural\ and \innocent.\ Hence, we have commercials tliat extol the virtues of the ~·natural\ blondes of Scandinavia, and a \Toni\ commercial in which fourteen cute, sleeping children are featured in order to promote the \Innocent Color\ hair product. In a meeting with untenured faculty Monday afterno.on President }:Iarold Martin reafflrmed his belief that there exists an \inverse relationship\ between the College's academic quality and its percentage of tenured faculty. The President further: stated that he \would Russian Professor Hired- Communist Stqdies To Stay by PHYLLIS EDELMAN The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures has announced the hiring of a new Russian professor, Mrs. Nadya Jernakoff, to replace Assistant Professor Bruce Weston who is leaving. Mrs. Jernakoff, an adjunct professor with the State. University of New York at Albany, will be teaching beginning Russian 10, 11 and 12, as wel! as supervtsmg an independent study .program. Of Russian parentage, Mrs. Jernakoff received her elementary and secondary schooling in Belgium where she grew up. She was granted her llachelor of Arts and Masters degree .. in Russian from SUNY A where she has been employed since Fall, 1970. At SUNY A, Mrs. Jemakoff has taught various level courses in Russian on a part.-til:.ne basis, and as of this past year, full-time. According. to Dean Lichterman, the original plan was to work through the consortium to provide Russian language studies to Union College students. This included a plan where students would go to R.P.I. for those Russian courses above the 12 level. An exchange, however, has been worked out with Associate Dean Ruth Schmidt of SUNY A where Union, wiil accept their advartced students in . Chinese for our Continued on Page 3 welcome an alternative\ to the present tenure system. Dr. Martin, who called the meeting, began by presenting now. ... familiar divergences of opinion on the issue. He repeated the Trustee view of the need for flexibility, so-called \new blood,\ and cost reductions theories, and contrasted these with faculty arguments concerning morale, the diversion of time caused by research required by the College, and the high cost of recruitment of new facl:llty. The President then presented the final dichotomy or choice between the 60 tenure limit and a policy of greater self-regulation, greater specificity in the evaluation of faculty for tenure, and the supporting argument that the potential imbalance of tenured personnel would be corrected in the \long haul.\ Citing statistics which illustrated the cost of continually increasing tenure levels, Dr. Martin reminded his audience that the \budget is already in deficit,\ and \I don't believe that one can afford to talk in terms of the long haul.\ He stated that since effective self-regulation is unlikely, \some kind of regulatory pattern is probably necessary.\ Martin continued by asserting that flexibility is also a crucial problem in view of the anticipated addition of larger nutnbers of transdisciplinary courses to the curriculum. He added that \The new blood argument is important t.o me,\ and that while the present limitation is perhaps \not very sophisticated,\ it does serve the regulatOFy function. Professor Walbeck countered by asse-rting that the 60% limit has created \impossible barriers\ to faculty happiness, and Professor Ludwig stated that finding faculty of equal quality to those being lost will be a difficult task. Professor Roulier cited a case ··involving the Mathematics Department, in which a highly qualified job applicant declined a position here after learning of the tenure limitation. President Martin, while noting that there has been a similar occurrence in the Chemistry Department, responded with the following: .. Well, I'm glad he didn't come.\ Dr. Martin stated that the issue of faculty morale \concerns me deeply,\ and expressed his regret at the fact that under present conditions some faculty cannot even be considered for tenure. He reiterated his view that \scholarship should be taken as an important part of one's probationary (non-tenured) years,\ and commented that he Continued on Page 3 ln the hands of the advertisers. Henderson continued, \A very specific, sterotyped version of sexuality begins to emerge. Man is portrayed as dearly the ruler of the sexes.\ He pointed out that women are put down a~ clowns or fools in commercials such as the Imperial Margarine television advertisement. in which two chattering housewives hysterically debate the qualities of that particular brand of margarine.

While being fully aware of the financial bind facing all curricular matters, President Martin and the members of the Curricular Affairs Committee are nonetheless urged to consider the following points m the · argument for continuation of the program. . . . As of last week, figures available fom the registrar indicated that the projected enrollment in Hebrew 10, 11 and 12 for this year (including preregistration for next term) was greater than that for either of the comparable language programs ig think, believe, perceive, say, or imagine about them.\ Mr. Withheld goes. on .saying: that \ ... what concerns llS, •the blacks' is not the llncenscious deepseated prejudice of . individuals but the paternalistic irrational and letters to the Editor Russian or Chinese. · · In addition, the Hebrew language program is an important faceL of the Judaic studies program as well as of. the term abroad in Israel program which sent 25 students to Israel this winter. A further .advantage of the term abroad program is that it is more financiaUy profitable for the school than any: of . the other term abroad programs. Prelirpinary returns from the students now in Israel, as well as feedback from the other Judaic studies courses, indicate that the Hebrew language courses comprise a valuable portion of the entire program. The President and the members of the Curricular Affairs Committee are asked to make every possible attempt to see that the continuation of the Hebrew language cou~es, the demand for which is admittedly significant, is realized.

Wha.t all this rnt:ans is that i large number of people on this campus are fooling themselves by believing that they can be well- informed and involved even while being isolated and disinterested. ' It is not my intent to apologize for where Concordy hasn't gone, nor can I evaluate its efficacy in absolute terms. i do conclude, however,. that the responsibility for the establishment of a meaningful campus publication lies both within and without the masthead. Just as the press must be responsible to its readers,. the read-er~ must realize .that they are responsible for being honest with themselves before they can be sincere . in using the .press to. communicate with others.
