The m.an who works his way through college simply doesn't figure. Taking care of a fm·nace, running ttlaundry, waiting on table. tutoring, covering for a city paper, worldng in shop er office in vacation- all this may be lacking in romantic appeal, but it is an essential part of the college picture. And a valuable part. The whole college is the gainer for the earnestness of men who want their education that hard. Valuable to the college, but even more to the men who travel this rough going. They learn an irn portant lesson in Applied Economics-. the amount of sweat a ten dollar bill represents.

If you want to take the same treatment I did write to MALCOLM D. SPRINGER, Troy, N. Y. I I i ~~~-·HE al chemists wrote vaguely of 'cfluids'' and \princi pies.\ Copper was potentially silver. Rid it of its red color and the cc principle\ of silver would assert itself, so that silver would: remain. With a certain amount of philos- opher's stone (itself a mysterious c'principle\) a base metal could be converted into a quantity ofgold a million times as great. This all sounded so \practical' that Kings listened credulously, but the only tangible result was that they were enriched with much bogus gold. Scientific theorists like Robert Boyle (1627-1691) proved more \practical\ by testing matter,dis- covering its composition and then drawing scientific conclusions that could thereafter be usefully and honestly applied. Alchemists con- jecturedanddied;hoexperimented and lived. Using the air pump Boyle un .. dertook a \theoretical\ but sci- General ~ener4l Offjce Com entific experimental study of the atmosphere and discovered that it had a c'spring\ in it, or in other words that it could expand. He also established the ·connection between the ooiling potn t of water and atmospheric pressure, a very •'theoretical, discovery in his day but one which every steam engi .. neer now applies. He was the first to use the term •'analysis\ in the modern chem- ical sense, the first to de:fine an element as a body which cannot be subdivided and from which compounds can be reconstituted. Boyle's work has not ended. Today in the Research Labora- tories of the General Electric Company it is being continued. Much light has there been. shed. on the chemical reactions that occur in a vessel in which a nearly perfect vacuum has been produced. One practical result of this work is the vacuum tube which plays an essential part in radio work and reentgenology.

I do not study for a Phi Beta Kappa key and keep happily out of all competitions. I don't think I'll make \Scarab\. I am a Pure Non en tit~. In fact all I do in this place is a great deal of reading and what the sons of Amherst call \moping\. As for the charges in your editorial last week, I don't read the \Saturday Evening Post\ \Lord Jeff\ and \trashy novels\ and God forbid that I ever read the \Amherst Writing\ again. I don't know how to play bridge and don't go to movies more than three times a week. and wouldn't if I had the money. I discuss women as much as such a minor topic warrants. Nevertheless your editorial showed an ''indepen- dent intelligence\. And I know I've convinced you that I'm self- conceited as well as self-deceiving. My greatest debt to Amherst lies in her showing me how ridic- u~ous are the. popular beliefs reg~ding the benefit of extra-cur- riculum activities and the .beautiful comradeships and associations one makes at college. I have heard at least ten Alumni warn \the more you put into Life the more you will get out of it\. At least ten have said to me, \Industry and Thrift sp~ll Sqccess\. At least a lllindted that college gives us an ~ppreciation of the \bigger b~tter, finer things of Life\. And then some ass with a Phi Beta Kappa key and half a dozen major letters, who is selling horseblankets says, \You men will some day go out as leaders of :fnen.

Dr. Lake was horn in England and educated at Lincoln college, Oxford, from which he was graduated in 1895 with the degree of B. A. After serving as a cu tate ill England, he •vent to the University of Leyden, Holland, and in H14 came to this country t0 occ-upy the \V~nn pro- fessorship of ecclesiastical _history at Harvard university. This annual series of le·ctnres constitutes practically the only means Union col lege has of directly making itself a cultural center for the comm ttn,ity. \Vitho'Ltt exception the lecturers chosen to present this series in years rmst have heen big men in the world of letters and constmcth·e thinking, and the general public has wel- cumecl this proffered' opportunity by liberal attendance. Union col- lege is glad ior her chance to render servi·ce to the community and \velcomes the puhlic to these lectures on \The Immortality of Man\_ But it rl<·1es seetn rather paradoxical that we, who set ourseives U'Jl as being weH-inf<i>rtnecl and belonging to t'he educated few, should take such a neg-atiYe interest in this self-same series of lectures. Student attendance upon the lchabocl Spencer lectures in the past years has he en nil. not more than three or four college men attend- ing upon any of the lectures delivered last year by Dr. C. M. Bake well, vYho spHke on \The Fundamentals of American Democracy\. It is no small J);trt of the purpose of the college to instill in its attending stwl en t~ an appreciati•on and desire for intellectual pur- suits. In its .prescrihecl courses the college can do little more than point out the I\\ a}-: in actLtality the student gets but a small acquaint- anceship \\-ith the raage of the cultural while in college. The college fails except it inspire its students to further learning than that which is reqnirccl in the syHabtts. The Ichahod Spencer lectures are all of tlwm opportuni-ties for further learning of a very worth-while sort. The geneml sul1j ects of the lectures is observedly of a religions nature. But one tnay be sure that Dr. Lake will not expound and expatiate the traditional doctrines of the Church. Every attempt \Vill be made to a>-oid anything in the nature of dogmatical state- ments. It has 1)een noted that college students will at all times enter into a d.iscnssion of religion and its personal application, providing the talk is not maintaitled on a technical basis in a dogmatical man- ner. Religion is of our nahtre a matter ·of universal interest. The lectures of Dr. Lake should appeal to that interest and should be a ttende<l hy a lnrger j)ercentage of the student body of the college; The first lecture en Monda:y night will deal with \The Morality of a Nomad and His God\ and wil'l be held in the chapel beginning at • eight o'clock.

Among other new equipment which has recently been ac- quired are 15 pairs of regular soccer · shoes. It is hoped that the S•pring s·chedule will include the Burns club of Troy, Clan MacCrea of Schenectady, and the G. E. club. The squad wilf be coached under the direction of two very aDle men, Mr. Taggert ·of Troy and Mr. Cook of the General Electric ·company. About 30 men are now out for soc\ cer, and although ·there is some very good material to be found in the pres- ent squad, it is expected that new re- cruits will make the Garnet soccer team an organization worthy -of being classed as a minor sport next year.

This method of iriclucth·e reasoning was the method of Gallileo m1cl of ::\:ewton, the method of all the greatest and most creative o.f scien- tists. The steady sure application of fonnulas and the tnethocl of working from one established fact to ar.1other. these are essential to the stahilitv of the world. But such methods would not have Ie<' • I Newton artcl Galli! eo to their successes. Of course, it will be oh· i jected and ~:anted that New.ton and Gallileo had spec~al ta!~nts an~ i. unusual ah!ltty, ancl yet wlule we may not have thetr abnhty, cet-1 . tainly we can apply their methods with equal success to the best o~ j our little abilities. 1 There is a distinct parallel between this inductive method of l science and the method of t;~e. philosoph~r.

Such is the oln·ious observation that the new student of philosophy notes from the heg-inning-. Questions such as \vVhat is the Truth?\ \\\'hat is Good and it~ relation tq Evil?'', and \\\~hat is the Past ~\.-all of them seem \'() the uninitiated as futile and quite unfamiliar from a \practical\ point of view. :\Ios t people would predict the hread line or the insane asylum for any man who would spend his time ponder- ing such questions. Probably it is because philosophy deals with questions to which om daily life does not necessitate any answer or which seem inatJ.e in view of the practical demands of mundane existence. that the man of philosophical bent is looked upon as an impotent dreamer. The most fundamental questions belong to tht realm of philosophy; it concerns itself with those questions which practical existence ha.s from the beginning of life resolved for us iP dog-matic fashion.

For the man in the street this satisfaction of the curiosity will not I he sufficient warrant for such an expenditure ·of time. He will ob- ject to the very abstractness about it all. \You are not of the earth earthy\ he \Vi.Il complain. The study of philosophy will be de- nounced as \sterile intellectuarism\ which butters no bread, and -even fails to provide so much as plain bread. No argument will conYince this skeptic except the one which can definitely show some material advantage to h~ so derived. Just such an argument dotts Josiah Royce present, and it constitutes an effective refuta~ tion to th.e statement that the stltcly of philosophy has no practical value.

The subject of the lecture is French cathedraLs, and it will be illustrated bv slides sent out from Paris by the Al;- tomobile Club of France. These have been secured through the efforts o M.

The sweet, dan'lp odor of the rain-cooled earth;' A drooping rose; a half-awaked bee Sipping the nectar slowly, daintily, To get, from every blossom, its full worth . A drenched,. forlorn, bedraggled butterfly Comes fluttering, the sunlight's \Vannt:h to share. The brooklet, winding on without a care, The garden soothes with its soft lullaby. But now the summer's Io·vefiness is spent: Her roses to the winter gales are flung- And over aU .the garden, snow lies cleep. Obedient to the wind the trees are bent, 1'heir branches all with icy festoons hung- Awaitin~· Spring, the garden lies asleep. Mary E. Roberts. THE BARBER The Shop Patronized By Union Mea Cor.
