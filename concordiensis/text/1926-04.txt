Six hours under a tropical sun, a bowl of cold rice --and six hours more. Then the woman goes to her bed of rushes, and the beast to his mud stall. Tomorrow will be the same. The American home has many conveniences. But many American women often work as hard as their Oriental sisters. They toil at the washtub, they carry water, they churn by hand-all tasks which electricity can do for them at small cost, in half the time. The labor-saving possibilities of electricity are constantly becoming more widely recognized. And the social significance of the release of the American woman from physical drudgery, through the increas- ing use of electricity in and about the home, will appeal instantly to every college man and woman. 7•71DH GENERAL ELECTRIC GBN13RAI.

Fighting Submar~es with Elevators When the American people answered .. War·· in 1917, no matter was of more importance than the readjustment of the great industries to the conditions of war, and no contribution to national defense was more exacting than that of the Otis Elevator Company. It was a long way from the ordinary operations ofbusinesshuildings through- out the country to the North Sea in war time, yet strangely enough Otis auto- matic leveling or micro·drive elevators proved one of the most valuable innova- tions in connection with naval warfare. Up to the time the American Navy became a factor in the World War, it had been impossible to lay, in the North Sea, the contemplated mine barrage, which it was hoped could be used to pre- vent submarines from skirting the north end of the British Isles. This had been impossible, because the time required to get the mines overboard prevented successful fesults. The Otis Elevator Company cooperated with the American Navy and pro;ided automatic leveling elevators for the delivery of the mines from the hold of the mine layers to the main deck, where they could be put overboard at such frequent intervals as to make the laying of the barrage a success. In an Mtide published several years ago, Captain Belknap, U.S.N., who was in command of the mine laying squad- ron at the time, stated that in the nine. monthS'\or more of operation, in which sixty tllousand mines were handled in and out, as well as many more in the course of drills, there was only one occasion in which any one of the thirty- two elevators was shut down. This was the fault of the operator, not the elevator, in that it was run too far up and jammed there for a few hours, but without causing any delay in the mine laying operation . In war as in peace, the Otis Elevator has become one of the indispensable parts of our civilization. O~is Micro-Drive Elevators, as developed for the mine laying ships and for the great Army and Nav.y Bases at New York and Boston, are now in constant use throughout all parts ofthe country in office buildings, hotels, department states, warehouses, terminals and factories. The automatic leveling feature eliminates \inching\ at the floors, obviates the stumbling hazard in passenger elevators, as well as saving time in operation, and increasing the life of the apparatus. On freight elevators it also provides an exact! y levellanding.to facilitate the handling of freight. 0 T I s E L E VAT 0 R c 0 M P A NY O.flice5 in all Principal Cities of the World •

In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, scholars and diploma;ts from all parts of the civi~ lized world could carry on their con- versatioa -in Latin. Until recently, French performed the same service to the pol'ite world. It is now pro- phesied that English will be the international language of the future. But meanwhile there is a good deal of confusio11, and ambassadors from distant countries must frequent- ly rely on interpreters. Therefore, it is fortunate fo.r the pungry trav- eler that the me.nus of restaurants everywhere still employ French. And it is fortunate, too, that if he wish to ascend to a higher floor of a building in any of the great cities ofthe world, the single word OTIS will bring him directions for reach- ing the elevator. The Palazzo del Campidoglio, Rome; is built on oo.e of the seven hills of Rome and at present houses the Municipality of the City of Rome. The original building on this site was a temple of Jupiter in the Roman era, the construction being started byTarquin the Elder and completed byTarquin th.eProud. During the Empire ofVitellius and Vespasiano it was burned three times and was reconstructed by Domitien. In the Middle Ages it served as a temple to consecrate the Poets ofthe time; The present building was erected by Michel Angeio on the ruins of the ancient building, and it contains an Otis Elevator. 0 T .I S ELEVATOR COMPANY Offices in all Principal Cities of the World l f l l
