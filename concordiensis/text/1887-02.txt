Ice crowned, and riding on the blast That round thee w1~eathes the shifting snow, We saw thee as thy car swept past; ~hy coursers spurned the earth below, The torn clouds from their hoofs were cast. Thy throne is 'neath the Polar star. There thy auroral banners wave Whose flaunting folds we see affar: ThY realm the ice-locked oce.ms lave; Famine and cold invasion bar. Where g·leaming glaciers slowly run, Thy citadels have frowned aloft, Since first the ag·es' march begun ; The snowy battlements shed off The g·olden arrowa of the sun. __ When from thy realm's eternal snows Tb.e arctic sun his face inclines, Thou followest southward, as he g·oes, To lands on which his lig·ht ere shines And with thee bring'st thy train of woes. At thy approach the forests groan, Aud sttip to wrestle with thy galet, Their brig·ht robes on the earth are strown, · A storm-tossed navy reefs its sails; The ocea.ns lash their shores and moan. '£he brook g-rows rigid 1n its fligbt, Tra.nsfj.xed by thy congealing breath, The stars gleam angrily at night, Or clouds the ushen hue of death Spread o'er the earth a shrowd of white. A reig-n of de;tth., where noLa trace Or Springtime's winsome smile is seen, Nor Summer's mild, maturer grace, Nor Autumn's pomp and mellow sheen That g-laddened nature's ruddy face. Yet tyrant, ruthless as thou art, We fear thee not, thy reign is short, Already Sprimr's awakening· heart Dreams of bet· flowers and wanton sport; The lengthening· suns her pulses start. And soon the south wind's murmur low Shall speak of freedom to the brool\:S And thou, with lingering step and slow And frequent halts and backward looks. Retreating to thy realm shalt go. My First Interview. I HAD h.ad some experience in newspaper · work as cor-respondent for different papers and as editor and contributor to college journals be:::;ides doing some minor reporting for small dailies in the northern part o£ this state, but the work on a Metropolitan daily I found was almost like beginning all over again. Every day brought entirely new experiences. The second day o£ my connec- tion witl1 the Gazette, I reached the office about 8:30 A. M., and reported for work. One by one the staff was assigned work £or the , day and as the forenoon faded away I began to think that my space in that day, s issue would be very small indeed when the lusty voice of the City Fiditor was heard calling \Shec.\ On 1ny arrival at the desk, he said: \J'im Blaine arrived in town last night and j is a.t the Fifth Avenue Hotel, you ma.y go 1 up and find out \rhat he is going to do while J in New York. Get back here by one o~clock.'' j It was 11:30 A. M. then, and I thought old J ! Moslo:f must be crazy. I kept my thoughts to myself while ~n the office, however, and like a good :fellow started off on my mission. By means o£ the Elevated Road I was soon in :front of the Fifth Avenue HoteL I quickly seized the handle to the door when it sud- ! denly flashed through my head that I hadn't i the least idea or what I was to say or do.

With the green boughs twined in a roof above, In a hammock gently swayed, While the sunbeams strive to pierce the gloom, And the. air is filled with a sweet perfume, She lies in the chestnut's shade. IIer eyelids resting their dusky fringe On a cheek with crimson flushed, Her white dress sweeping the turf below As she swingeth idly to and fro, vVith aspect still and hushed. She dreams-and her lips have formed a smile. Who knows what pleasant things, What blissful visions of joys to be, What wonderful thoughts of land or Rea, She is dreaming as she swings ? Perhaps she drearns of the pale wild rm;;f' Which fades away in her belt. PerhapR she dreamR of the giver, too, And how by his side the bright hourH flew, And what she s.aid and felt. Who knows ? Not I ! But across the grasH Comes somebody wiser than I. He comes to the patch of cool, dee11 sh::tde, By the still green boughs of the chestnut made, And stops with a start, half shy. ' A.nd he guesses for whom the smile is Ineant-- Ah, guesser, she dreams of you ! See, the lashes lift from the crimson cheeks-- She stirs-she wakes-· and now she Rpenks, For she knows that her dream is true~ -Edith Eoelyn..
