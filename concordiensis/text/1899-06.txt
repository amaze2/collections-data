U. held at the Schenectady driving park on the afternoon of Decoration day, Hamilton for the second time proved herself superior to Union in ,: track athletics. The contest was not, however, a one-sided one, for up to the close the issue was in doubt. The rneet, though different in natne, was in fact a dual one, for neither Hobart or Colgate sent 1·epresentatives. Hamilton brought down with her a good sized delegation of rooters who kept up the cheering throughout the after- noon. The fatniliar \Hikah\ resounded on all occasions, the losing man receiving quite as much encouragement as the more fortunate . Winner. Captain Price was the bright particular star of the day. The hundred, two-twenty, and four- forty yard dashes are all credited to his speed and endurance. Weed who broke the college record in the pole vault and captured first place in the high, and second in the low hurdles, together with Ostrander, the crack Hamilton long distance runner, did splendid work for their respective colleges. The intercollegiate records were brol\:en in the tnile walk, pole vault, hammer throw and shot put. Union's defeat is mainly due to her weakness in the field events, for with but one exception the Clintonites were victorious in thetn. The first race, the roo yard dash, was pulled off pron1ptly at z: 30 P. M. At the crack of the pistol the 1nen shot down the track, Van Allen and I-Ienderson neck and neck with Price.

Before a large and appreciative audience, the minstrels gave their per:forrnance last Tuesday evening. The house was w,eH filled, and from beginning to end, showed etil tire satisfaction at the efforts of the boys. The performance was a little delayed, owing to the length of titne taken by the inter-collegiate tneet ; but from 8 : 30 until the near approach of midnight merriment rei~ned supreme.

ATTENTION-Will those who have not paid their subscriptions kindly do so as soon as possible. Make all checks :payable to the busi- ness manager. EVERY one who took part in the minstrel per- formance deserves to be complimented. The chorus was strong, and the specialties introduced took well. The show was a success both artistically and financially, and the managen1ent deserves great credit. The performance was rendered for the benefit of the athletic association, and the pro- ceeds will be quite an addition to the treasury. THE baseball tean1 will have to brace up. After playing first-tate ball for the greater part of the season, the team seems to be growing weak. There are a number of important games still left on the schedule and the team should put forth its best efforts to win them. Some of the men do not seem to realize the importance of keeping in good form, and this is a very essential thing, if the team wishes. to perform good work.. There is no reason . ·-~ ~ _.. . ..- ... ,. .. why Union cannot have a strong team if the men will only attend to business. .We do not like to criticize the work of the team, hut when the students have subscribed a. :good sum .for basebaU, they expect to get something in return, and we feel it our duty to criticize, w-hen things seem to be going the wrong way. WE ARE sorry to be con1pelled toehronicle another defeat for Union in track a:thletics. Although the men sh.ow·ed up finely, Hamilton won the pennant for the second time, and by a good margin. HamU- ton had to work hard for sotne of the events, and if Union had better facilities for training, the result might have been far differeE,t. Colgate and Hobart were not represented in aa.y of the events. We do not think this at all fair to, the other members of the league. These colleg-es should have taken part even at some sacrifice. It C!loes not seem right :for these colleges to enter only in those branches of athletics in which they are strong, and refrain from entering those in which they are weak. They ought to be willing to come out and show what they can do. It is gratifying to note that the meet was a success financially. The day was pleasant and a great many Union alumni and others interested in the college were in attendance.. More than enough to cover expenses was taken 1n at the gate, and there will remain a neat balance to be divided amoNg the members of the league. Tv~ Ba5~ball Ol.ltloo~. Now that Hamilton hf.ls captured the track pennant, the students are n1ore than ever of the, determination that the b~seball championship must come to Union. There have been rurnors afloat that the Colgate tean.1 has disbanded but up to Thursday night Manager Gatnbee had received no official notice to that eftect. Whatever the truth may be about this, it is safe to say that the contest has now narrowed down to one between . Union and Hamilton, for the latter by defeating Colgate last Saturday by .a score of r6 to 4, tied with Union our league standing of four games won and one lost.

On Saturday last Union played her second garne with the Schenectady Citys, a local teatn. The game resulted in a victory for the latter, and, though loosely played, there were several features which n1ade it interesting. l\1allery was in the box and pitched fait· ball, but was miserably supported. The whole tea1n played with a listlessness, indicating that some- thing was radically wrong. Except for Rice's wildness, he pitched an effective garn.e. Cook's playing behind the bat for Union was hardly up to the standard. Edwards covered first in place of Hegeman and Carver played French's position in right field. Most of the runs were lTlade in the first four innings. The features vvere the three double plays made by Union as a result of Bradt's erratic base running, and Lawton's catch of Hourigan's fly in the fifth inning. The score: UNION. A. :B. R. lB. P.O. A.

Clarence A. Walworth, f__,~,L. D., is another one of Albany's grand old n1en. He was born in Plattsburgh, N.Y., on IVIay 30, 1820, thus making hin1 within a few weeks of being seventy- , nine years old.

In 1848 he was ordained and returned to America in 1850, he joined the late I. T. Hecker and others, in 1858, for the purpose of founding the order of Paulists. Being affiliated to the diocese of Albany, he was appointed pastor of St. Mary's church in 1866. To the present date he has labored indust- riously in the interests of Roman Catholicism and has retained his position at the head of St. Mary's. Much of hts time has been spent in the interest of the temperance cause and he has distinguished himself as a writer and lecturer. It is tnainly through his efforts that St. Mary's school, on Lodge street, is be~ng built, and toward the estab- lishment of this school he has been a liberal sub- scriber.

The forty-eighth comrne11oement of the Al- bany Law school was held last week Thursday in the cotntnon council cha·mher at Albany. The exercises connected with the commence- rnent were very brief but exceedingly interest- ing. The auditorium p(}rHon of the chatnber, was filled with spectato1·s and I-Iolding's orchestra discoursed approprir:de rnusical selections. G.eneral An1asa J. Parker, president of the school presided. The exercises began with aH overtut~e followed by prayer by Rev. E. G. Shelden, D. D., chapUn. In accornance with a vote of the graduates, it was decided to otnit orations by students at the exercises and instead to have one discourse upon l~r\v by an able and experienced jurist. The speaker of the evening was the l-Ion. John Franklin Fort, president-judge of the court of common pleas of the State of Nevv Jersey, who graduated from the Albany Law school with the class of '72. Judge Fort called attention, briefly, to the true province of the lawyer, and the necessity for fair dealing with both client and opponent. He laid stress upon the need of broadness as well as shrewdness in the legal profession and reminded his hearers that success was only to be attained by good hard work. After a musical se[ection, J. Newton Fiero, LL. D., dean, presented the candidates for graduation. This was in the nature of a necessary formality preliminary to the presenta- tion of diplotuas. The n~unesofthe new lawyers- to-be were read ofl and then Andrew V. V. Rayn1ond, D. D., LL. D., president of the university, made a short address, following with the handing of the di plotnas to each of the graduating students. ~ Then followed the presentation of prizes by President Parker. The first of these was the Edward Thompson & Cotnpany's prize, ''American and English Encyclopedia of Law,\ which vvent to Fnu1k M. Patterson, of Albany, a graduate of Yale, for tb:e best thesis upon a legal topic. The Amasa J. Parker prize-cash, $5o-went to S. Miles Bouton, of Jamestown. The dean's prize '' Special Actions and Special proceed- ings,\ 2 vols., went to Benja1nin L. Wells, of Bangor, for ciass vvork. 1\'ne · Matthew Bender prize, \ American Electrical Cases,\ 2 vols., vvas awarded to Foster Pruyn, of Albany. The faculty prize-cash, $25-went to Daniel M.

The year has been a most successful one at the Law school and a high grade of work has been done by the students. It has been the first year of the two-class system ; that is, it is the first year that there has been a junior class in addition to the senior class, and this systetn will be con- tinued. Three new members have been added to the faculty during the year: Messrs. Abrahatn Lansing, Fletcher W. Battershall and Stephen B. Griswold.

Aside from their regular examinations, there was the Inter-Collegiate tneet and the Williams gam.e. But in society, too, was the class of '99 represented. Two afternoon teas were given to the n1embers of the senior cTass during the week. The first was tendered by Prof. and Mrs. Ashmore on Wednesday after- noon, May 31. Nearly all the graduating class were present and were entertained by Miss Ross, of Troy, who gave several hun1orous recitations. On Friday afternoon Mrs. Raymond gave anothe1· reception for the seniors. The class was well represented, and a number of towns- people were present. At both these receptions the following young ladies assisted in receiving: The Misses Brown, Strain, Schoolcraft, Paige, I-Iildreth, Price, Lewis, Alexander, Beattie, Susan Yates, Dora Yates, and Walker. psi lJ'S EQtertaii]. Fxiday evening, June 2, the Theta chapter of Psi Upsilon very pleasantly entertained a small company at a dance given at the chapter house. All the lower floor of the house was cleared for dancing, and in addition to this the pleasant weather rendered it possible to use the large vex.anda outside.

THE CONOORDIENSIS. rfew War~ For :professor :progeer. It is with sincere regret that the Concordl.ensi:s learns of the resignation of Professor Charles S. Prosser. He has been at Union since r894, and has found many friends a,mong the faculty, btudents, and the people of Schenectady. Prof. Prosser bas been elected associated pro- fessor of historical :geology at Ohio s:eate Uni- versity. Prof. Horton, who is at the :head of the departtnent, is one of the greatest geologists in the country, having been Ohio State geologist since r88r ; he is also president of the Geological society of America. He is over .seventy years old, is about to retire, and Prof. Prosser wiU eventually succeed him. Prof. Prosser has received many messages of congratulation, amot1g thern being ietters from Prof. VVtn. B. Clark, professor of geology .at Johns Hopkins and State geologist of Maryland; Prof. Henry S. Williams of Yate ;. John W. Clarke, New York State paleontologist; Prof. Chas. W. Hargitt of Syracuse university; Prof. Chas. L. Edwards of the university of Cincin- nati, and Prof. Ralf S. Tarr of CornelL Prof. Prosser is author of '' The Devon ian System of Eastern Pennsylvania and New York,\ \ Pern1ean and Cretaceous Systems of ICansas,\ '' Classification and Distribution of the Hamilton and Chemung Series of New York,\ and nutn- erous other papers. He will be engaged in geological work in Western Maryland during the 1nonths of July and August, and will assume his duties at Ohio State university about Sep- tember I. pl)i Beta ~appa Elee:tiof). A special tneeting of the Union chapter of :the Phi Beta I<appa society was held in Washburn hall Tuesday afternoon, President Ript()n presid- ing. The following seniors were elected to membership: Edw.ardW. Strong, Schenectady; Snyder Gage, Johnstown; Irving W. ICetchun1, Schenectady ; Harrison K. Wright Pu1aski, and Charles C. Ballard, Schenectady. They were immediately iniated, and are now swinging keys. fl.f)ot~:({r Vietory for WilUam:s. In the ga.me on the campus on Saturday last, Union was badly defeated by Williarns. As Williams has an especiaHy :strong team this year, it was hardly hoped that she would be beaten, and Union tried to hold down the runs, · but with little success, as in five innings seven- teen runs had been scored by :the visitors. Mal- lery pitched for Union during the :first part of the game, and Willian1s found no trouble in hitting him. The team work of Union was loose and many costly errors were made., while the Williams players gave evidence at every point of their constant tl·aining. Union was unable to find Jansen when a hit would have counted for a score, and the Williams players let nothing drop. In the sixth Edwards was substituted in the box, and Williatns made only two hits during the rest of the gan1e. In the ninth French reached third, and on Jansen's wild pitch made the Garnet's only run. The score in detail : UNION. Purchase, s. s ....... . Robinson, l.f ......... . Lawton, r. f ......... .

'I'HE SENIOR ball committee calls attention to the fact that many students have not paid their sub- scriptions for the 11ew floor in the rDund building-. This neg-lect has already postponed the construc- tion of the floor a week, and thecomtnittee earnestly desires that there be no 1nore delay, as the :floor will not be cotn}>letcd until all the tnoney is paid in. The class subscriptions are being collected by the respective treasurers and everyone should feel it his duty to pay his class assessment. AGAIN the Concordiensis 1nust ask \\Vhat has be- come of the ~ass athletic 1nanag-ers. Why have they not arranged a schedule of class baseball. gan1es? There is a valuable silver trophy to be contested for, and €Ven with this incentive there had been no intei~class games up to Wednesday night. But it's not to late even at this date; let the four managers get together at once and arrange a schedule to be played off during the next week or two. If the se11i()rs are not able to get a team together let the th1·ee other classes decide which is ,. 1 geological, and Ohio is fortunate in securing oue so thoroughiy master of his subject.

l • H The CoJlcordieJlsis UNION COLLEGE, JUNE 17, l89H. No. 32. fl '.l]:a:IJ'~~ ~iQ tt}e :VQd((:r~raduate :publiea- tioQ:5. At the last college n'l'eeting the student body decided that for the college year of 1'899-1900 the fo1·m of the undergraduate pubHcations be . changed so as to provide for a combining ot the monthly literary tnagazine, the Parthenon, and the news weeki y, the Concordiensis, into one publication, a weekly, to be known as The Concord.iensis, to contain both literary and news matter, and to be under the control of one board of editors. This plan has been under considera- tion for some time, and Monday's action was , . unan1tnous. It has long been felt that the Parthenon has not been up to the standard of other college magazines of its kind, and one reason for this has been the scarcity of undergraduate literary . · matter on its pages. To be sure, the work that · has been published has been of the highest . order, but it has con1.e mainly from the alutnni · i and faculty, and for this reason the magazine ' has not been essentially uttdergraduate in its : tone. To remedy the defect of a lack of under- : graduate literary contributions, it was suggested . that the faculty tnight be willing to make such · matter, if accepted for publication, an equivalent of original work in the department of rhetoric, . i. e., of required essays and orations. 'l\'his plan was taken up, a petition was drawn and pre- sented to the faculty and grante·d by that body . The petition provides that: \During the college year of 1899-1900 liter- ary contributions submitted by the students for The Corcordiensis, and duly accepted therefor, shaH be accepted by the faculty as a substitute in kind for regular work in the departtnent of rhetoric.\ To carry out the above plan the following :rules shall be in force : I. Ail literary work,. in order to be accep. ted . . ' tnust be saHsfactory to the head of the depart- ment of rhetoric {or to any one whom he may nan1~~) and to the editorial board of the paper; and 1f duly accepted, such work is to be an exact equivalent, so far as college requirements are concerned,. to a required essay or oration. II. Every student desiring to take advantage ofsuch offer shall register with the head of the deparhnent of rhetoric, and shall hand in his contrib1:1tions to the editor of the Concordiensi:s .at least two weeks before the date upon which is due the regulaa.· essav or oration of which it is to .take the place. In case the manuscript is rejected, the contributor shall be given notice at the earliest possible date after it is submitted ' and not less than eight days before the said essay or oration is due. III. No individual student shall be allowed to substitute newspaper work for more than one exercise during any college tenn. IV. This substitute work n1ay be taken by any students in any of the four regular classes, except the first term sophomore and third f1~esh tnan. The board of editors is to be chosen as here- tofore, and will consist of: An editor-in-chief, a literary editor, and a news editor, from the senior class; four· associate editors from the junior class; and six reporters from the sopho- tnore class. The appointment of a literary editor is not made by this year's retiring board ~f edito:·~, but a literary editor will be chosen by compebbon from the senior class before Decem- ber r, 1899· Such competition is open to all rnembers ofthe class of 1900. Messrs. I{ing and Brown, of Syracuse Uni- ve~·sity, and Van Guilder, of Brown were guests at the Phi Delta Theta House last Monday evening.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. Active preparations by those in charge are now being made for com1nencement week. On the campus the ever busy superintendent of the ! grounds is seen hard at work; from Memorial ! haH comes the sound of hamn1ers forming the new dancing floor; stroBing about here and there are the idle seniors, engaged for the most : part in coloring their handso1ne new class pipes ; and in the college office are found the genial proprietors busy arnong other things in sending out the conunencement prograrns. Con1mencernent occurs on the rnorning of the twenty-eighth and this day is preceded by three others full .of interest. Sunday ,evening, the tw,enty-fifth, President Raymond will deliver the baccalaureate sermon at the First Presby- terian church. The following afternoon the always attractive grove exercises conducted by the graduating class will be held under the historic elm tree in Jackson's garden. That evening at the First Presbyterian church the extemporaneous prize debate together with the junior and sophon1ore prize oratorical contests will take place. Tuesday being ahin1ni day will be filled with important business. The classes of '39, '49, '59, '69, '74, '79, '84, '89 and '96 will all hold reunions. At nine o'clock wiU come the tneetings of the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigtna Xi societies; at ten the annual 111eeting of the general alumni assiation ; at twelve, balloting for a trustee to succeed the Hon. Wallace T. Foote,jr., A.M., whose tenn of office expit·es ; at one-Hfteen, the alutnni din- ner in Memorial hall; at half-past three, class day exercises in the First Presbyterian church ; and at eight o'clock, a concert in the Van Cur- ler opera house by the College Glee, Banjo and Mandolin clubs; \Vednesday n1orning at ten o'clock the gt·aduating exercises will take place. Mr. HamiHon W. Mabie, well known to Union men, wiil be honorary chancellor of the day. The president's reception and the senior ball in the evening will round up the festivities in a becoming manner. .Mave you JE'ttid yolltr su.)seription '? 'Tuggey, 1900, left Tuesday for Rhode Island where be will spend the summer. T. Hat-ry Keogh, of the Albany Law School, visited fri;ends on the hill during the first part of the week. E. T. Grout, 1901 ,~ has been incapacita;ted fro,tn playing ball during the past week, owing to a strained leg. WiHiatn H. Gillespie, 1902, has received. an appointment as junior clerk in the state Regent',s office as the result of a civil service exatnination. The last Y. M. C. A. meeting of the year was held Tuesday-evening, and Prof. Hoffrnan gave an interesting address. Union will be represented at the Y. M. C. A. conference, which will be held at Northfield, Mass., June 30 to July 9· The next college year will begin on Th urs- day, September 21. Candidates for admission must present their credentials at the President's ·office on Tuesday, September 19th. Entrance exan1inations will be held on Wednesday and Thursday, Septetnber zoth and 21st. Late last week the 1902 class pin made its entrance into the college world. It consists of a circular disk, one half of which is covered by garnet enatnel, the other by royal purple. In the middle is a representation in gold of the idol's head, while above the head is inscribed, ''Union.\ and below \1902.\ It is certainly the most unique and novel pin that has appeared on college hill in several years. On Tuesday of last week the seniors and · juniors played the first inter-class baseball game of the season. But four innings were played and the score stood 6 to 3 in favor of the seniors. The teams played as follows: Seniors, p., Hinman; c., Huntley; 1b., Hegeman; zb., Doran; s. s., Gage; 3b., Eames; r. f., Vander Veer; c. f., Strong; 1. f., Fisk.

At New Haven on Saturday May 13, Harvard's track team defeated Yale by a score of 5 I.% to 41 %, and by so doing came into pennanent possession of a $500 cup presented by the graduates of the two colleges, the cup to become the property of the track team that won five out of eight dual games between the two universities. During the last week there· have been sent to Schenectady by the Cuban Educational associa- tion three Cubans and three Porto Ricans. 'This association is doing exceBent work in .aiding those who desire to get an education. It fur- nishes thetn transportation and tuition free, and they are in return expected to help pay their board and rent and be ready :to do any work re- quired of the111. General Joseph Wheeler is president, Gilbert K. Harr0un is secretary and treasurer, and among the trustees at~e such men as Albert Shaw, Wm. H. Baldwin, jr., and Nicholas M. Butler. Mr. Harroun is spending a great deal of his ti:tne i,n. trying to find places for these young rnen, and now has on his list the natnes ·of 500 men who have applied. Labas Meneses y :Com:ll!s, Etntnanue1 Fuente- villa, and Francisco I. Te1eechea, are Cubans, and Jose Benet, Jose CarbaUeira, and Antonio F. Castro, are Porto Ricans. Meneses was a captain in the Cuban anny and was an aide-de- catnp to Gen. Maceo untH the latter's death, when he held the same position under Gen. Garcia.

Chas. \Burrows Printer, -414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. WITH LAST week's issue, the '99 board of editors of 'The Concordiensis completed its labors. T11ey desire to thank all those who have interested them- selves in the publicati<n1 by literary contributions, criticisms or subscriptions and to ask for those who are to publish the paper next year, the loyal suppod of alumni, faculty, students and friends of Old Union. The last official act of the retiring board is the announcement of the a:ppointn1ent of next year's board of editors as follows : Philip L. Thomson, 1900 ........... Editor-in-chief Lester T. Hubbard, 1900 ............. News Editor A. S. Golden, 1901, }· P . L. Merriman, 1901, · A . t E . J. MeN a b. , 1901, .: ....... ~ ssoc1a e · d1tors C. P. Wagoner, 1901, R. R. Crim, 1902, 1·· D. E ..

Parsons, 1902, · · With this issue, the new board of editors of The Concord~ensis assumes. control of the paper. It is our :fi. rst aim to make The Concor diensis a c~edi t and an honor to the institution it represents, and for the fulfillment of this aim w~e call for the aid of all those who have the interests of the college at heart. Criticisms will a.lways be gladly wel- comed. If the paper does not come up to your ideal of the college magazine do not hesit~te to say so. Only give us the benefit of your suggestions. The board of ed'itors in their offi~cial capacity are simply the means through which the student· body acts. Every individual as one member of the student body has an interest in the ~cotlege magazine .. O:n this basis let us work together during the com- ing year, and the results of our labors are ~ure to redound to the glory of Alma Mater. MoNDAY morning's action regarding the change in the college publications was just right, and the outlook for next year is certainly bright. As an experiment the Parthenan has not been. a success. Its three years of existence have proved that here at Unio11 under present conditions there is no :field for a separate literary magazine. This fact must be granted by all. It is not, then, a retrogression to combine the two papers. On the contrary the new Concordiensis as an exponent of college life has a definite field before it, and one which in its new form it ought to cover. The arrangement made with the faculty in regard to literary work is certainly a plan well worth trial. The.incenti.ve to write which has been lacking is .now supplied, and there is no reason why every man in college should not take advantage of the offer. SoME of the students are laboring under the mis- taken idea that the senior ball committee is laying the new floor in the Round building as a financial vertttt re. The sooner this idea is dropped, the better. The committee is not a money making organization and intends to make a .full statement of receipts and expenditures at the proper time. Carpenters are now at work on the floor, but it will not be completed until all .the subscriptions are paid in. It is the intention of the committee to give a dance in the .building as soon as .the floor is f e 0 ] ] t 1 I 1 1

e e d finished. The price of admission will he only enough to cover the cost of music and the dance ought to be largeiy attended. IT IS gratifying to note that the l§nion Classical Institute is taking a renewed interest ~n athletics. Last Friday on the college track the institute held ; · an inter-class .meet-· something never before at- • tempted in the school's history-· and though the · records were anything but startlin;g, the showing- , made w-.s not poor when the fact is considered that ' almost no training at all was done in preparation. : As a preparatory school the U. C. 1. has heretofore ' failed to lay enough stress on athletics. This has :. been partly at least due to the fact that the ~hr€e · year course has crowded the class-room work to · such an extent that the students have had little or no time for legitimate outdoor sports. Now that this has been remedied by the introduction of the regular academic four year course, there is very properly a gtowing interest in things athletic. Friday's meet demonstrated that there is in the Classical good material, and a meet :£or next year is an assured fact. Now it seems to us right in line with this that Union undergraduates have a duty to perform. U. C. I. is the regular pre- paratory school of this college and there ought to exist between the two in future closer re!ations. For one thing, the school is hampered by the lack of a gymnasium. We believe that the college authorities and the students ought not only to .allow the classical boys the use of the gymnasiun1 and apparatus but ought to encourage them to use the privilege. Then, too, student coaches for football, baseball and track athletics could render the town boys material aid, and in the end Union is not go- ing to be the loser for that sort of treatment. Wednesday afternoon about thirty members of the junior and sophomore classes, under the conduct of Instructor Opdyke, inspected the entire plant of the General Electric company. These classes have been studying electricity under Prof. Wright, and the visit to the General Electric plant was a part of the term work. Th.e party greatly enjoyed the tour of the works. The tennis tournam·ent in progress- on .the col- lege courts is proving a success. The fellows this yea.r are taking a marked interest in tennis, and the courts are filled e¥ery afternoon. The tournament entry list is fhe largest since the fall of '97, a11d the reason for this increased .en- thusiasrn is doubtless owing :to the fact that the grounds bave been carefully attended to and are in excellent condition.

'rltffi CONCOltb!ENStS. The musical association will give its annual June concert on the evening of Tuesday, June 27, at the Van Cude.r opera house. The differ- ent clubs will render new :tnusic and the feature of the perfonnance vvill be the production of John. Kendrick Bangs' farce, \'Proposing Under Difficulties,\ by Messrs. H. J. l-Iinman, W. C. Yates, H. C. BothweU and Wagner Van Vlack. The :musical association of the past year has been one of the best which ever tepresented Union, and the nu1nagement has been very efficient. But the cos,t of hiring 1eaders for the several clubs is large, and this together with the deficit on the western trip has left the managers with a debt, which the proceeds ofthe June con- cert ought to wipe out. The good which the 1nusical association does the college cannot be estimated, and of all the college organizations it is nearer to being self- suppot·ting than any other. The students are not called on for large subscriptions for the clubs, but the 1nanagen1ent ·earnestly de&ires that the fellows turn out in goodly nun1 hers at the concert in com tnencement week.
