Union College Thespians Satirize Italian Nobility. By Roy Fruiterman The Mountebanks' first production of the season, \Mistress of the Inn,\ will open Wednesday, December 8, and run through Sunday, December 12. The play, written by Carlo Gold~ni, is a frothy comedy and sly satire demonstrating the foibles of the so- ciety in which the author lived. theatre crew, this season, will be ex- perimenting with new production tech- niques to- adapt better the theatre to other productions. Tickets for \Mtstress\ are now available to the student body at no cost. Tickets for dates of students are on sale for $1.00, while all other tick- ets are $1.50. The Nott Theatre box office is open between 1 and 7 P .1\'l. in N ott Memorial. An outline plan for community gov- ernment was p1•esented t0 the All C0l- .Jege Council this week, and will be sent to the tSudent Affai·rs Committee of the Facul·ty Council in a few days. The committee is the fi1·st of six bodies whic>h rnust pass judgment on the proposals, which were advanced by the Student Council, before the ren- ov:ation of government at Union can be effected. The outline calls for a new govern- ment structure which will subsume student and faculty groups under an \All College Council\ c0mposed of rep- resentatives ·Of the students, faculty:, and administration. The new Council, the plan states, will possc·ss a veto power over actions by the Student Council and the I:;f',Qi ·: · ·. The Council wilt speak as the ad- ministration in approving or disap- proving motions previously passed by the Student Coun~il or I.F.C. Only the president of the College, act!Ol'ding to the ·present .proposa'ls, can reverse a ruling of the new \all College Coun- cil.\ Assured Sct·utiny Under this system, legislation or resolutions passed by the Student Council and LF.C. will be assured of administrative . scrutiny and, if ap- proved by the Council, ultimate imple- mentation. A.t IJresent, Dean Lock- wood said Tuesday, the administra- tion rarely kruo\vs what to do with a Student Council resolution when it re- ceives one. The Student Council's initial offer- ing underwent a preliminary round of revisions at a meeting of the All Col- lege Council Tuesday evening. It wa.s generally agreed that the new do~in­ ant body would serve both as a review board and as a source of recommenda- tions for action. The Council will also be empowered to ad on resolutions of the Faculty Council. The Faculty will continue to exercise full control over the academic sphere, as expressed in its constitu- tion. In non-academic areas, however, the \All College Counci·l\ will retain a veto power. Stttdent Opinion The members of the present All Col- lege Council col11Curred that the new organization should by no. means e.s- tl\ange itself frorn academic's. It Wlll perform the muc:h needed function of allowing the factJlty t(} hear student opin:ion and l'ecommen,da.tions concern- ing their educations. \Mistress Go.ldoni's most famous play, is being directed ~y. Prof!!'sS<fr William Meriwether. Assisting h1m m the design and decoration are Mrs. Doris Johnson and Werner Liepolt, '66. Hal Lamberson, '67, is in charge of set construction while Bill Leiderdorf, '67 is managing the search for un- us~al properties by a period produc- tion. Union, Simmons Glee Clubs Unite For Christmas Sing The central character, Mirandolina, is wooed by three: a Marqui·s, a Count and a Cavalier. The play shows how Ylirandolina reacts to each on':'s pm- posals. These reactions proVlde the show with some of its comical scenes. Nott Firsts In addition to this being the fb'Rt play of the season, \Mistress of the Inn\ will exhibit some other produc- tion firsts in the N ott Memorial Th~­ atre. The stage, usually carpeted, Wlll now have a hard surface, decorated in the period in which. the plar takes place. Replicas of anc1ent .Itahan Inn doors \dll replace cmtams :o;t the Pxits of the theatre (also addmg to the Italian ·spirit of th;\ play. T~e rhano·es of scenery in tins theatre m the ~ound will be exhibited by the moving of miniature fiats.

The Glee Clubs of Union and Sim- mons Colleges will perform in a Christmas conce1't this Sun<lay in Memorial Chapel at 3:30 P.M. Pro- fessor Hugh Allen Wilson of Union and Professor Burton Cleaves of Sirn- mons will share the conducting res·pon- si hili ties. The first selection will be \Jubilate Deo,\ by Giovanni Gabrielli. For this piece the chorus will be accompanied by the Union Co,lege Brass Choir. Following the \Jubilate Deo,\ the Glee Clubs will 'sing four \Motets for the Christmas Season,\ composed by Francis Poulenc. These motets are ex- tremely difficult for amateur coruses. Haydn Work The thhd item on the program is a piece by Mi<Jhael Haydn: \Run Ye Shepherds.\ It is a short conta.ta, featuring a soprano solo. The next numbers will be three Christmas songs: \Holly and the Ivy,\ by Nor- man Demuth; \Shepherds Carol,\ by William Billings, and \Lo How a Rose E'er Blooming,\ by Praetorius. For a finale, the combined Glee Clubs will sing Mabel Daniel's \Exu- tate Deo.\ Professor Wilson will conduct the four motets and the three Christmas songs; Professor Cleaves will lead the other pieces. The following Sun- day the Glee Clubs are to give the same performance at .Simmons Col- lege. \Ninth Symphony\ Following these concerts, the Union Glee Club will start preparation on Beethoven's \Ninth Symphony,\ which is to be pel\formed May 3 in conjunc- tion with the Albany Symphony Or- chestra. This symphony will also be performed until April 30 11-t Mary- mount and at Albany May 20. HUGH ALLEN WILSON, Directing the Glee Club On May 7, Parents Weekend, the Union College Glee Club will give a concert by itself and on June 4, they will hold a Pops Concert in the Field House. Also to be scheduled are a Schemectady Alumni Program and a concert with Bennett College. The last program held by Union was the Mozart Requiem performed on NovEMll!ber 17 in conjunction with the Albany .Symphony Orchestra and the Women's Glee Club of Oneonta State College. Tlle program featured Miss Mildred Fling, formerly with the Metropolitan Ope1'a Studio, and David Dodds, whose work has been presented over national television in a C.B.S. program. In the same vein, the Council wHI serve as a forum for faculty and stu- dent opinion concerning administra- tive policies. Tuesday's meeting tenta- tively agreed that the Council would be able to ask the faculty or the ad- ministration ·to reconsider a move that it did not find favorable. Professor of Physics, Alfred Gobel, Chairman of the Committee on Stu- dent Affairs, expressed the belief that an exchange of ideas through the new joint body will lessen rather than in- tensify faculty-student antagonisms. The problem of the faculty's place in the proposed government will require more extensive study . Eleven Members __ There will be eleven member's of the \All College Council.\ They will in- clude the Student Body President who will serve as Chairman, the President of the LF.C. the Dean and Provost of the Col.Jege, the Dean of Students, two Student Council members, three elec- t~:d faculty rnenrbers, and two students elected at large. It was proposed that candidates for the student posts be screened by a student committee before being given the privilege of running for the position. The proposals must be approved by the Student Affairs Committee, the Faculty Council, the faculty, the I.F.C., the Student Council and the student body. Jantes Far1ner Attacks Anterican Racial Strife/ By Joe Mann The problems confronting the Amer- ican Negro are being overcome, and real freedom is commg slowly, said James Farmer, d.jrector of the Con- gress on Racial Equality at Convoca- tion on November 30. He pointed out that the civil rights revolution is an issue for the entire nation and that the North will see much racial strife in the future. Northerners should begin to prepare now, said Mr. Farmer, to solve the unique problems of northern Negroes. !V!r. !!'armer began noticing that the \drive for equauty\ is a very seri- ous and significant tl}rust in this nation. The civil rights movement is indeed a revolution. Its motiva- tion is not the desire to overl;hrow the government, but the Negro's wish to be wholly mcluded in American society. The word \freedom\ has different meanings for different peo- p.e; an example of this is the south- erner's VIew that he has a right to practice discrimination. Mr. :B'armer then compared the movement to the drives for women's suffrage and labor union orgamzat10n. He sa1d that the rights revolutiOn is a continuation of the American Revo- lution; both movements had as their goal the establishment of llberty hel\e. Enforcement Lackmg The CORE director then mentioned the dichotomy between civil rights legislation and its enforcement. The passage of the CivH Rights Act in 1964 and the Voters' Rights Act in 1965 did not solve the problems of segregation. lVlovmg on to the accomplishments of the revolution, M1·. Farmer said that a very important effect was an increase in mot1vation within the N e- gro communities throughout the coun- try to work for segregation. :Follow- ing the Civil War, southern Negroes accepted segregation as inevitable; but now Negroes are refusing to be \push- ed around.\ .ne L c~<tlled a childhood experience that revealed to him the existence of inequahty in the South. This recog- mtwn affected him greatly, he sa1d, as rt must affect all who experience it unaer segregation. Judicial Change The CORE director stated his belief that unless the southern judicial sys- tem is changed, there will be no jus- tice for the Negro. He recommended the passage of legislation that would make attacks upon civil rights workers a federal offense; that would require the presence of Negroes on juries for this type of trial; and would provide for changes of trials to states other than where the crime (Continued on Page 6, Col. 4) Kemeny Probes Human Thought By Jim Koltz John Ke·meny, Professor of Mathe- matics and chairman of the Mathe- matics Department at Dartmouth Col- lege, will give a convocation address Tuesday, December 7, at 11:30 in Me- morial Chapel. Mr. Kemeny w iII speak on the \Impact of Computers on Human Thought.\ Mr. Kemeny's schedule du1·ing his stay on Union's campus, tentatively arranged by Professor Martin, in- cludes dinner at Alpha Delta Phi Mon- day evening, December 6. After break- fast in Hale House on uTesday, Mr. Kemeny will conduct a 9:30a.m. class in Math. 31. Then at 12:30 he will have lull!ch in West College. A press conference will be held for him at Hale House between 2 and 2 :30 p.m. Trimester System From 3:30 to 4:30 on Tuesday, there will be an informal meeting with him for s';udents and faculty in Room 111, Carnegie Hall. He plans to have an early dinner so he may return to Dart- mouth where he will conduct his last class before final's. Since Dartmouth is on the trimester system, our faculty members are eager to discuss prob- lems that may be encountered in Un- ion's. transition to trimester. Professor Gati emphasized that John Kemeny is a philosopher as well as a sceintist and mathemetician. Mr. Kemeny wrote the book: A Philoso- phl\r Looks at Science. He was eo- author of :Introduction to Finite Ma- thematics, Finite Mathematical Struc- ture, and Finite Markov ChaiPlJ. Mr. Kemeny was born in Budapest, Hungary in: 1926 and enrigrated to the United States. in 1940. He became a naturalized citizen in 1945. He was. an assistant in the theoretical department of the Los Alamo's Project. He received his bachelor of arts degree from Princeton in 1947 and his doctorate in 1949. Besides instructing at Prince- ton, he has conducted classes in math- ematics and chemistry at Dartmouth. He currently resides with his wife and two children in Hanover, New Hamp- shire. Prof. Cle~nents Awarded Danforth Teacher Grant Bruce T. Clements, inS>tructor of English, has been awarded a Dan- forth Foundation Teacher Grant. He is one of 50 faculty members from colleges and universities across the country to receive a grant for graduate study leading to the Doctor- ate. Clements hopes to complete all the course work fol\ the Ph.D. at the State University at Albany during his one- year leave of absenee. He described the award as being \a very generous grant.\ Winners of the Danforth Teacher Grants are selected from 435 nom- inees. Candidates are nominated by the schools a,t which they are teach- ing. If they are involved in admin- istrative work, they are required to have spent at least half of their time in classroom instruction. l\'loral Commitment In ad.dition, grants are awarded only to those ·teachers with a strong religious commitment or who are con- cerned with religious and moral ques- tions. The Danforth Foundation pays the winner one-half of his salary, plus one-third of the salary for each de- pendent. The maximum award is $6,000. The foundationalso provides for univel'sity fees an dsimilar ex- penses. Prof Clements received his baccal- aureate from Columbia University in 1953, an<! his B.D. from the Union Theological Seminary in 1956. He has been a member of the Union College faculty since 1962.

Tra.gic Character Friday, Decemer 3, 1965 N.Y. Notes: Freni Magnificent At The Metropolitan By Robert Stolzberg The MeGropolitan Opera production of Gaetano Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Am()re on Sarturday, November 27 was a fine example of a glittering ~ascade of musical brilliance. Thomas Schippers conducted, with Mirella Freni singing the lead role of Adina. The opera was written in 1832, with Donizetto and his libretticist, Felice Romani, working under a two-week deadline. It is a delightful work, filled with passages which .gives the singel' ample opportunity to show his stuff. B'tl!t this is, at the same time, the chief drawback of the piece, as it is all icing and no cake. The story line is ex:traordinarily weak, even for Italian opera. This tends to vitiate the special power l)f ()pera as a form which combines both story and music, and places the entire burden of entertaillment upon the music. Sin9er and Actre.ss Fartunately, the musicians involved in this performance were up to the task. Special praise must go to Miss Freni. Having previously .sung ~ '• at Italy's La Scala and with l\!losDow's Bolshoi Opera, this is her premiere season with the Met. She sings the role beauti- fully, her soprano YOiC'e capable of handling· all that is requirerl. Also noteworthy is her skill in ·• acting the part, necessary to make it even some- what believable. Sopranos who can act frl'e very rare commodities, and I hope .to see Miss Fl~eni singing with the Met for many years to come. Fernando Corena as the quack Doctor Dulca- mara and Mario Sereni as the romantic SeTgeant Belcore, are well-known to Met-goers. Both ad- mirably fulfill the musical and comical demands made upon them. .Jir. Corena is particu1arly .ef- fective in the bouffe scenes when he is sellin.g his so-called medicine. Essence of Sadness Nicolai Gedda is Iess successful as Nemorino, a peasant with, from the program notes, \a hope- less emotion (passion would be too strong a ) word)\ for Adina. His voice often appears too light for the rapid staccato passages his part often calls for. In the famous aria, Une Furliva lagrima {One furtive tear), he fully captures the \ ,.·• essence of U emorino's sari ness. This aria, the climactic scene of the opera, was done to perfec- tion, more powerful and touching than anything else in the performance.

Partly becau·se of this, partly because of the direc- tion, the doom Gypo !'-J' olan is preparing for him- self do-es not seem in·evitable, and one gets the feeling of impatienre that always comes when what s.hould be an org~mically consistent, natural downfall seems to be turning into a dramatic pushover.

Black Man In The South This article was wt·itten and prepared by members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. To be black in America is unfortunate: to be black in the South is a crime. The penalty for this crime is ce1i:ain and severe-life hnpri'sonment in a gigantic cell. Outside the cell, people g() to school and college, run the government that de- cides your fate and make enough money so that their children can follow in their footsteps. In- side the cell you watch anrl-having no vote, no school and no money-you do the best you can and wait. Yon wait and hope someone wHl break down the wall. In the lase four years, some c!'acks have been made in this wall. The SUMMER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION AND POLITICAL EDUCA- TION (SCOPE) project intend's to widen these cracks. To do this it will be necessary to attack political disfranchisement, educational de-privation and poverty-and to help local leadership develop and organize the community. Political Dishanchisement In m()re thoan one hundred counties in the black belt of the South, Negroes comprise over 50% of the population, yet less than 10% of the elector- ate. No real solution to the problems of the South is possible until all its citizens share equally in its government. The new federal voting bill which Crmgress is expected to pass shortly gi'Ves new hope, but rep1·esents an enormous challenge. Fo1· these reasons the SCOPE projeet will give prior- ity to VOTER REGISTRATION. SCO·PE v·olunteer workers-in cooperation with local leadership-will conduct inten'sive summer long voter l'egistration drives. Hand in· hand with this work will be an attempt to unify and coordi· nate the increased electorate. Successful coordi- nation is neces&a~~y to gain immediate, tangible and continuing returns. Evening classes-conducted by SCOPE work- ers-will teach the basics of federal, state and county politics. Political education is essential if long deprived citizens are to use their newly ac- quired political power for the maximum benefit of their commWlity. - Educational DePrivation In Georgia alone half of the adult Negroes have less than four years of formal education-in othe1· words, are functionally illiterate. In an effort to comb~t this tremendous problem the Southern. Christian Leadership Council has set up a Citizen- ship Education Program which is now active in eleven southern states. The Citizenship Education Program is an adult education project that teach- es basic politics, English, arithmetic, and other \academic\ subjects as well as more practical things such as writing checks, applying for social secul'ity, and filling out voter registration forms. ln addition - and perhaps most important - classes in Negro history and heritage lift the great weight of forced humiHati-on, allowing a new ~ense CYf dignity and identification. SCOPE work- ers with teaching ability will be called on to assi~t and expand this program by becoming citizenship school teachers. Some volunteers may also want to work up a special tutorial program to benefit the youth. Teaching materials for citizenship srhool classes will come from the Atlanta SCLC office; but the understanding, patience and dedication necessary in every teaeher will have to come from the work- ers themselves. Poverty In the Negro communities of the black belt, the \affluent society\ of the richest nation on earth is a grotesque joke. Old men pieking up rag'S to buy their next meal, women looldng for scTap lumber to heat their shacks and childt·en going barefoot in thirty degree weather have a hard time laughing. In over one hundred counties in the South, the median income fot· N<:>groes is less than eight hun- dred dollars a year. In far too many counties, the average Negro income is less than three hundred dollars per year. Due to the recalcitrance of the local white power structure, the \War on Poverty\ wi'll never to-uch these people unless they receive outside assistance. SCOPE workers will be called upon to bring the \War on Poverty\ to these commru1ities assisting in the establishment of Community Action Pro- grams and Neighborhood Youth Corps Projects as outlined in the Economic OpportUllities Act. SCOPE workers should also familiarize themselves with other federal aid programs such as small- business loans and farm aid and technical assist- ::mce which could benefit their communities. The SCOPE Proiect The SUMMER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION AND POLITICAL EDUCATION project is part of the program of SCLC's Voter Registration and Political Educ-ation Department, headed by Mr. Hosea Wi:lliams. A major goal is to establish links between communism in the South and col- lege campuses throughout the nation which will continue to produce creative programs and vital interchange in the years ahead. The project will work in counties, in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina .and Virginia. People who wish to go down South, frpom this college, will work as a unit, and be assigned to the same countie's. Individuals may also apply and be assigned to a unit. If you are interested in helping out, in any way, please leave your name and college address in Concm·dy's box, in thl'! student activities office. SCOPE needs people to help with publicity, to help raise money, to go work down South, and to help organize other, better works. L'Elisir d' Amore is tenta- tively scheduled for December 11 and December 24, both at 8:00 P.M. This reviewer strongly urges anyone interested in opera to try to make those performances. * * * * Leonard Bernstein continued a series of con- certs which survey music of the twentieth cen- tury, on Saturday the 27, with a performance of the American composer Charles !Yes' Symphony #3 and Gustav Mahler's mammoth Symphony #9 in D major. Roth pieces received excell\lnt treatment at the hands of the Philharmonic Or- chestra. 'The Camp MeetinQ' Ives, who died in 1954, was an insurance~· ales- man during much of his career as a coni· oser. This was necessary d·ue to the nearly co:. plete neglect he received. One of the few fl\en to appreciate his work was Mahler, conductor of both the Metropolitan Opera and the Philhar· monic in the years preceding his death in 1911. The Ives work, called \The Camp Neeting,\ was written in 1904, but was not produced until 1947, when it immediately won a Pulitz;er prize. Its music is taken from the sound of American life. Many parts show the typical Ivesian use of polytonality and contrasting themes. :Mr. Bern- stein was at his best for this number, and that can be very, very good. He lwpt the necessary balance between the tempos and the rhythms, the melodies and the dynamics. It was a superb per- formance. Mahler's Ninth The Mahler Ninth is the compl)ser's last fin- ished work. He wrote it with the su1·ety that l1e would soon die, a surety caused, in part, by his mystical belief that he must follow his several predecessors, notably Beethoven and Bruckner, who had died after completing nine symphonies. He wrc;te it while in New York and a very sick man, working much harder than his doctors ad- vised. His premonitions of death are clearly heard in the music, giving it an extra!Hdinary power and sensitivi.ty. The symphony received 1ts first performance in 1912, abou.t a year after Mahler's death, under the baton of his disciple Bruno Walter. The performance was inconsistent, being gen- e1·ally more effective in the slower passages. This was primarily Mr. Bernstein's fault, as he en- gaged ih the most remarkable exhibition of gym- nastics I have ever seen on a musical powium, violently swaying back and forth and jumping up and down. His performance was highly distract- ing from the music and was detrimental to it. He was able, however, to produce fine shadings in the lingering passager; which were truly mag- nificent.

Luckily, it was the good and the inspirational which were easily the predominant. 135 ERIE BOULEVARD SPECIAL STUDENT TRIP RITZ RESTAURANT Boulevard Bowl EIJROPE- by Ship- $175.00 up Departure July 2 - Returning Aug. 23 OTHER SAILING DATES AVAILABLE SCHENECTADY TRAVEL BUREAU 424 STATE ST.

In coming months, however, this spirit is in danger of being drained by excessive wrangling and tainted by a Letters To The Editor confusion of detail.

It can serve as an active spring for positive innova- tion, not solely as a receptacle for activities carried on else- where. It will be a wide-open arena into which every hot- potato on campus will be readily tossed. In considering the proposals now before them, the stu- dents, and, particularly, the faculty, should dispel any fears about usurpation of the power they exercise within their own spheres. There is no need for additional pro- visions constricting the new Council - provisions which could milk the body of its pervasive ability to integrate the entire college and, indeed, render it stagnant and cap- able only of passive, negative functions. A Commitment My one question to Mr. Tulloss i!., however: Is it not demanding a great deal of one person to be Surprise I a scholar, a teacher, an expert in wo11ld affairs and .a moral lead€r? The burden of being aware of and responsible for situations such as Vietnann rests with ev- eryone, not only with a faculty group, but also with the student and with every citizen. Opinions are needed from all sides. Cer- tainly the £acuity member must demonstrate an interest and, in this sense, serve as a \moral touchstone,\ burt; he also reaches a point where inspiration is need- ed. An active intellectual com- muni.ty demands response from all. If this is understood, bhen an excltange of {)pinion or dia- logue must soon begin. Along with Mr. Tulloss, I hope to see many letters in the Concordiensis, but from students as well as fac- ullty members. John M. Grandin, Dept. of Modern Languages The mass media of our nation report the news of stu- dent activism with a troubled tone. When the cameras pan down upon the faces of resolute young people, demonstrat- ing their foaming, anguished discontent, the audience knows that something is wrong. Sometimes they recognize the existence of the injustice - whether it be Vietnam, free speech, or civil rights. More often, though, the trouble is judged to lie not with the target of the demonstration, but with the demonstrators. The audience is pained at the sight of a child turned rebel - the good student who seemed to be headed toward a prosperous and successful life, suddenly ceasing to care about the frills and excesses upon which American life places so high a value, letting his hair grow long and belt- ing out a freedom song. your ArtCarved Diamond Ring comes 1o yo_... on its own precious throne. The concerned and committed college student whore- fuses to follow the prescribed path of growing up, and lashes out against the abuses of authority, however, has become the norm, not the mutation, of the 1960's. Today, there is something wrong with the student who is not aware, who is not .concerned and who does not wish to be- come part of the movement against injustice. The student body here is by no means composed of a bunch of freaks. The reaction to the words of James Farm- er was a good indication that we are not uninformed or un- committed in the civil rights movement. The Vietnam poll, slim as the results may have been, exhibits a marked lean- ing toward one side in the debate over our role in the war. --Yet,~ there isnocivil rights or~commu:Uity action group on campus, and no political action committee of any species. The activists hide in the woodwork for fear that they will receive no support. But it is not unliliiely that a spark could ignite a glowing fire at Union. The committed stu- dent cannot be silent. If you have something to _say, an organization to initiate - a commitment to make - you can count on this newspaper's aid in informing the campus of your views.

If some 1,500,000 Ne- groes became new· voters, the racial climate in the South could conceivably change for the bet- ter. Retaliation by the white population would surely follow, however. As in the S.ou:th, the vj.ctories of the rights revolution in the North have not significantly changed the life of .the northern Negro. He noted that the poor north- ern Negro is angry and hostile.

DIAMANTE'S Enjoy Our Fine Home Cooked Italian Food in Our Comfortable Dining Room Opp. The Brownell Gate on Nott St. Open Daily 1 0 to 1 A.M. Sundays 5 P.M. - 1 A.M. BY UNABASHEDLY A VIS At l\Ionday's meeting of the 'Moving Finger' Mr. Biddleman of the Skidmore Art Department delivered two papers on the prop- er sphere of the fine arts in the lives of people not professionally involved in art. In addition to Mr. Biddleman, his colleagues, Messrs. Reed and Anderson, and seven students in the art de~part­ ment at Skidmore attended the meeting. Various topics were broached during the readings and the group discussion that foHowed. The one that gained the most enthusiastic (.,·.mment was .the idea that is common in our society that art is something- superficial, some- thing that is to be enjoyed only after the \serious\ matters of life were taken care of. One in- dication of the strength of this is found in the school system, which teaches the child to define aJid limit all that he comes in C'ontact with-the antithesis of art and poetry. Ultimate Potential The collective impression given by the participants in the discus- sion was that they do not share this idea. Rather, art is just that part of life which makes l.ife worth\Yhile, that part of life which makes the \serious\ part dlecth\e. For the \serious\ part sPems, basically, to be useful only in so fur as it allows the indi- vidual to attain his ultimate po- Lt.•ntial, to achieve as much as he can artistically, in a way which is significant in itself rather than as a means to something else. The danger is confusing those insignificant means and the ends Lhemselves. Another topic of interest was the effect of modern means of r~ producing famous art on the interest in art itself. Here the meeting was split, one segment feeling that the over-abundance of cheap reproductions could vit- iate an interest in the originals, ihe other gl'Dup feeling that while the orig.inals would be more sat- isfying, the reproductions were better than nothing. 1 There is another meeting of the \Moving Finger\ on Monday at 7:30 P.M. in Hale House Stud-. ent Lounge. j ~rT~~rT~rrrT~rr~~rr~' FRANK FERRARO Wholesale and Retail fruits ancl Produce - Fresh Daily - Twice Daily on Campus 1231 CRANE STREET Schenectady, N.

F. C. FACULTY :Past and Take a look at the above chart; then a good long look at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft-where technical careers offer exciting growth, continuing challenge, and lasting stability-where engineers and scientists are recog- nized as the major reason for the Company's con· tinued success. Engineers and scientists at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft are today exploring the ever-broadening avenues of energy conversion for every environment ... all opening up new avenues of exploration in every field of aero· space, marine and industrial power application. The technical staff working on these programs, backed by Management's determination to provide the best and most advanced facilities and scientific apparatus, has already given the Company a firm foothold in the cur· rent land, sea, air and space programs so vital to our country's future. The list of achievements amassed by our technical staff is·a veritable list of firsts in the development of compact power plants, dating back to the first Wasp engine which lifted the United States to a position of world leadership in aviation. These engineering and scientific achievements have enabled the Company to obtain its current position of leader· /War Orphan Adoption Investigated By Council The prosject of \adopting\ a Vietnamese ·war orphan was diis- cussed at a meeting of the Student Council, ~ruesday, November 30, in the Hale House Student Leunge. An assistance program for Vietnamese war orphans is being :in- vestigated by President Jeff Ratner. He is currently looking into the program of the International Rescue Committee. The debate in the Gmmcil involved two issues. One was wlu.:·ther the Council should involve i-tself with any kind of a program of this type, and the other was whether this particular program would he the best. The Council decided to look into the iss1;1e f1:1rther and continue discussion when more information is acquired. PresidPnt Removed Dick Corrigan, Persident of the Sophomo1•e Class, missed his second Student Council meeting without sending a proxy and was, according to the Constitution, removed from the Council. He will be 1 replaced by Steve Ritterbush. In other business, Bob Winner, a Sophomore representative, re- ported on a meeting of the C.D.I.C.C. which is an organization of local Student Councils. Bob reported that the committee is currently considering some joint projects, such as plays or dances. Budget Announced The Student Tax Committee Chainuan Allan Starr reported that $31,477.55 has been issued so far, with P200 to be iS'sued in the near future. A detailed report can be obtained from the Student Activities Office. Ed Clark repOI'ted that the ConstituUonal Revision Committee was currently working on plans for community government. Definite plans for this group, titled the All CoUege Council, will be ferth- coming. Work will be done in conjunction with the Faculty Com- mittee on Student Affairs. The Company's first engine, the Wasp, took to the air on May 5, 1926. Within a year the Wasp set its first world record and went on to smash existing records and set standards for both land and seaplanes for years to come, carrying airframes and pilots higher, farther, and faster than they had ever gone before. In recent years, planes powered by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft have gone on to set new standards of performance in much the same way as the Wasp had done in the 1920's. The 727 and DC-9 are indicative of the new family of short-to-medium range jetliners which are powered by the highly successful JTSD turl>ofan. Examples of current military utilizations are the J58· powered Mach 3 Yf-12A which recently established four world aviation records and the advanced TF30-powered F-111 variable· geometry fighter aircraft. 1962 ship in fields such as gas turbines, liquid hydrogen technology and fuel cells.

HOMEMADE SPAGHETTI and MEATBALLS - $1.00 1135 Barrett Street Allison Sees Wrestlers Improving Varsity wrestling coaeh Bruce Al:Jison looks for substantial im- provement in this year's grap- JJlers despite the usual rough schedule. A survey of this year's team seems to justify this op- timism. Returning are J:ast sea- son's two undefeated wrestlers. J e!'e Anderson in the 137 lb. class, and Jan Werner at 152. Equally significant is the fact that last year's four W·eakest weight c:asses are being manned by new men. The newcomers are Bill Waite at 123, Ron Iannotti at 130, Dale Schneider or Dave Read u.t 160, and Gordon Lisker at hea vywei.ght. Schneider, Read, and Lisker are returning veter- ans wrestling in different weight classes. Rounding out the squad a1:e Frye, Fried, and Judge vying for the 145 lb. berth, Corn- wall at 177, and either Schneider or Read at 167. Rough Opponents Colgate, Williams and RPI are ex,pected to provide the toughest opposition for the Garnet gra-p- plers. All 1•egistered one-sided victories over Union last year. Druoklyn Poly and the Univer- sity of Hartford are the new teams on this season's schedule. Brooklyn Poly is expected to be tough while Hartford's strength is an unknown quantity. Hobart, a 28-6 victim last year, will prob- ably be the only weak opponent on this year's schedule. Union may still be hard-pressed to better the 3-6 marks of the past two seasons despite their obvious im- provement. Schedule: Dec. 15 - Rochl:'ster .................

Be- fore coming to Union in 1948, Profes- sor Way held various teaching and administratiOn positions at Knox ranging from pmfessor of physics and department chairman to vice-presi- dent and acting president of the col- lege.

The chairman of the Department of Mathematics and professor of philoso- phy at Dartmouth College predicted that as more and more inteUectual ac- tivity is turned over to the computer, man would either lose himself to the machine or learn to work with the computer to attain a higher level of thought. The ultimate course of ac- tion, he said, will have to he decided by our generation. Einstein Uninformed \Man is producing knowledge at such a huge rate that nobody knows what to do with it,\ Dr. Kemeny claimed. As an example of the effects of the intellectual explosion on the publication of scholarly material, he cited the fact that Dartmouth College has in its 200-year history accumu- lated one million books, but should double that number in a mere 30 years. Even Albert Einstein was unable to keep informed of all the research con- ducted in relativity theory being pub- lished in physics journals and reviews. Dr. Kemeny said that the computer will enable man to overcome his in- tellectual limitations and will there- fore be a major boon rather than a major threat to the knowledge explo- sion. He realized, however, that ae- ceptance <l'f this machine invariably brir.gs about mixed emotions. Some worship the computer for its ability to <l.o everything short of magic, while others view the computer with super- stition and fear as a machine that will be malting human value judgments for society.

Fried To Discuss Year In Finland Dr. Christophr1· Fried, a~sol'iate pro- fessor of psycholng-y, will speak at this year's second Sigma Xi dinne1· meeting on \A Psychological Study of Finnish Village Lifr.\ ThE' lecture \\'ill be held Monday, DerE'mber 1:~. at 8:00 p.m in Hale House. Dr. Fried recently returned from a sabhitical year in Finland, where he and his family engaged in research. During their stay, they lived in two Finnish villages in the eastern and western regions of the country. This was done- in order to study separately the influences of Russian and Swedish culture upon the Finnish peopl~ liv- ing in their re·spective areas. Studied on Two Levels While staying in a village, Dr. Fried and his family studied the people- on two distinct levels: an anthropological level by living with them and taking part in their everyday life; and a clin- ical psychological level, by adminis- tedng psychological tests. At the lec- ture Monday ncight, Dr. Fried will dis- cuss his experiences and whatevel\ con- clusion-s he has made. The lecture is open to all who wish to attend. By Dennis Peskin To the modet':n theater audience, ac- customed to the confrontation of man waiting fot· Godot, of man after the fa:ll accepting his guilt and human be- ing, e>r of man wandering in search of an elusive identity, The MistJ·ess of the Inn by Goldoni seems a pleasant respite. But beneath the comic facade lies an indictment of society that can take its place beside the themes of Beckett, Miller, and Pinter. The satire reveals the impossibility of love be- tween two people in a society which prefet·s appearance to reality. And Gol.doni's indictment of eighteenth centm·y can well be applied to the twentieth. The eighteenth century was char- acterized by highly stylized social con- ventions. But as in or own culture, a great mobility from class to class ex- isted for the individual with money. The virtue or sincel'ity of the individ- ual was submerged beneath the sham wnventions and lost in the struggle for wealth. The drama of this period is particularly concerned with this problem. Sheridan in School for Scan- dal pits one honest, generous and com- passionate man against the disguised treachery and scheming .of his brother. All degrade the first and admire the second, until the facade falls. Virtue ultimately triumphs. A similar result occurs in She Stoops to Conquer by Goldsmith. The misunderstood, well- meaning woman-;shy man finally is accepted and marries the heroine. In both, appearance is the scoundrel, and only when appearances are removed, when the arras is pulled away to re- veal the schemers and eavesdroppers, can there be a happy ending. In Goldoni's Mistress of the Inn, however, the happy ending is not in sight. The hollow society and shallow appe,ar- Continued on Page 3, Col. 3

2 Fraternities: Friday 1 December 1 O, 1965 Friday, 04 AN END TO ACADEMIC CONTROL H. The following speech was reprinted and com- mented on by John R. Kuhl Jr., president of the Interfraternity Council The fraternity system is constantly confronted by faculties of the north-eastern schools with cries about its promotion of apathetic views toward intellectuaUsm. The fraternity man is aware of the fallaey of the charge, and; as a result, has instituted unintellectual scholastic pro- grmus to statistically tlisprove the charge. Dean Hadley S. Deptn·, Hamilton Co.Iege, aptly put forth the inu:ired effect of these programs upon the fraternity in the f{)llowing speech to the :\ a:tional Interfraternity Conference. \The American eollege fraternity has played a unique part in Amrriran education. So long as its aims were definitl', its leadl•rs,hip able, and its processes authoritative, it provided a campus experience and a preparation for life which eanno.t be easily du- plicated by the coHeges and universities in any other form of living arrangement. Lacks Drection \But in recent :years the fraternity has lost its definiteness of aim It has now for so long a time been too mod{•sl or inept to assert its author- ity over its memlwrs in most ma-tters so that the fraternity can llu longer claim itself to be the nurturing institution it once was. But the fra- ternity is neither dead nor moribund, and it has made up for its relaxed li'iscipline and confused organization by many notable gains, \\Jdch, if they have not affected the scholarship of its mem- bers, 'have added a touch of modest meaning to the life of college men. \We must stop talking as though fraternities should, and indeed do, contribute to the improve- ment of scholarship-either within the chapter or without. Such claims are not only unfounded hut unnecessary. \EYen until a fe\v yerm; ago, ~('holarship was construed to he the on,Jy proper intro-duction to the work that lay before students; learning was a natural discipline and the key preparation for Preparation For Life \.:-.:ow most undergraduates come out of a back- ground of business and •affairs and wish a breed- because now you can complete Air Force ROTC in just half the time! Are you interested in starting a military career while in college-but afraid it will cut too deeply into your schedule? Well, here's good news for you. Air Force ROTC now offers a 2-year program. You can start it any time you have 2 years of higher edu- cation remaining-whether on the undergradu- .-:.tte or graduate level. Here's another 2ood thing about this pro- ~ram: you get a chance to \sample\ Air Force life before you sign up. During a special sum- mer orientation session, you get to make up your mind about the Air Force, and the Air Force gets to make up its mind about you. Only conditions within which a spirit of scholarship may be fostered, and that they in no way concern themselves with the promotion or organization l\ of any scholarship programs. Unnecessary Legislation \Fraternity people must not seem to seek a marriage between knowledge and ple·asure; we ,. must simply try to throw them together in the confidence that they will fall in love with one another'. \My plea, then, ifl this: that we now deliberately set ourselves to sweep away 'scholarship pro- grams pr{)paganda and platitudes' and to make a h{)me for the sp•irit of learning; that we re- organize our fraternities on the lines of this sim- ~. ple conception, .that a fraternity is both a mode of association and a body of scholars; that Hs contacts are its realties, its atmosphere of study- living its goat It must ·\'attention : programm dents at a has spokel , proving f students o: the Presit style and tion, toucl • eign stude ter, he doe that intra would brh .& he is cone mosphere very surp not at wa great war ed from J paniment The Hi, '' Peace (H. was the .1 \I am suggesting that fraternities and fra- ternity men not be dragooned into becoming 'scholars' or tempted to become pedants, or have any artificial compulsion whatever put upon them ,, by academic institutions 'Or their own organiza~ tions, but only that they be informally introduced perienee. into the high society of educated men, be exposed 4 ~~~e 8 i,~~j to stimuiating friendships found in a social society •' · of impreE of scholars, and be introduced to the best and flict.

Jabberwocky Dell hUJs produced a highly unusual series of paperbacks of stories and verses for child- ren. Perhaps the best e>f the.se is their ·treatment of Lewis Carrol's 'Jabberwocky' and other poems. The illustrations have startling colours-orange and pink-which makes Car- rol's fantastic crerotures all the more outrageous. If anything is needed to revi!lalise 'The Walrus and rthe Carpenter,' Simms Taback's lugubrious pair do all that is necessary, while the :!iabulous Jabberwock C{)mes 'whiffling through the tulgey wood' in a remarkably ('onvincing manner. Through- {)llt the book the use of garish colours is very successful. The one fau1t in the illustra.tions is that at times the lines of the drawing are rather cluttered. The Owl Also in this series is Edward Lears' 'The Owl and the Pussy- cat.' Here the predominant colour of the illustrations is a brilliant--almost billious green. The characters of this book are, somehow, less pleasingly drawn.

Jack After the two previous books, 'The House that Jack Built' comes as a disappointment. Robert L. Anderson has not chosen to draw a whirlygig of fantastic creatures, but to make his illustrations very precise simple and lifelike in a rather flat stylished way. This Dell series on the whole, however, is a very bold, intrigu- ing experiment, both lively and amusing. Labyrinth ; Otto Bierbaum's 'Labyri11th of Love' was published in 1901; after many editions it is still read in Europe. Louis linter- meyer's poems are not a trans- lation of Bierbaum, but rather are inspired by turn of the cen- tury wit and mannerism. The whole tenor of the poems is archaic. The very lightly tinted line drawings are excellent imita-• tions of the late Vict<>rian style. The poems themselves are not of a particularly high standard, except for the occasional deli- cate evocative image, for ex- ample from 'Warning,' \Autumn: A sullen threat, a treason Of sudden frost and fall- ing leaf.'

Worthless Wealth Instead of seeking love, the char- actet·s expedhntly connive for reputa- tion and money. Ironically both the honor and wealth they amass are real'ly worthll'ss. The :vlarquis F'orli- popoli' title is ·of li-ttle value in the microcosm of the inn. Frabrizio, the servant, offers no homage to the im· poverished Marquis. Instead, he fawns over the boorish Count Albafiorita, who has bought his title with gold. The Marquis's \I am who 1 am\ can- not hide his uselessness, and the money of the Count cannot give him grace. The play suffers somewhat, however, from the lack of contrast that is made on stage between these two figut·es. On stage it appears as if the question is of wealth versus poverty, but in actuality the cGnfiict asises from money's inability to create nobility out of boorishness, and from the impotency of the M.arquis as pro- tector in a society in which his rank can now be bought by anyone. Under- scoring the theme of appearance versus t·eality arc the two actresses. They are perfectly equipped to live in this hl!)llow world where disgui-se is all-important and character nothing. Both the Count and the Marquis, who think them'selves capable judges of women, are fooled by Ortensia and Deiani-ra. The callousness toward the individual is e~pressed in there in- qui-ry into the wealth of the Count, the Marquis,. and the Cavalier. The actresses become the mirror of their society ·as .they ask about each, \Is he rich?\ The cynicism toward love i's reflect- ed in the Cavalier's and F.talwizio the servant's relationship to the mis- \' Co.ncordiensis by Ken BousqueJ. lieut Kraft as the :Vlarquis of Frolap- opoli. tress. The Cavalier rants and raves about the flattery and insincerity of women. But he meets his match in the mistress. He sincerely falls in love with her after she encourages him but then she spurns him after \he falls.\ She finally marri·e's Frabrizio, -an hon~st lover, but only as an ex- pediency. She never returns any love to her suitors. Whereas The Engli:sh satires at least show the possibility of love, and the triumph of virtue, Goldoni's play is pessimistic. The Cavalier of Ripafm:tta, leaves, much the $arne way l.Wolier's misanthrope Gart Blair, Phil Rice and Marge Feiner in the Mountebanks production. flees his society, with his cynicism en- tirely justified. A Bitter Satire The play is a satire, depending upon characterization and posing bitter criticisms of society. It is not a farce, dependent on plot and situation. The Mountebank production of tMs ·satire for the most part succeeds in the por- trayal of the characters. A problem they face is the highly stylized man- nerisms of the eighteenth .century, but the players do a fine job in surmount- ing this ocstacle by sup!l:lementing the action with s.lap-sick. This 'slap- stick also complements the charac- terization because it underscores the folly of the people at the inn. To circumvent the problems of the theater in the round, Mr. Meriwether creates a kind of multiple stage ef- fect. The center of action on the stage is subtly shifted throughout the pro- duction and an illusion of many rooms is provided with a minimum of props. production. The burden o[ playing with backs to audience is by this stag- ing and by the constant movement of players during the performance great- ly relieved. The costuming was also effective. Against the comparatively bare stage, the colorful attire drew attention to the players without being ostentatious. The acting i:s the best I have seen at a Mountebank production. John Becket•man as the ranting cavalier, and Kent Kraft as the effeminate, co-wardly, and punctilious Marquis are splendid in their roles. Equally fine are Philip Rice as the supercilious Count, who stands calmly by, flaunting his money, and Jeff DeMunn as Fra- brizio, who must quietly endure the frustrations of his love. Anne Keith a's Mirandolinoa, the mistress, seems bland and stiff in her part, especially in her soliloquies; but perhaps she suffers from the contrast with Beck- erman and Kraft. By far the best performance comes from Gail Starr Blair as Deianira and Marge Feiner as Ortensia. They provide some of the funniest and most competently acted ·scenes in the production. 'I1he play is well-worth seeing. Wil- liam Meriwether has directed a comic and thought-provoking inte!rpre1Jation t01tal of sixteen undergradua,tes have participB:ted in these intercollegiate debates for Union, whose victims number Boston College, BridgepDrt, Colgate, Harvard, Suffo1f, Princeton, Cuyhoga, Wagner, and Hamilton. tournaments on the grouP's' schedule include trips to Colun1bia College, Mc- ·Gi-11, Rochester Instiltute of Tech- nology, and Cortland State.

Faculty Advisor Actiot:~ at Skidmore To the Editor: Last week's editorial dealt with the apparenty apathy of the Union College student. This prompted me tG conduct a bit of an investiwation, as to what is being dene to combat nega.tivism in colleges, in the area. Since I was going to Skidmore that night, I decided to ask questions around the campus concerning student activities in that conservative girls' college. I was lucky enough to meet two gids who were among the leaders ·of some college activities. Upon my asking of student action at Skid- more, I was overwhelmed at the amount of student organized programs! Taking out my pen and 5 by 3 nOite card, I proceeded to take notes because the list given me was so grealt. 11he girls have sponsored a successful tutorial plan for selected students from the Saratoga Junior High School. This The most influential ·daily newspapers in the country, is in co1'tjunction wtih •a pove1'ty pro- notably the New York Times, print hundreds of articles gram that is presently being conducted , l in the Saratoga Springs area. Recently each year about the news being made at the nation S co - the College held a panel discussion on Bad News leges. Thumb through the Times and you will see articles Viet Nam, the topic of which was \Are on curriculum reform, student :pol'ls of faculty, building Demonstrations and acts of Civil Dis- p rograms and a myriad of lesser items concerned with ·obedience Justifiable?\ Both members of d · y ·n t the sch!ool~s facu1ty and a member of changes and advances in higher e ucabon. ou WI no the Saratoga Conservwtive Party were find anything about Union. on .this panel. There has been no m~ntion in the major national press of our plant expansion - the biggest in our history; no Skidmore has an active Civil Liberties Committee. I spoke to some of its of- mention of our plans fol' a faculty evaluation at a time fleers, two vezy busy gids whose minds when reports of such sul'veys at other schools have been were full of interesting ploams for stu- treated in article after aFtic1e; no mention of our currie- dent action in town prol>lems. They ulum reform which is a truly exciting educational experi- ment; no mention of the plans for a community govern- ment which will potentially make a major contribution to fruitful student-faculty relations. All these shifts - some of them radical - going on at one of the nation's tEn best small men's colleges are significant and newsworthy. A paper like the Times would not responsibly ignore them. It must, however, forcibly be made aware that the changes are occurring, and the Public Relations office here has Jerformed pitifully in this respect. If Union has sent releases to the New York press about the college's programs, they have been ineffective. We have consistently failed to rep<>rt student activities in any form whatsoever. Concordiensis is now willing to take up the slack and send its own dispatches, but this should not be its job. The Public Relations office is excessively preoccupied with mail- ing inconsequential news, or with pushing athletic teams which are hardly reflections of a dynamic academic cli- mate at Union. Effective public relations is of momnumental impor- tance to any college. Tlle staff here - it now has two members - must be expanded and its outlook must change. The developments at Union are not insignificant, but the reporting of them has been severely inadequate. There is no excuse for blithley maintaining our silence when this college deserves to make the headlines. ''Class Government~~ There is no class government at Union College. Each year we elect four sets Q<f \officers but they have no of- fice to fill. The President of a class sits on the Student Council with those who ran specifically for the Council. He is invited to meetings of the All College Council and a few other random meetings. Othervvise, the function of the President hinges entirely on his personality. The Student Body Constitution states that class of- ficers should \promote and stimulate those activities which can best be organized a11d carried out on a class level.\ Such a job demands imagination and initiative without the prodding of proscribed responsibility. Most officers hardly fulfill such high aspirations. Apart from planning class weekends, most of them remain thoroughly inactive, and this week President Corrigan of the Sophomore class flouted even his constitutional responsibility to regularly attend Student Council Meetings. As a result, he has lost his Council seat - the only significant means he has for keeping in touch with the campus. This action has rendered him virtually useless to his class and his school. Along with nearly all other class ar~ sponsol'ing a food drive for Mis- sissippi and have just had a Negro speaker on Ameri\an politics come to one of their committee meetings. These girls have an active intere·st in politics. They have plans both for a debate on the question of China''S intervention in Viet N am and a <balk given by a guest member of Students for a Democratic Society. So there are things happening at Sar- atoga other than Sour-Hour! But Union College students are 'aware of only Sour- Hour and the plentitude of pretty girls. I a.sked the girls with whom I had spoken if they had made any efforts 1Jo involve our students in any of these activities. They replied thaJt they had sent several h~•tters to the college, and after a terrible response, they gave up. Men, are we .going to be part of the emasculated males of America? Are we going to show that our only interest in U.S. policy is a proposed rbax on the importation of liquors? If we are SQ u.nable to form groups D>f our own, why don't we have joint committees with Skidmore? Let's .get moving! Do we have \activists hiding in .the wood. work\ or have they left en masse for O'ilher schools where their ideas could meet with greater response? Mare Reubins '69 Tulloss .Replies To the Editor: At first glance, there is nothing to say in reply to Mr. Gvandin, but that i\ • I agreed that there is a need for dia- logue; but then I reflected that this is merely saying that bhere is a need for • ('Continue education which nobody in the business ~- ,. is going to deny. Seeing that the letter embodied this taubo'logy caused me to think again about my firSJt letter. As a result of this thought, I muS't say tllat , 11 it was nice to have agl'eement on the need; but bhe need remains unsatisfied. The mat opher sa-id attitudes i! My letter produced some obher re~ults which I think may be intere,sting to· the student body-as observations Qn the times in whioh they ar·e living. The opin-- ion that the student is just as ca;pf:l)ble as his instruebor to .decide a vie-w on ,, the Viet Nam situati<ln was often ex:- JJressed (indeed, it is implied by Mr. Grandin). This way very well be tr-ue; if it is, it gives the student credit for much more acumen than he is of'ten ' 1 credited with in situ-ations involving :face- to-face confrontation with administra- tion and :facul;ty. Very interesting. Th€ second i·nteresting ·opinion expressed '' was that the teacl1ers should not he expected to. be moral examples beca-use they were human beings wifu the righ!t to drink, gamble, commi•t violent cz1lnes, be pederasts, etc. Very s.tro.nge that wnen one mentions moroality, the listeners think fi1•st of violent crime and se)l. Is the demand for personal integrity such small p<>baboe·s? E'spe·cia1ly in a socioety where people demand the right to break o!Jher sections of the moral code? This is a question that demands considerable thought and action on the individu-al's part. • computer 1 nificant an decessor, · tion.

The Dumpster is an awesome garbage truck that picks up the big waste boxes behind most fraternities and dining halls and devours the contents with admirable strength and facility. General Electric is an easy place to work. All you need is brains, imagination, drive and a fairly rugged constitution. Anyone can see the trucks smashing through the cam- pus on their daily adventures in sanitation. But the patient. person, who is willing to wait long hours beside a brim- ming box until the Dumpster arrives, will be rewarded by one of the most dramatic performances of our age. The 1vurkiug::; uf thi::i :ll:JL:CLlcU.lu.l', yet t:umpa.ssionate mechanism defy our humble ability to describe - it must be seen. There is developing on campus a select clique of Dump- ster Watchers who trul:y appreciate the thrill of an in- spired garbage collection. We applaud these men, and hope that they will form the kernel for a new emergence of en- lightened activism on campus. It is doubtful that one can find a more provocative object of admiration than the Dempster Dumpster in the entire Capital District. Oh, yes. Something else that will help you at G.E is an understand- ing of the kind of world we live in, and the kind of world we will live in. There's a lot happening: The popubtion is continuing to explode. The strain on resources is becoming alarming. At a time when men are being lured by the mysteries of space, we're faced with the task of making life on earth more livable. There's a lot happening at G.E., too, as our people work in a hun- dred different areas to help solve the probkrns of a growing world: Supplying more (and cheaper) electricity with nuclear reactors. Controlling smog in our cities and 'ProgreS$ Is Our Mosf lmpoi'Nnf 'Pnxlud pollution in our streams. Providing better street lighting and faster transportation.

Friday, December 1,0, 1965 Letters To The Editor Action at Skidmore Tu the Editor: Last week's etlitorial dealt wiLh the appurenty apathy of t11e L'ni·on College student. Thi:; prompted me to conduct a bit of an investigation, as to what is lll'ing done to combat negativism in eoHeges, in the areH. Since I was going to Skidmore that night, I decided to ask queRtions uround the campus concerning studt>nt ac-tivities in that conservatiH• g-ids' wllege. I was lueky enoug-h to nwet two gir.Js who werp among tlw lead~1·s of ::;orne coHege activities. Upon my asking of student action at Skid- more, I \·as o\'Prwhe.Jmed at the amount of student organizNl programs! Taking out my pen and 5 by 3 note can!. I pmceet!L•d tu take notes bel'ause the list g·in:n llll' \\'as so great. The girl·s have sponsored a suceL•ssful tutorial plan for seleeted students from the Sm·atoga Juni<Jr High School. This is in conjunc:tion wtih a poverty pro- gram that i·s presently being conduc.ted in the Saratoga Spring;; area. RN·ently the C'olleg·e held a panel discussion on Viet :-\am, the topic of which was \Are Demonstl'tLtions and acts of Civil Dis- obedience Justifi·able ?\ Both meml>ers of the school's fa'C'.ulty and a member of the Sat·atoga Conservati n• Party wen• on this panel. are sponsol'ing- a food drive for Mis- ::>is,sippi and have just had a Negro ::>peaker on Americ-a-n politics co~ne to one of their committee meetings. These g-irl·s have an active interest in politics. They have J.>lans l>oth for a deba:te on the question of Chi·na's intervention in Viet Nam and a talk given by a g·uest momller of Students for a Democratic :-;oeiety. Su tlwre are things happening at Sar- atoga othl•r than Sour-Hour! But Union College students are aware of only Sour- Hour and the plentitude of p1·etty girls. I askPd ,the girls with 11·hom I had spokt>n if they had made any efforts to invol\'e our students in any of these a('tiYitie-s. They replied that they had :>L'nt several letters to .the college, and after a terrible response, they g·m·e up . 1\h·n, are Wt' guing to be part of the emast•ulated males of Ame.riea? Are we going tu show that otlr only interest in U.S. policy is a proposed tax on the impo1·tatio,n of liquors?

As a J'esult of this thought, I must say t:hat it was nice to have agree-ment on. the lll'L'd; but the need remains unsatisfied. :.\ly letter produced some other results whieh I thil·lk may be intere,sting to the student body- as obseJ•vations on the times ir.J whic-h they are living.

Very interesting. The second interesting opinil)n expressed was tl\at the teachers should not be expected to be moral examples because they were human beings with the right to drink, gamble, commit viDlent crimes, be pederasts, etc. Ve1·y strange that when one mentions mo1•ality, the listeners think first of violent crime and sex.

EASTERN AVENUE PIZZERIA 860 Eastern Ave. WE DELIVER PIZZA PHONE 393-0870 Time Out: Swinttners Will Face Harpur Tontorrow Two Days a Week • e \fol. 95 - The Union varsity swimmers will make their season debut tomor- row when they attempt to drown the Harpur College swimme1·s. The contest begins at 2 P.M. a.t the Foote Memorial pool. The meet with Harpur is the only Garnet ·swimming contest before the Christmas l'ecess. For Coach Robert Benson, for- mer ·star swimmer at University of Connecticut, the Harpur meet will be his first chance to see the Garnet mermen in intercollegitae ~·ction. Benson came to Union last spring as a replacement for Rob- ert Beaudry, who accepted a coaching post at Hamilton. Senior Captain, Dick !Siers, admitted Tuesday \I think we WOl'k a little harder under the new coach.\ Sophomore DICK CORRIGAN dives off the blocks ii1 a recent Garnet practice session. The swimers - varsity and i-ts ten contes-ts, 5-5. frosh - have been practicing Niue Meets since October on the weights with actual pool workouts beginning early in November. Since pool practice began, the team has been working on double sessions, averaging 2500 yards (about 1'12 miles) a swimmer each day. Squad Depth Both Ca·ptain Siers and Coach Benson boast of the depth of the squad which is supported hy sev- et·al able sophs. The great depth of the squad implies that there are at least two good swimers in each e\·ent which according to Benson, \will defini;tely aid us next year.\ Benson added that the strong- est spot on the team is in the events which he used to swim, the distance freestyle. Jim M-ogal, a junior, swims both the 200 and 500 yard freestyle and Benson has high hopes for him. Despite the depth of the squad, Siers noted that the team's weakspot was a lack of outstanding support in specific events. He added, though, that the team looks bet- ter than last year's which split There will be nine meets this season, seven of them in Febru- ary. Tomorrow's meet, and the one against Norwich here J·an- uary 8, will be the -only two be- fore then. Siers said he hopes for at least a 5-4 record. The captain indicaited that the biggest meets al'e with . RPI, Rochester, and Trinity. \Those three will tell the story about whether we win or lose.\ Siers is the strongest single returnee on the squad. He holds the school record in the 200 yd. backstroke set two years ag<> in the State finals. He was also part of a record-smashing 400-yard medley relay team two years ago ll!gainst RPI.

By Andy Colb After an intense study. of the physical education program~ at over fifty colleges and universities, Professor Wilfred Ketz _es-twbhshed, at Union College, what is formally known as \The Mamten-an<:e Pro- gram.\ This progra.:m was established four y~ars ago, arul: \Wall based upon the principles that students were bastcally hones~ th~t gyrp attendance of twice a week was not too great a tax _on tlie &tudent.s ·scholastic responsibilities, and that physical educatiOn -was a bas1c part of college education at Union. During the past few weeks, students have suddenly \becoJ?=le ~spe­ cially aware of the limitations of the program. Whetl1e1' this situa- tion was caused by the increasing;ly greater numbers of 'stu~ents enrolled in maintenance or by the madequacy of the pr<>g:raru Itself is difficult to assess. It is obvious, however, that when a student re- ceives a \loss of credit\ notice, hi's antipathy toward the program is impossible to restrain. Loss of Credit The recent flurry of notices, informing students of credit lost for failure to put their numbers on the sign-up sh~t, and! th!3 forced make-ups after severe illnesses were two such madeq11:ae1es that triggered student involvement and consternation. PrO>i:esso:r Ketz, however, has guaranteed that all credits lost for failure \to. sign one's number will be restored when the affected student apphes at. the physical education office. The apparent cause of the not_ices, acco;rd- ing to Ketz, was the ch~cker'S, who were overzealous 111 e?forcm~ the maintenance rules Ketz further affirmed that suggesti.<>ns for ,;his enforcement acti~n came neithex from himself nm the other coaches. The problem over student illness, unlike the diffic~ties over credit notices :has been a constant headache for the ath.let1e depart- ment. If the 1 department ,i!s too l.ax in granting_ c~·e~it for ,illness, then suddenly every-one is 111. On. the other hand, 1t IS 1mposs1ble for the athletic de-partment to question the authority and professional integrity of the health service. Therefore the problem l_Ia.s beep re- solved by simply requiring make-ups for all gym per:wd.s mis'sed, regardless of excuse. The recent rash of notices is perhaps an i~dication t.o ¥etz ~f the increasing lack of honesty on the part of Umon stucleJds I~ thetr maintenance participation. Seniors w_ho bowl at Boulev::ard ~gn up lor sophs and juniors. Names are s1gned for 4.:30 me.1ntenance at the field house, and their signers disappear becaus!\ tlie:y are not checked.

Ketz is convmced that students, 1f gtven the leew·:ay of five maintenances a week would refrain from attending \Dltil the last six weeks of school thereby creating an impossible booldceeping job for the athletic dep:irtment. A's it is now, the department must check off and register over 2000 signatures a week. To many students, the very fact that two maintenances a week are required is reason for contempt. In other courses, their \real\ education, they- are usually free to cut whenever they choose, with their own co.nscience and index as a guide. Famous Woolama /'7 Now Fully by .

DAVE'S- a;quir~ ~f!np Strict Program at Trinity Ketz, however, does not feel that the program is too de1na~d-ing. He cites the case of Trinity College where a student n1.11st swim 50 yards to graduate. Indeed, he acknowledges that the Union program 1s so lacking in i,ntensity that students, without punishnent, sleep or study while receiving athletic credit. Is this, Ketz asks, toe> rigid? After all the arguments fot· and against the mail1 tenance pro- gram have been expressed, the problem still remains: Is that pro- gram an effective me.thod for athletic training at Un~on . c.o!le!fe '! Maintenance is a relattvely young program here. Before Its m1t1at10n, physical education was purely on an scheduled-class ba.sis. :Perhaps classes are the solution. Perhaps purely voluntary student participa- tion is the solution. The maintenance program is on trial, not by scholastic administrators and deans, but by the students; Unfortun- ately the jw·y of the athletic department is packed in favor of the status quo. If th-ere is a fault in th0 program it will be difficult to change. If sudents rebel, stricter enforcement results. Those stu~ dents who benefit most from the program would prolJa.bly attend voluntarily. To pinpoint the exacl problem uf the maiatenance p_ru- gram is impossible. The physical education department is inakmg evety effQrt to have students partake in their program, even to the extent of not charging laundry fees (next year). Yet students, every day, find new ways to avoid their \responsibility.\ Llln<Jvation is sorely needed; but that innovation must come from both tbe athletic department and the students.

Since the poll was taken, members of the facul- ty and some students have attempted to create a campus issue concerning Vietnam. Petitions favoring :;nd opposing the Vietnam wm·, p<lsted in West College, all drew enthus.iastic fl'eshman reply. Several member of the Class of '69 posted individual open letters express- ing- their beliefs on American policy. Petitioons Circulated Faculty nHnn:.bers spearheaded the circulation of petitions -in the dormi- tories and fraternity houses. 'These petitions gene1:al)y expl'essed the con- viction that 2.11 1\\ho signed them be- lieved peaceful solutions to be best; even so, certain n-ise::; such as the one faced by the United States on South East Asia force an aggt·essive Amel'i- can policy. Professor Charles G. Gati hesitat- ing-ly supports the administration's policy. Although he woul<llike to wit- ness more interest in the American foreign policy, he would not like Union to experience \burn your draft card parties.\ Card Burners Professor Gati believes that draft card burnings represent a sincere pro- test as well as a political expression of Beatlemania. Professor Alfred L. Thimm added that he can respect ~Vlarxists but cannot tolerate \wishy- washy\ card burners who have no defi- nite policies. Instead of simply demonstrating, Pt·ofessor Gati advises the American student to investigate America's Vietnamese involvement from all view- points and support faculty student debates on this involvement. He be- lie\'es that most young Americans con- sider the battle in South East Asia unjust and for that t·eason they do not wish to become involved. Professor Joseph B. BQard stated ihat he wouM have preferred that the U'nited States had nevet· entered the struggle against the Viet Cong hut that communist aggression must be stopped. Even though he wants Amer- ica to rema'in in Vietnam until the N\ orth Vietnamese sue for peace, he questions whether the L\nited States has to supply the force to stop aggres- sion everywhere. Pl'ofessor Board cited India as one country which has effectively battled Chinese encroaeh- ments without a Unitect States man- power involvement. Profe·ssor Board insists that anyone should have the dght to dissent from national policy but nut by violence or a flouting of a law. Students at L\nion Council Approves Senior Weekend; Funds Will Aid Student Union Drive The Student Council has approved a motion fo1• a \Senior Weeken<i,\ over- riding objections raised by the Tax Committee. The tentative 1Veeke11d would occu1 on April lli or 2:l, and would be a benefit for the :purpose of raising money for and giving publicity to the [,uilding of a stu.dent union, accord- ing to Jack Seifer-t, Senior Class pre- ident. Mr. Seifert s:tated that a one-night Ponce1·t would be held in Memorial Chapel with t1\·o big-name entertain- ment groups, g-iving two slwws in one night. The pur}Jose of the double con- ceJ·t would be to increase the capacity of Memorial Chaj}el fl'Om 1200 to 2400 and thus cut tho€ eost of the entertain- me-nt. Seifer-t assumed that, in view of fraternity pa-rties, the students would go to the earlier concert and area residents would go te> the later concert. If the \\'eekend were to be held on April 16, it WQuld be in con- junction w1th a. Mountebanks produc- tion, a J.acrosse game and a symphony concert. He also stated that all such weekend plans 'Wii.l be dropped if suit- able talent can not be :procured. There was sDme question raised by membe1•s of the Student Tax Commit- tee as to whether tha. t committee would be able to covet- the \'Senior Weekend\ i\lE~IBERS of the Student Council, in various states of involvement, consider motionA on thl\ floor. budgeted $34,000 for the various stu- dent a.ctivities and that there was a total budget of $48,320 for all activi- ties, including those whkh did not re- ceive Student Tax Committee funds. the Student Council to adopt a Viet- namese war orphan, while 44 voted no. A third question asked, \If the Stu- Continued on Page 2, Col. 2 are free to react to Vietnam as they wish, and Professor Gati adde.d that \lack of reaction does not mean a lack of concet-n.\ After informally discussing Viet· nam w.ith other faculty members, Pro· f'essor Thimm has coneluded that \Vietnam is Au·stria, the Rhineland, and Spain in one.\ He predicts that ·•unless the United States draws a line there, we shall be faced with the possibility of a nuclear war within five years.\ He asks the students to consider China, a country ten tLmes as dangerous as Nazi Germany with ten times as many inhabitants. T:he Red Chinese hieral'chy is more sophisticated in its plans for world domination than either Nazi Gel'many or Soviet Rus- ;::ia. Without effective opp-osition, China, according to Professor 'Thimrn, will instigate repetitions of its \suc- cess story\ in the underdeveloped eountt·ies of the world and thus eeo- nomically impose its will on the Cnited States. In the future, Rightist reaction in the form of a more aggressive foreign policy will result from irresponsibility ~mch as card buming, so Professor Thimm has predicted. War Inevitability The Chinese government accepts the inevitability of war and opposes the r>ffort~ nf the enited Nations. Thes£> Chinese admissions are so blunt they are difficult to disregard, but Professor Thimm believes that many of the Berkeley students have substituted emotionalism .and slogans for the blunt facts. He stated that \appeasement leads to war.\ Robert Stolzherg, '67, P\ast president of the Young Democrats, pointed out that there is a \dichotomy between American ends and means: to achieve democracy we support non-democratic g-overnments. There is little doubt that the Vietnamese peasants would be bet- ter off under a Communist regime without Amerkan bombing. The point is that we are fighting for the entire non-communist world and that it is benefitted by our actions even though Vietnam itself is not.\ The Asian controversy may lift the veil from student activism at Union. Perhaps an action committee to spon- sor both right and left speakers on Vietnam, as proposed by Marc Reubins, '69, would lead to increased interest sho\vn by the Union student. Other campuses have already acted on this vital issue. Two student committees debate and sponsor forums regularly at Williams College. Alan Ziegler, '69, proposes a general campus committee which would support specific topic ~:ommittees to spur student interest. Social Rules Violations Issued In IFC Report The Judiciary Boat'd of the lFC has issued its first report in several years on violations of the social r·ules. Three infractio!l's have been announc- ed, and others are pending review by the administration. In past years the bulk of social rule enforcement ·was <lone by dormitory coulll:'elors and the campus police. This \\'as ineffective, h(}wever, according to Joe Shoenfelt, Chairman of the Com- mittee. The three c2.ses in the report is.sued this week involved disturbances at Kappa Alpha, Beta Theta Pi and Sigma Chi. They were all created by men from other fraternities who were unruly. Voluntary Checkers Thirty-two checket's, volunteers from each house, \vent to every party dur- ing Fall Weekend and Saturday, De- cember 3. Shoenfelt stated that the system would be revised in the future to alter the number of checkers and the frequency of investigations. He said that the volunteers were \~u_rprisingl~ level headed\ in recog- mzmg the Importance of the social rules for strengthening the fraternity system as a whole. He admitted, how- ever, that the rules are not easy to enforce. The number of violations which were recorded was a small frac- tion (}f the total committed. The cases announced were not con- cerned with the rules prohibiting wom- en from entering dormitory and fra- temity rooms. According to Shoenfelt, however, \two or three\ such infrac- ti(}ns are now before the board and the administration. detnanding. st swim 50 pr()gram sleep or rigid 7 <' if there was a loss.

College? initiation, Perhaps The Fre·shman Executive Council, which is composed of the class officers and five Student Council representa- tives, repotted the results of an opin- ion poll taken Tuesday. The poll pre- sented the question of whether \the Student Council, acting as an organi- zation representing Union College, should conduct a fund 1·aising drive and, with the funds collected, 'adopt' a Vietname'se war orphan.\ Community Government Ready For Faculty Vote One fraternity was found guilty of a violation of the rushing rules a:nd \·a:; warned against further infrac- tions. The nature of the infraction was not announced. Another house was fined $50 for holding a party without a permit Friday, December 3, and another was sent a warning let- ter for not having filed its party per- mtt before the deadline. Still another house .wa:s s.en~ a letter for \making excesstve n01se ' December 6 - noise that was excessive enough for the po- lice to have been called.

The proposai.s call for two general courses to be <lffe1·ed to all entering freshmen. The:v will present the stu- dent with a general view of the hu- manities and social sciences, in one course, and of the natural sciences in the other. The program in the humanities and social sciences 1vill attempt to com- bine \flexibilitY'\ in readings to repre- sent a numbet- ()-f dh;ciplines. There will, however, rema.in ·a common core of concern with '\modes of discourse\ in the language of the hum·anitie·s and social sciences. Scienc::e Course The projecte<l science course hopes to aid the stud. en t to \understand the nature of science as a human activity.\ The \feeling\ o-f the sciences, as meth- ods of decision: and as mean·s toward critical and skeptical thought about scientific know·ledge, will provide the foundation fo1· tbe course's new ap- proach. The Cl>'mpilation of factual in- fonnation will he avoided, while the :malytic faculties of the student will be more heavily emphasized. The two freshman courses will each take a term to complete under the term calendar which will also be in- troduced in September. They will run on a seminar basis, with about fifteen students in each section. If these proposals, which are con- tained in a forty-page report from the Committee on the Freshman Yeat·, are a!l\Pl'oved by the Faculty Council, they will be brought to the faculty for final consideration. The Council de- cision is expected after Christmas recess. The GuiTicular Affairs Comm·ittee has also received reports from each department on course program·s and changes for the new calendar. All courses offered at Union are under review in the departments, and all major programs will be restated. Dming the next month and a half, the Curricular Affairs Committee will compile the departmental reports and the reports on the freshman year, and will then offer a final draft of the new program which will take effect in the fall. The proposals for a community gov- ernment at \Cnion have been approved by the Studept Affairs Committee apd recommended for consideration by the Faculty Council. The committ.:e, headed by Prufessor Alfred Goble, made ·some minor re- visions in the plan which was de\·elop- ed by a Student Council panel and ad- justed by the All College Council two weeks ago. The Faculty Council will discuss the general plan. It is not yet certain, however, that a vote will be taken or that further revision will be made. If major . changes are made, the propos- als will be returned to the Student Affairs Committee for a second look. Revision Xeeded Immediately- after Christmas recess, the same p-lan will be placed before the Student Council and the Interfra- ternity Council for approval or revi_ sion. Ed Clark, who is steering the offerings of the Student Council Com- mittee on Community Government through the various campus bodies, stated that he is not looking for abso- lute approval on initial consideration. He stated that the basic ideas be- hind the new\ All College Council\ are sound· and generally accepted, but that \tailoring\ is needed and welcomed.

He said there has been no change in the number of actions brought before the board. Debating Team Scores Shutout The Philomathean Debating Society made its strongest showing of the year in the Rensselaer Invitational Debate Tournament, held last weekend at R.P.I. The team was led by H. Newell Bacon who was awarded the trophr as the best individual debater in the 10 school contest. In the foul; rounds of debate held, he was given perfect scores of thirty points in two of them, while scoring in the high twenties in his other two debates.

2 Concerts: Music Fills Memorial Chapel Renaissance Quartet Features Dufay By Dale Schneider Tuesday night the Renaissance Quar- tet presented a concert of music f:om the late Medeival through the Ehza- uethan period. The featured composer was Dufay with Anonymoas and other composers' 'representing England, Spain, and Italy. Although Robert White, the tenor was ill and several program t'han~es were necessary, the pieces. I?re- ,;ented kept the balance of the orJgtnal program. The main headings were: Italian Music of Dante's Time, Instru llll'ntal Dances of Italy and Spain, Music of Dufay, English Lute Songs, S)?anish Lute Solos, and Balt>tti of Claud1o and Giulio Monteverdi. The program called for several dif- ferent groupings of the ensemble and necessarily calle<i more attention to one :u-ti,st th~m another. Barbara Mueser gave a skillful ami sensitive performance on the viola da gamba which was over- shadowed, however, by the much more noticeable parts of the recorder, lute, and voice. This is perhaps also because the ea1· does not pay as much attention to the modern sound of the viola as it does to the unusual sound Qf the re- ~:order. l\1ouis Newman played several differ- ent recorders during the concert, reveal- ing a range of expression which many of us had not associated with that in- strument. Some of his parts, especially in the dances, seemed highly idiomatic to the rewrder. These parts he played Pxceptionully well. In Schenectady such an excellent performance -on this rare i nstrurnent is a welcome treat. Great Feeling Jean Hakes, who took Ro·bert White's place as vocalist for the evening, showed great feeling for this music. A former member of the New York Pro Musica, she fully understood the rhythm and :\li~s :\luesser preJ>ares fo1· her appear- ance at \'IPmorial Chapel on Tuesday l'VPnin~r. melody of these songs which can be ex- tremely difficult. Her hone~ty to the music exceeds JJOl'mal bounds. At one point she stopped a song and started ov,·r Lecause of a mistake which could alnw:>t a~ t>a,ily have been blossed over. Her \.'oier was so skill:fully controlled that ::>hl· nearly overcame the aeouf'tic prohiPm:-> nf :\femorial Cha,pe1. J osepl1 ladone was outstanding on the lute. Whether playing solo or in the en- semble his music was exactly right. To modern ears which are constantly pound ect by electric g11itars, this seems a very quit•!, restPained instrument. Rather than The Renaissance Quartet, from I. to r.: Barbara 1\Iuesser, viola da gamba; Morris Sewman, recorders; Jean Hake, soprano; Joseph Iodone, lute. state a stt·ing of harmonies, the l·ute out- lined tl1-em in a melody. ComlJ.ing thb melodic interest with rhythms sugges- tive .of flamenco, Mr. Iadone gave an absorbing performance of the Spanish lute sol'Os. Pearl1aps the highest praise that I can give this group is that thedr performance accomplished exoactly what it should have. A modern audience is far removed from the spirit which inspired this music and cannot always fully understand it, This conceit presented an artistically accurate and comprehensible outline of this age. Pieces in the concert reveal the various stages of many developing tradi- tions. Plain ,gong and modal rhythm are still represented, The roots of madrigal, bel canto, flamenco, ,and purely instru- mental music rure a.pparent. By showing how these pieces are related to the main- streams ()f western music, the Renais- sance Quartet made each piece come u~ive for us. Student Council Continued from Page 1, CoL 3 dent Counci:l decides that it should not involve itself with such an activity, do you think that the Freshman Class should do it?\ Ninety Freshmen vot- ed yes, while 83 voted no. The poll also asked for suggestions regarding methods for fund raising, and fo1· i<leas for other possible activi- ties of the Stu1lent Council. The Student Council adopted Bob Dickman's proposal for the creation of a Student's Committee on Athletic. This committee, which would be corn- posed of members of all classes, would unite the efforts of students in bring- ing suggestions to the attention of the Physical Education Department. Jlono)>oly Tournament? AI Starr announced that the Politi- cal Science Department would hold in the near f11ture a student-faculty monopoly tournament in Nott MemOI'- ial, for the purpose of creating a mo- nopoly team. Student Orchestra Plays at Union As usual, Union students missed a chance to enjoy themselves last Monday. This time it was the first concert of the Northeastern New York Student Orchesbra. There was no doubt in the music, the sound was big; it filled the Chapel and even drew in people passing by outside. The orchestra, made up <>[ high school and college ·students from the Capital District, did not hold back when they played their folk tunes, but there was no sloppiness in those pel'formances. Exuberance In the first three items-two old Dutch tunes by Valerius, a Spanish-like Valdres March by Hanssen, and two Cherokee folk tunes put on paper by Kilpatl'ick-there was an exuberance that was also kept in fine tune and time. T·he 'two 17th century Dutch tunes gave the string section a chance to show a unity and a surprising richness that was well carried by the auditirium's acoutics, and Hanssen's March pre- sented a .bright, exact tone from the high winds. The two lndia,.n tunes, Cherokee Glory and Bear, Bear, Rabbit, showed that the whole orchestra was a good balance. The orchestra was at its best in the happier music, and did not seem quite as sure of themselves in the more formal music; the Caprio! Suite for Strings Ly Warlock and the Overture from Die Meistersinger by Wagner. But if the first pal't of their de•but was an indica- tion of the quality of the players, Union should be proud to be host to these people. ¥ t T 'T T T TT...,........... f Y f' ¥ T Y f ¥ i T f ;J 'l Y T T \'f t ¥ 'V' 'Y t T W f f f f f f 9 T t V + DEWITT'S FERRO Ti111e CEnlel' PHARMACY JewEiel's Cafeteria and Tap Room 575 Nott Street Schenectady, N.

Sometimes, Hawkes conveys a nightmare atmos- phere. When Rencher, up to this point one of the m~in characters in the plot, is suddenly kicked to death by a horse, the unrea·son·able- ness and calm brutality of the matter is terrifying. The central character of the no¥el, Michael Banks, is a mystifying c flgme. The whole pattern of his actions has a curious illogicality.

Holyoke Student Government Association has announced that it will sponsor evening bus transportation to Amherst College in co-ordination with that school and Smith College. It was originally planned with the co-operatiDn of the Univet•sity of Massachusetts, but it dropped out. The SGA circulated a questionnaire to determine the need for this service. The respondents wet·e asked the frequency of their present weekday travels i;o Am- herst and what they expected their to be frequency if the bus service were in·sti- tuted. The results show that many girls would be affected. Whereas now, only 23 girls indicated that they go to Amherst at least every-othet· week. Seventy-five g·irls expect to go there that often with . ( A GLASS JAW? • II • • ~ t ( , { .{' By Richard Sifton The Johnson administration has l1ad rem~rkably good luck in ge·tting its many programs accepted. The past year has seen ·a steady strea1n of major legislation drift unobstrllded through Congress with few excep- tions. Such a situation is dangerous, for it lulls the ·public into a falsely secure, uncritical, and apathetic stance toward government activity. Fortumitely, the feverish enthusiasm surrounding the \Great Society\ l1as subsided, thanks to a devoted and badly maligned public servant, Wil- liam McChesney Martin. Not only has Martin been instrumental in the now- famous rise in the Federal Reserve rediscount rate, but he has been the unofficial spokesman against Johnson's \jawbone\ techniques in dealing with business. Both areas de- serve extensive analysis. Competition Intense major fi.nancial institutions almost helpless in their attempts to create new markets and to expand old ones, forcing a giant like Chase Manhat- tan to rejeot its state charter and to obtain listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Yields on new bond offerings are exceptionally high, the highe&t since World War II in some cases, which is another indioation of the intensity of competition for investment funds. So the discount rate was raised, an aC'tion which will m>t, according to the Federal Reserve, diminish either thr demand or the supply of money. The banks may now offer up to 5% per cent on time (savings) deposits, which places them in a more favorable position to O<btain funds- and it i-s the banks which badly need those funds to increase their loans, and hence the m•oney supply, through a process known as \deposit crea- tion.\ Why all the fuss? Stop With Propaganda Reserve action to correct the deterior- ating credit situation, either quanti- tatively or qualitatively. Hence. the whole issue C()Uld have .been buried in a flurry of cockeyed optimism and the Fed couldn't have dared to defy the faith which the Ame1·ican people have placed in their honest, miracle worker of a P1•esident. Aluminum Industry Critical tet·ials. I for one find it impossible. \Guidelines\ Ignored Tl1e administration has set up \guidelines\ regarding wage and cost in.creases; 3.2 per cent is the official annual wage increase which would be healthy accordill'g to non-inflation- ary policies. Yet most settlements, notably those of steel and auto workers, have run 'SUbstantially over 4 per cent in the past year; Johnson :has not saJ.d ooe word djecidedly against such flagrantly excessive in- creases. Hence, co·rporations can really do only two things: either ubsorb tile entire increase in produc- tion cctsts, or raise prices. If they do the fo~mer, they are neglecting the interests and rights of their stock- holders. If they do the latter, Presi- dent Johnson would :have us believe that they are precipitating w.idespread inflation in a thoroughly irresponsible fashion. There is a third altel·native- they can borrow money in order to obtain more equipment that will pro- vide greater automation and increased productivity. The unions would almost allow that, as the dock workers, rail- road firemen, and newspaper type- set-ters have amply demonstrated. Excessive Consumer Dernand time man is just beginning to see his inner needs; men are turning towards a new goal: debauch! It is more l'eal, more honest, and besides it's easier and more fun. Anyone want seconds·?\ the bus. The category of girls who never take weekday trips to Amherst declined in the sample from 1G7 to 25. The figures show the need for the bus. This system would probably be appli- cable to the 'Union-Skidmore situation. Already, there is increasing interest in joint activitie'S between the two colleges. 'The Jliioving Finger' twice has invited the co-eds to its meetings. The Inter- national Relations Club has had several activities with the equivalent group. If C'nion and Skidmore were to make h'anc- portation more readily available to stu- dents, it is likely that this trend would be strengthened, to the benent of both campuses. ROBERT STOLZBERG. inflation-but it is not inflation caused by artificially higher prices. It is ca·Ised, rather, by a labor shortage in skilled, basic industries and a subsequent shortage of major hou'Se- hold items, particularly furniture and color television, which are in great demand. Corporations must build new factm·ies, purchase new capital goods, and seek more skilled labor in order to keep pace with riosing demand. As they must borrow the money with which they do these things, we soon return to the problem with which we started: too high a demand for too little mones, with banks caught in the middle. The situation is worsened l>y an administration which encour- ages exorbitant wage settlements but refuses to allow busines•s to increase revenue through selective pl'ice in- creases. Interference Backfiring ___ __,, • Undeniably, the quality of credit in th<is country has been deteriorating steadily. The action taken this year by Moody's against hOI!;h New Yorl{ Sbate and New York City, lowering the credit ra.ting in both ca,ses, must be taken as a good indi-cation o:f a widespread condition, reg~ardless of all the inane political flapdoodle which our leading demagogues offer in de- fense of their \spend now, to hell with !alter\ policies. There is .too rnuch demand for too little money; restl'ic demand for too little money; restric- Presumably, the Federal Reserve's timing was bad. It should have waited. For what? Until all the rosy, end-of-the-year economic reports had been released, convincing the public that ours is the safest, the best, the fastest growing economy around. Aside from the fact that the aoove descriptives are false anyway, suc·h pmpaganda could hrave been used, by Johnson, probably with success, to stall still further any Federal Which brings us to the \jawbone\ technique. The aluminum industry has a long, well documented record of low returns on invested capital, ra:pidly rising labor and material costs, and a 'too slow rise in produc- tivity relative to those ·cost increases. So industry leaders thought it would be advisable to raise a few selected prices a little. All of a sudden, by pure coincidence (so we are told), McNamara wants tto dump 200,000 tons of aluminum on the open market from government stockpiles. The price rise is cancelled, 'and pretty soon the government is increaSing its stoclQpiles by 300,000 tons. The ad- ministration declared it to be against the war effort for the industcy to raise prices; but since the govern- ment already owns the equivalent of a full year's output of aluminum, and since it would have no business dumping itt on the open ma.:rket if it needed it so badly for the war effort, we might find it difficult to understand how a price 1•i.se could affect the procurement of war ma- But the whole prorblem will soon be resolved. The American consumer, thanks to .our benevolent administra- tion, now has so much money and wants ·so many items that his de- mand cannot be satisfied. There is The Johnson administration has in- terfered repeatedly wilth the free enterprise struCiture. The fruits of such interference are being felt now. Even if the Federal Reserve's actions do not achieve the desired result of dampening the current, unrestrained spending spree in which all sectors of the economy are bo·th participants and victims, it will at least assure business and the .banking industry that they are not solely at the mercy of \jawbone\ politics applied in a most furtive and discriminating man- ner, • t; 1.00 ., '.fi A ' L.

Good students who may be capable of fair work in all courses are frequently confronted by several exams bunched so closely together that adequate study for each is impossible. The criteria for the final grade in such an instance is no longer how well one may study, but how fast. A student's ability to stay up all night and still be coherent the next day is a test of endurance, not knowledge. Professors at Union expend considerable effort construct-- ing exams that will reflect comprehension of course con- tent, but their work is negated when grueling schedules force luckless students to either sacrifice a less favored course, or build up enough nervous intensity to attempt preparation in everything. Calm and effective studying can best be done when exams are evenly distributed over the entire period. This, of course, would be an impossibility for everyone, using the present method, but rescheduling the exams of indi- viduals with particularly imbalanced programs would be a feasible way of reducing their disadvantage. If, for ex- ample, three finals fall within two days, one could be moved to an earlier date with little inconvenience and some de- partmental trust in the student's honesty. An extension of such an honor system would be the scheduling of exams by the student himself to effect the · best possible plan of study. Such an arrangement would make an honor code functional. It would give the student a reward of study time in return for keeping test questions to himself, while still providing him with a symbol of en- hanced maturity and freedom. A system of this sort would be long in perfecting, but it could eventually reinstate academic achievement, not simply the good grade, as the major objective of students at Union. The Petitions The circulation of numerous petitions on Vietnam by students and faculty last week is a comforting affirmation that Union is alive, aware and willing to join in the debate which is stirring the nation. Commitment and leadership on the part of the faculty is an especially sanguine indicator that we are hardly out of touch with reality here. Persistent questioning and the initiation of discussion and debate on living issues is a re- sponsibility of the educator to his students. The role of the concerned intellectual in exposing uneasiness and conten- tion in the informed population is, likewise, essential for the development of ideologically sound as well as practi- cally expedient government policy. College professors are now clearly involved in the effort to inspire a healthy dialog on our policy in Vietnam. They are signing their names, actively participating in teach-ins, writing articles, and generally serving to cry- stallize public opinion. They are becoming the \touch- stones,\ as Rod Tulloss put it, for student activism, giving direction to frequently aimless protest. The faculty at Union could well advance its position as a provocative force in student thought by actively par- ticipating in debates, written and spoken, which will aim at clarifying the issues and stimulating both contempla- tion and animation.

It does not take a great deal ()f imagination to buy a snake; the job of upholding and expanding Union's deserved repu- tation demands a great deal of work, undivided attention, and sober dedication.

Many of the activities of class governments receive little or no publicity, ·but are essential for the smooth functioning- of ~tudent affairs at Union.

The many electric motors in those offices needed lubrication at least once a year. Heat from the motors dried up the bearing oils, thus entailing costly annual maintenance. To stamp out this problem, many tests were conducted at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Lubricant engi- neer George H. Kitchen decided ()Ut to ruin some ball bearings by smearing them with an icky guck called molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Swock! This solid lubricant, used a certain way, actually increased the life expectancy of the ball bearings by a factor of ten! Now the motors can run for at least a decade without lubrication.
