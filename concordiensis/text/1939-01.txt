If: weather will not merit his staying m·er the weeltend, the Schenectady '-ii inter Sports Club will join the Outing Club in its dinner on Fri- da:.y. David Yunich '39, president of the Student Council and delegate to the five day Folllteenth Annual Congress of the National Student Federation of America held at Pur- due University during the vacation, acted. as chairman of the men's college division of the conference. In that capacity he was able to achieve the passage of what is known as the Union plan of ob- taining orchestras for coHege func- tions. A small charge will be made to def1·ay expenses at the illustrated lecture. Any proceeds will be used to- l:rnp-rove the Union College Out- ing Club at N <Jrth Creek. Tickets fD>r the lecture are available tnroug-h any member of the outing d <tl> at the various fraternity houses and in the dormitories. While in this area, Mr. Schniebs will also give ski instruction on Saturday and Sunday, January 14 and 15, under the auspices of the S<:henectady Wintersports Club. ---0 Unie>n Holds Radio Debate at Vermont Debating on the subject, Re- so:ved : That the United States sl10 uld cease to use public funds for purposes of stimulating busi- ness, the Union Debating Te.am c>Ompeted with debators from the Univn·slty of Vermont Saturday ltig-ht in Burlington. The contest, il!l which Union upheld the affirma- tive side, was broadcast over radio station ·WCAX of Burlington. There vvJs no decision. ;::'ernard Krause '39 and Robert Furman '40, spoke for Union a:.goinst Eernard Lisman and Wal~ t er Glms of Vermont. The Vermont orators are state champions of Verrrwnt and have been so for the p3st two years. Yunich also announced that the spring conference of the regional group of the association, which in- eludea the colleges of the Atlantic seaboard, may possibly be held at Union. The Union plan of obtaining na.me bands for college functions is an attempt to do· so at lower prices than is possible now. A committee is working out the details of an organization which will make for cooperative purcha.sing of the .facil- ities of these orchestras, send ba.nds on tour, and coordinate the dates of functions at the various colleges. Reiit>f Effot·ts Known Yunich said that one of the most gratifying features of the conven- tion was that Union was very well knuwn, in particular because of the recent discussions on aiding the refugees of persecution in Ger- many. This cau:se was further ad- vanced at the meetings of the asso- ciation. Another important achievement of the sessions was a change of organization so that the delegates to the conference next year will be members of the junior cla.sscs in their respective colleges. It was thought that this will result in more benefits accruing to the col- leges sending them as their experi- ence will be of value for an added year of their attendance at school. Yunich also declared the conven- tion was a huge success in that the discussions were of great value, that much was actually accom- plished in planning programs and s·olving problems, and that the delega.tes were exceptionally capa- ble and deep thinlters. The chairmanship which Yunich held placed upon him the responsi- bilrty for assigning the chairm~n of the various discussion groups m the men's college division of the cun fer·ence. ------o--- Herrick Undergoes Operatio11 David Yunich '39, president of the Student Council and also of bhe S·tudent Body, re- ceived n.:ational' recognition as an outst.anding student when the Kap'·Pa Nu fraternity, of which he is a member, award- ed him t.he President's Cup, at the convention of the frater- nity held in New York City from De-<:eml;>er 28 through 31.

Legislature Topic OfT ow:n Meeting Sena.tcor, Assemblyman Discus-s Possible Pro<.:Jram Proposals Sunday, Jan. 8.-What should be the program for the 1939 .State Legislatm·e, was the topic of the weekly Sche·nectady \Town Meet- ing of tlie Air\ held ~his afternoon in the 01 d Chapel. State Senator Thomas C: Desmond of Newburgh and Professor Emerson D. Flte of Vassat· t::!ollege, Dutchees County Assemblyzma:n, were introduced by Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox as the prin- ciple spea.lters. Both Senator Desmond and Prp- fessor Fite agreed on the chief problems, as presented by the for- mer, whi-<:h included. \slum clear- ance and. low-cost housing; finan- cing of relief; unemp!oyment in- surance: highway safety; and civil service.\ Motor Vehicles Salety ium. Lat·ge Attendance Deslrecl The Student Council hopes for as near hundred per cent attendance of the two groups as possible. It is remembered, with no little re- gret, that at the time of t.he ·last Idol paint scrap 16 sophonr~Hes as compared with two hundred some odd fres.hmen appea·red. Ideal weather for the battlE.

Barney, Noted Educator, Dies Leaving $10 .. 000 To Union Col.lege Was Connected With Union Over Fifty Years As Undergraduate, Alumnus, and Life Trustee Dr. Edv•.ral'd S. Barney, life trustee of Union College and noted educator, died at his home in Brooklyn on the night of December 25. D1·. Barney, who had been connected with this college for over 50 years, di.ed at the age of 77 afte1· a very short illness, for he had attended the New York Alumni din- nel' on December 8. In his will, he bequeathed the college Wednesday, Feb. 12.-In its regu- lar monthly meeting, the Publica- tions Board today proposed that the by-laws of the Board be amended so a..s te change the dates of election of members to positions un undergraduate publications. the .sum of $10,000. ----------------<!> President Dixon Ryan Fox said, \/he! eas no definite step,; were taken on this matter, a motion was made and tabled that the by-laws be changed su that elections for The Concordiensis be held at the regular March meeting of the Board, and the Idol and Freshman Record elections have been made at the May meeting. Discuss Progi'li.IllS The Board discussed the Union Gridiron, the football program magazine which is sold at all home grid contests. After several at- tempts to make this a student pub- lication had failed in 1933, the edit- ing of this program ;vas a.ssigned to Milton M. Enzer, ':!9, who still edits and manages it. Dr. Harold A. Larrabee suggested that as the publication is a potential source of revenue that an accounting of its business during the year be made hereafter. The selling of The Concordiensis at football games was sanctioned by the Board, which also suggested that basketball line-ups be included so that the paper might also be sold at home basketball games. Progress on Ga,rnel. Ernest C. Allnutt, '40, editor of the Garnet, reported that advertis- ing was being solicited for the year- book, and that pictures are now being taken and engravings being made for that publication. He an- nounced that Harry Crosby, Clar- ence McKain, Robert Herman, Harry House, and Donald Haigh were the candidates for editorial poaitions, and that the business staff candidates were Robert Ull- man, Donald Collins, and Arthur Davis. The second issue of the Idol, Edi- tor Lon Barringer, '3S, reported, will be distributed on January 31. Library Clock Makes Students Late to Class The students who have been concerm:.d about the large piece of paper which has been placed over the library clock, may set their minds at ease. For some lime the clock has been losing time, so in order to keep the students from being late to classes, it was covered up. Had it been fast, the librarian stated, they would not have wortied, because they knew that no one would go to classes too early. The cloclt has now been returned to the factory to be repaired. Following the same train of thought a bit further, we infer that until it is re- turned, the students will not go to class at all. Underclassmen Begin Class War Tomorrow The first 1n a series of contests between the freshman and sopho- more class will begin tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock. when the two classes vie for honor-;; in a swimming meet to be held in the gymnasium. Because weather does not permit, the long awaited tug- of-war is called off for the pres- ent, said Louis Carr, '40, chairman of the committee. The swimming meet will include the 50, 100 and 200 yard free-style dashes, 100 yard breast stroke, 100 yard back strolte, 200 yard free- style relay, and a 75 yard medley relay. Mr. Wilford H. Ketz, assist- ant professor of physical education, will act as starter. \Had Edgar Barney made no other contribution to public life, his pro- longed and many sided service to Union College would alone make him well-remembered in this state. Shortly after his graduation in 188·1, he was the founder of the New York City Alumni Association of the college and later was its secretary for 18 years. As an alum- nus trustee from 18S7 to 1901, as life trustee from 1S06 and secre- tary of the board since 1909, he il- lustrated what a devoted and in- telligent trustee can be. He attend- ed to college affairs as if he had no other concerns in the world and in all deliberations his course was widely benevolent; few men could see as clearly all sides of a ques- tion and :yet arrive at a well rea- soned judgment. His presence was always an inspiration and he gladly attended almost every commence- ment and New York alumni din- ner. That he did many useful things we know and the college takes pride in his achievements but we will always feel a deep and lasting gratitude for what he has done for Union College.\ Earned College Expenses While in college Dr. Barney \worked his way through\ by tak- ing tickets on the Hudson River Day Line. After graduation he con- tinued his· work on that line, in be- tween his teaching jobs, and soon rose to the position of general pas- senger agent, which he kept until his death. Dr. Barney has placed his mark on American history with his work in education as principal of the He- brew Technical Institute which he served for 41 years. He began his work as an educator in the Gra- mercy Pal'k School and three years later left to be an instructor in the Hebrew School where he remained (Continued on Page 4) ---01---- I Q Tests Scored By Psychologist high school ski clubs, and the Sco- many faculty members, the speak- therefore me abolished? · h' h h ·1 1 · 1 b a e cooper ers discussed the contributing fac- tla 1g sc oo s u c u r - \Is is true that 'a job is the right · · · the lecture by tors \before and after the war, atmg m sponsormg of every American?' Another matter considered by the Board was the possibility of secur- ing a mail box for th.e use of the publications. In view of the fact that frequently engravings cannot be located, a proposal was also made that the Alumni Office main- tain a central file for engravings used by each publication, and that this file be accessible to members of any publication. The Student Council, which is sponsoring these contests, hopes for a large show of interest in the part of both classes in order to re- vive class 1·ivalry. SuggestiQn;; have already been made for a baseball game and a track meet to be held in the spring. All the members of the freshman and sophomore classes are invited to participate irt this swimming me.et, and everyone Interested is asl~ed to attend.

Duane Squires of Colby Junior College, speaking in daily chapel yesterday. Citing in- stances in history-, he showed that times ·have been much worse than they are at the present time, and recalled that on their exodus from the Garden of Eden, Adam told Eve that they were living in an age of transition. The condition of the -German peo- ple at the present time, Dr. Squire said, is probably no worse than it was at the time of the 30 Years' War some 300 years ago. He added that although we consider our na- tional debt tremendous, that of England after the Napoleanic Wars was considered fatal to the coun- try. He cited Red Cross and Tu- berculosis stamp subscriptions, and the New York City 100 Neediest Cases as encouraging examples in the future outlook for youth. \Af3 the medical profession is certain than cancer and the com\ mon cold will be cured, so, Dr. Squire concluded, we should have confidence that our problems will be solved, even though not in this generation:'' Dr. Squires, taking for his topic, \The Roots of Present Fruits,\ the unemployed and with the least burden on the citizens taxed? stated that his purpose was \to f \Is 1s not better to pay unem- try and discuss certain phases o the life in Europe 'before the war,\ played persons a 'dole' rather than and to include a discussion of \the give them jobs for which they are unfitted? key state of Europe in 1939 • Ger- \Do the WP A projects destroy in- many.\ centive to find private unernploy- Hitler Not Original ment?

Old clippings are destroyed unless requested, as they some- times are, by student collectors. Diagramed football plays and a series of features on Harvard's \suppressed minorities\ movement have been among the bulletin's board's more popular items during this semester.

The psychologist further advised \Listen to your mind.\ He de- plored the condition of forcing in· tellectual effort, stating .that the best work that a person can pos- sibly produce is that which pours forth naturally. He supported this claim by bringing up several ex- amples of unusual work by rela- tively average children and com- paring these examples with the in• ability of any adult to produce any- thing at all comparable. He attrib- uted this fact to the fact that the adult has, through various phobias and complexes, \Lost contact with himself\ and no longer has the ability to let hls mind work natur- ally. The average adult has at least ten times more ability than he actually uses, he stated.

Dr. Edgar S. Barney, '84, who died recently was one of our most famous and devoted alumni, and his ·work in behalf of his alma mate1· will long endear him to all true Uni.on men. That he thought a great deal of \the college on the hill\ is shown not only by his devotion to his 'vork as life trustee, founde1· of the New York Alumni Association, and attendance at many commencement exercises; but because he thought enough of Union to bequeath it a considerable sum of money in his will.

This is as it should be, for most of these activ- ities pay no salaries whatsoever, and the emoluments paid by those activities which do reward their members wi·th salaries can· not, in a strict material sense, begin to 11ecompense these men for their several years of faithful service to the activity. We do believe, however, that a system of unified keys should be adopted. As it is now, the Glee Club awards one type of key, the Band another, The Mountebanks reward their players with a different type, the Con- cordiensis key is of still another variety, and so it g-oes. It is rare when members of one activity are able to identify the keys of another activit;.·. If this is the case with undergraduates, it is not likely that alumni will be able to recognize these keys from those of another college. Columbia has solved this problem in a very effective manner: at that institution, the keys for all non-athletic activities are essentially the same-i. e., a king's crmvn. Each activity, however, has a different sym- bolic inset which is attached to this key. Thus the keys at Columbia are easily iden- tified as Columbia keys by all, and even a hasty glance at tlw inRet will readily identify the activity for which the key was awarded.

Assigning players to fixed floor areas is an outmoded type of defense. Rather, the defensive men rJlay areas of the court in which there is an offensive threat. These areas change as the offensive threat changes. This movement of defen- sive play is usually called the slid- ing zone.

Rightful Winners of Radio Tussle \We wuz robbed\ shouted Jerry Smith and John Schultz in unison, referring to the \Qu-iclc-Quiz\ ra- dio program, in which two R.P.I. students supposedly licked the Union oracles in a. battl.e of wits, broadcast over WHAZ C»n :Monday night-and apparently the record books substantiate the U\nion sport sages' contention of lare:eny. Upon returning, th:e Union lumi- naries went into a. huddle with Bill Ketz, custodian of sports rec- ords, and discovered that the 5 to 1 response had been .correct. As this correct an:swm· adds 100 points to Union's total of 535, the local lads should be halle<i as vic- tors, compared to R.P.I.'s but 605 points. F R E.

Outing Club Skis At Gore Mountain Nine Outing Club members slip- ped and slid about the icy ski trails of Gore Mountain, this weekend, and filled in their spare time by square dancing in. a neighboring town. After leaving the campus early Saturday aifternoon, skiing was be- gun as soon as they arrived at North Creek. After supper some of the less ambitious went to bed, leaving the rest to go to the square- dance. On Sunday, the club started an early ski fest on the Gore Mt. trails, including, Pete Gay, Half- brook, Cloud, and Rabbit Pond. The trails were reported in good condition, although they were rather icy and the snow was melt- ing a little. Those who went un the trip were: Donald Field, '42; .Tames Young., '42; .John A. Poo1e, '42; John C. Bass, '42; Harold Fletcher, '42; Bill Kreusi, '42; Garry Fuller, '41; John N. Gardiner, '41; and Sheldon Evans, \40.

This is fo.Jlowed up a week later with a letter ex:plaining the fine and these have also been laid aside by the students and. forgotten. \It's a pure waste of effort on our part to have to get the books ba:clt, except that they must be gotten back, and it's also a pure waste of money on the part of the students to be neglect- ful in returning the •books\ Mr. Webb explained. \The reason for the fines is due entirely to care- lessness ·on the part of the borrow- ers.11 Two Speakers Discuss Reduction Of WP A Allotment Both Defend Purposes But Censure Methods Of lts Administration :l>rought before the Student Council meeting Wednesday night is the question of the continuance of the :Block \U\ Dinner.

The entire interior shall be re-a:ltered with the exception of Dr. John March's classroom and all space .beyond his room is to- com- PI ise a new college bookstor-e. Neoo for More Space With the present bookstore al- r·.eady cramped for space and the anticipation of a future need for addrtional space for administrative offices, the new plans serve a two fold purpose. If weather conditions are fa vm ab: e the wo1 k may ·be com- pleted in time to move the ·book- store and supplies to Washburn Hall during spring vacation. The new location provides a host of advantages over the present site. Additional space is the chief im- provem.ent, especially in regard to the supply J oom. At present, both the attic and cellar of the Admin- istration building are being used to store t:he material for sale at the bookstore. The new arrangement pr·ovides for a supply room ·between Dr .. March's room and the store it- self. A door is to be made from one of the present windows to facilitate unloading of the supplies, but other- wise there will be no exterior alter- ations. More Advantageous Loca.tion Besides additional space, the new store will be much lighter and more centrally located than the present one. A. definite aid to the Admin- istration building is anticipated when the change is made in regards to confusion and space during r·egis- tration and throughout the year. No definite plans have been made for a redecoration of the old bookstore, nor as to what use will be made of the space. The interior arrangements of the new bookstore have been decided upon and work will be begun as soon a.s weather permits. The west and south walls will contain built In bookcases for merchandise. Since the new location will provide twice the floor space and one and one- half times as much wall space, an additional showcase will be pm- chased to be placed with the others a few feet from the west and soulh walls.

It will be similar to the Prize Day hour in the as- sembly, when students are required to attend, and members of the fac- ulty are also present. The change was urged in the re- port of t.he committee, headed by William Thomas, '39, which was investigating the matter. This change was advocated because of the lack of student support in the past and the poor facilities for serving meals in the gymnasium. The Councll also approved the plan, which h!'.d previously been proposed, of taxing the undergrad- uates one dollar a year, for which they will receive the Alumni Monthly after graduation for as many years as they have paid. It was .not decided, however, w·hether the tax should be added to the tui- tion amount or to the Student Tax. Special provisions are also to be worked out for· the students al- ready iri .college.

The subject of Dr. Blodgett's lecture will be \The Use of Interference to Extinguish the Reflection of Light from Glass,\ a subject to which she has devoted her attention for some years and which has received extensive pub- licity since January 2. Some statistics gleaned from a study of New York State high schools showed that the high school teachet·, in cities of over 100,000 population, had an average income of $2,500. In contrast to this, professional men in the field of law could boast of only $1,200 as a median income.

Mr. ~1arshall said that such a pxogram would pmve cheaper than the cost for policing those youth.s who become so demorilized th10ugh loss of employment as to become socially undesirable. He estimated that about five and a quarter mil- lion dollars wil! be required .to b1 ing about the high school exten- sion.

Compares Salaries In his address, Dr. Fox .first at- tempted to prove that the salaries paid to secondary school teachers compared favorably to those se- cured in other professions such as law and medicine. \The first ques- tion,\ said Dr. Fox, \that the pro- posed fifth year presents is as to whether it is a fair economic in- vestment to exact in the light of future income. One reply would be to raise the salary level and thus make sure; but let us look upon it as it is, and the view, of course, must be comparative with o>ther income levels. Some time ago when I was talking with a leading educationist in England,\ he remarlted, 'The reason why you have few men in your schools and we have many is because you pay them poorly and we pay them well.' I asked h1m what the good man teacher could expect in England, and he answered that many got as much as £400 per- annum. Now, such a salary is not at all excep- tional in the United States, and the cost of livtng does not differ much from that in England.\ Speaking further on the eco- nomic side of the question, Dr. Fox declared: \I am strongly for higher salaries for teachers and. for filling the ranks with those who are worth them. I want no short- sighted tax-payers to cite me to the contrary. The only point I make here is that high-school teaching is a much better paying (Continued on Page 4) Tax Committee Grants $87.85 to '39 Garnet In its meeting on Friday, Jan- uary 20, the Tax Committee voted to grant the Garnet $87.85 out of the Committee's Surplus Fund.

January 31, 1939 A LETTER TO THE ADMINISTRATION In this et·a of \New Deal\ liberalism, it seems fitting fo.r Colleg-e Trustees to hand down u broad interpl'etation of the \intoxi- cating liquors\ clause appearing in frater- nity leases. At their meeting on January 16, they decided that beer shall not necessarily be considered an intoxicating beverage and hel'eafter the prevention Ol' controlling of the consumption of beer shaall be left to the dis-- Cl'etion of the President and the Dean. To our way of thinking, this is one of the archaic and out-moded college rules that should have been <:unended some time ago. .:\lany undergraduates will remember that beer parties have been held on the campus on special occasions with the permission of the Dean; so in reality although the rule has been amended only recently, the practice of beer drinking was recognized several years ago. This is a good example of think- ing people refusing to recognize or to ob- set'Ve worn-out laws. Progress cannot be hindered by the conservative mores of our predecessors. \Ve are in an age of liberalism, and the sooner we 1·ecognize it, the better. The publications, at least, believe there is anothe1· archaic law that should have been amended some time befm·e-that restrkting the publications from soliciting beer adver- tising, The trustees have implied that beer is not an intoxicating bevera.g-0: ~o with this in mind. why should l!nion publications be hindered f1·om increasing theh· advertising revenue appreciably?

A small portion of his FOUNIJERS' DAY ATTENDANCE Two .):em·s ago, President F()x inaug-urated the pntctice of observing Founder's Day which, Leca..use of its immediate success, has since beeDme an annual custom. Union was chartered by the State Leg·islatUJ•e on Feb- ruary 2~~ 1796, and it is the men and groups who nu\Cle th.is event possible that the col- lege seek:s to honor each r~ar throug-h the medilm1 ()f a fitting- ceremony.

It is a fine thing· to sustain standards; but we should be equally interested in those men who 1nacie our set of mores. and honor their memol:ies to the best of our ability. We ar-e recipients· of a 1€tter from Dean Garis st.ating that this year each student who is a..bsent from the Founder's Day pro- gram \'ill be charged witl1 two assembly absences.

He made the startling (! J announcement that there were two ways to gain col- onies. One was by war, the other by diplomacy, and if the latter failed, Germany was determined to resort to the former in order to st1·engthen her colonial position. 2. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Chief Executive of a nation great- ly concerned with the suffering of its own people and caring little about its colonial policy, was 57 years old. Several dinners and par- ties were held throughout the country in order to raise funds for the President's pet undertaking- the Georgia Warm Spring Founda- tion which scientifically treats those who a1·e afflicted with the \dread malady,\ infantile paralysis. It was nearly six yeat·s ago that Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his oath ol office as President and since that time has proved himself to be a humanitarian, if he has proved nothing else. The main feature of January 30 in America was the \March of Dimes\ which the President has received for the past few weeks for this worthy cause, while Germany has been primarily interested in the march of men which will further the prestige of the Vater- land and its inspired leader-Adolf Hitler. Roosevelt and Hitler - a great contrast. The former is pri- m:nil.;· interested in furthering the welfare of the weak; the latter is pdmarily interested in imposing his will on the weak in order to furth- er his own welfare. The former has done fully as much for his people as the latter; but Americans are not forced to hear about it. Roosevelt is acting under the will of the people; the Gez·man peo- ple are acting under der Fuehrer. Hitler has .suppressed the Jews and Catholics; Roosevelt has. suppressed the suffering to which so many of our citizens are vulnerable. Roose- velt believes in a strong military machine for defense; Hitler be- lives in a strong military machine for conque,;t, Horatio II. In a letter to the editor in the December 20, 1938 issue of The Concordiensis l wrote advocating more tickets for Union's varsity baslretball players and accussed Mr. Wittner of refusing to grant the basketball captain's request for more tickets. The source of information I had for this accusation was not so authentic as supposed. I wish to state here that the Athletic Direc- tor was never approached by the captain or any other member of the team. I hope that this explanation fully rettacts the statement I made about Mr. vVittner in the previous issue and offsets any injury he may have suffered from it. Sincerly yours, GEORGE L. PECK. Interfraternity Council Critic Editor, The Concordiensis: When you gentlemen who run The Concordiensis get around to giving awards to \that campus or- ganization that has been the most pretentious and, at the same time, the most useless organization on the campus,\ I hope you will give serious con~ideration to the Inter- fraternity Council. Though the competition is keen for the win- ning of this awai·d, with sueh floozies as the Garnet Key Society and the Terrace Council seriously contending for the awazd, r for one would likP to see the good old Interfraternity Council get the palm. I don't know what good they are, I don't know what right they can possibly have to sponsor public dances in the name of the college when only approximately two- thirds of the students of this col- lege are fraternity men, and I don't know why they should have the right to wear keys which signify they have given some sort of serv- ice to the college. They are just a bunch of nice lads who have nothing better to do than to attend meetings that have no ptu tic ular purpo~c. But at one of these meetings. they stum- bled onto a project which places them, in my estimation, on a par with the Garnet Key. Faced with the ponderous. problem of what to do with an embarrassing surplus realized from their Ih terfraternity Dance, the Council decided to give $50.00 to the Schenectady Boys' Club. I don't propose to go into a discussion of tlmt worthy organiza- tion. I merely wish to say that it's the most sensible thing they could have possibly have done. They tell me that in Miami, some- time in February, the Intercol- legiate Association for the Suppres- sion of Ragweed is having a nice I MOTION Children of all ages, sizes, colors and genders will delight in the criminal pursuits of Jesse James !from the poacher of the ~ame name), most of which are now to be seen at Proctor's, We take it that this is to serve as Mr. Zanuck's penance for the hundreds of cinematic sins he has committed in the past few years. You are hereby absolved, Mr. Zanuck. Pax vobisum, too, but wa.tch your step in the future. Tyrone Power, the Amerian Ar- liss, plays the title role as well as he can; at times he seems a trifle puzzled by the social significance of things, but he generally manage8 to scowl and bear it. come what may. Incidentally,. the character he represents has been drawn more from legend than from history, so don't start carping about historical inaccuracies. Henries Fonda and Hull and sev- eral other actors take up where Ty leaves off, and Nancy Kelly con- tributes an assortment of emotional work-outs whose excellence belies her youth. Altogether, Jesse Jame.s deserves to be the box-office smash it undoubtedly is. No matter ;what anyone says, you can take om· wor·d that tlie sec- ond feature, P:udon Our Nerve, is a mystery film. * * * The story behind the Mounte- banks' issuing student passes to their film festival is a long and amusing one, but to tell it would be the basest kind of ingratitude for thl\ bountie~ we are about to receive.

The visitors, who had previously defeated Harvard by an 18 point margin, led at the half 30-26. In the second half, however, the Union team showed a return of spirit, and, with Herb Watson lead- ing the way, slowly closed the gap. .John Schultz also played a stellar game. None of the aggressiveness and spilit which was present in the game against 'Tufts, was shown in the game with Colgate on January 21. The first half was featured by defensive play, ending in a tie.
