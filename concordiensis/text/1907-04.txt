Mr. Patton was a member of the last class over which Eliphalet Yott presided. The pres- ent president of Union College, Dr. Andre\v V. V. Raymond, was o:n e of Mr. Patton's pupils. He leaves a widow) a :brothE'r, Alexandel>, who occupies the old Patt(i)u homestead in Rensse- rise to their height on the very eve of hifl la~t examination is a different proposition. He was finally awakened from his pipe dreams by the cali to dinner, after which func- tion he betook himself to his roo1n with the sole idea of \cramming\ all night. Severa.l hours of \weary wading\ passed, during which time he had mastered less than the first chap- ter, owing to the fact that a certain pair of

brown eyes were continually looking up at him frorn each page, despite his heroic efforts not to :::Pc them. He finally decided to turn in and rely upon his luck to pull hin1 through, as it had done so often in the past. He arose a quarter of an hour before exatn- inaUon time, ate a hasty hreakfast and started fonh to meet his fate. On his way across the campus he encountered a classmate, who con- fided to him that his being abl,e to continue his college course depended solely upon the out- come of this particular \exam and, \vhat ,made it worse, the fact that despite hours and hours of work he didn't s-eem to be able to get the stuff through his head. Later, after Smith had filled his book \Yith a Rurprisingly accurate amount of knowledge in answer to the questions, he happened to glance at the fac>e of his companion of an hour pre- viouR, and beheld an expression of abject mis- ery. Smith began to realize how very n1uch that look meant when he thought of how its bor's shoa1der to freshen his memo:ry upon the answers in question. After a lengthy lecture and manY depp re- grets the president pointed out that it was up to h.irn to };eave college before the faculty ex- pelled 'him. He sl1ow;ly made his way back to his romn and threw himseU at full length upon the bed.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 9 The University of Cincinnatt recently un- earthed a new form of graft. The co-operative book store was foun.d to be pay,ing d·ividends of 110 per cent. This was heing s]lared by several professors and a few students.

A steam heater attached to the furnace in the Delta Phi house at Cornell exploded Moli.- day afternoon .and caused considerable damage, although no one was hurt.

OUR HASii.E'rBAJ..~l.~ 'rEAl\[ The end of our first basketball season has cotne, ancl the ga1nes are now a Tnat- ter of the past. Although our showing has not been so good as expected, we ought to feel proncl of our tean1, considering the obstacles it had to overcon1e at every turn. 'fhe sun1n1ary, printed on another pag-e, shows our opponents to have rnadc less than one hundred points n1ore than we have. And, when we consider the tean1s \Ve have n1et, the record is n1ost creditable. \Vith the initial season behind us, and with the experience gained there by, vve have every reason to expect \()lcl lTnion., to take a high rank in basketball in years to con1e.

Of the graduating class, Cilieero George Clifford, of Burlington, Vt., took the college prize for best general examinati0ns, while the Bigelow prize for the best work in mi e~ro­ scopy, given by Dr. J.

CoU£>ge Building Proposed The i1nportant move of the afternoon meet- ing of the Alumni association was to elect a commit te€ to confer with the board of directors and faculty of the college on the matter of a new colloEge building. The committee consists of Robert V. Coon, of Troy; William A. Larkin, and Ed:wa.rd C. Hutman. There has bl?en a great dea.I of talk of late about a new building for the Albany College of Pharmacy. The building is a need, owing to the rapidly in.- creasing Inembership of t'he school and the in- adequate room and facilities of the Medical col- lege building, where the pharn1acy students now

\ : . I 6 THE CONCO·RDIENSIS recite. It is intended to make the talk amount to .something and probably the first move of the co·mmittee after its .conference with facu1tty and directors will be to raise a builaing fund. Officers were also elected at the afte·rno0n m~eeting and were as follows.: Robert V. Coon, president; William V. Hogan, first vice-presi- dent,; Cicero G. Clifford, second vice-president; Wil:Uam. A. Larkin, secretary; Edwin C. Hut- man, treasurer; S. S. Smith, ''98, historian; F. G. Dixon, '98, historian. The banquet which took place at the Ten Eyck immediately after the commencement ex- ercises was a successful and weB-attended af- fair. Theodore J. Bradley, the retiring presi- dent of the association, acted as toastmaster. The speakers were: Dr. A. V. V. Raymond, James F. McElroy, Rev. Dr. Edgar H. Brown, Arthur L. Andrews, Dr. A. B. Huested, William L. Baker, Robert V. Coon, Jr., and Ed-win F. Hunting. New L.eaflet of !Information The Union College Alumni Association has lately issued a leaflet for the information of young men preparing for college. Th.e leaflet is a single folder printed with garnet ink. It contains a brief but clear account of the C~l­ lege,. its courses and its general policy. For one unacquainted with our history the following sentence may be interesting: \Its alumni roll contains the names of a President of the United States, six United Stat€s Envoys, six Cabinet officers, eleven United States Senators, twelve Governors, six: Major-Generals, eigbt Brigadier-Generals, two Rear Admirals, more than one hundred Congressmen and forty- NEW '' C.QNCORDY '' BOARD WeyraHch, '08, Edi.tor-in-Chief-!Freslun:en ,Chosen The :Senior members of the \Concordy\ staff met in Silliman Hall Tuesday noon and decided upon the men who Will constitute the new board Weyrauch, '08, will act as editor-in- chief; ·watson, '08, as literary editor; Shutler, '08, : ~.;s athletic ·editor, and Raymond, '08, as news editor with responsibility for the Alumni Notes. H. S. Parsons, '09, was elected to the Board of Ass·ociate Editors. The following Fres'hmen were chosen for the reportorial staff: Cavert, Vedder, Van Deusen, Walser, Freeman and Ferguson. The only other matter of interest discussed was the question of reducing the number of places on. the staff. It was suggested that a smaller body would he more efficient and less difficult to reach with assignments. There was also pronosed a plan whereby this reduction could be effected. The sc'heme involves the u.ecessity of electing one man from each class every year so that the board would be com- posed of four Seniors, three Juniors, two Soph- omores and one F'reshman. However, there was no motion made that such a scheme be brought before the student body. Rutgers-Union De bate On Friday evening, May 3d, will occur in the chapel the annual debate with Rutgers. The subject to be debated is, \Resolved That the growing tendency toward centralization of power in a national government is a menace to the welfare of the United States.\ Rutgers has chosen the negative side of the question. five College Presidents, among them Presidents Several times each week frmn now until the of Bowdoin, Brown, Hobart, Michigan Univer- first of Mla.y, there are to be regular debates on sity, Princeton, Smith, Trinity, Vassar and this subject.

There has already been a considerable demand and the general Alumni Association has reason to feel gratified that its efforts have not been wasted. next three weeks.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 7 NEW :CATALOGUE APPEARS, Several Changes Noticed The catalogue for 19 06-1907 appeared earlliy last week and has already been widely circu- lated about college. There are a number (i),f changes from the catalogue· of last year, and we shall attempt to speak of a f·ew of them. Under the Board of Trustees of the College occurs a new name~that of Mr. W1Hiam :F. J-Iavemeyer of New York City. Two new Alum,ni .Associations appear-the Association ·Of Michi- gan and the Association of Western New York. Under the Faculty list ·one notices that Dr. :Barnes is now a full professor. Prof. C'retghto11 is absent on leave. Mr. Hughes and Mr. F€1~­ guson have both been made assist.ant profes- sors. There is a new con'lmittee of the Faculty, which has supervision over admission to ad- -vanced standing. The Schelule Committee is composed of three members rather than one, as heretofore. A list of candidates for the degr€e of M. A. is printed for the fi.rst time. There are six names on the list. The Secretary of the Faculty now appears under the title of College Officers. T'he qualifications for admission re- main about the same, with the exception ·Of the requirements in English. In 1909 a new s:et .of requirements as indicated by the College Entrance Examination Board will go into effect. The work in mathematics has been divided into is estimated t.o cost from $4 to $5, rather than from. $3 to $4. The campus tax has been raised: from $10 to $11 as a result of a m.otion passed :Py the student body. 'Three .new scholarships appear, known as the Horace B. Silliman Scholarships. Articles on Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi also appear. The list of lecturers in E:lectrical Engineering is a decided addition. A new account of the elec- trical laboratory has been inserted. The Albany Department acc.ounts are about the same as in previous years, with the excep- tion .of the Dudley Observatory.

8 'rHE CONCORDIENS13 ==~================~======= College Meeting Again Las( Monday morning after the regular cha]leil exercises the undergraduates met in business session. This was the first real college meetin.g since last Thanksgiving and there was mani~.fest a considerable enthusiasm in s:pite .of the fact that an effort was made by a certain few to show a spirit of opposition to the resumption of the privilege. But two meetings have been. held during the winter and in cons.equence t11 ere will doubtless be an unusually large amount of The election of a hask\;etbaU captain which was to occur last Monday morning was post- poned to a later date because of there being some doubt as to what players were eligible to vote.

Provisional Sta.ge Appointments The provisional list of stage appointments has been made public. The list is printed alpha- betically and does not indicate standing.. The permanent list is made out on the basis of work done during the spring term. The list is as follows: Academics-Bennett, Gardiner, Girvin, Par- sons, White. Engineers-Avery, Davis, Nicht, D. H. Os- borne, Stearns. Waldron, who will graduate as one of the class of 1906, may possibly receive an appoint- ment in place of on of the Academics. 'The F'aculty has not yet settled the question. Commencement Notes As is generally known, the Hague Peace Con- ference will meet on June 15th. This fRet ha.:; an important bearing upon the arrang·e1nen~ s that were originally made with re~erence to 'OUr commencement exercises. Some ti.me ago it 'iYLt~ announced that the Hon. Joseph H. Choat~~, U. S. representative to the Tribunal, would act as Honorary Chancellor, provided the meeti o.g at The Hague did not occur as early as it is now scheduled. As Commencement Day fa.Cs on the twelfth this year, it is plainly out of ever, an excellent choice has been made in tlte selection of the Hon. Joseph E. Ramsdell, U. :s·. Congressman from Louisiana. Mr. RarnsdeU was graduated with the class of 18 8 2 and will take a prominent place i.n the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his class.

It is reported that he will receive an honorary degree, but the report can not at present be verified. Fire in Silliman Hall At about 2:30 o'clock last Saturday afternoon a slight fire broke out in the basement of SUP- man Hall. There was considerable excitemen: for a short time, but the flames were easily controlled. Fire Companies Nos. 1, 5 and 6 responded prompt'ly to the alarm. When the firemen first entered the cellar it seemed. br3- cause of the dens€ smoke, that there was a, large fire. A hasty invstigation proved that 1t was nothing more than an ash box and some papers which had been carelessly placed in it. The fire was quickly extinguished with but little damage done.

T'HE PI~ESENr:t, BOAlt.D :RE.',riRES W it\1 the present issue the Seniors of the e·ditorial staff sever all active connection with the paper. The titne is sotnewhat earlier t'han usual, but various conditions C()nspire together to n1ake such a step ad- visable. As a result of personal experience we are convinced that the old board should r€tire at the end of the winter tern1. The reasons for such a change are easily under- stood when one fully appreciates the care and worry that is entailed when the new e{litor does not asstune entire charge until the end of the year. The burden 1nay be C()nsiclerabl y lighten eel when the counsel of the old board is a vaiilable. Such a s~he1ne is followed out with marked suc- c css in rnost other colleges and we are clesirons of instituting any change that will t€nd to raise the standard of the paper, without necessitating the [oss of any of that cherished spirit of co11servatis1n which l1as been of great value to the College and t() us. And so we have been the gainer during what now see1ns a brief tenn of office. L-~ast fall the way looked 1ong, offering nnn1erons obstacles.

THE CONOORDIENSIS II pointed, at 1.east, so far as the obstacllies were concerned. But each ti1ne a difficufty was encountered we were not without th.e active a:id and cheering assurance of our associates. To the1n and to a few otdler friends whose interest never flagged, we O\i\Te a d:ebt of gra~itude of which we shall ever he mindful. Of good we have rendered the College \Ve say nothing. 'Chat is left to judgrnent sounder than our o·wn. One thing is sure. We have always endeavored to guard t:he trust given over to us. vVe have sought fa~irnes:s;J honesty and dignity. We have ai1ned to please ahnnni as weU as under- graduat~s. Above everything else, we have tried to foster the best and the 1nost who!le- sonle sp~irit, not onwy for the College, h·ut also for the entire University. If our ef- forts h~ave not succeeded we s'hall be con- tent to take con1fort in the consciousness that the long hours of labor have strengfh- ened and fortified with triple bronze an enduring love for ,O:Jd Union, to whotn we have gi1ven nothir1g in cotnparison with what we are taking away. TO OUR SUCCESSORS It is with the greatest pleasure that we wercovn.e the new board-the greatest pleasure, because we are giving up a c~her­ ish·ed work to n1en in whon1 we have .a..b- solnte confidence. The Associate Editors ha-ve 1il.ever failed to perforn1 a work or a kindness whenever possible. For this we render sincere thankfulness. Inastnuch as tl1ey }Qave been true to us at titnes when their assistance vva.s 111ost desired, we kti:ow that they will be true to each other .and true to the con11non work. And rest~ing in t'his assurance, we look for nothing bnt the best results ancl the greatest success. ~CAUTJON URGED In the issue of this paper for r6 March there was printed a new set of rules for governing athtetics at Union. It should be distinctly understood that these rules are not final. They were rnerely adop:ted by the Athleti-c B',oard and now await rati- fication by the student body. It is highly essential that care and thought attend the discussion of all points brought up for ar-- gutnent. Especially should the captains and managers of the several teams be present at College n1eeting lYionday morn- ing. We are of the opinion that a nu~n­ ber of rulings in Article IX concerning the a ward of athletic emblems ought to be 1nodified. Section III is a particular case. An ''R\ would signify nothing to an old Union n1an or to an outsider. Why can- not we return to the former custom of awarding a \2nd\? \Ve trust that the con- sideration of the proposed rules will be thorough and definite. Baseball Eligibilities The Faculty has satisfied itself as to the scholarship of the· following candidates for base- ball: 1901 Harvey, Davis, D. H. Osborne. 1908 Hoffman, King, Vogt. 190~ Bergan Pettit. 1910 Buck, Houck, Ladue, Leon, Macomber, Robinson. Hildreth, '08, and Bayless, '()8, are endea.Yor- ing to pass off conditions in May. If successful they will be .candidates for the team.

The tax of twenty-five cents per man levied at the college meeting Monday wiU be sufficient, if all pay up promptly.

I' n·lin1lnary to the found.i ng (;)f .a eha}rter of the Jnt(:•l·collegiate Civic LeagH.e at Union, Mr. Charles M. Jesup of New York delive,red a lecture on \Americanism\ before a re:prescn- tativf~ hody of students in :Silliman Ha 11 on Saturday evening Jast. Mr. Jesup after an in- t ruduvtioll by Profe:-:;sol' Opdyke ftpnke in part a~ f<~lluws: ''I <~I)Jl1.f. lwfore you tonight ll()t as a politi- t'ia n 1 )U 1 aH a ci Uzen wh <) for th il'ty-five years ha~ follfn\'l'd the -banking l>usiaess in New York City. I wiBh to talk briefly about the forina- tion of Civic Leagues in the colleges. It waH c1u ring 1\Ir. Jerome's campaign for district at- tm·Hpy that I was first connected with publ'c establishing the league on a firm basis. Seven dubs have been added c1urir1·g; the year and I hope that Union will be th-e twenty-first to eslablish. a branch club. rrhe reasons for th·3 existence of such a club are: Fh·st, to elevate the tone of citizenship-Second, to create a spirit of manliness-Third, to create a bond of union and strength among the universities thal wi 11 provide for future govern1:n:en t of the nation.'' Mr. Jesup here l'PHd lPtters fr<>rn Governo1· HugheH, Governor Cun1mings and €x:-President Clev<·laiH1, all indicating a deep interest in the <·I l>ject of the league and expressing the idea th.a t it would fill a want long fel:t ill our pub- He life. On the topic of ''A nw rieanism\ Mr. Jesup service in the linP of carnpaign speaking. r spoke as follows:- \vcu..; elo:-;ply -connected with Mr. Jerome thr·oug-h- out th~ campaign, nnd it waft through him that my na nw wn::..; :..;uggPstf'a a::.; a man to in- terest ('ullege men in l'lPa n go\rcrntnent aftPr their graduation. I was Romewhat <lifficlent on the 1natter befon~ I addressed my first a ucl- ience-a group of Yak ~tudents, but they ac- eorded 111e such a warm welcon1e that I have PVel' since felt perfectly at h<HlH' before groU!W of college men. The idea of a civi.c lPague is to fe<JeralE.' non- \Arnerica is houn<1e<1 on the north by thl~ nDI'th poll', on the ea:..;t by the dsing sun, on thP WP~t hy all cn'ation HlHl on the south by infillity. John Bright held that .America hel(l tht> stronge~t government in the world, whil8 WPbHter defined Americanism as ~the love that AnH'ricanH have for their own country.' We love An1erica for thP wonderful past ,made by 1nen \'\'ho havP built not for a day but for future ag·cH. A n<l all of the J1ighest types of these men ha \'(' bcpn God-fearing. This is one of the partizan clubs of men in va.rious colleges to gn'ateHt factors of our national stre·ngth. And arouse intereHt in local good government. Cleall S<) WP should love Arnerica for her 1nanhood principles and absolute non-partizanship Tnust o.f achiPvement, for her rnanhood of character be the standards carried out. ATnong the nottd backed up by the exarnples of such men as n1en that endorsed the idea were Baron Vc{n \Vashington, Lincoln, Hay, Grant and McKinley.

6 THE 'CONCORD!ENSIS a :rnessage to every one of us. It floats as the eTnblem of. the heritage of which I have spoken. w;ithout pessimism I may say that the pres- of power, to see that decent men are nominated at the primaries and are ·elected at the elec- tions; and the men at present in college will have this duty thrust upon them in a few ent times demand loyalty for several reasons years. and the :first great reason is that confrontiRg Our third great danger is from Individual- us ·in the immigration problem. Heveral years ism. One American) regardless of personal abil- ago there was a convention he1d by authoriUes on tbe subject to try to turn the Ude of immi- g-:rants away from New York to southern ports. illn the year ending June, 1905, ten million im- nl:igrants landed in America. Of this number thiry :per cent. landed in New York and .staid there. T'he sarn:e thing happened in 1906, ex- cept that there were more immigrants. Now these immigrants are of the lowest strata of Europ€an society, and consist of ignorant Poles, Russians and Italians in a large measure. They come with no conception o!E the dignity of our r~epublic, and they must be shown by our own examples the duties of citizenship, and their children must be educated u:p to our true Amer- ican ideals. 'l'he second problem that confronts us is that of the enormous power ·Of wealth and labor. '~ealth is a blessing if used rightly; a curse H it is not. And it is a curse if it is not earned wHh absolute honesty. In the present age there is too much gambling, but nothwith- stan(!ing this fact I still hold that there are numerous honest men on Wall Street. But Hjgh finance that stops at nothing is not for the g-ood of the country. It ren1inds me of the story of the Iris'hman who was al~rested for stealing a hot·se. His father, wno apparently had a good sense of right, came to him an\(} said: 'Phwy did yes steal the horse when ye might just as well have bought him and not paid for him.' Capital and labor owe much to each other and proper reciprocation will do away with many of the existing evils. The honest politician is now the one who is in popular favo.r. Note Croker and Tweed a..nd Murphy as men holding the disapprobation of the public at large. It is now the duty of the colhgian to see that such men are kept out ity is no better as a citizen than any other of 'his fellows. All have the same rights and the same priviHges, and if the spirit of American- isin is fostered and nourished this menace of Individualism will disappear. So for the oblit- eration of these evils we must honestly meet our every duty and responsibility in the state, in the home, in our social life and in our busi- ness relations. Men are wanted who play fair at every stage of the game-Inen who will stand by and stand for our American ideals, and thus rais.e the level of the entire country. In closing I would say, first have the grit to fonn your own opinions after carefully weighing the merits of every case in point; second, have the grit to adhere to these opin- ions, and third, have the grace to live for them honestly, manfully and fearlessly, anrl you will exemplify the thought that we love our country as men, and will influ0nco others to do the sa1ne. rnlC Civic I Jca.gu c. Following Mr. Jesup's lecture, in an infonnal discussion, it was brought out that there were at prpsent twenty college clubs in the Civic League. Me1nbership was generally limited to vicked 1nen fro1n the two upper classes and in most cases consisted of about twenty men. In no case should the Inembership, in Mr. Jesup's opinion exceed fifty. Each club must be primarily non-partizan in nature, and its ob- ject should be to promote clean politics in the member's home towns and to study civil gov- ernment as exemplified locally. In Yale the n1embers attend the meetings of the common council in the city of New Haven, and there is good opportunity for the study of municipal government in Schenectady.

The president was voted the power to appoint an executive committee, presu1nably to consist of three undergraduates and two members of the faculty. A meeting will be called within. a week or two to pass upon the adoption of a C'onstitu tion. College lVIe,eting . So1ne of the old time spirit began to mani- fest itself at Chapel meeting on Monday, and th:e under-classmen seem to be imbibing more of the feeling of inte·rest in their Alma Mater, as was indicated by the enthusiasm. they showed at the proceedings. Captain Harvey opened the Ineeting by an account of the West Point base ball game. The tea:m, he said, went down without the least practice and put up a fight worthy of vet,erans. Practice of the proper sort, under the coaching of Dr. Ma<!Comber, should put the team into fit condition to cope in a cred- itable manner with the most feared of the Garnet's adversaries. -Captain Harvey asked the entire student body to give the team their earnest support. Fairbairn, '0 7, announced that by special grant of the faculty the Glee Clubs were to take a three days' trip at the end of this month. He proposed a motion that was passed, to provide for the future collection of one dollar Glee Club ta:x in the same way no\V applying to the athletic assessments. It was pt·ovided. that members from each class should get the signatures of the student body neces- Ha ry for the legal collection of the tax. Tick- ets of admission to all the home concerts will be given to those who subscribe their names to the list. Captain Flo·wers of the track team announced that team. F.(e urged make special e,ff.orts to ''06, seconded Flowers that there should, with the raw material to come out. Waldron, suggestions and said our pre.seRt coaching system, be a good team this yBar. President White of the student body ap- pointed a committee, upon mo.tion, to en- quir,e into the advisability of a..dopting the :sug- gestions recommended by the athletic 'beard, and this com.mittee will r.ep.ort its findir~gs in Chapel meeting on M'onday, at which time the student body win vote on the .suggestions. ri'he committee named consists o.f Harvey, '07, H.

Specia:l attention is ca.lled to the meeting to be held on Tuesday evening. A full report of the peace conference will be given by those present from Union, including Presi- dent Raymond, Dr. Hoffman, Dr. Ashmore and Dr. Hale. Personal impressions will form an in- teresting part of the talks of all the speakers. All who can possibly do so should attend. Prof. Ashmore Entertains .. On Friday evening of last week the Senior class was entertained by Professor and Mrs. Ashmore at their house on the Campus. Mr. vV. T. Stead, the noted naturalist, . deliv- ered a very interesting and instructive lecture on \The Birds of New Zealand,'' illustrated: by a series of stereopticon views, the best obtain- able on the subject. After the talk refreshments ·were set'ved and those present passed the even- ing in a very pleasant social wa.y. The follow- ing were present: President A. V. V. Raymond, Miss Ray1nond, Miss Paige and the following me1nbers of the Senior class: Bishop, Trumbull, Davis, Blinn, Stearns, Dillon, Brennan, Girvin, White, Pyles, Rodrigues, Franchot, Fairbairn, Gardiner and the vacancy of several in~portant positions on Waldron.

g 'ri-IE C'ONCORDIENSIS The ~Glee Clubs. eenor Day or Syracuse University that college Severa:t questions have recently arisen that have caused an h:rdefinite pC)stponement of the Glee Clu\b trip J:)lanned for the latter part of this month. One of the principle reasons is the defunct condi Han of the orchestra and the sem,i-eon1atose condition of the mandolin aggre- gation. It has bet'n found practieally impos- sible to arrange Rcceptible dates for 1nerety the glee club standing; on its own merits. Managers throug·bout all towns de1nand from. a college organization of this natu·t·e full representation in the instrumental as well as in. the vocal line. Another thing that has rath.er put the damper on the scheme is the fact that at present the elub !has absolutely no financial backing, and it takes no inconsiderable sum to take a group of twenty or thirty fellows on a lengthy trip, es- pecially when there is 1neTely a hypothetical outcome promised at the other end. The n1anagcment has in consequence decided to take a few short trips in the immediate neighborhood to try out the metal of the one livi11g branch of the organi.zation and to raise a little of the necessary cash before ventul'ing too far from hon1.e. Union Night at Graduates' Club. On Thursday night, April the eleventh, about one hundred sons of old Union assemhled at the Graduates' Club, ~ew York City, to cele- brate 'Union Night.' These alumni recalled to thf'ir memories their \happy college days\ in Htory and song and Rtirred Ul) their Union spirit a g-reat deal. Mr. Clarke W. Crannell, '95, was toastmaster of the occasion and introduced the following speakers: Dr. Andrew V. V. Raymond, president of Union College; Supreme Court Justice Peter A. Hendrick, Rev. Dr. Wm. Elliot Griffis; Andrew W. Gleason, '61; Frank C. Avery, '81; Georg-e F. Allison, '84; Wm. J. Smith, '69; John A. Bolles, '03; Wil- liam Allen, '95, and Eli Perkins. President R.aymond and Justice I-3!endrick, in their speeches, answe·red the declaration of Chan- morals ·were on a lo.wer p]ane than hithe~·to. Both the sepakers differed wHh Chancellor Day and Justice Hendrick said that as a mem- ber of the Graduates' Club he could say that colllege life was as high as hitherto in it~ :-;tanda·rdR, if not higher. Atnong the guests present were: Rev. J >r. George Alexander, '8 4; Henry L. Stoddard, '6:5; Dr. G.eol'ge W. Clarke, '4 0; Dr. Edgar S. ParnPy, ·~4; .Rev. Dr. Wm. M. Gilbert, '83; \Nm.

I2 THE CONCORDf.ENSIS Sew;;on Opens \Vith Gau1e at \1\'eRt Poi;nt. Laflt Saturday Union played h~t· first game of baseball of the p1·esent season with vVest Point on the latter's diamond. Everything conspk'ed to maike the game rather a disappoinhnent to all concerned. · During the ertire week the Va 1- :-;ity tearn ha(l been unabl>e to put ! n even uno day of good, solid. practice on account of the unpreeedented fall of slu.ow. !fn consequence Manager Brennan wrote to \Vest Point to can- cel the game. A reply by telegra].)h brought the information that West Point had had the same difficulty, so it \vas decided to play the go1ne as originally scheduled. W'hen Va1·sity arrived at West Point a heavy :• rain was doing HH best to further damage an already soggy diamond, and it \'.vas impossible to start the game until 4:30. The players wal- lowed through seven innings of an. unintersting game when the growing dm·kness 1nade further play an utte1· impossibilHy. Brilliant plays were rathee a 1ninus quan- tity on both sideH, owin?g to a lack of practice. ,..fhe Varsity tea1n, howeveT, consi<Iering the facts of the case, played together in a... solid fashion, more like a team of veterans tha,n a group of men without practice and a thorough knowledge of each other's Inethods of play. In general Union played as well as W:est Point. Davis pitched a fine game, and fie Ide d his position well. I<:.ing, Bergan and Ladue made our only hits, and through lack of moTe .consistant bat- ting these failed to materi.al\ze jn to runs. In the third inning West Point, by a few bunched hHs, brought in some winning runs and the score at the end of the game was 5-0 in their favor. There is every reason to SU})POS€ that with a few weeks of good steady practice our Varsity team wi.ll be one to rnake a record this yeae for the Garnet against her opponents.

THE CONCORDIENSIS last year tn 2'7: 2., within two-fifths of a second tion in this event, and in every meet w·e should of the college Tecord. He is the lone supporter hold ·our own. of the ·Garnet in this event, and here, too, there is a gap to be filled in by second and third place men of ability. The high hurdles are taken care of ay Langley, Streibert and Fuller- ton. The two former finished first and second in the R.ochester meet, and Fullerton took sec- ond in the Trinity event. 'There is hope that with prope:e coaching these men may deve~op better form this season and be a little stronger in the event. Of last year's high jumpers no one is left but :Weyrauch, who negotiated 5:4 at last year's inter-class meet. He jumped for the first time 1last year, and shows a lack of coaching and .experience. Dunn, a freshman, cleared 5:3 3-4 last fall, and D·r. TYLacComber is working to de- velop Paul, anofher promising freshman, in this event. Ayers from Medic has had considerable experience in t'he event and will doubtless prove a.. strong figure. The broad junp is taken care of by Streibert, who last year broke the college record at Roch- ester, but men are needed for second and third })lace to clinch the -event for Union in the com- ]ng meets. Of last year's p0le vaulters we have Shutler (who has not yet come out this spring) and Streibert, who tied for first at R. P. I. last year at 9:6. Dunn has done good work along this line, clearing over 9:4 in ont of last fall's 1neets, and if he \\Vlll be able to compete t'his spring he will greatly strengthen the event. The shot-put has but one champion-Rankin. He took second. in the Rochester meet last year, and is now ]n practice, pushing the lead out for over 34 feet daily. Here again we are in decided need of place men. On the hammer Rankin and Weyrauch both made good last year and formed good seconds to Closson, who broke his own record at R.ochester. Both, how- ever, have lots of room for improvement. Dunn, who has been doing good work with the twelve- This completes then the 1f.st of ·events. The track team as H appears on pape,r lacks sec- ond and third pla.ce men. In nearly every event we have one good ma..n, and in a few we have the full quota. The sane troubfe ~s mani- fest this year as in other yeaFs. One :man has to fill the place of two or thTee, instead of two or three trying for the one fPOSition. However, there is a fine squad out for !daily practice, and from the new men some g0o0d material ought to manifest itself, so as to balance the tea1n more evenly. The team, in spite of obst:aetes, is ]n a very favorable position to win its r:neets. Enthusiasm is one thing that should prove a great aid, and if t'he fellows would come out to express their interest at daily practice it wou1d be a great encouragement to the men on the team. We have the material, and we thln..k that it will be developed into a good, strong team before the end of the season. Peace Conference. A mE>eting of the students and thE' me1nbE'rR of the faculty, who were interested in the Peace ConferE'nce, waR held in Sillin1an Hall on Tuesday evening last to hear the report of the delegates from Union. who were present at the conference in New York City. Dr. Raymond was the first speaker, and he gave a most interesting acco,unt of the forma- tion of the· first Peace Societi,€s in this country, from which have grown the g\'reat rn<>vement now commanding world-wide attention. He then spoke in detail of the cause of such a convocation, and of the interest and merit of the men who took part in it. .Such men as Root, Hughes, Bryce, Hale, Eliot and others who are known as practical men always com- mand. attention, and for this T-eason, if no other, the convention attracted the ~ttention of every thinking man.

THE CONCORDIENSIS meeting was that \W.ar ought to be abolished men.t the volume comprising the history of the and some day it will be by civilized people.\ college is replete with :many personal touches Dr. Hoffman th.en spoke for a few mom.ents of the pr~esident'.s own pen.

University meeting, then a meeting devoted to College i:ntN·ests, another for WOinen, a·nd yt>t another f<H children. He then gave us the sub=ltanee of the addresses of Mr. Adler, Mr. M.eade, Baron d'Estournelles cle Constant, Dr. John Rhys, vice-chancello·r of Oxford; Mr. Rob- t~rcs, vice-chancellor of Cam bridge, and Mr. B1·yan. Dr. Roffman fittingly ended his remarks by saying· that Dr. Hiccock, who was president of Union, wrote of this \great peace m.ove- m<:>nt,\ which he firmly believed would some day tw considered by every nation of the earth. J.w.::;t before the adjournment of the Peace Conference the Cross of the Legion of H:onor was given to Andrew Carnegie in token of hirs great work for the benefit of huma-nity, and Mr. Carnegie, in accepting it, made a short address that will be remembered for a long while by those whose fortune it was to be present at such a conference. J)I·. Ra.yul.oncl's \Vork Ootnes From The Press Union University, Its History, Influence, Char- acteristics and Equipment, with the Lives and Works of Its Founders, Benefactors, Officers, Regents, Faculty and the Achievements of Its Alumni is the title ·Of th-e work of Dr. Raymond that has just come from the press. Dr. Raymond in his editorial note makes a resume of the contents, saying: \This is not so much a history as a cmnpilation. It brings together from. many sources authentic data connected with the orig~in and growth of Union College and the other departments of Union University. Care has been taken to include everything of permanent interest, and it is be- lieved· that no important document 'has been omitted. Jn this lies the chief value of the publication.'' In spite of the modest editorial announce- is most exhaustive in its detail and the reader is led throu.gh the conditions of the first con- ception of the college and the presidencies of the m.any noted men of the past up to the pres- ent day Union as we all know it. Every topic of interest is given full consideration and the influence oE our institutions of every nature rrtade the subject of comment. This includes a 'history of the founding of the literary socie- ties and the Greek letter fraternities. In Chap- ter XXV:UII, entitled \Retrospect and Prospect,\ a resume of the work is made, part of which reads as follows: \Union College owes its origin to the condi- tions created by the Revolutionary War, and was designed to meet the needs of the new na- tional life, as was affirmed in the first petition presented by seven handred and twenty citi- zens of Northern New York in 1779. .' It has the distinction of being the oldest unde- nom.inational college in America. For many years it was the only college in the State north of New York City. In the one hundred and ten years of its life it has enrolled 7 9 9 6 stu- dents and graduated 5309. Among the Alumni have been a president of the United States, two Justices of the Suprem.e Court of the United States, six United States Envoys, six Cabinet Officers, two Speakers of the House of Repre- sentatives, one hundred and thirty Congressmen, twelve Governors, six Major Generals, eight Brigadier Generals, two Rear Admirals, and forty-five College Presidents.\ The influence of Dr. Eliphalet Nott is made the subject of a consi:derable portion of the first volume. The second and third volumes are taken up with biegraphical sketches, com- piled by the publishers, of a number of alumni at present living, and the University faculty. An interesting feature of the work is the financial review. In this it is shown that since 1897 the college has incurred no debt, and at present does not owe a dollar. The invested

Dr. Haymond's work has been one of arduous compilation and careful collection of the <l.ocu- ments of the entire history of the college. '1'ht~ work, as is intended, will on this account be a very valuable asset to the library of every one connected by association with Old Union. College Briefs.

The settlement of the estates of Gabriel Bouck, a graduate of Union College, by the Wisconsin courts, discloses that he left a for- tune valued at $600,000. Mr. Bouck upon grad- uation was conferred the hono1~ of Phi Beta Kappa, and since then he has been one of our most noted present day graduates. H'e was Speaker of the Wisconsin House of Representa- tives, Member of Congress from that State, Colonel in the Wisconsin Volunteers, Attorney C1eneral. His residence at the time of his death was at Oshkosh, vVisconsin, where he had taken up the study of law after his graduation from • Uni.on. j \67 .. Rev. Tennis Slingerland Hamlin, D.

Dr. Hamlin was born May 31, 1847, in Glen- ville, Schenectady County, New York, and re- sided at Washington, D. C., where for twenty- dne years he had been pastor of the Church of the Covenant.

On 'l,uesday and Wednesday the: special m.eeting orf coUege trustees to investigate· the imoprovem,ent of the campus met, and decided upon a definite course o£ action to p1U1rsue. T'he two• days were spent in a thorough investigati~n of campus con- ditions, and the mem1bers of the committee, con- sisting of Dr. S. Ba.rney, Hon. George F. Seward, and Frederic}{. W. Cameron, carefully e·xamined the entilre eam;pus. It is the puvpose of the trus- tees to ca.rry on the work of improvem;ent until the grounds and all the buildings a.re in proper condition. All that will be attempted before com- m·encemen t is the• straightening .O·f roads and paths, the opening orf a new avenue fro·m the library to Union Street, and the replacing of the broken parts o;f the terrace wall. A s'pecial cornmrittee. of the trustee·s is consider- ing the general plan for the erection of a new engineering building and the erection o.f this will probably start before the end of another year.

Pl~actically a full atte-11dian.ce of the entire stu- dent tbody marked la:::;t Monday's chapel meeting. ~rhe meedng grew s0mewhat monotonous to- warr'ifl the end on account of the a1nount of time necessarily devoted to tl;}_e compilation of the I·epor'l of the athleUc advisory commi t:tee :rela- tive to the adoption o;f the by-laws of the ath- letic association. This matter was not fully setUed and \\Viii co1ne u~ again for consideration at M0nday's meeting. At the opening of the session President White of the scudent body a,ppointed Mr. Cantwell chainnan for the meeting on account of the re-port that the president had to make as chair- man 'of the commHtee concerning the athletic by-laws. Bif:hop, '0 7, spoke first. He announced the t raek schedule for the coming season. and made the statem.ent that Dr. MacComber was very well pleased with the ·work being done by the tPain. He also gave an account of the New York State Intercollegiat:e League that formerly c·onsisted of HobaTt, Hamilton, Rochester, Col- gate and Union. Several years ago, he said, l ~nion. through what was p1·obably her own fault, dropped out of U1e league, and that it \\'RR \up to'' the student body as being inter- ested in intercollegiate relations vvith these other colleges to make appliaction for read1nission to the league. The moti<tHl to apply fol' readmi.s- s;on '\yas passed by a unanimous vote. Captain Harvey then spoke on the Williams gamP-that poor playing was a marked feature, n n tl the players for son-1.e reason were not in baseball game. He sa.id lhat it was a. poor p~1·oper condition to play a g-ood game of ball on that day. Each player did. hJs absolute best, but a :J:ack of snap spoiled om 1 chances fo.r win- niinrg the game. There was m:te redeeming feaL- uYe of the game, however,. atnd that was the base running ability :showed fuy the team, axrd if they had been only able tro Ioca1te the ball bt>Ner in batting the score f~:r ou~r side wou:ld hav€ been much larger than. i~It was. .As it was, om.e hit and one en·or scored. hvo runs for us. Han1 work frmn nnw on is atn absolute nece:s- sLty so that the team can get into proper con- dition to meet our other opponents \Yi th a litUe mm~e confidence. Captain Flowerfl, in speak~img for the track tearn, urged all the basketban meH to come ou. t and try for places on the track team. .Since they have had a w1ntan's training they sl-;rould be in fit shape to do l.V€11 on the tl~a.ck ~ this spring, and should be sur,e point winner~.

He said t'hat the :new suits f.or the 'Varsity team IV!Ould be here ihis week and that there would ihen be sufficie11t material to equip two full tean-:J:s. He also urged the .college men to bring aroond the \:fe1ninit1e eleHl.ent\ to the campus game9 th'is spring. On account of a Inisappreh~nsion, White, '0·7, made the statement that all tlu:e 1noney collected by special assessment for the tennis association had to pass throug-h the han<d.s of the athletk board, and was subject in the regular way 'to their supervision. Davis, '07, spoke unfavorably of the :press club, and especially of the ITI€ rn. bers of the co,I- lege reportorial staff on the local newspapers. He said that the account of th.e Williams game as it appeared in one of the Schenectady daiUes was a disgrace to Its author,. and showed an --------------~~~~--- ---------- ROBSON & ADEE BOOK MEN Schenectady and Saratoga e l I t .- (
