We had all been aware of similiar moves at neighbor- ing institutions within recent months and the feeling was common that Union would soon follow suit. The l vy pow- ers, possessors of tren1endous endowments and equally im- pressive fl.!rid raising organizations, t?ok the lead, to be followed by our contemporaries, IIam1lton, P..Pl nnd Col- gate, naming but a few. At all these schools, it was felt that alumni and foundation aiel was not sufficient to meet the rising costs of offering a college education, nnd that the student would luwe to bear a gi'eater portion of the burden. The need f<H additional moneys may be witnessed all about us. Facultv salarv increases remain the paramount concern. we must be able to attract and hold promising young professors as well as adequately compensate our present staff. Union's physical plant is in need of addi- tions other than the oft publicized library. The daily cost of upkeep, the items that range from fuel purchases to cffice supplies, has been on a steady upgl'ade that does not promise to level off in the near future. An extra $100,000 annually, the approximate s_um that 'hill be realized from the tuition increase, can only be a small part of the answe1· to our financial needs. Yet it is money that is necessary for immediate operating ex- penses and it cannot be denied. Before the colleg-e mny speak of building-, it must solidify the present plant - this is Union's most pressing- need at the beginning of 1957. FridaY, March 1, 1957_ \ Vermont, France Unite in A. Roberts By James Swan Carefully refiring a character- istically half\lit pipe (French briar), Assistant Professor of French language and literature Alan Roberts settled carefully back into a car-efully prepared lounging chair and thoughtfu.Jly planted the professorial feet on a handsome red-leather hassock. The chair, we should be told, be- longs to him, as well as the ·half- lit pipe, the hassock, the profes- sorial feet, and the red-with-white- trim ·house which surrounds the entire tableau. The clear indication is that Pro- fessor Roberts is a man with his feet set firmly on the ground,. as well as on the red-leather hassock. A Union prof since 191>2, '\'hen the -green prospect of salary increases Jured him over from the Univer- sity of Vermont, young (mid- thirties} Dr. Roberts has moved rapidly through the Union firma- ment, establishing himself as a faculty personality e-xtra:o-rdinaire.

In reading Charles W. Cole'-s article in the !March issue of HarpeiJs, Anierican Youth Goes Monogamous, I felt -that Dr. <Cole was not only accurately des-cri:b- ing the younger- generation's revolutionary pro.ctice of \steady\ dating, but was talking ~bout me in par-ticular. The article first outlines the distinctions between o-lder and the younger generation's dating halJ- its, the details o.f which are ·known by most. I suggest that Dr-. Cole's awakening- to the differences is late in our era, but maybe he just wanted t() make sure, or- he could not believe what he saw. The ·state-ment of young America's \courtship\ methods is· 11Jrief and simply stated, an appropriate style for what we consider to be a rather uncomp~ex system. jDr. Cole endeavors to communi- cate the meaning of such words as \going steady,\ \pinning and -pinned,\ and ''bird-dogging.\ It seems that our fathers, etc., cou-ld not settle on one girl for any 'J)er- iod of time, and persistently \bird- dogged\ each other, a practice wholly repugnant and contetr.qrl.u- ous to our generation. There were assumed t{l •be cer- tain advantages to the \ol-d fash- ioned\ ·way of doing thin-gs. \Play- ing the field\ was supposed to ed- ucate the young as to the ways and whims of the spe-cious op- posite sex. Dr. Cole intel-ligently points out that the revolutionary \system of pre-marital compan· ionship\ m;:ty serve as a solid and enduring foundation for later married life. One way of understanding the development or the present atti- tude toward da;tlng is to investi- gate the old attitude. In the \old days,\ big dances and proms were extremely ·popular aznong the young folk. At dances, practices like ''cutting in,\ \getting:_ stuek,\ \!being in the stag line,\ and hold- ing \a five doiiar bill ... behind the girl's back\ were Jlrevalent. In this light it seems J)erfec.tly reasonabl~ for the younger gen- eration of today to have devel- O'J)ed a monogamous system through which a dance is enjoyed, not in spite of one's date but :JJe- cause of het·. ('Our system is also five dollars cheaper.) Our ~ances a:re shorter-, less for-- ma:l, and -more relaxed affairs than were those of ·OU1' parents. The trend today is toward si1:Jtlng around and •listening to music or enter-tainment in the same even- ing tha-t the -dance is held. It must be admitted that Dr. Cole's ohservatio'll, \When you dance with only one partner, tl\iJ'O hours or so is en011gh,\ comes danger- ously close to truth. (But, then again, ~lll\ dances offer di:versified entertainment ... who wants to dance all nigh:t anyway!) There is an apparent connection between pr-e-marital monogamy and such things as the Second World War, ·generai upset in the world augmen-ting you:th''B desire for security Hn knowing exa'Ctly with whom one is going to do what) and pr-osperity. T'he G-I Bi-ll of Righ-ts introduced tnar-ried men to the colleg-e scene,' and thus made .possi·ble ali example of mon- ogamy ofor insecure youth to fol- low. Young marriage 'became po,pular. Prosperity ena.bled :par-- ents to support (\help\) t)le young couple, and sex: equality, as a prin- ciple, encouraged youthful Wives to contribute to the frumily in- co,me. .As specific as these causes appear, the origin of pre-marita:l monogamy is, nevertheless, vague. The observations made above :>trike close to home. I have been accused of practicing pre-marital monogamy merely for- purpose-s o,f gaining security. 1 So what! I ·have ·been warned that my choice of a Wife will lbe a poor one be- cause of iny \inexperience.\ I am not frlghtene·d; my cautioners have assun:<ed that my ·!)lind is closed-an inexcusable error. I stand, unshaken by the skeJ.!r tioal reaction-aries, !behind Dr. Cole's analysis, which he con- cludes IW'ith the bo:peful .specula- tion that pre-\IllaTital monogamy \may carry over into married life of marriage and the family.\ In light of ·the h-igh rate of lii'Vorce and separation Jlrevalent in the older generation, the Monogamy Revolution is, perhaps, the first and most important ·C{lntrilbutio.n that the youngeT generation has rr•ade to the stwbilizatlon of soci- ety. t PRINTERS I l ___________ ._ ______________________________ ___ RELIABLE 'RADIO SERVICE 736 State Street Phone EX 3-8668 Clocl' Portable Car <Next to Mohawk Chevrolet) Sales and Srrvicc on All Afakes RADIOS 1135 Barrett Street Hi Fi Sets Tape Recorders Serving the Finest in Italian-American Food Dl 6-9261 Baked Try Our Lasagna and Pizza Union Men ALWAYS Welcome Open: Noon - 3 A.

4 Sub-Frosh ••• (Continued from Page 1) advantage of this program lies in. the fa.ct that the prospective ap- plicants do not stay overnight and many more may be accom- modated. Several regional rallies will also' be held in the fall. Here, candi- dates who live too far from col-· lege to make a visit practical, will be able to gain information ab(mt, Union. In conjunction with this, Professor Harlow is presently en-. gaged in making a movie about the college which will be shown at the rallies. It is hoped that because these two events occur in the fall, they will achieve a larger measure of success than a March 'Sub-Frosh Weekend. By March or April, the hi~'h school senior has narrowed hiS selections to three or four col- leges at which he has applied. Sub-Frosh Weekend could only reinfm•ce this choice, or perhaps place Union in a highet· r~lati~e positi·on among the applicants preferences. The Engineering Open House and the regional ral- lies will serve the added purpose of convincing qualified seniors to make Union one of their choices.

Included in the hour and forty minute meeting were debates on the future of the Campus Chest and ,the Blotter issue. Presiden~ Davidson ·pointed out to the Council' that the reason !hat :Sub-Frosh Weekend '1\a:s be- mg abolished 111 as ·because the Admissions Department had al- Teady .exceeded its >budget limit. He went on to say that the Ad\ missions Office would su.pply names of su:b-freshmen to fra- ternities .that wished to invite them as weekend guests. As· chairman of the Activities Con ani ttee, R;onald Madsen re- ported that the Camp.us Chest -is \in a pretty disappointing state of affairs\ and the \outlook for the futul'e is very disrr•al.\ It's membership consists of five fresh- men and two sophomores. The group has no format minutes or financial reports. Lawrence Robertson, chairman of Campus Chest, \as unable to· give the committee an accurate financial accounting of the funds · and pledges, although the figures are a matter of puolic record in the Activities Office. In the discussion, it ·\\as sug- gested that the organization be dropped as an acti:vity and its function placed with another ser- vice organization such as the Gar- net Key S.ociety. Lynn Hinman argued that the chairman of the Canvus Chest should be a merr•1Jer of the Stud- ent Council. \Any organization becomes stagnant v.hen its mem- bership is entrenched in one fra- ternity.\ Hinman w·ent on to say that the same thing cou1d hap- pen to SUC!h activities as 'WRUC and the Concordiensis. The Council took no action be- cause the Chest's advisor, Pro- fessor Neal Allen, had nO't been contacted. Gerald DePass reported that only 29 students ha,ve not had their pictures taken for identifi- cation cards. He stated that the cards should be distributed within two weeks. Richard Marcott was unanim- ously elected National Stud- ent As·sociati:on chail'!ffian. He replaced D\'\ight Ball who resign- ed recently. Muucott plans to attend the NSA state ·Ineeting in But1falo apd was granted $15 for expenses. Professor Joseph Finkelstein, Coordinator of Student Activities, reported that the Faculty Coun- cil rejected almost unanimously the Student Council request to cancel classes ,saturday, April 20.

Although another 46 percent held the opinion that no change in the· present system was necessary, many professors be- lieved the cut system could 'be ll·beralized for UJpper-class:men. ·Lynn Hinman wa,s aippointed chairman o'f a committee to g'i'Ve the matter further study. -~-01--- Founded at llnion College in 1877 SCHENECTADY, N.Y., MARCH 8, 1957 New Blood Record Set· Blotter Issue .Discussed At SCMeeti~ng By Charles Carl One of the major items of dis- cussion at the :Student Council · meeting, March 5, revolved around the fa·c.t that the 1957 Blotter has not yet been distributed to the college community. At the meeting Michael Din- nocenzo, Chairman of the Stud- ent Coul),cil, requested that the · Blotter be completed \\!thin seven days and assured the Counci·l that · \the Blotter will make expenses.\ Student Coordinator 'Dr. Joseph Finkelstein, advised Dinnocenzo . that \it would be to his advantage · to complete the Blotter before the Publications Board meeting on .March 14.''

Eliot's Murder in the Cathe- dral are now in progress. The dramatization of the murder of Thomas Becket at Canterbury, which will run from April 24 through May 1, with the exception of Sun- day, April 28, is the first Mountebank attempt at a play of this type. It is primarily an actor's rath- er than a techni:colan's production. The sets will ·be simple, with on·ly black drapes covering the vari- ous levels of the set. The lines •are in verse and the grou'P is working to obtain a choral effect through the use of the various voices of the ca:st memlbers. ' Eliot's plays represent part of a movement in the 1920's to re- vitalize poeti'ca:l drama, an insti- tution dormant since the IDli:re- bethan era.

Interested upperclassmen are also VI elcome. President Davidson's statement in a letter wl'itten after the last tuition rise that \there shall be no further increases in tuition for students now in Union barring a national financial catastrophe;\ was largely responsible for the decision to exempt the classes of '58 and '59. No proportional scholarship in- crea.Se will be forthcoming as a result of the rise, as grants are made from fixed funds. A change in college pe>Jicy regarding awards was announce9 several weeks ago. Grants Remain Constant Under the new plan, scholar- ships in general will not be cut after the first two years. Money for this increase will come largely from funds specifically earmarked for- grants. The exemption of two classes from the increase will slash addi- tional revenue for next year al- most in half. This will limit, at least temporarily, faculty salary raises. In any case, the entire sum, which will eventually amount t<l' approximately $100,000 a year, will not be used exclusively for faculty salaries. Staff wages may also be revised upward; in addi- tion some of the money will go toward meeting increased oper- ating expenses. Trustees Revel'se Decision At a January meeting the Board of Trustees voted dO>Wn a proposed tuition irucrease. The matter was brought up again, however, after the Administrative and Faculty Councils approved an across the board rise. Faculty members voting for the measure felt that last year's four percent salary increase was not commensurate with the general rise ir.. the cost of llvmg. On the basis of an additional $100,000 . yearly revenue, faculty salaries could be raised 12 percent.

Acting lo'eatures 'Ll!Or Alumni Communication After almost two years of publication, we feel that the Union Review. the monthly alumni news-letter, should be re-evaluated as to purpose and effect. The present eight page format was introduced in September 1955 to replace the quarterly Alumni Review, a slick magazine of long standing. It was felt that the new publication would allow more frequent communication with the alumni body and could be produced at a significant financial saving. The prestige value of the Alumni Review was considered sub- ordinate to these factors. \Ha Letters to the Editor To the Editor of Concordipnsis: t With aJ;ologies to John Green- leaf Whittier> Blessings on thee. kindly sire, Who put the plank across the mire Where \\ e venture, almost daily, Ruin our shoes to get to Bailey, With our turned up pantaloons, Splattered mud about us strewn And our while bn ks, dark\'r stl:l Muddy College on the Hill.

Though its economy is unquestioned, doubts must arise as to the value of the Review as a repre- sentative of Union College. The format is unattractive and the content does not seem sufficiently newsworthy to merit the effort at quicker communication. There is too much of the air of the throw-away surrounding the Union Review. It hardly appears to be a publication that an alumnus would display in his home or office. The Concordiensis hopes that the Alumni Council and the Board of Trustees will again consider their aims as to the publication. We believe that the best interests of the college would be served by a slick quarterly. It is a format that will be more widely read and one that will present a more attractive and accurate representation of the school. Sv.amp~d To the Editor of Concordiensis: I v. as appalled by the letters of Fred Frank and Richard Lewis in the March 8 issue of Con- cordy. To start with, I v. ould think that a member of the stud- ent body of Unibn College v.ould l1now son•ething about mannets and decency. That does not seem to ·be the case. Perhaps these two were never taught anything about respect of those older and wiser than they. The results v.ere extremely gratifying in that 378 units of blood V\ere made available to ·OUr local hospitals for the benefit of their patients. During the past few yeal's the response of Union students to this progran • has been outstanding. So much so, that our figures indicate that per~en­ tage-wise, they have been con- tributors on a larger scale than the stuJent body of any of the other upstate colleges. The active support of your sta.ff and paper have been largely re- sponsible for this record, we be- lieve. In fact, the SUP•FOrt and cooperation this Chapter has re- ceived from the Concordiensis has alv.ays been outstanding and we are extremely grateful for their considerations.

Dartmouth Steps Ahead Late this week renowned Dartmouth College an- nounced to the waiting academic world sweeping reforms of its study procedure - reforms which dhould certainly merit consideration by Union planners and, in fact, the planners of all colleges of comparable size and station. The significant changes in Dartmouth's programmin<r machin- ery is in effect a complete reot·ganization of the term-sem- ester study program now operating both at Union and Dartmouth. By means of the new Dartmouth pl'Oposal, scheduled to take effect during the 1958-59 academic year, the pres- ent two-term yearly course of study will be revamped, be- coming instead a study program of three terms per year. As things appear in the blueprint stage, the suggested changes wrought at Hanover should have the effect of producing a major administrative revolution in college programming. Mr. Murphy deserves not only resper:t; he should be praised for his letter of constructive criti- cism. He gave reason for his ob- jections in a way that ·was not cheap. It is a shame Mr. Frank and Mr. Lewis d:d not follow his example. In any case, they Jb- viously did not get his r;oint.

Because this is true, the Rathskeller has been able to remain open and to make a small profit. There is one sour note in this otherwise harmbnious score which we feel must be mentioned. It seems that at least one and perhaps more students either want to see the Rathskeller closed or they have mental capacities below that of college level. There is valid reason for such a strong statement and we think the stu- dent body should be made aware of it. .. RITZ RESTAURANT OPEN DAILY II :00 to 12:00 CLOSED SUNDAYS Steaks.

The surface results of such a program are not startling: the student completes nine courses in a year's time instead of the usual ten (actually ten half-year courses). Every person to whom I have sJ;oken on the subject agrees that it was possible to display that issue to dates only with a sense of shan •e. A campus publicatiun represents its college. Copies of the Concordy are shown to sub- fresh, their parents, and many others, as well as to prom date~. Did you ever stop being impress- ed with your OVIn warped sense of humor long enough to realize what outsiders must have thought of Union as they read the prom paper? Mr. Lev.is' reference to Ulysses Three times in the last few months, willful acts of destruction were committed in the Rathskel- ler. The first was the complete destruction of the partitions in the men's room. The second was the tearing off of the wall of the cold water pipe in the men's room causing flooding of the Raths- keller and forcing us to close for 1-.--------------------------------' However. the effective and more deep-seated re- sults of such a study program means more than the loss of three Cl'edit hours of work per year (under the Dart·· mouth plan, the student would complete 27 credit hours per year instead of the 30 he normally completes both he1·e and at Dartmouth). It means that serious students will be able to apply themselves more concentratedly to thE' courses at hand, studying only three courses at one time instead of five. Other facets of the new Dartmouth program include a boosted emphasis on general reading for all students and a lessening of student-teacher dependence. The student- at-large, having more overall time to apply himself to any one course will consequently be able to demonstrate greater individual self-reliance in learning; he will be ex- pected, in other words, to deal more with real source mate- rials and less with time-consuming classroom sessions. This emphasis may be expected to broaden the latitude of the student's interests. It would also, incidentally, ease the toil and sweat of the examination gamut. The reasons for the institution of the three-term pro- gl·am at Dartmouth (which was the result of two years of preliminary investigation) are sundry: (1) increased de- mand for higher education; (2) decreased availability of qualified college teachers; ( 3) the necessity for more . logical division of the academic year. The proposed three- term plan will solve, or help to solve, the first two prob- lems by decreasing the ratio of students to teachers; it will solve the third by dividing the year into three logical divisions: September to Christmas, January to Eastet·,· Easter to June.

The final act occurred last Sat- urday at the Jazz Concert when the hot water pipe was torn loose in the men's room and a repeat of the second incident occurred. The cost of these incidents has been very high In labor, parts, and loss of business. While the total cost is not known, it could be high enough to reverse the recent financial success of the Rathskel- ler. Whether the guilty party realizes this or not, the incidence of this vandalism may lead to a rise in prices to the student b{)dy. We have tried to show you that tl'le problem is a serious one.

The Rathskeller problems as those whkh Dartmouth hopes to solve might do well to examine in detail the benefits of Dartmouth's venture. Another avenue of study which might be fol- lowed by Union's planners and visionaries is the so-called Oberlin Plan, under which students would spend half of each semester (as now divided) in absentia, at work on individual research projects or study programs. In any event, the new Dartmouth plan is one worthy of close and considerate examination as perhaps the clear- est attempt to solve the problem of cramped collegiate schedule~ and tired, overworked professors. Hanover, New Harr~pshue, may he remembered by future academic gen- erations. as the place where once the embattled educators stood and fired the shot heard round the collegiate world. · · J.E.S. AtM.

More than 30 members of Union teams, their coaches and Athletic Director Bill Ketz attended a forum on athletics Monday evening, March 11 in Hale Hm:1se Lounge.

The fact that many well trained students can have active places on a Union team was stressed as a strong selling point to high schools.

We could not believe that Wednesday came and went withottt so much as a word concerning that most contro- versial of recent topics, the take-off on Shakespeare in the Mardi Gras IV prom issue. Is there no one on campus who has further words of wisdom on this crucial issue? What must we do to awaken the readers of this newspaper from their armchairs of apathy? For several \veeks, we had high hopes that those at Union had come to a realization of the truly pressing issues on campus. Such relatively unimportant topics as tuition rises, the Bl()ttet· controversy, pledge trip revisions, a new lilm.ny, and the :\liddle States Evaluation were rele- gated to thei!' proper positions and left out of the picture entire h. Althoug·h it appem·s that the resurgence of intellect which briefly illuminated these pages has come to an end, and lack of interest again rules, we can look hack with pride to the past three weel\s.

STATE STREET & B'W AY Arnold Fisher, '50 ••what really sold me,\ says Jerry, \was the way they conducted engi· neering. I'd expected rooms full of engineers at desks. Inste!ld, I found all the informal friendliness of my college lab.\ Gerald, an E.E., came directly to IBM from the University of Buffalo, in 1953. Starting as a Technical En- gineer, he was immediately assigned to work, with two others, on design- ing a small calculator. The supervisor of thisproject was Dr. R. K. Richards, author of \Arithmetic Operation in Digital Computers.\ Jerry learned a great deal abont computers in a very short time. Incidentally, his partic- ular maehine is now going into pro· Acslgnc problems· to· his group duction. As Jerry: says, \It makes an engineer feel good to see his project reach the production stage~and to be able to follow it through.\ Promoted to Associate Engineer after 16 months, Jerry is now the leader of a nine-man team. He as- signs problems to his group for solu- tion, approves their block diagrams and the models they build. Perhaps an hour a day goes into paper work such as requisitioning equipment for his group and reviewing technical publications, in counseling members of his team and preparing for trips to technical soeiety meetings. Apart from his regular responsibilities, he teaches at night in the IBM school. Why Jerry chose IBM Of course, there were other reasons why Jerry .selected IBM. He was vitally interested in computers, and IBM was obviously a leader in the field. He contes from a scientiftcfamily Friclayi Mar<:h 22, 1957 \What's it like to be A PROD'UCT DEVELOPMENT ENGINE,ER AT IBM?'' Three years ago, college senior Gerald Maley asked himself this,question. Today, an Associate Engineer and leader of a nine-man team, Jerry re- views his experience at IBM and gives some po_inters thc:d may be helpful to you in taking the first, most important step in your- engineerhtg career. (his brother is a mathematician) and is fascinated .by these mathematical marvels which are revolutionizing man'sways of doing things in so many fields. He enjoys working on large equipment .•. and on \pulses.\ \It's more logical,\ he says. \In computer This field IJ so new work, you can aett!a.lly see things happening, which is Mt the case with all electronic equipment today. And it's not all solid math, either. What's more, this field is so .new, that pretty soon you're up with everybody else.\ Gerald has done reeruiting work himself for IBM and believes he un- derstands some of the .college senior's problems. \I usually begin an inter- view by determining a man's inter- Revl•wlng lechnical puhllcallanc est,\ he reports. \'!'hen the diversity of work at IBM enables me to offer him a job which 'Will challenge that interest.\ Gerald distinguishes be- tween two kinds of engineers,.-those who like-to wor-k oneomponents, such as cireuit designs, and tho!!e who are. interested in the part the component plays. The latter is his own interest, which is why he is in advanced ma- chine de~ign. He points <>ut that IBM is eareful to take these factors into consideration-another reason, per· haps, why turnover at IBM is less than one-sixth the national average. What about promotions'? When asked about advancement opportunities at IBM:, Jerry says, \You can hardly miss,in this field and in this company. Th\)y tell me sales about double every five years- which in itself makes promotion almost axi- omatic.\ Heendorsesthe IBM policy of promoting from within, with merit the sole criterion. The salary factor, he remembers, was not his first con- sideration. While excellent, the tre- mendous adva:p.cement potential was of far greater importance.
