A much smaller, yet . noticeable group of applicants consis_ted of clergymen, including defrocked priests and a cantor. Assurances that they had not mistaken Union College for Union Theological Seminary were expressed by Dean Wylen. A noticeable number of lawyers also applied for the position.

Previous administrative job experience and familiarity with a small liberal arts institution like Union were two important criteria established by the committee. Evidence of an academic background and a youthful, \dynamic outlook\ were also desirable qualities ~stablished for the evaluating process. by BILL TALIS have an obligation to alert the students as to what is going on · concerning financing- their education.~· the Nixon Administration is calling for $622 million to fund this program, which is short of the estimated $1.2 billion needed to support such a far-reaching program. The problem is that in the format called for by the Nixon Federal aid in the form of scholarships and student loans at Union College next year is seriously . jeopardized bY the Nixon Administration's proposed implementation of a new concept in higher educatiOll aid, the Basic Opportunity Grant (BOG). BOG -yvas designed as a supplement to the existing federal programs of National Direct -Student Loan (NDSL), Economic Opportunity ' Grant (EOG), and College Work- Study (C'.VS). The Education Amendments Act of I 973, which nas been authorized by Congress, stipulates that the NDSL, EOG, anq. CWS are to be funded before the implementation of BOG, yet the Administration has reduced the legislated appropriation for the College Work Study, and is requesting termination- of the :National Direct Student Loan and Economic Opportunity Grant programs. The Basic OpportunitY. Grant is Administration, BOG would spread itself too thin, and would not have the funds to back its guarantee of $1,400. Rather, the appropriations that the Administration is calling for ~ay only be able to guarantee up to $400 or $500, as many fear. In the February 23rd issue of Concordy, Mr. Maras stated that there was \a great degree of 1mcertainty\ regarding the institution of the BOG program. If the Administration's proposal is accepted by Congress, Mr. Maras says that, \what that impact will be on Union is hard to assess, but there will be some impact on the aid students will be able to obtain.\ Present plans of Congress are such , that BOG would be iittplem¢nted in the 1973-74 ·scnelastic year. The termination of NDSL and EOG hinges on a Supplemental Appropriations Bill now before Congress that would fund all four programs. \The students' response is hopeful and could be instrumental in maintaining the funding for the Act already passed by Congress,\ says Mr. Maras. The process of determining which applicants ·would be brought on campus was described by Dean Wylen as \extremely selective.\ The committee, which Dean Wylen expressed as working \harmoniously and hard\ together, selected four candidates, three of whom have academic backgrounds in · such areas as history, sociology, and psychology. The fourth candidate has a doctorate in Education. The Dean of Students is responsible for non-ac,;r,.;r. ·-: areas of student life. Sho .. :rt a. suitable candidates be founu for Dean of the College, whose responsibilities are both academic and non-academic, the committee would make recommendations for such. If the administration should seeK. to fill the latter post instead of Dean of Students, another candidate froin on campus, David Ports, Assistant Professor of History, shall also be considered for the position. According to · Dean Wylen, applicants' folders, which consist of their resume, a covering letter,. and letters of recommendation,' were rated as plus, zero, or minus, indicating good, borderline, or reject. Those receiving two or more minuses by committee With the Provost wanting recommendations by the end of this· month, if not sooner, Dean Wylen is confident the committee will be able to suggest a few names. Final decision on the appointment of the Dean of Students will be by the Provost and President Martin. \I do regret leaving the people here, however,\ he stated. He praised the ''superb\ abilities of Mrs. Lorraine Marra and Mrs. Audrey Snowden and appreciates their loyalty and skills in working with students. C.ontinued on-page 2 Student Center Opening April 16th The Idea of a student center has long been a goal at Union College. Now it looks as though this goal is being accomplished. According to Mr. Harold Usher, Director of Business and Facilities Operations, Andrew Carnegie Hall will be open on Monday, April 16, but the concept of a College Center has a long way to go. Unfortunately, not very much will be ready for the students' use and this year's seniors will probably forget, ten years hence, that a College Center was on campus. Various questions have been asked about the Center: What will be finished by Aprill6? Much of the physical work (repairs) in Carnegie will be done by the opening date. Mr. Mills (Maintenance) said, \Most of the ri'l\airs were simply complying with health and fire codes.\ Bathrooms will be rebuilt on the third floor and basement, the cc.~.lter stairwell was taken down and now ·there are two side stairwells. The Strauss Lounge will be partially finished, game rooms will be set up with a possible pool table or two. The snack bar will be set up with temporary furniture. Why is the Library Council in the building now, and why are they .staying? The Library Council was allowed temporary use of some rooms in Carnegie until they find another building to hold their office. The agreement is that they will not be in this building by next fall. Who will be in charge of the College Center? Dave Gestwick (Class of 1972) has been hired to take the responsibility of the College Center for the remainder of the year until a new Dean of Students is hired, according to Provost Enteman. Will any jobs be available? Money has been appropriated for 100 man-hours of work per week to be used with Student Aid and grants. Students will be hired as guards. Hours open? The center will be open seven days a week, from noon until 2:UO A.M. Where did the monev come from? Gifts and grants. How much money has been appropriated, and how much has been spent? $200,000 toward the building operation; $194,000 has been spent , a new concept in higher education aid, and ideally is of a more far- reaching nature than existing pr.ograms. The program calls for the entitlement of up to $1,400 for every student minus what the family may be able to contribute. For example, if the family could contribute $600, then the government would guarantee $800. However, according to the Administration's proposal, BOG has many shortcomings. BOG would reach farther than the existing programs, and would for the first ti.me encompass a guarantee of funds fo·r proprietary institutions. The impact of spreading aid into this ~ector of higher education is unpredictable, for it is uncertain just how many students the aid will reach because of possible enrollment increases in those institutions. Mr. Joseph T. Maras, Director of Student Aid, informs the students that r ess is presently debating t.oW much money will go into the Education Amendments Act and where it will be apportioned, and is fearful of the cancellation of existing programs. \I feel that I Candidates for Dean of Students will be on campus Monday, April 9th, Tuesday, April 10th, and Wednesday, April llth. Students wishing to meet David Potts on Monday, Mark Smith on Tuesday, and Stanley Hayward on W ~dnesday are urged to come to Hale House Student Lounge at 4:00 p.m. · on those days. members havl..: been placed in a rejection pile, while those receiving two or more pluses are considered for interviewing. Noting that the committee has its biases, Dean Wylen intends to personally re-read all folders rejected by the committee before sending oUt notices to that effect. Of the people applying £or the position of Dean of Students, committee members noticed three distinct groups. The first group, Dean Wylen explained, consisted of a very lavge number of persons who had gune or are going ti}rough a program leading to a , as of 4/4f73. $25,000 toward Strauss Lounge; $16,000 has been spent as of 4/4/73. $50,000 toward WRUC from the Green Fund; $ .00 has been spent at the present time. (Figures supplied by Mr. Mills in Maintenance.) The center has a great deal of potential. Although very few facilities will be open .;; the students, this does not mean the Center cannot be used at all. i>arties may be held there and other social activities. The ima:m.n ... n is unlimited, but the budget is not. With these two criteria ir. n.ind, ideas are ne~ded to make this year and the following years successful in the College Center. -.

Page2 CONCORD lEN SIS, Friday, April 6, 1~7~ Pinch It is accepted practice that this statement present the · philosophies of the new Concordiensis stH;ff. We do not, however have the time nor the space for such exposition. We ask you to judge us by our actions. * * * * There is a situation that is rapidly coming into focus w~ich demands comment. lt deals with money, student's money, and basic educational philosophy. We ask you to refer to the article on page 1 dealing with financial aid. It is our firm conviction that a qualified individual should have the opportunity to attend an institution of higher learning should that individual so d:esire .. The proposed federal financial aid structure seems, to us, to run counter to this philosophy. The Basic Opportunity Grant system appears to drastically reduce the financial aid pool of the federal government. It is, in theory, a sound proposal. Yet it is the reality of this profound reduction in available monies that prompts us to believe that the B.O.G. structure is not an acceptable one. It would create a climate in which equality of opportunity could not exist. It is, by its very nature, discriminatory. It is economic reality that the cost of a college education is far above what the majority of Americans can afford. To deny these prospective students an education for· financial reasons is an unconscionable act. Certainly questions are raised concerning the ordering of priorities by the present administration. However, if we hold this question in abeyance we are confronted with a specific course of action that, if followed, would provide the opportunity for more federal aid to be made available to colleges and universities. There are bills pending in Congress that would provide these additional monies. We are of the mind that the action warranted at present is communication to elected officials on the part of students and their parents urging them to support these additional allocations. When one is aware that it is student aid money of which we speak and of the very real impact of the proposed B.O.G. system on the profile of student populations, an act such as this seems a small commitment indeed - a small commitment that may prove extremely effective. Letters To the Editor: As seniors about to graduate from Union, we feel ·both some sense of pride and a sense that the College still needs help in order to become a more complete community. We would like to do something to aid the College in this time of financial strain. We propose to set up a Class of 1973 Fund, financed by contributions from various individual sources, to be used for a purpose decided upon by contributing members of the class. The Fund could amr possibly be named in the memory of Kelvin A. Cook, a classmate who died suddenly last November. The Cook family has suggested that such- a Fund· be used for a scholarship to aid disadvantaged students. Other alternatives include a Library book fund, an outright gift to the College, or anything else other seniors might suggest. To develop the Fund, we see three sources. Seniors can decide not to purchase a cap and gown for Commencement and donatate that $9.40 to the Fund. All entering freshmen reserve a place in their class with a refundable matriculation deposit ($50 in 1969). That sum of money (minus CONCORDIENSIS founded at Union College in 1877 • .. -- . 'lt.

COMING ATTRACTION ~ Annual Fund Alumni Office Publication (includes catalogue) Development An examination of the Resident $75;000* Advisor selection process. $30,000 *Projected $16,000 for magazine. · Alumni Perhaps the most interesting figure is that of the $16,000 f<>r a projected Alumni magazine. Several years ago the publication of Symposium was terminated as too costly an adventure, despite its overwhelming popularity. When the new · Vice..:President assumes office he will ponder the feasibility of disbanding the present U n.ian College Chronicle and. . establishing an Alumni magazine. However this will not be a rebirth of Symposium. · Funded in each division's · proposed budget above is a total figure of $15,025 for postage and mailing costs. Phil Johnson, the College's News Officer; explained the reason for the high failure in his office as follows: \Most of our expenses in the operation of our office come from postage costs.\ The Alumni Affairs Office, the Public ~lations Office, and the AnnJJal Fund carry out their function almost exclusively. through the mail. Much of the ten percent reduciion in the proposed 1973-74 budget wi.ll be felt in this area. Another large expense is in the purchase and usage of paper. The Office uses over 200 cartons of paper per year (excluding the catalogue, which is done under special c.ontract) amounting to approximately 1,000,000 sheets. Mary Van Loan, Supervisor of Office Procedures, buys the cheapest quality paper available to do the job. With the exponential increase in the }>rice of pulp her task is becoming exceedingly more difficu It. However, there is still a great waste of paper as was seen when the distribution of \Union's Week;' was cut earlier in the J. S.

Some of those assignments were not made until this past fall by this year's c_ommittee and according to Don Foley (Vice President of the Student Body and a member of the Committee on Committees); this should not happen again. Last year the problem was the lack of time to interview all the applicants along with the methods used in the selection process. The Committee on Committees is composed of four class represt-ntatives from the Steering Committee and the Vice President of the Student Body. This committee's function is to take into account individual preferences for committee assignments and the-n select students for appropriate ~ollege, Faculty, and Student committees. This year's Committee on Committees has set up some new rules and methods to follow in their selection process. They are: I) Those people applying may apply for three different committees, indicating first, second, and third choice. 2) Interviews will be conducted in groups of four or five applicants in the presence of four or five committee members. A question or problem will be posed to the group. Selection will be based on the responses of the applicants. 3) Committee on Committee Continued on page 4 history of Indian-White affairs, if is hard for newspapers, including the N.Y. Times, to report such events objectively. The Indians who took over the reservation did not do it primarily to portray the plight of the Indian in the United States. The Indians of one reservaiion are fighting for the individual rights they think they deserve. A stalemate had been reached in the negotiations between Washington and the Sioux until last Thursday. Then a six-point agreement was reached. The Agreement, however, has not been enacted due to a technicality in the working of the document. The Indians demanded that the U.S. government investigate the tribal government now existing on the reservation, which was set up in 1934 by the Indian Reorganization Act. This act imposed an election system on all Indian nations. It was a big step forward for the Indians since it allowed each reservation to have its own government. It also meant, however, that the U.S. government could dictate the system of elections. Presently, the Indians at Wounded Knee feel that the tribal government is corrupt and incompetent. Originally they demanded the removal of the government, since the U.S. government had instated the election system. They wanted to return to the original Sioux system in which the ruler was chosen by a combination of blood ties and .personal courage. The Indians, however, have agreed to let the tribal government remain if it is th-oroughly investigated. Another point in the six-point agreement formulated last week Continued on page' 2 This past summer, our graphic arts workshop made movies of our trip to Washington. The Street Theater workshop had several performances in the area and were on T.V. a couple of times. C: What works does the Street Theater perform? U, .B.: Some of the students write their own plays. Sometimes the group performs innovative and spontaneous works. Many of t~e plays performed were those ·written by minority playwrights. C: What do you think the students learned from their trip to Washington? U. B.: Our students, for the most part, haven't had the opportunity to travel very far from their own areas. WasHington is a place they bave studied from the time they began school, so it gave them a chance to travel and to actually see what they've learned. In addition, Congressman Stratton was there and met the students. . C: How does Upward Bound prepare students to go to college? U. B.: One reason Upward Bound is always connected with a college campus is to use the college · facilities which are available. We assist students in scheduling college prep courses in their sophomore and junior years of high school, in place of the vocational or business classes they may have been taking, so they will be better prepared for college level courses once they enter college. C: What do the students do after their high school graduation? U. B.: Then they go into the Bridge program which is to help them make a much smoother transition from high school to college, and to give courses for college credit when possible, so as to lessen the initial course loads they would ordinarily take. The students get a sample of college courses before they enter. This year we're planning to have our Bridge program at Schenectady Continued on page 2

Pagel CONCORDJENSJS, Tuesday, AprillO, !973 Wounded Knee- U Upward Bound The following is taken from the text of Marlon Brand<J's speech prepared for the Oscar ceremonies. where Branda, through Shasheen Littlefeather, refused the award: \For 200 years we have said to the Indian people who . are fighting for their· land, their life, their families and their right to be free: 'Lay down your arms, my friends, and then we will ·remain together. Only if you lay down your arms, my friends, can we then talk of peace and come to an agreement which will be .good for you.' American Indian. The conditions which sparked the Wounded Knee take-over are not confined to South Dakota, but are found on reservations throughout the country, including those in New York State. With the exception of two small reservations on Long Island, all of the reservations in New York a(e part of the lr0quois -Confederacy, the \capital\ of which is the Onondaga Nation, located just south of Syracuse. For the past several years the Onondaga people have been engaged in a struggle with New York State over the possession of 24 wampum belts, which were illegally taken from them. These belts. the oldest of which dates back to the 14th century, tell the history of the tribe and record several important treaties. In addition to their historical value. the Onondagas also believe that they have a tremendous spiritual value. and that the Nation cannot be considered \whole'' until they are returned. At this time most of the belts are stored in the cellar of the State Museum in Albany. The State originally refused to return the belts on the grounds that they were a part of the entire state's heritage and should remain in Albany, where they were easily accessible to schoolchildren. Besides the fact that most of the belts ate .not accessible. such a position ignores the Onondaga children and their heritage .. The State finally agreed to return 5 or 6 of the belts to the Onondagas, :provided they constructed a museum {with 110 State aid') which would meet standards set by the State. The Onondagas have undertaken such a project. but a·re desperately in need of funds. Therefore. for ·the next few weeks, -there will be collection cans in Hale House and West College during lunch, and in the library. The money collected will be sent to the Onondagas through Dave Stineback's Comp Ed class on the American Indian. Considering the relatively privileged position we find ourselves in, would it be asking too much for each of us to contribute at least one dollar over the next two or three weeks? If anyone is interested in helping out or wants further information, call Jay O'Brien at 372-0145. Colltinuedfrom page 1 students at Union at th·is tune. County Community College.

The Sioux claim that the U.S. has broken this treaty which guaranteed possession of the Black Hills to the Sioux Nation. The Black Hills range from Western South Dakota to Eastern Wyoming. Six yeats after the treaty \!(as signed the land was stolen by the whites, after gold was discovered. General Custer had marched his troops into the territory and confirmed the existence of gold. Later on the Indians were divided into reservations, which they also feel was unjust. Prof. Stineback agreed that it is impractical for the U.S. to .return the Black Hills to the Sioux. He feels. however, that there-is some land that has religious m~aning for all American Indians and is of no value to the whites.

The surface is complicated; Bread and Puppet Theatre is an attempt at getting undern.eath. Originally fmm New York City, where they evolved as a str.eet theatre, the. Bread and Puppet Theatte is a way of life, a contmcums workshop 'in sculpture-, mime, dance, music, storymaking, and puppet-'buirding. ,It has performed in cities and universities all across the U.S. and in a dozen European coUntries. On S~tur~ay, April 28, the Arts Department (with a little help from their fnends, the Mountebanks and the Lectures and Concerts Committee) is presenting the internationally-renowned troupe in a performance of its new play, \The Fourteen Stations of the Cross.'' The show is a dramatization of the Easter story, using ten-and twenty-foot puppets, masked players and actors, a female Christ, arid a chorus singing Sacred Barp Hymns, among other things.

So far, the funds necessary for the continuation of Hebrew lO II ' ' and I 2 for next year have not been appropriated. Fall term ofthis academic year, Hebrew 10 students found out that the College did not plan to continue with Hebrew ll and 12 in the coming Winter and Spring terms. Many students were upset by this pro.posed discontinuation of Hebrew ll and 12, and strong protests were made to the administration. Finally, Hebrew II and 12 were reinstated with the provision that the entire Hebrew program be reviewed at the end ot the year. -Hebrew has now been in review for at least two months. First of all. the Curricular Affairs Ad Hoc Committee on Judaic Studies formulated an opinion on the continuation of Hebrew. A letter from the Ad Hoc Cornmittee to the Curricular Affairs Committee stated in part, \In view of the fact tevrs Dave's' Mens Shop 453 State St. (downtown Schenectady) that, of the four parts of the Judaic Studies Program - the Com:pr.ebensive Education Course. the History Course, The Terin in Israel. and the Language Courses - only the last one, having been involved in recent administrative decisions precipitating ~ minor student crisis. has its status in question, the Ad Hoc O:~mmittee has concerned itself mainly with the language offerings. \It Is the carefully considered opinion of the Ad Hoc Committee that the .language courses have considerable merit and are valuable enough to warrant their continuation up to at least the Hebrew 12 level. Accordingly, the Committee recommends: ( I) that Hebrew I 0, Hebrew II. and Hebrew 12 be retained as they are described in the current catalog~ further, (2) that a course in Hebrew and Jewish Literature he added; finally, ( 3) that these· courses be allowed to run until the school year 1974-1975, and are to be reviewed during the Fall of 1974.'' Curricular Affairs Committee voted on the Ad Hoc Committee's three proposals with 9 yeas: and 3 abstentions (several CAC members left prior to the vote). These proposals were then brought before the College Senate where they were also voted on and approved. Boulevard Diner .CHARCOAL STEAKS SEAFOOD HAMBURGERS TOTALLY REMODELED WE.EKDAYS FRI. & SAT.

Sot.h Hebrew 10 and Hebrew 11 were the largest language .courses at Union College in tlae Fall and Winter terms respectively. Meanwhile. the Curricular Affairs Committee can only work within the academic budget. In order to institute a new course. therefore, another course must be dropped. Rather than cut another course, CAC sent Hebrew to the Budget and Priorities Committee which woTks with the entire school budget. Budget and Priorities the.n decided it was CAC's job ·to find funding for Hebrew. and sent it back there. So, while each committee feels it is another committee's responsibility to find funding for Hebrew. Hebrew still remains unfunded for next year.

Page4 CO}/CORDJENSIS. Tuesday. April /0, 1973 -------------------------------------------~----------------------------~---- Union Breaks Track Records Back on March 17th, when most of us were . either cramming for exams or heading for the beaches of Florida to catch some rays. St. Lawrence University was hosting the 8th Annu~l New York State Collegiate Track and Field Association Indoor Championships. Thirteen events were scheduled. Nine records were broken; four Union records were among the nine. A glowing two-mile relay team, Crawford Cutts, Greg Hamlin, Mark Mindel, and. Ti~ McCabe, sped tQ a 7:52.3 state and UCol record. The Garnet mile relay team, Dave Ricks, Freddie Pressley, David White, and anchorman McCabe, set a new state mark as they combined f01: a 3:26.5 clocking. McCabe set out on his own to capture the 600' yd. run in 1:13:8-, bettering former teammate Rich Jaszczak's 1972 state r-ecord. After the bar was raised to 13 only Cortland's Dave Lander and Union's Dave Ricks remained in competition in the pole vault. The battle continued upward to 14'4';. Ricks was eliminated after missing at 14;4\ three times, ·his only three misses of the day: Lander, who was almost finished at 13 '6 ·~ cleared 14 1 4 ,,. to claim a Cortland State, Leithead Field House, and N.Y. State record. Ricks' second place height of 14'1\ established a new Union College record. Shot putters Bill Mowery and At Gilewicz picked up team points, placing second and~ fifth with distances of 50 4 4% rand 45 1 4:W; respectively. After numerous meetings freshman Milt Herring edged out Cortland's Mike Lawrie in the short sprint. Both crossed the finish in 6.4 seconds but Herring was credited with the win, and another Union College record. Until the running of the 1000-yard run it looked like another Union vs. Cortland battle. Then Colgate brought in first, second and third places for 13 team poi\}ts and a guaranteed win with 42 points over Union's 35. Cortland sat third with 28 points. This Saturday marks the opening of the 1973 outdoor track season as the Dutchmen travel to Wesleyan. Joining and rejoining the wealth of thinclad talent from the winter team will be several new and just as many familiar faces. Bill ''Floater\ Clayton and 1972 Outdoor State Champ in the triple jump, Pete Walrath, both of whom were forced to sit out most of the indoor season recovering from injuries, will return to once again add to total team strength. Returning junior Brad Patterson and freshman Mike Cortez will be joining John DeStefano and Walrath in the long and triple jumps. Milt HerriQg will take on sprinting duties together with veterans Jerry Cuffey and . Chris Doulides. Tracey Rich will join Hening, Cuffey, and Doulides to compose a possibly untouchable 440 yd. relay team. Rich will also ,tackle the 120 yd. high hurdles along with freshtnan \Cleet\ Boyer. Doubling in events Bob Baribeall is a likely candidate for the 440 yd. intermediate hurdles in addition to his pole vaulting. Dave Ricks will continue vauldng in attempt to repeat his 1972 outdoor championship as well as add to the mile relay team. Joining David White in the open 440 yd. dash will be frosh Joe Zolner of freshman football fame. Junior Mark Mindel and senior Gteg Hamlin will break from 1000-yd. run pace to .compete in the 880 and mile runs. Tim McCabe will be an ever present threat in the 880 and mile relay as well as in the' quarter mile and the mile. Freshman Steve \'Jonesy\ Jones will once again feel the responsibilities of distance man for the outdoor crew. Je>illing the wieghtmen, Bill Mowery. and AI Gilewicz, will be Pete Sherman. Slu:rman who copped the Tntrafraternity Shot Put ti1:le will take on the discus and hammer throws. Gilewicz will return to take over javelin duties in the absence of versatile Mike Rich, who was ruled ineligible to compete as a first year .graduate student.. Rich's absence will also be felt in the high jump leaving senior Stan Jackson and John De Stef~no to take on opponents. Coach Ken Michaelson does not doubt the talent of his group, he only hopes that they can gel into a polished team by Saturday to face Wesleyan. Wesleyan is probably the toughest team Union will meet in their first few encounters. Last year Williams fell to the Connecticut attack. Michaelson remains confident for the Dutchmen . have proven themselves indoors and, with a little help from the weather, they'll be dynamite outdoors. Committees Continued from page 1 members will be eligible to apply for a position, but will not be permitted to sit in on the selection of that particular committee's decision. These people will be treated as any other applicant. 4) Only applicants and Committee on Committees members will be present during the interview periods of which should be approximately fifteen minutes in length. 5) Students without good reason for being absent will be dropped from the list of consideration. Bruce Sostek, a member of the Commitfee on Committees, stressed that, \Each committee needs good workers, not just the more popular ones.\ He then mentioned, \We made the limit - three applications to make sure the applicant thought carefully about which committee he wished to serve on and the order of the committees he prefers ..

Friday, April13, 1973 20 c~nts Vol. l'O:i~ No. 40 ------------~---------~--~--~----~--------------------------------~------------- Review Glee Club By B:EN NET FITZ-A LAN- HOWARD ' On April. 9th. the Union College Glee Club and the powerful Mt. Holyoke Chamber Singers performed Johann Sebastian Bach's \Passion According to St. John.\ which is one of Bach's more traditional works. Bach wrote four Passions. two of which have been lost: t,hc remainii1g two arc the St. John and St. Matthew Passions. The St. John is the earlier. the simph;r. and conforms to the Schut:!: and cady settings of the Passion bv the Renaissance masters of music. There were many good things about the performance: the orchestra was not too bad. the soH were quite good except for some pitch errors by Arthur Thompson (as Christ). who made them in his few unaccompanied passages. notably the scene on the cross. The Evangelist was the brightest character of the concert. Douglas Perry's intelligible fHOnunciation of the lyrics was remarkable and his singing was piercing and .:-ffectivc. Mr. Kibler's singing was fine: his powerful voice at many points was the onlv audible one of the Union male ·chorus. The Holyoke Singers often o\\crpowcrcd the male choir. The ladies' pronunciation of the Gc1'man was gi.1od, cspcdaUy the most obvious words which the Union choir pro~nounc.ed incorrectlv. In ieh. mich. micht. etc.. the .. (ch) sound was pronoutlccd as .. (sh). which if sung thusly would hinder the flow of the music and is very unpleasant to hear. The tempi were fine to good. at some points. a It hough in the last Soprano Air the orches.tra and sol() were not together. As to the choral tempi. they were quite energetic. nmyhc tvo energetic at times. The first chorus. the last one. and t'hc chomls were cxtremcl\' drv and without the cnmti~m ·rcpr~scnted i11 the words. which leads me to sa\' that the performance was mec11anical and did 11ot express the feelings portrayed in the words of the Passioi1. Further. one can suv that the singers themselves. or m~iny of them. did not understand the mcssiage. thusly did not transmit it to the audience. This. obviously. is the fault of the conductor. The tenor section was, at manv points M entangled chon;l singing. Inaudible: the llasses had the same problem, but they had the Violoncello and ContrabasS\ doubling them. plus the power of Keith Kibler's nlice. The soprano and alto sect,ions were clcur and 4Uitc t1udihle. especially in the chorals and the forte ar.d fortissimo passages they were the only Yoices nudible fmm the halcon\·.

John Spanier. noted political scientist and author of American Foreign Policy Since World War II and Politics of Disarmament, spoke concerning the theory of Tripolarity in International Politics. The world which Spanier envisions is one of three great powers. the Soviet Union. China. and the United States. \Essentially I sec that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. will remain adversaries into the 19XO's and both the United States and China will sec the Soviet Union as a major opponent and will move closer together.\ Spanier believes that neither Japan nor Western Europe will play a major role in world security. \World powers require a certain degree of capability and motivation.\ he says. \which these economic powers lack.\ The Tripolar system is Prof: -Fenno, a Politicq/ Sciem·e Lester Fund Speaker, is author of several books, his most recent being \Congressmen in Committees: A Comparative View.\ He has also written several essays which have appeared in the \New York Times Magazine\ and the \American P()iitical Science Review,\ the latter of which he was formerfr hook rel'iew editor. :·~~~~~: .. ~·~··~·· theoreticallv more stable than a Bipolar (tW\o-power) system. \In a Tripolar system. presumably no two powers would want to engage in nuclear waT because the third power would he left supreme.\ While the greatest fear' of the Bipolar world was \that of a Investigations and Analysis Due to technical difficulties beyond my control the Resident Ad·visor Comedy Hour will not be seen until the first week in May.

I mvsdf admit that the prohlems (n the registration process · emcd to be emanating from i.. however. after the investigation a blanket condemnation was not the coa\clusion I reached. I will attempt to present the methods employed by the Registrar. the resulting problems that occur and the plausible .solutions that arc available. By OON KRONE emphasized. ..especially when some classes .increase by over 50 percent from the tentative class list.\ . Upon checking with Greene at the Bookstore the book ordering process and the difficulties that follow shed more light on the situation. Greene opened saying. '\The trend across the country is open registration. There is absolutely no way of determining the number of books that will be needed for anv course.\ ltis guidelines fo.r purchasing materials follows three lines. '\trends of the past. the profcssor·s beliefs. and a hell of a lot of hindsight.\ Next fall the Textbook Exchange Service willhe utilized. enabling Union to possibly pick up needed books and aid other colleges if the Bookstore has an overllow. However. with the 20 percent returns privilege now being used b~ publishers. extra books can be held for future sale nr sold back for shredding, Only 20 rcrcent of the total business done with a company can be returned. This in turn leads to higher hook prices. Calvin Schmidt, Registrar. course file update is run every day for two weeks. in the third week a revised schedule is run and distributed tn the faculty in the fo.urth week; seventh. discrepancies on the class lists arc ·reported by the instructors: eighth grade lists arc submitted. The whole sequence involves total cooperation between the departments. students. individual facultv members. and the Regist~ar's Office itself. One of the ohvious fnilures M the system is .that 5 percent of the students fail to pre-register on time. This non-compliimce causes much of the problems. Schmidt did state that. ..One observation I can make is that there has been less of it (pre-registration) this year than prc\'ious years. partly because the details of course times arc not known.\ technological breakthrough guaranteeing on-e power superiority,\ the great obstadc to be overcome in the Tripolar world is the \fear of isolation, of tl1e other two joining together.\ ~-he U.S. and the Soviet Union will r.cmain competitors; Spanier ·feels ··china will move in the direction of the U.S.\ This feeling is fortified by the Chinese challenge to the Sov.ict Union as the leader of the world Communist movement. The only Sino-American conflict at the present is the issue ofF ormosa. in which both nations appear to have reached a detente. for the United States has removed the Seventh Fleet. ahd 9.000 U.S. troops arc to be withdrawn. ProL Spanier stated that American foreign policy in the post-Vietnam Era will be far more difficult than in the post-World War II Era. U.S. foreign policy ·may sway hctwccn the two other powers. Spanier concluded by depicting the plight of the so-called \Th:ird World\ nutions. \In a Tripolar world.\ Spanier states. \:.-uper powers pay more attention t1.1 each other and less to the Third World in most areas. except possibly fnr the Middtc East~·· Spa nicr .concluded. ..The bargaining strength of the Third World is declining. and the~ may not he ablc to play off world powers as they could in the past.\ Union: 9 lhis. is the second time a Bach Passion has been pcl'ftWillcd a·t the Memorial Chapc.l.

, Pag~2 CQNCGJRDJENS.IS, Friday; Aptil13.' 1973 Counterpoint Despite all of the talk and all of the print devoted in the. past several mo 4 hs to the controversy surrounding the Hebrew program, the issue is still hot and sparks fly whenever the subject is discussed, whether at Hale House or ~t committee meetings. The issue is emotionally charged and thts has obscured the merits of the program, transforming it into a .. political football.\ . . . . The letter signed by Ron Aines and Judy Rabmow1tz, which appeared in the April lOth issue of <:oncordiens!s, contains many statements of truth. The Curncular Affairs Committee did indeed pass the buck to the Budget and Priorities Committee, although this action was precipitated by a breakdown in communications. The statement that faculty members will not be willing to make cuts affecting fellow faculty members is an interesting point and one that we feel will be vital in the discussions concerning the future shape of the curriculum;. It is very unfortunate that the facts of the matter have been obscured by irrational charges of anti-Semitism, such as those voiced in the letter. To even suggest that the Hebrew program was dropped from the regular curriculum (it will, by the way, definitely be offered as part of the Evening program next year) because of \institutional anti-Semitism\ is a monstrously unfair accusation. The men who make the decisions conc~rning the curriculum are not storm-troopers and are not parl of an insidious plot to rob Jewish students of \their ethnic identity.\ . The values which guide the allocation~ of the Budget m1ght be apen to question, and the non-actions of CAC and BAP might be indicative of a faulty decision-making structure, but accusing intelligent men .of conspiring against Jewish students is narrow-minded and asinine. -jrp amr- Investigation~ Continued from page 1 want to make deletions at the start of a new terril because of a large enrollment. The instructor then. under a method selected by himself, cuts those students who do not . 1neet the criteria;· this usually means freshmen. sophomores. or non-majors. In the past several terms professors h.avc asked the Registrar for a set limit on their course without using the card or list system. Due t~ pQor communication ·between Schmidt and various teachers the message was not conveyed that this cannot take place due to the limited office staff. which has not grown in Schmidt's tenure. Professors are then amazed to find 80 students in their course instead of the requested 30, for example. The resuJt is that 50 students are cut from the course rolls. The problems involved are now evident. Some students hinder the bureaucratic flow by failing to pre-register: professors and the Bookstore must guess at the number of books to order in the fifth week of a term because registration is usually later; students are cut from courses because of poor communication between the Registrar's Office and instructors or because a professor underestimated the popularity of a course: there is a delay in getting . rosters and marks to department chairmen and advisors. The most plausible solutions would be to: I. Have mandatory fines for late pre-registration. 2. Registration for the next term should take place early so that book orders can be made more precise. J. If the card or list system is not employed by a facultv member he should not be able to cut students from a course unless classroom size warrants it. 4. Office staff in the Registrar's Office should be increased to match the increased student body and complexity of the registration process as compared to 1 0 years ago. If these methods were instituted the entire process would be able to flow more evenly. COMING ATTRACTION -- The maintenance. problem - subtitled -- · the· ~Miraculous Missing Urinal Scandal.

Letters To the Editor: Why are the priorities at Union so arranged as to forfeit the students' well-being for the sake of completing other campus projects'! Isn't the safety of the students here one of the most import~nt assurances the College offers its members (both students and their families alike)? Last term. I was asked by one of the co-eds to escort her to a fesidential house outside campus grounds on the east side of the College. For such a trip, she needed to walk nearly the entire length of the campus, since most of the co-ed's dorms are located on the west side of the campus. It was a foggy night around I I :00 p.m .• and just weeks after the incident which happened to one of our co-eds ncar North College. so as to make tbat very sharp in our minds. Although I was not obligated to ·walk with her, l felt it would help ease her mind if accompanied by a male to her destination. As I left my dorm, I encountered a trouble spot most students of West College face, that of the poorly-lit stairs alongside the wall near North College. There are no lights w:hatsoever along that entire stretch of Walk from West to the stairs. in fact. as one approaches the stairwell. the little light which filters down from the arches along the Psychology building is eaten up by the shadow of the wal\ which encompasses the entire length of the stairs. However, this didn't phase me since I've gotten used to this situation in the time I've been here. After ail. once you've tripped over the steps in ·the dark, you learn to be more careful next time, so why bother to light it now! sad situation which prevails at Union. but all I can See :;o far is a situation similar to tJ:tat of ''closing the barn doors ~fter the horse is stolen.\ I've already mentioned. and it is common knowledge to all of you. what happened here last term, apd . because of this, it need not be described. or . what could nave been done to prevent it. . What does need to 'be e.llamined is the College's lack of attention in helping to prevent such things from happening. I only have to point out the fact that we have these streetlights set up Where they are to light up the wa:Jks and stairs for the convenience of the people who\ ·travel those paths. Yet far too often I find· many of the lights not Jit. What are they for? Quaint decorations? Just this vear, an article was published in· hmcordy about the vast amoung of non-working J.ight fixtures. What has been done about j.t? Again. early this year many of us ·noted some men laying cables unde~ground that J suppos~ were used to fix faulty poles, and I believe that they did fix the lights along the walk by the flag pole. Fine -~ but why didn't they fix the light by the stairs'? The cables are there. but it's still dark at night. And wasn't ther~ a light in West's parking lot on the north side earlier this year? I seem to fail to see the light now. I would rather see . such activities as the Student Center go unfinished for another term and have that money be redirected toward improving the lighting on campus than to have the situation continue as it is. Sure, you've improved the lighting along Terrace Lane North, but it was at the expense of ane of our fellow students. Try and convince her and all other co-eds that the present lighting on campus is sufficient. After air. it never happens to you ... only the other guy. Deesn't it'! Four facto-rs . must determine whether ·a course should be reinstated:· · da:ssreom space, . instructor. availability; student interest, and funding. The first . -·two can be dismissed easily and with little thought. The very fact th.at Hebrew is being taught pres~ntly indicates thai th~re is enough space and_, ac~ording, to informe!l people, Mr. Welkovitz, the Hebrew instructor,. would-be quite-willing to return if rehir~d. H: ebrew I 0 attracted sixty students, ll and 12, thirty apiece, and the term in Israel hal) been haile4 a. succ~ss by those returning. If a ·Jack of student interest .can be a reason for cariceHati<)n of a course., bow can a course that attracts thirty people be deleted in favor of classes containing only six or seven students? The big stumbling bi(:)C.k to reinstatement seems to be funding. In its ten million dollar budget, l)nion manages to find money to plant tulips in Library Plaza. print r¢ams of circular~. hire a dog catcher, and s.upport numerous extra-curricular activities. I'm not for cancellation of any of these things, by any mean~. but it :;eems entirely plausible that by jud.iciousiy cutting back here and there and rearr~nging the budget, the administration could easily corne up with the four t'housand dollars n~cessa-ry for the continuation of a program much in demand. Maybe the move isn't anti- Semitic in nature, maybe there is a good ratienalization for wiping GUt a series of studies based on Judaism. but I cannot see it. Somehow I get the picture of an old. embittered alumnus saying to the school. \I'll give you a new gym if ... \ Laurence Pritnack To the Editor: Nearing the corner of Social Sciences, we were nearly run over by an oncoming car which had come around the turn at Carnegie. Fortunately we were near the edge of the road, anti the driver was taking the turn wide, but I would have hated to startle the driver by being in his way. Of course he had his headlights on and he was traveling at a safe (?) speed. but I seriously doubt if he ever saw us running for protection along the side of the road. Again there was no street light. basically because there is no pole at the corner. The nearest one is over seventy feet away. I suppose what has been good in \ the past must be gaod for the present, but I'd hate to be the statistic to prove this wrong.

Page 4 _ CQNCORDI£NSIS •. Friday, Aprilf.3, 1973 Laxmen Dump Siena 15-8: by FRANCESCO ISGRO The Union College Lacrosse Team opened its season last Wednesday by walloping Capital District rival. Siena College, 18-5. Led by the brilliant plays of i>cnnis Walker. who scored 6 goals. and sophomore sensation Robert Grossman. who added J more. while making 4 assists. the Dutchmen provided some highlights for the sixty or so spectators who braved to come out on a windy. chilly and snowy afternoon. Siena. a second year team. had t;:ritered the contest with . a 1-1 rccorsl. Miller Scores First The Indians entered the game looking fairly well, and were able to score with I :52 gone in the clock. The Garnet laxmen weren't surprised a bit. and 25 seconds later Senior Pete Miller evened the contest. From this moment on. the Union offense completely dominated the game. and the Indians were held scoreless for the next 30 minutes: Dennis Walker scored twice in the first period. one tally coming with 17 seconds left on the clock. Sophomore Dennis DeMuth added the third goal. and frosh Mark Walsh added another. The second period was opened with a goal by Robert Grossman, who literally dominated the field. He tallied three times in this period. with a goal in the last 29 seconds before the half. Walker and DeMuth added one each. Thus at the end of the first half Union led 10-1. 30 Minutes Later In the _third period the Garnet Laxmen were held to only one tally. Walker scored the lone goal ()[ the period with 48 seconds remaining ..in the clock. Siena added 4 more. leaving the score at I 1-5. In the last period the Dutchmen came alive again, adding four more goals. Walker tallied twice within less than 30 seconds. freshman Bob Garbo added another. and Mark Walsh tallied for his second time. Team Captain Stan White, kept the Garnet midfielder well in order and provided some key passes for the offense. AI Ritchie tending the goal accounted for 9 saves. Ritchie who is only a freshman is someone to keep the eye on. He was replaced for a short time by converted attackman Don Ward. who made 2 saves. Coach Allison felt tnat the team had played \generally well\ and could sav that he was \satisfied with i.ts performance.\ Alli~on also believes that the Garnet should be ahlc to heat host Hartwick. whom they meet tomorrow. The Laxmen appear again at their home field Aprill8. when they host Williams College. Robert Grossman Tennis Volleys With ·weather by BART MERCER Union's 1973 version of its tennis team coached by Gary Walters looks about the same as the I972 model with only Fred Kaplan graduated .from last year's sq ua~l. However, the miserably cold and rainy weather has kept the team from its mueh needed practice. Official practice beg~Jn just la~t Monday yet the first good day of practice was Saturday. With the ·first match scheduled for this Saturday, that leaves but a week to sharpen up the old serve for the Dutchmen racketeers. That's assuming the typical Schenectady climate takes a week off. Top returnees to the squad are seniors Jim Skiff and Stu Fishier and junior Marty Cukierman. Coach Walters thinks transfer student Roman Rakoczy from Northeastern U. has a chance to break into ihe top three positions also. Other vet-e;ans from last year's team qre junior Tim Moran and. sophomores Kevin Crawford, Jack Lauroesch, Steve Wayne, and Dick Lamm. Any promising freshmen? Walters thinks frosh Bob Gerber, Dan Simos and Woody Lauer have looked good so far although, again due to the weather, he hasn't really had enough time to get a good look at the class of '76. Playing on an independent schedule, the first opponent will be Stevens at home this Saturday the 14th at 1:30 p.m. Coach Walters would like a sizeable turnout to s·upport the team and to get a glimpse of how the game is really played.

This same concert wHI be presented by the club at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall, New York City, Wednesday, May 16 at 8:30 P.M. Professor Hugh Allen Wilson will conduct both performances. National attention was focused on the Glee Club last spring when it appeared before the Intercollegiate Musical Council, meeting at Amherst, Massachusetts. Musicians there recognized the Union grollp as one of the east coast's outstanding college choral organizations. May's Lincoln tenter appearance is a ~esult of the attention garnered at the Amh:erst gathering. Betty Allen, guest soloist for both the Parents' Weekend and Lincoln Center concerts, is an internationally prominent mezzo soprano best known in the New York City area as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra (under both Boulez and Bernstein), and with the Handel Society of New York. Miss Allen. a native of Ohio, was educated at Wilberforce College and the Hartford School of Music. She will perform a scene from Verdi's H Trovatore, Brahm's alto Rhapsody, and Schubert's Standchen for male chorus and alto solo· with the Union Club. Other works on the program include pieces by Bruckner. .Josquin des Prez.

Trustees' Deliberations Meeting this past weekend on campus, the Board of Trustees made several important decisions affecting the College. The contract-tenuFe proposal signed by one hundred sixteen faculty members was approved by the Trustees. A preliminary legal draft of the contract, clarifying all points will now be drawn up by legal counsels. According to Provost Enteman, work on the library extension \should soon begin.\ The Board of Trustees gave the official go- ahead for construction. The Trustees also resolved to set up a committee for fixing the floor of the Field House. BasicallS' it is expected that the Field Heuse floor will be some artificial turf such as \Tartan- Turf.\ The Old County Library, previously approved for use as a dormitory for next year. will officially be named Webster Hall. Webster was one of Union College's previous presidents. A report from the comptroller's office to the Trustees indicated that $50,000 to $60,000 is still needed to balance the budget. The objective of the Comptroller's Office is to balance the budget for last year. this year and next. The Board of Trustees also approved a list of faculty appointments. These include giving tenure to Prof. Fairchild of the Math Department and Mrs. Moore, the librarian. Approval for other appointments are as follows: Prof. Finklestein, Acting Chairman for the History Department, Spring and Summer, 1973; Prof. Ward, Acting Chairman of Department of _ Continued on page 3 Since joining the Union faculty in I %2 Professor Wilson has devoted a considerable amount of his time to the Glee Club.

Vol. 102, No. 41 Uary Kipp, new Food Service Manager at College Dining Hall West founded at Union College in 1877 Tuesday, April17, 1973 20 cents The Bossman at Saga by GEOFFREY TAYLOR Last Tuesday a small group of students attended the Meet the Manager (of SAGA) party which featured Boonesfarm Apple Wine, cheese and crackers and of course the new manager. After a few of the typical cracks on the wine, several questions regarding the food service were put to the manager. Whether the students were satisfied with the answers is something else, the point is that most of the people left there very impressed with this young and affable person. 'Persuasions Have Soul Gary Hipp, the new food service manager in West College, is hard to miss with his towering height and friendly attitude. His attitude is evident in the frequent visits he makes to various tables to inquire about the service as well as to socialize with the students. He is a '71 graduate of R.l.T. (Rochester Institute of Technology) with a B.S. in business. Gary considers his young age (23) an asset to his job, in that it wasn't too long ago he was a student 011 the receiving end of a food service. In an interview, some general and specific questions were answered concerning the food service at the present time. Are you satisfied with the service at the present time? by ROBERT SHUGOLL As a part of Black Culture Weekend the Social Committee brought the Persuasions and New Birth and the Nite Liters to Memorial Chapel on Friday night. The success of the concert can be mostly credited to the Persuasions. an a capella soul group out of the Bedford- Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, New .York. A capella is a musical style involving no instruments, jUst voices. The Persuasions were introduced to a capella m Brooklyn, where this one~ popular musical form was known and practiced as street-corner music. Their own sound has a southern gospel ring to it, yet also incorporates a contemporary soul-rock mood. The group's 70 minute set was a polished and relaxing production. Consistently, the vocals were tight and their music was quite enjoyable. The 5 vocalists included a lead singer. bass. and a three-part harmony team. Lead singer and rapper Jerry Lawson comes oh with a preacher-like Curtis Mayfield message, enacted with the 'zeal of a James Brown. At times his dramatic delivery was so intense that it seemed absurd and I found it hard to ·take Coffeehouse, Fri.

Nonetheless, it provoked laughter and that's nothing to scoff at. The bass vocalist, Jimmy Hayes, was an extremely vital element to the group's sound. It was his booming bass lines, clearer than most bass guitars heard in electric bands. that set the group's rhvthm. The other 3 musicians sang very effective harmony, increasmg their appeal by physically singing at each other while crowding together around one mike. Their music covered various aspects of contemporary, sixties and fifties music, always with a tinge of gospel evident. They certainly rn&de a strong case for the beauty of a capella music and djsplc.y.ed the potential of the human voice as a self-sufficient instrument. How ever. the Persuasions also showed the limits of a solely vocal group to contemporary music. Towards the end of their set they seemed to lose some of the flow and vitality which keeps an audience intent on a group's performance. The tunes also began to sound a bit repetitious. Audience reaction was on the whole favorable. The Chapel held ·an atypi.cal conc.el't crowd consisting primarily of black people. a reversal of the usual audience makeup. At the end of the performance the Persuasions invited everybody on stage to join them in song, tnaking a lot of fun for f\Verybody and a fine way to end their party. tollowing the Persuasions, New Birth and the· Nite Liters came on stage, boasting I I mus1crans decked in bright red and blue outfits. My opinion of the gmup is that they're mediocre, just another band. However, they have several things going for them. Decent music played by II average musicians who don't get in each other's way was enjoyable, They all worked hard on their jazz-rock sound and the beat was ~tlways driving. They even escaped the run-of-the-mill-band rut on songs featuring the horn section, easily the greatest factor on the group's side. The Student Committee-on- Committees will accept applications for appointment until Wednesday .at 4 p.m. in the Student Activities Office. W ~ ask the assistance of all students in that many committees to this point remain undersubscribed. AU those seeking re-appointment to a certain committee must · .reapply for that position. We would also like to announce that applications will be accepted for a newly recognized committee, the Housing Committee. The Committee-on- Committees will conduct interviews on Thursday, Friday,. and possibly Saturday of this week, and on Monday and Tuesday of next week. We would :Jsk that all those who have .applied for a committee be available during this period. \Well that's what I'm doing here. I'm trying to get things a little more organized as far as the placement of things in specific locations rather than having them scattered all over. This should lead to a little more efficiency. Sanitation is another problem l've been working on.\ Will there be any specific changes in the food service under your management? \J dQn't foresee any drastic changes. Of course there will be a few improvements like new equipment in the kitchen will be coming in this summer and this will make a difference in the product. My operating procedures will remain the way they are. The management position varies from person to person, depending on the way each one handles people. I don't really know what the service was like before, but I intend to follow the standards of the company because I believe it is a good program.\ (Note: One of the reasons.forthe firing of the previous manager was his failure to meet company standards.) I have noticed the way you have walked around the cafeteria mixing with the students, asking them about the service and answering any questions they might have. Do you plan on continuing this type of interaction or is this just a way of breaking the ice as a new manager? \No that's the most important part of my job. I try to be at each meal because I get a lot of information from students regarding the service. It was not that long ago when I was a student so communication is not a problem. I ask them how their meal is and if they have any ideas about the service. If anyone has a question or complaint 1 hope they will not hesitate coming to me.-\ Regarding the lenghy lines on Sunday morning, Mr. Hipp said he would at first try a new line server and if that didn't work, both serving lanes will be opened. The Saturday breakfast at the present time caters to 50 students {who are crazy enough to get up at that hour). Permission to change the hours on Saturday must come from the district manager. Mr. Hipp agreed to look into this matter with his superiors. The present meal ticket has been criticized because it is attached to the Student ID Card, If it is lost, the cost of its replacement is 8 dollars. \Next year,\ according to Gary, \there is a good possibility that a separate I D card will be issued.\ Other- spef:ific complaints were mentioned in the interview, but aJI through the interview this reporter was impressed with the personal interest he had for the students and his willingness to listen.

•. Pag~ 2 CONCORDIENSIS, Tuesday, Apri/17, 1973 Counterpoin-t Two· : · . . . Last week we reacted stro-ngly against charges of \institutionalized anti-Semitism\ made by Ron Aines and Judi Rabinowitz. One of our major objections at the time was that they were taking scraps of \evidence\ and magnifying them into an insidious plot against Jewish students. After studying the assertions made in their second letter which appears on this page, we again repeat our objection that Mr. Aines and Ms. Rabinowitz have manufactured a case of anti-Semitism out of bits and pieces of administrative bungling with regard to the Hebrew program. In our eyes, \institutionalized anti-Semitism\ is defined as anti- Semitic tendencies which are integrally and inseparabiy built into a bureaucracy. Building a case of this type around one careless remark (no doubt taken out of context) made by one administrator hardly justifies a charge of such magnitude. With regards to the proceedings of the Curricular Affairs Committee, we accept the fact that CAC did strongly endorse the Hebrew program. However, it is also important to realize that Provost Enteman came to that Committee in the fall of 1972 and stated that if the committee desired to keep the Hebrew program in the regular curriculum it woulCi be the CAC's responsibility to make a corresponding cut in another area of the curriculum. When the Provost gave CAC this power he stated that he would stand by the committee's decision. In other words, it was up to the CA C to determine how to fit the Hebrew program into the curriculum. The financial aspects of funding the Hebrew program have provoked much controversy, but there is very little concrete information in this area. The Evening division has agreed to fund the Hebrew program for the academic year 1973-1974 regardless of outside support. Finally, we again repeat that the controversy over the Hebrew program has been marked by administrative bungling, confused committee responsibilities and questionable budgetary priorities. We strongly support the continuance of the Hebrew program, but we totally reject the assertions of personal or intstitutional anti-Semitism on .. the part of individual administrators or the college. T~. burden of proof lies' with the claimants, Mr. Aines and Ms .. Rabinowitz, and based on the evidence contained in their second letter we are completely unconvinced as to th~ ~alid~tY. ~f theirdaims .. Their course is one of total irresponsibility, they· have ·exposed no hidden truths; the really sad part is that the merits of the Hebrew program have taken a back seat to vague innuendo, unsubstantiated accusations and vicious name calling. amr jrp CONCORDIENSIS founded at Union College in 1877 Editor-in-Chief.. ..............................................

If Hebrew had been proposed this year as a new program the restrictions imposed on the CAC which it claims prevented it fr.om making a decision, would probably have been accepted by the college community. So, too, would the recalcitrance of the administration not to come up with a decision have been accepted. But, this has not been the case. The question of Hebrew is at least three years old. And, for these three years the administration has been reluctant to fund the program.

12 elf e\ he in ln al if 0 h y e t CONCORDf.ENsis, Tuesday,' Apriii7, ~19JJ Letters _Continued froni pa.ge 2 were accepted by Hebrew's proponents and outside \seed\ money was sought. When the question of funding surfaced the second time, .the administration again looked to outside sources, apparently having forgotten the one-shot · nature. of the original gift. No reasons for the failure to include Hebrew in the· academic budget that year have been given. Last year, the questio11 of funding again came up. Then, C AC was charged with approving the academic merit of the program. This was done with the All~CoUege Senate in approval. June rolled around and everyone felt that the issue was finally settled. 1t was· not. · This fall it soon became evident that President Martin had decided, that only one Hebrew course should be taught. But, he would not speak to students. His Provost was now in charge, And, Entemann said that he could not change the decision that Martin had made, supposedly out of fear of directly challenging the President. And, to top things off, this year the rules of the game have been changed so that CAC is now responsible for finding funds for all new programs, as well as deciding academic merit. Of course, it .has been s:uggested that Hebrew be offered in the evening division, at least for one year. This is not satisfactory. Very possibly, freshmen would be reluctant to take an evening . course their first term h.ere. More important, though, is the nat!,lre of a language course; five one hour classes with additional labs. The chances of someone from the community willing to tie up so much of his time in the evenings is dubious as evidenced by the absence of .other language courses from the evening schedule. And. without at least ten non-day division students in the program, it will not be offered in the second year. But, this offer of Hebrew'in the evening only obscures the real issues: Why; in the past three years has Union failed to :include Hebrew in the regular academic budget? · Whatever the reasons have been for this, there is no excuse. Hebrew \has shown itself as desirous and has been judged academically acceptable by CAC. B-11dgetary restrictions not withstanding Hebrew should finally be accepted. Three years are too long to wait. Joseph W. Schwartz To the Editor: When art ethnic group employs shock tactics against a predictable bureaucracy, the conflict will be most difficult to resolve, if, indeed, it can ever be resolved. To engage oneself in the debate over the tedious terminology of ''institutional anti-Semitism\ is not a judicious decision. The issue only becomes further clouded with emotion. ~nd misperception .. For what is \institutional a-nti- Semitism'\/ Is i·t any more than \institutional racism\? I arrt smprised at the nUmber of campus personalities who have, in the past, readily defined . ·\institutional. racism\ so as to ·inc 1 u de U n i on i n t h a: t classification. along with the majority of American institutions. Yet, few people are willing to apply the same standards in this situation and agree that Union could also be institutionally anti- Semitic. Just as- racism is more and less than· burning crosses and Butl Connor, so is anti..:Semitism more and less than pogroms, c9n~entration. camps, and H·itler. To the Editor: Sincerely yours, George Baiil '73 .I would like to take. exception to Bennet-Fitz-Aian Howard's review of the \Passion According to St.. John\ p.erfotrried last week by thf;! Union CoHege Madrigal Singers and the · Mt. Holyoke Chamber Singers. The review did llo justice to a performance that was beautiful, moving, and to tn.y ears, musically first rate.

Mark Shngoll To the Editor: ln my HVieW of the performance of 'The Passion According to St. John\ in the Friday issue of the Concordy, I was too harsh in my judgment and optnton about the performance.

College· Senate Decisions l't was obvious that something had to be done, and so began the debate about our campus (logs. It was simple enough, really. People were being threatened by some apparently masterless canines roaming the campus at will, attacking each other, scaring the wits 'OUt of some assorted Coca- Cola and utility men, and various other campus visitors. And so it came down to a meeting of the All College Senate last Thursday afternoon. where, by a vote of 7 to 6. dogs were banned from · campus grounds and dormatories beginning in September. The discussion took most of an hour and stemmed from two very polarized and predetermined points of view. The predominant one was based largely on the possibility of injury to campus . visitors. which could ultimately lead to a pretty stiff legal suit. The second view, represented almost entirely by students, stressed that dogs added to the life and atmosphere of the campus, and that it was the masterless few who upset the community.

The senate then shifted into academia and supported, as goals, the recommendations of the re.port put out by an American Studies Task Force. The report called for the restructuring of the program in order to give the sixty-five plus American Studies majors a greater opportunity to work within a major that can handle that number of students.

The Garnet laxmen whose performance \was not at their best\ scored only 7 goals against Hartwick's 12. It was the first time in history that these two teams met, a·nd it was the opening match for host Hartwick. Union dropped its record lo 1-1. No. 24 J.im Thtunpson, was the only Gamet to be able to score in the fi.rst two periods. Hartwick at the same time was able to score 7 times. What the Garnets laxmen seemed to he Jacking in the first half \was the willingness to play,\ \the willingness to hustle,\ as one of the players commented. Whatever the reason might have been at the end of the first half, the score was 7-2 in favor of Hartwick, ano it looked that' the worst had yet to come. In the second half, the' Union- .laxmen, &eemed to be mor'e ~ware' of the facts that they were losing, and behind tlie effort of Denis Walker who scored two goals, the Garnet added 5 more points. But it was .an even trade, if there was one. for Hartwick added 5 more . goals. Getting on the .scoreboard for Union were Bob Grabo, Don Ward. and Senior Dennis DeMouth.

SCORING LEADERS Walker 8 Grossman 3 DeMuth 3 Grabe 2 Thompson 2 Walsh 2 Bob Mitchell stroked two singles and Skip Lega collected the only extra base hit for Union, an RBI double in the seventh. Rolf Wandell a-nd Gino Quirk also contributed RBI singles to the attack. Speedy Ron Westbrook looked very good at shortstop, and \Brook\ stole three bases in three attempts from Hamilton. Also, Bob Bernhardt made two sure-handed grabs of difficult chances at the hot corner, thrilling the whole crowd.

Offensively, the team is averaging .a shade under ten runs a game with every member of the starting Nine hitting consistently. Gino Quirk came to life with three hits on Saturday and Bob Bernhardt collected four of his own. However, the outstanding slugging should have not overshadowed the excellent pitching performances that have been turned in thus far. Very Both weekend victories were great team efforts.

At the end of seventeen events Union had amassed 120 points, giving up only three first places, to beat Wesleyan's 34 points. Sprinters Tracey Rich, Chris Doulides, Jerry Cuffey and Milt Herring turned in a 45.5 clocking for the 440 yd. relay team's '73 debut. Later in the day Herting dashed to a 10.5 win in the I 00 and a 23.7 victory ·in the 220. Cuffey closed in at the finish of the 220 to steal second place with a lean, crossing in 24.2. Union sweeps came in the 120 yd. high hurdles, triple jump and long jump. Buzzing across the finish line for nine team points in the hurdles were Tracey Rich, Dick Kem, and Jeff Luck with respective times of 17.3, 17.6 and 18.5. Meanwhile John DeStefano, Pete Walrath, and Brad Patterson were displaying their talents in the long and triple jumps. Walrath hopped, skipped and jumped 43' 2Y4\ for a victory in the triple and soared 20' 2 7 /8\ for a second in the long jump behind John De Stefano's first place 20' 3W'. \John De\ came back to take third in the triple jump with 41' I 0 7 I 8\. Brad Patterson sat in the number two slot in the triJ?Ie jump with 42' W' and third in the long jump with 19' 7-W. Steve Jones kicked the last 220 yards of the mile run for a winning time of 4:27.3. Scott Kalina came across the line with 4:44.0 for third. Jonesey came back to ~rab third in the three mile run with a time of 15:28.3. The open 440 was run without Union's speedy David White who was sidelined with inuries, but the Dutchmen brought home first and second places as Dave Ricks pressured in the last 15 yards to overtake Greg Hamlin and win with a 51.8 clocking, crossing the line only 0.02 seconds before Hamlin. Ricks returned to pole vaulting area where he captures another win vaulting 12' 6\ Frosh Bob- Baribeau placed second in the event at 12' Another close finish was witnessed as Co-captain Tim McCabe closed in on Mark Mindel to take the win in the 880 yd. run with a time of I :59.0 as Minner crossed second in 1:59.3. High Jumpers Stan Jackson and John De Stefano each cleared 5' 10\ for an easy first two places in the event. Bill \Muscle\ Mowery showed fine form as he collected firsts in the shot put ( 49' 2Y:!'') and discus (.136' 3W'), a second in the hammer (I 09' 7\) and a third in the javelin (135' 4\).

Opinion Continued from page 2 would conflict with the numerous evening cultural activities on campus. . We repeat. we cannot believe that within the huge ten million dollar operating budget of the school - - a mere four thousand dollars cannot be found for Hebrew. Suddenly, funds were discovered to pay a dog catcher one hundred dollars a week and to finance the expensive recruitment of a Political Science professor for a one year term. Fina.lly, last fall you stated that there simply was no money for Hebrew II and 12 this year. Yet, the money was found and we are certain that money once again can be located to fund Hebrew. in closing, we strongly believe we acted rationally and logically in coming to our assessment. The only responsible course for us to take is to repeat that institutional anti-Semitism exists at Union College. The on!y .. \damage\ done by our statement is that the sad truth has been revealed.

Mondale, (Dem. !Ylinnesota) will be the guest speaker of The Political Forum on Tuesday, April 24th at 8:00p.m. in SS 016. The topic on which Sen. Mondale will speak is \The Struggle for Power between Congress and the President.\ Recently; in an article written by Mondale which appeated in the New York Times, he criticized President Nixon's bombing of Cambodia. T·he Senator indicated that the Administration is \challenging\ Congress \to assert its constitutional responsibility ... \ section of the Economic Opportunity Act of 197·1 was vetoed by Nixon, a modified version was passed by the Senate in 1972. The bill \seeks to provide quality pre-school education programs, on a voluntary basis, to young children whose parents work or who, because of poverty, are often denied the education, health or nutrition necessary for success in school and life.\ Interview: Friday, Apri120, 1973 20 cents Smith Appointed New Dean of Students Provost Willard Enteman has announced that Dr. Mark Smith has accepted the position of Dean · of Students effective July l, 1973. Dr. Smith received his B.A, M.A. and Ph. D. in Psychology f.rom Ohio State University, taught Psychology at Denison University and served as Dean of Students at Denison for 16 years. Dr. Smith received a unanimous recommendation from the Search Committee and the reports fFom students who met him were extremely favorable. The following is a report of Dr. Smith's meeting with students and administrator•s last week. Dr. Mark Smith is a candidate for the vacant Dean of Students - post. Tuesday afternoon he met with twenty-five students and faculty members, as well as Provost Enteman and Dean Wylen. Wylen, who is chairman of the search committee charged with recommending a candidate to be hired, distributed evaluation sheets to all present; he asked that the sheets be turned in to the search committee to provide a measure of student feedback on this candidate. Dr. Smith's educational background is in psychology. He was, for sixteen years up to last year, Dean of Students at Ohio's Dennison University. He asked that the audience ask questions. The ideal Dean of Students for Union College is a \man of tremendous energy,\ one who receives and emits \a lot of stimuli.\ Whomever becomes Dean, Smith feels, must bring all parts of the Co_lle~~ to~ether, particularly the d isaf'tected ones; Admissions and Upward Bound, as two examples, are dissociated from student life. The Dean, as Smith sees him, must cross section lines and permit closer relations. He must work, and Smith maintained that he would work, to combat loneliness. People must relate to others. Dr. Smith believes that people at Union want to relate more to each other. Union is unique in that the faculty, having recently gone through a difficult time, is now l).'lore receptive to and interested in students. Union's uniqueness lies not in \one of the sorriest looking housing situations. I've ever seen,\ but in the attitude toward, that situation. There is, Smith said, \apathy about apathy.\ Which is not all bad, because it means that merely talking about making changes is likely to meet with no response. Asked to elaborate on the Housing theme, Dr. Smith stated that the Resident Advisor systef\ is \absolutely great.\ Student, should run residence halls, but . close relationship between RA · and Maintenance, and RA's am; the Business Office is called for. In Smith's view, the most important consideration in Housing is that the \self- indulgence of one student doesn't Continued on pag~ 7 Black Culture Week- by TRACY RICH What is the purpose of a Black Cultural Week? This phenomenon has become a tradition for black students who find themselves in the fortunate or unfortunate (depending upon your perspective), position of being at predominantly white institutions of higher education. The reasons for sponsoring a Black Cultural Week vary. For some it provides an opportunity to assert their presence in a place ~where they otherwise go unnoticed. For others, it is an opportunity to have at least one week out ()[ the fifty-two to call their own; a chanee to make something (Union's social environment), normally lily white, off-white,- tinged with Black. While mosf white-studenis Took on with bewilderment (and fear ' when so\ many blacks are on campus for the different activities sponsored), the black students feel just a little more at home. Union's black students sponsored their Black Arts festival last week. It was kicked off with an art exhibition featuring works, mostly black themes, done mainly by black inmates. in prisons throughout New York State. The small portion of the \Corrections on Canvas\ art exhibit featured works mainly done by inmates in Auburn Maximum Security Facility located in Auburn, New York. Only fifty out of nearly five hundred paintings were displayed here due to a shortage of display space. Appointed to the United States Senate in 1964 to fill the unexpired term of Sen. Hubert Hun1phrey, Mondale was elected to a full six-year Senate term in 1966 and re\Clected in 1972. Cerrato on 'Caligula' A second art exhibit included the works of the painter, Mr. Alyin Smith. The artist himself was kind enough to give a workshop Saturday afternoon, April 14th, and a lecture that evening on his works. Mr. Smith has his ()Wn gallery, \Gallery Ninety-two,\ located in the .. big apple\ where he is also a professor at the City University of New York. Active in consumer affairs, Sen. M on dale has sponsored legislation concerning the consumer's right to know if he has a· defective automobile. He also sponsored the Wholesome Meat Act of 1967 regarding state meat inspection programs and minimal federal involvement in the inspection process. As chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Migratory workers, he has .documented the problems of these workers, informing the public of the problems of these poor. Mondale has also championed the cause of another unrepresented group, the young. Though his original child care Congressman Samuel· ·Stratton will speak on \The Effects of- the Federal Budget Cuts on the 28th , Congressional District\ on Wednesday, April 25th in SS 016 at 8:00 p.m. This lecture is sponsored by the Political Forum. Rep. Stratton is a former faculty member ·of Union College and the former Mayor of Schenectady. He has been a House member since 1958 serving on the Armed Services Committee. Rep. Stratton won his last election by the largest House pluraUty in the country. An Interview with Paulo Ceratto on the Upcoming Play \Caligula\ by DANIEL J. VALENTI To make students familiar and to a degree interested in the upcoming production of Caligula by Mountebanks, Concordy interviewed Paulo Ceratt(), the. play's director. Coneordy: Quite apart from the philosophy of the play, what difficulties do you forsee coming up in producing a play of this scope? Ceratto: One of the difficulties might be making people aware of Caligula, here at Union. He was a · Roman emperor in his early 20's, a historical figure from which Camus got his ideas. ·One other difficulty for me is to. produce a play that can be a metaph~.>r for the students here at Union. I do not want the play to be simply a historical representati<>n, or a Cecil DeMille kind of Roman representation. Caligula is the only character I know of in drama· who remains consistent with himself all through the play, and this is a very difficult thing to get from an actor. Also, each of the characters in the play, of which there are 18, has a meaning, an implied signific~nce, · and this has to be made clear to the audience. I respect the audience, and I want them to feel comfqrtable once they walk into .the theater. Coneordy: Do you feel that Union has enou~h theatrical talent available to fill an i H- member cast? Are there enough people around who can give you what you want? Ceratto: I would say, theoretically, \Yes.\ I've seen .some good acting here - J.B., Marowitz Hamlet, the Children's Theater, and Moonchildren. Lots of people could be excellent per.formers, and there is a wide spectrum of roles to fill. It's almost like going to a tailor; each person should fit to a definite character and I'm sure that a persdti could find a , role to suit him in this play. · Concordy: Although Caligula is a difficult play, wouldn't you agree that it is within the capabilities of any student to take on a role and do a good job? That is, as 1 see it, one of your difficulties will be getting a large segment of the student body interested in this play, and not just people who are automatically drawn to theater. Ceratto: Right. That's the point. There are people I've talked to from different departments, and knowing there is time 'available the production should be corning out at the end of May - I would think that we do have the talent. It's just a question of getting the talents interested. It's a play that requires some challenges and some time. but, hopefully,. reheatsals should be something to enjoy, something to appreciate, something to share. - Concordy: Getting back to the play itself, you've made some changes in the script. What · prompted these changes? Ceratto: Well, first of all, the play was entire,ly re-translated from the French, and I'm very grateful to Andre Moorhead, who started and completed this extremely challenging job. The previous translations were not completely fair and ·honest to the work. The cltanges are basically changes that appear in the set. I want to see a lot of the Mediterranean element in there. The play is not going to be changed. According to the people I'm going to find, according to their roles, and according to the acting, tllere will be some changes, and the new translation will be according to the set which Professnr Moorhead has designed. But I think that Caligula is, in a sense, Everyman, and I think that Camus ieft some space for different interpretations ..and changes. I'll try to be as honest as I can; I respect both the author an,d the audience. Concordy: You have chosen to do this specific play. Briefly, what is it about the story of Caligula that captured your imagination and enthusiasms as a director? Ceratto: I started work-ing on this project last summer. I went into the historical sources and 1· was .iust captured and very much Continued on page 6 The high point of the week was the concert Friday night, April 13th, featuring the Persuasions and New Birth and the Nite Liters. The concert was preceded by a reception for about 20 black sub-frosh recently accepted by- Union. One major reason for sponsoring the week was to entertain and convince as many black sub-frosh as possible to come to Union. The concert 'was followed by a reception of sorts in Old Chapel. Informal rap sessions were sponsored throughout the weekend aimed at enlightening the sub-frosh as to what they should expect at Union .. 1)e week was hampered by a shortage of funds and the last minute cancellation of a play, and speaker, Mr. Franklin Frazier. Despite the limited number of activities, the Weed did provide several opportunities for the Union College black students, and a few interested whites, to mingle with each other, members of the community and black students from other colleges while maintaining and promoting the spirit of black awareness and tOgetherness. It is a spirit that one can ·be bard-pressed to find at places like Union the other fifty- one weeks of the year.

Poge2 CONC?RDI~NSIS~ Friday,.Aprl/20~ I??.J.~ .. To the Editor: .• - Candidates for student government at Union often address themselves, justly, to hroad issues of critical importance, such as student apathy, powerlessness, and the lack of a true sense of community. We lend them a sympathetic ear, and in the past, our vote, hoping that someday these problems would be ''legislated away\ though their, efforts. We know that solutions to these broader issues must be the · goals of any government. However, before these aims can be reached, there must exist a strong and able :Student government, capable of solving our everyday problems of housing, maintenance,- social activities, book costs, security, lighting, and curriculum. Both candidates for Steering Committee President want to increase student involvement on campus; they would both support a bigger voice for students in school decisions; we hope that both of them want a stronger sense of community at Union. However, Larry Bwwn recognizes that the Steering Committee must first meet those everyday concerns of students before it can tackle these lofty goals. For this reason, we actively support the candidacy of Larry Brown for President of the Steering Committee.

If the student government is to be effective, the college community must be well informed on the issues and policies that the Committee is dealing with. I am more than willing to put forth the time and effort that is necessary to publicize the actions of the Steering Committee. I am also very interested in werking with the priorities that Union College .sets, and in making the students' opinions known. I feel that the secretary must bridge the communication :gap between the student government a.nd the college community as a whole.

His involvement in his three yeaFs at Union has been extensive having served on the All-Colleg~ Senate as a Student Representative for two years, has participated on the Student Senate, has been actively involved with the committee which is working to make the new Student Center a viable institution at Union.

Le.tters To the Editor: The issues in this year's campaign for student offices may not seem to be important to most students, and it may even seem that it would not be worthwhile to spend the time to vote on Tuesday. Yet, from the seemingly remote issues that have arisen in the College governance system, one thing comes sharply into focus. The achievements that have been made over the past few years with regard to establishing a student voice in the decision- making process are . rapidly eroding. It is now clear that the future policies of the college will be made without any real, active voice of the students, unless a change is instigated soon. A prime example of this is the Hebrew issue. Other candidates have said that IF a demand is shown by the students, then the program should be continued. However, they fail to acknowledge the obvious presence of a genuine interest in the program. I say that a co\nbined enrollment of over one hundred students in the three courses offered is a clear indication of the demand for the program. An active voice must be raised from within the policy-making structure of the College to ensure t:he permanent and unquestionat;.le standing of such a program. The Hebrew question should be looked at in the broader view of an attempt by the College system to ignore the wishes of a sizeable segment of the student body. Secondly, the development of the College Center with virtually no student participation in the planning (except a token committee that was formed in the late stages of renovation of the building, and then only as a rubber-stamp panel'\for previously laid plans) is also a clear example of students being ignored and their opinions overlooked. Further development of the Center, dep.ending on gifts for that purpose, should proceed as swiftly as :--ossible. [t must include student pa·rticipation in the formation of policy concerning the allocation of funds for a College Center devoted almost entirely t0 student use. Thus, I wish to declare my candidacy for the position of At- Large Representative to the All- College Senate. My work this year on the Steering Committee, Committee-on-Committees, Saga Food· Committee, and ~allege Center Committee has displayed my interest in College affairs. I pledge to dedicate myself· to a reaffirmation and expansion of the student's right to have all active voice in all College affairs. With this goal in mind, I wish to better serve the needs of students at Union. · To the Editor: Thank you, Paul Corwin When the Steering Committee was formed one year ago, it Was given a primarily advisory and symbolic function. Through the actions of the present Steering Committee, it has lo!!t even those miniscule powers. That is the situation which, if elected, I hope to remedy. The reason for my concern with this problem is my feeling that as students here, we should have some effective say in the policies of this school. If the Steering Committee is ever to become an effective- body, it .must first regain the advisory and symboHc, functions which it lost this past year, and it must regain those functions soon. That is my· platform, and a willingness to work to regain those lost powers is my qualification. Thank you. Marc S. Altman Canrlidate for Steering Committee Class of 1976 To the Editor: As the group .. · irr student government to which changes in policy are first ptel!ented 'by the students, the Steering Committee must be highly respoi:Jsive to student opinion. Student interest and subsequent involvement could be increased and made more meaningful through more effecti V'e methods of communication between students and the committee. Th.is communication is the responsibility of the Secretary, the position for which I am announcing my candidacy. The Secretary is · responsible for keeping students informed of the commit~tees' activities b·y maintaining and distr.ibuting an account of each meeting. This past year, the minutes were posted in Concordiensis and given to Resident Advisors. Student awareness could, however., be greatly increased by .circulation,of each meetings' minutes to the entire student body through the campus mail and thr.o\Ugh announcements .of aU meetings. Although the 'secretarial position holds limited initiatory power, a vote in the· committee provides influence in the formulation of committee policy. · With this influence 1 would · advocate a referendum on the -:Hebrew issue ~ so important to the future of this school. 1 would also supp.ort any measures, such as the .tightening of the budget to buy more books, which would lea?. t? an improvement of library faciiitl~s to a point at least level with the calibre of the school. The present profit-making structure of the Bookstore is an unnecessary expense to the study body which I would oppose .. Salaries should be p~id and some growth al'lowed, however, the five percent profit seems excessive. Cooperation between the Admissions Office and Housing Office should be encouraged in order to ·avoid future housing shortages. 1 would also seek an extension of extra- ~;urricular activities for women. The Glee Club is presently restricted to males, as _ ate organized competitive sports.· Student government must be representative io be effective. As Secretary, I would constantly remain accessible to the student body and would attempt to serve as an input for student ideas. Anne Schwartz '75 To the Editor: As one listener who found the April 9 performance of Bach's ''Passion According to St. John,\ both moving and impressive~ I would like to put on record my appreciation of the preparation given to this music by both 'choral groups and their Directors, as wen as a spirited orchestra and an outstanding team of soloists. Had my ears not told me the . degree of involvement of both choruses, my eyes would have. Their intensity of involvement in fact contributed to the one problem that, for me, was disturbing - the fact that the sop_rano section overbalanced pot only the male but also the· alto voices. Just the same, I had no such experience as had your reviewer, that Keith Kibler's fine voice was \at many points .•. the only audible one of the Union male chorus.\ The soprano balance problem was matched by the tendency of modern violins to hog the scene, but they are, 'for Baroque music, both oversized and oversexed. ' l happen to . feel · \that the chorales taken that fast become part .of a non~stop action in place of tableaus where the.re is, instead of action, contemplation. But that must remain a matter. of the conductor's conviction and Donald Chen. never · lac·ked '· . convictiOn. Since I could throughout hear the Union singers, I am startled at scholarship to brin8 to a Baroque 'W<)t'k, · but f).!;! · has also a responsibility to sha~:e the laurels (preferably whole works at a time rather than severing the body in the middle) with his colleagues from other colleges.

i ,· ' . CONCORDIENS/S, Friday, Apri/20~ 1973 Page3 Lettuce Boycott .by WOODY GUTIIERZ and, JAY O'BRIEN Agricultur~ • is tlie biggest business in America in terms of supplying the demands of the American people. Although in the past, agriculture has bt1en based on the f;unily-farm .system, this system has now been swallowed up by giant agri-busi~esses (despite what Earl Butz says). For instance; lJank AmeriCa, through its subsidiarie.s, owns one half of all cultivated lana in California. Tenneco owns one million acres, in addition to supplying themselves with all their own packing, machinery, pesticides, etc. Del Monte employs 90,000 seasonal laborers who are recipients of free housing supplied by Del Monte, whiCh is coincidentally surrounded by barbed wire. ln 1970 Del Monte was the major lobbyist against UFW wage increases;. which failed to pass the Senate. Consequently, the minimum wage is still $.30 per hour below that of industry, and 30% of employers have been found yiolating even this standard. L. A. faliil owners stated: \We used to own our slaves, now we rent them.\ Faced with these intolerable conditions, the agricultural workers began organizing around the United Farm Workers. ln July of 1970 as the .grape struggle was ending, the .U FW petitioned lettuce grower~ for secn;!t ballot union representation election. The growers ignored the request and instead sought out the Teamster's Union. Without c.onsulting the workers, the growers signed back- door contracts with Teamsters. Denied elections, the workers went out on strike on August 24, 1970 to demonstrate that they wanted to be represented by the UFW headed by CAeser Chavez. 7 ,00(:) workers walked off the job in what the L. A Times called \The largest farm Labor Strike in· the U.S. History.\ Realizing the strength of the UFW, the Teamsters began to import .scab labor from Mexico, a . practice which they've continued until the present time .. Two of the most powerful .enemies .of the farm workers are the Pentagon and the A & P. A & P is the largest single purchaser of scab 'lettl}ce, four billion heads a week {as. stated in a fact sheet ·published by A & P). Outing the grape boycott, the Defense department increased its grape consumption by 350%. Nat only are they doing the same thing now with lettuce, but they have shifted much of their business to Bu<;l Antle, the largest non-union producer..; and sometimes pay as much as $2.90 a crate more than most civilians pay. (So that's where taxes are going?) Where Has Tommy Flowers Gone ? \This is ::rommy Flowers. For your shopping convenience, Bloomingdale's is going to be bombed. Grab what you can and split.\ Tommy Flowers is coming home. Child of the '50's, used~up hippie, bemused revolutionary, now he's 30 years old and in the Year of Our Lord 1973 he's trying to exist and keep his head while all about him are losing theirs. This is comedy? Terrence McNally thinks so. McNally has authored a farce about our hero, called Where Has. tommy Flowers Gone?, which will open May 2nd in the Arts Building's new \Performing Arts Center\ (room 202, nee the Physics Lecture Hall), courtesy of Union College's Mountebanks. The production will run through May 5th. McNally, a young playwright, is an experienced hand at satire. His off-Broadway hit, Next, which played -along with Elaine May's Adaptation, was about a forty-year-old man who gets drafted and then tries to talk his way out of it. His hm,nor was precise and sharp, and his sardonic assault on the military was devastating. · . Having done with the Pentagon, McNally now tum.s his sights toward an e.ven bigger target: American yputh-culture society. Joining him in this effor.t is director Jay Kahn. You may remember Jay from Adaph\tion here, in which .he memorably experienced Sudden Death at his TV set, 9~\n~ ... \!V.itb ].1.\s remQl~ control frozen. if!. his. grasp ..• Jay . then went ,pn to dire.ct the highly.- successful mu~ical comedy, Tbe Last Sweet Oays of Isaac. In tbe upcoming production, Jay and Terrence are setting their tongues in their cheeks in an alli:out barbed attack ori that distinctly American . phe,nom{mon, . the Aging Adqlescent. director Kohn had these comments about the play: · \Tommy Flowers is everyman's hero. He's just like you or me; he wants everything. For free. And he sets out to get it. Tommy is an inordinately fascinating character; he's the victim who fights back against society. The play is a hlack comedy, a very broad classification that t1sually denotes social satire. It has a message, but come and see it anyway: it's a very funny play.\ Veteran actor-director (The Brig, Moonchildren) Rich Mendoza is playing the part of · Tommy. He shared these thoughts about his role: 'Tommy is political, more political than I'd ever let myself be. Politics can lead to self- righteousness. He's sexual. Good. He wants everytlling, wants to act without consequences. He is, in short, a free spirit. My friends are surprised I'm doing the part - they say I'm not zany. Well, _ maybe not, at least publicly. So this time aroqnd I get to be the freest soul in N.Y.C. And be crazy in public. But whe~ the house lights come up, It wasn't me who did all those ridiculous things. To 'act' is to act without consequences.\ Rich's Tommy is ably supported by Katie Hollister as Nedda Lemon, Bill Vallee as. IJen Delight. Larry Hadbavny as Arnold the Dog, and playing multiple roles, Kathy Gemmell, Lynn Sclicke~rieder, and Chuck Rothman. The play is broad in scope, taking place in a jet plane, the Women's House of Detention, the A&P, an9 a Bloomingdale's pay toilet, among .other places. The Performing Arts Center, a new setting for Mountebanks productions, is a small room; audience .size will be limited, so ,eyecyone is adviseQ to make early reservations. Tickets are free for Union students, $2.00 for nonstudents, and are available at the box office in N ott Memorial Theater, or by phone at 370-6153 any afternoon except Sundays. There will be a free preview performance given on Tuesday, May I. Reserve your tickets now, or do what Tommy Flowers does: waik in backwards and they'll think you're coming out. . . . Levfs.

C\ grade, When I asked a faculty member about the possibility of this he informed me that it wasn't allowed at Union College. 1 eouldn't understand the reason for this and Gonsequently asked a member of the Administration who happened to be in the · lounge. He informed me that one purpose was to find those who were qualified for graduate schooL He felt that if a student earned only a \C'' grade the first time he took a course he shouldn~t have another chance. He also suggested sitting in on the course for no credit if the student wanted to learn more about the subject. To me this is a little like .telling the student that the primary purpose of a college is elimination, not education. Those students who may take longer to learn selected material are not given the chance. If a student has personal problems or even a period of depression his grades are sure to be affected. So the College says \we're sorry\ but the student still has to pay the price for a bad semester. At a. time when anxiety and suicide is higher among students than among any other group of people in the country, care should be taken to alleviate some of the burden. Since I'm paying $2700 a year to learn, 1 feel that I should decide how much I can learn, not the College. That a student should sit in on a class for no credit i~ equally ridiculous. However unfair the present grading system is, it is a system which the student has to live with. What possible good does it do a student to acquire additional knowledge if no one else is aware that the student has this knowledge. \Per-sonal Satisfaction\ isn•t going to get a student into graduate school or a good job upon graduation. As an alternate system to the present one, I would propose allowing the student to retake a selected number of courses. Another alternative would be to· limit the courses a student may retake to those included in fulfiiJing the requirements for his major. Another qualification would l:le that the grade earned the final time the course was taken would be the student's grade even if it was lower than the original grade . In considering this situation the College should keep in mind the fact that students do- have problems and shouldn't be penalize'd for them. The College should a:lso be reminded that it's the student who will have to either attend summer school or take an overload to retake any cotirse to improve his grade. Therefore this change wouldn't create difficulties with scheduling . It would also increase the student's level of education after four years {lt Union College. Dan Burns '74 Elections This year, in order to insure fairer, quicker results, with less of the confusion that has predominated in past elections, the Steering and Election Committees have decided to use a centralized voting system Voting will be held on Tuesday, April 24, from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. in the Student Center, Room 101.

Page4 .. Board ·of Trustees It is our contentton that there is no position within the Governance structure of Union College that carries with it as much responsibility and importance as the position of Student Representative to the Board of Trustees. This being the case, making the correct choice of a candidate to be the students' advocate is not only necessary but cru(;lial; if the purpose of student representation on the Bt>iud is to be realized. Attempting to see one's self as qualified to assume this position must involve much perspnal introspect~on, the ability to analyze what has happened in the past, and the realization of the uncertainty of the future. ln as much as one can never achieve these necessitjes, it bas only been through a nearly constant exchange of ideas, aspirations, and beliefs that we have come to feel ready to put forward our respective candidacies for this office. Initially we ran apart; WQ now realize that these actions coald serve only to divide the support of those who feel as we feel about the role a student trustee must assume if he is to be effective. Running as two separate and distinct candidates can serve only to sabotage those things that we hope jointly to achieve, and in tlte process possibly allow someone of a different mind to benefit through this myopic perceptio!l. In that this is how we feel, we have decided that only one of our names will appear on the ballot for the office of Junior Class Member to the Board of Trustees. However, this does not mean that either cari'didate has divorced.· himself from the representation CONCORDJENSIS, Friday, April 20, 1973 Candidates' Statements NOTE: ALL STATEMENTS FROM CANDIDATES HAVE NOT B)j;EN EDJT.ED BUT ARE PRINTED,\ EXCEPT FOR CHANGE IN SALUTATION AND CLOSING, EXACTLY AS WE RECEIVED THEM.

In respect to this political office, we feel that we are of as close to one mind as two separate individuals in this situation can be. We would like to feel that we have gone beyond individual personalities and in respect to this candidacy, we ask that you do the same. We are asking not that you make any conce!'sions or changes but simply that you join with us in a unified effort to gain the position. It is our firm belief that this candidacy can only be improved as a result of our actions. It is our wish that we can transfer the benefits of .this decision to you, the students of Union College. We ask for your assistance in making this desire a reality, and seek your continued support for this candidacy. We hope to come in contact with many of you in the time that is remaining.

These channels are, however, limited; and the vice-president is in turn restricted by these limitation~. in the amount of things he can actually do, regardless of what his campaign proposes, One of the channels that is open to him is the Steering Committee. communication between , the members and the classes they represent. The student government should present to the administration the legitimate academic desires of students and demand direct answers instead of buck-passing. The high prices at toe bookstore can be reduced .through a non-profit co-op system with · grants-in-aid as ·employees. Finally, the development of the student center must be strongly supported as a nucleus of campus life and as a location for certain student se-rvices such as a central mailing system. These and other issues are of vital importance, Hopefully, with an active student government and with a government that knows that apathy can be overcome if there is stimuJation from concerned representatives, improved ,communication and participation may be facilitated. I think \that as Vice-President I can do much to achieve these ends. NEAL SCHWARTZ The main job of the vice- president of the Student Body is to serve as the chairman of the Committee on Committees. This body is .empowered to establish and supervise all student consortiums. These groups must be coordinated effectively to insure efficient ways of finding scdutions to student problems. President I see the purpose of the Steering Committee as primarily two things: I) a unifier of the student community and a body of individuals around which stu!ient life does center, and 2) a voice of student sentiment to the .administration (whether the administration chooses to listen is outside the jurisdiction of student gover;nment). The school system invests in the Steering Committee more influence in the first of these two respects and less influence in the second. For this reason, I find it important that in the coming year, regardless ofwho sitson the Steering Committee, this body more fully exercise its capacity to unify the student community here at Union College, and in turn lessen its intent on provoking the college administration. I want to see the members of the Steering Committee become more involved in various aspects of student life · so that the community may better revolve around the body that has been established expressly for that purpose. The Steering Committee is not a servant of the students of this college; it is intended as the center of this student community. I ask your support in realizing this potential in the coming year. People must be kept informed on the activities of the Steering Committee and its sub committees. This has seemed to be a main problem: lack of communication between the students and their government. If ties could be established and more stu.dents. participated, we could work more easily towards a better JONATHAN LEVIN community. LARRY BROWN My candidacy for President of the Steering Committee actually began when I observed my first student election at Union College. I was pleased with the candidates' enthusiasm. I respected their hopes of accomplishing sucll\ things as \ending student apathy\' or building a \true community.\ But I have long been disillusioned with the lack of action on the part of student · government to solve students' day-to-day problems. For this reason my platform includes specific remedies for problems of student services, intramural sports, the computer center, housing, West College, and the expression of student opinion to government. I realize, and hope that you., too, will realize, that these ideas represent just a beginning. My solutions to these problems are simple and feasible, yet these are the ones that must be dealt with first, Student gover.nment must face its responsibility of working diligently for the solution of real problems. This is my pledge to you. I ask for you to support me, Li}rry Brown, candidate for President of the Steering Committee. Please vote, this Tuesday, at the Student Center; We can get some things done. DAN WOLFE The President of the Student Body presides over the Steering Committee and sits ex·officio 011 the All-College Senate, In this Levrs· dual capacity, he must assume primary responsibility for .coordinating the functions of Student Government with the -student involvement on the All· College Senate (highest representative decision-making body on campus), the President can act affirmatively to assure responsive and effective student representation in College Government. The Steering Committee is not the Student Government: it is merely the working base from which to organize broader student participation. The President, as head of this committee, must be willing to seek out general student opinion and act responsibly in accordance with it. Though· he is certainly in a position to initiate, the President's role is not to dominate Student Government; rather he must work actively to encourage stro·ng student participation in pursuing student goals. Student interest and participation in government can be more meaningful if students are informed of the activities of the Steering Committee. An agenda for each meeting should be published, in advance, in order to alert students to the issues. Students must be informed of the activities of their elected representatives and this is, indeed, the duty of those representatives. It is my beli:ef that Student Government can be an effective force in improving student life at Union. The Student Center will represent a major improvement. I am hopeful for its future as a unifying force within the Student Body, and for its potential for expending the range · of student activities at Union. Student Government can be effective if we aU work together. I respectfully ask for your c~ntinued support ~n this election. . _ . __ .

FRANCESCO ISGRO I'll make this sta:temeii.t as brief as possible since i presume that due to the large number of candidates, you may have to edit some of the letters you will receive. There will be talk of reform within the present .structure of the steering committee, and endless proposals will clutter Conco.-dy. True, the present syst~m is not at its best, but it is also true that the majority of students get bored with the rhetoric screamed from all sides. Since most candidates will have solid platforms, I'd like to go on record for being the first candidate to run on a liquid one. I'd like to see a cleaner \Brook chat Bounds.\ I'd like to see some grass grow along. its banks.

I'm Debbie Glasser running for Class representative to the Committee. and I'm of '75 Steering In our age of tremendous general apathy it seems only appropriate that l have chosen \The Return of Motherhood and Apple Pie\ as the theme of my platforoo. With this theme of return to tradition there are a myriad of old campus customs that could successfully be .brought . back. to Union in order ··to finaiiy shake off that pseudoliberalism of the 60's. Among these are a formal Junior prom (which could quite charmingly take place at the elegant- Girling Center), a freshman initiation with beanies and all (what better way for frosh to be introduced to the \real\ college life- a,nd for the upperclassmen to tid themselves of.

With·out a knowledgeable student body it is impossi hie to ha v~ true representation. Once this ~as happened, I would try to establish a list of student priorities .. Too often,. smaller activities are financed while those that pertain to all students are left un- supported. Thro!lgh my work on the Student Senate last spring and as chairman of the Elections Committee for the past year, l have gained valuable experience on the workings of Student Government. With this experience, in addition to my involvement in tllaily· different campus activities, I feel that I am well qualified to represent this year's sophomore class. For the last few weeks, the campus has been alive with some emotionally charged issues. Students must realize that m(lst of the candidates are annoyed by the administration's handling of the Hebrew program, puzzled by different tenure solutions, and would like to see more lenient dog restrictions. Besides, these are college policy problems to be solved by the All-College Senate. Representatives to the Steering Committee are the students' voices on the day-to-day, students' problems such as: housing, film haps, and t~e student center.

MITCH WEISBURGH The student body ·of, Union ·College has not made itself an integral part of the government of the school. Its opinions go overlooked by the administration, administrators · favorable to student interests are effectively blocked, and · courses heavily subscribed are deleted from the curriculum. The purpose of the Steering Committee is to present the views of the student body to the All College Senate and Administration and to influence their decisions for the benefit of the students. I am running. for the Class of 1975 representative to the Steering Committee so that I can bring the ideal into practice. I feel that student ideas should be better represented in administrative decisions and I am calling on you to support my candidacy in order to increase the student voice in those decisions. To increase student influence, I propose that the Steering Committee take a more active part in the hiring of the new Dean of Students. I .will also look into the feasibility of ma~ing the Dean of Students an employee of the Steering Committee. To give the students more voice in determining and regulating the curriculum, and all operations of Union College, I propose to initiate an in depth study of the merits of the '·courses; activities, and policies of the college. Finally, to ensure a united student effort, I suggest that the student trustees be non-voting members of the Steering Committee. Thus, if you feel that the student government should be a more effective outlet for student ideas and opinions, elect me, Mitch Weisburgh, Class of 1975 representative to the Steering Committee. CONCORDIENSIS, Friday, April 20, 1973 Class of '76 Steering Committee KOHEL HAVER To the class of 1976 and other inten~sted students: Student governments were _not designed to be powerful organizations, their pl'imary function is to provide an input for individual ideas into an otherwise in!)enetrable bureaucracy. The organization fails if it is not effective in achieving this representation, and if it does fail it is the responsibility of concerned students to create a desired efficiency in the system. The Steering Committee should not exist as an elitist organization this way, issues can. be brought before all the college committees and appropriate action taken by a committee or group -of committees. This would also serve to make the committees function as a unit. Union is a small college and there is no reason why all student concerns cannot be acted upon. It is very important that the Steering Committee be receptive and cooperative with students having legitimate complaints. If elected to the Steering Committee, I will work to provide such a Committee. for the pleasure of a few ALA~ GNESSIN remammg bureaucrats, but As a candidate for the Steering shauld seek to represent the Committee, representing the Class people.

Thank you. committee's position should not DON LEACH The arrival of new Deans of Stndents and Housing presents a great opportunity for changes to be made in college life. Next year, the Steering Committee must be an active organization working for the students and helping to institute these changes. In general, the job of the Steering Committee is to supervise the work of the individual committees. In the past this job has been handled rather passively and thus, many things bave been left undone .. As a member of the Steering ComMittee I 'Would adv6ca:te a m()re active leadership from the Committee. To achieve this I 'Would like to see at least one Steering Committee member attend each student committee meeting. This person would then re!)ort back to the Steering Committee. In this way the Steering Committee can coordinate the activities of the committees and also lend them suggest,ions and guidance: Not only is it important that the Steering Committee provide leadership, but it is also important that this leadership be ditected toward the fulfillment of the needs of the students. To acltieve this I advocate frequent cpen Steering Commi~tee meetings and also open meetmgs at which each of the student comm~ttees will be represented. In be one of ·passive waiting, it should be that of initiative and action. It can, if it so desires, become a constructive and an effective voice within the governmental structure. To accomplish this task, one major pre.-condition must exist: It is not competent members, since I believe that most Union students, including . my · 'rivals; have the capability, if they so desire, to administer this committee as well as most. lt is not a re-organization and strengthening of the committee structure under the Steering Committee, ~o as to gain mobility and coordination of community aims, though this i.s indeed necessary. Nor is it an injection of further power and authoti,ty into this organ. · What the Steering Committee needs is a dialogue, a strong and constant dialogue between itself and the students. It must be continuously absorbing student sentiment and needs. It must, above all, communicate to the college community. It must pass on to them what is occuring, how it is occuring, and why it is occuring. There is no excuse for the rampant ignorance amongst the students of our governmental tasks and functions. Once this dialogue, this communication has been established, then and only then can the Steering Committee act ACS At Large Rep. HARRY LESSIN individually, rather than ban all dogs from the campus? The dogs add a little fun and excitement to the campus atmosphere. Banning them is not the answer. Now that the new student center is a reality, let's not waste the chance we have. Carnegie is a huge building with an incredible amount of potential if funding is available for it. I'd like to .make sure that it is. The intramural sports program is a monumental mess. 1t is poorly organized, poorly regulated, and there are few, if any, officials. Not everyon~ is talented enough to play on a varsity team. They should have a chance to play in decently tun intra murals . effectively. Based upen this dialogue they can determine if the committee intra-structure needs re- organization into a more viable force. Based upon this dialogue, the Committee can determine what powers and authority they might require. Based upon this dialogue, the Committee can confront the Administration when necessary, and lobby for cem.munity rights and needs. This is what I feel. I camiot, · nor will I, make any commitments, unless it ·is the commitment that I will try. KELLEY NEWTO~ In December I had completed plans to transfer from Union. Some time over vacation I decided that l would lose a great deal if I left Union College. There is a great deal of potential at this school; unfortunately, it is virtually unrecognized. Now, I'm running for Steering Committee to make use of student power available. We have the power and means; now we need students who are willing to work out students' problems, from housing to meals to the new Student Center. I want to work to make Union a place where it is more worthwhile to stay. Secretary ALAN· BENVENISTY It has coriie to pass that the students of Union Coll(lge have transgressed the opportunity • of active involvement in t-he workings of the student government. One of the objectiyes of the institution of the Steermg Committee was to allow for student · participation in var~.ous areas using the cmrumttee membership to achieve these means. Yet, many of these committees are currently undersubscribed. There is no justification for the dichotomy between the student interests and the interests of the Steering Committee for the very reason that they were conceived as one. As secretary of the student body, one of my responsibilities will be to convey the workings of the Steering Committee to the students and ignite an interest in the student community that will hopefully result in more involvement. This is my primary interest. I intend to work diligently ort this job and would appreciate your support. Th~nk you. The Fifth Annual Sigma Chi · Clambake will be held l4.pril 28.

My one comment here is that it is funny thilt the administration can afford to spend $100 a week ($3000 a :year) to hire a dogcatcher, but, after scouring the college's $10 :million budget, they failed to come up with $4000 to fund a program that was subscribed to by 120 students this past year and is the largest introductory language course in the schoo~.

I feel are the responsibilities of this office. A representative from each of four divisions and one at large is elected to the AU-College Senate in an effort to represent every student in the college. Unless communication with the student body is maintained concerning each and every issue the Senate is able to deal with, this effort becomes ineffective. The representative should be willing to• work hard and in every capacity to be aware of student opinion and to support it in the decision processes Government. of the Student Information should be able to travel in both directions, to and from the student through the representat-ive. Reports concerning Senate issues distributed to all parts of the student body, with a chance for all interested students to · pose qnestions they might have and to voice their opinions on these matters would' be an answer. Student support is essential for the success of the functions of our representative Senate. Only through participation can student interests be best provided for. I urge everyone to vote on these elections, as this is the fU'st and most important step in making our student Government a clear representation of the student body. PETER TA VINO l would like to take this opportunity to announce my candidacy for the Divisidn IV representative to the All-College Senate. Perhaps my. best learning e~periences for such a position were gained through my work with the Union College Student Chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers. During my term as president, I came to believe -ihat the concept of student apathy is, in general, untrue. I noticed many people taking an additional interest in their departments by working with professors towards non-academic goals. Two major issues currently facing the college are those concerning dogs and traffic. The Developmental Committee of -which I am a member has done much to improve campus appearance and is presently proposing a new traffic regulation system. As temporary head of the Court on Traffic and pets, I have gained much insight on the parking and dog problems that have arisen. Union presently faces a problem along with other schools of decreasing science and engineering applicants. My participation in last summer's College Preview Program broadened my awareness· of this problem and led to a greater understanding of how our division functions. Because of my familiarity with key issues and a sincere concern for Division IV, •1 would ask that you elect me as your representative. .,.._ ..... -- -4lilo-- - •. t Olaualitr 1 s t t • t 1 st spccialiling • f p in hot dogs f f rize with h~.--st hot S:IUCC in l0\\0. 1 ·Rat Dogs t f' S<•n·in}f Breakj{tsl, f f Lunch & Dinner t · f Open 1 days a week t t • t Mon.$ Thurs. 6-1 a.m. t .

Page6 CONCORDIENSIS, F'riday, April20i 1973 ' Federal Fund Allocations Speci~l to Concordiensi$ In an attempt at understanding the present federal financial aid policy Concordiensis will, from time to time, present articles exploring the general area of federal fund allocations. This article, the first in a series, deals with military appropriations and moneys allocated to_ Human needs. $216.2 BILLION VOTED BY CONGRESS .IN 1972* MILITARY AND DEFENSE RELA'tED 55.5% GENERAL REVENUE SHARING (including non·mi_litary aid)- NON•MILITARY 44.5% 5.1% AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES For the purposes of analysis the total amount of federal expenditures in 1972 will be presented in Military and Defense-related versus Non- military Expenditure form. References made to the pie chart that accompani~s this article as , well as specific expenditure data have been obtained from the Friends Committee on National Legislation Washin.gton Newsletter of March, 1973. Further information can be obtained from the Friends Committee at 245 Second Street, Northeast, Washington, D:C. 20002 or, by phone, (202) 547- COMMERCE AND LABOR COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION· 4343. I The Congress of the United · States voted a total of 216.2 billion dollars in calendar year 1972. This includes all appropriated funds. It should be kept in mind that some of this money will be spent in fiscal 1973, which ends June 30, 1973. Military and Defense-related spending comprises 120 billion of this 216.2 billion dollars. This is. computed as 55 percent of total expenditures. This 55 percent includes the following expenditures: *The 1216.2 billion includes all funds appropriated ·by Congress during calendar ·1972, r®ardless of whether the money was Spent In the ftscal year ·ended.June 30, 1972, or allocated to the .year ending June 30. 1973 The breakdown (in mtllions) 1s as follows. GE;NERAL GOI.(ERNMENT (including Admmis1ratron of.Justice} Military expenditures total 38- 39 percent or 83,006.0 ·million dollars. This category includes money spent on military personnel, opeTation and maintenance, procurement of equipment, research and development teliting, civil defense, selective service, military aid and related activities. Veterans and other costs of past wars account for 5.89 percent of the total expenditure or 12,727.6 million dollars. This figure includes all moneys earmarked for veterans' rights and benefits, memoria:! and army cemeteria 1 expenses, and permanent appropriations for the Veterans Administration. Finally, administration of the National Debt accounts for 11.23 percent of total moneys or 24,274.0 millions of dollars. The National Debt is accounted under the category of miliary expenses because it is at least 75 percent war-created. The expenses here are 74.0 million for the Bureau of Public Debt and 24,200 million in permanent appropriation for interest in the public debt. Non-military expenses comprise 44.5 percent of total federal expenditures as follows: Space exploration: 1.58 percent or 3,420 million dollars NOTT ST.

This is a unified budget. A unified budget is one that allows the administrative budget to be cojoined with trust funds. Trust funds do not belong to the govemment; they are simply held by the government in trust for the people ·of the United States. To quote the late Senator Allen Ellender of Louisiana, 'This misleading accounting practice, which was first adopted in fiscal year 1969 by the previous administration ... is based on the false assumption that the surpluses accumulated in the various trust funds ... can be counted as revenue and used ... to offset deficits in the administrative budget. It actually serves the purpose of deceiving the American people as to the true cost of government.\ Acording to the FCNL, the \bulk ef trust funds - notably Social Security - is non-military.\ The effect of this unified budget presentation is. the appearance of more moneys being allocated for non-military expenses than is actually the case. It also gives the impression, says the FCNL, \that military spending is but a minor part of our budget.\ The developing world takes up 2.31 percent or 5,001.2 million dollars. The-se funds include development loans and grants, and emergency co,ntingent fund, the Peace Corps, 'f~e Alliance for Progress and other related activities. Other foreign relations account for .39 percent or 848.5 million dollars in the form of moneys to · International Organizations, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the Panama Canal Zone Government, the United States Information Agency, and other related funding. Agricultural and other .natural resources account for 5.09 percent or I 0, 999 million dollars. The remammg non-human needs-at-home expenses are 3.52 percent (7,607.2 million dollars) for Economic Development, Labor, Commerce, and Industry; 2. 15 percent ( 4,642.4 million dollars) for Communication and Transportation; 1.11 percent (2.409 million dollars) for the Administration of Justice; 3.84 percent (8,294. 7 million dollars) in General Revenue Sharing, and 2.80 percent (6,061 million dollars) for General Government Expenses. The remaining 2 L 70 percent or 46,908.1 million dollars is earmarked for Human Needs-at- Home as follows: Welfare ........... 14,866.1 million Housing ............ 4,324.7 million Education: Secondary and Elementary ....... 2, 710.6 million Higher Ed ........... 623.9 million Assistance to Schools in fed. funded areas ..... 2,337.0 million Health ............ 14,135.9 million Other ...... ~.\ ........ 7;909.0 _million The Bread and Puppet 'Theater . will be making a gala appearance on this campus Apl'il 28, 197~.

The thing about Caligula is what he shares With all of us - this understanding of the absurd. I hope I can also clftrify my mind in directing the .p.ay. Everybody talks about absurdity without really knowing what it is. It . has become a common.place. What is it? The play is not a pessimistic approach of the absurd;. it has moments of humor, of laughter, of tragedy. I believe . that my questioils as director will be the questions that people from t.h.e audience would ask themselves. Briefly, the play goes like this: It's a play about a Roman emperor who's extremely young - in his early twenties ~ What happens to him is that, through the sudden death of his mistress/ sister, he becomes aware that \men die, and ate not happy.\ It'S a very simple statement; he understands, and he wants other people to become aware (of the absurdity). He wants to try out a way in his mind that can help the mortal in their everyday living. So this is the issue which is behind and ttnderneath the surface, and which we have to follow throughout the play. Concordy: Just one final question. Camus, in his lifetime, played down the label of \existentialist.\ Yet, in Calignla, there is a very strong thread of the existential man. Number one, how is this resolved, and number two, kind- of implied from the first part of my question, is this resolved through the play's \positive'' approach? Ceratto: Well, Camus wrote the play during his \Happiness.\ period: this is how he labeled it. I would find in Camus the approval of rebellion, the idea of being lucid about everyday existence; I think a lot of us do \sleepwalk.\ We don't realize what's happening around us. Caligula might not, and does not, achieve that, and that would find again, Camus' approval, because he (i.e., · Caligula) didn't choose \the right way,\ as he says later on. The question at the end (of this play) is left up to the audience, as in a good number of plays, although . .. this play is not didactic. Each person should come out with his Uue to construction on the library addition, parking beh~nd the Library will be dosed startmg this Monday, April 2Jrd.

be am the not CONCOR.!JIENSIS, ·J:riday, Apri/20, 1973 Pagel ACS· Div. 2 BIL;t TAUS As a candidate for the All,.- College Sef!ate, Division 2, I realize that student life at Union . is far from .perfect. If elected, l will pursue the following policies, which· I feel need . to he emphasized;. S£Ct.JRffY. The immediate establishment of a vol11nteer student patrol is a high priority. Campus sectJrity is incapable -of providing. the tiec.essaty protection:, and. could be greatly improved _by a few . students patrolling tlie grounds. COMPUTER CENTER. The Computer Cetiter can no IQ.nger handle the large voh.une of people who utilize the facilities. Anyone who has waited hours or even days for their computer rtlti is only -too well aware of the inadequate facilities of the Computer Center. After the library addition is completed, expansion of the Computer Center should be Union's top priority goal. FINANCIAL AlD. lt is importllnt for the school to take a stand on the issue .of federal financial aid, and to rnake that stand known to other schools and Congrr;ss. I would ask for a student .referendum as. a vehicle ofc transmitting Union's concer-n to · Congress over the Supplemental Appropriations Bill before Congress. The Nixon Administration's proposal calls for a cancellation .of the National Direct Student Loan and'~ Economic. Opportunity Grant.' U n!ess the Supplemental Appropriations Bill is .passed, students may receive diminished federal aid next yeat. I would begin developing inter-c0llegiate cooperation to realize this goal. Whether or not the \quality of life\ at Union improves is dependent 11ot so much on the _individual efforts of aspirants to office, but by the collective action of all. We must all wo-rk toward reali~ing these goals. Thank. you. MARTY BERMAN I am running for Division II Representative to the Ali~College Senate. After sitting around for three years watching all the political goings on I have decided to stop .passing judgment and run myself. I· will try and keep this as. short as possible, realizing the pop1;1latity of long-winded articles in Concordy . .. and \brevity is a virtue.\ The. All-College Senate does nut have to he a rubber stamp for the administFation. Even though itll power is extremely limited (especially in the area of budget and priorities) this political body can still be a viable force if it can attain enough dynamism to effectively influence through its \opinion\ the seemingly arbitrary actions of the administration. There ate a wealth of issues on this campus but this is not the place for them. Instead of superficial campaigning to ' establish another popularity contest I would rather address myself to your specific questions. My room is 114 Fox (346-9136) so please feel free to caU or come over at any time with any question or suggestion you might have - or stop me as I'm walking along campus - it's your opinion that counts. After all, you make the representative. ACS Div. 3 WOODY LAUER For the past year, I have been a Steering Committee representative. Along with this office, l have served on the Conduct Committee. At the beginning of this academic year, it was decided by the Steering Committee that there was much need for improvement. in the housinE area. An Ad-Hoc Committee of three (which later increased in number) was formed to find the problems, then · propose a solution for both the long and short run. To do this we . h~ld individual dormitory meetings; since then we have had many meetings with Deans Malloy and Beam. Our long term soiution to any future problems that might come up, was to set up a housing board that will consist of the Dean of Students, his or her· assistant, and several students. This board will make all future housing policy decisions. This board has been approved on a. temporary basi~ by Provost E.nteman and is going to the College Senate for permanent .st~nding. The following is a list of thmgs that out committee has helped to. accomplish: the baSic idea for the renovation of Webster HaU came from our committe¢; we decided upon the policy' for _ next year;s ro'om assignrne.nts on the basis of a SIJrvey we had .taken. We chose the dorm improvements -that are ~(;,w planned for next year. These include carcpeting for West, laundry for West aild kitchenettes foi\ Solf:th. In spite of this I feel that there is much more ,opportupity to improve the different areas of college life through the College Senate than through the Steering Committee than there has been this year.

HANS BLACK The AU-College Senate, first conceived over two years ago, has still not fulfilled its potential. This body will never be a true governing force until some drastic revisions are made in the makeup of the Senate. Of primary importance is the fact that the senate is restricted to an advisory role on all matters of the college budget. Perhaps this can be achieved by possibly including two members of the Board of Trustees to sit with the All- College Senate. It appears that the AU-College Senate endorsed the Hebrew program upon recommendation from the Curricular Affairs Committee as early as February. Again the key to this entire controversy seems to be a budgetary one; the student represented Senate cannot effectively deal with the problem. On Thursday, Aptil the 12th the College Senate held an open meeting. A handful of students that were not reptesentativ~s attended. The students however cannot be blamed, in fact the meeting was very poorly a~vertised by the Senate. It seems that the students are not aware of the actions of the Senate. Perhaps even worse the Senate is at a loss to pr.operly represent the s\tudertts . ~ . ' ·' smce 1t Is not aware of student sentiments. In addition, · the· ··s~udent voice\ Concordy was also ll.ot present. It is the responsibility of the AU-College Senate to make certain t.hat it can function adequately under the present governanc~ system. I hope that I ·will . be . able to responsibly represent the students in the Senate, and initiate changes in the function -of the senate where these changes would be in the bc::st interest of the students and their respective wishes and desires.

Spring films In an attempt both to upgrade its own visibility on campus and to provide students with an enjoyable learning experience, the Department of History is sponsoring a Spring Film Festival, with movies to be shown each Monday night from April 23 to May 21. Each presentation in the series, entitled \The Film As History,\ will begin at 8:00 P.M. in SS 0 16; the showing of the films will be preceded by brief introductory remarks by the hast professor of the evening which should enable the audience to gain some historical background concerning the era with which the film deals. After each film's conclusion, there will be a general discussion in the Social Science Faculty Lounge. Admission is free and refreshments will be served. · Professor Joseph Finkelstein, Acting Chairman of the History Department, initiated the concept of a film series with the belief that by the. Spring semester many students are bored by the Smith Continued from page 1 rob another\ student of his rights. If any one student takes too much, oversteps his boundaries, he \screws somebody.\ A student may call for help from the Dean of Students in enforcing dorm regulations. Often, in Dr. Smith's experience, such calls are merely for the purpose of testing the system. However, the Dean must be able to distinguish at what time such requests are genuine calls for protection from the excesses of other students. In general, Smith does not wish to enforce regulations. Rather, he would -enforce standards, making sure everyone knows that a meaningless rule is meaningless, but at the same time holding all members of the College accountable for what they do. Relations betWeen and with students was Smith's main theme, and would be his major concern as Dean. He would be receptive to any problems. As an illustration he proposed that a freshman might conie to the Dean of Students for advice, because the student's girlfriend is preg.nant. That type of counselling should be done by whomever is most competent to do it, Smith noted, regardless of his position in the hierarchy. Smith would keep 'his office open at almost all times; it must be located where it is \ab!lolutely lllQst accessible to students.\ He also sees nothing wrong with stu?ents coming into his hotne, which would have to be Within walking distance, .jf not right on campus. \It's an 18-hour j.ob,'' he said. · At Dennis<Jn, Smith often had \as many as thirty\ students come to his house to talk in the evening. He · referred to his experiences at the Ohio coed university in answering many of the questions posed. . Smith has left Dennison and, presently resides in Colorado, with his wife. Should he fail to receive the appointment as Dean here, Dr. Smith might \be a gatdener, o·r write another book, ·or teacli psychology.'' prospect of hearing guest speakers. He chose movies as an alternative because the film medium receives wide attention across generational lines. Professor Sherry Penny was chosen to head a committee charged with selecting films that are dr~matically sound and contain important historicaljcul- tutal themes. The following choices have been made: Ap.ril 23 ~ A Raisin in tbe Sun, ( 196 I) hosted by Professor David Potts, Starring (among others) Sidney Poitier and Ruby Dee. Directed by Daniel Petrie, with Lorraine Hansberry writing the screenplay based on her award-winning play. ThiS> story deals with the frustrat~ons and tensions, internal and external, of a black family living on Chicago's South Side. It is considered a powerful comment on the black experience in America. April 30 ~ lkiru (To Live), hosted by Professor Donald Thurston. Directed by Akira Kurosawa. A Japanese classic, this 1952 film concerns a dying man's struggle for meaning and against the sense of powerlessness common to modern life. May 7 - Rattle of Algiers ( 1966), hosted by Professor Neal Allen. Directed by Gillo Pontecorvo. This ltaiian production, which won 11 international a wards. uses vivid documentary simulations to recount the Algerian rebellion against French colonial rule during the years 1954-1957.

The key to the game in which the Celts never trailed was a spurt in the third quarter which increased their lead from 15 to 25 points, keeping the Knicks ·well out of range for a comeback. Havlicek, M.V.P. Cowens, and Co. ripped the Knicks in every phase of the game except outright ineptitude. Two nights agQ, the Celts came to Madison Square Garden in an attempt to take a nearly insurmountable 2-0 lead. On the contrary, they were rolled over by the ~nickerbockers by an even larger margin of 33 points, the final score being I29-96. The third quarter was again an important factor as the Knicks poured in 16 straight points as the Celtics were sent sprawling. As usual, the Knicks were led by Frazier and DeBusschere and~most unusually by Phil Jackson, who usually has trouble holding onto the ball let alone shooting it. Big Phil hit seven of seven outside 20 feet and no one I'rri sure was more surprised than he. One must wonder how two such teams could completely destroy each other in games just three days apart. Such games are certainly a waste for the fans on the losers' side. In Sunday's game on T.V._, leaning toward the Knicks in favoritism myself, I found it frustrating just to watch the futility of the Knicks and the overwhelming power of the Celtics. Instead I went outside and played a little T.F. giving up on basketball <~;nd looking to the fall and football. The homecourt advantage certainly had something to do with the decisions but l doubt if it was worth a 59 point margin in the two games. The only thing left is to point out the astounding quality of both teams. This ability to \rout one another\ in consecutive games is a great one and I think it shows how each team can take ju&t a slight advantage or a ·mental letdown on the opponent's part and turn it into a wide victory margin. After many close games during the regular season, these two slaughters have confirmed the class that each of these teams possess and again shows how evenly m~t~hed they really are.

Pave 8 CONCORDIENSJS, Friday, April 20, 1973 Union Nine Rally; Squeeze SUNY A by DAVE HElLBERG The Garnet basebaLl team won and lost in the two ·away games that were played this week. On Tuesday, Union journeyed down to Westchester .to face a tough Pace team. It was a match between two unbeMen small .. college baseball powers. However, someone had to lose. Re~retfully it was Uniof!, which emerged on the short end of a 6 to 2 score. Although Pace was highly regarded (read Monday's N.Y. Times), Union was a competitive foe but they were unable to take advantage of scoring opportunities. Also, the pitchiHg faltered for the first time this year. A flock of walks allowed Pace to score most of its runs. Even though Pace was undefeated, the team was disappointed that they were unable to play up to their potential. Nevertheless, despite the letdown at Pace, the Garnet immediqtely started prepari11g to meet another tough rival on the road Sti\JY Albany. In that game which was played yesterday, Uniofl showed that Williams Tops JV Lax by JOAN AND KIPP After a victorious romp over Siena on April 12, Union's JV laxmen took a turn and fell to the Ephmen of Williams, by the score 9-3. The Garnet efforts were recorded by Charlie Howe, who had two goals, and Jim Collin, who added the third. Of the nine goals racked up against the Dutchmen, Tom Belden scored six and the other three were accredited to a lad named Boehler. When the first quarter ended Williams led 2-0 as Belden scored twice early in the game.

Williams scored twice more leaving the Dutchmen down 5-2 at the end of the half. Union led off the scoring in the second half as Howe whipped in the final Garnet goal, 3:0 I into the third period. Scoring only once in the third quarter, Williams brought their total to nine with three shots on the mark in the final period. Leading the junior laxmen in scoring is Charlie Howe with five, followed by Jim Collin with four.

Joe U rschell's pitching was one outstaNding feature of the victory. He went the route and allowed only two nms to a good hi<tting Albany team. However, the highlight of the game was Union's dramatic rally in the top of the ninth inning. In this first really close game of the season, Union demonstrated that they could come through in the clutch. With the score tied at 2-2 Urschel! came to bat and helped himself by singliHg. Hot hitting Bob Bernhardt followed with another base hit. Now there were men on first and second and Bob Mitchel,! carne to the plate. He promptly po1:1nded another single which brought Urschell home with the winning run. That was how it ended: Union 3 SUNY Albany 2. This exciting win over a strong Albany team should provide the impetus to offset the tough loss at Pace and propel UDion to another victory string. The Garnet's record presently stands at four wins and a loss. This afternoon Union faced Norwich at home. The Garnet next face arch-rival RPI, Monday at 3:00 on Alexander Field. Freshman Goalie AI Ritchie by Jeff Weilburg Lax Fall to Ephmen 14-7 by FRANCESCO ISGRO Neither the eflo rt of goalie A l Ritchie, who made 21 saves, nor the efforts of the improved Garnet defense, were able to stop the fast plays of the visiting Williams laxmen, who last Wednesday throttled the Dutchmen 14-7. The Dutchmen dropped their record to 1-2, while Williams upped its to 4-1. The EphmaB due to a victory over Harvard and their present record, seem to be headed for national ranking in the top 15. The contest opened with Pro Hoop Williams dominating the first three minutes. Their first goal was scored with 2:21 gone in the clock, and there would have been more goals hadn't it been forthe goalie AI Ritchie who played like a pro for the first half. Captain Stan White, no. 35, p1:1t the Garnet on the scoreboard, with an assist from Dennis Walker, with 9 minutes left in the first period.

Sigma Chi Holds Clambake Sat. • by FRANCESCO ISGRO The U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has estimated that one out of every 20 children in the total elementary school education system has an o:ften-correctab le problem of minimal _ brain damage. This problem is not always recognized as such, and as a · result there exist very few schools in our country dealirrg with the correction of minimal brain damage. One of these few centers is the Wallace Village for Children in Broomfield, Colorado, near Denver. The Sigma Chi Fraternity has had for several years, as an International Service Project, the task of creating a fund which at some future date will be directed to a tangible addition to the facilities or programs of this school, which has trained children from many. states and provinces of the U.S. and Canada, and other nations. The Gamma Zeta Chapter of Union College, in conjunction · with ·the International Service Prqject, has held a clambake each of the past four years.

He is an ·artist living in Harlem during a race riot. Somewhere along the line he's gotten excessively wrapped up in his own fantasies and worldly knowledge, and he loses touch with what's real. The ongoing revolution is real, and so'. is his model Tommy (Felicia Collins). So real, in fact, that they scare him half to death. The other characters, Old timer ( Kris · Upshur), Cynthia (Jennifer Smith) and Sonny-Man (Bob Clemmons) serve to reinforce the idea that when you're not really in tune, even the dream of wine in the wilderness can be a dangerous beauty. The play is the work of Alice Childress, who was born in South Carolina and grew up in Harlem, where she studied acting at the American Negro Theater. Her most recent play was The Wedding Band, done with the New York Shakespeare Festival. The production is being directed by Virginia Lyle, whose credits here include Ondine, Peace (in which she played the title role), Day of Absence, and the choreography of ilisnetia. She describes her emphasis in this play as the basic warmth of the characters and the universality of their experiences.

The Mountebanks, in their never-ending effort to take over every square inch of Union College, have now invaded the Admissions Office. Leroy Moore, Assistant Director of Admissions, has admitted that he is making his acting debut in the coming production of Wine in the Wilderness. Wine is a comedy-drama that deals with manhood, womanhood and love, all within the Black experience.

Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, etc. Effecth'e March 1, 1973, the Higher Education Act of 1972 requires that any student applying for this type of loan must present a need analysis document and must show need for the amount to be borrowed and qualify for the federal interest benefits. This applies particularly to those students who have not filed a Parent's or Student's Confidential Statement, are not receiving aid f11om the College, and are applying for a loan under any of the above-mentioned programs. The College Scholarship Service has designed a special simplified form to be used in this case, called the Financial Aid Statement. These forms will be available in the Office of Student Aid after May 15, 1973. They will be processed through the College Scholarship Service, the fee for which has been established at $2.50, by the CSS. is a perfect example. He is an artist living in Harlem during a race riot.

Analysis Letters incompetence with the \obnoxious rem.a,rks\ (or remark?) of one p.etson and come up with some evil plQt against the Jewish students at Union is ridiculous. Anti-Semitism, or r~Cism in a.Qy fo_rni, is a much too serious and volatile charge to be Hghtl.Y. flung about? and. the evidence presented. does not merit that accusa:tion. Levelling such a serious charge in order to by DON KRONE There is a group of .people on campus who do repair work and maintain the physical appearance of the College grounds; some call them the epitome of mechanistic ineptitude while other euphemistically refer to them as the Maintenance Department. 1 do not profess to have taken an analytic examination of the maintenance situation nor will l offer a panacea to eliminate frustration and create bliss among those who have remained in a state of perpetu\al quandary over the inability to efficiently maintain the College. · . StudeD>ts perceive the maintenance problem in a different light from those in administrative positions who must guide and plan attacks on the decaying physical bodies within our gates. Both perspectives will be presented hopefully allowing the reader to draw his own conclusions. The problem can be best seen from a look at the miraculous missing urinals. These depositories for excretions by male Homo sapiens were removed from sections of Fox and Davidson recently and caused outrage by some disgruntled students. From their eyes there was no logical reason for the removal of the urinals. However, after a lengthy conversation with Robert A. Welch, Director of the Physical Plant, the rationale for this action was evident. It seems that the pipes leading from the urinals were two-inches in diameter and clog easily with lime deposits because the devices are not properly flushed by the users. When the amount of deposits reach a certain point the urinals overflow. Normal toilets do not face the same pt\oblems because of four-inch pipes and a greater volume of water which is flushed. The problem d1en redu.ces tothe fact that the communication between maintenance and the students was poor and may have eliminated the friction. Iti fact future college policy concerning the installation of urinals is that of treating them as anachronistic. No more urinals will be put in new or renovated buildings (a trend that is occurring across the country) because of the backup problem and the introduction of co- educational housing. Several difficulties have happened at one fraternity which seem beyond explanation. The curtains in the lounge area were taken down by the students but then mysteriously disappeared. A check with Maintenance and Housekeeping as to their whereabouts proved fruitless. But when a check was made by maintenance workers in the Housekeeping Office the missing curtains suddenly materialized in several boxes. Recently, approximately one dozen chairs were removed by maintenance- for some spot welding. Unfortunately, the dining room chairs and an end table are either not now locatable or are beyond the perception of humans. A similar situation resulted when maihtenimce undertook the repair of sevetal couches. Two terms after the authorization for their fixture was granted a few couches were removed while another was Ieft behind. One term after that some of the couches were returned except for one which has vanished. Examples such as the above are numerous and can be well documented. The most depressing fact is that while these incidents were occurring the rocks along· the campus roads were being repainted and a ·meticulous job of repainting of the blue gate was in progress. Maintenance has a staff of 54 personnel {electricians, photos by Bill Erichson carpenters, painters, plumbers, fitters, bOiler t(mders, · ·grounas· crew), 10 janitors, and 36 cleaning ladi~s. Their budget runs awund· $600,000 for salaries and $600,0.00. for. materials and supplies. The department also hires students for the summer and part-time help for the fall and spring cleanups. Mr. Welch stressed, \a shortage of manpower· and a tremendous amount of work to do.\ His office operates on what he calls the \fire-fighting principle,\ \We don't have the necessary staff or time for preventative maintenance, we take the problems as they come day by day,\ said Welch. Last yeat the Maintenance Department asked f-or eight additional men but received just one apprentice. For the 1973-74 budget year three new employees will be added, a warehouse worker, a heating cqutrol man and a truck-driver laborer. Next year if the tentative budget is accepted the repaving of roads will take place, and repairs afid painting will be done at South and West College and at Hickock House. Budgets figures_ for the . next. two fiscal years wi!r be submitted to the Board of Trustees at their June meeting. Proposals for painting and carpet cleaning in the S·ocial ·science and Humanities Buildings will be included. Maintenance must also operate the heating systems for all the buildings on· campus.,. \(his· monumental . task requires . 1,000,000 gallons of No. 6 oil pet year as well as repairs.. Despite the addition of the Science and Engineering Center the work load on the present facility has been decreased. Inefficiencies in Butterfield, Bailey, and Steinmetz were corrected when the structures were renovated. The Maintenance Department also is responsible for repa·irs on the College's 42 vehicles. These 22 unregistered and 20 registered vehicles include cars, dump trucks, pick-ups, jeeps and ladder trucks. When asked what would be necessary for his department to run efficiently Welch responded. To the Editor: \We would need almost double ·the staff and a budget of ar.ound $2 million to meet the students expectations.\ It is . obvious that these needs cannot be met under budget constraints. It may be a reasonable idea to have the Maintenance Department issue a yearly reporJ to the students and administration to explain their difficulties so that the average student can at least be rational in his view of the maintenance situation. In his letter to the editor, George Bain correctly points out that the manifestations of anti- Semitism are often less severe than pogroms, ccmcentration camps and Hitler.

Congress and tlie People: Relations of c 0 ngre,ssmen to their constituencies\ before a small gathering in SS016. Professor Fenno spent much time travelling with ten congre~sm~n and two congressmen-elect to observe what the representatives saw in their constituencies. Fenno observed that the Congn:ssman's views are differentiated, ·for he sees many aspects in his constituency, and that most of his actions are \shaped by his desire for re-election.~· \-This dependence,\ he says, .. colors most of his perceptions.\ The· Congressman perceives many discrepancies 'in hi's constituency, mainly between who he perceives to be his supporters, and his non- supporters. P.wf. Fenno stated that the cQngressinan) ''ac_tivities concern his 're-election constituency' first, and his practically free to do as they wish. Prof. Fenno told of one congressman, who came from a predominantly Jewish district, who said that he felt so secure in his position that he could even oppose an arms sale treaty with· Israel. When asked how he would reply to public scrutiny for such an action, the congressman replied that the people had such trust in him that he could say, ''The treaty didn't call for enough arms.•• Among his support-ers, the congressman has. a focus between the ha·rd core, or . \primary constituency\ and his re-election constituency, · catering especially to the hard:-core's needs. 7-9am 9-10: 10-ll 11-12 12-l pm 1-3 3-5 5-6 6-7 7-9 Cindy Wolfson Reynolds & Hobal't • Andy Pearce 11-12 Barry S.'Chiff 12·-:1 pl'Il ~elley Newton 1-3 Lou lnsler l0-12am 12-1 pm l-3 3-5 George Stanwick Kelley Newton · Mike Milson Phil Kass oppo·nent.s second.. The :ongressman strives to consolidate his el¢ction base and to keep his existing coalition intact.\ There may be certain constraints upon a .congn;ssman's actions. If the constituency is relatively .homogeneous, anq ·his views are harmonious with them, then constraints upon the office are minimal. Congressmen may overemphasize their perceptions of uncertainty with the electorate, but some feel that they have such faith in their constituency that they are Perhaps the most surprising observation by Prof. Fenno is that congressmen perceive personal characteristics to be more important with the constituency than issues. \The average congressman spends 40 weekends a year in his home district. The . safest and surest way to build on his base is to reinforce constituent support and trust by his style.\ Fenno noted that, \Escalating on issues is more likely ·to alienate supporters.\ The activities involved in promoting one's image is of primary concern to the congressman, and they may undermine his duties as a legislator. With congre·ssmen concerned with their image more than with the issues with which they are involVed, Prof. Fenno concluded by posing the question, \Are the people most likely to get elected, the best equipped to govern?\ Modern Dance New York Trip The Modern Dance Workshop is sponsoring a bus trip to New York City, ·saturday, May 5,. to see the Martha Graham Dance Company, and either the National Ballet of Canada (with Rudolph Nureyev as guest artist), the New York City Ballet, or Marcel Marceau; the great mimist.

Page4 Baseball Team Kills ,Norwich by DAVE HElLBERG Paraplegic defense by an overmatched Norwich team allowed Union to capture an easy 10-3 victory on Friday. Wally Borotto ·relieved faultering Steve Stockman in the fifth inning and registered his first vic.tory of the season, allowing no earned runs i.n the five innings tha-t he pitched. wally entered the game with men on first and second and no outs but allowed an RBI single. After that, he settled down and handcuffed Norwich the rest of the way. Offensively, Union had a field day with Bob Bernhardt, Ron Westbrook, and Rolf Wandel each collecting two hits. Also, ,Bernhardt, Wandel, and Bob Mitchell tagged doubles to add to the attack. Wandel and Greg Breedlove were the leading run producers as they knocked in totals of three and two runs respectively.

The game, played on Daley Field last Friday, was almost a rep.lay of last year's, when the Garnet pulled a I 3-12 upset. The Union Laxmen entered the contest hungry for a victory after two stright setbacks. With only one minute and one-half gone on the clock, No. 11, Dennis Walker, with an assist from Robert Grossman, whipped a clean angle~shot, putting the Garnet on the scoreboard. A couple of more attempts b.Y Walker and one by Jerry Dwyer were saved by Paul Bishop, Syracuse's goaiie. The Orangernen evened the contest ;ainutes afterwards, but 16 seconds after their goal, a solo by Bob Grabo put the Garnet back on the lead. For the next six minutes, it looked as if the game had narrowed .down between the Union offense and Syracuse's goalie. Grossman and Walker were able to each zip one in. while Walsh's shot was incredibly saved by Bishop. Syracuse came right back and within less than four minutes the Orangemen had four tallies. AI Ritchie, tending the goal fen Union, didn't look impressive, as he was only able to save a couple of shots during this period. The second period was opened with Union gaining control of the ball, thanks to Stan White's tactics, and Don Ward taking a shot which Bishop· again saved. Minutes later White's attempt suffered the same fate. The Orangemen stepped to a 2 point lead, their biggest in the contest. when Neville took Ritchie by surprise. The infuriated Garnet came right back, and Jerry Dwyer made his first tally of the season. Amazing Walker was able to score twice within the last 22 seconds, to give Coach Allison a 7-6 lead at the end of the first half. It is interesting to note that the Garnet scored four runs in the fifth while the half-time crowd from the Lacrosse game was watching. However, after the bulk of the crowd departed, Union was held in check. Never the less, Friday's victory over Norwich was a solid, well played effort by the entire Union squad. The Garnet travel west this week as they VISit U. of Rochester on Friday and Hobart on Saturday. * * * * Hillel meeting Wednesday night, April 25. at 7:30 in S.S. 112.

During the break, the dry pitchers were refilled at DPhi, while the masses shifted to the baseball field. The Garnets came back on the field well psyched up, and were able to totally dominate the third period. Hochschatner had Union;s first tally, and minutes later Walker added his 16th goal of the season. Then with 2:14 left on the clock, No. 24, Jim Thompson, slugged a 23- footer which caught Bishop unprepared. After this 3rd period burst, the Orangemen were able to chip away Union's 10-6 lead.
