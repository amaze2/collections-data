Squatters' Rights Alternatives Kleinkauf stated that Security is faced with an impossible task; it cannot provide 24 hour protection for every person or building on campus; hence, it cannot please all of the people all of the time. Further complicating the job is the failure of people to come forward with helpful information. Kleinkauf cited an example of this phenomenon in recent events at Fox. The doors. to the north wing of Fox have been consistently tampered with in the past week to prevent them from locking. In one instance, a door that had been repaired at 11:30 in the morning was .. fixed\ again by 3:30 the same afternoon. When one door was made tamperproof by filing off the heads of the screws,. another door was tampered with in the same manner.

At the_meeting last Thursday, the members were unable to reach an agreement as to the best course of action. However, tlrree possible solutions were proposed: I) Leave the current squatter's rights, as is, 2) Keep squatter's rights, but adopt some new, specific modifications aimed at the specific problems that result from the present system, or 3) A total abolition of squatter's rights, and in its place, a student lottery based on class seniority which may entail a whole new set of problems.

Dr. Stineback is a member of the English department who specializes in American literature. The committee decided that the points of conflict between Prof. Stineback as stated in his appeal and the ad hoc committee's report were not serious enough to justify a hearing. An overview of the events that have transpired in reference to whether Professor Stineback should be tenured will be examined. Committee Created In October and November an ad hoc committee was formed consisting of four faculty members to investigate Dr. Stineback's qualifications as a member of the faculty, arid to make a recommendation to the Salary, Promotion and Tenure Committee on whether Dr. Stineback should be given tenure. In early December the ad hoc Program committee submitted their report . . to the S.P.T. committee with the · . . recommendation that Professor The Stude~t Light Committee Stineback should be denied . and the Secunty_Tas_k Force have tenure, characterizing Dr. announ~ed. a hghtmg pro_gr~ Stine back . as an average t~at . wtll mcrea;;e .the eXIstmg professor.

morals defined The article that appeared in last· week's issue entitled \Moral Turpitude\ has generated ·a\ great deal of response. Regretably, most of that respons~ was in the form of private conversa1.~0ns; only one student was courteous enough to relay his reactions directly to the editors. Several ambiguities were present in the article. First, the piece was authored by the editors-in- chief. All unsigned pieces are the responsibility of the editors-in-chie\r. Second, the \recent events\ referred to in the article involve accusations of sexual relations between faculty and students. No one has come forward to make these accusations public; thus, for obvious reasons, Concordiensis cannot print names or dates. Concordiensis is deeply concerned about this situation; not that it in itself is immoral or improper, but that no action seems to be forthcoming to protect the position of the student. Regardless of the details of any existing situation, if no action is taken, if no debate on what constitutes proper or improper behavior ensues; then the door .is left open for future situations that could be deleterious to students. The faculty, as a professional group, has an obligation to regulate the conduct of its members. The dangers inherent in sexual relations between students and faculty are obvious; and the faculty has an obligation to set forth a code of ethics that can both allow for modern conceptions of morality ana protect the position of the student. These points w~re not made clear last week, and for that error, the editors-in-chief take full responsibility. The article was a product of a frustration that can only be furthered by the reaction to it. It is a sad state of affairs when faculty are of the opinion that the student newspaper is run by a group . of irrational, irresponsible students who are unreceptive to criticism. It is just as wrong for people who have opinions or criticisms about Concordiensis to air them. only casually as it would be for Concordiensis to ignore those opinions. As the situation stands now, with faculty unwilling to air their complaints or compliments directly to those responsible, no progress can be made. ram cpo f8irne.ss At last, a means to cut down on the terrible competitive atmosphere at Union, and a means to· be fair to the B plus stud.ent. The highest credit is due our Dean of Students for his new insight involving · the twelve-point grading system. Any man who can beat a dead horse for so long that it manages to stand up by itself has a rare talent. We are indeed fortunate to have such a man on our side. Otherwise the decision of last year's steering committee to attempt to bury the dead horse would have kept Union in the cumulative dark for untold administrations. But why stop there? If a twelve-point system is fair .. thena twenty-point system is fairer, and a fifty- point system even more so. Why, we could have an infinite point system. Imagine getting a grade like pi, or e, or the square root of two. And it would all be in the utmost fairness. Professors would have no trouble deciding where each person belongs.

Is this the college's new attitude towards students' Dpinions? photo by Ra you said it details please Editors, Concordiensis; I was disappointed by your \Moral Turpitude\ editorial (although it was not labled as such, it clearly wasn't a factual article). lfs too bad that a newspaper is being used to create and propagate rumors as opposed to reporting facts or giving opinions on relevant issues. Is this to be ·continued? One thing a newspaper should not be is vague. \This school's administration ... did not take action on recent incidents.\ (to quote your editorial, found on pag. 5.) If we should know about these \recent incidents''. tell us. If you have the facts, you should print them, instead _of saying .(in effect) \we know somethihg you don't know\. Do you have the facts? If you don't (or if the campus shouldn't know about the \incidents\), why did you pri}lt \Moral Turpitude''? If you wish to deal in rumors, please do not do so in a newspaper. Could you please explain the reasoning behind_ \Moral Turpitude\? Could you please inform us, the campus. of the facts behind your innuendos? Could you tell us why a qewspaper like yours should spread gossip unsupported by facts? I await your reply. Yeurs. Joseph Millett, '77 smith knows Editors, Concordiensis: How lucky we at Uruon are to be protected by such a great statesman as Dean Mark Smith. Dean Smith has continuously fought for \the quality of student life~· in spite of overwhelming opposition from students. Just recently, in fact in the latest Concortly, Dean Smith \voiced the opinion that student oppositi<in would not sway his position\ regarding the twelve- point grading system. There is no need for us to take part in decision making, with Dean Smith to take care of us, as he has done so well in the past. After all, isn't Dean Smith in a better position than we are to decide what is good{or us'!Of course one might · argue that this is an isolated incident not relevant to the general way Dean Smith goes about making· decisions. Let us then look. at another important .issue that will affect most of us next fall, squatter's rights. Again in the last issue of Concordy, Dean Stl)ith expressed concern over the \proprietary attitude., (my room, my dorm, my hall, my school, my cou~try) an<( .. the ,effects. it had on student life. Once again Dean Smith's decision-making smacks of great statesmanship. Is Dean Smith going to yield under the pressure of most dormitory residents? \He says that the committee will not be impressed with m~ssive outpouring of student opinion ... \ We can only than~the Lord that He has pwvided Dean Smith to protect us from ourselves!

We, as members of that committee, w.oU]d like to· pr.opose that the present system of squatter's rights be. abolished in favor of some form of lottery; for the- following reasons: Problems First, the committee has decided, in agreement with a recent campl.ls poll, that it is . important for freshmen to have freshman roommates. The present ·system of· .squatters rights does not make this possible due to inadeqiJate ~oom space. With a diffe'rent room-assignment procedure, a sufficient number of spaces colild be set aside for fi<es:hmen. Second, many students returning from term abroad programs claim squatter's rights on their room, thus forcing many students, frequently freshmen, to change rooms. This is ail undue hardshi·p on many students that we feel can and should · be . eliminated. Third, squatters rights allows many individuals to retain a highly desirable room for many year:s, thereby depriving others of the chance to live there. Fourth, with the probability t·hat Davidson House and Riehm ond House will be co-ed next year, the abolition of come about as the result of the abolition of squatter's rights. Most importantly, it seems that the present system tends to stagnate many areas of the campus and greatly reduce social interaction. We feel there is a need for an alternate system that would encourage social interact ion instead. A system .forcing students to change re~identi::ll locations each year would greatly help to approach that goat Therefore, we feel that an alternate system - some form of a lottery - should be instituted to give all students an equal opportunity in housing, and also ena.ble more students to have a wider variety of living experiences on campus. We see this as a great benefit to the campus community; Alternatives On H:ousing Continued from Page I ' be made to move to nc;:w rooms or new dorms from term to term. They have a big enough adjl,lstment to make witho~t having to change rooms every term. With certain rooms set aside for freshmen, students may then decide to remain in their present rooms or to go into the lottery, the same way our current system works. The one major change has to do placed in dorms of their first or second choice.

Under the proposed plan, any student who is not on caii1pus tor a term cannot claim rights to a gi.ven room. This applies to any student who takes a leave of absence, moves off-campus, or takes a term abroad. A student who moves off-campus loses all rights to get housing on campus, unJess there is space available. However, those other students on leaves or studies abroad would be guaranteed a room on campus upon their return. They would give a list of their priorities as to where they would like to· ]jve, and according to seniority and available space, they would be This plan would eliminate the majority of problems caused by squatter's rights and provide the most satisfactory solution to an issue that concerns most students. The majority of students have indicated that they want squatter's r,ights. To totally ignore strong majority opinion and adopt ?n entirely new system tbat wilf inevitably create its own, new problems seems unjust and unwise. To try to work out the existing difficulties while meeting the wants of the majority seems the more fair and intelligent way · to solve the problem.

Benefits There are many social benefits to the campus that we feel would Governance Reform Ad Hoc Report One of the overriding problems of the present g<>vernance system is that it institutionalizes and; thus, reinforces antagonism among the students, the faculty, and the administration, In a9dition, the \&trticture leaves another group, the staff, outside of the governance ptQCess. What resiJitS is an atmosphere of mistrust Worsened by a lack of communication among (not to mention, within) the four groups mentioned. Furthetmore, · the present system -is so complicated and so spread out that,. in many situat-ions, it is unclear who should take initiative and how things should get done around .here. We .can shed more light on the problems by presenting the perspectives of tfte four gr.oups at Union. · The staff has ·no significant representation in areas that affect them. One of our objeetives is to solve the problem M the lack of a grievance .procedure for staff. The governance system has 'left student11 with the feeling of impotence in attempting to influence decisions. There are many reasons for this feeling, the most important being: ( l) an ineffective system o.f representation on the All~College Senate; (2) the dispersion of student leadership among the All .. College Senate Representatives, Steering· Committee, Student Trustees, R.A.'s, Interfraternity Cauncil, ete.~ and (3) poor channels of communicati·on between the students l'{nd the administration. Faculty dissatisfaction wit:b tile present governance system touches most pointedl¥ upon its committee structure. Too often, committees are too. large and engage .. in routine. and unproductive Work on ill-defined problems and tasks. . When co'mmittee work might_ be productive., res.ponsibility is difftised into the hands of so many different committees and administrat()rs that little gets done very quickly .. T-his collective '•'un•responsibility\ has bred a more insidious attitude · -of irresponsibility in. some quarters which h:as intensified animosities rather than eased them. hi terms of the evaluati·on of ~dininistrators · at Union, the present structure decr.eas~s the reasonable accountability of admirtistrators: The existing diffusion and confusion allows the administrators an exctise for lack of initiative. The structure was, indeed, intended to decrease such administrative initiative l;mt it provided 110 source of initiative to fill the remaining void. Furthermore, the definition of f'Urtc-ti.onal areas of the administrative structure does not agree with: the definition of functional areas in the governance strt.\cture. As a result, there is a lack of communication, initia- tive, and accountability.

The following are the problems that the committee are considering listed in no particular order of importance: (I) Lack responsibility, causin_g or of power and. more specifically resultin,g from a) P·oor channels of communication between administration and students, h) Second rate people in st-udent government, and c) Elitism among students involved.

Clearly great diversity is possible. Grades may measl!re accurate, such a system would also require a comparatively large number of evaluations f~om which to determine the students final grade.

Under a 12 point system there would be no telling .the graduate school, one's parents, one's friends, or even oneself that one just missed that A, when the transcript clearly shows B-.

It seems obvious to me that this logic implies that the majority of Union students are somehow not intelligent enough to have a say concerning their environment. These changes certainly have a stronger effect on the students than they do on Dean Smith, who neither lives in a dorm nor faces the already stiff academic competition, which I and ma~y other Union students feel Will surely be worse~ed by the twelve point system. Regardless of how each individual student feels ab()ut these proposed changes, I think we should all be concerned when the Dean of Students shows such a blatantly negative attitude toward the majority voice of the students in decisions that greatly effect student life.

This tampering occun~ed for several days prior to the break-in Wednesday morning. To further complicate matters, Kleinkauf C:laims he is working with a staff that he describes as 'minimal.' That staff consists of 9 patrolmen; three men per shift. ln addition, students man the desks at Richmond, North, and the Science Center seven nights a week. Commenting on the adequacy of Union's .program as it now stands, Kleinkauf contrasted the present situation with that which existed. when he came to the campus in 1969. At that time, there were only 1200 students on campus (all male); and fewer buildings to oversee. At the time, the Security force possessed no two-way radio. The only way an officer could be contacted was through an answering service downtQwn who called the officer. The officer could· not contact the ~service, however, nor could they contact each ·other f9r assistance. At that time there were eight patrolmen on the force; and they walked their routes arouQ.d campus. Kleinkauf instituted a two way radio system, and put the patrolmen in cars. He explained this last .step by saying that two men just cannot cover the campus on foot nearly as effectively as they can in automobiles. , He described his ideal system, ·one that he has recommended to the B&P Committee; as invohri.ng 24 hour foot patrols centered on four posts around the campus. Implementing this system, L·ife • 1n an Industrial City The Union College arts department has launched a new project - the .production of a fine arts photographic portfolio ...

Kleink.auf cited the need for a bigger staff in the fact t,hat the patrolmen have worked an average of over 100 hours of overtime during the past four years. Further, Kleinkauf stated that pay scales here are not comparable to those of industrial security officers. Klein!<auf suggested tha.t students could assume some of the responsibility for their own personal safety and security. Specifically, he recommended: a) Keeping rooms locked whenever they are unattended or when the occupants are sleeping; b) Being alert for strangers in buildings or around dorms, and notifying security ( 6178); c) Tra~el in pairs at night whenever possible, and use t&e· escort service; and d) Do not tamper with any locking . devices or prop open doors that have been locked. ln line with this conception of making the campus 'security comcious,' the Provost has commissioi1ed · an ad hoc task force to study the security situation at Union. This group, chaired by Union sophomore Glenn Wolfson, is attempting to develop an 'overall phiiosophy' toward security at Union. Wolfson noted that the task force grew out ·of repeated student expressions of insecurity and fear. His committee will view Union's Security needs in the context of changing town and town relations, other college's programs, changes in student attitudes, and needs of the campus. This committee's report is expected by early in the spring term, but suggestions from the committee can and are being implemented before then.

Bryan, 51, is a graduate of Columbia University and Cooper Union. Gallery hours are 2 to 5 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday. The gallery, which is free and open to the public, is located in Schaffer Library. \Currently there is a tremendous controversy over the value of a traditional liberal arts education,\ she points out, \however it's not likely that Union's basic cur:riculum will change. By providing our students with solid, marketable experience, this program complements and . broadens the liberal arts education.\ Other colleges who are members of this program include Brown, Dartmouth, Tufts, Trinity, Wesleyan and others. Applications and screening for the program that will start this JuQ.e are to be accepted beginning March l at the Plac~ment Office. Ms. Miller and Ray Williams from the Venture Program will interview the applicants. \In our interviews, we'll be trying to determine two things - whether an applicant can really make something out of this work experience and whether there is a job with which we can match the applicant,\ says Ms. Miller. A biology major with an interest in · research might be offered a lab technician's job in Boston. A fine arts major with career goals in choreography might be placed with a New York City ballet company. This is a national placement agency and a student may be placed anywhere in the nation, depending on the job and the student's preference. \Basically this program enables students to be apprentices while they are still in college,\ say11 Ms. Miller. \ Technicolor® • Celebrating Warner Bros. 50th Anniversary(\tAWarner Communications Company I

.i Page6 CONCORDIENSIS, Wednesd4y, Febuary 5, 1975 Stineback (~ontinued from Page I · This was the first time that an appeal was ever made by a faculty member to the President and the Provost, and procedures pertaining to this and future appeals had to be instituted. The procedures instituted were that the appeal would first be submitted to the Salaries, Promotion and Tenure Committee. The committee would decide whether the appeal warranted a hearing. If a heating was granted then the S.P.T. committee would be the body to conduct the hearing. The committee has three options after the hearing. It can decide to sustain the original report of the ad hoc committee, or it can overturn the original decision and grant the Professor tenure or, finally, it can call for the formation of a new ad hoc committee to reinvestigate a faculty member's qualifications. There is a final structure that was instituted for appeal if there was denial at the level of the S.P.T. committee. If the faculty member chooses he can submit an appeal to the President of the College who would examine all relevant information and then make the final decision. As stated originally the Salary, Promotion and Tenure Committee this past Friday voted to deny Dr. Stineback a hearing on the grounds that the points of conflict in his appeal and the original ad hoc committee report ~ere not serious enough to ju8tify a hearing. Dr. Stineback has submitted an.' - . appear to President Bo-nner, who is presently considering the case. Students have shown their support of Professor Stineback. Approximately two dozen letters were submitted by students to the Provost. Secondly a petition was created by students that stated: \We the undersigned are deeply distressed by the denial of tenure in the case of Dr. David Stine back. We reject the apparent characteritatien of him as average cby his ad hoc committee and feel that he is at the very 'least a strong Professor by Union standards.\ This petition was signed by 133 of the I 68 that were contacted. In addressing the st~dents who were asked to sign the petition, it was emphasized that only those students who thought that Professor Stineback was a strong Professor and not just average should sign. Students are still in the .process of taking further actions in order to show their suppo~t of Dr. Stineback. Professor Patrick Allen, also of the English Department, was also denied tenure by the Salary, Promotion and. Tenure Committee. He is also in the process of appealing that decision. The Salary, Promotion and Tenure Committee has not of yet decided en whether to grant Professor Allen a hearing. BLITHER Housing Committee meeting Thursday.

PageS CONCORDIENS/S, Wednesday, Febrw,zry 5, 1975 Mosie Diamond in the Rough? by MARTY HERBERT The legendary Dav ill Bromberg, guitarist extraordinaire, made his UColl concert debut Saturday night at Memorial Chapel. He had previously appeared at the Coffeehouse a few years back and was enthusiastically received; such was the case this past weekend. However, the predictedly manic reaction of a UCo'Ilaudience is no indication of a particularly great concert, and this was also the case Saturday night. (I've always felt that a man getting sick on the Chapel stage would receive three, maybe four encores.) I suspect Dave Bromberg suffers from a severe musical identity crisis; he can't se.em to decide whether he's Bill Monroe, Buddy Guy, Van Morrison or Bob Dylan. He sings like Dylan with lockjaw, so !tis voice shouldn't lend itself to any easy manipulation. It's the guitar work.. Since the mid-sixties, Bromberg has dazzled the musical work with his tastefully clean and varied accompaniment behind Pat Sky, . Tom Rush, ,John Prine, Dylan, Paul Seibel, et<:. The fame he has received is fully deserved. Bromberg can play the instrument like nobody can-or rather \'like everybody can. Like Jerry Garcia, he takes a little Django Rheinhardt, a little Grady Martin from Nashville, a smitbering of B.B. King, some basic rock leads and comes up with a solo that defines definition. He's a classic on wax, but in concert it gets a little fuzzy at times. Saturday night, he opened up with some bluegrass tunes which are always a real crowd pleaser. Then he did a fairly tight, rocking version of The Holdup, from his first album. Coming rig!Jt out of that, he presented one of the evening's high points when, on solo electric guitar, he astounded the crowd with a demonstration of the hottest licks from jazz, country, blues and rock. Not bad- considering it was all within about one steaming minute. Hts hand, as musically schizoid as ne is, picked right up on it and took off into some sweet country, ragtime that featured his two fine fiddlers. The rest of the evening was given over to a blend of straight urban blues, a Ia B.B. King, solo bluegrass picking (at which he's superb), some Van Morrison-style boogie, and a few ragtime numbers straight from New Orleans. The guy's a musical melting pot, but he puts the THE FILM COMMITTEE PRESENTS FEB. 8-9-10 THE LAST OF SHEILA FEBRUARY tl ALICE'S RESTAURANT 8 & 10, SS016, 40 cents G~and Canyon. He finished up Wlth a roHicking version of Kansas City, from his latest album and ·Long Afternoons, a mellow Paul Seibel tune. Bromberg is a confident performer and can charm an audience with his humor and modesty. Remember, this guy 1 s is one of the best guitarists in the business, but he tries to keep as laid back as possible. At one point he announced his new contract with Columbia· \I send - ' . them $14.95 and they send me 9 albums.\ A hazy sound system, some confusing switches in style, and a free-wheeling attitade prevented the show from being .as exciting as it .should have been. In the recording studio, David Bromberg is a real gem; in concert he's still a diamond in the rough. audience through too many changes. The act is ragged around t~e edges to begin with. Bromberg hkes the loose approach, which he must have gotten in part from Jerry Jeff Walker, whom he backed up for years. (Now therels somebody Union should get.) He is famous for ·picking up musicians on the spot just to keep things fluid. 1 walked in Saturday night and saw some kid from my hometown up there playing fiddle. There is little. organization on the stage, Bromberg reeled around in front of his dobro, acc.ustic and electric, mandolin, and fiddle at one point and couldn't figure out what to play. D11ring one tune, his reed man walked across the stage to talk things over with the fiddler to see who was going to come in where. Other musicians dig this kind of thing; the audience got lost in the shuffle. It did fall together OK several times, though. On The Joke's on Me, his newest tune, he delivered a sensitive ballad which he sang very smoothly. h was another highlight. Paul Seibel's NashviUe Again was pretty hot and some of the brassy numbers were simply smoldering. There's no question that his supporting men play with as much bravura as he does. His reed and brass men made some tunes sound like Coltrane and Miles Davis, . all hopped up, sitting in with the Tower of Power. On tile country side of the stage, the two fiddlers each doubled on mandolin, which left a lot of room to maneuver. A few times, Bromberg played mandolin with both of them and it sounded like Chris Hillman playing in the Concert Receives Raves by MARC s~ JAFFE- I Trechtenberg, who played guitar There was al\ incredible and sang the lead vocals; Susie amount of talent on display this Monick~ the;: amazing 22 year old past Saturday night in Memorial banjo wizard; -Na,ncy Josephson Chapel.

The two most impressive membe~s of the band were Billy Novik on flute, sax. clarinet, and piano; and Nell Rossi on the fiddle and mandolin. Basically, there were two weak points to Bromberg's performance. The first wa~. the lousy s<iund system, Which made it next to impossible to hear the fiddles. The blame for this poor sound set-up lies entirely 'Yith Bromberg and his crew; who 'Serving Union ForTbree Generations' • IM J•1 St. • for fldfll.~l 'St:r\ 1« .-\nd (,;.led .I&'Wfi~· 'IIER$HIL insisted that this particular sound cnew be written into the contract.

The crowd, still psyched up from the fast- moving numbers of the Buffalo Gals, was in no mood for the slower numbers that Bromberg tried to pull off. One of these songs was, in fact, exceptional. It was a sad song about a lost love, written by Bromberg, entitled \The Joke's On Me\. The most successful songs, though, were the fast instrumentals and the-old Bromberg standards. Songs like \The Holdup\ which Bromberg co-authored with George Harrison; \Sharon\, with its incredible sax solo; and Herman's Hermits· \W bat a Wonderful World it Would Be\ went over especialiy well Helping out on many of these songs were two of the Buffalo Gals, Martha a~ Nancy, who sang backup vocals. For his second encore, Bromberg played \Kansa~ City\ with its beautiful horn arrangement, and for his third and final encore David played his famou~ rendition of \Statesboro Blues~. Happily, the crowd got quite a show for their money. The Social · Committee, not to mention Bromberg and the Buffalo Gals, deserve to be commended for putting on such a fine performance. It is all too easy to ignore the Social Committee, and take them for gra ntcd, but behind the Committee stand a number of very hard working people who truly deserve thanks and appreciation.

The other cut where George spares us f r o m poor lyrics is \Hati's on Tour (Express) .. , a tedious instrumental. by HOWARI) SOWALSKY and ARNOLD HILLER Linda Ronstadt put on a superior performance in Albany last Thursday night at the Palace. These eyes have not seen as strong a control over an audience as Ms. Ronstadt displayed over the scant I JO present. Her voice was consistently fluid, full, and loud, hypnotizing those watching on her baUads, and creating a unified rhythm throughout the crowd on. her country and rock numbers. Ronstadt performed a dozen or' so tunes, mixing her old favorites with many of the cuts on her new \Heart Like a Wheel\ aibum. From this LP she performed her hit single .. You•re· No Good\ (though not without a minor 'interruption due to bad timing by her pianist as well as herself), and other excellent cuts such as \Faithless Love,'' \When Will l Be Loved,\ \W illin,\ \I Can't Help It if I'm Still in Love With You,'' and \Keep Me From Blowing Away.\ The audience enlbusiastically responded to these as well as some of her past best, \Desperado ••Long, Long Time.:· \Love Has N~ Pride,\ and All in all, ··nark Horse\ fails on three levels: musically, lyrically, and personally. Neither George's philosophies nor his musical ideas are communicated convincingly. Although vapid efforts like \Dark Horse\ bode ill f«;>r the future, we still can hope that George Harrison's talents are more substantial than it now appears. \Dark Horse\ brings out the musical nostalgia in us - we wind up wondering what happened to the good ole days When Beatles were on unattainable summits oJ \Silver Threads and Golden creativity. Isn't it a pity? Needles.\ Whether it was her old numbers or her new arrangements, Ms. Ronstadt had the audience asking for more and more. However, .her overworked act showed the effects of a btisy cross-country tour, when to the crowd's disappointment, she appeared for onJy one encore. ---\*'-'Edward fox Returns s·aturday •. Without regard for this strenuous schedule, nor the speculation of her being ill, those nwnbers that she did perform so excellently created an atmosphere of profound respect for the performer. Tbe listeners remained as awed through rhythmic rock as tb,rough her slow ballads, which paralyzed a silent audience. No matter how many times she changed her beat, her band responded well with fine harmony and satisfying instrumentals. What was truly incredible about Ms. Ronstadt was that through all her various ,styled songs (from ••Heat Wave\ to \'H.eart Like a Wheel\) her voice remained predictably smooth, consistently pure, and always loud. In a time of music when AM stars are considered performers for just the teeny-boppers, Linda Ronstadt showed how these two college students (as well as hundreds of others) could come out of a concert with a highly favorable impression of a woman whose .fame bas risen through a recent hit single on the charts, but who yet gave a performance of high quality. It was Ronstadt, an unpretentious performer with a stirring voice, who with her varied material (piayed by Sea Train, Eagles, Hank Williams, Paul Anka, and Phil Everly), meshed many of her possessed talents to create an extremely pleasant evening.

Ronstadt performed a dozen or so tunes, mixing her old favorites with many of the cuts on her new \Heart Like a Wheel\ album. From this LP she performed her hit single .. You're No Good\ (though not without a minor ·interruption due to bad timing by her pianist as well as herself), and other excellent cuts such as \Faithless Love,\ ''When Will I Be Loved,\ \Willin \I Can't Help It if I'm Still in Love With You,\ and \Keep Me From Blowing Away.\ The audience enlhusiastically responded to these as well as some of her past best, \Desperado \Long Long Time,:· \Love Has No Pride,\ and All in all, ••oark Horse\ fails on three levels: musically, lyrically, and personally. Neither George's philosophies nor his musical ideas are communicated convincingly. Although vapid efforts like ••Dark Horse\ bode ill for the future, we still can hope that George Harrison's talents are more substantial than it now appears ... Dark Horse\ brings out the musical nostalgia in us - we wind up wondering what happened to the good ole days when Beatles were unattainable summits creativity. Isn't it a pity? ~~ \Silver Threads and Golden Needles.\ Whether it was her old numbers or her new arrangements, Ms. Ronstadt had the audience asking for more and more. However, her overworked act showed the effects of a busy cross-country tour, when to the crowd's disappointment, she appeared for only one encore. -.-nn__, Edward Fox Returns Saturday I Without regard for this strenuous schedule, nor the speculation of her being ill, those numbers that she did perform so excellently created an atmosphere of profound respect for the performer. The listeners remained as awed through rhythmic rock as through her slow ballads, which paralyzed a silent audience. No matter how many times she changed her beat, her band responded well with fine harmony and satisfying instrumentals. What was truly incredible about Ms. Ronstadt was that through all her various styled songs (from \Heat Wave\ to \Heart Like a Wheel\) her voice remained predictably smooth, consistently pure, and always loud. In a time of music when AM stars are considered performers for just the teeny-boppers, Linda Ronstadt showed how these two college students (as well as hundreds of others) could come out of a concert with a highly favorable impression of a woman whose .fame has risen through a recent hit single on the charts, but who yet gave a performance of high quality. It was Ronstadt. an unpretentious performer with a stirring voice, who with her varied material (piayed by Sea Train, Eagles, Hank Williams, Paul Anka, and Phil Everly), meshed many of her possessed talents to create an extremely pleasant evening . 1' .. /':. ~ Tlus Saturday evening, Feb.

The score ~tood at l-0 till 13:38 of the first period when . Martini scored his first of four on an assist by left-winger Peter Craig who assisted on three of four Martini goals. The first period ended with Union on top 2-0. Utica got two penalties but the Garnet could not capitalize on the opportunities. Al Ritchie, starting left defense, opened the second session with a pretty rink-long rush and scored his second goal of the year at 2:43. At this point, tempers began to flare as some hard hitting thundered off the boards, a resuit of Sanderson's inadvertant slash of a Utica player above his left eye. This, coupled with the partison Utica crowd, made the rink resemble an Ancient Roman arena. Utica finally got on the scoreboard at 3:01 on a deflected pass that caromed off one of our -defensemen and eluded netminder Don Ward to bring Utica a bit closer at 3-1. However, Martini began his streak of three straight power play goals which sunk Utica; the first occuring at 5:08 of the second period when Martini connected on a rebound from Ritchie's low boomer from JUst inside the blue line. Martini's second power play goal at 17:55 was the typicarstereotyiJethat has exemplified the- second line's performance this year: Bob Smolka bounced the puck off the boards to Pete Craig in the corner Martini opened the third session scorins his third power play goal receiving Craig's pass at the blue 'line and converting at 7:31. Defensernan Glidden took the puck from behind our net and made a picture-perfect rink rush netting the puck at 9:26. Marty Cohn scored on a beautiful low slapper from the blue line after receiving a pass from Dave Hannegan at 12:55. Geof Blum took over the netminding activities from Don Ward as the G,arnet held a comfortable 8-1 lead in the middle ()f the third period. Utica got their last score at 14:14 when they stole a pass in front of o~ net and converted on a low shot to the left side of the cage. The third line finally got on the scoreboard when left-winser George Garivaltis took a pass from Mark Ginoet, carried the puck down the ice ummolested and netted the disk at 19:59, making the final score 9-2. Shots on g~al were in Union's favor: 37-10 and Utica owned penalty honors at 11-7. Our next game is against Williams on Wednesday, Feb. 5 at Frear Park in Troy at 5 PM.

Who is William Shakespeare? spectacular was the l-2 sweep in the 50 yard free by freslunan Ray Stecker and co-captain Bill West. Yet ·the others cannot go unmentioned. Tom Richardson took a first in the 2000 I.M. and a second in the 200 backstroke. Freshman Nick Gassaway had two bt - the 200 yard fly and the 500 free. Jim Lowe took lst in the 200 yard breaststroke and junior Eva Schmeckenbecker captured a lst and Jrd in the diving. As for the Hobart meet, the situation was one in which Union was both outmanned anp outlucked. There were five extremely close races and although the Union swimmers. cut seconds of their own times, luck was against them as they were inevitably edged out by .I seconds. After losing the opening medley relay by .I. freshman Nick Gassaway came back strong in the second event, setting a new Union record for the 1000 free at II :30.9. This fine performance was followed once again by two close races. Tom Broderick took a second in the 200 free, .2 seconds off the winning time, as Keith Jacobsen finished fourth with ,his personal best time ever. In the 50 free, the decision was even closer as Ray Stecker was awarded 3rd, edged out by .05 seconds! In the 200 yard I. M., Richardson took lst quite convincingly while freshman Jim Lowe turn-ed in a fine performance capturing 3rd. Divi.ng for Union, Eva Scluneckenbecker won 2nd in both events with Ray Stecker capturing a 3rd and a 4th. In the 200 fty. Ntck Gassaway had an<>ther winning performance ~ Gary Price finished· fourth. Co- captain Bill West and sophomore Keith Jac~bsen managed to capture 2nd and 4th respectively in the 50 free. Then Tom Richardson took over as he tied th() college record for the 200 back with Rob Magaziner finishing 3rd. The last truely close race of the day was the 500 free. Swimming for Union were freshmen Tom Broderick and Gary Price who finished 2nd and 4th respectively after being edged out by less than .15 seconds. Tw() other freshmen, Jim Lowe and Joe Zaengle captured 1st and 3.td in the 200 yard breaststroke. In the final 400 yard free relay, Union had no problem capturing first.

A N .E.S.C.A.C. affiliated coach cannot seek out a prospect either at his horne or at an athletic contest. He can go and observe the athlete but cannot say as much as \boo'~ to him. The only contact allowed with the prospective scholar-athlete is by mail, telephone, at an alumni sponsored get- together or when and if possible, the candidate visits Union. But the great maj9rity of recruitment is done strictly by mail. No reimbursement for traveling expenses or an overnight stay is permitted. The only financial remuneration allowed is for meals. If an athlete can visit this school he must pay his own way, sleep on a floor in South, eat meals at West and find. his way home again. This is not an attempt to belittle the recrmtmg restrictions. We are only trying to point out one fact, the process of recruitment for Union College tends to burst \All-American\ dreams and ·send top prospects packing on the next train out of town (if they can afford it). So. Coaches Cahill, Harkness, Scanlon et. al., you are now looking for a poverty stricken athletic genius with dreams of co.Jlegiat.e athletic mediocrity .. A person who longs not only for the quaintness of Schenectady and the cozy atmosphere of West College but frigid winters and mud-filled springs. Cancel those reservations sports fans, but not your season tickets please. Last year Union athletic teams still compiled a .608 winning percentage against the likes of Springfield, Syracuse, Colgate and Hartwick. Of the twelve varsity sports, 8 had · winning slates. Outstanding records were rolled up by basketball (20-4), lacrosse (ll-3) and tennis (18- 1 ). We've been doing pretty well~ better than pretty well. And we are going to do even better still. Stick around and see. Wome:n Vic·tors by BARB DEWEY Cathy Reals, a freshman out of Colonie, led the Union offense with 22 points in a victory over Schenectady County Community College last Friday afternoon in Memorial Fieldhouse. The ''Dutchwomen\ out-rebounded and out-hustled the local team to a final: score of 4$-32. SCCC scored the .first bucket of the game, but held their . last advantage at 6-3 iq., the opening minutes. A tough defelise forced several turnovers in Union's favor, and Gloria Jones hit for four quick points to give the home t!'!am the lead. Reals scored six basket's in the first half and Louise Dunn converted one of two free throws-for Union. Two impressive fast-break lay-ups by Lia Pendergast of SCCC in the final two minutes of the first half brought the score to l7- B at the halftime break. Union, more composed' in the second half, increased their lead ' through a c;Qmbin..~tion of steals, blocked shots, good reboundin,g and an improved shooting percentage.

Fieldhouse Romp It is amazing and quite consistent with the Black student history here at Union, that an episode sBch as the one last Saturday, February I, could occur. Not only was there a gang war between Blacks and whites in the fieldhouse, with knives and whatever, but a riot was about to unfold. These, like other false and malicious rumors being bred down-campus, must cease. So, right now, let's set the record straight. The reason for the spreading out-break of •violence,' was due to the arrogant attitude held by some whites (particularly when ill a crowd). The spark that started the whole affair, seemed to come from the arrogant, self-righteous- ness being fostered by whites when in contact with a Black person. That attitude was quite evident this Saturday when they tried to rationalize the wild, abrasive action on the basketball court. It was quite evident when, 6 to 8 whites tried to confront one black, after the Black ballplayer had been slapped in the face and his specs smashed. The typical response by the whites was, ..... so what, it happens all the time,\ not considering the damage that was done, nor what the damage would cost. It was quite evident, that the white people in the fieldhouse held preconceived attitudes and notions towards Blacks, when a 'custodian' took it upon himself to settle matters, only to strike at a bystanding black student. In response to which, his own co- Dean Smith: That's brand new worker had a severe seizure, to me. As far as I know he is one trying to restrain the two. All this of the most respected people on happened, and nobody of any Hierarchy has come to hear the truth, from the Black side. The only news being spread arouad caoopus seems to be coming from 'a-reliable-unreliable-source,' down-campus. Union is beginning to stink with all this 'self- righteousness and pseudo- liberalism. I, for one, don't know what will come about here at Union in the future. But if the present attitudes being held by whites prevail, then they can ~ely on the Black 'population to react accordingly. Sportin' Neglect A lot of whites on this campus wonder why the Blacks at Union are allowed to have their own little newspaper. Well, here's one good reason, neglect. To be a little more specific, neglect by the reporters of the Concordy staff. And to be even more specific, neglect by the sports writers of Concordy. Now close your mouths while I cite a few examples. Let's examine the case of Ronald Xavier Westbrook. In the beginning of the fall term, during football season, Ron became the career rushing leader at Union College. And in a later game, he scored three touchdowns in one game. Now when was the last time that a Union football player did this, especially with an offensive line that couldn't stop the seven dwarfs. Here was an exceptiot1al player who excelled despite the lackluster performanc.e of some of his teammates. (and If you weren't one of those players, shut up) Was there anything said about it? Sure, one line. But if Ron was blond, blue-eyed, and .. white, the cavalcades of praise wouldD't have ceased. Well, Ron, if they don't appreciate your athletic talents, I sure do. Another incident was that of Stanley O'Brian. Now Stanley was a member of the Lacrosse team. I don't know that much about the game, but I do know when all individual scores, and in one particular game, Stapley scored a number of times. ln fact, he helped lead the team to victory. In the next issue of Concordy, there was a writeup about the game, but what they. said a bout Stanley was so smaJ!l, you had to read it with a magnifying glass. There have been other incidents along these Iines, with the most recent involving Wayne Heywood and Eddie Adams, both members of the track team. Wayne ran in the 50 yard dash competitively the first time in his life at Union about a week and a half ago. He was only edged out by a tenth of a second, but was this mentioned? Not only didn't they mention that he came in second, they did not even mention his name, [n fact, they mentioned the winner and the person that came in fow-th. Now if I remember my numbers correctly, two follows one, not four. Why was Wayne's name left out? . Eddie's victory on January 25 was mentioned, but it was played down because Dave Ricks was injured. The reporter might as well have written Ricks' biography. Eddie nearly broke a school record, doesn't that mean anything around here'? Of course it doesn't mean anything if you are Black and a member of the B.S.A. at Union. It's not that Black athletes are \glory-seekers but a little recognition would not hurt every now and then. - Marilyn Becton merely an expert on Blacks at Union. It is the feeling of some members of the BSA that J. King and Carlos Hill are being used in the same manner, i.e., pawns by the administration to spy and dictate to the BSA what we can and cannot do. When asked what his intentions were for their positions, Dean Smith replied that they were just supposed to be the directors of AOC and nothing more. Their relation to the BSA is only that of holding funds in order that the college would not be in violation of N.Y. Regents Law which stipulates that no organization which is exclusively or predominantly a minority the staff. importance in the Union Penp: VVhat about Tony ~~~~~ .. ~~~~ .. ~;;;. ................................ aa .................. ~ Sharpe? group will receive funding because that action would perpetuate segregation. In order to sidestep this law the BSA budget is allocated to an administrator instead of directly to the BSA. The Dean pointed out that other schools like Vassar had lost all funding for their BSA 's and \We knew they were coming and simply had to prepare for looking as good as possible.\ When I brought up the hassles from Jay and Carlos that the BSA have to go through everytime we want to draw funds from the budget Dean Smith said, \If there are problems with the allocation of that money, this is the first I've heard of it.\ Perspective: You haven't heard anything about conflicts between the Assistant Deans and the BSA? Dean Smith: No. Persp: You haven't heard anything? Dean Smith: Nothing. Persp: Nada'? Dean Smith: From them or from Black students. Nothing. Persp: Hmmm. . . Well, you may not want to answer this but, do Jay and Carlos report to you about what Black students do on this campus,. . . what they're doing now, etc.? D. Smith: No. Not at all. Nobody in any programs of mine report to me about anything. Rumor Number four: Persp: I keep hearing rumors that so and so is next to be edged out of Union, like, Tony Sharpe is going ... Dean Smith: He's going. That's not a rumor. Dean Smith: Tony's leaving because he simply showed no real ability to work with the procedures of the college or to relate effectively within the administrative structures that he has to relate effectively with to integrate the Upward Bound Program with the rest of the college. Penp: Break it down a little. Dean Smith: It's simple, firstly, he found it very difficult to follow any of our financial regulations concerning accounting for funds, there is no implication that there is any dishonesty, it's just that he did not seem to have much interest in following the procedures of staying within the budget and keeping us from having to bail him out at the end of the year. Which we did. That's one thing that he did, second, he went ahead and hired an assistant without really checking witq any administrator in this whole college including Donnell and me and Jay and Carlos, all of whom would be interested in helping to select that person. He went ahead and did that selection and announced it without involving any other member of the college administration. Penp: I was under the assumption that that was the way it had been done in the past. Dean Smith: He was wrong, and he knew it. That's the straw that broke the camel's back. It has nothing to do with \partying\ or anything like that. As a matter of fact, Tony has felt absolutely free to come over and \party\ anytime he pleased, especially at times when it was a little late for some of the rest of us, like two a.m. Persp: That's about it? Dean Smith: There's one final thing I can tell you about Tony and that is that the Sight Visitor for the Upward Bound Program who came in to evaluate the program, reccommended to us that we change the top leadership or we would lose the program. He thought it was the poorest administration of any Upward Bound Program he'd ever seen, especially financially, and if you 'want to talk about misunderstandings and communication problems within the program, talk to Donnell, because he was in the program this summer. Talk to Carlos. There have been a series of misunderstandings not only externally, but within this staff with the faculty and counselors of the program, all adding up to the fact that Tony's always right and they were wrong. That just isn't the way we run this place. Note: Sight Visitors visit for a day and a half. Dean Smith went on to say .. In the case of Anthony, it is not our choice, in that he works for the federal government. The telling blow was not that students weren't happy with him, but he violated the minimum . requirements for administrative effectiveness of the college. It doesn't matter what students think of an administrator, if he can't measure up, especially in terms of fiscal responsibilities, we can't afford to keep him. Rumor Number 5: Persp: How do you think you are perceived by the majority of Blacks on the Union College campus? Dean Smith: I haven't the slightest idea, and I really don't spend much time guessing about that. Persp: You speak about how you want to improve relationships between whites and Blacks, but don't you think it is important for you to have equally good relationships with Blacks and the BSA? Dean Smith: Definitely. Persp: Then why isn't it that way? Dean Smith: I don't know. I didn't know it wasn't, to tell you the truth. But I will remind you that I simply do not spend my time worrying about what relationships are. Persp: But that seems like a contradiction, in that you seem to worry about the waythe college should be relating, but not necessarily you personally. Dean Smith: It's damned important, but there is a great difference in worrying about it and being concerned about it. In the first place, I'm not one to go down to build relationships that are unnaturai and I think that would be just as misunderstood as anything else. But in general I tend to defend relationships that are nat ural. Persp: Why do you say \unnatural~ relations hips'! Dean Smith: The relationships that don't grow out of the kinds of contacts you have in the process of aU of us simply doing our business in the college. Persp: That's anotht:r contradiction in that you say you want Blacks and whites to get together. We see whites everyday and they see us everyday and if relationships aren't growing naturally out of that, they will never grow out naturally; Right? Dean Smith: Well I see Black students everyday, yc>U can be sure of that. Persp: What I'm saying is nothing has naturally grown out of that. Dean Smith: Well, I think it has. Persp: What'? Dean Smith: Well I think there are a series of relationships and if BSA is bad, that tells me something I didn't know. Persp: I'm not speaking for the BSA, I'm just saying that this is my opinion. Rumor Number 6: When asked about the incident at the fieldhouse, Dean Smith replied that Kleinkauf reported there was a fracas in the field house involving '<the BSA and several independent white basketball players\. When further questioned Dean Smith said of course he was accustomed to people when referring to individual actions of Blacks to use the name of the BSA. When asked whether any actions would be taken against the people involved he said it was \a ·dead issue\ unless somebody wanted to file a complaint.

Beginning in the next ·issue of ''Perspective,\ a . ~eries of articles will be presented relating to Mto- Americit:n history. Why? W eli, in these days of national attention to ''race relations,\ no -one needs te be told that one American in eight is Black. Growing numbers of people are aware that Afro- . ;. Americans have pl~yed a dynamic t.:f role in the liistorY\ or the u ruted States, and that over the centuries they have .made significant and distinctive contributions to the building of this country. American school children, however, are. nirely exposed to . t:his S,tory. They continUe·to study ·an \'American History'• which · makes the nationit:l past virtually a white domain. Most elementary and secondary school texts contain no reference. to .. .alack Americans between th,e Emanci- ation Proclamation and the Supreme Court ·desegregation decision of 1954 1 WheQ American history does fleetingly acknowledge the Negro's existence, it tends to cast him itt a passive role: the Black man Was enslaved, then he was freed by Lincoln, finally he was liberated from Jim Crow by the action of a white court. ~ - By leaving out the active and sometimes crucial role played by the Black minority, American history does itself a serimo~s injlistice. The student; Black or white, suffers: he is denied the true story of his country's past, and he does not learn the history w:hich could help him understand t,he present. Most Americans are not-African in ancestry, hut we all share ;. cultural heritage with .art Afdcan and Afro-American component. We live in a nation which Black labor helped develop and make strong; much of this effort went unpaid and unpraised at the time, but at the very least it deserves our belated recognition. If a major function ofhistory is to enable us. to cope with tlw present in an intelligent and responsible manner, then an all- white history of the UtthedStates is grievously unsatisfactory. For all these reasons, history comses which pay less att~ntion to the Afro-American than to the tariff are as inadequate and as misleading for the white child as for the Black. The Afro-American story is not - --the only chapter which has been left out of American history or ser·iously mistold. ()u.r schoolbooks need to be rewritten to include .a new understanding of the American Indian, the Chinese, and tl1P Puetto Rican c o n tr i b u.t i on ., a s w e I I. Nonetheless, America's largest minority has .been the most ignored, and the exclusion of the Black man from history has left the most gaping bole. The las( few years have seen a dramatic increase in awareness of Black history. Newspaper articles, televi$ion shows, special courses .or prograins, and a· flood of new.· public~fions. all testify to the growing popularity of this subject. The new c\C>ncern is to be welcomed, but in a few cases it seems to exhibit some unfortunate characteristics. One of these has been the te.nd'ency to portray · aH Afro-Americans as 'gre~t · and heroic in the face of incredible odds. While this type of \history\ may be an understandable reaction, it is no more true of the Black record than it is of the whit e. Black history has its share of heroes and martyrs, but it also has. its share of mediocre men and traitors. It is important that the Afro• American story be told, but surely it is equally important that it be told honestly. A second way of misl'¢pres¢ntifig the Afro- American pl\st is at least as distressing as the tendency to overglorify it. lt is sometimes asserted that the Black man patiently accepted .ftrst slavery then second-class citizenship, that he willingly sla:ved for the white master, and that he now deserves to be \given'' equal rights . in return for 400 years of unresisting servitude, this picture of quiet patience in the face of oppression bears, a strong resemblance to historical reality. It furtherm'ore is a bizarre kind of \tribute' 1 to the Afro-American people, who hav~ fought for their freedom as vigor.ously ·as white men. American school children learn that their forefathers bravely fought the tyranny of \taxation wit bout representation.\ Why then should they be falsely taught that Black Americans cravenly accepted the greater t-yranny of slavery? · In conclusion, it is unavoidable that in a brief historical survey many important things must receive less attention than they warrant or be omitted altogether. ln this series, two factors besides objective historical importance. have influenced the difficult., Continued on Page D ••••••••••••• Keep on SPORTS Tracking! ···~·········· If you ask me .anything about football, baseball, basketball, tennis, hockey, or golf, I can rattle off any minute detail.

In order for the production to be like that on Broadway, Greg stresses the importance to the cast of being really able to relate to each other. He has understudies for some parts and he and his stage manager, Bill Brown, are reaHy looking forward to a professional type production. There will be an eight piece band: drums, two saxophones, trumpet, Bass, lead and Greg on piano.

The .point made by one of Schaffer'$ librarians in charge of periodicals, was that the periodicals ~re expensive to replace and that oft times the articles torn out are the most wanted and the most interesting.

Girling, an alumnus of Union College from the class of 1918 was approached for the financing of the facility. The closest parcel -of land that was al.so large enough lor tbe college's needs was a few miles up Van Vranken Avenue. The 50 acre lot includes a meeting hall, a house, a swimming pool, an ice rink (not large enough to be used for hockey), picnic facilities, swings, and plenty of woods. The land :was -bought in 1971 at a cost of approximately $230,000 of which $200,000 was given by the estate of Wallace S. Girling (who had recently passed away).

Production of New Ploys The Athletic Department Continued on Pa~:e 8 The Union Cdllege Arts Department has embarked on an imaginative. new program. It is called the New PlaYWrights Program, a program that is seeking original scriflts for their production at the college. The program will se~ its :first production this spring. The purpose of the program is the solicitation of original scripts from American playwrights for their develqpment andproduction at the college. Ads have appeared for the past month in \Showbusiness\ magazine as well as irt this. past ,week's edition of the Village Voice. the college has also been in contact with theater guilds such as. the New Dramatist, Dramatist Guild, and the Public Theater. The Arts Department is also seeking guest directors to direct these scripts. The program is under the auspices of Professor Barry Smith Glee Club of the Arts Department.

As the date for the final vote on the twelve point grading proposal draws near, the editors of Concordiensis- wish to express their opposition to the measure. Furthermore, we believe the students have shown themselves capable of presenting reasoned arguments against the proposal, and hope that administrators and faculty members alike will take into consideration the views of students. It has not been the tradition of this institution to deny consideration to overwhelming student sentiment on issues of such magnitude. It is our hope that their position will be equitably represented by the student Senate members and that the faculty and administration will not deem our faith in the credibility of student judgement unfounded. The urge to destroy existing structures should be curbed unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the present system is in a state of decay. We would like to express thanks to the student members of the Senate and Steering Committee for the time and effort they have devoted not only to tabulating votes but also to explaining the proposal and its alternatives to the student body. We feel that, in light of the overwhelming student opposition to the proposal (evidenced by the recent survey conducted by the student government), that they have acted admirably in supportmg that position regardless oftheir own preferences. We encourage all students to attend the Ali- College Senate meeting to be held on Thursday. Feb. 13 at 4:00 p.m. in the psychology conference room.

Carman Editor pat Etl.itors, Concordiensis: This letter is for the purpose of making known my unconditional support of the possible reversal of the recent decision on Pat Allen's teaurability. Union College has already decided to dismiss one ·of the most talented members of its English Dept.'s faculty, and the possibility .of them compounding the mistake With a similar action on Pat is most distressing. Pat's abilities and strengths as a professor and as an individual have already been attested to in these pages. He is a man of unusual . dedication to his students, · and. this quality i.n a per$on of Pat's intelligence and education makes for ,the most valuable kj,nd of teacher a school like Union can have. I have had three courses with Pat, most recently the American Literature preceptorial and I can say without any hesitation that he has been one of the most helpful and instructing people I've known. 1 owe in great part to him my decision to become in my third ye.ar here an English major. What distresses me most about Pat's situation is the very strong feeling I have that he had no realistic chance of being approved' from the very beginning - that his Ad Hoc Committee was prejudiced against him from the Union Co'llege seems to be very concerned these days with its image; it seems to be trying to make up for the fact that it is not quite Ivy League.· The recent hiring of nationally prominent sports coaches alon.g with the increased emphasis on athletics here that they represent, when coupled with the dismissal of one of Union's finest faculty members for the relatively trivial reasons that. Pat has been given of being we-ak rn the publis.hing department, tenc:l to give the impression of a concern for public ill).ages which greatly outdistances the concern for the quality of education here at Union. Union lias already lost the services of one very fine professor, I hope that this mistake is not infinitely compounded by the dismissal of still another one. Sincerely, Steven H.

While Pat has been my adviser for nearly three years I won't say mote than that for intelligent, witty and friendly convers<~.tion and advice I have met few professors who can claim to be in the same ballpark with Pat; I am beginning to get the impression that such abilities are considered detrimental to one's overall value as a professor.

Yes, I was there. But if you ask me what happened, l can only tell you a very small portion of t'he truth. . . part of which is due to the fact that I was playing very sloppy defense that day ... ••.••• y •.• + y. HILLEL TO HOLD SHABBAT DINNER Page 3 There has been much talk about an incident which took place in the Field House on Saturday, feb~ L My name is Tom Thompson. I have heard and read many opinions of what happened, most of which came from people who weren't there. For instance, 1 heard from one gentleman, whose name was John Doe, that . . . ''der was some black guys down der who started a fight with Tommie. One of •em even had a knife. He was really nuts. He even picked up a chair and was .gonna throw it at Tommie but Tommie was kool. He wouldn't fight him. But da black guy just kept comin' and Tommie· had ta fight him.· Tommie even said dat he'd pay for da black guy's glasses. It was an accident. Da black guy slugged Tommie irt da face before Tommie even knew dat · he'd broke da guy's glasses. Oo. .

The Box Office opens on Friday, February 14; and will be open every weekday thereafter between the hours of one-thirty and five P.M. (Due to the design of the set, seating capacity is limited, so it is recommended that tickets be reserved in. adyance.) AS YOU LIKE IT is a story of love and of the 'simple life.' Shakespeare laughs at conventional illusions of love, provides opposing views, but in the end leaves them alone. The themes of love are ageless: thus Shakespeare's comment on them is,. too. Helena Binder and Judy Stollmack as Celia listen as Barry Smith illustrates a point. lJy DAVID MOSKOWITZ Never the ones to understate things, the Yes group makes it .quite obvious in their latest release, Rdayer, how little concern they have for their own listeners. Relayer, a continuation of the worst aspects of last year·~ erratic Tales of Topographic Oceans, manages to be nothing more than an annoying exercise in. audience desertion. Most of the action of the play takes place in the idyllic Forest of Arden. The Forest has strange effects on the different people who enter it. It is the woods in the spring. Fresh air, verdant growth, happiness abound. The dialogue moves with a freshness and a freedom which must be spring. This is a good play lor us as we begin to look towards spring. Winter is half-done and as we watch the play we can think of ourselves in love in Jackson's harvard- radeliffe Gardens, .soon. Under the direction of Prof. Barry Smith, this producti0n of AS YOU LIKE IT is attempting to achieve a semi~stylized interpretation, but at the same time play off the freshness inherent in the play. The actors are building their own Elizabethan style costumes, based on designs by Dianne Smith. A consort of Union musicians, among them Prof. Curtis, are producing what may be the best music based on Shakespeare since Verdi's Othello. Prof. Charles Steckler's set is a variation on the standard Shakespearian set, with a.dded touches· such as a thrust stage, long ramps, and a canvas and metal framework in the background. It wasn't too long ag.o that Yes was at the foref11ont of modern pl'ogressive rock. Their music was the synthesis of the considerable musical skills of Rick Wakeman, Steve Howe, and Chris Squire and the fertile mind and vocal talents of Jon Anderson. Always serio~. Yes' music was exciting and managed to probe new areas of instrumentation and eflects. Anderson's enigmatic lyrics added a touch of sophistication, being a spiritual expression of lofty, although smtewhat obscure, ideals. Together, these factors produced a distinctive Yes 'sound' and pieces like the breathtakingly successful Close to the Edge. Melodies were exciting and the mood created managed to totally envelopeand entrance the listener. More recent Yesj Wotksndicate that Anderson bas become the more-than-dominant force in Yes. His interest in the Shastric writings of the East has been transferred to the group's lyrics and even its musical style.

By ARNIE HILLER andHOWARD SOWALSKY Last Friday evening the Albany State Ballroom featured the sounds of the Billy Cobham Band. The band as it now exists is a delightful and exciting blend of Cobham's drumming extraordinaire, along with the very capable musicians who have backed him up on his three recent albums. Since departing from the Mahvishnu Orchestra a few years ago, Cobham has increased his affiliation with a style of music, which we shall call electrified jazz. Along with a brass section featuring the Brecker brothers, the band is motivated by the constant interplay between the members which was so much a part of the . Mahavishnu Orchestra. f\he same enthusiasm, minus the conflict of personalities ENGINEERS ts quite apparent in this band. Friday's . concert although comparatively short was indeed an excellent indication of the quality of music which can be produced from such talented musrcmns. From the band's opening renditions of \Pleasant Pheasant\ and \Red Robin,\ material from previous albums, continuing through the side of Cobham's new album, featuring \T 0tal Eclipse,\ (from the albu!D of the same name) the energy which the band generated was felt by the sellout audience which attended the show.

Despite this, during Yes' recem concert tour, Anderson insisted on the pert'ormanc~ of the entire hour-and-a,half Work, to the boredom of many fans, Even the grol.lp's keyboard-synthesizer wizard Rick Wakeman, a beer drinking slob like you · and me, admitted to not understanding Tales and not understanding why it had to be performed in its entirety. The death throes of this trend are manifest Qn Relayer .• The few brief patches of melody that do exist (the \Soon Oh Soon\ segment on Side One) fail to alleviate the headache that the majority of the album creates. Relayer negl.ectl> to present lyrics that are coherent · to a mass audience. For example: ••choose and renounce throwing .:hains to the floor Kill or be killed faster sins eorrect the. now Casting giant shadows off Vast Penetrating force To alter via. the war that seen As friction spans the spirits wrath ascending (slowly) to redeem\ Sounds interesting, but what does this mean'! Such scrawlings serve only to confuse an already confused audience. Wakeman's replacement, Switzerland's Patrick Moraz, does not exhibit any of the wild keyboard abandon of · his predecessor. Apparently, Anderson will no longer tolerate any strayings from what he considers Yes' intended musical path: another point of conflict between Wakeman and Anderson. Relayer possesses only three cuts - 45's are not Yes' intended market. Perhaps the group would be better off producing songs of a length more easily digestible by fans. Regressive, no longer progressive, Yes fails to understand that they are s tip posed to be entertaining an audience. By creating an a blum of thoroughly annoying music. they have alienated a listenership that at one point anxiously awaited each new album.

Music I heard with you was more than music, And bread I broke with you was more than bread; Now that I am without you, all is desolate~ All that was once so beautiful is dead. Your hands once touched this table and this silver, And I have seen your fingers hold this glass. These things do not remember you. beloved, ' And yet your touch upon them will not pass. For it was in my heart you moved among them, And blessed them with your hands and with your eyes~ And in my heart they will remember always,- They knew you once, 0 beautiful and wise_ Conrad Aiken '

The victories were dampened by the loss of two key starters and Coach Knulrs comforting words that the team is lucky \to have good soun4 wrestlers to step ill and fill the void\ are much too optimistic. Heavyweight Robin Bennett injuried himself early last week and will definitely be out of _., action. ~Robin, a freshman from Kenvil, New Jersey closes his tlrst year of college wrestling with a respectable 4-3-2 record. Co- Captain Tom Everett is also injuried with torn ligaments and whether he will be able to compete in the State Tournament is still in doubt. Tom, currently holding a 7-1-1 record, also injuried himself last year during the semifinals at the State. Tournament. On a good note, Larry Dagostino made a triumphant come back, after having been hospitalized with an ear injury. Larry subdued his opponent from WPI 8-2. Co-Captain Bruce Freeman sweeped, both matches to up his individual record to I J- L Bruce is the only senior on the team and has a good shot at reaping honors at the State. Tournament. Sophomore Mike. Walker captured !'tis first match of the year by burying his opponent from Worcester 16-4. In the 142 lb. division Bill McClintock registered his first victory oft he season by pinning his foe from RPl in 3:58. Freshman Jim Sutton sweeped through both matches registering a pin against WPl and a 5-2 decision against RPI. Area wrestler Chet Karwatowski wrestling behind the shadow of Everett decisioned his counterpart· from RPl 4-2. Chet will replace Everett at the State Tournament if tfie latter·s injmies subsist. Freshman Josh Salzman was handed his third losss of the season by Tim True,. the senior captain of RPI. Greg Lyons captured both of his. matches .by decision. Freshman Jim Neeley, another area wrestler, recalled to fill the void left by heavyweight Bennet split his• two bouts and is now l-1. The Garnets host Colgate University this Wednesday (yesterday) and the two key losses will detinitely afl'ect the outcome of the match. Colgate defeated the Garnets Jl-7 last year and their team this year is just as good. The Union team travels next to Rochester on F11bruary 15, for the New York State Championship. By BRIAN TUCKER The Union hoop team finished set another week of unbroken victories on a road trip which saw the \Garnet\ submarine dock at Tufts of Boston long enough to blow the Jlu:nbos out of their own gym 91-67.

Concordiensis applauds this decision, believing it to be an important one for the future of student morale. Much effort was required to marshall support for the retention of the present grading system, particularly by the members of student government,r the college senators and steering committee members. These people put in many hours in the weeks before the vote, collecting student opinion by surveying all living units on camplJs. Concordiensis wishes to express its gratitude t.o these students for their concerted efforts. Opinion ·.you said it orland:O Editor, Concordien!'iis: My condition doth remain desperate. I hath not yet found the maiden for whom 1 last week declared my love. Mest assured am I, /that once my love is revealed, hers will abound for me ... 0 h, harmonious .love, how ,long willst thou continue to escape me? As measure to endeth this chase, I did this past week send verses of love to· all in the community in the spirit, of St. Valentine. H0ped me to reach her on the day of Love's celebration. But, lo; she doth evade me still, and my hopes doth wane. Sirs, awarest am I that thy positions of importance doth provide :thee with schedules of fullness BUT FOR CHRIST SAKE,. GIMME A BREAK WILL Y A? .... Oh, but pardon my outburst, kind gentlemen. Begin me .already to lose control. My body doth shake with unbalanced passion, whilst my heart prays for your assistance in the discovery of my love. .In this plea remains my hope ·:· Orlando senate Editors, Concordiermis: As you .probably know by now, the grade change proposal was voted on and defeated by the All- College Senate at their meeting last Thursday. We would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank the entire. student body, especially R.A. and fraternity. presidents, for providing val•uable' input and discussion at the floot meetings so that their opinions could be adequately represented. This is the first time in quite a while that the entire student body to9k an active interest in a College Senate matter. It is hoped that cooperation of this nature signifies a new and closer relationship between the student body and their representatives .. The result of the Senate meeting 'conclusively showed that, regardless of the way they vote, faculty memher.s and administrators are receptive and respectful of responsible student opinion. :h should also put to rest the notion that t-here is inherent divisiveness among students, facu'lty and administration, because this is simply not true. It is possible to Work collectively in order to make decisions that wiU · be mutually beneficial for the college. · As input was received from the student body, many students felt that We were already funct·ioning. in a pressure packed environment. and that a 12 point grading system. would only amplify and magnify an already acute problem. We agree on both of these points and feel that students should take this occasion to work along with Dean Smith and other adm.i ni str a tor's and f ac.ulfy mem hers to pursue programs that will !essen this pressure. Once again we make the pledge to work closer with you to make student government at Union rnore effective but we need you to Work along with us. Sincerely, Steering Committee Members Student Members of the All-College Senate tables turned Editors, Concordiensis: We can't believe we're actually writing a letter to the editor for such a purpose. The thought of people sending their personal ·problems to newspaper columns usually makes us sick, but we are on the brink. of insanity. And here is our story ... About three weeks ago we were taking a brisk walk through Jackson's gardens. Suddenly we saw someone skirt between the trees. We only caught a glimpse of him, but he was radiant, the most gorgeous boy we've ever set our eyes upon during our seven years at Uni<?n. Begin we to chase ~ at a sprmt- we raced through the woods up to Lenox Road. We dashed through Edwards and H;ickok house - scampered through Theta Delta Chi, Phi Sigma Kappa, ·Sigma Chi, and Delta Chi. No success in ·our mission of location.

A tour through Psi Upsilon, Chi Psi, Sigma Phi, and Alpha Delta Phi made even more apparent the odds we faced. Walking slowly through Webster, Kappa Alpha; Davidson, Delta Upsilon, Fox, Phi Gamma Delta, South and West burdened further our once-enlightened hearts ..

Small town in mass society . WiJ,liams, Theatre of Tennessee Williams - Although Union has its share of problems, some of them ate more serious than others. It seems to us that the most serious problem· we face is a \morale\ problem; the general atmosphere here seems to include a sense of personal alienation, insecurity, fatalism, and cynicism. In the present atmosphere college administrators, faculty, and students involved in college governance often get defensive. People on each side of a given issue tend to attack the other side in terms of the motives or intentions of their opposition; people tend to get even more defensive and rigid when their personal integrity or motives are being attacked. · The problem we face is how to de v e 1 o p a _soc i a I climate that provides support and reinforcement for people trying to improve Union. We can begin by discussing issues and proposed solutions in terms of their substance, rather than the integrity or intentions of the individuals pr0posing the solutions. The only way to become a community and to work together to improve Union (which includes creative conflict and disagreement) is to supress our sus.picions about people's intentions and assume that most people are well intentioned and interested in making Union a better place to live. (We should realize that we all live here and spend most of our time with each other on campus.) If we assume that people ate honest <\nd community-minded when they raise or try to deal with issues, then w~ can create dialogues to solve problems that focus on the content of the problem, rather than the motivations of the people involved. There are few support systems for people trying to do anything for Union; rather the rewar.ds are to do things for ourselves. Any action or proposal usually receives negative feedback and not constructive modification. Students receive much criticism and few rewards for becoming involved with Union as a community of people living and working together. Faculty are rfi.Warded for teaching and research and therefore \punished\ for coHege service because it eats up valuable time. Administrators who are most active in trying to change Union tend to receive more flack and criticism than those who are less active and merely focus on day to day administrative routines. There is a norm at Union that suggests that the most appropriate behavior is cynicism about change. People here are really alone in a crowd and none of us like to be too visible.

Concordiensis applauds this decision, believing it to be an important one for the future of student morale. Much effort was required to marshall support for the retention of the present grading system, particularly by the members of student government,r the college senators and steering committee members. These people put in many hours in the weeks before the vote, collecting student opinion by surveying all living units on campus. Concordiensis wishes to express its gratitude to these students for their concerted efforts. Opinion you said it orlando Editor, foncordiensis: My condition doth remain desperate. I hath not yet found the maiden for whom I last week declared my love. Most assured am I, that once my love is revealed. hers will abound for me ... Oh, harmonio11s love, how long wiUst thou continue to escape me'? As measwre to endeth this chase, I did this past week send verses of love to all in the community in the spirit of St. Valentine. Hoped me to reach her on the day of Love's celebration. But, lo, she doth evade me still, and my hopes doth wane. Sirs, awarest am I that thy positions of importance doth provide thee with schedules of fwllness BUT FOR CHRIST SAKE, GIMME A BREAK WILL Y A'! ... Oh, but pardon my outburst, kind gentlemen. Begin me already to lose control. My body doth shake with unbalanced passion, whilst my heart prays for your assistance in the discovery of my low. In this plea remains my hope ... Orlando senate Editors, Concordiensis: As you probably know by now, the grade change proposal was voted on and defeated by the All- College Senate at their meeting last Thursday. We would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank the entire student body, especially R.A. and fraternity presidents, for providing valuable· input and discussion at the floor meetings so that their opinions could be adequately represented. This is the first time in quite a while that the entire student body took an active interest in a College Senate matter. It is hoped that cooperation of this nature signifies a new and closer relationship between the student body and their representatives. Ihe result of the Senate meeting 'conclusively showed that, regardless of the way they vote, !acuity members and administrators are receptive and respectful of responsible st1:1dent opinion. It should also phlt to rest the notion that there i!> inherent di visivcness among students, faculty and administration, because this is simply not true. It is possible to work collectively in order to make decisions that will be mutually beneficial for tht:: college. As input was received from the student body, many students felt that we were already functioning in a pressure packed environment. and that a 12 point grading system would only amplify and magnify an already acute problem. We agree on both of these points and feel that students should take this occasion to work along with Dean Smith and other administrators and faculty members to pursue programs that will lessen this pressure. Once again we make the pledge to work closer with you to make student government at Union more effective but we need you to work along with us. Sincerely, Steering Committee Members Student Members of the All-College Senate tables turned Editors, Concordiensis: We can't believe we're actually writing a letter to the editor for such a purpose. The thought of people sending their personal problems to newspaper columns usuaJ,Jy makes us sick, but we are on the brink of insanity. And here is our story ... About three weeks ago we were taking a brisk walk through Jackson's gardens. Suddenly we saw someone skirt between the trees. We only caught a glimpse of him, but he was radiant, the most gorgeous boy we've ever set our eyes upon during our seven years at Uni~n. Begin we to chase - at a ~prmt we raced through the woods up to Lenox Road. We dashed through Edwards and Hickok hot:Isc scampered through Theta Delta Chi, Phi Sigma Kappa, Sigma Chi, and Delta Chi.

Onto the campus grounds with defeat making our panting hearts quite heavy. A tour through Psi Upsilon, Chi Psi, Sigma Phi, and Alpha Delta Phi made even more apparemt the odds we faced. Walking slowly through Webster, Kappa Alpha, Davidson, Delta Upsilon, Fox, Phi Gamma Delta, South aHd West burdened further our once-enlightened hearts.

,. CONCORDIENSIS Wednesday, February 19, 1975 Page3 Egyptian Ambassador Discusses Oil, Israel by DA VIIJ MOSKOWITZ The functions ·of a foreign ambassador and the stated p€llicies of a Mideast nation were on clear display last Thursday night in a s·peech given by, the Egyptian Ambassador to the United States, Ashraf Ghorbal. The Ambassador's speech, sponsored by the International Relations Club E!;nd presented in front of an audience of over 200 in SSCH6, permitted a glimpse of the motivations behind, and the professionalism inherent in, the foreign diplomatic corps. Mr. G horbal was appointed in 1973 as Ambassador to the U.S. after resumption of relations between the U.S. and Egypt. He· had previously served as Egyptian President El-Sadat's press advisor, after he had obtained his Masters and PhD. in Political Science at Harvard. In his speech, Mr. Ghorbal expounded primarily on his nation's desires for a return of the territories occupied by Israel since 196 7. The ambassador· claimed that, while a ceasefire currently existed, such a condition could not be mistaken for peace. He stated, \The time has come for Israel to understand, we do not cal1 for the withering away of the State of Israel. By the same token, we are within our rights to seek the return of our territories,\ before going on to disclaim force as a means of attaining an end to the conflict. Still, while Mr. ' Ghorbal emphasized Egyptian demands for return of her territory and desire for peace, he also noted that, \You can't have peace and territory - it's either one or the other.\ In continuance with the Egyptian policy of solidifying ties SPECIAL TO with the U.S., Ambassador CONCORDlENSIS Ghorbal discussed his nation~s An innovative program has confidence that bringing the U,S. become firmly established at into the Mideast negotiating Union.

College Senate Explained The All College Senate is the superior legislative body of Union College, That is how the body that recently considered and rejected a change in the grading system is described in its By- Laws. Those By-Laws empow.er the ACS to legislate on both academic and non-academic matters, although the emphasis has recently been on academic matters. · The Senate consists of 24 members; 12 from the faculty, 6 from the Administration and 6 SPECIAL TO CONCORDIENSIS from the student body.

The faculty members of the L .. •· .'8Ui 1111 ~ Rollcall vote is taken on status of grading sys·tem at -last ThursdaJl's All College Senate meeting. Union student Bruce Mclq.ughlin is one of eight students involved in the pre-med volunteer program. The program is small. Last year during fall term the program was started with two students, last spring it included 5, and with some convincing on Dr. Roth's part, this winter it includes 8 students. The program cannot be expanded any further though. For fear that departments at the hospital will get angry and close their department to the program or worse for the departments to ignore the students and destroy the conception of the program. The hospital being a relatively small facility, just cannot handle a larger number of students. The program was originally designed for S.U.N.Y.A. students as a public service course. Dean Wylen would not accept this on a course for just volunteer work so tbe program was slightly altered. It has became an independent study comp. ed. course under Dr. Roth. The students must write a detailed research paper dealing with some area of medicine. - The reaction to this program has been mainly favorable. Dr. Roth states that students who have taken this course have found it to be an extremely valuable service. Debbie Glasser, a senior who took the course last spring stated, \It was really enjoyable and worthwhile, it changed my whole idea about being a pre- med. After J took the program I knew J.,wanted to be a doctor.\ The only fear that Dr. Roth now ltas is how to deal with the large number of students he is expecting to apply for the program. A screening process will be instituted to take care of this problem. W ome·n' s Caucus The Women's Caucus has been meeting reg!Jlarly on Monday nights in the Women's Center ( 20 I Carnegie), The main topic of the Feb. I 7 meeting was health care facilities for women - specifically safe and competent gynecological care. There are three basic clinics that are available in the area. The out-patient clinic at Albany Medical Center has three sub clinics. The gynecological clinic handles routine exams and problems not related to family planning. Appointments can be made for Monday, Tuusday and Wednesday afternoons from 1- 2:45. For family planning advice and contraceptives, the Albany Family Planning Clinic schedules appointments on Monday, Tuesday and Friday from 8·4 in addition .to evening hours on Wednesday and Thursday. For suspected pregnancies, the abortion clinic, a division of the Albany Family Planning Clinic, handles pregnancy tests and arranges for abortions (which are performed in Albany) if desired. Women over ).g need no parental permission and all records are confidential. for further information and appointments call 445-3125 and ask for the particular clinic desired. All fees are graduated. J>lanned Parent hood, located just a short walk from U.C vii at 414 Union St., also sponsors a birth control clinic. Appointments ·can be made by calling 374-5353. A word of caution here: the fee is set for students and not that inexpensive; also, last year our own campus gynecologist worked there ·· so if you want someone different. ask for the woman doctor. And last, but who said least, is Union's gynecological clinic. which is for exams and infections. It is by appointment only and then only two hours a week ·- Tuesday 12:30-2:00. In conjunction with the above information and the situation currently in the counseling center (two males, one female intern) ,the Caucus will be sponsoring a reception for all women on campus to discuss their personal experiences with the health care at Union. This is im;>ortant m order to reevaluate attitudes as well as services. Grades Continued from Page 1 administrators. Commenting on the defeat of the grading change, Smith expressed doubts that the issue would arise ag~in. However, he expressed discomfort with the present system and added, \I would hope it will be possible in the future to sit down and discuss the entire evaluation system without resorting to stereotypes.\

Still, while Mr. G horbal emphasized Egyptian demands for return of her territory and desire for peace, he also noted that, \You can't have peace and territory it's either one or the other.\ In continuance with the Egyptian policy of solidifying ties With the U.S., Ambassador Ghorbal discussed his natioN's confidence that bringing the U.S. into the Mideast negotiating process would \Bring a rule of reason to the Mideast.\ He poiAted out that the Egyptians did not feel that the British or French were capable of removing the Israelis frorn the occupied territory the Egyptians appareAtly believe that only the U.S. is capable of this. Oil Situation Discussed While return of territory seemed first on the Egyptian's list of priorities, the current oil situation and concurrent monetary shifts also ranked high in importance. Egypt is not a large producer of oil: when this is taken into consideration, the Ambassador's claims that the West cannot be hurt by \a few billion dollars from Petro-. countries\ or that the Petro- countries would be hit hard if the financial institutions of the world were to crumble, are more easily put into perspective. Egypt is in the position of not wanting to antagonize either the oil powers or the Western powers. It seems as if the Arab nations are still in the position of rationalizing their new-found power, as evidenced by Mr. Ghorbal's remark that \Oil is not the only commodity in the world that has had a rise in price.\ All in all, Ambassador Ghorbal's speech was a fascinating example of a professional diplomat at work. The functions of the foreign ambassador were also made quite obvious: a dignified mouthpiece for est abl is hed government policies. SPECIAL TO CONCORDIENSIS An innovative program has become firmly established at lJ nion. It seeks to expose a limited number of students who want to enter medicine. to the workings of a hospital, to how modern medicine operates and also how peo!'>le operate. The program, called Community Services Vohmteer Program, has entered its third term with eight students presently participating in the program. The program is under the auspices of Dr. Willard Roth, the chairman of the Biology Department. Though there is no need to work at a hospital as a requirement for medical school, Dr. Roth though that it would be a valuable experie nee for students who wanted to enter the field of medicine and who have been unable to obtain a summer job at the hospital. A few years ago he made inqumes at the local hospital on establishing a program. At St. Clair's Hospital a joint program between it and S.U.N.Y.A. had already been established. Union now is able to participate in this program. The Community Services Volunte·er Program is under the guidance of Mrs. Jeanne Swanson, Director of Volunteer Services at St. Oaire's. It is a aJai rlyuni4ue program in that students are continuously rotated on a weekly basis to a different department. One week a student will be in the emergency room, another in one of the wards, another in the cardiac care unit, another in the central supply unit, another in surgery, etc. The program is designed so that students are taught anything that is safe for them to learn.

The hospital being a relatively small facility, just cannot handle a larger number of students. The program was originally designed for S.U.N.Y.A. students as a public service course. Dean Wylen would not accept this on a course for just volunteer work so the program Was slightly altered. It has become an independent study comp. ed. course under Dr. Roth. The students must write a detailed research paper dealing with some area of medicine. I he reaction to this program has been mainly favorable. Dr. Roth states that st udcnts who have taken this course hme found it to be an extremely valuable service. Debbie (j Iasser. a senior who took the course last spring stated, \It was really enjoyable and worthwhile, it changed my whole idea about being a pre- med. After l took the program I knew J,.wanted to be a doctor.\ !he only fear that Dr. Roth now has is how to deal with the large number of students he is expecting to apply fl>r the program. A screening process will be instituted to take care of this problem. Women's Caucus !he Women's Caucus has been meeting regularly l;n Monday nights in the Women\ Center (201 Carnegie).

Page4 CONCORDIENSIS W~dnesday, February 19, 1975 New Courses Comp Ed. Changes by JUDY DEIN Several new Comp. Ed. Courses will be offered next term. They vary in topics from Peasant Revolutions to Wagnerian 0 peras. S.ome of these couFses will be taught by visiting professors. One of the new courses is entitled Contemporary American Jewish Thought (CEO 49). It will be taught ih the evening by Professor Jerome Eckstein, former chairman of the Judaic Studies Department at SUNY Albany. Professor Eckstein is quite well known in his field and has published books and articles on such great philosophers as Plato, Aristotle and Matmonides. He has also been given a .grant to do research in Israel. Professor Eckstein was voted one of the best professors at Albany. Sdent.ific Creativity is numbered CED 153 and will be taugh.t by Prof. Scaife. CEO 153 is open to any S\'lphomores and juniors except those who have taken or have AP credit for CH lO. CEO 153 requires no previous background in chemistry, and eight:h grade mathematics is more than sufficient. Continued from Pa:ge l wi-nning pf\ysiologist Sir J,ohn Eccles and the country's leading expert on the philosophy of psychology, Dr. Michael Scriven. The Symposium was the brainchild of Professors Joseph Finkelstein and Byron Nichols. Their aim was to stir up an intellectual .atmosphere at Union and in the words of Prafessor Finkelstein: ••Jfs doing what we had in mind. J:'m quite pleased.\ The discussion groups, each headed by a student facilitator and an outside faculty member, began at 8:00 last Thursday night and CQntinuecl into the small hours of the morning. They reconvened at 9:30a.m. FridaiY to reexamine their discussions in the cold light -of day. - Topics of discussion ranged from black culture to the feminist movement to behavioral psychology. For example, The course will be \'a survey ol\ Jewish philosophy as it has developed in the Twentieth Century in the U.S. Readings from Herschel, Fromm, Kaplan, Rubenstein, Rackman, and Soloveitchik\ will be discussed. It is replacing the present CEO 49 Varieties of Jewish Belief, and may be cross listed as an American Studies course. It is the only course at Union concerned with ·rwentieth Century Jewish philosophy. and if it is successful, will be offered every year. CEO 153 will utilize an experimental format in order to examine how a scientist faces a new problem .. The approach to a problem is what is important - 'seeking out what is known or given.. devising appropriate met.hods that might answer similar known questions, testing these methods and modifying them until they do answer similar known questions, and then using the methods to tackle the unsolved problem. Basically one moves fn:>m the known toward the unknown, and always in that order. Approaches to specific chemical problems will be devised by the student, utilized by the student, and criticized by the student. Dartmouth psychologist Christian Jernstedt demonstrated aversive conditio ni.ng techniques by showing male students slides of nude females and then shocking them with small electrodes attached to their fingers. Dr.· Michael Scriven speaking on the \Nature oj Personality.\ One final hew course being offered by Professor William Hagen of the English department is The Wagnerian Oper~ and 19th Century Thought. The course is \a dramatic consideration of seven Wagner operas (Lohengrin, Das Rheingold, Die Walkure, Siegfried, Gotterdammerung, Tristan and Isolde, and Parsifal) and the role of the individual will in establishing a sense of order in the l9t h century mind.\ The class will meet once a week at Professor Hagen's home to listen to the operas, and will have a discussion following each session during a scheduled two hour class period later in the week. As Profe.ssor Hagen's major discipline -is' literature he will take The reaction of the parti~ipants. was generally favorable. Accordi-ng to Dr. 0 !sen:- ••11 was an exhilarating experience. The fact that we can communicate shows that we're not just a set of organisms relating as isolated beings.\ At the luncheon, Dr. Eccles spoke on \The Human Person in Its Two .. Way Relationship with .. the Brain.\ He used an impressive array of slides to show that ••we are not just a brain: we are related to the brain as human persons.\ Eccles displayed a chart showing the ·three worlds in Which we Jive: that of physical objects, of states of cons·ciousness ami of knowledge in the o-bjective sense. He said that the interaction of the latter two is what makes humans unique and that understanding the process of consciousness is \the greatest challenge to science l·oday.\ . He spoke at great length about the complexity of the human brain. At one point, he marveled at ,fhe incredibly complicated neurological functions involved In simply moving one's finger. Dr. Scr.iven's speech was entitled: \The Personality of Man: Design, Animal, or Mechanical'?\ He took issue with facile definitions o_f humanity: \Not only is personality an elusive but aJso a mysterious entity .. : We do· nor have· a definition of personality that goes beyond the trite:\ Scriven described the four basic models of personality devised by Western man: divive animal mechanic~! and sncial.' Howeve; popular the first three may be, he stated, the last is by far the most important. He used the example of multiple personalities to demonstrate that ~'the link between personality and body is a tenuous one _... Personality is a kind of ghost in the machine (which) lies in our interaction with others as well as what is withi.n ourselves.\ The final impact of the speeches and discussion groups will probably not be known for some time to come. As Professor Nichols said: \For tnost what mattered was n'ot the -prod~ct b~t the process.\ In any event,, the symposium started something. Maybe something big. i. Two courses . will be offered next term only. They are Maoism and Peasant Revolution in Asia and Soviet Economic Development. They are being given as part -of the Comparative Communist Studies Department. Maoism is _ being taught by Professor Bruce G. Cumings from the East Asian Institute at Columbia. He is \'rare among young scholars as he is equipped not only to discuss aspects of communism in a single Asiary. country but to compare communism in North· Korea, China and North Vietnam.\ While members of Union's faculty are learned in communism in one Asian country, no one here specializes in all three places. Consequently, Professor Cumings will offer new insight into the situation in Asia as he \treats comparatively China, North Korea, and North Vietnam, viewing the revolutions in each country as responses to problems of change and development in peasant societies.\ The course will be offered Monday afternoons a symbolic dramatic approach to Wagner. The operas will be studied in the context of Romantic thinking in the 19th century. Hugh Allen Wilson has agreed to talk ~ to the class regarding the Romantic aspects of Wagner's music. A biography of Wagner and the operas (in English) will be read.

Professor Levine has published numerous articles and books concerning the Russian economy. I his course is an \analysis of the Soviet economy, concentrating chiefly upon the post-war period; central planning; pricing and incentives under socialism; alternative growth strategies; the Soviet experience as a model for development.\ It will be given on Wednesday afternoons from I :,30- 4: JU~ \'· -. \-' ,.

Taking place .in the Hale House £?ini ng Room, the \open house'; will feature wine, cheese, beer, munchies, some incidental music. and a great deal of conversation totally unrelated to grades:· courses, or professional schools. I he student ad hoc committee responsible for the event consists of Barbara Hertzberg, Andy Walsh. llisa Baron, Barbara Hershkowitz, and Betty Smal!. Ms. Hertzberg stated that the committee grew out of discussions. she had with Dean Smith about the current stat-e of student- faculty relations. Since its formation, it has been working to develop programs to better personal relatioils among · ·the different segments of the campus. and other programs are in the works. Funding for the program is uncertain; however, the open houses will be run for three weeks on a trial basis, funded by the Dean of Students. It is hoped. that the idea will generate sufficient response to pay for itself, based on a nominal charge. The program begins this Friday afternoon, February 21, in Hale House, at 4:00p.m. All members of the campus are cordially invited to attend. Continued from Page I any remaining rooms. 3.

The emphasis of American art is shifting towards a more serious a11d humanistic perspective. The objective of. today's artist has turned increasingly -towards making an honest, more straightforward statement in their art. The period of the 1960's in which art made a negative statement, one whose purpose was to shock, antagonize and anhoy the viewer. is now passing. The realist, the figurative painter. the artist who .is trying to make a clear statement on his reality appears to be the trend in American art.

' Page6 CONCORDIENSIS Wednesday, February 19, 1975 Actions Tal~en On Racism Continued from Page 1 college activities. Mem'bers of the committee agreed that much of this lack of feeling that Union was a \community\ stemmed from the institution itself. In an attempt to determine the true feelings of minority students, and to help formulate solutions ro the strained relations on campus, several students were invited to speak with tht group and relate their experiences at Union. To a quiet crowd of students, faculty and administrators approximately ten minority students cited examples of :racial discrimination they had encountered. No names were mentioned but numerous incidents of discrimination on the part of faculty members were described. The general sentiment among the students seemed to be that minorities were singled out in classes, could not walk in late because they were most \noticeable\ and that professors expected less from minority students. The final point was most disturbing to the students since they felt that professors did not take as much time to help them or offer as much constructive criticisms as they did t o white s t u dents, and consequently minority students were not getting as good an education. Complaints were also made against the bookstore which refuses to sell black greeting cards or suitable cosmetics on the grounds that it im't profitable enough. Although it seems that simply increasing the variety of goods sold could help create a feeling of home for many · students, and the suggestion has been made to the manager of the bookstore, nothing has been changed. This just adds validity to many students claims that there is subtle and very institutionalized racism practiced at Union. After further discussion regarding the problems of minority students at Union the committee decided that it is necessary to implement procedures to prevent racist practices at Union. A system of accountability whereby faculty members would be held responsible for racist behavior is presently _being drawn up. It must be noted that the faculty is not being singled out as the main perpctn~t or of Union's racist policies. Rat her, it was decided that if the faculty was made more sensitive to students needs, they could pass their knowledge on to the student body. At the faculty meeting of Wednesday, hbruary 19th, the lollowi ng proposal was discussed: Union College aspires to be a community in which no person shall be or feel discriminated_ against or mistreated. · or shall experience pain or embarrassment because of his or her race or national origin. Be it resolved that: the faculty of Union College commits itself to respect for the special feeiings and experiences of minority students, and to the implementation of assuring .fair treatment of all students. I he hope is that all members of the Union \community\ will help eliminate the \subtle and lllstitutionalitcd rac1sm Which exist~ here. lt is also hoped that minority students will use the system of accountability and bring racist actions into the open so that they can he eliminated. Subcommittees of the Ad Hoc committee will be formed to deal with specific cases. The subcommittees will be responsible lor the publicity or lack of publicity of the individual cases. lhcy will also assume responsibility for preventing Carlos Hill repercussions which would be harmful to the students involved. Ihe task of the Ad Hoc committee is not an easy one. Attitudes are hard to change and !no one kaows a fool pro0f method for making this world one free of fear. hate and discrimination. However, steps .are being taken to improve the situation at Union. Orleans A Disappointment by HERB MARTIN them on such a big tour.

The two appointments are part of a major new effort in the general area of recreational sports, .carry-over sports, and intercollegiate club sp0rts for both men and women. In announcing the appointments, President Thomas N. Bonner described them as part of an effort to make Union a leader among small colleges in praviding athletic opportunities for aU students. · Planning the· new programs will begin immediately, with FaH 1976 as the target date for full implementation of the plans. ;,A major aspect of this undertaking,\ Dr. Bonner stated, \is the jlevelQpment of an outstanding progfat:Q of women's sports an.d recreational opportunities.\ He said some $1'1, 000 has already been budgeted for women's sports next year. Women's intercollegiate sports to be offered next· year will .include field hockey, volleyball, bask~tball, softball, and tennis. Women will also participate with men in intercollegiate swimming and track. Women's lacrosse will be offered either as an intercollegiate - sport o.r a Club sport.

Post Topples Hoopsfers -66-60 by HANK BERSTEIN AND BRIAN TUCKER Union College did n.ot move ahead of C. W. .Post in the New Y ~rk State rankings this week. Union remained #3 in New York behind Post and #I ranked Brockport. After thumping Hamilton here last Wednesctla)rhy 9, the Garnet ·went ofi an \overnight\ to Greenvale, - L.l. a.nd came out on the short side of a 66-60 score with Post. Union's record now stands at 15~3, with 4 games remaining in the regular season. Union CoHe:ge handed \Burly\ Pete Meola skies past Hamilton's Muciatelli as Charlie Gugliotta looks on. Hamilton a defe!!t for the second time this season Wednesday night, 72-63. The Dut{;hmen started out slowly and at the intermission were up but 6. Mody had a tremendous half, often freeing himself for jumpshots while pouring in 14 points. Although Mody cooled a bit in the second half, Gugliotta and Meola picked up where he left off and paced the squad. Union maintained about a 9-10 p-oint spread throughout much of the second stanza, even leading once by 13 points. Gug played his usual solid game scoring 21 poi.nts on over 50% shooting from the field and grabbing over a handfui of rebounds. Moreover, though, Meola proved to be the key in his' first home start of his varsity career. -Pete smothered his Grapplers End At 8-5 by FRANESCO ISGRO The Union College grapplers closed their regular season last Wednesday by dropping a close 27-17 decision to visiting Colgate University. The absence of co- captain Tom Everett and frosh Robin Bennet, both out with injuries, was definitely a deciding factor in the outcome of the meet. Freeman Victorious The match which left Union 8-5 for the season was highlighted by Bruce freeman's stellar performance in the final dual meet of his career. Bruce pinned his opponent in I :42 and received a standing ovation from the crowd. The match was his last in the Alumni Gym as he will not be able to compete next year. He is a five-year M.E.-I.E. major, and next year he hopes to assist Co.ach Km!ll in bvilding a better wrestling team. Bruce's Il-l record will give him a good. seed at the New York State Tournament where he might possibly have to meet his counterpart from Binghamton who handed him his only loss. Sophomore Bill McClintock concluded a disappointing l-9 season but exhibited spirit and hustle throughout. Freshman Jim Sutton who has just injured his leg nipped his Colgate counterpart 2-1 and concludes an outstanqing 9-3 season. ·Tom Everett also sidelined with an injury, concluded the season with a 7-2-i. Tom might be- able to compete in the Nationals if he recovers from his injury. Chet Karwatowski who is replacing Tom for the moment, was 1re~~i~~:a;tih~ylo~i: e~~~~:~7! ~\;*'; -- record at 2-2. Mike Paquette, in the 167 pound division blanked ' his last opponent 8-0 and brought his record to 6-6. Frosh sensation Josh Saltzman posted his tenth win in thirteen starts and will be a top contender for reaping honors at the State Tournament. Greg Lyons dropped his last match against Colgate and will enter the State meet with a 5-7-1 record. Commenting on the outcome of the season, second year mentor Coach Knull said that \it was a very good year.\ \We're definitely building a program\ he added', \and next year we will improve our schedule. We have a very young team and we should be able to improve this year's 8-5 opponent on d·efense, holding him to but 2 points in the second h;ilf after 14 in the first' stanza.

W. · Post won a strong defensive battle on Saturday night; Coach Scanlon was understandably disappointed in the Garnet's offensive .showing, parti¢ularly in the n wnber of shots missed. \We could have pJ(lyed better. .. our defense d'id a g{lod job, but our offense left something to be desired.\ The Garnet forced Post into numerous turnovers, 3 I in .all, but just could not consistently capit~lize on them. Union boasted an 8-0 lead very early in the contest, but Post fought back, knotted the score at I 0, and went into the locker \room at half with a slim I point margin, 25~24. With hundreds ·of backers in the stands (almost three quarte.rs of the spectators were Union fans), the Garnet were definitely psyched to overcome Post's defense in the se<:;ond half wit-h better offensive execution and thus increase their eight game winning streak to 9. ~ The Pioneers had other ideas. T;hey built their 1ead up to 10 pQints in the first five minutes of ~·\'··----·\'~- the second half and the. Dutchmen were never to catch 'up.

You have never been and it's quite apparent that you can never be able to relate to your fellow brothers and sisters. Since your appointment as Asst. Dean and Director of AOC, you've fallen in line like a good little boy. If ever you possessed such a quality, you have all()wed the white administrators to :strip you of your Slackness. 1his position made you feel omnipotent, but in reality my· good Dean, you are · very impotent. I would like to know if it's possible for you to be ••for real'!\ Can you fit this in your repertoire or has it been so long since you've used it, that you can't find it? You said, \I apologize for many of my mistakes,\ well, Dean, it appears from your .past, present and possibly your future actions that this statement was part of your plan to deceive the Black students on this campus. Your disguise \was crystal clear. You only fooled yourself (smile). They say that a word to the wise is sufficient, but to you I say., \Learn to be 'for real' and people will accept and relate to you.\ Signed. Your Diagnostician TO THE EDITOR OF \PERSPECTIVE\ February 17 The February 5, 1975 issue of \Perspective\ contained an article relative to the break~ins and thefts from the Arts Department on January 21, 22, and 26, 1975. With reference to the contents of the article I wish to state that during my continuing investigation ol the thefts .of college property from the Arts Department, no one has been accused of such . thefts, particularly the Co~Chairmen of the Bfqck Student's Alliance; nothing has been said by me indicating the' four black students in the class have been implicated in the thefts; and no one to my knowledge has accused any black ·student of being the culprit. I certainly have not. During my investigation of the thefts I have talked to various individuals, black and white, both a~ the scene of the thefts, and those class members l have been able to contact at their residences, for any possible leads in the matter. Among those I talked to were Jay King, Thomas Watts and William Collins. ihese individuals were contacted for any possible leads in the mat-ter, not as suspects. I did not request any of them to let me examine it nor did I handle any of their equipment. At the time of contacting Collins he volunteered to show me t'he .Black Student's Alliance darkroom and even opened it for me. In discharging the responsibility of my office and investigating thefts of college property, I will continue to contact anyone, black or white, who I feel will be able to furnish information in helping me solve such thefts. • Jobn H. Kleinkauf Foul Play I was distressed by the way in which the U.S.A./ Faculty basketball game \\'\' :played on the lOth of Feb, at noon - was refereed. For the Black audience who viewed the game, including myself, it was disappointing to see the team that should have won the game, lose, because of the failure of the referee to make obvious calls which would have cinched the game for the B.S.A. I should hope tha~ in the~ future, any games between teams in first place standings should be required to have two referees. Special preferences should be made when the B.S.A. plays because of the obvious biases that exist against- the B:S.A. team.

My deahng Fable·s The purpose of the following interview . is an attempt to air some answers to some of the questions many people have had for Assistant Dean Carlos llill. Because there was so much hearsay about the man and his position, Perspective interviewed him on the morning of Valentine's Day in his office. The questions asked were those contributed by a number of concerned Black students who realized that Carlos will be in the driver's seat for minority groups on campus next year and that now is the time to familiarize the rest of us with him. Persp: Would you define what you think your job is in relation to the BSA'! Carlos: My job in terms of all Black students on campus is to help them· in any way I can to get through this institution. As far as allocating funds to the BSA, <llle of my functions would be to act in an advisory capacity in the sense of making sure that the funds are not on'ly spent wisely but ate spent carefully ... that they are not s.pent without any thought being given to them. Persp: What is your relat-ion to Jay within the school? Carlos: Jay and I have d\'!veloped a relationship wherein we work well together, in terms of gettillg what we can done for AOC students in particular and makitlg sure that the problems they face in this institution do not rnake tl)em sink . .Jay and I don't agree bn everything; we have a lot of philosophical differences, but in order to make the program work, especially AOC. we have to stand together as a team. If there is continual friction coming from this office, then what will happen is that we will turn the st ude11ts off because they'll see a tremendous amount of animosity between us which is not necessary. The offices are equal though we do at times have different responsibilities. Pcrsp: Are you aware of any strained relationships between Jay and the BSA'? Carlos: Yeah, very much aware. Persp: Do you feel that those animosities that were directed towards him could have rubbed off on you'! feelings. Persp: Have you ever seen any reason for these feelings to be justified'!\ Carlos: Yeah, individual differences sometimes. There are things which stand out that students notice. Persp: Are you and Jay supposed to be some kind .of mediators between the rest of the administration and faculty and Black students'? with the BSA in te.rms of going to the me;etings, a·nd in terms of Carlos: Yeah.

DEAN Dear Dean Ailing, I am repulsed by your actions and attitudes. Your so-called guises of caring and helpfulness are quite transparent. You have never been and it's q uitc apparent that you can never be able to relate to your fellow brothers and sisters. Since y()ur appointment as Asst. Dean and Director of AOC. you've fallen in line like a good little boy. If ever you possessed such a 4uality, you have allowed the white administrators to strip you of your Blackness. This position made you feel omnipotent, but in reality my good Dean, you are very impotent. I -would like to know if it's possible for you to be \for real'?\ Can you fit this in your repertoire or has it been so long since you've used it, that you can't find it'? You said. \I apologize for many of my mistakes,\ well, Dean, it appears from your past. present and possibly your future act ions that this statement was part of your plan to deceive the Black students on this campus. Your disguise ·was crystal clear. You only fooled yourself (smile). I hey say that a word to the wise is sufficient, hut to you I say, \Learn to be 'for rear and people will accept and relate to you.\ Signed. Your Diagnostician TO THE EDITOR OF \PERSPECTIVE\ l<'ebruary 17 The February 5, 1975 issue of \Perspective\ contained an article relative to the break-ins and thefts from the Arts Department on January 21, 22, and 26, 1975. With reference to tlile contents of the article I wish to state that during my continuing investigation of the thefts of college property from the Arts Department, no one has been accused of such thefts, particularly the Co-Chairmen of the Black Student's Alliance; nothing has been said by me indicating the four black students in the class have been implicated in the thefts; and no one to my knowledge has accused any black student of being the culprit. I certainly have not. During my investigation of the thefts I have talked to various individuals, black and white, both at the scene of the thefts, and those class members I have been able to contact at their residences, lor any possible leads in the matter. Among those I talked to were Jay King, Thomas Watts and William Collins. These indivicluals were contacted lor any possible leads in tlile matter, not as suspects. I did not request any of thern to let me examine it nor did I handle any of their equipmeHt. At the time of contacting Collins he volunteered to show me the Black Student's A Ilia nee darkroom and even opened it for me. In discharging the resflonsi bility of my office and investigating thefts of college property, I will continue to contact anyone, black or white, who I feel will be able to furnish information in helping me solve such thefts. John H. Kleinkauf Foul Play I was distressed by the way in which the B.S.A /Faculty basketball game - played on the lOth of Fe.b. at noon was refereed. For the Black audience who viewed the game, inclljdimg myself. it was disappoiRting to see the team that should have won the game, lose, because of the failure of the referee to make ol>vious calls which would have cinched the game for the B.S.A J should hope that in the future, any games between teams in first place standings should be reyuircd to have two referees. Special preferences should be made when the B.S.A. plays because of the obvious biases that exist against the B:S.A. team. I lccl strongly that the B.S.A. game against the faculty team should be replayed. Asst. Dean Carlos Hill Testimonial to My Beloved Alma Mater Dear U.C., I am a graduating senior who wishes to express my sincere gratitude for the vast acquisition ol knowledge, which I migltt say I've acquired at good old U .C. I prefer my aJ:lonymity because I wouldn't want anyone to blush because of such a complimentary letter coming from -- of all things a BLACK student. I rn u:;t say that I've leamed a great deal of r;~ew words to add to my once miniscule vocabulary which consisted of a few simple words like pride, dignity, etc. Now I know words like inani:ty, fatuity, asininity, which yon all felt were ywalities of my race of people and which we found you all possessed. I've learned words like maligned, berated, vilified, which are all ways that you treated me lor four long years. I've watched as some of my big college year dreams were never effected, executed ... consummated. I saw in your eyes and heard in your voice bias, predilection and intolerance. However. m all that I've learned I've never forgotten simple words like pride, dignity and self-esteem. After these four wonderful years at U.C. I sincerely hope that you accept my thanks as well as my sincere wish that you all osculate my breech! Gratefully yours, Syn 0. Nym '75 OPINION The head o·l security's blundering efforts to impHcatc 4 Hlack students in the recent break-ins at the Art Building should not go unheeded, but serve as aH example to white students of the type of pressures Black students at Union face. Not o~tly was this act an implicitly racist one, but one which, had a Black man been the instigator, would have cost him his job on the grounds of incompetence. Herr Kleinkauf, by no stretch of the imagination, is a fool. Of a pool of a possible 20 or more suspects (il they can so be called) four of whom were the first to be 'cross-examined,' one at IQis off- campus residence a!'ld others at their dormitory strongholds. H. Kleinkauf, upon being questioned, firmly stated that none of the whi:te students could be found for questioning · the sixteen odd.... W.hat! I'm indignant. ... Come on Kleinkauf, you\ve spent too much time with Hoover and ·the F. H. I. to be perceived as such a fool. White racism is so much a part of the fabric of the Union environment that we sometimes fail to analyze the incidents that occur in order to emphasize the realities of our day to day existence. If white administrators on the campus were serious about curbing racism. Kleinkauf would have been looking for a new job with the KKK two weeks ago.

Now, the bwacks were very angry and told everyone of the injustice they received when this happened and the custador decided to solve the matter by asking the bwacks to leave but not the whitezoids. The bwacks defended their rights and told the whole truth to the bwack paper. The whitezoids decided to retaliate by acting as if there were so many stories that neither the bwacks or whitezoids could possibly be telling the truth and at the same time save their faces as well as their aces. Well the \bwacks know the truth and the whitezoids know how to twist it. THE END MORAL: He who knows the truth to twist shall regret what he twisted as truth!

If the program is so ineffective, how come Union College finds a need to employ those people when they leave Upward Bound, . . It seems that in looking for an ~xcuse to destroy the program, there are cer4tinly enough problems to be found ... The attempt is not to find that which is good, that defeats their whole purpose ... Mark Smith came to Union talking about uniting various factions of the campus which are divided. I've seen just the opposite. Not only are Black students dissatisfied with his administration, t·here are also a lot of white students who are. One of the main tactics he uses is \Divide and Conquer\. He's tried it with Leroy Mooreand me,and with Mrs. Reid and me The man is a grand deceiver of people in dividing. and conquering. His aim is probably to remove the elements on campus ·who have peeped his whole card and know what he~s all about. He hopes the · more vocal students either graduate quickly or flunk out and any administrator who knows where he comes from shaH be retnoved. I think l am one of these people. Mark Smith can do nothing but -have the greatest respect for me because he knows I am a man who will stand up and tell him those things that I think are not right. I don't mind leaving, I just don't appreciate the manner in which che tries to do it. My interest is to open. people's eyes to the manner in which he operates with 'upward Bound and Black students on campus. If 'I can do that then I think 1 will have been successful in -this whole conflict ·between Upward Bound and his office.\ Ronald \X\ Westbrook, squares off after the Intramural -Boxing Matches. Mr. Westbrook won hismatch. Night at the Fights Thursday Feb. 13, at 7;00, Union College held Boxing lntramurals - in the Wrestling ''\-rQQm at the gym. The scene resembled closely a real fight, complete with blood, sweat and tears. Winning the first leg of the tournament for the Universal Brotherhood was Eddie Adams, Ron Westbrook, Jeff Broomes, Milt Herring and Fred Baru. Advancing to the second leg and in St,me cases to the finals were: Ron West'brook, Milt Herting, and Jeff Broomes. Because of lack of hea.vy weight entries, Rich Burrell fought only once. defeating Vince Verdile for the championship of the heavyweight division. Jeff Broomes beat \Wildman\ Milt Herring for the Middleweight Champions·hip, and Ron Westbrook took the Lighweight division, by beating Ed Adams. Ro\lnding up the night was a default win for Jim Trump over Dave :Boggs, after Dave came down with ar lame leg, after winning his match against John Eklund. The night was a total success with varlous celebrities attending. Among the celebrities were: Leonard ··soudini\ Herman \Roger\ Mohammad, the famous lspy '\Editor\ Person, Sharon \Clean\ Brown, and Amanda \Appropriate\\ Fuller. Hall of Fame Not for Russell Thoughts of the l96g Summer Olympics are ringing in my mind. I'm quite sure that we all remember when Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised clenched fists during their victory ceremonies . while the National Anthem was being played. Soy, did this cause a lot of political turmoil in this country. And now it appears that the refusal of Bill Russell to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, is causing 4 uite a buu amund these United States of America. I guess aU of white America is _wondering why he would turn down such a \glorious\ offer. when the game of basketball has done so much for him, Well. what aho·uf all that Bill Russell has contributed to the game'! In my opinion, he was the first defensive-minded center that the game hasseen. He set a trend that still exists today. As a player- coach with th~ Boston Celtics, he led the team to two world titles. And now, as the coach of the Seattle Supersonics, he has made the team a playoff contender. In his refusal to accept induction into the Hall of Fame, Mr. Russell gave no reasons why he wished not to be, and any cllnjecture on my part would be clearly prejudicial against any white-oriented structure. I think that Mr. Russell's choice not to be among the \elite\ members of the Hall of Fame should be respected. and all comm~:;nts against his position be laid to rest.

Mark Smith came to Union talking about umttng various factions of the campus which are divided. I've seen just the opposite.

He's tried it with Leroy M ooreand mc.and with Mrs. Reid and me I he man is a grand deceiver of people in di\ iding and con4uering. His aim is probably to remove the elements on campus who have peeped his whole card and know what he's all about. He hopes the more vocal students either graduate 4uickly or flunk out and any administrator who knows where he come' from shall be removed. I think 1 arn one of the~e people. Mark Smith can do nothing but haw the greatest respect lor me because he knows I am a man who will stand up and tell him those things that I think arc not right. I don't mind ka1mg.

Mr. Westbrook won his march. Night at the Fights Thursday Feb. 13, at 7:00, Union College held Boxing lntramurals -- in the Wrestling mom at the gym. The scene resembled closely a real fight, complete with blood, sweat and tears. Winning the first leg of the tournament for the Universal Brotherhood was Eddie Adams, Ron Westbrook, Jeff Broomes, Milt Herring and Fred Baru. Advancing to the second leg and in snme cases to the finals were: Ron Westbrook, Milt Herring, and Jeff Broomes. Because of lack of heavy weight entries, Rich Burrell fought only once, defeating Vince Verdile for the championship of the heavyweight division. Jeff Broomes beat \Wildman\ Milt Herring for the Middleweight Championship, and Ron Westbrook took the Lighweight division, by beating Ed Adams. Rounding up the night was a default win for Jim Trump over Dave Boggs, after Dave came down with a lame leg, after winning his match against John Eklund. The night was a total success with various celebrities attending.

E I see those trees out there, I sure do! c I see those beautiful, gorgeous straightforward and to the point Black, brown, chocolate, mahogany colored trees! And I'm gonna keep on seein' 'em too! Snow melts! Utarnu H Black Students in Sciences ~ Where Are They? Many remarkable changes have occurred in recent decades in the fields of science and technology. One thing, however, has remained the same: the extremely small number of Blacks in these fields. The best illustn;1tion of this disgusting situation lies in the area of engineering. In 1973, out of more than 43,000 people that graduated from engineering schools, only an estimated 574 were Black; a mere I J%. That has to change if Black people are to have any control over their own destiny. Otherwise the equality of minorities will remain a myth. We live in a technical world that constantly needs imp~oving. We must learn how it works and know how to improve it. If more Blacks are not educated in engineering and other sciences, we can hang it up. We can look forward to an endless future of following someone ~~else's programs. Union College is definitely not helping the matter; there hasn't been a Black engineering graduate from this institution in a decade. The Biology Department hasn't done inuch better. The Chemistry Department need not b.e mentioned. It should be nominated for the \Lily-white Department of the Century\ award. The Physics Department would surely be f:irst runner up in the finals. The shame of it all; is that most of the Black students who have been here in the past and that are here in the present have the ability in math and science to make it as engineers, doctors, chemists, etc. It is quite obVious that Union College either cannot or will not develop the talents of its Black students. Jt chooses instead to induce Blacks to change their majors from the sciences they originally choose to something like His tory, English or Psychology. Such majors are fine for stl.ldents that have families with money and influence. But Black students need to leave lJ nion with something that will put money in their pockets. As things stand, the selection of majors is solely based on the cumulative index which is easily manipulated by the whims of professors. As long as Union gets several thousands of dollars in government monies for each of its minority students, Blacks will come and .go. Whether or not we leave with something we want and · need, Union couldn't care less. This attitude seems typical of other white institutions across the country; especially in the North. Many big corporations, i.e. General Electric, claim to be searching relentlessly for minority students with .good technical backgrounds; many of the great institutions of higher learning cannot produce any: What a coincidence! Trade Mark As a member of the B.S.A. I feel that we owe a special tribute to our dear and beloved editor, lsidra Susette Person. Throughout the entire year she has been in the foreground on many vital issues pertaining to the B.S.A. She has struggled to get Black recognition within many group associations, athletics, and Administrative activities. Her services to us and the adjoining communities and general public hav~ enabled many people to feel that they do play a significant role. here at Union College, and in the community. lsp:y deserves all the credit that can be given to a person in such a position, as Editor of a newspaper. and it is for this purpose I wish to congratulate and thank lspy for the fine job she has done. bpy's interest in the Perspective began in her Junior year, when the paper was just starting to unfold, !spy was one of the prime persons who would contribute articles to the paper frequently. Entering her Senior year, she was elected by her fellow B.S.A. members. as Editor-in-Chief on the grounds that she was reliable, had written well in the past. and cveryo11e was positive she could do a Hell of a job. !spy started out as a Pre-Med niajor. but since has switched to English, She plans .to go to Journalism School, upon graduation. and as of yet, hasn't received any replies. She will be traveling to Bogota, Coh,11ll bia, dul\i11g the spring term, to take advttntagc of the term a broad program. The next issue of Perspective will b'e the last for her as Editor. In that issue she will summa.rize some of her experiences as Editor. Once again the RS.A. would like to thank lspy for the great job she has done for us and our organization. We would like to wish her all the continual success in the .future. Keep On Keeping On!

I see those beautiful, gorgeous straightforward and to the point Black, brown, chocolate, mahogany colored trees! And I'm gonna keep on seein' 'em too! Snow melts! Where Are They? Many remarkable changes have occurred in recent decades in the fields of science and technology. One thing, however, has remained the same: the extremely small number of Blacks in these fields. The best illustration of this disgusting situation lies in the area of engineering. In 1973, out of more than 43,000 people that graduated from engineering schools, only an estimated 574 were Black; a mere I .3%. f hat has to change if Black people are to have any control over their own destiny. Otherwise the equality of minorities will remain a myth. We live in a technical world that const.antly needs improving. We must learn how it works and know how to improve it. If more Blacks are not educated in engineering and other sciences, we can hang it up. We can look forward to an endless future of following someone 1 ·else's Utamu programs. Union College is definitely not helping the matter; there hasn't been a Black engineering graduate from this institution in a decade. lhe Biology Department hasn't done much better. The Chemistry Department need not be mentioned. It should be nominated for the \Lily-white Department of the Century\ award. The Physics Department would surely be first runner up in the finals. The shame of it all is that most of the Black students who have been here in the past and that are here in the present have the ability in math and science to make it as engineers, doctors, chemists, etc. It is quite obvious that Union College either cannot or will not develop the talents of its Black students. It chooses instead to induce Blacks to change their majors from the sciences they originally choose to something like History, English or Psychology. Such majors are fine for students that have families with money and influence. But Black students need to leave Union with something that will put money in their pockets. As things stand, the selection of majors is solely based on the cumulative index which is easily manipulated by the whims of professors. As long as Union gets several thousands of dollars 1n government monies for each of its minority students, Blacks will come and go. Whether or not we leave with something we want and need, Union couldn't care less. This attitude seems typical of other white institutions across the country, especially in the North. Many big corporations, 1.e. General Electric, claim to be searching relentlessly for minority students with good technical backgrounds; many of the great institutions of higher learning cannot produce any. What a coincidence!

Shupe; whose office has in its possession 98% ~f all applications it will receive for class of '79 positions, commented that the target number for the class was 490, down 50 from last year's class. The predominant reason for the drop was cited by Shupe to be housing pressures. He noted that since college living units h~d been op.erating at dose to ·100% capacity for 3 years, and a small senior class was being graduated, a fewer number of freshmen can be accomodated next fall. Applications for admission, meanwhile, have already surpassed last year's total. Thus, with applications up and positions down, Shupe stated that 1979 would be a. selective class; difficult to get into. He noted that as recently as five weeks ago, applications Throngs of thirsty UCol/ residents pack Hale House for last Friday's inaugural Student- Faculty Social Hour.

Admissions Procedure Now that applicatiens are in (those still arrivinJ: are being considered individually; with many being returned), Shupe and the Admissions Committee are beginning the selection process. This process begins with each folder of a candidate for admission' being read by several of the committee members. An average folder gets four readers, and each reader evaluates and recommends accept, reject, wait- list, or committee. The folder goes to the full committee if there is a severe disagreement amongst readers, or if the readers recommend the f outth option. The f11ll c<!lmmittee, consisting of two administrators, eight faculty members, and six students, then votes on the candidate (the three members of the Admissions Staff are on the commiltee but do not vote). Student Involvement Shupe commented on changes being made in the Admissions Office. and cited an attempt to gain more recruiting strength from students and alumni as the ''JCUs of present efforts. He noted that Union was only the second cortege in the nation to place st udcnts on its admissions committee, however, student involvement in recruitment has not been as great. A task force is currently working on three directions for increased stUdent recruttmg involvement: a host 1 hostess program to allow sub-freshmen to visit the campus for more than one afternoon, a program to be run in the spring inviting accepted students to visit Union, and some sort of student publication to cQmplement Continued on Page 7 Central Mailroom Located in Carnegie Hall Special to CONCORDIENSIS The mail room in Carnegie will be open and in 'full operation as of the beginning of the spring term. The general procedure for assigning and maintaining mailboxes will be as follows: Every full time undergraduate student will be assigned a mailbox upon entering Union. This box number will be kept for the entire time that a student is enrolled at Union. In the case of a student taking a leave of absence, or leaving for whatever reason, his or her mailbox number will not be assigned to anyone else for the next two terms, or until it has ' been established that the student is not returning to Union. This ensures, as far as possible, that a student maint~ins a permanent mailing address. Presently students in dormitories, with the exception of a few buildings, have a mailbox assigned to them. Anyone who presently has a mailbox assignment will keep this same number. Thus, if your current address is box 5021, it will be the same for next term and until you leave Union. Off campus students and commuting students do not have mailbox numbers. They will receive their box numbers in the mail along with their spring term schedules sent from the Registrar's Office. There will be one change for students who currentJy maintain a mailbox. Though the actual box number remains the same, the physical mailbox will be different and the combination will be Continued on Page 3 Registration Spring Term classes wiU begin at ~:30 A.M. on Monday, March JIst. Student schedules will be distributed to college addresses prior to the beginning of classes.

Formal registration and \alidation of I.D. cards will take place in the Gymnasium on Monday and I uesday, March 31 and April I. from ~t45 to 11:30 A.M. and from 1:00 to 4:00P.M.

As in other little kingdoms, the peasants of Unicas labored and toiled in the king's fields and were paid for their services at the end of each season (except for summer which was set aside for frolicking and proliferation), However, U nicas was peculiar in that t.he peasants were .paid according to a special system called \The Divine Five- Point System.\ Under this time~ honored system, the King's ministers would ·appraise the work of each peasant at the end of each season, and then after a,pplying a \magical formula,\ award the peasant either four hundred,. three hundred, two hundred; one hundred or zero f.arthings. It was not possible for a peasant to receive anything in betwe.en. Now strange as it might seem, the peasants of the land of Unicas were quite fond of the \Divine Five-Point System.\ No one really knew what the \magical formula\ was. In fact, it was widely rumoured that each royal minister used a different magical formula. Yet this gave the system a definite appeal, since every peasant could always hope to get paid a full four hundred farthings for only doing about three hundred and fifty farthings worth of work. This was especially appealing to a vociferous group. -of peasants called the \Pre-Alchemists\ who were trying to save up enough farthings to ·be acce.pted as apprentices in alchemy school. What most Unicans failed to . notice was that it more often than a more refined system · of payment. They were supported by a: friendly giant named \Smitty the Fair\ who often acted as an intermediary between the King and the peasants. The giant tried to convince the pre-alchemists that Alchemy Schools had trouble evaluating the wealth of peasant applicants paid under the \Divine Five-Point System.~· He was backed by some sympathetic ministers Who were sick of having to deal with complicated ·~magical formulas.\ After much debating and bickering between the two . factions of peasants of opposing viewpoints, for and against the \Divine Five-Point System,\ a poll was taken by a group of peasants. It revealed that almost seventy per cent of the U nicans were emphatically against any change in the existing system. After all, like the principles of Geecentrism. and Spontaneous Generation, it was well established in Unicas, and obvious to anyone with common sense, that a finer payment system would mean increased money- grubbing and competition in the fields (which was pretty bad already).· The dissenting peasants were stoned in the market place, Smitty the Fair was tarred and feathered, and the King's ministers went back to their business as usual.

For too long 1 have watched events take place; I would like to play an active role at this point and thus this statement. The piHential is great for . the Arts at Union, the realization .is a very small fraction thereof. A problem: . The most lacking factor here is communication. Communication between faculty and students, between faculty and faculty, students and students, art and non-art majors alike. Without any communication, there can be NO possible hope for success. Without any cooperation, what small . numbers of the 'art community' will become even smaller and divided. Therefore some attempt should be made immediately to change this. One way is to get the various people involved in the arts to talk together about their work, their attitudes, life, the state of the economy, ANYTHING that would promote a greater unity than there exists now ~ ·which is nil An idealist' would say, eliminate the politics and get down to the 'nitty gritty' of el,!c~ person.

This is about Union College, and some of the things which have been happening here. If you have not noticed (which seems hard to believe) Union's fave>rite sport may just be, ''Boy, do I hate this place.\ The game involves everyone sitting around in their room or in the 'Skeller, and telling each other how lousy the soci~l life is, how unrespons\ive the college is to student needs, how the whole student body is just a bunch of jerks and cut- throats who are only out for themselves, and in general how everything sucks. The basic skills required to play the game are: cynicism; an ability to be obnoxious; a desire to blame everyone else for everything that's \wrong\; and a powerful unwillingness to do anything about the situation. I consider myself qualified to speak on the sport, because, up 'till a very short while ago, I considered myself one of the best players of the game. Sitting in Saga and cutting up people as they walked by was a lot of fun. Complaining about things (but God forbid doing something!) was also a blast. I've given this up though (at least I hope so) for something else called \trying.\ \Trying\ is an even simpler game to play. I'll tell you a couple of good plays. Next time you're in the 'Skeller and you go up for another pitcher, try smiling (you . remember how, don't you?) and saying \please.\ Try saying \hello\ to people who've been in your class for eight weeks, people who you walk by every day while staring . so attentively at your shoes. Try saying \hi\ to the people you've been seeing around here for the last couple of years, and never bothered to talk to. Next time you see somebody who looks like they're having trouble, why not try and help'? (Just talking can mean a lot.) Don't forget professors, they're people too.

Without any cooperation, what small numbers of the 'art community' will become even smaller and divided. Therefore some attempt should be made immediately to change this. One way is to get the various people involved in the arts to talk together about their work, their attitudes, life, the state of the economy, ANYTHING that would promote a greater unity than there exists now which is niL An idealist would say. eliminate the politics and get down to the 'nitty gritty' of each person. This however, can be applied as a realistic approach to the problem.

l Page4 arts CONCORDIENSIS, Wednesday, February 26, 1975 Fil·ms The Last Detail-. March 1, 2: 7, 9, 11, 50e, R The. Last Detail is a wildly raucous and poetically compleX portratt of an arrogant but sensitive sailor played by Jack Nicholson. It is the compassionate story of two veteran sailors who escort a young recruit to the brig. The movie was n.ominated for an Academy Award. · · * * * * King of Hearts - March 4: 8, 10, 40~~: It is near the end of WWI, and logic is not what it once was. The film takes place in a small French '-\:illage where the citizens have fled and, thoughtfully, unlocked the gates of the local insane asylum before they left. To find out what happens; come see the film. * * * * Cheyenne Autumn - March 3: 7, 10, 2~¢ Glee Club at its Best This film, starring. Richard Widmark, Carol Baker and Karl Malden, is John Lord's great western adventure-thrill~r. The story,· based on the novel by Maori Sandoz, revolves around the remnants of a band of Northern Cheyenne who, after a year of neglect, starvation, and death on an Oklahoma reservation, flee their old homeland. The Simrno11s College Chorale came to Schenectady this weekend ~o stage a concert with the Union Glee Club. The Union men were not exactly gracious hosts, however, as they stole the show with their selection, Songs of the Sea, by Stanford. The Union Glee Club has performed Songs of the Sea before, but never have they sounded better than they did tllis Sunday. Soloist Keith Kibler gave his usual fine performance, and the overall effect of the piece was quite thrilling. Particlllarly in the last song, The Old Superb, the sound achieved by the group was tremendous, completely filling the Memorial Chapel, yet never sounding the least bit forced. · The Simmons Chorale sang sacred choruses by three Romantic trusters as their contribution. Laudate Pueri by Mendelssohn, Die Cappale by Schumann and. Brahms' Psalm 13 were all given a good reading, but unfortunately they seemed a bit pale in comparison to the Songs of the Sea and the rousing performance which they received. Completing the program were three selectio!ls by 17th century English composer Henry .Purcell, which combined the forces of the two choirs, four soloists, and a small orchestra. The first offering was the Trumpet Sonata in D, which helped t0 set the mood for the Jubilate Vee in D Major. This was well performed and had a p r o m i n en t r o I e f o r countertenor. The last selection of The Women's Caucus met on l<'ebruary 24 and the following ~~~~ diSl'm<oed and/ or planrted: I) Thtn '\.ill he an open meeting fm .all \\Omen on \F\p('rienrr• \ith lht· C) nrrologica I St'n irr' at I nion,\ nn I ll!'..,!ht}. ,\tarrh ·t at R p.m. iTJ 211i Carnrgir.

MULCAHY the aft~rnoon was Purcell's Come Ye Sons of Art. The glee clubs seemed to sing well together, and the four soloists (Charles Schinkel and K.enneth Fitch; countertenors; Sue Ellen Kuzma, soprano; and Keith Kibler, bass) all sang well, although the countertenors did not reach the. incredible level of quality established by the countertenors of the King's Singers in the. fall. The performers did well throughout the afternoon, and deserve a lot of credit. the only disappointment was the tiny size of the audience. Once again, Union's over-achiever community could not spare a few hours away from the books to listen to a fine concert at a bargain price (free). The singers put a lot of effort into the concert. It seems a pity that more students couldn't take the minimal effort of goin~ to Hsten to it. Jazz E·nsemble The Union College De.partment of the. Arts has announced its ,sponsorship of a Jazz Ensemble that will participate in the mid- May concert appearance at Memorial Chapel featuring other m usic;tl organizations. · This exciting new learning experience, one which ~ long overdue at Union, will be under the direction -of Keith Warner, a Berkley College of Music alumnus. Bright Spot in Music The challenging ·new repertoir~ has been selected to provide the ensemble members with an experience that will expand their musical knowledge of the Ellington, Buddy Rich, Chuck Mangione idi·om 'through participation in performance as well as discussions aboi,Jt arranging original compositions for the ensemble. Amidst the desert of creativity that popular music has become, an occasional bright spot is a rare and welcome respite. One of the brightest of the bright is the Electric Light Orchestra, who with their fourth album, \Eldorado: A Symphony\ ~hine as conspicuously refreshing artists at the peak of their powers. While many other rock musicians have begun to rely on the stimulation of senses other than the aural, ELO's goals a~e the ear and mind. Sounding somewhat like a conglomeration of \Magical Mystery Tour\ Beatles, vintage Dylan, late sixties acid-rock, with a touch of a 1940's Broadway musical, ELO manages to draw upon the best f-acets of these without being at all plagiatistic.

The story, based on the novel by Maori Sandoz, revolves around the remnants ef a band of Northern Cheyenne who, after a year of neglect, starvation, and death on an Oklahoma reservation, flee their old homeland. The Simmons College Chorale came to Schenectady this weekend to stage a concert with the Union Glee Club. The Union men were not exactly gracious hosts, however, as they stole the show with their selection, Songs of the Sea, by Stanford. The Union Glee Club has performed Songs of the Sea before, but never have they sounded better than they did this Sunday. Soloist Keith Kibler gave his usual fine performance, and the overall effect of the piece was quite thrilling. Particularly in the last song, The Old Superb, the sound achieved by the group was tremendous, completely filling the Memorial Chapel, yet never sounding the least bit forced. The Simmons Chorale sang sacred choruses by thn.:c Romantic masters as their contribution. Laudate Pueri by Mendebsohn. Die Cappale b} Schumann and Brahms' Psalm 13 were all given a good reading. hut unfortunately they seemed a b1t pale in comparison to the Songs of the Sea and the roming performance which they receiH:d. Completing the program were three selections by 17th century 1- nglish com poser 1--1 enry Purcell, which combined the forces ol the tv.o choirs, four soloists, and a small orchestra. r he first ollcring was the Trumpet Sonata in D, which helped to set the mood for the Jubilate Deo in D Major. I his was we II pert ormed and had a prominent role lor countertenor.

MULCAHY the afternoon was Purcell's Come Ye Sons of Art. The glee clubs seemed to sing well together, and the four soloists (Charles Schinkel and Kenneth Fitch; countertenors; Sue Ellen Kuzma, soprano; and Keith Kibler, bass) all sang well, although the countertenors did not reach the incredible level of quality established by the countertenors of the King's Singers in the fall. The performers did well throughout the afternoon, and deserve a lot of credit. The only disappointment was the tiny size of the audience. Once again, Union's over-achiever comm unitv could not spare a few hours away from the books to listen to a fine concert at a bargain price (free). The singers put a lot of effort into the concert. It seems a pity that more students couldn't take the minimal effort of going to listen to it. Jazz Ensemble The Union College Department of the Arts has announced its ,sponsorship of a Jazz Ensemble that will participate in the mid- May concert appearance at Memorial Chapel featuring other musical organizations. This exciting new learning experience, one which ~ long overdue at Union, will be under the direction of Keith Warner, a Berkley College of Music alumnus. Bright Spot in Music The challenging new repeitoir~ has been selected to provide the ensemble members with an experience that will expand their musical knowledge of the Ellington, Buddy Rich, Chuck Mangione idiom through participation in performance as well as discussions about arranging original compositions for the ensemble.
