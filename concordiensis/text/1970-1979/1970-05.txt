But when Larry Sykes statted to speak the screaming stopped. lie said Alan wou:t.d lead us to Boad• ley House and take it over. 'l'he crowd cheered, and a small group of elated students, tbe same stu- dent$ who try to organize. politi- ' cal actior1on campus and are-met with apathy, felt that now the students would Show they have some strength. At Hoadley House, the crowd split ill half; half ~ountEQ ibe steps, and half would venture no further than the :walk. Those on the steps began a round robin of ,POlitical discussion, attempt- . _mg. i,n a short time· to determine goals and strategy. Donny Moran- stein admitted that he was not sure why he was screaming, but he saw this spontaneous out- burst 3$ the defense of an idea:l that be beUeved the country had to live up to.

One group went otf to print up flyers to announce a rally to be held at 10:30. Food was brought and occasional drunks came to argue with the crowd (•Did your father fight in WWil?\ asked one ·alcoholically enlight- ened student.) At 4 A.M. one black freshman shocked the crowd by admitting tbat he trusted nobody, later amending that by saying that he trusted •the new black man. 11 For once 1 there was actually a meaningful dialogue at a Un~on gathering, as whites asked him questions that bad plagu~d them attempting to discern V!hat he wanted the white position to be with regard to the black revolu- tion. MORE .ON P•3 PR\CE TWENTY CENTS Be-In Sparks Demonstration A·gainst ROTC BY NEIL S. KRAMER Balmy springtime weather, an abortive .protest-rally, and the eloquence of a black student all had little effect on the outcome of student government elections yesterday, even thou.gh a write .. in candidate, junior Larry Sykes, was persuaded to stand for election after his effe.ctive oratory }lad sparked a crowd of several hundred students ra:lly~ng at the Alan Gyurko Be-ln Tues- day night. That rally led to an attempted occupation of the headquarters of the Air Force R.O. T.C. detach- ment. About 25 students stayed overnight on tire porch of Hoadley House, R.O. T.C. headquarters, planning to forbid access to the buildi,ng to Air Fo~ce personnel in the morning. Detachment commander Lt. - Col. Richard J. McGee did not a tt e m p t to test the demonstra- tors' will when he arrived about 8:15 Wednesday morning, but Maj. Raymond Terrantella had little difficulty entering the front door of :ij.oadley House to conduct his class at 8:30. \He walked in just like we weren't there,\ said Walter B~t,. a freshman. aild one of tbe students who bad stayed over- night outside of the R.O.T.C. building. Dean of students Edward J. Malloy said that no disciplinary a c t i on was being considered because the pro .. testers had not effectively pre- vented any members of the col- lege community from entering or leaving the building. A mid-morning rally on the Hoadley House ·lawn drew about 150 students, faculty, adminjs- tration, and news media repre- sentativEs. Since Hoadley House is on the side of the 100 acre Union campus, on Nott Street, traffic noise counteracted the magnetic effect of television cameras. After the leaders of the overnight R.O.'i'~C. protest spoke, the rally became a dia- logue between stUitents, whose dil;content range(} from undi.s- gu 1 sed hostility to apathetic euphoria, and the Dean ofscience and engineering, Dr. James D. Palmer. Dr. P a 1m e r elq)lained .that Uolon' s contract with the Air Force was not likely to be renewed because the detachment is not sufficienUy productive of ofiicers to be an economical operation. The topic of dis- cussion then drifted to several recurrtng campus iSsues, includ- ing student repi'ense.nta- tion t hr o u g ho u t the decision- making hierarchy, curriculum changes, and Union's lack of a student union, Nothing was resolved in the confrontation, but student leaders promised further action. A further explanation of the future of R.O. T{ C. was ol,ltained from R. Gordan Bingham, special assistant to the President, later in the day. Mr. Bingham.said that the college tecei ved a letter from R.o. T.C~ headquarters several weeks ago stating that because the MORE ON Po3 . '

PAGE 2 CONCORDIENSIS, MAY 1, 1970 MAKE A STATEMENT Just when it looked like Union's campus activism would take its usual one-day-a-year course, a national issue of the highest order has served to unite Union men in a spontaneous, loud, and adamant voice demanding -an end to what has now become \Nixon's War.\ What happened on the campus and on the streets of Schenectady last night was a genuine outpouring of indignation against a·President who has gone. so far as to disregard the feelings of not only millions of young people but the views of many members of the Congress. His action last night sending American boys into Cambodia is totally outrageous. The time has come for the College Adminis- tration to get rid of the old policy of not takipg a stand on political issues. A stand against this illegal and immoral war should have been taken many years ago. There is certainly no justifi- cation for the college to refuse to speak out any longer& Anyone who hopedthat President Nixon might, however slowly, be ending our monstrous calamity · in Indochina must now realize that many more American men will die before the United States has saved enough face to pull out. Last night, President Nixon added a new dimension to the war, one that all men of good wHl must immedi- ately oppose in the loudest possible terms. Tomorrow morning, President Martin will conduct one of the most important ceremonies of the college year a.s he awards prizes_ to those men who have distinguished themselves at Union. We Ci.tn think D\f no better time or place for the President to issue a strongly-worded· statement condemning this outrageous act. We furthermore urge that, if President Martin does not make such a statement, every recipient of an award either refuse that award or make a personal statement as he acqepts his prize. Most of the men who will receive awards tomorrow will be going to graduate school next year. Many of them will be drafted long before they can finish their studies, and forced to kill other conscriptees nine thousand miles away. This slaughter must end immediately. The- college must take its stand immediately. Published T u e sda. y and Friday during the School year by the Student BGdy of Union College, Schenec• tady, N.Y.

Letters to the Editors To the Editors: May 1 comment on the some- what intemperate editorial on:the proposal of the Honors Com- mittee published in ·your issue of Apri128? It seems to me that there are two points at issue:- (1) Mr. Lieb, as ms letter shows, was seriously concerned about the proposed elimination of the fli.gher grades of Latin Honors except for those recom- mended by their Department, which he thought would be especially ~d on Center II .stu- dents. It is true that in the .past it has been harder for Center II students to obtain Departmental Honors be~ause they have usually had to wrlte their thesis as an overload, w}lereas Center I stu- dents can normally include their thesis in tb,eir regular curricu- lum. candidates for Departmental Honors, in addition to writing a thesiS, etc., had to satis.fy any other requirements their Depart- ments might impose, and this is how the necessity to pass the Comprehensive was introduced in some Departments, This clause has been left out of the pro- .posed regulations, and conse- quently, if they are accepted as they stand, no Department will be able to insist on any extra qualification. I w ou 1 d myself object strongly to the addition of any extra qualification which applied to some student$ and not to others. DAVIPW. REECE Chairman, Honors Committee * * * * KRISE To the Editors: 011 Tuesday night I was ~hocked to witness a horrendous incident, Ui'e invasion of an indivic.iual's rights, A campaign banner advising Union studen.ts to vote for Brother FreeWill(AlGyurko) was set fire to and destroyed by 11n unknown assailant as it hung from the Presidel)tialcandi- date' s window on the fourth :floor of West Coliege.

But a year .ago acbange.was made in the regulations which allows other forms of work to be submitted for Departmental Honors in place of the thesis, and it seems to me that Departments in Center n could with a little ingenuity find ways for their students/ to do work suitable .for submission for Honors without having to do it as an overload. Moreover, students who for any reason do not wish to be candi- dates for Departmental Honors stlll have. distinction open to them in the form of election to Phi Beta Kappa (last year all students who graduated 'Summa' or 'Magna cum laude' were so elected), and this wUl presumably rontinue, whatever happens to the Honors program.

The film con- tinually :O.uctuates between oppressive realism and sur- realistic fantasy. The division · is .n.ot very clear, but the Viewer can senSe the logic that brings the entire film together.

Finally they arm them· selves, and on parents' weekend s t a.g e a revolution. that might have happened. I believe tile revolution is all the heroes' fantasy, but separating the fact from dreams takes more than one viewing. The film is directed by Lind- say Anderson (\This Sporting Life\). His work reflects- the mixture of complete realism and obvious theatricality that mark the work of his two. colleagues, Tony Richardson («Tom Jones,\ '\The Loneliness of a Long Dis• tance Runner\) and Karel Reisz ( 111 M organ,\ \IS a dora\) The thre-e men began together, originally three critics on their own film magazine, and each reflects the style of the others, while retaining his own integrity.

CONCORDIENSIS, MAY l, 1970 PAGE 3 Wal·lace Se·en to Be Los-ing His Grip 1:n Hotly Contested G,overn~r Race EDITORS' NOTE: STEVE PIERCE '71 SPENT THE SPRING VACATION IN ALABAMA AND HAD A FIRSTHAND VIEW OF THE RACE FOR THE DEMO· CRATIC NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR IN THAT STATE. THE PRIMARY WILL BE HELD NEXT TUESDAY. HERE IS MR. PIERCE'S REPORT: The hot race for the Demo- crati<; nomination for governor in Alabama (that is to say the governor's race itself) is shap- ing up as every bit as.interesting on a national as on a. localscll!e. Incumbent Governor Albert Brewer is fighting off the come .. back effort of former Governor and two-time presidential candi- date George Wallace with a sur- prising degree of success. It looks as though the old Wallace magic, a blend of Populist ora- tory and j us t plain rednectqsm, may be a thing of the past. Gov. Brewer, who took office upon the death of Mrs. Lurleen Wallace in May, 1968 1 has . several very potent assets, not the least of which is an excele lent record, At his rallies, he is careful to exude moderation . and a real concern for Alabama; his ~mpaign slogan, •F1lll Time for Alabama\ is an obvious swipe at Wa1lace's national campaigns .for President in 1964 and 1968, ·. which took him out out of the state. Brewer comes off as clean, e~cient and progressive: there is 110 hint of scandal in his past, he has saved the state .mllllons of .dollars in economy moves (e.g., inStitutirlg a cat pool for state-owned vehicles) and he makes virtuaJiy no use of racially-oriented code words, .. Shocket O_n Protest CONTINUED FROM P•1 At 6 A.M. I awoke to 1i,nd . twenty other Union students sit- ting on the porch and staring · into space, Some were willing to give up and come back at 10:30. others felt they had to stay • Sagging spirits were lifted when WGY announced that there were thirty students at \the Union College R.O. T.C. building, vow- ing not to allow anyone to enter the building.\ \Holy shit, who went around vowing?\ Dean Malloy again showed his face and said that everything was fine as }ong.as we allow~ •access and egress.\ Then we tried to decide wJtether- or not to allow it. The group split.; some said that therewasnotenoughsupport. others said blocking th\eentrimce was the only way this would make any sense. The entrance was finally blocked by a group of students who sat on the back steps. •wm you let us enter?\ •No .. \ While most of the R.O. T.C. men wil.ited outside the back door, ·the front door was open and someone entered that way. The protesters ran to the front door, leavtilg the back door free. For .some reason, the cadets then ran to the front door, probably not to miss the action. If that 'is what they lea.rn in their .strategy books, no wonder we are losing in VietNam, Cam~ bodia, Laos, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, etc. There must be some good mili- tary material in the R. 0, T. C, program, however, for eventually they found the back qoor and entered, single file, 11 Too bad yqu guys didn't keep us out, I could have played ~If, hahaha..~ 11 Hahahahal ... smug son-of-a- bitch.\ The Brewer rally is a thing .of beauty, if that can be said of an event so political in nature. The timing, the warm•up and the .speecli: itself ar.e planned· With meticulousness; the microphones work, the band is good and the speech is well-timed and delivered in measuredtones. The references to Wallilce are few but unmistakable. Brewer dis- lllisses Wallace's oratory with: •The cow that moos the loudest doesn't always give the most milk.\ Folksy it may be, but the point is made, The Wallace campaign, fi.Qa.nced to some extent by the funds raised in the presidential campaign two years ago, is also in high gear, but the empbasis is c 1 e ;:t r l.y different. W h il e Brewer runs bard on his gub~r­ natorial .record, Wallace (though of course pointing out hl.s and his w1~ 1 s combined total of five years in MontgQmery) seems to take more pride in his achieve- ments as a spokesman for the· •forgotten millions\. He points to the statements of tbe Nixon administration on school integra- tion and to the political s~eches Of Vice President AgQew as evi- . · dences of Wallace's iilfluence on the political flavor of Republican Washington. The Wallace line on Brewer is that he is a candidate of the Northern interests, implying of course that Brewer is a turn- coat. The usual pitch at nearly every rally and in radio ads bas Wallace peeking u.nder an imaginar,Y sheet as he enu- ne rates some of the '\strange political bed,.f e llo w s\ that he claims ate baunti.p.g Alabama. Among others, he invariably spots \.a me m be r ofthe Presi- dent's c a b in e t~ (Postmaster Winton Blount, a native of Ala- bama) and elements ofthestate Democ1·atic party with whom he has been feuding, The appeal is one for sympathy which he gets partly because tne charge is at least partially true. The ~tional implications for the Republican PI,U'.ty arethese: if Wallace shoUld lose, he is virtually eliminated as a serious contender for President in 1972, a poss~bUity With obvious attrac- t.i v e ness for President Nixon • Should Wall ace win, he is restored to national prominence and his next campaign is under- way, On the other hand, Brewer as Governor represents no threat to the Republicans. In fact, he is of real benefit to them becaw:;e of his potential as a Wallace- killer; hence the charge of \Republican money 11 in Alabama this spring. The primary next Tuesday coulc:J foretell a great deal, not only for Alabama but for the nation as well. The possibility of a runoff is presentsinceseveral other candidates are in the race; yet the ultimate winner Will be either Wallace or Brewer. This test of Wallace gut.appecal ver- sus the record of Governor Brewer is indeed a showdown; what is more, there are some very interested third parties.

Hank J .. ambert, Union's starter~ was chased in the fourth inning by the hot RPI bats, while relief men Kevin Coyne, Dale LOng, and Bob M it che U proved equally ineffective. The Garnet 1 s r e c o.r d slumped to 2-2 as a result ·of the loss. The• Dutchmen began the season with .a somewhat inexperienced pitching staff, but Coach Art Lawrence felt confident that the s t a f f 1 anchored by veterans Larry :Berkeley andCoyne. could do the job. .promising :freshman John Siedlecki also developed a bad arm during the Garnet 1 s road trip to New Je:r:sey two weeks ago, , Lawrence has converted short- stop Long to the moundand moved freshman Bob Mitchell in from second base to bolster his sta:ff. The pair, who both pitched in high school, joins Coyne and frosh Lambert to form the 11 new-look\ Garnet mound corps. Lambert had pitched in one other game this season, a five- inning relief outing against Drew, in which he allowed two runs. He was not as sharp on Tuesday 1 however, as RPI roughed him up for two runs in the top of the first inning. The Garnet pushed across a run in their halfofthe third inning to slice RPI's lead to 2-1. Oen,. ter'fielder John Quirk reached' on an error, sWiped second and thi-rd,, and raced home on tbird:. baseman Ken P·e arc e' s two- bagger to left. The Dutchmen stran,d.ed Pearce, however, when Long and first ·-baseman Mike McGee grounded out. The Engineers chased ;Lambert in the fourth stanza, tallying three mote times.

After Siedlecki popped to short (!enter, catcher Rick Arons r.eacbed on an error and Goyne lashed a line- drive single. to left. Quirk, how- ever, looke·d at three called strikes to em,i .the rally. seven.th and eighth ipnings, Mitcnell fini.sned up the Union pitching chores. Tbe Garnet put together a futile rally in ·tbeir last two at-bats, scoring three times ~n i:Jle eighth and twice ill. the ninth to cut the final margin to a more respec- table 12.:7, The Dutchmen finished with eight hits for the · afternoon.

Stills, Nashand - Yomtg to th€ · Jefterson Airplane. They have played together :for a year and have recently been playing at colleges in and around BOston, flag pol~ at the base · of the park and prepared tolower the Ameri- can flag flying there. Shouts of \Leave it, leave it!\ and angry · gestures convinced the students to stand down from the :flag . pole. clubs. The group then sat down and blocked the main road into the complex for about 45 minutes wb1le they listened to speakers advocate various plans for tur- ther action. In Kent Students' Memo · r , ~ '!;he crowd then recited the pledge ot allegiance a,IJd cheered as lt continued down State Street. The marchers changed their chant to •we don't want Nixon's war\ as they moved' down State Street, changing their language spontaneously both bec~use.many people were eyeing them harshly and because they wanted to heap contumely on Mr. Nixon. Attempts to rouse support from the students atSchenectadyCom- m.unity College were notably unsuccessful. No more than 50 sec students joined the Union mar · cher.s 1 although the throng shouted • Join us,\ and •It's your war too.\ Olily slightly dispirited by the cool response of the sec stu- dellts, the marchers moved on to the General Electric Company. The giant industrial complexwas chosen as a target by the stu- dent coordinating committee Thursday night because •oE is the second largest Defense De- partment contr'actor. We have no gripe with the workers,\ a spokesman said, \but witll the stockholders and managers Wh() make profits from the murder of Asians.\ _ The marchers proceede<l to the main ga'te of the complex, whicit was locked and guarded by ~ dozen Schenectady pi)lice, some · of whom were armed with billie COMMENT Around 11 a.m. the group, led by the counsel of Father James Murphy, left the G. E. complex and heaged back up Erie Boule- vard to the Schenectady Selective Service System offices on Wall Street. One student attempted · to enter the b.uil ding througl1 a s e con d-floor Window and was seized by police. He was released moments later after the crowd chanted, \Let him go,lethimgo.\ After a, half hour of speeches and discu - ssions, . the group returned to the inte1section • of State Street and Erie Boulevard, where the crowd sat down and blocked traftic for more than an hour. Buckets of drinking water and sandwiches were transpor~ed from the coUege campus to the crowci by SAGA Foods. The crowd then grew restless, and soon broke into different factions. Most of the marchers decided to return to the campus, but one group of about 100 stu- dents marched back to the G. E. complex. At one point they broke through a cordon with billie policemen equipped with billie clubs, but no ar:rests were made. The group entered f,he complex and milled around indecisively until police ~d various group leaders were able to persuade them to return to the college campus. At 1:15 p.m. only a dozen or so protesters were still present on tQe complex grounds. After voting to strongly endorse today's activities pro- t e s tin g the war, the Student Senate last night urged the flying of the flag at half-mast for one month in memory of the four Kent State students killed pro- testing the war yesterday. The Senate also voted to endorse Prof. Ed Fox for Congress and to table the proposed student tax increase. On a motion by Aaron Fein- gold, the Senate decided that the time had come for somebody on campus to take a stand, It was decided that when . troops shoot st1,1dents Union students can no longer afford to remain silent, and as a first step the Senate endorsed a clear peace candidate against a clear hawk. The motion endorsing Fox was carried over- whelmingly. It was decided, after a tie breaking vote by President Wal- ter Spence~, ~t theSocialCom- mittee should not rece~ve all:the money collected if the student tax is increased. It was then proposed that the Social Com- mittee should receive the amount agreed upon after consultation with the Tax Committee. But Nixon Shatters Springtime Calm BY MIKE MESEROLE It's amazing what the 1970's see as normal after what went on in the 60 1 s. Then the bottom fell out. Thursday night ushered in the specter of 1964 and the visage of an American President widening the infamous Southeast Asian War. In a move that was hailed as \courageous\ in one corner and •madne ss\ in the other, Richard Nixon committed United States troops into Cambodia on a super search and destroy mission against Communist •sanc- tuaries.\ Less than two days later, u.s. bombs started falling on North Vietnam again. The Pentagon called it defense; Bismarck would have, too. So much for spring. Union, as on caJ;npuses across tlle country, woke from its comfortable coma MORE ON P•3 A week ago things seemed s10 pleasant. College life had set- tled into its annual, lazy, spring- ti me rut here at Union an!Ci throughout the country in general. The growing grass had given ill to the stretched out hulks of tile sun- w or s h'i p e r s, the chronic complainers of the winter months were busy cursing the 80 degree heatwave, and schoolroom coll- centration was diverted to follow- ing . the trajectory of winging kites; in short, all was well . And why 110t? Things were generally pretty cool.

Spencer, who had eonsull(:)d at some length with Dean James P a 1 m e .r, . outlined llie current status of ROTC and lis probable future at Union. \Since the con- tract with ROTC was m:ade at the request of Union in 1~~2, ii can only be broken by mutual agree- ment with the Air Force, »'~pencer said, It is generally thought that the program will be discontinued in June 1971 and that by this June the program ,.,ill no longer be housed in Hoadley House. It was also indicated by Palmer~ according to Spencer, t:ruJ.t the school does not receive any money from the Air For·ce for the use of its quarters. In recognition o:f his exeellent service as P:r~sid eQt ofthe Senate, Don Kessler was awarded its hearty thanks. The Sellate also voted to send a letter to the Schenectady GaZette praising the res t r a in t of - the Schenectady Il()lice during the (lemonstrations of the past few days. A co~y . of the letter will be sent to Chief of Police Murphy. In c u r r i cu 1 :a r actions, the Senate voted to re-examine the question of an hooors system. The ide a of do i mg :avray with required times and Jl)aces for final exams will also be exam- ined, a 1 on g with ellmination of the requirement that all cours~s in Center I must have a final exam. It was also recom- mended that the numller of stu- dent members. on the Curricula!;' Affairs Committee be inereased from two to four~ so that each division will be re)lres-ented.

PAGE 2 CONCORIHENSIS, MAY 5, 1970 SHORT NOTES With three: days of classes canceled. in this week and last, ·the CAC' s proposal to eliminate classes on Jur~e 5 seems ludicrous. In the fall, the All-College Council approved the new proposal that split th~ first day of exams over the whole weekend in tbe spring term. This is far better than the old system, where many men had two exams the -v:ery day afte;r the end of classes. The CAG contends that Sunday exams :r;night be offensive. to many. Yet over one-quarter of the Union student body is Jewish, and these students have had to put up with Saturday exams for years. We doubt that many students would be offended; if any faculty were, pe.rhaps ·exams could be schEduled on another day for them. We can see no real reason for calling off yet another day of class this term. Already many courses have lost a fu:ll week of instruction. We woul<l like to add our ·.voice to those congratt!llating the Schenectady police on their outstanding job Thursday and Friday during the marches do~tow:n. The police conducted them ... selves with decorum and kept a respectful dis- ta~ce from th.o€ detnon.:.trators. There was never any confrontation between the marchers and the police. Instead, there was a continuing informal cooperation. Chicago has much to learn from Schenectady. We heartily concur with the Student Senate's endorsement of Prof. Edward Fox in the Demo- cratic Primm:-y against Rep. Samuel Stratton. The latter is on& of the few Democratic hawks in Congress, a.:nd sbould be opposed in the strong- est possible 'Nay. Prof. Fox represents the forces of peace and reconciliation that are so vital to the future <>f our nation. He deserves the active support of e-very Union man. We likewise agree with the Senate that the fl~g should fly at half-staff for one month in memory of the four Kent State students killed by the Natil);1la1 Guard yesterday. Their blood casts an evem deeper pall over a nation that is already gr.ea..tly saddened and frustrated by the actions in S()uth.east Asia. We at Union must join in mou::rning for these four innocent students shot down while exercising their constitutional rights of assembly.

MLiberate Union Colleg~~-is a .phrase that has been passed around from .mouth to mouth .at dear old U, Col. fQr the pa$t few weeks.-;perhaps stated with fervor only during t11e last few days.

The COil• clustons should now ;be obvious to alL If tbis Whole experience is a joke, and for the most part it is, let us not make tbe most ·of it in any way, from any view .point. The system is no longer run·by men. U is steered by. the tnexor~ able logic of tradition a.nd prece· dent;, by ·words and .phrases now familiar to President--watchers Uke «honor\' Mcommitments~ \190 years of history without a defeat, 01 or \I will not be the first American President to lose a war.\ We are ail subjects of this system. We can 119 longer affect our destiny. The past has pre- programmed tb,e future. The system: must be reviSed, reformed, chan~ed, altere~, and replaced if necessary. This will not be e as y, this will not be quick, but ultimately men must regain control of th~ interlocking matrix of ideas, structures and procedures, in a word, the way of doing things in thiscountrywhicll. is the framework for individua.l choice and group behavior, U:nfortunately, this e~creed\ is heavily laden with many symbol$ .rn!Ked with many causes, created and uncontrolled by many emo- tions. The c~use of all this, if it can be singled out, is frus- tration. Ad mir atio n for Mr. Gyurko for his willingness to do something is as illogic.al as his cause of •·llberatio~\ One bas the feeling that the iQea of •doing s o .met M n g\ to revolutionize. cha!lge or at least ameJiorate our present situation· has been inappropriately .and stupidly mis- pla<:ed with the idea of doing anything. Not only should the basic question: MWhat are you doiilg this for?\ be posed to Mr. Qyurko, but strangely enough the question •What are you doing?\\ must il.lso ·be. asked. If we mufi>t liberate, and indeed there is a consensus aroundthe campus that we must liberate, what and from what are :we liberating? If we should liberate the Rathskeper, West College, or .the Frats, as has been proposed by :Mr. Gyu11ko, whom are we liberating and from what'? More importantly, why? In this struggle, the univerp sity wUl be the final sanctuary,, n.ot for forays ·that wUl invite repression, but for critical sys• tematic, sustained anaLysis of the web of assumptions, maJly- Long for g ott en, which legiti- matize, rationalize, and under- grid the s y s t e m• Until the~ll~ historical, metaphysical, logical, and empirical foundations ar~ uncovered and exposed to inten- sive examination, the system will · remain invulnerable to meaning- ful reform, change, or replace- ment. Critical thought must pre- cede !l. c t ion, Action without thought will lead only to frus- tration, cooptation, or re- pression. Perhaps I am dealing with this too concretely, and everybody on campus (or at least :Mr. Gyurko) knows wbat, from wlla.tp aJ!d why, and isn't telling anybody because it's obvious, and besides it's all tied up with •the system.\ If Mr. Gyurko cannot substan• tiate his .stand better, perhaps it would bt:! best if he should be slapped twice on the hands, and told that what he is doing is a no-no, and that's tbat, unfortunately, everybody can- not or rather should not laugh at Mr. Gyurko. Perllaps he is a joke, but spme of tbe •<;ause:;\ he bas said, or h;lve been con- ll e ct e d with him; are deeply meaningful to many here on cam• pus.

What happene<I from that :fateful Thursday .night on ~rough ~e weekend makes for one of the most interesting installments in this college 1 S 175-year history, The group that. spontaneously marched out of Union's gates and right through the center of a bewildered downtown Schen- ectady that night was a rally- seasoned gathering. After all, hadn't. Brother AlGyurko whippe4 them into Shape at his tLast stand Be-In' two nights before? This was no joke, however. The mar.ch itself wasn't a big deal, other thanithappened,•whichwas a big deal. ~t was an expression of frustration by men (18 years ole· makes you a man) who might have to eventually ma!te good on the pOlitics of W3$hington and simply were not happy about it, Fri(\ay was more directed; · doWn to G.E,, then to the Draft Board; then over to State and Erie. The bulJ.norns were there, the people and traffic were there, and most impottant of all, the TV cameras were there. Friday was commercial as compar'ed to the genuineness of Thursday. The students whO marched tllat night were .together; a little confused at wnat Nixon had done and what it meant, but secure in the crowd. No dema~gues, no calculated confrontation, just a united con- cern tJJ,at maybe the White House was chasing those •ultimate vic• tory\ dreams again, The highlights of the two marches, in their obviousness, would have to be: 1) the flawless work of the Schenectady Police Department, and 2). the insistence of the marchers that the Ameri- can flag 119t ~e touched. The police were s t r 1 ct 1 y professional in their handling of the marchers and the tr~:ffic, a.il.d there was a feeling tiUlt the crowd was proud to be associated with the officers and vice versa. Thursday Iiigbt the police even made their car loudspea}ters avaUable to the hoarse march leaders. As for tne :nag, while one or two over-zealous revolu- tionaries made overtures to lower the banne:r to at least half mast, the crowd demanded that it be left up. The country is biggel\ than any .one. m3.!1, even ifheruns it.

PAGE 4 CONCORDIEHSIS, MAY S,ltoncordy Sports Mitchell. Spins 5·-Hitter But Diamondme·n Fall, 1-0 Lax Takes Road Pair BY BILL HOLLERAN Freshman Bob Mitchell turned in an outstanding pitching per- formance for the Garnet on Friday afternoon at Clarkson, but he. was victimized by the only extra-base hit he allowed in suffering a heartbreaking 1-0 loss to the Golden Horde. Mitchell went the distance for the Garnet, the first c~mplete game for Union's mound staff this spring» but he was touched up for a triple by Clarkson's Hank Miller in the last of thft first inning. After Mlller scored moments later on a sacrifice fly, Mitchell went the rest of the way and scattered four hits in the process. Although Coach Art Lawrence finally got tl).e good pitching he has been looking for this season, he was probably disturbed that Union's normally active oats went into hibernation over the weeltend. The Dutchmen had scored· 34 runs in four games on an identical number of hits, bUt could only solve Clarkson pitching for three singles on Friday. Only one Garnet baserunner could get as far as second base. Last season the Golden Horde shackled Union's hitters, defeating the Garnet and ace left-hander Bill Neidel in 11 innings, 2-1. The Dutchmen finally tightened up defensively after three lacke luster games in the field. The Garnet handled every fielding chance perfectly on Friday after committing 14 errors in their contests with RPI, Stevens, and Drew. Once again ·.this spring the Dutchmen had no luck with the elements in their contest with St. Lawrence, as Saturday's Garnet ... Larrie game was postponed for the second straight year because of rain. Already this spring three games have been curtailed due to the bad weather. Lawrence started Mitchell against Albany State this afternoon, as the Dutchmen looked to improve their sub-par 2-3 record. The mentor asked Mitchell if he was ready to start with only three days rest, and the frosh reportedly replied that he was ~raring to go. 11 ~~~';'>'t3~'t_·R·.P.l.

SCHENECTADY, NEW YORK, _MAY 8, 1970 PA:CE TWENTY CENTS Union's Week: BY PETER J. WEINGOLD The general faculty yester- day decided to alter course re- quirements for the rest of the term in response to overwhelm.,. ing s'f<pdent sentiment in ~vor .of the opportunitY to work actively :for peace. At. meetings early to- day the faculty worked out the details of hOw students are to be graded for this term and what course tequireJ;llents are. to be. The final form of options approved by the faculty appears on this page~ Classes resumed on a regular schedule this morn- ing. The d_ecision by the Faculty followed more than a week of be.- in's, rallies, seminars, and protests which pegan last week with the Alan Gyurko-led happeningr thought by most of those involved to be completely apblitical. After the Nixon announcement to send troops into Cambodia, Thursday night, however the mood of the campus turned decidedly more serious and res~ted in the natioilally cov:ered burning o:f Nixon in effi~, and the protest march throl}gh downtown Schen- ectady to General Electric and the local Draft Board. A hastily organized rally Fri- day morning r~vealed the tone of the school w be more :revolu- tionary tJ1an even the most opti- misti·c radicals wouid have dreamed pissible as late as last Wedne$day. President Martin, appealing to the students not to leave the campus nor to do any- thing which might antagonize the community, was disturbed by the students' militancy. After some brtef rhetoric,. the participants in tll1;1 rally almost unani~ously ignored :the request of Dr. Martin, and some 500 of them began to march to the local symbol;; of the milit:arymindus- trial complex: for the:second time in only twelve hours. On the way to the General El e ct r i c plant the marchers attempted to enlist the active support of students from the SchE:mectady Community College, located in the former Van Cur- ler Hote1, but only fifty of the newly opened two year college's students opted to join the Union contingent. The students marched to the Selective Service office and then staged a brief .sit-in during the lunch hour of many local workers in the middle of State Street, after attempting to meet with a representative of G, E. but being informed none was available. A few harsh words hurled at the police were met with a com- bination of stoicism and be- wilderment, a reaction for which they were highly praised later by leaders of t11e march and the college administration. Tlie marchers returned to the College after the sit•in, and the r(;lst of the :weekend was. relatively calm. At the Prize Day ·cere- monies on Saturday, several hundred parents were prevailed upon to s i g n a letter to the :j?reside!lt of the United States protesting> his actions, ~fter .a brief speech by Simon Burrow requesting this action. On Monday, the .ad hoc-steering committee of the Union Stri~e Committee met with Dr. Martin at 2 p.m. and requested the can- cellation of classes for the next Faculty Council Approves New Meets, Comp Eds The Faculty Council approved a~ large group of new courses at its meeting Tuesday after- noon. It also took action on changes in requirements for Dean's List .and postponed action on the Honors program and the Black Alliance grievances. These matters will be taken up at the · CouncU' s next meeting. In addition to many new Comp Ed courses, the Council approved courses for Civil Engineering, Sociology, Economics, Industrial AdministratiQn, His to r y, and Classics. Included in this latter ... group were courses in •Urban Economics, 11 *The P e Q p l e of America,, and a two-term senior sequence in classics designed to lead to the thesis. Among the new options in Cen- ter I to be offered next year are: a course entitled •The New Revolutionaries: Blacks, Women and Studentsr which .wm also be available to Sociology. majors for credit.

Also approved We1•e opt i ·n •Playwriting 11 anti w ·.r1a.tive Writing.\ An option studying a Religions of the World\ wili also be offered. Two new Center II options were approved, They are entitled \Sex and Sexualityn and \Evolution and Man.\ A large m~mber of new junior year projects were also given tne go~ahead, They include studies of •Modern Diagnostic Techniques in Medicine,'~ 14 E:Xperime·ntal Education in the United States,\ \The Poli t lcs of Dissent in American Hi~her Education,\ and •Politics of Education,\ A course in •Feasibility Studies for the Proposed Sea-Levellntelloceanic Canal of Central America\ will examine this controversial issue from economic, political, social, and ecologicll.} viewpoints. The Council approved a change in the Dean's List designation, Earlier this term, the Faculty Counf'i~ eli~ninated the Dean's L~st as it now stands and replaced it with a yea.rly designation. To be eligible 1or this hOnor, a stu- dent must maintain an index of 3.00 for the year. He must be a rull-time st\ldent throughout the year and must haveatleast seven courses included in his academic index, The stqdent may have no grades of D or F.

The faculty eliminated that re- striction at Tuesday's meeting, Anatomy Of Concern Phil Galdston presenting his pr·oposal at Wednesday's all- college meeting. d:ay in order to allow students to involve themselves in protest a;diVities, and especially activi- ties to protest the deaths of the four Kent State Students. Dr. Martin said that any cancellation \really ought to have some. faculty Olpirtion in it.\ Because it was too late to call a .general faculty meeting, the department chairmen were called together .to consider the student request. While a crowd of stu ... dents in Silliman Hall were deciding what actions to fake,. it Vias a~ounced that the faculty had decided to call o:ff clas·ses for the next day with the ·hope that -\meaningful alternate activitiesli -wouldbe plaiUled. Tuesday's activities began with an unexpectedly large crowd o:f over six hundred students and faculty mempers gathering in the lecture halls of the social sciences and humanities build- ings to participate in seminars discussing the war, the draft and means of protest. At an o u td o or rally which followed , there Wl:!.S a moment of silent meditation in memory o:f the four Kent State students, m or e speeches decrying the horrors of the vla:r and a plea by Prof. Sharlet •not to destroy the sanctuary of the UI)iversi ty,\ and to be careful not to provoke any conftontation which might lead to the calling of troops onto the <:~ro.pus. Simon Burrow, a Vietnam veteran and one of the leaders of the protests, said in closing that •marches are fun, but canvass- ing is work. I don't want to see anyone marching who isn't wi.Uing to canvass.\ The response that afternoon to Burrows plea was overwhelming as almost three quarters of the morning's crowd turned. out to canvass the community for signatures on the McGovern-Hadfield bill to cut off f'l.!nds for the war, ·At a Tuesday evening meeting in the Chapel attended by more than nine hundred students It :Pecame apparent that the huge canvassirtg turnout was not an accident. The tenor of the meet- ing was one which demanded the opportunity :for students to get into the community to get public opinion turned against the war, or to participate in more severe forms of protest, • Harris Nagler, one of the can .. vassers, declared that •It is ineffective to canvass, and. when you do people are still antagonis- tic to the prates ts. What we need is sensationalistic actions to bring attention to our cause; you can't chang~ a cal(#iedmind without it. Itm not condoning destruction, but . a sit-in that rea 11 y means · something and causes people to pay attention. 11 In respanse to a criticism that •People are afraid we•re going to attack them,\ Nagler said, \The people we're interested in are the S e r at o r s, industrialists, and Congress men.\ A temperate, moderate pro- Pos a 1 that \We must talk to people, get into the community, but this takes time, for which a r a di c.a 1 alteration in class- course schedules must be worked out,\ was met with widespread approval and formed the basis of a proposal given to President Martin directly after the meeting by Phil Galdston and other mem- bers o:f the. steering committee. Just before the meeting adjourned, Steve Glanzrock announced a plan to collect draft cards from students acro1')s the country and to band them all in at once. At the time this issue went to press over 150 draft cards had been collected at Union and the action bad drawn-national coverage. A plea made for money to send public opinion telegrams to the White House resulted in the send- ing of 120 cables p:rotesting the war after $108 were collected. At the meeting with Pres.ident Martin Tuesday evening Gald- ston proposed that 1br tne rest of the term classes iJe -held but tllat st~dents have the right to 4eteri:llj.ne how- they want to be ·graded- (Pass-:fa:il, incomplete, withdraw). Dr. Martin said that he had no right to undertake such action by lrlmself but that he favored the holding of an all- college meeting the following afternoon. He added that \The faculty is the heart of the col- lege and that's where my com- mitment lies. I believe it's the constitutional, contractual, and historical right of the :faculty to call off classes.\ He agreed that the outcome of any decision should result in students having the opportunity\ to work out with their individual professors how they were to be graded, but the exact means of such a proposal must be worked out ·by tne faculty. An all college meeting at 1~:30 Wednesday afternoon was attended by over thirteen hundred students and fac~lty members eager to decide the course the college would take :for the rest of the term. The o u t come of the sur- prisingly qUiet, orderly meet- ing was a decision to hold a student referendum on pro- posals to close the school, keep the status quo, or adopt the so- called \G a 1 d s ton proposal,, essentially the same proposal discussed with the president the night before. The referendum resulted in an unprecedented turnout, with over thirteen hundred. students voting. The Ga}dston plloposal was favored by a margin of four to one over the proposal to close . the school, which in turn was favored by apout two to one over the proposal to keep classes go .. ing normally. The faculty council and general faculty met yesterday and today With student representatives and were reportedly •very im- pressed\ at the student turnout and vote. The fa.cult)T of Union College, mindful that such recent events as the expanded war in Indochina and the shooting of students at Kent State and other repressive measures are having a widespread impact on the academic community of this country, and sharing. the concern of their students about these events, consider a •business as usual\ attitude toward learning on this campus as unrealistic and inappropriate. We therefore resolve that all students be given the opportunity to choose among several courses of academic .action :for the remainder of the term. Students who wish to avail themselves of any of the following options will make appropriate arrange- ments. A student may withdraw from any class at any time before the final examination with grade W upon written notification to the Registrar. A grade of imcomplete (I) may be agreed upon by the student and the instructor, with wrltteil notification to the Registrar. The course shOuld normally be completed within twelve months or at the end of the term 'm which the course is next scheduled, whichever is the later. Variations from this pattern are to be approved by the appropriate Center Dean.* The student may choose to recei've a grade for any course on a pass-fail basis upon written notification to the Registrar before the final examination. A st11dent upon withdrawal fro~ a course may enroll l before the end of the seventh week for Comp. Ed. 90 to ta1re one full-course credit under supervision of an instructor. (Comp. Ed, 90 is an Independent study course.) This course may be counted either as an elective or as a Comp. Ed. option in Center L The course work must be completed by the end of the :first term 1970N'71. At any time by agreement between student and instructor a student may complete a course and receive a grade. If an instructor,. hi. his own conscience, cannot gi:ve this grade 1 he should determine what work the student must perform in order to receive a grade. Appropriate work may be assigned in lieu of the final examination. Academic regulations in conflict with the above options are to be superseded for the third term 1969-'70. NOTE: Conflicts arising under the above .legislation may be resolved by the appropriate Center Dean. *A separate bulletin to make clear the reqUirements for status as full-time student in relation to Selective Service will follow this announcement immediately. /

PAGE 2 ,CONCORDIENSIS, MAY 8, 1970 Letters to the Editors • , I L To the Editors: I would like to commend the Curricular Affairs Committee for their wise and considered decision against the scheduling of Spring term exams on Sun- day. At the same time, ~ take strong ·exception to the incon- siderate and insensitive position on this matter expressed in a CONCORDIENSIS ediforial (May 5, 1970) which labelled theCAC's decision \ludicrous.\ The college has traditionally felt 1t wise not to hold final exams or any other college activity that wolild require student participa- tion on Sunday. I suspect this policy is based on a reluctance to force students, no matter how few, to compromise either their faith and consciences or their college careers for no .better reason than experience or con- venience. The CAC is rightfully sensitive to this issue; the editors of CONCORDIENSIS apparently are not, Union College is an interde- nominational institution. It does not require nor even encourage students' adherence to any par- ticular faith, as would be the case were exams to be scheduled on Sunday. Whether classes should be cancelled on June 5, is, for me, a separate matter. If some stu- dents feel the present policy of Saturday exams is offensive to their faith, this policy should also be re-examined. But I hope that the faculty council will uphold the CAC's decision and students whose faith requires will not be placed in the very difficult position that would arise were Sunday exams scheduled. I know there are other students who feel as I do. Sunday exam s are neither necessary nor justified, but if, unfortunately, they are adopted, appropriate arrangements must be m ad e to accomodate those unable to take them. RICHARD E. PATTERSON JR.

The war is clearly Nixon's now, and nobody really knows what he is going to do with it. The more it goes on the less sense it makes, It's bad for the economy, national morale and life ill general. The Tet Offensive brought America to its senses and sent an American President into retirement in 1968, because it exposed the war for the failure that it was, Cambodia was a failure before lt ever started, and no matter how many guns, pounds of rice, or votes are captured by it, it will not be worth the death and dissension it has caused at home • Think back .twoyears to Febru- ary, 1968, .and the 'ret Offensive. Immediately following the blood- bath, t1te TiMES carried .a front page ,photograph of the Saigon chief of police executing ~ cap- tured Viet Cong in the middle of the str:eet. As .far removed as these inci- dents are, together they are of notable sigtlificance. In both cir• cum$tances, the war (formerly in Vietnam,· now in Indochina) had gotten out ?f control. In 1968, the VC proved they could literally strike atwill, ccinfusingthe.AUied .forces afid resulting in wholesale butchery throughout South Viet- nam. Back home, ·the American public finallyrealized the futility of the war. In 1970, the NiXon .Administra- tion prc:>ved that it could move ' ·just about .any way it wa>n.ted to on, the war, even escalate it, no matter what anyone thought. The ensuing Cambodian adventure caught the , country off guard and provoked death on the American college campus. The reaction didn't trigger the «futile\ feeling as much as a discomforting sen• sation that maybe the System doesn't respond after all. Since tile President took office over a year ago, .he has proveQ a cautious and politically moti- vated leader. He has stirred public controversy with, various moves, but up to now he has made no real mistakes. Cambodia co1.J].d be the P r e s i d e n t' s first big mistake. Regardless of whether the offensive pro v.e s militarily successful-and how successful can it be if the .Allies move only 18 miles across tJl,e border-the dissension that has arisen ih this country because of the move makes it a failure. But it's a fa,ilure· that Nixon seems to invite. In \bringing us together,\ he is driving a wedge between us. The President seems to see the countcy in terms of an electorate rather than people. He courts the south, because he needs it for re-election; and he unleashes Spiro Agnew on the \university elitists,\ because he doesn't heed them and knows he couldn't get them anyway, The protesting call e ge kids are \bums\, but G, Harold Carswell is d e em e d suitable for the Supreme Court because he is mediocre. .Anybody who knows Richard Nixon knows that he is all poli- tician.

The walk by Middlebury was only one of eleven free passes served up by Panther Long in the last of the fourth,. scoring twice, and added another tally in the fifth to pull to within one, 8-7.

Armstrong, president .of Middlebury College, speaking for the new aca lemic-athletic organization, said, '··· The group will be called the ~\lew England Small College Athletic Con- ference, and will be P.Omposed of the original \Little Three\- Amherst, Wesleyan; an· Williams,-along with Bates, Bowdoin, Colby, Hamilton, Middlebury, Trinity, Tufts, and Union.\ Although Athletic .Uirector George Flood commented yesterday that Union has been included in the two-year discussions concerning the formation of the new league, he admitted that no decision bas been made as yet bv the college concerning Union's entry into the circuit. According to Flood, considerable discussion remains with the faculty, the Athleb..: Committee, an1 President Harold c. Martin before an announcement will be made by the college's Sports Information Office. However, .Flood did not by any means rule out the possibility that Union will join the neVI conference. Flood cited eas~ of scheduling, similar philosophies concerning athletics, and similar athletic programs as •plusses\ in the discussion about the new con+ renee. \Except for the Maine schools,~ Flood commented, \all the schools are with rJ. easy traveling distance. Even Bates, Colby, and Bowdoin are not as difficult to reach as Alfred or St. Lawrence.\ Concerning the athletic philosophies of the schools, Flood revealed, \Their academic requirements are similar to ours, and nobody goes hog-wild on recruiting.n • Flood expressed a concern, however, that perhaps Union would not be able to play on the same level as the other members of the new league. \We don't want to enter the league if we feel we're going to lose in all sports,\ he said. After a moment's refelction, though, Flood added, \I feel that we can stay with the majority of the schools-we won't be out- classed.\ Although Union may not be able to compete successfully in the league for a while, at least the Garnet will not be faced with the situation they confronted while a member of the ICAC, a six-team league in which some schools did not play football, others did not wrestle, and others did not play hockey. In the proposed New England Small College Athletic Confer- ence, Flood reports, a -larger number of schools play a more homogenous schedule of sports, except for scattered variations in ice hockey, squash racquets, and crew. Even if Union joined the new conference, Flood admitted, the Dutchmen would not play league members until 1971 or 1972 at the earliest, and in such major sports as football, lacrosse, and baseball, the Garnet probably would not meet members of the circuit until at least 1973. Even by that time, Flood comments, \We still wouldn't be playing everybody. We want to continue to maintain our long- standing rivalries with Hobart, RJ?I, Rochester, and Hamilton (a league member), and we will stay in the New York State Track and Swimming championships.\ whacked a a-run double in the . third inning to give Union a 3-0 lead. The Danes broke up Mitchell's . shutout bid in their half of the :fifth, when pitcher NickAscienzo . li.fted a sacrifice. fly to score a teammate from third base.

Student Body Meets To Hear Strike News BY PETER BICKERMAN An estimated 900 students meeting at the chapel last uight to discuss community ac:ti·on listened to conflicting views·con- cerning tactics from an Albany State S.D,S. member and psycho- logy Professor Clwe- Graves. Following Phil Galdst on 1 s announcement of a rally at the Capitol steps tomorrow at noon, the State student spoke of adem- onstration planned for this morn- ing. The demonstration would involve blocking all entranees to the Federal Building, thus closing down many federal.services in the area. Furthermore, he said that due to a desire for pnity within the anti-war movement, the organizers of today's rally have not insisted upon complete non- violence; calling for self-defense, the speal~er said tb.at, in the event of attack, all demonstrators should be prepared to \take care of themselves, w Professox Graves enumerated the various· philosophies which attempt to explain man'sappa.rent. depravity. 1Us personal belief is that man's problems are caused by a bas.rc tack of understanding of his nature. The professor linked thesE abstractions with the realities pres en.tly facing the peace movement, and urged the audience to \co()l it\ in an attempt to avoid c<>nfronting people with a culture or style which is totally alien to .tneir own level of exis- tence. Grave:; suggested, for example, that Middle America could accept tile individual who dresses like a WASP and criticizes the President, or one who dresses like a student and does not engage in political issues, but not a combination of the two. lie told the students that \You are the vanguard,\ but asked them to eschew certain tactics (such as viol~mce) which would be ill~timed and counterproduc- tive. The assembly then heard Craig Leigh, a member of the Black Alliance, describe the origins and· goals of the Black Panther Party. In Leigh'S words, the U'.S. Government is \attempting to systematically annihilate\ the Panthers. A workshop on this topic will be held Thursday at 3:30 p.m. in SS 016. The meeting continued with brief comments by Skip Mowry and Terry McManus. Mowry, representing UNDO, an organi- zation aimed at paralyzing the Selective Service System through the massive returning of draft cards, discussed the current activities of that organization. McManus spoke about the many departments of the Communici,l- tions Committee and the desperate need for volunteers to keep communications activities going. The mood of the crowd was clearly split along chronological lines, with the older demonstra- tors regarding the action as. a '\body count\ and the younger marchers seeing it as a call to further constructive action Bailey Hall and Library Closed -Following Rumor of · Hidden Bombs Finally, the general meeting adjourned, and all committees involved in strike activities met with those students interested in participating. Day-long Seminar Will Be Held On Birth Ills against the war. As one unidentified college stu- dent put it, \We're through listening to middle <;:lass liberal rhetoric\. Whether he meant that he favored bombing the White House or canvassing downtown D.C. wasn't immediately appar~ ertt, What was apparent, how- ever, was that the tenor of the crowd was decidedly mol!e serious and less picnic-oriented than in previous demonstrations. . It was the first ral.ly where all the speakers exhorted the crowd to, as Dave Dellinger put it, •go back into the community 'llhd carry on the strike action.\ Dellinger, one of the Chicago seven, spoke at the close of the rally and said that it ·\was no time for fun and games or a picilic on the lawn, but a time to energize.\ He added inreference to NiXon's pri;!SS conference last Friday that \We are not here as a safety valve, but to gather a head of steam.''

Dr. Willard Roth, chairman of tbe biology department, was in- formed early Friday afternoon by Prof. Carl George, also ofthe biology department, of a planned attempt to •firebomb or in some other way damage\ the biology ap.d chemistry buildings Friday night. Dr. Roth said that Prot George bad ·learned of the plans from several of his students who, he said, were •very reliable.\ The students had been at Albany State during the day and ~d heard of the plans there, although they were not certain if the planned attacks were to be carried out by students at the State Univer- sity. After being warned, Dr. Roth called Mr. John Kleinkauf, director of security, and told him of the rumor. Kleinkauf then ordered the stationing of several extra Pinkerton guards around the campus, especially between the bioiogy and chemistry build- ings. The biology building was closed early Friday evening, flammable materials in the storeroom were moved into an inner office and the. staff was sent home. Dr •. Roth s~yed iil the ~uild­ ing until early. Saturday morn- ing, but p.eithel' he nor the guards outside reported any suspicious activities. Although several cat- loads of students were seen to drive past the buildings early Saturd~orning, it was likely that they were on their way to Washington, and i.n,any case they did no.thing .~ut drive past. Dr. Edwin K. Tolan, Dl.rector of Schaffer Library, said that he learned quite casually that there might be additional attacks on the library, from Mr. Klein .. kauf who had assumed that he had heard, and asked him what action he was taking, After being informed of the situation Tolan closed the library early Friday evening in O>rder to protect the two part-time women who would otherwise have had to be there alone, and because he \dLdn't want the library open with police llanging around, unless students would be severely in- c on v e n.i en c e d by its being closed.\ A call to Union Strike Central by Mr. Kleinkauf revealed that no other- Ul).ion students knew of tile plans, and a call to Albany Strike Headquarters revealed that they too were ignorant of any attacks planned at Union. College Bids $40,000 For library Building The college has bid :$40,000 for the old Schenectady County Library property at Union Street and Seward Place in a. public auction conducted by County Pur- chasing Agent Theodore Picazio. The county board is expected to approve PicaZio' s recommen- dation for acceptance of the bid at its regular meeting tonight. purposes, When the City of Schenectady was looking for a new library site in 1894, the Fre.e :puplic Lib r a r y of Schenectady was formed~ It was about 1900 that Union offered a portion of land on the southeast corner of the \collegE pasture\ and it was deeded to the library board. Constructicm of the 1 i bra r y began in November, 1901 andwas completed in June, 1903. A day-long seminar on the medical and social aspects of birth defects will be held here Saturday. Co-sponsored by the college and the National March of Dimes Foundation, the program is aimed at educating students about the causes, the problems and the progress in the field of birth defects . Chairman of the conference is Twitty J, Styles, associate pro- fessor of biology at Union. Working with Dr, Styles on the program are Lois Hallenbeck, professor of biology at Skid- more College, Mrs. Elmer Terrell, secretary of the Southern Adirondack chapter o:f the March of Dimes Foundation and Andrew Lask and Robert Krauss, students at Union. .Also working on the program are Mrs. Robert M. Long, Alvord Clements, Mrs. Erwin Siwek and Mark Conte, all Nati~nal March of Dimes· Foundation represen- tatives. The college first e&:pressed interest in acquiringtheproperty eight years ago when county officials began to plan for a new library. Four montl:lsago, Presi- dent Martin said that the college planned to incorporate the build- ing into Union's academic com- plex. Gabrielson and Johnson Named ~for ETH Year The two-story brick and stone building has not been used as a library since the courrty moved into its new library building on Liberty Street a ·year ago last March. The old library has since been used as a storage center for the County Mental Health Board and the Scheneetady Nar~ cotics Guidance Council, Union was in a go()d position to bid on the property inasmuch as zoning restrictions limited the old library's use to educational Uni<m undergraduates Christo- pher D.

It is not important if it is a minority or not-there is nothing in history like a revolutionary movement oi majorities. Even the Russian Revolution was initiated and carried out not by the oppressed working class, but by a bunch of intellectuals.

GREENE ''73 * * * * ~; Presi·dent Martln Re.l;eases Me:morand·um To Students The remaining weeks of the spring term will pose certain difficulties for all of us, and I therefore take this means of going over a few matters so that everyone will know 'how thing stand. (1) CLASSES. By action o:f the Faculty on Friday, May s, a series .of options is opened for students who feel ·th,ey must give all or part of their time to direct work for .peace. The Registrar has available in Room 2 of 'the Administration Building the forms by which students ma.y make their .choices ltnown so that his ·office will have a clear record of every variance from the usual regis- tration patterns. It is the responsibility of the student, not of faculty members, to see to it that the forms, properly filled out, are returned to the same room. N.I;!. The Comprehensive. Education 90 option is open only until Friday of this wee~ (May 15). In other respects, classes will continue as scheduled. (2) BUILDING SECURITY. As generally happens in a situation of this kind, we have had various anonymous tweats about building occupations, fires, and the like. Over the past weekend we put on extra Pinkerton guards and had our own security men take twelve .. hour watches. The danger, if there is real danger, prObably comes mainly from outside,. but we cannotafford·tota.ke risks. It is possible that as other colleges complete the tertn (as most do a couple of weeks ahead of us) students from them will come to Union .to join the war-protest activity, Obviously th~s compomids our difficulties, and I therefore ask that you all do your best to discourage visitors. No one stands to gain from th~ kind of disorder that might well accompany such increase in numbers in our already heavily taxed facilities, The Coilege Grou11ds are private property to which access may legally be restricted, but the best way to control the situation is ,obviously to have general agreement among people here that we don 1 t need outsiders to help us do our job.

GREENE '73 * * * * To the Editors: There is considerable mis- understanding in regard to the territory of Cambodia invaded by allied troops. This is territory which has been occupied by North Vietnamese and Vietcong troops for at least fifteen years. It is separate from the populated parts (main territory) of Cambodia , and practically all its Cambodian inhabitants have left or been driven out. This set-up was ideal for the North Vietnamese, for sending raiders across the border. Having accomplished their mission they slipped back into Cambodia, sometimes chased by allied troops who halted at the border. C o n d i t i o n s changed w h e n P r in c e Sihanouk was deposed, The new rulers demanded the withdrawal of the North Viet- namese forces from Cambodia. Hanoi's answer was the dispatch of Vietcong troops to attack Cam- bodian towns and block roads to the sea. These developments presented the allied commanders with an excellent opportunity to attack the North Vietnamese in Cambodia terminate the harassment o~ South Vietnam from there, and to restore the occupied enclaves to Cambodian control. Ifsti'ccessful, the operation may speed up the withdrawal of U.S. forces from southeast Asia, and might even shorten the war. I believe that this is why President Nixon gave permission for the operation. WALTER W. LEWIS, Emeritus Professor of Elertncal Engineering President Ma:rtiin Releases Memorandum To Students The remaining weeks of the spring term will pose certain difficulties for all of us, and I therefore take this means of going over a few matters so that everyone will know how thing stand. . (1) CLASSES. By action of the Faculty on Friday, May 8, a senes of options is opened for students who feel they must give all or part of their time to direct work for peace. The Registrar has available in Room 2 of the Administration Building the forms by Which students may make their choices known so that his office will have a clear record of every variance from the usual regis- tration patterns. It is the responsibility of the student, not of faculty members, to see to it that the forms, properly filled out, are returned to the same room. N.B. The Comprehensive Education 90 option is open only until Friday of this week (May 15). In other respects, classes will continue as scheduled. (2) BUILDING SECURITY. As generally happens in a situation of this kind, we have had various anonymous threats about building occupations, fires, and the like. Over the past weekend we put on extra Pinkerton guards and had our own security men take twelve- hour watches. The danger, if there is real danger, probably comes mainly from outside, but we cannot afford to take risks, It is possible that as other colleges complete the term (as most do a couple of weeks ahead of us) students from them will come to Union to join the war-protest activity. Obviously this compounds our difficulties, and I therefore ask that you all do your best to discourage visitors. No one stands to gain from the kind of disorder that might well accompany such increase in numbers in our already heavily taxed facilities. The College Grounds are private property to which access may legally be restricted, but the best way to control the situation is obviously to have general agreement among people here that we don't need outsiders to help us do our job. (3) THE FALL ELECTION SITUATION. As many of you know a few colleges and universitieshaveannouncedplansto recess before the fall election day (November 3) so that students can campaign for candidates. I shall tal<e to General Faculty meeting this week and send to the Student Senate alternative proposals for discussion: (1) to begin a week early, recess for ten days througll November 3 and end the fall term on or about December 18 rather than Decembe; 11; (2) to put on the pre-registration list this month a course in the electoral process which would make it possible fo:r those inter- ested in campaigning to develop a solid program of study and action for course credit in the fall term. Other proposals may appear, but these two should be sufficient to give a basis for discussion. . (4). T~E DRAFT-CARD MOVEMENT. Clearly the College as an mstltutwn must dissociate itself from illegal activity and from the encouragement to illegal activity. Just as clearly it must protect those who wish to speak and act as a matter of conscience concerning the draft. It is important that all who concern themselves with this movement inform themselves of the penalties following successful prosecution (fines, imprisonment, loss of voting privileges, and so on). Those who are still draft-eligible should also be aware that they may be subject to arrest if they are apprehended on some other charge and do not have their draft cards in their possession. I understand that the collected draft cards have been impounded and may be recovered by any who, on reflection regrethaving surrendered theirs last week. ' (5_) QUIET. I ask particularly that those who are spending much of their time on the protest be considerate of those who have other work to do and of those who are bed-patients on the second floor of Silliman Hall. The general attitude of students, staff, and faculty during the past week of turmoil was most admirable, and in due time the effect of it will be as important as almost anything else in convincing the public that our concern about the war and other issues is serious and not a matter of springtime fun and games. I have assured the Trustees that the Union community is intact and is likely to remain so. May 11, 1970 HAROLD C.

PAGE 4 CONCO.RDIENS!S, MAY C~ncordy Sports Nine Extends Skein Laxmen :O·,efeat Trinity, Winning Season Clinched BY BILL HOLLERAN The surging Garnet baseball team recorded its fourth straight t r i u m p h yesterday afternoon, routing Williams in a makeup game, 9-2, behind Bob Mitchell's second complete game ofthesea- son and a robust nine-hit attack. The W i 11 i a m s contest w as originally scheduled three weeks ago, but the two teams were rained out. Mitchell once again was superb on the mound, scattering nine hits en route to Union's third straight complete game. In an amazing showofpitchingstrengtb and durability after numerous early season woes, Garnet hurlers have notched route-going performances in four of their last five starts. Coach Art Lawrence is under- standably pleased at the sudden turnabout of Union's baseball fortunes. Commenting last night, the mentor said, \I'm very pleased and somewhat surprised at. the way the team has gelled.\ Pitching was not the only prob- lem the Dutchmen hadtoover- come ~earlier this spring, although the mound situation was desperate with both veteran Larry Berkeley and frosh John Siedlecki sidelined because of arm difficulties. In one span several weeks ago, Union's leaky defense committed 14 error-s in three games, but since then the fielding has improved im- mensely. The Dutchmen were also having difficulty in puttine; good hitting and good p1tching together. In the1r contest with HPJ two weeks ago, the Garnet scored seven runs and pounded ~PI pitching for eight bits in lo·sing 12~7. Against Cla;rkson ten days aga 7 Mitchell held Clarkson to five hits in a complete game pel':'formance but lost a heartbreaker, 1-0. Ken Pearce once again was the batting star for the Garnet in yesterday's contest, bombing a two-run double ,in the third inning to lead a three .. run Union up- rising. Dale Long followed the clutch-hitting third .basemans two-bagger with a run-scoring single to cap the rally. The Gar net also bunched three runs together in the fourth, tal:lying on a double by Mike McGee, four consecutive walks, and a fielder's choice. Williams' hurlers did not enjoy an out- standing afternoon, passing a total of 11 Garnet batters. A three-run rally in the eighth inning of Friday's game at Nor- wich made a winner of starting pitcher Kevin Coyne, who allowed only four hits in the 3-1 triumph. The win gave the Dutchmen a svreep o.f their Ver- mont road trip, The Garnet had beaten Middle- bury on Thursday, 9-7, behind Dale Long's first complete game of the season. After the . Cadets head pushed across a solo run in the sixth inning, Bob Bernhardt led off the eighth with a base hit. Mitchell, playing second base, followed with a walk, and· John Quirk sacrificed to move the r u n n e r s up. P e a r c e then delivered a two-run single, advanced to second on a wild throw, and scored on a base- hit by Long. Frosh Lacrosse Rally Tops , Colgate In Final Moments In a contest played last Wed- nesday, the freshmen lacrosse team r a 11 i e d from a fourth q u a r t e r three -goal de fie it to score a stunning 4-3 triumph over Colgate's yearlings. The victory upped the yearlings' record to a healthy 3-2 mark. The teams battled on even terms throughout the first three stanzas, and stood deadlocked at 0-0 at the start of the final period. The Red Raiders, how- ever, broke up the scoreless tie Parly in the fourth quarter, blitzing the Dutchmen frosh with three qurck tallies. Bill K;remens started Union's comeback with a goal midway through the period, and Mike Hogan pulled the Ga<net to within 4·2, pouncing on a loose ball in front of tne Raider cage and slapping it into the nets. After Mark Dyer put in Union's third tally, Ken Giacco notched the game-winner with less thana minute remaining in the contest, while the Garnet were operating with a man advantage. The yearlings' next encounter will be at Middlebury tomorrow afternoon. STEREO SOUND COMPLETE OFFERING FOR THE SOUND CONSCIOUS STUDENT. SYSTEMS DISCOUNTS, ALL MAJOR COMPONENTS. Special: Tues. & Wed.

After tomorrow's contest, the batsmen have but three games remaining and need only a single victory down the stretch to clinch a winning season, the prospects for which seemed considerably dimmer only one week ago, This weekend the Garnet host a pair of contests. The nine takes on ano\Uler old rival, Hobart, in a Friday afternoon game. Last year's encounter was rained out, but the Dutchmen lead the series, which goes back to 1882, by 29-17. Saturday afternoon, the Mariners ofKings Point will in- vade as the Garnet try to repeat last s e a.s on's convincing 6-1 triumph. The Dutchmen have won all t h r e e games p~ayed since 1965. Rugb!J Club Beaten, 31-0 Union's Rugby Club clashed with the ruggers of MIT over the weekend in an opening round contest of the first annual New England Rugby Tournament; a 23-team tourney hosted by the University of Massachusetts on Saturday and Sunday. The Garnet, however, found them s e 1 ve s woefully short- changed in both size and ability and could do little to stop MIT from coasting to an easy 31-0 triumph. MIT sewed up the con- test by rolling to a 20-0 halftime lead. The loss was the third straight of the spring for the frustrated Garnet ruggers, and the sixth defeat in seven games this year. Only a 6-6 tie with the Univer- sity of Vermont's Rugby Club last fall has kept the Garnet from being seven game losers. This Saturday's upcoming con- test with Dartmouth has been cancelled because of the rapidly s pre adi ng nationwide student strike, but the ruggers willagain be in action in two weeks when t\ey host the Schenectady Rugby lb.

PAGE 4 CONCORDIENSIS, MAY 12, 1970 Concordy Sports Nine Extends Skein Laxmen Defeat Tri,nity, Winning Season Clinched BY BILL HOLLERAN The surging Garnet baseball team recorded its fourth straight triumph yesterday afternoon, routing Williams in a makeup game, 9-2, behind Bob Mitchell's second complete game ofthe sea- son and a r\>bust nine-hit attack. The W i 11 i am s contest w as originally scheduled three weeks ago, but the two teams were rained out. Mitchell once again was superb on the mound, scattering nine hits en ro11te to Union's third straight complete game. In an amazing sh~w of pitching strength and durability after numerous early season woes, Garnet hurlers have notched route-going performances in four of their last five stuts. Coach Art Lawrence is under- standably pleased at the sudden turnabout of Union's baseball fortunes. Commenting last night, the mentor said, \I'm very pleased and somewhat surprised at the way the team has gelled.\ Pitching was not the only prob- lem the Dutchmen had to over- come, earlier this spring, although the mound situation was de s p e r at e with both veteran Larry Berkeley and :frosh John Siedlecki sidelined because of arm difficulties, In one span several weeks ago, Union's leaky defense committed 14 errors in three games, but since thea the fieldiug has improved im- mensely. The Dutchmen were also having difficulty in puttine; good hitting and good pitching together. In the1r contest with RPI two week.s ago, the Garnet scored seven runs . ' . and pounded RPI pitching for eight hits in losing 12-7. Against Clarkson ten days ago, Mitchell held Clarkson to five hits in a complete game performance but lost a heartbreaker, 1-0. Ken Pearce once again was the batting star for the Garnet in yesterday's contest, bombing a two-run double .in the third inning to 1 e ad a three-ruu Union up- rising. Dale Long followed the clutch-hitting third base mans two-bagger with a run-scoring single to cap the rally. The Garnet also bunched three runs together in the fourth, tallying on a double by Mike McGee, four consecutive walks, and a fielder's choice. Williams' hurlers did not enjoy an out- standing afternoon, passing a total of 11 Garnet batters. A three-run rally in the eighth inning of Friday's game at Nor- wich made a winner of starting pitcher Kevin Coyne, who allowed only four hits in the 3-1 triumph. The win gave the Dutchmen a sweep of their Ver- mont road trip. The Garnet had beaten Middle- bury on Thursday, 9-7, behind Dale Long's first complete game of the season. After the Cadets had pushed across a solo run in the sixth inning, Bob Bernhardt led off the e i g h t h with a b a s e hit, Mitchell, playing second base, followed with a walk, and·· John Quirk sacrificed to move the r u nne r s up. Pear c e then de 1 i v ere d a two-run single, advanced to second on a wild throw, and scored on a base- hit by Long. .'

The victory upped the yearlings' record to a healthy 3-2 mark. The teams battled on even terms throughout the first three stanzas, and stood deadlocked at 0-0 at the start of the final period. Tile Red Raiders, how- ever, broke up the scoreless tie E>arly in tile fourth quarter, blitzing the- Dutchmen frosh with three quick tallies. Bill Kremens started Union's comebacl< with a goal midway through the period, and Mike Hogan pulled the Garnet to within 4-2, pouncing on a loose ball in front of the Raider cage and slapping it into the nets. After Mark Dyer put in Union's third tally, Ken Giacco notched the game-winner with less than a minute remaining in the contest, while the Garnet were operating with a man advantage, The yearlings' next encounter will be at Middlebury tomorrow afternoon.

Coyne got the starting nod for today's contest from Coach Lawrence. The Hamilton series began in 1869, one year after competition started with R.PI. The Garnet, who beat Hamilton 2-0 a year ago behind Bill Neidel, hold a 82 .. 33 bulge in the series. After tomorrow's contest, the batsmen have but three games remaining and need only a single victory down the stretch to clinch a winning season, the prospects for which seemed considerably dimmer only one week ago. This weekend the Garnet host a pair of contests, The nine takes on another old rival, Hobart, in a Friday afternoon game. Last year's encounter was rained out, but the Dutchmen lead the series, which goes back to 1882, by 29-17. Saturday afternoon, the Mariners of Kings Point will in- vade as the Garnet try to repeat last seas on's convincing 6-1 triumph. The Dutchmen havewon all three games p~ayed since 1965. Rugby Club Beaten, 31-0 Union's Rugby Club clashed with the rugger's of MIT over the weekend in an opening round contest of the first annual New England Rugby Tournament, a 23-team tourney hosted by the University of Massachusetts on Saturday and Sunday. The Garnet, however, found themselves woefully short- changed in both size and ability and could do little to stop MIT from coasting to an easy 31-0 triumph, MIT sewed up the con- test by rolling to a 20-0 halftime lead, The loss was the thirdstraight of the spring for the frustrated Garnet ruggers, and the sixth defeat in seven games this year. Only a 6-6 tie with the Univer- sity of Vermont's Rugby Club last fall has kept the Garnet from being seven game losers.

The victors sealed the win by outscoring the Bantams 4-1 in the second half. The two teams fought to a 3-3 standoff after the first period of play. The Garnet connected three times more in the second stanza and held a scant 6-5 halftime lead.

The current 7-2 mark assures a winning year, The Garnet scored twice while holding the home team scoreless over the :fifteen minute span. Union has shown strength in the third period all season, tallying 23 times while holding all opponents to .a total of nine goals. Union added two scores in the last period to one for Trinity to provide the eventual margin of victory, Bruce Dugan and Norm Stavin scored two goals apiece for Union, Dugan is now second in goals scored behind Mark Sanderson, Ed Green played a fine game in the nets, turning aside 18 Trinity shots.

Since it was felt that a letter on behalf of \The Faculty of Union College\ would have to be .signed by every professor, afld· this would be impossible for ir:Jeo- logica'/ reasons, the following let- ter was circulated so that .those opposed to certain administration policies could still make tlieir collective voice heard. * * * * We, the undersigned memi:Jers of the .faculty and administration of Union College, acting in our role as citizens concerned about tl:! e fate of the nation and its academic institutions, share ·the deep sense of outrage felt. by millions of American students, .faculty members and admini'Stra- ·tors at the present directiol\l of American foreig!'l and domestic pdlicy. We deplore the words and deeds of the national admini stra- tion that have of .late increased the scope of violence at home and abroad, divided citizen from citi- zen, and made damaging inr<Jads into ihe civil liberties of all. This statement is being sent to the Pfesident of the United States and all members of Con- gress to inform them of our <:on- cern and of our intent to s.u~port candidates pledged to put a stop to these destructive and divisive policies. Dear Students: The college must make a <leci- sion very soon concerning what is going to be done about nex:t year's calendar. It has been proposed that the college begin classes a vveek earlier in September. r-ecess on tile 25th of October to take a ten day vacation so that stu.:lents who want to devote full time to the closing days of the political campaign can do so and then recon- vene and go three or four days later than usual in December. Others have proposed that .a one term junior project be offered on the Electoral Process for two course credits.

A third proposal is that a Camp. Ed. option in Center One be offered for one course credit. This would also deal with the electoral process. As part of the course a student would leave cam- pus for ten days before the elec- tions to work for the candidate of his choice. The student's Camp. Ed. professor would help him work out any problems that arose with his other professors. It is impor- tant to note that no one .of these options precludes the others. 'In order to obtain a sampling of student opinion I conducted a polling of the Student Senate by paper ballot last night. The results of that poll will go the faculty. The Faculty Council will meet Tuesday at 4:30 to make a decision on this issue. The reason that the decision must be made in such haste is that the Comp. Eds. must be planned so that students can pre-register for next year. I would have preferred to obtain a broader sampling of student opinion on this matter of general interest. Consequently I will be in my room, 102 South, .from 8 to 10 Sunday evening and 10 to mid- night Monday evening to discuss the matter with interested stu- dents. Feel free to come and see me, or call me at 374-7004. I will be more than happy to · dis- cuss the matter with you. WALTER A. SPENCER Student Senate President To the Editors: There have been suggestions of late by some members of the senior class to cancel Class Day activities on graduation weekend, to forego the wearing of caps and gowns, and to donate the money that would be otherWise spent to the strike fund. If these sugges- tions are accepted, we believe that the campus movement will stand to lose much more than 'it can possibly gain. All of us must realize that graduation activities include not only the members of this year's graduating class but our parents, the alumni and the trustees as well.

Orenstein, '70 ·Students Turn From Protest To O:ttinger The aAtj-war sentiment that is currently sweeping across col- lege and university campuses has manifested itself in several forms. In the tri-city area particularly, students have become political, seemingly overnight.

While many students have taken to the streEts, an increasing num- ber have chosen to give the \sys- tem\ another chance to respond, and are working for political can- didates wfto represent their views. Some stu<lents are orgamzmg groups to write letters and sent telegrams to tneir Representatives and Sena.tors expressing their opposition to .the war in. Southeas Asia. Ot11ers are canvassing throughoutthe tri-cities in hope of gathering support for the various anti-war proposals currently pend- ing in Congress. me carlelldate who seems to have attractedthe most widespread student support is Congressman Richard L. Ottinger (D-N.Y,), who is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the lJ .S. Senate seat now held by Republican Charles Goodell. On any given morning a group oi15 to 20 students can be found working at the Albany- Schenectady Ottinger Headquar- ters at 723 State Street in down- town, Sche11ectady. For the majority of these stu- dent volur~teers, the Ottinger cam- paign is tnei r first political experi- ence. Whi ie S()i'ne campaigned for McCarthy in tf1e 1968 Presidential campaign, most remained apolitical until President Nixon's April 30th announcement that he was sending American troops ihto Cambodia. One Ottinger volunteer, Union jumior Fre<l lax, who campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1968, said that he felt, \The Cambodian an- nouncement was unconsdonable,\ and that nis only recourse was to \work for a candidate who opposed any escalation of the war.\ Several volunteers such as Ron AinesandNarc Allinson, twoUnioi!t ' .freshmen, tl:;!side outside of New By Lance Falducciwitz The American dream ·rarely holds up upon inspection, but it is the base upon which many people ·guide their lives. When the Ameri.· can dream proves hopeless to those who believe in it, there is little to live for. In a brutal:, horri- fyingly realistic manner, \Th.ey Shoot Horses, Don't They?\ illu- strates this theme by employing a dance marathon of the early '30's. The misery of the depression brought a need for the miser.alYie to view people who were more miserable than themselves. The dance marathons Would go on for months, and the participants' mis- ery was enjoyed by the spectators. the more misery, the greater the crowd's .fun. The film is perhaps the most uncompromisingly pessimistic mo- vie I have ever seen. Even \The Pawnbroker,'' a film that pro- duced a similar. depression, ended on a small note of hopefulness. \Tiley Shoot Horses, Don~t They?\ recommends putting people vio- lently out of their misery. It would be easier to dismiss the film's message if the film itself was not so well done. The acting, by Jane Fonda,. Susannah York, and Gig Young, is un<::om- fortably convincing. Michael Sar- razin's is the only .performance that was not well defined. When trying to evoke a mood, Sydney Pollack's direction is bril~ liant. An example of a beautiful blend of the camera's abilities and the actor's qualities are evi- denced in the first track meet.

Mary ]o BoW· man; a Skidmore senior, stated, \If Nixon's announcement can be said to have had one good effect as far as students are concerned, it's that of once again bringing a large number of young people back into the mainstream of poli- tics, something we haven't really done since the McCarthy campaigl'l in 1966':\ 1 'Fm glad you asked me that question. The patriotic Americans of Local 57 marched on those gatherings last week because we · were fed up and .fearful.\ Fed up with the Indochina War .and fearftd that U.S. intervention into Cambodia was an escalation of that war~ ''Hell, no! Fed ·UP with those queer, Commie; long-haired creeps always crying for peace and mess- ing with the flag, and fearful that this may be our last chance to bash their pinko skulls in ·if most of the U .5. troops leave Asia in the nextyear.'' · Sir, could you tell us a little bit about Middle America's Defense against No-good~ Elitist, Subver- sive Sissies? \J.'d be more than proud to. When these scum of the earth, Red sympathizers started bawling about Vietnam a few years ago, us middle class people figured the country was strong enough to ignore'm. Obviously, in the last few weeks, it looks like the USA ain't as strong as we thought. The country needs protection, so here we are.\ Why do you think that the coun- try needs protection from college kids? it's simply one-on-one, patriot vs. Commie, either the 'Fontinato Faggot .Fiattel')er' or the 'Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow' can be used mast effectively. The 'Flat- tener,' named after ex~Ranger great Lou 1 Fontinato, is comprised of grabbing a long\haired fag, pull- ing his shirt up over his head rendering him defer~seless, then busting up his ribs; 'Hair Today' is an easier maneuver, all you do is put the grabs on a weirdo's bushy, sissy locks and then reel'im .in tci meet your fist or hard hat.\ are~~~~::~ctics are pretty rough, \Rough? Wait 'til you see what we got planned for when U.S. troops move into :Laos and Thailand.\ The official stand of Local 57, and one I would guess that is held by all constfuction unions, is one of solid support behind the Presi- dent's .handling of the war, correct? \Right on, er ... correct.\ Well then, what if Congress threw open the draft to all middle.: agecl American males? I mean, why fight the insidious Commie War Machine with worthless faggots who don't want to fight? Imagine turning loose the \Fighting 57th\ on the Viet Cong! Think of it, instead of watching the war on the Cron- kite Show, you and your boys could be fighting and dying in Vietnam, Cambodia ... \Whadayou some kind of wise guy 'l Hey Dick, Mitch, Mario, Adolph, I got a smart ass bum ave~ here that needs some educatin'.\ By Ray Krise, Jr. There was another rally in Albany today, 'but it wasn't for us. It was for the construction workers, a group of people who could not be a m0re perfect antithesis of the peace movement if they :had been designed by AI Capp. If you're expecting me to start ranking on the construction workers, I fear I must disappoiRt you. ·It would be as easy to satirize them as it would be to satirize us, but that is because both we and the con- struction workers are on the ex- treme (albeit opposite) edges of human exsistence at its present state. Now, I· could go into a 'long rap. about how construction workers are human beings and deserve to be accorded the dignity due all mem- bers of our species, but if you haven't dug that by now, I'm not going to be able to convince you here, But a second point I do want to make is how badly the con· struction workers can hurt our movement right now. They are on the verge of creat- ing a movement of their own. They have already fulfilled two of the prerequisites .for that occurrence: 1) they have identified themselves as members ·of a large, distinct group, and 2) they have a common goal-at the moment it is merely beating in kids' heads, and that is bad enough, but should they ful· fill the final necessity-if they find a leader (and it will have to be somebody from their own ranks; they'll think .Spiro is a nice guy, but he won't fit the role)-then we could face a counter-movement from a group just as dedicatedi and sometimes crazy, as our- selves. That we can do without. We need everybody we can get to be on our side. So ho.w do we do that with construction workers ... ? The first suggestion that comes to mind ·is that summer is coiT!ing and there are going to be those of us who will 'be working with guys like this on summer jobs. There's our foot in the door, right there. We will have to earn their respect by doing exactly the same kind of work they do, by working hard and sweating and getting biisters and telling filthy jokes and going out for beers after work. In a word, we will infiltrate them, become their friends, and then-and only then-start to gently slip into the conversations the .peace point of view. This way is not easy, it requires a great deal of self-control and an equal amount of physical strength. But the job pays well, and it is quite possibly the only chance we have. For the rest ot us, who will not be working construction this sum- mer, there is not too much we can do. We must be gentle with the construction workers; to taunt them is no more fair than for a young child to tease a puppy. The kid's gonna get bitten, and so are we. Abbie Hoffman once said, \Any act of violence against a violent society is an act of love,\ but I doubt if old Abbie's dealt with many construction workers. Peace. Not all• of the volunteers we[e attracted to Ottinger because of his views on the Vietnam conflict. Several were first introduced to him during the Earth Day activi- ties last April 22nd, when Ottinger, a long-time foe of environmental pollution, converted his Washing- ton office into an environmental communications network for all the colleges in New York State. \Look friend, don't be stupid, the big boys in Moscow and Pe.- king are calling the shots, they've p'lanted radical professors and stu- dents in the colleges-it's all .part of the International Com111ie Con- spiracy. What they've done to the boys is bad enough, but the girls! Loose living, no bras, and **** !'

Marty Weis- berg, a sqphomore Classics major at Union, summed up many students~ views, saying, \After McCarthy lost, people told us not to give up hope, that this was our first effort, and that in a sense we were successful even though Mc- <:;arthy lost .. If this. happens again and candidates like Ottinger lose this year; I don't know how much' longer we'll be able to keep work-• ~ng w_i_thin the present system.\ \First of all, we don't look on ahy fracas as a 'beating,' we're doing these punks a favor.

Major elements to be studied include: a general survey of classic Rabbinic Judaism examining ideo- logical differences between tl:te Pharisees, the Sadducees, Essenes and Sectarians: foundation of reli- gious belief as revealed in Sacred Scripture; the idea of God as re- flected in Talmudic literature; con- cepts of man, sin, atonement; con- cepts of retribution, the hereafter, and messianic expectations; Ortho- dox judaism as reaction; Conser- vative judaism and reconstruction; Zionist ideals and Israel.

Eventually it is hoped to sched- ule a series of four Hebrew lan- · guage courses covering beginning, intermediate, and advanced lan- guage work. Oral as well as written proficiency would be stressed in the program. Finally, a term abroad in Israel is also planned. There has been initial progress in setting. up the program, how- ever, the final structure of the term abroad would depend upon the desires of participating stu- dents. These possibilities may be util- ized by any student in pursuing his interest in Hebrew and his interest in Hebrew and/or\ jud- aism, and he may very well incor- pQrate this proposed program into some kind of Middle Eastern Studies major. However, most of the program is in the planning stage and so far only the course in \Varieties of jewish Belief\ will be given in the winter term .1970-1971, Pre-registration in this course is strongly encouraged to ensure institution of the rest of the pro- gram.

PAGE 4 CONCORDIENSIS, MAY C~ncordy Sports tax Falls To Cortland By Mark Shugoll A highly regarded power from Cortland State was held to a draw for sixty minutes by an underdog Union College lacrosse team, but ellploded for five goals in the e'ght minutes of overtime to .finally defeat the stubborn Garnet, 10-5, in a game played Tuesday at Daley field. The Dragons ran their record to 7-2 with the win. Their onl¥ losses were at the hands of power- It:~! Hobart 12-9, and to the Ivy League leaders Cornell, 8-6. Union is now 7-3. Cortland looked as though they might blow Union off the field at the outset by thoroughly dominating the opening minutes of play. How- ever, Cortland could r;Jot find the goal, firing shot after shot wide of the net. Then at 8:26 Mark 'Sanderson shocked the crowd by knocking home a Doug Duval pass and giving the Garnet a 1-0 lead over the heavily favored intruders. Sander- son tallied four of 'Union's ·five goals. The Staters gained the lead on the strength of two goals within a minute, as Ken McEwan and Dave Wahrum scored. Sanderson, how- ever, evened matters with his second score with 1:58 to go in the period. The Garnet managed a goal lead as Sanderson again found the range seconds into the second period, and then opened the mar- gin to 4-2 when Barry Gross took a pass from Tom Sleckman all. alone and beat Cortland goalie Peter Roy. Twenty seconds later, Gross was stopped by Roy in an identical one on one situation. Sanderson ended the half's scoring with three minutes left as he was again set up by Duval. Union goalie EdGreen, who was superlative all afternoon, was for- ced from the game with 26 seconds left in the first session when he apparently caught a stray stick in the face. Green walked off the field under his own power and re- turned to the lineup after twelve minutes of the second period. His replacement, Bob Erland- son, also played outstanding in goal as he shut out the Dragons during . his thirteen minute stint. The second half was a different ball game as Cortland held Union scoreless while managing three goals to tie the score. Don Hallen- back made it a 5-3 game with ·a score less than two minutes into the third period. The Dragons got the equalizer with 1:51 to play in the period, forty seconds after tallyi.l'lg their fourth goal. · The fourth period was score- less. Cmtland ·dominated most of session with ·Green making some fine saves to keep the score de&d- locked. With one minute remain- ing and ·the ball in Cortland's possession, the visitors called time out in the hopes of setting up om: last play. Twenty seconds remained when Green was apparently beaten, but the ball hit off the post and rolled into the corner as the gun fired. Cortland finally found the range in overtime, scoring five goals. Gary Schriber finally got the tie breaking goal with 2:26 to play in the first of two four minute over- time periods. Cortland went on to score twice more in the first extrCI session and twice in the secoml. Final totals showed the Garnet outshot 59-30. Defensemen Pup Gould and Ed Young kept the Cortland offense at bay in regulation time, playing typically fine games. Both con- stantly broke up rushes with their stick checking. Green wound up with 24 saves and :Erlandson three for Union. Roy of Cortland finished with thir- teen stops. Union closes out its home sea- son tomorrow, hosting arch-rival RPI on Daley Field. Game time is three o'clock. The Garnet close out their season by traveling to Syracuse on Wednesday. --. Netmen· Finish Slat~ At 4-5, . . .

The Albany State loss came on the heels of a stunning victory over Hamilton eight days ago. The Gqr- net eked out a 5-4 triunnph, the first tennis win over the Continen- tals in 22 years. South once again led the Gar- net effort, scoring a win in singles competition and teaming with Fis- chler for a victory in doubles action. Other winners for the Dutchmen were Fred Kaplan and Ernie Guil- let in singles,. and the tandem of Kaplan and Guillet in doubles. In action earlier this season, the Garnet edged the Engineers of RPI on April 27, 5-4, and lost to a powerhouse Rocheste.r sextet 9-0 on May 2, South, Kaplan, and Ken Groover triumphed over their Engineer opponents in singles act- ion, while South teamed with Fisch- ler and Groover joined Guillet to score victories in doubles play. The outstanding Yellowjackets from the Kodak City were simply too much for the Garnet, as Roch- ester swept every match in b0th singles and doubles competition. Coach Robert. McMurray is un- derstandably optitnistic at the team's pros.pects for next season. Although he was \quite pleased\ with the squad's showing this spring, he expects even better things next year with everyone in the top si.x returning except South. McMurray was especially happy with the individual performances of Groover, who posted a 5-3 mark this spring against tough competi- tion, and frosh Ernie Guillet who compiled an equally satisfying 5-4 record. McMurray hopes to send his starry doubles team of South and Fischler, which won all but one of its matches, to the Eastern Reg- ional Championships later this month. According to the Garnet mentor., South and Fischler are players of \the 'highest caliber.\ Continentals Whip Trackmen; AII-Frosh _Relay To Compete The Garnet have not enjoyed a winning tennis season since 1961, when the netmen put together a 6~3 final mark. The next best recent Union showing caine in 1963 when the racquet squad finished 4-5. THE PEA;NUT STORE By Greg Hamlin The Garnet track team, under- manned because of the recent stu- dent protests on campus, lost to a talented squad from Hamilton on Tuesday, 84-60. Art Riccio and Dick Thickens shared the spot- light for the Dutchmen. Riccio captured a double win in the sprints and also led off on the winning 440 yard relay team. The junior's times (10.2 in the 100, and 22.5 in the 220) were his best clockings this season. Thickens finished the curtailed dual meet season undefeated. The shot putte1 threw the weight 46' 10\. betterirlg his previous per~ sonal best by o::er a foot. Freshman sMsation Tim Mc- Cabe also ran v\ell turning in a 1:56.8 in the h<ilf-mile run. In addition, ,\1cCabe anchored the v.ic- torious mile relay squad. The Dutchmen, already slowed by injuries to Bruce Cobb and All- American Rick jaszczak, lost star quarter-miler Steve Wood for what will probably be the duration of the seasol't The soph pulled a mus- <;:le in the 220 yard event. Wobd's absence means that the Garnet will have to rely on an all freshmen mile relay squad in the New York State and East Coast Regional Championships. Cortland will host the state meet this Saturday, while Dickin- son College, in Carlisle, Penn- sylvania, will hold the regional competition._ DIAMANTE'S Enjoy Our Fine Ho~t Coolu~d Italian Food in Ou1 C¢mfortable Dining Room Opp. Th• Brownell Gate on No\ St,. ..

MORE ON P•3 Candidate Ed Fox Speaks Outlines His Viewpoints Ed Fox, candidate for Congress, gave a talk to students about his campaign at Silliman Hall last night. Basically, the campaign started as a movement to raise the main issues of dissent and war spending. To bring about change, Fox claims that you have to go out and talk to the people. Initially, Ed .Fox had no hopes of winning the primary elections, only bringing out the issues to the voters. The goal of his campaign was not to wi.n, but to end the war. Recent canvassing results . have changed Fox's outlook, however, because oi the favorable response exhibited b~ voters. During a question and answer period, Fox was asked about tlu possibility of gettil'g involved wit:h a third party. Fox saki that \ti-le New Democratic Coalmon is mol'e viable than a third party.

Recently, Fox handed out leaflets to the G.E. workers remincling them of Stratton's statement, and, according to Fox, the leaflets were received favorably. \And because of the tumult and alteration- of course require- ments this spring, that kind of comparison would doubtless be unjust ta the teaching faculty,\ he added.

And if you also happen to go crazy over Eli Wallach talking a foreign language in Eng- lish, \The Brain\ completes a dual feature you should enjoy. \The Brain,\ briefly, is a comedy about this crooked Eng- lishman (David Niven) who for- mulizes super thefts in his rather massive cranium, transfers the crime into cartoon form, and then pulls it off for real. This time he and his boys want the 5 million pound NATO cash shipment going by rail from Paris to Brussels. However, Niven has to strike a deal with the local Mafia to make his \plan work. The Mafia boss is fidgety Frankie Scarnatiato (Wall- ach). and whenever Frankie talks he sounds exactly like Wallach's MeKican bandit chieftain Calvera in \The Magnificent Seven.\ At first the Mafia will settle for 6% of the haul, but later Wallach dis- honors the agreement when Niven stalts dishonoring Eli's baby sis- ter.

M·ounties Are First Rate ·In Cuckoo Nest Fly By Howev.er, Antonioni must have seen this . .Perhaps he wanted to do a subjective, theatrical documen- tary of the United States, and his talents went into the creation of images and moods based upon his American travels. Not to distract us from his picture of the U.S.A., he shoved these lifeless, pretty figures to guide us on the jour- ney, but not to distract our atten- tion. tion of the American culture, symc bolized by a desert house in the middle of one of nature's last strongholds. This scene is repeated from different angles, and then the camera picks up certain parts of the home-Wonder bread, pool furniture, Campbell's soups, and other artifacts of our culture. In the end, the camera shows a widec angle shot of Death Valley in its pristine beauty. The movie is being publicized · as a \head film,\ in other words, to be seen when doped up.

The play is set in an insane as y I u m run by a domineering matriarch by the name of Nurse Ratched (Carol Esther Sperling) 1 whose choking grip is tested by the entrance of Randell P. Mcmur- phy (Paul T. Constantine). McMur- phy i~ ? charactei who exudes rough and tumble masculinity; a typical Keseyan hero, typical of one half of Kesey himself. The other half of Kesey is found in the character of Bromden (Erik G. Molbach),a brooding l1,1dian whose masculinity was squashed by the white man's society. Henry Weil's direction is almost flawless, as he adeptly choreographed the large cast i11to a smooth flowing unit. His attempt to break down the barrier between actors and audience, however, an important element for a truly forceful theatrical experience, is only .partially successful. Nurse Ratched is plagued by theatrical inexperience. She is too conscious of her lines and con- sequently appears to be playing a yuality rather than a character. Her mannerisms, however, are true to the part, and if she spent more time evoking '1er character rather than defining its qualities, her performance would be better. Paul Constantine does an admir- able job as McMurphy. His por- trayal is a I ways in character although at times he trades exu- berance for loudness. The finest performance is turned in by Erik G. Molbach as Bromden. He avoids the pitfall of intellectualizing the character at the expense of being the charac- ter. Bromden's presence is felt throughout the play, but his most outstanding moments come in his soliloquies to his father, at which time he charismatically holds the· audience's attention.

PAGE 4 CONCORDIENSIS, MAY C~ncord y Sports Laxmen Bounce Bac·k, Beat Hapless RPI, 14-5; Syrac.use ·Tomorrow BY MARK SHUCOLL Bruce Dugan, Mark Sanderson, and Barry Gross combined for thirteen goals on Saturday as the Union lacrosse team outlasted rival RPI 14-5 at Daley Field. The win was number eight on the season for the Garnet against three losses. The Engineers' record slipped to 3•7. Dugan put Union on the score- board with the first of six goals five minutes info the opening period. Sanderson matched the feat with the first of his four tallies just two minutes later. Rensselaer's Bob Evans cut the margin to 2-1 with a score at 6:59 of the period, but Dugan retaliated with two more before the fifteen minute session came to a close, and the Engineers never again threatened. tested on Green, The junior goalie dove to meet the ball and steered it wide with his body. Despite the win, the Garnet boast only eight wins in the 28 games played between the two neighbors. The Troy outfit was victorious 9-5 one year ago in a game played at RPI. Tomorrow the Union stickmen venture westward to oppose Syra- cuse University, a game which marks the renewal of the Garnet's oldest lacrosse rivalry. The two teams first met in 1924, the year Union first insti- tuted ·lacrosse on a varsity level, but have faced each other only 18 times. The. Orangemen hold a com- manding 15-3 lead in the series, including a 14-7 win a year ago. The game is Union's final contest' of the season and is scheduled for 3p.m. THE GARNET lacrosse team, shown here in action during their 16~Q whitewashing of Hamilton on April 22, journey to Syracuse University .tomorrow to .face the Orangemen in their final contest of the season. A win will give the Dutchmen <1c final record of 9-3, a notable improvement over last season's 5-7 mark. Gross contributed three goals and a solo assist to the Garnet effort, while Doug Duval added a single tally and two assists. The Garnet, despite periodic sloppy pI a y, were clearly the superior of the two teams. The offense rolled into double-figures for the sixth time this year, as opposed to the one time the 1969 team turned the trick. On defense, goalie Ed Green had his usual quota of stops bordering on the spectacular among his thirteen saves.

BY BILL HOLLER~N Kings Point bunched four.of their six hits in the second hi- ning, scoring twice to provide the margin of victory in a 2-1 win over the Garnet baseball team on Saturday. The loss, w h i c h dropped ' Union's record to 7-5, came on the heels of a laughable 13-3 triumph over Hobart in the rain on Friday. The Dutchmen ham- mered Statesmen pitching for thirteen basehits, their largest hitting splurge of the spring, and capitalized on nine Hobart walks and four errors to win in a run- away. Kings Point wasted no time in getting to Garnet starter Hank' Lambert on Saturday, bunching· three singles together in_the second stanza before aptly-named Bruce Cannon rifled a double up in alley in right-center field, a shot which fell just beyond the outstretched glove of sprawling centerfielder John Quirk. AII-Frosh R.ela~ Second, Track men Eighth in States Sending less than a third of their entire team, the Garnet track squad still managed an eighth place finish in the fourteen team New York State Track and Field Cham- pionships held at Cortland. The Saturday meet, marred by rain and high winds, was high- lighted by the two outstanding per- formances of the Dutchmen relay teams and the fine efforts of Tim McCabe and Ed Rowley. The 440-yard relay team of Steve Andreski, Geoff Walker, Dave Gray, and Art Riccio streaked to their best docking of the year. Their effort was good for a sur- prise third place. The mile relay combination' of AI Prysunka, Greg Hamlin, Geoff Walker, and McCabe almost .pulled the upset of the spring season. The all-freshmen quartet raced to a fine 3:22.6 docking in ; / their specialty, tm1shmg a mere .6 of a second behind the winner of the event, Cortland. McCabe, running anchor, almost salvaged the victory. The diminu- tive McCabe ran his leg in 49.6 seconds, by far the fastest clock- ing .for any Garnet runner this year. What made McCabe's stirring performance even more remark- able was that he had just finished running in the 440-yard inter- mediate hurdles twenty minutes before. In that event, the red- headed speedster placed third. Rowley engineered the · final surprise of the afternoon, copping a fourth in the high jump com- petition. This Friday and Saturday, the Garnet mile relay squad will com.: pete in the Eastern Track and Field Championships at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. lambert was superb the rest of the way, however, allowing only two hits and no walks in his remaining seven innings of work before he was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the last of the ninth. The Garnet could do even less against fireballing Mariner right- hander- John Clark, who limited the normally robust Union hitters to only four singles. Two of those hits, however, came in the last of ninth when Clark's blazing fastball lost\ just a touch of its zip. Dale long led off with a sharp single, and took second when the Mariner left- fielder misplayed the ball Into a double~ · Mike McGee followed with a walk, and moved to third when Skip lega singled to score long. After Bob Bernhardt popped up to the second baseman, Rick Arons, batting for lambert with two men out, worked the faltering Clark to a full count and walked. McGee, however, apparently thinking that the sacks were loaded, bolted home as the umpire signaled ball four, and was promptly nailed by the catcher in the ensuing run- down. The blunder cost the Garnet an excellent chance for the win, as the bases would have been jammed with the top of the order coming to the plate. Bob Mitchell starred for the Garnet in Friday's rain-soaked contest With the Statesmen both on the mound and .at the plate. Not only did he pitch an eight-hit com- plete gaine, his third route-going stint of the spring, but he blasted a two-run homer deep to left- THE PEANUT STORE Featuring PLANTERS HOT ROASTED PEANUTS and Nutmeots from all over · the world . 406 STATE ST. center ·field in the fifth inning. The home run was Mitchell's second of the season. The Dutchmen moved into an early 3-0 lead, parlaying two singles, by Bob MacKenzie and long, a walk, and an error into three first-inning runs. The Gar- net added a solo tally· in the second inning when Mitchell walked, stole second, and scored on John Quirk's base hit. Union's.- hitters kept flailing. away at the Statesmen in the third stanza, tallying five times. Long led off with a double, and crossed the plate after McGee walked and leg a singled. Bob Bernhardt followed with a two-run single and scored when Mitchell poled his home run way up the bank in left. With the score 9-0 in the Gar- net's favor and the rain falling heavily, little remained for Union to do but attempt to .push the con- test past the fifth inning in order to make the game official. Mitchell shut out the Statf;:'!S\ men through seven innings of play, but Hobart got to the freshman hur- ler for a single tally in the eighth and'two runs in-the ninth. Mitchell finished with six strikeouts and five walks for the afternoon. Tomorrow the Garnet will jour- ney to Troy to battle RPI~ hoping to atone for a 1i-7 loss to the Engineers earlier this season. Mitchell will start for the Dutch- men. FERRO PHARMACY 575 Nott Street Schenectady, N. V.

NEW YORK,i MAY 22, 1970 PR!CE TWENTY CENTS '~: Senate Appoints Sullivan, Hyman to Skeller Board BY PETER S . WEINGOLO Because there was no quo- rum of members present at last Tuesday's Senate meet- ing, the senators present had to content themselves with vo·t- ing James O'Sullivan '71, and Gerry Hyman, '72 to appoint- ments on the Rathskeller Board. Because the refreshment area had been originally stu- dent owned, a board of stu- dents, faculty, and administra- tors was selected to oversee its operation. Only tWo of the positions are filled by election, and these by vote of the Stu- dent Senators who are legally termed the membership in the Rathskeller Corporation. Kunstler Asks Justice lhe 'skeller Board, as explained by its secretary, Registrar Calvin Schmidt, is the board of students, faculty, and administrative officers The Student Tax increase proposals which were tabled because of the poor attendance will be discussed at the next meeting, on Tuesday, May 26. Attorney ·William Kunstler told an audience of over 1100 iR Memorial Chapel Wednes- day afternoon that it was their duty to \resist every exercise of illegitimate authority.\ Mr. Kunstler, speaking on the topic of \Civil Disorders and Civi.l Libertjes,\ noted w h a t he called a \lack of understanding\ of r i g h t s guaranteed in the F irs t A me n·d ment. According to Kunst!Eir, the framers of the First Amer:~dment intended to allow all types of speech, and therefore judicial limita- tions on speech such as the \clear and present danger\ guidelines actually serve to ema!;culate a basic Constitu- tional right .. f.urthermore, in- flammatory rhetor]c cannot be compared to \shouting fire in a crowded theatre,\ qecause speech is intended to provoke thought rather than immediate action. Mr. Kunstler devoted much of his talk to the · current national crisis, and he called for \a universal strike\ on college campuses to show the nation that busin€ss as usual must be suspended. He asserted that we are faced with ·a unique situation in the United StC!tes today, what he called ff the greatest internal crisis since the Civil War.\ The two interrelated events which galvanized students into action, Kunstler said, were the American invasion of Cambodia and the killing of four white, middle-class. stu- dents at Kent State, He de- scribed student activism as \the most potent force in the United States.\ Mr. Kunstler regarded American involvement in Southeast Asia as a \micro- cosm\ of our troubled domes- tic scene. For instance, he cited the \racism\ inherent in both fighting a g a i n s i Orientals and in sending a h i g h proportion of black soldiers to the battlefront. Kunstler proceeded to draw some comparisons, not in- tended as a striCt analogy, between 1970 America and the German Weimar Republic of 1930. He concluded that the German experience teaches us th!it ah apparently civilized people can commit countless atrocities against humanity. The civil libet<ties attorney stated that ';I am non-violent,\ and stated that only a \mad- man\ would burn . buildings, but he a Is o claimed that \When people aroe pushed be- yond the pale .of. e><pectation they react violently.'' Kunstler saw two major priorities for students: f i r s t, they must \coalesce\, and then t h e y must actively resist what they regard as unjust authority. He further stated that his trust i.n the judicial s y s t e m was limited, and that the judiciary must also be resisted when it is an instrument of repression. Mr. Kunstler, in closing whose duty it is to see that remarks indicating his zealous the Rathskeller ope rates idealism, emphasized that efficiently. and provides all \there c 0 me times when the services it was designed people must take a stand for to do. what they think is right.\ He · In explaining the history believed that only \some and purpose of the Board Mr. significant act of faith\ on the Schmidt said the 'skeller was part of government could defer opened soon after World War increased turmoil.

Wednesday that climaxed weeks of preparation, Phi Epsilon Pi voted to change its name to \1247\ and to expand its membership to include admin- istrators, faculty, and staff as well as all students. The activities of 1247 wHI be con- ducted at the .former fraternity house, located at 1247 Lenox Road. As of May 18, 1970,- Phi Ep had no outstanding debts besides approximately five t~ousand dollars owed Union College for a loan granted four years ago when the dining room was enlaq~ed_ 1247 has proposed that the college take over the building in exchange for amortization of the debt and ·<1 refurbish- ment of the physical plant. The Trustees will decide this matter at their june meeting. After a few years of stu- dent ownership and operation, however, the students lost their entrepreneurial zeal and the Rathskeller became dirtier and dirtier, didn't open occasionally and was finally forced to close because of improper management and not enough help. For five months some time in the IC!te fifties, (no one is quite. .sure when) there was no 'skeller. Finally Saga Foods was convinced to take over the venture after overcoming their fears of serving beer, since it was the first time the food outfit would be dealing in alcohol. The moves this week resulted in the approval of a new constitution for 1247 to replace the Phi Epsilon Pi by-laws. Under the Phi Ep constitution, two successive votes were · needed to effect the change, which carried by 36-9 on Tuesday and 38-6 on Wednesday.

Fall Class.es Uninterrupted The Faculty Council voted Tuesday to continue Fall term classes with no interruption. The move killed the proposed cancellation of regular aca- demic activity to permit stu- dents to work in the election campaigns. The council did recommend that other colleges which have decided to suspend classes be closely watched for future refer~nce. The Council felt that. it would unnecessarily iRterfere with the logistics of running the school, would interfere with sports events, and would probably be unnecessary since those students who want to should be able to campaign in their spare time. It was also felt t h a t it might set a dangerous precedent. Acting on a proposal from Division I, the Faculty Coun- cil a d opt e d a resolution recommending, \that the col- lege continue its policy of not using racially or ethnically discriminatory faCilities for official college functions.\ The Ceuncil was specifi- cally acting on allegations that certain college functions were held at the reputedly dis- criminatory Mohawk Club. However, President Martin in- formed the Council that no such meetings have taken place for at least three years. A similarly proposed motion that no pictures be re- quired by the admissions de- partment was tabled until representatives of that depart- ment and the Black Alliance could be contacted. Although it had always been \vaguely assumed,\ according to Council member, Prof. Charles Olton, that all Faculty Council meetings were open to all faculty members,' a check by R. G o r d o n Bingham, assistant to the President, had revealed nothing official in the records. And since proposals had recently come from stu- dents for all-college partici- pation, the motion was tabled for a future comprehensive review.· An emergency proposal from the language department presented by Council mem- ber Prof. Frederick Klemm will establish Hebrew language courses at Union for the first time.

Letters to the Editors TO THE EDITORS: tharles Blanker's letter concerning the student deaths at Kent State, which appeared in Tuesday~s CONtORDY, .is an illustration of the muddled thinking origir:~ating from the political right wing, which con- tinually uses the phr<tse \law and order\ while neglecting to understand the true meaning beyond the cliche. Mr. Blanker strongly implies that the student pro- testors, not the trigger\happy National Guard, were somehow responsible for the murclers, because ulf it weren't for them, nothingwould have happened.\ Of course, if one were to use an extension of this type of logic, one would have to accuse President Nixon of responsi- bility, for without his decision to deeper. our military inter- vention student protests would probably net have occurred. Additionally, blame should be placed on Spiro Agnew, since he has suggested, among many other things, that dissenters be \separated\ from society. The fact that Mr. Blanker does not mention these previous incidents clearly highlights his slanted i n t e r p ret at i o n of recent events, an interpreta- tion which seeks to punish the symptoms student unrest} while ignoring the disease (interven- tionist paranoia, political and racial oppression). One can and should con- demn acts of student violence against property, but at the same time one must deeply abhor fatal overreaction on the part of law en f o r cement officials. These people do not act as guardians of \law and order,\ but rather as instru- ments of fascist authoritarian repression, when dissenters are shot on no real grounds commensurate to the act of murder. Legal authorities must exercise self-restraint for a - democratic society to exist; there is no justification for using bullets to counter rocks. Mr. Blanker, in an incre- dible display of callousness, tells us to \stop crying over what happened at Kent State.\ In actuality, his view is reac- tionary in that he is willing to use virtually any means in an attempt to preserve the status- . quo; it is an ideology both politically and morally bank- rupt. A true \conservative\ would realize that our present consitutional system of law based on justice cannot sur- vive in an environment which condones police violence, the worst type of illegality. 1 If Mr. Blanker's letter is any indication of the views of The Student Committee for an Alternative Viewpoint, I fear that this organization is in no way going to improve the intel- lectual atmosphere of the College. PETER BICKERMAN '73 TO THE EDITORS: After thrice reading Mr. Blanker's letter, I feel com- pelled to write this reply, not as a contradiction of his ideas, but as a means of carrying them a bit further. • Yes, Mr. Blanker, when a person breaks the law he should expect to be punished. If, as you say, \the laws exist to protect society from the indi- vidual\ who is protecting us from Mr. Nixon, \the most lawless man in the country right now,\ according to syn~ dicated columnist Pete Hamill?

Perhaps though, instead of abolishing it, we just clean it up a bit. But, let's start our housework at the top. JEFF SILVERMAN\ •72 TO THE EDITORS: It appears to me that the arguments presented by Mr. Bon- eventre in support of President Nixon's policies in Indochina and at home must have ar-isen out of a dis- taste for the \radical elements\ of the Peace Movement, for these arguments surely are fat f r o m rational and logical. For example, let's look at some of Mr. 6oneventre's insightful com- ments. He spends approximately one-half of his discussion degrad- ing the terminology of the \New left\. As far as I can see, these slogans serve merely as tools which facilitate uniting the move- ment. A common slogan t e n d s to lead to a sense of unity among the members, which is extremely · important if any •'effectiveness. is to be attained. It iust .so happens that \Right On'; sounds far better than \Hurrah!\ or f'AII. Right!\. Just for the record, the \New left\ can hardly take credit for inventing the phrase; it has been arqund for a very long time. But we should not be dismayed at this attack on our vocabulary, for Mr. Boneventre then proceeds to discuss more concrete matters such as repression. Obviously, Mr, Bonevehtre, no sane person is agains.t convicting prov~n To the Editors: The formation of the Stu- dent Committee for an Alter- native Viewpoint has provided an important dimension to the eudcational process here at Union.

Both publica- tioRs play important roles in providing Union students with viewpoints of both sides of an issue. From this, mature and meaningful opinions and valwes should dev~lop and should hopefully enable both sides to work for the improvements so drastiCally needed in our society. JACK OVERTON '73 To the Editors: The tragedy at Kent State was Our system evolved as a result of a violent revolution,. and since then violence is an integral part of our society; ·it is the primary means through which we attain our national ends. When a student perceives the American system, he sees a sys- tem which spreads violence in the name of peace, institutes political repression in the name of justice and shoots unarmed black men in the back in the name of law and order. Finding no viable alternatives, students have merely conformed to this life style in an attempt to attain their goals. Violence of any nature is deplor- able, and if Kent State has shown us anything it has shown us a reflection of ourselves. Good bye. MARK BOYLAN '71 BY LANCE FALDUCCIWITZ Jean-Luc Godard, .father of the French New Wave, has. ceased to be a revolutionary film director to become a film-maker revolution- ary, as he related in a recent in- terview. In \Sympathy for the Devil,\ being shown tomorrow in Old Chapel and in SS 016 on Satur- day and Sunday at 7 and 9:15, a girl paints MAO and then extends down from the .letter A the letters RT. This mixture of .revolution and art ~eems to be Godard's reason for . making this film. Godard uses The Rolling Stones throughout the film as a metaphor for the new revolutionary culture. The .group is shown rehearsing to record the song, \Sympathy for the Devil;\ They are completely isolated from society; the guitarist is shown in a small booth.

One scene shows the exploitation of the youth culture by the media; not only can anybody be a spokes- man for his generation. but the press supplies the ideas while the spokesman agrees or disagrees. Another scene show.s a smutty book shop, .and the camera scans every book leisurely to show the pre- occupation with sado-sex (a busty woman, wea~ing a SW)!Stika arm- band, is whipping Charles Atlas). While ·this is going on, the owner is reading a \how-to\ on political propaganda, and gives away the books with a leaflet and the custo- mer giving a Nazi salute. Godard foresees a black revolution, and a number of scenes combine new black rhetoric with blacks arming. In the last scene of the blacks, the intellectual spokesman is asked how he can communicate with the whites. After an abstract, philo- sophical dissertation, he concludes that it will be difficult because b I a c k s and whites speak two different languages employing the same words. Yet, his answer could be understood by an educated per- son much more easily than it could be by a ghetto black. The communi- cation, the forerunner of any revol- ution has begun. The original film is entitled \1 plus 1 \. (The producer changed the name and added a performance of the complete StonE>~· song). The segmPnt of the f i I m c a II e d \1 plus 1 equals 2\ has a g i r I paint in g\Freudemocracy.\ Godard may be saying that to know thyself is to. b.e free, and he is trying i:o. mak~ . us know ourselves. Each scene is shot with only one camera, and there are no closeups and only a few barely noticeable uses of the zoom. Each scene is quite long, and the camera moves slowly and repeats itself. The camera is another person, seeing only what one person could see. I h a v e been informed by Blanker that the sources used for his information were the WashiRgton Post, a newspaper probably second in quality only to the N.Y. Times, and the N~tional Observer, considered by many to be the nation's most objective publication. Now is there any . way that these publications can be con- sidered disreputable news sources? After reading these publicatipns, I ca.n find no in- stance in which Blanker dis- torted the truth to correspond to his beliefs. My only suggestions is that anyone who s h a r e s views s i m i I a r to M o r a n t e and Bickerman should also read the publica- tions and perhaps they will not be as easily incli.ned to make such rash statements. Finally, Morante and Bick- erman state that they are dis- turbed by Viewpoint's \firm commitment to defend the established norms of Ameri- can society at all costs.\ Once again, I can find no evidence of this in the 1 ·t,Jblication.

Josef Suk Wins Standing Ooation For Virtuosity BY DAVID 1- UGUCCIONI On Tuesday night what was per- haps the best concert of the year took place in Memorial Chapel. Violinist Josef Suk presented a program of Beethoven sonatas that brought forth a standing ovation at the end of the concert. The three' sonatas played by Mr. Suk were the Sonata in F Major, opus 24, Spring;. Sonata in C Minor, opus 30, number 2; and Sonata in A Major, opus 47, Kreutzer. lrl the program notes, it is remarked the)t the Beethoven S o n at as arti un- matched' among violin sonatas in the technical skill and breadth of vision Witll·....;hich they were written. In the Sonata in F Major; Mr. Suk defined the four movements ve-ry well, with the slow movement belrif{'especially full and beautiful: The rh·U sic was pI aye d in a classical, not romantic manner, and was k e p t control led at all times. The Sonata in A Minor, Written as Bee1hoven was growing .deaf, is more serious in content than the one described above. Mr. Stik pI a y ed it in a militaristic, although not stiff, formal manner._ The beal)ty of the pieces as Mt. Suk played them was in the rap- port of the man with his instru- ment and the music. It was remarked that Mr. Suk would have g i v e n the same concert if the audience had numbered 3 or 3000 people. The last work, the Kreutzer Sonata; was especially demanding of the soloist, who again displayed complete mastery of v i o I i n technique. .Praise should be given to Mr. Suk's a c com pan is t joseph Banowetz.

PAGE 4 CONCORDIENSIS, MAY 22, 1970 Concordy Sports Lax Fails Short Against Orangemen BY MARK SHUGOLL .<\n underdog but highly deter- mined Garnet lacrosse team gave Syracuse University a battle before bowing to the Central New York State Champions. 10-7, on Wednes- day in their final outing of the season. Union brought an 8-3 record mto the tussle but were down before the favored reg1onal champion Orangemen and their 6-1 record. The Garnet have now conquered their Western rivals only three times in 19 tries. Syracuse, boasu ng victories over powers Hobart and Cortland, both of whom defeated Union, took a scanty 3-2 lead after the first period. The Garnet goals came off the sticks of Mark Sanderson .md Barry Gross. Sanderson, Union '5 leading scorer, connected tlue( t1mes during the afternoon. The Dutchmen's Bruce Dugan got the equalizer in the second penod, but Syracuse bounced right back and took a 4-3 advantage. Sanderson's second goal evened matters again and the teams walked off the field at halftime in a 4-4 tie. Statistically the third period has been Union's weakest over the course of the season, and it came to haunt them Wednesday aher- noon in Syracuse. Union had out- scored its oppoSition 28-19 in the third session, but the offensive mark was the Garnet's lowest single period total. and the 19 opposition goals represented the . most scored against Union in any of the four stanzas. Just a week ago, a 5-2 half- time Garnet lead became a 5-5 t1e after three periods against Cortland in a game that the Union team lost in overtime. On Wednes- day, the Orange pressured the Gdrnet defense all period and man- aged four goals while holding the Dutchmen scorele~s. T h us the Ruggers Haue No Wins .. Yet Un1on·s Rugbv Club w11l close out Its <.pring sedson tomorrow afternoon w1th a contest against the Schenectady Rugbv Club. The game will be played on Schenec- tady's home field, lotated on upper Lenox Road. starting ~t 2:00 p.m. The Dutchmen are st1ll looking for their firsi triumph of the year, havmg stumbled to a dismal 0-6-1 record in fall and spnng pfay. Last autumn the ruggers pusted an 0-3-1 mark, with the t1e comm.g against a first-year Vermont Uni- versity club. while continuing win- less this spring in three contests. The Garnet were swamped in their last outing, a 31-0 drubbing at the hands of MIT on May 9 in the first annual New England Rugby Tournament. Hopes are high for a win tomor- row, though mainly on the strength of Union's performance in a recent scnmmage against the Schenectady club. In that encounter the Dutch- men scored a 5-0 victory, their first \win\ in quite some time. The ruggen. may be somewhat unprepared for their season's finale, however, as turnouts for practices this week were distur- ' bingly light. The Garnet will also be without the services of hard- running linemen Hank Wessman and Larry Sykes, who, for one reason or another, have played little this spring. Club president and fly-halfback Mark Sweeney will also be side- lined, the victim of a knee injury· earlier in the season. home team held a seemingly com- fortable 8-4 lead after three periods Union made a bid in the final · session as they closed to 8-6 on scores by Sanderson and Jim Sabella. However, tl;!at was as close as the Garnet could get, as Syra- cuse added two tallies to open up a four goal bulge before Steve Ciesinski fired home Union's final tally. Once again it was Pup Gould and goalie Ed Green shining on defense for the Garnet. Green made 22 saves. Coach Allison's team thus ended their campaign with a more than satisfying 8~4 mark, a complete turnabout from last year's dis- appointing 5-7 season. Allison expected early mistakes and con- stant improvement from his sopho- more laden team, and he got just that. Union opened the season by edging out a mediocre Middlebury team 3-2, committing numerous mistakes in the process. After an easy win over Stevens the still green Garnet were embar- rassed by powerf~l Hobart 15-1. The team Continued to improve, however, running off four straight wins before bowing to Colgate. Union finished up with victories over Trinity and RPI and strong showings in losing efforts against perennial powerhouses Cortland State and Syracuse. The three goal :foss to Syracuse shows how far the Garnet have come since their loss to Hobart. Syracuse had already beaten Hobart and Cortland, and thus on paper the Garnet seemingly had no chance againsttheOrangemen. Union, how- ever, played tremendous lacrosse, and demonstrated what competition and the tutelage of a coach who has been in the business 12 years can do. Allison has a lot to look forward to next seasoll as he wi II lose only six senie>rs from his 33 man roster. Sanderson, who had 29 goals, 18 assists, and 47 points to read Union in all three offensive departments, is only a sophomore. Dugan, second in goals and total points, ·is a junior. Over one year he has upped his goal scoring from eight tallies as a sophomore to 19. Cross, third in scoring, is also a sophomore.

The win more than atoned for Union's embar- rassing 12-7 loss to the Engineers on April 28, and assured Coach Art Lawrence of his sixth con- secutive winning season. The 8-5 Dutchmen closed out their 1970 season this afternoon with a make-up contest against Ro«Zhester. Kevin Coyne, sporting a 1-1 record on the mound, was the probable starting pitcher for Union. The contest was originally scheduled for April 24 but was rained out. lega's sixth-.nning blast made a winner of starting pitcher Bob Mitchell, who went the distance am;! registered his fourth win in five starts. Mitchell's only loss of the spring came against Clarkson earlier in the season, a 2-1 defeat in which the vearling righthander tossed a three-hitter. Mitchell was not as untouch- able on Saturday, however, although he struck out six and walked only two. RPI knocked him around for 10 hits, but the safeties were well-scattered, I ea vi n g eight Engineer runners stranded on base. M1tchell has been the pitching Frosh Laxmen Kill Syracuse Union's freshmen lacrosse team gave Coach Gary Brown a resounding sendoff on Saturday when the yearlings trounced the Syracuse freshmen, 13-5. Brown will be leaving Union at the end of the academic year to take up baseball and soccer coaching reins at the University of Rochester. Mike Hogan and Bill Kremen led the Garnet onslaught, each connecting for three goals. Ken Giacco hit for two scores, while Mark Dyer, Marty Goosen, Steve Hill, Don Klein, and Tim Foley each had one goal for their after- noon's work. The Garnet yearlings finished their spring campaign with a fine 6-2 record, promising good things for future Union varsity lacr0sse squads. surprise of the season for the Garnet. He originally played sec- ond base at the start of the season but was pressed into mound service along with shortstop Dale long when Larry Berkeley and Jack Siedlecki developed sore arms. In addition to his sparkling 4-1 record, he has compiled a hifty 1.46 ERA and has fanned 33 men in 43 innings of work. The win on Wednesday was the fomth complete game in his five starts.

The senior outfielCJer, a mere .133 batter last season, has blossomed into a .31S swinger this spring . Shortstop Long also continued his torrid hitting pace on Wednes- day, connecting for two hits in four tries to boost his average to an astronomical AGO. long's pre- sent batting average is nearly 200 points better than his .288 figure of last year. Batting heroes for the Engineers in their season's finale were Robb McKenzie, who had two singles and a double, Charlie lapp, who whacked a triple and added a single and Bill Dick, who had two singles for the afternoon. The Dutchmen went into this afternoon's contest, with Rochester batting a lusty .251 as a team. That figure is nearly 50 points higher than the one turned in by last year's pitching-rich, hitting-poor squad. The club earned-run mark is presently a creditable 3.41, not a bad average for a club supposedly bereft of pitching. Freshman Mile Relay Team In Spotlight For Regionals The Garnet track team's all- freshman mile rel«~y squad will highlight Union's presence in the NCAA College Division Regional Track Championships to be held tomorrow at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The quartet, composed of Geoff Walker, Greg Hamli11, Alan Pry- sunka, and Tim McCabe, did well in the State Championships at Cqrt- land State last Saturday. The year- ling relay finished second in a fine 3:23 clocking, only two sec- ords off t~e Union record. McCabe anchored the effort with an out- standing 49.6 leg. McCabe will also compete .in the 440 intermediate hurdles, an event in which the red-headed yearling placed third at Cortland. The all-frosh relay quartet was pressed into service when all- A me ric an quarter-miler Rich laszczak and Steve Wood were sidelined by injuries late in the spring season. )aszczak aggravated a hamstring pull suffered during the indoor slate. The Garnet cindermef'l finished an abbreviated outdoor 'eco;nn with a 1-1-1 record. Several :>1 1ion's meets later in the scht,du were cancelled because·of student unrest and strike activities on neighbor- ing northeastern campuses.

The Dutchmen :h.ad had no luck on the links against the Panthers in 18 straight tries, dat- ing back to 1940, while ~PI had mastered Union in 19 straight encounters. The Dutchmen put an end to the Middlebury skein on May 4, downing the Panthers .as se11iors Doug Vergith and Terry Brown scored triumphs in match play to lead the Union win. The tNin vic- tories kept Vergith and Brown undefeated in five matches. The Engineers, however, con- tinued to handle the Garnet as they whipped the Dutchmen 9-1 on May 13. Vergith and B~own were both defeated in match play to put an end to their 'Ninning streaks. The loss in the final rnatcn of the season lowered Union'-s final record to 4-2.

BY THOM;AS MORANTE Pr of.e s aors Gati, Jonas, Ker13lmer andSharlet, addressing yesterda:y's meeting sponsored by the Student Committee for an Alternative Viewpoint, discussed vario\1$ aspects of the war in Southeast Asia and the Cambodian venture. The first question the pro- fessors responded to was: What · were the ,reasons for the United States involvement in Indochina? Professor ·Charles Gati, of tlle Political S c i en c e department, indicated that u~s. foreign pol·icy since Wodd War II involvf:ld an attempt at balancing the power structure between. Russia and China. Realizing the strategic location of Indochina, Gati felt that mitial u.s. intervention was justifiable to a certain extent. However, he :opposed the war because: 11 I didn't think we could win an Asi-an land war,H Current social unrest in the u.s., accord- ing to Professor Gati ~~~'makes continuation of the war impossible·.\ Professor Manfred Jonas of the History department sees our involvement as originating at the begi.tming of the 19th century, immediately following u.s. development of trade with China. Jonas, describing our foreign policy in this area, said, uwe have favof;'ed and we have worked for keeping: Asia open for Ame;r-i.- can activities.; we baV€ worked against domination o.f Asia by any world power.\ The next speaker was Pro- fessor Thomas R. Kershner ofthe Economics departm.ent, who suggested six reasons for u~s. involvement in Viet Nam, the most important of which dealt with u.s. pride. According to Kerslmer, 11 We have a set of congressional, mil i·t ar y and Presidential pride on the line here.~ Kershner also pointed out that the workers in tllis ccuntr,y could not sustain a defeat; they would. hate to realize that the 1 ib e r al s have been correct in their assumption tllat the war is wrong, and n.ot in the best interests of the U.S. The second question asked of the professors was: What are the alternatives to our policy in Viet Nam? Professor Kershner saw the U.S. as having siX alternative policies. In addition to a military victory Kershner said that the u.s. had the alternative of immediate withdrawal or witll- drawal within the next year or year and a half, However, he said that, «If we do leave, in some sense the North Vietnamese will have won.;\ Kershner indicated that our present }JOlicy of unilateral withdrawal mignt well be the on:ly course ofaction, He stated that: •We'll stay onfor a long time,. until We get some form of .political stability., Much the same sen!J:ment was echoed by Professor Sharlet. He too saw NiXon•s.pllasedunilateral withdrawal as being one of the onl.y alternative policies 'left to the u.s.· goyernment. If we con- tinue in this manner, Sharlet feels that the North Vietnamese will prevail, the Communists will unify the .cauntry and employ the system C)f moderllization to re- build the war damages. Another set of alternatives, similar to those already stated, was .presented byProfesso:rGati. In his estimation, the u.s. bas two al~rnatives; a victory bythe extension of l:lle war~ thus inviting a Chinese reacticn, or a. «faster defeat\ which would involve immediate withdra:w.~. Last to speak on this question was Professor Jonas, who indicated that the U.S. policy of phased withdrawal is \the only policy to follow.\ Jonas also viewed winning the war as an impossibility, and said that the Cambodian venture tended to delude Nixon's withdrawaJ plans. • DIENSIS history.

Vorenberg Advocates Courts Change Points to Lack of Formal Guidelines RICHARD E. PATTERSON, JR Professor James Vorenberg, of Harvard Law School, called for sweeping reforms to correct the \arbitrary and unfair exercises of unchecked personal dis- cretion\ by officials of the criminal justice system in the United States in a talk here M:on- day. S.peaking on 11 Alternatives to the Criminal Justice System,\ Prof. Vorenberg charged ihat policemen, prosecutors, judges, prison wardens and other officials daily make decisions affecting citizens'lives which are governed by no formal rules and subject to no formal review to protect individual rights. This, he said, is especially noteworthy because, formally, the judicial system is assumed to be \ruled by laws, not by men, • with .little room for the exercise of individual discretion. Policemen on patrol, Voren- berg said, have no formal, stated rules concerning when to make an arrest or use force. Vorenberg noted that public prosecutors a 1 so have m u c h Fein· And. Ouzer Retire; Weingold Concordy Chief In voting last evening, Peter J. Weingold, a Junior Biology major from Little Neck, New Yo r k, was elected Editor-in- Chief of CONCORDIENSIS. He succeeds Henry Fein and William Ouzer, also juniors, who have jointly held the position since January oi this year. Both Fein and Ouzer intend te> stay with the ninety-three year old paper. Weingoldhas appointed them to important positions on. his Senior Board. Ouzer will return to the position of Managing Editor, a post he last held in his sophomore year·, and Fein will become Executive Editor .. The newly elected Editor also announced the appointmEnt of Louis Snitkoff '73 as Ne-ws CONCORDY career as a sports- writer. He moved through the ranks .as Assistant Sports Editor and Sports Editor in his sopho- more year and Managing Editor during Fall Term of this year. Ouzer, a Philosophy m a j o r from Rochester New York, has served as Assistant Managing Editor, Managing Editor, Acting Editor (during a brief bout with illness by former editor Neil Kramer), Executive Editor and finally Editor-in-Chief in his three year association with the paper.

C::ONCORDY sta:ffer, will remain on the Senior Board as Contributing Editor. discretion in deciding whether or not to prosecute cases, what the charge will be, and what sentence to recommend to the judge. Prison wardens have \virtually unbridled discretion\ to decide the kind of program and treat- ment prisoners receive, and when they will be released on parole. Professor Vorenberg charged that decisions w it h important effects on person's lives are based not on considerations of right or wrong, or what is best for the prisoner or society, but on the needs of the criminal justice system. All but the most serious criminal cases should be diverted from the full criminal process as ear 1 y as possible, Professor Vorenberg said. An alternative which be cited was the Manhattan Court Employment Project in New York City, where defendants are offered a job and, if necessary, psychiatric help in- stead of jail. He also urged that alternatives to prison such a.s a release to work in the community in the day with return to prison at night, followed by weekends at home, and a gradual re-entry u;to society be employed to give prisoners \maximum responsi- bility for t11eii' own lives as early as possible,\ He coupled these with calls for formal rules to c he c k the wide discretion of officials and the potential for its abuse within the criminal justice system.

The elections were challenged by Donald Clarey on the grounds that they were poorly publicized (only about two hundred votes were cast), that therewereballot irregularities, and that to have held them at all violated the expressed sentiment of the col- lege against \business as usual\ following President Nixon•s sending of troops into Cambodia on April 30. Elections for upper- class Officers were tentatively rescheduled for next September. Coupled with the motion to increase the student tax was a provision to allocate $18,000 of the $23,000 of the new activity funds to the Social Committee for next year's budget. The proposed tax increase must be approved by the Board of Trustees, which will consider the matter at its meeting during Commencement Weekend, June 12-14, A resolution favoring the attendance of the president and vice president of the Senate at all full Board of Trustees meet- ings was also approved, The resolution also called for the election of younger men to the Board \in the interests of tlw college.\ A motion to a:Uocate $15.0 of the Senate's own funds to subsidize the bus fares e>f students a.nct faculty who went to lobby in Washington earlier this week was defeated after an often heated debate. Two constitutions came before the S e n a t e for approval. The constitution of the Student Com- mittee for an Alternative View- point (SCAV), ua vehicle for the presentation <Jf c on s e rvative views on campus,\ was approved with the stipulation that it expires June 30, 1970. The constitution of the Social Relief Committee, which offers services to the needy of the Schenectady area, was.also approved. The Senate's Tuition Com- mittee presented a seriesofpro- posals, stating that «in all matters dealing with expenses at Trustee meetings, students be represented b:y the president and vice president of the S tude n t Senate.\ It was also proposed that a standing Student-Faculty com- mittee \to check unnecessary expenses at Unlon\ be appointed. The report further expressed the opinion that when increased ex- penses are planned, students should be notified as soon as possible. The report was approved. The Senate also voted to include the names of tlle two black Jack- son .State students killed by police on that campus with thl1 names of the four Kent State students shot by national guardsmen in Ohio. The names will be placed on a plaque to be mounted at the base of the college flag pole. There will be a very important me e tin g for all members of the Mountebanks on Monday, June 1, at 7 p.JJi. in the Green Room of the Nott Memorial Theatre to discuss next year's plays. Anyone may attend.

PAGE 2 CONCORD /EN SIS, MAY 28, 1970 To the Student Body, Letters to the Outgoing Editors In the wake of intensified stu· dent protest and concern over national affairs, and in the calm before the fury of .finals and the relief of summer adventures, I would like to ask all of you to consider for a moment the plight of some of the less fortunate y a un ge r people of the Schen- ectady area. There are 33 younger children, aged 10-14, who attend special classes at Riverside Elementary School. Over one-half of these kids come from severely under- privileged homes. Fifteenofthem are slightly retarded or have difficult emotional problems. Of the other 18, almost all have other special learning problems of their own. They are getting an adequate schooling experience, but few if any of them have the opportunity for the refreshing and educational experience which can be provided by an overnight camping trip. The teachers would like to do it this year, as they have in the past. However, this year their fund drive fell way shortoftheamount needed. The School Board will provide no funds. They need help, In the next few days, interested people will be coming around to your rooms. I ask at least con- sideration by all, perhaps the change in your pocket by some, A minimum of $75 is needed for food and e quip m en t-anything collected above this can easily be used~ STEPHEN WAHL \72 * * * * To the Editors: We would like to express our thanks to all thosewhohavemade the introduction of Camp Ed 49, and the Hebrew language program possibleo Our thanks go to Presi- dent Martin, and Professor Klemm, chairman of the Modern Language Department, for their assistance and cooperation, Our special thanks go to Professor Stephen Berk o'f the History Department, our advisor, without whose hard work our hopes would never have left the planning stage. TilE OFFICERS OF HILLEL * * * * To the Editors: I have recently observed individual campus police raiSing the campus flag after it was lowered by some unknown person, presumably a student. Then one of the \campus' finest\ stood guard vigilantly over the :flag to be sure it remained at full staff. If our college is so orderly that the campus police have n o t h i n g more consistent with police work to do than raise flags and guard the :flag pole, then someone is to be congratu- lated. At the same time may I suggest that, if this is the case, a couple of the campus police be retired, In their place could be hired a non-professional to simply «guard the flag,\ and the college might realize con- siderable savings.

It was quitedis- maying, though, to find that so. many of the latter took what I wrote as a persona:! affront to their concern for the preserva- tion of basic human liberties. Per haps, they have betrayed their paranoia of those whose political beliefs present a chal- lenge to their own. So much ·for the more re- sponsible espousers of \Libera- lism>'~ on this campus. I'd like now to turn attention to the letter printed in the May 22nd issue of CONCORDIENSIS writ t e l1 by Mark E. Klein, The author opened with an attack {by no means overwhelming) on \the arguments ,presented by Mr. Bonventre in support o~ President Nixon's policies in Indochina •• • n, Where, Mr. Klein, did I even make re- ference to the President's policies in Indochina, let alone support them? (Although support them I do,) He continues with such inanities like equating the terms I spoke of, ~traciSm 11 , \fascism\, \'imperialism\, etc., with common slogans used to unify a movement •such as Right On\. And he winds up. his efforts by reassuring me th.a t Abbie Hoffman will not take over this nation. It is, nevertheless, gratifying that the Student Committee for an Alternative Viewpoint, and our publication, Viewpaint, have been met for the most part with a healthy response. · VINCENT BONVENTRE '71 * * * * To the Editors: I'm afraid that Ray Krise, Jr,~ in his exuberance to stereo-type and scorn many concerned people on this campus, has been carried away with his emotions and has created what I consider careless and irresponsible journ;.Uism. I refer specifically to his •com- ments\ iJt the May 22 issue of CONCORDY. There were marshals at the K u n s t1 e r Convocation for one reason and one reason only, It was not because Strike Central was planning on running the show, perish the thought. Strike Central had NOTHING to do with it inthat sense. But Professor Olton, head of the program, and Mr. Klein- kauf, Chief ofSecurity, requested that marshals be there. Re- quested, do I make my point? Professor Olton originally wanted 100 marshals. Dis- cussions with him and Mr. Klein .. kauf reduced this number to less than fifty. So, rather than forcing ourselves upon the college com- munity, our presence was by all appeal from a part .of the com- munity. If student marshals were not there, policewo\Jldhavebeen. Though fewer in number, their presence might have been more troublesome. The arrangements for mar- shals and seating were worked out beforehand. The first two rows were saved for security pre- cautions. Since there was no trouble it might seem a moot point, but at the time it was a viable possibility that had to be properly dealt with.

But I did know that the chairmen could act as marshals if need be, and so they helped provide a possible buffer between Kuns tler and the audience. I must say again that the plans were worked out beforehand with MeSsrs. Olton and Kleinkauf. Some specific points: 1-Idid not makethestatement I was quoted as saying. Please be more careful in the future. 2-There were eight wo111en from Skidmore acting as mar- shals who had been trained l>Y students from Union. Girls are qualified to be marshals and they did serve sl.,lccessfully in such a capacity ~;~reviousiy. 3-Marshals are not impotent, (I might have been too busy to explain at the. time) as can be exampled by any activity in which they have been used and trouble has occurred, e.g. the marches and demonstrations in D~C., New York, and Albany. 4-Marshals were also re- quested for the news conference by Professor Olton.

PAGE 2 CONCORD lENS IS, MAY 28, 1970 To the Student Body, Letters to the Outgoing Editors In the wake of intensified stu- dent protest and concern over national affairs, and in the calm before the fury of finals and the relief of summer adventures, I would like to ask all of you to consider for a moment the plight of some of the less fortunate y o u n g e r people of the Schen- ectady area. There are 33 younger children, aged 10-14, who attend special classes at Riverside Elementary School. Over one-half of these kids come from severely under~ privileged homes. Fifteen ofthem are slightly retarded or have difficult emotional problems. Of the other 18, almost all have other special learning problems of their own. They are getting an adequate schooling experience, but few if any of them have the opportunity for the refreshing and educational experience which can be provided by an overnight camping trip, The teachers would like to do it this year, as they have in the past. However, this year their fund drive fell way shortoftheamount needed. The School Board will provide no funds. They need help. In the next few days, interested people will be coming around to your rooms. I ask at least con- sideration by all, perhaps the change in your pocket by some. A minimum of $75 is needed for food and e q u i p m en t-anything collected above this can easily be used. STEPHEN WAHL '72 * * * * To the Editors: We would like to express our thanks to all those who have made the introduction of Comp Ed 49, and the Hebrew language program possible. Our thanks go to Presi- dent Martin, and Professor Klemm, chairman of the Modern Language Department, for their assistance and cooperation. Our special thanks go to Professor S t e ph en Berk o'f the History Department, our advisor, without whose hard work our hopes would never have left the planning stage. THE OFFICERS OF HILLEL * * * * To the Editors: I have recently observed individual campus police raising the campus flag after it was lowered by some unknown person, presumably a student. Then one of the \campus' finest\ stood guard vigilantly over the flag to be sure it remained at full staff. If our college is so orderly that the campus police have not h in g more consistent with police work to do than raise flags and guard the flag pole, then someone is to be congratu- lated, At the same time II!ay I suggest that, if this is the case, a couple of the campus police be retired. In their place could be hired a non-professional to simply \guard the flag,\ and the college might realize con- siderable savings. RICHARD E. pATTERSON I JR. '70 Published T u e s day and Friday during the School year by the Student Body of Union College, Schenec· tady, N.Y. Natiol!al Adver· tising Representative National Educational Advertising Service, Inc., College Publishers Repre- sentative, 360 Lexington Avenue, N.Y.C. To the Editors: We, the students of the Student- Grapefruit allowance, demand and hunger to clearly adumbrate some of the vacillating d'irecti ves and interests that have been so firmly dislodged, or shall we say congealed, last week during the past few months. And we are not without presidents. Sub- sequently, we noted that their is a superficial lack of dynamic and reduced amplifications ofthe major processes of field sociali- zation as applied to the eco- catastrophe in the heating system, a corallary of Which has been highly reported to us by mandible sources close to the capillary. And in conclusion, we do not, nor have we ever ascribed to any transmigrationofthe interior U-HAUL @ $29.00 of formerly held commissions. We have noted the pronation and suppination of the committee, we had a uniformly callouse response and interpretation. Bethatasitmay, notwithstanding, we state with a modicum of assurety that ulti- mately, which is to say, routinely, we will, nay we have, recipro- cated many times, no, more than that, to the scintilations (ding, dong, ding) of the coprophagus few, who served so well, ana nightly continued to do so. Of course, space does not allow us to give further elaborationtothis peregrine complication. U n t i 1 then, we have only predisposed the Eastern Standard Methodo- logy introduced to this country by Prof. Pabe (E. M. P., C,N, 74, 20-20, and in the Bronx call col- lect). Detailed as the corpse of future events, we the exponents of the doctrine of tropism, do hereby move to besmirch in the welts of the Mohawk, and officiously decry and discredit the schizophrenic language de- stroyers who are abortionally and anthropomorphically now, in the present, the predominant pur- veyors of power, We thus remain as never be- fore (but never so purely until this moment), Wilbur the Elder Friar Submaximus X,O St. Trochee, the _toussed of Toulouse and sometimes of Teheran Semantius Corlinuis Jackie Jackie Spiritus Fermentae Ring Ting 0' Leavio, e.s.p, Signed for· the committee at 1 a r g e who w i s h to remain anonymous * * * * To the Editors: The reaction to my article in Viewpoint concerning \re- pression\ was quite dis- appointing, although, admittedly, not entire 1 y surprising. The article was, of course, an attack on the irrationality, the insanity of the radical far left, It was certainly not intended to be an attack on the intellectually re- sponsible members of the liberal community at Union College (or Editorial Office, Old Gym, Union College Publication Office, The World Publica• tions, 771 State St., Schenectady, N.Y. 12307, 346-2356. Entered in the Schenectady Post Office as Second Class Mail Matter Subscription 20 cents a copy. $6 a year delivered anywhere in the United States. in this country). It was quite dis- maying, though, to find that so many of the latter took what I wrote as a personal affront to their concern for the preserva- tion of basic human liberties. Perhaps, they have betrayed their paranoia of those whose political beliefs present a chal- lenge to their own. So much for the more re- sponsible espousers of 11 Libera- lism11 on this campus. I'd like now to turn attention to the letter printed in the May 22nd issue of CONCORDIENSIS writ ten by Mark E. Klein. The author opened with an attack (by no means overwhelming) on \the arguments presented by Mr. Bonventre in support of President Nixon's policies in Indochina ••• \. Where, Mr. Klein, did I even make re- ference to the Pres ident•s policies in Indochina, let alone support them? (Although support them I do.) He continues with such inanities like equating the terms I spoke of, 14 racism\ \fascism 11 , \imperialism\, etc., with common slogans used to unify a movement \such as Right onn. And he winds up his efforts by reassuring me that Abbie Hoffman will not take over this nation. It is, nevertheless, gratifying that the Student Committee for an Alternative Viewpoint, and our publication, Viewpoint, have been met for the most part with a healthy response. VINCENT BONVENTRE '71 * * * * To the Editors: I'm afraid that Ray Krise, Jr., in his exuberance to stereo-type and scorn many concerned people on this campus, has been carried away with his emotions and has created what I consider careless and irresponsible journalism. I refer specifically to his •com- ments\ in the May 22 issue of CONCORDY. There were marshals at the K u n s t1 e r Convocation for one reason and one reason only, It was not because Strike Central was planning on running the show, perish the thought. Strike Central had NOTHING to do with it in that sense. But Professor Olton, head of the program, and Mr. Klein- kauf, Chief of Security, requested that marshals be there. Re- quested, do I make my point? P r o f e s s o r 0 1t on originally wanted 100 marshals. Dis- cussions with him and Mr. Klein- kauf reduced th~ i:luml)er to le$5 than fifty. So, rather than forcing ourselves upon the college com- munity, our presence was by an appeal from a part of tile com- munity. If student marshalswere not there, police would have been. Though fewer in number, their presence might have been more troublesome. The arrangements for mar- shals and seating were worked out beforehand. The first two rows were saved for security pre- cautions. Since there was no trouble it might seem a moot point, but at the time it was a viable possibility that had to be properly dealt with. My Monday morning quarterbacking is not retroactive. DIAMANTE'S Enjoy Ovr Fine Home Cooked Italian food in Ou1 C6mfortobl·e Dining Room Opp. Th• Brown•ll Gate on NoH Str .. t Open Doily 1 0 to 1 A.M. Sundayt 5 P M. to 1 A.M. The fact that chairmen would sit up front with marshals was possibly in error. But I did lrnow that the chairmen could act as marshals if need be, and so they helped provide a possible buffer b e t w e e n K u n s t 1 e r and the audience. I must say again that the plans were worked out beforehand with Messrs. Olton and Kleinkauf. Some specific points: 1-I did not make the statement I was quoted as ·saying. Please be more careful in the future. 2-There were eight women from Skidmore acting as mar- shals who had been trained by students from Union. Girls are qualified to be mars hal s and they did serve successfully in such a capacity previously. 3-Marshals are not impotent, (I might have been too busy to explain at the time) as can be exampled by any activity in which they have been used and trouble has occurred, e.g. the marches and demonstrations in D. C., New York, and Albany. 4-Marshals were also re- quested for the news conference by Professor Olton. He asked that marshals check for press passes. I'm terribly sorry if any Con- cordy staff member was tvoubled producing his, As far as the strike being a clique, it is. A clique, Mr. ~ise, of people who want to work to- gether in a loose confederation to produce the best possible re- sults. If you feel left out of the \group 1 ' (and I really don't think it exists as such) there is a plethora of ways you can become involved, even by becoming a marshal (training sessions will continue on campus). It seems easy and stylish to comment on how p o or 1 y things are being accomplished, whether it be at Strike Central or in the u.s. (Nixon was elected that way), but it is another to be actively con- structive. The disease you speak of, then, seems not to be in Silliman Hall, but at various spots around the campus. HOWARD BLANK, '70 To the Student Body: Although most students have already completed their course selections fer nextyear, we would like to take this opportunity to encourage students to consider altering their choices and en- rolling in Section 5 of the Comp. Ed. Project offerings. \The In- fluence of Demography on Com- munity Development,\ taught by Prof. We 11 s, offers a unique exp·e rien c e for research in a relatively untried field-a field which has great relevance to many of the problems facing this country and the world today. It is a course which can effec- tively use the talents of majors from many disciplines, and one which has the fle~ibility to adjust to particular student interests. We realize that it is usually unnecessary for students to speak in defense of an excellent course. However, advertising of course offerings has recently been pion- eered in CONCORDIENSIS, and in light of criticism of Comp. Ed •. projects in general, we felt this letter would be justified. We encourage interested stu- dents to speak with Prof. Wells in the Social Sciences Building for further information. In a time when students are demand- ing courses that are pertinent to the problems of our society, \Demography\ cannot be over- looked.

If you will remember, last week I criticized the Strike cen- tral marshals for being a:t the Kunstler convocation. As could be .expected, I -received some c o m m en t s on tnat view. One especially interesting commen- tor-a marshal-said that secur- ity head Kleinkauf gave Union the choice of having either stu- dent marshals or the Schenec- tady police present at the speech. If that's true, then the proper choice was made; but it brings up a further point:. WHY should any choice have been offered in the first place? Who are the students of Union College, that they can be trusted no more than can a pack of wolves? The answer, apparently, is that not only are students too wild (read \idealistic 01 ), but that we are all alike (after all, Kunstler spoke at Santa Barbara, and the kids THERE burned down the Bank of America; imagine the Marcus WelbY; George of the Jungle, Dick Cavett; David Frost, 60 Minutes; :{lill Cosby, Room 222, ABC Movie of the Week, The Bold Ones, Sesame Street.

He must make everything appear to be running smoothly to the Trustees, Alumni, and Com- munity, while at the same time dealing with student needs as honestly and accurately as possi- ble. Our own presidept, Harold c. Martin, is an educated, elo- quent, capable, impressive indi- vidual. That is why I find it difficult to understand WHY IN HELL WASN'T HE GOING TO LET KUNSTLER SPEAK? Had Martin's initial impulse come .to fruition, it would have been by far the biggest blunder in the whole series surrounding this tragicomic convocation.

HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN ; you figured out a thesaurus wasn't a dinosaur, you discovered that a Communist guerrilla wasn't a Red ape, you realized that the American Indian got a raw deal, you proved that M&M' s could melt in your hand, you stopped carrying around a crucifix in case you ran into Bela Lugosi, you started thinking blacks were 14 different\ than whites, you realized that the actors on tele- vision weren't inside the TV set, you discovered killing people wasn't cool! We're not done with the William Kunst 1 e r convocation yet, sar- casm fans. There is still one factor--un men t io ned in last week's column-that needs dis- cussion: the Administration. Ii you will remember, last week I criticized the Strike Cen- tral marshals for being at the Kunstler convocation. As could be expected, I received some comments on that view. One especially interesting commen- tor-a marshal-said that secur- ity head Kleinkauf gave Union the choice of having either stu- dent marshals or the Schenec- tady police present at the speech. If that's true, then the proper choice was made; but it brings up a further point: WHY should any choice have been offered in the first place? Who are the students of Union College, that they can be trusted no more than can a pack of wolves? The answer, apparently, is that not only are students too wild (read \idealistic\), but that we are all alike (after all, Kunstler spoke at Santa Barbara, and the kids THERE burned down the Bank of America; imagine the Marcus Welby, George of the Jungle, Dick Cavett, David Frost, 60 Minutes, Bill Cosby, Room 222, ABC Movie ()f the Week, The Bold Ones, Sesame Street.

He must make everything appear to be running srnoothly to the Trustees, Alurnni, and Com- munity, while at the same time dealing with student needs as honestly and accurately as possi- ble. Our own president, Harold C. Martin, is an educated, elo- quent, capable, impressive indi- vidual. That is why I find it difficult to understand WHY IN HELL WASN'T HE GOING TO LET KUNSTLER SPEAK? Had Martin's initial impulse come to fruition, it would have been by far the biggest blunder in the whole series surrounding this tragicomic convocation, During the past few weeks, our faculty members have been beat- ing into our heads the fact that the colleges are the only remain- ing s anc tuar ie s for open dis- course, and so would you kids please cool it for awhile so the government doesn't take THAT away from us.

Miss Krupsak is a Liberal Democrat and the incumbent in the 104th As se m b 1 y District which includes part of Schenec- tady, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and the towns in between. Miss Krupsak is in trouble with her Church and community for her affirmative vote on the recently passed Abortion Bill. She is facing strong Republican opposition in a district which had long been dominated by Republi- cans until her upset victory in 1968. She is one of four women and one of the few upstate Demo- crats serving in the Assembly. Mary Ann Krupsak is a young, bright and articulate lawyer with a great deal of previous govern- ment experience at the state and federal levels. She earned her B.A. at Rochester in History and Music, holds anM.S, inCom- munications from Boston Univer- sity, and received her law degree from Chicago.

PAGE 4 CONCORDIENSJS, MAY 28 , 1970 Concordy Sports Grid Star Swan Athlete Of 'The Year BY BILL HOLLERAN Rich Swan, a record-shatter- ing fo o t b a 11 sta · r during his three-year varsity athletic career at Union, has been chosen the 1969-1970 CONCORDlENSIS Athlete Of The Year. Swan, who set two career receiving marks and s . hattered two season pass- catching records while at Union, joins Greg Olson (l967), Sam Dill (1968), and Bill Neidel (1969) in the Athlete Of The Year win- ner's circle. Swan came to Union from Elmira, New York, where he played football and ran track at Elmira Free Academy. \Not a big star,\ Swa.n lettered two years in football as a wingback and lettered all four years in track as a quarter-miler. As a senior trackman at Elmira, Swan fin- ished second in his section in the quarter~mile and. went on to the State Championships . Swan played freshman football at Union, but it _was not until his sophomore year that he blos- some.d into a star performer on the gridiron. As a sophomore, the blond, bespectacled split · end grabbed 50 passes for 735 yards and eight touchdowns.

Swan ' s eight touchdo-wll.s also shattered Art Matshall~s one-season mark Yell ow jackets Whip Batsmen Rochester ' s Yellowjackets pummelled two Garnet pitchers for thirteen llits , including two mammoth home runs, en route to a 6-2 win,over the Union nine last Friday. The loss dropped the Garnet• s final . record to a win~ ning 8-6 mark. Pitching, however, proved to be a definite problem on Friday as Hank Lambert, already a two game loser, was knock\'ld about handily by the Rocheste r batters for seven hits in five innings. Rochester parlayed two singles and an error by centerfielder John Quirk into a solo tally in the top of tlle first, and added another run in the second on a home run to straightaway left by shortstop Mike Copanas. The Yellowja.ckets drove Lam- bert off the inound in the fifth inning, bunching t~ree hits together to score three runs. The first two batters connected for singles, artd 1eftfielder Rene Piccaretto cleared the bases with a gargantuan .homer to center field. Kevin Coyne relieved Lam- bert in the siXth inning. Meanwhile, The Dutchmen could managE only single tallies in the first a.nd ninth innings, In the first, Quirk singled, stole second, and moved over to third on Bob Mitchell's groundoilt to short. Ken- :Pearce followed with a grounder to third, but the low tlirow skipped away from first base allowing Quirk to score standing up. Bob Mackenzie, Bernhardt and Mike McGee punched singles in the final stanza, and Coy~e;s s a c r if ice fiy to deep center brought in the run. of 6 TDs registered in 1963, and. gave him the team lead in scoring. Be was just~y rewarded for his sta:.rry labors that season, m~ing the weekly All-ECAC Division III team four time'S during the sea- son, more than any other player in the Division. Swan won the honor twice as Sophomo:te-Qf .. The- Week and twice as a split end, To cap the season Swan was named the Pivision nrsophomore -Of-The-Year,, and was barelY . beaten out for Player-of-The- · Year by tackle Jolui Gloistein of Wagner--a first team Little All- A,merican.

The all-freshmen quartet failed to make the Satur- day f i nals, however, · because of an. inadeq1,1ate arr~gement ofthe semi-final trials. · The team of Al Pry sunka, Greg Hamlin, Geoff Walker, and Tim Mc:Cabe had the s.iXth fastest time goinf1; into the finals, Tlieir 3:21 clocking · normally would ha:ve qualified them for the Satur- day run-off, The finals, though, were decided by picking . the top th.ree finishers in each semi- final event, and the Union team had placed fifth in their obviously loaded heat. Thus the Gar n e · t failed to qualify for the finals aitllough having run faster than two of the other teams that eventually made the champions)lip event. Once again, Tim McCabe was the stand-out performer for the Dutchmen. The freshman, named tile most val,ual:>le member of the track team by Coach Ron Cole- man, ran his anchor leg in a phenomenal 48.4 seconds.
