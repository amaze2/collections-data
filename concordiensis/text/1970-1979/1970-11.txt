Freedom :forum Announces Talks On Current Issues Dean Martin Lichterman of the Freedom Forum, has announced the remainder of a series of five talks on nation- wide issues to be given this year. The topics include conservative tides in national·politics, the U.S. space program, recent social revolutions including the women's liberation movement, and long-range trends in East Asia. Freedom Forum is a non- profit, non-partisan organization devoted to public scrutiny of current issues of majo-r importance at home and abroad. nuclear power programs and is currently working in Brazil, Argentina, and South Korea. The IAEA offers the countries equipment and technical assistance. Dr. Friedman commented that the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission contributes the overwhelming majority of equipment to the International agency. Problems tackled by the international group include the use of atomic energy in insect eradication and \crop and soil management.\ The new Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty is going to drastically change the role of the lAEA, Friedman said. The treaty gives the IAEA the responsibility of safeguarding all nuclear material transferred between countries and making sure that the material is not diverted to military purposes.

Murphy In democratic societies elections don't guarantee that the · best .man will win, only that the · · voters will get the candidate they · prefer. Often they tell -us little about what people are thinking. What does 1t mean if they choose Tweedledum over Tweedledee? But this year we've already learned a lot, even though, as these words are being written, the election is five days away. Barring an almost impossible last- minute switch of votes, it now • appears that James Buckley, Conservative Party candidate for the United States Senate, will 1 N. OTE: ~o+h li.

CONN By LES GOLDMAN · Last spring it was thought Jhat · be.cause of the Cambo~ian ' intervention called for by President Nixon there would be a massive infusion of young people working in political campaigns in • the fall. This has apparently not · been the case throughout most of the country. To find out what has been happening on Union's campus, this reporter talked to two students who were involved in two of the organizations that appeared on campus last spring: • Mark Coven from Strike Central, which opposed President Nixon's intervention, and Steve Pierce from the Student Committee for an Alternative Viewpoint (SCA V) total vote cast for that office. 1 l Hi\WA\1 d.r-e.. ~ech\') ci ..

Truman To Buckley perhaps to be the largest in the state's history, is sigllificant in providing a clear insight into the minds of the voters on at least one issue - that of our presence in southeast Asia. The two major party candidates, Charles Goodell and Richard Ottinger, despite· other differences, have presented a united front on the issue. They both want us to get out, today if not sooner, and they would like to reduce the power of the American President to move as he sees fit in foreign~ affairs. In the opening months of the campaign each paid for expensive advertisements to· prove that he had arrived at this position before his opponent. Now, suddenly. they have discovered -Tweedledum as on other issues - drugs, crime in the streets, taxes - and all indications are that it will be a two-man contest. Paul Adams, the Conservative Party running- mate of Mr. Buckley, sharing the dome&tic views of his partner, is trailing badly. Clearly, in ch!)osing Buckley while disregarding Adams the voter is making a discriminating selection. Perhaps the so-called \liberals\ and \academics\ who were so powerful in the government of the United States until they gave it away to Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew two years ago ought to listen to what the voter is saying. Liberal's Confession By ALFRED THIMM Tweedledee they have driven voters into Mr. Buckley's camp. Meanwhile, in the gubernatorial campaign, Rockefeller and Goldberg, having expressed the customary ritual concern about Vietnam expected of all office~seekers these days, are running the race As I see it, the failure of Goodell and Ottinger lies in their misunderstanding of what the American people think about southeast Asia. They have confused the cries of the so-called \doves\ with the voice of the peoplt::~ Discontent with the situation in which we find ourselves in southeast Asia is widespread and cuts across . all Continued on Page 6 ,. In Concordiensis' election issue Professor Murphy analyzes New York State politics from a \liberal\ point of view, while I am to present the \conservative\ viewpoint. How meaningless the terms \conservative\ and \liberal\ have become is clearly shown by the fact that Professor Murphy and I probably share common ·views on a large number of issues facing us - including Mr. Stratton's reelection; as a matter of fact, Professor Murphy would hardly be accepted today as a proper spokesman by the orthodox knee-jerk \liberal\, while most American \conservatives\ find my views highly uncomfortable. But then some of the most totalitarian elitists in American life hide Agnew: The S 1ro of '72 By MANFRED JONAS American off-year elections rarely earn more than a line or two in our history books. If that of 1970 proves to be an exception to the rule, it will undoubtedly be because President Nixon has chosen to turn it into a referendum on his concept of national priorities, and has assigned a major role in this effort to Vice-President Agnew, a man who combines an extraordinary expansiveness of rhetoric with an equall.Y remarkable narrowness of vision. Whether or not Mr. Agnew began his onslaught on television pundits, on the Wa!!hiilgton and New York press, on student bs oppointccl dissenters, and on \radical L---~--JJ!r.~l~!~::-l!:i!.~~r..r9:~.qr.j~u.,\;:_···--~·::.:_ __ __, ______ :....;.;.!; liberals'' in general simply out of frustration induced by the poWerlessness of the office which he holds, or in an attempt to relieve the tedium of one-night st~nds on the politica'l banquet circuit is a matter of little consequence. What does matter, is that the enthusiastic response which his initial forays evoked and the banner headlines which ; his alliterative sallies produced in newspapers througho~t the nation convinced the President and the Republican party leadership that he represented a potent weapon in the battle to create a stable electoral majority which could assure Republican plitical dominance for the foreseeable future. It persuaded them, moreover, that, despite much historical evidence to the contmry, the election of 1970 would provide a favorable battleground. The resulting assault on the voters has proceeded on two fronts, on both of which the Vice- President has clearly led the charge. On the one hand, the national Republican leadership has made an attempt to define the issues for the men and women running in local or state- wide races, and on the other hand it is trying to remove from office those men, regardless of party, who have been most vocal and most effective in their opposition to policies to which the Administration has given the highest priority. In defining the issues largely, though not entirely, through the speeches of Mr. Agnew, it has attempted to create the impression that the pressing problems facing the country. are not the plight of the poor and the black, not the rapid deterioration of our cities and our environment, not the combination of inflation and increasing unemployment, and not the expenditure of vast resources in time, energy, and money in a needless and senseless war, but rather the dissatisfaction, dissent, and occasional violence which prevailing conditions have produced among a sizeable, if probably minority segment of the American people. More than that, it has attempted to disassociate these symptoms entirely from the conditions which actually have produced them, by tracing them instead to alleged \permissiveness\ on the part of liberal college administrators and politicians, Continued on Page 6 today under the \liberal\ label, while the bulk of American \conservatives\ are latter day Whigs who complain about high taxes while profitably cooperating with the Washington bureaucracy in creating, for the first time in history, both an affluent majority and a decaying environment. How has it happened that two party ties, political labels, and ideologies have lost all taxonomic mean,ing? The Concordiensis thought that my own p'olitical experience might provide some clues. My political life began in 1.948 when I voted with great enthusiasm for Harty Truman in my first Presidential election, and I am happy to say that I have never lost my enthqsiasm and admiration .for toqgh old Harry, who managed to remedy the most serious consequences of the foreign and domestic blunders of the last Roosevelt administration in the face of the irresponsible behavior of the Republican majority of the 80th Congress. During the next Presidential election I supported Stevenson and was appalled at the political naivite of Eisenhower and the Republican parties. It is worthwhile to emphasize that both in 1952 and 1956 Stevenson and the Democrats were the hawks, and Eisenhower and the Republicans, the doves!! (In Korea it was difficult to tell North Korean propaganda braodcasts from the editorials in the Chicago Tribune. Both Republicans and Communists referred to this successful containment of aggresi ve Stalinism as \Truman's War\ and both applauded Eisenhower's phony peace gesture of \going to Korea if elected.'') In 1960 I voted, with some misgivings, for Kennedy, who attacked the Eisenhower administration for permitting a \missile gap\ to develop - a charge which turned out to be completely false, and held them responsible for the establishment of a Communist dictatorship in Cuba. Kennedy also promised immediate rearmament and an increase in America's corwentional weapon's stystems, one of the few promises he actually kept. (In the summer of 1959, the liberal, Democratic Advisory Committee wing of the party, a voice vis a vis its more conservative Congressional leadership, sharply criticized the Eisenhower administration for Continued on Page 6 Coven said that, l11 general, there has not been much campaign Work done by the people who were involved in Strike Central. He did state that over the summer five people worked in Washington; one worked in the Congressional Clearinghouse and the other four worked as congressional interns. Coven attributed this to .. the direct results of last spring's strike activity.\ He also mentioned the existence of the movement for a New Congress which h~s 60 students doing phone canvassing for Dan Button's congressional campaign. However, he pointed ou~ that the majority of the students involved in last spring's anti-war activities are not getting into this fall's campaigns. \It is not apathy, people have given up on the system. Even if liberal politicians are elected nothip.g really changes. The system seems to have become too big and complex to change.\ In answer to the question of what the consequences of a Buckley-Stratton win would mean in terms of student· participation in politics, Co,·cn indicated that this would probably convince even more people of the difficulty of effecting change through the system. On the other side of the political spectrum, the situation appears much the same but for different reasons. Steve Pierce, who worked on the Student Committee for an Alternative Viewpoint (SCA V) indicated that the reason SCA V is not active as an organization in this fall's campaign is that it was never structured as a permanent organization. Pierce said that \it was set up solely on a ad hoc basis without any intention of ever supporting any one Continued on Page 6 Special Issue This special supplement of the Coneordiensis has been drawn up as an election night guide to accompany the returns of local, state and national elections. A detailed, state by state run-down of the 35 races for the United States Senate and the electing of 35 governors is presented in the centerfold along with selected races for Congress and local New York state elections. Along with this fact sheet are several election-oriented articles presenting diverse opinions on what has been happening in the campaign of 1970. From the disillusionment of the old line liberals and the dismay of many college students to the effect of Spiro Agnew and the growing influence of tele'\lision in politics, this is what we have as the country votes and waits.

Continuea from Page 4 a~oid the. neceSsity of givmg a forum to fringe candidates, the 'broadcasters prefer not to offer very much free time to major candidates. In effect the candidates structure political communications on the basis of how much money they are willing to spend. If this is one horn of the broadcasters' dilemma, then the other is that they clearly do not serve ''the public interest\ when they make it difficult for serious candidates to secure the television time necessary to present their arguments. Federal regulation seems to be the only solution, but there is little agreement as to what should be done. President Nixon's recent veto fo a bill which would have alleviated some of the thorny problems associated with expenditures- on television time was a regrettable action. Almost any movement off dead center is preferable to remaining in the morass in which we presently find ourselv~s. There are two points which I wish to make before conclu4ing this little discussion: One, that the role of television in American politics is certain to increase over the next few decades; two, that there is nothing inherently ·pernicious about the use of TV in the course of electoral campaxgnmg. Quite to the contrary, in a society inevitably captured by technology a heavy reliance on non-personal modes of communication is quite natural. No one can foretell whether the ancient and honorable candidate practice of \pressing the flesh\ with crowds of voters is destined for oblivion, but it has become clear that such expenditures of time by major candidates are relatively unproductive. and Fong.

Contrary to some unexamined assumptions of the \dove:. very few people are in favor of war there or anywhere else. But to offer as a solution unilateral American disengagement accompanied by public breast- beatings and confessions .of remorse for sins committed is of course no solution at all and it is one the American people won't buy. It is the end-product of the faulty analys-is of our involvement as \immoral\ and \imperialist\ and \racist.\ Such tenns are of a piece with the appropriation of the term \dove\ for people whose policies, if followed, would create a climate ripe for war, and of ••hawk\ for people who, understanding the past, would like to stop agression before it achieves its ends and to maintain our armed forces at a necessary level for national security. To most Americans the policies of the \hawks\ are most likely to guarantee peace. If liberals and academics insist on violating language and logic as they do, is it any wonder that the voter turns away from Ottinger and Goodell to support Buckley?

It's at that point where you The battle to reward supporters and purge opponents has, for practical reasons, been !argely confined to the Senate, a hody which had demonstrated its own conception of national p ;orities by rejecting two of the President's nominees to the· Supreme Court, curtailing his power in waging the war in lnd1Jchina, limiting his ABM pro! ram, and subjecting his poli< ies to frequent and bitter criticism. Some of the Administration's chief Senatorial critics, like Muskie of Maine and Kennedy of Massachusetts, are not, of course, particularly vulnerable to attack. Others, like Young of Ohio and McCarthy of Minnesota, have chosen to retire, and still others, like Scott of Pennsylvania, have so often displayed their preference for discretion over valor that their continued presence in Washington can be tolerated. The brunt of Mr. Agnew's attacks has therefore been borne by only three Administration critics: Senators Hartke of Indiana, Gore of Tennessee, and Goodell of New York. While even the defeat of all three men would not dramatically alter the composition of the Senate, it would provide an object lesson for others and th1,1s produce substantial long-term consequences. man in Congress, helping Pres. Nixon carry out his plans to keep America Safe. He will protect the homeowner, the real backbone of America. The people of the Fifth Congressional district will finally get a congressman they can understand. The district never understood Lowenstein, and that \radical'' in Congress caused many sleepless nights. The people knew what the problem was - blacks, students, taxes, and welfare, not necessarily in that order. The lack of empathy culminated last Spring when Lowenstein was not allowed to speak at a high school graduation in his own district, If the liberals and acadeiilics insist on dividing the worl(l into two ornithological groupings, they should be prepared to accept the consequences.

Government· was founded on revolution and change, and yet it survives on its static nature. Is, then,, the only viable alternative to be found in revolution and is the revolution inevitable? There has developed today a tremendous. void in the American political scene ~ the student who no longer accepts electoral politics but who can riot and participate. in the revolutionary movement. He is lost, with no direction. Should he give up politics altogether? Where is the ~tudent to turn? · Although the Vice-President is merely the chief spokesman, and not the chief inst ator of this campaign, there is ,ittle doubt that his enthusiasm and presumed effectiveness played a large role in persuading the President to steer his party on its present course. From the standpoint of conventional politics, that course is a ma-sterful one. If the election produces substantial Republican victories, the Administration can, rightly or wrongly, claim much of the credit and proceed even more rapidly to reshape, not only th~ Republican party but · the electorate as a ·whole. If no Republican gains result, the President can trim his course sufficiently over the next two years to take this into account, and can even, should it prove necessary, use the Vice-President as a sacrificial lamb.

This is preeminently not a time for conventional politics, but a time for high-minded moralleaderl?hip which will correctly identify the nation's problems, tackle them honestly and forthrightly, and convince a divided and increasingly frustrated American people that by working together they can solve their problems and attain a better future.

PAGE 8 CONCORDIENSIS, NOV. 3, 1970 , Concordy Sports Panthers Drop Booters · By GEORGE BAlN To sum up the Union's soccer season so far, one need only modify and apply the baseball refrain, \April's high aspirations turned to September's tears.\ Two games remain on the schedule, but hopes for the first winning soccer season since 1958 vanished with Saturday's 3-1 loss to Middlebury, which dropped the Garnet record to 2-5-1. The victorious visitors stand at 6-2-1. The Dutchmen finally managed to snap their scoreless drought, but the effort was not enough for a victory. The offense never maintained a sustained threat in Panther territory and found it difficult to even execute accurate passes. As Coach Bob McMurray put it, \There's something missing, and ifs a lot more ,than a take-charge man.\ Two Middlebury goals in the second quarter decided the game. At the fifteen minute mark, Don Shaw beat Garnet goalie Craig Barger with a perfectly placed shot across the net into the upper right corner. The goal was unassisted. With time runnjng out in the half, the winning goal came on a questionable call by the officials. Barger came 01.1t and went to the X-Country Places 7th In Albany Invitational By GREG HAMLIN The good and the bad seem to run in streaks for the Garnet cross- country team. At the beginning of their season the Dutchmen reeled off three straight victories, and were entertaining hopes of an undefeated campaign. Mid-way through their schedule, however, the Garnet's luck soured, and the team proceded to lose a trio of dual meet contests. Right now, though, after closing their regular season with two dual meet wins, and putting in a strong performance in last Saturday's Albany Invitational, the harriers are again riding high. Union C.)mpiled 190 points, good for seventh place in the Albany meet. More than 21 colleges and universitit:s competed in the run, with scores ranging from the winner's. total of 40 to the last place finisher's tally·of 567. ground to make a save in front of the goal and upended a charging Panther forward in the prqcess. The officials called a hotly disputed penalty on Union and awarded a penalty kick to Middlebury. Ken Candon shot and scored, putting the ball into the lower right corner ef the net. Union scored - at last ~ early in the fourth quarter, after fourteen frustrating periods without a goal. With an assist from Dusty Richards, Bobby Bernhardt broke the ice with a shot that wrapped Panther goalie George Barr around the post. With six minutes lett in the game, Middlebury caught the tired-up Gamet at midfield and had a chance for an insurance goal. Shaw carried the baH down the right side and crossed it to Paul Wheelock to the left of the nets. The Panther wing banged the ball past Mike Pitt, who had replaced Barger, and the score stood 3-1. Union had one last chance, after a pushing infraction by the Middlebury defense. But Barr correctly anticipated Chris Swan's play on the penalty kick and smothered his shot - along with the 1970 Garnet hopes. The dismal season closes out this week with two away games. Today, the Garnet visited Hartford, and they play Thursday at Albany State. Second Half ''74 G:ri'd Surge Upends RPI By JAY HOBART Union's freshman football team scored 21 points in the second half, highlighted by an 85 yarg kickoff return by Bru~e Mathias, as the Gamet defeated the R.P.I. Engineers 21-14 Friday at Troy.. · Midway through the final qua-rter the Garnet completed the scoring. .After a blocked R.P.I. punt, Union recovered the ball at the En~neer 30. Two plays. later, Hall, using the triple option play which had been ~uccessful throughout the afternoon, pitched out to Rod· Jones who took the ball two yards around left' end for the score. After the Garnet .defen~e had forced the Engineers to give up the football, Union fumbled the ball away on the second play from scrimmage .. R.P.I. scored six plays later on an 18~yard heave from Allocco to John Martin. A two point conversion attempt was stJccessfui on a sweep around right end, making the score 14-7. The R.P.I. kickoff ·squad apparently was savoring their touchdown becl!use it was on the ensuing boot that Matlrias. grabbed the ball at the Union 15 .and flew by the Engineers, who dove in vain attempts to grasp him. Albano was again successful on his conversion atterri.pt. The Dutchman yearlings entered the ,third quarter trailing 6-0. R.P .I. took the lead in the ..second quarter when quarterback: Don Allocco tossed a 13-yard pass to Bill Deshefy who took it into the end zone. The extra point attempt failed. On the previous play, Jones had set up the score with a. 28-yard skirt around his right end. Albano booted the ball through the- uprights adding the final point. Friday's win boosted the Garnet yearlings' record to 2-1-l. They wind up their season this Friday at Alexander Field when they collide with· Utica College.· Quarterback Bob Hall finally· got the Gamet's sputtering offense rolling when he lead his team 70 yards early in the third quarter for Union's first six points, with Mathias scoring from the two on an option play around left end. A1 Albano, whose toe is becoming quite reliable, added the extra point. In finishing seventh, the Garnet almost succeeded in beating such perennial cross-country power-houses as Colgate and Albany State. The Dutchmen did surprise arch-rival R.PJ., avenging an earlier regular season loss to the Engineers. Frosh Boot Bows In .Finale Once again, the top three performers for Union were Bob Nesbitt, Tim McCabe, and Bryant Moeckel. First-year man Nesbitt, who ran despite a sore foot, copped the 25th spot in the meet, with his two team-mates finishing right behind him in the 26th and 27th positions. Only one second separated the Garnet trio. Paul Forbes, who finished 45th, and Ed Wagner (68th) rounded out the top Union five. On Saturday, the Dutchmen will take their winning streak to Buffalo, where the State Meet is to be held.

The President's Council, consisting of sixteen members representing all constituencies of . the college community, meeting earlier. this week to consider the incident of the \hecklers\' present at Convacation with Dolff Drodge on October 27, decided that a violation of rules did occur at the lecture. A report from the Council, released yesterday, states that \it is the regular practice of the College to supply no information... on actions taken by any disciplinary body ... This time, however, in view .of the nature of its decision and in view of the fact that this is its first action, the Council has Required Language Considered, French Club Okayed Bg Senate ByLES GOLDMAN The Student Senate, meeting on Tuesday evening, passed a motion by -a vote of 18 . to 8. which called for the end of all language requirements for either the B.A. or B.S. degrees. This motion, if put into ~ffect, would begin with the Class of 1975; it also advocates the. development, by the Modern Language Department, of Comp. Ed. options in the cultures of mentioned the concern of the school administration about the presence of so many dogs on. campus. One possible a11swer for dealing with this problem was discussed. It advocated the use of identification tags for student- owned dogs. Thus, if any dog were present on the campus without this identification tag, it would be sent to the animal shelter. Although this proposal was discussed, no final action was taken. The other area that was discussed dealt with the · possibility of some kind of remu·neration being given to the Student Senate officers. It was mentioned that at many other schools, student officers are paid salaries or given free rooms. There was no action taken on this proposal now, but there wHI probably be some kind of action taken in the near future. authorized pyblication and. distribution of the statement that follows.\ The report goes on to describe the intermittent heckling during the s.peech of Drodge, a representative .of the Nixon Administration, who spoke about the United States involvement in Southeast Asia. \At the conclusion of the speaker's discourse,\ the paper continues, \ ... a .small group carrying flags and variously dressed, proceeded down the center aisle, turned to face the audience, and began what can adequately be described as an episode of \guerrilla theatre.\ Upori request of President Martin, the group left the chapel, and on the chapel porch, he asked the members of the group to give their names to the Dean of Students, and he notified them that the incident would be reported to the \appropriate disciplinary bodies.\ The charge to the President's council, then, was to determine whether or not a violation of the relevant rules relating to interference with discourse did occur, and whether or not the. violation warrants consideration by ene or more disciplinary bodies. After discussion, the Council concluded that although a violation of relevant rules did occur, no further actil>n would be taken. The bocly did, however, endorse the President's action in requesting the group to leave the chapel, and to commend the student body for its successful preservation of the speaker's right to be heard. Among the reasons cited for the decision to take no further action were \that the heckling was effectively silenced by student action and did not result in interruption of discourse, and that the •guerilla theatre' group immediately left when requested to do so.\ In summary, the report notes that this is the \first instance of disorder to nave been brought before it and the first of its kind reported at Union. The Council took the opportunity to emphasize to· all members of the college community \that their actions not only must meet the letter of the regulations regarding demonstrations and protests but must also constantly reflect highest regard for reason and civility as the e~sential characteristics of discourse in an educational institution.\ Beethouen Next at Chapel The Guarneri· Quartet. one of the most highly praised young ~tring ensembles in America, will ;>resent an all-Beethoven program in Memorial Chapel this Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. various foreign nations.

The 'motion was finally defeated. . The Senate also discussed a motion which would give the , Committee on Committees total power in appointing students to Student-Faculty Committees. The President of the College, if he objected to any student appointee, would have to explain these objections to the Committee on Committees. . Furthermore, the Committee could override the President's objections and still appoint a student to a Faculty~Student Committee. The proponents of this measure. felt that only students should appoint students to committees. The motion, after some discussioh, was passed. Two other areas of importance were mentioned for future action by the Senate. Walter Spencer, President of the Senate; By JUDY STEINBACH Author John Updike in another of the series of lectures and concerts, 1970-1971, spoke in Memorial Chapel Wednesday night. Updike's two-part program included an informal interview with several students and faculty followed by a reading of his selected poems and short stories. The interview, rather rare in that Updike tends not to grant interviews freely, was led by professor Frank Gado of the English De'partment. More akin to an informal discussion in Hale House were nine students, professor David Stinebach and Mr. Patrick Allen of the English Department.· James Lieb, editor of the Idol assisted Gado in much of the preparation needed for the Updike program, helping student . interviewers to obtain copies of the author~· novels and·· poetry. The interview concentrated on topics related to Updike's writing and his personal feelings as a novelist. Two of his novels. Rabbit Run and Bech: A Book, a current bestseller, were discussed in particular. The general relationships between films and books and the status · of the jewish author in America were also discussed. Questions were asked freely, and answered sincerely in the informal atmosphere. The interview was recorded on tape and will be transcribed as a special issue of the Idol in Match. Following the interview, Updike presented an hour-long program in Memorial Chapel which featured selected readings 0 rom his own works. · At one point, af~er being bombarded with questions, Updike gulped, \This reminds me of When I took my oral exams as a student at Harvard.\ question of Comps and their place in the academic program of the departments.

The President's Council, consisting of sixteen members Fepresenting all constit1:1encies of . the college comm1:1nity, meeting earlier this week to consider the incident of the \hecklers·\ present at Convocation with Dolff Drodge on October 27, decided that a violation of rules did occur at the lecture. A report from the Council, released yesterday, states that \it is the regular practice of the College to supply no information... on actions taken by any disciplinary body... This time, however, in view of the nature of its decision and in view of the fact that this is its first ac~ion, the Council has Required Language Considered, French Club Okayed By Senate By LES GOLDMAN The Student Senate, meeting on Tuesday evening, passed a motion by a vote of 18 to 8 which called for the end of all language requirements for either the B.A. or B.S. degrees. mentioned the concern of the school administration about the presence of so many dogs on. campus. One possible answer for dealing with this problem was discussed. It advocated the use of identification tags for student- owned dogs. Thus, if any dog were present on the campus without this identification tag, it would be sent to the animal shelter. Although this proposal was discussed, no final action was taken. The other area that was discussed dealt with the possibility of some kind of remuneration being given to the Student Senate officers. It was mentioned that at many other schools, student officers are paid salaries or given free rooms. There was no action taken on this proposal now, but there will probably be some kind of action taken in the near future. authorized pl]blication and. distribution of the statement that follows.\ The report goes on to describe the interrniuent heckling during the speech of Drodge, a representative of the Nixon Administration, who spoke about the United States involvement in Southeast Asia. \At the conclusion of the speaker's discourse,\ the paper continues, \ ... a _smaH group carrying flags and variously dressed, proceeded down the center aisle, turned to face the audience, and began what can adequately be described as an episode of \guerrilla theatre.\ Upon request of President Martin, the group left the chapel, and on the chapel porch, he asked the members of the group to give their names to the Dean of Students, and he notified them that the incident would be reported to the \appropriate disciplinary bodies.\ The charge to the President's council, then, was to determine whether or not a violation of the relevant rules relating to interference with discourse did occur, and whether or not the violation warrants consideration by one or more disciplinary bodies. After discussion, the Council concluded that although a violation of relevant rules did occur, no further action would be taken. The body did, however, endorse the President's action in requesting the group to leave the chapel, and to commend the student body for its successful preservation of the speaker's right to be heard. Amo::1g the reasons cited for the decision to take no further action were \that the heckling was effectively silenced by student action and did not result in interruption of discourse. and that the 'guerilla theatre' group immediately left when requested to do so.\ In summary, the report notes that this is the \first insta nee of disorder to have been brought before it and the first of its kind reported at Union. The Council took the opportunity to emphasize to all members of the college community \that their actions not only must meet the letter of the regulations regarding demonstrations and protests but must also constantly reflect highest regard for reason and civility as the e~sential characteristics of discourse m an educational institution.\ Beethouen Next at Chapel The Guarneri Quartet. one of the most highly praised young ;tring ensembles in America. will Jresent an all-Beethoven program in Memorial Chapel this Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. This motion, if put into effect, would begin with the Class of 1975; it also advocates the. development, by the Modern Language Department, of Comp. Ed. options in the cultures of various foreign n11t~ons. A representative of the French Club appeared before the Senate to explain the organization's new constitution. The constitution was approved by the Senate, which enables this club to receive money from the Student Tax Committee. Debate On Comprehensiv_e Exams Continues: F acuity To Act Soon Tickets for the concert. co- sponsored by the Schenectady Museum, will be sold at the door. Student tickets are $1 and non-students will pay $3.00. Union students will be admitted free. One of the more controversial motions of the night was one that would have allowed no electric amplification of either music or speakers in Library Plaza without the permission of the Dean of Students. The arguments about this motion centered primarily around the possible oppressive nature of the proposal. The proponents of this measure felt that it was necessary as a means of controlling the noise level so that studying and classes would not be disturbed. The motion was finally defeated. , The Senate also discussed a motion which would give the, Committee on Committees total power in appointing students to Student-Faculty Committees. The President of the College, if he objected to any student appointee, would have to explain these objections to the Committee on Committees. Furthermore, the Committee could override the President's objections and stiH appoint a student to a Faculty-Student Committee. The proponents of this measure felt that only students should appoint students to committees. The motion. after some discussion. was passed. Two other areas of importance were mentioned for future action by the Senate. Walter Spencer, President of the Senate. By DAVID CONTI The annual debate concerning Comprehensive Examinations has begun anew on Campus and recent Center, Division, and Department Chairmen meetings have become forums for discussing fhe Comps issue. At a meeting of the Center I Department Chairmen, yesterday Dean Martin Lichterman asked the group to consider the Idol Interviews Updike, \lecture like Comps\ By JUDY STEINBACH Author John Updike in another of the series of lectures and concerts, 1970-1971. spoke in Memorial Chapel Wednesday night. Updike's two-part program included an informal interview with several students and faculty followed by a reading of his selected poems and short stories. The interview. rather rare in that Updike tends not to grant interviews freely, was led by professor Frank Gado of the English Department. More akin to an informal discussion in Hale House were nine students, professor David Stinebach and Mr. Patrick Allen of the English Department. James Lieb. editor of the Idol assisted Gado in much of the preparation needed for the Updike program. helping student interviewers to obtain copic:- of the author~ novels and poetry. The interview concentrated on topics related to Updike's writing and his personal feelings as a novelist. Two of his novels. Rabbit Run and Bech: A Book, a current bestseller. were discussed in particular. The general relationships between films and books and the status of the jewish author in America were also discussed. Questions were asked freely, and answered sincerely in the informal atmosphere. The interview was recorded on tape and will be transciibed as a special issue of the Idol in March. Following the interview. Updike presented an hour-long program in Memorial Chapel which featured selected readings ·rom his own works. At one point. after being bombarded with questions. Updike gulped. \This reminds me of when I took my oral exams as a student at Harvard.\ question of Comps and the1r place in the academic program of the departments. No decision was reached concerning what to do with the controversial exams, but Lichterman maintains that some form of Comps must and will remain.

PAGE 2 CONCORDIENSIS, NOV. 6, 1970 ,.--.. .. ~ .~~0..4 ;------------~~~,_,. _______ _ Ql,nnror tott~ ~trnsis l ~· Editor-in-Chief Peter J. Weingold Student Senate Assessed The Student Senate, in its truly admirable zeal, has discussed many issues which in years past would have languished and di~d in the old Student Council. They are to be praised for this but unfortunately that praise must be tempered by a rather large question. . Why is it that the Student Senate has not once discussed the \enfranchisement\ of the one thousand evening division students, or the graduate students, who are full academic members of the college? Are the Senators afraid of being voted out of office? Or do they merely consider the evening students persons who come to Union to study, but have no say in student government because they don't practice frisbee in the Spring and don't paint the Idol in the FaH? While college governance is being discussed it would ·be wise for the Senate not only to recognize the missing third of the student body, but t_o recommend to the Committee on Governance that any plan include these students who have been previously overlooked. Surely the motion to remunerate the officers of the Student Senate was entered in jest. Hopefully there is a gr:eater reward for those who give their time to all school projects like the Senate, Union Book, Concordiensis, Idol and many other groups funded py the Tax Committee. If the leaders of the Senate feel that their energies are only worth money, perhaps they will resign so their places can be filled by more student oriented officers. Comps To Face Tough Test The question of Comprehensive Exams is npt an easy one and for this reason any discussion of what their future will be must include representatives from all groups concerned: Faculty, Students, and Administration. For the· Faculty to persist in holding secret meetings and to treat the students as if they really are inconsequential in any decision is absolutely wrong and will only serve to backfire and make any future rapport more difficult. There is no reason why all meetings on the question can't be open to all interested members of the college. The faculty musL bear in mind that an increased role in the decision making process by the students is inevitable and should be welcomed. · Spring Crisis. Increased- Pass-Fail and Withdrawals by Michael Hurley In May of 1970, the Union students and faculty voted to loosen the stringent regulation regarding the newly incorporated Pass,..F~ii system, be€ause of the ca~pus disorders arising from the Cambodia situation. This measure was taken so that politically involved students would have some relief from the burden of their courses and be able to continue their outside activities. The new program allowed the students to take all their courses pass-fail, regardless of whether or not they were in the students' major field. Normally the student is allowed one pass-fail course a term ' with a maximum of two a school year. This .system involves only non-major courses, and does not include the Comprehensive Education program. The Comp Ed 90 program, which is comprised of · independent study programs, was also expanded last May, enabling students to substitute a Comp Ed 90 course for one of their three regular courses. The requirement for this was that the independent ' study be legitimie.ed by a professor as being a valid and relevant topic. These programs are to continue until the end of the semester, at which time they will be graded and recorded. There was a third option established last spring which enabled the ·student to withdraw from class, or take an incomplete for the course. Union's campus traffic court will sit in room SS01'0 on According to Mr. Calvin Schmidt, Registrar, \there is no way to (letermine how many actually did fake advantage ·of. the May circl.!mstances,'' but he did refer to some figures concerning the general trends of last spring. Normally, he said, an average of ~00 courses are. taken pass-fail, but under the May legislation, 891 students took advantage .of t-he lower standards resulting in l ,368 pass-fail courses. ()f ·this total, 55 failures were given; 129 students dropped. their coQrses and took up the Camp Ed 90 projects, of which a few have been completed over the summer, with most to be completed at the end ~f this term. A total of 74 students chose withdrawal from courses, while 175 chose to take incompletes in 208 courses. The statistics on incomplete$ are somewhat misleading because twenty to thirty foreign term students usually have incompletes in the ~ourses for the semester they are overseas. Although there are few figure;; of past terms to be used for comparison, the registrar asserted that there was an overwhelming increase in pass• fail courses ·last spring, but a rather small increase 1n actua] withdrawals or incompletes .. He added, however, that the academic standards Were kept and there was no unusual increase in unsatisfactory work. FILM HAPS.

To convey the feeling of surrealistic dreams and flashbacks, the working of the human mind, Nichols uses fragmented scenes, displaced in time, connected only by a single verbal or visual link; technical devices such as overexposed scenes, visual symbolism, and liquid images. All of these effects result in a nightmarish quality reminiscent of Salvador Dali's view of reality. Nichols' handling of time brings to mind . particularly Dali's melting' watches. This also calls forth the basic flaw of the film. The fragmented scenes meant to reflect a confused mind bombarded by traumas, though intellectually appealing, often puzzle and disorient us. Even though a film intends to present a muddled state of mind it itself, should not be muddled. Nichols' direction, supported by Buck Henry's screenplay and the excellent cinematography, is strong though derivative. If certain scenes evoke Fellini or Orson Welles (who appears in the film as Dreedle and doubtless, aided in direction) one can only say that Nichols borrows only from the best. In his own scenes, he has proved himself to be a very ct~ative master of the ·most modern technological advances in film. The film appears to be much more serious than the novel, which has many highly comical low-comedy scenes. We can only surpose that this was done for two reasons. First, the limited time necessitated the deletion of those scenes ·least relevant to the theme. To sustain the basically tragic mood that underscored the lengthy novel, humor had to be minimized in the comparatively short film. Also, much of the humor in the novel was preempted by last year's \M.A.S.H.\ In fact, those comic scenes preserved in \Catch-22\ are the weakest, the most unoriginal in the movie. The only performance of any size (Welles' performance is one of girth) is given by Alan Arkin as : Y ossarian.

Sports ·Grid Hosts Pant,hers l'n Fall ·Weeken,d Test Hartford Tops Nosedioing--Boot By GEORGE BAlN The University of Hartford extended the Union soccer team's winless streak to seven games, with a 3.,() victory in Hartford on Tuesday. The once-promising Gamet failed again to produce an offensive threat, and their record slid to 2-6-1. the traveling Dutchmen by only 20 to 17, and Union managed to dominate play in the second half, controlliQg the ball for the last ten rrrlnutes of the game. Hartford even dropped some of its forwards back to bolster their weak defense. Still, the Garnet effort could not obtain a goal - let alone a victory. inserted forward Paul Martini at halfback, and both Martini and another so,photrtore, Dave Castleman, impressed the ·Coach with their performances. By MARK SHUGOLL A surprising Middlebury football team, seeking to cap its finest grid season since 1948, will invade Schenectady tomorrow to tackle the Union eleven, highlighting 1~70's Fall Weekend activities. Both teams are ·hoping to rebound from tough 21-20 fourth quarter losses inflicted last weekend when indentical two point conversion attempts fell short. This year was supposedly ·earmarked as a rebuilding season for Coach John Anderson's Middlebury team. The Vermonters, however, have completely turned the tables to post a fine 5-2 record, relying chiefly on a swift corps of Freshmen. Even more sutprisng has been the fact that this turnabout from last years 2-6 season slate has been accomplished while incurring crippling injuries to record- breaking quarterback Barry Metayer and star end Lee Cartmill. Both will miss tomorrow's encounter. Pete Mackey has taken over the signal-calling duties, and leads an all first-year backfield., The 6-1, 180 pound Mackey threw for 303 yards and two touchdowns last week, and has completed 39 of 108 passes for 666 yards in less than four full games since being moved from third to fiFSt string due to Metayer's injury. Middlebury's leading receiver since gaining a starting berth has been James Williams, a 9. 7 sprinter, who is averaging better than 27 yards a reception. At the other halfback slot will be Frank Cooper, who boasts 17 receptions while leading the Panther starters in rushing with 217 yards. Middlebury's quick but light- weight defensive alignment' boasts AU-E.C.A.C. linebacker Chris Grejtak, a 190 pounder. Also prominent along the line are 195 pound Jay Flickinger and 185 pound Doug Arnat. Mike Goldberger, a 165 pound Ruggers Drop Third In Row The Rugby club closed out its disappointing 1970 fall season last Saturday on a particularly tragic note, losing to the Cadets of Norwich University 10-9. Leading 9-0 at the half with the contest seemingly well under control, the ruggers wilted in the second stanza and allowed Norwich to push the ball down the field three times for tries. What probably lost the contest for the Garnet more than anything else was their failure to add the two-point conversion kick following their two tries. • Drew Hamelink scored the first three-pointer on a sideline run, and Garry Lynch fell on a loose ball in the end zone for the second score. Lynch, who missed the conversions after the two ··union tries, completed the scoring for the Dutchmen before haltime on a per:· · · kick from an extreme angk The loss was the Garnet's third ,of the fall season, and lengthened a seemingly interminable three- year Union winless skein. The ruggers must now wait until the spring season for their first win since l 'J(J7 halfback, leads the secondary. Hartford a squad Union will attempt to continue its improved offensive play in tomorrow's game.

!'AGE 4 CONCORDIENSIS, NOV. 6, 1970 ------------------------ Concordy Sports Grid Hosts Panthers In Fall Weekend Test Hartford Tops Nosedioing Boot By GEORGE BAIN The University of Hartford extended the Union soccer team's winless streak to seven games, with a 3-0 victory in Hartford on Tuesday. The once-prom1smg Garnet failed again to produce an offensive threat, and their record slid to 2-6-1. the traveling Dutchmen by only 20 to 17, and Union managed to dominate play in the second half, controlling the ball for the last ten minutes of the game. Hartford even. dropped some of its forwards back to bolster their weak defense. Still, the Garnet effort could not obtain a goal - let alone a victory. inserted forward Paul Martini at halfback, and both Martini and another sophomore, Dave Castleman, impressed the Coach with their performances. By MARK SHUGOLL A surprising Middlebury football team, seeking to cap its finest grid season since 1948, will invade Schenectady tomorrow to tackle the Union eleven, highlighting 1970's Fall Weekend activities. Both teams are hoping to rebound from tough 21-20 fourth quarter losses inflicted last weekend when indentical two point conversion attempts fell short. This year was supposedly earmarked as a rebuilding season for Coach John Anderson's Middlebury team. The Vermonters, however, have completely turned the tables to post a fine 5-2 record, relying chiefly on a swift corps of Freshmen. Even more surprisng has been the fact that this turnabout from last years 2-6 season slate has been accomplished while incurring crippling lnJUnes to record- breaking quarterback Barry Metayer and star end Lee Cartmill. Both will miss tomorrow's encounter. Pete Mackey has taken over the signal-calling duties, and leads an all first-year backfield. The 6-1, 180 pound Mackey threw for 303 yards and two touchdowns last week, and has completed 39 of 108 passes for 666 yards in less than four full games since being moved from third to fir-st string due to Metayer's injury. Middlebury's leading receiver since gaining a starting berth has been James Williams, a 9. 7 sprinter, who is averaging better than 27 yards a reception. At the other halfback slot will be Frank Cooper, who boasts 17 receptions while leading the Panther starters in rushing with 217 yards. Middlebury's quick but light- weight defensive alignment boasts All-E.C.A.C. linebacker Chris Grejtak, a 190 pounder. Also prominent along the line are 195 pound Jay Flickinger and I 85 pound Doug Arnat. Mike Goldberger, a 165 pound Ruggers Drop Third In Row The Rugby Club closed out its disappointing 1970 fall season last Saturday on a particularly tragic note, losing to the Cadets of Norwich University 10-9. Leading 9-0 at the half with the contest seemingly well under control, the ruggers wilted in the second stanza and allowed Norwich to push the ball down the field three times for tries. What probably lost the contest for the Garnet more than anything else was their failure to add the tv.~-point conversion kick followmg their two tries. • Drew Hamelink scored the first three-pointer on a sideline run, and Garry Lynch fell on a loose ball in the end zone for the second score. Lynch, who missed the conversions after the two ·union tries, completed the ::.coring for the Dulrhmen before haltime on n pe•· k1ck from an extreme angu:' The Jn'i~ was the Garnet's third of the fall season. and lengthened a seeming!\ interminable three- year t·n;.,;, ·· mless skein.

Jim Williams broke loose on a 36- yard sprint for the touchdown after apparently being stopped cold at the line of scrimmage.

There is, said Amira, a pipe emptying into the brook beneath the culvert behind the mruntenance building. The pipe feeds into the brook slightly downstream from the 75 foot section which runs underground. The pipe, coming from the general area of Nott Street and VanVranken Avenue, appears to be a source of· raw sewage. The emission from the pipe includes fecal material, soap suds, lint and a variety of other materials, Amira told Concordiensis last night. Above the point of entry of the pipe, Amira said, the water, although not exceptionally clean, is clear. Beginning at the point in question, and 350-400 yards downstream, the water is grey, cloudy, soapy and generally foul. The reason for the problem, Amira explained, is that the city of s~henectady has a backup- emergency-type sewer system. Whenever the city sewage system has an overload of sewage, the excess is automatically siphoned off into the brook. New York Museum Of Art aesthetic achievement.

Now, the sewage has been running through the brook for over a week and nothing seems to have been done about it as yet. Yesterday, Amira took two water samples from the brook: one from before the sewage pipe and one slightly after. The result: he found were astonishing. The water from the former was relatively clean, definitely clear and odorless.

From time to time I have been drawn aside by some By ALAN COHEN There will be a meeting of all thematic majors at my house at 4 a.m. every night this week. Why my house? Why 4 a.m.? Why every night? As of today, I am the only thematic major at Union College, so I can hold my meetings wherever and whenever I want. I find that many people still do not know what a thematic major is. Only five years ago, Union College students had a list of requirements to fulfill: physical education, English, history, language, convocation, departmental, science and others. We still have a few left, as well as the new and revis!!d comp. ed. requirement (which really does have its good points). Now we are told that we may take any twelve courses we want, unite them with a theme. write a thesis and call it a major. I jumped at it because I didn't want to take any more history courses nor the comprehensive exams and I wanted to take a few courses in psychology and some independent studies of educational reform. Others have not yet chosen to adopt the new idea - perhaps because they care and know about their respective majors or they fear the effects of this loosely organized kind of major on future applicatiom: for schools or jobs. These feelings are practical and well-taken. But I fear that people are limiting the potentialities of their undergraduate years for fear of not measuring up to standards they have not set for themselves. As much as I would like everyone to become a thematic major and come to my meetings, I would prefer that one would not have to consider the concept of a major field. At a meeting in Davidson House one and a half years ago (but it seems like yesterday), President Harold C. Martin 'For tiJr-ee Generations/ fhose Who Know- .•. Have been recommending justified requiring majors so that students could show their capabilities in one academic discipline and then apply their capabilities to other fields. (If this explanation is incorrect, I hope that the President will write to this paper and correct my misinterpretation.) He belittled the ideas of \free'' education more recently at a freshman convocation. Universities appear to be more concerned with their standings in the academic and corporate communities and their time- honored traditions than with the individual's right to further his intellectual ends as he defines them. There are differing schools of thought on education - one as a preparation for life, a tole which must be fulfilled before you may enter the world. The other is that education is an ongoing life process which should allow the individual his self-identification. To quote Albert William Ouzer Camus, \Life is a comp. ed.:\ it's only too bad that it has to be approved by the . committee before you can take it. The process of educational reform must not simply take place in universities; it must go down to the lowest levels. The subject is more complex than space permits. but it will be expanded upon in the future. I hope that students here will consider the opportunities of beiog a thematic major, but more importantly, will think, read and talk about the need· for educational reform.

FOR HONEST SERVICE AND GOOD JEWflR't well-meanin.g person and confidentially informed that the way to solve this problem of missing books is to place a guard at the door. Having sought in vain for fourteen years to find a library which has solved this problem by placing a guard at the door, I have to frankly admit a tendency to consider such suggestions, however well- meaning, to emanate from a presumption of considerable magnitude (were I to be asked why this has not been done at Schaffer Library, I would not be so prone to this tendency).. The only solutian to this problem on a campus where the college community refuses to caoperate by charging out books is to limit stack access. In the summer of 1965 I reached a high point in my career as a librarian when, ·with characteristic· energy, Professor Thimm complimented me on the condition of the library - every book that he wanted was either on the shelves or charged out. I do not say this in jest because Professor Thimm does not suffer fools gladly, and we had had some clashes over the problem of missing books. This situation came about because We had the cooperation and backing of the faculty and the fraternities through the Interfraternity Council. thus your correspondent's exhortation is, in my opinion, realistic in terms of its achievability. In 1965 we were under no illusion that we had the final solution to the problem, for the constantly changing membership of the college community dictates that we must continually solicit the cooperation of its various elements.

This year Mr. Robert ·Teittinen and Mr.. Pat1l Bryant have promised their assistance in obtaining the cooperation of the Interfraternity Council and the dorm co1;1nselors. Efforts are now underway to organize this help. Your correspondent's exhortation was addressed to the college community as a. whole {faculty, students, a.nd administration), and rightly so, for 1 have new reason to suspect that the number of ·offenders includes mote than members of the student body. This is not a matter that can be resolved by appealing to students alone; I would ho,pe that the example of the majority of the faculty and students who have been diligent in assisting us to cope with this problem might effect a change of attitude on the part of the offenders. After all; this is a matter ofself-inteJ;'est. To the tditor: Edwin K. Toian Librarian I would like to take this opportunity to respond to statements made in your report of the Nov. 3, 1970 Student Senate meeting contained in your Nov. 6 issue and in your editorial \Student Senate Assessed\ in the same issue. In his article Mr. Goldman reported the introduction of a motion calling for remuneration of Senate officers. This motion was brought by William Dawson '71. Mr. Dawson brought this motion at his own initiative. He had mentioned this to me but· I did not know that he planned to bring it up at the November 3rd meetil1g. Mr. Goldman failed to report that I asked Mr. Dawson to table the motion, which he did. I did not seek the Senate presidency with monetary gain in mind and I would refuse to accept remuneration if this action would harm my working relationship with other students. The editorial questioned representation of ·evening division and graduate students. I would like to point out that 90% of the evening division students are not full academic members of the college, because they are not matriculated and. are taking only one course. Most of these people have jobs and families and have a tenuous connection with the college. There would be a problem in that there is some turnover from term to term among these people and in that some of their courses meet at the same time as the Senate does. I spoke to Mr. Weifenbach, .Director of the Evening Divas10n. He said most of these people had no interest in goyernance of the college. There are about 100 matriculated students who we may try to represent. This will pose a problem since most of these people don't know each other and · many have responsibilities outside the college. The problem of representing full time graduate. students is a separate one. The subcommittee of representation of the committee on governance is conside:cing this problem and will have definite proposals in its report. Walter A.

Sha-N a-Na Brinqs The Fifties To Chapel's New Greasers· By MlKE MESEROLE Warren Harding had the right idea back in 1920. ~Back to Normalcy,\ proclaimed the Great Gamaliel, and the ·country turned away fwm Woodr.ow Wilson and World War I and stepped backward into the past. In a nation sick of war and tired of internationll.l strife, \normalcy;; \' meant returning to the good life the carefree times of ·yesteryear. President Harding is no longer with us, and hasn~t been for quite some titne, but war-sickness and strife~ fatigue are vecy . much in style, and so is that longing for normalcy. Normalcy, in 1970, for anyone from JS to 35, means the Brooklyn Dodgers, Howdy Doody, \I Like Ike,\ The Mickey Mouse Club, American Bandstand, and The Herald Tribune. The ninteen-fifties; ah, the Promi:shed Land. The Depression and World War. II were in the history books, Korea was being settled, and the biggest problem for a kid was trying to negotiate a multi-player baseball card deal (Paul Foytack, Enos Slaughter, Rip Ripulski, and Virgil Trucks for Duke Snider) with · the bubble: gum bandit down the block. But then the Dodgers (and the Giants) left for California, Eisenhower gave way to John Kennedy, the Trib . folded, missiles turned up in Cuba, maps of Vietnam appeared nightly on television, and America started killing its leadership. Color TV, cigarettes, the Beatles and the mini~skirt made things a little more pleasant, but the sizzling 'sixties were almost too hot to 1 handle. Then came the. '70's, and we realize cigarettes can kill, TV sets throw out radiation, the Beatles have broken up and the midiaskirt has arrived. Oh, for the good old days! Ozzie and Harriet, Dick Clark, Danny and the Juniors - where are you when we need you? Enter Sha-Na-Na. All of a sudden, Johnny Podres is pitching Brooklyn to its first World Championship, Richard Nixon is vice president, the space race is fiction and Vietcong must be King Kong's little brother. Last Saturday, an hour before showtime at Memorial Chapel, the Ratheskeller was choking in fumes. of Vitalis, Brylcreem, and Wildtoot. All afternoon the 'fifties freaks were spoiling for the 8:30 concert; pointed boots or low black Converse; white socks; tight dark pants or jeans Eat least two sizes tO'o small); grubby undershirts with short sleeves rolled up to the shoulder and a pack of Marlboros tucked away inside; and the era's trademark .greasy hair, complete With duck tails and spit curls. The scene inside the Chapel was insane. It seemed as though every male in attendence was combing his hair and wearing shades. For inost of the standing room only crowd that shoe- horned its way in, this was at long last a chance to let go of all the pep.t up frustrations that went with growing up _in the 1950's and not being a teen-ager. As Sha-Na-Na rushed out on stage, one could just imagine Murray the K giving the intro to all his Submarine Race Watchers. On . stage, Sh-Na-Na, comprised of nine musicians with greasy hair and greasier clothes and three lead singers resplendent in gold lam€ outfits open to the waist, went . through their roster of all-time oldies with a flair for comedy and an eye for exaggerated detail that left the throng roaring for more and finger-pop.ping until their thumbs fell off. lt was amazing, and probably a tribute to the decade, how quickly and ·effortlessly the words to songs like \Heartbreak Hotel/' \Why Must I Be A Teen- Ager In Love?:' \Great Balls of Fire,\ and \At the Hop,\ (to name a few) came back. For an hour and a half, as intermittent rows rocked left and right in unison, Sha•N!!:-Na let the audience have it right in the memory bank. Every song brought a response, but some like \Lil' Darlin\' (with accompanying castanets and cow bell), \Who Wwte the Book of Love?\ \Whole Lotta Shakin\' and \Ram-A.-Lam-A-Ding- Dong\ almost brought the National Guard. The choreography put-.on of a rendition like ''In the Still of the Night\ was priceless, and not a small portion 0f the crowd could Fesist the urge to throw down a few steps on the jammed dance floor. · But the highpoints of the evenin~'s crazed leap int0 yesteryear were the songs \Teen Angel\ and \Tell Laura I Love Her,\ as sung in mock anguish by the little guy in gold lame: The crowd response to these soulful tales of teen•age death and woe bordered on madness. It was like Johnny Cash singing to the inmates at Fulsom Prison. And in many respects the Memorial Chapel crowd may have been prisoners - prisoners of the ultra-fast paced 1960- 1970's, longing for a reprieve, if only for less than two hours, to those \normal lazy, carefree· days of the 1950's when rock 'n mil was a way of life and not just a memory.

The Garnet bowed out with seven consecutive losses, while Albany's victory concluded their season with a 3-8-1 record. Michael scored the deciding goal in the first quarter, assisted by Campbell. And, in the third period, Campbell tallied twice, with Michael . assisting on the second one. The Danes' barrage ended in the final stanza, as Joel Velinski assisted Michael on his second goal of the day. The four- goal margin made it the worst defeat suffered by the Garnet this Commenting on his team's scoring a meager five goals in their last eight games, first year coach Bob McMurray said, \You can't win if you can't score. What else can I say? I'm glad the season's over, and we're going to start fresh next fall.\ The mercifully ended 1970 season was one of transition for the Dutchmen, after the departure of the unpopula.r former coach, Gary Brown. The loss of Dave Block created a critical weakness in goal before the beginning of the season, but June graduation will hurt the Dutchmen in the goal and at halfback. McMurray is counting on some new offensive threats for 1971, as the 1970 team had scoring potential but little production, and frosh goaltender Jim Sletteland. Indeed, perhaps 1971 will mark the first winning Union soccer season since I 958.

Our newest jet, for the DC-10, prod aces around 50,000 pounds of thrust. In the early days of jet aviation, the important thing was thrust. But suddenly our skies are filled with jets. And, suddenly, jet pollution is a major problem. General Electric tackled it head on when building the DC-10 engines.

Of course, there's more to jet exhaust than just smoke. Our goal is somedaytomakejets run totallyclean. Another problem with jets is noise. IJ you've ever lived anywhere near an airport, we don't have to tell you that. General Electric has been working on noise, too. GE was chosen by the federal government to help solve this problem for the aviation industry. At present, we !<now of no way a powerful turbofan engine can be made noiseless.

Both tea:tps were plagued with fumblitis in the opening minutes of the game as the two teams exchanged the ball four times. It was Utica who finally capitalized, however, when the Pioneers recovered a Garnet fumble ~t Union's 10. A stiff Dutchman · · defense prevented Utica from taking the ball into the end zone but Bill Wood managed to kick a 21 yard field goal. In the second quarter the , Garnet again fumbled the ball away at their own 25. The defense held but Wood came through again, this time from 27 yards out, The Pioneers finally moved the ball into the end zone early in the third quarter. Union again dropped the ball and a Utica player pounced on it at the Pioneer 40. After two plays, quarterback Ronn Barr lofted a long pass to end Larry Maley who had run past the Garnet secondary. He jogged in easily for the score. Union did not score until the fourth quarter when the Pioneers were forced to punt from their own three. Bruce Mathias took the ball at the 35 and sped along the sidelines into the end zone. Utica put the game out of reach in the closing minutes when another lapse .in the Garnet secondary allowed Barr to complete a 95 yard pass to Stan Enoch. We have more work to do before we'll satisfy all the people concerned about jet pollution, ourselves induded. But because we've been working at it since the mid-Fifties, before it was widely recognized as much of a problem, GENERAL. ELECTRIC The Dutchmen completed the season with an even record of 2-2- 1. Utica finished their season with a 5-l record and a 15th ranking natio.nally among club football teams.

By BR\!C~ H. HUSTl!:N Even before J ·went, i thought the Mountebanks hac;l .made a poor _ choice -in attempting to stage Georg Buchner's \Woyzeck;\ It is hard, meaty stuff that even the most sophisticated professional company would have difficulty carrying off with aplomb. Now I've seen it, and while I still adhere to the notion that an amateur student company has no business undertaking such a Herculean task, I can say with a certain amount of pleasant surprise that the Mountebanks have made a more-than- respectable stab at it. Although what little plot there is remains u·nimportant, \Woyzeck\ tells of a poor German soldier in the middle of the nineteenth century who kills his wife after discovering that she is a whore and in involved with an army drum: major. Our primary concern is with W oyzeck himself, a neurotic little man whose personality is revealed to us by means of 29 vignettes which, although coherent and relevant as one entity, would be quite capable of standing dramatically independent of one another. Woyzeck is a typical Buchner character: a small inail trying to cope with the anguish of isolation and social alienation. The main problem with the Mountebanks' production is that the actors (who, with one or two exceptions, have been very sensitively cast) are too involved in doing theit own thing to be able to interact with one another on stage arid thereby to extract the essence of the play. The quality of the acting and-\ :he Pres;d4!ilt Martin will hold his second QED session on Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., in SS016.

By the year 1965, however, American troop strength in this corner of Asia had risen to approximately 2./ 3 million. yet this increasing U.S. military ~;omrnitment had led to increasing unpopularity . ~mo~g the natives.

Furth.ermore, continu'ed Wurfel, the various governments ruling in Saigon during the past decade generally failed to achieve widespread support in the countryside; as of the present day only !h of one percent of the South Vietnamese budget is spent on social welfare needs, while many civilian war victims suffer. The American obsession with anti-Communism both backfired and proved somewhat self- fulfilling, as Vietnamese who disagreed with the ruling South Vietnamese junta often fell themselves forced rnto alliances with actual Communi~t elements, resulting in an anti-American coalition between nationalists and social revoluti'onaries. Perhaps . America's most fundamental error in perception, he asserted, was its basic misunderstanding of the political development process. which U.S. officials thought that they could control simply through proper application of technology. [nstead, Wurfel believes that revolution is an inevitable aspect of political development, and that the U.s: must learn to live with revolutionary · regimes, particularly in the Third World. In concluding his speech, Wurfel presented a potential scenario covering future events in Southeast Asia. His projected plot involved such things as total American withdrawal by July 1972, a stand-still cease fire. and international conferences regarding economic rehabili- tation and demilitarization of the area. left with two alternatives: either to increase incom~. most likely through a tuition raise. or to decrease expenses. Since the administration would prefer not to cut back on its programs. the choice is not an easy one. President Martin does not yet know what course of action the college will follow. He is • planning to meet with department chairmen and students in the future to discuss Union's financial problems.

on 7:30 is and an for the hose and on All to. the in is on be LETTERS TO THE EDITOR To the Editor: As Mark Coven suggests,. where is the student to turn? I would hope he., as a scholar, would turn ·to resources which show the frttit of a man's labor. One of the best references I can suggest is the publicaticm by \The Friend's Committtee on National Legislati-on'' (membership for· _frequent mailings is very nomi:rurl). Well, b(ifore election, one ~n look at the vating records of congressmen aU over the U.S.A. on all kinds· of public issut)s. Were students to look at his record, I am s~ the¥ would feel that we have lost a top notch congressman from the N.Y. 29th district in Dan Button. He may not set the world on fire b~ his publk appearance and speech, but for tho~e wbo know of his productivity, the picture does not show the real gem of a man with concern for the future who votes his conviction!;! rather than any deemed-popular convenience. Daniel · Button not only worked hard for postal reforms and other net;:ded programs in Washington, ·he worked for programs at home. When asked to help .move a sta:Hed application for a pr.ograrrt for training disadvantaged of the inner city; he responded, and our program suddenly started moving after lengthy delay. His congressional hearings in his district were translated into his concern and push for a proper reassessment of priorities. But liberalism sinks slowly into a more conservative majority. And almost by defini.tion, the majority is conservative. A man with. family responsibilities wants stability for his growing childten. Liberalism to be liberal is the new thinking (not always correct or even adVisable for the· future as first devised) which those concerned mostly with today or the near future will not devise himself nor readily accept without a ratht;:r good view to changes not adverse to the well being of his family. Many so .. called liberal ideas appear to those who have toiled for half a lifetime as likely to degrade the standard of liVing for large numbers, if not all citizt;:ns. Unless some sales work is done to snow better that the stages and the end results of liberal change cause no such loss to civilization, the conservatives who cause no such loss .to. civilizatioth . the conserVatives· · who . see that U.S.A. h~ helped Europe and Japan to self-sufficiency indeed to productive competitorship on the matlcet since 1946 - are .hardly apt to denoupce the system and tum to another with vague (and to them often threatening) promises with no hard planning. . Thus we have lost a Uberai Republican to a Democrat ( ... in comparison, ~oQSeJVative) who. is more popular· to· tlie voter majority. Where to turn? To the existing system. I for one intend to Write mY next congressman from the 29th district on those items which concern me, even if I didn't vote for him. He was elected by the majority, and our government d«N!S function and enough public re~ponse of a responsible nature do at least . demand s.otne considet:ation. Write yout congressman, but do so with constructive suggestions! Learn the system and become a congressman Yourself! There reaUy is a place for the llt\ldent to turn. Prof. William B. Martin, Jr. Department of Chemistry * * * * The \Jethro Tull\ concert is sold out. lf you have not already bought a ticket, pie._ do n.ot go to the door; no more ticketli wiD be sold; To Tbe Editor: The American Liberal has never been known as a sma~t poUtical animal, and, once agai'n, . he has . proven it. I refer specifically ·to New York Stat~, where •• bleeding hearts and knee jerk liberals\ 'by the droves allowed a .buffoon named Agnew to get them so pissed off they couldn't vote straight. Here in New York, over a .million well- rneaning and sympathetic liberals threw away their votes on Charles Goo(iell: A man who could not win, and who surprised no one When he lost. The tationalization for those votes was, ~imply, \we much prefer him to the other candidates.\ S\lrely, in a two way race, this. form Qf reasoning is wise. But a ~hree way race requires much more sophistication. It's not a run-off,:_ you know, it's· a real live. election, and you j\lst have to vote strategically. ln 1969 we made merry over New York City c<;mservatives splitting their vates between Marchi and. Procaccino, thus ~lecting Lindsay. Why then, could we not use our heads and get together in this senatorial election to defeat Buckley? Why did so many of us choose to ignore the naked truth which screamed at us th~J a vote for Goodell was a vote for Buckley? Fot jtlst a moment, let's digress to 1968, and the presidential election. How many of us said \I can't support Humphrey, he's a horse's ass?\ How many of us · said \J{umphrey Nixon, they're both the same ... like Tweedledee and Tweedledum?\ That kind of imbecilic reasoning by God only knows how many liberals across the national helped put Nixon in the White House. Now, nobody but nobody can tell me that Humphrey would have pushed for the · A.B.M., gone into. Cambodia, nominated Carswell or Haynesworth, made John Mitchell Attorney General, or Melvin Lair.d -Secretary of Defense. Nobody can tell me Humphrey would have allowed to flourish the frightening repressive atmosphere under which we now live, that he would have had the Justice Department prosecute the Chicago Seven, or· that he would have precipitated the appalling tragedies of Jackson and Kent States. And yet, lacking foresight, and perhaps lacking also fundamental intelligence, many liberals chose toforsakeHumphrey in 1968, and they gave Nixon clearer access to the seat of power for which he so long aspired. It is similar stupidity that allowed James \For three Generations.• 'l'hose Who Know .•• Have been recommending - Buckley, backed by 39% of th.e state, an<l H.L Hunt's money, to wiit a Senate seat in New York, We Hberals are going to have to start using our heads immediately --.... so that we don't blow everything in 197 2. Partially because of liberal moronity, Nixon faces an increased challenge from the far right in '72: James Buckley, grinning sheepishly in New York, Ronald Re,gan flashing }lis Colgate smile in Caluornia, and George Corley Wallace sneering in Alabama. AU three a~e armed with charisma and should be considered extremely popular. To avoid a strong conservative threat, Nixon will almost have to move to the right. Watch for more \legalized'; repression of students and blacks, more talk of \weeding out undesirables,\ and more Spiro. But, if we on the left are smart, we won't provide any ammunition. As much as we may want to take over a buildiQg, throw a rock, or even an egg, we'll just have to get used to the fact that the American voters don't dig that kind of political activity; that it is counter- productive, and brings about further repressio.n. And remexnber, that as much as Agnew, Wallace, Buckley, Reagan and the other demagogues of the right criticize us for our oft-times imm~;Jture political behavior, the.y love it, because it puts votes in their pockets. The smartest possible thing for us to do now, is to refute the \POLITICS OF PlSS<OFF.\ Pick a party, and start working for it, now. This way, maybe we won;t be shut out of the 1972 presidential nominating processes the way we were in 1968. If we play our cards right, we - the young, the liberal, the b-lack, the poor, the student- may be able to exercise a great deal of influence over the · select'ion of, say, the next democratic presidential nominee, his running mate, and his platform. Should the right wing put up a candidate to oppose Nixon, that democratic nominee may well be our next president. I realize it's not popular to advocate working within the system to such a great extent as this, but to those who say the system steps on you if you try to change it from within, just look at what has happened to those who have tried to change it from without.

II • From Page 1 creating . a more-conducive working atmosphere and by demanding of the ~ctors more of a communal spirit that would have allowed for interaction. That, indeed, is the element that is the key to this play and the only major flaw with this production. Less ego~tripping; more ·relating to the actor opposite you. It is something that only the best rep companies in the world have really been able to achieve, and maybe it is for this reason that I feel a play like \Woy~ck\ should never have been undertaken. In the scenes between Andres and W oyzeck arid between the Captain and Woyzeck this interaction is most noticeably lacking. If I am being too demanding or too picayune it is because in this pla¥ the Mountebanks seem to have reached the point wher~ such esoteric criticisms are the anly other things that are needed. The fair scenes in particular glitter with satisfying technique. The preceding scenes end with a bare, pitch-black stage and awkward sill;mce. Suddenly. - and all at once - a set of circular Christmas lights goes on, the · stage is filled with gaily- colored props, the stage lights go on, and the fair people make a loud, happy entrance. Theatrically \t is an electric moment. . The stage business is good, an important factor with so large a cast, and the love scene between Woyzeck's wife Marie and the drum major is a notable triumph. Lighting contributes measurably to the success of this production, particularly in the above .. mentioned scene. There is -one serious lighting flaw, however, when W oyzeck stabs Marie in a potentially-moving slQW motion death sequence. The idea is a good one but the lighting that accompanies the ·slow-motion scene is incongruous. A switch to a dim, timeless white spot during that scene would doubtless enhance its effect. Bob Harders as Woy.zedk delivers his lines particularly we11 but at times appears to be forcing his character's neuroticism a bit too much. His reading also makes Woyzeck something of a constant, unchanged character whereas the script suggests a gradual degeneration. Harders' one deviation - after W oyzeck has killed his wife and is happily .rejoicing in the inn - is one of his best moments in the play and suggests that perhaps there ought · to be more room left for flexibility in Woyzeck's character .. Abby Schutzer's Marie lets us forget after the second scene that she is supposed to be a whore. Although the script is partially to blame here, Miss Schutzer might make more of her role .by weaving this part of the character into her reading. In the ~ave scene, however, her eyes make us truly believe that she has fallen in love with the drum major, and this is one of the most convincing parts of the play. \Woyzeck\ goes on at 7:30 tonight and at 8:45 p.m. tomorrow as well as next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in the Nott Memorial Theater.

Hamilton is 2-5 on the season but has lost four of those ~·lines by a total of 12 points. ; ,J.: 5-3 Garnet will be capping their. second winning season in three years. In addition to having to contend with the Union football team tomorrow. the Continentals must face a hospital list that seems to grow larger by the day. Starting halfbacks Vic Ribeiro and Ross Peters have both been out of action of late. as has Peters' replacement Paid Holmes.

The 220 pounder will be replaced by either ~ike Martin or AI Sehade. The Garnet. however, will put on the field a tough defense and an offense that has finally begun to live up to its expectations. Gary Morris, a junior · offensive guard, earned E.C.A.C. Ali~Star honors for his performance against Middlebury and anchors the improving offensive line .. His play paved the way for the Dutchmen's 404 yards in total offense last week the unit's finest showing in that department this year. Earning honorable mention on the E.C.A.C. weekly team were sophomore halfback John Swanko, sophomore kicker Bob Mitchell, and co--captain Paul Ramsey, a senior safety. Swanko gained 134 yards irt 25 carries and in the process. upped his season's total to 680 yards, a modern single season re.cord. Mitchell kicked an extra point and two field goals, the last of which came in the fourth q1,1atter from 35 yards out to give Union its three point margin of victory. Ramsey intercept\!d two passes and led the defense in tackles with 15. The Hamilton series began in 1890, and since that time has produced the closest long term rivalry. in the nation. The Continentals own 32 victories as compared to 30 for Union, Twelve games have ended in ties. On Today' s Scene With BILL HOLLERAN Many sports buffs on campus must have been shocked last Tuesday night to see Union's Athletic Director and football coach George Flood being interviewed by WRGB-Channel 6 Sports Director Bob McNamara on the latter's II: 15 sportscast. Some of us who were around last year, and who remember McNamara's dealings last spring with Flood, former basketball mentor Chris Schmid, and hoop high- scorer Jim Tedisco, were amazed that Flood actually spoke to McNamara--instead of dropping him with aql!ick left hook. The occasion of the interview was a quickie film clip on the Garnet's kicking star Bobby Micthell, the guy who won the Middlebury.~>game last weekend with .a 35-yard field goal. McNamara wisely pointed out in the spot that Mitchell's strong, accurate toe has meant the difference for the Dutchmen in several games this season, and that the sophomore stands an excellent chance of re~writing Union's place- kicking records. Flood. as Mitchell's coach, was on hand to supply additional comments. It appears that there has- been a reconciliation of .sorts between Flood and McNamara. and such a remarkable event goes a long way toward proving the old ;tdage, \Time heals all wounds.\ Certainly McNamara made himself about as unwelcome on this campus last March as any human being could have. He hassled Tedisco and his parents unceasingly following Schmid's sudden retirement. trying to find out if Tedisco would transfer elsewhere upon his coach's quitting. McNamara later embarrassed Schmid himself on a TV inte. •iew, and then proceeded to pester Flood and Sports Information Director Phil Johnson in an attempt to get the \scoop\ on the new coach's identity. Flood reports. however. that he and McNamara \got together this fall and talked things over.\ McNamara revealed that as sports director of Schenectady's local television station, he felt that he should give Union some exposure on the air. Most rece.ntly, when he approached Flood and asked if he could do the cl'ip on Mitchell, Flood decided that his own feelings toward McNamara should not stand in the way of Mitchell, and Union College, getting some free publicity. And so time had healed the old wounds of last spring, leaving Flood, McNamara. and Union College disarmed in an uneasy truce or Mexican standoff. if not a total reconciliation.

The· 40 year old lighting board in the Nott Memorial Theatre sparked seriously during weekend rehearsals and has PYE In uestigators Discouer Trash in City's Efficiency By BILL HOLLERAN The Schenectady Protect Your \Environment Club uncovered some intriguing information over the weekend concerning the serious sewage problem which has existed on the Union ~ollege campus for the last two weeks. Lilley wa!f also questioned by Amira about who is re!lponsible for checlcing contractor's plans during and after construction of a building, to make sure that violations in sewer construction do not occur. Lilley replied that it is the city plumbing inspector's -responsibility to check plans for any sucb possible violations. As a result Amira and this reporter left to see the plUlllbing inspectl)r, Mr. Howell Wilber. wbo said somewhat incredUlously that he had never been told about the problem at all. Wilber, who has been city plumbing inspector for 17 years, was amazed that a 16-year old .problem, ostensibly under his jurisdiction, had not even been brought to his attention by the City Engin~er's Office. Wilber expressed his interest in solving the problem, and eagerly offered to inspect the sewer pipe and assess the situation. After Continued on Page 5· College Dilemma forced the cancellation of -this weekend's performances of \Woyzeck.\ Citing figures from over the last twenty years, Martin first indicated that although student enrollment and faculty costs have increased, the present student- faculty ratio (1037) is less than the ratio 20 years ago. However, he then declared that \we foresee a year, at least, of belt tightening.\ A lack of capital, and necessary payments on interfund borrowing will prevent , any significent construction in the. immediate future. The President also said that Union has been operating with a deficit for. six of the last seven years, d.:ue, to a significant extent, to the inflation affecting the entire country. Thus, the trustees feel that Union's budget must be balanced. This raises several important ·questions according to Dr. Martin, which are still unanswered. For example, do we cut ·back on personnel or supplies? One probable result of this will be a freeze, for at lea~t one year, on appointments to the .college faculty. ,_ . .~ .. - . President Martin made explicit Union's present priorities: the Science Center (now under construction and apparently already financed); a Student Center, to be housed in a renovated Carnegie Hall (the funds for this have already 'been allocated from a specific gift for, this purpose and building will start as soon as the building is vacated); a Fine Arts Center, and improvements on the Physical Education plant. As money is made available, these latter two will be undertaken. But what all this means to students said Martin is, in any event, a likely tuition increase next year or the year after. With regard to the fine arts Dr. Martin said that they ••have not received as short a shrift as some think.\ But he adlllitted that the arts are poorly housed and short staffed. The housing problem will be alleviated as soon as the Science Center is completed, but the staff shortage may have to wait until the budget can be balanced, added Martin. The problem concerns a steady stream of raw sewage that has been pouring fro~ a storm sewer, l'ocated .. behind the maintenance · · buildingS', · into historic Hans Groot's Kill - the famed ·~brook that bounds'' through the College's Jackson's · Gardens.

Dr. Martin also announced · plans to have the pigeons on the third floor of the theatre exterminated, and their artifacts removed.

He indicated that they have had no robberies of any significance this year. A problem that the fraternities face that independents do not is the protection of their. houses from vandalism. All four of the fraternity presidents spoken to stated that tltey have had difficulties in protecting their houses from acts of vandalism coinmitted by local adolescents. These acts usually range from the breaking of windows to the entering of fraternity kitchens to steal things such as eggs. It was mentioned, that in many cases these eggs are thrown at the fraternity houses or at nearby parked cars. Another problem facing the fraternities · is the protecting of their parties from invasion by non-Union , COllege students. Both Bill Silver of 1247 and Larry Langmare of 'theta Delta Chi reported that this has not I been a significant problem for their houses so far this year. Rich Cooperwasser of Delta Chi indicated that sotne difficulties with non-student party crashers developed during Fall Weekend. However, the most significant problems in this regard seemed to have developed at Phi Gamma. Delta. Steve Pierce partially attributed this problem to the fraternity location in Fox. He explained that many non- students \do not realize that the living area they are entering is a fraternity. They think it is a continuation of the independent dormitory.\ Pierce stated that his fraternity has on occasion hired Burns guards to provide security during big party weekends. However, he felt that they were not very effective. He indicated that the checking of college identification is ·a more useful approach. All four fraternity presidents felt that Mr. Kleinkauf, the Director of Security, was doing an adequate job in providing Russian Sociologist Relates Problems of Young Souiets Dr. Yuri A.

Union is involved in a very large capital building program and is also running a capital fund campaign. The construction costs and the incoming funds- from the campaign will- hopefully offset each other and the almost nine million dollars the college has borrowed from its endowment will be repayed. · The larger, troublesome, and important question facing the trustees now as financial managers of the college, and every college member as a person who will be affected by their decision, is why should the building program stop now? It seems logical that while the college is wrapped up in going after money, and has already borrowed millions of dollars from itself, it should finish what it has started: uEJois- The Way It Js\- Only The Image Remains By DANNY SLOCKET . \ELVIS ~ The Way It Is~· is now playing at Proctor's. The ads proclaim, \A movie about· him!\ It is not a movie about Presley, or his music, or of his importance as a sociological .phenomenon. The film seems like a \16\ magazine article written by Rex Reed; the last half being devoted to Elvis' opening in Las Vegas. Before we discuss the film, it rnay be a good idea to remember what Elvis Presley once was. In the early fifties, music was a reflection of the calm, scared life most Americans were leading. Joe McCarthy had successfully ca,strated the arts. Then, !lOme Southern greaser started singing a mixture of black blues and country music, and the teenagers found an idol. Presley was thought to be a threat to the American way ot . llte. Ed Sullivan gave him a record salary, then photographed him only from the waist up. Steve Allen, when Presley appeared on his show, assured his audience that only clean family entertainment would be seen. Parker. The lone animal is now a corporate image. The greaser that turned America around no longer exists, but that greaser may no longer be wanted. The film has a, few interviews that show the Presley fans' adulation, but none of them mention liking a snarling hood; to them, Presley is a nice, kind boy who loves his parents and is loved like a brother. So, this brings us to the film. itself, The first thing that must .be kept in mind is that the techrdcal advisor is Col. Tom Parker. This means we see only what Parker wants us to see; nothing will be shown to hurt the Presley image. The second thing to be consjdered is Presley's opening remark, \Hello Hollywood cameras.\ What they purported to show wa$ Elvis, in unguarded moments, rehearsing for his Vegas act.

Union is involved in a very large capital building program and is also running a capital fund campaign. The construction costs and the incoming funds from the campaign will hopefully offset each other and the almost nine million dollars the college has borrowed from its endowment will be repayed. The larger, troublesome, and important question facing the trustees now as financial managers of the college, and every college member as a person who will be affected by their decision, is why should the building program stop now? It seems logical that while the college is wrapped up in going after money, and has already borrowed millions of dollars from itself, it should finish what it has started: Build an Arts Center, renovate Nott Memorial for whatever its future use is decided to be, do a complete renovation on Carnegie, and consider building a new gym and renovating the present gym for use as an administration building. The funds co u 1 d be gotten either from additional borrowing and an extended Capital Fund Drive or the use of capital gains where legally permissable. It is very shortsighted of the trustees to stop the building program in the middle and it is no excuse that they want the operational budget balanced, since the two are entirely unrelated. The important issue is not where the priorities of the college lie, but rather, whether or not the trustees are going to stop, scared, :n a building market which promises ever increasing costs. There is no real sign that the present inflation will suddenly reverse itself but it is clear that buildings built at today's prices will be paid for more easily with tomorrow's inflated dollars. To wait, is to follow the trustees of yore who sacrificed what would become Rockefeller Center, for a few hundred thousand dollars in cash. ---------- With regard to the operating budget there is no doubt that the time has come for some belt tightening. But the brunt of this austerity should be borne by the more established departments and not by the struggling department of the Arts. In this critical period of Union's development when it is obvious that growing numbers of students are eager for instruction in the fine arts, and when the administration has apparently decided not to squelch or ignore this, but rather to passively encourage it, money must be found somewhere - from another department's budget if necessary - to finance the hiring of at least one more professor in Drama, and at least the rebuilding of the light board so that it will last for more • than three performances. uEiois-The Way It Is\- Only The Image Remains By DANNY SLOCKET \ELVIS - The Way It Is\ is now playi,ng at Proctor's. The ads proclaim, \A movie about· him!\ It is not a movie about Presley, or his music, or of his importance as a sociological phenomenon. The film seems like a \16\ magazine article written by Rex Reed; the last half being devoted to Elvis' opening in Las Vegas. Before we discuss the film, it may be a good idea to remember what Elvis Presley once was. In the early fifties, music was a reflection of the calm, scared life most Americans were leading. Joe McCarthy had successfully castrated the arts. Then, some Southern greaser started singing a mixture of black blues and country music, and the teenagers found an idol. Presley was thought to be a threat to the American way ot llte. Ed Sullivan gave him a record salary, then photographed him only from the waist up. Steve Allen, when Presley appeared on his show, assured his audience that only clean family entertainment would be seen. Parents were less than reassured, for their sons started to mimic Elvis in every possible way. No matter what the guy on the comme1cial looked like, the parents knew what Junior wanted the Brylcreem for. Tight pants and bluejeans replaced suits. Disemboweled jazz was replaced by rock-and-roll. If you doubt Presley's influence, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Phil Ochs, the Rolling Stones and many others have admitted that Elvis was the first big influence in their music and lives. Elvis soon found a manager named Col. Tom Parker, and Col. Parker has made sure that Elvis has every avenue to exploit his legend. Every rare interview with Presley is cleared through Parker; the fan clubs, movie projects, music, and concert engagements are all done b; To the Editor: With still a few more gifts expected, the faculty and staff of Union College have exceeded the goal established as their share of the Schenectady County United Fund Drive. The total Fund goal of $1,178,439 was ~8.3 percent subscribed as of November 12. The College raised $9,109 in the 1969 drive. The United Fund goal this year is an increase of 6 percent over last year so that the college goal on the same rate of increase was $9,656. The College was assigned a goal of $9,123 by the United Fund. Thus far the contributors at Union have given $9,816, 107.6 percent of the assigned goal and lO 1. 7 percent of the 6 percent increase goal. On behalf of President Martin and myself, I want to express to the college community our appreciation for their demonstrated concern for our county non-government agencies. I further invite anyone (students included) who would like to help push this drive over the top to bring contributions to my office in the Administration Building. Sincerely, Dale F. Timberlake Comptroller and Treasurer \' \' \' \' To the Editor: Reflecting on Union's current status as a co-educational institution and being personally Parker. The lone animal is now a corporate image. The greaser th.at turned America around no longer exists, but that greaser may no longer be wanted. The film has a few interviews that show the Presley fans' adulation, but none of them mention liking a snarling hood; to them, Presley is a nice, kind boy who loves his parents and is loved like a brother. So, this brings us to the film itself. the first thing that must be kept in mind is that the technical advisor is Col. Tom Parker. This means we see only what Parker wants us to see; nothing will be shown to hurt the Presley image. The second thing to be considered is Presley's opening remark, \Hello Hollywood cameras.\ What they purported to show was Elvis, in unguarded moments, rehearsing for his Vegas act. But Presley is .always aware of the camera. The film is shot in color and Panavision, necessitating strong lights and large cameras. The best dnema- ,verite is with the original print shot in 16mm. Not only is the subject less aware of the camera, but the feeling of intimacy is heightened with a tight shot of the subject filling the screen. .Even the mobility of the camera is an important factor on the film; fast cuts are used to cover the fact that the camera rarely moves.

The reasoning behind the language requirement, my advisor informed me, is that the student should learn something about foreign culture. Some knowledge of foreign culture is necessary, he added, in the event of future travel experiences and because Americans are notoriously poor in their knowledge of such. I could not help but get the impression that the reason for the language requirement is that some years ago, some higher-ups started aware of a sense of nervousness on the part of Skidmore's young damsels and a corresponding lowering of their collective nose, I came upon the following quote by President Emeritus C.A. Richmond of Union College in 1934: \Many believe that the new found liberty which women have achieved but not fully understood has lowered the tone of our women's colleges both in manners and morals.\ Make of it what you will. John Harrigan '73 \' \' \' \' To the Editor: I have unintentionally misinformed students and faculty about one matter covered in the recent statement from the President's Council. The disciplinary body for faculty or professional staff members who may be remanded by the President's Council is not, as stated, the Academic Freedom Committee; it is instead the same committee as t,hat used for students, but supplemented by one Trustee. Whether it was the two-and-a- half day meeting of Trustees or the near-win over Williams that numbed me when I prepared the report on Sunday, I don't know. At any rate, I regret the error. Sincerely, Harold C. Martin President wringing their hands because Americans did not know as much about the Europeans, the Asians, etc. as these people knew about us. In essence, the language requirement falls into the same bag as other required courses . (comp. ed., anyone?). It is just another case of trying to ram something down some unwilling throats. These means are contrary to the ideal end of an educational experience. This end is that the student will find learning a pleasurable experience and will continue to learn eagerly, on his own, for the rest of his life. Required courses make a mockery out of this end which, I am sure, all educators find desirable. Of course, those who advocate required courses might have been faced with the problem of student apathy towards many of the courses they were forced to take if the grading system did not serve admirably as a motivating force. Thus, the already tarnished idea of learning for learning's sake was further reduced to learning for the sake of the grade, learning to please one's parents, learning to get into college, etc. After twelve years of fretting over grades.

Sociological Progress Stymied: Breeding Gfounds of Revolution? By ALAN COHEN I lied. No, I didn't really. Well, at least I didn't mean to. You see, there are other thematic majors at Union College. Actually, most of them are simply interdepartmental majors or in the Communist Studies program, The result is about the same. I don't really care. The point of my last article was not to convince people to become thematic majors and it was more than simply making them aware of the alternative. I want people to question the structure itself that tells them to choose a major. Then, perhaps, the other important questions will follow. The questions involve the nature of freedom. I am ' at totally in accord with the goal of free universities. Freedom must begin at the lowest levels - kindergarten or sooner. If children were left to develop naturally during their years of before college, an academic oriented university might be the perfect follow through. Maybe not. Until self- knowledge is somewhat a part of a .person, other knowledge is just a matter of deceit of fulfilling society's roles. The student has been told all his life about the goals he is supposed to follow. Freud felt that because people are unknowmg (unconscious) of any real meaning to life, they become dissatisfied with and hostile toward life. They are ready to destroy themselves. (Norman . Brown, Life Against Death, Wesleyan University Press, Middletown Connecticut, 1959, p. x.) They make a culture which worships death, as Brown discusses in his book. For examples, ask yourself about flags going to half mast, beautiful cemeteries, elaborate funerals, \better dead than red,\ and the honor of dying for your country. If man knew more about himself, he would want more to live and want to live more. This is Freud's rationale for psychoanalysis; it is my rationale for educational reform. Over the past decade we have seen revolutions for civil rights, peace, ecological control, drugs and other popular movements for change. I use the word \revolution\ because \ significant learning or change in human systems is always explicitly revolutionary: it involves the death of one order and the creation of another.\ (Michael Rossman in Summerhill: For and Against, Hart Publishing Co., New York, 1970, p. 145) Michael Rossman was a leader in the Free Speech Movement of the early '60's at Berkeley who is now free-lar1cing on educational reform. Rossman attempts to bring together the concepts of authoritarianism, the new culture, drugs, revolution, meeting anxiety and channeling aggression and educational reform. Educational reform is a revolution - perhaps it will become the next mass movement once enough people become aware of it. But until we can change the elementary and secondary schools, we must meet their result within the university. We must begin with ourselves. The problem at hand at Union College involves the place of the arts in college life. Arts involves a person's experiencing himself, unlike most of the academic subjects which involve bodies of knowledge. Art seeks wisdom and beauty. Probably not many of the Mountebanks and their supporters consider themselves part of a movement for educational reform. Their goal is specific {\the lighting board\) or in many cases, the future of the arts at Union. Perhaps I am overstepping my rights of definition, but to be concerned with educational reform of the university, the arts mu~t be considered a non-academic right Continued on Page 5

Sociological Progress Stymied: Breeding Grounds of Revolution? By ALAN COHEN I lied. No, I didn't really. Well, at least I didn't mean to. You see, t_here are other thematic majors at Union College. Actually, most of them are simply interdepartmental majors or in the Communist Studies program. The result is about the same. I don't really care. The point of my last article was not to convince people to become thematic majors and it was more than simply making them aware of the alternative. I want people to question the structure itself that tells them to choose a major. Then. perhaps. the other important questions will follow. The questions involve the nature of freedom. I am 1 ~t totally in accord with the goal of free universities. Freedom must begin at the lowest levels - kindergarten or sooner. If children were left to develop naturally during their years of before college. an academic oriented university might be the perfect follow through. Maybe not. Until self- knowledge is somewhat a part of a person. other knowledge is just a matter of deceit of fulfilling society's roles. The student has been told all his life about the goals he is supposed to follow.

For examples, ask yourself about flags going to half mast. beautiful cemeteries, elaborate funerals. \better dead than red.\ and the honor of dying for your country. If man knew more about himself. he would want more to live and want to live more. This is Freud's rationale for psychoanalysis; it is my rationale for educational reform. Over the past decade we have seen revolutions for civil rights, peace, ecological control. drugs and other popular movements for change. I use the word \revolution\ because significant learning or change in human systems is always explicitly revo Jut ionary: it involves the death of one order and the creation of another.\ (Michael Rossman in Summerhill: For and Against, Hart Publishing Co .. ;\lew York. 1970, p. 145) Michael Rossman was a leader in the Free Speech Movement of the carlv ·no·~ at Berkeley who is now free-lallcing on educational reform. Rossman attempts to bring together the concepts of authoritarianism, the new culture. drugs, revolution, meeting anxiety and channeling aggression and educational reform. Educational reform is a revolution - perhaps it will become the next mass movement once enough people become aware of it. But until we can change the elementary and secondary schools. we must meet their result within the university. We must begin with ourselves. The problem at hand at union College involves the place of the arts in college life. Arts involves a person's experiencing himself. unlike most of the academic subjects which involve bodies of knowledge. Art seeks wisdom and beauty. Probably not many of the Mountebanks and their supporters consider themselves part of a movement for educational reform.

And Nothing Was Determined A Loo~ Back In Disgust By MIKE'M::&SEROLE The 1970 elections are over and done with, save three or four still undecided races·. Very quickly, here's what happened; while the ltepubl.icans concentrated on the Senate aad managed a net gain of two .seats, the Democrats · picked up eight seats in. tile House and snatched eleven governorships from the GOP. When the dust had cleared, the Democtf!,ts boasted a 55-45 edge in the Senate, a 254- 180 margin in the House and found themselves at the helm of 29 of 50 possible statehouses. Non-Nixo.n M·an Here To Review Election·s Both sides have claimed victory, and understandably so. The Democrats say they won beca,use not only do they still control Congress, but they have also reversed the GOP majority in governors' mansions. The Republicans say they won because, well, they have to. After all the millions of dollars and Nixon-Agnew speeches that went into this year's elections, there is no way the GOP is going to admit defeat. On Thursday, November 19, at 8:00 in SS 016, The International Relations Club will present Dr. Joel M.

The Airplane, ·like the Stones, is a together band, and when they play, they play as one. Most poeple may be interested in Grace, but on the stage there are no stars; they are all equal, even Pappa John. I really can't say what happened after that, they just went on and on and on. We were all becoming a family, the Airplane and the audience, each bouncing vibes off the other and building. Then, sometime after 3:30 in the morning, Jefferson Airplane played \Volunteers.\ If, at this point, they had yelled, \On to the White House!\ and marched out the door, every last one of us would have followed them. Then it was over. Nancy and I and some friends we'd found all ran downstairs to talk to Jefferson Airplane, rock band.

Termed a medieval rock opera, the show follows the trend set by HAIR several years ago, c~rying the style to a new maturity in such theater experience. The story revolves about the assumption that Joan of Arc; at the last moment repentant of her sins, is freed by the church with the one reservation that she not maintain her identity, another girl being burned in her place. Unlike HAIR and the more refined production YOUR OWN THING, the actors in SAINT JOAN are not singers~ the rock music being performed solely by the band, Ruffin, an Atlanta group which recently appeared with Steppenwolf. It is the integration of serious acting with rock illustration which sets SAINT JOAN off as a new genre in theater experience. Disillusionment with war is the underlying tone of the play; Joan's ambiguous attitude of honor and compassion the most perplexing situation . in the drama~ Unlike the other characters, Joan is not the representation of an attitude, but ratlter an ethic, the American ethic of personal liberty, a birthright which must be preserved through love, concern, and sometimes war. Therein lies the significance of 'I'H E SURVIVAL OF SAINT JOAN. It .is a critical rock .statement which attacks the people who abuse the American ethic rather than the ethic itself. When St. Joan cries \love me!\ she is not demanding a new morality hut an understanding of the old. Mr. Lineberger has succeeded in relating the experience of youth -their plea for conscience - to the ethic of their heritage. - . . \' Personal freedom coute que co~e. Lineberger has challenged his actors by casting each of them into a variety of roles. George , Pentecost who last playeq the embittered party-giver in the Broadway production of THE BOYS IN THE. BAND, and John A. Coe, who· appeared in the Broadway musical 1;.-A STRADA last season come, away as clearly the most seasoned ~ctors in the production. PeteF Lazer, who has run the gamut of television lots ·as a child actor, ha$ an equal tendency to steal the scene when on stage; he has an incredible skill for combining the pathetic and prepostorous elements of the characters he portrays (I cannot· erase from my mind the image of him crawling across the stage as a crippled leper, draped in bandages, laughing insanely as he rattles his clacker). Gretchen Corbett has the most difficult part in the title role of Joan; although she does portray Joan's innumerable moods strikingly she has trouble in developing convincing transitions between moods. Unfortunately the band does not have as tight a control over their composition as might be desired. At times the music becomes gaudy through its clashing of sounds, particularly at the opening of both the first and l'ecortd acts. Equally grating are some of the thematic mo9d shifts. The occasional jumps in musical ideas give the action which it accompanies a di~joirtted feeling. These faults aside, the great preponderance of music is not only enjoyably written but well performed. SAINT JOAN is scheduled to open in New York in mid- December. Anyone interested in the contemporary American stage should make this show a must. While HAIR's significance· lies in its precedence as a new form of statement. its sense of perception . is - wearyingly simplistic. SAINT JOAN hlJs . cleaned up the style, integrated the rock music with a keener sense of acting, and finally reached through all the verbiage of dissent to come up with a refreshing insight into the malfunctions on Americanism. hence. \Ideological majorities\ to the contrary, the Republicans were hurt badly in thl.$ Fall's elections. Paramount on the casualty list is the oft•talked of SoQthern Strategy, and the President himself. The Southern Sttategy died this year, if not, it surely lies in a near fatal coma. Wbere the GOP signed :a pact with Strom Thurmond to court (and later Supreme Court) the South in 1968 in return for heavy presidential support, in. 1970, the alliance stands shattered, broken up by moderate, young Democratic governors like Bumpers, West, Carter and AskeW who offer their constituents more hepe than Sen. Thurmond. Of the eleven Southern states; six (Ark, Fla; Ga, N.C., S.C;, and Texas) are in moderate Democratic hands, three (Miss, La, and Ala) constitute Wallace Country, and only two (Tenn and Va) are run by Republican governors. In 1972, on.Ly Thurmond; Baker of Tennessee; and Tower of Texas will be seeking re-election as -Southern Senators on the GOP side, while the Sparkman, McClellan, Russell, Ellender, Eastland mob will run for the- Democrats. The very likely combination of a George Wallace candidacy, old Democratic muscle and new Democratic energy could have tire President and his party looking elsewhere. As for the President himself, of the five main 1970 Administration issues, the people rejected the President on four of them. Nixon successfully diffused Vietnam as a major problem this year and the vast majority of the cou,ntry respected the policy by not complaining about it. But the public ·expects the war to be over .by '72 and Nixon more or less has to comply. If the President can count Vietnam as a triumph, he certainly got clobbered by the state of the economy. The Democrats exploited the faulty ec~momy' for all it was Worth, a task that should prove easier and even mote productive in '72 if Nixon can't turn the tide. party unity he can get. ' · The Democratic Party, on the other hand, has emerged from. · the off~year elections in good shape, and nobody is in. better shf!.pe than Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine. Mr. Muskie has the unenvied role of Presidential frontrunner, (.Jem:ge Romney style, two years before the national election.. Unlike Romney, however, · Mus·kie should stay in front. Decried within Democratic ranks for his Downeast Yankee cool and mild manner in the 24 mort~hs following his unsucceS!!ful, J>ut highly personable run fo~ . the Vice Presidency, Muskie is now, more than ever, the acknowledged unofficial leader for the Democratic nomination as President. At no time during the campaign was this more draniatically demonstated than election eve when the Republicans put ,President Nixon on nationwide television to plead the GOP cause and the Democrats countered with Muskie. The RepuMican presentation had the President ranting and raving (on grade B videotape) in Phqenix about law and order and his near riot at San Jose. The Democratic show had Sen. Muskie, sitting very clam and very cool in a leather chair, in front of an old fire place . in· Maine counseling America against the. \politics of fear.\ B·oth performances were impressive, the President's in a negative way and Mnskie's in a highly positive sense. · The perfect Democratic ticket would team · Mu$kie · with a young, energetic, but loyal Southerner, that would link North and South for the Democrats. Lt. Gov. Barnes of Texas would be a nice choice, having just pulled down 70% of the Texas v()te. If Wallace runs, Nixon is out of luck down South, so he will have. to win big out West and through the Midwest · where he took some hard lumps this .Fall. It should be interesting, whateyer happens.

Continued from Pag~ l surveying the scene early yesterday afternoon with \Amira and several other PYE Club members, Wilber refuted Lilley~s expfaniltion oC a: single laundromat as the sewage problem's source. Wilber did not rule out the possibility, however, that .several homes or businesses m::ty be illegally linked to the ~torm sewer . line. He adniitted that it is almost impossible for his :department to check on a contractor once he has submitted his plans and started construction. Wilber commented further that it is possible that the boards blocking . the closed-do·wn spillway shutes may have rotted, thUs allowing a runover flow to enter the storm drain. He pl'omised to check city sewer line plans in hopes of tracing the source of the waste, and vowed to report his findings immediately to the City Engineer's Office. If it turus out that there is .a home, or even severaL homes, illegally tapped into the storm sewer instead of a sanitary line, the city could take action according to Chapter 32, Section 32-2 of the Schenectady City Code. According .. to this regulation, all residents of the city are prohibited from dumping any sort of \Waste ... or ... unhealthful, noxious\ material in improper places. If the offender cannot, or will not, obtain a contractor to remedy the situation in time, the city is empowered by Regulations 32-6 and 32-7 of the City Code to perform the work itself and then charge the offender for the labor on his city tax bill. Amini is definitely not satisifed with the explanation offered by Lilley and the City Engineer's office. \What if the city is the offender, instead of a private homeowner?\ he asked. \It seems strange to me that suddenly the City Engineer~s Office is taking all the cre4it for locating the cause of the problem, after not even notifying the department whose responsibility it is to check irtto these violations for 16 years!\ when they are not in their rooms.

Unlike fossil-fueled power plants, nuclear plants don't burn anything to make electricity. And where there's no fire, there's no smoke. ' But there's a possible disadvantage as well.lt, too, is environmental. Thermal effects. We recognize it. One GE advertisement you may have seen recently pointed out that \all nuclear power plants discharge heat, as do fossil-fueled plants. America's utilities, with many years of experience, are working on thermal problems at nuclear sites on a plant-by-plant basis.\ · General Electnc does talk about thermal effects. Because they are -important, but also because we feel the facts about them are perhaps too little known. Few people realize, for example, th.af federal law requires utilities to operate their plants within strict temperature limits. Thirty states have even stricter laws. Utilities are spending millions of dollars on dilution flow systems, cooling ponds and cooHng towers to comply. But, in addition, utilities are sponsoring basiC-research on the problem of heat exchange and its effect on aquatic life. More than 97 utilities have been financially involved in over 300 such studies. And each one adds a little to man's scientific understanding of the problem. Some interesting things have a1ready come of it For one, it's been found that, in some cases, adding heat to water can actually be beneficial, Warm irrigation water has extended growing seasons. Warm water has created new wintering ponds along waterfowl migration routes. · Power-plant discharge water is reviving Long Island's oyster trade. Florida is using it to grow shrimp and lobster. In Texas, it's increasing the weight of commercial catfish by as much as 500%. Listing these benefits is not to beg the issue. Thermal effects remain a tough problem to solve at some sites.

Boyle adroitly interprets Joe's character, from the broadest statements and gesticulations to the most subtle nuances of facial and physical expression. He inflates the character with such life, that Joe could at any moment walk off the screen and sit down next to anyone. in the audience (after buying his popcorn of course). Technically, the film ranges from excellent to poor, the· direction is simple and unoptrusive. The screenplay, often either broadly or subtley humorous until the tragically depressing climactic scene, varies from the extremely realistic to soap-opera cliche to fantasy..;Jike melodrama. ster~otyp.ed hard-hat will laugh at Joe's actions and statements and ultimately denounce his use of violence, . All the time however, he will graphically reinforce in their minds that this is the typical hard-hat. Conservatives who are similar to· Joe will believe in Joe as a god, or at least the prototype : of themselves, and admire the actions he takes. Conservatives who are more intelligent than Joe will reali:,;:e he is being ridiculed by the makers of the film, but nevertheless, tq various d.egrees, will share his .beliefs and admire qr condone his actions, ~Middle­ class businessmen will either sympathize with the advertising executive, again, to varying degrees, or else condemn his actions, not realizing how similar their own beliefs and desires are to his. The only young people in the film are depicted as hippies who take drugs, have orgies, tell lies, and steal. This again only serves to reinforce the Views of .conservatives. Therefore, even thouKh\Joe'' is (as .the production notes .state) \a timely commentary on the consequences of radical violence in America,\. only those of us who already realize the consequences will understand this theme of the film.

LEVINE For the last t:ew years. there ha~ been a definite need for a film that would honestlv and thoughtfully deal with the widening gap bet~een Amt:ricans. the old and the young, the political left and the political right. the middle class and the working class. the students and the police. This past year. '\1th the hope of cashing in on the unexpectedlv record- hreak ing success of \E;sv Rider\ Ia rge H oil)\\ ood studios and small independent companies produced such an awesome number of films. dealing with these contemporary conflicts. that the market for such films w~s glutted to the point of chcked cliche. The most disheartening fact abont the rash of ~ontemporary socially conscwus. fil~s made primarily to expoht liberals, particularly young liberals, is not so much their quantity alone, but rather their lack of quality. That is, in the process of turning out so many liberal youth-oriented films of poor quality, the film companies have just about precl~ded ~he possibility of crea~mg such a film of good quahty. And even if this honest and thoughtfully created good film were to filter through the dregs around it, it is questionable w?ether people would actually still be mterested in such an overexploited topic. One of the better films of this genre, and I greatly emphasize the comparative nature of the word \better\, is the film \Joe.\ It is a story about a middle-class advertising executive type and a working-class type who. for all their cu-ltural difference~, find a common bond in their hatred for the drug-oriented, radical, hippie youth. From this thumbnail sketch the film, indeed, could be an hone~t and thoughtful attempt by a soc1ally conscious filmmaker to ?eal with an extremely pressmg contemporary problem. Unfortunately, it isn't. And if good intentions were behind the making of the film (although in retrospect, this seems increasingly doubtful). we can only be terribly disappointed that they were not realized. Since I did emphasize that \Joe\ is better than other films of its genre, we should explore its few good qualities. before tackling its failings. Perhaps. the two most gratifying aspects of the film are the creation of the title character. Joe. and the performance Peter Bovle offers this role.

Peter Boyle embodies the character of Joe so convincingly, that he seems to be a man off-the- street playing himself. His performance. however. is actuallv a showcase for superb acting ability. considering that offscreen he is a college-educated. soft- ~poken. confe:,sed-liberal.

He inflates the character with such life, that Joe could at any moment walk off the screen and sit down next to anyone in the audience (after buying his popcorn of course). Technically, the film ranges from excellent to poor, the direction Is simple and unobtrusive. The screenplay, often either broadly or subtley humorous until the tragically depressing climactic scene, varies from the extremely realistic to soap-opera cliche to fantasy-like melodrama. The supporting players, . all unknown actors, basically with television experience, run the gamut of acting ability. K. Callan plays Joe's wife as convincingly as Peter Boyle plays Joe. Dennis Patrick and Audrey Caire as the advertising executive and his wife are both veterans of television, he of TV series and soap operas, she of TV series and commercials. Unfortunately they have not changed their acting styles (or is it abilities?) for this film. The basic idea that the film conveys is commendable. That is, the conservative forces of America, the troops of the right, are not only hard-hats, but a large part of both the working- class and middle-class, in general. Many wealthy businessmen do believe in Wallace-Procacino law- and order and do vehemently despise long-haired youth. The ~xecution of this idea, however, 1s the root of the film's major failing.

The group came out without Paul or Grace apparently being due to have a baby any day tires a chick out after a threeuhour set (this chick asked me the day of the concert if Grace'd be singing, and I said I'd been told she would be. \I knew she would,\ the chick said). Jorma cranked up his guitar and the 'Plane burst into music they .obviously enjoyed doing .. Nothing off their albums, at least not off any y,et released. Great acid music, with Jorma's axe moving through it like a neddle, and Paul Cassidy - who was the most spaced I've ever seen a human being - throbbing his bass like a giant heart, the heart of th~ Airplane. After a couple numbers. they brought on this ancient black cat named Pappa John, who plays blues violin, of all things. Jesus H. Christ, could that man play! Just as well as Jorma, but with a feeliJ:ig that comes only with age. He's been travelliJJ.g with the group for the past six months and he's going to stick with them for a while.

But, let us face it, boys and girls ~ when one speak of Jefferson Airplane, one speaks of Grace Slick, God, what a great lady she is!

The group came out without Paul or Grace apparently being due to have a baby any day tires a chick out after a three-hour set (this chick asked me the day of the concert if Grace'd be singing, and I said I'd been told she would be. \I knew she would,\ the chick said). Jorma cranked up his guitar and the 'Plane burst into music they obviously enjoyed doing. Nothing off their albums, at least not off any yet released. Great acid music, with Jorma's axe moving through it like a neddle, and Paul Cassidy - who was the most spaced I've ever seen a human being - throbbing his bass like a giant heart, the heart of the Airplane. After a couple numbers, they brought on this ancient black cat named Pappa John, who plays blues violin, of all things. Jesus H. Christ, could that man play! Just as well as Jorma, but with a feeling that comes only with age. He's been travelliJig with the group for the past six months and he's going to stick with them for a while. If the reception he gets at the Fillmore is like the one he got at Albany, Bill Graham had better turn up the sound-system. But, let us face it, boys and girls - when one speak of Jefferson Airplaae, one speaks of Grace Slick. God, what a great lady she is! Out she comes ia her tall black boots, short bl1:1e skirt and fish-net top. Her hair is perfectly raven. Her eyes a,re those of a woman, and if that sounds dumb to you, then you haven't yet grabed the fact that, most chicks never get to be women. Her belly is bulging with another life beneath it, b-ut ~t's very wel!l concealed by the folds of the fish-net.

The first is to take pledges from 1 stu(lents and all others who m~y be listening to help raise part of the money needed to buy the lighting board which is so desperately needed by the Art Department. The second major objective, and probably the most important, is to establish a forum for many of the different questions and problems that are plaguing the campus. The students of Union College at the present time are responsible for approximately 50% of the annual income of the college, according to the President's recent report on the budget. Of immediate importance to many of the studtmts is the cause of expansion <;~f the Arts here which seems to be playing LAST fiddle, behind everything else. Also of immediate, as well as long range importance, is the question of priorities... where money wiU be spent. President Martin announced publicly this past Monday night that students now and for a lorig time to come will have virtually no say in the priorities of the college. All money raised by pledges made during the marathon show will be presented to the Administration not only to express the need for ·the new lighting board but to express a student opinion ·that they should have a, definite say in the priorities of the college. Also to be discussed during the weekend will be the question of college governance, This is essentially the broadest and most important question of all.

The division of So.cial Sciences (Economics, History, Political Science, and Sociology} of Center I met yesterday afternoon to take up and decide on the question of major field examinations (comprehensive exams) within its division. Following one and one half bouts of presentation and discussion by members of the departments, the dean of Center I, and two student r.epresentatives, a motion, presented by Professor 1 onas and worded by Professor Board, ·was passed to replace the previously required general comprehensive exams With \some form of e~aJ)1_ination\ that would compleme-nt the requited senior project. As opposed to the requirements of the past school year, the Jonas-Board motion, carried by an 18-2 vote, means three things: 1. The comprehensive exam, as it has been known in the past, is no longer required; 2. The senior project, as in the past, is still required; 3. Some form of e)(amination or evaluation is also required, the specific form being left to the individual department. The importance of the motitm and its difference in form from past policy lies in the ability of the individual departments to determine the nature of its own examination. while to the best of his More important than the knowledge no formal policy has actual motion itself is the manner been reached, the consensus was with which each department has to retain comps, but as in decided to procede in this area.

Wednesday, December 16, 1970. Ask around are studentese .for major field exams, and for the last ·three years or so have rivaled the Draft as the chief concern for undergraduates approaching and . well into, their Senior year. This concern has not been lost on the faculty, and in the latest meeting to deal with the problem, the· Social Sciences Division .of Center 1 (taking in the Economics,. History; Political Science, and Sociology Depart- ments), voted Thursday to repfu.ce the old required comps with a looser examination policy that would combine with the required Senior Project. For the most part this means that there will be no more written major field exams in Social Sciences. Using Political Science and History as examples; a.11 oral ·examination will be given instead of following up the Senior Project. While many called the oral a \defense\ of the Project, Prof Board, in an interview together with Prof. Jonas, preferred to call it \an oral elaboration,\ .and emphasized that such an oral exam was not an intensive grilling of all the student's prior knowledge in the field. These orals involve · the student, his Project sup~rvisor, another instructor in the department and an· · otl~si~e examiner from· an¢ther institution. Prof. Board says that the past oral eXa.ms have been very · successful and stimulating and not nearly as excruciatingly painful as some students think. Indeed many profssors are miffed at the student claims of \unfair\ saying that: a.) these students have never taken the exams, b.) their fear is based on the premise that a bad exam can negate four years of work - which isn't so, and c.) that .the fact is, these exams are to. find dut what the student knows, not what he doesn't know - if that were the case., the student wouldn't have a chance. Student objection has been ~ntered on the comprehensive exam issue, it hasn't questioned the required Senior Project, which covers two terms, and the gist 'of the Jonas-Board plan is to do away w~th the written comps and have oral exams that stem from the Senior Project.

I think it's time these things were called to the attention of everybody. 0 think I speak for many. And while we're on the subject I would like to announce that when I return to Union this spring I am going to run for Vice- President on the glatfonn ( if Dennis is willing) that Dennis Peksin will return next year or fight. My party is called the Cultural-Humanist-Punsters. I ask all to join party in order to wrench the Social Committee from the hands of the present. At this time my choice for treasurer is Jon Pepper '73, my choice for secretary is Stu Brownlee '72, and my choice for President is Bill Adams. The present situation may change although, and I hope it does, because I would prefer to for details and my address. If-----·-~------------~-------.-..., Remember always that laughter When it was called to my attention that a policeman had been hired for each door at the Tull concert in the Field House, I was disturbingly amused. Whose brainstorm, may I ask, was that idea? I have listened to all you pollyannas complain incessantly about the fact that a fantastic Social Committee killing just ·barely breaks even. I'm not sure how much it costs to rent a cop for a night, but I do know that for two free tickets any ht.tsky football player from DU would have stood at the door without a uniform, without a gun, and . without a boxclock handcuffed to his wrist. Were the guns there in order to keep the U Coli Maoists from stirring up hundreds of smashed turtling fraternity fops from tearing the Field House apart? The worst that could have come from such an eventuality would have been a few smashed chairs and a lot of beer and vomit splashed around. But since black guys and girls have arrived on campus, turtling is dead. Therfor~. if you follow my logic, there was nothing to fear from the voice of the turtle. I wandered with my briefcase and twelve year old kid from Schenectady in and out of 75% of the living residences on campus and found all of them virtually deserted, rooms open, valuables exposed. Unfortunately my parents brought me up to be honest or else I wouldn't have to work this Christmas season. Why were cops at eve.ry door of the Field House and nowhere to be seen around the dorms? Is Union College that afraid of it~ own and Schenectady's masses· that it does not realize that one thief or lunatic can do mote damage in fifteen minutes than a mob in forty? I must say that the entire situation reeks of the politics of is the essence of life, that music is the essence of laughter, and that Adolf Hitler loved music, but that his ~aughter was perverse. Regards, George Hayman Herman's Function Is Mostly Unction Dr. RobertS. Herman, chairman of the Department of Economics at Union College, today was named Senior Po~t Laureate of the National Association of Professional Bureaucrats (NATAPROBU), an organization of corporate, academic and governmental bureaucrats dedicated to dynamic inaetivism. \Competition for this distinguished post was keen,\ said Dr. James · H. Boren, NATAPROBU President. \In fact, Dr. Herman almost lost out because he failed to provide a security clearance and to fill out an application form.\ The Bureaucratic Function Jn Modem Government The bureaucratic function Is mostly unction. Boren said that Herman's Politicians and the Bureaucracy letter, alth·ough violating Politicians come, NATAPROBU philosophy by its _ Politicians go, informality, won the coveted post. But the status of bureaucracy Boren noted that Herman did Is quo! not ask to be poet laureate, but requested that he be ·made \a Deputy Commissioner in Charge of Developing a Conceptual Framework for Versifying the Infrastructure.\ Also, Boren said, Herman promised, in submitting his two poems, that \If accepted, I shall write more - · after developing alternative means of reaching the objective, classifying these, sorting out priorities, optimizing the implications, implementing, and, of course, doing an evaluation of the entire methodology.\ Boren commented: \Who could resist a bureaucrat who so truly has captured the spirit of dynamic inactivism?'' Herman~s two poems, in entirety , fo.llow: Besides his chairmanship at Union College, Herman is adjunct professor at State University of New York. He has held top teaching and lecturing posts, government positions in New York State, and at national and international levels. These range from Executive Assistant to the Minority Leader of the New York State Senate to being consultant to foreign governments and missions in Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Ecuador, tndia, Greece, Peru, Venezuela, Nigeria, Turkey, Guatemala, and at the United Nations.

PAGE6 CONCORDIENSIS, NOV. 20, 1970 Treasury Committee Reports The estimated total income from the Student Tax is $96,000. This substantial increase is a result of the increase in the Student Tax passed by the Senate and the Board of Trustees last year. At the present time funds have been allocated to one new organization, the French Club, one re-instituted activity, The Chess Club, and to 35 other student activities. Total allocations amounted to $91,242.00. As a result of the agreement with the Board of Trustees, las! years tax increase must hold for at least three years. In anticipation of increasing costs, it was decided that a total of not Itlore than $93,000 would be allocated this year. This leaves a contingency fund of $1,758 to be used for the remainder of this school year. The remaining $3,000 will be placed in our reserve account to be used in the 1972-73 school year. In this manner; we hope to have $96,000 in next year's budget, and $99,000 in the 1972-73 school year.

Are Your franks All Bee(,, Or Are They Just Baloney? By ALAN COHEN The topic was \Issues of Consumer Protection as they relate to Corporate Responsibility.\ As soon as I heard that I was ready to leave, but being the student I am, I stuck. The man in the sixty dollar suit that looked like it was worn on a daily basis was Ralph Nader, the Harvard law-schooi gradu!lte and celebrated champion of the ignorant consumer. The young lovelies of Skidmore who filled College Hall heard the Dean's introduction of the man who shows that \the system can work.\ This stayed with me all evening. There actually are people who feel that way. So, my open mind heard the humble Nader lambast every one and everything. His concerns are for safety and health. He questioned the university's concern with these areas: \The more important a problem is, the less attention the university gives to it.\ But he didn't blame that university because it is difficult to analyze safety and health because they are ignored by the empowered institutions. Nader said that it is not enough for us to pass laws, because there is no one to enforce them. Pollution should not only be thought of as smelling and looking ugly - it is violence. People should not have to adjust their lives to risking dangers; \technology should :adjustto human beings.\ I was really glad I had stayed. There are fantastic detection systems in missiles and spaceships, but nothing in automobiles. Car manufacturers are concerned with style - never efficiency, repair, maintenance or safety. He called the corporations \radicals\ who constantly violate every rl).le of the fundamental American value system. They are only concerned with reducing costs and maximizing sales, never worrying about the people. They tell \outright lies\ when corporation heads say that \the technology does not exist to control pollution.\ In the government, laws to combat pollution are either ••non- existent, inadequate or not enforced.\ asked to show efficiency and cut In the average \all-beef\ costs.

The Buffalo Soldier will play its new release, \The Land of Perdition\ a musical peace essay in the contemporary idiom. The group is well known on the east coast & upstate N.Y. not only for its musical talent but also for its showmanship on stage. Virgin and Chadz, two college groups, will rotate with the Buffalo Soldier for continuous non-stop music at the affair. The event is staged by Radio WSNY as a benefit for Siena Campus Radio Station WVCR; the station. needs new engineering equipment for their broadcasting to the Siena dorms. There will be door prizes, two $10 dance contests and beer on tap (college ID req11ired).

Gibbons Hall is the first b11ilding on the left immediately- after drivin~ past the main Siena By DANNY SHOCKET Lance Falducciwitz, leading, Union radical, has fled the campus and probably the state, the FBI told Concordiensis last night. Falducciwitz is wanted for the bombings of several local banks and a Wetson's. Falducciwitz has not been seen for the past several days. His off- campus house has been deserted for that time, and the police have given up the 24 hour stake-out around the suspect's home. F~lducciwitz•s parents have refused to talk to the press, but students close to the family are sure that Mr. and Mrs. Falducciwitz have no knowledge of their son's whereabouts. Lance's brother Jamil has returned to classes after being interrogated by the police. Lance was a Concordy staff member, and the mood in the newspaper's office was one of disbelief. \Lance was a quiet, intense sort of guy,\ said Peter Weingold. \I and every member of my staff. was shocked when we learned of Lance's activities. Looking back on it, I still can't understand it. Lance was just not the type to be involved in bombings. Though of course I disagree with his activities, I can't help hut wish the man good luck.\ William Ouzer, retiring managing editor, added,\ Lance wasn't the type to want to set the world on fire. While other people would ask about God and the meaning of life Lance would only ask where Bob Levine bou~t his sweaters. I am just totally overwhelmed, I mean he wasn't even an arts major or anything. What can I say, his Algerian is very poor and he certainly can't make a living pushing free Lance movie reviews. He'll probably go underground and 0 D. By the way it wasn't him who hit the Wetson's.\ The bombings began Tuesday, October 22, when American National Bank on Jay Street burst into flatnes and was totally demolished. The IGW Trust, Banker's Savings and Loan, County Federation, and Schenectady Midland were also the victims of the bombings. The police, with the help of the FBI, soon found an informer who led them to Falducciwitz. Due to a series of 'mishaps, Lance eluded the authorities. Lance is now one of the Ten Most Wanted radicals in the country, the first virgin to make the list. If caught, Lance will be invited to address convocations throughout the country.

Dr. Ungerleider's objectivity was underscored by a series of antidrug cartoons that were shown. The cartoons (made by Hanna-Barbara, the people who unleashed Yogi Bear upon an u1;1suspecting world) could best be described as inept preaching.

Mter some time, however, he relinquished his presidency, because he found a faithful discharge of its duties incompatible with those of his ministry. In 1791, he was invited to the third Presbyterian church in Philadelphia. ·Here he continued until the year 1795, when he was chosen president of Union College. His principal inducement to each of these removals was the hope of establishing his health. While he resided there, he actually regained it, and in answer to the repeated solicitations of his congregation in Philadelphia, returned to that city in May 1799.

Nesbitt Caps Fine Year; Cops Third At IC4A'-s By GREG HAMLIN Who knows what Garnet cross- country runner Bob Nesbitt can't second best runner, was competing against pneumonia at Ellis Hospital. Bryant Moeckel turned in the best showing for the decimated squad. He copped the 48th spot in the varsity race. On Today's Scene A Year ·For Sophomores With BILL HOLLERAN The Garnet gridders have recently completed a highly satisfying 5-4 season, Union's second winning campaign in three years. Even though the schedule ended on a very sour note with the unexpected 26.:6 loss to fired-up Hamilton, the Gamet ,proved themselves in the first eight games as a gritty defensive ballclub with much offensive potential, especially on the grovnd. Few p~ople, including thi~ reporter, expected the gridders to do as well as they did· this fall - especially against such highly- regarded squads as St. Lawrence, Middle bury, Rochester, Williams, and Alfred. The Dutchmen lost to the latter three teams, but by no more than an eyelash. Much of the credit for the season must be given to a surprising corps of sophomores, which occupied 15 of 22 starting positions when the season got underway against Worcester. The sophs made their presence felt the most on defense, where the youth movement filled six starting berths and made the .big plays game after game, especially inside their own 20 yardline. Tim Foley, in the secondary; Aldo Virasi, Tom Anacker, Don LeBart, and Gerry Kendrick, at linebacker; and Charlie -weekes, on the line, all deserve plaudits. They helped fashion a defense which allowed only 12.5 points per game. in. s,pite of the final 26- 6 embarrassment at Hamilton - the defenders' worst performance of the campaign. ·Ironically enough, the defense, obviously the Garnet's strongest suit this fall, will suffer the most because of graduation. Star safetyman Paul Ramsey, defensive guard Tom Duffy, linebacker Steve French, and tackle Rit Gallucci will all be lost in the spring. Defensive coach Gerry Everling will have to work hard to fill the spots vacated by these players, especially Gallucci. Teamed with Weekes, the 220- pounder helped to give Union one of the .strongest pass rushes in Eastern small college football. The Dutchmen will look to either A1 Schade or Mike Martin to fl.ll Gallucci's spikes . A somewhat frightening preview of what can happen without both Gallucci and Weekes unfelded at Hamilton. last weekend, when Martin and Schade replaced the injured tackles (Weekes left the contest in the second quarter; GallUcci did not play at all~ and. fell far short of filling the bilL The weakened pass rush enabled Continental quarterb!lck Mark Rice to decimate the Game~ secondary, as he passed for 217 yards and three scores. On offense, the soph stam!outs were John Swanko at halfback and Bart Conrad at end. Swanko gained. 742 yards and a modern single-season rushing record, while Conrad led th~: team In pass receptions. Curtis Rowe, the other sophomore in the backfield, was plagued often by fumble-itis but still managed to average about three yards per carry. Junior Rick Jaszczak and Joe Kirkup rounded out the Garnet corps of running backs.

Rearic 1 s and Hogan's inability to direct the complex 'Garnet Wishbone T attack was probably the t:llain teason for Union's offensive misfires early in the year. The Garn~t's passing ga:me was also not up to par this season, with Rearic and Hogan completi11g less than 40% of their passes and suffering 14 interceptions in the process.

Last Monday, Nesbitt added to his string of fine performances this season, finishing a remarkable tliird in the freshman section of the College Division IC4A Championships. The Main flash's showing was the best ever by a Garnet harrier. Cofnplex Triple Option: · Whether youl:e into John Sebastian or Johann Sebastian, you shOuld conie Nesbitt, who was competing with an injury that had forced him to miss all of the previous week's work-outs, seemed to thrive on the top-flight competition. Yor much of the race, in fact, the Dutchman was in front of the eventual winner, an American International harrier. Nesbitt finished a mere I 5 seconds off the champion'r pace. Ed Wagner also did weli in the freshmen run, finishing in the 48th position. The varsity squad did not send a complete contingent to the Championships. The reasons for th1s were two-fold - Nesbitt and Wagner were not eligible to compete in the varsity contest since they were freshmen, and Tim McCabe, the Garnet'F In Use Again Next Year? An important question for football coach George Flood to consider during the off-season is whether or not to use the Triple Option again next season. Many players admit openly that they do not like the complex attack, and one wonders if perhaps Union football should forego the intricate Wishbone T until it can boast big, fast backs like Steve Worster, or. shifty quarterbacks like James Street or Eddie Phillips. In all honesty, however; the Triple Option did produce impressive Garnet rushing totals later in the season~ and things could be even better next year with a seasoned backfield. The Dutchmen can count on a wealth of quality running backs next fall, as Al Albano, Bruce Mathias, and Stan White, all top prospects on this fall's 2-2-l frosh squad, will move up to the varsity in hopes of breaking into the starting lineup. The frosh will be attempting to wrest jobs away from John Swanko, Rich Jaszczak, and Curtis Rowe.
