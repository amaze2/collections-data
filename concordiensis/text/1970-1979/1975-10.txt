Union's candidate for Michelin's stellar rating, the restaurant/pub, will become a reality this year. Underground rumors which surfaced toward the end of the summer held that the ptib was doomed due to loss of backing. Thanks to the gifts of anonymous donors over the summer, construction began last week, to be completed within 120 days, by terms of the agreement with the contractors. Craig Carlson, project coordinator, estimates that the pub will be ready for business by February. Passed at the Trustees' June meeting, the pub is funded in part by $60,000 from money earmarked for the development of the Student Center; in the main by $90,000 in gifts, of which approximately $3,200 was pledged by some· 200 students. Student trustee Geoff Taylor who, along with former student trustee Bruce Sostek ('75), was instrumental in the advancement .pLthe project, has credited the size of the student contributions with favorably influencing the Board's decision. The efforts of two of the members of t:he Board of Trustees, Kenneth Whalen ('49), Chairman of the Student Affairs' Committee, arid Gerard ·Neumann ('36); Chairman of the Buildings and Ground Committee (both standing committees of the Jloard), Were_ equally important for the realization of the Pub. The Pub, which will be located in the basement of Carnegie, is designed to be an alternative to the Skeller, sans jukebox, pinball machines, and foosball table. Carlson hopes that the Pub will provide a place where students, faculty, staff, and administrators will be able to meet in a quiet and relaxed atmosphere. Many of the final specifications for the Ptrb' depend upon the choice of manager, who will be in charge of the Pub's operation. Notification of an opening for the manager's position has been sent to various schools of hotel and restaurant management, and Carlson hopes to have the position filled by the first week of December to allow the new manager time to become acquainted with Union and the college's goals for the Pub. At present, _contingent upon the manager, Carlson is planning to have the pub open from mid- morning, when some sort of refreshments would be available, until midnight or later. Meals would be served only at specific times, although the facility would be open continuously with light Continued on Page 9 Although a greater geographic distribution in the class of 1979 was one of the main goals of the Admissions Office, Craig Carlson, Assistant DirectQJl of Admissions, explained that it takes time to establish a firm base in areas which have not contributed applicants to Unian in the past. \We have tried to focus in the mid-Atlantic region (Virginia, Washington, D.C., Matyland, and Pennsylvania),\ Carlson remaFked, \but to tnake yourself known you have to establish your credentials firmly. h is impossible to go to an area on an infrequent · basis and expect to receive a lot of applications from people in \We're very concerned with the drop in SAT scores,\ Carlson stated. \We would like, of course, to have' many more members of the freshman class with SAT scor~s in the 600's, but these are the same kids who are accepted at both Union and the Ivy League schools and choose the l~tter.\ Carlson explained further that ~ven though the raw score averages in SATs are dropping, the percentile averages are remaining constant. In other - words, although the scores may have declined ten to twenty points in the last four years, Union is still receiving most of its applications from the top twelve to thirteen per cent of those students who take the test.

Gives that region.\ · ''The Office of External Affairs has helped us out a lot,\ continued Carlson, in reference to the massive J)'ublic relations campaign that Union is in -the process of mounting. \As Union becomes more well-known in regions that are not familiar with the College, 1 it will aid in broadening the geographic distribution .of our applicants.\ Academically, this .class, like its Carlson explained that \the Admissions Committee has p.laced mo-re emphasis on academic success in secondary scb:ool than on scores in standardized tests.

Oral Presentatio~n by CATHY MARTHY \If you don't like to hear the words, 'fuck, suck and cunt' you had better leave.\ Guest lecturer AI Goldstein, publisher of \Screw\ magazine, appropriately, introduced his topic in this warning statement. The audience disengaged themselves from the complimentary copies of \Screw\ that had been distributed before the speaker appeared, and the stage was set. Although somewhat hampered by the lack of a sound system, Mr. Goldstein projected his voice adeuqately for the comfortably crowded chapel. The lecture was flooded with \dirty\ terms but such words were used so often that they retained no shock value for the audience. Mr. Goldstein talked about the magazine's history and his own feelings concerning the content of his publication. \Screw\ was the first magazine to picture full frontal nudes,. setting a new s ta n.dard for est a b lis he,d publications. A circulation of I 00,000 copies a week testifies to the magazine's popularity, though \Screw's\ distribution is limited because newsdealers are fearful of being al'rested for carrying it. Goldstein, who Jra:s .Spent upwards of $200;000 in legal fees amassed over his 25 convictions, contends that he had been denied the right to freedom of speech that the U.S. Constitution allows. Mr. Goldstein candJdty expressed his ow-n feeling~>about \Screw.\ That he was capitalizing on and exploiting sex, the speaker readily admitted this as he stated, ''I' felt so guilty, I went out and bought a 1975 Rolls Royce. •• A salary ·of more than $100,000 a year helps to make amends for the inconvenience!> the speaker has endured over his publication. One of Goldstein's reasons for publishing \Screw\ is to satiate the desires of the \blue collar\ class that doesn't have easy access to the elite sex market.

First, there are only a few grade levels in. general use, '- and therefore a large percentage of the students in a course must receive the same grade, and secondly, students do not generally cluster into three (or perhaps four)· distinct categories - rather, measures of their performance approximate a continuous distribution. There are undoubtediy cases where (because of course structure, teaching methods, or happenstance} gra,des .~ll!StC(r . l}ic.ely intQ '4's,.

A change in the grading system could do much to remedy the inequity. One system- proposed ' last year ~ .would ; incorporate pluses and minuses into the present system. Under this system, the high B stud~nt (most likely in , the upper third of the clfiss) would get a grade close to that of the A student, and . sit\)sta:ntially higher. than :that received :by the low>lr 'student,. who may in fact be in the lower third of the class.

Strolling out of AD Phi and heading toward Jackson's Gar.den were approximately twenty individuals, fully bedecked in Medieval garb. These persons are members of the Society for Creative Anacronisms and practice various customs of the Medieval lifestyle. The SCA, which has been in existence for a 'iitile more than·!(} years, ortgmated on the West Coast. at the University of California at-Berkeley. It was here that a student of Medieval literature chose to exercise her eccentricity, and staged a tournament in the Medieval tradition. Since that time the idea has spread across the U.S., and the SCA has grown in membership to 5000 people, many of whom do not actively participate, but take a .great interest in the society's endeavors. The Kingdoms Union lies within the Eastern Kingdom~ the Society has divided the United States into four separate kingdoms, each with their • own Baronies and ptin~ipalit1es. King Asbjorn, ruler of the Eastern Kingdom, explains that those in the society try, to the best of their abilities, to pattern their life style, dress, and speech after those of Medieval times when tourneys and festivals are held. The king realizes that several inconsistencies exist, notably in political structure and clothing. Sir Frederick of Scotland expla.ns there are very few primary sources after which costumes can be modeled. The best sources are illuninated manuscripts and church paintings. These, being two- dimensional and often stylistically inaccurate, are nearly impossible to exactly duplicate. Fredrick goes on to explain that the rulers of each kingdom are chosen by combat. While this is incongruous with theprocess of heredity used inthe 14th and 15th centuries, combat is far more ·'feasible and allows more mernbers of the society to have a chance at succeeding to the throne. Tournaments~ A tournament is held evety five rnonths to determine who will assume 'rule of each of the .. . . ~ . ' . ... ,. . ' kingdoms. The new king and his chosen queen are crowned in a pompous Coronation Festival in a court held by the present majesties. After this, · a \revel\ (dancing, singing, acting, arid feasting) is held. A tournament was held at Girling Center on Sunday, Setpember 21. The knights fought for their honor, their maidens, and, in this case, a helm or helmet which is custom-made for the victor. by a forger. The knights come from all corners of .. the kingdom, clothed in various arrnors ranging from old pieces of automobile tire to hand-made chain-mail. survive quite well with athletic pads and guards. · The fighting itself is astonishing; the warriors attack each other with swords and maces of rattan, a pliable wood .. they defend themselves with .metal or wooden shields; forehead gear , consiSts' ofpadded helmets crafted from discarded freon gas tanks. The scoring of blows is done strictly on an honor system: each fighter knows when the ofher had dealt him a mortal or crippling blow: he responds by feigning loss of, the appropriate limb 1 or collapsing into a heap, mortally wounded on the field Gf battle . \ . ,_ ~ ,-' __ .-_. . . . ,, ·' Whit bJ The so• Hall Ban autumn st happening Sundays ; give the rr class of I meet and and part~ drink.

Sbinagel at Harvard Michael Shinagel, Professor of Englisl\ at, Union College, has been ~;tppo.inted to the newly created post of Director of Continuing Education in the Harvard University Faculty of Arts ;md Sciences and has been named to succeed Reginald H.

In his uew position, Mr. Shinagel will be responsible for three pr.ograms: University Extension, Summer School, and the Office of Special Students. He will report directly to Dean Henry Rosovsky of Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Mr. Shinagel, who served as Associate Director of the Harvard Office of Graduate and Career Plans (1960-1964) and on the Board of Freshman Advisers (1960-1964) while earning his doctorate in English, will take up his new duties immediately. Mr. Shinagel held ad- mjnistrative posts at Harvard, Cornell and, most recently, at Union. He was graduated fro\m Oberlin College as a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and attended Harvard as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow. After receiving his Ph.D., Mr. Shinagel continued his teaching, research, and administrative work at Cornell University where he taught English for three years (1964-7). At Union College, where he served as Chairman of the English Department (1967-73), Mr. Sh,.inagel worked on the Admissions Committee, the Committee for Project HOPE (Higher Opportunity through Education), the Curricular Affairs Committee, and the Budget and Priorities Committee. Mr. Shinagel is an authority on Eighteenth Century English Literature. His books include Daniel Defoe and Middle Class Gentility (Harvard University Press,' 1968), Concordance to the Poems of Jonathan Swift (Cornell University Press, 1972), and the Norton Critical Edition of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, published last month.

Government Reorganized by Matt Brief At the end of last year, student government was reorganized ~o achieve maximum impact within the College. The central organ for student governance is the Student Forum; its officers are President Bian Tucker, Vice-President Matt Brief, and Secretary Paul Boyd. Sixteen others sit on the Forum: two elected representatives from each of the sophomore through senior classes, the five members of the tax-audit committee, the two student trustees, and one representative each from the Presidential Advisory Board, the Planning and Priorities Committee, and the Student Life Committee. The representative~ from these committees have not yet been chosen. In addition, the elected representatives to the forum, including the President and Vice• President, sit on the All- College Senate with faculty and administrators to make decisions that affect the entire College community. 'fhe Forum's functions may be wide and varied. It acts as the student's ombudsmen in affairs ranging. from housing and Saga to curricular improvements and the improvement of the fine arts on this campus. Some of the work will be handled directly in the Forum. Other work is delegated to various committees that are appointed in the spring. However, there are a few openings on some committees for freshmen, transfers, and one or two upperclassmen. These committees are the Bookstore Committee, the Film Committee (three openings), the Housing Committee, · the Library Committee, and the LUI.QI'S aDTA.-r -~IN .nariGII- Ainerican Foo~ \1125MIUII .. sr.

UNDEFEATED TEAM! - This Saturday afternoon at l pm, the Union Ruggers are by Dan McManamon Senior Ca,-Captain Steve Jones set a new· Union College cross country record in a practice dual against Siena last week which the Union Harriers won easily. Jonesey's time of 27.21.4 was only eight seconds off the 5\14 mile course record set in 1973 by Jim Shrader, a SUNY-Albany runner and cross-c~untry All,.American. Jonesey didn't leave the other Uni(:m Harriers far behind, the next follr .finishers. for Unian in order were Pete Pettit, Stan Wiskowski, Roy Wandelmaier, and Kevin Scheuer:. All finished within 20 seconds 9f each other, . Pettit finished a little more tliari a· minute later than Jones. This year's team, \the strongest in at least four years\ according to Coach Ted Sick, is anchored by returning lettermen Jones, Wiskowski .(who was the top runner for Union most of last season), Wanddmaier, Bill Gal~uneau (from Albany Pharmacy), Bc;>b Moffat, and Tom Bourgeois. Other returnees from last year's squad are John Farrell, Bob, Leill, Paul Spence, and John Hallenbeck. Newcomers to the squad include Dan McManamon, Russ Ebbets (a transfer from Villanova) and Tom Lawson who Coach Bick feels \could move up to the top Womens' Field .Hockey mentress, Diana Kerr, confers with squad members Donna Sockell and Perky Francis. :redit: Dan McManamon group.\ Freshmen Harriers are making their presence known as Pettit fin~shed second and Scheuer finished fifth for Union in the dual meet against Siena. Marty Dolan and Scott Webber hav(! also made impressive showing in preseason time trials. Now that the 100 mile per week training of preseason is over and the team is cutting down to seventy-five miles per week of distance training, the entire cross country squad is preparing itself for the very tough schedule ahead. Coach Bick figlltes that R.:f.t, pneqnta, ~nd· Middlebury, will all be far~idable opponents .. Williams and Hamilton will probably be the toU'ghest opponents. In addition, Union's harriers will be campeting in the Capital District Championships on N ri v em be r I s t and t he N.E.S.C.A.C. Tournament. Union has not beaten Hamilton wnds thru the campus. Jonesey's performance of last week against Siena indicates that he's getting into top form and Coach Bick believes that Jonesey will outrun Carter this year. Whoever crosses the finish line first in front of the Alumni Gum will probably shatter the existing course record. Crowd support for the harriers' meet with Hamilton next Wednesday could spur the Union runners on to victory, especially late in the race when all the runners are tiring. Coach Bkk cited the Middlebury meet of last year as an example when Unipn runners c caught and passed ,~he Middlebury runners in the home stretch to win the meet. Come out to cheer the harriers onto victory and see N.Y.S.'s best college cross country runners compete. !!!. SENIORS !!! Please check yout in six years but Coach Hick figures to end that losing steak this year. Hamilton. led by N.Y.S. · cross country champ Bruce Carter, won twenty nine consecutive dual meets until the University of Rochester beat them last year. This year Jonesey is going to challenge Carter all along the grueling course that maplboxes for schedules and , news from the Placement and Career Counseling Office. WRUC \~; WRUC will broadcast a~~~ the Union home footbafl .. games and as many of the • away games as possible. Yearling harriers Kevin Scheur and Pete Pettitare counted on heavily to give Cross Country a successful season.

Last year as a club, they compiled the best record of all fall sports with a 3-3-1 record, and this year they hope to improve it. Miss Diana Kerr, from England, and also one of the best officiators from the Mohawk Valley Area, has been hired to coach the team. This year returning players are Muffy Hart '78, Michelle Delafayette '78, Allyne Price '78, Torti Gahn '76, Louise Dunn '76, and Perky Francis '77. There are also a number of freshmen and upperclassmen coming out for the team. Women's Varsity Sports, in their first yeat at Union need all the help they can get. So please, come out and support the Field Hockey, Tennis; and Volleyball teams! by LYNN BATEMAN Waiting anxiously for final cuts on Oct. 7th and practicing hard for the women's inter- collegiate volleyball team are 29 Union women. Twelve team members will be chosen by Coach Sheila Weaver. Weaver is pleased with this year's turnout, and the potential which is available. This is the first year with women's inter- collegiate volleyball at Union; last year's team was ·club competition. Six women from last year's team are back again trying for this year's lineup. They are Marcia Baity '76, Lynn Bateman '78, Susan Finkelstein '78, Diana Gazzola '78, Amy Juchatz '78, and Cathy Reals '78. This year's team has eight games scheduled, with the first one on Oct. 22.

Coach Cahill had tittle to comment upon the team's perfqJ1l!a.nce. He . ap.plaud~d the play of Unioa's defensive dght tackle Charlie Alter and Tufts'· running back Tim Whalen, who carried the baH 24 times for a total of 77 ya.rds and l T.D., while Alter was a.H over the field recovering a Jumbo fumb:le, partially blocking a p1,1nt,. and was in on numerous tackles.

Adams ended up Uni<:>n's leading gr-ound gainet with 28 yaTds. on 5 carries. The offense was held to a mere seven yards for the entire game. Coach C:ahHI used 3 quarter backs ,indicating that he ill Still in search of a starting signal ~aller. Junior Mark Hroomfi.eld engineered a scoring qrive in ·t·he 2nd quarter, mixing his plays with short runs and quick down ;:lfld outs to his ends Barry Pannel and Mik:e Wroblewski. The Garnettll baffled Jumbo defense, 0nly to be tnwa:tted with an untimely interception near the Tufts' goal line. Broomfield was 6 for 17, for a total 0f 55 yards and l interception. Pannel and Wroblewski each caught the baH ·three times with Wroblewski netting 38 yards and flannel 33 yards. Cahill's reaction to the .defeat was to change se¥etal starting personnel ahd to concentrate on the basics during the ensuing week of pr.actirce. Cahill's comment dming the week. was that tbe \morale wal:l high and · tlley had their best week of practice so far.\ The Dutchmen were preparing for a fast- option team which had speed around tbe . end ~ Tu'f.ts on the 27th.

Fumbles and ·errant passes ended lt is difficult· to say where the Garnet's problems lie, but perhaps the Coach's prql_9nged search for a starting II is the qu¢stion mark. Cahill's use of 3 Q.B:s on Saturday is an example of this indecisiveness. Making a change from lhe W.P.L game., Cahill started Mayell at QB··onry to replace him after 3 series ( Pos.ses~sions). More over. Broomfield was replaced at a key point in the game, when · the G!trnet' s chances seemed to brighten. This may have .stifled the emotio~al surge of the team.

He also noted, however, that there was an improvement in the overall team play from a w~ek ago but that the team still needed to stress \fundamentals blocking and Fortortately, the size of this problem diminishes with ea¢h <lay as the Coach becomes more familiar with his players and their potentials.

Booters Bury Buckeye~ by Ardsley The 1975 edition of the Union varsity soccer team is off to its usual winning ways, posting a 2-1 record early in the seas<>n. The experience-laden squad, boasting 16 returning lettermen from last year's 1'0-2 record-setting squad, has trampled St. Francis and Clark thus far. Opening ., ,ttleir seast>il, the Garnet wet~ 'participants in a prestigious early season tournament at Hartwick College. Union drew a powerful St. Francis squad, rated as one ofthe top I 0 N.Y. teams last year, as their first opponent. Mixing a short pass game with an aggressive defense, .the Garnet prevailed, 3-2. Freshman John Kovacs contributed two goals to the effort, and Co-Captain Craig Jeffries chipped in one. The next day, Union faced.- upstate power SUNY at Buffalo, also rated as one of the last year's top W N.Y. teams. Buffalo's 5-l thrashing sent Union reeling back to Schenectady to open their home schedule against the Buckeyes from Clark. The first half against the lowly Buckeyes recalled memories of the Buffalo rout. Fortunately, in this game, Union was able .J recover its rhythm, scoring S unanswered goals in the .second half. Leading only 2-l in the second half on goals by George Garivaltis and Co-Captain John Denio, Coach McGee exhorted the 'team at half-time. As a result, the team exploded as· Garivaltis, Jeffries (2), Miles Hirson, and Jim Manning tallied, sinking the shell-shocked Buckeyes. The one• sidedncss of the game was evidenced by the fact that Union had 35 shots on goal and held a commanding 14-2 advantage on corner kicks. Today the Dutchmen travel to Rochester to take on a youna but Captain Craig Je.ffries demonstrates new dance step, in hi!i two goal per.formartceSatruday--- lethal Yellowjacket l·l.

Although WW J was the first station to bfoadc!lst, WR UC (or 2ADD, as it was then called), was the first student operated facility. The first college broadcast took place on October 14, 1920.

The station's later history Over the years, many people in the radio bQsirtess (especially KDKA's P.R. men) have tried to refute W RUC's claim of permiership, but the Schenectady Gazette of Oct. 15, 1920 said: \What is thoughUo be the first attempt of a college radio ·club to give a musical concert by wireless telephone was successfully made last night at Union College ... The Club is now planning to give concerts every lhursday night and expects to extend the sending radius to 1,000 miles after improvements are made.\ The controversy between 1 K DK A lf Pittsburgh and WR tiC continued until 1952, when Gleason Archer (a national radio historian) postulated that KDKA was the first to broadcast. Yet. KDK A began broadcasting on November 2, 1920 .. a good two Weeks .after' Union's first broadcast. One of the most interesting ~ccounts of WRUC's early history has been made available by a Union College Trustee, Ralph Bennett.

In the early forties, a grup af students tried to return the station to working order. Their main setback was a lack of funds and initiative within the r.tudent body.

Comprised of faculty, administrators, and students, the committee has been at work for the past six months interviewing and screening prospective candidates. An advertisement for the position was placed in the Chronicle of Higher Education, various Affirmative Action circulars, and was made known to the intellectual community by Stu.dent Tax Special to Concordiensis In an. attempt to rectify past ·inequalities in the processes of allocatjngStudenl tax money, this year's Tax Cemmittee has introduced certain changes designed to elicit student opinion.

Nominations were solicited from faculty and administrators of other institutions. From nearly two hundred and fifty applicants, approximately twenty \semi-finalists\ were selected by the committee on the basis of submitted resumes and personal interviews.

Are you ready? Homecoming Weekend is nearly here. All sorts of people will be returning from the four corners of the earth to visit our campus. The be<:;r will flow. old stories will be embellished upon, and then everyone will fly lazily home thinking fine thoughts about the old alma mater which may even prompt a contribution of some sort. Accordingly. the campus is trimmed. mopped, painted and polished. A good time is arranged for and had bv all who attend. So what if the football team never wins. Who goes· to a football game to watch football anyway? And what better way to get the returning alumni to reminisce about the Old Days at Old Union when the football team steam-rollered every opponent? For those who like to watch victories there is always the soccer team. For those who could not care either way. the changes in the campus are entertainment enough. Achilles Rink will find itself the center of much scrutinv. Despite the usual success of Homecoming weekends, some have found it necessary to increase the psyche at the football game. This is all very well and good until one sees just how the psyche is to be operated on. Plan Number One is the Pep Band, which will presumably march up and down in front of the Union stands and encourage people to really cheer for the Union team whenever they complete a pass or tackle somebody.

First, this is the first year of fall women's varsity tennis. Second they have a tennis coach in the true sense of the word for the first time. Sandy Vohr might be the first tennis coach in as many as fowr years if not longer. The most important first is that this is the first Union Tennis Team that conducts itself in a manner befitting an intercollegiate squad. We've never seen anythiHg Iike it. They have regularly scheduled practices ind11ding jogging as well as tennis, the coach enthusiastically directs her players (a rare practice especially with the men's team). The players might Hot be of world class bHt I have not seen such nice backhands in anyotJ.e of the men's varsity (who aren't world class either). The last first is slightly off the subject, but they were playing Middlebury on the freshly re-laid tennis courts. We thnk it was fiHing. In other words if any of you girls aren't busy this spring, men's varsity needs a coach and some starters.

There is little dc;mbt that this will, in the .long run, attract alumni funds to help pay for a new Fine Arts building and other college necessities. This long-term planning for soliciting funds is unquestionably beneficial for the school, so fong as short term problems are not foresaken in its wake. · · We have problems on this campus which need attention now and might not wait around for alumni contributions several years away. It is my CQntention that if these predicaments are not worked out soon, Union might retain a · prestigious name, but • little else. F,oremost among our concerns here should be the white-black relationship among students, or lack thereof. That Union is an integrated campus is a sham, a travesty.

' '·.; Opinion The Hallowed Halls of North than with those of a roO'm/ suitemate as well. by ADELE REICHLINGER 1 live in the prude dorm. You know,. the fortress. I retriev~ my frisked and cross-exammed visitors, bake my weekly quota of four dozen brownies, debate the difference in calories between a cup of cottage cheese and a ~unch of watercress, and then h1t the sack at I 0, having completed_ yet another strenuous day at Umon. along the line, and those canceming North are plentifuL The conscientious efforts made to protect female students from rape (yes, really) and other assorted pastimes is interpFeted as an affront to one's right to see whoever he wants without a hassle. That's really a bit unreasonable since the \inconvenience\ merely consists of presenting one's lD upon request (just like getting a beer at the skeller- no sweat getting out the old ID for that, if necessary), and waiting from 10 to .45 seconds, depending on whach floor the girl lives. Once inside the barricaded retreat one can't help but notice punctilious. The dorm's abundance of singles has helped foster the belief that most people in North keep to themselves, hence our reputations as elite, virginal snobs. A logical deduction, to be sure, but not particularly valid. You see, singles have some beautiful advantages. One doesn't have incompatible roommates to contend with. Secondly, gossip is less prevalent when each person is more concerned about her own affairs So you see, it really ain't that bad around here after all. In fact, many of us seem to agree that in numerous ways it's quite good. To a:ll fresh(wo}men who for lack of time spent at Union might not know what North's really like, and to aU upperclass(wo)men who for the years spent at Union should by now know what North's really like, I extend a personal invitation to judge for yourselves whether the stereotypes hold any water. Just one thing though, don't forget your ID. Actually, too many myths and stereotypes emanate from a misunderstanding somewhere , . . how well-kept everythmg as - rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, etc. It's been said there's a general tendency to maintain the appearance of that w~ich l~o~ed pretty good to begin With. it s JUSt a Jot of cooperation, not any massive obsession with being Potholes Our Future By R. B. THAU It appears that the goal of President Bonner's administration here is to \put Union on the map.\ The manner in which this will seemingly be accomplished is through an athletic program complete with successful coaches and a new ice rink. There is little doubt that this will, in the long run, attract alumni funds to help pay for a new Fine Arts building and other college necessities. This long-term planning for soliciting funds is unquestionably beneficial for the school, so fong as short term problems are not foresaken in its wake. We have problems on this campus which need attention now and might not wait around for alumni contributions several years away. It is my contention that if these predicaments are not worked out soon, Union might retain a prestigious name, but .. little else. Foremost among our concerns here should be the white-black relationship among 'itudents, or lack thereof. That Union is an integrated campus is a sham, a travesty. Not even liberals would find satisfaction in the racial set- up we have here where blacks and whites rarely mingle and Hickok House seems to be a community within a community. It is unimportant where the. blame lies for this non-integmtion; what is important is that the school, starting from the very top, study the problem and examine possibilities for uniting the races here. As the situation presently stands, it seems we are almost mocking the Brown Board of Education intt:gration case of 1954. A second major concern is the dominance of academics over the broad range of extracurricular affairs. Continual studying and the constant pressure on the majority of students to succeed academically has severely impeded a large number of non- academic organizations, many of which have the potential to contribute as much to one's life here as Greek Art and Civilization or even Calculus. It is possible, beneficial, and should even be desirable to involve oneself in a club or sport that provides the opportunity to work with others and learn at the same time. There is no doubt that academics are important, but it should be remembered that we graduate as people firstly, and scholars secondly. Burying yourself in courses for your tenure at Union may very well produce intelligent persons, but U Coll Dollar Days Good evening ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to \It's Your Dollar,\ where we will present the winners, and some selected one-on-one contentions, from among the results of the poll recently taken of Union students to determine the priorities of student tax expenditures. The winner, with 498 bonus points, was WRUC, beating Concordiensis by a margin of 47 points to take the \Communication\ division championship. In the Entertainment League, Cabaret finished with a total of 493 points, soundly defeating the Coffee- house by 76 points. Also in the Entertainment League, the Film Committee easily overcame the Social Committee by a score of 455 to 393. Moving on to the Literary Division, it was Union Book slipping past Freshman Record 393-3 72, and Idol suffering a decisive loss to Linebacker, 295- 251. There were many tough bouts in the Club Division. Chemistry filtered 1 past Weightlifting 96-89: Golf chipped past Bowling 112- 107; Table tennis spun past Debate 131-126; Rugby outscrummed the BSA 176-115, and Ski T earn slalomed past the Women's Caucus 168-155. Some quick results from the Music and Spiritual Leagues: Men's Glee Club 230, Women's Glee Club 149, and Hillel trouncing the Union Christian Fellowship 174-110. All in all, it was a good contest, with a record number of just greater than fifteen per cent of the campus turning their forms in for counting. There was plenty of ambiguity as to what the basis of judgment in assigning bonus points was to be, insuring a meaningful and exciting outcome. To those teams that finished up top this year, a big handshake. And to those teams who did not do so well, here's hoping that you can get your people out to fill in those forms next year. Remember: it's your dollar have a say in where it goes! BAKE SALE This Saturday, October 11 at the football game, the Staff Association of Union College will hold a Bake Sale. The sale will start at l p.m. at the top of the Gym Stairs. The proceeds of this sale will go for the purchase of books for a needy student. Taste some GOOD FOOD for a change. they will be boring and narrow as welL We have the potential for national attention and prestige on campus right now, as some of the most gifted and talented students in the northeast each year choose to attend Union. But if we are to rise to what President Bonner apparently sees as our calling, certain problems must be worked out. We must open this campus up and preclude groups isolating themselves, while encouraging a broader college experience. Remember, the library is closed occasionally, and free time could be as easily spent at the radio station, m a Mountebanks production, or on a colle!?e committee as it could be spent m front of the television. We have the opportunity to affect change in our own time, and if we fail to do so, we are the only ones who will suffer. Union College alumni will have ample opportunity this Homecoming Weekend (Oct. 10 and 1 I) to view new facilities at the College. Three vpen houses are scheduled, showing off the new Stanley G. Peschel Computer Center, the new Achilles Rink, and the new studios of WRUC, the campus radio station. WRUC will offer alumni the opportunity to be guest D.J.'s on their new FM channel between 7 and 10 p.m. Friday night. Refreshments will be served in the station's new quarters in the Campus Center. · Union College's Stanley G. Peschel Computer Center, completed last spring, will be open for inspection from 9:30 a.m. to noon Saturday. The Center will be dedicated in a ceremony beginning at II :30 a.m._ Finally, Union College alumm may tour the College's new $2 1111! million Achilles Rink from 10:30 a.m. to I p.m. Rink Director and Hockey Coach Ned Harkness and his staff will answer questions about the facility, the most recent addition to the College Grounds. Light refreshments will be served. The open houses are just part of Union's busy Homecoming Weekend. The Union Soccer team goes against Hobart College at I I a.m. At noon, the cross country team takes on Trinity College. And at I :30 p.m. the Dutchman football team goes against the University of Rochester in the 70th game of a series which dates back to the 1890's. After the game, alumni are invited for cocktails at Hale House from 4:30 to 6 p.m. Capping the Homecoming will be a dinner at the Holiday Inn honoring the unbeaten Dutchman football teams of 1914, 1939 and 1949.

They will meet a strong Rochester team in what promises to be an exciting Homecoming hookup. The well rested Union ll hopes to catch the Yellowjackets flat after last week's drubbing by Williams. The 16-7 defeat dropped Rochester's record to 2- l. The Y ellowjackets are led by Little All America receiver Ralph Gebhart and running back Mike Corp (176 yards thus far). Gebhart is one of those rare gridders who goes both ways. (Two interceptions last week.) Quarterback Brian Pasley and running back Bryan Heagney are both questionable starters against the Dutchmen due to injuries sustained last week in the Williams encounter. Union Coach Tom Cahill plans to go with a young aggressive backfieM. Junior Mark Broomfi·dd is slated to quarterback and the running game will consist of Freshmen Jerry Logan and David Ruff, and Sophomore Mike Wroblewski. If the Dutchmen cart cut down on the costly mis<;ues that have hurt them so far, and get better line play both offensively and defensively, this could be a memorable Homecoming ball game. Ruggers Remain Undefeated by AUDREY KUPCHAN The Union \A\ Rugby team cruised to their second victory in as many games last Saturday by defeating Siena 12-6. A strong kicking game combined with hustle and defense gave the Ruggers the winning edge. Rookie Bill \The Toe\ Fellows was unanimously voted most valuable player for Union as he chalked up eight big ones. The senior hit on three out of four kicks (the fourth being nullified after too much time was taken) as he contributed 2/3 of the point total. In so doing, he stole the high scorer's title from the hands of Don Leach. consistently outran their counter- parts who had benefited from at least four more weeks of conditioning drills. Experienced observers of the game concurred in their praise of the serum. Chris Taylor, playing a near perfect game in his key position as serum-half, teamed · with Andy Walsh and Pete Bloomfield as the first to come to the aid of a tackled Union back in many a tight situation; They were joined by Capt. John Andrews, Jim Stants, Mike Thompson and Bill Fellows. More often than not, the rucks and mauls were over before the Siena serum had time to organize. Ed Parisi exasperated Siena backs with innumerable bone-jarring tackles which frequently left the ball in Union hands. skills to keep the ball on the Siena side, thus enabling the rest of the team to concentrate ott scoring. The \B\ team dropped their second game in as many attempts by the score .of 18-6. The Union team made h. number of mistakes attributable primarily to their inexperience. The lone Union try was scored on a burst through the heart of the Siena line by Mark Van Dorn. Burt Slavin provided the extra points. Other impressive performances were turne:d in by Bill Glavin, Da:ve Papa and Steve Robey. As the rookie Ruggers gain more experience, Captain Andrews has great hopes for the remainder of the season. This Saturday the Union Ruggers place their unblemished record on the line in a home contest against Albany Medical College. The g;:tme, on Library Field at I p.m., should be a fierce battle between these two Union University rivals. This will be the last home game of the season for Soccer Splits The Union College Varsity soccer team split its two games last week, dr-opping Rochest(!r 3-0 on Wednesday and Iosin;g to the 'Ephmen from Williams 3-1 J9n Saturday. A strong second half perforl{nance was evident in both games, hut unfortunately for the Garnet, WiUiains proved to be. too difficult to overcome. On Wednesday's contest, the Rochester squad proved too young and inexperienced to keep the Dutchmen .at bay . .In a game marked by periodic thunder- showers, the Dutchmen could not get untracked, and although they dominated the first half, they could not score. However, the tables turned in the second half, as Union's vat:Jnted offense exploded for three inexperienced and basic fundamental mistakes caught up- with the Yellowjackets. George (iaravaltis continued his assault on the Union season assist .record as he fed Craig Jeffries an<l John Denio for two and one goals respectively. The defense played solidly throughout the entire game as fullback Jim Bacharach thwarted numerous Rochester offensive thrusts and goalie Chris Huban turned aside 13 shots on goal. An otherwise. perfect Saturday was spoiled by a hustling and - rugged Willi11ms soccer team, The Ephmen drew· blooc:l in the first two minutes of the game when they were awarded a penalty kick. Down l,..O, the Dutchmen rallied furiously and controll~d the ball for thl! most part. But late in the first .half, a Willi~ms forwar-d capitalized on a tniscue by the Garnet fullbacks· and· put WiJ.liams ahead to stay~ The ;f.phmen speedst~r got behind the ,fullbacks, went in one-on-one on goalie Chris Huban, d eked him out of po'sitlC;>ll, and put the ball in the nets. I-n fact, the Union defense was plagued throughout the game by the long chips of the Williams' halfbacks that constantly caught them too far up on .defense. ·· The GarMt played . an int~:resting game the second. half. With 16 minutes left in the game, Jeffries blasted a bb;tzing · shot from outside the penalty areij which the Ephnian netminder couldn't handle. Down by only one goal a,iter Jeffries' score, the crowd roared its approval and Union kept intense pressure on the Williams' defense. Finally, -with 6:2.3 left, Rich Earl forced a c.rucial error and the Dutchmen were awarded a , penalty · kick. Cr&ig Jeffries took the kick, but was unable to knot the score as he kicked tbe ball wide of its mark. Williams then completed the scoring by an anticlimactic third gaaL Tbis week is another. busy one for the team, featuring Hamilton on Wednesday at 3:00 and Hobart for Homecoming at 11:00, both heme. With an unspectacular 3-2 record, this could be ~\'-telling week for the future of the soccer team this Gridders prep for Home~;oming tilt. Leach, however, set up the first score with a clutch pass to Steve Klak in the first half. After taking a pass from Tom Ryan, Leach ran the ball to within five yards of the goal line before he turned to give the ball to Klak. The opposition, drawn towards Leach, was unable to recover in time to stop the awesome Klak who had moved to an outside position. Klak glided in for the easy score. The Union backs played lacklu.ster offense compared to their strong start in last week's game. Fortunately, their outstanding defensive play helped make up for the sluggish .offense. Brian Tucker and Fred Simon devastated the opposition with quick, sure tackles and Tom Ryan was always there to pick up the loose ball that resulted.

Vol. 4, No. l Wednesday, Oct. 8, 1975 Editor's Prerogative New Face on Campus. Boy. how time does fly? It seems as if it was only yesterday that I was making my debut at Union College, as a lonely little freshman. And now I'm a dynamite junior. Since this is approximately the third week of the term, I would like to dedicate this editor's prerogative to this year's Black freshman class. So I want all of you to take heed to the message I'm about to relay. Coming to Union for any student, but particularly a Black student is definitely a culture shock. Speaking from my past educational experiences, my contact with white people was very limited. In fact out of 1375 students at my high school, there was only one white student. My social and cultural environment was devoid of contact with white people. In my eyes. association with the white race was totally unnecessary. This seems a bit ironic since I lived in a suburban area which went by the name of Whitehaven. Then I came to Union College. It seemed as if everywhere I turned. there were white people. Being an Aquarian, this definite numerical advantage by whites did not rattle me whatsoever. However this situation will definitely cause you, the freshman to make some important decisions about what type of social and cultural life you'll lead at Union College. Assimilation is one avenue the Black freshamn could pursue. In essence, you could become a Black sponge. Absorbing and incorporating the so-called white life-style is very easy to do. I mean, why go aginst the grain. The only way to tell the assimilators from real white people, is by the color of their skin. And who knows, they probably spend all their spare time soaking in Clorox. Peer pressure from fellow Blacks has no effect on the assimilator, but I'll bet his conscience beats the hell out of him every night. Accommodation is still another road the Black freshman could take. What is an accommodationist? Well, he's a person that'll easily adapt to his present situation. He's flexible, but with a definite lean away from anything that could rock his private little applecart. He concedes to his situation, and will this individual try to make a dent in the ever present racial disharmony at Union, of course not. The only time you see a Black accommodationist is when the B.S.A. gives some type of social function; specifically P-a-r-t-y. Now we've come to the third fork in the road, which is that of the Black Constructionist. A Black Constructionist is an individual who is at all times aware of his status at Union College. He's painfully aware that most white people at Union definitely speak with forked tongues. But unlike the accommodationist, he definitely tries to change things. The constructionist does not perceive the Black Students' Alliance as merely a social organ for Blacks, but as a moving driving force than can create a definite change. He isn't necessarily vocal about what his goals or aims are but someway or somehow, they are achieved. To make it short he cares and does. As much as I hate to admit, the Black constructionists aren't the majority at Union. The percentages of the assimilators and accommodationists are exceedingly high.

The focal pobt was considered to be Boston because the entire city seemed to be against court-order busing. It seems that every term Union College has something, or someone new to offer to the campus and this year is no exception. But this is no ordinary individual. This person is an Aquarian. We all know that Aquarians possess qualities that no other person can ascertain, especially this individual. He appears to be very progressive, and very talented. He is also very peace-loving and unselfish. And he shows a definite concern for helping others. Enough of the mystery. Who is this person? Why, he is Jerry Lee, the new assistant director of the Academic Opportunity Programs. Jerry was born and raised in the tri-city area, Albany to be exact. He attended Albany State where he obtained his undergraduate degree in three years. He only has a year to go before he receives his law degree from the University of Iowa. While attending Albany State he became one founder of the Educational Opportunity Programs Student Association, while president of the Black Student Union there. Under his direction, the B.S.U. at SUNYA developed from a mere \partying\ organization to one that . made and is making a definite contribution to the tri-city area. Perspective reporters asked Mr. Lee if the overall problems of students at Union are comparable to those at SUNY A. He replied that most colleges have the same basic problems; money and housing shortages. It was natural for Perspective reporters to assume that Jerry had had some type of dealings with Union's Black populace, prior to becoming an administrator here. He answered that when he was a student at SUNY A, he felt that the Black Student Alliance at Union lacked a certain amount of sophistication. In direct dealings with former Alliance members, Jerry was left with the impression that Union , Blacks had been engulfed by their white counterparts. This engulfment created pangs of apathy among Blacks. But what about Union's Black Student Alliance now? Not willing to commit himself so early in the game, Jerry says that he definitely sees a great deal of potential in the present Salek Student Alliance. One facet of the B.S.A., and around campus, Jerry would like to see eliminated, is character assasination. He feels that individuals here waste too much time backstabbing, and not enough time trying to solve problems concerning this institution. Mr. Lee feels that this problem could be alleviated if people realize that people are people; and that no one is perfect. He went on to say that individuals should give more heart service instead of lip service. It is known across this campus that for a time last year, there were strained relationships between some Black students and the A.O.P. administration of last year. At this stage of the game, Jerry doesn't foresee any apparent conflicts. He believes that he can successfully divorce himself from personality conflicts and \miscellaneous paraphenalia.\ To quote the new assistant director, \I will not give stupidity validity by responding to it.\ When asked of his expectations of white faculty and administrators in regard towards alleviating racial difficulties on campus, Jerry responded by saying that with the exception of one or two, the others are objects of apathy. He also feels that the majority of white officials on campus won't do a thing unless it is \politically expedient.\ It appears that the new assistant director is fully-prepared for his difficult task. The staff of Perspective would like to wish Jerry a Jot of luck on an experience that will definitely prove to be unforgettable. On October lith and 12th the National Student Coalition Against Racism (NSCAR) is sponsoring its second student conference against racism.

Contrary to popular belief · :-.JSC AR is not an \all-Black\ organization, but a multiracial student and youth organ:zation that hopes to stamp out the seeds of racism across this nation. This forceful organization was founded in Boston on February. 58 high schools and other college- oriented groups pooled their forces to initiate a massive \ demonstration for busing and other forms of desegregation. A Rewarding Experience On the designated dates of the II th and 12th of this month, NSC AR will sponsor several workshops focusing on the Boston desegregation fight and other racial struggles throughout this country. All concerned individuals should definitely attend this momentous demonstration. For one member of the Black Student Alliance, the second week of June did not bring about a much-needed rest from the doldrums of college life. Robert Wilson who is currently a junior at Union attended a summer program especially for minorities involved in the science of biology. It was a program sponsored by the McHarry Medical College in :-.Jashville, Tennessee.

Vol. 4; No.1 . . ~ <'. Wednesday, Qct. 8, 1975 Editor's Preroga·tive New F~ce on Campus .. Boy, how time does fly? It seems as if it was only yesterday that I was making. :my debut at Union College, as a lonely little freshman. And now I'm a dynamite junior. Since this is approximately the third week of the term, I would like to dedicate this editor~s prerogative to this year's Black freshman class. So I want all of you to take heed to the message I'm about to relay. Coming to Uniun for any student,. but particularly a Black student is definitely a culture shock. Speaking from my past educational experiences, my contact with white people was very limited. In fact out of 1375 students at my high school, there was only one white. student. My social and cultural environment was devoid of contact with white people. In my eyes, association with the white race was totally unnecessary. -y;his seems a bit ironic since I lived in a suburban area which went by the name of Whitehaven. Then I came to Union College. It seemed as if everywhere I turned,. there were white people. · Being an Aquarian, this definite numerical advantage by whites did not rattle me whatsoever. However this situation will definitely ·cause you; the freshman to make .some important decisions about what type of social and cultural life you'll lead at Union College .. Assimilation is one avenue the Black freshamn could pursue. In essence, you could become a Black sponge. Absorbing and incorporating the so-called white life-style is very easy to do. I mean, why go aginst the grain. The only way to tell the assimilators from real white people, is by the color of their skin. And who knows, they probably spend all their spare time soaking in Clorox. Peer pressure from fellow Blacks has no effect on the assimilator, but I'll bet his conscience beats the hell out o( him every night. Accommodation' is still another road the\ Black fresl1man could take. What is an accommodationist? Well, he's a .person that'll easily adapt to his present situation. He's flexible, but. with a definite lean away from anything that could rock his private little applecart. He concedes to his situation, and will this individual try to make a dent in the ever present racial disharmony at Union, of course not. The only time you see a Black accommodationist is when the B.S.A. gives some type of social function; specifically P .. a-r-t-y. Now we've come to the third fork in the road, which is that of the Black Constructionist. A Black Constructionist is an individual who ·is at all times aware of his status at Union College. He's painfully aware that most white people at Union definitely speak with forked tongues. But unlike the accommodationist, he definitely tries. to change things.

What can I do so he'll take an interest in me? I'm starving for his love. Signed, Academically Interested •• ~· Dear Academics, Why don't you try turning yourself into a book, so he can read your lines and turn your pages? . If that doesn't seem possible, how about finding his secret corner in the library and suggesting he take a study break with you? If you start showing up at the right time in the right place, then he can't help but notice you. Then again, maybe he already has noticed you, and ... (Dig what 1 mean, sugar?) Dear Sisterly Love, .Since I've been through my first couple of weeks as a student here at Union, how comes it that everyone seems to be in a rush, especially the men? The main thing seems to be who gets what, when and how. Hey, I desire companionship, but the way things are going all I get is a stream of brothers making their rounds. I've been stopped by tall ones, short, cute ones, ugly ones, even a cigarette salesman (and I don't even smoke!). How can I separate the for-real men from the Superfly-types. or should I be bothered? Dear 6, Signed, Stop No.6 Relax, enjoy yourself and play it to the max. In a couple of weeks, the knights in shining armor will still be shining while the tin men will he creaking from rust.

Dear Cold, Signed, Cold Shower Perhaps you are too well- endowed physically, and you are scaring off perspective partners. Maybe it's not only physical strength but also of breath or body odor! Try looking for a HEALTHY woman, and your problems should be solved. Dear Sisterly Love, Please tell me if this is for real. I'm a freshman brother who's been stumped by a peculiar situation. Since I've arrived at U. Coli. a certain upperclass female has been seeming to pay an unusual amount of attention to me. However when I try to establish the nature of this attention, all I get is a smile, a wink and a song.

Another misconception about slavery is the idea that it developed into a .stable system which was .generally paternalistic and without undue strains and contradictions. One often finds the following type of statement in American history texts: \Although there were a few cruel masters, the system itself was not unduly harsh. The slave was, after all, a valuable piece of merchandise, and most owners were careful not to harm their hum<1n property.\ Most modern authorities have, however, reached the opposite conclusion: that slavery was maintained only by elaborate and pervasive controls arid extensive lise of force, and that the slave system never achieved .any degree of normalcy in social relationships or any real civil.peac~. It was the system' ·itself which was oppressive, and not th.e exceptional Simon Legree sla vemaster. Every southern state passed a long list of laws to control slaves by regulating all aspects of the bondsman's daily existence. A historian has summarized some of the legal restrictions: \Slaves were forbidden to assemble without the permtsston and presence of responsible whites, were not to own or carry arms of any kind, Were not to trade, buy, ·sell, or engage in any other economic activity without the permission of their toasters, were not to be off tbe plantation grounds at any time or the city streets after nine or ten in the evening without written permission,' were not to practice or administer medicine, were not to lift their hands against any white person, were not to be taught how to read and write, and were not permitted to testify in· court in any case involving a white person.\ ~ere were other techniques that never made it into the statute books. One, known to masters ,verywhere, was to \divide and rule,\ usually by awarding special favors or a privileged position to house slaves and body servants. Thus the salves were turned against each other and the loyal favorite could be persuaded to reveal the plans and activities of their fellow servants. A crucial method of control, one that forms an overriding theme of the whole slavery epoch, was the Page_~ psychologic~! campaign to make the slaves themselves accept slavery as their normal and inevitable status in life. The intellectual leaders of the South were put to work devising religious, racial and cultural arguments that would instill in tne Negro slave a sense of his own inferiority and impotence. When these laws and practices failed to keep the slaves in line, the master could and did fall back on the use of force. The individual owner had a virtualiy unlimited right to use violence against his own slaves, even to the point of taking their lives. He was backed up by local slave patrols and state militias, which tracked down runaways and moved quickly to quell slave resistance. Finally, there was the armed strength of the federal government: much Qf the Vriifea> States army was perman'bntl{ stationed in the South to assist in putting down slave unrest. The most persistent myth about slavery is that it was accepted by the slaves themselves - either because the conditions were tolerable or because they were too stupid or too passive to do anything about it. Contrary to this view, history reveals the saga of slave resistance. There is ample evidence that Black men have been no more adjusted to bondage than white men, and that they bave · fought''fdi-'',freedom since the first slaJetra(J\ef'arrived in Africa. One little-known aspect of the slave's struggle was his unspectacular, often covert, day- to-day resistance to slavery. This was not open rebellion but rather a silent but persistent campaign to make life as difficult and as unprofitable as possible for the slaveholder. Slaves slowed up at work and stopped their labor altogether when the eye of the overseer was not on. them. · Revenge was sometimes so.ught through the willful - · though surreptitious destruction of property, ranging from the misuse of tools and work animals to arson.

Medical science has discovered a new method that could possibly cut the time it takes to test blood poisoning in humans. The reduced time would be from many days to one minute. This breakthrough, is of special concern to Blacks and Puerto Ricans because most victims of lead poisoning are small children in the inner cities who eat or breathe in lead chips or dust from paint peelings from slum walls. In 1973 alone, over 30,000 cases of lead poisoning was reported in the U.S. Many cases of this dread poisoning go undetected because the majority of states don't require reporting of such cases. One fact that should definitely concern all Americans, is the American Association for the Advanc.ement of Science estimate that 25% of American children, 5% of men, and 2% 6f women, have enough lead in their bodies . to create a danger of lead poisoning. A small percentage of the lead comes from car exhausts, but the greatest danger is from lead paint. The problem is considered serious only for children under six, who are likely to ignore warnings against paint. After the child passes his sixth year; his nervous system has matured enough to witnsmnd ··most of the damage. Lead poisoning in young children can cause brain damage as well as death. This new detecting technique is designed for use in schools or in mobile units that would possibly toilr city neighborhoods. The procedure is as follows: a pin prick of blood is placed on a glass slide that is inserted into a special flourimeter and irradiated by a beam of blue light. If the person has absorbed a sizeable amount of lead, the blood gives -off red light. The intensity of the red flourescence, recorded on a meter indicates the level of lead in the blood. A positive reading means a second blood sample must be drawn for laboratory analysis to check whether the problem is lead poisoning or anemia. (High levels of substance in hemoglobin could indicate anemia, as well as lead poisoning.) However with this new technique, this second reading can be done immediately while the patient is at the screening point. Under the present system, a delay occurs while the test is analyzed. It can take a few days <>r as long as three weeks to send a test tube full of b-lood to a lab, and get a report back. foiltinued on Paae D ·

Zimmerman, pp. 5-l to 5-5.) 5. Emergence of the Cotton Kingdom During the first years of the United States republic, the southern states lagged behind in economic development. The slave states were a kind of backwater, showing economic decline and cultural stagnation. Serious southerners were concerned, and some began to realize that the inefficient slave system was at least partially responsible for their backwardness and lack of progress. Then, just when slavery seemed to be growing obsolete, the institution got a new lease on life. It is ironic that a technological innovation, the invention of the cotton gin, was responsible for salvaging an outmoded social and economic system and making possible its fullest development. , rhe gin invented by Eli Whitney could do the work of fifty slaves in cleaning and preparing the cotton fiber for processing. Almost immediately, the price of cotton fell, and 'what had been a luxury fabric , became the common cloth of all the world. The sharply increased demand for cotton cloth inspired planters to seek more land and more workers. A few statistics illustrate the enormous changes which occured as Cotton became King in the American South. At the turn of the century, the United States had only about a million slaves; by the time of the Civil War there were four million. As the demand for slaves grew, their price rose sharply, from about 200 dollars to ten times that amount. Cotton production skyrocketed after the invention of the gin, going from a few million bales to about two billion bales a year. Geographical expension was equally striking: the heart of the cotton kingdom moved steadily west from the Carolinas into Alabama and the delta region of Louisiana. Nor did cotton stop at the Mississippi River; soon the profitable crop was being grown in Kansas, Texas and Arkansas. In 1807, as cotton expansion was getting under way, Congress passed a law prohibiting the African slave trade. This should not be considered primarily a move against slavery itself; in a way it was actually aimed at preserving the institution of ;.lavery. Many slaveholders supported the legislation because they feared the impact of raw and rebellious African slave imports or of revolutionary Negroes from PERSPECTIVE, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 1975 Page .c the West Indies. Even a partial number of the supply of new imports caused problems for the slaveholders. As planters moved into new lands, they displayed an almost insatiable demand for slave labor. This situation gave rise to the domesti-c slave trade, a particularly infamous chapter in the history of slavery in the United States. Farmers in the border states and Virginia, finding that they could no longer compete with the frontier plantations in the business of raising cotton, went into the business of raising slaves. There was systematic breeding of slaves to increase the number of hands available for sale to the commercialized plantations of the Deep South. A Virginian at the time admitted that his home was a \Negro-raising State\ and claimed that it was able to export 6,000 slaves a year because of breeding. In the last decades of slavery, the border states shipped South about 25,000 slaves a year. It hardly needed to be pointed out that the business of slave raising had detrimental effects on slave family life and stability. The half century that preceded the Civil War saw the fullest development of the slave system and the emergence of the unique plantation society. The cotton plantation of the Far South was a highly organized production unit (although its viability in purely economic terms is still much disputed). The life of a Negro slave on such a plantation was not an enviable one. As a field laborer, he often worked \from can't see in the morning 'till can't see at night,\ to pick his 150 or 200 pounds of cotton. Not all slaves worked in the cotton fields, of course. Domestic slaves usually enjoyed better conditions and a higher status, although they lived with constant threat of being demoted to a \field nigger\ if they fell out of favor with their master or mistress. Some slaves became expert carpenters or acquired other skills; their masters often realized a regular income by hiring these talented slaves out to neighbors. At various times, slaves filled virtually every position in the complex life of the plantation - except that of master. They were tailors, preachers, smiths, concubines, 1 gardeners, horse trainers, wetnurses, and barbers. They were also overseers, bodyguards, and paid informers. With their forced labor and various skills, the Black slaves transformed the Mississippi delta from a wild frontier into plantation country. But to them the Deep South remained a hell. Slaves of the border states begged, schemed, fought, and fled to avoid being sent South. The common picture of the ante-bellum South is a confused assortment of images from popular films and novels, abolitionist tracts, and the writing of Southern apologists. There are several myths that run rampant through this composite image, and they must be dispelled if we are to arrive at any real understanding of this historic period. Perhaps the three most persistent myths are those which concern the role of the planter class, the stability of \paternalistic\ slavery, and the docility of the slave himself. The wealthy and proud planters so popular in historical fiction were certainly not typical of white southerners. In fact, the typical white man in the South was not even a slaveowner. Less than one percent of southerners owned slaves. Only about 40,000 men were masters of twenty or more slaves. The owners of the large gangs of plantation slaves formed a very tiny and select group indeed. The true planter aristocrats numbered perhaps 3,000, at a time when the South had a population of eight million white men and four million Negroes. In spite of the small numbers, members of the slaveholding aristocracy found themselves able to dominate the social, economic and political life of the South. The large plantations were much more productive than small farms, and thus concenttated on cash crops for export. The planters therefore collected most of the profits of the great cotton boom. They came in this way to control businesses, banks, and other financial institutions. Political power in the southern states became firmly fixed in the hands of the major planters and of businessmen and professionals who were linked to them in intimate family ties. Moreover, with their distinctive and luxurious way of life, the plantation owners established the cultural values for the South as a whole. In order to maintain slavery, re.uphemistically called the South's \peculiar institution,\ the planters needed the support of the great majority of whites who owned no slaves and had no direct economic stake in slavery. Non-slaveholders were encouraged to believe that they too would someday own slaves. In the case of some \poor whites,\ this dream was too unrealistic to be effective; these poor farmers were persuaded that the institution of slavery was the only thing that could keep them from ? .. ~ing the despised bottom layer • Ol SOCiety.

For some slaves, however, this undramatic daily battle against the masters' interests was not enough. They sought not just retaliatidn, but freedom and the opportunity to live a normal human existence. During the years before the Civil War there were at least 250 slave rebellions and conspiracies.

A house slave betrayed the plan to his master, and Vesey and his lieutenants were exec.uted. , The most famous slave rebel of all wa,s Nat Turner., In a sudden sweep through the Virginia countryside, he and his followers killed sixty whites in a single day of 1831. They were turned back outside the town of Jerusalem, although Nat himself was not captured and hanged until almost two months later. The Turner rebellion brought panic to the white south and repression to the slaves. There was a rash of lynchings. Legislatures met in emergency sessions and ,passed SJpve Codes of unprecedented severity: The nervous South was almost transformed into an armed camp, and slaves found it increasingly difficult to plan an insurrection. Nevertheless, they continued to rebel. There ate certain patterns which emerge ftom an inspection of these three revolts and the hundreds of less famous ones. Most were ·betrayed by Negro informers., usually house slaves or free servants. A surpnsmg number of white men were willing to take up arms against Black slavery. For example, two French men were involved in Gabriel's plot, iind four men were convicted of helping Vesey. Another slave rebellion in 1816 was led by a. white man named George Boxley. The slave revolts, when not betrayed in ~he planning stage,' were almost always smashed by force. Such defeats were. followed by a wave of repression, usually when the uprising had been of major proportions. As the nineteenth century wore on, a campaign against slavery gathered steam in the North. The abolitionist movement forms an important chapter in American history. In the next issue we will examine some accomplishments. It should be cleat, however, that the fight for freedom was not starte~ !>Y. Quakers or Northern abolitionists. That battle was begun by the slaves themselves, and for several hundred years they fought it alone. Sadama N. Homs The deadline for articles for .the next edition of PERSPECTIVE is Octobf!r 19th.

Threeater: Peter Crockett, Masha Stackman, and Gordon Talley Literacy Survey , by PHIL ALCABES Many educators in recent years have commented on the decline in students' verbal abilities, indicated notably by the trend of decreasing SAT scores. Robert Batchelder (class of '78) has decided to document faculty members views on their students' writing skills by means of a survey, designed to \sense trends in faculty feelings.\ The results, hopes Batchelder, will \aid in curriculum programming,\ as curricula may be amended to compensate for or to remedy whatever skills are found lacking. This would apply not only to English, but to all fields which require written work. Batchelder views the \professional responsibility\ of professors to \maintain an acceptable standard for written work.\ There is, he feels, too much emphasis on content - on data in lab reports, on answering questions correctly - and too little on expression of the content in words. The survey takes the form of a questionnaire compiled by Batchelder with Prof. Fred Hartwig (Political Science). Questions were contributed and commented upon by members of the Departments of English, Political Science, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering. 1\ list of 18 schools considered competitive in admissions with Union was supplied by Director of Admissions J. Shupe. Of these, three consented to take part in the survey: Williams, St. Lawrence, and Union. Skidmore may also participate. At each college the Dean of Faculty will distribute the questionnaire to department chairmen, who will see that each teaching faculty member receives one. All respondents are guaranteed anonymity. The completed forms will be returned to Batchelder, who will tabulate all responses with the help of the computer. The results will then be made public. Funding for this study comes from the Office of Institutional Studies through the Provosts' Office, in conjunction with Mr. Enteman's stated aim (Campus Chronicle, October 3, 1975) of exammmg Union's educational policy during 1975-76; this is to include a look at students' ability to \write and speak clearly and effectively.\ A sample of the survey questions follows.

's Ho·thox: Innovations in government Although, in most .respects, Union .is not a:n accurate reflection of Iife outside our gates, · there is Qne area where the colil::ge shares an unfortunate condition with the outside world. This condition is that. the ruling body has become an elite, not out .of delusions of grandeur or hunger for power, but due rather to a lack of concern .and interest by the people. Just as there is a power elite in Washington (and in every state capital), there is an elite at this school that eofitrols those f~cets .of college life in which students should be allowed to make their own decisions. This system .of decision-making is the lazy man;s democracy, re!llilting more from apathy than from consensus. There are, hQwever, alternatives to the way things are now run, alternatives which could provide the student body With a more appealing . way of involving themselves in the school's decision-making process. Apathy . is not inherent in a student. body, but the way decisions are made here tends to discourage anything in the way of political. action. I have been given the\o tQ suggest altema:tiwe decision- making procedures, and it is my hope th;1t at least one of these forms will attract student support. Alternative #1: Mafia-style government. Through this system the Union ~a:l)lPUS will be divided· into four quarters or· territories,'' each controlle<J by a family along the lines of The Godfather. The family is not elected, but takes over power vi~ violence and the murdering ·Of its enemies. They are then re!lponsible for garbage pickqp, the supply of olive oil, running JlOmbers, narcotics, and other college problems. In addition, the brook in Jackson's Gardens will be reserved for the sole purpose of dumping student~ who try to muscle in on the family. Should any member of a different family try to take control of a territory other than his own, the family that has been infringed upon is allowed to fill him with lead at any tolJ booth within a fifty mile radius. .The advantage of this system is that students will know who to go to in order to have something done about a problem. All the student has to do is ask to speak to the head of his territ01:ial family, whose first name must be Don, or \.the\ Don, and bow down and kiss the Don's hand. The Don must then take care of the complaint, or encase the complainer in concrete and see if he can swim the length ·of ,the Alumni Gym pool. This system of deoision-ntaking is a9vantageous because it centralizes power and eliminates the awesome burden .of voting. once a year. · · Alternative #l: This system· of decision-niaking would eliminate all electe(l student government r~presenta~ives and replace the.m Strength from. an Achilles Heel by DA VII) .SCHMERTZ The l 973 Camegle Commission On Higher Education <1'nce descri.bed .. coHege\ as the \Un<Jergraduate Pipeline.\ That metaphor suggests a giant condnit opening .at the exit of·hi~hs·ch~ol on graduation'day; ·Where many· of you experienced that first thrust out into life.

My husband and I sprouted wings that day, the quicker to cover the distance of 150 .miles. When we arrived in the evening, Salzhenitsyn was holding an i!lformal discussion with the students. He had asked to meet with them without the f~culty (although many of the teachers were present) so that he could get the f~el of the students; thinking on the important issues facing America and the world today. This was not a discussion centered on literature. Detente, the . tatget of his two major addrt;sses,. wl!s also the subject of this '•beseda'- Russian word for a give-and-take session. He told the students that he Was interested in finding out whether or not American youth of today - and here was a select group of young .people with a special interest in things Russian - had any feeling of alarm, any inkling of the danger that, he feels, is presently facing the free world and America in particular. Had they, in other words, learned anything from history, from what he had tried to put across in his books? Solzhenitsyn·, gives the impression of being a very strong man physically. His hands are immense and his handshake hearty. Yet, what impressed me the most· in his appearance was the deep furrow which literally cuts his brow in two, the most striking marking 1 have ever seen etched .on , the forehe~d of any man. It seems bottomless~ and in with a feudal system with a reigning king. All those who are presently on the Student Forum or the College Senate will become Barons and Dukes, responsible for specific land tracts after the campus is divided up. Attmoat will be built around the Nott Memorial, where the king will live to prevent peasant uprisings. Library Field, the soccer field, and the football field will be split up into individual tracts of land where students can grow crops to .suppcm themselves, although a tithe of the crops must be sent to . either the Union Christian Fellowship or Hillel in an effort ·· .to encourage religion. The Barons and Pukes, in their new roles as noblemen, would be responsible for solving the problems of the student serf .population. Fraternity parties would be replaced by witch burnings and jousting as a means of keeping the.· .peasants happy. rhe infirm;lry . would be responsible for starting occasional plagues and epidemics to keep the population down. ·Alternative #3.: This system would ·eliminate student Opinion government and political elites altogether, replacing them with anarchy. All students would be equipped with a scythe, a pitchfork, and a torch, and would be responsible for burning down a certain building on campus. Those presently in power would be given a one-minute head start to escape, but if caught, the students would be allowed to hang these members upside down on meat hooks. Mansions will be rented; placed on campus, and set on fire to add authenticity to the revolution. The advantage of this system is the elimination of a need for decision ... making and that it renders those knowledgeable in the manufacture of Molotov cocktails the most important individuals on the campus. It is my opinion that the reason students refrain from involving t he m s e l v e s in s t ud en t government is because . our . present system of government is too complex and uninteresting. If it were repla.ced with an alternative system of decision• making, there would be greater student involvement and mote semblance of~emocracy. Union College is again for the better.

As Solzhenitsyn' made room for me next to himself on the long bench on which he was sitting, surrounded by students eager for autographs, 1 became aware of · how effortlessly he manipulated three tasks at once. Our short conversation, during which I had an opportunity to tell him of our own students at Union who had found his books fascinat·ing and thought-provoking, was easy and friendly even though I was a complete stranger to him. At the same time he was signing at least a dozen books thrUst before hitn, each titne ,asking the autograph- seeker what name to inscribe in the book, never having to he told twice. Simultaneously, in answer to a student who. inadvertently or because of his poor Russian hac: just said something in .obviou1 contradiction to Solzhenitsyn~, strongly held views, he addressec::i a good-natured remark or two. Solzhenitsyn's mind is quick, sharp, incisive, intense and, even in the informal situation in which we found ourselves, powerful ~eyoi_ld the scope of a merely . mtelhgent person.

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's visit to Vermont will not be soon forgotten by this writer, nor by· anyone else who met him there. After his departure, a Montpelier newspaper reported that the writer was considering buying a house in Vermont. Wish it would be so! ______ .,.._ Ms. Jernako(( is an Instructor in Russian at Uninn.

A College~wide search, A Seal is Chosen It ·is noted in the May 26th 1795 minutes of a meeting of ,the college Board of Trustees that four of the original twenty-four members of that board were elected a committ~:;e to select a seal for the College. Those men were Goldsbrow Banyar, A London-hom citizen and Loyalist during the Revolution; Abraham Ten Broeck, one of the men who petitioned Governor Clinton to establish a college in Schenectady to be called Clinton College; Henry Walton, member of one of the rich.est families of the 18th century;·: and Steph~:n: Van Rensselaer, a mem.ber of the social .elite i~ ,New York at the time. ln late November of 1796 the committee reported hack to the other trustees that they had l?rocured a seal and however, failed to turn up ::~_ny sign of the seal and to this day it is still missing. The only true relic of the seal's impression may be found in the November 30, 1796 minutes of the Board of Trustees meeting. The design of the seal is embossed on a page of the minutes in a blob of red sealing wax. Seal Still Intact · The design of the Union College Seal and its motto have nonetheless endured.

The Union seal also appears in stained glass along with 17 other Presbyterian-formed universities at the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City. Among the other schools appearing there. are Hamilton, Yale, Harvard, Brown, and Bowdoin. The Elusi:ve Mofto While the history of the seal itself is quite well-documented in the minutes of trustee meetings, the circumstances which surround the choosing of the motto and the head' of Minerva for placement on the seal are hazy and surrounded by conjecture. The source of bewilderment Js the fact th!lt nowhere in any College records can orie find -a source or an author for the motto inscribed. on . the ''Great Seal of Union.\ These unresolved qqestions have been th~ source of grea.t ,perplexity for many years.. Samuel B. Fortenbaugh, Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the College, has attempted to trace the origin. of the· motto to the- influence of the revolutionary time, which caused Union to choose a French motto over the traditional Latjn, Greek, and Hebrew mottos of most other institutions. It is believed that choosing a French motto demonstrated the sympathies toward Republican France. Although precise tracing of this is impassible it. has been. hypothesized that the motto was taken from Masonic literature, specifically Masonic poetry. The name \Union\ and the basic concept expressed in the motto recur in Masonry of the 18th century. · • Fortenbaugh's Search Mr. Fortenbaugh, in his desire to elucidate the true origin of the College motto, has been in contact with various individuals throughout the world including members of The Albany Institute o£ History, The Windsor Herald of Arms in London, and The French Society of Heraldry. Though many promising leads turned up, they.. were eventually proved to be of little. consequence in resolving the mystery to the satisfaction of those involved in the search.

They hope that this policy will allow them enough room to select jobs for students that can in some way compliment their studies, thus again placing increased emphasis on career planning. A Volunteer Day is also in the making, and is tentatively scheduled for the afternoon of November 19 in Strauss Lounge. This will serve as an ''information day,\ with several agencies and graduate school representatives eXplaining and recruiting students for various volunteer positions or career training. The overall emphasis of this Volunteer Day and its fellow innovations in the Placement Offic~ is to encourage stuclents to open their eyes, to get away from ()nly classroom experiences, and to discover for themselves just where they want to go from here .

They will meet a strong Rochester team in what promises to be an exciting Homecoming hookup. The well rested Union II hopes to catch the Yellowjackets flat after last week's drubbing by Williams. The 16-7 defeat dropped Rochester's record to 2- 1. The Yellowjackets are Jed by Little All America receiver Ralph Gebhart and running back Mike Corp ( 176 yards thus far}. Gebhart is one of those rare gridders who goes both ways. (Two interceptions last week.) Quarterback Brian Pasley and nmning back Bryan Heagney are both questionable starters against the Dutchmen due to injuries sustained last week in the Williams encounter. Union Coach Tom Cahill plans to go with a young aggressive backfield. Junior Mark Broomfield is slated to quarterback and the running game will consist of Freshmen Jerry Logan and David Ruff, aNd Sophomore Mike Wroblewski. If the Dutchmen can cut down on the costly miscues that have hurt them so far, and get better line play both offensively and defensively, this could be a memorable Homecoming ball game. Ruggers Remain Undefeated by AUDREY KUPCHAN The Union \A\ Rugby team cruised to their second victory in as many games last Saturday by defeating Siena 12-6. A strong kicking game combined with hustle and defense gave the Ruggers the winning edge. Rookie Bill \The Toe\ Fellows was unanimously voted most valuable player for Union as he chalked up eight big ones. The senior hit on three out of four kicks (the fourth being nullified after too much time was taken) as he contributed 213 of the point total. In so doing, he stole the high scorer's title from the hands of Don Leach. consistently outran their counter- parts who had benefited from at least four more weeks of conditioning drills. Experienced observers of the game concurred in their praise of the serum. Chris Taylor, playing a near perfect game in his key position as serum-half, teamed with Andy Walsh and Pete Bloomfield as the first to come to the aid of a tackled Union back in many a tight situation. They were joined by Capt. John Andrews, Jim Stants, Mike Thompson and Bill Fellows. More often than not, the rucks and mauls were over before the Siena serum had time to organize. Ed Parisi exasperated Siena backs with innumerable bone-jarring tackles which frequently left the ball in Union hands. The Union backs played skills to keep the ball on the Siena side, thus enabling the rest of the team to concentrate on scoring. The \B\ team dropped their second game in as many attempts by the score of 18-6. The Union team made a number of mistakes attributable primarily to their inexperience. The lone Union try was scored on a burst through the heart of the Siena line by Mark Van Dorn. Burt Slavin provided the extra points. Other impressive performances were turned in by Bill Glavin, Dave Papa and Steve Robey. As the rookie Ruggers gain more experience, Captain Andrews has great hopes for the remainder of the season. This Saturday the Union Ruggers place their unblemished record on the line in a home contest against Albany Medical College. The game, on Library Field at I p.m., should be a fierce battle between these two Union University rivals. This will be the last home game of the season for Soccer Splits The Ulilion College Varsity soccer team split its two games last week, dropping Rochester 3-0 on Wednesday and losing to the Ephmen from Williams 3-1 on Saturday. A strong second half performance was evident in both games, but unfortunately for the Garnet, Williams proved to be too difficult to overcome. On Wednesday's contest, the Rochester squad proved too young and inexperienced to keep the Dutchmen at bay. In a game marked by periodic thunder- showers, the Dutchmen could not get untracked, and although they dominated the first half, they could not score. However, the tables turned in the second half, as Union's vaunted offense exploded for three inexperienced and basic fundamental mistakes caught up with the Yellowjackets. George Garavaltis continued his assault on the Union season assist record as he fed Craig Jeffries and John Denio for two and one goals respectively. The defense played solidly throughout the entire game as fullback Jim Bacharach thwarted numerous Rochester offensive thrusts and goalie Chris Huban turned aside 13 shots on goal. An otherwise perfect Saturday was spoiled by a hustling and rugged Williams soccer team. The Ephmen drew blood in the first two minutes of the game when they were awarded a penalty kick. Down 1-0, the Dutchmen rallied furiously and controlled the ball for the most part. But late in the first half, a Williams forward capitalized on a miscue by the Garnet ftdlbacks and put Williams ahead to stay. The Ephmen speedster got behind the fullbacks, went in one-on-one on goalie Chris Huban, de ked him out of position, and put the ball in the nets. In fact, the Union defense was plagued throughout the game by the long chips of the Williams' halfbacks that constantly caught them too far up on defense. The Garnet played an interesting game the second half. With 16 minutes left in the game, Jeffries blasted a blazing shot from ou·tside the penalty area which the Ephman netminder couldn't handle. Down by only one goal after Jeffries' score, the crowd roared its approval and U Hi on kept intense pressure on the Williams' defeRse. Finally, with 6:23 left, Rich Earl forced a crucial error and the Dutchmen were awarded a penalty kick. Craig Jeffries took the kick, but was unable to knot the score as he kicked the ball wide of its mark. Williams then completed the scoring by an anticlimactic third goal. This week is another busy one for the team, featuring Hamilton on Wednesday at 3:00 and Hobart for Homecoming at 11:00, both home. With an unspectacular 3-2 record, this could be a telling week for the future of the soccer team this season. Gridders prep for Homewming tilt. Leach, however, set up the first score with a clutch pass to Steve Klak in the first half. After taking a pass from Tom Ryan, Leach ran the ball to within five yards of the goal line before he turned to give the ball to Klak. The opposition, drawn towards Leach, was unable to recover in time to stop the awesome Klak who had moved to an outside position. Klak glided in for the easy score. lackluster offense compared to their strong start in last week's game. Fortunately, their outstanding defensive play helped make up for the sluggish offense. Brian Iucker and Fred Simon devastated the opposition with quick, sure tackles and Tom Ryan was always there to pick up the loose ball that resulted. Jeff \Shifty\ Hirst, John Rivkin, and Don Leach utilited their kicking the dedicated Ruggers of the....-----------------------------, It was the hustle of the serum, however, which enabled Union to stav ahead.

The sad thing is that the Union College Bookstore has little to offer in the w~y of variety: obscure (and generally trashy) science fiction, sec.ond rate posters, an anemic poetry section, and, oh yes, every major classic from Jane Austin to Emile Zola (a positive note, but who doesn?t already have his or her copy of The Gre~t Gatsby?).

The-Union College Bookstore should be more than just a place to buy typing paper. The Best by Peter Passell and Leonard Ross (Pocket Books, $1. 75) is a recent addition to the bookstore, and a welcome one. It is highly opinionated and extremely funny. The topics range from the seriously analytical (The Best Hope For A Pollution-Free Engine) to the ridiculous (The Best Nixon Line); from the esoteric (The Best Living Theoretical Physicist) to the immensely practical (The Best Flavor of Baskin-Robbins lee Cream). I gave this book a baptism of fire. 1 went to a stereo freak l know and told him that The Best Stereo at Any ·Price was an Integral Systems model 700 amplifier, a Phase Linear 4000 pre-amp, a Sequerra · model I tuner, a Bang and Otufsen Be9gram 4002 turntable, a Shure V-15 Type III cartrictge, and AR- LST speakers. He didn't argue. The Best is a fine book, just the right mixture of humor and intelligence, and is definitely worth reading.

Union would be able to \establish a firm base for admissions in areas Which have not contributed applicants to Union in the past'; as was . stated by Craig Carlson, Assistant Director •of Admissions. Union's -. reputation would not just attract • . athletes, though. Students from all over the nation would be drawn in by tbe publicity. Union's reputation as one of the finest small academic colleges could be transmitted across the country through athletics. An increased · awareness of Union as a fine college would, without a doubt, increase applicants enormously, thereby allowing Union to raise its entrance standards and thus improve its·· academic disciplines. So, in the long run, an increased proficiency in athletics will strengthen our · acjl.demics; not weaken them, as Thau has stated.

These special .elections are the result of the negative vote of confidence for Senior Trustee Geoff Taylor, l.,ee Rimsky, and Jim Kane, that occurred during ~he tra,nsition period betwee!l the former Union Constitution and the Constitution under which we are presently operating. . . petition requirements and is therefore running unopposed. Coincidentally, only Lee Remsky and Jim Kane submitted petitiens for the position of Senior C!a:;s Representativeto the Senate; they too will run witho.ut opposition. The need for tomorrow's elections reveals that the Town Meeting of spring term and the entire t;onstitutional dc:;bate about appointing Messrs. Taylo.r Rimsky, and Kane to the All: Equal rights debated Consequently, there are three positions to which candidates will .be elected tomorrow: At-Large Senator and two senior class representatives to the All-College Senate. Petitions for candidacy for each of these positins were available in the Student Activities Office during the week of Octaber 13-17 and were to be submitted with the requisite l 00 signatures on Monday, the 20th. For the position of At-Large Senator, only Geoff Taylor met the College Senate was merely a formality. The reason for the Town Meeting last spring revolved around the legitimacy of then Junior Class representatives Kane and Rimsky having their power extended to include membership on the All-College Senate, under the Old Constitution. The result of the Meeting was the negative vote of confidence for Taylor, Rimsky, and Kane. All three had been, prior to the controversy, empowered as College Senators, positions to which they had not been elected by the student body. by JO-ANN MESSINA On Monday, October 20th, at 8 p.m., Maxine 8aron and Anne Booth represented the ERA Schenectady Coalition in a debate against Mr. and Mrs. E. Brietenbach,. repre:>entativ.es of Operation \WAKE UP\. The question· dealt with whether or not die Equal Rights Amendment should be passed in New York State. This question will be asked of each voter in New York State on November 4th of this year. The' ERA states that-\Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the state of New York .or anY subdivision thereof on account of se~.\ As Maxine and Anne tried to relay, if this amendment was a\dded to the Constitution, it would guarantee all rights to women, based on the idea that, \all people are ·cteated equal.\ As the opposition to the ERA prought out, \a. lot of laws have recently been passed,. again-st sex discrimination,\ but these laws can be easily changed ox: repealed. \Constitutional amendments are .our .way of ensuring that laws are not ignored or repealed because of immediate political needs.\ .. Th~.J:ldyocates .of ·~WAK.E UP\ are saying that the ER.lA will invade private homes · and perspnal relationships. One of the questions 'Mr. an'd Mrs. Breitenbach asked was, \If a woman loses financial support from a man, how will she exist?\ Supporters of the ERA claim that the passing of this bill will not interlere with the personal lives of individuals and in rnost cases, a woman would be able to exist without financial support . froin her husband. · Watching this debate, one could not help but -.·see the emotions involved in this' issue. The proponents of b~th issues concludeq that it was up to the individual to decide whether or not to vote in favor of the ERA. Bittleman displayed by DIANE NELSON A series of works by Union College Professor Arnold Bittleman is now on display at the Schenectady Museum. The series includes thirteen charcoal and pen-and-ink drawings done between the years 1969 and 1975. The pen-and-ink drawings are the result of Bittleman's interest in an aspect of drawing that allows forms to be created out of marks. This is done similarly to the prints of Hercules Seghers, who taught Rembrandt how to etch. In contrast. the two charcoal drawings of the Canaan- Valley are studies in light and sp~ce. It is difficult to classify Bittleman's work under one '>pecific category. He attempts to produce things to be particul·arly his own. His interest in nature is apparent by the nature theme in many of the drawings. Other drawings, such as \Babel II\ are th.e result of fantasy ideas. The landsca,pes are complete inventions. They present an attitude about the way nature grows and man's posttJOn in the world. Jn·,summary Bittleman is a nature artist and an imaginist, sometimes leaning towards the surreal Professor Bittleman earned his B:FA and MFA at Yale University. His teaching experiences include years at Skidmore, Minneapolis School for Art, Parsons School of· Design, and Yale. Bittleman is currently Artist-in-Residence, Associate Professor of the Arts, and Head of Visual Arts at Union. He has exhibited in nurnerous one man shows. His invitational group shows include shows at the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum Annuals, and numerous others. His work can be found in the permanent collection~ of the Museum of Modern Art, Fogg Museum, the Whiteny Museum of. American Art among others. The artist's work will be on display at the Schene9tady Museum until November l6.

Paul Corwin, Sue Draper and Jennifer Port were appointed to the Forum; election of the remaining representatives to the Forum and All-College-Senate was discussed, Elections are to be held Thursday Oct. 23. The Forum agreed to canvass the Student body, by way of a questionnaire, in an effort to determine student priorities. The second meeting of the Student Forum \{as held oil Oct. 9. The Forum reviewed each club and committee that comes under its jurisdiction. The following organizations were viewed as questionable in at least one respect: Bowling Club, Glee Club, Cheeileaders, Film Workshop, Union Christian Fellowship, Golf Club, Linebacker, International Relations Club, . Debate Club, Modern Dance Workshop, Outing Club, Northeast N.Y. Youth Orchestra arid Ensemble, Political Forum, Photo Society, Ski Patrol, Ski 1' earn, Sl MS, Concotdiensis, Speakers Forum, and Table Tennis Club. The Committee on Committees and the Audit Committee were directed to meet with the clubs in question and submit a report to the Forum as to their standing. Arnie Hiller presented a bill which would limit the spending of any Committee or Club until the Audit Committee has met with that organization. The bill was passed unanimously and ts immediately effective. Continued on Page 8 Union gridders racked up 21 points against R PI in their first victory of the year. See story · on page 12.

Professor Boyer proposes that a twelve- point grading system is the most equitabl~;: way of dealing with the problems that the present grading system creates. (An example of this, he says, is that two students may receive. gr~des wl:tich differ by a full point when the work . they did in the course is substantially the same.) Professor Boyer also tries to defuse what he. feels are the three pdmary objections to the system; that the system would increase competition, it would be too complex, and that the faculty would be deluged by complai!ljng students. lt seems to me that tbese objections can not be discarded so easily as Professor Boyer thinks. ·would increase under a twelve- point system. Under such a plan every point ,on a quiz or lab report, not to speak of ho11r •exams, could have a large bearing on a student's final gtade. It would be to each · student's advantage to do even one point to graduate schools, especially pre--med and pre-law students. On the other hand, a looser grading little to complain about (though it system, where the worries over is of note that instead of fout grades are les!; emphasized, borderlines, as in the old system, promotes an atmosphere more there are now eleven). conducive to what we think of .as · better than the next fellow.

Mr. Harkness has done a commendable job in travelling the country to solicit funds in support -- a\though an early date (e.g. the fourth week) would be desirable for the administration. The problem of finding enough rooms is also taken care of; if enough rooms are scheduled to accommodate all the 9:30 classes, they will take care of all the slot 2 exams. Since no one can register for two classes at the same time, most of the hassles of exam scheduling automatically disappear. Since this was conceived as a sort of \Early Warning System,\ the Registrar should print the exam scheduling at the beginning of the term along with the exceptions (Chem 10, Calculus, it must be planned before the day Classes meet M, T.

A first suggestion is to establish This also applies to the proctors, One advantage of this system is Page3 Opinion What does deserve inquiry is whether there is a grading system that can meet the requirements of the type of school that Union is. Obviously the divergent natures of ·pre~ professionalism and liberalism demand the same kind of ~ompromise that Union is itself. I am prepared to suggest such a compromise. The college should institute a twelve-point grading system that is not mandatory for all courses; for example, it seems perfectly reasonable that even though there are the facilities for giving plusses and minuses, some professors would choose not to do so. Also some students .might wish to forego the plusses and minuse!); in these cases they would have. to decide early in the term (as is the present case with pass-fails) that they wanted the registrar , to translate their plusses and minuses to letter grades. Similarly, professors would have to declare at the outset whether they 'would grade ori a: · tw~lve or five-point system. · This system obviously presents the problem of complexity: ~ut it is warranted in light of the complexities which Union's academic policies themselves present. of his program. There is also little doubt that a successful hockey teain will attract recognition and additional funds for the College. Should this money be applied for maximum benefits for both the student body and Union as a whole, all students would be most grateful to Harkness for his contribution. However, and this is a fear and not a prediction, all the other students who contribute to the college in their own ways, from working lunches at West to being student Trustee. cannot be forgotten along the . way. It is essential to remember that every contribution and activity here is significant to some extent, yet the rewards are few.

Then, later in the term, as is presently done, a detailed schedule with the rooms can be given out.

.. , Page4 CONCORDIENSIS, Wednesday; Oct. 22. 1975 ~ arts Television.: Edited for televis.ion by JACK PITNEY What's the sense in eqiting movies for TV? After all, the average viewer can simply tune out any program that offends him. But that's just the point. The greater the number of tune-outs, the lower the ratings. And since ratings are the basis of the industry, the networks want as few tune-outs as possible. Hence, the scissors. Of course, the members of the various Program Practices departments claim to act out of a concern for the well-being of the American public. They want to appease those who feel that the sound of a dirty word or the sight of a female breast could help warp the minds of a generation. If their stated concerns were genuine, their standards would be consistent. But they are not. Close analysis of TV editing reveals two sets of standards: one for average box-office draws and the other for hits. Under the former, any potentially offensive material is cut right out, regardless of its importance to the film. But with a smash like The Godfather, as little as possible is edited; sometimes, the director of the film is brought in to supervise the cutting. For example, compare NBCs handling of The Godfather with the kind of job it has done on lesser films like Play Misty for Me. In the case of the C'Orieone saga, a mere 60 se(:onds was trimmed from the three-hQur running time. Most of the gore remained intact: the horse's head, the shot-out eye., and numerous other gunshots and .garrotings. In Misty, on the other 'hand, nary a drop of blood made it to the TV screens. Key sequences, such as one in which Clint Eastwood's p~ycho slashe~ her wrists, were sci~sored into meanirtglessness. Other examples abound. ABC let George C. S~ott say \ba!)tard\ and ''sonofabitch\ in Patton, but not in The Hopital. CBS deemed it OK for Dustin Hoffman to fondle Anne Bancroft's breast in The Graduate, but poor old Ben Johnson couldn't get those senoritas in The Wild Bunch. Se a question arises: if nudity, profanity, and violence harm our psyches, why should the previous success of a film have any influence on censorship decisions? It could just be that the commonwealth is not foremost in the minds of the network brass. People are less likely to tune out a hit than a box-office flop, since they've probably waited a long time to see it on TV. Indeed, many of them are looki~g for the juicy parts, so extensive editing would disappoint them. And the networks aim to please.

Ohnothimclgen by MICHAEL MARTIN Extra Texture finds George Harrison literally buried in the grave he's dug for himself since his first fantastic solo album, All Things Must Pass, was released. Since that beginning, · Harrison, has gone downhill with the speed of a runaway locomotive. He released, in order of appearance, Concert for Bangladesh, a nondescript live alpum, followed by two poor albums, Livin·g In a Material World and Dark Horse. But Extra Texture 'manages to surpass all previous lows imd rests alone, firmly at the bottom o.f the scale, as the worst George Harrison album to date. : . The opening cut, \You ' is bouncy and moves well but the banality of Harrison's lyrics shoots the whole th.ing down: \1 love life, No you Yeah you, 1 do.\ It happens again in the last cut entitled, \His Name is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen):\ Once more the lyrics are now_here, and Harrison's vocals are even worse. He seems not to want anyone to hear what he~ written and I don't bl~rhe him one bit. The only time the vocals are strong is when the backup vocalist, Paul Stallworth, joins in.. But it doesn't happen enough to make a difference anywhere on the album. . Technically, the a.lbum is well done. Harrison has surrounded himself with most of the recording industry1s top \session men\: Leon Russell, Billy Pteston, Tom Scott (Carole K:iQg:s jazzman), Jim Gordon, Klau§):~borman, Gary Wright, Catl R'a(lle, and Jim Keltner.

The eighty-eight students involved in this year's progra·m are living with individual families in the host countries while studying the cultural aspects and language of the region. Participants in the T enn Abroad Program in France are living in Rennes, the capital of the province Brittany in northwest France. Their classes, which began September 22, are being taught by faculty of the University of Rennes hired by Union College, and are held in classrooms rented from the University. Union students are living in the homes of French families, thereby getting an intimate view of daily French l,ife as well as fuH immersion in the French language. Union College French Professor Paul 0. LeClerc directs the program in France. In addition to their classwork, the students will go on a number of field trips, the main focus of which will be French a·rt and architecture. They will spend two days in the Loire valley and a full day in Chartres, and will explore places of interest in the immediate vicinity of Rennes.

In addition, he is teaching the course, British History, the same course he wo11ld have ordinarily taught this faH on the Union Campus. This is the first time since Union College started sending students abroad for study in 1969 that a group has gone to England, or for that matter, to any Engl.isli- speaking country. Students had been \quietly agitating\ for such a course for a couple of years, said Dr. Allen. Bath, noted for its mineral baths since Roman times, is particularly suited for such a course, Dr. Allen noted; \it has sites dating back to the Roman occupation, and it is especially rich in eighteenth-century buildings.\ The twenty - three students visiting Italy this fall will be in Florence for ten weeks, taking courses in Renaissance art, contemporary Italian civilization, and the Italian language. They are also housed in the homes of local families. The students in this program will also have the opportunity to go on a number of field trips to significant architecttual and artistic sites in Siena, Pias, and Lucca, and will also have free access to Florence's art museums.

People cannot be expected to seek out the Church, so it must come to th~m. She does not see religion and life as being separate, distinct aspects of people's lives.

She is Father Jim M~:~rphy's replacement aHd a Catholic sister of the order of Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. Assigned here in September, Sister Pat has been making an effort to Inect Union students and staff and get to know them. Sister and the Reverend Erwin Schwcigardt work as a team out of the Office of Ministry in the Placement Office. The name \Office of Ministry\ was chosen to reflect the emphasis on service that Sister Pat feels is important. This concept is a little different from the Newman Clubs that have been stressed on college campuses in the Albany Diocese for the past nine years. The general goal of their office is to be available to students and staff in whatever way they can be of service. This goes along with President Bonner's idea of making Union a caring community. So far, the only specific events that have been planned are two Masses, to be said at 7:30 p.m. in Strauss Lounge on Oct. 26 and Nov. 2. Sister Parachini, in trying to get to know the people here, is also trying to assess the campus community as a whole and find out what some of the needs aFe.

The proposed calendar calls for four courses in an extended fall term, three courses in a 1 0-week winter term, and two courses in a shortened spring term. The Town Meeting will be held before the November meeting of the Trustees. Concordiensis, Political Forum and IRC were removed from the list of questionable organizations.

term, us tees. Forum the '. I CONCORDIENSJS, Wednesday, Oct. 22, 1975 Paf{e 9 Special Senior Elections: The Candidates Are: ,JiiD Kane I have found that wit!;! people ~Jutside of Scllenectady County or those not directly involved in academia when I say \I go to Union College\ first, I must convince the other in the dialogue 1 am not studying to be a minister, or that I don't know how it is to go to school i•t:J. central [ennessee, as Union is in upstate ~cw York. The other party, ,cmtches their head in reflection and recaHs a very bright but obscure cousin from Long Island who went here and is now a professional man somewhere. Bin how does this relate to student governance at UColl'! It is my in tension to make that clear, then proceed to outline the role and structure of student government here, and how I as one of the present senior class representatives .to this Student Forum, perceive my role. Union is presently in a gestation, moving itself towards addressing the problem of obscurity with the \Common Man\. It began in 1970 by going co-ed; then in 1972, the Science and Engineering Center was built, followed in 1973 by Carnegie renovations. In 1974, the library addition and in 1975 the ice rink. This year's freshman class is the largest in its history, and student enrollment has been creeping towards 2,000 through the three years I have been here. For Union's growth has concomitant problems. This is evident in the complaints of the members in the Womens Caucus last year, on the slow assimilation of women into the mainstream of the College life. This year, the criticisms arise concerning the Achilles Rink; with hockey players the academic climate here in conflict. Those two specific examples, as well as many others which may more personally effect you, are symptoms of the problem. The cause I perceive is Union's rapid growth. It is in this area that student voice should be sounded and a monitering of the motion effected. It is here where stl:ldent government should be strong, active, and aware. Last October, Mark Smith, in response to that kind of realization, initiated a series of Task Forces related to student morale and the quality of student life. President Bonner also created committees such as the President's Commission on Women in an attempt to tackle Union's queries. Governance was radically changed last year as the framework was revised. A report by this committee suggested that the old college \governance system institutionalizes and thus reinforces disagreement among the studen~s. the faculty, and the administration ... Furthermore, the {old) system is so complicated and so spread out that, in many situations, it is unclear who should take initiative and how things should get done around here.\ The old Steering Committee evolved into the Student Forum and now not only do class representatives sit on that body but also liaisons from the Student Life Committee, Presidential Advisory Committee, Planning and Priorities Committee, members of the tax Committee and student trustees. The All College Senate has been expanded for fourteen faculty and ten student members. Of those ten students, six are generated from the class representatives. There is . one exception to that, the class of 1976.

Page 10 CONCORD!ENSJS, Wednesday, Oct, 22, 197!5 Ruggers :~;toll On by AUDREY KUPCHEN The Union Rugby A Team journeyed to Utica last Sa.turday for an afternoon game and protected its· unbeaten record by turning back Utica-Rome, 6-0. Their record now stands at 3-0-1. Although the game was marred by the ·bad field conditions; Joe (Rocko) Giovanne tur·ned in an excellent score at his fullback position. His heads-up play set up the lone try early in the game. laking the ball deep into his own territory, Rocko moved up . the side·line, weaving between the opposition; and passed off to Don Leach just as he was hit. The fleet-footed Leach then raced 60 yards for the scqre. Bill Fellows tallied the kick after-try with his consistent toe. Jominated \serum situations. While. the serum would keep the opposition from moving well, the line was consistently moving down the field. Burt Slovin, Jerry Kirby, and Terry Trembath all tur.ned in a stella·r performance, by passing, kicking, and running better than one could expect on the muddy field. The B team broke into the winning column for the first t:ime this season by winning 11-4. The game was never in y_uestion as Dave Papa raced down the field for an early score. The opposition never mounted a serious attack in the first half as Union was aU over the field. With both teams being evenly physically matched, the experience of the Union t!:am wa~ the dominating factor. The powerful and quick Union serum was found constantly thwarting any attempt of Utica to generate an Offense. Mike (Rock) Thompson and Bill Glavin were credited with numerous bone- crunching tackles that would set up a Union attack. Captain John Andrews alld. Jim Stants and Andy Walsh broke up any offensive play the Utica.,Rome team would try to form, the few times thev won the Union,.. In the second half, Burt Slavin set up the next score before passing off to Andy Walsh. Moving down the field, Walsh then tossed the ball to Steve Klark who, in turn, passed to Chris Taylor. Taylor then brought the ball in for the score. Junior QB M.ark Broo~fie1d on a keeper in Saturday's victory. See pg. 12. -photo by LesTrachtman - .

From left to right, Sally .Willse, Donna Sock ell, Perky Francis and Stenze Plater. Beautiful skies and lots of spirit enabled the girls Field Hockey team to come close to a victory last Thursday, against the girls of Middlebury. Middlebury going into its fifth year of being totally Undefeated, only managed two goals against Union's tough defense. The defense, led by goalie Louise Dunn, with a total of twelve saves, had one of their best games ever. Strong defensive clears by full backs Toni Gahn and Beth Ruman sent the ball far into Union's offensive zone, with the quick sticks of Martha Dolan and Sally Willse following the shots even further. Center half Perky Francis dominated the mid-field as usual, with her excellent stickwork and checking. The front line had many opportunities to shoot on goal, but the Middlebury defense was as tight, if not tighter than Union's and no goals could be scored. Both of Middlebury's goals came as hard-bought shots; there was nothing anyone could do to stop them. But the showing Union made had been their best up until then, and the girls looked extremely impressive on the field. The game was even considered a victory 'for some, after having such a great game against the same team lhey\had lost to last year by a sc_ore of 9-0. season. Playing under conditions which can only be described as incredible, the girls fought their way through ankle deep water and rnud to win. The game was tight in the first half, with neither team being able to score because of the mud. Donna Sockcll'~ hardline drives would travel fot about three feet, before stopping dead in the mud. A lot of credit must be given to Eileen Thomas, whose quick feet, and stick-work at her left wing position, kept the ball in Union's offensive end almost for the entire game. In the second half, the play got a little sloppy, literally, because of the mud. People were hacking at the mud, in order to momentarily blind an opponent. Then Union became serious, and while Cobleskill was still laughing, our girls scored. The first shut was a flick from inner Muffy Hart's stick, on a pass from Perky Francis. Five minutes later, Muffy again scored, this time unassisted on the only line drive shot in the game. This game was Louise Dunn's first shutout, and the team's first long deserved win. - photo by Don Hamerrnan Girls TenniS. in States by JOANNE MF.;UTHER AND ELLEN LICliTIG For the first time ever, Union's womens tennis team was able to compete in the New York State Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (NYSAIAW) tournament. The school was represented by two singles players, Lesli~ Kent, as the A player, Ellen Lichtig as the B player, and two doubles teams, Faith Cail and Lee Russell {f\), and Sam (Margaret) Goldin and Joanne Meuther (B). Beginning on Frida,y, October 17, it lasted appro\xbtiately thr'ee' days, allowing for the achievement of both indivi'd\ral· al'id ·team Honors.

Ellen 'Lichtig, playing . in the number two slot, met the number J player from Buffalo in her first match Friday and confidently defeated her, 6·2, 6-4. Ellen~$ second match was against the number 1 girl from St. Lawrence with Union losing 6-2, 6-3; despite a fine display of talent. This put her in the consolation round where she competed in a fairly long and steady contest though bowing to Oswego's A player, 6-4, 6•2. The first doubles team, Lee . Russell and Faith Cail drew a bye in the first round and played a consistent winning match against player, 6-2, 6-3. In the quarter Wells College 6-4, 7-5, in the finals, a superb match was waged second.

Good luck and keep up the good work. We are root'n for you! by LYNN BATEMAN The womens volleyball team to date has had two scrimmages; one was an easy victory, and the other was a hard-fought loss. The win came Oct. 16 when Carver Community Center came to Union to play our women. The C.C. Center was not used to power volleyball .so the games were fairly slow, although there was outstanding play by Amy I Juchatz and Cathy Reals 1 who garnered many points together. Union set up and had some excellent spikes, but it was surprising how ml:!nY · of these spikes ·were returned. Union won the set in the first two games. Th.e scrimmage loss came at t-he hands of the Union mens volleyball team, simply because the men played harder, served better, placed their deadly spikes, and were used to the net being a foot higher than it was.

Page 12 CONCORD!ENSIS, Wednesday, Oct. 22, 1975. · Football Wins First , Regain Dutchman's Shoes by CHARLIE FLANAGAN and HANK HEALY A fired up Dutchman contingent, inspired partly by an untimely poem written by one of R PI's finesi. physically molested the timid Engineers in Troy last Saturday before a wet homecoming crowd. The final score was Union 21, the Turks a big nothing. Union dominated every aspect of the football game with some bone crunching tackles that seemed to intimidate the Engineers every time they got near the football. Coach Cahill commented that \the kids were really charged up. I don't know what it is but there's something about RPI that makes their blood boil.\ The tempo of the game was set on Bob Mathias' 35 yard return of the opening kickoff. Only a wet field prohibited him fFotn going all die , way. Putting together a ground assault, Union attacked with enthusaism and maintained that level of inspiration throughout the gray afternoon. Sophomore fullback Marty Cohn rambled 18 yards on the · first play from scrimmage, and Union embarked on a 13 play series that was terminated by a fumble at the RPI IS. Due to a crushing tackle on the Engineers' initial play from scrimmage, the ball squirted loose and Union began again right wher;.e they had ended only one play before. Union scored first, five plays later with Mark Broomfield passing to Sigma Phi's tight end Frank Hoster. John Ballard added the extra point making the score Union 7, RPI 0. Bob Henkle recovered a fumble on the RPI 15 in the beginning of the second period, setting up Union's second scoring drive. Milt Herring ran the ball twice to the ten before scampering to the end zone of the third pia)· from scrimmage. Milt used his quick 9.9 speed and good balance to break two tackles in recording his first Union touchdown this year. Cahill said that · he \was real pleased with the way Milt performed. He's a tough kid with great speed, and he can block too. He'll go after you.;' Milt's run gave Union a 14-0 lead which they nursed till halftime. John Ballard's field goal attempt in the third period was no good, but he repulsed an RPI scoring threat with an interception in his own end zone. The fourth quarter was dominated by Union just as the previous three were. RPI ran but lO offensive pl~ys in that .stanza, • one ending by an interception by if olll Hood, another terminated by Peter Sherman's recovery of a fumble snap. Good hands, Engineers. Mike Hevey ended but another futile offensive drive by divmg on and deflating a. loose RPI football. Marty Cohn's determined ten yard run around slippery left end with but 3; 13 left in the game \seated the lid\ on the Dutchmen's 53rd win in N·ew York State's oldest continued rivalry. RPI has but 16 wins while 4 ties have been recon!ed. \I wasn't actually aware of the tradition involved, the Shoes and all,\ Cahill admitted referring te the pair of red Dutchman's shoes given annually to the winner of the contest. \I .did realize that if we didn't beat RPI, we'd be in real trouble heading into the toughest half of our schedule,\ he added. From a disasterous start at W Pl and continued disappointments with Tufts and Rochester, Union managed to piece together a good .offense, both running and passing. With Milt Herring, Marty Cohn, Jerry Logan, Dave Ruff and Ed. Adams shuffling into the RPI defeDJC, Union aa:ounted for Senior Milt Herring turns upfield in Saturday's conquest over RPI.

Goalie Chris Huban making a sliding save was kicked full on the shins and sustained a deep bruise that will keep him out of this week's game vs. Colgate. The Sophomore midtielder from Westport, Conn. shut out the opposition the rest of the way and Union bagged its sixth win. Aside from H uban's one game injury. the Garnet are intact and continue to play their winning style of soccer.

As Wilder points it, Skin was written ·~on the eve of our entrance into war' and under strong emotion . , .. it mostly comes alive under conditions of crises.\ Within the title lies the theme of the play: \no mati(;r how hard pressed or frightened, the human race has power to surv:ive its great adventure in a world where physical nature and its 0wn internal conflicts pose endless threats.\ Beneath the initial theme lies · Wilder's concept ef man, which is evident in. all his major works: Wilder holds man to be worth preserving for all his absurdity, and that \man's lot is worth the effort it costs him to sustain life, however great his misfortunes .•• As in Our Town, The Skin of Our Teeth is presented in three a(:ts. Each act involves the struggle .af mankind to survive the periodic disasters that threaten it with extinction. The first act concerns man's battle with m~ture as the glacial invasion of the lee Age threatensthe human race. Act Two, depicting man against the moral order, is set in the pleasure palaces and on the boardwalk of Atlantic City. The last act shows man against his greatest enemy: himself, as the world recovers from the ravages . of war and attempts to make a fresh start.

The Antrobuses are the \typical American family,\ and during the course of the play they relive the history of the whole human race. Each character seems to be an allegorical character on three levels: as an American, as a biblical figure, and as a universal human type. Mr. Antrobus, played by Mitch Blair, is the artchetype middle- class American, he is the .. father pilot\ of th~;: human race. Mrs. Antrobus, characterized by Teresa Meade, is the eternal mother figure. The children are Gladys (Robin Messing) anq Henry (David Beguin). They appear to represent the Antrobus' hope for human perfection. Henry s~mbolizes the proof that this hope will never fully be realized: he is a figure of evil, the biblical Cain. The most dynamic character in the play is the Antrobus' maid, Sabina, played by Shari Ratner. Ber character, extended to the three allegorical levels she becomes at the same time the faint-hearted maid, the Semitic mythological figure of Lilith, and the carefree spirit to whom the human race turns when no dangers are imminent. Wilder had definite intentions in putting these characters together in Skin qf Our Teeth . \These main characters are Americans who, like the people of Out Town, have hidden in their daily lives the key to the destiny of the human race.\ The next editors-in-chief of Concordy will be Mike Affinito and David Moskowitz.

In the days of Darryl Zanuck, the directors were under contract and the writers were under contract. And now it's quite different.

Tlieir power and accountability results not from student consensus, but from apathy about who makes what decisions. This consequence of apathy makes possible the emergence of the most ambitious and conspicuous, but not the most qualified or able. We are then left with a syste!D in which_ .power is taken by those who wanT it, while everyone else looks the other way . A government of the apathetic and a cotlege of the non-involved produces an institution of stagnation rather than advancement. We are he~;e to learn and to grow. as both students and individuals and while textbooks provide part of the answer, there is a great deal beyond them. Union is more than just a turnstile to a job or graduate school; but it will remain as it is unless we give these four years the importance they deserve. We must perceive our roles to be contributors as well as receivers and work for progress now, so that those who succeed us can enjoy the fruits of our deeds. ~by :fl. B. l'HAU These are times of rampant pre-professionalism and competition, of pragmatic re- evaluation of one's future. Unfortuiut,tely, the by-products of these conditions are a·pathy and non-involvement, and the impression existing that this College is not one's. home for four years but merely a stepping-stone to one's career. Apathy is rtot necessarily a course chosen because of expedience or ease, but rather a carefuJly selected alternative to making a contribution. Those who chorise ' this' alternative should not be- castigated, because colleges lnterciew: stand for the .individual. It is unfortunate, however, that the majority of students do indeed hold something back during their tenure at Union. It is also selfish to come to school with only the opinion that four years later one will be well on the way to a professional career. Something is missing, for Unio·n should. be \lnderstood &s more than an investment of twenty thousand dollars and four yeats in ~xchange for a bachelor~s degree.

It is wrong to pas!! throygh lJnion ~ithout leaving one's yet more -often than not the that remain unresolved solely because students feel that by the time a solution is found they will be gone. If we passed the. buck of progress and con tri b uti on to · e a c h succeeding class, under the assumption that they should work for it because they will enjoy the fruits for a longer time, then little would be accomplished and we would have only ourselves to blame.

Rave you found. any evidence of increasing public confidence in the accutacy of polls! Yes. As .a matter offact, we just did a survey - a poll on polls - and \found that there is a growing acceptance and understanding of polls. We compared our latest results with those taken ten years ago and fhe · results are more favorable today. A majority indicates at least some general under-standing of polls and a majority how feels that they are, in most instances, accurate election surveys. Why1 Well, I think that there has been a tremendous proliferation of polls. An awful :lot of. information bas been written about surveys and polls and a lot rnore are being taken .. . And certainly, polling is discussed and tau,ght in schools. bo polls help create a No, I've· never seen this operate, either here nor abroad, actually. In other words, as we show a candidate or a party leading, he does not pick up strength in successive surveys. So pe9ple are clearly not jumping on the bandwagon. · _ How much do polls influence th~ actions of eletted official~? Well, that's exceedingly hard to measu~e, but I'm certain that they pay attention to them. .Is such influence specific or diffuse? Well, ·it's beth. In some instances, it's very specific. Many candidates take polls to determine what moves to make and that's very .specific. Is the public paying mc>re attention to politics now than in previous years? . No, if anything, they're paying a little less. No. There's very little improvement on that score. People are pretty much turned-off by politics. ihey have a pretty low regrd for politicians, sadly. Is there any relation between the amount of information a person receives and the direction of his pol~tical opinions? Well, people with more education tend to ... Well; it's hard to define in terms of education because at a certain level - with advanced education, you get a shift toward the Democrats. But in terms .of (people with) a college education, (they) tend to be more Republican. Do subtle changes in the phrasing of survey questons affect the responses?

Food Costs Rise by AUDREY ROTHSCHILD The exorbitant cost of eating on the Saga M:eid Plan is forcing an increasingly large number of students to caok for themselves.

Conceris: Hot Tuna drives on to monotony by ARNIE HILLER It was with great anticipatian .that I waited to see HQt Tuna last Friday evening at the Palace Theatre. They are (were) one of my favorite rock bands, however when I last saw them in Central Park over the summer I was not impressed. Their most recent tour, which included the Albany performance, has met with mixed reviews, and I guess this one will keep that up. Hot Tuna developed in the great Sart Francisco tradition as an offshoot. of the Jefferson Airplane. Their first album, a live acoustic effort, featured Will Scarlet, on i-l'armonica, as well as Jonna Kaukonert, on- acoustic guitar and vocals and J~;tck Casady, on bass. When \Tuna\ went electric in their next two albums, Hot Tuna and Burgers, they were joined by the youthful (70 year· old) Papa 'John Creach on electric violin, and Sammy Piazza on drums. These two albutns·present Tuna at their very best with out.standing· performance~ by all the members of the band. It should be noted that Tuna did not build up their following by rel~asing ;:tlbt1ms. They are a \live\ band in the truest · sense, with a great entourage· of. Tuna regulars pr.esent at all of their numerous shows;· Tuna's two most -recent . efforts The Phosphorescent Rat and Ameiic~~ Choice have sho\'in, the transformation of thebandinto the realm of electric rock. Absent from their .recent performances are the infamous bass riffs of Jack Casady, and the strangely enchanting power behind Jorma's lyrics. These qualities have been forsaken for the increased amplification and intensity which characterizes Tuna. Unfortunately the diversity which once enraptured the audiences is now gone and ,the replacement only serves ~o satisfy per;iodically. They play with the same intensity and fervor, in fact they might even be technically more skillful, but the material which they prQduc~ is at best tedious.- · .· Friday night's show, played incidentally before. a less-than- capacity crowd (this c:an be r~lated to the exorbit1;1nt price of tickets, $6. 75) marked Tuna's return to the Albany area; last year they were greeted there by a completely ecstatic crowd. The evening with Hot luna, which now includes Jorma and Jack, steady as ever, and Bob Wheeler (shakey) on the drums, featured an inspired effort by both the musicians and the Qudience. The material was predominantly from their most recent album and from a soon to be released effort. Gone from the act were the old favorites, \Candy Mart,\ ..

Jorma's voice is not what it was, but his gui~ar playing on this evening, was as good as ever. Jack never seems to lose not only his quick fingers on the bass, but his completely unique looks. Bob Wheeler on drums is suspect on the drums but for the brand of music which Tuna seems content to play he is adequate. One hopes they will not be content with the blaring electric sounds which are now their trademark. They are a terribly talented group of mus1c1ans who have proven themselves to be capable of proudcing outstanding music. All kinds of folk music and a free, day-long craft fair will highlight this year's Eighth Step Benefit Festval, to be held Friday and Saturday, November 7 and 8. Two evening concerts will be held at Trinity Methodist Church (Lark and Lancaster Streets, Albany) at 8 p.m. Admission will be $2.00 at the door. Featured in Friday evening's concert will be RAY ANDREWS AND RAY FRANK, accomplished guitarists and banjo pickers, playing blues, ragtime, and old-time music; JACK HUME AND PETE McHUGH will -play. pedal steel and guitar, and NEIL ROSSI, former fiddler .for Spark Gap Wonder Boys.

Music and other merriment will continue Saturday from II . a.m. to 5 p.m. when a CRAFTS FAIR will be held at First Presbyterian Church (State and Willett Streets, Albany). -· Proceeds from the event help to pay the operating expenses of this non-profit, f!Ommunity coffeehouse . located at 14 Willett Street, Albany.

One need only look 45 miles to the east to find a college that is probably the best small college in the east, but also puts other small college's athletic programs to shame. Williams College is the hardest college to get into in the country (a good measure of academic excellence is the quality of the students at the college. Onion is, according to last year's Concordy, \the best of the second strata of small schools\) 5 Williams College somehow manages to have fine athletic facilities (except for that basketball court) to complement its academic facilities. They beat us in almost every sport every yeyr (even basketball last year), but it's their 'best teams we don't even compete against. Their squash, swimming, and ski teams .have long been among the top in the nation. Williams does not field a bad team in any sport. And that goes for Women's Sports as well. The point is that a top academic program can go hand in hand with a top athletic program, so well in fact, that the academic side attracts fine athletes and the athletic side brings in many top scholars. Williams probably gets more top scholar-athletes than any small college in the country. Union could move in that direction, but only if we get national recognition in something, academics or athletics. Such a sit11ation could easily snowball and Union could be the \Williams of Schenectady\ rather than the \Harvard of Schenectady.\ By the way, the comment about the \alleged anti-Semitism\ is the funniest thing I've read about this college in 3 years. 1 can only imagine that any anti-Sernisitm generated on the cam:pus is a result of R.

The game was dose in the first half, fullbacks 1: oni Gahn and Beth Ruman\ (a sophomore transfer from Oneonta, playing against her old teammates), did an excellent job of keeping the opposition from scoring. Louise Dunn had to make very few saves in this Union dominated game. Unon's lone. goal came right after the opening of the second half, when Union was awarded a penalty corner .after Oneonta had ·failed · to report a substitution. Last Thursday's game against Skidmore Was a lot closer than what the score ~ndicated. Union dominated the first half, with their excellent triangular plays between the two three-somes of Martha Dolan, Stennie Plater, Sharon CartnizzaFo, and Sally Willse, Muffy Hart, and Eileen Thomas. Center Donna Sockdl had some har(l shots on goal, but the bail could not penetrate into the nets. Once more Perky. Francis played a tight game, fo.rdng man.y erron on Skidmore's offensive line. Fullbacks Toni Gahn and AHyne Price, and Goalie--l:.ou.ise Dunn also had their sh~te of fighting, 'with the few shots the Skiddies took on goal. Durhig the second half, Union slowed down considerably, and taking advantage of this, Skidmore scored two quick goals. · Muffy Hart, on a ba.U deflected off the stick_ of Donna Sockell, flicked the ball right pa~t Oneonta's goalie.

Hobart's senior captian Rich, Kowalski; the 210 ·lb. AU-East back, treaded for 203 yards on 30 carries and two touchdowns as the Statesmen reversed the score to 21-0 over the Dutchmen. Alexander Field resembled more of a swamp than a football field yet the condition didn't seem to curtail the offensive powers of the Hobart team as they grinded out a totat of 344 yards on the 8round. \The wet didn't seem to bother him too much,\ Cahill pondered, \but that's the way it is with the good ones. They can run under any conditions.\ Cahill didn't seem too disappointed about the amount of yards his defense yielded. \Actually we didn't play that badly on defense,\ he said. \Kowalski broke a couple on us, but overall I thought we contained them pretty well.\ Hobart did all its scoring in the first half, and allowed Union to touchdown in the fourth quart¢r penetrate past midfield only once. but was dragged down and The second half was played under dunked from behind by John conditions similar to a monsoon.

In what Last Wednesday Union. tore into the most -difficult part of their schedule with zest. Hosting on t:he Red' Raiders from Colgate, the Dutchmen were hot fo.t their first win in six years. \the Red Raider contingent were ranked sixth ~in the New York State Soccer standings and, on paper, figured to be the Garnet's toughest test to date. Well so tnuch for statistics. From the first lllinutes of the game the Garnet toek control, control they were never to- n;linquish. Within 6 minutes Union had expfoded for a 3 go;il lead on geals by Craig Jeffries, George Garavaltis and John Oe'nio. Colgate came back for a lone tally in the fir$t half on a brief 1apse by ·the Union fullbacks, to make the score 3-l at the half. was the most einotion.algame this season Union pulled out . a dramatic come from behind win, that virtually assured the team an ECAC play off-berth. The now 9th ranked Dutchmen were surprised by· a quick t~o goal outburst early in the first half as the Great Danes toek advantage of an indecisive Garnet defense to jump ahead. Characteristi~Uy, however, Union refused to dte m this., the most heated of soccer rivalries. Co.-Capt. Cr!lig.)effries started the Garnet come-back effort with a loose ball goal about mid-way· through the first halL Shortly thQreafter John [)enio roared down the right side, drew the Allmny iletminder out and deftly paS.Iled to George Garavaltis for the .tying score · Both teams came out smoking after half-time as superior head after excellent pass marked the play O!l both sides. Union w:;ts successful for the most pa:rt m controlling the mid~field area as oilGe a:gai~ Ralph Rouniain was the paragon of stability at halfback The action was fast and furious all . through the final If the first half scoring outburst was sudden, the Gamet's second half offensive sent Colgate reeling. Jeffries got the show goil}g early in the s~rtza as he netted Unions feurth goal on a htunmer . to the far post.. Jim Manning, last weeks reserve goalie in .the RPI win, added a penalty kick . minutes later as - Union continued its relentless pressure on the hapless Colgate goaltender. · Goals by Denio, Parker, Antin, and Garavaltis closed out the game for the Garnet while their crushing victory vaulted Union into the States top 10 at the #9 position. It is impossible to give credit to any one player in the Colgate game; needless to say when a:team sets a game scoring record (8 goals) against one of its most difficult opponents a total team effort is necessary. Possibly the biggest story of the day was the very creditable performance by freshman reserve goalkeepet> Mark Reckucki. Reckucki filled in for the injured Chris Huban and turned aside several Colgate threats with dramatic saves. Over this past weekend the Garnet booters travelled to Vermont to take on the defense minded Middlebury Panthers. · Continuing their high scorin.g ways the Garnet tallied four goals against a 'Panther defense that had allowed only three scores itt their last eight games. Playing before a highly vociferous partisan ctowd the Garnet defense dipped irt with a bruising shutout effott to bring home a 4-0 verdict. Forging ahead·, at their recordbreaking pace the Garnet broke their season team scoring record, ama,ssing 36 goals this season,. while Craig Jeffrfes tied his season record of 13 goal perfo-rmance with two tallies, In the first half, Jeffries scAred With l6 minutes gene when he beatthe Middlebury goalie to a, Jim Manning chip· pass. Early in the second half craig added his second goal from outside the penalty area on a beautiful pass from Halfback Ralph Roumain, Outhustling the Middlebury eleven all over the field, Union drew oohs and ahs from the stanza; as the _last minutes ran <}own, it appeared ~s if t~e unoffici!ll- district championShip game would end in a tie. · The l;Jnion squad was hardly about to let their superior effort go to waste. :W·ith about 55 seconds left in the game, Senior Co-Captain Craig Jeffries cut in across the l8 yard line, knifed between two- Albany defenders, and bore down on the goal. Craig · wasted no fancy moves on the Great Dane goalie, and his bullet shot found its mark in the lower right side of tb.e .goal to send the team to its most emotional victory of the year. With only one game remajrting (against Trinity), the Garnet hooters (9-2) are a shoe-in for the ECA C tournament and stand a good. chance of hosiing the annual post season fete.

Common-sense- isms, if you wiH, that seemed to drop from our parents' lips out of the blue; often having no meaning until time andfor J.ife's bittersweetness have smoothed our rough, young edges. So often on initial hearing, I'd smile, pretending to pay attention. Knowing too much, and :not enough, I would smugly ignore the truth of those words until I found myself caught up in one messy situation or another, wishing myself ~nyplace but there .. Hey now! Maybe that's the way it is supposed to be, learning by mistakes, and sometimes not learning on numbers one or two, but twenty or thirty. Like gqs;sip, you know the \he says, she said, you did,\ junk.lt can and wiU get to the point where it is extremely fun. A sick. kind, but fun. I have had \friends\ whom I would talk to for hours ori end about everyone else's 'business but mine or theirs.. Later on. I'd discover that w~ didn't trust each other . enough to reveal ourselves. So we played it safe, by talking apout others. Or else it would be a situation where information about you always seemed to filter through five different sources before you .heard the \dirt.\ By the time. you got wind of it, everyone and their mama knew, or thc;mght they knew your business, a long time before you did.' And then to add icing to the cake, how the information finally gets to you is a trip in itself. Case in point: Your man thing just isn't working out. The word is out that he is seeing someone else, but you don't know about it. Then one day,. when ~ou're out, a \good-hearted 'friend\ takes it upon herself to rap ... it to you in front of a group of \well-wishers.\ Everyone looks· properly sad, meanwhile checking out your response so closely, so they can report to all their friends how you took the news. Now there you are, hurting so badly that your heart is about to burst (but you don't relay this emotion to your friends), mad as hell because your s .. t has been aired in public, and desperately wanting to make him a eunuch. Nine tilJ.les out of ten, even if you want to work things out, your· stupid pride won't let you. So armed with the ••sympathy\ of sisterhood, you close your nose, freeze your heart, show him the way out, and start singing the blues to the chorus of \I told you he wasn't any good.\ Then after aU the smoke has cleared, you find out that the information supplied to you: a) wasn't true, or b) didn't matter if it was, 'cause c) you could have worked it out, if d) you had realized the telling came from a position of contempt, not concern. One thing I've learned from experiences like that and others is to check· me and my associates out ·carefully before we embrace in friendship. Another important thing that I iearned . is that all smiles aren't for real, including my own. And learning to keep my mouth shut when I didn't know what the bell I was talking about. And als.o respecting confidences that are told me. In essence, to paraphrase an old ·saying, \If Marilyn Vannessa Becton's slip is showing, tell me; because I am the only one who can do anything a:bout it.\ Thank you. , · Marilyn Vannessa Becton Editor Library Budget Slashed Wednesday, October 29, 1975 ·upward _Bound ...

Newsletter As I review the depressing struggle of being raised in the ghetto, I realize that one has something to be proud of if he succeeds in life. One can be proud if he succeeds because you are deprived of a great deal and in achieving your success you have conquered the deprivation. You can be proud if you reach your goals because things are not always handed to yv. · the road you travel and whatever you get you can feel confident that it is both hard and well earned. The most significant factor one can take pride in IS that the suppressed people have the potential that the upper middle class have and all they need is to be blessed - as I have fortunately been - with the opportunity to display it.

Zimmerman, February, 1969. pp. 6-1-6-6. 6. THE ANTISLAVERY MOVEMENT As the slave system hardened and extended its sphere South and West, anti-slavery sentiments also spread and took root. Inspired by the defiance of the slaves themselves, Negroes and white reformers in the free states joined forces to campaign against the outrages of slavery. The pioneers of the aboHtionist movement in the early years of the nineteenth century were usually free Negroes of the North. Sometimes these men were themselves ex-slaves; often they had friends and relatives still in bondage. Furthermore, their own position was none too secure . Professional slave catchers roamed the North, and many free Black men were kidnapped and sold to the South. The schemes to recolonize Black Americans on the African continent provoked an immediate response by free . Negroes and provided the issue around which they first organized. They noted that proponents of colonization were anti-Negro and pro-slavery, and they correctly surmised that emigration was designed to drain off the troublesome free Black population and thus make · the institution of slavery more secure. Groups of individuals who began by denol!ncing colonization soon undertook a campaign against slavery itself. The militant crusade against slavery began in 1828, with the publication in Boston of a dramatic abolition pamphlet. Its Black author, David Walker, preached a revolutionary message that struck fear into the slaveholders' hearts. Southern legislatures held secret emergency sessions, and in many areas it became a capital crime even to possess a copy of Walker's Appeal. The South's reaction is not surprising, for Walker's call was written in words of fire. Few masters could sleep easily with their slaves reading or hearing such passages as these: \America is more our country than it is the whites -- we have enriched it with our blood and tears ... 1 he Americans have got so fat on our blood and groans. that they have almost forgotten the God of armies. But let them go on. Remember Americans. that we must and shall be free, and. en lightened a~ you are. wi II you wait until we shall. under God. ohtain our liberty by the crushing arm of power? I speak Americans for your good. We must and shall · . fr-::~, ! say, in spite· of you.\ I he very success ot the abolitionists brought them certain problems. As the movement grew ar.d incorporated desperate tendencies, disputes arose over tactics and demands and even long-range goals. There was always a wing which wanted to compromise or draw back, which thought that moral suasion would eventually convince the sl'aveho1ders to relinquish voluntari,ly their four billion dollars worth of ebony chattel. Those who spoke out most forcefully against compromise and insisted that the struggle continue until every slave was liberated were often Black abolitionists. Mamy had grown up in bondage and seen its horrors. and they harbored few iltusions about the possibil·ity of containing or reforming or toleratng American slavery. Speaking from their own experiences, the fugitive abolitionists were often the most poignant and effective anti- slavery agitators. Botti white and Negro abolitionists responded to Walker's call, and to reports of the growing oppressiveness of slavery in the -South. In order to build an effective movement against slavery they needed an organization and an active press. William Lloyd Garrison, the most famous white crusader, began publishing his influential Liberator in Boston in 1831, and he was a founder of the American Anti-Slavery Society two years later. The movement spawned other major newspapers, such as Frederick Douglass' North Star, and a succession of short-lived papers: The Mystery, The Colored Man's Journal, The Anglo-African, and a host of others. The abolitionist movement also produced a new American literary genre, the ex- slave narrative. Literally scores of memoirJ by fugitives appeared after 1840, and many of these volumes enjoyed considerable popularity. In pamphlets and petitions and from hundreds of speakers' platforms, the abolitionists spelled out their arguments against slavery. Many were religious men, and they denounced slavery as a crime against God and the teachings of the Christian Church. They made other charges as well. Slavery, they said, was contrary to the fur.damental principles of American life and made a travesty of the rights enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. It was unsound as an economic system, smce a slave rarely toiled likt> a free man working for himself. rhe slave system had unfortunate cultural and social results, for the master-slave relationship brought out the worst in both parties. Finally, Is this Robert Davis or Minnesota Fats? they argued, slavery was obviously becoming a menace to the peace and safety of the nation, as fears of slave insurrection. bought violence and hatred. Churches and religious leaders fought on both sides in the battle over slavery, and some even managed to remain ne1:1tral. A growing number of churchmen came out against slavery during the abolitionist era. The Quakers were, of course, early defenders of individual freedom. and they formed a consistent and important wing of the anti-slavery movement. Many Negro churches were also associated with a drive to liberate the slaves. These included the new and growing separatist churches, as well as Negro churches of the Methodist and Baptist denominations. (The white leadership of the Methodist and Baptist churches had condemned slavery i,n the late eighteenth century, but both had retracted their Fesolutions l!lnder pressure from southern congregations.) The abolitionist Frederick Douglass was a giant among big men. He had fought his way out of slavery to become the most famous spokesman of his race and an inspiration to men who loved freedom everywhere. The Anti-Slavery Society hired him as a lecturer in 1841, but was almost embarrassed by the power of his oratory. They cautioned him against appearing too proud or learned, and enjoined him to stick ro- his own story and leave the conclusions and plans to ·the Society's leaders. But, as Douglass said, \It did not entirely satisfy me to narrate wrong. I felt like denouncing them.\ And denounce them he did - with words that stirred and shamed audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. Frederick Douglass is now remembered as the greatest crusader against slavery, but his audiences knew him as the defender of all the poor and oppressed. In Ireland he campaigned for home rule and was introduced as \the Black O'Connell.\ Back at home, he spoke out against mistreatment of American Indians and Chinese immigrants, exposed the neglect of education the poor, demanded an to capital punishment, and \Vas a powerful ally of women struggling for equal rights. The great reformer did not retire after the Emancipation Proclamation. Until his death in 1895, Douglass used his fame and influence to insure true liberty and dignity to the freed men. Henry Highland Garnet was cut from the same cloth a~ f-rederick Douglass, although history has notm.emorialized him ('0111.,_. 011 Pqe D · Page C ! Ms .. Lynn L.

In -his \Address to the Slaves of the U.S.,\ Garnet scorned the passive acceptance of slavery, and expressed his love for freedom in fiery words that are reminiscent of David· Walker: \But you are a patient people. You act as if you were made for the special use of these devils. You act as if your daughters are born to pamper the lusts of your masters and overseers.
