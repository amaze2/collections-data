'¢•,; • .•. ,.,, ~ a Fiji Brothers display Brown Cup Volume 107, N~. 7 November 2;.1977 Phi Gamma Delta Takes Brown Cup by AND\' OELBAUM Phi Gamma Delta has emerged as the winner of this year's Stephen P. Brown Cup. This highly coveted trophy is awarded to the fraternity with the best all• around record in academics, athletic and extracurncular activities from the previous year. Last year's competition between the fraternities was particularlY, intense as Steve Richards: the President of Fiji, explained to Concordy. He emphasized that the superb competition between the frats in last year's race made the awarding of the cup to Fiji particularly gratifying to each of its brothers. Richards expressed concern, however, over t\he possibility of .any bitterness materializing between any of Union's fraternities from the competition for the Brown Cup and the final results.The maintenance of warm friendly, relationships between our school's fraternities, said Richards, remains prevalent over any competition between the school's frats. Richards also expressed his deep appreciation to many fraternities, and tn part1c ular Delta Ph1 (this year\ runner-up) and Sigma Ch1 (last year\s winner) lor the superb sportsmanship they exhibited as they immediately congratulated Fiji lor its victory. \l\hey really have been super!'\ exclaimed Richards. Continuing, he expressed his hope that the members of Fiji would be as gracious when another frat wins the cup_ Student Forum Takes Action Delta Phi was the runner-up in this year's standings, but actually finished in a tie with fiji for first place. Since Fiji had more points than Delta Phi in the activities category it earned the right to the cup. By winning the cup for the second time in three years, Fiji has the opportunity to be able to retire this, the most recent Brown Cup. with their next victory. The two previous cups were retired by Delta Chi anq Sigma Chi respectively, both of whom achieved the honor by winning his specific cup the necessary three times. by STEVE GRILL This week's Student Forum meeting was held on Monday, October 31. The meeting opened with the approval of the minutes. Serious concern was eX.pressed about the manner in which the minutes were written. An informal proposal was passed asking the Secretary of the Forum, the one who writes the minutes, to do so without editorializing. To obtain copies of the Forum meetings contact a member of the Forum. To obtain minutes from any . other committee meetingl!, the office of the Provost should be contacted. The next item on . the agenda was concerned with the Election Committee. Chairman of the committee, Bob Morgan, was present. There has been much confusion in the past two weeks involving the election for Senior Representative. In past years, the Student Forum has set the date for the elections. The confusion was a result of both the Forum and the Election Committee feeling that it was their responsibility·to set the dates and time for the election. Contained in the By-Laws of the Student Forum is the following description of the Student Elections Committee: a). The Elections Committee is responsible for the arrangement and administration of all college- Wide elections and referenda in Which members of the stUdent body participate. b) The Elections Committee is charged With drawing up and administering a general policy of guidelines for all elections Procedures. Such policy shall contain provisions for its own change and be acceptable to the Student Forum. Although no formal vote was taken, it Was agreed that it was the Election Committee's responsibility to set the date and tune, after being informed by the Forum that an election would take place. At times, the Student Forum could request that an election be held within a certain time span. Qecause ·of the procedural problems which arose last year, Ute Election Committee will draft a set of niles which will be followed in all elections.. T.biS draft will be ready during winter term lor approval. The question of money being allocated to retain an attorney for the purpose of giving advice to and representing student organizations was raised. Over tbe past tew years, editors of Concordy have sought legal advice as to whether or not they could be held libel for certain articles printed. The cost of retaining a lawyer for a year can run as high -as $1000. IJecause of this and the relatively few times that legal advice is actually sought, retaining an attorney wa.s ruled out. Instead, any student organizations needing legal advice are urged to contact the school lawyer or to seek free legal aid through the city, 'with the last resort being contacting and paying an outside attorney. The next issue raised was the possibility of the Student Body renting Carnegie Hall, which is owned by the Trustees, for a nominal fee. The College Center would then be operated by the students. An advantage of this is the possibility of increased revenues which c.ould be used, along with the money generated by Student Activities \fees for allocation to the various campus organizations. It was stated that the profits from the Pub alone would probably pay all maintenance costs. The possibility of hidden costs does exist and this would obviously be a major drawback. Because it was felt that an indepth investigation is necessary, the following motion was passed: The College Center Committee is charged to do a full impact and feasibility study on the efficacy of renting Carnegie. The study will be completed by the third week of winter term. It was felt that a more .specific proposal, outlining what areas were to be investigated,, was neo:essary; one board. will be prepared for the next Also approved at thi!! meeting meeting. was the publishing of a student ·Next it was stated that the directory.

Bob Morgan, chairman of the elction committee, stated that he was pleased with the turnout for the election and the runoff, and · would like to thank the following students for the substantial amount of time they contributed in order to help make the election a success: Rich Budd, Pam Currjln, Deb Douney, Pam Kerin, Jo-Ann Messina and AI Wymt. The O-verall Final Standings 1. Phi Gamma Delta 2. Delta Phi · 3. Sigma Chi 4. Phi Delta Theta 5. Theta Delta Chi Note: In cases where there is a tie in the Overall Standings the . higher position is given to the · house which ranked higher in the extracurricular Activities category. Any qoe~tions concerning the Brown Cup, contact Tom Amato at Beta. It should also be re~;ognized that Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Phi, and Kappa Alpha chose not to compete tor the 1977 Brown Cup. An election tor semor representative was held this past week :for Judy Lavien's recently vacated seat. She was elected to this two year positiQn, but decided to step down -at the beginning of bet second year. Last Thursday, October 27, the election was held in the lob~y of Carnegie Hall and one hundred and sixty-eight of the 470 students in the class of 1978 came out to cast their votes. Tony Benigno captured 40.4 percent ·of the vote, followed by MiJce Marks with 32.2 percent and Barry Eagel a distant third with 20.8 percent. Since neither Benigno nor Marks obtained half the votes, a runoff became necessary. This runoff was scheduled on Monday, October 31 on the first tloor of Carnegie. One hundred and sixty seniors voted on Monday in the election between the two candidates .. hi the runoff, Tony Benigno came away with 59.4 percent of the vote to win the position of ser,aior representa~ve, while Mke Marks took 38.1 percent of the vote, thus leaving 2.5 per cent of the votes cast for other candidates. The I.D. system, along with the use of a directory, worked Well and it was announced that thete is. a possibility that bal!ot machines will be used for the upcoming elections during the spring term, as the offices of President, Vice-President, Class Representatives, ~tu~e~~ ~~us~~;- Tony !Jenigno, Senior Rep. •

The question is what is important~ financial success, or happy students? Since the Social Committee has a budget to spend, financial success seems to be a secondary consideratkm. rhus, this past concert was made free. To say that it was inexcusable tor the Chapel to be halt full for the Dean Friedman-Elliot Murphy concert may be true. However, it is inexcusable on the part of the student body, not the Social Committee. What excuse can students have for not attending a concert, even iJ they haven't heard ot the performer1 For those wlto weren:t there, both artists were called baek for encores, and Dean F rie<iman left the stage to a standin8 ovation...

Mr. Zolner remembers the s~udents' reaction. \We didn't like it,\ he said. \Up until the rna ilro om was completed, there were maW:.oxes in each dormitory. So we complained about haviag to go out to get the mail, especially smce there were no other facilities in Camegie.\ Now Mr. Zolner has ideas for additional improvements, but he says they will remain ideas until he discusses them with the College Center Committee, composed of himself and five students. ''I'd like to improve the appearance of the game room on the ground tloor,\ he said. \Decorations could be put on the walls and ceiling.\ Part of the money for these improvements would be generated from the revenue of the room's game machines.

Pe~- Note: Name in bold faf;e type is the Chairperson Q'f the Ad Hoc Committee Disturbed To the Ectitor: I was somewhat disturbed when 1 read yottr editorial entitled Concert Woes (Oct. 26, 1977}. Your suggestions and recommendations lead one 'to . believe that . Concordy should have been. booking concerts all along, s.ince it is such a cut · and dry procedure, The problem of h-o()¥ing a concert at a school of som¢ 2,000 students is that the outcome of the concert will a lrri o s t a I w ay s be unpredictable. The decision to present 'avant garde' artists like Dean Friedman and Elliott Murphy was based be removed.\ The screen had been rented on a trial basis for a month. But it failed to generate much extra business, so the Board decided it wasn't worth the expense of purchasing it.\ Prior to Mr. Zolner's appointment as Director of Student Development on July I, the position had been filled temporarily on a part-time basis, since December 1976. The position, created on July I, 1976, had been given originally to Craig Carlsen, who vacated the post when he was appointed interim athletic director. Mr. Zolner graduated from Union in June, 1976, but he returned to the college again that fall as a member of the admissions staff. During the 1976- 77 academic year, he visited high schools and interviewed prospective Union students. \l wanted to work here because I had a great time as an undergraduate,\ he said. \And 1 wanted to contribute to the college in a way 1 couldn't as a student.\ He accepted appointment as Director of Student Development this year because he ••wanted to be in more contact with the students at Union. In the admissions otiice, our job is done when the student is accepted to the cellege.\ \I want to get to know the students oh a more personal level. I want them to come to me with their questions and problems so that I can help make their time here as meaningful and well spent as mine was.\ upon an. identical decision last year to present the Poussette- Dart Band and Trent Arterberry (which sold out to a largely Union audience). The only inexcusable thing about the Billy Joer concert was that tile editors of Concordy did not bother to attend - for if they had, they would have realized that student indillerence and not Social Committee decision making was responsible for the losses suffered there. ln a school where but 167 members of the senior class voted tor their representative and some IS· percent of the entire student body supported the Student Forum's student unification effort {Trustee letter writing), it should not be deemed unusual that selling ' out the Chapel tn Union students is the exception rather than the rule. I realize that the Social Conunittee can be d()ing a rnuch better job in selecting concerts. The students at this school must make an effort to speak to members of the Social Committee or to attend meetings. ihe suggestion to have the COC stand trial over concert decisions wobld set a prtcedent which mig.bt . turtber alienate :student participation on committees.

However, don't help generate thts new feeling of concern because the Trustees asked you to do so. Don't help because you think it will save you some money in tuition. Do it because you care for Union College as a place. For four years we live at Union, and for many more after we graduate it will bring us back many warm, fond memories. In many ways, Union is our horne for life. Let's treat it as such. now with Tom B. and Co., l feel a compelling urge to write an open letter to the college community on a rather trivial topic. The lesson for today, boys and girls, is how to talk to a woman. I am in my early 20's so l have had some experience in the subject. l have never fell l needed a shovel so mueh as when 1 have spoken to some of you guys.

Some ladies who attend this school may have .gotten in due to their smile, their eyes, or another part of their anatomy (i.e., Daddy's wallet). (Fooled ya, didn't I'!) Not so this one (although not for lack of appropriat~ equipment). Unlike the Scarecrow, I do have a brain and it doesn't stop working when I close my legs.

Its W2UC-Amateur Radio Society dynamismwas radical. The works and the style of ,. the past were not being dUplicated, r;ithet the future was being anticipated. by GARY BOWITCH Hidden behind the tall walls of North College and the Arts building lies a conglomerate of electronic gadgetry in the headquarters of W2UC. An entity apart from WRUC, W2UC is Union College's Amateur Radio Society. The first station of its kind on the air, W2UC is basically an organization for those interested in working with \Ham\ radios. W2UC is simply another · oilicial student run organization. Like all other Union College clubs, W2UC gets its funding from the tax committee. Presently, tile club is made up of ten diehard ''Ham\ radio operators, headed by David Kahn. According to Dave Kahn, there are three major functions and goals which the organization attempts to fulfill. The first, and most important goal is to provide an outtet for any willing soul to converse with other \Ham\ enthusiasts across the air ways. Since it is illegal for Amateur radio organizations to broadcast, aH communications must· be two way contact. ln the past, the \Ham\ radio tanatics at W2UC have set up two way communication with such tar away places as England, South America and the U.S.S.R. Another function of W2UC is This message service als<1 entails a to provide •'Theory and Code ••pnone Patch\ whiCh allcws Classes.\ These classes are messages to be rel~yed from the. designed to provid-e those airways through the teleph()ne to interested .students with those i.p neec:l'c:lf the message. information needed to acquire a.

In addition, the organization has - short wave listening equipment. In order to send their messages' to the far reaches of . the planet; the H.ain enthusiasts a~ W2lJC. have erected two antennae. Located behind North College;, the antennae are a dipole a11tenna and a Yaki directional antenna er~ted ·atop a 60 foot tower. For those interested m Join:ing W2UC, meetings are held every Wednesday- night at . 7:30o. Meetings are always in the station located on the 2nd tloor of Haskins Lab connected to the greenhouse behind .North College and the Arts Building. AU-College Senate What all this anticipated,- most especially, for Mr. Sz~rkowski was the school <!f photography now termed. pltotorealism. As this art form matured the mayhem of composition, and subject matter that mafked much of 19th century photography began to l:ake some shape, Pict\ures became,. as a group, more coherent, and so began fulfilling the promise they held forth so allU-ringly .. The overarch:ing . idea of photorealism is that the surface reality being shot bas bound up witft it the meaning of the picture. · fhete is thougllt to be some .kind of .relationship between what is being depicted, the way in which it is being depicted (though there probably is no real difference between these first two) and truth. And as Mr, Szarkowski suggests this is. probably a Platonic n6tion of truth. by MURRAY LEVISON Jeff Scheininger, Tony Eenigno, thoSe committees that make Finally aU of this leads hitn to The first meeting of the All· MJ,~rray Levison, Stev~ Grill, policy currently decide . on an end that he ·wants to resist.

is all ful to CONCORDIENSlS, November 2, 1977 Page7 culture -~Rosenblum CoJiection___,__------------ The Walter C. Baker Foundation has made it ppssible for U nitm College to present an e:xhibition at the Schenectady Museum of some photographs from the collection of Naomi and Walter Rosenblum. The community's sincere interest and appreciation of the Arts was impressively demonstrated by the large attendance at the show's opening last Friday evening. The Co'llege is deeply grateful to Lois C. Baker for helping make this event p9ssible. As you walk into the show. you tirst see Edouard Boubat's \Lelia Brittany, France.\ It is a por.trait of a young woman; wearing a light blouse, she appears _.apen and vulnerable. There is a softness in the shading, texture to her clothes, and a gentle smoothness to her facial features. Her eyes gaze ot:f into the. distance, though seeming to behold an inner vision. Behind her and to her side- 1 is the face of another person; two people sharing a world, though alone in their own. Hung next to third photograph is Eugene Smith's \Woman- Spanish Village.\ This woman is old, shrouded in black, with only a portion of her wrinkled face revealed. Her eyes, downcast, are hidden in the shadows of their sockets. Bursting out behind her is a wall bathed in Sllnlight, cutting against the darkness of the rest of the picture. Off to her side we again see the image ·Of ;mother face, this time as a shadow upon the wall. Oq another panel, is hung Jerome Liebling's \Cleaning Woman-Mexico\and Lioette Moders ''Seated Man-French Riviera,\ and \Four Women.\ The ''Cleaning Woman\ kneels alone, a statue: The sunlight plays upon the Hoor behind her, drawing a halo above her hea.d. ·rhe pattern of lines in the stone floor, seen in pers.pective, converge above her, . adding solidity to the form and pulling one's eyes towards this ·haloed figure. Her hands are wet with the water she uses to clean the floor. Her eyes, dowrtcast, glance to her ·side .... A fattened man is seated in a chair; his hands, protected. by gloves, rest upon his belly. His socks, shirt, and suit a perfect match of small checkered patterns. With a snobbish snicker \he curls his upper lip towards his nose and draws his eyes in a squinted fashion, staring out at his audience. His body seems pushing at the edges at the piCture. \Seated Man-French Riviera.\ To the other side of this photograph is 'Four Women.\ Time has drawn its lines upon their ancient faces and hands. Peor in clothing, poor in environment, ri<th in spirit, they share a wooden bench in the street, One has her eyes staring ,, PERFORMANCE The first warm rush ·of love from strangers is enough to hook one on the business of being someone else for life.

With the gentle warmth of early morning dew, Lisette Model \Four Women\ droplets of rain rest .upon the web . and varied forms of leaves ·that surr-ound it. lt is evident that the theme that runs through the show is one of 'warm and life-giving humanity.' To pat;aphrase Lewis Hine, the show embodies 'things that need to be corrected, and things that . need to be appreciated.' For those students willing to take the walk, a vtslt to the Schenectady Museum to spend an afternoon at this exhibit would be well worth their time. Record Review: If You Dare by STEVE MONOSSON The following artists are not exactly Fleetwood Mac in \terms of selling power, but they far outdo them when it comes to artistic ability. Now some may argue this point and praise the virtues of Stevie Nicks' physical strpcwre,, but that bas nothing to do with .th~ sounds comi~g oyt ofi the s~ereo~ One artist: .that . has: long been respected !n t~C(:.~usic tr~~e as ~ing perhap§.Jh~,wos( . inventive, ingenious, and personal singer/songwriter around is Mr. Randy Newman. Little Crimhials, Newman's just released sixth solo albuJI:l, proves Newman's a'bility .. :'to~ ·:-wtite sensitive as well as humorous tunes. It's ~n ~mpo~.fl.Mt!ord foli,, Newman tor 1t •s hts ftrs~,.m ~ee years, and songs like th~ ridiculous \Short People\ the eerie .. In Germany Before the War\ and the socially critical \Baltimore\ dispell all notions as to the end of the Newman songwriting legend. Although it may not rank with Sail Away and Live at this point, tt may just reach that plateau for this good old boy's records take a while to fully sink in. Randy Newman's records grow on the soul l~ke a mother's love. Now who can resist a beckomng like that'! Seriously, there are several copies ot Criminals available in the book store, so do yourself a favor and .pick one up. He might be described as a cynical-intelligent- humanistic+ hysterical!-· undecked out Elton John. His music has a . message to it and what he has to say is usually worthwhile. Now what is worthwhile is aqother issue. . In \Short· People\ Newman attempts to devalue the worth of all persons of less than average staftih::-'' He· makes several ·insightful comments about their \little noses and their little eyes\ and goes on to make people like PaUl· Williams feel very inferior . In ,:.fac!,_ .i people like Williams should feel inferior to Newman w~eq. iLc~mes to writing and peH1ltHiing '(IUs latest concert at Ayeij('lf'istier Hall in Lincoln Ceriter Was tremendo'WS according to the New York Times), as he should to someone such as Tom Waits. Foreign Affairs, 1 om Waits' latest release on Asylum Records, is definitely not for everybody. He looks nothing like Stevie Nicks, nor does he sound very much like her, but he does have a distinctive and spellbindi~g 'style. To some, such as .myself, ·his voice is that o'f the ovet-stno~ed, over-boozed, and under-sexed lowlife which sounds a lot like a gravelly voiced Louis Armstrong. To others he sounds like a dying walrus. But these people are unenlightened · ignoramuses, so they do not count very much. If you are in interested in an account of a California-bound cross country trip with nymphomaniac nurses concluding with a rollicking rendition of \California Here I Come\ or a conversation between two rejected lovers at a bar; YOU can hear these (\Jack and Neal\ and \I N~ver Talk to Strangers\) and many others on this interesting work. Personally, I love this record and for Waits it represents his most concrete work in a long time as he has. toned down the ramblings of Nipthawks at the Diner and the smack-togetherness of Small Chan1e. A prerequisite to listening to this album is unbounded romanticism, as he is one in ·his own perverted way, a love of the blues, and again, a heart. He does not rock, and Led Zeppelin diehardspbeware. He is Jack Kerouac on record, to paraphrase many other critics, and he is life. Randy Newman and Tom Waits are artists with a commercial future, hopefully. Some may like them, others may not. Give them a cha.nce. ''I . l E. .

Room Contest Du11ing. the past few weeks Concordiensis has presented a campus.,.wide search for the .three rooms that epitomize their respective categories: best, worst, and most unique. Votes cast by our readers this week have been tabulated and the results are in. Without further ado; the winners are as follows: ~drum roll, please): Unil)n College's best room is 210 Davidson. Capturing · 63 percent of the popular vote, this room features the ever-popular rocking c'hait and crocheted afghan combination framed by an attractive wool wall hanging and colorful string-art designs. Plants and knick-knacks add to the over- all homey effect. Congratulations to Donna, Jan, Robyn, and Wendy tor their effOits above and beyond' the dorm norm, The most different, spectacular, interesting room is pectured. here, The residents created a unique, fpturistic decor, They rnade use of metalic spheres to express themselves on their walls. Concordy's readers de~med the idea a winner With an impressive 79 percent of the votes r.ast. Room 202 Raymond; a o~Chi abode, has earned the right to be· known as the messiest room on campus. The total lack of order and the clutter. o'bviously accumulated over several weeks, proved to be this room's most impressive feature.· The random disarray of empty containers, papers, and clothing is consistent with the overall theme. If you don't beli~;:ve that a. picture paints a thousand words, stop by and experience the UQique quality of these winners. Find out what makes them a cut above .the rest. Thanks and condolences to all the runners-up without wht>m there would have been no contest. Thanks also to aU those who cast their ballots and took part in the selection of the winners. Environmental Corner by KEVIN S€HARY NORA GOLDSTEIN Now that Congress and President Carter are debating the energy problem in the Capital, the PYE club leels that energy . warra;,nts some discussion at Union (especially with all of our future engineers and environmental lawyers). ls there really an energy crisis'! . Some, .like Senator Long (D) from Louisiana's oil territory would argue nay, and that if the government would just keep its hands off of oil and gas price controls· (and keep giving corporate tax protection), everything will be all right. Otllers, like the Armed Forces Chief of Stafl General Bram, see an impending Arab oil embargo as threatening to U.S. security. And eVeryone will complain if oil prices go up! What are our options for the future'! Will Carter's energy program make it through Congress'! (Will the PYE club's lobbying efforts provide the crucial ditl~rence'!) Can solar energy provide power soon enough or will nuclear technology be the answer'! Environmen~al Corner will examine the answers to these questions and more in the following weeks. Next week will feature tbe solar energy projects that Union students have undertaken (Lou Davis' solar refrigerator - it works - and Mark Edgerton's solar heating project for the engineering lab). The following week will introduce the pro's and con's of nuclear power, thereby stimulatin·g everyone's appetites to eome to PYE's debate on nuclear energy (on Thursday Nov. 17) featuring some of the area;s foremost defenders and opponepts of nuclear power (and po~l~ly even featuring ; alcoholic beverages). -Speakilfg of ·saving energy, State of the Union Richmon<i's third floor had the most paper for recycling in PY E's recent collection.

CONCORDIENSIS. November UColl Ruggers Split Ve1 by IIRUCE PULLIAM A beautiful Spring~like day warmly welcopted many returning alumni to the Union campus as well ru; the highly .. respected Colgate Rugby Club. This note of esteem was founded on the scores of recent Colgate encounters where their highly su.ccessful squad tallied winning margins by ligures a~ustomed to basketball fanatics in a· traditionally low~ scoring sport. .. a victory of Colgate 66, Boston University 0 was recently reported. When Colgate took the Hel(i an obvious size difference further neglected any doubt that Union would have their hands full that day. Regardless of the effects this may have had upon the fine crowd of rugby enthusiasts present, the Union Ruggers appeared undaunte<i; they were enjoying a successful season themselves during which they had consistently weathered distinct size di~dvantages, they knew they were. well-schooled on the finer points of the game and were confident that they would not be out ... finessed, and lastly, facing a team of Colgate's calibre in .front of a .. homecoming\ crowd had been building up l}nion•s P!!YCh since the game was scheduled. This was · obvious from the beginning as Union quickly initiated their swarming gang- taclding technique to push a surprised Colgate squad back into their own end for most of the early gQings. Colgate displayed a stiff defense and Union could not score on/ some brilliant opportunities. Colgate's early strategy was pretty clear; attempting to take advantage of their size most runs were directly at the Union line. However bruisingtackles by the Union line and tremendous pursuit by the Dutchmen scrummers made it clear to all that nothing would come easy; any victory would have to be deserved. After 40 strenuous minutes of constaht ' actjoil, the half-time score of 0 to 0 was appreciated if not surprising to all. The second half saw a slight change in Colgate strategy. They conceded to the steady tackling of Union (perhaps because 1 of a couple first-haif injuries). and turned to a more wide-open kicking game. This may have resulted in a slight relaxation in Union's pursuit and gang4ackling as a Colgate runner suddenly emerged from a crowd of Union defenders, breaking · numerous tackles, and ultitnately dragging a couple of ·Union ruggers into the endzone. Such a play has a way of breaking_ open such· a hard- fought game as all the momentum is switched to one team but not today; Union refused to lie down and die. Forcing their exhausted bodies to increase its etlorts, Union once .again battled their way downfield. When Scotty Shitken emerged from a crowd of bodies and bulled his way into the endzone, Union was .back into the ballgame. Union had no longer received the ~nsuing kickoff than had they found themselves threatening ag~in with a wave of momentum at their backs. They quickly drove for a lineout at the Colgate 10 yardline. But as suddenly as had this opportunity· knocked did it disappear; an enant Union pass on a potential scoring play was picked up by an alert Colgate back who scampered the length of the field for a Colgate try. This score seemed to knock some of the life out of a determined yet tired Union squad. Their nevet· say-die style of play created some potential scoring ~;:hances but a now enthusiastic Colgate team held firm. Colgate added an insurance score .in the closing moments of the hard-fought match b\lt it was a deservingly proud Rubgy Club that had won the approval of their loyal follq~ers, if not their last home Mike Thompson, Glenn 1 gnme of the fall season. , The follow-up game was me to the Dutchmen's liking. \ shall allain call this squad the\ team; t'or loss of a better nan but l would like to stress . til Union~s depth in rugby give th~ two full squads of equal abil1 unseen in other sports; it is no1 varsity~junior varsity setup i111 .in fact; with few exceptio everyone on the \A\ side h played in \B.. games and vi versa.

Given the addition of a Homecoming crowd of over 3000 spectators and even some rare cooperation from the Schenectady weather, it looked as if Union might finally end a Williams win streak over the Dutchmen which bad totaled eight in a row, Instead, Union responded with something closely resembling a national disaster as they took a 45-.22 drubbing at the hands of the Bphmen. The performance was, by far, the team's worst of the season, as Union not only succeeded in getting thoroughly beaten, but also allowed the game to reach the point of downright embarrassment. Very simply; to say that the Dutchmen couldn't do anything right is an understatement of unprecedented proportion. The stage was set from the very beginning, as Williams took the · opening kickoff and marched in 66 yards. for the score. This was the tifth time in six games that the Dutchman defense has allowed the opposition to score on their opening possession. The <mly time Union succeeded in scoring first produced their only win of the year over R. P, 1. This drive was particularly r ftllstfating as the Ephmen needed to use two fourth de>wn runs,• both ()f which prodUced me~surements that gave Williams first downs by less than the length of the football. ln fact, tlle touchdown . itself was· the result of a valiant .goal line stand wbich found the· Ephmen pus}1ing it over from the one for the score. Willi;tms countered twice more in the second quarter, as Ephnian quarter:back Bill Whalen hit Ken Hollingsworth with a seven yard strike to open up a 13-0.lead. The Dutchman offense whidt had the ball only six plays · in the first quarter, still could not get on track and when they were forced to punt, Williams blocked the kick and recovered it on the Union 41. Once again, tiley slowly made their way throllgll a Dutchman defense which simply A<~bfight spot in Union's Homecoming weekend was the .return to 100-plus yard form by sophomore running back Rich Romer, shown here being tripped up after a long first-half gain , never did tighten up as running a fourth down pass from back Scot Harrington, 22 carries Teuanovo to fullback.

Booters Drop One, Upset Ranked Middlebury The Union College Soccer team split this week, losing to Colgate 3-1 and then upsetting highly touted Middlebury 2-1. On a bright sunny Wednesday afternoon, the Union booters came onto the field with a lackluster attitude that certainly _ does not exemplify their previous etiorts. This, combined with Colgate's extremely talented squad led to Union's defeat. In the first half Colgate dominated play through accurate short passes and solid tackling. fifteen minutes into the haU, the Red Raiders tallied. Then just five minutes later they scored again on a penalty kick. These two goals were the only genuine threat on a goal by either team. As a result the half ended, Colgate 2 and Union 0. ·rhe second half started fast for \the Gate\ as they scored in the first ten minutes. However, even being down by three goals did not stop the Dutchmen from hustling at both ends of the field. A final blow against Union occurred midway through the half as Senior co·(!aptain, Pete Martini was ejected from tire gante for illegul.ly ramming tile goalie deep into his own net. , Still the Dutchmen persisted. Finally with just seven minutes remammg, Sophomore sub- stitute, Bob Feishman booted a rebound into the right hand corner. Final score Colgate 3, Union I. This year's Homecoming was expected to be a beauty. Beautiful weather was the forecast. A large crowd was anticipated for all sporting events. However. Saturday afternoon the Union College booters were not to be found. Instead ..-they were reportedly seen leaving the campus at 7:00 Saturday morning. · After a long three-hour blls trip to Middlebury, Vermont, the Soccer team prepared to face one of its toughest opponents of the season. Middlebury whose record was 7-1-1. and ranked 5th in all of New England seemed ready to demolish the Union· hooters. Furthermore a crowd of over two-tb()Usand (parent's weekend) was on·~hand for the .game. Yet, . ·~ ... - Union seemed untouched by this ad verse environment. In fact, even though the score at half time was ()-0, the Union Soccer seemed to be in total control. The second half started off ju.st: the way Mi~dlebury had. e\pected the entire game to be, numerous shots on goal, control of all head balls, and a steady passing game marked Middlebury's presumed dominance. But thanks to stellar goal keeper, Doug Crawford, the. Panthers from Vermont were denied time and time again. Due to Crawford's outstanding play, the Dutchmen regained their first half momentum and started to again control play. Finally with just fiteen minutes remaining; M1trk Decker threw a long ball from the sidelines that was then detlected into the goal by a charging Middlebury defender. A Hulce goal but the scoreboard still registered Union 1 and Middlebury 0. 1-Iowever this lead was shortlived as the Panther'st1nally broke Crawford•s stingy defense, Continued on Page 10 Senior Mike Smith, who will captain his last UCo/1 soccer game this Saturday on Daley Field, versus King's Point c o. o11$1!1i!t8 c = Fi The c time WI SS llO; the Stl again i,r were p outside• by the were Koblen< The t f!Jrther Commil use a1 activitie lar$e DIJ appeare motion approvf subcom with St; Commi1 gUide lin all SU£ Forum hind tan to be ~ curtail1 time allowan the stu res pons under organiz; exceed guidelin meant guide lin The u~ By D.

Volume 107, No.8_ Nov,mber 9, Jl'17 Finances Baffle Forum_.-- . - - - . The date was Nov. 7, 1977, The time w~s 9:00.. The location was SS 110; and all this means that the Student Forum was once again i,n session. AU the members were present, as we'll as some outsiders. The minutes were read by the illustrious secretary and were approved with Andrew Koblenz ahstainiJtg. The fir11t order <Jf business was f1,.1rth~r discussion of the Tax Committee proposals regarding use and misuse of student activities ~;:quipme:nt. Due to the large m.tntber of agenda items that appeared to be very imperative, a motion by Jeff Scheininger was approved which stated \that a subcommittee of the Forum meet with Stan Geberer and other Tax Committee members -to write guidelines which will encompass all suggestions raised by the Forum and othexs.\ 1'he main hindrance to quick action· seemed to be a desire by the Forum to curtail misuse, while at the same time permitting reasonable allowances of usage, as long as the student activity beads are responsible for the equipment under their juri:~diction. Each organization will be allowed to exceed the severity of these guidelines, but the motions are meant to set up mm1mum guidelines for the future. The next order of business involved the possible joining of the NECCA, the National Entertainment Campus Activities Association.. Ira Goodman and Denise Wa,chtenheim discussed their jaunt to the regional tonvention irt Gros1,1ingers la$.t week. They stressed the point that joining the association would be advantage()us for· the future arid our membership would be a gr~at asset to the entire studept activity program. A motion was presented by Jeff Scheininger stating .. that Union join, beginning l:n the calendar year 1978-1979 the NECCA convention. The .purpose of their attendance being to obtain c.ontacts and· open additional avenues of communication with agents, a.rtists, et.c.\ With the under11tanding that not only seniors be sent to provide ·continuity, the motion Wi!S passed. The issue of the Men's Glee Club fundilJ.g was then lmmsht up (see story on this page) and a motion was passed stating .. that Ute Forum place the Glee Club funding issue on the All~College Senate Agenda in order to set a sub-committee to explore other areas of funding while the Tax ·Committee continues to fund the Men 1 s Glee Club officially.\ The motion passed by a vote of six in favor, none opposed, and seven abstentions. The ne~t motion read$, \Moved - The Student Forum instructs the Tax Committee to fund Glee Club as it would any otl;ler organization while the Tax Committee tries to find the conseJtsus of the Forum being that an unfair situation was created by making an example of the Men's Glee Club, which bas been financially resppnsible, increasingly active, and generally providing a great deal of entertainment for the entire campus. At this point Student Trustee Andrew Koblenz was censured for ••abject sillyness.\ Due to the lateness of the hour, the rest of the items on the agenda, including another try at the calendar revision were put off until the next meeting, Mon., Nov. 14. by ANDREW MITCHELL The Union College Tax Committee, attempting to alter the source of funding of certain campus organizations and avoid an austerity budget, decided last Sunday to stop fundin~ the Men's Glee Club. The de\isjon was partially reversed the following day by !be .Student Forum. According to Stan Geberer, chairman of Student Tax, the funding of the Glee Club really falls with the college since the organization is cQllege oriented. In addition, 9eberer sU.ted that UColl Budget Analyzed Briefly By DAVID SCHMERTZ Each year~ the College mobilizes its forces to present a budget to the Trustees for the coming fiscal year. The essential components in this process are the Office of the Provost and the Planning and Priori ties Committee. The Provost and the Committee work together, and often with the President of the College to devise the financial budget. These governing bodies are basically those responsible for decision-making regarding the allocation of - revenue the College receives: They are the primary distributors of Union College income. As student tuition and fees increased sharply over the past six years, questions arose concerning the allocation of these funds. Since 1970, tuition at Union College has increased by . 75%, .from $2400 to $4200 in 1976-77; Cost of mainU.ining a TABLE 1 Revenues: Educational ancl General .

At Union ·College, there exists many areas whi~h dem·and central funding, and the tuition and fees paid by students is the major source of these funds. In 1976, students at Union College paid $7,778,208 in tuition and fees, or approximately 168% of the total revenue received by the College. - Endowment income, gifts and grants, federal subsidies and intercollegiate athletics provide the supplemental income .. included in total revenue. The income r~eived is pooled by the Committee and then allocated according to College priorities and expenses. Revenue from a specific source, such as tuition, is not useP to fund a specific source. · Below is a comparative statement of revenues and expenditures: The revenues received from tuition and fees include the tuition received from continuing education programs. Of the $7,768,988 paid in tuition, $1,038,841 is received . from continuing education. Auxiliary enterprises include revenue from residence balls ($981 1 oo0), the bookstore · ($981;000, Achilles Rink ($94,000), and the Dutch Hollow Pub ($72,000), etc. Total rev~nu~s amount ot $11,650,543. From that figure the College must allocate funds to effectively run the educational, adminis- trative, and extracurricular programs while also maintaining the College grounds. As can be seen on Table II fac1llty salaries and educational supplies (instructional and departmental research, Table I) devom the largest slice of the revenue received. Twenty-six percent of the revenues received are allocated towards faculty salaries and departmental expenses. 10.9% of the revenues are distributed towards general institutional, which simply consists of the news office, the alumni office, the public relations office and expenses incured by receptions and computer services, etc. . 10:2% cover the costs of maintaining the physi~l plant, 9.7% are allocated to continuing education and so on down the line. But a number -of figures are deceptive. For· example, though funding for graduate programs consists of 9.7 percent of the College Continued on Page 4 TABLE 11· ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES Faculty !!alaries & departmental expenses Gene~nstitutional Operation of physical plant Continuing education : Staff benefits (Blue Cross, etc.) Student aid Sponsored research Student services (infirmary, Registrar, etc.) Administrative salaries & expenses · Lib~ry Intercollegiate athletics Mandatory transfers %of total allocated revenue 26.6 10.9 10.2 9.7 9.0 8.6 6.2 4.8 4.6 3.9 3.5 2.7 Student Tax does not have the funds to support the organization without reverting to austerity plans. \Student Tax Committee, in a broader sense, wants to confront the college with the discrepancies that exist between policies of the Planning and Priorities Committee and the definition as to student ··activities an9 college activities,\ commented Geberer. He explained that the definition of a student a<:tivity is a group of students authorized by the college and student forum to exist. Importantly, all funding is student decided. A college activity, on the other hand, has a faculty advisor who controls the funding of the organization. Although the Student Tax Committee decided to halt funding of the Glee Club, the decision was reversed by the Student Forum at its Monday night meeting. Several motions were proposed: The decisive clause states, ''The Forum place this issue on the All-College Senate Agenda in order to form a sub-committee to explore other areas of funding while the Tax Committee continues to fund the Men's Glee .Club officially.\ The motion passed unanimously. According to Geberer, the Tax Committee will fund the Glee Club- as best it can, realizing that the organization provides entertainment to the campus. He states, however, that Student Tax may not be able to provide the fuli $10,000. Since Student Tax decides funding fot an organization during the year that it functions, Student Tax was unable, according to Geberer, to warn the Glee Club of a proposed funding halt. Hugh Allen Wilson, faculty director of the Glee Club, stated that he does not see an analogy between Mountebanks and Glee Club funding. He also said that the Glee Club's program is set one year in advance which necessitates stable funding. As part of a compromise by the Student Tax Committee, a sevenw person committee has been formed to study and propose to the college the feasibility that the Men's Glee Club be funded by some other sector of the college.

William Huntley by JIM DAVIS While rain fell on the Union. campus last Thursday evening, Jane Fondq;, noteq film star and political activist, addressed an audience of some 1000 persons in Memorial Chapel and compared them with the drops of rain in a downpour. Ms. Fonda, the second public fig~Jre to he p.resented 'by the Speakers Fo~um this term, spoke against \corpqrate tyranny\ by multi-natu>nal firms. which 1::. causing tl1e \eros.ion of Americans· freedom.\ ·fonda said, \It's easy to get frustrated and cynical. But if we join together, we can make all the difference in the world. We're like drops of rain hitting .a rock. Individually, we don't amount to much, hut together, we're a torrent that can change the contours ·of this country.\ Ms. Fonda's appearance at Union came on her first totu of college campuses si-nce ;the Vietnamese. War, during wlJich she was outspokenly opp()sed. .. Now there's no issue existing lik.e the war that will bring stud. ents together,\ Ms. Fonda said .in her speech. \But I don't think college people are apathetic.~· Continuing, Ms. Fonda said that contemporary youth have \a 'lot at stake\ determining their fu-ture. .. You shouldn't settle for not making commitments,\ she said. \It's horrible to be a student in the 1970's. This is an age of nothingness, but you have .t() fed angry. You're at the point of' life Huntley Named Union Provost . \ ' by ANDY OELBAlJM Last Monday, President Bonner .appointed Professor C. William Huntley to succeed WiUard F. Enteman as Provost of Union College. Huntley will serve as Provost from. January 1, 1978 to June 30, 1979. Western Reserve University. At the age of 28, he was then one of the youngest Deans in the country. Professor Huntrey has long been recognized throughout his career for his leadership in campus activities. After Dutch Elm disease struck Schenectady in the 1950's and decimated the E I'In populatien at Union's campus, Professor Huntley along with the Professor of Civil Engineering, H. Gilbert Harlow, played a leading tole in the restoration of the campus. As Provost, Huntley will become the second highest ranking official at Union and will be directly responsible for all educational departments within the college~ including the Offices of Dean of Faculty, Student Affa.irs ar'lli Graduate and Continuing. Education. l:n addition,· he · will have a major role in determining the school's budget as he will work directly with the President in setting procedures and will influence the control of tae school's financial resources.- Students' response to Huntley'\s . appointment was mixed, as s~rne students felt that altho.ugh Professot ~ u n t ley was experienced in se>ln e administrative fields, he l~cked the financial backgro\llnd nece~sary that they thougllt was important for effectivdy controlling the' College's fiturnces. Others, however, felt that his overall experience at 1 Union and participation in the C<>llege's activities would help stabilize its administration and keep it functioning effectively. Presid.ent ,llonner cited Huntley's career as professor and administrator at Union as the primary rea.son for his appointment as Provost, Bonnet believed that Huntley \will help to assure continued stability for the college because of Professor Huntley's long and c;listinguish~d connection With Union. We are delighted that he will join us because few .individuals are as well acquainted as he with the college and its needs.\ Student Forum Convenes Professor Huntley said that he was not stuprised at this appointment~ because he said, \somebody's got to do it.\ Huntley has heen a member of Uniotfs faculty .since 19~7 when he was apponted the Dean of the College and Professor of Psychology. Me later resigned his position as Dean in 1964 when the responsibilities as Dean began to interfere with the duties as a psychology . professor. Upon resigning as Dean, however, Huntley was named Chairman of the Psychology Department, a position which he has held through this current year. Professor Huntley, who is from Schene!!tady; began his higher education at Union College, where he graduated in 1934. He received his M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, while serving as a Psychology Instructor at both Harvard and Radcliffe. He left Harvard in 1941 to become Dean of Students at Case INSIDE Concordy Page 1-2, 7 .. 3 The postponed Forum meeting of Nov. 14 was brought to order at 10 p.m. Nov. 15. The first order of business was the removal fr.om the minutes of tlte item referring to tlte censure of Andrew Koblenz. The censure of Koblertz- did not in fact occur. The minutes we\~ then approved. The first itein of discussion was the proposal of the last meeting that a subcommittee of the Senate be S(!t up to investigate Glee Club Funding. Representatives from the Planning and Priorities Committee wanted to know what points the Forum was objecting to in \The Final Report of the Joint Planning and Priorities - Student Forum Sub-Committee on the Funding of Student Activities.. release<!. during February 1976. Points Were brought up that the For_um wouldn't accept the limited definition of a student activity in the report, which stated that a student activity is one which is funded by student tax and where all decisions are made by students; it was mentioned that this is a pretty simple definition and does not take into effect the degree td which the activity might be related to academic affairs. Also some of the criteria to determine eligibility for college funding were questioned. The consensus of the forum was that Student Senators will go to the four division meetings on Tuesday so that faculty senators can be infurmed of the issues before· next Tuesday's Senate meeting. The next item revolved around the Middle States Evaluation and the 1976 Master Plan of Union College. Bill Jenkins of P&P provided his committee's views. The Master Plan, written by P&P is required every 4 years by the N.Y. State Regents with yearly revision, and is merely approved as general policy, .not binding, and subject to revisions and changes. The suggestion was made ;,tnd app-roved that the Student Forum split up into small groups a'nd each gather information and student opinions about the Master Plan. The issue of a change in the grading system was then br9ugbt up and the folio wing motion was made: that the election committee be charged with conducting a pc;>il for the purpose of finding student sentiment as to the possibility of changing the grade point system. This · will take place early next term after various modes of communiCation outlining the pros and cons of the change Jtre complete~ operation of soda machines, sub and sandwich selling and other marathon type events. Loolc for more later. The abolition of dogs frotn the library was discussed in a.<ld.ition to curtailing smoking at certain times and in certain places. Another suggestion about locking the back dQot between the all- night study and the main library during regular hours as a sec-urity measure is being examine<.l f <lf reasonability and legality. Then, agreeing that the ho1.1r was late and something had- been accomplished, the meeting was adjourned at 11:20 p.m. where you can shape what your future will he,\ Large corporations are not responsibl~ to the individual, Ms, Fonda said. lnstead of heing primarily concerned with the quality of their products and the livelihood of their employees. these firms have profits as their overriding concern, \Anonymous heads of corporations, who aren't elected, determine our future.\ Ms. Fonda said. \They decide our foreign policy. the quality of our food, and the quality of our environment. What right do they have to do this?\ In additi<Jn to having little concern for individuals' welfare, Ms. Fonda also said that multi- national corporations feel no obligation to the United States. \If companies feel they're being taxed too ll.ighly here, they'll go abroad at the drop df a hat. ln order to keep big businesses here, the. federal government allows them to pay far less in taxes than they are req:uired to by law. \And even so, many corporations are moving their operations -outside of the u.s. to other countries where they can pay lower taxes and pay their workers less. In the end, it's the common person who's most hurt by this because they're the ones who are losing jobs.\ · As further evidence of corporatr()n .. s negligence . for individuals' welfare, Ms. Fonda noted that working conditions and manufacturing quality in the U.S. are j)oth shockingly poor. \Each year, about 100,000 people die from occupational diseases,\ she said. •'Another 15,000 die from industrial accidents and 30,000 die from product-related accidents.\ Ms. Foll.da said that tod'ay's students seem complacent because they've ''become afraid to feel, to commit themselves. You'll be graduating into 15-20 percent unemployment. So it's understandable that people are afraid to make their feelings known because if they do they'll be out of work.\ On the other hand, Ms. Fonda said, \it's time democratic rights be extended to the economy. You have to have the courage to do something. Workers have to demand input into how thililgs are run.\ To revamp the way corporations operate, Ms. Fonda said, those being oppressed have to present concrete visions and Continued on Page 7 Distorty Page 3-6 Joe Cappuccio and Matt Nagorsky have been elected to ' succeed Danny Wojnilower as . editors-in-chief for the winter . and ~pdn.g terms~ The Ad* Hoc Committee on fund Raisirtg gave a report about possible auxiliary sources of student funding.

I I . ' Page2 Experience Well, I guess I've made it. With next Wednesday·~ issue of Concordiensis, my tenure as editor-in~chief come> to a dose. Looking back over these past two terms as a whole, they seem to have llown by, but when I consider ea.ch week as a separate entity, vis1ons of the mental anguish 'I ha\'e constantly battled reappeal' to haunt me. At the very least, being editor-in-chief has been an experience; an experience more valuable t·han any course J could ever take at Union an.d will probably be the most wc>rthwhile par·t of rny entire \education\ during my four years here. As the end of last winter term was approaching and I sat in the Concordy office metiwlously pondering over the Ia yo lit of the sports pages (that's right, 'I was sports editor last winter), I \\.a~ suddenly approached by an ex-editor wh(,) said I should consider rhe editorship. My first thought was their suggestion was in pure jest but. looking back, obvious!~· it wasn't. An election was held and, after numerous people were to serve as co-editor with me, I found myself the editor-in-chief-nervou~ .. scared, and alone. 1 realize that talk of the paper lolding and he shouldn't be editor, he's only a freshman. etc. may have been valid at this time but this only proved to spur me on to beat the odds against inc. Well. I've come through. a little weary-eyed and exhausted but tore:.:er thankful for having been given the chance. \Vhether or not I have been successful ot not is a question for you to ponder for, in my mind, I have done the job and done it. well At first, i simply could not fathom how much work and time was involved but I learned rather 4 uickly as d1d my totally irregular sleep pattern. Union College \problems\ seemed to reachthe top of the roller coaster just as .J became editor, remained at the top much ionger than seemed possible, and now, as my editorship ends, has begun to descend. Week after week, new issues and the discussion of these issues appeared . in Concordy: the suspension and reinstation of the hockey coach, the resignation of the Admissions Director, thd!Trustees meeting three weeks in a row to discuss the \current campus controversies,\ the housing \burn leaving NESCAC and voting confidence in the President, the faculty voting no confidence in the President, the hiring of a new Athletic Director, the Provost leaving, the Dean of Students being fired, the Student Forum meeting with three hundred students present and the decision to have a Presidential Review. Other .. minor\ items were the Gen. Ed. and lEF proposals, columnist Jack Anderson, Senator Dick Clark, Watergate sleuth Carl Bernstein, and actress Jane Fonda speaking at Union and more. Concordy attempted to take each situation seriously and then presf?nt it as objectively as possible. At times we failed but, looking at the overall picture, we have done a damn good job. At the outset, I set goals for myself and I nave done my best to fulfill them. Thirty-five to forty hours weekly spent on Coilcordy have been aimed at the attainment of these goals {unfortunately, they have made academics a spare time affair in my mind but not in my professors' mind). As time passed, I realized that I couldn't take everything personally (as I did at first), but that taking Concordy seriously was of utmost importance. Two questions were constantly asked of me: I) Why are you doing it? and 2) How c;lo you keep going? My answers also became constant: 1) Concordy .is vital t:o the campus and someone has to do it and 2) rota! .. internal gratification because it rarely comes from anywhere else: This internal gratification is a trait that also had to be & part of each and every member of the staff. No matter what internal strife has existed. they've all been great and it is now time that they receive the recognition so long overdue. So, finally, my personal thank~ go to the following people who stuck out two terms with me: Ben Green. for sticking by my s1de come hell or high water; Joe Cappuccio. the only person other than myself who really knows what it's l1ke to be working on Concordy at 6 a.m. on a Wednesdav morning and for making the paper look good even when it seemed impossible; Matt Nagorsky and Andy Mitchell for always being able to tome up with news stories. editonaJs, or whatever and for taking all my abuse; Sara Simmons for always helping out in the clutch and being a faithfu.l printer goer; Marty Dolan and Debbie Poletto for never complaining and always getting, the sports pages done and done well; Jon Flescher for sticking out two terms as .photo editor when he didn't really have the time; Marla Lux for. simply being a super business manager and keeping Concordy. monetarily above water; Fern Flomenhaft for sticking out two terrns as culture editor when she really wasn•t into it; Lester Weiss for being the entire art staff; Linda Straube and Cindy Vanina for spending some late hours doing layout which allowed Joe and me ro get any sleep at all; and anyone else who worked for this paper at any point during the last ·two terms. I'd also like to thank the freshmen that joined Concordy at the outset of the term: Jim Davis, Andy Oelbaum, Ron Scaccia, Roslyn Stone, and Mitch Wolin. Remember these names, they may be Union's future leaders. Unfortunately, Concordy did have to scrounge for ''staffers\ at times and this is simply not the way it ·should be with any college newspaper. I would hope that in the future, many more people will choose to get involved. Also, members of this community, when criticizing Concordy, simply do not do it constructively. This also pertains to when we have been applauded. Rather than say something is either good or bad, wouldn't it be better to say why it was good or bad. This could only serve to make Concordiensis an even better newspaper in the future. It's always said that the best is saved for last and thus I have saved the following notes of gratefulness for: my roommates and true friends who somehow were able to put up with me and stood behind me and were always willing and able to help out. Jon and Alan, it has been appreciated; and lastly, my deepest thanks to one fantastic individual who, through her pat·ience, help, care, and willingness to listen at any time of day or night. literally kept me going throughout my trials and tribulations. Donna, thank you, for if not for you, I surely wouldn't have made it to writing this editorial.

Term in Review We would Hke yott reading to be clear that the views and perceptions expressed here weekly over both our names, are uniquely ·our own. We both have written because our sense of student sentiment was that the student trustees ought to be more visible to those who have elected them. This column has developed into the primary mechanism for this increased communication. We feel it has been valuable in this regard and will become more so over time. Unfortunately; thefe has been some confusion concerning how completely we speak for t-he rest of the government leadership. As trustees our view covers the width and breadth of the college and so we try to address ourselves mainly to matters of institutional scope in this column. The Student Forum is very important to us (we are members) but in addition, we are attenipting to bring to your attention issues which extend beyond exclusive student jurisdiction a.nd which we are charged to deal with. This week then, in our characteristically sweeping style, we would like to ·place in context some of the fast stream of issues which have poured by the college this term. They have of course been manifold in their a.ppearances. Most weeks ha·ve seen similar questions being raised about the- administration of the college. The departure ot the Provost and the Dean of Students seems to reveal just how chaotic the climate here was. The President ventured out into the community via WR UC and was greeted with a series of questions whose hostility was barely disguised. Students attended two open Student Forum meetings to decide upon appropriate action .in the midst of .their unhappiness. Letters e\pressiilg individual concern were called for as the best answer. There were well over .300 letters all but a very few of which called for at least a Presidential Review. These drew from the Trustees two highly significant responses. The first of which was the serious attitude a majority of the trustees brought to bear on the letters. l'his extended to many replies that the Chairman and Vice-Chairman made to individual letters. Sitting on the board we were doubly impressed by the· moral vigor and care that the vast majority of the letters reflected and the fact that the Trustees felt these qualities warranted their concerted attention and response. T'he other response of course \\as the intensely sought Presidential Review. We now wait until Decemba 7th tu find out ex!!ctly what form this review will take. l·n the meantim~ it :.ecm:-. clear that events are following a course which will kad to a ~olutiun to many of the confusions which have shrouded thi~ ~.:ollege. ' '\ l A second less spectaculer thrust which is only beginning to take shape now is the Middle States Association accredttatil>n reviev.. No major steps have been taken yet. The job lie!> in the province of the Planning and Priorities Committee. They arc charged with coordinating the operation. The college is charged with the task of generating a self-~tud} . The study will include a description of the mission the collt:gc ha-.. pursued and the strateg~s it ha!> employed along the wa}. It will then do the ,same for the next ten~year stretch. detailing ho\.\ we ought to achieve the goals we chart for ourselves. Every member of this commumty ought to give this committee\ deliberations the closest scrutiny. Questions concerning Arts to Engineering will be faced and students mmt be aware of the proceedings. Thirdly 'import_ant questions regarding the living condttiom we have here and the physical appearance of the college are coming to the forefront. The legacy of spring term '77 is still with us. It ts simply going to have to occur to more students that this is ver~ much our college and anything that contributes to inordinate wear and tear on it is absolutely unacceptable. Most of the campus is aware of how inadequate the furniture in the dorms is. It is bad t<> a. certain extent because it is cheap and is not getting replaced often enough. That is happening largely bec~use the abuse the furniture (and most of the physical plant) has- taken has been extensive and intolerable. Furthermore, it is not going to get better until the conditions which produce its rapid deterioration improve. These include more strident measures of policing ourselves. By far the rnost effective way to combat this · problem though. is for each student to be rnore conscious about what is going on. This means that, like the overwhelming. majority of students, we must all be responsible in our own actions, and further we should not hesitate to complain to, and about, other students who are behaving destructively. Finally, many issues are revolving around a ·single axis governance. The Presidential Advisory Board is presently preparing to disc\,lss the entire governance situation. The President is holding a general faculty meeting to review present structures. There is also the Thorbern Report which scans several aspects of our political process. Most importantly the Trustees have at the repeated request of the President agreed to review the governance system. They have publically said they would welcome any proposals the PAB might offer for consideration. We believe the structure we operate with now has served us well. It is like all things capable of being adjusted for the better, and perhaps a study of needed improvements at this time ~.:an b .. helpful; however, fundamentally the system remains strong and healthy. Especially in a year such as the last one, which saw so much turmoil, it yielded a number of very notable successes. As the debate over governance unfolds it might be well for all of us to be prepared to disentangle some extr&ordinary circumstances that appeared in close proximity to this structure of governance from the structures themselves. It would he a shame to lose a structure which offers the opportunitie& that ours does due to some unfortunate coincidences. Andy Koblenz, Student Trustee Brian O'Toole, Student Trustee

Delta Phi Celebration by TED DUNN One hundred and fifty years ago, on a crisp November night, nine young men huddled closely against the evening chill underneath the old covered bridge that spanned the rambling Mohawk between Scotia and Schenectady. The men spoke in _, J >I 'l ! '1 \'.' low voices about starting a group for study and. friendship, with ties that would bind them for life. The results of this meeting were soon apparent, for on November 17, 1827, these students formed the Delta Phi Fraternity in North Hall on the Union College campus in Schenectady, New York. Delta Phi was the third college social fraternity founded in the United States. The two groups preceding Delta Phi on the Union campus, Kappa Alpha and Sigma Phi, were founded in 1825 . and 1827 respectively. The three form the legendary U1;1ion Triad. Probably; each of these three groups, the first college social ftaternities, decided that, by forming a society, they could better share the pearls of wisdom they were picking up on and about the Union campus. Just six. years after its founding, trouble began to break for the fraternal groups. The word .. secret\ seemed to hold an evil connotation for those who did have now come one hundred ana fifty years to the present, with the third of the famous Union Triad celebrating its sesquicentennial anniversary and still existing as the oldest continuous social fraternity in America. not belong,. and many talse charges of riotous living were leveled at these organizations. Eliphalet N ott, president of Union, was persuaded that these new societies with their \dire\ secrets and passwords, meeting in graveyards, under bridges, and in other queer places were a threat Since it has been one hundred to higher education. Tile faculty and fifty years since its founding, and administration at Union put Delta Phi and its National a ban on fraternities and societies organization have planned a an4, as the story goes, Kappa celebration, here on the Union Alpha and Sigma Phi took off campus, On the Weekend of their badges and went November 18, 19, and 20.

(Ms.) Buchanan will participate in a worksllop session at 3:30 p.m. Friday in the Humanities Faculty L<Junge. Humanities Building. She will read and discuss her W()rks at 8 p.m. in Strauss Lotinge, Carnegie Hall. The public is invited free of charge. Buchanan is the author of Maiden, which drew highly favorable reviews from the New York Times and Washington Post and other publications when it ' was publishe<l in 1972. In Maide11, Buchanan tells the poignant st()ry of a 30-year-old virgin who joins a Los Angeles swinging singles club in search of a mate. ..Both the style and the subject called up a comparison with Joan Didion's Play It As It Lays and Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, but Buchanan's command of narrative directness and her strong sense of story made this the premier novel of that fortuitous trilogy,\ the Encyclopedia Britannica's 1973 Yearbook said. Buchanan, whose novel-in- progress is entitled Cock Walk lit Exile has had her essays and reviews published by Newsweek, Oui Magazine, The New York Times, the Washington Post Book Review, Transatlantic Review and other publications. She is the author of the play \cabrona and has written monologues for Lily Tomlin's television and Broadway appearanc.es.

She has worked across the nation, taking jobs in places like Kalamazoo, Michigan as well al!l New York City. Her steady occupation is that of resident lighting designer at a production group in Mineola on Long Island, a post which gives ll.er tile freedom to take jobs in places like Union College. Her .appointment here was initiated by a. m~eting between Ms. Giordano and Charles Steckler; Union's .resident set designer and ·profe~sor of stagecraft, whom Ms. Giordano ha:s the highest respect for along with the ininiit!lble Barry Smith. Virginia bas enjoyed working with Directo-r Smith and thinks of him as not 'being a · \literary director\ where ~he director thinks. in terms of the script and n9thing ¢lse, h\lt rather as a director with a theatrica.l concept in mind for the production. One thing which she is dissatisfied with in coming here is the housing. She is living in the Richmond Dormitory and .although sl'te feels that tlte kids are ••wonderful and would be the same anywhere'', dormitory life is \something that 1 once n~ded but now only Interferes with my work. If another college contacted m~ and offete.d me the oppotttJ:nity to light my favorite . show and offered me lhese type of living quarters to go along with it, l'd have to turn them down:· Other than this, Ms. Giordano is quite pleased with the theatrical activities on campus. Of the Mountebanks, she says: \it's a hard working organization which shoulders too much work on too few people. · It needs the involvement of more people willing to work in order to function properly.\ The quality of the acting is ••exceptional for a school where there is no set core of theatre majors.\ She has enjoyed doing \Salesman\ because of the material and Director· Smith, and enjoyed \Reardon\ because of Ms. Whiting. However. Ms. Giordano does feel that \Reardon\ is a \sexist play which portrays three women in ~uch a flat, two- dimensional way; that they come across as three neurotic bitches in powerful positions who don't know what ta do with themselves. I don't like the play because it is poorly written.\ She does admire the college's choice to ''involve more women :students\ and that it is a \fainnillded approach but 'Reardon' was a poor vehicle\. Virginia Giordano is a woman with strong views on What she doe:s and she feels that her profession is one suitable to women for various reasons. She enjoys h~r wClrk, for which she trained at Adelphi University and the University of Arizona, and advises pr&spective lighting designers to get the college background before jumping into the field. Her work will be on di~play the next two weekends in the Nott Memcrial, and to miss it would be to refuse the work of a fine artist and an equally fine personality.

No . doubt you w~re made to read the play at one or another points in your high school years and you learneq that it was a play about false values and the falling through of · the American Dream for Willie Loman (low man)~ If you tead The Crucible instead, at least you have seen a production of the play .. At any rate, you know what is going to happen. so why should you _go? Perhaps you will feel better about going when you hear that instead. of Death of a Salesman, you will be seeing The biside of His HeacJ, The Inside of His Head was Arthur Miller's original title for the play, and this prodQction is following the playwr-ight's intentions for the play as closely as possible. Miller thought that he would _like the set to be a gjant head that opened, and inside the head the action would take place. The original set design by Jo Mielziner was of a house, cut with '' ... the frame outline of the house forming an open skeleton.\ The house then becomes Willie Loman's head, Qpen for the audience's view of Willie's thoqght processes. 1'he set designed by Charles Steckler .is very Close to the Mielziner design, with acute ~alism in certain areas of t,he stage. Arthur Miller's concept of the play was that It was the inside of a man's head, that it Was the processes of his thoughts. Miller believed that in the Salesman's mind there is no \next'' but rather a simultaneous exist¢ilce of past and present. Director Barry Smith says the production of the play is geared to c4pture tbese senses. The lighting design by guest artist, Virginia Giordano, the music and sound by Emory Waters, tbc;: costumes by guest (l'esigner Donna· Meyer, the set design and direction. ate all working tQ express Miller's desire for his play. This combination of skills, talents and efforts is very apparent in the play.. l \only\ could see the tech rehearsal·befm:e this. article had to be written and most thought it unfo11unate that I had to see· that rehearsal and not the polished dress rehearsal. I found th.js rehearsal very interesting and impressive because I was able to see many people in action whose major work has been done before the dr.ess Fehearsals. The lights and the music and sound wo.tked effectively. to show this concurrence of past and present, of past actions and, guilt and present words. A slight chan.ge of ligQt, and Willie's world slipped into the .past, another ·lighting change and Willie was in another past. The lighting wotk.s so well in this production, that as a character speaks in one lighting, the audience is aware that the dark areas of the stage ate filled with pasts. The sound compliments the lighting so that although there are distinctions between pasts and present, the viewer becomes as confused as Willie as to which is the more real. The success of the technical .. effects of the play (which do not appear to be an intrusion but rather an extra .arm of the action) does not fill any lack in the acting. The acting is powerful and convincing. George Siletsky as Good News, along with Willie asks questions filled with productions by the New York such pain and wonder that you City Ba.llet, New York City Opera sense that those, same answers and the N.Y.

These are community agencies here in Schenectady that try to meet the needs ofthe poor. The Union CoUege community has been invited to .aid these agencies in their attempts to decrease hunger and malnutrition in Schenectady. As in past years the Newman Campus Ministry is sponsoring a Thanksgiving Food Drive. For the next two weeks,. Nov. 7-21, students will be collecting for both the Schenectady Inner City Ministry and the People's Advisory Service who distribute directly to the needy of Schenectady. Boxes for non- perishable food items will be placed on each floor of each dorm,. fraternity, and sorority, and in other campus buildings. Money donations can be given to Lorraine Marra, Student Activities Office or Sister Pat Parachini, Office of Career Resources. Last year's drive was In The Mood For Something Different?

The cooperation of the campus community in the past has been greatly appreciated and even greater participation is urged for this year. Union students may not be aware of the conditions which necessitated the formation of these organizations. We are all familiar with tl).e \hunger crisis\ situation in many underdeveloped third world countries. But there are sections of the United States, even in larger cities, where people suffer similar hardships with regard to hunger and malnutrition. It is estimated that 400 million Americans s.uffer from malnutrition bordering on famine. These deplorable conditions persist even though great sums of money (over $4 billion a year) are spent on food stamps und~r a congressional mandate to give the eligible needy .. an opportunity te> obtain a nutritiopally adequate diet'\ In June of 1974 it was estimated that only 14.1 million of the 37 milliop eligible poor were receivlng food stamps. Crit~cs say that this serious problem .persists because of failure on the part of both the Department of Agriculture and local- officials who ate responsible for the distrib11tion of food stamps. So hunger remains a reality for rna~ Americans. 1he poor and elderly are among its victims~ It is the children, however, who suffer most. Studies have shown that young cnua.ren wno a.re malnourished suffer from permanent retarded brain development. The hunger crisis reaches right here into Schenectady. SCAP, the Schenectady Community Actiol! Program gives the following causes for the situation: inflation (food prices are up while Welfare budgets don't compensate for the rise, unemployment (unemploy- ment insurance is not enough to feed a family), high c_ase load, too _ much red tape and lack of adequate fUnding for the SICM Emergency Food Program. SICM is the Schenectady Inner City Ministry. Its members'hip represents 2.5 local churches. Its covenant states that one purpose of the organization is to \ ... relate resources of the churches to the human needs of the city ... \ Its many and varied programs include the Housing Task force and the Youth Task Force. One of its most i*\portant agencies is the Emergency Food PrograJJ:l which serves I, at least 13,000 people a year ~t of its store at the First United M. e. thodist Church.. ~e pie. who are referred to th1s program receive two days .~ od for themselves and· their families once a mo11th.

' CONCORDIENSJS, November 9, 1977 5port5 Flying Dutchmen Rout Holy Cross by DANNY WOJNILOWER For the first time since last year's disheartening loss to the Warriors of Merrimack, 6-4, in the finals of the ECAC Division U playoffs, the Union College Dutchmen bit the ice of Achilles Rink to battle an ()pponent rather than themsel:yes. The Dutchmen, still in Division II, were pitted against the less the same llS it was at the elld of last season, boasts 30 goal scorers Kip Churchill and Donnie Marshall and All~American defenseman Jack Rankin. Thf;Se three juniors are the Union tri~ captains. Coach Ned Harkness sent his team to the ice, thus beginning his quest for yet another title to add to championships already One of .. junior Steve Baker's 28 saves Saturday night Crusaders of Holy Cross registered at R.,P .I. and Cornell. University in a fund raising affair The team started , off with the for Block .

Rough play marked the opening m~nutes and alii a restdt, Unio11 gained its first power play barely two minutes into the game. The potent Garnet power play saw .Judd, sophol!lore Chuck Pappas and Hinterberger on the front line and Crawford and Churchill on the poi11ts. Although the puck was situated inside the Holy Cross blue line for much of the two minutes, U 11ion failed to tingle tile twines. Goalie Baker's first real test occurrec:l when he stop.ped Crusader Pete Brennan ona semi- breakaway. Shortly after,. junior Kevin Kardos proved up to his old triclcs, drawing a tripping penalty and giving. Union another man advantage situation. This power play featured Gamet pressure thwarted again and again by Crusader ,goalte:nder P .J'. Costello. Finally, at 8:32, the Dutchmen were able to ripple the cords. Sophomore Doug Feasby rushed tile length of the ice and centered for Marshall who tipped it in. Memories of lst year were then brought back a& the crowd began chanting .. sieve, sieve.\ The remainder of the period saw much aggressive play by the Dutchmen. This resulted in power plays for Holy Cross but, due to excellent goaltending by Baker and stalwart penalty killing led by Kardos the magtctan, .the scoreb()ard read Union 1 -Holy Cross () at the end of the opening period. The Garnet started the second period a man down and Baker proved up to the task, making a Soccer Finishes 4-7 .. 1 Winding.up their season at 4-7- 1, Union•s unpredictable hooters lost to Binghamton 2-0 this week in their final two sames After coming off their best game of the season at Middlebury, this year's \upset\ Ontchmen prepared for another strong opponent at Binghamton State, Wed., Nov. 2. Binghamton, last year;s . upstate New York ECAC champs, provided Union with an opportunity to keep their chances alive for a .500 season. This was not to be, however, as Binghamton rallied for 2 second half goals to repel Union's best offensive attack all year. No goals were scored in the first half, but Union had S or 6 near misses. Paul Marvin outraced two defenders, and his breakaway shot missed by inches. Offensive standout Peter Handy skyed to head a cross from teammate Martini only to have it snared by a diving goalie. Bob Hogan's point blank head appeared over the goalie, but once again it was grabbed. Keith (end~line) Miller's 2 on I break with Martini ended with a pass inches from connecting. Union clearly dominated, especially after Doug Crawford's sprawling save of a pena.Jty kick by all~American Jose Joiste. Binghamton looked more alive in the second half, but Union still managed to press. Finally Binghamton took the lead 1-o with a shot that Crawford _ -·\ get a hand on, but it trickled ·into the net. With 10 minutes to go Joiste hit a rocket 20 yarder into the lower right corner t<i ice the game for Binghamton.· Outstanding defensive work was turned in by senior Mike Smith who looked unbeatable and contriDuted to the attac~ with accurate passing. JV coach Parker Antill to()k over for Coach Magee the final two practice days, as Magee was suffering from a kidney stone that occurred after the Binghamton loss. Union took the field on Sat'Urday (which was a dirt pile disgrace especially When compared to the carpets played on .at Middlebury and Binghamton recently) determined to end the season with a win against the Merchant Marines from Kings Point. The game was rough from the start and Union held the upper hand getting away 3 shots in the first 5 minutes. Co-captain Mike Smith, playing with a bruised foot and shoulder, hit a long direct kick into the .penalty area which Paul Marvin headed off a defender to junior forward Jamie Hilton who one-timed the ball to Petet Martini. Martini had a wide open net and netted Union into a: 1-0 lead. With only 10 minutes gone in the game the 1-o lead looked as though it would growl. However, in less than one minute Kings Point tied the game on ·a fast break. Then the. U n'ion .co-captain cont. . .• \ piay that was a fitting way to end their soccer days at Union, as Smith hit a 45~ yard chip past the Kings Point defense, and an oncoming Martini volley kicked the ball before it hit the ground, .into the upper !eft hand corner of the net past a shocked goalie. Coach Boll Magee str~ssed short passing and patience at halftime a!ld Union seemed to do just tbat, opening the second half. Kings Point, on one of their only scoring opportunities l)f the half put in a cross and the score remained at 2~2 going in to overtime, The 2() minutes ofovertime was frustratiilg to watch since Union clearly dcminated but couldn't score. Peter Handy, playing one of his best games of the year (his second ·ltalf goal was disallowed oecause of a hand ball) almost single-hancedly beat 3 defenders on a breakaway only tc be thwarted on the 18 yard line. Hilton, Martini, and slick-footed Pa.ul Marvin all worked for chances t>ut it was to no avail. Soccer 1977 at Union was as frustrating all year Ioag as the final overtime periOds. The big games, the ones Union was .expected tc lose, were tu.rned into victories. Easy victories of years past becatne this year's downfalls. 1978 lo1>ks · brighter.

Backs HoJan, Miller, Guilfoyle, M!llpeter, Decker; aild freshman Continued Qll Page l3 brilliant skate save on Crusader Bob Shea. At this point Union began to roll,. as they would amass. 26 sb.ots on go~tl and five scores during tb,e middle stanza; Fir$t, Feasby rushed the length of the ice and was stopped by Ce>SteUo. This was foiQwed by .a hard Pappas wrist shot, a tip in attempt by junior Mark Jenkin~ and another Pappas wrist shot. The result of this massive press!lre was a face-off to the left of the goal. Then, With one quick snap of the wrist, Churchill scored Union's second goal of the game at 3:27, winning the draw ~nd beatin.g the beleagured goaltender. A brief Holy Cross attack was srpothered by junior Dean Mathewson as be fell on the puck in front of the Union cage and then the Dutchmen regained the offensive. With 1 e:21 remaining, the Crusaders switched goalies and with this,- the roof fell in upon them. With both .teams skating at five a side, junior Mike O'Connell !!Wept around the defense, and ~fter his original shot was stopped, flipped the rebound into the net. Junior Brian Bagley r-eceived an assist on Union's third goal at 9:55. Less than a minute later, Churchil.l took a Hinterberger pass an:d skated in alone. A desperation dive by a Crusader defenseman pulled him down and then the defenseman. goalie, Churchill...and the puck all entered the goal. Churchill's second goal at 10:53 put Union ahead 4-0 and it proved to be the winning tally. Judd, as well as Hinterberger, received an assist on the play. The fifth goal came with Union shorthanded. With Crawford paying a two minute price for his hard hitting, sophomore left wing Dean Willers broke down ice with Kardos on his right and, after the defenseman committed himself, petfectly placed a shot over goalie Stewart's right shoulder at 14:53. Shooting practice continued fer the Dutchmen and, as a result, got their sixth goal at 18:45. David Currie passed to Rankin who connected with Feasby on a beautiful play. The sophomore centerman then deked around the goaltender and flipped the rubber disc into the open net. The end result no longer in ~t.J~. '·'·~ doubt, the Dutchmen came out for the third period . .and started off in the same fashion they h4d ended the second. Churchill almos~ registered a hat trick in the .first minute and then Union got its seventh goal at 5:04. Judd sent Churchill up ice on a. two-on~ one with Hinterberger on his left. A perfect pass left tbe juniar left wing with the simple task of steering the puck in the net. At this point, the Garnet began to let. up and only the acr()batics of goalie Baker kept Holy Cross at Bay. Finally, at 6:58, Crusader Bob Sltea tipped in a shot for their first score. The next ten minutes featured sloppy play on both sides with Union coming close twice. A Bagley slapshot from the right point hit both posts ... and bounced out. Later, th.e combination of sophomore Mark Haley, Kardos and Willers. had the puck in front of a virtually open cage· but failed to put it in. Throughout this time an obviously annoyed Coach Harkness could be heard bellowing \clreck check\as the play shifted toward the Union zone. The result was a second Crusader goal tallied by Mike Pinho at 16:04 after a defensive mistake. This sloppiness .ended momentarily When, at 17:02, the Garnet tallied for the final time as Rankin slapped home a rolling disc which emerged from a scramble in front. Marshall and Feasby received assists on this goal, Union's eighth. Before the games conclusion Holy Cross managed one more score, this coming with a two man advantage and 30 seconds to play. This goal by Jerry Curly made the final score Union 8~Holy Cross -3. The Dutchmen outshot their opf!onents 54 to 31, thus proving that the potent offense of last year once again exists. The defense, still the same, is led by the shot blocking of Rankin, the hard hitting of Crawford and the steady play of Mathewson and junior Bernie Kaminsky. When lapses oc;:cur, as they inevitably do, goaltender 8aker exists as. a last resort to thwart opponents. All in all it is fair to say, the Union College skating Dutchmen are back.

Each year the balls, songs, jerseys, and spirit are passed on by those who have played; ~t is th<e new veterans who are left to keep the rugby tradition alive- Such a task is not accomplished without leadership and this season Union was gifted with three sp-ecial people; three individuals witllout whose efforts Union Rugby would be not. They are captain Gienn Myers, treasurer Cliff Cohen, and match- secretary Burt Slavin.

Despite the rugby season coming to an end, you may still see the players working out on library field. No,. they are not beginning practice for the Spring season; they are preparing for the grue.ling Albany Sevens Tournament. This is a one day, double elimination tourney which draws many top-notched clubs from New York and Massachusetts. What makes it grueling is not only the amount of games you m11st play to do well, but the fact that seven players must cover the territory usually accustomed to fifteen. Just last year a fired-up Union squad won five of seven matches before bowing to the Albany semi- professional Knickerbocker Club in the finals. This was quite a surprise to all but this year the squad has the potential and desire to go all the way!

The game started quickly with much good play at the net by Sheila O'Donnell, Jill Thomson and Liz Yager, and strong defense and setting by Audrey Stein, Cathy Reals, and Amy Juchatz. The play was exciting and close, as in the last time Union played Williams, but as close as it was, a much-improved Williams (record 15-2) began to chip away at Union with some expertly placed spikes. The match was completed m two ,games, with Williams the victor at lS-10, 15-4. Russell Sage and Williams fought it out next as Union watched, ·and as Russell Sage defeated Williams in a very close and spirited match, the Union women warmed up their skills and their psyches in preparation for their biggest opponents (with their lanky 6'4\ spiker) of their season. Union had resolved to vanquish their volleyball villain,s, and so took the court with anticipation. The Sage team stayed very cool as the two teams played some excellent volleyball, but Union. had the edge and momentum was flowing as they took the first gatne 15-7. Sage was even more determined to raise their winning record in the next game as they won it 15-3. In the third game it appeared to be an easy and long-sought after victory for Uniofi as they had the Sage girls down ll-2. Union's high hopes were suddenly btougltt to a crash landing as a psyched Sage server powered over hard ~rve after hard serve. This got the steam ·going on Sage's side, and they snatched a tasty and tangible win from the hands of tbe Union women · 15-11. Although all of the matches which Union has played and will play have had equal and high importance to the team, games against Sage are always filled with the intense wish to play the best volleyball possible and the su·preme desire to win ~ and therefore spirits were a ·bit dampened amongst the Union team. The tournament Friday was held at Oneonta, and seven teams were entered. It was Union's wish to meet Sage again here, but that wish was not to be fulfilled. The 1J Ilion women faced off against their frequent foes from Siena, and earned their first shutout of the season as they beat Siena 15- S, 15-0. Union's serving entitled them to the shutout as Cathy P.eals and ':;heila O'Donnell impolitely scored all of Union's points against their hapless opponents. (The promise of a free meal from .the coach may have been incentive!) The next match was against the hosts of the tourney, Oneonta. th.ey did not look very threate11ing in their previou~ game, and Union underrated them a bit as it was a hard fought contest containing some of the . best play of the day unfortunately with U Iiion coming out the loser in the match. There was fine play throughoUt by Audrey Stein, Cathy Reals, Amy Juchatz, an<l Sheila O'DonneU, as Liz Yager and Jill Thomson (incredible saves!) hustled at the utmost to show what Union is made of.

Union took this <>he handily in two games, happily tucking anotfter victory under their belts. Thoe reason for such glee was that Union now had an excellent chan«:e at making the State Tournament by defeating just one more team, New Paltz, and the women were ready to do this. New Palt:z was in the same position as UJ;tion, so it was to prove a grueling and punishing match. Union saw that the New Paltz team was having trouble in their games, so they decided to try to capitalize on this and make their coach very, very satisfied. What Union didn't take into account was that the echoing, hot, and stuffy long hours in the gym were taking their toll on Union's endurance amd were quickly creating exha1.1sted players who could. not expect to play at their usual best. Tile games against New Paltz were tough, yet Union had control of the situation until New Paltz battled back to take the first very dose game 17-15. Union's steam quickly ran out after this fatiguing game as did their spirit, and they fell to their ever.;lively rivals by the low score of 15-4. This loss was not so dis~ppointing i:n itself but that it extinguished any chances for Union to make the states, which had been within a hand's reach.

Coming into the game the Dutchmen knew that hustling, aggressive football was the order of the day if they were to have any hope at all of defeating unbeaten Middlebury on their home field. Union did just that, however, as they played the Panthers competitively for three and a half quarters and, had they gotten just a few breaks, the outcome might well have been reversed. offense, however, had been behind before and they immediately took to the task of knotting up the score. Taking the kick\'()ff on their own 13, Terranova marched the team the remaining 87 yards in 12 plays utilizing both the passing game and the running of big fullback Doug Napodano (18 carries, 71 yards). On a key play in the drive, tight end Kevin Eberly alertly captured a deflected pass for a 25 yard gain to push the Dutchmen deep into Panther territory. Several plays later Terranova spotted a wide open Napadono for a 20 yard pass play to give Union a first and goal from the eight. Terranova finally found paydirt after several unsuccessful attempts when he rolled right and hit standout receiver Mike Wroblewski (7 passes, 70 yards) in the end zone. McDonald added the extra point and the game was knotted at seven.

Off a quick count, quarterback Matt Winslow pitched to highly touted halfback Roy Heffernan and he rambled 49 yards around right end for the opening score. Terranova and the Dutchmen Middlebury wasted little in countering- as they took the ensuing kickoff and drove 60- yards in but 5 plays for the score. The clincher came on a 25-yard pass from Winslow to running back John Dobek who also netted 97 yards rushing on the day.

Junior Andy Terranova pitc~es out to leading ruslter Ricb Romer for good yardage in tile second quarter A fired up Dutchmen defense held Middlebury on their next. possession and the Garnet offense began once again to drive upfield. Terranova's quarterback sneaks along with the bruising running of Napodano enabled Union to grind out several first downs. With the Dutchmen on their own 40 facing a second down and a foot for the first down, the coaching staff elected to go for the bomb. The play was strategically sound as the Panther defense playing tight for the expected short yardage play was completely caught off guard and when Terranova faked once, fleet-footed wide receiver Joey Poletto easily beat his defender, finding himself all alone at least 30 yards from the nearest defender. Terranova's pass, however, fell just out of Poletto's reach and while the Dutchmen did gQ on to get the first down, Middlebury's defense stiffened forcing Union to punt the ball away. the pass play· was· crucial in that it would have resulted in a sure 6 points for the Dutchmen V -Ball Wins and Loses by LYNN BAl'EMAN guests; but Union was just as It was destined to be a long, determined. to take the match and long week for Union's volleyball add two more wins to their team, as there were two tri- record.

Winslow (12-19\ 116 (yds.) moved the Panthers all the way down to the Union 24 before Union defensive tackle Mike Hevey scooped up a bad snap. Terranova's third down pass, unfortunately, was picked off by Panther Kevin Barlow and the Dutchmen found themselves with their backs to the wall once again. The defense held for several downs until Winslow found Heffernan again with a 12 yard toss foF the score ill: the opening seconds of the fourth quarter. Though trailing 31-13 the Dutchmen refused to fold as Terranova marched the team downfield on their next possession. With the ball inside the ten, Terranova threw what looked to be a touchdown pass until Middlebury's Russell Alves made a spectacular diving catch to save a touchdown and stop the drive. The score would have given Union an outside chance of catching the Panthers; instead, it wouldn't he until the final minute of play that the Dutchmen woul4 score again as Terranova (12-28 for 146 yards and four interc~,:ption$), completed a ten yard touchdown pass to Eberly for the final tally.

This year, most of her difficulties have stemmed from the decision by the Planning and Pri<>rities Committee to allocate the housing division cnly $10,000 of the .$55,000 the division had requested. \The request for the l9'n-78 fiscal year (which began July l, 1977 and runs until June 30, 1978} was made in the fall of 1976,\ Ms. Dowling said, \before I assumed~ the post of Director of Housing.

Some of you might be aware that the renovation of the whole area is part of a master plan for .physical improvement of the camous. Professor C. W. Huntley, as chairperson of the Campus Committee and secretaFy of the college, is directly involved with 'Project for the 80's,' a study which was completed by the Saratoga Associates to coordinate future modernization and construction on· the college grounds. He listed a new gynmasium, an improved road system, and possibly an Arts building as eventual construction concerns of 'Project for the 80's.' When asked why the main entrap.ce to campus was given priority over the Arts facility, Professor Huntley· stressed the need for a strong, positive first impression for prospective students. It is believed that a flowered, well paved road is more inviting to visitors than the sight of several overflowing garbage bins and a couple of beer trucks unloading. The traffic circle is also the first step in a plan to transform Union College campus into a walking campus. Within the next few years access roads will be built to dorms and other buildings, but certain roads _will be closed and no cars or trucks will be allowed in the center of Campus. This move is concerned with student safety as well as a more eye-pleasing campus. Before the Bailey grant, which funds campus improvements not covered in the budget, Professors Harlow and Huntley took it upon themselves each year to plant new shrubs and trees. And over the years specific investments have been made for campus beauty: the replanting of the elms and the construction of Library Plaza to name two. Now with 'Project for the 80's' there is a comprehensive plan for beautification. However, for all you fellow students who do not wish to see the Nott Memorial crumble to dust, the Bailey donation of $214,000 is not sufficient to even begin restoration of the Nott. (Professor Huntley estimates $2,000,600 will be necessary to rebuild the Nott.) In the meantime we can all I<Jok forward to the day when the pedestrian controls Campus.

They are responsible for the administratien of the college and all financial transactions in Union's name. The trustees as a body are self~perpetuating; they hold elections within the board to replace membership. There are four types of Trllstees: Alumni, which are elected by the Alumni body for a four-year period; Term Trustees, which are also elected for four-year terms but by the Board itself ~n the basis of devotion and interest in Union College. A positive factor in selection of a 'term Trustee is demonstrated ex:pe:rtise· in matters of law, intellect, a11d finance. Life trustees are previous members of the Board 'Wll() showed great dedication to the CoUege and therefore are voted peimanent office. The Trustees we have most contact with, as st11dents, are the Student and Faculty (Campus) Trustees, who are elected for two- year terms. Every member of the Board of Trustees has an equal vote.

A common feature of this type of governance model is a senate of some sort, with .each group electin~ representatives. The senai._, usually chaired by the Presidef!.t, enacts community policy, either in the fotm of recommend~tion to the Board of Trustees or instructions to the President. Sornetillles the president has to implement policie~ he does not support, and fi~ds himself competing with a senate which does riot llilderstand the difference between legislation. and administration. This is a weakness of the community governance model, leading t6 ambiguity on the subject of leadership. In the year l970-197l, because of faculty restiveness and changes of administration authoritarian- ism, an ad hoc committee was established at Union College to revise the existing governance system and allow fot increased student .participation. Up to this time Union operated vety much in the institutional governance mode; the President managed in- stitutional affairs with little outside consultation, and the faculty handled matters of concern to them. l'he ad ,hoc committee proposed a change from the institutional governance system to the community modeL Their proposal was accepted, creating an All-College Senate, chaired by the President; and composed of · ~hree faculty ·members from each of Uniort~s four divisions (Humanities, Social Sciences, Sdence and Engineering), seven students, the Dean of Faculty, and the Dean of Students. The faculty voted to surrender its legislative function to the Senate. This community governance system evolved over . the pa,st six years, with the Senate bei~g responsible for legislation · · on matters affecting more than . one of the three groups- f~culty, students, and administration. Thorburn sited four examples at · Union, which illustrate some of the strengths. and Weaknesses of this governance system. The first of these was the issue of inter- ~ollegiate athletics. \this event generated more controversy than any other in the recent history of Union. Tbotburn went on to sulllm~rize the actual events which took place,. and their implications, with an emphasis on · the creation of a Task Force on Athletics. Thorburn demonstrates how this heated issue brought into view the se:Vere lack of complete representation of the various constituencies in the Union community. The second, and less volatile issue, concerns- the Planning and Priotities Committee. This committee is charged with establishing plans and goals for the college, and. making budgetary recommendations. They. do their wotk so effectively that when the President's Cabinet receives the budget recommendations, they are, in fact, receiving a budget. The question posed is, who is in charge? The College charter says that the President is responsible for the budget.

Various other groups receive free aps in Distorty at different times throughout the course of a term. For instance, Mountebanks receives at least three full pages for play publicity during each term. This has occurred for neady the last five years, so the theatrical group owes the paper .$14,400 for past services. Without Distorty, think of how poorly attended the plays would be and the enormous loss of revenue due to declining ticket sales. Without going into the actual numbers, several other groups on campus are all in the sam.e category. They all use Distorty, but nev~r pay for the column space they occupy. These groups include the Social Committee {if they lose up to $8.000 on a concert with Distorty publicity, imagine how much they would lose without it), Men:s Glee Club, Women's Glee Club, Cabaret, Jazz Ensemble and Game Night. With the collection of the past debts and the continued collection along the new guidelines, it can be seen that Distorty's revenues will · increase s1,.1bstantially, and when this is combined with the .efficient collection of off-campus ads, Distorty will be able to control and invest large sums of Continued on Page 6 Th.e,IJ.r..9.lifit:,m:msmse~c.antained.within~is putely fietitious.

:November 16; 1971 Union College Campus Voice Dousing set of rules about what students are allowed to do.\ Ms. Dowling sees another adv~ntage in improving the conditions. of rooms here: · •• If the dorJ,lls .are in better condition when the students arrive here, tbelll be willing to take better care .of them, 'Even noW, sotne students are trying to improve room conditions. For instance, a lot ef people are painting their walls.\ . But the· Ho11sing DiVision's plans for improving ·Union living conditions diJ not include replacirtg •the carpeting in Fox.

But 1'111 only one person, and tb.ere•s only so much that I call dC>.\ While Ms. J)owling a11d the Housing Committee hope to improve the CO'nditions of dormitory roo111s at Union, a large :portion t;~f the money the Housmg Divi~icin must spend C()ntinued from P•ge 3 each year must .go to repairing damage caused by students. Students are fined for any damage termed bY Ms. Dowling as \excessive mess and broken furniture -- that they cause·. The list of students receiving fines for damage caused during the last spring term in¢luded six. full pages. \We're going to make a concerted effort · between the fall and winter.te@ this year to assess darnage,?' Ms. .Dowling ~id. \We'd like. to k~p track of what's going orfso that students won't be held responsible for damage caused by a previous occ'!Jpant of their room.\ But af~er. the fine· is levied. there's no guara11tee that the; money collected will be channeled' to ti:J.e Housing Department. \We're budgeted a set amount for each year,\ Ms. Dowling said. ''Fines collected are credited to the General College Fund. There's rio assurance that the Housing Division will receive this money. though I wish• there were.\ Another area of concern relating to college housing t;his year centered around the seemingly higher number of five~ man . suites. According to. Ms. Dowling, tbere were 3.6 such suites when this term began. This number has decreased; however, as vacancies become apparent, and students move into unoccupied rooms. Interestingly enough, this housing crunch is a uniquely male problem. \There are even a few vacancies for women,\ Ms. Dowling said. .. But it doesn't appeat. that the problem for males will, be fully solved until the winter term.\ Students living in five-man suites do not have to pay as much as those living in suites with only four people. But five-man suites do not benefit the c(,)llege fmantially. .. It doesn 1 t do us a bit of gc,>od w . have five-man suites,\ Ms. Dowling. said. ''All we want to do is maintain maximum occupancy. We know that, as the year progresses,. there are hound to be some people who stop living on campus, either .temporarily or permanently. But it's no trauma for us to have a couple of spaces in the spring term. ''Union College doesn't exist to make money. We're here to give an education. Housing is provided as a service:~ And the cost of living has risen dramatically at Union for the .1977-78 academic year. Room and board costs, which totaled $1600 for a student attending Union in 1976-77, now amount to $1750~ ma)(ing Uniop's room and board cbarges the sixteenth highest il.l the United States. Columbia University bas the most e:x,pensive room llt1d board charges in the nation ~ $2246 f.or l9Ti-78. Union's increase of $150 in charges for the1;1e services from 1976·77 are, alog.g with Vassar College, the second highest in the llnited States. All of this increased cost is attributable to increased food costs, according to Ms. l)owling. \Last year I met with some members of the Class of 1980 and representatives of ~ >\GA food service, which supr:.es food in the dining rooms ·:a West College Dormitory and Hale House. The students agreed it would be worth the additional cost if the quality of food were to be improved. And it has been. For instance, we now include bacon with brunch on weekem:ls in the West College dining room.\ So, like the old woman in the shoe, Ms. Dowling is engaged in a never--ending quest to Upgrade Union living conditions. But she has a lot more people in a lot more places to look after. And Ms. Dowling is finding that, as she enter~ her sec9nd year as Director of Housing here, she has some mighty large shoes to fill.

This points out another weakness of such a governance system: the lack of a clear-cut distinction between legislation and administration, in addition to confusion over lines of leadership. Tl)e third illustration involved the Internal Education Foundation. This proposal, summarized briefly, recommends a foundation be established to assist students and faculty on projects which enrich educational process. If the College Senate approves such diction, there would be no problem. If they do not, the President and trustees still have the power to create such a foundation, but without student and faculty support, it could hardly accomplish its purpose. This further illustrates the tension . between'. legislation and manageme~t. The las~\in'ustration concerns student admissions. An Admissions Committee is selecting a class to enter each year, subject to these guidelines. In fact, however, the committee must read admissions folders and make recommendations in the student selection process. This infringes on the management res- ponsibility of the Admissions Office, and creates an uncomfortable situation when the committee makes and implements its policy. Again, Thorburn states, \like of responsibility are cloudy and efforts to clarify them produce more debates than decision making.'' Thorburn concludes that several difficulties in Union's governance system are evident. One, it cre.ates tension. Second, because of such tension, and the community governance system: 1 \all factions are represented, and ..all voices do get a hearing. Thete is very little question about how an issue should be handled, to 'Which committee it should be referred, or where it will ultimately go for a decision.\ Union's system also promotes a high degree of institutional loyalty, which is important irt higher education today. The apparent trend towards the institutional governance model, however, is most striking. ..The administration strives to lead by proposing guidelines and signaling its willingness to carry them out. The faculty, at least on most issues save athletics, is mostly content to concentrate on its traditional academic concerns. And the students, they are less aggressive participants in the process than the case when 'the community model was initiated in , the creation of a College Senate.'' Union illustrates ·a decline in favor for the community model of governance.

The Admissions Office is charged with the administrative responsibility of recruiting applicants and , amount of time spent in committee meetings, decision making is slowed down. The most central weakness, however, is the amount of .politics involved in the system. For instance, in the beckey issue, there is a tremendous amount of jockeying for power by faculty and administration members, each fearing a loss of status. and thus resulting in unsulistantial accom• plishments. lhorburn also points out the many strengths found in Union's by mutUal consent instead of by a c~mfr~ntation between an angry Board · of Trustees upset over campus political strife, and a frustrated faculty.

Garnet End SeasonOn w· • Note ' by DANNY WOJNILOWER On a cold, windy Saturday afternoon at Alexander Field, the Union College Dutchmen lost yet another coin toss but managed to complete their disappointing season with an impressive 3 J miJ victory over the Continentals of Hamilton College. The gridders stormed on to the field led by eight psyched seniors playing in their final game for the Garnet including co-captains Ken Beck and John Speer. Their Senior co-captains Ken Beck Hamilton came on the field for the second half determined not to let the Union gridders please their rooters. Midway through- the period, Continentals' quarterback Tom LaFountain engineered·a 92 yard drive which ended with Dan Wald:ron drilling a four yard scoring pass to end Billy Romaine o~ a halfback option play. This scoring drive, which cut the Dutchmen lead to seven, featured a spectacular diving catch by Romaine of a 48 yard LaFountain which set uv and John Speer the tally. including 13 toucbdowns, three ot which eame in the Hamilton game. Terranova also rushed for 295 yards on his own and scored three times, Freshman wide receiver Henry Wright ·led the team With 26 receptions and transfer Joe Poletto led the receivers with four touchdowns and 24 points which · placed him second in team storm~. The Dutchman offense, which grounded out 343 yards per game and averaged just over 20 points. a game looks to be strong again enthusiasm seemed to carry over to the entire squad as Union ran all over their' opponents with a swarming defense and a potent · offense. With the ensuing kickoff, however, Union began a drive which proved that on this Saturday they would not he denied. After split end Kevin Frederick returned the kickoff 28 yards to near midfield, halfback Rich Romer .gained 15 yards on three plays to help move the Dutchmen downfield. Then, on the same play Poletto had scored on earlier, Terranova hit Frederick on, a 34 yard touchdown play. next year but will sorely miss offensive linemen John Speer, Ed · Kulik and Roger Payne as well as end John Kennedy. The defense, which ~eemed to come on strong in the last two games should also show improvement next year despite the Ioss of standouts Ken Beck, Rob Stoltz, Tom Am<J,to, and Mike \Hevey. To these eight seniors, on behalf of Union College, we thank you ·for a.n exciting four years on tbe gridiron. Junior speedster Joe Poletto di$p/ays forrn that made . him second-leading Dutchman receiver this fall The Dutchmen, playing mucll better than a 2-5-1 team, left the crowd bewildered by routing the same Hamilton team that had defeated WPI 27-6. WPI had Tight end John Kennedy defeated Union in the secon<l game of the season by a score of 20-13. Regardless, it was a game that showed good things lying ahead. Coach Tom Cahill reiterated this saying, ''I'm disappointed that our 'Won-.lost record wasn't better, but I'm pleased at our progress. We demonstrated that the program is Roving.\ The Dutchmert offense was also Dloving-moving toward the liamilton goal. After a scoreless first period during which the Garnet defense completely held the Continentals' \0\ at bayj Union scored on the first play of the second quarter. Quarterback Andy Terranova connected with running back Doug Napodano on a 18 yard touchdown strike. The remainder of the second stanza saw much of the same, with the <Jefense not allowing a first down until there was 6:26 remaining in the half. Union got its second score with I :46 to go when speedster Joey Poletto ran Roger Payne, ojjenstve tackle by his defender down the right ~.ideline and collected the I erranova bomb for a 48 yard touchdown pass. lbe Dutchmen went to the locker room ahead 14..0, much to the delight of the crowd. On the last play of the third quarter, place kicker McDonald split the uprights with a 3f yard field goal to extend the Union lead to 24-7. Later, the icing on the cake was provided when, with 8: I 7 left in the game, defensive tackle Steve McCarthy recovered •a Hamilton fumble in the Continentals' end zone. With everything going right f~r the U Coli griddt!rs, Coach Cahill was able to use his reserves for much· of the fourth quarter. This resulted in a Hamilton touchdown on an eight yard aerial with less than two minutes Tackle Ed Kulik remaining. -When the final horn sounded the scoreboard read Union 31-Hamilton 13. Senior linebacker and co- captain Ken Beck, who led Union's fired-up defense was named as one of the winners of the Rue . Award, presented annually to the most valuable player of each team in this game. Sam Tarantino, a linebacker, was the Hamilton recipient. The Garnet victory evened the 82 year old rivalry at 35-35-12. For the second straight year, sopho'more halfback Rich \Rodeo\ Romer led the team in rushing, gam1ilg 646 yards. Romer also lead the squad in scoring with 30 points and touchdowns With six-four coming by the run, one by the pass and one by way of his spectacular kickoff. return against Middlebury. Junior quarterback Andy Terranova a'lso had a good year, completing 47.8 % of his passes, Defensive linemen Tom Amato, Mike Hevey and Rob Stoltz. Senior linemen stopped Hamilton ground game and were key factors in Saturday~$ 31-13 win. · V-BALL SENIORS WIND UP YEAR AT 13-10 ~atoon -and wltite filled the field house. Colgate was- on one side of the court warming up in their long sleeve white shirts and maroon shorts and Union women wearing their short sleeve maroon shirts and maroon shorts on the ather. As Union continued to warm up and become psyched for the game, we all knew that the four crazy seniors were planning something for this last 'horne match. With time running out in 'pre-gl!,l'ile warm, up. the four seniors appeared in what looked like Colgate's uniforms. But as we approached them we saw that they were dressed in rather shabby white shirts, with numbers unprofessionally attached and white gym shorts. They were in the uniforms that they had the nerve to wear to other schools just foul' ye~us ago. So the match was. off to a humorous start ·an~ perhaps we never quite regained tlie St?rious- side of the psych peeded to beat Colgate because last thursday, Union's wome~ saw ~notbet game added to the loss column. Union did not look good enough to beat the Colgate team. Colgate was an excellent team and was entering the state competition the following_ day. · The defeat was upsetting but nonetheless Coach Lynn Barta had the chilled champagne waiting so we could toast our four crazy departing ~enims. It was the last home game of the season and we had to give a warm send off to these team members: With the 1978 graduation, we lose Diana ''Gaz\ Gazzola, and . Cathy \Hustler\ Reals; our great setters, Amy \Wombo\ Juchatz, our captain and excellent player who moved on the court this year as both a setter and hitter, and Lynn Bate!Xlan, the great hard hitting offensive, ·' and knee cutting defensive player. With the outstanding coaching of Union's new Lyna Barta, the U niort women carne a long way this season since the days of the white uniforms. We had a team psyched to play and Jearn. We .enter our last two matches on Wedrtesday at RP1 with an ll-10 record and hope to return home with a final 13-10 standing. This season's history was a different one, not only did a very psyched team W()r.k harder th.aa before, but we gained the support of many in the community. c c ~- c - - by RU The announ1 applicat financia student! applicat from tl Old Gy Josep of Stud upon a that n forms c every yc so th~ submitt respecti This Office form f for aid year. 1 theFi11 a stan Parent: (PCS). in add place < the C11 is the • of the applic~ Educa1 as we inform form.

'i l ! i 'l ·i i i Pal{e2 CONCORD!.F.NS!S, November 16. 1971 Professor Hugh Allen Wilson 0 0 Glee Club Looks Back by ANOY SANDLER On Wednesday June 15, 1977 the Union College Men's Glee Club and the Wheaton College Women's Glee Club arrived in Caracas, Venezuela for a highly publicized eleven day, eleven concert tour. The arri·val in Vene~uela of this grQilp was the result of over a year of organizational work and preparation by Hugh Wilson and the Men's Glee Club. The events leading up to the Glee tlub's arrival in Caracas began to develop onSepteirlher 3, I 976, when a plane carrying the Orfeon, the Central U tJiversity Choir of Caracas to a concert tour in Spain crashed over the Azores. All 53 people on board the plane were killed and all of Venezuela mourned the loss of the Orfeon, the pride of Venezuelan culture. A Requiem Mass was held in Boston and members of the Union Glee Club attended. At about this time a proposed Glee Club trip to Columbia had 'been cancelled d11e to the political uncertainty of that country. A Venezuelan consulate became interested in Union's attempt to arrange a concert tour in South America. Sbe apptoached he.r government on behalf .of the Union College and Wheaton College Glee Clubs. Serious negotiation for a joint Union/ Wheaton concert tour dedicated. to the memory of the Orfeon began shortly thereafter. Funding 'became a major obstac;:le to the· completion of the arrangements for the tour. l'he Venezuelan Tourist Mini~try agreed to absorb a large part o1 the ex:penses. When approac-hed for fund raising ideas by Glee Club President Don Dennis, Ned Harkness offered the Glee Club the tickets for two inteJ\SQ&Jad hockey ga.mes. The. receipts. froiil those ga:mes plus what was 111ade front a Halloween Party at the Bonner's home raised o:ver ~2,()00 for the trip. · Death of a Salesman Opens Early last spring, with plans for the trip almost completed, Wi.lsJJil. wrote the White House. to invite Mrs. Carter to the inaugllral concert in Caracas, as her planned trip to Venezuela coincided with that of the Glee Club. Conflicting schedales prevented her fr()m attending but the continuing correspondence between Wilson and tbe WIIite House produl$ed an invitati<:m for the Glee Club to perfor-m at ,a State Dinner hono:ring Venezuel~n President Perez. The invitation was accepted an<l the Glee Club .performed atthe Wll-ite House on the day following tlt.~ir return from Venezuc;Ia. by STEVE MONOSSON The Mountebanks production of Arthur Miller's .. Death of a Salesman\ which can be seen this weekend from November 16-19 in the Nott Memorial, is of a high class which is comparable if not equal in general quality to a lot of things being done professionally at present. The play itself is an inarguable classic, and the treatment that it is- given here does not do it justice. Director Barry Smith has molded the cast and technical aspects of the play into a force which emotionally • envelops the audience member. He does this to a point where minor judgements in direction which might not work perfectly seem superfluous and unhamper:. ing of the drama. What is being transpired on the stage is the classic tale of one Willy Loman, a salesman unknowingly bent on his own destruction. He is a product of the world around him, a world which he can not begin to deal with rationally due to his lack of personal fortitude and the directly contrasting elements in his life which constantly confuse him. His brother Ben, who walks with a limp. comes to Willy and offers him a lucrative proposition in Alaska and Willy almost takes him up on it until his loving wife Linda dissuades him. Willy refers to Linda as his \foundation and support\ and, in actuality, this is not exactly the case as she pushes him on to believe in his false dreams of becoming a well liked, legendary salesman. Biff, his son, realizes that this is not what Willy is cut out for. and Willy curses him for saying so. Willy is so wrapped up in his fake life that only an emotional outburst from Biff brings him partially to his senses, and this only serves to push him to commit an inevitable error in judgement in a vain attempt to heip his son. To fully understand the workings of the mind of this man one must see the FIRST AID . COURSE The Sehenectady. County Chapter. American Red Cross and Unic:m College Security & Safety Committee will be offering an 8-hour certification C()urse in Basic First Aid with 12-hour optional CPR course. The course will be offered beginnin~ rnid-January and will be given in 2-4 class · sessions, day or evening classes. All interested members of the college community should sign ilp in the College . Security Orfice, after 5 p.m. or· during pre-registration. The cost is (almost) free. For further .information, contact Delores Harris, Security Office aftt•r 5 p.ll); show for him or herself or be prepared to read a twenty-five page thesis on the subject. Since space is limited, the actual production will be dealt with at this time. Barry Smith has done a .marvelous job in filling the stage with movement and life. He expertly bridges past and present scenes in the ·life of Willy Loman, while maintaining the fumbling characteristic of the thought patterns of the man. One scene, which takes place in a restaur:ant where Willy is to meet his sons BitT and Happy, becomes slightly confused as elements from all levels of Willy's mind come flooding in at once. It was very clear to this reviewer what was occuring due to personal familiarity with the play, but someone seeing it for the first time, might just get the impression of absolute confusion. This is fine if taken in that light, but the individual elements of the confusion are lost in the conglomeration. As for almost the entirety of tile presentation, Director Srpith is faithful to Miller's intentions and makes the audience see just what makes Willy Loman tick and just what makes him stop ticking. Another person even more largely responsible for bringing across the persona of WiUy Loman is George Siletzky. As Willy .Loman, Siletzky has done a tremendous job of filling the part so that ·almost every action taken seems to be able to be accounted for. He seemed to be slight·ly uncomfortable at the outset of the play, but very quickly warmed up to an intensity which had the audience riveted to its seats. All of the ·expressions of Willy Loman caine across vividly in Siletzky's characterization; the childish glee in bringing home a new punching bag for his '\adonises\ (his sons), the confusion at being fired by someone whom he had named twenty some odd years earlier, and the love which comes pouring out all over the stage at the realization of :his sorts' devotion to him; they are all there. Not to be made any less of is John Rose, Biff, who brilliantly characterizes a m~m spending his time trying to show his father that he loves hitn more than anything else in the REMEMBER!!·!

One of th_e most touching moments in the pl~y comes when Biff realizes that his father has been unfaithful to his mother, and the shock and disappointment which one sees in Biff Loman is breathtaking. Alex Shafer as Happy, Willy's. mindless and basically self center.ed son, delivers his lines rapid fire so that some of the inhumanity of the character. is lost. He does a nice job though, and certainly adds to the color of the play. Verna Lowe is exquisite as Linda, and the unknowing mis-guidance which is ·essential to· the character is portrayed to the tee by Ms. Lowe. Upon seeing the show several times in succession, Ms. Lowe seemed to grow more and more into her part with each. passing performance, and Linda Loman became mote and more of the play, too. Elsewhere in the cast there is little to be faulted, too. Torn Farrell as Charley, Willy's constantly be'nevolent and willing to understand neighbor, stands out as the last outpost of stability which Willy Loman chooses to ignore. The undercurrent of pity beneath the humor which is Charley, is displayed by Farrell in such a heartfelt manner that one can not help but to appreciate and sympathize with the character. Jack Stein, as Bernard (Char: ley's son), also portrays with a fine hand the sympathy which he must be willing to show to take abuse from Willy. Harry Rosen is solid- as Ren; ·Willy's brother to whom Willy subconsciously looks for advice. He delivers his lines with a superni!tural quality which makes him the part of Willy's mind which he is. As for the rest of the cast; they aU carry out their intended purposes with .a flair, and each member can take pride in what he or she has done. Virginia Giordano has done a truly professional job with the lighting, as this show is very much dependent on lighting effects to hold it together. At no point does the lighting itself confuse us, .and some of the designs are most striking indeed. The set is beautiful in that it has all sorts of subtle effects built into it. These include a chimney which becomes more dilapidated as it gets taller, a hotel-like floor design which The NATIONAL THEATRE ~NS'FITUTE, the .grQup which performed here so successfully last spring, is returning!

Charles Steckler and Peter Crames, the set designers, are to be given credit for a fine job. Willy Loman has to be one .of the most interesting creations of the American theatre. To miss the Mountt;banks production of his life would be an insult. And ·one does not insult Willy Loman. See it: November 16-19 in the Nott Memorial at 8:00. According to Dennis the tr,ip was a mo11t rewarcling experience for all involved.
