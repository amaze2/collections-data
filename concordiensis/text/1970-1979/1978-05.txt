Fraulein SENIORS By JOHN SAMUELIAN The Housing lottery hit the UColl campus during the 8th week and _took its toll. Many problems arose and some ex- planations are necessary .. At the present time there are -some 100 future sophomores unassigned to rooms next year. Some blame it on increased enrolbnent; others say that it's because of upperclassmen who decided not to go off campus. According to Joanna B.

I Founded at Union. College 1877 Vol. 107 SCHENECTADY, N. Y., WEDNESDJ\. Y, MAY 3,1978 No. 22 DEAN SEARCH New Home for Jean Pelletiere by ANDY OELBAUM After evaluating nearly 200 applicants, the Dean Search Committee has narrowed the number of possible candidates down to five. Two of the finalists have appeared on campus but according to one member of the committee, both failed to impress the committee members. One candidate was considered a \nice guy\ while the other was thought to be a ••slick administrator.\ Mr. Vice, the first of the other three candidates scheduled to visit the school in the next few weeks, is considered a solid candidate. He, according t9 the committee member, has strong \profes-sional \ Pelletiere---New Head Librarian by LINDSAY TAN Jean Pelletiere,. presently at the University of Wisconsin of Oshkosh, will be the new Head Librarian at Union College, Prof. Jan Ludwig, chairman of the Head Librarian Search committee announced yesterday. There had. been a verbal agreement with Ms. Pelletiere since Friday, April 15th, but Prof. Ludwig felt that it was wiser to wait for her to return a signed contract before making an official announcement. She would fill the position which had been vacant since the Winter of 1976 when Dr. Edwin Tolan, the Head Librarian, passed away. Since that time, three search committees had been formed for the purpose of finding a replacement. The first committee was formed in the Spring of 1976 with Prof. Potts, then a full time member of the faculty, as the chairman. This committee lasted till the winter of 1977 when it was disbanded,. without giving any recommendations for appointments to this position. 'fhe next committee was headed · by Prof. Josef Schmee of the Institute of Administration and Management. This committee did find a candidate for the position of Head Librarian. This applicant, however; withdrew from consideration and the committee was unable to nominate an alternate. After the second committee was disbanded, there was some discUssion as to whether an internal appointment should be made or a third search committee be formed. The latter option was chosen with one change to the committee structure. Both the previous two committees were large and cumbersome; it was agreed to reduce the size of the third and last committee. This committee, consisting of Prof. Ludwig, Sarah Dearing ('80), Prof. Janet Gregor (library}, Prof. Ennis Pilcher (physics) and Dean Potts set to work at the beginning of this academic year. Their task was not easy as they found that the previous committee had destroyed most of their notes, having prematurely assumed that they had found a candidate. The committee also found that they did not have an adequate job description, nor did they have any informative material on Schaffer Library. Prof. Ludwig described the task of the committee in the Fall term as one of starting from scratch, as they tried to rectify these deficiencies. The search committee thus- produced an eleven-page bulletin entitled, .. Information Concerning Schaffer Library,\ which described briefly the college, the recent history of Schaffer Library, its current state and discussed some of the major issues for the near future concerning the library. Next, the committee set about to write a job description for this position and, the first advertisement was published during December in the New York · Times. Later it was published in the various journals of library s.cience and through the American Library ·Association publications. To further increase the exposure, letters were sent by the committee to various college librarians in the hope that they would nominate suitable candidates for this position, or even /perhaps nominate themselves. This method, according to Prof. Ludwig, worked well and they obtained many suitable candidates from this source. In all, seventy-nine applications were considered of which twenty- one applicants were sub!;equently given serious consideration. Fro111 this group of applicants, four candidates were 1nvited to visit Union at the eild of Winter term. The candidates were Thomas Kirk of Earlham College, David Fraser of Haverford· College, Kenneth Jensen of University of Virginia, and Jean Pelletiere. They came during March and early this month, meeting with faculty, administrators and students. Prior to their arrival, the Search Committee had released a letter to the campus which included the edited resumes of three of the four candidates. Finally, the decision was made; from these candidates, Ms. Pelletiere was deemed the most suitable for the position and a contract was sent out to her. Jean Pelletiere is presently the Acting Executive Director of Polk Library at the Un.iversity of Wisconsin. She has held this positian since 1977. Previous to this she was the Head of Public Services at the same university. From 1974-1976, she was coordinator of Bibliography I; Instructor at the School of Librarianship, University of Continued on Page 9 Daniels Wins Fellowship Professor William J. Daniels, an associate professor of political science at Union College since 1966, is one of the two winners in a national competition for a Judicial Fellowship for the 1978- 1979 academic school year. During the fellowship year, Daniels will serve as a ·research associate at the Federal Judicial Center, and as a staff associate in the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Federal Judicial Center is the research arm of the Federal Court system, and attempts to make long-range plans for the Federal courts. Daniel's duties will include historical analyses and documentation of past and recent judicial innovations, feasib- ility studies and advance staff work for proposed or e~isting commissions and institutions, and day-to-day liaison work with committees of the U.S. Congress. Daniels will not be involved in any legal research. The Office of the Admin- istrative Assistant to the Chief Justice deals with the day-to-day activities of the Chief Justice. Duties include preparing speeches . for the Chief Justice, organizing the Chief Justice's travelling schedule and generally working on projects designed to help the Chief Justice administer the . Federal Court System. The Judicial Fellows Program was designed to attract persons from the fields of public admin- istration, the behavioral sciences, business arrangement, operations management and systems .analysis, and law, to provide them an opportunity to contribute to the modernization of the judiciary and to help the general public understand the nature and needs of the judicial system. The was initiated in 1973, administered by the Academy of Public Administration in cooperation with 'the Federal Judicial Center, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Chi~f Justice. Eigh.t finalists were selected l>Y the Judicial fellows Commission. All finalists were sent to Washington, D.C., for interviews. The F .B.l. was assigned the task of interviewing the finalists, their Continued on 9 credentials.\ Mr. Vice is a graduate of the University of Chicago and has been serving as a Dean of Students at lllinois In- stitute of Chicago since 1975. The two other candidates' chan- ces are indeterminate as of now. Little is known of one candidate, while the other is a former Professor at Union College - Pat Allen. He now teaches night courses at Union, but left the school as a full-time professor when he was not granted t~:nure. When asked if Professor Allen's failure to gain tenure here would influence the committee's de- cision, the interviewee admitted that it might. He expressed 'the belief, however, that despite its significance, one's ability to gain tenure is not .an indicator of one's competence, and would therefore have a minimal effect upon the committee's decision concerning Professor Allen. The committee has not been enthused with this group of candidates. The interviewee told Concordy that the possibility ex- ists that there might be a second search committee organized if these candidates are not considered satisfactory. The committee is searching for a candidate with strong academic credentials, an ability . to be articulate, a propensity to learn, and an ability to relate to students and represent them to the faculty ' and ad ministration. The committee member emphasized the importance of the last characteristic, as he called the Dean of Students \the student's front line,\ and considered the scale used to weigh a candidate's credentials is the ability of the Dean to meet and express the students' needs. He mentioned that the paradox inherent in the job itself as one of the primary factors which makes it so difficult to find a suitable candidate for the job. The position demands an experienced educator who, because of the nature of his work, will tend to be 1 \narrow minded,\ while the Dean of Students must also be a person with diversified talents who can effectively understand and solve various types of problems while adapting to different types of situations. The eight members on the Dean Search Committee are scheduled to reveal its selection by the end of May. The committee member interviewed by Concordy believes that the decisio11 wi II not be unanimous. but says tnat as long as none of the committee members were vcheme11tly against the nomination of the candidate in question, there would be little trouble approving him as long as a majority of the members consented to his selection. The selection of the candidate, if approved by the committee, would then be submitted to the PAB for approval. If the Search Committee fails to arrive at a suitable candidate for the job, they will either offer Rudy V. Nydegger (now serving as Acting Dean of Students) another term at that post, or appoint another member of the college community to the position. Mr. Vice will be visiting Union on May 8 and May 9.

To date campl,ls ticket sales have been somewhat dissappointing. For the past year, with few exceptions, concerts have been poorly attended; The most widely used excuse has been the alleged poor quality of the performers.

OPINION No Excuses This coming week, Union College has the opportunity to experience the music of three fine bands: Henry Gross, Pure Prairie League and- the Charlie Daniels Band. To date campus ticket sales h a v e been some w hat dissappointing. For the past year, with few exceptions, concerts have been poorly attended. The most widely used excuse has been the alleged poor q~:~ality of the performers. This is an unjust cnttctsm for this concert. Admittedly, they have not been the \cream of the crop\ however a school of Union's size, without outside assistance, is usually unable to present \major\ entertainers. In response, the Social Committee is .presenting two major entertainers and yet campus ticket sales remain sluggish,. Therefore the excuse given is just that, merely an' excuse. never heard, concert quality can not improve and the possibility of eventually pleasing everyone will be greatly diminished. Union College: the opportunity is at hand to either satiate your desire to see Charlie Daniels and The Pure Prairie League and experience something that you may never have had such a dose opportunity to see and hear. The Social Committee has provided the entertainment it i~ now up to the community to respond. I suggest you come and hear the music and enjoy the party. Only you can make it a success and pave the road for bigger and better concerts. People can also say that they may not appreciate the type of music presented as much as others may, but this is a place of not only instructi:on lntt education. To expand the cultural experience includes music, and the opportunity is here for people to experience not only a new brand of music (if they have not heard it) but also a cultural experience.

It was asked what would constitute a finished project Brownlee said that she hoped that the 15 or so people working on projects would present their work to the rest of the group.

Someone asked how the Although the cost for the honors program has been estimated as high as $100,000, program would be evaluated at the end . of the first year.

Students Involved In Community Sometime during Wi.nter Term, Coneordy ran an announcement concerning applications for an Internship in the Delivery of Social Services. Although the applications for this course were quite numerous, much of the college community is not aware of the Sociology Internships or how they work. The Internships in the Delivery of Social Services is a Union College regustered course (Soc 61) and is under .the direction of Professor Frank Carlile. It involves the student in actual social field work and can be of immeasurable help . in gl-Vmg Union students the experience they need in \the outside world\. The internships involve working along with, as well as observing various social service organizations in the Schenectady area. Among the organizations involved this year are WM HT- TV, Planned Parenthood, the United Way, the Chamber of Commerce, the City Health Department, and nine other non- profit service organizations. expenditures, the organizations efficiency at providing the stated seFvices, and perhaps any political entanglements that constrict the workings of a service organization. In general,. the student works from within the organization in order to learn more about the actual workings of a social service organization at the same time as providing the organization with a sociologically experienced worker. As an example, one student working with the Chamber of Commerce is helping them to draw up a 'questionnaire in order to find out how to better fit the needs of the people that they serve. Another student is helping to write proposals for his organization, but the one thing common to all the students is that they are gaining first hand experience in the workings of service organizations. According to Prof. Carlile, the department would like to be able to expand on the internship program as it does hav.e much to offer the students (and there are organizations in waiting); however, \running the internship program is like running 22 independent studies\ and with no increases for the Sociology Dep'artment forthcoming, the program will probably have to be kept to a relatively small size. So how does one go about getting involved in this internship program. Well, \The time to start planning,\ according to Prof,. Carlile, \is now!\ lt is necessary to have at least an Introductory Sociology- course. In addition, a course in occupations and organizations or Methods of Social Research are very beneficial. Applications come out about the middle of Winter Term, and the internships are held in Spring Term. In probably becomes obvious to most students what th~y have to offer to this internship program but some may still question what a Social Internship has to Qffer them. Simply, the student offers the organization his or her time, effort, and sociological experience. The organization offers the st~,tdent the kind of 'on-the-job, out-in- the-real-world' experience that becomes so invaluable when looking for a job or in deciding which job to .look for and finally, the $Chool offers the student a course credit for exploring how a service organization delivers its services to the public. Add all of these things together and you have an ofler you can not refuse: The Sociology Department's Internship in the Delivery of Sodal Services. To find out more about the Sociology Internship Program, contact Prof. Carlile at 6227 or 283 visit the Sociology Department offices on the second Hoor of the Social Sciences Building. Wine will be available at other dinners, if not every evening, either with the plan or at a nominal · additional charge depending on the evening. It has been hoped that this pla,n, offered at Hale House, would be the solution to independents seeking a food plan th!:Y can be a part of, to those students who feel it is too expensiv.e to eat all their meals out and end up trying to cook for themselves, and finally an alternative to those who would like a real quality food plan where no vegetables come from cans, potatoes are not made from powder, and pastries and baked products are made fresh -on the premises all to provide a del-ightful culinary and nqtritionally sound experience. The cost of the meal plan will be $280/term.- If you would like more information or are interested in signing up, please see Angelo Mazzone, Director ol Food Services, or Chris Johnson at the Dutch Hollow Pub. According to Prof. Carlile, the interns, once chosen, are placed with a certain organization based on his or her skills, previous sociology courses, and individual personality so as to best fit the needs of both the student and the organization involved. The interns are then required to spend approximately 15-20 hours per week working within the organization. According to Prof. Carlile, the students get together with him or in groups to discuss their findings and build a general folder on the organization so that they may write a final report about their particular internship. This report is then received not only as a summation of the student's work, but is given to the organization involved so that this well conceived program is a total learning experience for all; the students and the organizations. John Dean to Speak Ideally, approximately half of the student's time iS' spent doing actual work for the organization while the other half is spent on research of the organizations actual goals versus real goals, money sources as well as The forerunner of this program was developed at Duke University by our own Prof. Eugene Schneller and was begun here at Union last year. After an apparent success with IS students last year, the program has expanded to involve 22 students this year. Robbery in West by JIM DAVIS Six rooms in West College dormitory were burglarized last Saturday morning, April 29. The crimes took place betWtie'n 1 6-6:30 AM. A total of $49~in'\splall\b-iUs was taken. Four rooms on the second floor and two on the third were vandalized. Four of the rooms were occupied by females and two by m~des. There was no indication of forced entry into the building or the students' rooms. ••The doors on the ground Hoor of West College are locked every night around 6:30 PM,\ said Union's direc~or of security and safety, Clifford Wood. \Since no no windows broken~ the doors must have been propped open, allowing the criminals to enter. One of these doors had been replaced last Thursday, April 1:7,'. because its lock no longeF' functioned. The door was removed last Wednesday, and a student security guard was stationed inside the building that night. Students occupying all six rooms that were burglarized Satttrday morning said that they had teft their doors unlocked. · A student who was entering West College around the time 6f the crimes provided a partial description of the suspected thiefs. The case has been turned _ over to the Schenectady police department. by ANDY SANDLER On Thursday May 4, the Union College Speakers Forum will present John W. Dean lll, the former White House counsel whose decision to cooperate with prosecutors was a key to the unraveling of the Watergate conspiracy. Dean will speak in Memorial Chapel at 8:30 p.m. Tickets are _ $.75 for Union College students, faculty and staff, and $1.50 for the general public. Dean, the White House counsel from 1970 to 1973, transfixed millions of Americans with his televised testimony before the House Judiciary Committee. Readily admitting his own illegal and improper acts as a White House aide, Dean also implicated Nixon and his aides in multiple actions in the . Watergate coverup. He was a cruc~al witness in the trial of fonru~r Attorney General John Mitchell and former Secretary of Commerce Maurice S tans for conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury. · Dean himself served a four- month sentence for his part in the Watergate coverup.

Dave or 'Wags' as he was better known to the Brothers of Delta Phi, was a history major at Union. He became a member of Delta Phi Fraternity in 1973. Dave will best be remembered for his love of both the outdoors and sports. In his three years at the house, he was involved in every intramural team that we fielded. Last fall term, he captained our fla~-foot- . ball team to * cl'tampionship. Wags was due to graduate in three weeks and resume work in Mt. McK.inley Nat.ional Park in Alaska. His. loss has saddened all the Brothers., n&t ()-nly because he was a good frietl.d, but a true brother in all senses of the word. In his menrory ... the Brothers of delta P'hi hme decided to establish a memorial fund in his name. All dona.tions to this fund will be used to purchase a trophy 1978 to be given annually to the best overall athlete in intrartlurals and to plant a garden in Wags' name. Those people interested in contributing to thili fund should contact Jeff Laniewski or John . Foehl at Delta Phi. The Brothers would also llKe to express their sincerest thanks to the entire campus community for moral support during this past week. ' CltlM Bcde - always a popular event. Pan Hellenic On May 9th, elections for student representatives will be held, and presently 5 candidates for the positions of Student Body President, Vice President and Secretary, are fraternities· members. The fraternity and sorority system on the Union College campus is a valuable and distinctive contributor to the College community and deserves representation in student govern- ment. It is often argued that independents are unqualified to represent fraternity views. Regardless of whether this position holds merit or not, it is nonetheless accurate to say that student representatives who are fraternity members are better equipped to handle fraternity af- fairs and understand fraternity problems. This is why the Pan- Hellenic Counsel urges each and every fraternity member to cast his vote on Tuesday, and not permit the fraternity voice to lay dormant for another year. Below, are listed the candidates who are fraternity affiliated and their respective offices: Student Body President David Schmertz, Beta Theta Pi Jq,!ln Bonventure, Sigma Chi Stev~ Richards, fiji Secretary Je~~ ~ound, Beta Theta Pi · '··, · · Vice President SiJ410a ~hi.

Last year's \Bake\ was a record- breaker, establishing an attendance record of over 1000, a beer consumption record .of 44 kegs, and a proceeds for charity record of $1000.00. This year's prQceeds are going to three charities. Half of the proceeds will be going to Sigma Chi's national charity, Wallace Village for minimally retarded children. Two local charities have been chosen to divide the rest of the proceeds. Half will go towards an audiometer .for the Carver Community Center while the remainder will go to the Big Brothers/Big Sisters, both in . Schenectady.

With Mr. McCreesh on fiddle and vocals, Mr. Michael on guitar, vocals, mandolin, and a dulcimer affectionately called \Fred\ and Mr. Campbell on acoustic bass, the trio provided a most entertaining evening of folk, bluegrass, and traditional musical styles. The serious and the light were juggled admirably to sink into unabashed levity of overfulfilling seriousness. Each instrumentalist was quite capable and at times exceptional with McCreesh turning in sparkling fiddle solos and Michael countering with tricky \Fred\ runs. Vincent J. Scully, Jr., one of the country's leading ·architec- tural historians and critics, will deliver the Walter C. Baker Lecture in Art and Civilization at Union College at 8 p.m. Friday, May 5 in Room 016, Social Sciences Buildin-g. The lecture is free, and the public is invited. Scully; who is Colonel John Trumbull Professor of the History of Art at Yale University, will speak on \Empathy Sign and the Vernacular in Modern Architecture.'' A scholar whose work covers both a·ncient and modeTn architecture, Scully is a leading commentator on the changing design of urban areas and its effects on the populace. A popular teacher, Scully's courses have drawn as many as 900 undergraduates in a year_ He has twice been selected by Time magazine for their survey of \Ten Outstanding American College Teachers.\ His courses include lectures and seminars fo~ architects and graduate students as well as undergraduates on topics such as modern architecture, theories of architecture, art history, and classic French gardens. Scully is a native of New Haven, Conn., and entered Yale' University at the age of 16. After his graduation in 1940, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps and then returned to Yale as a graduate student, receiving his M.A. in 1947 and his Ph.D. degree in 1949. He was appointed to the Yale faculty as a teaching assistant in 1947, and was made a full professor in 1961. In 1966, he became the first incumbent of the Colonel John Trumbull Chair. His book, \Pueblo: Mountain, Village, Dance\ reflects his Songs of ment mcluded a George Jones tune concerning an old man and his love of a woman who dropped him like a house on the wicked witch of the east and a number of old country and traditional waltzes (\The Kentucky Waltz\ in particular). On~ luminous· note in the evening was Harly Campbell's interpretation of \Pa went to sleep and the hogs ate him\ which almost brought the listener to tears of laughter. Harley's betrodden heart was unmistakably in the song and his Ringo Starrish approach to his performance was a real treat. His dancing during one of the jigs was also a glimmering note, although a career in ballet does not appear to be in his future.

On \It's Your Love,\ the villain is producer Jim Mason; one of the finest vocals of Furay's long career is obscured by a haze of disco-fied horns llnd percussion. One can only wonder what motivated the cover of the r&b classic, ''This Magic Moment;\ the song is completely wrong for Furay's voice. As producer of Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, Dave Edmunds, and lan Dury, Nick Lowe is a central figure in the pop-rocking wing of Britain's \New Wave''.

Like Dury, Lowe often writes with t9ngue firmly in cheek (occasionally tongue is so firmly in cheek that confusion results· \Rollers Show,\ intended as ~ satire on . Rollermania, has become the anthem of the group's Australian fans). Like Edmunds, he is a pop archivist, with an easy command of nearly every important rock style . .:'Heart of the City\ is pure Buddy Holly, while \Tonight\ fuses a quote from the Beatles \It's Only Love\ with a stripped-down girl-group chart out of the Phil Spector Charlie Daniels~- The album is not a total loss, though. \Bittersweet Love\ is a fine ballad, a fitting conclusion for the lyric cycle begun by \Kind Woman\ and continued in \Crazy Eyes.\ The title cut is a well- crafted country rocker with a killer hook; it has the feel of an album radio standard. \Stand Your Guard,\ the album's best cut, may reveal the source of Furay's current malaise. Guest appearances by former mates Rusty Young and Timothy Schmitt, and a strong guitar solo by AI Perkins,_ provide a spark which is missing elsewhere; Furay respond~ with a performance that makes for a compelling eight minutes. Perhaps all Richie needs is to . once again work with musicians who are his. equal, and he will come all the way back. For now, though, one of rock's giant talents is, sadly, going mostly to waste.

A not her strong cut is \Everybody Needs Somebody.\ It's a really well put together . mellow song; Toy Caldwell makes h.is pedal steel guitar ·~cry\. \Singing Rhymes\ features Toy on vocal, and is my choice for a single. My major gripe on this album is \Asking Too Much of You.\ The vocals are sugar sweet, acoustic guitars are basically basic; this one will put the typical Tucker fan right to sleep .. The Tucker band has serious trouble . book. The guitar solo on \They Called it Rock\ juxtaposes eight bars of Chuck Berry against eight bars of early Jorma Kaukonen; the most amacing. thing is, it works. ' The album's teal triumphs come when. · Lowe manages to transcend mere rock historiography. \So it goes,\ the year's best pop record to date, is a case in point. The song's three verses are, in effect three self~ contained protest songs; they are tied together by Lowe's irresistible arrangement. Only on repeated listening do tfie materials from which Lowe built this seamless structure come to light. \Breaking Glass,\ \No Reason,\ and \Little Hitler\ all work the same way, and all work beautifully. Nick Lowe carries .himself with the easy assurance of one who is onto something. What he is \on to,\ I suspect, is one of the major directions that rock will take in the late '70s and early '80s. Definitely one to keep a close eye on. PAUL BURNS Coming Tuesday, May 9: The Charlie Daniels Band·! Pure Prairie League!

We like to think that if we make music that makes us feel good, it wil( make other people feel good.\ This attitude has sustained Charlie Daniels for a long time. Born in Wilmington, N.C., the son of a lumberman, Charlie Daniels started in a group which came to be known as The Jaguars from 1958-1967. Later, Charlie was brought to Nashville, ·Where he became active as a producer - most notably for the Youngbloods' best albums, \Elephant Mountain\ and \Rule the Wind;\ Daniels produced top lp's for Jerry Corbitt, who in turn produced Charlie's first solo album. He has recently worked with· Michael Murphy and has become the adopted fiddle player for the Marshall Tucker Band's lp's. ·Interwoven with hrs musicianship is the talent of a fine songwriter. In addition to most of the songs on his albums, Charlie has written songs recorded by Elvis Presley, Gary Stewart, Tammy Wynett, T.G. Shepard and others. By 1971, Charlie had committed himself to creating and becoming the cornerstone of a band whose only intention was and is to play the best of Southern music. \Te John, Grease and Wolfman\ and \Honey In The Rock\ - from· Counter tenor ; Williams J{}hn Williams, countertenor, will be· performing at Union College, Thursday, May 4 at 5 pm in room 202 of the Arts Building.

Since these early lp's, there has been a steady progression .of national success with the release of each new CDB album. The song ·\Whiskey\ from the Way Down Yonder lp has become a CDB classic. Fire On The Mountain with its line recording of \No Place To Go\ and \Orange Blossom Special\ is a gold album. Night Rider, , Saddle Tramp and High Lonesome established the CDB as a band that appealed to both country and pop audiences. Now with the release of the new CDB album, Midnight Wind, the group has . taken the next logical musical step in solidifying the pure rock undercurrents while maintaining the Southern roots that their growing legions of fans have come to expect. Throughout this entire period, from 1971 to the present, the band has cemented its recording successes with a grueling .concert sc-hedule: averaging approximately 250 touring days per year will convey some idea of how serious these musicians are. Lets take a closer look at The CI?B members. Tom Crain, .gmtar player, vocalist; Joel (Taz) Digregorio, keyboard player; Charlie Hayward, bassist; Don Murray, percussionist along with Fran Edwards, also drummer. throughout these aforementioned people that comprise The Charlie Daniels Band runs a common thread of pure untamed spirit. It is a spirit anchored around the music they all love and help to make and a pure enjoyment for life. Chal'lie has every right to be proud of this crew that bears his name, for they surely \ride for the brand.\ There's a story by William Gass called \In the Heart of the Heart of the Country.\ It's a great title and it might well describe Pure Prairie League. Their high, wild confident country rock comes from a place that's real deep in our musical culture; the heart of things, where rock and country and bluegrass converge. It's a happy, infectious unstoppable feeling that has excited audiences, warmed their hearts and got them up and dancing all over the country. Pure Prairie League is the best country rock and ballad band to emerge from the pack since the Eagles. Pure Prairie League took its name from a women's temperance organization in \Dodge City,\ an old Errol Flynn mov.le. 1'he group took its music • 0: - . ' ' - •. ' 1rom 1ts own roots, the region in and around the Ohio River Valley. Soon after getting together, the group was signed by RCA Records and two albums were released; the first, \Pure Prairie League,.\ and then \Bustin' Out.\ Their thir(j album, \Two Lane Highway,\ scored advance orders for over 175,000 copies. Eventually, \Bustin' Out\ went \gold\ selling more than 400,000 copies as did \Two Lane Highway.\ There are six members of Pure Prairie League. George Ed Powel, one of the three original members of the group, plays guitar, sings and is a major writer in the group. In concert, he and Larry Goshorn, also on guitar and vocals and a key writer, can be heard trading licks on \When I Get to the End of the Line,\ and other original songs. Drummer Billy Hinds, born in Covington, Kentucky, is an original member of Pure Prairie League. He, George and John David Call sort of held the band together in the difficult early days. Call is the band's pedal steel player, responsible for those tasty solos such as the one on the hit \Sun Shone Lightly,\ and \Pic kin' to ·Beat the Devil\ on which he also gets a standing ovation playing banjo. Michael Reilly, the bass player, from Ft. Thomas, Kentucky, was raised on bluegrass music. He is another of the band's lead vocalists and the high, lonesome bluegrass style is apparent in his .sin:ging. 'R:r-ill¥ also is beginning to contribute . some important original songs. Pianist Michael Conno.r of Latonia, Kentucky, rounds out the group with his expertise Oil. the keyboards, and because of the great · response from concert crowds, Mike is being given considerably more piano solos Working within each set. Pure Prairie League is a great American band. A band from the heartland that knows how to move. You can hear them on RCA Records; two latest releases \If the Shoe Fits\ and their current album \Dance.\ The new album includes \Dance the titfe cut as well as \Fade Away,\ \All the Lonesome Cowboys\ and \Tornado Warning\ among others. \Dance\ should prove to be Pure Prairie League's best album to date.

The St. by BARBARA SHUMSKY Mrs. Jeanne Swanson, the head of volunteers at St. Clare's Hospitai, along with Professor Willard Roth, head of the Biology department at Union, have coordinated a program which gives students the opportunity to observe procedures in various departments of the hospital. This non-major course, Practicum in Hospital Health Care, is designed' to combine supervised experience in various hospital departments with a study of problems and means of the delivery of health care. InternShip the course is now open to all students. Due to space limitations set by the hospital, enrollment is based on seniority preferences. In addition to the hosp·i!al experiences, an extended term paper relating to some aspect of health care services is a requirement of the program. practical application of basic ·testing procedures. I was shown slides of cancer cells and normal and abnormal pap smear.s. Other laboratory processes which I was able to see were pregnancy testing, white blood cell counts, and general chemical reactions. ! was shown how the intensity of color changes of both serum and urine samplings are used to detect various diseases. St. Clare's Intern at work with Dr. Grace. The course was originally devised to attract pre-medical stu- dents; yet due to increasing interest hom students with career intentions other than medicine, Each of the ten students participating in the program this term devotes one day a week to observe in an assigned depart- ment of the hospital. Every student vtslts a differen.t department each day. These departments include laboratories, pharmacy, operating room, recovery room, emergency room, RT /EKG and EEG, radiology, critical care area, pediatrics and orthopedic technology. In addition, the students are given a day of open choice. I spent one day with the orthopedic technician of the hospital. The day mostly consisted of seeing patients who were in traction. My supervisor, Mr. John Testa, the orthopedic technician, explained the .different traction set-ups for each type ot problem. .A majority of the patients had broken hips. backs, or legs. :_\d ht~!L ~,.J With only a few days remaining till Parents Weekend, most plans are now finalized.

In addition, anyone in- terested in helping out with the Outing Club bike race should contact Steve Matuszak, Box 594, Tel. 393-7568. St. Clare's Hospital welcomes their volunteers' participation in this service as a vital part of their nursing team. They believe one of the many purposes of a volunteer in the Community · Services Program is to provide a very important special touch that the professional staff would like to give to each patient. Because of limited, budgeted time, filled by other patient commitments, they cannot always provide this attention. My somewhat limited personal experience in the hospital has proved to be highly rewarding. Having had no previous exposure to most of the designated depart· ments, this program is truly a first-hand learning experience. I was amazed at the extent .of sophistication of the laboratory equipment and process testing. The lab technicians patiently explained the various testing procedures which are used for diagnostic purposes. If I had a more advanced understanding of chemistry and biology, I would ha,ve understood a little more, but I nevertheless enjoyed seeing the I have also spent some time in the pediatric ward. This was particularly rewarding since l was able to help some of the patients. i helped feed, move, wash, and speak to many of ihe· children. It is a great feeling to contribute to the comfort of their patients, and to spread cheer when possible. Many students have been brave enough to observe procedures in the operating room. For some, it has been the most .exciting part of their experience. Students are allowed to observe operations standing ~,tt the side of the surgeon who may explain the procedures involved. Observers are usually advised however, to research operational procedures prior to the operation. The entire personnel staff, doctors, nurses, technicians and medical students, are extremely warm and gracious in giving of their time and efforts. They carefully explain procedures and go out of their way to make our experience truly beneficial. This program has been, and is highly successful as it provides oppor- tunities which wJII never again be available to- most students. Healthy Diets On Monday night, the Intel· · cacine.

Yet, since everyone can vote and the individual elected must be able to deal equal•ly well with students and trustees, I prefer the title of student Trustee. l believe my experience - six terms of work on Concordiensis as reporter, sports editor, editor- in-chief, and student advisor, as well as being on the P AB - qualllles me Ior lhls position. hope to conduct more polls so students will be better informed and more involved. Working together, we can confront the issues · before they expand to unnecessary proportions. I view Union's immediate need to be stability. Until attained, all necessary forward movement wiU be stagnated. We mustn't take this situation lightly; our neglect may well be putting the future of Union College in jeopardy. Show you care. Vote on ~1aY. 9. Thank you. President Dovid Schmertz believe the stuelent government at Union College has yet to reach its full potential. Presently, the role of the student government is primarily confined to voicing student opinion. Though this_ 1s an essential function and one that must continue in the future, I feel that student government should not be limited solely to that expression. Perhaps even more important than the expression of the student voice is the handling' of student needs. With all the controversy that has been prevalent in the minds of the Union College community, the student government's role of providing services to the student body has virtually been ignored. lf elected Student Body President, my first priority will be to rekindle that dormant function. The role of student government I tee! must be two- dimensionaL Student government should be· the student voice and also be the caretaker for student needs. With a responsible and hard-working student body president,. student government can become what it s capable of becoming. lf elected I will strive to be that kind of president. Thank you .. John Bonventre The problems facing Union College are an outgrowth of dangerously low morale and a widespread feeling that Union is is. unwilling to uphold those principles of higher education to which it has long been dedicated. The faculty and the administration are too busy fighting to solve the problems. Therefore, the students must provide the necessary leadership for it is the students who are directly affected by school policy. It is too easy to say that student government has never worked. The decisions made in the next year will have such a great impact on the fate of Vice President Randy Feldman There are many important aspects concerning the job of the Vice-Presidency. The most significant of these is chairing the committee on committees; which is responsible for all committee selections. To be effective at this job it's important to be familiar with all aspects of the student body. In my opinion it's not appropriate to have one segment of the student body being over represented in the committees, which ultimately govern the college. My involvement in many diverse aspects of the college (i.e. class representative, intercollegiate athletics, etc.) has enabled · me to understand the differing sentiments of the students. As a result. I'm better able to insure that students from all segments of the college will be represented fairly. I will continue, as l have in the past, to inform all Union students of the salient issues within the . Mork Burnett The time is ripe for Union to realistically evaluate the future -of many of its pFO grams and policies. Many of these issues have been avoided for too long. or have been appeased with empty promises. l'he dissolution of leadership at all .levels throughout the college has hindered the normal policy making process resulting in very little future planning and tl;le misguided planning of this administration. For example, the strong emphasis placed on lAM· rather than the undergraduate curriculum We still have no plans for the development of the Arts, which could be begun by increasing endowed professorships. The policy of annual tuition increases to cover operating costs cannot continue while we use only a small percentage of endowment earnings. With the Middle States the colleg.e that student government must work. The President ot the Student Forum must be a visible force in umtmg and articulating the student's interests. He must be dedicated to restoring those ideals for which Union should stand and hP- must also be dedicated to bringing pride back to Union. I would be :such a President and l ask lor _your support. Chris Cameron For the past three years, I have been a very involved member of the Campus Community. Through this involvement, 1 have and will continue to learn the students sentiments. Union has experienced turmoil in the past. Students, faculty and administration have differed in opinions. These differences often promote intellectua'l growth. However, an unwillingness to listen and tolerate these differences have created hostility college. I will work hard for Union College because I care about the school and the people here.

My name is Mark Major and 1 am seeking the Junior Trustee position. Background information is always useful to voters. Last year as a freshman at Dartmouth 1 was fortunate to have coordinated ~ President Carter•s campus campaign. I served as liaison to the national effort. As I u·nderstan.d· it, the student trustee • ·is in a similar intermediary role . and ought to present student sentiment to the Board while also reporting relevant administrative decisions back to students. Perhaps a written summa.ry would achieve this. Mark Moior When seeking a position, he it a job or an elected office; one has certain credentials and hopes to and stagnation at Union. We can set Union in motion ag~in. 1 have seen the intelligence and spirit of the Union student when the situation has demanded it. I care about my fellow stude{lts and our college. 1 feel I can channel student potential effectively and provide the tolerant .leadership needed. The student body president can't make a great change alone, but side by side with an active informed student body can make a hell of a difference! I am a Student who cares. If you care - vote. Thank you. Steve Ri(hords This is a time of significant change at Union. We have a substantial deficit in our operating budget which will mean critical budget cuts that will affect us all. In these months ahead, many new· people will fill key positions in the administration. We, as an institution, are in search of direction and, purpose. This college needs leadership. The students ne.ed effective representation · in the crucial decisions which lie ahead. I believe I have proven myself as a capable, effective leader. I have served as president of my fraternity, vice-president of the Pan-Hellenic Council, and currently serve as chairperso11 of the Conduct-Ombudsman Committee and co-chairperson of Hello.

This calls for officers who are in touch with and responsive ~ present needs of students -- whether they live in dormitories, fraternities, sororities or off-campus. There are demands students have . in common, among them -comfortable housing and improved campus social activities, With less burden on fraternities. Such issues CAN be dealt with more quickly than we're led to believe provided Forum officers persist in, their demands and pursue them responsibly. My own experiences at Union have convinced me constant Ideally, a trustee ought to be we!J rounded.

The polling procedure used to determine the grade system change was appallingly underreprescntative of student opinion. You must have noticed. also, that the Freshman class has no voting voice (nor even official observation status), in the Forum. The time has come have co-covered the Forum meetings for Concordiensis and have hecome totally familiar with the extraordinary amount of problems and functions the Forum deals with. I have come to realize that being a Forum member necessitates a lot more than \just being there.\ A representative must be completely up to date on all facts pertinent to the coll'ege in addition to being ready to face the powerful Administration. As your proxy, I hope to piece together sadly split Union College in the future. be one of those eager people and Senate probably have no direct impact on you, academically or socially.

This is mainly due to the tact that the present governaf!ce structure within the forum does not provide freshmen with the opportunity to become politically active within the first year. However, l am not without experience. ln high school I served on all levels of student government, and while here at Union College I have ·been an active member on a student forum committee. This experience ha~ enabled me to become acquainted with the inner workings of the governance system, and thus 1 have had the chance to represent the ireshman class in some capacity.

Mondy Phillips My name is Mandy Phillips and l am running for the position of Sophomore Representative. I feel that I am qualified for this position after being represen- tative and president of a very active student government in high school. I believe that the Union College campus is small enough for every student to be active in the workings of their own government, or at the very least to be well informed. A true representative should help the students achieve this and of course should present its class'? views, suggestions and complai~ts to the Student Forum and 1ts committees. No college or school is perfect. Its problems cart only be dealt with efficiently by a hard- working and enthusiastic rep- resentative body. I feel that I ca~ . Stuart Honnos There are several facets of the college for which I feel: improvement is necessary. One of these involves the so-called \Student Center\ in Carnegie Hall. The mailroom and, to a lesser extent, the game room, are the main reasons lor students going there. One pos~ibility is to convert one of the upper floor \lobbies\ into a lounge. Thi~ would entail closing ott the spac·e, adding carpeting, comfortable furniture, and perhaps cable television. I also feel that the lottery principles should be revised. Students currently living off campus should be allowed to enter the lottery if they so desire . Renovation is also needed in the gym. The locker room facilities are inadequate; i.e., many lockers are non-functional. Also, the main floor of the gym needs resurfacing. Finally, there should be more money allotted for dormitory improvements. As Sophomore Class Representative, 1 will do my best to improve the face of the camp~J,s.

Friday afternoon Union competed against Middlebur~ on Library Field aad was met with a highly skilled team. The Middlebury women gained a rapid lead early in the first half. Fre~hman Julie Evans scored for Union in the middle of the first half: The second half saw a continued earnest effort on Union's part, but Middlebury's precision offense was unstoppable. Another Union goal was scoared by Lyn Bateman at the end of the second half, but Middlebury's consistent firing brought the final score to 14-2.

Monday afternoon the varsity played St. Lawrence in Weather that resembled St. Lawrence rather than the southerly Schenectady. The high winds made it almost impossible to complete a pass .successfully. Snow flurries lasted throughout much of the game. These conditions impeded all of Union~s efforts to score, while St. Lawrence was having much more ·success. At times Union's offense looked promising, with several fast downfield breaks, but it was more the winds that determined the direction of the baH than the thrower. This, combined with some slo.ppy tosses, lost the game to St. Lawrence 9-0. May 2, Union faces Casteltone at home for their third home bout in arow. This should prove to be a good match. Catch your last chance to see this team play at home on Saturday at II :00 against Russell Sage. After their loss to RPI and humiliation by Siena, the Dutchmen seemed to have lost quite a bit of wind out of their sails. However, they turned the tide around by stunning Colgate and Hamilton before losing yesterday to a fine Williams team. At Colgate, Union was supposed to be outmatched. Colgate had twice lost to the same Siena tea.m that had just clobbered Union, but by a total of only 5 runs. the Garnet then proceeded to .. show Colgate why games aren't decided on the basis of comparative scores. On Tuesd~y, both Union and Williams put on a fine exhibition of baseball, with Union coming up on the short end of a 8-5 score. Both teams played well defensively, and the game turned out to be quite literally a cliff- hanger. John Terry provided Union with a 3~2 lead in the fourth with a 3-run homer to left, but Williams kept scoring a run per inning to go ahead 8-4. Softballers Slip to 2·7 Union returned to its old form by battering Colgate hurlers for 17 mns. Leading the barrage were reljable Dave Adsit {3 hits), Trace Anderson (long homer to left center), and freshman designated hitter Dan Thompson (2 timely hits). Mike Hogan struggled a bit on the mound for the Garnet, but had it when it counted. He received relief help from Dave Ruff in the ninth. The final: Union l7 Colgate 10. On Monday, Joe Lavery pitched his best game of the season in leadi11g the Dutchmen to an 11-5 triumph over visiting Hamilton. Lavery scattered only · 5 hits, struck out 7, and had his best control of the year. Union led throughout, and was paced offensively by Adsit, who homered and had a handful of RBl, and Anderson, who also homered. The game, which had earlier been postponed due to Dave Chused looked good for the Garnet throughout the contest, allowing only 7 Williams. hits and· never really being hit hard. The problem was that the Dutchmen couldn't push across enough runs, but they sure didn't die without giving it a great effort. In the last of the ~th, with one out and the score still 8-4, Dave Adsit stroked a long homer to cut the gap to 3. After another out, two runners reached base and Joe Lavery lashed a deep drive to right. The Union bench could sense a tie ballgame, but their cries went for naUght, as the Williams right fielder stunned everyone with a spectacular leaping grab halfway down a hill to end the game. Although they lost the game, the Dutchmen showed their level of improvement 'With good baseball. Tonight, they hope that improvement will lead to some revenge as they travel to Siena for a night game.

Their record is 2-7 on the year. On Alexander Field, the Dutchwomen defeated the Siena women in a close 15-14 game. Union led off the game by scoring 5 runs in the first inning and adding 1 in the second. Siena scored 8. runs in the top of the 4tb to demolish the Union lead 12-6. Not to be outdone, Union came to bat in the 4th to score 9 runs and regain the lead 15-12. Dc:jil_ Schwartz led off by gn\'llnding out. Puff Downey singled up the center to score Downey. Murphy, the Siena pitcher, experienced control problems as she walked the next 7 batters - Driscoll, Kessler, O'Donnell, Sears, Yager, Wilde and Schwartz. To aid in Union scoring, Siena committed 3 errors and had 4 wild pitches. At the last out, Union managed to leave only one runner on base. Siena ·added 2 runs in the top of the 7th, but it wasn't enough to take away the Union victory. The leading Union hitter was Downey, 5-3, with 4 runs scored. Yager and Henry split the pitching duties with Henry receiving the win. Murphy got the loss for Siena. Mahoney and La Gue of Siena were each 3-2 at the plate. The week opened poorly for Union on April 25, as they lost 3- . 6 to Green Mountain away. Several costly errors allowed Green Mountain to score 6 runs in the bottoln of the 6th, Having 2 hits each for Union were Schwartz, Driscoll, Kessler and Henry. For Union, Henry pitched the first 6 innings allowing 3 earned runs. striking out 4 and walking 4. Yager .pitched the 7th. Faurot and Reale each had 2 hits for Green Mountain.

Tracksters Strong Despite Injuries- by ALLAN MOLHO With one of their top runners, Bob Moffat, only providing limited services, the Union College Track· team still made good showings at their two meets last week at Colgate University. Bob is still bothered by injuries obtained earlier in the season. A:t the Colgate Relays which drew many fine area teams, the Dutchmen made impressive per- formances in the events they entered. Phil Stegeman con- tinued his excellent running and leaping as he finished second in the 400 yard intermediate hurdles. The best coinbined long jump distances of E'arl Chilton, Tom Pratt and Mark Nazzon gave Union a second place in tha:t event. In the javelin, Union's combined tosses were good enough for third plaae and the best highjamps of Dave Cozzens, Cliff Rogers and Keith Crimmins allowed Union to grab first place. · Union did equally as well in the running events showing depth. without their usual anchorman Moffat. The 880 yard relay team of Ed Digman, Dan Flaumen- haft, Lee Parrish,. and Matt Guilfoyle in a first place tie, Pete Vielkind, Brian Liss, Kevin Scheuer and Guilfoyle took second in the .grueling distance medley relay. The mile and two mile relay team took third and fourth place respectively. The team was at Colgate again last Satuqiay, this time fo.r a ~ineet against Colgate and Hamilton. Though they lost to Colgate they were victorious over Hamilton. There were many outsta:nqing individual efforts which again dis- played, the .depththe teampossesses. Kevin Scheuer easily won the mile against two highly toUted milers from Colgate and Hamilton ( 4: 15.4 ). Kevin also took first in the half mile. Bob though, still injured, was able to run in the 440 yard rim which-he won (49~0) and the. last leg of the mile relay team which also took first position. Yet because qe did not run in the l 00 artd 220 sprints, it was easier for Union to be shut out .by Colgate in those events. Dave Cozzens had a good day as he had a second in the javelin and a second in the high jump. Although he had tied for first in height (6'6\) he had more tni.sses than th!! eventual winner. Other point setters for Union were: Jack Conner in the 6-mlle run, Dan _Frantz in the javelin, Pete Pettit in the half niile, Brian Liss in the 3-mile run and Earl Chilton·h). the triple jump aU finished in third place. Second place finishers included Matt Guilfoyle in the 440 yard and Phil Stegeman in the 440 yard intetmediate hurdles.

But Jeb Magruder, the number two man on the re-election staff. thought that an investigation into dirty tricks by Democrats would divert attention from the ITT case.\ According to Mr .. Dean, a team of burglars working for Magruder tried unsuccessfully to break into McGovern headquarters three times. The third time, though, in June they bmke into the offices of Lawrence O'Brien. then chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \They were looking for something on the Democrats to neutralize the adverse publicity about the ITT investigation,\ Mr. Dean said. \So they put a bugin O'Brien's office.\ The burglars were caught two days later when they tried to re- enter Democratic headquarters. \Magruder had otd.ered them to go back in,.\ said Mr. Dean. \He was unhappy with what they had done. And he also wanted them to repair the bug they had put in. There wasn't any conspiracy involved.\ According to Mr. Dean, however, President Nixon was briefed immediately after this incid~nt. It was at this time that the stFategy for the cover-up was devised. Assessing his role in the affair, Mr. Dean said, '•There was no douBt that I obstructed justice as counsel to the President. They tested me, and I crossed \that ethical line. I just wanted to do well. I felt important and just wantecl to prove myself. I rationalized my actions. l said that I wasn't acting out of my own interests. I believed I wouldn~t get myself in trouble.\ But a short while later, Mr. Dean said he realized his options: he could either continue lying in the manner he had been or he could tell the truth. \I realizecl that whistleblowers aren't popular,\ he said. \But I decided I didn't care -what other people thought. The only person l had to answer to was myself;\ In July 1973 Mr. Dean appeared in the special Senate hearings on Watergate, and coolly recounted his version of the Watergate scandal. During his lecture here, Mr. Dean evinced that same urbane presence in his sp~ech. When questioned after his talk about the ethics of his capitalizing on his criminal role through his book, Blind Ambition, _ and personal appearances such as his one at Union, Mr. Dean said: \l realized my mistakes, and I'll always regret them. lfs a sad commentary on this nation~s criminal justil;:e system that I only spent four months in jail. Some of the other persons involved in the Watergate scandal have tried to get reinstated as lawyers and have succeeded, but I would never consider that action. \I've had a lot of offers to make money as a result of my role in the Watergate scandal. l haven!t- taken advantage of them. l could be speaking every night., but I'm not.

On May 17th in New Y otk, dis(:ussion will inevitably turn to vandalism again. I anticipate that wh~n it does, I will be as deeply embarrassed as I was in April. Not in defense, but as a kind limp explanation, I point out several \fa~ that may be contributing to the problem. I describe the larger number of people utilizing college facilities which have not changed corres- pondingly. I also cite the budgetary history of diminishing allocation Jor dormi8ries which makes them look sh;I,bier than they ought to. l conjecture that this may speed their decline since they are then not seen as facilities that ought ~ be respected. I may even mention the tremendous press~re that students feel themselves under, and which . naturally win . sometimes ·be ••blown off' in' destructive ways. I've also suggested, that the presence of Dr. Bonner may contribute. He's the figure that most visibly represents the school, and since he clearly warrants no one's resp~ct the community's image in its own eyes suffers. In fact, the climate of tlle last 2 years has been one of laxity for · stan<111rds, bonesty, and respect . · the · administration has led all other constituencies in disrespect for these values and really ought . not to be surprised when those same attitudes reach students. After all, Union exists for learning; and it only appears. that some students are learning too well. ln fact, while a combination of these \factors\ sometimes can have a vague ring of plausibility, no one who listens is even remotely convinced. Any student's behavior is not governed by \factors.\ S/be governs it. It is the student who decides to break the exit sign, the window, or the fire alarm. The student decides not to walk on the newly planted grass or not to litter. Students are responsible for what they do and thus are responsible for the decrepit con- dition of some dorms and sections of the campus. No one from the city of Schenectady can be blamed fot the startling amount of dam.age that now · seems to be done rot,~tinely. on Campus. Yet 1 can scarcely believe that people of the high intelligence and character of which the students admitted to Union are .reputedly :possessea need to be reminded of the callous disregard they exhibit for others irt the Union Community when they ma'ke the grounds and residences uglier through vandalism .... Worse . ·Still is vandalism which mcreases the danger to people in the event of fire. \ Perhaps it is enough to urge that students bemore considerate of one another. Hopefully students need only be remi:nded to consider the consequence of an action they may be about to take. This celumn is an admittedly self- conscious attempt to remind. Please be tnore aware of one another. Abusing facilities costs students money, the use of those facilities, and the irritation of having to look at some object in an unattractive state of disrepair. The fact that in the recent past some students have behaved childishly naturally encourages observers to belittle the capacitY of students generally to act responsibly, maturely and intelligently. In my view that's an inaccurate assessment of students. nevertheless, I'm afraid it maY becorne more · popular if vandalism continues unabated. Union College has · afforded students substantial respon- sibilitY f()r what goes on because students have repeatedly shown themselves worthy of that responsibility. Vandalism is fun· damentally incompatible with that notion of the capabilities of stude11ts and has no place at Union. .. · Brito R.

Coinciding with this event, the Mechanical Engineering Department will be offering a course in Solar Energy engineer- ing next year. Forum'Discuss'es NYPIRG by STEVEN KLINGER President Gantz opened Monday night's Forum meeting by announcing to the members that . beginning on May 15 two people (not from Union) will be posted in the Library to check all students for stolen books. The measure is being instituted by the new Head Librarian, Jean Pelletiere, who eventually would like to have a mechanical device installed that would indicate when .a book was being illegally removed from the library. The next order of business concerned the recent NYPIRG poll in which 300 students voted for the organization and 73 against. The Forum had decided during winter term, that if this l\oll was favorable a binding election would be held. Therefore, Randy Feldman proposed that during Thursday's run-off a NYPlRG referendum, statin~ that it would cost Student Activities 8,000 dollars a year, should be included on the ballot. This prize is given by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The Daniel F. Pullman Prize for Engineering was awarded to David B. Kahn. ·Parents Weekend, Celebrated In the debate \Vhich followed, Murray Le:vinson argued that NYPIRG was responsible for voter turn-out and that there was not enough time between now and Thursday for adequate publicity for a referendum. ln addition, Alan Rutkin, repre- senting the Tax: Committee, procla.imed that Student Activities had spent all of its 150,000 dollars in funds and had by now most likely gone into debt. He also stated that Student Activities will receive an additional 48,000 dollars next year, but seeing that they went over their budget tltis year and that they want to return to having a 10,000 dollar emergency fund, NYPIRG wo11ld not be economically viable. The Forum then resolved that .last week's NYPIRG poll was \favorable\ and decided to vote on Feldman's proposal; the motion was defeated. The Daniel F. Pullman Prize was also awarded in: the field of by DAVE RUBIN humanities to Susan M. Cassidy foo work of outstanding merit in tile department of · history. Rebecca Allison and Viviart Rothchild were awarded the Joseph C. Doty Prize. Elizabeth V. Gemmette was awarded the Eugene f.

Sindy? E. Berger, S. Kristin Forsberg, Lisa E. Myers, Deborah J. Tuttle and Janet S. Wieselthier won freshman scholarship awards and Lee Ann Parent's Weekend '78 was a success.

Robert Klein has always been an intelligent man (pre-med at Alfred University) and this comes through in his comedy.

CONCORDIENSIS, Mq.y 10,1978 New Restaurant at Cabaret There~s a new restaurant opening in Carnegie. It will open May 17 and close May 20. Are we pulling John (Jane) Q. Public's collective leg? Nope.

The action of the play takes place within the confines of this restaurant, a small Greasy Spoon diner somewhere out West. And though the setting may seem mundane, the action is not. There are eight characters, and the play focuses on their violent entrances into each other;s lives. relationships. Finally, the psych~~; t~nsion he creates explodes into violence. Sounds intense? It is. And, if it d·oesn'l sound like · entertaining thrilling theatre then this article hasn't done the play justice.

Nightclub at Achilles Rink came to see comedian Robert Klein at his best while your parents (who could never appreciate Mr. Klein) were entertained by big band music by our own Union College Jazz Ensemble. The Rink rapidly filled with an eager audience that by 11:00 had turned into a somewhat rest-less mass and immediately following Robert Klein's performance, disappeared d.eservedly dissappointed at the end of the evening. While the evening c~n not be described as an overwhelming success, there is nowhere to place the blame for the flaws of the Parents Weekend Nightclub. If I may first turn my attention to the Union College Jazz Ensemble. Musicidly, the group performed more than adequately. I falter at the words great or excellent for one major reason. Acoustics! The jazz ensemble can not and could not be appreciated in the caverns of 'The Rink'. As one of the performers stated, \Any intricacies that were there were lost.\ The amplitude - try and sit in any dorm room with a stereo on. No, the groups musical abilities did not detract from the evening in the least. I must however, object to the order of the selections that were played. not even be sure of how good the written skit introdUction was because the (at this point) unruly crowd was not going to concede any more minutes to the oppposition. Finally, R,obert Klein appears and even he, despite his · super stardom and super jokes (and not so bad voice) could not overcome 'The Rink'. I miraculously heard all of Mr .. Klein's jokes and for those who didn't, he was funny! Mr. Klein was witty and clever and captivated the audience until you almost forgot that he was 'up on stage performing'. He made us laugh at the truth and the obvious. and left us with a smile on our face. What more could you ask of a comedian? Believe it or not, the parents liked him at least as much as the kids. At the end of his performance, I was hoping I would h-ear 1Il(H'e while . unfortunately, much of the audience was wishing they could hear anything at all. Mr. Klein is <;ertainly not to blame. He was worth more than the two beers one had to give up for the ticket. He was funny! The evening was not! The audience promptly fled the rink at the end of Robert Klein's performance and the jaz-z ensemble came on to play all the golden oldies' that you could ever want to dance to but, a·las, too . late. Was the night all that bad? No·! ~ For those looking for an enjoyable evening with the 'rents, it was a social evening of entertainment that m!lny found superb (almost). So, who do we blame for all the botches? WelLif we are to be so crude as to keep score, it can only be 'The Rink'-1, Nightclub-0, but why complain? Student Activities worked hard to put together an enjoy~ble e.vening of entertainment and at this they succeeded. l for one, will be back next year to even the score. Add to this still comfortable scene the catalyst; 'feddy, played by George Siletzky. With him is his girlfriend Cheryl (Julie Seeger), another ~quiet' wom~n.

Certainly some jazz pieces should have been played for their asthetic listening enjoyment but what of 'Stardust', 'Moonlight Serenade', and 'In the Mood'? History Proiect \Dust in the Wind\ is from their latest album, ..

In another cha.nge, the concert by Foreigner, first scheduled for June 17, has been changed to August 13 at 7 p.m. Almost all of the dance nu!llbers were played after Robert Klein's performance and after (unfortunately) almost everyone had left. The jazz ensemble is a fine group and I must give credit where credit is due. The jazz ensemble is forced to rent equipment, borrow music, and with long hours of practice, they have come a long way toward offering Union good jazz. They unfortunately could not overcome 'The Rink' and somebody must learn what the words ••for your dancing pleasure\ mean. lf l were to write on the next half hour of the evening, I would invariably leave the next half page blank. What started unsettlingly with acoustics ·continued into sound difficulties that supplied Mr. Klein with half of his jokes. Do we blame the 'sound men'? The infamous 'Rink'? Poor planning??

At Union, wotnep engineering majors have gained respect frqm their male colleagues, ••although I . still have lab partners who won't let me use the equipment we are supposed to share,'' Chadick said.

His topic is •'The North- South Dialogue: Some Economic Issues.\ · Walton· to Visit ' - ,' . ~· Author of a dozen books, and scores of journal articles, Prof. Reynolds has staked a claim to e;Xpertise in a number of areas within the field of economics. His textbook in labor economics, first published shortly after World War H, is still a leading text in that. field. His introductory text in Principles of Economics is popular at Union and elsewhere. But his talk Thursday night will draw on a third field, that of economic development and the economies of 'third-world countries. tries\ (or L DC's, in the economists' jargon). A penchant for 200-mile treks in the Himalayas, combined with the habit of observing (and recording) economic phenomena \wherever he goes, have put him in the undisputed position of world's leading expert on the economy of Nepal - perhaps the smallest, and surely the most remote LDC ,in the world. Reynolds will meet earlier Tht~rsday. at 2 p.m. in Strauss Lounge, with members of Union's chap.ter of Omicron Delta Epsilon, the Economics honors fraternity, to discuss the role of multinational corporations in economic development. He will also combine his appearance at Union with a visit to relatives whQ live in this area. Pfofessor Ronald Walton, Di .. rector of the University of Pennsylvania- Chinese Language Prograni, will visit the campus on May 15 to lecture at 7:30 (Upper Hale House Lounge) on ••Tone in Chinese: A Pitch for the Exploration of. Diversity in HWI1im Language~\ Professor Walton's major area of interest is Chinese phonetics and, within this, the study of tones occupies a great deal of his time. This topic should be of interest to everyone, especially to those already study- ing Chinese or those planning to start Chinese in the fall. It is generally acknowledged that tones are the largest stumbling block to westerners who are studying spoken Chinese. Tones have also given rise to the tlleory that anyone who can sing is a born Chinese language student. (The fact that more than half of Union's Chinese l~nguage students are in the Glee Club is mere coi11cidence! !) Professor Walton is also the Coordinator .of the University of Pennsylvania Intensive Summer Language Pmgram on Taiwan, and is coming to welcome Union College students to continue to participate. Last summer six Union students· spent thr-ee months in Taiwan, studying at the I nter-U.ni versity - Center f o.r Chinese Language Studies Ad- minis~ered. by Stanford University.

Twenty-four of the 48 prints in the Herman and Rose Burns Print Collection have been on display at the Schenectady Museum since March 18. The exhibit has been extended through MiiY 7. The collection represents dominant trends in recent art in America, and includes wotk of such pivotal artists as Joseph Alben;, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Motherwell, Ropert Rauschen- berg and Frank Stella. All of the works were \xecuted by Gemini Press in Los Angeles, which is considered one of the finest art presses in the world. Most are iithographic or silk screen prints. PHONE 371-U7l and all were made within the past decade. ln a recent lecture on the collection, art historian Edward Fry said the works are particularly clear reflections of contemporary art trends. Those trends in turn, reflect shifts in m()dern consciousness, Fry said. Burns announced his gift at a luncheon fer Vnion College trustees and other guests April 23 at the Schenectady Museum. 'Virginia Bush, chairman of the college's art department, called the collection ·~a generous gift and a substantial resource for our educational programs in the arts.\ Burns, who was graduated from Union in 1950, has been a trustee of the college since 1976.

Here were harrowing, delicately played guitar lines which at the time seemed like a cheap imitation of the power chords foun~ in songs like \See No Evil\ \Friction\, and \Elevation\ from T.V.'s initial masterful recording; Marquee Moon. Something was being held back, and it wasn't because I wouldn't take the damn thing to dinner. . . personal obscurity. l n th.e end, after the readjustment period and the \quarreling\, Television's record is a good one. Yeah, it could be better; but then there are a lot of accomplishments which were unexpected and therefore gratifying. Tom Verlai~e's doing something; and only he (at this point) really knows what that is. So just sit back and enjoy the passive beauty; this stuff certainly doesn\t hurt. P.S. \The Fire\ is arguably the best track on the album. Time works funny wonders. culture Student Photo Exhibit at Muse·U·m Art,in any form, serves to reflect an individual's statement about life. Such a statement is found in the works of four Union students who, with the guidance of Professor Rosenblum will open a photographic exhibition on \The Sepa·rated Family.\ The show isscheduledtoopen May l3 at the Union Gallery of the Schenectady Museum, although the formal opening is slated for Tuesday; May 16 from 4:~0 to 6. In conjuction with the opening Senator Joseph R. · Pisani, the Chairman of the Commission on Child W.elfare will speak ort the State of the Family in New York State. , The project was begun in the winter term as a group effort of four stu<ients in Professor Rosenblum's Photography II and TU courses. The four students, Beth Dorogusker, Barry Eagel, Sara Jones and Randy Myers conceived the project in which they would use. the theme of the Separated Family in today's society. Described as an individualized effort 11nder a group framework, the .students chose their respctive groups with in the ·family with which they wanted to work. These subjects ranged from a motherless girl to the elderly -placed in a_ nursing home situation; from a group home for uncared children to a local Schenectady family. The photographs were taken in the Albany-Schenectady area and provide the viewer with images of the modern fa-mily in local em:irons. The project was in part funded by the Internal Education Fund of Union College which gave the students funds with Whieh to work in order to get the project - off the gro_und. In addition the Ph! Beta Kappa Society gave the students money which they were able to use to fund the opening of the show. · As to why the students chose this topic as the focus of their exhibit, Randy Myers spoke for the group when he described his feeling of disconcert in looking at the family structure within the Schenectady community. He observed that many of the families with which he 'came in contact Within the community did not give their children, in his opinion, a proper. upbringing. As a result the family becomes a disjointed whole, never . truly existing as a teal family. There was also an interest in portraying the elderly, a group which is many times c.ut .away from the nuclear family and isolated within the confines of nursing homes. With the exceptio.n of Barry who had thirteen years pr.ior experience in photography the students had little k·nowledge of photography befor.e taking Professor Rosenblum's course;. They credit her with promoting· their interest in photography as well as aiding them in all ways in helping to promote the project. Her guidance in the matter Ca!l only be labeled as excellent and without her influence the students believe the project and the show on the whole could not have been pos&jble. The exhibit will also be on display at the State Capitol, the first floor of the Legislative Office Building from May 22 to June 3 under the joint sponsorship of Senator Pisani and Assembly Minority Leader Perry. B. Duryea, Jr. A couple of months this column ran in this paper, sporting the headline: \New Rock From Television 1 '. What disturbed my public was that the article itself had nothing . .to do with the band Television or the ignominious tube itself; and this point was raised at the last meeting of my readership. which, incidentally, was held in the maid's closet of the first floor of of Fox South. I had to explain that it was some editorial boob\s fault for reading the first sentence and formulating a title out of that knowledge. So, for all of you who have walked around for the past few months feeling cheated or perhaps generally depressed over the· matter, this is for you. Since that time, and after further list.enings, a vastly different opinion has been formed concerning my obstinate partner. First, the record is not inherently a get QP and move type undertaking. It is a highly crafted, if somewhat self-consciously nonsensical, · production. A song Profs Perform. For Parents Adventure, the almost brand new album from our band of mention. could be called a disappointment. Coming off a glorious experience at the concert down at My Father's Place, this critic could not contain his anticipatory ebullience for the new release; so when it was finally released I drove all the way out to Just-A-Song in Albany just to pick it up. It looked really proud sitting next to me in the passen~er's seat, on the way home aad I almost felt like striking up a conversation. After enduring the rush hour traffic and flashing the proverbial bird at a number of discourteous Schenectady motorists, my \.pal'' and I returned to campus in time for dinner. (After enduring the rush hour traffic and flashing the .proverbial bird at a number of discourteous Schenectady motorists, my \pal\ and I returned to campus in time for dinner.) Protesting all the while, I persuaded my purchase that it would be in his best interests to remain in the room while I fulfilled my daily nutritional requirements. Upon my return, the betrodden disc was found to be sulking heatedly atop my trusty stereo ... He'll get over it.\ thought I. To end the argument, I took off his jacket and dropped him on the turntable. Apparently, he was still mad.

Still, the songs are quite fantastic from a purely musical standpoint; and that might just be what group leader Tom Verlaine is looking for. The words here are a complete function of the musical environment. a situation approximating the work of synthesizer genius Brian Eno. Verlaine, takes that comparison one step further by fashioning the concluding section. of \Dream Dreams The Dreamer\ after the style of the Anglican syntho- freak. Other tunes of merit are: ·~careful\ which sounds like it was co-writte.n with Paul McCartney; \Giory\f which pumps the album open with it's infective drive and sideWays optimism; and \Foxhole\, which is the most liter~;tlly straight forward song, apparently dealing with a soldier's resort to idiotic romanticism in the face of an enemy barrage. \Fo~hole\ is typical of the band•s style as it rocks, it's well done, and ii could mean somethin·g but not necessarily so. What (he hell, everyone's entitled to a little Terry Heubert gave an excellent performance of folk and modern songs.

culture arttl An Interview With Vincent Scully by DELANNE STAGEMAN This year's Walter G. Baker Lecturer in Art and Civilization, Vincent Scully, spoke at Union last Friday. Scully is Cal. John Trumbell Professo·r of the History ·of Art at Yale University. His many books include The Earth, the. Temple and the Gpds and American Architecture and Urbanism. Concotdy: What led you to choose a career in architectural history'? VS: l majoried in English as an undergraduate but after the war l wanted to do something diilerent so I went into the history of art. I'd had just one course in it before that and I liked it very much and 1 just seemed, for some reason, to concentrate on architectural history more than on anything else. But l don't think there's such a thing as an architectural histor-ian, I think it's all art hi::;tory. Omcordy: How do you see the function of art in today's society and how has this function changed. from the past? VS: Whether it can be called the function or just the instinctive working of art, I think it's the same as it's always been. It's always been a fundamental libera- ting force for the human intelligence. . Art can be all kinds ol thmgs. It is not only painting and sculpture but it is in a way the whole imaginative, structural instinct in the human organism, so 1 think it's the same as it's always been, it\s the way we liberate ourselves into knowledge. All of us ask questions wiihin our preconceptions. We ask empirical questions within our emotional· and intellectual models. I think one of the best ways to break those models is through the experience ol art. Because Oscar Wilde once said, Hthe aesthetic experience has nothing to do with the intellect In belated honor of Sun Day or the emotions; by which l think he meant that our intelligence and our emotions (which of course are the same thing) are nonetheless always operating within our preconception of what reality is and the only way we can ever grow is by breaking these models. We grow like snakes ~ we have to slough our skins and 1 think a shortc1,1t way to do that is the experience of a work of art. lt can often trap us to conceptians that are beyond our preconceptions, so we grow. I think that's what it\ always been for. · It is pretty much that way in the modern period when it's a q·uestion of individuals trying to grow ontheir own, Concordy: Do you feel corttemporary art is more removed from or closer to people not directly involved in art'! VS: It's a problem of a mass society and an industriaHzed society that we~re not as close. to the environment we live in as the people -were in an agricultural village who built it ~:~11 themselves, in which everything re11ected their fundamental needs and beliefs. We op~rate in a much more complicated way in terms of packages of things that come to us through the industrial and mercantile system. So I'd say we are infinitely less in tune with what goes on. Our art is infinitely more problematic in relation to our lives. than it was in simpler .ages. Concordy: Do you feel contem- porary art is harder to relate to than is more traditional art'! VS: No, I think that the ·fundamental fact of modern life lays it upon us to be open. We've lost the good, old singk-minded oneness of belief and what we've gained is a pluralistic view of the world and every attempt that's been made to give that up has led to disaster. We have to accept it. ONL \:' THE SUN Day dawns like gray flannel folding the misty garden in a shawl trailing with beaded fringes. Trees make black embroidery in huge upWard stitches across the morning. The still cold morning that only the red disk, suddenly showing in the east, can free from tne drab cloth and open a chest overflowing with bright silks. THE GREEN THRONE · This ancient path has led me on, Beyond the town, beyond the field, To land that runs wild, overgrown. No man has planted here for yield And yet born lush are trees .and flower Alive with breath and consciousness; And I concede in this green hour To matter and spirit governing us: Fashioned in endless envious? ways The. atoms constantly diverge; Predominant, the plant holds sway, Without its leaf, man's life would cease. Here is world whose blood runs green 1 o where the creek flows crystal clean. - Priscilla Sanders:. The idol Poetry Reading will be on Monday,. May 22, in Hale House upper lounge at 8 p.m. All are welcome to attend! . * * \' * Send .poems for Firte Lines to Delaune Stagetnan, Poetry Box 1738. So 1 think the mai.n thing we need is ·Qpenness to eKperience, openness 0f mind. it's just like anything else in contemporary culture, Our culture ·so much impinges on other cultures that we really need to know more than people ever needed to know before. We need to have some kind of sense ol many kinds of things and it's the same thing with a work .of art. We respond to works of art according to our cultural ctJde, we respond accor(fing to wh;:1t we are; to what society and our lives have made us and the more we're alert to many kind~ of cultural codes; the more we'll experience works of att. The more we'll be closer to the truth. Concordy: What do you feel are the qualities that make a work of art lasting? . VS: f 'would think it's something that goes pretty close. to the. fundamental human exp~r:ience. Of course aU lasting is relative. The pyramids have lasted a long time ... They've lasted as something that moves us even though they mean different things to us probably than they did to the people whO built them. . · · Works of art may last by a~cident - they may last because the culture· that produced them ha~ lasted a long time. They're. sti1l there physically, but have they lasted'! Every generation that comes to a work of art will bring itself to it; will see it in terms of itself. I would guess that those things which impinge most truly on our human experience (as we know it - always with that proviso) seem to endure. Concordy~ ·Do you find those qualities present in contemporary art'! VS: 1 do think so. There is no doubt that in modern art there is the sense of the transient. Andy Warhol sai.Q one ol the funniest and most intelligent things, \The time will come when everyone is famous for fifteen minutes\ and there is something in that. Things happen fas~er and they go away faster than they used to. In the everall body of things, if you think of abstract expressionism and then of pop art, each one seems to produce its quota of things that are durable,. that do seetn to last. And it is a big question, whether, in that phase fr.om the late 19th century to now, which you might call the phase of a h.st taction, to which most of u·s us were deeply wedded a few years ago, it might well be . questioned whether that in fact is going to have the durability ol other modes, before and after. It's hard to know because it's not a question of intrinsic qualities since all these thin,gs · are cu:lturaUy relative anyway, but it would have to do with passing out of a cultural code rapidly because abstraction is so sell- referential. Of all the arts it is the most pur.ely referential to the sell since it does not have as many qt the resources of association as the other arts (representational art and architecture) have. Hut on the other hand it may have many associations we bring to it. To me, abstract art is really the Freud ~:~rt, that art that taps the self ... I mean . Freudian in a very specific sense, in terms of his analysis of the dream structure. lt's a question of his analysis ol the way the mind makes forms and the kinds of forms it makes. It seems to me it's very useful as a way to anafyze the abstract art that's starting at exactly the same time he's (Freud) writing The Interpretation of Dreams. Concordy: What type of relationship do you see between the study. of art history and the concerns of science and technology that are so prominent in today's society'? Is art isolated from the practical or not'? VS: I don't think anything is really isolated. I think they tap each other. There's a lot of architecture that makes a kind of symbolic play with industrial forms. Naturally there's a connection in solar energy or something like that. There are in fact connections between actual technology and architecture. But in a way architecture's greatest mission is to make that all emotionally comprehensible, Vincenl Scully things like Archigram and so on. They're a kind o1 celebration ol ·lndu.s.trial processes and materials. I would say tht.:re·~ simply another clement ot the human capacity to make thmg~ out of.it people w1ll make art a~ they always have. _ Its other character 1~ the capacity to reproduce in scrieo. We have a lot o1 an that\ stamped out and that agam connects with our mas~ ,ociet) and democratic society. Concordy: Would you like to say anything about the l\iott Memorial that's on Union\ campus'! VS: What a wondcrlul building! It's a very beaut it ul campus, but would really tall apart without it. r his campus is really hallucimitingly beautiful, but that dark shape in the middle is fundamental to the whole thing, it pins the whole thing, gives .it a gravity. Otherwise those gray and white buildings, set as they are along that axis would just float away. And that big, dark thing which has that wonderful quality oi small columns within the larger windows which seem to pull down and make .the windows stretch. That happens in the drum above. At the same time it's very dark in relatien to the light forms around and· it is ver)' much a center, a power and a presence. I think it's wonderlul. I hope you can save it.

The Weekend, and the recent science arrangements they used were conference. Upfortunately the from such greats as Count Basie. concerts have been rather poorly Dizzy Gillespie, Glenn Miller, and For the firsttimethe Ensemble i Chuck Mangione. was ac.companied by vocalists. Becky White, Laura Masailo, and Louise Mehlman were the singers, and all displayed excellent voices. The vocals added a whole new dimension to the music, and · hopefully they will be given mor~ opportunities to appear with the band in the future. Unfortunately there were several problems which detracted from the concert. Besides the fact that the rink has poor acoustics, few people in the audience danced when they were invited to. Along with this only about 75 people remained after Klein's performance, when the band came back and played for another whole hour. Those who stayed certainly heard more good music though. The Ensemble .(Without the use of microphones) played such tunes as \If and \String oi Pearls,\ and many of those still in the audience danced. Thus even with the problems that were encountered, the concert must be considered a success. If nothing else the band showed 4500 people that Union has its very own talented Jazz Ensemble capable of playing a wide range of music. With that in mind one can only hope to see a larger turnout ate · their future concerts. ' ....._ . } -, ' f ' \·

The Board received the news of Bonner's Resignation with mixed emotions and concern for Union's future. order of Business before the Trustees was to organize a search for a new President for Union College and that he would appoint .a committee of TrUstees to conduct the search. He also said that he would ask the admin- istration · to coordinate the formation of a Campus Advising and Screening Committee through which campus opinions and suggestions concerning a new President could be made available to the Board of Trustees. In the interim, the Trustees will, in due course, name an acting president. The next meeting of the Board of Trustees will o<:c\,lr in late June, after graduation. At that time it is expected that some report from the committee will be available, and sorne decisions ·about Union's immediate leadership will be made. surrounding, among others, the 6'(Jckey coach and his entire program as well as the Admissions Office and its Director. Quickly, these contro- versies engulfed most aspects of the Administration. The resulting publicity and unanswered ques- tions did much to weaken the office of the President and Union College as a whole. These created what Bonner himself ha~ called .. a climate of. fear and anxiety.\ This climate continued fol- lowing the summer recess and eventually led to the departure of much of the Administration. Provost, Willard Enteman; Dean of 'Students, Mark Smith; Director of Housing, Suzanne Dowling; and Director of the Office of Career Counseling and Placement, Susanna Miller, have all left the school since October with manv other Ad'nijnistrai!Ve tunwvers occurring during the first three years of Bonner's Reign. All of these events certainly must have led to Dr. Bonner's decision that \lt is time for a c.hange in leadership at Union.\ In choosing Wayne State, Bonner stated: \I look forward to returning to a major public University that is committed to both high quality and wide access. Wayne is a comprehensive university of fourteen colleges, 40;000 students and a broad range of studies, in- cluding 42 doctoral programs and professional degrees in medicine, law, engineering, business and other fields.\ It has been learned that Dr. Bonner was a strong candidate for the presidency of no less than two other institutions nationwide in addition to Wayne Continued on Page 4 Thomas Bonner, Union's 15th president, leaves ajier 4 years. Doctor Richard G.

He advised that Dr. Hazzard, chairman of the Review Committee had .suffered a mild heart attack and that the final presentation of the report has been delayed. He did state that the preliminary findings of the Review Committee indicated that they reaffirm the curr~nt directions· of the college while indicating that current programs and procedures require further study and prabably some revision.

The endowment income combined with the position and budget savings provide for $160,000 to meet the proposed budget expenditures lor next year, These include $25,000 for special projects out of the Physical Plant, $30,000 for the completion of the fire monitering system, $18,000 to bring IEF funding to $100,000 (1.33 percent of tuition), $75,000 for the Achilles Rink deficit and $12,000 for the preliminary budget defic.it. I his total, $160,000, matches the proposed revenue findings and .formulates the balanced budget. I'he budget was presented to the Administrative Cabinet tor comment and revision, however it is expected .that the budget will pass through the executive committee. The balanced budget hinges upon the Board of Trustees allowing the school to use an additional $100,000 of endowment earnings. This is still within the limits of endowment earning and does not cut into the capital. Initially, the school was allowed to spend about $1,400,000 of the earnings. However, in light of the Trustees' request for campus maintenance, the usage of $1,500,000 of endowment earnings seemed appropriate to the committee.

Clearly, turnovers such as these cannot be good for the school at all. There presently exists such a small extent of continuity within the Administration that many programs .(the Honors College and the lEI:-- to name two) get bogged down to a certain extent because of changing ideas ol changing people. Obviously, all of Union's ills cannot be blamed on Dr. Bonner, yet to a certain degree all actions taken by his administration are a rel1ectiori on the President. ·1 he departure o1 President Bonner does not solve all ol I.J n10n\ problems b)' any means; but hopeiull), the school can work together lo1 mutual gain and rc::.tore to Lnion some ol the continuuy and elltciew.:y that once charactcrued tlu~ institution. Concordiensis would like to take thi:. opportunity to wish Dr. and Mrs. Bonner the hest ot luck in all ol their luture endeavors in Michigan. Transition > Alter four year> ot turmo11· and unrc~t. an era ot Union College'~ history has come to an abrupt end. ·1 he event. wh.1ch many had been anticipating smce late la~t week happened unceromoniously. While. many had been expecting the President to call ·a pres~ conferenct:; with all ul the local media looking tor ari angle to out scoop their competiton., the new~ ol hi:. resignation came by way ot his new employer's announcement. OJ course, confirmation was soon to follow trom Un10n s l'Ubllc Kclations Department The point of curiosity in the enti.re matter is of course located in ' the timing of the resignation, Many had assumed that something would break before the May meeting ot the Board of I rustees. At Lhe meeting held today, the preliminary report ot the C!fmpus Review was delivered. lt seems reasonable to conclude· that the findings of the committee may have played an important role in the decision of President Bonner. At an earlier date, President Bonner may have been informed that the Review Committee's findings were developing strongly against him, and tfiat in order for him to avoid an uncomfortable position, it would be advisable for him to seek employment with another institituion. Thus with Bonner moving on to Wayne State Unversity, the Review Committee will be able to make its final recommendations with less emphasis and criticism placed on President Bonner. With this agreement, both the college and the president would be able to maintain respectable position::.. Looking back over the past four years, it is clear that Union College ·and Tom Bonner entered into a misconceived and untonunate marriage. .Bonner's initial .attractiveness to Union\ Community may have based on a strong reaction to Dr. Martin's dislike of Public Relations act1vitie::. and the schools desire to attain a very visible status. With the expected search for a new president, Concordiensis !eels that an equitable compromise between the Business Manager image and Educator appearance should be among the tactors used for determination. With Bonner's resignation behind th'icollege now, the vital role ol the student body and faculty must be co.mndered and praised. Many ot the initial improprieties were brought to light by concerend students working within the college community. A great deal of experience has been gained in the process, and it is hoped by Concordiensis that students will play a vttal role in the searching tor, screening ol and determmatwn or U mon's luture leader. Corre(fion In la~t week's editorial, Concordiensis erroneously reported that Dw1ght Wolt, As::.i::.tant to the Prtwmt, suggested cutting the IEF lund to $~Q,OOO. Although Woll did propose several budgetary adjustments. he did not recommend that IEF be cut. The possibility of reducing IEF funding was discussed by the P&P Committee,. and with the recent action the IEl- is funded at $100,000.

s r < .~' :· ' \ \ \ •, \ . . CONCORDIENSIS. May 17, 1978 Class of '82 Previewed byUNOSAY TAN A rather !!ketchy prevtew ot the treshman class ol P:J!:\2 1s all the Office of Admissions can oHer to th,e school at this time. A complete statistical analysis has !lOt yet been made tor this clwss and wiU not b~ Feady unlll the beginning ot tall term m September. Mr. Jay A. ,I), Shupe lH, foi:S), Union's Director ot Admissions, c1ted as one ot the reasons for this delay that the SAT scores have lor the lirst time been .put on magnetic tape and that there were some technical diHiculties with the computer program which prohibited the analysis from being carried out. Mr. Shupe, however,- was able to produce some of .the Q_ata that he had with him. A:s of this date;!, Union College has received· 540 deposits for the 5JO places in the freshman class oi 19~2. The Admissions Office target was 56~ deposits. Because they expect a summer attritfon oi 35 persons, they have sent out 10 more acceptances to candidates on the waiting list. This list consists of 2~0 .persons who have asked te be considered in the event of any vacam:ies appearing in the class. ln addition, 15 spaces have been reserveq lor the Academic Opportunity Program, and so tar II spaces have been committed. ·1- or those who are concerned -with ratios, especially the male to !emale ratio, Mr. Shupe gave t.he breakdown oi the newly enrolled students as 375 men to 165 \.\omen. I he ratio is lound to be 2.27 men to I woman, a ratio similar to the present college male to lemale rat·io. I he recruitment lor the 6-year medical program in conjunction with the Albany Medical College has been sucoesslul. l--or the 20 places available in this program, · 25 acceptances were sent out, 21 persons have sent in their deposits and the other 4 applicants have withdrawn. In the event that there is no attrition during the summer, Albany Medical College will honor the commitment to enroll the 21 students, although they have provision for only 20. Meanwhile, the traditionally weak 6-year law program has so far netted 2 to 3 candidates and letters have been sent out to alternates. In the 6:.year law program for this year's freshman class (19~1), oniy one or 2 persons enrolled, although the.re were 10 positions available, so the poor response was not surprising. There are 75 spaces available for transfer students to the sophomore and junior classes tor · next year. Of these, 22 places have. already been d~:tcrmincd ~.> the early decision transfer program, leaving another 53 places to be filled. Acceptances h:we only just gone out and tht.: deadline for 'replies .is J!Jne 4. Approximately hall the tra'n~lcr ~tudents arc expected to cor11t.: from 2-year colleges white thL' other half from the regular 4-,>•ca,r colleges. To attract freshmen studcnb to enroll at Union, 2 schoJm;ship awards have been c~cated. I he Faculty Scholarship, contributed by the faculty members ol the college and chosen by the iaculty trustees, has been accepted, and the student win be enrolling in the faiL 1'he other scholarships are the Dixon Ryan Fox AwaFds • which were given bv the admi~siQns staff to 50 applic;mts. Eleven to 12 of these have decided to attend Union. Mr. Shupe decbred these incentives to be successful. si·nce estimating a 10 to 15 percent return ·on a population of .50 applicants, any number above g ·enrolling would be deemed successful Speaking about successes, Mr. Shupe said .that the Boston and Schenectady accepted cancl1dates parties bro.ught the most number of new students. Whether they would continue to have this program, return to the Accepted Candidates Day, if the calendar permits, or have both will depend on the evaluations to be made during the summer. Admissions director Jay Shupe releases ske{(:hy pr()jile of next year's freshmen class. RSVP to Serve at West College by JIM DAVIS· lf everything goes according to plan, a new saga of Union food service will begin July L That's the date the .contract tor Saga, the food service that now runs the dining services in West CoUege and Hale House, expires.

Since then, it has received a new one year contract each year, l'he most recent one was signed August 26, 1977, and runs until But when he took the position of interim director of food services in February, Mr. Mazzone began contacting other food services to see if they were interested in running the concession at West. ··saga has improved,'' Mr. Maz~cine said.

Due to the low turnout for last luesday's college-wide election, Ra11dy Feld.ma n proposed lowering the amount of student:) required to make a NYPIRG referendum valid from 700 to 500.- The motion was defeated and Was replaced by a much harsher proposal which stipulated that more than half of the students paying. taxes (971 people) would have to vote;. tlt:is proposition carried. The basic reason behind making the election more difficult was the belief that if the Union campus really cared and wanted to allocate its money, it would turn out at the polls to support NYPlRG. However, several members made it clear that, due to voter apathy, which has been clearly evident in previous elections, this was just an\\'easy way to kill NYPIRG-\ In the next (}tder of business, the International Stadent Association (ISA) came :l>efore the Forum at the request of the ·1 ax Committee. Before discussing their request for inote funding; the clul;l's president described tbe .aims and activities of the ·organization. In the past ISA has ~ried to: (I) provide cultural insight >lnto the campus community; (2) integrate international students into the campus life; (3) give help with visas and traveling problems; ,(4) create a diverse student body and (5) propagandize Union abroad. In addition, activities of the club have included international dinners, speakers, movies and parties. During Orientation '77 !SA met foreign students a.t the airpmi and gave an orientation party to help integrate them into the campus. Next Yef!.r, the organization would like to have an international weekend and sponsor international charity work. However, when IS~ went before the Tax Committee to have its annual budget raised from $.1200 to $7500 a problem arose. The club claimed that it contributed just as much to the campus community as the Black Student Alliance (which presently receives more funds than ISA) and that some sort of paity should be reached between the two. According to Alan Rutkin, chairman of the Tax Committee, they would like to fund ISA more, but do not have the funds. Furthermore, he believes that to establish a parity betWeen the. organizations involves a value judgment by the Forum and not the Tax Committee. In the debate which followed, it was argued that every club is different and that it is up to the Tax Committee to review the facts and then decide on an appropriate fiscal policy. Yet, Rutkin claimed that the committee makes numerous arbitrary decisions, but that it was up to the Forum to make a value judgment concerning parity. Also, it was stated t'liat moving toward parity would be a long term project which would involve the lowering and raising of some groups' monies. Thus, the Forum passed a proposal stating that there would gradually be parity between cultural organizations within the Tax Committee guidelines. Finally, the Forum held a discussion concerning the Honors ''By that time, the food service operation here had become too large for the college to handle,\ said Mr. Mazzone, whose appointment a~ Union's first food service director was· formally approved by Union's board of trustees April 22. \The operations that we'll be taking over now are or smaller size.\ Nine food services expressed sufficient interest in running the West dining service to submit bids for the concession.

Uue to the low turnout tor last I uesday's college-wide electiOn, Randy Feldman proposed lowenng the amount ol students required to make a NYPIRG re!erendum valid lrom 700 to 500. I he motion was defeated and was replaced by a much harsher proposal which stipulated that more than half ol the students paying taxes (971 people) would have to vote; this proposition carried. The basic reason behind making the election more difficult was the belief that if the Union campus really cared and wanted to allocate its money, it would turn out at the polls to support NY PIRG. However, several members made it clear that, due to voter apathy, which has been clearly evident in previous elections, this was just an 4 ''easy way to kill NYPIRG.\ In the next order of business, the International Student Association (IS A) came before the Forum at the request of the I ax Committee. Before discussing their request for more tunding, the club's president described the aims and acti\, ities ol the organization. In the past ISA has tried to: (I) pro\ ide cultural insight into the campus community; (2) integrate mternational students into the campus liie; (3) give help with visas and traveling problems; (4) create a diverse student body and (5) propagandize Union abroad. In addition, activities of the club have included international dinners, speakers, movies and parties. During Orientation '77 ISA met foreign students at the airport and gave an orientation party to help integrate them into the campus. Next year, the organization would like to have an international weekend and sponsor international charity work. However, when ISA went before the !\ax Committee to have its annual budget raised from $1200 to $7500 a problem arose. The club claimed that it contributed just as much to the campus community as the Black Student Alliance (which presently receives more lunds than lSA) and that some sort of paity should be reached between the two. According to Alan Rutkin, chairman of the rax Committee, they would like to fund ISA more, but do not have the funds. Furthermore, he believes that to establish a parity between the organi1.ations involves a value judgment by the Forum and not the !\ax Committee.

Cynthia Barton, a freshman at SUNY-Albany, was the winner of this year's NENYYO Concerto Competition in January and will be guest soloist for a performance of Aram Khatchaturian's \Con- certo for Piano and Orchestra, ·• Miss Barton, 19, who is now st-udying with Findlay Cockrell, was graduated from Cardinal McCloskey High School, and in 1975 played with the Albany Symphony as the winrter of the symphony's concerto .competition. She p.lans to attend the. A~pen Music School in Colorado this summer, where she has been accepted. as a student of Edith Oppens. · Two other works are on the orchestral program: \The Saga of Lemminkainen\ by Denytro Sivik, and \'Four Dance Episodes from 'Rod'eo • \ by Aaron Copland, the centemporary compo~er who perf(>fmed ~,tt Union last term. Sivik, who is a teacher and conductor as well as composer, has completed three symphonies, two piano conc¢rtos and numerous tone poems, among other work.s, and an opent is being readied for production in New York City later this year.

Poor move! ... But there is still hope, because the show is also playing this ·1 hurs., Fri., and Sat. at tl pm in the Director's Lab ·1 heatre. Missing opening night may have been an oversight on your part. But missing the other nighb would be pretty silly. You've been amply notitied; posters, articles, large boards posted over Carnegie. Y au know this show is going to be good. 1 he story locuses on the violent entrance ol a violent man into the lives ol seven characters. Their reactions to him and their new insights into. each other create a tension that slowly unfolds itself on stage, within the confines of a small Southwestern diner. The cast is also excellent. George Siletzky portrays the- character of 'I eddy, a war veteran with bitter memories and a violent temperament. He creates a dominating presence on the stage. Julie Seeger plays 1 eddy'~ girlfriend. You're never 4uite sure what she's going to do. Mitch Blain and Ellen Podell play a well-to~do couple who appear to have a happy marriage. l:.ach ·portrays a characte.r with surprising underlying traits that they bring f~rth very ellecuvely. . I Viva Espanol! Barry Symonds is the carry-over from the greaser era.of the (ilties. Misplaced in environment and time, he creates an intense portrayal ol a yc>Ung man striving to make it on his own. Tony Ward plays Clark, the boss of the diner. <.:lark seems to only care about his chili and enchiladas, rather than the people around him. Gwen Heistand is Angel, the waitress who really cares abour everyone. Todd Miller port-rays Lyle, the \owner proprietor and jan.itor\ of the motel and tilling station. • John Rose is directing the play. After acting in numero.us plays, John is making his lirst attempt at directing. H.S. Grund is the stage manager (also his lirst try at this job). But, you have been told all this.

The answer lies not in the reasons stated above, but in the area which seems to be expe:tiencing the most popular neglect. That facet of this sonic curiosity is Costello's music~ which is not altogether ridiculous or unsensible as his appearance might suggest.

The material is either horribly tragic or excrutiatingly funny, depending on one's point of view; but in either case, Costello promises choice musical entertainment and/or stimulation, with all kinds of little surprises along the way.

The program featured traditional folk and Irish music played by Ruth Rappaport and Ray WalL The music included an assortment of waltzes, reels and knee slapping, foot-stompi~g tunes. the two sang a number of ballads with Ruth on guitar and banjo and Ray· on the hammered dulcimer, tin whistle and bodhron. Ruth, a '77 graduate from Union, was ,one of the major organizers of the Union College Coffeehouse. Now working at Andy's Front Hall, a folk music ordering house, she continues to play at folk music events in the area. Besides performing with Ruth, Ray Wall is a caller and dulcimer player for the Broken String Band, a group which plays at contradances and folk dances. Through the addition of waiters an~ waitresses, special pastries and Irish Coffee, to name a few, Coffeehouse has become a relaxing and different place to go on Friday nights. We've had special CoffeehOuses for events like Parents' Weekend, Winter Carnival and the ever-popular Halloween show. The talent ranges from Union students to fairiy well .. known performers such as Moth & Star, Bill Staines and the Roche Sisters.

The tune, \No Action,\ sets the tone for the record with these ensuing lines: \I don't want to talk to you/'Cause I don't miss you that much/I'm not · a telephone junkie/! told you that we were just good friends/ .. .1 don't wanna phone you/'Cause I'll just wanna put you down.\ This is the story of his life; as either the girl wanted too much or gave too little while he was giving his all or just giving up. ''This Year's Girl\ follows with its declamatory gestures and its sneering lust. \Those <Hsco sy.n- thesizers/ And those tran- quillizers/ All those body building prizes/But no midnight alibis/ All this and no surprises _for this year's girl.\ Here it seems as though Elvis has got himself hooked on a jet setter with non- jet-setter internal fortitude; and he chooses to capitalize on her incapacities. It's a behind the back, surveillance type of put down, a form which is evident in other parts of the record. In \Living in Paradise,\ he surreptitiously proclaims: \You don't think you know the who the boy i::; that you're touching/But I'll be at the video and you two I'll be watching.\ The song is a minor gem with its spritely little beat, as Costello once again proves that there are more ,ways than one to treat the woman who's done him wrong. Instead of picking up a barbell when he was just about ready to pack it up, as Mr. Atlas would have recam- mended, Elvis picked up a guitar and began to \develop\ himself through his music. The result of all this self- improvement has been the emergence of a totally idealist philosophy. \Hand in- Hand\ opens with: \No don't ask me to apologize/! won•t ask you to forgive me/But if I'm gonna go down/You're gonna come with me.\ FOR LIQUOR AND WINE . Try Jake lip stein's 464 State Street 374-1888 The girl getting this guy has got to be willing to suffer any consequences which he or she may induce. It's all or nothing; with the. consequence being that the ultimate maiden willing to risk it all is still looming in the realm of his imagination. \You Belong to Me\ reinforces this theme as he lays down these guidelines: \I don't want to be a goody goody /1 don't want just anybody /Saying you belong to me.\ It should be no wonde.r why Elvis has retreated to his seclu- sory punkishness. \Little Triggers\ focuses on communication once again. \I fon't want to be hung up, strung up/When you don't call up.\ He is trying ever so desperately to avoid that relationship that might change his outlook. When he does make attempts, he only expects disappointment. \Lip Service,\ he says, is all she·n ever get from him until she changes her mind as he spends anxious hour's sitting by a mute telephone waiting for that sign of reconsidering. His situation is paradoxical; he knows it; and he does essentially nothing to improve it. He could alter his standards; but that would only make it not worth his while. For now, he'd rather hang out on \The Beat,\ a bump-a-long bit of commentary, Where \l don•t want to be your lover /I just want to be your victim.\ Obviously, he gets ·off on rejection. \Radio Radio\ is the final dosage of pompous slopsism as he blatantly decries the radio format which would serve to promote him and get his message(s) across. The charging melody strikes a blow to the system, as he audaciously leers: \I want to bite the hand that feeds me/1 want to bite that hand sb dearly.\ The song is an open attack on \anesthetizing\ radio program- mers and their superiors. It is a furthering of the Costello principle which holds to something like \Just try and support me, and I'll turn it against myself:\ Indeed, this man is a difficult character to come to terms with. If it wasn't for his musical genius, it is hard to imagine him being at total peace with anything. Whatever the attitudes. This Year's M~ ·iS' ·bi.'RW mu&i(:3:1ly and conceptually a fascinating record. Rarely does one find an artist with such guts and such personal improprieties. As to what internally drives this man, only his guitar knows for sure.

If you haven't kept up on news from SOT, hete is an update. SOT celebrated its one year anniversary on April l7. SDT, the. first .sorority at Union has had what can be termed an eventful year. Returning to Union this taU as -pledges, the original seventeen girls of SDT had various req.uirements to fulfiU before they were initiated by members of the National Committee on November 1, 1977. These requirements included various philanthropic projects and the planning of tnany social events. One of the most difficult tasks was transforming · Oean Lichterman's house into a sorority .for twenty girls .. One of ·the stipulations for iT,litiation into the national sorority was .planning a pledge class. Getting pledges was both. a new experience to Vnion as well as a new experience to the sorority members. Formulating a pledge program provec:l to be quite complicated. Shannon Harper, pledge trainer, com- mented, \The hardest part about pledge was setting up some kind of standard that future pledge classes could follow, and one that Opportunities for Graduatese by JIM JONES One of the primary concerns of important role in admission to Union college undergraduates is grad school.

Spring term marked the fir.st time that the originlil seventeen .pledges were aU present to work together as a sorority. This- spring -SOT has been an active participl!,nt in . many carript~s events. Teams from SDT successfully raised the greatest sum of money in the trustees challenge category of the. annual pbonethon. During Derby Day, third place was -taken by SDT. The prize money was donated to Big 8rothers/Big Sisters. One of the most fun-filled events was participation in the annual Chi Psi Beer Rally. S.DTs teams came in second and third. Other social events spons~red by SIJT this term were an anniversary party celebrating their pledge one year ago, a barbeque before the Charlie Daniel's Concert, and a band party. As each term has passed this year, Sigma Delta Tau has taken more and mote of an active role in campus activities and campus' organiza~ions . (such as the Pan- Hellenic). Next year, SOT plans to do even more than this past year as they continue .to grow and expand. by TOM D'ANTONIO On Thursday and Friday, May 4 and 5, Theta Delta Chi sponsored the Red Cross Bloodmobile's annual spring appearance at the Union College fieldhouse. Despite the weather, about 220 pints of blood were donated during the 2-day period, bolstering the dangerously low supply in the Schenectady County blood bank. Of particular note was the encouraging number of \first time\ donors numbering in excess of 30.

Both games were played at Central Park, with Saturday's game being played . in less than favora'ble conditions. The season's closers ended a five-game slump ·in which the Dutchmen failed to win a ga-me. Albany State dealt Union its most recent defeat with a 9 to 3 contest. Albany's five run late inning surge was Union's downfall. pitching, solid defense and timely hitting 'brought them to their recent success. In Union's only victories in which less ·lhan 1'0 runs won ... the haJigame, a solid defense kept the opponents und·er five runs. In the Rochester contest, centerlielder C<trm Gatta and third baseman John Terry added three hits apiece, On Saturday, hot hitting Damien Quinn .and freshman secondbaseman DaiJ Thompson led the winners, each contributing three hits. · Number 17 Trace Anderson, season slugging percentage leader for Dutchmen, slams one out there. During Unio;n's final 2 victories, a combination of Union ended their spring debut with 7 victories and 9 losses, s 0 mew h a t be 1 0 w the i.r expectations, but an improvement over last year's record.

BrQW:nlee, Dean of Faculty, ofu fered a substitute proposal. It seems that due to a lack of suf- ficient fWlding the ~teinmetz Honors proposal could not be impJemented in its entirety during the 1978--79 academic year. Considerable discussion ensued concerning the new three-part proposal with _James A. Underwood of .Division II discussing the financial con .. siderations of an Honors ,program. Theodore A. Bick of the mathematics department presented an alternative to the EPC-proposed Honors program. Discussion followed about the dean's substitute proposal with a provision for clarifying the Honors program in the winter of 1979. Rudy V. Nydegger, acting Dean of Students, wanted the Senate to vote on each part separately, but the motion was· defeated, and the substitute proposal submitted by Dean Brownlee passed 18-5. Under new business, David B. Potts, Associate Dean of Faculty, brougl}t up a change in the catalqgue tba,t dealt with - revision in the declaration of all interdepal1mental majors. · The change comprised the top three lines of th'e Ip pro_gram description which teacfs as follows= · \Interdepartmental majors will be approved by the chairman of the particular departments involved only if a clear and 'sufficient rationale is presented for the scholarly relationship among the various components of the major.\ . The catalouge version was presented to the senate for in- spection. There was no set criteria for an ID major and due to this, the rationale for the proposal was that students were abusing the system only to aid them in fulfilling the requirements of t}le course. The establishment of the ID criteria was presented to get students to think about their prospective majors and their relationship •. Student Trustee Brien O'Toole, though, motioned to reject thi~ revision on the grounds that it ''l\nnecessarily penalized student~. u O'Toole argued that tbe revision tries to cover for the poor advising system and iri essence, \patches up the SYIDJ>'\ t~ms of the system rather than getting at the cause-the nature of the present poor advising system itself.''

New Pet Controls from Dean Nydegger After long discussions with many students, faculty and ad· ministrators, it has become clear that we must investigate a new poUcy regarding pets. I had hoped that my last plea would resUlt in a heightened sensitivity regaj'ding the problem, and the asswnp- tion of responsibility tor making the existing regulations work. Due to the virtually total lack of respofise, suppOrt or apparent interest in handling this serious problem, it has become necessary to take some steps. Not only have animals contihued to run loose on campus, but we have had five people bitten this year. The problems the pets have created have become entirely too serious to ignore. Thus, begin- ning With the fall tenn 1978 the following regulations w.ill be in· stituted''and enforced: .1). There will be no pets permitted in on-campus housing at all. This includes fraternities and sororities. 2); The members of the private fraternities and off-campus students who have pets must have them on leashes le~ than ten feet long while on campus. 3). Pets running loose on campus will be reported to the City Dog Catcher, who will be instructed to remove all strays to the Pound. 4). Violations of this cede Will result in fines and additional disciplinary sanctions for repeated offenders. I am very sorry to have to institute such a stringent policy, but I am convinced that this is the only way to deal with a pet problem that has gotten way out of hand. · . · · R.NYDEGGER As I hang up the phone l fall into a day-dreamy mood.

Particularly disturbing to us was the llth-hom order by Acting Provost C. William Hurley t<l c~l the exhibition one hour befDre its scheduled opening. The Provost's hasty and ill-thought decision was not\ based upon critical examination of the photogr-aphs and the issUes broached therein~ but rather upon an unfounded f~r of the risk involved m displaying portraits of individual per .. sons. It was only through the benevolent intervention of Dr. Paula Brownlee and Mr. John Hauser that this unfortunate circumstance was not br()ught to bear. · The insensitive attitude displayed by Dr. Huntley in this matter is demonstrative ()f the general \benign neglectH of the Arts at Union. This lack of support of the Arts curriculum was well evidenced by the Visiting Committee which reviewed the role of the. Arts and its future potential at this in~ stitution. In the three years since tbe committee made its recommendations in its report;. the faculty and a& miniRtra~ on the AU..CoHege Senate has acted only to bottle up the report in innumerable sub-committees, tints cur· tailing any appreciable ad· vance in the Arts. Until the majority -.of the faculty and administrators on this campus realize the integral and iJn .. portant role of the Arts in a liberal arts college, the Arts will continue to take a ·baek seat to the more \pressing needs 11 of an instituUon fighting t() remain atop an increasingly C()mpetitive market for incoming students. It is indeed shortsighted to believe that the Qver- development of some departments t() the detriment of those whose potential capacity has not yet been attained will increase the attractiveness of Union to prospective students. We strongly feel that greater faculty and ad- ministrative partidpati-on in events presented by the Arts Department is essential to the perpetuation of a unified college· and the growth of the inteUeetual atmosphere at this noble institution.

A former editor of Concordy, a reliable source of information on campus, Mike may now be considered an individual with superior knowledge . on the wri~ings and background of the great novelist J~rnes Joyce, required papers. _The pa~r was special because of the specific allusions made, the .in~depth analysis of Joyce; and the research that was necessary to carry on the extensive .. in· terpretation ofJoyce's work .. For one full year, Mike focused his attention on the works of ~ames Joyce. From the summer of 1976 to the sununer· of 1977, Mike bought and read ,everything the novelist had written, · including letters and biographies by and about the man himself. Mike Rotondi teaches course deal.ing with James. Joyce Mike'll first exposure to Joyce occurred at the end of his fl!esh,. man year. His .second, and more valuable, exposure came in a course on Joyce's Ulysses. This course was offered during Mike's sophomore year and was taught by Professor Sven Peterson as a Comprehensive Education credit. The sophomore did rather well on his oral presentations and In September of 1977,. Professor Peterson was approached by an individual who' w:as fully armed with a . proposal and the knowledge to teach one o£ his favorite courses at Union College.

Under these agreements an in- dividual residing in any of the participating nations has the right to act upon any violation of 'human rights and fundamental freedoms, ·. '!luding the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief' that he observes. The Soviet Union has interfered with the functioning of the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group through the arrest and conviction of Dr. Orlov and has thus violated the agreements made at Helsinki. Cases similar to that of Orlov's occur frequently in various parts of the world: an individual is harassed, persecuted or im- prisoned merely by choosing to express political ideas, social criticism or religious beliefs against the will of the govern- ment, but without using or ad• vocating violence in the process. Amnesty International (AI), the human rights organization, tenns such people ''prisoners .of conscience\ and has as its ·primary goal their release and-or humane treatment. Founded 17 years ago in London, AI has helped over 13,000 \prisoners of conscience\ to gain freedom and has given support and assistance to many more.

In addition, he reread Joyce's material to tie up loose ends. Mike•s proposal for the course .. inclu~ed reading nubliners, Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man,· and Homer's Odyssey .for the first three (lnd a half weeks. These offered simplified versions of J~e's themes, styles, and philoS()phies. These three books are· offered in much simpler language and structure to prepare the student's un. derstanding of Joyce's Ulysses. The next six and a half weeks would be spent· on the enormous and all\encompassing Ulyss~s. Mike w'ould give reading quizzes, an optional paper and a final; the fiMl grade would be ·determined by the average of the two or three evaluations. Mike decided to alter :the structure of the course he had taken a year before with Professor Peterson. The introductory· period seemed a little too long and did not leave enough time for the more intense .(lnd powerful novel. Additionally, the grade for the course focused around several papers, instead of on a number of requirements. which vary in nature. The command of a fairly large amount of professorial power ha:? been an exciting and challenging l~arning experience for Mike Rotondi. He receives an unusually large amount of feedback about his teaching style, the information he offers, and the answers to. questions asked of him. He feels that the students respect him as a source of reliable information on Joyce. They are not afraid to ask questions or criticize his teaching style. Mike is completely responsible for all grading, all materialtaught, the making up of exams and quizzes, and correcting all material handed in. This is, to be honest, a massive amount of responsibility for an undergraduate senior to assume. Iu addition to picking Up ad• ditional information on Joyce's works through teaching, Mike also has had the opportunity to learn about the teaching profession. TOe toughest project lie has encountered has been the making of a fair exam. What may seem easy to Mike may not be easy for his. students. Mike alluded to teaching as being similar to acting. One can imagine the pressure he ex• periences with twenty of his peers staring at him for fifty minutes, four days a week. Rotondi employs several teaching styles that he has picked up from his other courses at Union College. First, he lectures from a \mental outline,'' more than he does from notes. Second, he comes iu at 10:30 and begins his lecture __ immediately; using his spare moments before class to organize the main points and important ideas for that lecture. Third, he uses I.D. numbers in order to remain unbiased while correcting exams. Finally. he lectures . for fifty minutes straight, allowing those who have questions to .raise their hands. Rotondi concludes: \Given the nature of the class, i.e. a liberal learning course where most people don't have much exposure to English, I havecdecided it more valuable to lecture for an entire fift;v minutes rather than gear the class around discussion.•·• Surely one of the most difficult and most necessary tasks in teaching is the development of rapport and respect between the teacher and student. As an tm• dergraduate, Mike Rotondi is at an incredible advantage in terms of the rapport ... the respect has been built up through his own efforts. By ANDRE 1 On Mol Congressma (D., 3rd.

Brademas believes the record 1s far better than generally realized. · The .new composition and. style of the posFWatergate, post· Vietnam Congress is the third element Brademas Cites. The members of today's House and Senate are significantly different than those of twenty years ago. House members are younger and newer to Congres~ (156 Fresh• men, \242 elected since l9'ZO). They are more intelligent, be~er educated and harder working. With this House it is not easy for either presidents or. speakers to have their way. To convince members today, itis necessary to rely on reason and persuasion. There has been a profound change in the legendary com· rnittee structure of the· House~ the chairmanship of some thirty to forty subcommittt:es. whe~e the bulk of the legiSlative work ts done, ha:ve been offered to Jr. members. Assention to ~om­ mittee leadership is no longer assumed by seniority. To: be effective today, a conumttee chairperson must act like a politician,. not an autocrat. Today's House is more _open, democratic and accountable .• The reforms of recent years have also extracted a price in the time and effort needed to get things done .. The effort to free the House from authoritarian tule can also, if not carefully im- plemented, threaten .effective leadership of the House. The final element in Brademas' new configuration is the decline of political parties and of party loyalties and the rise in influence of special interest groups. Public opinion polls as well as every day observations reveal a steady dimintitionof the strength of both major political parties. The two major traditional political parties have made possible durable coalitions of diverse but compatible interests. These coalitions have had the effect of discouraging ~ragmentation and encouraging cooperation. Political parties have also served as instruments lor developing consensus across the .spectrum of major issues. As the party begins to recede from its primacy in ·.our political system it is supplanted by !!lOre special interest .groups. More of these special interests tend to concentrate on a single issue to the exclusion of all others. To the extent that a candidate is compelled with such special interests Without the bulwark of party,. he will find hhnself pulled to extremes and less effective in serving the conunon interests of the nation. The decline of party and the rise of special interest groups impair the tasks of effective political leadership in the American democracy. be a bad idea to include these Brademas described special endowments in a new depart- interest political action com- ment, and subsequenUy they mittees as threatening to put have been dropped . from the seats of Congress up to the proposal.
