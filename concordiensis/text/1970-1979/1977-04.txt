'. I i, Volu01e 106, No. 17 - April 6, 1977 JJ General Ed. Unveiled b.Y Matt Nagorsky So ends the final chapt~r in the ten year tenure of th-e Comprehensive Education Pr~ram. Implemented during the mid 1960's when Higher Education as a whole moved towards a more open cmriculum allowing the students more freedom to choose his or her own educational diversity, the Comp Ed. system met its downfall with the Educational Policy Committee~s report on a plan for liberalleatning. The shortcomings of the Coinp. Ed. program have been many·, not the least of which ate irreg11larities in quality, as well as high rates of dilution and attrition to narpe a few. After carefully reviewing four major alternatives including the popular straightforward distribution req_uirements, the committee decided upon the program that would .. design a curriculum in genera.! education that represented _ our b·est understanding of what the· Union graduate should carry out from :the College.\ Briefly, the new proposal is a modified distribution system in which departmental courses are allocated among six major categories. These categories are as follows: A. Arts and Literature: BelieVifig ~·an educated pet!loli should be able to appreciate tfie aesthetic achievements and individual insights found in art and literature.\ Including some courses from departments of: Arts, Classics, English, Modern Languages, Philosophy. '.B. Human Behavior and Institutions: \An educated person should be able to evaluate and employ scholarly approaches to the ~ysternatic understanding of individual and social behavior.\ Economics, History, IAM, . Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology. the potential and the limits of such methods.\ Biology, Civil Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, Psvcholoi!V. · D~ Perspectives from Another Culture: . \An educated person· should be able :to vi~w self and society from · non-provincial vantage points.\ Classics, English, History, Modern Languages, Political Science. E. Symbolic and Quantitative Reasoning: \An educated person should be able to think in terms of numeric and symbolic abstractions.\ Computer Science, Ec-onomics,. Mathematics, Philosophy, Psychology. F. Technology and its Social Applications: \An Educated person should be able to perceive the . · ways in which technical approaches to solving problems play a major role in modern life.'' Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Engineering Science. Courses now ex1stmg in ~ompreherisive Education will be assigned to the appropriate category. Not all courses in e11.ch of the departments will qualify for General Education credit but there will be a wide selection of courses many of which have no prerequisites. To fulfill the requirements for upperclass General Education a student must pass two courses from each of the categories B through E and two courses from either categories A or F with one Continued on Page 9 Jay Shupe, recently implicated in Admissions scMdal.

It was unclear at this time what the actual charge of the committee would be. In addition, it could not yet be determined which individuals would serve on the committee, although the campus trustees were named as a likely bQdy. investigative committee. The Committee also urged no final action on Shupe's resignation until a thorough investigation has been made. · Professor Frank Gado, Admissions Conmtittee member, stated that it is unfortunate that the governance mechanism dictates that the selection of an investigatory committee falls to the Presidential Advisory Board (PAB} on which the president serves \since circumstantial evidence points to the president's involvement in the very infraction which is being investigated.\ C.

Bonner said in a press interview, however, that he did not tell Shupe whether to admit the student to the Class of 1980. Rather, Bonner said he merely explained his philosophy on the Continued on Page 9 Harkness Suspended, Reinstated On March 15, 1971, President Thomas Bonner. released a \Statement to the College Community\ whiCh caused him \great personal and professional pain.\ According to the statement, Bonner received a letter from \a NESCAC college President;' on the. 14th of March which informed him ''of a violation of our own . NESCAC rules by Coach Harkness last spring and the subsequent serious misrepresentation by him of the facts concerning the case to the President of Union College and its Athletic Director. ' 1 Concordiensis has learned that the letter was sent by President John W. Chandler of Williams College to President Hedley Rey~olds of Bates College, Chauman of the Executive Committee of NESCAC. A copy was also sent to President Bonnet. The statement by die President on· the Harkness suspension came shortly after the All-College Senate voted 14-8 to remain in NESCAC and not to go to Division I. Dr. Bonner, who had previously promised to abide by the decision of the All-College Senate was released from his pledge a:t the faculty meeting prior to the Senate meeting. Bonner concluded his statement by assuring the campus that the officers of the Board of Trustees would fully review the situation and work within NESCAC ''to ensure that the reputation of this institution remains one of honesty and integrity.\ Concordiensis has heard from reliable sources on campus that the violation which was a visit to a prospective studenfs bome, was then . elaborately covered Up by Coach Harkness in an effort to prevent ex-Athletic Director Kershner and President Bonner from discerning the truth. Concordiensis has heard further allegations by members c;pf the Union College Community that the \cover up\ in and of itself contained further possible recruiting violations and a ''lack of any ethics whatsoever\ to quote an unnamed source. Amidst all of this, including unc9nfirmed allegations of further violations in recruiting, Financial Aid and Admissions~ on Wednesday, March 30th President Bonner met with Chairman of the Board Samuel Fortenbaugh, Kenneth Whalen and Gerard Neumann. After consultation on the telephone with Trustee Ralph Bennett, they voted to send two recommendations to the full Board of Trustees, which meets on April 20th. They are as follows: 1) \that Union College shall give early appropriate notice of intention to withdraw from NESCAC\ 2) .. an Athletic Overview Board be appointed to consult and t.ontilaued on Page 9

Latin Honors In the p~st year, over half of the gradQating seniors received some form of \Latin Hor10rs.\ Cum Laude was set at 3.0, Magna Cum Laude at 3.5, and Summa Cum Laude at 3.1. Last spring the Presidential Advisory Board voted to raise the requirements for Latin Honors. Cum Laude was rais~ to 3.35, Magrta Cum Laude to 3.6, and Summa Cum Laude to 3.8. The Faculty approved the change. The new Latin Honors will go into effect for seniors graduating this ·year. However, questions have been raised about the procedure~ used . to the .Senate, ·why not Latin Honors? There has been a serious breach of Senate pro.cedQre and I hope Provost Enteman or Dean Jln;~wnlee will SUl!pend any Re~swu's move tc- institute the ~hange until Senate approval, if 'ibat is the case.\ At any r~te, Seniors who thought they were to r~ive a Latin Honor, or a particular one, have been rudely surprised. Despite the obvious procedural impropriety, it appears the new changes (or Latin Honors will stick. CONCORDI$N$/S,.A,pril ~. 1977 Page3 - to implement this change. ln a similar circumstance last year, the raising of Dean's List from 3.0 to 3.35 Was apprpved by the All- College Senate. The Dean's List change was not to be put into effect until the following year. At that meeting Lee Rinsky, class of '76,, a former Senator, asked the- chair about prospective changes in Latin Honors. He was told that any change · would be brought before the 'Senate. Senate Meets on Athletic Issues As of today, these proposed changes in Latin Honors, already being put · into effect by the Registrar, have not been voted on :by the Senate. Andy Koblenz, serving his second consecutive year in· the Senate, first as class representative and now as Junior Trustee, commented on the cltange: \I don't remember having V()ted on it and it doesn't seem fair to mandate a ·change in policies of obvious concern to many students without Senate approval.,; Matt Brief, former Senator and former Student Forum Vice-President noted, \It's disturbing that such a change was not voted on in the Senate. Dean's List changes were brought After cancelling the March 3rd ~eting, the Senate met on Thursday, March lOth at 4:30 in the ·Old Chapel. An overflow crowd was on hand primarily to hear the vote on the NESCAC and Division I issues. The March 3td meeting was cancelled so that President Bonner reportedly c<,>uld meet with the students and faculty one more time to try to convince them that his position (tu leave NESCAC and to allow the ice hockey team to play on a Division I level) was correct and justified, and to try to clear the 1)-ir over .his accused mishandling of the issue. No objections were raised over courses approved by the Educational Policy Committee at jts January 21 and February 4 meeting, or for the EPC's approved change of the 5 y.ear BS I M S in lnd us trial Administration into a BS I MBA program. ·Proceedings then began on four resolutions worked out by four Division Chairmen Professors Craig, Finkelstein, Le Clerc and Schick, and the Student Forum President Jim Trump. The first resolution was introduced. It stated that Union supports the principles and policies that (I) intercollegiate athletics is to ,be kept in harmony with the educational purposes of the school, (2) players are to be the ·Faculty Brownlee, who reportedly would have voted against Dr. Bonner if her vote was secret. This motion was 12-9, and Brownlee ended up abstaining on the NESCAC and hockey divisional matters. · representatives of the student body, (3) the academic authorities are to control inter:.Collegiate athletic policy and ( 4) the policies of NESCAC are recognized as expressing the school's relations to intercollegiate athletics. Professor Sutter wanted to delete the reference to the NESCAC rules which were attached to the 4 resolutions and mentioned in the first resolution. This motion lost 12-11. A motion was made that all subsequent votes be taken by secret ballot. This was presumably intended for Dean of Professor Sutter introduced another amendment which seemed designed to allow the faculty to take over sole control of interCQllegiate athletics. After discussion, the amendment was withdrawn. Professor Wells attempted to clarify Sutter's amendment. Added to part (3) was \Intercollegiate athletic policy is to be subordinate to all policies established by all standing committees of the College Seriate \ This amendment passed without dissent. Andy Koblenz moved an amendment to .part (2) which read \Competing players are to be truly representative of the student body and not composed of students offered admission or Committees on Committees to Accept Applications Soon BY MI~HAEL GANZ It's your turn to get involved in formulate policies and program anything from alumni relations to with the Chief lib\rarian. planning the callege budget.

Page6 CONCORDIENSIS, April 6, 1977 EDITORIALS Shupe Resignation In a statement read before the Admissions Committee last lhursday, Admissions Director Jay Shupe provided those present with a concise account of the events which forced him to submit his resignation. He cited specific cases concerning the acceptance of ~tudcnt athletes -· omitting their names for obvious reasons - whose acceptances were arrived at in direct violation of Admissions pl)hcy. He publicly admitted altering Admissions minutes and J,Jckcts to legitimatize those acceptances. Mr. Shupe then concluded his Statement by acknowledging sole responsibility for thmc breaches of Admissions procedure which occurred during his tenure as Admissions Director. Alter :'vir. Shupe had completed his Statement, Committee Chair- penon Prof. Joseph Fink!estein read aloud to those assembled a ''I ettcr ot Support\ given him by members of the Admissions s~aff. I ht.: letter 1s significant in that it made reference to certain 'pressures· exerted upon the Admissions Director which may have bt.:en partially responsible for moving Mr. Shupe to commit the above-mentioned violations of Admissions policy. Concordiensis cannot believe that Mr. Shupe would take the Iibert). ~oldy upon personal initiative, to violate a policy which in tact served to reOect his own high standard of professional ethics. Our skepticism is bolstered by the 'pressures' mentioned in his staffs Letter of Support. It seems apparent that such pressures must have been applied for the express purpose of bringing talented student athletes to Union College who unfortunately could not meet minimum Admissions criteria ... criteria which Mr. Shupe had helped define in the first place! Perhaps Mr. Shupe had received an administrative recommendation to accept those students who were considered able to 'do the job' regardless of their academic back- grounds. This is again based upon our conviction that Mr. Shupe could not bring himself to violate Admissions policy on his own initiative; in seeking an administrative go-ahead Mr. Shupe might have found a justification fol;' what he was about to do. Despite his deep personal misgivings, such a go-ahead should have removed from his conscience any notions that what he was doirig was wrong. And yet. his inner conflict could not be resolved because Jay Shupe was an ethical man who was caught in an unethical situation. We believe that it was his overwhelming sense of guilt which provoked his confession, and subsequent letter of resignation as Admissions Director. In our opinion, an unethical man would have simply committed the violation and said nothing unless forced into a revelation. Mr. Shupe volunteered his complicity rather than ultimately trying to cover it up, and because he did so, Concordiensis I!ll\St extend to him its sincerest sympathy. Concordrensis has carefully considered this p;i'rtlc:tilar situation, and ha~ concluded that a full, thorough,· and• immediate investigation directed by a responsible committee·must be instituted to define just what kind of 'pressures' were exerted, and to reveal precisely where they originated. As students who realize that an autonomous Admissions program free from external pressures is fundamental to maintaining the academic dignity of Union College, we expect no less. Towards The .Norm The hockey season is over. Unfortunately, the issues surrounding it continue to be irately discussed and debated, and combined with the widespread dissension of the college community, its termination is simply not in sight. The hockey players have been maligned for too long and the time has arrived to stop placing the bulk of the blame upon them. Who can possibly argue with their decision and desire to play for Ned Harkness, a man with a name exceeding all others in college hockey ranks? Concordiensis feels the blame must lie elsewhere.

Also, the issue has helped to expose many personal feelings, the result being a split student body, split faculty and disagreement between the All-College Senate and the combination of the administration and Board of Trustees. It is no longer only a college matter, but one far-reaching into individual opinions. The issue, which was never dormant, has erupted into far beyond what would have been deemed possible just seven months ago. The Director of Admissions has submitted his resignation after two now-glaring admission violations which were followed by a committee being set up to investigate him and to decide if his resignation should be accepted; Divisions I and II have asked for a committee for professional review to investigate the Dean of Students; the Hockey Coach has been suspended for illegal recruiting (under NESCAC rules) and was subsequently reinstated, with a committee having been formed to investigate him, and the President of the College has found himself in precarious situations from which he has delicately managed to escape.

The entire scandal can only remind Concordy of the situation that took place with Tricky Dick and his gang. It seems to Co11cordy that it is time for a total review of the current administration and, if the omnipresent problems can not be solved, a possible installment of a new one.

Regardless of the overtures of concerned faculty and students, there have been a number of incidents involving admissions, financial aid, grading and other areas that point to highly questionable practices with reference to athletics. Even with the rigidity of the NESCAC rules, the warnings of excesses are clear, without those restrictions... the NESCA.C philosophy will be . vio'lated even more frequently ·on a larger scale.\ Concordiensis, Jan. 12, 1977 \ ... there have been excessive transgressions of both financial aid and admissions policies.

Educational.isspes such as·repla(;ing the Comp. Ed. system and the Internal Education Foundation (which we heartily support) have been submerged in a sea of athletic and administrative scandal. Again, we call for an investigation by responsible members of the campus community. We urge them to speak to all concerned people, here and at Union, we urge thj!rn to have full access to all admission, financial aid, and budgeroty documents. The time has come for a cessation to Dr. Bonne(s .political shenanigans in an attempt ,to. rlll)l his athletic views. down '.,:: rcampus throats and subvert the govern~ince process. r~eTask Force . exhorted us to l'emain 1 in NESCAC and not go bivision I. The ·:····senate voted likewise 14.;8·.· Both times Dr. Bonner rlmegt!tl' on pledges to uphold t},tem. If blame for certain ••athletic scandals .. begins and ends with Jay Shupe, only his resignation is in order. If the lack of ethics and egregious misdeeds extends any higher, more resignations are in order. Concordiensis supports a thorough impartial investigation - even if its path leads to Dr. Bonner's office. An excellent academic institution has been tainted with scandal. We are neither Oklahoma nor University or'Las Vegas at Nevada. We are Union College, and there are some inherent healthy values espoused in being a small liberal arts college. If any administrator does not like that philosophy or doesn't care for ethics, we suggest he or she find different pastures.

Report of the .Task Force on Athletics\ and am inclined to agree with most of its recommendations.

Gentlemen, 1 suggest that the reason that these decisions have b~n made in· the dark that Suzy has her head firmly planted where the sun doesn't shine!!!!! 1 hope that these revelations will upset you as much as I, and that you wiU investigate for yourselves the validity of these disclosures. !he campus must be informed of the .gro inc()nil)etence a fi d inconsideration of our Housing Director {And the . housing committee?) Sincerely, An cfficlnl news leak Page 7 On lop of Things \ ... the whole hockey program which should be a unifying factor in the campus, ha~ become a very divisive issue ... The situation can only worsen until all the unanswered questions about admissions, academics and finances in the hockey program arc finally cleared up ... there must be an immediate and thorough investigation of the situation with blame properly affixed.\ Concordiensis, Oct. 20, 1976 \Union is becoming decisively split with two factions those who favor athletic expansion, those who fear a decline in academic standards that might result from that expansion ... One may disagree with our intentions but a truth told, no matter what the intent, is more valuable than any lies that can be invented.\ Concordiensis, Nov. 3, 1976 \ ... Regardless of the overtures of concerned faculty and students, there have been a number of incidents involving admissions. financial aid, grading and other areas that point to highly questionable practices with reference to athletics. Even with the rigidity of the N ESCAC rules, the warnings of excesses are clear, without those restrictions... the NESCAC philosophy will be violated even more frequently on a larger scale.\ Concordiensis, Jan. 12, 1977 \ ... there have been excessive transgressions of both financial aid and admissions policies. These abuses, moreover, have occurred under the noses of and have been condoned by people in the administration ... The President himself has known of many of these abusive actions and has done everything ·in his power to prevent the truth about such incidents from surfacing.\ Concordiensis, March 2, 1977 \ ... ensure that the reputation of this institution remains one of honesty and integrity.\ Thomas Bonner, March 15 in his suspension of Ned Harkness This is not meant to be an \l told you so\ editorial. Many sectors on campus are bitterly divided. Educational issues such as replacing the Comp. Ed. system and the Internal Education Foundation (which we heartily support) have been submerged in a sea of athletic and administrative scandal. Again. we call for an investigation by responsible members of the campus community. We urge them to speak to all concerned people, here and at Union, we urge thrm to have full access to all admission, financial aid, and budgdaty documents. The time has come for a cessation to Dr. Bonner's .political shenanigans in an attempt to ram his athletic views do~n campus throats and subvert the governance process. The Task Force exhorted us to remain 1 in NESCAC and not go Division I. The Senate voted likewise 14~8, Both times Dr. Bonner reneged on pledges to uphold tltem. If blame for certain ••athletic scandals\ begins and ends with Jay Shupe, only his resignation is in order. If the lack of ethics and egregious misdeeds extends any higher, more resignations are in order. Concordiensis supports a thorough impartial investigation -- even if its path leads to Dr. Bonner's office. An excellent academic institution has been tainted with scandal. We are neither Oklahoma nor University of Las Vegas at Nevada. We are Union College, and there are some inherent healthy values espoused in being a small liberal arts college. If any administrator does not like that philosophy or doesn't care for ethics. we suggest he or she find different pastures. union college • _. concorotens1s Editor-in-chief ........ .

Page 10 eporte CONCORDIENSIS. Apri/6, 1977 Lacrosse Looks Ahead by &OBERT GRUSl{EY Last year Union College's lacrosse team, in Brue Allison's final year as coach and athletic director, finished with a 6-5 record. This year's team has a bright future, ' as it combines experienced upperclassmen with eager freshmen. How well the freshmen blend with the rest of the team will be the key to the during practice. Sophomore Alan Greenburg; who. stands only 5 ft. 7 in., seems to have the inside track as he played in all eleven games last year and had 127 saves. Senior Steve Haddad, from Longmeadow, Mass., and freshman Randy Feldman ate the others competing for the spot of defending the Gamet cage. The Union defense will be the upcoming season. the first new face for the core of the team, manned by three Dutchmen this year is Coach Bill excellent juniors. .Kenny Beck, Reid.

Roundmg · extremely hard shot and should help with the scoring. The final group of middies is lecl by John Breault, who played well last y~ar. He is teamed with freshman Jim Broomgarden ·and Rob Sherman. Basketba.ll Wraps Up Season The Union Dutchmen finished below.500thisseason for the first time in many years. Their final mark was 10-13 and this was the first losing season under the coaching tenure of Bill Scanlon here. The season was actually divided into threce stanzas as Union got off to a l-6 start in which Union showed some dismal shooting from the floor. The Dutchmen did not finish off the season too well either winding up with three straight losses. In betwen though, Union ran off a string of nine wins in thirteen outings. Coach Scanlon lost two of his starters very early in the season when big cenfer Roger S ymonnette was lost to academics and guard Mark Rekucki was lost for most of the season with an injury. This necessitated an increase in the playing time of K.. R. Marshall and Steve Nearpass. Given the opportunity, these two players handled themselves very well and should improve in the years to come. The standout ballplayer for Union this season without a dou~t was junior center Mike Smith. Smith led the ballclub in scoring and shootin~ percentage and was second on the team in rebounds and assists. Judging by his statistics, it is apparent that Smith is a complete ballplayer &yldom taking a bad shot or hurting Union with a bad play. Peter Meola also played very well this season, primarily coming off the bench. Meola still managed to score ovet 13 points per game. Next season, in addition to Meola; Union will lose Gary Borgese, Al Walder, and Clete McL~ughlin. Borgese directed the Union attack and led the ballclub in assists. Walker led the ballclub in rebounds and McLaughlin led in free throw ,shooting. The outlook for next season will probably depend upon next year's group of freshmen. Smith and Marshall should improve up front as should Rekucki and Nelupass in the backcourt. The major problem should be depth but that remains to be seen. ~------------------------~----~--------------~ UNION COLLEGE FINAL BASKETBALL STATISTICS Name FG FT REB Pts.

The appointment was announced by, Craig Carlson, Union's director of athletics. Coach Barta will also coach women's softball and volleyball in her initial year at Union. However, Mr. Carlson said a second women's coach will be appointed this spring and she will .eventually assume the coaching duties of either softball or volleyball. Coach Barta, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin, is from Buffalo. She has coached at Dunkirk High School in Dunkirk, N.Y., and later coached at.. William Penn High School in Philadelphia. She took over the women's basketball reins at Philadelphia Textile two years ago and finished with a record of 2-10. In the recently~oncluded season her team won nine and lost four .

One of Coach Reid's philosophies can be seen in the mid-field. He has decided to go with four balanced lines as opposed to stacking his best players in the first two mid-fields. It is here that he is gambling with the freshmen. The hope is that Union will have fresh players in the game at all times which will make them particularly strong in the later .stages of the match. The first mid-field is led by junior Ray Stecker. Ray, who comes from Hamilton, Mass., was last year's leading scorer with 37 goals and fourteen assists for 51 points. The attack begins with junior Jed Kanner, who finished second in scoring with 47 points on 23 goals and a team high 24 assists. Following in scoring was John Thompson, who had 23 goals and 19 assists for 42 points. Rounding out this fine unit is Stu Napear, who had lO goals and 10 assists for 20 points last year. They are backed up by Senior Hank Fleming, who had 17 points last season, and Neil Kamer. The. team's first home game is on April 13th at 3:30,p.m. against Siena College.

With this first round victory behind With this second resounding victory, Union reached the finals, an amazing feat for a team with 1only freshmen and sophomores. Their opponent was to be Merrimack, who had previously defeated Elmira (5-l) and tournament surprise Lowell (6-2). The Warriors had also edged Union earlier fn the season at Achilles Rink, 4-3, when a late Dutchmen rally fell short and still had the good memQries of a 5-l defeat they had .pasted on the Union six the previous season.

The game was not nearly as close as the margin of victory which was a healthy six goals. Union totally outskated and outchecked their opponents, winning easily by the final tally of 12-6. Freshman right wing Chuck Pappas led the Union attack scoring three times, twice in the second period when the Dutchmen took the lead they would enever relinquish. The stalwart effort by the team is reflected by the fact that each line scored at least once, led by the Pappas, Dean Willers and Kevin Kardos trio which registered six. Once again, Union's .skating ability told the story as the Dutchmen tallied six times in the final period to put the game on ice. Only two Salem State goals in the final minute prevented a tot!ll embarrassment. Goalie Steve Baker, who was playing in his tenth consecutive game, faced a bamge of shots and was superb when it counted, despite the six goals against. When the Dutchmen skated on the 8 · 3 goals per game Union had become accustomed to scoring. to Army's Smith Rink, they were The Dutchmen also soon found greeted by a large contingent of that the Warrior attack was quite Union rooters, making them feel potent itself as Merrimack took as if the game was being played in advantage of two Union defensive Achilles Rink.

'' · '· · · · ' . . . '\• Rankin, who is the steadying influence on the young Union team is a rock of gibraltar on defense, using stiff body checks and leading the team in ,blocked shots during both his years at Union. Churchill, the team'!! leading sc9rer for the second straight year;,joined Rankin as the only newc·omers·to the ECAC first team and were ~he only players selected from the._, same. college. The otlier tti-captain, sophomore Don Marshall, along with first string goaltender Steve Baker, wa.s named to the ECAC second team. Marshall was- Union's second leading goal and point getter this season, with many of his tallies coming in the latter portion of th~ year. Baker was the big man in goal for the Dutchmen, playing in the iast 12 games and coming up with big saves. at big times throughout the season. The rest of the squad deserves an honorable mention for the entertainment and excellent brand of hockey they brought to Union College this· year. At times unnoticed, but richly deserving of praise are defensernen Bernie Kaminski, Dean Mathewson and Tom O'Rear. This trio, known for 'being defensive defensenten, fonn an indispensable part of · the Dutchmen team. Also deserving recognition is goalie Jim Baxter who played well when called upon during the season and recorded the team's lone shutout, .iO.,() against McGill.

Welcome back and strength in the struggle from Perspective ... Can King Rest in Peace? by LEONARD D. LEE It will be exactly nine years since the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It has been nine years since the pain and frustration that ripped through the soul of this country. Aside from this despicable display of man's inhumanity to man - the assassination itself - how effective has the judicial system and its supporting institutions been in remedying a decisive verdict as to the who, how, when, where, and the what fors of this case? And better still, how effective have the institutional elites in this society been in rationalizing and socializing the ramifications of the King murder? It seems as though you, the reader, will have to answer these questions and more since they appear to be too \deep\ for the F.B.I. and Justice Department to deal with. At face value, the case has substantial evidence suggesting that James Earl Ray acted alone in the assassination: first a rifle of the same caliber of the gun that killed King, was found just yards from the scene of the crime, with Ray's fingerprints on it. The FBI and Justice Dept. investigations that included the largest (self- proclaimed) manhunt in history, both concluded that there was no conspiracy, and Ray, acting on his own, did in fact, shoot and kill Dr. Martin L. King, And finally, there is the guilty plea of Ray to put the icin$ on the cake. And yet,: there are still flagrant holes in the State's case. There has been doCumented evidence that suggests that Ray did not act alone, and was ~ided and abetted by someone who lies very close to home (namely his brother Jerry Ray, who lied to tile FBI, a federal offense for which he was not prosecuted.) Theil, there is Ray's newly contorted testimony, in which he says, a man called Raoul put him up to it (the Cuban connection). There is also substantial evidence that suggests that the FBI's own hate campaign against King, may have resulted in hili death. More evidence suggests that Jerry Ray, Earl's brother, was backed and supported by a racist group called the National States Rights Party. This organization is headed by J. B. Stoner, a millionaire in Tennessee. Jerry's racist convictions about Jews being \devils\ and Elacks being \beasts was ample admittance criteria for Stoner's organization (which boasts that they are more extreme than the Klan). Stoner himself was a proven racist. Beginning his career in 1939, at the age of 18,.he became Klan Kleagle, or ch\ef Klansman, for the entire state of Tennessee. Two years later, he founded the Stoner Anti-Jewish party. Its purpose according to New Times, was \to make being a. Jew a crime punishable by death:• It has been documented that during King's journeys through the S<1uth, not only was he followed by the FBI, but by Stoner and his supporters as well, When Stoner was asked for an interview with .Esquire, he said hti didn't ·see any adval)tages in killing King, and that an undercover agent frnrn the FBI had offered him $25~000 to kill King. Then who killed King? Did Ray act on his own or did he conspire with his brother Jerry? Did the FBI have King murdered? Did J. B. Stoner's racist organization have anything to do with it? And how in the hell did Ray get nearly $10,000 he spent in three countries before the murder and then elude the FBI for two months after the assassination? These are some of the unsettled - and unsettling - questions that continue to surround King's slaying nine years ago this month. Perhaps the most troubling and profound aspects of the entire King-Ray investigation is the uncertain and questionable role played by the FBI. There is considerable evidence to indicate that the FBI's probe was half- baked, half-hearted, and half- assed, particularly in relation to any possible conspiracy charges. As one can see, there is much more evidence that suggests that the investigation into the King assassination was not an air tight case in the least. In any serious probe of the King· murder, members of the Atlanta FBI unit might well have been suspects - not investigators. Arthur Murtagh, a former member of the Atlanta division, said, \the Atlanta group was widely known as the \get King squad.\ Its leader considered King \a menace to our society.\ Upon hearing that King had been w!mnde¢ an, agent from the Atlanta unit cried out, \I hope the son of a· b.itt;li dies.\ Perhaps . it will be safe to assume tb~t today, millions of Americans feel that the murder of Martin L. King rell'lains unsolved con'iiiiH on plliC t · by ABDOULAI SWARE After the initial shock at his unconventional diplomacy and his unprecedented self assertive diplomatic style, Carter is now being accepted as a voice that has come to stay - at least for the next· four years. Few Presidents' first three months in office have been more dramatic and colorful. Once more that age old trouble spot in Africa, the Congo, becoming an incurable cancer since the 1962 crisis, showed its potential to make explosive headlines. The electorate of the world's largest country ousted a dictatorship, and less noticeable to the public eye the 'Cool' War intensifies and Africa became the main focus for ideological confrontation with the tentative use of force. At home, Martha's Vineyard, taken away by Carter's brand of 'Neo-liberalism,' threatened secession. A week later, Nantucket threatened to assert its independence of Massachusetts. Carter addressed the UN as part of his moralist campaign, his insistent bragging about human rights was definitely one reason why his package deal for disarmament was blatantly rejected. People in the United States start sweating anytime 'Mr. Brezhnev sneezes'... he stated offhandedly.

How much of Jimmy Carter is really nouvelle? How many of his policies are a continuation of a legacy bequeathed by Gerald Ford? The Vietnamese press described the change as analogous to a change of underwear. Is Car- ter really just fresh underwear, no less different from the discarded one? How much good is his professed openness to the American people? What good is this foreign policy aimed at rejuvenating America as a shining star? How do the people who lived with bitterness through the Congo and Vietnam welcome this new crusading spirit? What is the effect of a foreign policy that defends American paternalism; does it stabilize or threaten the delicate and potentially explosive power balance? I think America is in for some disillusionment. Not only is Presidential power alone inadequate to effect some well due changes, Congress will only be willing to go Carter's way for a certain distance. The end would be a fight between executive power and big business and the latter will win. His unannounced energy policy if drastic enough, will leave many unemployed and bitter. Again monopolies could accept only minimal checks on their profit making. Hence Carter's domestic policies will end up a blueprint of his predecessors.

Any third world country that attempts to swallow the apple whole will choke. Yet if that forthcoming energy policy is drastic enough the American pu~iil.: will be forced to grow up and face some facts that have been hiding for too long. 1 foresee an anti-climax in the Carter-feding and Africa must be on her guard.

Cousar To the editor: In recent years Union College has undergone what I'd term as a \shift in social stimuli.\ This, of caurse, is in reference to campus life and those activitie$ explored by students, which fall outside of the realm of study. The only reason that I feel in the least bit qualified to speak on this subject is simply because I left school a little over three years ago .. Now that l'm back, the social changes which have developed over that period of time are to me, quite apparent. For example, racial tension in the past was that of open hostility to the point of occasional rumbles between Black and White students. Due to the frequency of mishaps, not only between students, but between students and •the administration (including two major takeovers), a school Disciplinary_ Board was, at the time, in active function. l'm not certain now if such a board even exists. Then, of course, there was the time of the blackout which many a male student saw as being an ideal moment for a surprise .. panty raid\ on Richmond; not to mention the turtling parties or more explicitly .. erotocism in beer,\ typical of many a fraternity weekend. What, then has been the shift in social involvement on campus and more important, where is it heading? From what I can see, today's ~ampus students are channeling their energies in social endeavors of more cultural merit. The Cabaret, for example, has as its base the positive influences of creativity and self-expression. Despite the uncertai.nty surrounding campus life in general; a view held by both students and parents across the country, I can look back to THE WAY WE WERE, not at the turn of the century, but in recent years, and acknowledge that Union socially-speaking, has, in fact, seen grimmer days. Sincerely, Byron K. Jackson FOOD FOR THOUGHT Nature gave men two ends - One to sit on and one to think with. Ever since then man's success or failure has been dependent on the one h.e used most. George R. Kirkpatrick Byron Jackson. Keith Jefferson. Gloria Jones fOOD FOR THOUGHT Something is wrong... Maybe the real criminals in this society are not the people who populate the prisons ... but. those who have stolen the wealth of t-he world from the people . ., and so every time a Black child dies... we should indict them for murder because they're the ones who killed that Black child. 'It is easy to uphQid civil liberties when the person charged . is not controversial. It is not merely difficult, but .perhaps dangerous, to support the rights of an unpopular defendant. Yet, it rnust be done or it may as welt be acknowledged that due process is vanishing along with other basic American rights. LETTERS: Dear Adam, As l begin this letter, Adam, my son, I know exactly what 1 don't want to say. I don't want to give you advice. What I hope to do is to alert you. My theory is that if you can pick up some idea of what reality is like early, before it intrudes unannounced, you may not be caught off. guard unprepared and undone ~ as often as most men are. And there your daddy has an advantage over most men: an eye trained to see things as they. are. Not as other men say things are, and not as l would wish things to be. 1 have developed this eye over seventeen years of gathering and reporting the world's news. News, of course, is nothing more than a daily record of man's stupidities, wisdom, laughter and tears. In . addition to my scholarship in the second oldest profession, I have made the classic mistakes - survived them - and invented a few new ones. This · legacy, then, is your daddy's view of the human landscape. Perhaps I should begin with something obvious - something so obvious that it escaped my attention for almost thirty-five years: All black men are insane. And that includes your daddy. Furthermore, ii: is safe. to say that there never has been a sane black ui.an in this society. Almost any living thing would quickly go mad under the unrelenting exposure to the climate created and reserved for black men in a white racist society. Sometimes I get the feeling that the climate itself is a catalyst, that it reacts with the fluids in a black man's brain to form a bitter, corrosive poison; it eats away the brain cells. he needs to develop into a sane representative of humanity. As a general rule, the white majority has no idea that its irrational behavior has created the monster it calls the Race Problem better, call it 22,000,000 insane blacks. I see no reason to apologize for my madness. As a matter of fact, I am proud of it. Any black man who is not insane - the way things are - ought to have his head examined. Our madness is proof of our humanness. As you may recall from history in school, the whites made a big fuss over a relatively little thing, \taxation without representation;\ They regarded it as an intolerable tnJUstice. And that led them to organize a new country based on fair play and equality. For whites only! They rarely miss a chance to show a black man that he cannot expect the same. Bob Teague Angela Davis Coretta, Scott King Roots: The Aftermath the television version of \Roots\ by Alex Haley ended with the · family of '.'Chicken George\ finally finding a santuary of relative happiness and .peace. But was there peace? Unfortunately, the television version of Roots did not cover the aftermath of Slavery, the turmoil · of Reconstruction and the institutions of Jim .Crowism. It is these later chapters of history that led' to· the perpetuation of mJustice, dehumanization and socioeconomic segregation despite the Emancipation Proclamation. Still the Black man found no .peace from the arbitrary discriminadon and prejudice that was characteristic of the American slave system. The following excerpt that you are about to read is an indication of the barbaric behavior that existed among a social institution and its people who advocated racism and actively sought to maintain the status-quo, and thus the Black man, as a second class, inhuman being - years after he was supposed to have been given freedom from such a deplorable form of existence in the first place. THE BURNING ALIVE OF JOHN HENRY WILLIAMS Washington Eagle I July 16, 1921 From Moultrie, Georgia, scene of the burning. of the Negl'o Williams, The Eagle has obtained the following facts by an eye witness. It is clearly shown that sworn officers of the law were leaders in mob violence arid burning, acting with impunity. Says The Eagle's correspondent: \There are many things about the Williams burning more disgraceful than have been published. A sick woman and her child, who had nothing to do with the matter, were beaten into insensibility and left to die because of noodlumism of the mob. Colored _churches were burned, all colored farmers' fences were torn down and wealthy colored farmers chased from their homes. \Williams was brought- to Moultrie on Friday night by sheriffs from fifty counties. Saturday court was called. Not a single colored person was allowed nearer than a block of the couJ,i:- house. The trial took a half hour. Then Williams, surrounded ·by fifty sheriffs ·armed with machine guns.. started out of the court-. house dt>or toward the jaiL · ••Immediately a cracker·bY the._ name of Ken Murphy gave the Confederate yell 'Whoo-w.4oo- let's ge~t ·the nigger.' Simultaneously five hundred~poor pecks rushed on the armed sheriffs, who made no resistance whatever. They tore the Negro's ·dothing off before he was placed in a waiting automobile. This was done in broad daylight. The Negro was unsexed and made to eat a portion of his anatomy which had been cut away. Another . portion was sent by parcel post to Governor Dorsey, whom the people of this section hate bitterly, \The Negro was taken to a grove, where each one of more than five hundred people, in Ku Klux ceremoni~l, had .placed a pine knot around a stump, · making a pyramid to the height .of ten feet. The Negro was chained to the stump and asked if he had anything to say. Castrated and in indescribable torture, the Negro asked for a cigarette, lit it and blew smoke in the face of his tormentors. \The pyre was lit and a hundred men and women, old and yoting, grandmothers among them, joined hands and danced around while the Negro burned. · A big dance was held in a barn nearby that evening in celebration of the burning, · many people coming by automobile from nearby cities to the gala event.\ One :must remember that this astonishing portrayal of barbarism wasn't an exception, but the rule. It's ironic tho\]gh that tll.is was in 1921 when America was perniciously trying to keep the rest of the world ••safe for Democracy.\ Now, iTs not even safe to walk the streets of America 1 s pre-eminent suburbs, without the fear of being called to a \Dixie Party.\ ] the: evolvt cultur term' by na youn11 gerten sough from leader iUustr: move• . from News1 \The 1 Tl \To New depen' food who t and group and t Ameri is pos: he be suppo: build • suppo1 is not pride• from~ can; h he h~ insuraJ mom:y race p \I ' Chan I monar tributa Con heart like si • with tc My thougt by a s1 grande Venge~ The were n execut• during tragic c I l withou withou raped, segreg~ and n Presid~ exalted Enth Dixie, any c constit1 State c The are th, majest) enforce Angele: - I a Ca.pitol I am - that: orgies I rehearse East S Housto l alii of ct separati am.

.. PI:RSPECTIVE April 6, 1977 Page C Blaek Pis tory Cultural Corner the \Spirit of tb.e Nt:w Negro•• evolved out of a political era of . cultural identity and viQie:nce. The. term \New Negro\ was originated by na(ianalists,. leftists and angry youn_g reformers --\- and in general, political radicals who sought to develop a distin\tion from the traditional Black leadership o£ the early 1900's. To illustrate · the validity of the movement, a selection was drawn . from the New York Amsterdam News 1 circa of 1929~30, entitled, \Th~ Spirit of the New Negro.\ THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW NEGRO \To our way of thinking the New Negro, if t1iere is such, is dependent. upon himself for his food at1d thinking --,-'- a Negro who has the ideal of a spiritually and economically independei)t group working in harmony with and being a . part of the larger American group, The New Negro is possessed of a new spirit. First, he believes in self-support. He !;Upports his family; and htllps to build a foundation for racial self- support. To do this, he believes it is not only necessary to talk 'race pride' but to act it. Hence he buys from a Negro grocer wherever he can; he ,goes to a Negro church; he has illsurance in a Negro insurance company; he puts his mont:Y in a Negro bank; he acts race pride. \I AM PREJUDICE\ Challen gej September 1919. I am Prejudice-su.preme monarch of the South, with vassal tributaries in the North and West. Conceived in the !~Jily white\ heart of the South, I was born like sin, full~fledged and armed with terror. My rage inspired the Rebellion- though resisted, baffled, beaten by a superior foe, 1 rose in brutal grandeur, the frightful genius of Vengeance. The \Ku-Klux\ and \Patrolers\ were my ministering spirits. They executed my flaming degrees during the hideous nights ahd tragic days of the Reco.nstruction. I have ·murdered. Negroes without cat~se, hanged them without provocation - I have raped, rob-bed, maligned, segregated a defenseless people, and neither pulpit, press, nor President has disturbed my exalted peace of mind. Enthroned in the heart of Dixie, I am more powerful than any church, I condemn all constituted a.uthority, whether State or Federal. The rope, torch, and .shotgun are the sacred symbols of my majesty and power, and my Will is enforced from Boston to · Los Angeles,- I rom Seattle to Miami - I am not a stranger at the Capitol! \' 1 am protected by State rights - thanks be - and my bloody · orgies have been dramatized and rehearsed in Atlanta, Springfield, East St. Louis,. and Fort Sqm Houston. I am the acknowledged genius of churcil, division, race separation, city segregation, and I am supreme in the Navy and triuinphant in the Army. I am the cementing tie that binds the solid South - the patron goddess of white supremacy. I have the keys of the doors of ·culture, opportunity .and wealth. I scorn tlle p~triotism of him whose right to \life liberty, and pursuit of happines.s'; I must forever deny. Second. the New Negro is a pioneer for his people. The New Negro launches out into business, (He m~y fail and the •old Negro' may laugh at him.) The New Negro encourages the pioneer in other lines. He is willing to ~take a · chance• to huild for the future. Third, the New Negro thinks straight. Because he is born of the new spil:it of freedom, he is. determined to have freedom in all its phases. He is willing to b\ar all its responsibilities. He;: wants a:ll of its privileges. He refuses to :believe he is diffe.rent from or inferior to any other of God's children. But he is not faising too big a row about it. · The New Negro believes in God. He may be gradually changing his theology. It is perhaps wise that he should. But he believes in God. A hundred years ago a New Negro walked out of St. George's Church, Philadelphia, and preferred to worship .in an old blacksmith shop which he did not pay. He believes that self-support. is of God. The New Negro has a new spirit, not necessarily a diploma, a ·white collar, a salary from charity organizations - he believes in God and himself ana his future and is hard at work.\ l, alone, know how to keep him . blind, poo~, and d~graded, for 1 recognize none of his distinction~, I acknowledge none of his merits, I ignore all of his ••progr~ss.\ No law can shelter him from · my hatred, no ethics can conceal him from my fury, for I am adored, worshipped - the young sing my praise, the old repeat the triumphs of my blessed brutality.

Rufus featuring Chaka Khan has a new release, Ask Rufus, which we hear is very good ... somewhat on the level of their previous album, Rufus. Diana Ross has released An Evening With •• , which is the soundtrack from her recent television special. Marvin Gaye even has .a new album. Judging from its title (which eludes us for now) this album is another variation of what has become a recurrent theme for Marvin Gaye. Horace Silver bas recently released Silver 'N Voices (United Artists) which is very reminiscent of a jazz era gone by - the big band era. Under the crisp direction of Horace Silver, the quintet manages to artistically recreate th~ ex.citement of those bygone days. Of course, the sound would not be complete without Voices.

One Fourth of July, I want to go to the New York harbor and talk to Momma - the Statue of Liberty. I want to snatch that torch out of her hand and take her with me to the ghetto and sit her down on the street corner. I want to show her the ''tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\ I want to show 1\rtomma what she has been doing to her children. And Momma should weep. For the grief of the ghetto is the grief of the entire Americ:;m family. Dick Gregory Book Stand will be a biweekly book review that wil1 be found in the culture section .of Perspective. It will consist of a wide range of reading materials for your reading 'enjoyment. Capital punishment is a disgrace. For the church to allow it to continue is an even greater disgrace. It is wrong for the church to tell me I should not kill and still be unwilling to make the same demand of the state. The greatest contradiction of all is for the clergyman to be present at the hour of the state's vengeance. \ls there anything more I can do for you, son?\ I would tell him,''Yes, Father. Stand here next to the electric chair and hold my hand.\ If that same clergyman would go all the way and jump into the electricchair Just once, it would end capital punishment immediately.

Variety Show, is responsible for the excellent selection of vocalists and for their direction. Silver deserves full credit for the music and lyrics which make this album such a delight to hear. Together Silver and Copeland create a smoothly flowing sound you can't help but appreciate! The musicians are. Tom Harrell, Hob Berg, Horace Silver, Ron Carter, and Al Foster. The voices are Monica Mancini, Avery Sommers, Joyce Copeland, Richard Page, Don Verdugo and Alan Copeland. Mus!cmagic is, to quote Chick Corea, the \next chapter of Return to Forever.\ RTF is one of the most talented and one of the most . popular jazz-rock groups currently recording. Their latest release is indicative of the quality their audience has come to expect. There is often a complaint logged against jazz-rock artists for \selling-out\ or commercializing their talents. When noted against a group of this caliber - a group that includes Joe Farrell, Gerry Brown, James Tinsley, Jim Pugh, and John Thomas the complaint becomes invalid. T.he music of RTF is in a constant state of change; it's nonconformity to conventional jazz is refresfiing and vibrant. The music, under Chick Corea's influence, is innovative, animated, and infectious. There are so many exciting changes and transitions that it is possible to hear something different everytime you listen1 It is really no wonder that their audience appeal is so wide-ranging. The beautiful soprano voice is that of Gayle Moran. She was featured on Corea's Leprechaun album · (Pdlydor 1976) also. Stanley Clarke and Chick Corea do vocals on Musicmagic (CBS) which is a first as far as we know. In addition, Moran, Clarke, and Corea wrote tlle lyrics for all of the melodies. Personal favorites are Stanley Clarke's \Hello Again\ and '\So Long Mickey Mouse,\ Gayle Moran's \The Endless Night,\ and the title cut \Musicmagic'' ,:bY Chick Corea and Gayle Moran. CAN KING REST IN PEACE? Continued from Page 1 and the official findings unsatisfactory. Such doubts have prompted the House of Representatives to appoint a special Committee on Assassination to reexamine the case from beginning to end. It's ironic though, that the committee itself is undergoing internal political conflict among its members, and other members of the House. Could the ramifications of finding the truth be greater than the judicial system itself? (the statute of limitations is over). How far and to whom does the conspiracy lie? The answer to these and many other perplexing questions of this case must be dealt with by the authorized agencies and all parties involved before the \truth\ .is brought to the light. However, it appears that the American people have let the lion sleep with the lamb again, and it may be another nine years before the truth is brought to the surface. By this time, everyone involved will be. too old to care, too poor to lie, and most of all, too old to suffer the consequences. And that's the price you pay for non-violent revolution.

, JJ ~ ~ ·-· - ..... Volume lOfi, No. 18 April 13, 1977 Dorm Moves Proposed by GARY BOWITCH DirectQr of Housing, Suzanne Dowling, released this past week her \Proposal for Dormitory Use~ Academic Year 77-78.\ The new proposal contains many major housing changes Jor this corning fall. ln the past few days, much discussion has filtered through the students, both in favor and against these new housing rec;omtnendations. As a consequence, Concordiensis interviewed Miss Dowling about the details and motives behind the proposed changes. common solutions.\ This condition, she said, would ·nelp compensate for those freshmen who are not easily integrated into the c o J: 1 e g e commumty. Additionally, she felt that ail freshmen dormitories will , provide \class spirit.\ She added, however, that freshman only dorms will not provide freshmen with a \completely integra ted experience.\ She feels that to fill in the gaps, the college must provide for \some dorm programs\ which will attempt \to integrate the entire campus, not just within the individual.\ \eliminate cooking dorms without kitchens.\ Cooking in rooms, she says, \causes roommate problems, fire hazards, dorm floor problems, and it runs up a high utility bill.\ The proposal also includes prov1s1ons for converting the South College into an all female Freshmen dorm. The motivation behind this move, according to Miss Dowling, is \di~:tated by numbers.\ The incoming cla:ss will consist of between 160 to I ~0 females. Miss Dowling states. ~0- 85 will opt for coed dorm~. leaving 80-100 freshmen females :still to be placed in a single sex dorm. South College was her choice. Director of Housing, Ms. Suzanne Dowling The plan involves the creation of \Freshman only\ living facilities, West will remain coed, South will be all female and Davidson all male. When asked the rc:~ason behind the proposal, Miss Dowling replied, \Having all freshmen together is going to provide them with a common base, people who have common interests, ,common problems and In response to a question concerning freshman contact with upperclassmen by the proximity of quarters, Miss Dowling replied that freshmen do not need upperclassmen living in the next room in order to become integrated into the college community. She felt that the incoming freshman class is of strong character and will therefore be able to make the proper adjustments needed to According to Miss Dowling, the proposal is flexible in many respects. She states, \I'm not willing to make the assumption that the .particular use of the floors is going to remain as it is.\ The proposal \is merely a plan for people to think about.\ Miss Dowling cited some examples. The number of male and female suites \will depend on demand as indicated by the first stages of the lottery.\ In some cases the proposal provides for the option of all male or all female facilities. But, she stated, if there is a greater .demand for suites on a coed floor, tl).en more floors will be made coed. Class of '81 to Visit Union . by PETER DONLON On Saturday, April 23, Union College will open its doors to students who have been accepted for the next school year starting in the falL Accepted Candidates Day, a unique social and ac~pepJic prpgr~m in-its ~econq consecutive year, ·nas a one day agenda whereby prospective students have an excellent opportunity . to see what Union really has to offer. Accepted Candidates Day falls in between the time the college;s acceptance n()tices ,go out and when deposits for the next school year have to be made. The purpose, as the Admissions Office sees it, is to help those students decide among the colleges they have been accepted into. The Admissions Office feels that Union is a college where a true understanding cannot be acquired from a catalogue or s.ome other form of college literature. You have to be able to experience college life for yourself. As the 23rd of April comes around, approximately 350 of the l ,450 accepted students will come to Union in search of just such an ex,perience. Along with their parents and relatives, a total of 1,200 inquiring people will be examining Union College~ During lasf Year's program when 296 P.rospective students arrived, 112 had decided already to enroll at Union. So for them, Accepted Candidates Day offered a valuable pre-orientation environment. They were given a chance to meet some administrators, facJtlty, students and obtain a sense of What demands would be placed on them here. The remaining students were undecided as whether to enroll at Union or some other place.

On April 12th the Housing Continued on Page I'() Anderson Speaks on America Today Perhaps the hardest hitting investigative reporter in journ,alistic history appeared at the most recent edition of Union's Speaker's Forum. Jack Anderson, renowned political columnist, speke in Memorial Chapel Tuesday, April 12 at 8:30 p.m. Mr. Anderson's best known daily column: The Washington Merry- Go-Round is carried by at least 750 newspapers with an estimated following in excess of 45 million people. Anderson, a graduate of Utah University with additional studies at Georgetown University as well as George Washington University began his journalistic career in 1931 as a, reporter with the Salt Lake Tribune. After a brief stint as war correspondent, Anderson began his association with the Washington-Merry-Go-Round in 194 7. A reporter initially, Anderson became a partner in 1965 and has served as owner since 196 7. In addition to this column, Anderson served as Washington Editor of Parade Mapzine~ (the weekly Sunday supplement to many papers) from 1954-1958 and then as its bureau chief since 1968. Among Anderson's many accomplishments in journalism are: A Pulitzer Prize for national reporting in 1972 as well as the writing of six major books including: The Anderson Papers, written in 1973, co-authored with George Clifford; Case Against Congress, 1968, co-authored with Drew Pearson; McCarthy: The Man, The Senator, The Ism; 1952, co-authored with Ronald May. The lecture itself was primarily concerned with overall conditions existing in America today centered around the philosophy of the still emerging Carter Administration. Believing that Carter is an honest, sincere individual, Anderson\ spoke in favor of the strong stand Carter has niken on human rights. Supporying his belief that the people of the world are in favor of civil righs Anderson cited the recent elections in lndia. He felt that the Ghandi government stripped the people of their human rights in return for giving them the much needed physical commodities they were lacking. The defeat of Mrs. Ghandi, her party and her son clearly established the fact that people are in favor of human rights thusly in agreement with the philosophy of President Carter. Anderson's deliberate syle of speech with often injected anecdotes moved briskly from one topic to the next. Speaking against the overwhelming power that the Federal Bureaucracy has attained, Anderson cited the Nixon Administration with its immensely bureaucratic system. He expressed his sincere hope that Carter will realize one of his major goals and actually cut Columnist Jack Anderson

Page 2 A. \ CONCORDJENSJS, April/3, 1977 Senate Meets Miller interviews Senator Jenkins by MURRAY LEVISON The All-College Senate met for the second time this term last Thursday, April 7, in the Old Chapel. Unfortunately, the spectator crowd was not as large as that for the last meeting. All members of th.e Union College community are reminded that Ali.- College Senate meetings are open to the public. Fraternity presidents and R.A.'s all receive Senate agendas, which allow . people to have prior knowledge of · what will be discussed. The meeting opened with a motion to approve the previous minutes. After a change in the order of two motions was made, the minutes were approved as amended. No objection was raised to courses and a new major in Applied Mathematics approved by the Educational Policy Committee (EPC)~ Kevin Schary, a student system now m operation could remain. A motion from the Committee on Student Life that had been tabled at the February lOth meeting was taken off the table. The motion stated that ·~the Senate calls attention to the following .behaviors as absolutely unacceptable in this college and as calling for the most severe of negative consequences: Academic dishonesty; ... racism, sexism and an Senator Jenkins Interviewed member of the College Campus Committee was supposed to attend the Senate meeting to give an informational presentation on the entry court now being constructed in front of the Skellar, but the committee decided that such a presentation was unnecessary. The project is intended to beautify the area around the Admissions Office, making for those interested in finding out just what is being built. A motion from the Committee on Student Life that had been tabled ·at the February lOth meeting was taken off the table. The motion stated that ''the Senate calls attention to the following behaviors as absolutely unacceptable in this college and as calling for the most severe of negative consequences: Academic dishonesty .... racism, sexism and anti-semitism; intentional misuse or destruction of library resources or facilities; (and) malicious or irresponsible endangerment of life or physical welfare.\ by TODD A. MILLER Tuesday, April 19, 1977, is the date on which the Committee on Housing will finalize housing arrangements for next year. Concord iensis met with sophomore Bill Jenkins, a college senator representative, to discuss the sena,tor's views concerning this issue. Concordy: What prompted this major shake-up in the first place? Jenkins: Well, as Suzanne Dowling explained to me, there were a great many reasons. Unfortunately, that's as far as she went by way of an explanation. She did not release any statement to the college community at the time when she released the proposal. It is my undetstanding that in this week's issue of Concordy she will offer her rationale behind the proposals. Concordy: Did you already approach her to discuss the proposal? Jenkins: Yes: I met with her for two hours last Friday, at which time we discussed various aspects of dormitory use for the upcoming year. Concordy: Were there any ''highlights\ of your meeting, and if so, what were they? Jenkins: Well, I must say Ms. Dowling impressed me as having thOToughly reasoned out many of the implications of her proposals. Certai,nly, one must keep in mind that she has the requests of two more ~a~r~t~s and two sororities for on-campus housing next year. Otherwise, it just happens that I don't agree with her shakeO::up and if there's really security in numbers, I'm in pretty good shape; many students seem to be of the same opinion as I am. Concordy: Of what same opinion? Jenkins: \Freshman-only\ bousing is just no good. Girls in South is . equally as unwise. Segregation of the classes, while possibly aiding in the strengthening of class- consciousness, is just not worth it -- at all. Both freshmen and upperdassmen benefit from interaction especially on a housmg-unit level. This is a college community, and as a guy on my floor said, 'segregation of classes comes perilously close to segregation of the campus.' Concordy: You mentwned South .. ? Jenkins: South College is the focus of a long tradition of all- male housing. The present proposal· ends this. While such traditions are not all that important to some, they are of value to those who see Union's roots as steeped in tradition. On this argument, we may have an: ally of grtat strength - tbe 1 trustees. cannot see them favoring the termination of such a tradition. Concordy: What do you find appealing in terms of the overall proposal? Jenkins: The security considerations and the allocation of kitchen facilities were certainly well thought-out. The kitchen facilities now available are allocated disproportionately in favor of women. The placement of all-males on the first floor of coed dorms is advantageous when considering the protection of our coeds from the type af problems that seem to have arisen year after year. Both of these recommendations I would view as positive. It's just that in my opmwn, and in the opinion of many others, such recommendations are outweighed by the negative aspects of the proposal. Concordy: You constantly speak of \others\ who _share your opinions? Jenkins: I guess I have three main sources supporting my belief that other students feel negatively about this proposal.

My . modus operandi is to drop in on poor unsuspecting humans and ask them if they think. If after several minutes they answer \yes Continued on Pa2e 10 Professor Neal Allen and student Ron Bergmann, members of the EPC, attempted to explain to the Senators their committee's General Education proposal. The April 6th and March 2nd Concordiensis' both have excellent reviews of the proposal. Dean of Faculty Paula Brownlee asserted that unless the General Education proposal was accepted this week, it would be too late to implement the proposal, and the Comp Ed Provost Enteman suggested that the phrases \absolutely\ and \and as calling for the most severe of negative consequences\ be struck from the entire proposal, as amended passed with only one dissenting vote. The last issue to be considered was the proposal by the Planning and Priorities Committee for the creation of an 'In te rna! Educational foundation. This too has received much publicity in recent Concordiensis articles. The Educational Policy Committee distributed their recommended changes to the lEF proposaL Since most of the Senators had not seen the. EPC recommendations, there was a motion to table the whole proposal. This motion lost with 6 dissenting votes. Concordy Sets Policy In. the implementatin section of the IEF, it was proposed that two references to· the \Planning and Priorities Committee\ be changed to the \Senate.\ This was passed with five or six dissents. On Monday, April 12, the Editorial Steerage Committee of Union College's Concordiensis met to discuss several important policy revisions which directly affect the newspaper's standard operating policy. The Committee, consisting of the Editor-in-Chief, the Associate Editor, and the two News Editors, unanimously agreed that the following changes in operating policy must be implemented if Concordy is to provide the campus community with a carefully-edited and stylistically-brilliant newspaper. The modifications are as follows: 1. The deadline for all article submissions and \Letters to the Editor\ is Monday night by 9 p.m. Classifieds submissions are to be in no later than Tuesday afternoon by 5 p.m. All submissions must either be given to Ms. Marra in the Student Activities Office; delivered to one of the editors working for the peper; or simply slipped under the Concordy office door (third floor Carneie). All articles and \Letters to the Editor\ submitted after the deadline will be considered for publication at the complete discretion of the editor(s) to whom the late copy is directed (i.e., a late news article would be printed at the discretion of the News Editors, etc.). 2. All \Letters to the Editor\ must be signed. If a letter is signed, but the author wishes to protect his or her identity because of legitimate extenuating circumstances, then the letter will , be signed .. Name Withheld Upon Request.\ The reason for such a requirement is this: if .a person submits a letter intending its , publication, he or she is accepting · a personal obligation to present a responsible and mature viewpoint. Unsigned letters (that is·, letters submitted with no signature) are often childish, vindictive, and in some cases, libelous; such letters will not be printed. \Letteres to the Editor\ which are submitted after the Monday night deadline will be printed at the complete discretion of the Editor-in-Chief. · 3. All articles, .. Letters to the Editor,\ classifieds, announcements, etc. must be typed and double spaced. Typing up hand-written copy is the job of the person who submits it for consideration. If you submit hand-written copy, there is a good chance that the person who types it up during Layout Night will be tired and irritable; subsequently, typographical errors will appear, important words might be misspelled or omitted entirely, etc. If you take pride in your material, be it an article or a personal, one would think that you would like to see your copy printed according to the way you want it to appear in the paper. 4. At a stipulated time each week (preferably a Monday night), thert: will be a full meeting of the Editorial Board in the Concordy Office. Such a meeting will essentially involve discussions of policy, feedback about the paper in general, and a department - by - department accountmg oi all art1c1es, e{c. submitted for publication prior to the deadline. In this way we hope to improve communication among the departments, and be able to realistically assess the amount of copy on hand and ready to be .printed. Furthermore, these meetings will be open to the public because tke Committee encourages intereste~ students to observe the \journalistic process•• as- it occurs. The Editorial Steerage Committee believes that the above-enumerated modifications are reasonable, and easy to comply with. If followed diligently, then the actual construction of the newspaper will occur with a great deal less pressure, which in turn would mean more precise copy-editing and less technical errors. EPC's recommendation to change the composition of the Foundation Board from th:e Dean of faculty, Provost, one EPC and one Planning and .Priorities faculty member, four' other faculty members, and three students, was moved and approved. At this point, _ the meeting ended. The Senate will continue the meeting tomorrow, April 14th, at 4:30 in the Old Chapel.

Trustees to Meet The Union College Board of Trustees will conduct its Spring meeting on campus this weekend. Major topics of discussion at the gathering will include a discussion of Union's continued affiliation with the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), and the other proposals recommended by the officers .of the Board in NYC on March 30. These topics will be considered at the Student Affairs committee meeting on Friday which will be chaired by Trustee Kenneth Whalen. The officers of the Board, Trustees Fortenbaugh, Bennett, Neumann, and Whalen, recommended that the College \give early appropriate notice of (its) intention to withdraw from NESCAC,\ to fully reinstate hockey coach Ned Harkness, and to establish an \Athletic Overview Board\ to \advise the President Financial Aid Funds Available on all major policy matters and issues affecting athletics)' These proposals came at the meeting that Preside~t Bonner called as a result of Coach Harkness's suspension. Unquestionably, the major source of state provided financial assistance for the Union College student is from those programs and funds available to stUdents who are residents of the State of New York. Of these, the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) is the largest. The a wards range from' $100 to .a maximum of $1500, the amount ?eing determined by the fa~ly mcome.

Page4 CONCORDJENSJS~ Apri/13~ 1977 Concordy Exclusive With Journalism King Interview with Jack Anderson by JON SCHORR ~ Q: Are you a muckraker? A: Sure. Q: Are all reporters muckrakers? A: I've got a lot of competition that I never had before. We used to have the only show in town. But now investigative reporting has become fashionable. I used to be the pariah of journalism, but now I'm the hero of journalism. It's an unusual feeling, but it's just temporary I'm sure. Q: Do you think that it's a result of the whole Watergate syndrome? A: Usually the people in power are popular, and so those of us who keep an eye on them, those of us who perform the watchdog role, those of us who are muckrakers, if you prefer, are not always that popular. But when Richard Nixon came to power, even though he was elected by a majority, he was never really a popular President. So we began raising hell with him, and I think we wound up with more public acceptance than the President. Q: So do you think the press' job is mainly to be a watchdog for the public'? A: Yes, I think that's our main function. We're supposed to Anderson Continued from Pal!e l down the size of this bureaucracy; for it may be the last chance America has. In one of his most smcere statements of the evening, Anderson expressed a genuine disgust with the system of tax incentives given to large corporations by the Federal Government. He very strongly stated how wrong he felt it was for the government to be subsidi:z;ing ••giving welfare.. to corporations such as Exxon and Ford. Each of these companies showed profits ;... excess of 100 million dollars .• _. rontrasted this to individuals wt,·. are forced to exist on dog food for lac}< of the resources to buy h2mburger. Other topics of discussion ranged from America's future energy problems to short anecdotes about his associations with prominent political figures. A brief question and answer session followed the ,one hour lecture during which Aderson responded to que::·•:o:lS concerning Watergate, the .t\BI and his overall philosophy of investigative reporting. and as far as l knew he was a good mayor. But we printed the story anyhow because it was too funny for us really to hold back. I understand that it resulted in the loss of his nex,t election! Maybe this was unfair, but maybe he shouldn't be judged on whether he'd let a girl bite his leg\i: report the news, but we should provide an independent version -of the news, and we should provide a critical and adversary version of the news. It's the final safeguard against dictatorship. Q: So do you think that it's inherent in the relationship between the press and the government that they become adversaries? A: I think that if there's not an adversary relationship, we're not performing our function. OJlr function is to keep an eye on those who govern us. We should always have a healthy disrespect for the people in power. Any time we become afraid of the people in power, then we no longer are the sovereigns, and the President is the sovereign. Our founding fathers intended that the people should be the sovereigns. And they can be the sovereigns as long as they're the boss, as long as they're in charge. They're in charge only as long as they can control the President, not the other way around. When the government can control the ~ople, then w~'re in danger. The day that the government can conirol the press, that's the day that they'll be able to control the people. Q: As far as the investigative reporting that you do, how far does your freedom go? What do you consider fair game, what's private to the politician? A: Well, that is something for each journalist to define. We can't let the government define it because then the government would impose total censorship on it. So we have to impose self- censorship. We can't let the government do it; we have to do it ourselves. So each of us has his own censorship code, that is, each of us has to decide how far he should go. I have certain guidelines. Q: What are your personal guidelines? A: We wouldn't want to publish a story that we felt would cause someone's death; we wouldn't want to publish a story in which we felt the security of the nation would be jeopardized. We generally do not want to publish stories about the private lives of public officials, unless such stories somehoW effect their public conduct. So we gen1=rally try to follow guidelines. There are exceptions. I remember once the mayor of Tucson, Arizona came to Washington, and while he was there he got bit on the leg by a girl. This was a private affair, Q: You mentioned national security before. W auld you print anything that you thought would endanger national security? A: No, I don't think any newspaperman would. Q: 1s that up to your own interpretation? A: Yes, it has to be my interpretation or the government's. If i t ' s the government's interpretation, then it's censorship. We can't have that in a free society. Q: There was an incident recently in which President Carter called a reporter and· the editor of the Washington Post to the Oval Office and asked them not to print a story about CIA payoffs to King Hussein of Jordan, because it would interfere with Mid .. East peace negotiations ... A: I don't think that's true. Actually, the Post went to the White House and told them they had the story and asked their view on it. We do that all the time. In fact we never print a story without consulting the person we are writing about, which automatically ~ives the CIA, the FBI,. the Defense Department and whoever else an opportunity to ask us not to print the story. And they do tell us that occasionally. We ask them why, and listen to their arguments. The important thing in a democracy is that we then decide whether or not to publish it. The government cannot order us not to publish it. That's the difference between a dictatorship and a democracy. Q: So the government has told you not to print stories? A: No, the government has asked us not to print stories. They cannot tell us, and that is the happy part about freedom of the press. Q: Do you think investigative reporting sells newspapers? A: I think investigative reporting did sell newspapers during the Nixon era. I think it's no longer popular. I think the people are tired of it. I think some of it has been irresponsible. I think a lot of young reporters, even old reporters, are trying to gain overnight fame, fortune, and glory, as Bob Wooqward and Carl Bernsteindid. In their attempt to do this they are puffing up stories. I think this is going to have a backlash on investigative reporting. I've instructed my reporters always to be careful about accuracy, but I have given them extra special instructions now, because when people think about investigative reporting, fortunately during the Nixon era they thought about us, unfortunately if investigative reporting gets a bad name they'll think about us. It's in my interest that investigative reporting does not get a bad name. Right now it has a g~wd name. But investigative reporting will be hurt if all these amateur reporters continue to write irresponsible stories. Q: Do you think that you have credibility with your readers? Do they believe that your sources are valid? A: I think you should ask my readers about that but I can only <:ite various polls and surveys that have been taken and I don't know of one that didn't show that We had high credibility with our readers. Q: Do you think th!:lt after you accused Thomas Eagleton of various reckless driving charges and then could not produce evidence because your sources kept silent you lost credibility? A: I didn't detect that we did, everybody makes mistakes and we made one. The important thing is when you do make a mistake that you correct it. I suppose that with some people who think that everybody should be perfect we did lose some credibi'lity. With those who believe that no one is perfect and when you make a mistake you should correct it I guess we gained some credibility ... No one corrected that for us we did it ourselves, people seem to forget that. Q: Credibility played a large role in the Watergate affair. As a Washington observer do you sense a change in attitqde of the people to their government since the scandal? A: Naturally, anything as traumatic as Watergate is going to have an effect on public opmton, and it has had a derogatory effect on the opinion of govefllment. Public faith in government has been shaken by Watergaie. That is unfortunate · because in fact Watergate proves that the democratic processes are functioning properly. People should be grateful for Watergate. When we had a bad President the democratic processes were able to throw him out. Q: So in effect was Watergate a test of our system and did it work? A: Yes it was one of the most severe tests that the system has had and it worked exactly as the founding fathers intended. The President was exposed by the press and then the other branches of government, the Congress and the Courts, moved to check the President and eventually to remove him. You have to credit the.m for removing him. Q: It seems to be a conscious effort on the ·part of Presiden:t Carter to stress honesty and integrity . in government contrasting himself with the Nixon-Ford administratio.ns. Does Carter have more credibility thaJt Nixon and. other past presidents? A: l think that he does not have automatic credibility, which is s-omething that presidents used to have. The moment a .president stepped into the Oval Office the American people assumed that no matter how dubious his background, no matter how questionable his '--qualities, something. magical took place and the president shed. his ugly past. In the past presidents have moved into the White House with automatic credibility. The credibility has to be earned now and Carter is going about it in a public relations way and it is shrewd politics. Q: You have saill that \few men can survive the climb to the top without having their values unimpaired.\ How has Carter survived his climb to the top? A: 1 think that he has maintained personal convictions. The quest fot power is intense and much more intense when the stakes are high and in this country the stakes are higher than in any other country. So people will sometimes cut corners to achieve this kind of power. In other countries people murder for such power. There are so·· e who will ·discard convictions in their search for power perhaps in the belief that they wiU ·become good leaders. Q: You mentioned being a hero before; a few years ago Life Magazine called you the new folk hero of the young. Where you then and are you now? A: This 1.s true for a while, it may still be true. I ao.iink it is a temporary thing, I don't think a muckraker can be a hero for too long. He's always picking out the flaws in the people who are popular a11d normally a president or cabinet officer is a person who is respected and therefore popular. Those of lis who assault them, those among us who are cantankerous enough to assail the people in power don't become popular because of it. Normally even the press tends to become -the voice of the people in power. Most reporters te11d to adopt the views of the people they write about. And therefore those of us who kick against the traces tend to he unpopular -even with our own colleagues. I think I became a folk. hero of the young more in the .s~ties than in the seventies, because in the six.:ties the young were disaffected oecause of the Viet N am war.

Maureen V erra - records I know Union is here but it does not really matter. I have heard about Union hockey and I know when I go to a bar I am bound to see Union students there. Steve Waltman - s.c.c.c. student I know Union is a good school. I have a few relatives that went there. I follow the sports activities closely and I use the rink regularly. I would like to see hockey go Division I. Vince Ruzzo _ waterbeds I think Union is a social advantage for me because I live in an area where a lot of students are living. The students at Union are a different type of people. They are nice to have around. Union sports add something to the area because people need a local team to follow even if they do not go to the games. Mrs. Pettica - bookstore Union College has been here a long time, and it certainly is a good thing. I come in contact with Union students. I cannot see any disadvantages to having the college here. Mike Brown - businessman Although I am not very fami!Jiar with the school, I can see where sports and cultural activities add to life in the area. I attend some of these activities and I worked for a drama activity last year. Karen McKechnie - salesgirl It helps the community by adding more dollars to the economy. The school brings in cultural events we would not otherwise have here. Achilles Rink is fantastic. You also have a great library. I use it all the time. Robert Lessner - Gershon's For businessmen, it's great for the economy because it brings more 'money into the community. Also, for kids from the area who do not or cannot go away to school, there is a great school right in their backyards. It is also nice for someone like me who wants to take a course. I took a course last year that I really liked. Joe Ross - businessman I think the school is an asset to the community. The education effered can only benefit local industry. I have been to some sports events and I am glad they reinstated Coach Harkness. Ed Brennan - travel agent I am from outside of this area but I have heard of Union. They have a good electrical engineering department and a good psychology department from what I know. I have never heard anything negative about the school. Joan Brownell - housewife Although I do not have personal contact with students at Union, it is a convenient location for kids in the area who want to go to a good school. I think the college is an asset to the area. Eileen Price - pet store I have heard of the school but I have no contact with the college at all. The only thing I have heard recently is about the new Achilles 1 Heel Rink because it has been in the papers. April 13, 1977 .

The reply of \absolutely none\ was anything but encouraging. They stepped o1,U and the door, which had· no handle on the inside,. shut tight. I've never been a politically oriented person and have never felt politics to be anything more than a necessary evil of society. That viewpoint has not changed, but having been in Berlin (East and West), I find myself acknowledging more of the necessity of politics and forgiving more of the evil. Is this what organic research leads to? When we got back to the bus things started to look unfamiliar and I soon realized I was on the wrong bus. l made it over to the other parking lot as fast as I could but my bus was gone. 1 was only about 200 yards f{-om West Berlin but the political situation tended to complicate the matter.

I made a point of not trying to foresee the consequences of this explanation for fear I'd be tempted to take my chances at the wall.

Yet I couldn't completely suppress thoughts about the various ways in which I could have avoided the whole _mess. I was, however, gloriously pleased with myself for having taken a piss before contacting the border police. At least I could rest comfortably. At times I found myself commiserating with my captors' situation. After all, I could have been an American spy. But hell, I had a perfectly valid passport and I hadn't done anything more guilt-wotthy than present myself before them and explain that I was lost. And besides, why throw me into this ·tathole?! Leslie A. Hull, assistant professor of chemistry, has received a $ W,500 grant from !he Petroleum Research Fund for continuation of his study of the reaction of ozone and organic compounds. The work involves examining step-by-step the process by which ozone, a component of the upper atmosphere and photochemical smog, reacts with various organic compounds .. Dr. Hull said the work may aid in the understanding of how ozone is destroyed in the upper atmosphere by organic compounds, such as freon. Furthermore, he said, it will tell scientists more about the destructive effects that ozone in photochemical smog has on living tissue. The grant is the second Dr. Hull has received from the Petroleum Research Fund, which is administered by the American Chemical Society. He previously received a gr-ant of $7500. Eight Union undergraduates have assisted on the project. This year's undergraduate participants include Joy Sawyer, a senior chemistry major from Schroon Lake, N.Y.; Nancy Westby, a junior chemistry major from Bayville, N.Y.; and Ken Zimmerman, a junior science major from Oceanside, N.Y. Tbe grant is part of a program aimed specifically at undergraduate colleges with no doctoral programs in chemistry. Dr. Hull, a graduate of the University of Rochester, earned his Ph.D. 'at Harvard University. He joined Union College in 1972. Patent Awarded An improved artificial valve designed by J. Richard Shane.brook\ professor of mechanical engineering at Union College, and Michael F. Clune, a former Union student, was awarded a patent last month by the U.S, Patent Office. An important advantage of the new valve, which is designed hke an airfoil, is that it mimics the action of natural valves in the heart. Called a \hemofoil\ valve, it represents an improvement over . current artificial valves in that it is streamlined to reduce the amount of turbulence after each .closing of the valve, thereby reducing strain on the heart. The valve, awarded Patent no. 4,01 1,601, is intended for use in replacing defectiv.e mitral valves located between the left atrium and left ventricle of the hea·rt. Dr. Shanebrook said the Union College research team is now preparing to test the valve by implanting it in a dog. If a natural mitral valve is healthy, Shanebrook said, \the blood flows as though in a vortex. It is ,)ike the swirling of water when you pull the plug in a bathtub.\ In simulating this action, the Union College valve keeps the device clean and prohibits the formation of blood clots, which can be fatal. Fortunately, this turned out not to be a dragged out affair. Within two hours 1 was politely escorted out of thy accommodations. Except for a well churned~over Utilities Study The valve is the result of five years of work by Dr. Shanebrook and a number of Union College undergraduates, including Michael Clune, who now \Works for the U,S.

The grant is the second awarded to the professors, Thomas Kershner and James Kenney, by a major industrial firm. The General Electric Company recently contributed $10,000 toward the study, which focuses on industry's sensitivity to changes in 'rate structures in its use of electric power. The aim of the study, particulary timely in view of the concern over the business climate in the state, is to better predict the economic impact of various proposed rate structures, and .to .Provide lawmakers and regulators with more information on the long-term effect of their decisions. The researchers hope to specify, by means of an econometric model, the nature of the relationship between electricity USe, price, and other important variables which affect demand. Dr. Kershner is an associate professor of and chairman of Union's department of economics. Dr. Kenney is an assistant professor of economics. They have qeen doing research related to New York's electric utilities for several years. • · , I I I l-\' \ I • The most common cause of mitral valve failure, said Dr. Shanebrook, is rheumatic fever. Following the illness, the valve sometimes does not open widely enough or it leaks. As many as 30,000 people in the world each year might benefit from the Union College invention, Dr. Shanebrook estimated. The team is now extending the concept of the hemofoil to aortic valves, which are located between the left ventricle and the aorta. A long term objective is to develop an improved artificia I heart. The research team has been assisted in its work by grants from such organizations as United Wa} of Schenectady County and the Engineering Foundation.

Robert Wells, associate professor of history, has been awarde<l a Guggenheim Fellowship to write. the first draft of a book-length report on the impact of demographic patterns on the lives of the American peoples and, by extension, on American history. Dr. Wells was one of 313 who received the fellowships, which were announced last week. The fellowship, running from September to August of next year, will allow Wells to take a year's leave of absence and devote his full energies toward writing and revising his manuscript. The award appears to mark the first time that a member of the Union faculty or administration has won ··a Guggenheim Fellowship while at the college. President Thomas Bonner won two Guggenheims before JOining Union, first in 1959 and again in 1964. In his proposal for the fellowship, Dr. WeUs said that a \basic assumption\ of his effort is that \the experience and expectations that people have of birth, death, marriage, and migration are central to the way in which they will live out their lives.\ \Unless we fully understand these experiences and expectations, it is impossible .to grasp what it has meant to be alive at particular periods of time,\ Dr. Wells continued. Dr. Wells said he wanted to examine the interrelationship of patterns of ·birth, death, marriage and migration with the \values and attitudes people had about those events and related matters dealing with the family, social, political and economics programs.\ Other aims of the study,, he said, are to pull together a wide variety of literatur.e on the subject which \has not yet been treated as a coherent whole.\ As an example,. Wells said that students of the 19th 'century have closely explored declining birth rates, sex roles, concern for the family ·and anxieties of human sexualit)!. \No one has put all the parts together, though they are clearly related.\ of: Wells said he also wan-ted to examine the \profound effects on peoples• lives which have accompanied the extraordinary demographic changes of the last two centuries\ and to explore the lives of \all types of Americans.\ William Gass to Lecture Philosopher and novelist William Gass will give two public lectures a't Union College Thursday, April 14. The Washington University professor, author of \In the Heart of the Heart of the Country,\ will speak first on \Philosophy and Literature'' at 3 p.m. in Room 116 of the Humanities Building. Thursday evening at 8 p.m. he will read \Mad Meg\ from his recent book, .. The Tunnel,\ in Strauss Lounge in the College Center. There will be no charge for either lecture. Gass, a National Book Award winner, is the author of \Omensetter's Luck,\ \Fiction and the Figures of Life,\ and \Willie Masters Lonesome Wife.\ His interests · are primarily in aesthetics; Greek philosophy, and fiction. A graduate of Kenyon College, Gass earned his Ph.D. at Cornell University. The lecture is part of Union College's Andrew Mellon Faculty Development Series.

Wednesday, April 20 at 8 p.m., the SIMS Club is sponsoring a symposium on \The Ideal Human Being\ in the Union College Social Science Building room 0 16. The symposium will include speakers from various disciplines giving their perspective on man using his full potential. From these separate viewpoints it is hoped an integrated concept of Human Potential might be gained. Speakers will include Dr. Charles Scaife, Chairman of Union College's Chemistry Department, who will speak on \The Ideal Scientist,\ a person concerned not only in advancing science but . contributing to the betterment of mankind and humanity. An active member of the Danforth Foundation. (an organization establis·hed to promote ethical practice in science), and as an active member in the Lutheran Church, Professor Scaife has some strong views on this issue. Also on the panel will be Dr. Byron A. Nichols, Assistant Professor of Political Science. Professor Nichols has always had a deep interest in the theoretical branch of his field. He will speak on the inter-relationship of the members of society and the rules, governing them. The vision of Human Potential depicted in the field of Art will be presented by artist and professor Arnold Bittleman. Professor Bittleman is one of America's finest painters and can be found in Who's Who in American Art. Ted Bashore has a PhD in Psychology from the University of Colorado. He specializes in clinical and biological psychology. Professor Bashore will speak on \Holistic development.\ Ted has a personal interest in physical fitness and in developing a state of mental and physical well-being. played a key role in Schenectady's and Union College's history. The structure of the symposium will allow for a short presentation by each speaker followed by an open exchange between speakers and audience. The program will end with coffee, punch and donuts. Admission is free and all are welcome. Sponsoring this event will be the SIMS Club (Students International Meditation Society).

Page 8 CONCORDIENSIS, Apri/13, 1977 EDITORIALS Housing Proposal Atter much to-do and speculation. the official housing proposal was released this week by Director of Housing Suzanne Dowling. Ms. Dowling states many varied reasons behind her seemingly random segregation of dormitories. As editors of Concordiensis, and as representatives of the student b()dy. we take issue with most of her justifications. l. re: all-freshman housing. \Having all freshmen together is going to provide them with a common base; people who have common interests; common problems and common solutions.\ Being that, at one. time or another, we were all freshmen, we realize that freshmen do have common interests. Are these interests that different from those of the upperclassmen? We think not! As for those common problems, that is most definitely .tFue. However. being that all freshmen have no experience with these probkm~. the common ~olution~ are net so obvious. How often haH: \~c ~ew group~ of freshmen at Fall registration all with a common problem? Their common solution, however, is usually utter tru~tration w.hich inevitably leads to the wrong del:ision. Who d~~: ~an the) go to but the upperclas~men li,ing down the hall to find nut \\hat thi~ ~chool is all about. 2. rc. \She felt that the incoming freshman cla~s is of strong character, and v.ill therefore he able to make the proper adjustment needed tl1 be active memberl> of.the Cnion. community.\ What makes M~. OoY.Iing think that the Class of 1981 is so ~uperior to the other classes? Almost any student can tell her that the adjustmenb to college are made much more easily by the comtant example~ set by the upperclasmen living with these freshmen, who have already been through it before. 3. re: das~ spirit and integration. During one's freshman year, there are enough problems Identifying with union College's school spirit, let alone one's indtvidual dass spirit. More than anything else, this proposal will tend to divide the classes. The attempt at integration will definitely not v.ork a~ upperclassmen get accustomed to not seeing freshmen. They will have less and less desire and or motivation to be with the freshmen. On a campus of only 201)() students we must strive for homogeneity among the classes at all costl!; not dividing the school into four separate classes. Sorry Suzar1 ne, this is not the large state university you are used to. 4. re: freshmen where there are no cooking facilities; upperclassmen where there are. The results of this proposal will be many. First, a lower With; deveiep and , &f · ..Coach,,Jl.arkness\ .. ,,and- ,,tb«:L · , .'fJl<Je:s,.,,,tte. breaks. ,,Maybe Lam .. percentage of upperclassmen will be eating at SAGA than are eating there now. This will delight SAGA no end. This will once again cut down on the degree of interaction between the freshmen and the r~mainder of the school. Many freshmen find West unsatisfactory and will do some of their own cooking in their rooms anway. 5. re: Cooking in dorm \causes roommate problems, dorm floor problems and runs up a high utility bill.\ Most upperclass roommates are roommates by choice as set up the year before. In most cases all roornrnates are cooking together, which in fact promotes unity and camaraderie among these people. Surely, it is easier to cook for more than one person at any one time. This forces the people to work together on a ,common project at least once a day. Often people from neighboring rooms cook together promoting floor solidarity. As for lowering utility bills, since when is electricity cheaper in Richmond than it is in West? Surely, Ms. Dowling does not expect everyone to use the common kitchen if and when it is available. We feel that the proposals must be looked at realistically with the best interests of the students in mind. We urge all concerned individuals to express their opinions in writing by Friday April 15 by contacting the Housing Office. Gen-Ed Implementation Many of the ideas of the newly~proposed Gen-Ed program support the concept of liberal education being more than a narrow concentration of studies. It is a first attempt to correct the flaws of a decade of CED. However, the .expediency of implementation without careful discussion may cause future repercussions. The Gen-Ed proposal recognizes the need to bridge major- concentration and a Renaiss'ance education of the mind. It encourages students to .. educate\ themselves without college - imposed constraints becoming necessary. The students would not have to take worthless (an assumption of most CEO's) courses along with self-conceived liberal programs. Additionally, it recognizes the need to provide fresl1men with expository and analytical communicative skills. The proposal encourages the academic departments to reevaluate, upgrade and generate programs along non-major lines. The EPC is pushing for implementation by the fall of 1977. However, the proposal does not concern itself with the academic fulfillment of these goals. For example, the freshman preceptirials as presently conceived do not remedy the mistakes of freshman CEO's. Faculty are expected to cooperate interdepartmentally to devise courses of both skill and content without specific guidelines and expectations before the next college catalogue deadline. ln such a short amount of time, the new upper level courses designed to give exposure to non-majors may just atnout to a renaming of the old CEO's. There should be debate and careful planning before creating a similar, ill-conceived system which may be regretted a decade from now. For all the good intentions of Gen-Ed, it may not solve any of the problems that arose from CED. Without careful understanding and thought by all concerned, it may just be a cursory replacement. The EPC should not be pushing for ratification so soon. It should be trying to generate more diverse inputs to compile a more perfect solution, not just a \better than what we have\ solution.

The abuse splattered upon the President of the College and the athletic program is a testimonial to the narrow mindedness and vindictive attitude of a few people who wish to be more powerful than the administration. Union is in need of a culture change, not a revolution. For aU th9se concerned, recognize that the wounds wiU be deep and long lasting. In the long run, it's a loss., loss for everyone. And, even after the people have passed, the institution and the community will go on, but the wounds and the scars will remain. Success in this world is much more than a political education. Learning how to work with, develop and motivate people has a much greater impact on life. lt would be well for the anarchists at Union College to recO'gnlze this, and deal realistically, with the realities of life and community support. Regretfully, Neil M. Golub E~ecutive Vice Presi&nt Pri(e Chopper Foods with fork•d tongu• . De•r Editor: The head .coach lies to his supetiors and is twice caught · using ineligible players - the · director of admissions is fired · for falsifying athletes' records - the college is forced out of a high.ly prestigious athletic conference because of its questionable athletic policies ~ the president of a great institution speaks with forked tongue whenever hockey is the subject - the campus and its alumni body are torn apart as the battle wages over academic integrity versus jQck-school behavior. This is the price U ni<ln College is paying for a winning hockey team. Yours .truly, Allan Dowe Saratoga Springs priorities To The Editor: Dear Mr. Bonner: Ned Harkness lias developed a fine hockey program at Union College, but he is setting a dreadful standard of behavior for the student body. Mr. Harkness seems to believe that his intentional violation of recruiting rules and nis lie to you were justified as being in · the best interests of the hockey program. This behavior is contrary to the high standards that have made Union a great Union. Sincerely, Robert Schafer '64 Asst)eiate Professor a job well done To ttle Editor: On April 2,. the llrotlters of Phi Delta Theta held a Skate- a-tllon at Achilles Rink for the benefit of The Easter Seal Society. 340 skaters partidpated and raised money in pledges in excess of $15.000 ~ if aU that money is collected it will set a national record for an Easter Seals Skate*a-thon. The extensive work of Coach Ned Harkness prior to the event greatly contributed to its success. As well, the presence of Coach Harkness and the Union College Hockey Team at the event. figure<l strongly in its suc<!ess. Coach Harkne~, along -with many members of the Team, skated for the entire seven hours. Apart from the Hockey Team. however, less than 20 of the 340 skaters participating in the event were from Union College. At a. time when· so much criticism of Achilles Rink and its use is being aired on campus,. it ·was saddening to s~e so few people from the tJnion College CQ.mmunity participa:ting in an event which used· the R.iak to rally College resouref!s around a worthwhile cause. The potential cleatly exi$ts to use . the Rink and the Ho<:key Program for important and charitable purposes; purposes which will benefit both tbe College's . name and its students. The failure of so much of the College to do so moves me to ~uestion the sincerity of those who constantly criticize tile Rink and the Hookey Program because, as they would have us believe, they are so concerned to see those things used properly t() benefit the College and its image. Furthermore, I would like to point out that in . this endeavour for Easter Seals, Coach Harkness was the main force ·behind the largest dollar charity drive at Union College in ~veral years. He did this without any expectation of reward. I sincerely hope thllt those Who spend so rnucb. of their time attacking Coach Harkness on the premise that he is detrimental t~> Union College, will spend a little less of their time dividing the College, and a little more of their time doing something as unselfish and beneficial to people and Union College as Coach Harkness ·has done here. Sincerely, Tom Lawson Chairman East~r seals Skate•a~tbon . . ,J~-~~tlltt11. •·~ .·1.·1.: •. · pres.s~.~E-~'''' school well over the years, but I still feel he is as much to blame (if not more) for the ·infractions of admissi{)ns standards as Concordy's \external pre~ures\ are. A man of the moral standards you say he has would not have committed a second violation after being reprimanded for a first one, let alone alter Admissions minutes. I would sympathize more with someone for violations done independent from \external pressures,\ done in accordance with one's own personal convictions and beliefs, than for violations which one opposes but is swayed into committing. I give no sympathy to anyone who breaks rules because of \orders from above,\ especially if this person helped formulate the rules he breaks. Maybe l am coming down too hard on Jay Shupe 1 but l think an individual should let his consfience and moral standards direct his actions before he makes a mistake and not after. The infractitm has been committed (twice} and an apology and admission of guilt may satisfy his conscien<:e~ hut it d~s not alter the fatts •. Thank you, Rich Guardil\n '77 Editor~ Concordiensis~ For about the past seven months now· the student body of Union has been bombarded witb many crucial issues and in a rutiud;.and-1lbout way. been · · ask~d to take sides in these issues. For example, each week we tead in Coneotdiensis · about the \'relevant'' issues at hand· (which for the most part has been NESCAC and Division I Hockey). i, for one, am sick and tired of reading about it. For one thing, what are we as students gOing to do about it? Do we or should we have a say? Have we in the past on important matters in the college community? lt is with an ironic twist that I happened to conie across a very timely quote in reading abook for Prof. Daniel's .Poli Sci II course this past week. The book is entitled, Democra.cy for the Few and was written by Michael Parenti. The paragraph reads , like so: ~·consider the university: most institutions of Mgher education are public or private institutions (c()rporations) ruled by boards of trustees with ultimate auth(lrity over all matters of capital funding and budget; curriculum, scholarships and tuition, departmental organization, hiring, firing, and promotion of faculty and .staff, degree ¥}f -+c • if il it ~ -+c il ir -+c ~ it if ic ic • ** Th has a EHis and c cannc any finan best , At the r estab rea so Unio1 surve. the rr These locate Clare· Street Peter' Mann Eac cost c all th, quote' Ellis St. C St. P Is Ab< studer go vert Facull Colle11 studer Comr pub lis Colleg proble pre sen what c took t this S) I sel discus: system old. 0 new althou unsolv gover11 membc under gradu~ Deans. the P only v Agend topics Coun govern faculty option numbe from 7 much The perf on before and tl voting Presid< with tl In 1

CONCORDIENSIS, Apri/13. 19i7 Page9 Student Apathy I'm fafriy sure that most people look forward to seeil)g Concor~iensis every week. Students writing articles for the paper enjoy seeing their bylines; student groups know that the paper is probably the most efficient medium through which meetings, special events, etc. can be announced; the faculty views the paper in similar terms (announcement of faculty committee proposals, speakers invited by the faculty whom they feel are of interest to the community); and local businessmen .can rely on the paper as a format for presenting inexpensive, high\impact advertisements. And of course, the intangible 'reading pull' of the Per910nals Page can nonetheless be mea'-\·!red in terms of the vast amount of esoterica received weekly. Well, here~s a bombsht:Jl to mull over during lbrunch: unless student support is strong and quickly forthcoming, there will be no more Concordiensis. Last night's layout attendance was horrendous. Very few people showed up until around nine-thirty; layout should begin by eight- thirty. The paper is reliant upon articles that are written Tuesday night; written at a time when all articles should be edited, counted up and ready for layout! You say Concordiensis is an elitist newspaper? You're goddamn right it is! With a working staff of le~s than twenty people layout night, it could be nothing but an eliti~t enterprise! A small, liberal-arts school of mon: than 2000 pt:oplc 1:. ~till large enough to care about is newspaper. I refuse to beg lor your support; if you don't want to work for the paper, I won't demean myself by whiningly coaxing you into action. 1 will simply :.tate the facts: a newspaper saddled with a skeleton staff consisting of lull- time students cannot put out a weekly paper; especially comidenng that the people on the staff get no course credit, get no pa), and work for the sheer satisfaction of seeing a job well dont:. Well, the job hasn't been \well done\ and I'll take personal respon:,ibihty lor that. As Associate Editor, I should have made it my glorious obsession to buttonhole every Tom, Dick and Harry on campu:, for their support. But I didn't hecau!>e I maintained a peculiar :,ort of idealism which made me honestly beleive that l could work with Danny and the major department editon with a lightning-like efficiency, and put the paper together despite a snoring student body. I was wrong. You proved me wrong, and I'm glad, because it finally occurred to me that a campus which does not show even a casual interest in helping the newspaper is not really worth me sweating off my already bony butt. My disgust is immeasurable. Please take this letter to heart; or better yet, take it to your head. Think about it a while. I'd love to write some more, but it's approaching 2:00 AM and Danny and I still have to write up the headlines and captions. Opinion: Most sincerely, Todd A. Miller Associate Editor Concordiensis To Suzanne Dowling, the Housing Committee, and Dean Smith: Recently :-.,uzanne Dowling set forth the Proposal f. or Dormitory Use - Academic Year 77-78. In this proposal many items are suggested. Among these items are the housing ol fraternities and Sororities, the rearrangement of male: , female living space, and the creation of three (3) freshmen dormttories. 1 am led to believe that the reasons for freshmen dorms are: l) To group all freshmen together for the purpose ol having them acquaint themselves With other members of their class; and 2) To place freshmen in places where cooking facilities do not exist. The reasoning behind 112 is that freshmen are required to be on a meal plan and should not have need for nor should they u:,e cooking facilities. Ideas like this are far more idealistic than reahsuc because many people will do some cooking for themselvc:. if the} :,o desire regardless of whether or not they have proper facllit1e:,. l-or this reason, placing freshmen who desire to have cooking facilitie:. in a dorm which ha~ none is only going to increa~c a potenllal lire hazard. The reasoning behind Ill fall~ apart when you rcall£e that not only do you want freshmen to get to kno\ one another, but abo to get to know the whole college. In pas:,ing around a petition, man) people remarked that having uppcrclas:.mcn either a~ roummatc~ vi floor mates was a great asset to them in their freshman year. It ~~ true that the proposal allows lor upperclas:,men to occupy the singles in the dorms in question, but, not only are these a \a~t minority of spaces (20:1 OR WORSE), but I believe that not man) upperclassmen would want to alienate them:,che:, from the n;:,t ul the established college community to such an extent. 1-re:,hmen should become part of the college community; lhc) :.huuld ~0 I be so segregated from everyone ehc. I-urthc1, \1th the elimination of squatter\ rights no one an} longer i~ guaranteed ot being able to occupy the same room in sub~c~ucnt )Car:.. l he Housing Proposal goes one step beyond. It guarantee~ that freshmen will not (except possibly for singles) be allowed to occupy the same room in the year(s) to follow. Many dorms reqUire a lot ot maintenance. The proposed change will l>ring about a need lor even more maintenance costs in these buildings because many people, knowing that there is no chance of living in the same place again, will have less regard for the condition in which they leave the facilities. Next, the making of South into female hou!>ing, will leaH: l>nl) Webster for upperclassmen who wish to have an all male dorm. Webster has about 50 spaces. It is also the only dorm in \\ hich men have proper cooking facilities made available to them. Considering the number of upperclassmen now residing in hoth 'South and Webster, it would be quite a tax on the facilitie~. l nd~:r~tandabl), more women than men do their own l:ooking, and adm1ttcdl) Richmond, which has cooking facilitie!l would he made <1\ ailabk to men, but the idel! of an all male dorm is being overtaxed. It almo~t seems as if upper class women are getting preferential treatment. For the above stated reasons and more I al>k that the present uvusing proposal be re-evaluated to have it come more in line with what is realistic than with what is idealistic. -·-·····~··~- ........... ,.,.

Sincerely, Lou Leatoo '77 HOUSING serious reevaluatlan Dear Editor! As a concerned freshman, I would like to briefly comment on Ms. Dowling's housittg proposal for next year. Ms. Dowling's proposal seems to follow a typical administrativt pattern that has consistently alienated the college community witb respect to tlte age and sex. of its students. I think that as a freshman, one of the most important experiences tor me was havia~ the ability to live with older students. of both sexes, a11:d learn to adjust to college life, witb the help of these students. Ms. Dowling's proposal seetns lacking in this respect. Two of Ms. Dowlinfs housing proposals need sofli~ serious reevaluation. First, by having West College all freshmen and coed, tlt:e freshman sect of the college is alienated. There-certainly rnust be a better solution than this. Secondly, by making Davidson all freshman males, you further the problem ~f alienation. As a potential sophomore, I find myself with only two options in regard to coed housing. l can either live in Richmond on the 4th floor o:r Fox on the 3rd floor. What kind <Jf choice is this? If Union College expects to have a tighter, more closely knit community, then let's start attacking the problem from the roots. The current housing proposal is one of these roots.

Page 10 CONCORDIENSJS, Apri/.13, 1977 The result of hypertension Summer Session by ED P AIKOFF Union College for the first time since 1962 will run a full day program of college courses this summer. In past summers the college operated evening courses as part of . the Continuing Education Program along with special Institutes for engineers and scientists. The campus was also rented out to cross-country, soccer and basketball camps. According to Dr. Aaron Feinsot, Dean of Graduate Studies and Continuing Education, the decision to start a. full day program along with the existing evening- program was administrative in nature. The college wanted to continue educational activities during the summer months, increase the efficiency of the college facilities, by utilizing them year round, and increase revenue for the school. The college has no intention of instituting a 4 quarter system' similar to Dartmouth's calendar. The structure of the courses will be the same as during the regular academic year. E:ach department was asked to supply courses and faculty for the summer session. Regular faculty members of the college will teach the courses many of whom are senior members .of their departments. This differs from other summer school programs where courses are taught by junior members of the faculty or visiting instructors. The courses will have the same academic standards as regular session courses. Administration of .this program will be from Wells House and it will be directed by Professor R. ·Schaefer of the Chemistry Department. Professor Studies Hypertension Admission to the summer session will differ from normal procedures. There will be virtually an open enrollment. This will include students regularly attending other colleges, high school students wishing to experience college level courses and regular students of Union Coflege. Richmond and South dormitories will be open for students wishing to live on campus. Hypertension, more simply known as high blood pressure, affects an estimated 24 million people in this country, directly causes more than 65,000 deaths a year, and is a major factor in the nearly 1 million deaths caused annually by diseases of the circulatory system. ln addition to personal losses, hypertension also costs businesses heavily in terms of days lost, hospital and physician fees, loss of productivity due to illness, and premature mortality. In an effort to find a way to reduce the high costs exacted by hypertension, the Bureau of the . Disease Control of New York Health Department, has granted $44,000 toward research by Ed ward Hannan, assistant 'professor of administration and management. The 33-year old management scientist, assisted by four Union graduate students, is studying the \cost-effectiveness\ for private business and industry of establishing in-company programs to screen employees to treat those who are hypertensive. Affecting nearly one in three adults, hypertension is unrivalled by other serious diseases on the basis of prevalence alone. What makes it particularly troublesome is that it carries virtually no external symptoms. In fact, says Dr. Hannan, virtually half of those afflicted by hypertension, which greatly increases the risk of cort.tracting heart attacks, strokes, and kidney disfunctions,. don't even know they have it. Furthermore, only half of those who realize they are hypertensive undergo treatment to counter it, he says. To make matters worse, only about half of those having their hypertension treated are getting adequate treatment. Thus only about an eighth of those who are hypertense are receiving adequate treatment for the malady, Dr. Hannan says. To bnng about a reduction in the incidence of hypertension requires advances on two fronts, Dr. Hannan says. First, a higher rate of detection of the disease, and second, an increase in the treatment \adherence rate\ - that is, the percentage of people who maintain tr(:atment for a disease or illness. A number of health officials, both within the state and beyond, believe that at least a partial · answer to both problems may lie in screening and treatment programs sponsored by business and maustry. Many hypertensive patients first learn of their ailment in company physicals. But . health officials think this number can be greatly increased. . . .

They would prefer that, rather than simply advising a hypertensive individual to seek treatment from his family doctor, the company physician administer a program of hyperten-sion treatment himself. Accordmg to Prof. Hannan, such a program is likely to have a much larger chance of success than one left up to the individual. While about 50 percent of those who know they are hypertensive actually achieve significant blood pressure reductions, the figure rises to between 80 and 90 percent in experimental programs which deliver treatment to a. patient at his place of work. This increase is explained, said Prof. Hannan, by the effect of peer pressure and close supervision by the company's medical staff. Furthermore, the cost of the treatment is born by the company, not the employee. morbidity and mortality trends, they are developing a model ~ . . - wh1ch will enable any company to predict both the costs and benefits of instituting a hypertension screening and treatment program. By simply knowing the cumulated age, sex, race and blood pressure \distribution\ of its employees, a firm will be able to estimate what such a program will cost and the savings which may result. At work on the project since September, Dr. Hannan expects to submit his finding to the Bureau of Disease Control this summer. Assisting Dr. Hannan on the project are graduate students Ken Graham, of Albany; Ken Fordyce, of Pearl River, N.Y.; Jim Stang, of Lake Forest, Ill.~ and Peter Duchessi, of Amsterdam, N.Y. The school is running advertisements for this program in regional and downstate newspapers including the Sunday New York Times. The summer sessions will give students the opportunity also to take graduate level courses without the normal course load of a regular term. Several new graduate programs are being planned for future summers. Dean Feinsot felt that the beauty of the campus in the summer plus the academic reputation of Union would make the program attractive to prospective students. A complete summer session · catalog is available at Wells House - The Graduate and Continuing Education office. Will the savings to a tum resulting. from the lower insurance premiums, reduced mortality payments, and less sick time outweigh the cost of mounting a program against hypertension and thus make it \profitable?\ That's what Prof. Hannan and his associates want to find out.

. ,,· ASK THE GEEK Dear Geek: I have a very large nose. While this does not necessarily detract from my ravishing features and 'seductive wench' status per se, my unt.Jsually bountiful honker has been the cause of many an embarrassing situation. Once, at an intimate dinaer party with some friends, I happened to sneeze discreetly over something I smelled which I was allergic to. Within seconds, the. sky was darkened by hordes of love- starved Canadial) geese who mistook my sniffle for a mating call. Needless to say, all the uncover-ed food was ruined; boy was l blushing! Anyway, my question is: am 1 overreacting? Signed, Confused And Bewildered. Dear CAB: Overreacting? Nonsense! A pronouQ.ced proboscis is a sign of noble bearing and a physical manifestation of your inner graciousness; not, as many ,petite- nosed naysayers would have it, a big ugly cumbersome thing stuck in the middle of your face for comic relief and to scare away the flies. Now, if you had horrid frizzy black hair which you had to lubricate constantly AND a. big nose, THEN I'd be worried. Dear Ge~k: I thmk your column (if one can dignify such a disturbed melange of stomach- unsettling innuendos with such a term) is one of the most tasteless reflections on a sick cultute that I have ever been exposed to. It gives new meaning to the word 'banal.' lt causes old men to run around and act silly, and scares pregnant women. Is there no decency in the world? If I were your editor, I'd have you shot for assholiuess in the first degree. Signed, Divine. Dear Divine: I stand admonished. Tell Edie her omelet's getting cold. Students!!!

People approach me and express their feelings. My final source is the peti·tion which has· been circulating around these past days. The petition, as I understand it, has been signed by over 300 people. It asks Ms. Dowling and the Hou!!ing Committee to reconsider the proposal. That's a lot of people. Concordy: What can be done? Jenkins: Well, I tried an interesting route just a few hours ago. I attended an Agenda Committee meeting of the College Senate and discussed the possibility of placing a proposal to void the proposed restructuring on the Senate's agenda. Research showed that while such a counter- proposal voiding the Housing recommendations could be successfully introduced at the Senate level, it would probably be a better idea to wait and see what Ms. Dowling and the Housing Committee finally agree upon on April 19th. If their actions are unsatisfactory, then ail appeal to Dean Smith would be -the next logical step, followed by an appeal to the Provost, followed by - oh well, surely wisdom will prevail by that point So, what to do at this stage is really important. Write a letter to Suzanne and tell her why you're unhappy (or happy) over the proposal. Stop in her office and tell her again. There is nothing better than a constant flow of disagreeing people in and out of your office tc;> affect your opinion. Have your RA get a Housing Committee member to come to your floor in order to allow you to tell them why you're unhappy. The members are: Dawn Porto (RA, Edwa~:ds); Peter Barron (3.16 West); Robert Catellano (Phi Sigma Kappa); and John Schorr (153 Fox). lf they can;t come to you, go to them, call them, etc. Each of the!)e mctiii bets of the Housing Committee has one vote on· the finalization of assignments for next year. On the committee there are four students, one administrator (Dowling), and one staff member. As you can see, the students have the majority in their hands. They are important people who undoubtedly need harassment. Their Votes are final. Just don't let them get away untouched by your vast and unending supply of knowledge. Concordy: Anything else? Jenkins: Write, write, write! Go see Sl!Zanne. Bother Dawn; attack Peter; and don't let Bob or Jon get away either. No action means no results, and no results tneans the students lose again.

.. • t t l I CONCORDIENSIS, Aprill3, 1977 Page 15 5ports Improved Baseball Teain Opens S~ason Many major league baseball teams seem to have a problem adjusting to the often harsh northern weather conditions after a long spring training period in · sunny Florida. The Unian College baseball team will have no such problem. Using the fieldhouse as their training grounds, the Dutchmen have been working hard since February to achieve opening day form. This years' squad, coached by Tom Cahill, will try to improve on last year's disappointing 1-1 H season. As Cahill sees it, the potentia] for a fine season is already there and the team needs only to put it all together with a solid outfield and potent hitting attack. Hopes seem to hinge on a young, inexperienced infield and a promising pitching staff. The outfield is patrolled by Gary Borgese,. Dan DeGregory, and Carmen Gatta all experienced veterans. Borgese, better known for his exploits on the basketball court, distinguished himself last year by -hitting .333 for the Dutchmen. DeGregory and Gatta both .250 plus hitters will add strength to the Union offense. The pitching game is especially important on the college level. The Union staff is a blend of experience and youth. Senior ace Charlie Flanagan returns to the mound with the poise of a seasonc;!d veteran, Sophomore Paul Brown and freshman southpaw Joe Lavery, who will add some smoke to the Union rotation, are the other keys to the pitching game. The infield, although not set yet, .promises to be predominently freshmen. A solid infield will greatly aid the Union cause this season. The catching job will be ably shared by sophomores Chris Massaroni and Denis Gazzola who also split the duties last year. The first four out of five of Union's six.teen games will be ,played on the opposition's home ground. This will give the Union grounds crew time to work on a modified Alexander field diamond. The schedule this year includes traditionally tough Siena, Colgate and Rochester, all of whom have had a week's play • in Florida. With solid infield play and a clutch pitching game _ the prospects for Union baseball 1977 loom bright. Continued on Page 1 6 Indoor Track Ends - Outdoor Begins by ROCKY DOLAN Looking ahead, Coach Ken Michelsen is anxiously awaiting the start of the Spring season April 16. The Dutchmen open thetr I 0- meet schedule on that date in a triangular meet against .Brockport State and \Albany State at Albany. This meet is not crucial to the team's plans for the season, but for .a special reason, it is· at this point very dear to the members of the team. Coach Michelsen, it has been learned, may he coaching his last Union Track meet on this date. The weekend following this meet, Michelsen is reporting to Ellis Hospital for back surgery to correct a chronic disc problem. At the same time, it has a:lso been learned that Michelsen has accepted the position .of head football coach at St. Johnsbury Academy, in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, starting this fall and so the most recent stage of his distinguished coaching career may be drawing to a close on this Saturday. Michelsen's Union Track career · has been nothing short of outstanding. Inheriting a successful team in December 1971, the 1967 Upper Iowa Uni- versity graduate immediately b~­ gan looking for better things. In 1974, for the first time ever, the Union t~am won its own 22-year old invitational tournament, rated by some as the most prestigious event in New York State winter track. In I 975-76, working solely with athletes that he had brought to Union himself, his team was rated first in the state, and indeed, won the state tourney over many other larger and highly rated squads. Fibally, in the 1976-77 season, Union athletes gained national recognition, ten school records were broken, and two of · his charges placed in national competition. In Michelsen's six years at Union, all but three of the indoot and outdoor school records have fallen to his athletes, a list of accomplishments that should speak well of the man in charge. Michelsen discounts such credit. \You have to give the credit to them,\ motioning to some runners working on the track. Asked to explain his secret of success, he grinned and said, \I've only gone after those boys ; that I thought would do well here ' on their own merit - cifter that it's just a little hard work.\ His pride iQ. his team was obvious as he talked, ' 6 in six years there has only been one athlete on this team lost for academic reasons - the boys are great, they help each other out.\ The team members, however, see things differently. \When he came here, he wasn't a distance coach, but in six years has learned an incredible amount,\ says middle-distance star Bob Moffatt. Michelsen indeed, came here as a field event and sprints coach. The departure of Michelsen is a sad event; it can only be hoped that this man's achievements with his team will be recognized and acknowledged during this last season of his at Union. Pitcher Flanagan gets ready for opener. Lacrosse Crushes Hartwick by ROBERT GRUSKY Last Saturday, on a snowy April day in Schenectady, the Dutchmen outclassed the Hartwick Lacrosse team to the tune of 23-2. The ganw was originally scheduled at Hartwick, but the flooding of their field forced the game to be played on our own Gattis field. This explains why Hartwick wore their home uniforms and had the last line change. All this was to no a vail as the powerful Union contingent proceeded to dominate all aspects of the game. Early in the first period John Thompson came from behind the cage firing low to open up the game's scoring. This was followed by goals by Rich Easton and Thompson again. Then, a Hartwick . player showed his ignorance of the game by tossing his stick into the air in an attempt to intercept a Union pass. He immediately was given a penalty, during which the Union offense showed good movement but was unable to convert a score. The next goal of the period was scored by Stu Napear, who took a feed from John. Thompson and picked his corner to make the score 4 to 0. John Thompson closed out the scoring for the period, assisted by a good pass from Jim Felix. The second period opened with AI Greenburg stopping the first Hartwick scoring threat on a shot from-Clancey. Moments later,. trying to bring the ball out of his own zone, he was leveled by two Hartwick players and forced to leave the game. The wiry sophomore showed his courage by shaking it off and returning to action moments later. Union then began to dominate as Jed Kanner took a pass from freshman Rob Sherman beating the Hartwick goalie on his left. Moments later John Thompson fed Stu Napear, who simply powered a tipoff by the Hartwick goalie into the net to make it 7-0. Then Hartwick scored its first goal of the game, as Bird poked in a rebound after AI Greenburg had made the initial stop. Union retaliated by goals from Neil Kanner and Carl Walker. Hartwick then scored what can only be described as a \sleazy\ goal. Union came right back as Rich Easton fed Neil Kanner who fired a perfect bounce pass to make the score 10-2. At the half, the sixty or so loyal spectators rushed the field house to thaw out. The Union team was thinking up theirscoring and the Hartwick team was praying for it to end painlessly. Union did all the scoring in the second half, and the third period opened quickly with goals by Don Corchoran, John Thompson, and senior Hank Flemming. Rich Easton made the score 14-2 with a hard shot, followed by a Brian Walk goal, which scored in a scramble in front of the net. Ray Stecker, making a great play, fought off an illegal check, went around another defender, and placed the ball past the by now shell-shocked Hartwick goalie. Jed Kanner then fed younger brother Neil, who cut from behind the net and fired low past the Hartwick goalie. The 18th goal was scored in a scramble in front of the net, as Hank Flemming out-fought the Hartwick defenders for the ball and fired it home. Then freshman Rob Sherman went around three Hartwick players and popped it in to make it 19-2. The next three goals were scored by Rich Romer, John Thompson and Rich Easton.

... Page 16 Track Continued from Page 15 Throughout the year's events, the Union Indoor Track team has devastated opposing fieldhouse and their own school record books: Union athletes broke 36 fieldhouse and school records d uFing the season. By winter's end, Union athletes had set ll new school records. Bob Moffatt was unbeaten in every regular seasen six hundred yard dash, and breke a fieldhouse record in every regular season race he ran. His best time was I: I 0. 7, good for the state as well as school record, and placed second in the 1C4A's. Kevin Scheuer set .standards in the half mile (I :50.8), the mile ( 4: 14.0), and the thousand (2:10.8). Kevin was unbeaten in the thousand and mile during the regular season and placed fifth in the IC4A thousand . Matt Blum set a 55 high hurdles mark of 6.9, and also set a state and school mark in the 60 high hurdles by running 7.4 seconds to win the state meet. Mark Decker tied Blum's record of 6. 9 in the 55 high hurdles by being co-champion (with Blum) of the Syracuse Invitational. Earl Chilton set a triple jump record of 46-\1.!, and Dave Cozzens, a freshman, broke the high jump record by clearing 6- 8Vz. The team of Pete Vielkind, Kevin Scheuer, Bob Moffatt, and Matt Guilfoyle combined to set a mile relay record of 3:19.5, and Moffatt, Scheuer, and Vielkind joined with Stan Wiskoski to eclipse the two-mile relay mark by clocking 7:44.5.

The final score was 23-2, as Union was devastating on offense. The ability of the mid-field and the attack to control the ball and score consistently led to an easy day for the defense and goalie, who went untested.

ElliS HoSpital by hope j. fabian The Union College Infirmary has a tendency to send students to Ellis Hospital for lab tests, x-rays and other medical services that it cannot provide itself. Aside from any other considerations, financially, Ellis is not always the best choice. At the beginning of April (after the new year's prices had been established) three hospitals within reasonable proximity to the Union College campus were surveyed in concern to the cost of the medic;~! services they provide. These were: Ellis Hospital, located at 1101 Nott Street; St. Clare's Hospital at 600 McClellan Street in Schenectady, and St. Peter':> Hospital at 315 South Manning Blvd. in Albany. Each hospital was asked the cost of five specific services and all the .prices listed below are as quoted from the office of the - CBC Basic llrin· controller of each hospital. Obviously, these five samples cannot constitute an all inclusive statement on the financia1 polieies of these hospitals; but they are some of the tests commonly used by the student body. Ellis Hospital is in walking distance from the college and seemingly knows it, as illustrated by the cost of some of their services. In all but one instance, it charges more for the same services provided at the two other hospitals. There is no reason for Ellis to hold a monopoly on students' medical needs; nor for students to accept overpriced medic.al se.rvices out of convenience or ignorance. None of the hospitals illustrated any reservations about quoting their prices over the phone; by making such an inquiry, it seems that there is some money to be saved.

On tile whole, I found that the new system is much better although there still are .some unsolved problems. The old government consisted of 8 faculty members, 4 Division Chainnen, 6 undergraduate students, 1 graduate student, 2 Academic Deans, the Dean of Students, and the President as Chairman (he only votes in case of a tie). The Agenda Committee decided what topics should be brought to the Councils. With tne new government, the total number of faculty is the same (12) with an option to go to 11;- but the number of students has increased from 7 to 10, giving the students a much greater voice in matters.

In the old government, the by bill malnick students were elected according to which division they were in, what their major was, regardless what class (year) they were in.

The smaller committees should lead to better communication.

The exchange took place in the Dutch Ho1low which was entertaining two social functions: career night for recent women graduates, which Kershner was attending, and a dinner for Robert Reed, which Smith was attending. The encounter took place directly after a very heated faculty meeting concerning the future state of Union's athletic program. According to a proposal presented by Professor Charles Gati (who was not a witness to the incident) in a Division H meeting, Dean Smith was reported to say, ..

Dean Smith claimed that the account of his statement to Kershner, as reported in the Division II minutes, is \absolutely inaccurate.\ He declined, though, to provide his own account due to the possibility of biasing the upcoming investigation. Smith also declined that there was any such \Enemies List\ (or which has now been infamously called the second Dean's List). There is a theory which contends that Dean Smith was drunk. According to Smith, this is impossible since the faculty meeting ended at approximately 6:05 p.m. and the statement was made at 6:20, at which time he had not even started his beer. The Division II proposal requested that \The Presidential Advisory Board initiate a full and fair investigation of this incident and of any related charges which may arise against Dean Smith, and prepare a thorough review of the propriety of his conduct as Dean of Students, of Union College.

We are not out to conflict with Concordy; rather we exist to supplement them - to answer-the questions they cannot; to raise the questions they will not. We will investigate any interesting, relevant issue no matter how \controversial\ it is. We ask for y~ur help and .support in our quest to help you. Consistency \the hockey program of Union College as conducted to date has been inspiring and helpful to all constituencies of the college.\ Campus Chronicle vol.3 #11 March 31, 1977 (emphasis added) Ned Harkness knowingly violated the recruiting rules of NESCAC and Union. He proceeded to institute a cover-up, perhaps even causing students to peijure themselves. He then lied to his superior, President Bonner. When confronted with evidence contrary to his statement, he admitted his lies. Bonner suspended Harkness for a two week period of investigation. On March 31, Ned Harkness was fully reinstated by the Board of Trustees and praised for \inspiring\ direction of the hockey program. No mention has been publicly made of ~he unethical and immoral nature of his actions. We are now faced with a similar situation. Jay Shupe, like Harkfess, violated standards and instituted a cover-up .. But, Shupe came forth on his own volition, admitted his mistake and submitted his resignation. It appears obvious that Shupe feels his actions were wrong; Harkness does not. Will Shupe become the scapegoat for the immoral and unethical actions that have been rampant in our hockey program? Or shall he also be praised for his \inspiring and helpful\ supervision of the admission process? Either way, a precedent has been set. Applying the procedure used in the Harkness incident to student problems, it appears that the Conduct Obudsman Committee should fo)d. What will they be needed for? In the future, a student who cheats, is then accused and denies the cheating until confronted with concrete evidence, cannot be punished or reprimanded in any way, if we are to be consistent. In fact, the student's handling of the situation should be publicly cited as \inspiring and helpful.\ Returning to reality, it is not believable that the above will ever happen. Obviously, the administration believes that it is who you are, not what is right or wrong that is important. The question of who and how many in the administration and faculty support such a double, or lack of, standards becomes imperative when· considering the future of the college. Dr. Bonner's statement of October 29, 1976 that ''standards of responsible behavior at this college are essential and must be the concern of everyone,\ (emphasis added) is right on the mark. In other words, if you're not part of the solution, you're a major part of the problem. But, is there a solution? Will it be enough to uncover the lies and violations that have been committed? The campus is already divided and demoralized, probably past the point of being satisfied only with investigations. There is only one path to bringing standards of ethics, excellence, and truth back to Union: resignation of the instigators of the lies. a Declaration of Independence was written in 1776 that, in my opinion, merits a reevaluation in, terms of our situation here at THE VOtc,e: Union College. .130X· While it is true that this. latter document established no real legal rights or duties and was not judicially enforceable, it set forth a phllosophy of government that has come to be the cornerstone of OU[' society. 1 would like to draw certain analogies between this document and our present state of affairs at Union College.

To The Editors To the Editors, What kinds of limitations should be placed on Union College students? Just how much work should they be expected to toil over? Perhaps these questions have not recently been asked by any of our .illustrious administrators; but the answers to these questions have been indirectly relayed. Union College students are limited by time. So many things are expected of a Union student, yet there never seems to be enough time to do everything. In trying to finish all the work by specific deadlines, many students find their stomachs turned due to an incredible intake of coffee. Why go through the stomach pains? There is another way: SPEED. This single word represents, to many students, the difference between A,B and a C. The questien to ask is why? Why should an intelligent student with relatively few poor study habits feel forced to take speed in order te pass a course? There is definitely something wrong! Sure, the work gets done, but the pressure is unnecessary. There is more to college than work. A person needs time to himself to venture in personal endeavors. However, with the pressure of a large work load, the social life of a· student often has to be sacrificed. But this should not be. Where does the fault lie? Are Union College students to blame; or is it the fault of the administrators? Does the pressure stem from our calendar, whereby there are three sets of finals to prepare for?

. ,, Smith !to Smith, when Kershner approached hitn and asked if he {Smith) was going to eat. Kershner felt the incident\ was sigJJ.ificant enough to report, not because of the obscenity involved, even though he believed it'to be inappropriate in context; but because he felt that Smith was attempting to intimidate not himself, but the less senior, untenured professors Who might :not go along with the popular consensus of the administration. The matter was brought to the PAB, which is a catch-all committee for everything that is not provided for by any other conunittees in governance structure. Their original move was to instigate a full career review of· Dean Smith and they proposed to make an ad hoc committee consisting of the Student Life Committee (which is charged with the annual review of Co~tinued front Page 1 Dean Smith) and three additiona'f faculty members. Dean Smith's major contention is that the whole basis for any action is the content of a private conversation with a · friend in a social context. Accordingly, such .a conversation should never be used as the impetus of an administrator's full career review. Further he claims that he was not given an opportunity to respond to the allegations. Nor w~s Enteman, Smith's supervisor, properly consulted. It was also felt by other administrators (Debbie Kilgus, Craig Carlson, and Theresa Ambrusco) that a new review procedure was being established where one already existed in the present governance system. The decision was made by the PAB to ress;:ind the charge of this Continued on Page 4 Welcome to Uni(m: Where are you living next year? The Horrors of Housing During the past week, the new Director of Housing posted a general plan for next year's housing arrangements. These proposed arrangements include: turning Davidson into an all male freshmen dorm; turning South College into an all female freshmen dorm; turning Richard House into a coed dorm (alternating male and female floors with the top floor being coed by room); turning West College into an all freshmen dorm; and finally, playing hop-· scotch with the new sororities, the new fraternity, and a number of old fraternities. The plan did not appear with any explanation or rationale. There are many problems which will undoubtedly arise if this plan is implemented. One of the most serious inadequacies of this proposal stems from the segregation of freshmen and upperclassmen with the creation of ali-freshmen dorms. There are on the average five hundred incoming freshmen each year. By making West and South house only freshmen, all female freshmen will be segregated into fre.shmen dorms, and a large percentage of male freshmen will be isolated from upperclassmen as welL What, if any, is the purpose for this quarantine? Students have not established any measures intent upon separate social functions on this campus on the basis of class, nor does there appear to be any desire for such structures. There seems inlltead to be an interaction between students of all ages that Union should . be proud of. Interaction between the classes is one of the most important elements of a campus which ·is striviJJ.g to perpetuate 'an atmosphere · of community involvement. Furthermore, by creating all freshman dorms, Miss Dowling will have successfully managed to take a giant step backwards in time to the days of the \freshmen beanies,\ in the 40's, 50's, and early 60's. Freshrnen, forced to interact exclusively with other · freshmen because of their physical segregation, will develop a \class consciousness\ which will spiritually segregate freshmen from the rest of the campus community. A small institution like Union cannot afford to polarize small segments of its population, let alone the entire freshman class. Besides academics, people learn from people; by delineating a campus into \new\ and \experienced an important socialization process is halted. Freshmen will be cut off from the benefits of meeting and-learning from oldet students. Older students will have less opportunity to meet freshmen and participate in a most gratifying aspect of learning, that of helping and teaching others. Assuming that most freshmen will arrive at Union having left home for the first , time, one cannot help but wonder how these freshmen will learn to adapt to campus life without interacting with upperclassmen in their dormitories. Even with the present housing arrangements, rumors and misinformation (about classes, professors, and much else) seem to plague many freshmen. One can conjure up images of the destructive Davidson-North-South wars of a few years ago, and of R.A.'s swamped with adjustment problems and questions which would have previously been mitigated by upperclassmen living on the floor. The plan may cause other problems as well. The reduction of traditionally ·preferred \corner suite\ housing for upperclassmen in Davidson, and the loss of the sought after fourth floor South College housing for senior men, coupled with the displacement of upperclasswomen who prefer the environment offered them by Richmond House, may serve to effectively move a great segment of upperclassmen out of the dorms and into off-campus apartments. One must wonder what divine inspiration caused Miss Dowling to propose a plan which may open a Pandora's box of social problems at Union. Dowling's plan appears to be the most regressive plan proposed in ages. Her apparent attempt to bulldoze student opinion by not publishing a rationale, and not holding hearings on the issue can only cause students to believe that she is not familiar with Union's student body, their life styles, and their housing preferences. Union has not had much b1ck lately in handling the side effects of decisions dictatorially imposed by administrators. Miss Dowling's plan will be no different. If her plan is worth anything it will hold up to campus scrutiny. As stated in last week's issue of \Concordiensis the Housing Committee will issue the final proposals after campus feedback. If student sentiment is expressed, it can make a difference in what on-campus housing will be like for '77-'78.

Howevtr, there are other ways around the problem. For example, if school started a week earlier than it does presently, we could tack on one to two days at the end of each term to be used as reading days. Union starts so late in September that starting a week earlier than usual wouldn't be too terribly painful. This, however, is merely a suggestion; it must be kept in mind that if the required number of hours per course is to be met, there must be some compensation for the time that reading days would use up. Another, perhaps more appealing, suggestion would be to lengthen class time by five minutes. This would result in twenty extra minutes a week, or three and a third extra hours per term. Those extra hours could be put towards reading days. Many colleges and universities on the semester system, including Barnard, Cornell, and Harvard, allot anywhere from two to seven days between the end of classes and the beginning of exams for studying. The fact that they are a semester system probably facilitates more flexibility in maneuvering the schedule; but it is certainly not inconceivable that a tri-mester system could also work something out. Thomas Jefferson University which is on the tri-mester system, is one such example. Their 1975-76 school year ran from 9/15 to 6/8, with two days per term (not including weekends) designated as reading days. Their fall term classes ended before Thanksgiving Recess, and upon returning to school, there were two days for studying, followed by exam week. There are problems with our exam system as a means for evaluating students other than the obvious lack of time for preparation. Some of these might stem from the way in which exams are scheduled throughout the week. Recall the student who has three finals in a row. If that same student had his/her exams scheduled on Mor:.day. Wednesday and Frida;,, (s)he would have considerably more time to prepare adequately. In addition, (s)he would be able to concentrate on each course one at a time, allowing better concentration on each subject. ln this case, circumstance alone plays a vital role in how well the student does. Still other problems arise from the two hour time limit for most exams; the professor who crams half the course into the last two weeks of the term; and the tri-mester system itself. Of course, the student is at fault himself sometimes, and no matter how equitable a system we have, there will be times when finals week will still be quite painful. In fact, it will probably never be enjoyable, and no one would expect it to be, but there is a crucial need for improvement in the system so that unnecessary pressures are eliminated and the student who has worked and learned throughout the term gets a chance to perform to the best of . his or her ability.

Page 4 Union College Voice ROVING REPORTER by jan rosker sue lightman and john tydings QUESTION: What do you know about Union College and do you feel it is a benefit to the area in any way? Maureen Vena .... records I know Union is here but it does not really matter. I have heard about Union hockey and I know when I go to a bar I am bound to see tJ nion students there. Steve Waltman - s.c.c.c. student I know Union is a good school. I have a few relatives that went there. I follow the sports activities closely and I use the rink regularly. I would like to see hockey go Division I. : Vince Ruzzo - waterbeds I think Union is a social advantage for me because I live in an area where a lot of students are living. The students at Union are a different type of people. They are nice to have around. Union sports add something to the area beca11se people need a local team to follow even if they do not go to the games. ,,.· ·:·~ :·- . . ·--~~~;. ·: ·--~~ : Mrs. Pettica - bookstore Union College has been here a long time, and it certainly is a good thing. I come in contact with Union students. I c~nnot see any disadvantages to having the college here. Mike Brown - businessman Although I am not very familiar with the school, I can see where sports and cultural activities add to life in the area. I attend some of these activities and I worked for a drama activity last year. Karen McKechnie - salesgirl It helps the community by adding more dollars to the economy. The scltool brings in cultural events we would not otherwise have here. Achilles Rink is fantastic. You also have a great library. I use it all the time. Robert Lessner - Gershon's For businessmen, it's great for the economy because it brings more ·money into the community. Also, for kids from the area who do not or cannot go away to school, there is a great school right in their backyards. lt is also nice for someone like me who wants to take a course. I took a course last year that I really liked. Joe Ross - businessman 1 think the school is an asset to the community. The education offered can only benefit local industry. I have been to some sports events and I am glad they reinstated Coach Harkness. Ed Brennan - travel agent I am from outside of this area but I have heard of Union. They have a good electrical engineering department and a good psychology department from what I know. I have never heard anything negative about the school. Joan BrowneD - housewife Although I do not have personal contact with students at Union, it is a convenient location for kids in the area who want to go to a good school. I think the college is an asset to the area. Eileen Price - pet store I have heard of the school but I have no contact With the college at all. The only thing I have heard recently is about the new Achilles ! Heel Rink because it has been in the papers. 1977 Student Government Continued fro!ll Page l power has become more .

Smith Continued from Page 3 committee and reevaluate the situation and the correct procedure indicated. Up until recently, very little had been done. But the Campus Voice learned late Monday evening, April 11, from a P AB source that the President's Advisory Board would undertake the investigation itself. The charge of the committee would be t;wofold: first it is to conduct a careful review and investigation of the events of March 4, 1977 in the Dutch Hollow Pub; second it is to look into any similar incidents which may have occurred involving Smith. It is not, however,. a full career review. Whereas the whole incident is disturbing and it seems to be just another chapter in this tumultuous period of Union College history, it is merely a symptom of an all encompassing disease which we are all allowing ourselves to be stricken with. We have watched grown men of high intellectual ability act as if they were children. We may be about to witness a witch-hunt reminiscent of old Salem. We have stood by and watched our campus become polarized to an extreme extent. All of this has come about because of one thing - hockey. It is time for us to .stand back and tal{e a clear view of ourselves and what this issue is doing to us. . Hockey is ·an excitmg sport which has brought with its arrival a much needed rejuvenating boost. However, its sudden success has also brought with it deleterious side effects. I am not espousing that we go Division I or I I, rather I am shocked by what the accompanying controversy has brought with it. Admission and recruitment violations have been uncovered, and there are theories that high level administrators have cond.oned such actiVIties. Administrators have opposed each other, faculty has opposed administrators, and vice versa. There are many who believe that this school has lost sight. of its .. mission.\ Is all this worth it? One of the most ironic points in this issue is that of publicity. A major point in favor of going Divisiati I is the intent of making Union a more common household word. Hopefully, its other attributes would shine once people were introduced to the school. However; recently the publicity has been all but good. The incident involving Ned Harkness was written up in The New York Times, and a Channel Six news team was combing the campus investigating Jay Shupe's resignation. The athletics issue is .doing for Union College what Watergate did for the Republican Party. However, this is not justification for leaving certain truths undiscovered. So, if the state of Union College athletics is going to tear this campus apart, then its escalation is not worth it. We had expected hockey to build and enhance our school, not test the resilience of the institution. Let us not be like Icarus, who flew so close. to the sun that his artificial wings melted and he fell to his demise. Jolly Tiger • Bengal Being across the street from the college is a big plus. Your students increase our business and besides the guys there account for 90 percent of our waitresses' social activities. ·'.':'~~~ ·<fi(lJIJ:' '::;: on· l pritpc ·Bo-'Wl TMt~v pattel alb~ I ·M,i\lilSfffidijj ,,,;,1'\llltf.ttiJ~ ., 'Mf'X\lit'$1 · -:1t:iWC!f.i •\'-4a~:lil ,.

The committee is composed of students Jim · trump and Donna Sockell, Acting Athletic Director Craig Carlson, Ptof. Tom Werner of the Chemistry Dept., Bob Driscoll, Bill Scanlon, and Bob Magee of the Athletic Dept., Starr Reagen from the President's office, and Debbie Kilgus of the Alumni Office. Also working with the committee .is Prof. Ken Schick of the Physics Dept. The committee members have reviewed the credentials of 125 applicants for the position. Of these 125, six were selected to vi:.!it Union. They met with the Search Committee, the Athletic Committee, Ken Schick,. and Provost Enteman. (Following a recommendation of the Task Force on Athletics, Pres. Bonner has transferred the At}JlttiC' Dept. to the responsibility · Center of Prov. Enteman. Previously the athletic director reported to the president.) The names of the six cannot be revealed at this time, but Craig Carlson indicated that one of them was a woman. Within two weeks the committee will narrow the choice to 2 ·or 3 and invite these peQple to come back in May. They will meet with several groups and individuals on campus. Craig Carlson stresses that the committee is looking for a strong athletic director who will set clear directions and guidelines.

Division I issue. · . The week prior to the Trustee meeting saw a final flurry of memoranda that only served to aggravate a situation on campus that had dearly transcended Hockey. Both the facult:Y, trustees and the President had sent conflicting reports to the trustees <il!- the reasons why the campus has been paralyzed. The faculty trustees,. Professors Schick and Thomas had focused on administrative behavior while President Bonner had attacked the campus governance structure. There was much activity on campus prior to the Trustee meeting. A special <:ommittee, chaired by PFofessor Neal Allen of History, and including Professor William Martin of Chemistry, Professor William Thomas, students Andy Koblenz and Chris Taylor (the last three campus trustees). was actively investigating breaching of standards in Admissions and other areas as they· relate to the Issue she said the intention of giving the Pre£eptors a reduction in their teaching load was to provide theM with mote time to have available for advising. Professor Schick stated that he would like to see what the advising system can accomplish and would vote against the amendment. This amendment was defeated. The entire Freshman Preceptorial Program, as amended, was approved without dissent. . Dean Brownlee, working with Department Chairmen, will now begin the process of setting up the Liberal Learning Program for implementation this fall. The last order of business was a proposal, approved by the Graduate Studies Committee, for new Masters in Business Administration Concentrations in {I) Quantitative Analysis and (2) Planning and Control. Dean of Graduate Studies Aaron Feinsot . ~xplained the proposal to the Senators. The proposal passed with a voice vote. j The next Senate meeting has beerucheduled for Tuesday, April 26, at 4:30 p.m. in the Old Chapel. The meetings are open, .and everyone is urged to attend. Senate Meeting In Order Hockey program. The committee had been formed following the Fesignation of Jay Shupe, Admissi-ons Director, and suspension and reinstatement of Ned Harkness . Other campus factions were active in the hectic week prior to the trustee meeting. A group of . students, including student government officers, many members of majo committees and Resident Advisers had sent a letter to the student trustees condemning the behavior surrounding the Hockey issue and urging the college to remain in NESCAC and not go Division l. Many Department Chairmen had sent a similar letter to the trustees. It was in. this climate of division that the trustees arrived on campus last Friday. The first trustee c6mmittee meeting dealing with the NESCAC-Division I issue was the Student Mfairs Committee, chaired by Kenneth Whalen. A :itraw vote was taken on NESCAC resulting in 4 trustees voting to leave the . conference,, 4 voting to remain, and one abstaining. 011 the issue of Division I, seven voted to remain in Division II. while two voted to go Divisioll I . It was on Saturday that, for reasons still unclear, Doctor Bonner submitte«l his resignation. The trustees voted not to acce.pt the President•s resigna~ion, pending an investigation by a special committee of tlie Board of the campus governance structure and the entire situation that has led to an unprecedented campus rift. The committee consists of Doctor lee Davenport, Chairman; Norton Reimes, Gerard Neumann, Arthur- Vash, and Ralph Bennett; all off- campus trustees. The committee immediately requested a \moratorium on communications\ dealing :with the controversial issues. A statement from Doctor Bonner to the Board was released by Doctor Davenport on Mo-nday. lt conta·ined a withdrawal of his resignation ..... I am continuing as President pending the outcome of the thorough Trustee review of the governance system of the campus and the President's authority and responsibility to lead.\ ·Apparently, the issue has finally reached the last step. The special committee of the Board will start on Saturday in an attempt to resolve the most explosive crisis to hit Union in years.

Union, with four of its eleven professors being logicians, felt inclined to sponsor such a conference. Over sixty logicians from nearly fifty schoois visited the camp.us to hear talks and discussions devoted to new research in the m::tin areas of logic; set theory, model theory and recursion theory. Among the fourteen lectures .and talks of the conference, many were given by three of the major American mathematicians: Thomas Jech· of Penn State; Gerald Sacks, holder of dual full Professorships at Harvard and MIT; and Angus Macintyre of Yale University. .

In any event, the future contains a bit of uncertainty; Being an. inquisitive guy, I decided to talk to some seniors and get . their feelings about leaving Union and what they plan to mGve on to. As far as specific plans go, I got the usual variety of answers. There are those who know where they'll be next year, whether it be a job, travel, or continued schooling. Among others, I talked to law students who are still waiting for replies, a medical student whe will be studying overseas, students who were not accepted at any graduate programs, and several people who are still waiting for job offers. Of far more interest, though, are these people's feelings as they prepare to enter this new phase of their lives. In almost all cases, the feeling !)eems to be one of confidence. Whatever their next step may be, these seniors feel ready and capable of taking it. I'm sure R.B. who is \scared and excited about leaving,\ spoke for many when he said that while he is not confident in his position, he is very confident in himself. The world of a student is a relatively secure one. To leave it is bound to cause some apprehension, right? Well, not always. Some do worry a bit, others said they were ready to leave; indeed, were looking forward to it. For many, four years is enough. \I think I've gotten about as much as I can from l1nion and now it's time to move on and use what I've gotten.\ Which brings us to my next questions: \'Just what did vou get out of Union'! Do you feel you could have gotten it somewhere else?\ The answers to these were more varied than those to previous questions. Some felt that Union did an especially good job of preparing them to face the future while others felt they could have gotten comparable, if not better, preparation elsewhere. For G.C. Union was instrumental in helping him form goals as well as preparing him to reach them. Some will miss Union dearly, others probably wouldn't come back if they had to do it again. There was one point on which all of our seniors agreed. And that was this: that their four years at Union helped them mature and grow as a person. And to quote no one in particular: \that's what it's all about, isn't it?\ As a personal favor, I would like to close by quoting Matt Brief: \Quote me!\ Proposal Tabled by ANDREW WISOFF Concordy has learned from a reliable source that· the original '\Proposal for Dormitory Use - Academic Year 1977-78\ has been tabled indefinitely..

In each square, a man is confined. Each man is self-occupied, picking at his shoes, picking at the lint on his square of rug. Every man is hopelessly quiescent. Except for McMurphy. McMurphy is .striding through the borders of the squares, shouting, gesturing. \Freeze!\ The entire checkerboard freezes, Stc:ve Solomon jumps out from the shadow behind the .green square. \McM1 take it back. You've got to .get in tlie hot spot of those lights. See, the area whe.ie it's most intense.\ . . . ' . As opening night approaches, it seems that you .could_ stand anywhere in the N ott, and be in the area where thjngs are most intense. Ideas are being snatched out of the air, executed or forgotten with a rapidity that's almost alarming. One of those ideas is that pattern of pure lights that's beamed on the stage. The pattern itself was designed by a computer program that Peter Crames wrote. An auxiliary control board for the lights was designed and built by Jim McConkey. And as opening night creeps - or rather gallops - up, Doug Heath is learning light cues. This is a student production. There are students working as actors, technicians, duectors and \runners\ to create their own \Nest.\ There's an enorrnous amount. of pride and effort that goes into any produ~tipfj',:' and· \One .Flew\ is no exceisti~&. · Director Steve Soiffifion is partly responsible for channeling the pride and the .effort, especially that of the actors. Some of the rehearsals wc:re held in an ensemble style, with actors picking up any line, whether it was their character's or not. To the uninitiated, an ensemble 'looks like a slippery verbal version of musical chairs. But for Steve, it was a method that concentrated ·:: . the ene(gies and the abilities of · each acior on every line. Each actor brought his I her own insight to the work, so that all parts of the play could be equally strong. As Steve said, \Quack. The play is the thing.\ This play is the thing. It's almost · complete. But it will reamin unfinished until the lights go up on Friday night. And then the final element will be added. That is the audience. The final touch that creates a play is the dynamic relationship between the actors and the audience. Unfortunately, the technicians cannot build an audience and the actors can't act one. The Union community is responsible for one_ half of that actor-audience · relationship. 1\. T • .• 1 \omznat1ons Nominations for the Mountebanks Executive Board posttlons are now open. .

National T'heatre Institute The National Theatre Institute in affiliation with the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center, will be performing an original production in the Nott Memorial Theatre on April 26, at 8 pm. The production, which is entitled, \Algonquin Sampler\ is a dramatic presentation of sketches, poems and monologues by Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and James Thurber. The piece was composed around the \Algonquin Roundtable\ in New York's Algonquin Hotel, a renowned haunt of many GET A KICK OUT OF ... American writers and poets. The particular wit of Parker, Benchley and Thurber_ is almost indescribable. On one hand you have Dorothy Parker who will subtly cut down anyone or anything with her ·sarcastic sense of humor. On the other hand, you have James Thurber who paints sad but humorous pictures of the .~n-pecked Walter Middys of the world. And in the middle of them both, Robert Benchley, who, with his aristocratic, condescending outlook towards life, never fails to tell what he thinks of a situation. The humor of these three people has provided this country with a countless number of books, cartoons, short stories, and t.v. series for the past fifty years. \Algonquin Sampler\ is directed by Charles Maryan. Mr. Maryan's credits include directing at the La MaMa, the American Place Theatre, where he directed \Mercy Street\ and the original street theatre, and Strindberg's \Playing with Fire\ at the CounLerpoint Theatre in New York City. 1'he National Theatre Institute is a project of the O'Neili Theatre Center in Waterford, Connecticut. It is partially funded with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The bus company which is performing at Union, is composed of N.T.l.'s twenty-three students. The students • are presently involved in an undergraduate theatre program which is aimed at developing skills in all areas of theatrical production. Among the company is Union student, Jody Stollmach, who has taken an accredited, two term leave of absence to study with NTI. As a theatre major at Union, Jody is in the unique position of learning the varied aspects of theater with the opportunity of practically applying what she has learned in a production tour of the Northeast. It's fitting that her present tour will include Union College. The company will be here for one day only, performing \Algonquin Sampler\ at 8 pm, on April 26, at the Nott Memorial Theatre. An admission of seventy- five cents will be charged at the door. • \ • ~ •. t. - t .. l • ~ ;J ·' ., t..:::;::::::::..;.--:...:;:;;.__....._ __ ,..,...,_..,..;.,.;....J .. ' 'I tt ,_ \\ ...

' ' ' f Page6 EDITORIALS Trustees Investigation By now everyone 1s confused and tired of the Division I - Hockey issue, Proponents of the move into 'Division I are ignoring the allegations of inappropriate actions by the hockey coach, the Admission office and the college president. The foes of the move are engaging in a purge to rid the coll~ge of wllat has been alluded to as UNIONGATE. Facts and rumors have saturated this campus but the issues facing the trustees go farther than Division I Hockey and admission standards. They extend to the question of responsible behavior by the administration. President Bonner submitted his resignation, but the trustees voted it down. It can be speculated that this move was a demand for a ••vote-of-confidence.\ The trustees by not accepting his resignation and tabling any decision on the hockey issue, are setting the $tage for a thorough investigation to take place. Coneordy endorses a thoFough, in-depth investigation of the present governance structure and the president's actions. We do not concur with the president's \dearest hQpe for the college ... to put all of this quickly behind us.\ An investigation is crucial to restore internal confidence in the college. It is our hope that the trustees will release .preliminary statements by the first week of June. After this any decisions will be lost in the exodus for summer vacationing and crucial issues filed until the fall. Concordy supports the tr11stee investigation wholeheartedly. (ommunitations Moratorium If this issue ol Concordiensis appears \watered-down\ in light of the breaking conflicts and controversies on the Union Coll~e campus, it is so. Concordiensis has been contacted by campus trustees and Dr. Lee L. Davenport, chairman of the Special Trustee Committee, and asked to view the present situation \in perspective,\ and honor the communications moratorium, a request to stop all statements regarding campus controversy and conflict. Although Coneordiensis believes strongly in the value of a free press, we also respect the Trustees' discretion on this matter. There are many aspects of the present controversy, (ie. the review of the present governance system and the related powers of the president and various administrative resignations) that Concorditfbsis could comment on; but indeed such editorials and reporting ma,y not be in the best interests of Union at this time. In otiJer Yt~Prds, Concordiensis realizes its responsibilities as a free Journalistic institution, but at the same time it understands tho .spirit 411d seriousness of the Trustee communications moratorium. It is with this understanding, however, that ConeordiensJII;i!nust demand a thorough and complete investigation of the campus controversies -an examination which we feel should focus on the Union College Administration. IEF&Gen.Ed. Concordy has on several occasions vigorously endorsed the Internal Education Fo~ndation proposal. We thought it to be perhaps ·the most innovative proposal introduced here in quite a while. Unfortunately, the IEF has now been tabled for two Senate meetings and does not appear on the agenda for the April 2(ith meeting. The IEF has been submerged in a committee impasse over jurisdiction and implementation. We hope the involved committees, Planning and Priorities and Educational Policy,will quickly resolve their differences and make the IEF a reality. On a brighter note, we .congratulatf?l th~ S~nate for it~<,.nPw nla\ of Liberal Learning. At long_ last, Uruon 1s nd of the C~mp. Ed. curse. We are enthused with the trial Freshman preceptorial plan and hope Union~s most exciting Faculty volunteer to participate in the program. We would also suggest that the .. Disputed Questions\ courses of the Comp. Ed. program become integrated into departmental courses. They were the bright spots in an otherwise gloomy program. Again Concordy extends .its congratulations to the Senate on their responsible action.

Page6 EDITORIALS Trustees Investigation By now everyone 1s confused and tired of the Division I - Hockey issue. Proponents of ~he move int~ Division I are ignoring the allegations of inappropriate actions by the hockey coach, the Admission office and the college president. 'fhe foes of the move are engaging in a purge to rid the college of what has been alluded to as UNIONGATE. Facts and rumors have saturated this campus but the issues facing the trustees go farther tha.JI Division I Hockey and admission standards. They extend to the 'question of responsible behavior by the administration. President Bonner submitted his resignation. but the trustees voted it down. It can be speculated that this m<>ve was a demand for a .. vote-of-confidence.\ The trustees by not accepting his resignation and tabling any decision on the hockey issue, are setting the stage for a thorough investigation to take place. Coneordy endorses a thorough, in-depth investigation of the present governance structure and the president's actions. We do not concur with the president's \dearest hope f()r the C()ltege .... to put all ()f this quickly behind us.\ An investigation is crucial to restore internal confidence in the college. It is our bope that the trustees will release preliminary statements by the first week of June. After this any decisions will be lost in the exodus for summer vacationing and crucial issues filed until the fall. Concordy supports the trustee investigation Wh()leheartedly. (ommuni(ofions Moratorium If this issue ()f Concordiensis appears \watered-down\ in light of the breaking conflicts and C()ntroversies on the Union Colle_ge campus, it is so. Concordiensis has been contacted by campus trustees and Dr. Lee L. Davenport, chairman of the Special Trustee Committee, and asked t() view the present situation \in perspective,\ and honor the communications moratoriuo, a request to stop all statements regarding campus controversy and conflict. Although Concordiensis believes strongly in the value of a free press, we also respect the Trustees' discreti<>n ()n this matter. There are many aspects of the present C()ntroversy, (ie. the review of the present governance system and the related powers of th6 president and vari()US administrative resignations) tllat Concordi$lsis could comment on; but indeed such editorials and reporting ma.y not be in the best interests of U ni()n at this time. In otller V~Prds, Concordiensis realizes its responsibilities as a free Journalistic instituti()n, but at the same time it understands tho . .Spirit 40d seriousness ()f the Trustee communications morat()riuei. It is with this understanding, however, th.at Concordiens,li;i!nust demand a thorough and complete investigation of the eampus controversies - an examinati()n which we feel should f()cus on the Union College Administrati()n. IEF&Gen.Ed. Com:ordy has ()n several occasions vigorously endorsed the Internal Education Foundation proposal. We thought it to be perhaps ·the most innovative proposal introduced here in quite a while. Unfortunately, the IEF has now bee11 tabled for two Senate meetings and does not appear on the agenda for the April 26th meeting. The IEF has been submerged in a committee impasse over jurisdiction and implementation. We hope the involved committees, Planning and Priorities and Educational Policy, will quickly resolve their differences and make the IEF a reality. On a brighter note, we .congratulate 1 the Senate for it~. nPw nJan ()f Liberal Learning. At long_ last, Union is rid of the C<!mp. Ed. curse. We are enthused with the trial Freshman preceptorial plan and hope Union's most exciting Faculty volunteer to participate in the program. We W()Uld also suggest that the \Disputed Questions\ courses of the Comp. Ed. program bec()me integrated into departmental C()Urses. They were the bright spots in an otherWise gloomy pmgram. Again Concordy extends its congratulations to the Senate ()n their responsible acti()n. Accepted Candidates : Welcome to Union College We Hope to See You in the Fall THE.

Perhaps instead you sh()uld ask y0tm1elf what gives you, a mere Executive Vice President of Price Chopper. the right to attempt to dictate . _ Union College policy. Are you a Union College student? Faculty member? Alumni? In your letter you attack the \narrow m.indedness and . vindictive attitude of a few people who wish to be more p()werful than the ad ministrati()n.,. l, too, disapprove of those people who wish to be more powerful than the administration - especially people who have no affiliation wfth the college~ You also wam us that Union has become .. a haven of political espionage and warfare.?'

Nevertheless, l can assure you tltat l haven•t notited any covert activities by the quasi ... historiahs, . or e\ren by the political scienti&U. who, after an. should be wen trained in political espionage and warfa.te, .

To be suret there are many: possible explanations that people can ()ffer for refraining from attending the various sc:hool-sp()nsored activities. Yet, in the middle of the. thit4 week of spring term. few have e\ams and fewer still hesitate to leave their rooms because it ·· is too cold. With all of the strains tbat Union is currently operating under, we can least afford an indifferent student body.

Since the new editors have taken over, Dr. Bonner has failed to hand in his cp/umn. He has not notified us of his desire to diSi:onrinue the column. Perhaps. he does not wish 10 present his views in a public Jo111m. Certainly, the last few weeks have been a trying time for him. We hope he will resume his column and assume the role of an Administrator responsive to informed campus sentiments. We have seen this year more than ever that Union is a very political place, in which students ca~ hav~ an instruJ?ental role_ in college governa11ce. Committee expenence IS worthwhtle, r~wardmg and just a good way to meet people. There are spots ~ vatlable on committees ranging from admissions to Pet and Traffic Court. Two years ago there were only 120 committee applications. Last year, due to an active Committee on Commtttees, over 400 applications were filed. Students from all classes have. been represented on major committees. Coneordy encourages all students to get involved in Union's governance process and apply for committees. anion co~Lp· • .J. concor01ens1s Editor-in-chief .............................. , .................................... danny WoJ~ilo\Ver News·editors .................................................... ,andy mitchell, matt nagor'k) ~:~~:~d!~~~~;: :::::::::.:::::::::::::::::::::::::.::::::::.::.::: · .. ~::: ::::: .. :., :::: .joeb:~p~::i: CtJitlire editor ...................................................................... .fern flomenl1aft Feature editors................. .. .......... minam davtd, andrea cerulman Spons editors .. , ............... , .................................. debb•e poletto, marty dolan Business.managers ............. , ..................................... barbara >ter.n, marla lux Subs<:riptions editors ........................................... ,.; brad kessler· Classifieds editors ......................................... pailt moran, martha rubemtetn Circulation editor............................................. . ..................... matt lul>art Photography. editors .............................................. ; ... steve gnll; JOn f1e~cher Photo stafL ............. · ................ ,...... ed platz, net I kruntck. cary fever.man. marc got lei b.

Be$ides the historical· signif'k:ance o~ South Qpllege, being the oldest male · dqrmitocy ,JI) the ,,, . Unit~d State$j SUch an action would ·limit the two most centrally l&cated and aesth~tically plettsing dormitories to women. In addition 'to this, Ullion men would be deprived of many single rooms. iince the entire east half of South Cqllege m $Wgies1. . Now we Shall take the liberty to list our own coun\r- ptop~. FirSt, if Union had the facilities tit its disposal to attempt the f~hman..hottsing txperim.ent, the~ would or course be. no ptobleitt But givel! the. natUre atld number f:Jf ~existing houSing units, to subdivide fiJomill8 .• categories further (i.e., aU .. ft'eshman male, aU-freshman female;.n~U-. freshman co-ed, all-»ppereld~1 mate. alt-uppercla. female, all~upperelass co-ed) should- be considered out of the question. We, do agree, however, that no freshmen· should have to live anywhere else but centrally on campus. (This means that there would be no freshmen on Lenox Road.) However else should be deJesarea m11r responsibility and their ·.·. effectiveness sbould be guaranteed. The Union Colleg~ bureaucracy, whether desirable or undesirable;. has been established for tbe purposes of effective and orderly administration. The ideal dperation of any bureaucracy. however, is dependent on the cooperation of its various· members within the b~u.\ · cratie framework. We sincerely · hope that, ;.in the future, the Housing Offree will ·be content to·leave·fresbma11Iproblems in the ·\ lianfi of the mote appropriate, pre-designated committees and· witt . lo(.Jk: instead ·to important problems within ·its own ·jurisdiction. (One such problem involves encouraging upperclassmen to· · sfa¥,·on campus by providins. more; ~and more desifabte-t' housing~ thus helping Union· develop the total sense of cnmmunity . in which it is snrely deficient at present.)

Since the new editors have taken over, Dr. Bonner has failed to hand in his column. He has not notified us of his desire to discontinue the column. Perhaps, he does not wish to present his views in a public forum. Certainly, the last few weeks have been a trying time for him. We hope he will resume his column and assume the role of an Administrator responsive to informed campus sentiments. Committees We have seen this year more than ever that Union is a very political place, in which students can have an instrumental role in college governance. Committee experience is worthwhile, r~warding and just a good way to meet people. There are spots ~tvatlable on committees ranging from admissions to Pet and Trafftc Court. Two years ago there were only 120 committee applications. Last year, due to an active Committee on Committees. over 400 applications were filed. Students from all classes have been represented on major committees. Concordy encourages all students to get involved in Union's governance process and apply for committees. union col.. • • concor01ens1s Editor-in-chief ................... _ ............ _ .................................. danny woj ~ilower News editors .................................................... andy mitchell, matt nagor'k} ~:~~::!::~;:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::··::.·:::::::::::··:::::::::::::::·.::::: .. :::j~~b::p~::i: Culture editor ., .................................................................... .fern flo men haft Featur~ editors ............................................ mtriam davtd, andrea certtlman Spons.editors .................................................. debbte poletto·. marty dolan Business managers ................................................... barbara stern, marla lux Subscriptions editors ............................................. , brad kessler· Classifieds editors ......................................... pattt moran, martha rubenstetn Circulation editor .............. ~ ......................................................... matt lubart Photography editors ................................................... steve grill, jon nescher Photo staff.................................................... ed platz, nell kron1ck. cary feverman, marc gotleib, Jeff Jurman Art editor ..................................................................................... le>ter wetss Poetry editor ..................................................................... delanne >tageman Staff this issue.......................... cindy aranow, paul castrataro. alan rutkm, JOn schon, ron •hclll>n. dormitory; Finally, problems e4)mmu.nity may submit having tcLdo with ·class Unity written 'OpudriM OD Ptofe!J80r CONCORDIENSIS is published nery Wednesday by the ~tudPnt and freshman orientation MiiUio to' Prot..

Skellar Reconstru(:tion • Booze ru1se On Thursday evening, June 9th, the graduation weekend committee, headed by Eli Portnoy, will sponsor a three and a half hour extravaganza aboard the steamboat M. V. \Ticonderoga\ on Lake George. The event, billed as ·the senjor class' ·\last college fling,\ has generated a great deal of excitement. As a result, many questiC>ns have been raised, and here are some of' the answers. I) Tickets are available in the Student Activities· Office 2) Each Senior is entitled to two tickets ($10 each); one for ~tmse_l~j h~rself and a .guest. The gue~tu,W.~Y be any Umon student or a non-Union College person. 3) After April 30th, exclusive · sales to seniors will be opened to ·all other Union College persons including facul.ty and administrators. 4) The ticket price includes cocktails onboard, food catered by Maut:ices, unlimited dam;:ing . to the music of \Prime Time\ and of course, one place aboard the boat for an unforgettable evening. 5) Creative semi~formal attire is required on board. A committee spokesperson indicates sales have been 'brisk and advises seniors to purchase their tickets .as soon as possible. A meeting will he called for· all ticket holders during the second week ifi May to discuss the details of the trip. ''CONCEPT '80\ Now Under Construction If there is a demand, transportation to Lake George by bus will be available. Many students indicate .they are planning to rent motel rooms for an overnight stay. Students interested in more information about the trip andj()r accommodations should contact Eli Portnoy at 346-5951 or Mrs. Marra. by DAVE RUBIN In accordance with .. Concept 80\ the comprehen:.ive planning schedule for the Union College Campus, major alterations have begun on the main entrance gate of the college. . The project, now in the first stage of the \Concept 80\ 'plan, will create an entrance court for all those visiting the school. The construction, as the plans illustrate, will serve to enhance the campus look and to develop an efficient use of the campus grounds. The project will consist of building an entry-court which will be located between Memorial Chapel, the Skellar, and the road running in front of J:lale House. A driveway is being built behind South College which will almost encircle Old Gym Hall. The parking area there will be enlarged to accommodate more school visitors. A facade is being constructed over the entrances to both the· security headquarters and the Skellar, for aesthetic appearances. and protection against us during the winter. It is also being added to enhance the planned entry court. The project which is the Library Search • Ill Progress Late ll!,st fall term, an announcement was made by the Librarian Search Committee. This committee is an ad hoc group charged with the duty of seeking out and recommending a highly qualified candidate for the post of ''Librarian\ the highest position in the Schaffer Library. The previous announcement informed the campus of the committee's intention to bring to campus two candidates who were then under consideration. Subsequent developments seriously altered the relations· between the committee and both of these candidates. With renewed vitality and much hard investigative work by the committee's chairman, Josef Schmee of the lAM, there has' been amassed a fresh crop of candidates. One of these highly qualified applicants will be on campus Thursday, April 21. At the times listed below the candidate will be meeting with the faculties of, first Divisions I and 11, and later, of Division Ill and IV: Thursday, April 21, 10:15 the Social Scieence lounge, H:05 room 219 of Steinmetz Hall. Students are strongly encouraged to attend either meeting since this position is one which affects all in quite a direct manner. A written consensus of opinion will be solicited so as to include all feelings about the candidate in the final decision making process. ~., ' Holocost Remembered t· f1'>. ~- \::· by JANET CHAPMAN 1 ,• • The sounds of silence can be t deathening. Thirty-five years ago, .~ . a sinful silence allowed a tragedy l• · which words can not describe, the ~ Holocaust. Six million Jews were t killed throughout Europe while 'r·.hnumerous nations stood by and k!iiwatched. ;i,,,ql Today, many people under- t•,W¥alue the meaning of._ this ~,b:massacre. It is hard to believe that (~ Olsuch a tragedy could happen in . j I \;,,a the twentieth century. Openly ~~. Hrecognized is the fact that ~:J;minorities are constantly treated }: Bas scapegoats, but never have ft,:; !\minorities been persecuted to [r <)'such extremes. Is it possible that a •)' h similar tragedy could reoccur? ' tl Consider the religious persecution • currently existing in Russia. Jews · are still very much discriminated ' against over there. They are forced to remain in this inferior pos1t1on as the Russian government doesn't allow many to emigrate.· Even today many are still unaware of the Holocaust It is imperative that people recognize the mistakes of yesterday and learn the importance of not keeping silent. April is the month when people, worldwide, remember the Holocaust for thirty-five years ago, Jewish ghetto fighters resisted the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Instead of passively giving up their lives to the Germans, these resistance fighters defended their homes. Their determination served as an inspiraiion for other Jews till this very day. , This past Sunday, the Schenectady Jewish Community held a special \Holocaust Remembrance\ Service. John Besson, the principal speaker, spoke about his experiences working in H<>lland's under- ground movement fot the Jews. His whole family worked to help the Jews escape NazLpersecution: they supplied food, German citizenship papers and their home. Mr. Besson's-mother· adopted 'R ,l little Jew1sh boy whose parents had been killed by the Germans. The boy asked for a Jewish educ::ation, so that's what Mrs. Besson provided.- Eventually, Mrs. Besson was imprisoned for her underground activities and John fled North with his brother. John Besson's ending comment was especially thought provoking as he explained how s11rprised he was to find anti-Semitism here in America. Thus it is with such thoughts that we should recognize the importance of remeq1bering the Holocaust and preventing its recurrence by not keeping silent. -•tfi:here IS a 4ifferencetll·fn:ou::lr 1•-. ~t~ , ·,:.

JON SCHORR After dropping its first two games of the season, 7-6 in extra .innings to RPI and 6-3 to Hamilton, a motivated Union baseball team returned to Alexander Field for its home opener,. Monday. A large opening day crowd enjoyed a beaut~ful day and an impressive 8.-7 Umon victory over a highly rated team from Siena. Wins Charlie ··catfish\ Flanagan was on the mound for the Dutchmen . workil;lg only three days a.fter the RPI game in which he went nine innings. Siena jumped on top of this contest with three runs in the second inning. and built another in the fourth. Down 4-0 at the end of four, Union built a run in their half of the fifth. With two outs and Ron Levine on first putting runners at first and second, Coach cahill then had Denis Gazzola sacrifice and advance the runners. Th~ .strategy worked a~ John Terry singled and Gatta cros§ed t}ie plate. Tetry was followed by Chris Massaroni . whose long fly to right was _er.rored accounting for two more runs. Siena managed one run in the seventh and at the end of seven innings of play, it was Union-S, Siena-5. The Dutchmen took advantage of a s~oteless Siena eighth inning and used John Terry's single along with four consecqtive walks ta scare three more big runs. Freshman star Mark Coppes against Watertown. Unbeaten Rugby Takes Two by GL.ENN MEYERS The Union College Rugby Club defeated the previously undefeated ruggers of Watertown last Saturday on Library Field. This makes the club 3~0 on the A- side and 3-0 on the B-side. The A-game saw the Ruggers down 3-0 at half time. Union came out with a fired up team for the second half and the final score was 12-3. Senior Jim Trump touched the ball down on two separate drives to score eight of Union's final points. Sophomore Burt Slavin's goldenfoot made the extra point for one of those scores while last week•s big star, rookie Mc{~k Coppes, made the other set of extra points with his famous \foot that kicks the ball forever,\ (a phrase coined by .his teammates). In the B-game, the lone Union score came about from a heads up. penalty pl~y by Chris Taylot Who took the ball within scoring distance. Glenn Meyers made the final score with an assist from rookie Chet Karwatowski. The Union Ruggers will travel to Siena next weekend and to Kingston the weekend after that.

The state indoor high hurdles champion left the blocks with a: firm tailwind to push him, and by the first hurdle had a step lead.

By itself; this is quite an effort, but further, according to Coach Michelsen, Moffatt eased up in the last fifteen yards. \Bob is using the sprints to gain some speed for his usual races - the quarter and the half,\ said Michelsen, ''and we had some idea he would do well, but we never expected an effort such ·as this.\ In the final event of the day it was Moffatt across the finish line alone for the third time: ap.choring a mile relay team .of Guilfoyle, Parish, and freshman James Gaffney to a win in 3:36.3. {Union's mile relay team of Guilfoyle, freshman Pete Vietkind, Scheuer, and Moffatt, is ranked first in the Division · Ill ratings w.ith a time of 3: 1'9.5). Fine supporting efforts came from fresltman Keith Crimmins and sophomore Cliff Rogers in the high jtlmp. Completing a 1-2~ 3 sweep of the event (with Cozzens), Crimmins cleared a personal best of 6-6, and Rogers leaped 6-2. Sprinters Lee Parish and Ed Dingman teturned from the 220 to place second and fourth, respectively, in the 100. Parish clocked 9. 9, and Dingman 10.0, both \excellent\ efforts according to Micltelsen. . Junior co-captain Bruce Bonano motored up to 13 feet in the pole vault, and was placed second after some questionable officiating. This is Bonano's last season here, and Michelsen expressed hope that his vaulter will be able to enjoy an injury--free season. In the larger meets, Bonano will compete in decathalon competition as well as vault. Fourth in the vault at 12~6 was Union sophomore Eddie Adams, returning after a leave of absence. As with Bonano, Adams boasts a personal best of 13-6, and as the season progresses, these two will form a formidable duo.

You all know quite well that we all tend to complain and give grief about Vnion College's hidng and firing policies, However, Union has definitely taken a gigantic step towards the betterment of Women's Athletics by hiri11g Coach Lynn Barta. Her ability is shown on the field with her amazing knack for developing potential and in her sensitivity and understanding of the emotional side of her players. Coach Barta is just as dynamic as her star studded ladies of . the diamond. It is really too bad that it has taken Union three years to realize tll.is is who they have needed all along. Indoor State Record-holder Matt Blum ,. Saturday, by jumping 18-11 to place third in tbe iong jump. Good first efforts came from Andy Barber; Tom Kistler, and Pete Conway. Sophomore Barber placed for the first time ever in a 1 Union meet by running the 120 high hurdles to third place in 16.3. Sophomore Kistler was fourth in the javelin at 147-3, and freshman Conway was fourth over the 440 intermediate hurdles at 60.2. ln team scoring it was a big opening day win for Union over Albany State, Brockport State, and Queens University. Union's 73 points were 16 better than their nearest competitor, and reflected a well-balanced team ( 17 Union scorers, and only one double winner). Michelsen Accepts Post New Michelsen's pride stemmed from these results. On a very breezy, cold April day his group had responded like the champions they are by putting forth what he called an \outstanding\ early- season effort. Because he enters the hospital for back surgery Tu~sday, his season is going to end just as it has started, and because he has accepted a job at St. Johnsbury Academy in St. Johnsbury, Vermont starting next fall, he expects that this was the last meet of his Union career. This, his 82nd indoor and outdoor win, raised his percentage over 85% - there have been only 6 losses in Michelsen's outdoor coaching. years here, all to established Eastern track powers. This approaching Saturday he will be in the hospital, and his team will be home against Rochester University. Without Michelsen the officials, timers, coaches, and runners will need a good deal,of support and help. If you can time, measure, rake, count, write, clap, cheer, or just want to see some of the best track and field in the northeast, be out at Alexander Field at 1:30 Saturday when the Flying Dutchmen will take on a tough and talented Rochester crew. Anyone interested in helping out is invited to see Coach Bob Magee in the Alumni Gym anytime before then. Trounces Twice Hustler) Reals~ Debbie (Goalie) Schwartz, Liz (Bear) Yeager, and Gwen (U B) Young. The fired up newcomers are Pat Schaffer, Debbie Slotoroff, Judy Driscoll and Gloria Jones (manager). All and all, under Coach Barta, this team has definitely matured with both the old and new players, to a team which has the potential to take it all. In Monday's game the Diamond ladies lived up to Coach Barta's expectation by chalking up a win. Mter the first inning jitters were over and everyone settled down, those Dynamic Ladies of the Diamond swing into that winning rhythm of last year. With strong fired up pitching by \Bear\ (Liz Yeager) and top hitting by ''The Hus_tler\ (Cathy Reals), Judy Driscoll and Pat Schaffer (all 1000 batting averages), the Garnet Girls took the game by a score of 23-12 thus starting off on the good foot to a 1-0 record.

Union then got one from Stu Napear, with assists going to Neil Kanner and John Thompson. Then at 7:24 Neil Kanner fed Stu Napear in front to make it 7-5. Twelve seconds later Ray Stecker went around two Saint defenders and scored up high. The Saints got one back a couple minutes later, but then the Union team and crowd came to life. At 4:56 Rich Easton came across the left side, dropped his stick down low and . scored before St. Lawrence knew what happened. About a minute later he repeated his ''act\ to tie the game amidst cheers from the now boisterous UniQn fans. The Saints then scored on a quick- stick, which would normally deflate a team that had worked so hard to come back as the Union team had. 1 he Garnet showed thei.r courage as a half minute later John Thompson (Little T) leaped high in the air to bat in a rebound. St. Lawrence closed out the period's scoring with a fine individual effort by Batam. They led by one at this point. ihe fourth period opened with a disputed goal, as the hom that lets players in and off the field was inadvert~ntly blown, causing the Union players to let up for that crucial moment which allowed the Saints to score. Union's protests went upon deaf ears, and the Saints now led by two. The Dutchmen continued to hang tough as Don Corchoran fed Little T for a goal. For the next four minutes the game. turned into an exhausting, intense, defensive battle with St. Lawrence fmally scoring at 3:25 to go ahead by two again. Union valiantly tried to come back, as· Ray Stecker made a great Freshman Jim Boomgarden upfield against Siena. individual effort and rolled it by the Saint's goalie to cut the lead to one. Union then pressed for the equalizer but was unable to score, thus losing a heartbreaker 12-11 to a fine St. Lawrence team. The game was a credit to the Union team, as they constantly rallied to come from behind .. and seemed to have the momentum when time ran out on them. Union, mentally and physically exhausted from the grueling St. Lawrence contest, then had to play Division I powerhouse Syracuse (ranked fifteenth nationally) the following afternoon. The Dutchmen were again to be without the services of juniors Jed Kanner and Peter K.annen. Syracuse, being well rested and fleet of foot, jumped out to an early 5-2 lead, which is where it stood at the end of the fint period. The Orangemen proceeded to assert themselves as they scored four more times in the second period. Three of their goals came on quick breaks in which they used their speed and fme passing to convert goals. Union got one back on a nice play by Carl Walker, who o.utfought several Syracuse defenders for the ball and fired it home to make it 9-3 in favor of Syracuse at the half. In the third period Union received two goals from John Thompson, one on a good quick- stick, but Syracuse scored three times to make it 12-5 in their Union Laxwomen Drop Two . favor. The Orangemen opened the fourth period. scoring on a goal by Collins. Union's Ray Stecker got it back at 7:27, which was followed by John Thompson's high scoring shotto make it 13-7 Syracuse. Syracuse got their final goal of the game on a nice play by Storrier, who was a thorn in the Dutchmen's side all afternoon. Union added two more goals, coming from Jim Felix and Mark Sackerson. The final score r.ead 14-9 as Union's comeback ended in vain. The schedule continues to be merciless as Union must face tough Williams and Middlebury contingents this week. by ALL YNE PRICE In their second year as a Varsity team, the UCOLL Women's Lacrosse team has gotten off to a slow start. Coming off last season's disappointing record of 0-7-1, they once again dropped two more games, this year's season openers. In front of a sparse home crowd last Friday, the girls demonstrated their improved stickhandling to the laxwomen from Colgate. Wing Lynn Bateman, a tri-Captain of the team, proved consistent every time as she always managed to carry the ball from the defensive to the offensive zone, allowing Union to own the lead at half- time, by a score of 2-l. Center Barb Kaul, and first home Allyne Price each scored unassisted in that half. The more experienced Colgate team (they had beaten Union 10-0 last year) was able to pull their play together in the second half, scoring three quick goals. However, these three goals scored were but a fraction of the number taken on second-year Goalie Judy Haddad, who did an incredible job of stopping the shots on goal. Coming out of a well-earned restful weekend, the girls traveled to arch-enemy Skidmore on Monday, only to lose to the Skiddies by a score of 7-l. The first half proved brutal as Union managed only one shot on goal, by third home Barbie Berk which only resulted in an illegal check, and the loss of Barbie in the second half due to a slight head injury. With the ball in their Lynn Bateman MVP a!(ainst Skidmore. offensive zone only once in the first half, the girls went in at halftime down 4-0. Then Coach Rick Daly did a bit of defensive reshuffling. Goalie Judy Haddad moved into the point position, and Josie Ritchie went into the goal. Again, there was a lot of trouble getting the ball into the offensive zone, but Josie put aside all but three goals, a small amount when compared to the number taken on her. The shut- out was prevented when late in the second half, second home Audrey !'Jes passed the ball into Allyrte .,Ytice, who was right in front . ·Ol the · cage and able to easily put the ball away. This year's Lacrosse squad is coached by Rich Daly, a former Siena College player, who has also played for several other recreational leagues, along with a semi-pro-team.. The team's captains are Senior Audrey N es, and Juniors Lynn Bateman, and Sharon Cannizzaro. Contrary to the scores of their games, the girls have improved tremendously. Facing a tough schedule for the next three weeks, the next home games are this Friday, the 22nd and next Monday, the 25th. The girls can use all the support they can get, so bring a few beers to Library Field on Friday and Monday, at 4 p.m., and catch some rays while the girls stickhandle their way to their first victories. Ucoll Tennis What do you get when you combine a trimester schedule, a part-time coach, gale weather practices, second hand balls, and six of nine tennisists injured, who spend more time on the trainer's table than on the court? The answer is an optimistic outlook for the rest of the season. Just wait for the fireworks to begin. Wednesday, we will be at the University of Vermont. On Friday, we visit Siena for a morale booster. Our long awaited home opener (we can beat anybody in \our\ wind), is Saturday against Hobart. So keep some faith and give us a cheer (jeer) on Saturday. We're trying hard.

Accepted Candidates Day enabled all those students selected to be admitted to the class of •gJ to come and see the college. Of the 1400 students accepted to Union, 184 candidates attenlled Saturday's activities. Prospective students spent the day ·getting acquainted with the campus, the academic program and student activities. The candidates began their day with registration at the Achilles Rink. There, they rec;:eived the materials needed for the day - name tags, a schedule of events and of course a map. of the campus. After registration; the accepted students were directed toward the Memorial Chapel where the official greetings were issued. The Men~s and Women•s Glee Club offered a musical introduction, followed with speeches by Dir,ector of Admissions, Jay Shupe. President Tllomas Bonner and Dean of Faculty, Paula Brownlee. The visitors were then asked to attend discussions on the .academic programs and policies here at Union. It was explained that the college was separated into four divisions (Division I, Humanities; Division II, Social Sciences; Division HI, Natural Sciences; and Division IV, Engineering and Computer Sciences). There would be individual talks on each division so the students were asked to travel to various parts of the campus (i.e. Social Science building, H-umanities building, Engineering and Science building) .for these discussions. The day also included a luncheon at the Field House with the Union Jazz Ensemble displaying their talents. The afternoon offered topical seminars of which some were titled, \Finding the Extraordinary Within Ourselves,\ \Sex Role Development.\ \The Individual in China Today,\ and. \The Union College Artificial Heart Valve Project.\ The usual financial aid and career counseling discussjons were a favorite among the parents. The day ended with an activities exposition at Achilles Rink where the accepted candidates had the chance to speak to various activity members and ask general questions about • involvement in and accessibility to student activities.

A new section designed to measure analytical skills will be added to the traditional areas that test verbal and quantitative skills. The cbange, the first since the current form of the Aptitude Test was introduced in the 1940's, is based on an extensive research effort initiated by the Graduate Record Examinations Board that showed that analytical skills can be distinguished from verbal and quantitative skills and are rel~ted to academic success. Students, faculty members, and administrators from all over the country were consulted in the various planning stages of the change in the exam. Educational Testing Service (ETS), which administers the exam for the GRE floard, explains that the additional measure will enable students to demonstrate a wider. array of academic talents when they apply for admission to graduate schools. Janis Somerville, GRE program director at ETS, said, '\The new measure will test a student's skills in a number of areas. Students will be able to show their ability to recognize logical relationships, draw conclusions from a complex series of statements, and determine . relationships between independent or interdependent categories of groups.\ She explained that, like the traditional measures of the GRE, the new test will use various kinds of questions. ' ••Three types will be used in the analytical section: analysis of explanations, logical diagrams, and analytical reasoning questions, each designed to test a different aspect of analytical ability,\ she said. Somerville also explained that no formal training in logic or methods of analy.sis is required to do well on the new measure. \Some analytical skills are required and developed in virtually all fields of study,\ she explained. \And like verbal and quantitative skills, analytical skills are developed over a long period of time and are not believed to be improved to any significant degree by intensive study in a b~ief periOd of time.\ Somerville also noted that the 1977-78 GRE Bulletin of Information will describe the new measure and will include sample questions and explanations of the answers. The Bulletin is sen.t free to all students registering for the GRE. In addition, a Sample Aptitude Test containing the same number and types of questions as the actual exam can be ordered at one dollar per copy. Both publications will be available on August I.

Pagel Iowa Senator, Dick Clark CONCORDIENSIS, April 27, 1977 Senator. Clark Speaks U.S. Senator Dick Clark, Democrat from Iowa, spoke on \The Future of American Foreign Policy Under the Carter Administration\ Monday night in Room 016 of the Social Sciences Building at 8 p.m. The fpee lecture was sponsored by the International Relations Club. The lecture itself focused on Carter's stand on human rights, relations with the third world, and n1:1dear proliferation. After the lecture there was a fifty minute question and answer session. Senator Clark made it clear that \our emphasis on human rights is not aimed at any one country, but rather is a way of stating our commitment in this area. Politically and morally we stand at the head of a minority of nations, and it is important to call attention to, to defend and proclaim our ideals. In response to a question directed towards black majority rule in South Africa, Clark called South Africa, \the most oppressive racist regime in the entire world.\ He went on to say that \we must identify with the aspirations of the black majorities in South Africa, Namibia and Rhodesia.\ Clark described reactions to the human rights stand in Latin America as \negative.\ He warned the human rights activists that \a balance must be maintained between our ideals and the realities of other nations; morality must not become moralizing. We must not replace the propensity to police the world with that of becoming the preacher of the world.\ On strategic arms negotiations, Clark described the Soviet rejection of the SALT II proposal as \perhaps their initial reaction to a complex proposal, or an attempt to test the mettle of the new administration.\ He endorsed President Carter's goal to eventually eliminate nuclear weapons. Clark was first elected t0 the Senate in 19 72 after a 1300 mile campaign walk across Iowa that took 99 days. He served in Germany during the Korean War, at which time he made a key decision \to give up athletics (having received 10 high school letters) and embark on an academic career. Professor Clark taught Russian language, some European history, and Policital Science at his alma rna ter, Upper Iowa. In 1962, Clark was involved in Iowa's gubnatorial election and later went on to become Congressman John Culver's campaign manager and top assistant. GRE Changes to Be Made \Closely related to arms control are the problems of nuclear proliferation.\ According to Clark, the United States' opposition to West German sales of nuclear technology to Brazil has upset West Germany and has \contributed to a definite deterioration of relations with Brazil.\ \However the problem here is so grave, with such tremendous implications for all mankind, that these risks would appear to be more than justified.\ When Culver decided not to nm for the Senate in 1972, Iowa Democrats suggested that Clark make the bid. Initially unknown and underfinanced, the underdog fought a superior campaign battle. Clark's organization succeeded in turning out a record number of voters, who m turn gave him 55 percent of the vote. Clark is a member of the Senate foreign Relations Committee, the Senate College seniors planning to take the Graduate Record Exami- nations (GRE) Aptitude lest next fall will see some changes in the exam. A new section designed to measure analytical skills will be added to the traditional areas that test verbal and quantitative skills. The change, the first since the current form of the Aptitude Test was introduced in the 1940's, is based on an extensive research effort initiated by the Graduate Record Examinations Board that showed that analytical skills can be distinguished from verbal and quantitative skills and are related to academic success. Students, faculty members, and administrators from all over the country were consulted in the various planning stages of the change in the exam. Educational Testing Service (ETS), which administers the exam for the GRE Board, explains that the additional measure will enable students to demonstrate a wider array of academic talents when they apply for admission to graduate schools. Jan is Somerville, G R E program director at ETS, said, \The new measure will test a student's skills in a number of areas. Students will be able to show their ability to recognize logical relationships, draw conclusions from a complex series of statements, and determine relationships between independent or interdependent categories of groups.\ She explained that, like the traditional measures of the GRE, the new test will use various kinds of questions. ''Three types will be used in the analytical section: analysis of explanations, logical diagrams, and analytical reasoning questions, each designed to test a different aspect of analytical ability,\ she said. Somerville also explained that no formal training in logic or methods of analysis is required to do well on the new measure. \Some analytical skills are required and developed in virtually all fields of study.\ she explained. \And like verbal and quantitative skills, analytical skills are developed over a long period of time and are not believed to be improved to any significant degree by intensive study in a brief period of time.\ Somerville also noted that the 1977-78 GRE Bulletin of Information will describe the new measure and will include sample questions and explanations of the answers. The Bulletin is sent free to all students registering for the GRE. In addition, a Sample Aptitude Test containing the same number and types of questions as the actual exam can be ordered at one dollar per copy. Both publications will be available on August I. Despite the new addition, the GRE will remain a three-hour test since the verbal and quantitative portions have beea shortened and the time saved allocated to the new measure. ''The same research effort that produced the new measure also yielded shorter versions of the verbal and quantitative sections that are comparable in reliability and usefulness to the earlier and longer sections,\ explained Somerville. The GRE is taken each year by about 300,000 college students as part of the admissions process to graduate school. The exam is offered six times a year, while advanced tests in 20 subjects are offered five times a year throughout the nation. Commenting on the Middle East, Clark defended Carter's statements as the \very strength of the American position in the region.\ He said \as we are the only major power with diplomatic relations with both sides, and with credibility with both sides we can only make use of these twin advantages by continuing to be as even-handed as possible.\ Agriculture Committee, the Democratic Steering Committee, the Rules Committee and the Special Committee on the Aging. He chairs subcommittees on Rural Development and African Affairs. In addition to work in hill committee areas, Clark also ha:, been particularly active in the area of Congressional reform. He has been a key figure in the movement for public financing ol political campaigns, and it is through his efforts that Senate committee chairmanships are now decided by election, rather than by seniority. He also has played major roles in Senate efforts to open committee meetings and modify the filibuster rule. Tax Decisions Approaching by STAN GEBERER The task of reviewing and approving budgets for next year's student activities now awaits. A decision to allocate funds in the spring, rather than the fall, was made earlier this year. In this way, activities will be free to plan their activities early in each new academic year. They will then be able to avoid the delay they have experienced in the past waiting for final budgetary decisions, based on fall term reviews. However, a loss of spending privileges and fines will be levied on those organizations spending Student Tax monies not specifically itemized in their budgets. This does not include monies raised from fund raising activities over and above the projected amount. Fund raising 1 figures will also play an important role in considering budget requests over any range of items or activities. This year's officers, Stan Geberer (Chairman), Alan Rutkin (Ass't. Chairman), Laurie Brecher, Jeff Forman and Peter Shore, plan to begin reviewing budgets with the various activities this week. Without budget requests, no decisions can or will be made. Additional requests and revisions as well as those budgets which have yet to be handed in will be accepted through Friday of this week in the Student Activities Office.

Region III Student Conference. Mike Dougherty ('77) won the competition which took place on Friday April 22 at Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Shanebrook, chairman of the Mechanical Engineering Department, advised Mike an the award winning project entitled \The Design and Testing of a Bileafiet Mitral Valve.\ The major defect of current artificial heart valves is that they do not adequately discourage the formation of blood clots in the left ventricle. Blood clots, a common cause of death for heart patients, occur where there is no cleansing action due to the normal pumping of blood. However, the newly designed bileaflet Mitral valve allows for a minimization of potential blood clot growth by eliminatin.g stagnant regions in the left \ ' ventricle. Within material constraints, the artificial valve is modeled as closely as possible to the natural heart valve. According to Mike, \The reduction in turbulence associated with the streamlined shape diminishes the red blood cell destruction relative to other prosthetic valves. The flow testing of the valve has shown it to be a major improvement over previous designs.·· The two-day competitiOn involved 23 students from the top Mid-Atlantic engineering schools. Union College was represented by Mike Dougherty and Steven Thierry who travelled to the conference under the direction of Professor Aubrey, chairman of the A.S.M.E. In November, Mike will be attending the national A.S.M.E. student conference in Atlanta, Georgia.

Feit will also present two shows on Thursday, May 5 in the Cabaret. The first show will begin at 9 p.m. Finally, Feit will conduct a workshop spanning the weekend of May 6.

A: I think the report is rigbt unfortunately. What happened was that Nixon and Kissinger went to Iran several years ago, and offered the Shah a blank check. It is most unfortunate that we established that kind of policy . . . because now it will be very m ~he Congress passed a law difficult not to offend the Shah if sayt.n~ ~hat the (_Ford) · we go back on Nixon's and admmistratton had s~bmttted a Kissinger's word.

However, we do know that the Katangans moved across the Angolan border during the Angolan Civil War and fought on the side of the Soviet backed MPLA. We know that they had some· training by Cubans at that . time and maybe since. Ther~·s no question as io whether the weapons they carry are Soviet, but so far we haven't seen any big equipment. Byrd Amendment, , how would you defenc:t your action? A: I happened to have been the author df the repeal. We wrote a provision in the bill, that would require a third country in a sense, to file with us, an affidavit to the effect that the chrome did not come from Rhodesia. We now have the technological means to determine whether. the chrome came from Rhodesia. Rhodesian · chrome is unique, it is a. very high quality. In fact, our Rhodesian chrome purchases were down to four percent when we repealed the Byrd Amendment. A: l've felt for some time that since Viet N am there should be a systematic re--analysis with each of our alliances and some of them will pass the test, NATO being the most obvious. I think for some degree.:_ we are doing that. For instance, SEATO in the Far East, is no longer operative. More specifically, we now have a policy for withdrawal of troops from South Korea, , not precipitously but over a perio4 of time. Q: Do you approve of the withdrawal of troops from South ' Korea and the Philippines? wouldn't be all that concerned about it; let them go without the aid. There has been a temporary reaction, but I happen to believe in the human rights issues for a number of reasons. I'm not all totally concerned about the immediate reactions. uMy hope would- be that the United States would recognize Angola. and we could see a closer .relationship between Angola and the western world.,, Q: In the past few years Cuba's ailing economy has been supported by massive Soviet aid. Today, Fidel Castro .said his country's economy has \serious deficiencies.\ How will these recent developmeuts affect the possibility of normalizing relations ' with Cuba and arranging a trade agr~ement? A: I certainly approve of the withdrawal of the troops from South Korea, I voted that way for the first time three years ago. It seems to me that twenty-fi've years after the war (Korean War) we have to think about withdrawal. I do believe President Carter is right saying that it ought to be done very carefully, slowly and in cooperation with our major Far Q: Are you afraid that we are becoming the arms merchant of the world? A: Yes, we sell over half <>f all the arms that are sold in the world. I thi .. g that's a danger. One of the priorities of this administration. fairly ought to be, and is, trying to get a better handle on arms control. Q: During this past session of Congress, you and Senator Biden ''SEA TO, in the Far East, is no longer operative. More specifically, we now have a policy for withdrawal of troops from South Korea.\ Eastern alliances, so that it does not upset the balances over there. The Philippines raises a different question. I don't think we have totally decided yet. Here we do have our major single naval port, Subic Bay, and probably our major single air base, Clark Air Base, but I don\t think we ought· to let the Filipino government hold us up on it. I wouldn't eliminate the possibility that we might move right out of there. I think that they're more crucial kinds of security bases for us than probably any other in the Far East. lfs up to the Congress. Q: President Carter has apparently placed human rights at the top of his foreign policy agenda. How Will this affect our relations with South Korea, the Philippines, Chile, Argentina and Brazil? A: We have to look at each case differently. We know now that several Latin American countries have reacted very adversely. We I. • . ... ~ . ~ . ~ \ . , . ,; . . . - . . ' . .. '\' ~···(,··\-'•'--;:.t; made a motipn to restrict 19 specific arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran. Your motion was soundly defeated by a strange combination of ideological reasons and by votes from all bands on the political spectrum. Why did that happen? A: Well it is complex. It was late in the last administration in September, and they suddenly put together this package of several billion dollars in additional sales, and we just thought it was too much. The committee had @ken a rather strong position prior to that. We were not going to consider any more arms sales unless these sales were sent up to us in a more dFderly fashion so that we could review them, and above all so it would be applied to some overall policy. The committee agreed with us, but it was during the la11t month in an agreement to trade and with some justice they were afraid of offending particularly Saudi . \' reservations about this agreement. I'm very much dp.posed to it. Q: Do you agree with Andrew Young's assessment of Soviet backed Cuban forces in Angola as being a stabilizing force? A: There is no question as to whether we want them to be stabilized or whether we want to give Angola some alternatives. The statement. is certainly accurate. My hope would be that the United States would recognize Angola and we could see a closer relationship between Angola and the western world, which would give the~ some '\alternative' to simply relving on the Cubans (for Q: · In that ca~ you would not approve of President Carter sending any military hardware to Zaire? A: Yes, that's right I wouldn't. First, I think that we have got to establish that this is more than a civil war, we are not about to get involved in a civil war between Zairians. Secondly, frankly, Mobutu is a military dictator. He is a violator of human rights and there is a great question as to how closely he represents the people there. Equally important, his own • forces have shown no inclination to fight. Q:. Mr. Henry Hooper, a A: · I agree with the ~arter Administration in that we should establish diplomatic relations with any country, that is not a basic .human rights question. If we only recognize those countries with whom we are in basic agreement~ we wouldn't have relations with most of the world. Now as for our technology and trade, that, it seems to me, has to be based on other conditions, such as strab;gic interests, what kind of technology we would want to sell them, and our national interests. That's why I would favor recognizing Viet Nam and Red China, because they are there and we need a method of communication. Thank you, Senator Clark. a An The Commit present · \An E-..

An Evening With· Billy Joel The Union College Soc;;ial Committee is very proud to present to the campus community \An Evening With Billy Joel,\ Saturday, May 14, at 8:30p.m. in the Achilles Rink. Billy Joel, popular from his hit gold album, Piano Man, began his recording career in 1968. He had been plucked from the ••Long Island Circuit.. which was then being travelled by the Y o11ng Rascals, Vanilla Fudge, the Rich: Kids, and what later became Leslie Wests' Mountain, to record an album with the Hassles. He'd already been playing with Long Island bar bands for four years, and had 12 yeats of classical piano training under his belt. In 1969, Billy and Jon Small, former Hassles drummer, formed a duo called Atilla and cut another album. Later, in 1971, he left his Hicksville, L.l. home and released his first solo album entitled Cold Spring Harbor which received e~cellent reviews. After a brief period of pmduction problems, he signed with Columbia i'n mid 19.73 and out of that period came pis hit album, Piano Man, with such cuts as the popular song Captain Ja(k. After the s.uccess of Piano Man, Billy was named Best New Male Vocalist of 1974 by Cash Box and became a tour headliner, playing name halls. Later that year he Wrote and recorded his next album, Str~etlife Serenade. His latest album, Turnstiles, has been greeted with excellent ·reviews. Billy Joel's band is comprised of many talented artists. According to many Union College students who have seen Billy Joel i:n previous performances, his concerts are a unique musical experience not to be missed. The concert is Saturday, May 14 at 8:30 p.m. at the Achilles Rink. Tickets are on sale in the Student Activities office in Carnegie Hall. Tickets are $4.00 with a Union LD. in advance and $5.00 with a Union I.D. at the door. For information and tickets, stop by soon at the Student Activities office. Unions First Dinner Theatre As a joint effort by the Mountebanks, the Cabaret and the Pub, plans are underway for Union's first dinner-theatre. Bruce Cohen is directing a 17 member cast in the George ~ernard Shaw play, \Androcles and the Liont which was inspired by the ancient fable of the lion and the mouse. Set in second century Rome, the plot revolves around ,the ~hristiali Androcles who is saved from a death in the lion pit when one of the lions recognizes him as the person who took .a thorn out of his paw earlier.

Show time is at 8:30p.m. From the Nudes's Mouth by JOHN KNUDSEN Although the Brahms First Symphony has been recorded many times, it is only once in a great while that a truly outstanding performance appears on disc. This performance, by Whilhelm Furtwangler and the Berlin Philharmonic, warrants such praise. Recorded on February 10, 1952, in the Berlin Titania Palast, the Furtwattgler First captures the austerity, drama, ·and simple grandeur of Brahms. The introdu.ction to the symphony sets the tone of the first movement. · The ptdsating beat of the timpani combined with the rising strings generates an atmosphere of darkness, gloom, and somber resignation. As the introduction fades, the opening allegro is furiously launched by the entire orchestra. Furtwangler sustains the tension throughout, until the conflict is gently resolved at the end of the movement in the key of C major. Colored by the woodwinds and the violin solo at the end, the second movement flows beautifully - a testimony to the magnificent playing ability of the Berlin strings. The scherzo, by pontrast, is a fast and vibrant interlude between storms. The Berliners play it well, although as a movement I have yet to figure out how exactly it fits into the rest of the piece. The supreme moment of this interpretation occurs in the adagio introduction to the last movement, when the ominous sound of jagged themes and pizzacato episodes is broken by a single ray of sunlight from the horn section. As the clouds part, Films Thi·s Week On May 3 at 7:00, 9:00 and II :00, the Film Committee will the strings break into the glorious principai theme of the movement - a theme which so many have compared to the last movem~nt of Beethoven's Ninth. The storm then rages on to the final coda, culminating in a magnificent wind chorale. Like an invincible \rock of faith,\ this chorale bursts forth in total triumph ~ bringing the work to a glorious conclusion. . The dramatic impact is st·riking. Furtwangler's occasional lack of precision is made up for by his inexhaustible energy as a conductor. He reveals - above ·au else - aspects of Brahms which have seldom been heard , before. Finally, the sound quality of this recording is relatively good for its time.. All in all, it is definitely Worth adding to your repertoire - and if you don't have a repertoire yet, it's a good one for starters.

A year is almost gone, and with that departs my inexperienced ideals and impressions of this institution. I now see Union as a college filled with divergent goals, interc:sts, and values. l've witnessed the views of the college senate ignored . by the president; the -decision of a ~tnpus co.mmittee, comprised. of students and facu:lty,'·altered by an administrator. Indeed, I've seen active participation by students ignored; the! ·criticisms telling how We .can better Union bemused or forgotten. In three short terms I've witnessed a college in turmoiL ·I've seen power stf\lggles and political conflicts operating on a huge scale. I've viewed an institution founded on intellectual growth stifling communications and astuteness. - · -.. A-gain, I quote the 1980 Freshtnall Record: \ ... You wilt find an administrative staff professionally dedicated to insuring your growth and development both inside and outside of the classroom. You will find a college which is vibrant and exciting. You will find a college working with faculty, students and administrators collectively to provide contiimi11g leadership for higher edilcation and to provide for you some of the most c_hallenging and rewarding educational experiences obtainable.'' William F. Enteman Provost Indeed, I have realized many of these goals at Union. M.ore importantly, however, I have not found such a colk:ctively moFal im~titution, dedicated to intellectual growth. It is ti$e for this (:ollege's administration to stop professing platitudes. Indeed, it is well time for the Trustees of this College to review Union's goals and its present position. :Platitudes aside, I came to this institution filled with fresh .ideals and open eyes. Within two and a half .tetms, bowev.er, these qualities l').ave quickly eroded. I now see Union as an institution biased by an unethical hockey coach, reinstated to a high position without a full investigation; 11 college with inappropriate admissions; and a center of higher education rep~esented by a president who does not represent the yiew~ of the students or faculty. . . I do not make these indictments in hatred of Union.

- CONCORD!ENSIS, Apri/27, 1977 Page'? • d O,pinion: ..... There are real problems. We lack a deep sense of institutional identity and pride; we tend to be unusually self--critical; we lack the centers of human contact; we identify more closely with narrow disciplines than with the College; we do not always communicate well; and we have our share of dissatisfactions with tenure, college priorities, and the student role in college life. \You see this College through fresh eyes. Use them to help us move this Cotlege ahead. Tell others what you like about Union; tell us how we can be better. The future is yours. Be an active participant in what happens about you. This will be your College for as long as you live ~ help make it the kind of place you want it to be ... \ Thomas N. Bonner President From --Freshman Record\ 1980 A freshman entering the college of my choice, indeed I saw Union with fresh eyes. I viewed a small liberal arts institution of high academic quality; I saw a student body united in its convictions to preserve this College's eminent reputation; I witnessed a faculty dedicated to its role as educational advisors and instructors; indeed, I saw a college institution. founded on student-faculty-administration cooperation, all working together for the future good of Union. Fresh is synonomous with naive. A year is almost gone, and with that departs my inexperienced ideals and impressions of this institution. I now see Union as a college filled with divergent goals, interests, and values. I've witnessed the views of the college senate ignored by the president; the decision of a campus committee, comprised of students and faculty, altered by an administrator. Indeed, I've seen active participation by students ignored; the criticisms telling how we can better Union bemused or forgotten. In three short terms I've witnessed a college in turmoil. I've seen power struggles and political conflicts operating on a huge scale. I've viewed an institution founded on intellectual growth stifling communications and astuteness. Again, I quote the 1980 Freshman Record: \ ... You will find an administrative staff professionally dedicated to insuring your growth and development both inside and outside of the classroom. You will fiRd a college which is vibrant and exciting. You will find a college working with faculty, students and administrators collectively to provide continuing leadership for higher education and to provide for you some of the most challenging and rewarding educational experiences obtainable.\ William F. Enteman Provost Indeed, I have realized many of these goals at Union. More importantly, however, I have not found such a collectively moral institution, dedicated to intellectual growth. It is time for this College's administration to stop professing platitudes. Indeed, it is well time for the Trustees of this College to review Union's goals and its present position. Platitudes aside, I came to this institution filled with fresh ideals and open eyes. Within two and a half terms, however, these qualities have quickly eroded. I now see Union as an institution biased by an unethical hockey coach, reinstated to a high position without a full investigation; a college with inappropriate admissions; and a center of higher education represented by a president who does not represent the views of the students or faculty. I do not make these indictments in hatred of Union. Nor should this appear as an attack on the hockey team, many players of which I hold in personal friendship and high regard. Instead, these are the very individuals most hurt by the present situation at Union. This commentary should serve as a warning flag to the campus, its students, faculty, administrators, and trustees. Union is in the midst of contrmersy -- a conflict that must be resolved before many campus parties are irreparably hurt. 1 propose that a change in the President's Office is the only alternative left to guard against costly scars. by ANDREW J.

Williams' speed and smart pas~ing around the Union cage kept. the Dutchmen baffled and behind all day. The fircst period saw Williams scQte four goals-,. three of which were feeds from behind or just to the left of the cage. The few times Union's offense got the ball, they showed little ·movement and failed to score in the period. . . who scored on a hard shot from the left side. Williams, however, got two more back and the game ended Williams 12-Union 4. The Union team, coupling a di&appoin ting loss to St. Lawrence f!ild Syracuse the week before with injuries to Pete Karnen, Hank Flemming, and Jed Kanner, did not play up to their capabilities. , ' . Then on a rainy Saturday The second period opened with Williams.scoring three times; their sixth goal was scored by Thomsen on a behind the back shot. Passing was crisp and it seemed to shred the Union defense. Union's highlight of the day occurred when defenseman Ken Beck carried the ball all the way downfield, switched hands, and put <it iri an upper corner. This gave the Union fans something to cheer about. The first half ended with Williams holding a sizable 8- 1 lead. afternoon the Dutchmen traveled to Vermont where ,they lost to a fine Middlebury team by a score of 18-13. The game was .played in a constant rain, which made the field extremely slow. it was an exhausting game. Rain soaked jerseys, constant pounding, slipping and sliding, combined with the defeat, left tbe Union team worn and dejected by the day's end. Sharp UColl passing is .not enough a long shot and the other on a play in which he out.,.fought the goalie for the ball and. scored. Union tried to come back in the second half of the contest by scoring six goals to Middlebury's five. but the final scoreboard read Middlebury 18-Union 13. It is hard to say what has happened lo this Union squad that began the season with the highest of hopes and the brightest of outlooks only to be torn apart by four big defeats in two weeks. The schedule has been unkind to them, playing four tough teams in such a short time. t~ey have been hit by injuries as defenseman Pete Karmer and attackmen Hank Fleming and Jed Kanner have been forced to sit out a number of games. All these reasons, however valid, cannot explain Union's defeats. If they are to finish the season .successfully the laxmen must pull themselves together and use all their talents. · Williams scored twice in the middle of the third period, once on an excellent feed from behind and another op. a quick spin shot. With one second left in the period Jed Kanner (playing de~pite a painful injury) took the ball, switched hands, went arounc;l the defensemen and put it home, to make it 10-2, Williams, at the end of the tb.ird period. The Union offense, perked up by the Kanner goal ending the previous period, opened the fourth period scoring at ll:35 by Junior Andy Brooks, The game began well for Union as they jumped to an early four to two lead on goals by John Thompson, Rich Romer (2) and Ray Stecker. Middlebury then tied the game on ~ shot from the left side a:nd a play in which their attackman simply beat two Union defenders and scored. Union showed their best power play of the season as Rich Easton ended up converting to make it 5-4, Union. The first period ended · ~ith two Middlebury goals, making it 6-5, Middlebury.

For these talented players, the 1976-1977 season was an especially outstanding one, highlighted by two victories over the Chi-Psi A- team, which was undefeated for four years. They achieved their title of A-team Champions by defeating the New Yorkers, Harkenriders, and Chi-Psi A- team in the playoffs. On Friday, April 22, the victors travelled to Albany State for the first round of extramural competition.

CONCORDJENSJS,. Apri(2J, 1?77 ' . 6porte UColl Laxwomen Do It by ALLYNE PRICE For the first time in their two year history, the Union College Women's Lacrosse team won a- game. Their first victory came this past Monday against SUNY Oneonta, in front of a home crowd by the score of 8--5. However, this win came after two previous losses, one last Wednesday against Castleton State in Vermont, and one this .past Friday at horne against Russell Sage. Wednesday's game against Castleton could only be described as barbaric, as the country girls mauled, beat, and illegally checked their way to a 9-0 victory over our Laxwomen. Never before have the Union women had so many free positions, free shots, and penalties called to their advantage, as the bruisers from Castleton almost annihilated half the Union team. The only Castleton player with any poise, and knowledge of the game, was the goalie, who did an excellent job of stopping several Union shots on goal. The team fared better on Friday against RusseJI Sage, but better was not quite good enough. The final score was Russell Sage 7~ Union .5, with goals by Lynn Bateman, and a pair .of goals each by Audrey Nes and Allyne .Price. And then came Monday and the win. The Union Jirls were so psyched for tlils game, they were ready to start even before the four o'clock face·off time, and even before the Coach got to the field. Union scored immediately into seventh goal, with AUyne Price, who like Nes, completed the hat ... tric;;k, with Union's eighth g~al. Oneonta finally scored again, but · not until the half was almost over, and Union the clear victor. S() after 2 years of hard work, Union had finally put together a. winning. Womari's Lacrosse team.

Oneonta shot again, Union returned the shot, this time first home Allyne Price sent the ball into the nets. And it happened again.

\PERSPECTIVE April 2.7, 1977 THE EDITOR'S NO;&ES My fellow colleagQes, I wish to speak about grim realities that have developed within the past decade tbat have reached critical dimen8i'()ns today, and will undoubtedly alter our forin of living for tomorrow. · Such realities consist of the constant threat Qf nuclear war, the shortage of energy, and the subsequent disillusionment with and distrust of our formal governmental institutions and the elitists who control them. There also exists a growing mistrust in private industry and the immoralistic way they do business. lt is no secret that even before the 1977 SALT tals (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) between the United States and the Soviet Union, both countries have been engaged in an ominous stockpile of nuclear arms. With the failure to reach an arms limitation in the SALT H talks, it is inevitable that stockpiling and the development. of new nuclear weapons will continue under the political calamity of detente. F_or all of you bargainhunters, I have fallout .shelters cheap - if you act right now. Recently, President Carter cited a CIA repprt, that warned that the world wide demand for oil ~'is likely\ to outstrip supply in the next 5-10 years. A very chilling prospect for those of you who happen to like hot baths. But a more serious consideration must be given to the \have nots,.. not only in this country, but the countries of the world - who also cherish the blood of the earth, When the diplomatic ~lls for sacrifice begin, it is \US PLAIN FOLK\ who must pay the biggest chunk of our worth - though we seldom enjoy the simple luxuries of life. What mysterious force other than discrimination prohibits tbe . pursuit of life, liberty and prosperity? Inflation. The exorbitant costs of education, homes, food, hospitalization, and · other items, have drastically disadvantaged the common layman in the marketplace. Present government figures indicate that a family of four . needs on the average, $10,041, just to live on a subsistance level. Will we be able to afford our future, if there is one? Citizen participation in governm~::nt is . crucial to the democratic process. However, . events- such as Watergate ;u1d the Capitol Hill sex scandals unveil the graft and deceit displayed by our public officials, on the one hand disillusions the average citizen in the democratic process and on the other, lessens . his respect for the public official. The formation of a code of ethics for congressmen at best will have dubious effects. However, the legislator~· will undoubte<(ly insure thaf legal ambiguities and flexible lo 0 pholes · ~re provided in the ethics legislation. f . I <> \ t ( ~ \\ I , .. The con.s~nt pursuit of profits by private industry ~rves as an ·mcentive mechanism to persuaoe firms to embark on new production proj~ts. The weak firms who use ,inefficient techniques or produce an ·inappropriate amount or type of product are penalized by losses, Therefore, business firms are motivated by the abstraction ·of a profit from the market ,place. Consequently, industry has become i-mpersonal and immoralistic in its attempt to satisfy the public with high quality and low cost goods and services. A case in point, is the dehumanized and synthetic process of growing chickens. The evolution of mass production in the agri-business can be termed a success, in purely economic terms. During the last two decades, the U.S. poultry industry has become the most efficient producer of animal protein in the entire history of agriculture. But what price has the consumer paid in realizing such benefits of the mass production process? In short. the consumer is eating a synthesized bird that bears only a superficial resemblance to the barnyard chtcken. Technology today has altered the behavior and vecy nature of the chicken. Agri-business geneticists today can produce a 10-pound hen that is garlic flavored, and lays an egg with a green yolk. As you ~n see, there are grim realities that must be dealt with . by the future caretakers • of the world - us. A comprehensive and collective effort must be made by those of us on different sides of the fence, and by those who have recently changed their position. The responsibility to ourselves, becomes a minor consideration, . when the relative existence and security Qf our generations are at . stake. Therefore, in your attempts to become a \well rounded student,\ assess the role you will play in the maintenance of the social order, and the development of rtew vistas of progress - with the \human factor, in mind~ .

The Social Committee went on to inform the B.S.A. that its annual concert depended on making a profit on the Billy Joel concert. Noticing the absurdity and unfairness of these actions, Mrs. Marra intervened and offered a compromise to the problem. The B.S.A. will have a concert in Memorial.

Brothers and sisters are you with me in the struggl~'l You ShoUld be for we are all Black and struggling to move ahead in this institution l:llld more importantly in our lives. Whether we want to be or not is not the question for in one ·way or ~JI~other this struggle affects us alL . And whether we act as individualists or a people joined to8ether 'we all reflect on eac::h . other in some way. Think about it. We cannot struggle amongst ourselves and hope to accomplish anything for in ~ny ways. we are defeating ..:..our real purpose here which is to educate not separate. Despite our differences we must lei!m to help each other, for we will not find. too many h~ping hands from the others who do not have to struggle as we do. It is hard, this I understand, but it is not so bard that it cannot be done. Brothers and sisters life itself is very hard to deal with, your ac::ademic encounters they too are difficult, still you make an attempt and you try to deal with it. . Why not try just as hard to deal with each other? We have to learn to accept each other, for in the course of educating ourselves and trying to make progress we will have to deal with one another in . some . way itt order to .make it · ·through the s~ruggle'. · · Aware, yes we are that some of us are from different places and different backgrounds. No flaws in that fact, for there is one facto~ that we cannot get away froQ)and that is that we are all of a color; a very beautiful· color at that. Take Pride in your Blackness and take pride in yourselves. Take pride in the brothers and sis~ers around you who are trymg. Though they are n~t always succ::essfw in their endeavors they are trying nonetheless. Help them if you can. For in learning to help others, you learn to help yourself. We All come from somewhere and ·we are here because we hope to go even further in our- lives. Being ·~black it has not been easy . Nevertheless we have made and are still in the process of making the attempt. We are on our way and we have come up struggling, all of us! . . Remember this if you forget all else that I have said, and that is that we a:re all black and we are all struggling to make it thtough. .

It is not where are you from?, but where are you going? And it is not what you know now but what you will learn in the process of struggling. Brothers and sisters are you with me in the struggle? You should be for we are all Black and struggling to move ahead in this institution and more importantly in our lives. Whether we want to be or not is not the question for in one way or another this struggle affects us all. And whether we act as individualists or a people joined together we all reflect on each other in some way. Think about it. We cannot struggle amongst ourselves and hope to accomplish anything for in many ways we are defeating our real purpose here which is to educate not separate. Despite our differences we must learn to help each other, for we will not find too many helping hands from the others who do not have to struggle as we do. It is hard, this I understand, but it is not so hard that it cannot be done. Brothers and sisters life itself is very hard to deal with, your academic encounters they too are difficult, still you make an attempt and you try to deal with it. Why not try just as hard to deal with each other? We have to learn to accept each other, for in the course of educating ourselves and trying to make progress we will have to deal with one another in some way in order to make it through the struggle. Aware, yes we are t:hat some of us are from different places and different backgrounds. No flaws in that fact, for there is one factor that we cannot get away froin and that is that we are all of a color, a very beautiful color at that. Take Pride in yoar Blackness and take pride in yourselves. Take pride in the brothers and sisters around you who are trying. Though they are not always successful in their endeavors they are trying nonetheless. Help them if you can. For in learning t<1 help others, you learn to help yourself. We All come from somewhere and we are here because we hope to go even further in our lives. Being 'black it has not been easy. Nevertheless we have made and are still in the process of making the attempt. We are on our way and we have come up struggling, all of us! Remember this if y()U forget all else that I have said, and that is that we are all black and we are all struggling to make it through. Many of us are trying to do it alone, but let us try and see if we can make it together- I HOPE FOR TOGETHERNESS signed: A brotlter Up from the Struggle BILLY WHO?

Blaek Student To fight for African redemption does not mean that we must give up our domestic fights for political justice and industrial rights. It does not mean that we must become disloyal to any government or to any country wherein we were born. Each and every race outside of its domestic ?ational loyalty has a loyalty to 1tself; therefore, it is foolish for the Negro to talk about not being interested in his own racial political, social and industrial destiny. We can be as loyal American citizens or British subjects as the Irishman or the Jew, and yet fight for the redemption of Africa, a complete emancipation of the race. Fighting for the establishment of Palestine does not make the American Jew disloyal; fighting for the independence of Ireland does not make the Irish-American a bad citizen. Why should fighting for the freedom of Africa make the Afro-American disloyal or a bad citizen? Ms. Riperton has obviously been working hard sin .. ·c her last album which we thoroughly enjoyed.
