The appointment of' Dr. Willard F. Enteman as Provost of Union College was announced at last Monday's general faculty meeting by President Harold , C. Martin. The appointment is effective immediately and elevates Dr, Enteman from the position of At:ting Provost, a job he had held since last August. The office of Provost is the second highest in the College Administration. The President will now focus his attention on long- range planning and work with the Board of Trustees and the Department of External Affairs. The Provost will have responsibility for all other areas of administration,. including the academic program. · Friday, March 2, 1973 20 cents Faculty Meeting: Enteman ProjectS Balanced Budget; Martin Urges Positive Thinking by GEORGE BAI N Provost Willard F. Enteman ·.presented a projected hudget for 1973-74 at last Monday's general faculty meeting that wipes out the, deficit of $213,000 incurred by the College in 1971-72. Enteman, whose appointment as Provost was unanimously approved by the Executive Committee last week, detailed the projected budget for some 90 faculty members in attendance. Estimated income for 1973-74 is $10,649,320, and the proposed expenditures total $10,388,109. The budget is broken into three categories -- A, B, and C, for personnel, nondurable, and capital budgets and the projected distribution is as follows: For personnel wages and salaries, $4,964,331 is allocated, including a 6 percent across-the- board pay increase totalling $265,802. The \A\ budget for the current year, 1972-73, is $4,708,529. For nondurable funds, covering everything from chalk to undergraduate student aid, $5,094,398 will be appropriated. For 1972-73, $4,314,989 was apportioned. exclusive of $685.409 for student aid. An increase of $94,000 in student aid brings the next \B\ budget to just over $5 million. The \C\ budget will stand at $329,380. featuring a $22,000 increase in the present library hook budget of $88,400. The total projected expenditure for 1973-74 is. again, $10,388, I 09. Projected income for that year is $ W,649,320, based on a $300 tuition raise and the same number of students - there will be no increase in the student body. The $2nL211 surplus balances the College's budget over the three- year period of 1971-72, 1972-73, and 1973-74, as mandated by the Board of Trustees. The budget for the current year should . break even. Enteman stated that the surplus would not, however, offset ar10ther pl'anneiil. 6 percent pay increase for the year 1974-75. With the \B\ and \C\ budgets also rising, he implied that chances for no increase in tuition for 1974-75 were slight. He also predicted that .. erosions\ within the budget were inevitable and said that student aid would have to he the first victim of such erosions. A tuition increase would then be an inevitable result. Another possible target for budgetary cutbacks would be the library book budget. Enteman stressed that the financial pie here is a limited one. The rest of the \A\, \B\, and \C\ budgets cannot be touched, but the cutbacks have to come somewhere. The President announced the '\ a p p r o v a I o f E n t e m a n' s · appointment as Provost a move which he said \pleases me, and I'm sure it pleases you,\ the resignation of Vice-President for External Affairs Howard Thompson, and the new jobs for Dean of Students Edward .1. Malloy and Director of Placement Henry J. Swanker. In new appointments, Prof. Frederick A. Klemm becomes Director of the Term Abroad program, Prof. Raymond Eisenstadt becomes Director of the Technical Institute, and Prof. Joseph Board becomeb the first person to hold the newly created Robert P. Patterson Chair of Government, named for a former College Trustee and Secretary of War under Harry Truman. President Martin will shmtly appoint an ad hoc committee to take a \thorough look\ at what Union is doing and plans to do academically during the next decade. The committee, whose report will be due on .January I, 1974, will deal with Comprehensive Education, transdisciplinary studies, and graduate and undergraduate programs. The President will also ask the Liaison and Governance Committee to study the strengths and weaknesses of the new governance system, now in its second full year of operation. · Regarding campus housing, Dr. l. his ! right l j and I pier in I! place. of the i 1 DL Enteman is the first appointee as Provost since Dr. Theodore Lockwood resigned the post-in 1968 to become President of Ti\inity College. The new Provost is a 36-year-old native of Caldwell, N.J. and a 1959 graduate of Williams College. He holds a Master's Degree in Business Administration from Harvard University and a Master's Degree and Docotorate in Philosophy from Boston University. A Full \Moonchildren\ This projected budget for 1973- 74 is subject to approval by the Board of Trustees. Enteman also announced that department chairmen will soon be asked to begin to plan ahead for the 1974- 75 budget. A two-year projection is also an important consideration. Martin announced plans to move faculty members out of dormitory apartments and open up that extra living space as student apartments. The former County Library building, being vacated by VITA and the Capital District Library Council, will be converted into a new dormitory. The College has also purchased apartment houses on Union Ave, and Park Ave. and will convert them into student housing after all of the present tenants have left. even , · bout ; · by DANIEL J.

Rebellion does two things: first, 1t slows the process of reducing people into types. Rebellion through paradox, which the students practice, has them going hack on even what they th~mselves stand for. This is why MIke and Cootie can on the one hand go out a:od march for peace, can .make a \commitment while they on. ~he other hand behave in a way that makes two monkeys stuffed ·with Ex-Lax seem to be the paragon of self-control and responsibility._ · The second consequence that rchellion has is that it really rrcvents the characters in the play. lrom truly getting to know each other in any kind of meaningful way.

It is a life built on a facade of freedom and a base of innuendo. They belong to a generation of ''haves'' - they need not worry about money, about making ends meet (Dear Dad, send bread), so they have all the more time to worry, to get hung up, to try to relate and yet miss the mark. !t is the tragedv of • i the play that by the end of the fina.l act the characters, after sharing an apartment for the entire year, cannot even say good- bye to each other; they don't know how.

He characterized as ''a bad atmosphere\ the \habit\ on the part of faculty and students of \discounting derogating, and distrusting\ the College. 'Til be quite blunt,\ said Dr. Martin, in what some faculty members later called a rare display of emotion, \the College must rid itself of this feeling, for Union is better than it is given credit for being.\ Martin continued that \it is time for us wmmunally to take a different look at ourselves.\ He is proud of Union's \strong faculty a-nd good student body\ and stron&IY Continued on Page 3 Students who are genuinely interested in laking a Block of Education Courses (inc:luding student teaching) which would le~d to certification for elementary school teaching in New York State are requested to leave their names in Dean Wylen•s Office, Social Sciences ,, , Building, Room Ill.

One gets a sense, however, that it is the -..v()rld that has failed youth, and net the other way around. Life has thrown them a row of non~sequiturs, a circus of n e u rot i c neighbors, fag professors, and irrelevant grad students. They have run away from this by trying to retreat in~;ardly, but they find nothing there. Weller is dearly enough on the side of the students. How can they be expected to straighten out a world that is so theroughly messed up'! The comedy in Moonchildren. as funny as it is, is really a Iaughti':!_g-to-keep-from- cryiog. What the Moonchildren, which refers te their incredible naivete, try to do with each other is to create diversions, (which are themselves non-sequiturs, but more suited ,to their world), that can draw the.a.ttention away from the world that has gone to hell. from a life that .sucks. By choice, Weller keeps everything in the room, where the students interact with each other their involvement with the outside world is only mentioned, and never seen, · Curiously enough, I think a post-college age audience will be more captivated by the play than by people of student age. Students can identify with what is going on. with how student life outside the classroom is conducted, almost too much. and for that reason cannot have the p~rspective of someone past 30. who makes up for hot \being able to identify by understanding better. This phenomenon of itlentificat ion vs. understanding in the theater, made clear by Sartre, shows up in the effect produced by some of the \free\ language used in the play. Words like \fuck\ and re-ferences like ••that little cunt there,\ will not even make a student blink, while, I dare say, an over-30 might take special notice and make something out of it. Getting to tl-Je production itself, Mountebanks ·can be proud of itself. The a<:ting. with minor exceptions (for example the plumber and the milkman) is sterling. It is impossible to single out any performance as the best. out four which I found to be particularly mjoyable were Hank Barsanti as Dick, Tom Parisi as Cc'otie, Helena Binder as Shelly, and Art furock as Willis. The tightness of direction was evident in the way the 16-member cast worked together. The seven scenes could have easily thrown timing and rhythm to hell, but. except for minor choppines~. the transitions were handled smoothly. What mistakes there were can be overlooked. The performance I attended was the dress rehearsal, where technkal problems are to be expected. Also, I assume the few stuttered Hnes will be taken care of before the actual opening. The comedic aspects of the play are well done. The lines arc delivered on edge and on time. One of the best scenes in the play. if not the best, is when the two policemen come to the apartment with a complaint. Jerry Coleman's cop (shades of John Wayne in his inflections\) fits like a golf glove. and Skip Singer\ \rookie\ must be seen to be believed. Singer shoyvs his versatil.ity later on when he plays Bob's uncle eyually well. No apologies are to be made for this performance of \Moonchildren.\ The story is peanut-butter. but with the chunks. As Bob is told: \Life is full of shit.\ \A h. screw\ we should all answer.

The Athletic Director himself was in sweats helping move the bleachers and disrupt the meet His presence can only be taken ~s condoning the action, I think this was the most deplorable treatment of a visiting college team I have ever witnessed in five years at Union College. I feel qualified to say this since, in addition to being an avid sports fan, I have played ten terms of sports and announced two winters of Varsity 8asketball at Union. Certainly no team, especially one that has not yet begun .their season should be allowed on the floor for any reason during a meet with another c(!llege. Spectators aren't even allowed on the floor at some of our meets. But to have the Athletic Director himself out there helping them is most deplorable. I think this showed poor judgment. Obviously no team has the right to interfere with another tearn's intercollegiate competitio.n. The track team has always been kicked out of the Field House at 5 P.M. for a 6 o'clock basketball game to allow the dust to settle. Why not show the same courtesy for the track team? Knock off at 4 for a 4:30 meet and lose two hours of work at the most. No one is allowed to shoot baskets du\ring a ·wrestling meet are they? Is the track team any dHferent'? Such hypocricy is intolerable! Since the insult is done,. l can suggest only that such an incident with another college never occur again. Also I feel that as Athletic Director, Mr. Allison owes the Mohawk Valley Track Coach a letter of apology for interfering with the meet and not showing more respect for the time he and his team took to come here and compete. Such an incident ·shows -disrespect for all intercollegiate competition and is obviously not in keeping with Union College policy.

CONCORDIENSJS, Friday, Man·h 2, 1973 The Roles of Research by ANDY PEARCE Last Wednesday, approx- i~a t e I y 30 people jammed the l:lale House Lounge to attend the third meeting of the 1erm in the \Professor as . a Scholar\ series, The intent of the lecture- discussion. series is to e~plore .through the experiences of Union faculty members ·the relation between the professor's role as teacher and as a researcher. Wednesday's professors· were Howard' Berthold (Psychology) and Robert Wells (History}. The · first to speak was Professor Bertho!d .. He explained his method of ap.proaching outside research. Students have given Mr. Berthold many ideas for outside studies, and for these interested students, the projects did not end at this point. They are allowed to perform much of the work, freeing Professor Berthold from much of the tedium involved. Of all t-he studies mentioned , which included a project by Robert Sax dealing with the education of mentally retarded children with the aid of a computer, Professor Berthold expressed his greatest interest in that which deals with depth perc~ption. This study, wbich has employed much. of Mr. Berthold's free time, deals with the stereo phenomenon of the eyes and the cinocular disparity cue of it. After finishing the technical recitation .of his lecture, Professor Bethold expressed his opinions about the entire area of outside research by professors. He feels that I'JOt so much of his time should 'be spent. on his research with his eighteen researching students. He spends at least two ho1,1rs a day on research. \Every hour I spend with these eighteen students,. is another hour I can't spend on figuring out a new format or lecture- for my classes. This really worries me ... \ Professor Wells took the floor after Professor Berthold finished his talk. He started off by stating, \My research is something I get vitally interested in.\ Professor Wells' research is in the field of demographic studies. He has correlated rnany statistics about e.ighteetlth century Quaker families into a viable thesis, To g~t his information, Professor Wells has 'pored over old records and texts for many hundreds of hours. Much of this information wa·s n<>t ~eadily available, and travels to London and \~xotic T·tenton, New .Jersey\ were. in order, The research done by Professor Well~ is not coilfined merely to the subject .of history .. He employs all aspects of the social sciences: Psychology, Political Science and Economics. \I am trying to study human behavior in a very broad sense .. •• 'Mr. Wells; forte is American colonial history, but he does not confine himself to an American viewpoint, as many history teachers do. \1 force myself out of the .American. viewpoint.\ Thus, in dealing with the: colonial period, between 1.607 and 1776. Mr. Wells explores not simply the thirteen colonies which were to become the United States, but all British possessions at the time. This lias had a beneficial effect on Professor Wells: \It has changed my perspective.\ In dealing with his research as it related to his teaching, Professor Wells feels that it has helped him. become a . better instructor. Unlike Professor Berthold, Professor Wells' research has not interferred with his classes but, rather, has helped. In fact, much of his research has been the basis for a new co~rse iqtr~duced to the Union College curnculum. \In terms. of what this has meant to my teaching, it has actually created a course: History 119, People in America. This is one course which has been generated out of my research.\ After Professor Wells finished his lecture, a heated question and answer period began. It did not concern research in any way but was stimulating nonetheless. P.rofessors Berthold and Ludwig discussed the propensity to giving A's to students. Professor Ludwig felt that if a.JI his sludents were deserving of a high mark that they would receive it. Professor Berthold on the other hand expressed the . sentiment that all A's given to a class would be ludicrous. He would not give .an entire class all A's. At this point Professor Berthold said to Mr. Ludwig, ••1 don't see why you shQuld put up with a B student.\ This heated discussion went on for close to thirty minutes, with Mr. Wells adding that if people leave his course and they have learq,ed how to think, then it has been a success. \I try to help people think better and write better.\ Beer and soft drinks were also part of the evening's entertainment. -Blumstein Talk o,n Criminal Justice The ln~titute of Ad~inistration and Management at Union College. Will host a spec1al lecture by Prof. Alfred Blumstein of Car~eg•e-J\1ellon University on the topic \'Design of Criminal Just1ce ~nd Other,. Social Systems.\ The lecture will be held on campus m Room 115 in the Social Sciences Building at 3:00 p.M. on Thursday, March 8, 1973. The public is invited. Alfred Blumstein is a Professor and the Director of the Urban System~ Instit-trte in .the School of IJrbarl and Public Affairs of Carnegie-Mellon University.

Page_4 Friday, March 2, 1973 Garnet Spikers Look To Cortland Invitational by WILLIAM MARKS The Union College trackmen are heading into the homestretch of their season over the next three weekends with one of their most successful seasons ever already compiled . .Just walk into Coach Ken Michelsen's office and you'll notice not only a big smile but two trophies representative of two of the biggest wins in Union track history. Although this year's dual mark of 6-2 does not match last season's undefeated mark notched in Michelsen's first year, Union has far surpassed its previous showings. in big meets, and the two early losses were inflicted by teams Michelsen feels could easily be thwarted now. -Union's claim to fame indoors came in garnering first place over thirty two other teams in the prestigious University of Rochester Relays, and then sweeping back to grab winning laurels two weeks later in last weekend's U. of R. Invitational. Union grabbed the first win by Y2 point over a Rochester squad which had won the honor nine of the previous twelve times and was extremely confident of the win. This win proved the Garnet were three deep with quality in many events, and although bringing only 16 competitors, many who doubled, placed in eight of the nine events it entered. The lnvy win was perhaps more impressive. Union's middle distance crew from the 440 to the 1000 showed its.elf to be far superior to any other team in NYS by capturtng 32 of Union's winning total of 47 points, . singlehandedly, inclu!iling firsts in the open 440 (Dave White), 660 (Tim McCabe), 880 (Mark Mindel), a second in the I 00 (Greg Hamlin) and a first and second in the mile and two mile relays. The win came by a mere one point over a Cortlan€1 squad which poses a threat to win the NYS meet March 17 at St. Lawrence; and by 8'\12 points. over revenge-minded Rochester. Union travels to Cortland Saturday for the Cortland Invitational, but hopes for another win seem slim without triple-threa ter McCabe who will be competing in the IC4A's in Princeton in the open 880. March 10, the following Saturday, is Union's own invitational with some big name schools Union has not yet faced including powerful Springfield. A win there will be nice but right now Coach Michelsen has his eyes set on St. Lawrence's new Tartan track and the state meet. Although only a small Union squad will be vying for state honors Michefsen feels his horses can win and place in the 600 and 100(), win, .both relays (including Steve .Jones, Crawford Cutts Fred Pressley), win or place in th~ shot (Bill Mowery, Bob Cable) pole vault (Dave Ricks, Bob Baribeau) and ,high jump (Stan Jackson, .John DeStefano), and win or place in the springs (Milt Herring) . Going into the season Union was not expected to place h:igher than fourth in the states but after defeating the likes .of Cortland, Rochester, Syracuse, Edinboro; and Lehigh, Union can expect to give favorite Colgate (who has not yet faced Union and will see a McCabeless squad Saturday) and contenders Cortland and Rochester more than a run for their money.

As a consultant in Chinese curriculum development for New Y ark State schools, Chen has been the subject of sharp criticism by conservative groups on both the state and national levels. He delivered an afternoon presentation te Professor Thurston's classes on the significance of the continuing Great Prolet-arian Cultural Revolution in China. His evening address in. Old .Chapel was entitled \Chinese Foreign Policy: the View from Pekin~.\ . Chen has been denounced as an ''apologist and propagan<Jist\ by a group of conservative state legislators and members .of the right-wing \Young Americans for Freedom,\ Senator Ectwyn Mason, New York State Senator from Hobart, has accused the State Education Dep.artment of permitting Mr. Chen \to poison the minds of the people of our state ... we should remove Mr. Chen, but eve~:~ better we should remove Mr. Nyquist.'-' Ewald B. Nyquist, the Education Commissioner of the State of Ne~w YoFk, defended Mr. Chen and himself by explaining that Chen is employed 'by the state as a research specialist in the development of curriculum materia~. \but he is in nO' way developmg a master curriculum for teaching about China in all schools.\ Nyquist believes that education in New York State is best served by permitting aU points -of view to be freely expressed. On the national level, New York State Senator James L. Buckley has stated that any Chinese s.tudy program developed by Chen would constitute \subtle propaganda in support of the Peking regime, one of the most brutal and tyrranical of our or any other time.\ Although Jack Chen is neither a _ member of the Chinese Communist Party nor a citizen of the People's Republic of China, it is his background as a publicist for the Chinese Communist cause that makes him at once so controversial and, in the eyes of the E<!ucation Department, so ~aluable as a resource person. He ts perhaps the only Western- educated intellectual to have seen so much of modern China and to he available to the West to talk ahout it. Mr. Chen, who ·most recently worked in Peking as one of the highest paid editors of the prestigious Peking Review, came to the United States to work for the State Edu<;afion Department ..

His father, a Chinese native, was a leader i.n the unsuccessful \Autumn Harvest Uprising\ staged at Changsha by the peasants in September of that year. Jack Chen became a journalist in 1934 and interviewed Mao Tse-tung in 1938 at Yenan, where Mao took refuge with the battered men who survived the epic 6000•mile Long March. At Mao's personal request, Chen went to England in 1939 where he set up an office in London to distribute information about the Communist revol~tion abroad. \l Was .theit m.iblic relations man,\ said Chen. After servihg in-the British ·army during World War It.· he returned to China once the Communists had. won the .. mainland in f949. Employed b.y the State (presently China\ sole employer) at the Foreign Language Press in Peking, he remained. on the mainland for 22 years. · · At the Foreign language Press, the largest publishing house of its kind in th~ world, Chen worked on a variety of foreign-language public_ations put out by the Peking government. In 1966, while working as an editor for the Peking Review, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution erupted. As an \urba·n intellectual,\ Chen \Yas sent down to a rural commune for one year to \learn from the masses - to grasp revolution and promote production for the people.\ Although the Cultural Revolution was completed in a formal sense by ' the Ninth !='ongr~ss of the Communist Party m Apnl 1969, Chen says that \the struggle, criticism; and transformation\ that it embodied still go on in China today. Chen, who is currently writing a book on the subject, argues that the Cultural Revolution must be viewed in its historical context as .. an mevitable step in the general progress of the Chinese revolution ~ not as a sudden brainstorm in Mao's head,'' as the Western 'press led us to believe. He explained that the Chinese Communist P.arty has consolidated the socialist base in production by replacing private capitalist enterprise in China with state and collective enterprise. Although they had succeeded in this respect, the \mental situation\ had not ·improved sufficiently; people were ''still thinkirtg feudal,\ thus threatening the progress of social-ist construction. Hence the need for an ongoin.g revolu.tion to \reaffirm the original revolutionary ideas and solve the problems of compl::tcency.\ Chen characterized the Cultural Revolution as \a do-it-yourself revolution ... and that means everybody, · includinE the rank- and-file ... The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was a great debate in every sphere. Through a thorough testing and sifting of leaders,\ it provided for a complete restructuring of the political system to ensure democracy for the masses. It was instrumental in instilling a sense of revolutionary fervor in the •.! • 1 .... whO'Ie generation of young people horn after 1949 who were ignorant of the concept of class struggle and the hardships of \the old days.\ l'n contrasti·ng the old feudal society with the new rev:olutionary one, Chen says that the welfare of the masses \has improved out of all recognition.\ Before 1949 only 10% of the population was literate. Today the literacy rate is 50%, with mostly old people remam1ng illiterate. Today there are 100 milli?n children in primary schools. In housing, \big advances, but so much (is) still to .be done.

Sheehan, the writer of the lead story in the New York Times that released the Pentagon Papers, noted that the importanfe of the 7;000 pages of the Pent~gon Pap'ers l'ies in its defail of the documents of policy-meetings, memorandums, and basic source documents, yielding a complex ~tudy. of actual decision-making m Umted States foreign policy. More Glimpses of_ ''Moon children\ The conclusions that the Pentagon Papers formulated constituted the basic focus 'of Sheehan's talk. It is his opinion that the executive branch of the government must be brought under control, for it is \a centralized state in the European sense of the word.\ The executive branch has assumed so much control. Sheehan maintained, that the constitutional checks and balances no longer exist. Essentially, to read a·nd understand the Pentagon Papers \is to step with Alice into the looking glass\ and see the quagmire. executive branch l.eaders stumbled into by themselves, without consulting Congress or the public. by DR. CARL NIEMEYER Michael Weller's~ \Moonchildren a comedy about college life presented last week by the Mountebanks at Nott Memorial Theatre, opened on . 'Broadway a little more than a year ago; after a successful tryout in Washington, D.C. It got excellent reviews a.nd closed after a two-week run, thus demonstrating that the New York drama critics may have the power to kill without the power to quicken. After seeing the Union College production, one can understand both the critical acclaim and the commercial failure. The play is about seven Qr eight college students of both sexes, who are sharing an apartment - not an odd couple, but an odd octet. The time is 1965 (mistakenly updated by the Mountebanks to 1968 - a very different year), and the students' hang~ups are personal and political. No one, however, takes politics very seriously, except humorless Norman, well played by .John Bridger, who takes them much too seriously, after he has once discovered that they exist. No one here is hooked on drugs. for in general Weller avoided melodrama and .. strong\ situations. The mood of the play is out of Chekhov, not Atrabal. Weller has emphasized his students' tolerance, their casual selfishness, their aimlessness and their bemusement. But mo~t of all, he has made them come through as Qecent and attractive. Anyone who has known college students, in the mass,. at first • l:. ~ ' hand, will recognize Weller's characters at once. With so much going for the play, why the failure at the box- office? My own theory is that the audience on which Broadway successes depend just couldn't take the language. Weller has made an initial assumption (well~ justified by observed fact) that college s~udents use four-letter words as a matter of course in normal conversation. I suspect that most of their elders, though they may admit the truth of the assumption, don't care to be re;uinded of it. Just so, all of us in the 1940's war knew you couldn~t ·(in those days) transcribe soldier speech and put it unedited on the stage or into a book. People knew G.I.'s talked that way, but they didn't want their more heroic image of them disturbed. The stage and the public prints are more flexible nowadays, but their audiences may not have advanced along with them. In fact, I'm sure they haven't. I can well imagine th~ _Scarsdale mother firmly reJectmg the idea that her daughter at, say, Wellesley cannot only u nd ersta nd without embarrassment, but speak with equal coolness the language of a WW II sergeant. Probably the ideal cast and the ideal audience for \Moonchildren\ were to be found in the Mountebanks' production. Here were students playing students for an audience of studerltti. Everyone was in the same field of reference. The result was ~_:.performance both funny Continued 'On Paie. 3 What one observes, as Mr. Sheehan does, is a strange set of values upheld by the executive branch. Secrecy is the necessary obsession for its survival. The controlled release of information is an example of how the executive branch achieves its valued secrecy. Sheehan cited the Gulf of Tonkin incident as a prime example of his point. From a study of the Pentagon Papers, we know now that the President had been c~ntinuing a clandestine war against North Vietnam via Pl·boat raids, trained teams of saboteurs, and kidnapings of North Vietnamese fishing crews. The attack on our destroyers apparently was provoked by our previous activities. but by making these operations secret, the Administration created for itself a blank check. for the Senators who passed the resolution were as ignorant as the average citizen of the actual facts. Through secrecy and deception the President was able to circumvent . the United States Constitution. Another cherished value of the executive branch is loyalty.

Pagel · CONCORDIENSIS, Tuesday, March {i, 1973 Letters To the Editor: Fortunately, I have found only one student ·who completely misunderstood all my remarks at the \Professor as a Scholar\ series last Wednesday. Unfortunately, the confused student was the writer for Concordiensis. I would appreciate the opportunity to state some of the things I actuaUy said. ·Psychologists usually utilize student aid in some portion of their research. Frequently the students have very limited knowledge of the purpose or implications of the experiment. I could do my research in this manner - I would get more dene if I did - but I do not believe that this would be helpful to Union College students. Instead, I try to involve students in every phase of my research to the fullest ex·~nt of their ability and interest. To my knowledge, no student has ever performed research with me who hasn't understood the experiment very well, and who hasn't made strong positive contributions of his own. True, some of the students even work on ideas that they originated themselves, although I have never had a student who could have satisfactorily done the entire experiment by . himself. To insinuate that students should not have the opportunity to originate and work on their own ideas, or that this somehow involves them in tedious work that they would otherwise avoid, or that I would have to do tedious work on their ideas if they didn't, is perverse. I do not spend \at least two hours a day on research.\ What I said was that during the past year I spent what would average out to be two hours a day doing research. Much of. my research was during the summer in 8-12 hour blocks. mastery of the concepts one wanted to teach in a given course, and that this is as true in a philosophy course as it is in a psychology course. Several colleges and many more departments within colleges and universities have adopted this sytem of education. Given this, one need not accept second (B). or third (C) rate performance from any stUdent who would like mastery (A) of the course. The p r o b 1 em w i t h su c h a n instructional system is that while it satisfies professors' functions as teaehers, it is seen by some as failing to satisfy our function as evaluators for graduate schools and recruiters. Many colleges and departments are willing to sacrifice the evaluation function for the teaching function. Union is not. 1 think it should, and I think other more rational means for handling the evaluation function could be devised. I have been criticized for this view, and .I am willing to accept such criticism for my value judgments. I am also willing to utilize educational techniques which correspond with the predominant views of the Union College faculty and administration, even though they conflict with my own ideas. I would hope, however, that criticism could be directed toward my actual ideas, and not toward the sort of distortions which were attributed to me in the Concordiensis article. Sincerely, Howard C. Berthold * * * * To the Editor: I am really disgusted· over the lack of concern that so many people recently have shown for the campus. Anyone that has taken a walk around the grounds has seen large ditches and ugly car tracks caused by uncaring drivers, large amounts of trash just tossed away, and beaten down paths where there used to be grass made right next to available sidewalks. If people continue to act this way, all that will be left pretty soon will be a rotten looking mass of mud with a Coke bottle on top. Angrily yours, Larry Swartz '73 * * * * To the Editor: Mitchell Weisburgh and others may be surprised to discover that there are two normal, healthy female human beings sharing a single room with two normal, healthy female canines - and even more surprising is the fac! that all of us are well-trained, considerate, and of above normal intelligence. We have serious doubts about the validity ·of his article \Campus Dogs Harbor Disease\ and the research upon which the article is based. There is not \an abundance of dog feces wherever one looks\ ~ we manage to make it to and from classes without dirtying ourselves. The diseases ~his abundance of \fecal matter\ harbors - now -seriously, how many members of the Union College community are \small children between one and three years of age who have a history of soil ingest.ion?\ According to Weisburgh's article \Mike Husman collected 16 fecal samples.\ From the rest of the data offered, it appears that each sample represents oAe dog. Percentages are then exactingly stated, and the reader discovers that 37.5% (!) of the do.gs on campus are carriers of some dreaded disease. Either faulty research techniques or reporting methods weaken this statement of fact ~ isn't it probable, or at least possible, that more than. one of those \fecal samples\ was deposited by the same dQg? Perhaps one sick dog was responsible for aU of the six contaminated samples- yes, that is stretching it, we did read the whole article and realize .it .isn't the case. Nonetheless, it is possible that only three dogs were contaminated ~ one left four samples, and two others each left one. Three human deaths have been attributed to these parasites - three deaths in recorded history, for the total world population! It would appear that it is infinitely more dangerous to ingest Saga food and risk ptomaine poisoning than \kiss a canine.\ Those of us who are considerate do not appreciate the verbal attacks upon canines and owners in general. Yes, those who are poorly-trained, ill-mannered and generally obnoxious should be reprimanded or banned from campus --; the rest of us wouldn't terribly mind being at one or another end of a leash, as long as we're together. A bitch's best friend, and all that ... Name Withheld on Request * * * * To the Editor: Thank you for youJ: insightful article on the state of disaster we face with those savage threats to human dignity: dogs. We all sincerely intend to stop eating dog feces immediately. You have opened our eyes. But really, doesn't the Nott Memorial lc..:>k like a fire hydrant? Mark Silva Steven J. Shapiro Nina Sichel Ruth Swacker Victoria Sook Jeffrey Scott Miller Chris Ketcham Michael R. Hauch Bill Durks Paul C. Sullivan * * * * 'In making the point made by most other participants in the series about doing research which was not easily· incorporated into classroom lectures, I noted that I felt it was a valid question whether one should spend the amount of time I spend or any amount of time doing research when the time could be spent improving classroom techniques. I would hope that all professors and students would have a similar concern, and I noted that this seemed to me to be a core question in the entire series. To conclude from this that I feel-that less of my time should be spent in research is absurd. If I felt less of my time should be spent in research, less of my time would be spent in research. To b~ open to discussion and concern on the way one Sl'ends his time does not imply that one is necessarily dissatisfied with the way he actually sp~nds his time. The final remarks attributed to me are particularly unfortunate since they suggest educational concepts which I feel hurt students. I did not say that giving an entire class all A's would be ludicrous. In fact I am one of the few professors who ever gave almost an entire class of 60 students grades of A. I did say that we now have the psychological and educational technology to insure that every Union student could gain A-level Orientation Counselors Applications are now available in the Office of the Dean of Students for those interested in participating in next year's Orientation Program as ORIENTATION COUN- SELORS.

Editor Candidates' Remarks by DON KRONE 'It is the purpose of this Iett~r to officially annouce my ca~clidacy for Editor-in-Chief of Concordi¢nsi~ and to explam my qualifications and general philosophy of a college newspaper. Although I have only written one story for Con~ordy three years of working experience .at a local newspaper should allow .me, to assimilate the necessary teclinical skills for overseeing puhh~at~!)n twice a week. - The E:dit()r, in h-is Fet?ruaty 13th editorial, wrote; \lt is ~-simple fact that more stl:ldent participation would make this a better newspaper,\ however, I contend that .participation :il?ne is not a sufficient .cond-ition to assure a viable andi dynamtc nespaper. Editorial responsibility is a crucial ingredient iq d~sseminating campus news. Investigative reporting of the operations of the governance system, the Admissions Office, the Office o~ J?xternal Affairs, Student Aid, t'he Registrar's Office, a:nd the admmi!ltratms can be carried out in a reliable manner if objectivity is the main criteria .. of Concordy's framework. Members of the campus .commun.jty ca.n draw reasenable conclusions. only with an objective presentatil)n, . . . But. Concordiensis must do mote than keep us mformed, It should be a fmum for presentation of all points. of view concerni~g a wide specfrum of interests. Assuming the objective. ~\f a .~o!!e~e education is to expose students to as many opposm~· views as possible, then Concordy bas represented a lar~el~ . waste<! opportunity. It is pract-ically impossible for. any one m~lVIdual to explore these differing aspects of life on hiS own but It co~l'd be made feasible provided that other member(lT of the commuruty are willing; to share their perceptions. perhaps as much education is taking place in the dorm (\bull session\) as is in the classroom. In analogy, Concordy should be a refined bull session dealing withvirtually a~ythi.ng stu~ent~ ~ee_m relevant and important to them. More humor(a~tiCles, P:Ictu:es:·~nd .drawings) should be instituted to prevent a total emerswn mto th.\'! empirical and serious facts of existence. . · Concordy cannot be in fact a newspaper hut only a focal pomt of moods, philosophies, ideas, gripes, and obj~cti~e reporting .. T.his can only be accomplished with open commumcation and a WI!Imgn~ss to be receptive to constructive and. sincere criticism. . by AL REISCH I will not e11gage in \your s~andard campa~gn rhetoric\ ... there is no· need. Perhaps this is what bothers me about the present operation of Concordiensis more than anY: othe:r sin~le factor .. : we refuse to take ourselves seriously. What IS needed 1s real senous tl10ught about where the newspaper is going and how it will get there, not campaign rhetoric. We have an obligation, I believe, to the students here (and to the faculty and the administration if one is to bring this argument to its logical conclusion) to present the news fairly and as thoroughly as we can, given limited resources and limited time. We have an obligation to take stands on issues that concern the stud~nt bod~ of Union College. We must take this role seriously, for tf we v~ew ourselves in a farcical light, what right have we to expect anythmg more from the people we are supposedly in existence to inform? indeed, the masthead states that we are published by the \student body of Union College.\ This is a fact that we cannot aff~ to lose sight of if we are to provide any worthwhile service ... As it stands now Concordiensis is nof a newspaper; tt IS at best a dry pseudo-magazi~e that informs only occaio~ally and an~ly~es in the wrong places at the wrong times. I would hke to t~rn this mto a newspaper ... it really isn't so hard to do. News stofles should_ ~e news stories; the fact that a column is signed does not mean that tt IS the proper place for editorializing. All editorial comment should. be strictly limited to the editorial columns of the paper. To do anyt.lung else is to allow the quality of the news presented to be undermt~ed. Analysis is a part of any good newspaper, and Concordy certamly should present t:his, but oniy as analysis that is marked as such, not in the news columns. Our editorials should be related to the news that we are reporting, for if we are editorializing on a topic, it !}lUSt be assumed that we have researched it, and I can see no reason that __ this research should not be presented in the form of news stories. We should hide nothing and be certain that our editorials are based on a careful analysis of the existing conditions, an analysis that We have carried out and that we can fall back on if necessary. We owe. t-his both to ourselves and to our readers. . · Finally ·though, working on Concordiensis should not. be a. cho~~; it should be both exciting and enjoyable. In short, there IS no rea~OI;J. that working on Concordy should not be fun. This do~s not imply frivolity, nor does it imply ease ... it means just what I~ says. The transmission .of truth is no mean task, and it ~eq~!_fes ~ real commitment on the part of aU C()ncerned. Yet this commitment should not be contingent upon drudgery. A good newspaper staff can turn out a paper twice a week that is truthful, stylistically correct, interesting. and ·informative while still having fun in the process. . .. What is really needed is less rhetoric and more commitment to truth by a group of people who aredetermi!:ed to prbd~ce .. t~e-!2fs! newspaper possible irt the most honest fash1on ... and wtll t'nJOY t,he whole process. r·-~· ~--.·~ •·•iiir-\\'jl -·--------. - Dave's.

Sheehan on Govt. COmin.ed_ from Page l loyalty no longer means loyalty to the Constitution but to the President and the executive organizational structure. The executi¥e branch exists now to serve itself; the values it expresses as values for America are the values necessary for its continuation. The growth of the unified military-civilian personality is another unique development of the executive branch. The political-military scholars fl'om the top schools of this country move on to powerful positions in the bureaucracy. These men, the likes of Henry Kissinger and Walt Rostow, derive their loyalty to the President and the executive bureaucracy from the dependence of their positions on the executive branch. This all combines to form a coherent picture of an authoritarian government existing within the framework of a democratic government, espousing an \American\ · philosophy and value structure that are essentially the ingredients necessary for its survival The growth of this unified force must be checked and the former system of checks and balances must be restored. Sheehan believes that much of the initiative lies with Congress. They must be willing to accept the responsibility for their decisions and they should also begin tQ_ decide what information Congress receives and makes public. Another prerequisite for establishing balance among the three branches of government is the establishment of Congress as a major foreign policy-maker. The President 9an no longer be allowed to create foreign policy as he sees fit; officials and bureaucrats of the executive branch must be -compelled to tell the truth so that Congress has the essential information to formulate rational foreign policy. The nature of exactly what is going on in the government today. as illuminated by the Pentagon Papers, makes positive action on the part of Congress and the public of top priority. We have now a state that believes that it is within the power of the President to make the laws he sees fit. and to limit the First Amendment according to his wishes. The vast bureaucracy has created a political philosophy to justify .itself. Authorities deceive us \for our own good,\ which is really their good. The power of the executive branch is getting out of hand; in pursuit of the re- establishment of the . governing framework as dictated by the Constitu,tion, the near- stranglehold which the President and his loyal bureaucrats have upon the American government need be broken with no hesitation.

The Unio11'' CoUege basketb~l'II team, denled the opp'ohuility to. compete in post-season play· last year,. yesterday received an invitation to play in the cE'CAC Ups~ate regional tournament, one of four regional ECAC tournaments.

The preliminary games (the other being No. l seed Albany State against No.4 seed St. Lawrence} will be played Friday, w1.th t·he fi.nals to be held Saturday. The games will be played at Albany State.

McCabe Cops 4th:.::.:. ln.IC4-A 880 by MARK MINDEL When the Dutchmen travelled to Cortland on Saturday there was justifiable cause for some doubt to be hanging over their heads as to whether they could see. this one through to a win as they had twice before this season at U. of R. Dependable co- captain Tim McCabe was pounding the Princeton University track trying to qualify for the 880 finals in the IC4A's, sprinter Milt Herring was recovering from a spike W()Und, and two shot putters and a pole vaulter were unable to make the trip. Each man went QUt to give his all and cover the ·gaps left by the missing regulars. Finally, when the end of the meet drew near and the Garnet thinclads found that they · were within winning distam:e, all doubt vanished and once again '\the keys were turned and the buttons were pushed, and they W!!nt.\ The· om!· and, two mile relays were scheduled back to back to make if virtually ii:Tipossible for any one man to double in both events. Not phased by the strange scheduling, ·1he Dutchmen went into each race and fought to score enough· points to c:!dge Oswego and clinch the most satisfying win of the _,1973 indoor track season by one point. Jake the Snake Now 'In Boston Gutty-' Tim :McCabe, union's · McCabe and Alan Carr-Locke of premier middle distance runner; Boston and the N-aval Academy's matched his sho.rter stride with Dale Bateman. The first quarter those of the best of the East and time of 59.5 (Mc:Cabe went finished fourth in the finals of the through in 60) was far too slow IC4A 880 yard run, with a time of for any decent time to h€: 1:56.2. McCape placed behind recorded and actually turned the Ken Schappert of Villanova, race into a 440 Yard spring. The 1:54.5, Manhatten~s .John Lovett, longer-legged Lovett, Schappert, 1:54.7, and Eugene Weiss, of and Weiss pulled away at the M I half-way point but McCabe ontc air State, I :55.1. 1 f Lovett had won the event for gamey went a ter them after Sophomore Dave Ricks ran lead off leg in the mile ·relay; turning in a 0:5.1.5 quarter mile split which spurred on running mates Freddie Pressley.· Greg Hamlin and David White. 'White's 0:5 LO split iced a 3:30.7 winning time, the fastest of the season. Crawford Cutts, Scott Kalina. Steve Jones and Mark Mindel joined forces to shut out C<>rtland from gaining points and beating Oswego's time in the two mile relay. A third place would clinch · the win for the Dutchmen: As the teams crossed the finish' line Union was third b·ehind Rochester and Colgate but twenty yards ahead of Cortland with a time of 8: 11.2, safely beating Oswego's time from the previous heat. Half mile splits for the four: 2:02, 2:03, 2:00 and 2:06 respectively, Kalina's split being a personal best. Along with five meet records which were shattered, Union set two marks of its own. F<>r the first time in ten years Ce>rtland was defeated in its home invitational and Union College has become the first team to ever wm the Rochester ~elays, Rochester Invitational and the Cortland Invitational all in one season. Two outstanding performances were turned in by Mark Mindel by BUFFALO Playing in his first game as a Boston Bruin, Jacques \Jake the Snake\ Plante embarassed t:he Western djvJ.sion leading ·Chicago Black ffawks on.national TV by a score of 4-0. Plante came to the Bruins from Toronto in exchange for the two of the most travelled players in professional sports: \a number one draft choice\ and \a player to be named later.~· neither of whom had played an important part in the Bruin's organization. In other trade action, the Bruins also sent forwatd Garnet .. Ace\ Bailey to Detroit for ex- Bruin defensemen Gary Doak. Bailey got off on the right skate in Detroit as he scored a goal a:nd received an assist in his first game as .a Red Wing. These two trades came as a surprise to this reporter, who is virtually cut off from the real world by Union·s infamous fence. This, combined with the area television stations' virtual neglect of professional sports, makes it difficult to keep on top of the sports world. Plante's shutout was his second this season and the 81 st of his career, which spans 20 years. He first played with the Montreal Canadians. Since then, he has played with New York, St. Louis, Toronto and now, Boston. He won the Vezina Trophy five times ( 195 5-56 to 1959-60) with Montreal and shared it with all· time great Glenn Hall in 1968-69, LUIGI'S RESTAURANT SPECIALIZING IN Italian -American Food 112& BARREIT ST. SCHENECT AOY 016-97 44 E~foy Sizzling Steaks and Chops Vi~il Our Cocktail Bar · \ wh~n they both played for St. Louis, and was named MVP in 1961-62. However,· Plante is most remecm!Jered ·for th~t night io Novetnber of 1959, when ·he b~came the first modern goalie to wear a mask in a game. He wore · it after the Ranger's hard- shooting forward, Andy Bathgate, hit fhe well-screened Plante in the face with a 25 foot back-hander. Plante told Canadian coach Toe Blake. that he\ wouldn't go b~ck jn the game unless he was allowed to wear the in~sk. BJa,ke r!!luctaritly agreed. and Plante made hockey h.istory. In the summer of 1968, he devised what is probably the best mask in use •today. It is capable of stopping a puck traveling at 140 m.p.h. As far as the trade goes, both Toronto and Boston should benefit. Toronto, virtually otit of the playoffs; is a team building for the future. a future into which a 44 year old .goalie would have. trouble fittl ng. Boston, on the other hand, is building for the play-offs, With Bobby Orr injured and the team working under a new coach, Plante's experience and savvy can only help Boston. tevrs Dave's.

Ent<:man. In order to help him to reach a decision on whom to hire. a search committee has been formed. It is composed of two administrators, Herbert Wylen and Theodore Sohwart, two f!lctilty members, Robert Schaefer (.chemistry) and Byron Nichols {p<~lit.ical science), and three students, Pat Bohen. Lois Timms, and .lim Alberg. Dean Wylen is the chairman. Senate Does Not Deal With Dogs It is Enteman's hope that such a committee. comprising as it does the three sectors of the campus· popu·lation, will \reflect campus values.\ The group will also serve .to perform the necessary administrative-type work re~ding files, interviewing applicants .. In these two ways. the search committee's findings will help the Provost to make a final select'ion and hire a new Dean. b:y DAVID WAGENKNECHT As the College Senate met yesterday for the last time this term. the first order of business was to defeat a motion that t·he proposal from Dean Martin Iichterman to ban dogs from t:ampus be moved to the head of the <tgenda. The largest crowd of ~pectators this ten11 attended the meeting. overflowing Psychology 213. Most of the spectators apparently came to iobby on both sides of the dog isst~e; others came to lobby for the Hebrew language · course proposals. The next action was the approval of several new courses, inclt~ding some in art and the cl as sica! Ia nguages. Two ttansdisciplinary programs, Studies in Health Science and Materials Science Studies, were also approved. The Senate next approved the retention of Hebrew 10, Hebrew II, and Hebrew 12, as well as the addition to the curriculum of a 130 level course. The further stipulation was made that these courses should \be allowed to run through the school year 1974- 1975, a.nd are to be reviewed during the Fall of 1974.\ . This action satisfied the Hebrew supporters: who then left the meeting. The dog lobbyists also left before the end of the session. The Senate did not deal with the canine issue at this meeting. was a statement of policy of graduation requirements of a student's attaining a cumulative index of 1.8 overall and a 2.0 in his major. This would be in effect beginHing with the class of 1977. Another proposal from this committee was a replacement for a section of the Urtion College Catalogue dealit1g with the student's choice of a major; this was not approved by the Senate. _ The final item discussed was another proposal from the Committee on the Standing of Students concerning academic dishonesty. Bu.t, due to the lack of provision for procedure of due process for a student accused of academic dishonesty, this proposal '¥as tabled until such a provision could b.e incorporated by the proposing committee. At this point, the meeting was adjourned by popular demand. MAY 4, 5, 6 Parents~ Weekend will be held the first weekend in May (4, 5, .and 6). A schedule with many events of interest to both you · and your parents is being planned. We hope each student will encourage his or her parents to attend. Make The students on the committee were chosen from a group who expressed interest in serving on it. The Liaison and Governance Committee selected three out of the 17 students who handed in essays, requested of them by Professor Edward Craig. Craig, the Liaison and Governance Committee's chairman, announced the names of Bohen, Timms, and Matt Swartz on Tuesday. The question arose as to whether Mr. Swartz should be permitted to sit on the search committee; seniors were ineligible, in the original formulation, to be members. Professor Craig informed Swartz on Wednesday that he could not serve on the committee and replaced him with .lim Alberg. rhe Senate also approved a J)roposal from .the .Student Aid Committee that suggested that Union students .regist:ered for either a Union sponsored Study Group Abroad or an Independent Study at an off-campus location under the supervision of U Ilion • faculty, should be eligible for financial aid based upon the need ·your ,hotel or motel reservations early and help make this the most successful student-parent get-together in Union's history. The search committee convened for the first time Thursday morning. Mr. Enteman left his v1ews with the committee members. He mentioned the dichotomy - in the structure of college life between the academic and the non-academic; this latter encompassing such areas as counseling, housing, and medical services. It~ is the Provost's hope that this split might be resolved within \five to eight years\ and a Dean of the College position established to handle the entire r.ange of student-re!ated affairs. However, budgetary restrictions preclude the consolidation of all Drug Bust Two Union College students were among 19 people arrested Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning in a large local drug raid. New York State Police, Schenectady, and other local police departments conducted a three month investigation that resulted in the bust. of their particular program. Another proposal from the Student Aid Committee receiving approval from the Senate stated, \Union College students wh<> register at other accredited institutions for transfer credit to lJ nion College will be considered for loan assistance based on needs relevant to the particular program and the availability of loan funds after commitments to students registered at Union have been met.\ The next ifem on the agenda was a proposa'l from the Committee on the St::inding of Students, the main point of which The police arrested David Cuyler ('73) at his off-campus apartment and Isaac Fitzgerald ('74) at his campus residence. College officials had no prior warning about the arrests. No bail had been set as of Thursday night, and the students spent the night in jail. The charges against Cuyler included two counts of crimimil possession of a dangerous drug, fifth degree; a charge of criminal possession of a dangerous drug, third degree criminal sale of a dangerous drug, fourth degree; growing marijuana: and possession of narcotic paraphenalia, second degree. Fitzgerald was charged with two counts of criminal sale of a dangerous drug. fourth degree; and criminal possession of drugs in the third and fifth degrees. A total of twelve homes and apartments in Schenectady, Scotia, and Rotterdam were raided, and quantities of cocaine. marijuana, hashish, LSD, THC. and amphetamines were sei1ed.

So, a short-range plan has been develo.ped wherein Dean Wylen covers academic advising, and the Dean of Students will be left in charge of all other matters. The responsibilities of the Dean are outlined in a letter which has. been sent to each applicant for the post: \The Dean of Students has overall responsibility for student d•.:\lelopl1)ent and student programs. She or he will have as areas of specific responsibility: Advising for all Students including especially Minority Group Students, Women and Veterans: Admissions; Career Counseling; Financial Aid: Housing; Professional Counseling and Religious Counseling. Specific program responsibi-lities include: The College Center; The Acade.mic Opportunity Program; The Upward Bound Pr-ogram. The Student Activities Program and The Medical Services. Excluding the Medical Services area. there are approximately twelve professionals concerned with the areas outlined. The Dean of Students will have an Assistant Dean of Students and will report directly to the Provost of the College.\ The twelve people in these areas (which does not include doctors or nurses) constitute a group. similar to an academic department, of which the Dean of Students is head. The overlap of functions among the members of this group makes for the team concept each ahlc to help another. Of the twelve administrators associated with the Dean of Students, Entcman noted, all students should he ahle to find one who is sympathc1ic and understanding. photo by Lcs Kernan I he new LJean will have an extensive job to perform, larger and mote difficult, said Enteman, than the conception of it up to now. It will require someone with \energy vitality, ability, and. vigor.\ He must have a \youthful outlook,\ be \student-oriented but have \the guts to say 'No'.\ The Provost also indicated that the extent of the academic 4ualifications of whomever takes the post is not important. Dean Wylen expressed the same idea: a candidate's education, he said, is less important than the possession of administrative ability and the ability to interact with students \in a non-authoritarian manner.\ Advertisements inviting applications for the Dean of Students position were placed in the Chronicle of Higher Education, the New York Times. and two \minority newspapers.\ Over 100 applications have alre\'c~dy been received, and more are expected. Wylen remarked that the most desirable .responses would probably be those from the ad in the Chronicle of Higher Education, judging from the readership of that periodical as opposed to the newspapers. However, this remains to be seen. The search committee will solicit applications from faculty members or administrators on other campuses who would be considered good candidates. It is e\.en possible that a Union employe might apply, although this would entail making himself ~uhject to scrutiny by the search committee and the campus. For. after the folder compiled on each of the applicants has been read and re\iewe.d by the committee. certain superior candidates will be imited to the Union campus 111 Continued on Page 7

On Saturday night, after working all day on· my thesis, l headed north for my date with a Skidm.ote coed .. We saw a movie on the campus and then went to the Hub for a few beers. I left the bar at I :30 A.M. with my date and one of her friends. As we were driving back to their dormitory, the notion struck us to stop for ~ome Preihofer 1 s chocolate natural enough remedy to combat fhe m.unch.ies. 1hey listened politely. We soon arrived at :the station and were booked.; tn'e official charg~ was ''petty larceny.\ I tried to reason with · des.k Sergeant, but I was told, \We're sorry son. You have broken the law.\ Springing the Girls My bail was set at $25 arld the Skidmore sectJrity force was notified to come down and 'spring' the two girls. I only had $13.99, but the girls offered to get the remainder of the monev and come back for me. The The sane (4' the ('l'inw i11 .\'tn-atoga chip cookies. (Many connoisseurs consider these to be the finest . in aU the world, and everyone knows that they're irresistible.) Luckily for us, Saratoga has a 24- hour Central Markets where we planned to purchase the cookies. We went inside and had proceeded to the bakery shelf. when our attention was caught by a completely open box of Freihofer's which had .,a'lready been pillaged. Each of us ate two t>r three cookies from the open box and then walked to the cash register with a fresh box we. wanted to buy. I paid for the. box of \chips.\ We left the store. · As soon as I stepped eut of the supermarket l heard a voice ring out, ''Aha! I ·caught you!\ l turned around and saw the manager runn·il}g towards me, waving a box of .cookies. I was confu~ed and just continued walking .. The man~ger caught up with us and exclai>med, .. I've finally caught you Skidmore girls. You're always trying to rip me off and now ·I'Ve got you. This time you're not going to get away with it!'' I had no idea. What he was babbling about and just ' · stood there bewildered. Finally, I asked, \What did we do'?\ He replied, \You h~ve just been caught shoplifting cookies.:· . · I told him that each of us had only taken two or three cooki11,s from an open box which had been partially. destroyed and.· could not be resold. r then . graciously offered to pay the 5<& for the cookies wflich I . had cons1:1med. He replied, \It's not as easy as that.\ I fried to reason with him and said, \If I had known that this wo_M:Id bother you so much. I wouldn't have done it. Here's 70u: for the box of cookies!\ A Crime He countered. \I don't want your money! You've committed a crime and I want you prosecuted. Sign t~ese papers.\ Whereupon, he thrust some forms at me which I declined to look at. telling him that I was not signing anything. I also added that this was the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of. He then ordered one of his assistanls to call the pol.ice. At'this point I was getting a liHI~ annoyed and I was rt'«dy to run from the store: The girls though, were a little hesitant. I decided that I would gallantly stay and see this thing through. '(I also figured that if I split my date would never go out with me again.} While waiting for \Saratoga's Finest\ t.o appear I asked the youngish-looking manager if this was the way he got his Saturday night thrills. l repeated my offer to reimburse the store for the cookies. He only responded, \The police will be here shortly.\ · photo by L~.:s Kernan police told me, ·however, that if I stayed there overnight, they would call the judge in the morning (Sunday) so he could come and straighten things out. I thus decided to spend the night in the pokey partly out of principle, partly out of curiosity, and mostly to get this thing over with. Nevertheless, before saying for sure whether I would sta:y, I asked the sergeant, \Could I check out the accommodations to see if I like them?\ \I'm afraid not,\ he answered to the acc0mpaniment of snickers from the other cops. I had my one phone call to make, so I called my roommates, Larry Bernstein and Howard Seife. I told them of my plight and that l would not be returning until Sunday afternoon. They thought I had contrived this story and that I was actually staying over af:'- Skidmore. I soon convinced them that this was not the case. . After my call. I started going thre,ugh the familiar · sequence of c,hecking into a jai( (I've seeil it hundreds of · tirtles orl TV).' The police took t·he cooties, my belon~ingS. wire. put irito 1:1 manilla envelope, my belt was removed (lest\ I· hang myself). and I was frisked. They then. removed my ·glasses. ''You can't take away ,Jt ' my glasses,\ I warned, .. I can't see anything. Besides, I'll get dizzy at1d vomit on the floor!\ My threat was to no avaiL \We're sorry, but that's the law,\ he answered. Joe Murphy I was then led away to where the cells are located. The room contained six cells in a row. Cell number one contained Joe Murphy who was sprawled out on his back and was groaning. l was put neXot door. The cell was six feet by four'feet with a p.lank of wood for bed, no blanket or pillow, a toilet (no seat), and a sink. In addition, there was a TV camera keeping a vigil over everything. There was one movable object in the cell, a roll of toilet paper. I lay down on my plank to reflect on my nightmare, but I was soon jolted by a violent tremor shaking the cells. Joe Murphy had flushed his toilet. This was to continue throughout, the ,night due fo -his inebriated condition. ~ • · ... : \'· · • ·· · At 3:30, 1 heafd the jingfing of keys 'and the squeak of the' eutsioe door. The footsteps came closer, and a cop appeared to unlock my. door. \You have to go downstairs.\ I followed him into a room where the Sergeant was waiting for me. He took my mugshot - numbers and all ~ with a Polaroid. I tried to make a mean face. I figured since I was being treated like a criminal, I ought to look like one. Fingerprinting came next. My hands were sweaty when the Sergeant began, so he said, \Go wash up or you'll ruin the prints.\ I didn't want to have lousy prints so I washed up. I could tell that the Sarge was a real pro at taking prints. because instead of taking my thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger and pinky in that order, ·he went thumb, inde>x fin£er, middle finger, then· he got wnfused and finished with index and thumb again. He completely neglected my ring finger and pinky. I didn't want to upset him, as he was a beefy Rod Steiger-type, so 1 let the e~ror slide. Somebody, somewhere, is going to think I have a pretty amazing set of fingers. At the Hllb I was led back to my cell by a youngish cop who couldn't understand why this was happening, but he told me not to worry. While we were walking he asked what was happening at the Hub that night. The H !Jb seems to be more popular than I had originally thought. When I returned to my cell, Murphy was complaining that he only went there to have a few drinks and he must have gotten carried away. This was quite true since he was, in fact, carried into the jaiL He soon fell asleep. The lights in the jail burned brightly all night, and the temperature was so warm that it was almost unbearable. I tried to rest, but every hour they came through to check the cells to make sure I wasn't trying to escape or kill myself. At 7:30 A.M., another young cop came by. He asked if I was the one involved in last night's \cookie caper,\ and he commented on the absurdity of the case. He said the .Judge would be there in .a few hours. I was iJ1 a miserable mood but this buoyed my spirits, knowing there were stil) some sane people around. Except for a , r~w Freihofers and some pretzels from the Hub, I I :n't eaten since 6 P.M. the previous evening. I asked the cop for some coffee which he brought back. • Continued on Page 5 The cops pulled up in a squad car. heard the manager's story. and drove us to the Saratoga Springs Police Station.

Then I counted the ban in my cell. I though! of guy:; kept i'n jail for years on ridiculous charges. I was also fabricating brilliant speeches about civil liberties which I planned to tell the judge. I hope Joe Murphy was interested; he certainly heard enough of them. At X o'clock. Murphy's brother came and bailed him out. leaving me oy myself. I just sa-t in the corner of my cell. As much out of boredom as out of necessity, I decided to answer nature's call. Just m I was sitting down I caught a glimpse of the TV camera. Since I had never been on TV before. especiaily in that posit ion. I wasn't sure of the proper etiquette to follow. I llashed a big smile and waved, thinking of myself being on nationwide TV. I made various gestures to the camera and generally had quite a time. It was the high point of this dismal morning. What's My Bail? At 9:00 my nightmare really began. I heard the familiar ritual of keys. squeak and footsteps. A new Sergeant appeared, a big .John Wayne-type this time. \You got $50?\ he asked. \Huh?\ \I asked you if you have $50.\ \If I didn't have $25.1ast night. how could l have $50 today?\ He told me to ~top wising off and just answer the question. I still wasn't sure what he wanted (especially after reading about New York City cops), but l assumed it was bail. I reminded him that last night's Sergeant set bail at $25. He told me he wasn't interested in what the other Sergeant had told me. \If you don't come up with $50 you'll stay here 'till Tuesday.\ \But last night they told me that Judge would be here this morning. This was the only reason why I stayed.\ \I don't know anything about that.\ Don't ask why, but my first frantic thought was that I'd be unable to attend my scheduled Monday meeting with my thesh advisor whom I had not seen for five weeks. He would never believe this excuse. I figured that l would have to tell him that my cat ate my thesis. My second thought was about continuing to stay in that hole. Incensed at this turn of events I blurted out. \.Jesus Christ, you lied to mel\ He said, ''That Sergeant last night must've been mistaken. Well, you gonna get the $50?\ I said no and. like a little kid, 1 tlir:ned my back on him. \Well if that's the way you want it,\ he replied, before walking out. He returned at 10 and again popped the $50 question. I answered, ''l didn't have it last time you asked me and nothing has changed. Besides, it's Sunday. and since bail mwst be paid in cash I don't see how I could obtain it.\ \Still don't want to pay? O.K .. .''

They told me that they had only come with twelve dollars, and after threatening to cry, finally persundcd the Sarge to let me go for the original $25 bail. I recovered my belongings, but there was something missing -- my cookies. I immediately asked for. them. The stonefaced Sergeant handed them over and told me to appear in court on Tuesday. The girls explained to me that they thought they had heard the Sergeant call the Judge and tell him not to <.:orne because I was a college kid and could easily raise the hail. We then went to the Skidmore cafeteria to celebrate my release with lukewarm eggs and a stale danish. .

Included among these were recommendations that I .-;have. wear a jacket and tie, and keep my mouth shut. In the final [Thone c<JII of th.e day, my parents, despite my protestations. insi~ted on driving up to see the case through. After a fitful sleep, I awoke at 6:30 for my day in court. After a quick breakfast we headed north, arriving at the court a little before 9 a.m. As I walked into the courtroo·m, I was pleased to hear that Joe Murphy was being let off the hook, but he was warned to lay off the sauce. . My atr<Jrney greeted me with the details of the agreement that had been reached with Central Markets: In ret urn for dropping the. eharges l had to sign a release promising riot· to sue Central Markets for false arrest or unnecessary harassment. Worst of all, I also had to apologile to the supermarket manager who had pressed charges against me. I gritted my teeth, and the deed was done. All that remained was the formal courtroom proceedings. ;_· .... ,•I /\('-('/J(/('1/JN'/11 ',( tht• 1111/g photo by Lcs Kernan Starvation Diet At 11:00, the Sergeant returned to inform me that the girls had come and were trying to scrape up the money. As he was leaving I yelled, \Hey officer, isn't starvation an illegal torture tactic?\ mentioned all of the bad consequences -- which reinforced my fears -- but he added. \Don't worry. I'll call up some contacts.'' At 9:30, it was announced, \The court will now hear The People vs. Howard Kritzer. The accus.ed is hereby charged with entering the Central Markets store in Saratoga Springs whereupon the said party proceeded to take a handful of cookies from an open box.

I never got to see the food. l heard the girls' voices at the police desk several times during the next half hour.

Included among these were recommendations that I .shave. wear a jacket and tie, and keep my mouth shut. 1 n the final phone ca•JI of the day, my parents, despite my protestations. lnsls.ted on driving up to see the Case through. After a fitful sleep, I awoke at 6:30 for r:ny day in court. After a quick breakfast we headed north, arriving at the court a little before 9 a.m. As I walked intQ the courtroom, I was p·leased tu hear that Joe Murphy was berng let. off the hook. but he was warned to lay .off the sauce. . My attorney greeted me with the -details of the agreement that had been reached with Central Markets: In return for dropping the, charges I had l'o sign a release. promising not' to .§Ue CentraJ Ma-rkets for false ·arrest or unnecessaty harassment. Worst of all, I a4so had to apologize to the supermarket manager who had pressed charges against me. I gritted my teeth. and the deed was done. All that remained was. the formal courtroom p:roceedings. .-t re-t\nactml'/1' , , r r hi' mug photo hy Lcs Kernan._ Starvation Diet At 11:00, the Sergeant returned to .inform me that the girls had come and were trying to scrape up the money. As he was leaving I yelled, \Hey officer, isn't starvatjon an illegal torture tactic?\ mentioned all of the bad -consequences ---: which reinforced my fears - but he added. \Don't worry. I'll call up some contacts.\ At 9:30, it was announced, 'The court will now hear The People vs. Howard Kritzer. !he accused is hereby charged with entering the Central Markets store in Saratoga Springs whereupon the said party proceeded to take a handful of co.okies from an <·)pen box. The Mtid party then left the aforementioned pr:cmises · without offerrng proper remuneration.\ He glowered at me and snapped, \If you want'to eat, you have to speak up. What do you want?\ \Some burgers, fries and a strawberty milkshake would be fine.\ \All right,\ he said and left. l never got to see the food. I heard the girls' voices at the police desk several times during the next half hour. I desperately hoped they were going to get me out because the time was passing slower and slower. At 11:30 the Sergeant sent one of his subordinates .to my cell. He amwunced, \You're hcing released.\ On Monday morning I went to my dreaded meeting with my thesis advisor, armed with a meager six rases of a proposed twenty page first chapter. I walked in and said. \I suppose you won't believe this hut. .. \ and I gave him my story. · He was incredulous but understanding. \After all,\ he added, \you'll have plenty of time to work on it while in prison.\ I shuddered at the thought. , Next.

While discussing the propensity to giving A's, during th~ \h~~te.~ question and answer sessto~, 1t Is true that Professor Ludwig feh that if all his students deserve_d A's t:hey would get them. His disagreement with Dr. Berthold on this point was whether or not all his students could get A's. Dr. Berthold held the vie:w that all Union students given the proper learning conditions, could learn the mateP·ial in any course well enougb to earn an A (a~though individuals will vary WI.th the speed with which they will re~ch this level. and how much time they will need to put into the course). Dr. Ludwig on t?e ot?er hand was skeptical on this pom~. He. questioned ·whether all . hts students could get A's. In oth~r words, Dr. Berthold felt that It was more probable that ~II st·udents could earn A's than did Dr. Ludwig. Dr. Bertho-ld did not say .or even imply that he would not give student's A's when th~y dese~ve them. which is the- Impress~on given in the article. The questwn arose. though, on _what determined what is deservmg of an A. Dr. Berthold said that all students could and should be deserving of A's, because all ar:e capable of learning . what ~s required in a course. It IS because artificial measurements are used Five-hundred people have now signed the petition. I a~ convinced that there. are still others who would like to see a change.

The 1972-73 Frosh: The Year In Review The /()72-73 Fres/1/ll(l/1 1/(flkt•rhalltr•riJ~I. by BILLY DeB EAR While the varsity basketball team has been catapulted into the limelight recently as a result of earning a berth in a post-sea.,('n tournament, the .resh.:.ei'J finished their season in :he relative obscurity of an away contest, although their outstanding record merited more than this type of finish. In defeating·· Albany, 72-54, the Garnet won their sixteenth game against one defeat, a record for a Bill Scanlon coached team in this sport. Interestingly, the score of this game approximated the average margin of victory for the team throughout the season. While scoring at a clip of 73.5 points per game, the opposition was held to an incredibly low 54.8 points per game. When this figure is compared with the 58 points a game allowed by the varsity, good enough for the nation's top twenty, the significance of this figure is apparent. Also, one must remember that this was accomplished largely without the talents of .John Denio, who was elevated to varsity status, and .Joel Fisher. who gamely tried to play shortly after a knee operation and was reinjured. The team ripped through the first eleven . contests without a blemish on their record. Highlights of this portion of the season included a debut four point win over R.P.l., a 97 point performance against Clark, and a 66-59 overtime victory against Siena. In the twelfth game, Hartwick caught the Garnet on an off-night and took utmost advantage to inflict a 56-53 loss on the frosh. Union rebounded from their poor performance to post wins in the five remaining games. culminating with a last second victory over R.P.l. and the 18 point thrashing of Albany State. Steve Kelly emerged as the most outstanding performer, although it is hctrd to make such a distinction on ct team as well- balanced as this one. Kelly. who made the transition from forward to gu:nd when Denio left, led the team with a 14.5 scoring average, induding 32 points against Siena. Center .John Raymond owned the other douhle figure average on the team. as he put in 13.3 points rcr game, while also tallying 32 in a single night. Bill Coppula. who wa~ the defensive specialist of the photo by Bill Erichson team exhibited great quickness and rebounding ability. operating out of one forward slot. The otner forward was the team's tallest player. Ray Marcinowski, who developed an excellent outside shooting touch, and was instrumental in several close victories, especially with two key baskets in the first Albany game. Complementing Kelly in the hackcourt was Bill Henson, the team leader in assists. Henson, who had the job of bringing up the ball and running the offense. also could hit his jumpe.r consistently from long range. But the talent of the team did not stop after the starting five. Coach Scanlon possessed a group of substitutes that could be called upon at any time and do a more than adequate job. For example, in the Drew contest, the second string produced 53 of the 87 Union poinrs;. For backcourt help. Scanlon could rely on Ma'rk Glater and Brian Breton. G Iazer became popular with the fans for his fancy, but effective passing, and was also a good shooter, while Breton's scoring was helpful in several games. Mark Gillum, another crowd favorite, was explosive on offense, scoring 18 points in oQe contest, and probably could get off the ground better than any ·of his teammates to .snare rebounds against taller opponents. Bones (\I try\) Viniar was, on several occasions, the stopfJer on defense and was also cap.able of scoring in double figures. Substitute forward Dave Malkowich, who transferred from Penn State early in the season, utili1ed his blinding speed to Continued on Page 7 STATISTICS Player (;ames Points A\·cragl' Kelly.

Psyched For Springfield by ALISON SLOAt In 1972. the Springfield College track team went home to Massachusetts with the first place trophy from the U·nion Invitational. This Saturday, March lO, Springfield w111 return trying to repeat their victory. How ever, there is a catch ·this year, a much more powerful Union College track team coming off .three big wins, University of Rochester Relays, University of Rochester lnvitatir.mal, and the Coi't:l'and Invitational. Last year Springfield's one point victory over Union was decided by a poor Union haNd-off in the mile relay. This year's seasoned and psyched Dutchmen .squad is not about to let such a fluke repeat. In addition to Springfield. a strong Cortland track team will once again challenge the Garnet thinclads. Among other schools schedt!led to make the trek to Schenectady are Colgate, Oneonta, R PI, Siena, WiNiams and Buffalo. Ten schools in all Will be appearing to challenge the Dutchmen. who include, record holders Bill \Muscle\ Mowery, Dave Ricks, Tim McCabe, Mark' Mindel and Milt Herring, reliable Union standouts David White, John DeStefano. Stan .Jackson, Steve Jones, Crawford Cutts,.· Scott Kalina and Greg Hamlin, along with the entire group ofGarnet spikers each of whom continues to contribute to the w.i.nning 1973 indoor track season. Field events are scheduled to get under way at ll :30 a.m. on Saturday with the running events to follow at 1:00 p.m. For a day guaranteed to be filled with excitement all are encouraged to come up to the Field· House and cheer the Dutchmen on to another victory. .
