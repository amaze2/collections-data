This oral participation, which is a firm goal of the ECSC, encourages scientific enterprise and exposes students to the type of exchange that goes on in p.rofessional society meetings. A stud~nt may also submit a full paper in written form. These ·paper-s are judged by experts t:r~m industry and universities, with prizes going to the best papers in each of the major fields.

As a member of the administraiion, he has gained a reputation as a hard- worker and a dedicated administrator. Potts has expressed the desire to return to his previous job as professor ef history, but has refused to elaborate on his change in position at the College. Concordy has learned that tenurability was not a factor in his decision to relinquish his position. Provost Huntley had no comment on the matter. On April 6-8, Union College will host the 32nd annual Eastern Colleges Science Conference (ECSC). Upwards of 500 students and faculty members from 100 colleges, .representing nine states, will attend this convention. The ECSC was first organized in 1947 by Pauline Newman, an undergraduate student at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.

From this group of persons, the committee is selecting three to four final candidates whom they feel are most qualified. This was decided upon in a committee meeting last Thursday, March 30th, and Professor Aubrey, the chairman, was to contact the c~hdidates. Professor Boyer d.eseribes the group as being diverse in both background and experience. According to Professor Boyer, the Search Committee is at present organizing the protocal to be used when introducing the candidates to ·the campus. There are three groups that each candidate is scheduled to meet upon his or her arrival at Union. The Search Committee plans to have students and faculty members meet with the candidates in an open forum. Ameeting with the President and the members of his cabinet, which inC'ludes the Provost, Dr. Huntley, and the Dean of Faculty, Dr. Brownlee, is also proposed. The third group that is meeting with the prospective Deans of Students are those who, in the future, will be working under this person, that is, the staff of the Office of Student Affairs. Other members· of the Union College Adm_inistrative Staff as well as the present Dean of Students will also meet with the candidates. The actual schedule remains for the time being tenative until the final candidates are known and appointments to visit the college are made. At that time, the Search Committee plans to publish a synopsis of each candidate and a schedule of event}. :for ··tJle general campus body:-.:· As the Search Committee for a new Dean of Students approaches the deadline set for them, they are nearing the final stages of their mission. The starting date for the new Dean of Students is planned for June 19, 1978. Professor Boyer is optimistic that this time- table will be met and that there will be a final candidate by then. There is a meeting of the Search Committee today, April 5th, to decide on more definitive plans. Meanwhile, Union waits.

Editorials Opportunity As spring term begins, the campus is full of opportunities for -students to become involved in a variety of degrees and fashions. With ~he E.C.S.C. cenvening here this weekend after a thirty year tour since its last Union visit, an excellent chance exists for students, faculty, and administrators to view and learn about some of the best research being done at the undergraduate level in the Northeast. If the campus does not participate in the activities through attendance at the talks, etc., it seems to Concordy that it will be neglecting a fundamental component of academic life. Besides being able to see the dozen or so Union students and their fellow experimenters, the convention offers an opportunity for Union to show that its primary concerns and interests still revolve around academic matters. The spring also represents a time for other· special involvement . projects. The_ Senior Fling unquestionably needs some help as do graduation .plans, a second \Weststock .. and Patent's weekend. Onty personal involvement, again, wikL,make these events as successful as in the past. Turning to campus )!.overnance cons~derations, committee applications are now being accepted and serious consideration should be given to what role each person plays in the campus structure. Also, within a couple of weeks, election petitions and elections will figure predominately in the activities on campus. W,ith so many matters such as student involvement in the governance at stake, the people whom the student body choose to lead them should be thoroughly probed so that strong student leadership does not pass by this campus. RA's and OA's are already in the selection process, and the applications for Gatesmlm are now being accepted. The opportunities to become involved and concerned with stt~dent life still exist. Also, housing for next year must be considered. The spring represents a time for people to seriously consider how their next year here will be spent. A valid and deep look at the varied opportunities should produce a pleasant view for the future.

Grade Point Survey by DANNY WOJNILOWER Last term, the question of redefining the five-point grading system was open for debate before the entire Union College campus community. Con- sequently, an open poll was conducted in Carnegie Hall on ·Thursday, January 26, which yielded fairly inconclusi:ve results. Althougn .. 2/3 (67%) wanted a change,;, there was indecision as to which proposed grading sys- tem was most desirable. Approx- imately 20% voted for the 12- point system: 16% for the 11- .. point. system; 16% for the 7-point system; and 12% for the 8-point system. None of these percen- tages was as large as the 33% who did not like any of the grading systems being ·offered. On March 2, 1978, the All- College Senate voted unani- mously to implement the It-point system, effective in the fall of 1978 for all U~ion students. Still, students seemed to be unsure as to whether or not a change was really desired. Therefore Concor- , diensis conducted a student survey to determine 1) how well students have been informed on the issue and 2) if students, given the change, feel that the grading system should have been changed.\\ .Four hundred surveys were distributed randomly trom the on-campus community with close to 300 surveys being collected. Results proved that Union students are virtually split down the middle as a whole with regard to changing the grading system at all with some interesting d~velop­ ments occurring between the classes. A higher percentage of freshmen seemed to know of the Senate vote as well as know that a poll had been conducted. On the other hand, .seniors were the least knowledgeable on both subjects. Also, seniors seem to have cast their vote substantially less than any other class with the junior class being most prevalent at the polls. With regard to the change, the freshmen and junior clas~ were slightly against the change while sophomores and seniors were marginally in favor. The final results of the poll are shown in the chart accompanying the article. With the grading system now changed; only time can determine its effectiveness here at Union College. Its ability to meet the design for which it was formulated wi11 be determined by the manner in which the students and faculty interact during the coming year.

For four years we have watched your career at Union. For four years, through difficult and passion~filled events, we have watched from afar. For four years we have tried to remain objective,. and, fl>r four years we have given you the benefit of the doubt, choosing to believe tllat the in<:idents surrounding the hockey program w-ere uninten- tional mistakes. We have hardly been loyal supporters of yours.. yet, we believed you and trusted in ypu when we were an \freshmen\ at Union during · th.e FaJI of 1974. We can remember your address to the freshman class, and your admonition, stated in our Freshman Record, that we should always care about our college. Your dismissal of Prof. Martin Lichterman, however, forces us to break our silence. We can no longer give you the -b-enefit of the doubt, no longer attribute your actions as well- meaning but misguided attempts to care about the colh:ge. A professor_ with impeccable crederitials, Martin Lichterman, as both admin- istrator and educator, has served Union. College welL His contributions ~ po.sitive con- tributions -- to tile college far outweigh your own. He is an excellent teacher, a dis- tinguished academic, and a personable and honorable man. We have nothing but the highest personal tespect for bim. You, however, have violated our trust. We have turned from idealistic and eager freshmen into cynical and weary ;,enmrs. After four years, we have had enough. Alter four years, we now see where your priorities are, and where they should , be put. Alter four years, we finally realize that your heart is not with Union, and that your motives are not well intentiC>ned. You no longer act as if you care. We expect that on this issue, as. we now realize you have done on all the others, that you will stonewall, use doublespeak, and, when aU else fail~ issue non-denial denials. Your dissembling on other issues now seems obvious when it was not previously so. You have defamed, thr<1ugh your d.espicable actions, the integrity of an excellent professor and good and kind man.. To him we offer sympathy. It is you who we pity. Bruce Jacobson '78 Steven Fein '78 Lichterman Again Sirs: It is with dismay and deep regret that 1 read of Martin Lichterman~s dismissal as the Distinguished Professor of History and Higher Educa- tion. l know Professor Lich- terman to be the teacher, scholar and administrator who exemplifies the high quality of the faculty Union has always been known for above all else. The w(')rd ~distinguished' in his t iiie is not ill used. A gentleman of Professor Lichterman's intellectual accomplishments, teaching prowess and general demeanor would be a complement to any university faculty, anywhere. Union has been .fortunate to have more than its fair share of superb faculty. Do we have so many of these inimitable people that we can discard them on whim with such a display of callousnes!'i and inhumanity'? Good teachers do not grow on trees. They must be sought after, enc()uraged and rewarded. Is this how we reward excellence? For too long, Union has suffered from a lack of leadership. Until now controversy centered on extrane()US issues such as the athletic program and continuing education. Fortunately, the basic purpose of Union College was not altered. This purpose is, and and must be, undergraduate education of the highest quality. For all the :heated emotions this debate has stirred, it matters little to the purpose of the College whether two dozen stick-wielding skaters play strong or weak opponents. Two thousand other students still got an education. Or so I thought until last week. Martin Lichterman's dismissal can only be seen as a deliberate attack on the quality of undergraduate education at Union College. The money at stake (l guess it to be less than $15,000) is insignificant in terms of a budget of millions of dollars. Yet, for want of a few thousand d ollar.s. Profes$or Lichterman will not be teaching at Union next year. Hundreds of stu.dents will receive a lesser education as a result of this decisf{)n. Professor Lichterman has served Union unstintingly for many years in several different and difficult positions.

CONCORDIENSIS, AprilS. 1978 OPINION. CaJDpas Perspootive by JOHN BONVENTRE As we prepare for another trimester of school, it would be. well to review the events Gf the past two terms and the present state of affairs hete at Union College~ Certainly, this year has been a · most interesting and · controversial one, ·which has left the future confused and fuzzy. The fall and winter were a eha- otic mess of firing, hiring, retiring, bungling, exaggerating and lying. Faculty and administrators were continually blaming each other for all the school's troubles. There were charges and countercharge!> levied, claims of treachery and deceit, and aU to insincere and fa:lse acts of martyrdom. There was the rising fear that the standards of the college were being neglected for the sake of Division I, while others complained that there is nothing incompatible between excellence in academics and excellence in athletics. Meanwhile, the papers were filled with votes of no confidence, leak:s, secret deals and illegal practices. lnneed, faculty and administrators were fleeing Union quicker than frightened residents from a burning tenatnent. Beginning With the firing of Dean Smith, through . the hockey debacle, and right up to the firing of Dean Lichterman, blame has been pointed and refuted, while the overall picture remained a chaotic blur. The campus was filled with opposition and disagreement; consensus was no where to be found. AU too often, ~ulpability was looked for rather thap .solutions. It became more fashionable and enjoyable to destroy characters, than to sit and think out sensible answers to the pressing needs of . the college community. Today, the problems are still very much with us, yet students, 'faculty, and administration remain mysteriously quiet and the campus is filled with an almost apathetic silence. Perhaps there is the hope that forgotten pFoblems work themselves out ,or disappear. Or perhaps, as seems more likely, it is the proverbial calm before the storm. Whatever the ciH,tSI;! of the current peace on campus, it is both deceiving and harmful. Problems must be faced, otherwise they multiply · and worsen. We can no longer afford to merely react defensively, We must confront the problems without emotion, but with maturity, common sense, .and reason. It is not enough to find fault for as is often the case, the culpability is widespread, if not universal. Union College is sailing ·the stormy sea because no one has taken fum control of the helm; there is no leadership, no guidance, no vision. . Above all else, the college must c:;ome to an agreement, a consensus, concerning what direction and what goals Union is going to pursue. The problem is not one of deceitful administrators or power hungry - te ca~~ .· .· .. · ·. apjai;i~f!~-~, pro~oJU~fl' .of fa¢ult~.~J \ ., to--'~iththe-y-w.em oiuw&tiaatinf, .... · -. :· .... :.4 otbt'r · . empi()yment · ·· pbssib;> ·.·. :;;/;l ~ities., .

There is too much disagreemept over what Union should and should not be. The student body should have a very important say in the present and future goals of the college. The students must be in the forefront, voicing their o.pinions, helping to formulate the direction that Union College is going to take. Afterall, it is the· students who are most directly affected by such decisions, and therefore it is the students' rightful obligation to help decide that course which they themselves will take over the coming years.

In a recent visit to the camp'!:S. an amazingly high proportion of faculty l spoke to said they were investigating other employment possib-- ilities. This is a dangerous situation. As a matter of immediate priority. Union must create an atmosphere conducive to quality education. Prqfessor Lichterma,n has been one of the rltOfit articulate and mOderate members of the faeuity i11 wbat ollg\tt to be a heattby and OO'f!Wuiing debate. on Union's pl~e in the world. Every institution should constantly questi<ln itself. its poli'Cies and its practices. Martin Lichterman's experience as Dean <1f' the Faculty at Union and his experience at other comparable institutions: qualify him admirably for a key role in tbi·s debate. Furthermore, be is one of a very few members of th~ College Community who has taken a serious interest in Union's history. 1 cite as an example the innovative t:{}urse on Union's history he tangltt (with Glenn Wolfson, '77), in the spring of 1971. Thus; botlt Professor Lichterman's professional experience and, his role as the historian of Union College ' make hls an essential voice in any discussion af Union's future. President Bonner~s action on this matter is a clear indica* tion (,f the importance he places on free and open discussion in the administra- tion of Union College. For where to be foun<II.

Mike·B .. eo Professor Charles Gati has resigned as the Chairman of the Department of Political Science. In a letter addressed to Provost C. William Huntley, he detailed the reasons for this decision. Gati, who earned his PhD in International Relations from Indiana in 1965, began teaching at Union in 1963. He became Chairman of the Political Science Oepartment in . 1976, succeeding Professor Robert Sharlet. Gati has done considerable research in. Grading Change Approved The AU-College Senate met during the ninth week of last term to consider a report from the subcommittee of the Planning and Priorities Committee defining a \student activity .. ; a proposal for a change in the fall term calendar; a proposal to change the grade-point system; · and a proposal to add the Director of Athletics as a voting member of the Admissions Committee.

The Registrar on the previous vote had to initiate the proposal to reconsider. After someone changed their mind, the vote to refer the issue back to Admissions was then defeated 8 to 14.

Cordially, Charles Gati Chairman After approving the minutes, the P & P report wa:s read. The report reaffirmed the definition of a student activity developed in 1975, with minor changes. The report was approved by a voice vote, at which time it was proposed that another group be constituted to determine the effect of the definition on the funding of the Glee Clubs Mountebanks, and any other groups the Committee wishes to study. This too was approved, with a deadline of April 25 given. stated that to change the Computer program to incorporate course grades to two decimal places would be much too complicated. Since t:he Forum M.eeting Held· The Dean of Faculty then requested an amendment to the pass/fail regulations passed February 9. By an oversight, the two courses per year aUowed to be taken on a pass-fail basis could have been in the , same term, which was not the intention. The regulations were amended to restrict pass-fail courses to only one per term, two per year. A proposal to change the fall term calendar by moving Orientation ahead two days, so that the term may begin on a Monday instead of a Wednesday was introduced. Although this proposal was presented to the faculty January 26 for the February 9 meeting, some faculty members objected due to the realization that they would have to work on Saturday and-or program was already set up to by STEVEN KLINGER allow grades to one decimal The first Student Forum places, it was suggested that .67 meeting of spring term was held be changed to .7, and .33 to .3.

Several appointments someone voting in the affirmative . were made official: Dawn Porto is now the Secretary of the Forum; Gary Cohen has beeri placed on the Admissions Committee; and Michael Marks and Danny W ojnilower will serve on the Presidential Advisory Board. In addition, Messina reported that the Curling Club Constitution had been approved. However, members from the Tax Committee raised questions over reasons . for financing the new club. Accordingly, ·Alan Rutkin proposed a motion to challenge the Committee on Committees' decision and set up an investigation. The request was defeated. The Forum then turned to a rather controversjal subject, the Thursday night Shingles' Flicks Film Series presented by the College Club,. \When Diplomacy Fails.\ Mark Ingles, representing the organization, Claiined that he had gone through all the legal channels and was now obligated to show the films. Yet the student government raised such ques- tions as: Will these \flicks\ hurt the Film Committee?; Is it legal to compete with the Commxttee·l; u the club is allowed to continue to present its films, will others try the same measures, leading to the chaos that existed before the centralized Film Committee?; and where will/or does the funding go? Since the Forum needed time to find the complex answers, they decided to allow Ingles to show his next two presentations while-a full .. scale investigation is conducted. Next, a N. Y.P.I.R.G. represen- tative issued a question to the Fo11um which will be used in the soon to be conducted opinion poll. After some minor revisions the question will read as follows when placed before the student body: \Would you be interested in having a New York Public Interest Research Group (N.Y.P.l.R.G.) chapter at Union College? This poll is only being used to gauge student interest in the possibility of having a N. Y.P.l.R..G. chapter at Union College and will in no way be considered as conclusive.''

Two days later, along w1th the University of Virginia Glee Club, they will sing again, still with Ms. Allen,in Fogg Museum, Cambridge. Their host will be the Harvard Glee Club, and the event is The Harvard Festival of Men's · Choruses. The intent of this festival is to bring together the finest of men's glee clubs to sing a series of concerts of specialized music. This concept is totally unique in the United States. April of 1977 The Five College Chorus of Amherst, Mount Holyoke,\ Smith, The University of Massachusetts, and Union College gave a presentation of the Berlioz Requiem in Lincoln Center's newly renovated Avery- Fisher Hall . .That concert marked the first major event there since its reopening. The year was brought to an exciting •climax by the club's unprecedented tour of Venemeta at the invitation of the Central University of Venezuela at the White House for Jimmy Carter and President Perez of Venez.uela.Rarely before has any chorus ever enjoyed such a privilege. Come and see why the Union College Men's Glee Club gets rave reviews and large audiences wherever they perform. Harvard and Ms. Allen know what you are missing. Glee Club under the reign of Hugh Alan Wilson.· Ed l'lab Have you e':er wondered why the Glee Club !ihou1d be so lucky? The fact of the matter is, that no luck is involved.Under the unequa~led direction of our own Hugh Allen (Coach) Wilson, the Men's Glee Club has only in the last few years beg1,1n to receive the attention too long their due. This meteoric rise began in the Spring of 1972 with their being invited to attend the I MC (Intercollegiate Music Council) conference at Amherst. This was followed soon after. by their being chosen as, hosts of the IMC conference of I 976, a great honor for any dub. Since that time, as if a dam had veritable virtuosos of voice. Tickets for the concert are only 5 dollars,- and can be reserved broken, a flood of requests have come in for their services. In How many people do you know that have been seen by over 80 million ,people? During the Venezuelan tour the Glee: Club made ~ television show seen by that many people throughout Latin America. How many people do ypu know that have sung for the president of another country, not to mention receiving a personal invitation to sing at the . White House? Very few glee clubs. can boast of accomplishments such as these. Why? Our Men's Glee Club is now known as one of the best glee clubs in; the entire United States, and their concerts in New York and Cambridge this month will prove that this reputation is not unfounded.

Andy, a sophomore transfer student from Stonybrook, had been a dynamic force in establishing a chapter of the club at Union. In an interview with Concordy, Andy discussed the remarkable success he has had in establishing the club as well as the benefits of organizing a drive for the creation of the Circle K Club at Union. .Circle K is a community service organization located at many colleges and universities throughout the United States. Ii is affiliated with the Kiwanis Club in Schenectady and local key clubs. The Schenectady Kiwanis Club is part of the Kiwanis Inter- national Organization which has been created for and devoted to d~it j professional and b»~Jness men. ;r'he Kiwanis Clubs- not only provide an irnpo11~~· 'social outlet to the citizens of ,the commun- ities in which they are located but also direct many programs designed to aid less fortunate community members. Manpower for these programs is enlisted from college-oriented Circle K Clubs and high school Key Clubs. In return for the aid given by these organizations, Kiwanis Clubs sponsor and support their community Circle K an~i Key Clubs. funds from the coll~ge. Aside from participating in Kiwanis-sponsored community projects. Andy plans to organize numerous and diverse intra-club activities created and led by individuals in the club, Me feels that the flexibility (),f the club's program will allow its members to create exciting experiences for themselves and their friends. Andy a:lso emphasized the social importance of the Circle K Club. He not only plans to have many' club social activities in- volving Union Circle K members, but also other local Circle K Clubs at the Albany College of Pharmacy,. Siena College, and SUNY Albany. Andy belie'Ves that his club will not only provide , a social outlet for students, but will help more students to \come out of their shells\ and ocadicatt< what Jane Fonda, in a recent lecture at Union, called student apathy. New Security Procedures This relationship proved par- ticularly effective in the establish- ment of a Union-based Circle K Club. With AI Constantine acting as · an intermediary between . the Schenectady Kiwanis Club and Andy Yu(ln; and with Joe Zolner acting as a link with the admin- istration, Andy was able to secure funding for the establishment of a Circle K Club at Union. Andy feels that this. relationship will be particularly important in this, the first year of Circle K's existence. It is important that his organiza- tion remain financially indepen- dent so that it will not have to rely on the uncertain prospect of For those who are interested in the Circle K Club, Andy Yuan -will be conducting a meeting in the Fox Lounge nextWednesday.

On March 13th the Campus Police made a major step toward modernizing campus safety procedures when they opened the new centralized control office in the Physical .Plant Building. The primary feature of the new office Is a Honeywell monitoring system. The system, which informed sources price at upwards of one hundred fifty thousand dollars, can, when fully operational; (l) report alarms, environmental'· hazards and syst~m malfunctions to the operator; (2) monitor environmental conditions in key locations suc(1 as Schaefer Libra- ry, th:e computer center and the boilerhouse; (3) allow the operator guide access to floor plans and evacuation procedures; and (4) allow for direct communication between the control operator and the field officer. . The system, which according to Assistant Director of Security Deloris B. Harris is presently 80 percent operational; is not without its problems. Critics complain that the system only alerts the oper~tor as to which building an alarm originates in ratner than specifying the side, floor or room. According to Harris, that possibility was explored but costs proved prohibitive. However, Harris is hopeful of receiving more funding to expand the system to include such features as catd opened doors in high security areas. One major advantage · of the new operation is that it allows Security to centralize monitoring and dispatch facilities. It alsu frees them froin the burden of time consuming key rounds thus allowing thetn more time to -Protect Your Envitonment Steve Grill concentrate on campus security. One problem was encountered however. when additional students had to be hired to guard the dorm from midnight . until eight in the morning because t_he dispatcher was moved from Richmond. This added seventy- two additional student hours per week to Security's already over- stressed budget. The stress was lightened by eliminating early evening and weekend morning dormitory shifts, and weekend hours at the switchboard. Some critics question the removal of the dormitory guard at thes~ hours, but according to Harris it was the consensus of the women in the dormitories that guards were unnecessary at those hours. When asked whether additional cutbacks or expansions in student guard were forseable, Harris responded that no ,_such actions were planned for the near future. Women's Week .

Yes, yodelling. It was the fi.rst Coffeehouse of spring term, and a very appreciative crowd enjoyed the original songs, country tunes and good music sung by Bill Staines. Bill's ingeniousness was heard in the Staines Concerto in E Major for Trumpet and Orehestra because there were neither an orchestra nor a trumpet. They were Bill~s guitar and. Bill himself, respectively. It was great. My favorite, however, was a piece that Bill took from an old music box and adaoted to . play on the guitar. It was absolutely beautiful, and sounded just Hke a music box as it grad \Ially slowed down and ended in mid-phrase, as a real music box would. Coffeehouse.

At the end of the spring term, Prof. Waters will be leaving the campus for another job. Prof. Waters began his teaching career at Virginia St11te College h Petersburg. It was at .this college that he developed an interest ir. electronic music. He set up a studio towards teaching this particular style. Union hired him fn 1973 as a composer and to conduct the Northeasteni New York Youth Orchestra. · He thus became the 3rd full·time factdty member of the music department. An active composer, Waters composes approximately two pieces. a year. Two of his own compositions have been played by the NENYYO. Prof. Waters has also wo·rked closely with the Mountebanks; writing the music for \The Tempest\ and \Deatb oJ a Salesman;\ helping put together the Renaissance tape for the production of \Man For All Seasons\ and helping witlt the sound .system. While at Unio11, Waters taught four courses: composition. electronic music, and two history-type courses. Two years ago, Waters wa.s reviewed by the department f~r his 3-year review. The departme11t found his composing an~ conducting up to the standards ~f the college. Happy with Waters, the department intended t:<J recommend him with the notatioll 4ftat his teaching skill was weal anti needed improvement. The recommendation was initially reversed by the Committee on Salary Revisions and Tenure. Under the suggestion of Profs. Curtis and Wilson, Waters was given a 2·year terminal contract which provided for another departmental review after 2 years. Although Prof. Waters felt he had worked hard -to improve his teaching skill, last spring he was reveiwed and not recommended by the Committee, thus ending Prof. Waters' career at Union College as of this spring. The professor is not applying for severar jobs although he is unsure a:s to whether he wishes to be a teaclfer. Considering himself a professional performing musician, Waters has found an interest in theater and/ or a co nununity orchestra. His \ideal\ position is that of a permanent conductor so that he could make time to compose. Next year NENYYO will probably be conducted by Edgar Curtis. His retirement in the near f11ture will open a position for the senior member of the Music Department. At that time, someone will probably be hired to be senior member and conductor of tbe Northeastern. A younger composer will at that time then be hired to be Waters' successor, but not as tile Northeastern conductor, Prof. Waters leaves Union College with a respect for the. surrQunding community. Being the conductor of the Northeastern he has had an unusual amount of contact with the Schenectady· Albany-Troy area. He finds it \remarkable\ that an area of this size can support not only the NENYYO but also a strong program ih every school district. The people are interesting and very cultured, lending to a totali:y enjoyable experience for the professor.

Waters saw that there is a stronger common bond between the two .areas than usually thought. He feels that a respect for the technical expertise in both fields create'S a tremendous affinity between them. It has been his experience that more science majors take a music course for enjoyment than do students of the liberal arts.

Hines, the mast~r ·of the jazz and swing keyboard, playing Monday night in the Chapel proved that tbe best music is natural, free and knowledgeable.

This sincerely proved to be an enjoyable contributian to campus. New Rock From,.:.\Television'' by STEVE MONOSSON This past February vacation I attended a concert given by the new wave band Television, a group fronted by the artiste extra- ordinaire Tom Verlaine. The show was spectacular, as it turned out to be a witnessing of some of the most concisely and vivaciously performed rock and rol(.that I've heard .since before Lou Reed went under for the first time (a.k.a. his Rock and Roll Aninial phase). What relevanee this has to a review of the records by the bands Suicide and The Real Kids is about to be divulged immediately. At· this same concert, seated directly across from this illustrious rock critic, was the president - whose name I can't quite recall - of Red Star Records. Being that Red Star is just one .step down from Columbia, I se.ized the opportunity to make vital connections and I offered my services as a possible promotional device. Actually, my friend spilled · his beer all over the guy's coat; so after all the apologies we got to talking about our individual occupations, and our likes and dislikes as far as musical talents (and mis-talents) were concerned. The by now almost dry rock big wig acquiesced to the idea of ~aving his contractees expose<! to upstate-middle class- disca crazy-science and engineering maJoring college students, and he took my address and promised to ship ine. the records first thing in the morning. Eventually and miraculously, I returned to UColl. The r$!cords were there. I played them. Wow. The Real Kid's play rock and roll like it's supposed to be played. They hail from the Boston area, and it's the kind of record which the boys of the same name would listen to after they get off work. It's romantic, it's retrogressive; and it's rallying rock and roll. It has to be some sort of feat to sit through ••An Kindsa Girls\ and be totally honest with yourself. Band leader- song:writet-guitarist-~ocalist John Felice expresses his thrill with the resurgence of real rock in \Rave On'', as 1964 makes a comeback and saves the day. GIRLS are an overbearing concern witlr Felice, and he treats them as playthings and shows (underStandably) no tolerance for the ·improprieties of human relationships. In ••Roberta\ he sums up the essence of male-female encounters with these two song encompassing lines: \I ain't mad at you{ don't you be mad at me.~· What else is there to say? \Reggae Reggae\ is hilarious in that it has nothing to do with that musical style; and it could be taken as a statement on the validity of the Jamaican jive jinglers. A particularly stunning number is \Just Like Darts\ a throbbing ballad of the return of the loving G-string of the electric guitar and escaping from the ultimately frustrating and confusing one of the human female. He sings: ••They want me to meet their boyfriends/! tell them not today I Cause you know those kinda guys/They always get in my way.\ Nothing's gonna stop the Real Kids from plugging out the tunes, and they make the listener feel that desire in every song. All in all, the Real Kids handle themselves superbly and make for terrific listening. resemblance to Pink t'loyd's \Animals\. Only this time the animals are mounting an active attack on society rather than slowly sucking away at the nation's natt,ual and cultural resources. ••(]host Rider\ begin.s the set with a modern day Paul Revere warning America not of the ·. British invasion, but warnillg America of America itself. The beat is constant. It grips. It fri_ghten~. Od4ly enough, though, the listener· i's · compelled to listen to it over and over again. Freaky! The format is new wave (something like punk. rock for those of you who don't know) as interpreted. by the first interplanetary visitors. Did you ever see ••The Creature From The Black Lagoon'!\ Well, if he could sing then Alan's vocals would . come close to that possibility. ··cherie\ is The Troggs' ··wild Thing\ with some slight alterations; \Johnny\ is Chuck Berry of the 21st century. The killer cut, something that could almost be construed as being the title track, is ••Frankie Teardrop\. My aforementioned beer spilling partner says that \Frankie\ is a big party hit at Oneonta State, where he has sex and goes to school on the side. The fact that the song, or more accurately a dirge, is a party smash is ironic in light of the sentiments of the hymn. To summarize, Frankie does himself and everyone around him in and becomes a symbol of our times with the lines: ••we're all Frankies/ We're all lying in helL\ Obviously, this platter is for those inclined toward the unusual. But look, you could do as the Oneontans do and disregard the lyrics and ••party out\ to it. The screams are a real trip. Find An Angle Krazy Cat Then there's Suicide.

'c CONCORDJ.£NS.lS, A:prilS. ,J9Z8. , ·Awareness Week Set Union College is currently experiencing its first Jewish Awareness Week, This week serves a twofold purpose: to bring the light of Judaism to the campus community ana tQ serve as a fundrais~r for the United Jewish Appeal. Many· events of historical and current interest have already occured and have been planned· for the days to ·come. Sunday, April 2, a discussionwith Reverend Graul took place in Strauss Lounge. Reverend Graul was on the ship Exodus which brought Jewish refugees to the state of Palestine. He spoke on the development of the state of Israel, dealing not only with historic developments but with issues and events that are currently taking place in Israel. Monday, April3, the film Exodus . was shown.· This fjlm deals with the formation ·of the state of Israel. Not only does this movie 'serve as entertainment; it depicts the struggles of the Jewish people to develop their homeland. Food Service Reviewed by RANDY KLEIN Union College is currently undergoing a reevaluation of the food services that it offers the college community. This includes the operations of West College, Hale House, the Dutch Hollow Pub, and the Rathskeller. A Food Committee formed by the Committee on Committees is • presently exam1nmg the numerous problems with food services at Union and their possible solutions. Upon speaking with Angelo Mazzone, member .of the Food Committee, and the man in that little office by the package room who, in effect runs the Dutch Hollow Pub, several problems became clear. The biggest areas of question seem to be West College and Hale House. According to Mr. M~tzzone. \The problem in the past has been because West is sup.porting Hale House\. In its present state, \Hale House is not profitable\ and the West College meal plan must be used to subsidize Hale House. The Food Committee is studying various options for Hale House next year. Mr. Maz?:one indicated that Hale House will not be open to the West College meal plan tinder any. of: the options under consideration. These options include a cash only type service, an upper elass dining hall with a ten meal'Jilan, or, as a last resort, closing down Hale House. Under the first plan, food would be sold for cash only. All students would be allowed to use Hale House, but no meal tickets vve.uld be accepted. The second plan would create a ten meal plan for upperclassmen only (two meals a day during the· week). Hale House would then become an upperclass dining hall and would not l>e open to freshmen or West College meal tickets. The cost of such a meal plan would depend on the numbers of people on the plan but would undoubtedly be relatively expensive. The final plan would be to close down Hale House entirely which the Food Committee would prefer not to do. Several additional options were sugested by Mr. Mazzone in order to avoid closing Hale House. One of the sugestions was that Union College take over the fold services at both West College and Hale House to cut out the middle man. Mr. Mazzone stated however, that' \Union College would prefer to \stay out of the food business\ and that although .it will if it has to. a food service run by Union College itself is \a long way down·the road''. As a more drastic suggestion, Mr. Mazzone felt that it would be 'beneficial' to establish a requirement that all students living on campus be on one of the ineal plans. (He stressed the fact that contrary to popular practice, it is illegal to cook in most of the dorms.) In spite of what happens at Hale House, the Food Committee is presently taking bids from food services for West College. Although SAGA has placed a bid to continue for its 18th year at Union, the committee is actively considering other food services. With new management as well as some newer equipment and dining room furniture, SAGA has managed to upgrade its services over the past several years however, Hale House has been a persistent drain and the Food Committee is lo.oking for something more~ According to Mr. Mazzone, SAGA is currently supposed to run nine 'special meals' per year. Certainly we've had two buffets and several 'steak diners', but the more in mind. Mr. Mazzone, who used to manage the dining hall at Yale related such 'once a month specials' as Western nights or Italian feasts where a theme. was carried out in food, dining hall decor, as well as spirit and perhaps fitting live entei:tainment. Of course the obvious question is cost however, the elimination of Hale House as a burden would supply that extra revenue. It is in the opinion of Mr. Mazzone and numerous others that the West College Dining Hall is not utilized to its fullest potential. Although it is one of the largest rooms on campus and has kitchen facilities, not even a handful of parties, dances, or social events have been held at. West although it is available.! The Food Committee is actively seeking suggestions, · ideas, and comments concerning food services at Union next year. Are you satisfied with SAGA? What should we do with Hale House? Why isn't the West College Dining Hall used??? The members of the committee are: Chris Cameron, Gary Cohan, Barry Engel, Mary Mattimore, Lorrain Marr11, and Angelo M~zone.

Geek Speaks I wa:s in the midst of editing my latest manuscript, ''The Epic Traditian and its Transmutation from the Oral to the Genital\ when I received a phone call from an old acquaintance, one Luigi Greenblatt. Luigi and I had known each other for many years, and I recall the many pleasant houn we had- spent . in the secluded •inner sanctum~ of the Hashish Liberation Club sucking pensively upon a hookah, whom We had rented (if 1 may assume a less e:wdite posture) for the evening. Ah, but as Kafka once put it, \the folly of digression is no greater sin than that of stupidity; the only difference being that digression is tangential, whereas stupidity is either a. moronic ·digression or my brother, ·Erich. •• At any rate, I hadn't seen (and, neither had I spoken to, or at,) Luigi since his unfortunate incarceration in the All-Night detention center for fondling a Wordsworth anthology without due cause. Imagine my surprise when he said: ••oeek pick up an application for the \Term Abroad in Miami\ program tomorrow,\ and hung up. Were it any other caller, I would have merely laughed off his cryptic demand as the product of a diseased mind. But Luigi~s mind (although certainly diseased, and 1 can only regret his liaison with Unclean Eileen for it) was perversely sharp. Perhaps, I thought to myself, I ought follow up on this request. When arrived at the Humanities office to pick up my application form, I was accosted in a jovial manner by Summer, Bocci, Tinkle, and a stoic young . man they called 'Harpsichord,' who Was humming \Angry Young Man\ to himself, causing his gums to blee rather badly. I smiled. \Are you also here for the so- named ••Term Abroad in Miami?\ They smiled, and replied they were; soon after we were crying unashamedly, and grasping each others extremities, and laughing. We had all had too much to smoke, I fear. At that instant, as we lay panting upon the floor, in strolled Professor Fuernd, that irrepressible bon-vivant of the English faculty; and a man who once boasted of having read the Aeniad in its original German.

Last year the Dutchmen finished 5-8 with a relatively young 'team. This year, with a number of seasoned :veterans, they'll look to improve on that recotd. Gone are centerfielder Gary Borgese and pitchers Charlie Flanigan and John Mayer. However. the combination of veterans and enthusiastic newcomers should more than make up for their depaFture. Best of the returnees are Joe Lavery, a sophomore pitcher from Canajoharie, and Dave Adsit, a junior outfielder from Cooperstown. not pitching, Joe moves his .347 batti11g average to first base. Adsit has been a -standout hitter for two years. for the Dutchmen. La~t season, he led the team in batting average .(.434), runs, hits, homers, and was second in runs batted in. 'Lavery and Adsit will hardly be alone, howe·ver, as this Union team promises more depth than usual. · Back are outfielders Carmen Galt£~ (.26$) and Trace Anderson (. 387), who, along with Adsit, junior Mark Decker and soph Terry Weber, should provide for a solid outfield. Freshman Andy Audet (Canton) and versatile Skeeter Gazzola are battling fol\ the first base job, and seph Dave Grotz will be challenged for the third base slot by junior.

Among the others are junior Kevin Fredericks of by Glenn Meyers and Deb Kaufman The Union College Rugby Team took to library field this past Saturday to play the Cornwall Rugby Club of Canada. As is traditional, Union Rugby was victorious. In the A game, Union took the lead halfway through the first half when Glenn Meyers and Peter Felker were effectively pushed for a score by the entire hustling Union serum. The Union serum successfully destroyed Cornwall's attempts at rucking and mauling throughout the game. Burt (Golden Foot) Slavin converted the serum's score from a difficult angle in his usual style. The Union line was caught hustling and effectively moved the ball downfield thr<>ughout the match with excellent passing and pinpoint precision kicks. Cornwall's only score came early in the second period when a penalty 'try' was awarded them. Union's second score occurred halfway through the second period. Mark Edgerton found himself on the three yard line and proceeded to dive into the end zone through three Cornwall defenders for an unassisted score.

..... FounJeJ ,at Union College 1877 Vol. 107 ·Schenectady, N.Y.,. Wednesday, April 12., 1978 No. 19 IEF Decreased Senate discusses Allen Committee Report. A new conce.pt in higher education was initiated almost a year ago today in the AU-College _Senate and sanctioned by the Trustees: the I.E. F. (Internal Education Foundation). Its authors. Glenn Wolfson and ex- Provost Eritemann, envisioned a fund that would finance exclusively progressive academic purposes. such as undergraduate resear.ch and in.novative programs on campus. The first meeting of the IEF Committee composed of Dean Brownlee, Dwight Wolfe, Michael Ganz, Prof. Neal Allen. and Prof. Kenny which ma~ages Senate V oiees Dismay by Dale Rubin, Joe Cappuccio · The first All-College Senate Meeting of the term was held on April 6 in the Old Chapel. The agenda contained a resolution concerning a change in the start of Orientation '78 from Saturday to Thursday~ the resolUtion was originally brought to the Senate during the Fall Term by Professor Reece. The issue was· addressed by the Fact.dty -~'M'bl:rs ~ho seemed opposed to the shift in the sehe-dule ·which- ,:.wuul(l+ have Orientation beginn-ing on Thursday and classes on Monday.This would giv~ the students · all Thanksgiving week off. Opposition to the change in schedule was registered hy Prof. Paul LeClerc; · Joe Zolrier, Director of Student Development. and Dean Paula Brownlee. Zolner spoke about the negative -effects it would have on Orientation scheduling and for this reason opposed it. He also wertt on to say that the social and. academic phases of Orientation would be mixed in an undesirable combination. Dean Brownlee, who was out-of-town for ,the meeti'ng. wrote a memorandum of o.p1mon which was read by Provost Huntley, who chaired the meeting. {President Bonner was absent.) The Dean argued against the change on academic grounds in terms of inconvenience to the Faculty. The proposal was defeated by a vote of 13-6 . with sophomore representative Randy Feldman absent. Student F orulll President Michael then presented to the Senate a resolution thatcriticized President Bortner's action of retaining J.A. Shupe as Director of Admissions contrary to the recommendations of the Allen Committee. Even though this order of business was noi on the agenda, it seemed that the Forum had tried previously last term to bring the issue to the All-College Senate. Then there was a discussion on ·the resolution. which according to some Faculty Senators \came as a surprise.\ Some of these senators were hesitant to act on it in that no prior consultation was had from their respective divisions due to the. resolution not being on the agenda, Student Trustee Brian O'Toole then responded by denouncing the President's Advisory Board were conducted actl:ons asking that the· Senate and have been acted upon; \The voice their outrage. .Professor recommendations in these reports .

Due to these considerations, the Shupe decision by Bonner did not constitute duplic;ty, contended Public Relations. According to both Provost Huntley and Jack Maranville, the action was in the best interest of the school. Maranville also .indicated that Shupe's supposed terminal contract was not to be made public. and that its terminal nature could be reconsidered at a later date. When the terminal 1;1ature· became· public, other considerations were also introduced. au.d the decision to retain Shupe reflected these considerations as well as the. best int~rests of the college .. Continued on. Page 18 Acceptances Mailed Out by LINDSAY 1' AN The annual cycle of answering inquiries about the college, the organizing of to11rs, the giving of interviews 1 and the processing of applications from prospective freshmen. culminated for the Admissions Staff this past Friday, April 7th, in the sending out of one thousand six hundred and thirty-one acceptances for the class of 1982. · this year the adm1ss1ons statt, headed ' by the Director of Admissions Jay Shupe, received and read three thousand and forty applications for admission to Union. This was a two and a half percent increase over the previous year. Both the number of male and female applicants rose; furthermore, the applications to the engineering departments were most markedly increased. The projected number of freshmen to enroll next year is five hundred and thirty. This figure is sixteen more than the number which registered in this year's freshman class. To obtain this desired number of students, places were offered to one thousand six hundred and thirty- one applicants, with a waiting list of five bundred and fifty persons. To these figures are added a further seventy-two students who were accepted under the early decision plan. Mr. Shupe said that the number of candidates they· accepted was conservative and the Admissions -office might have to go into the waiting list, which contained many suitable applicants who could not be included among the accepted candidates. Last year, Union had to reach into the waiting list; Mr. Shupe described that sit\lation as going \deep into the. list, but not beyond.\ As for the composition of the successful applicants, the male-to- female . ratio is approximately a reflection of the applicant pool; thirty-one percent of those accepted were female. This is also roughly the ratio in the college at present. Mr. Shupe said that an overwhelming number of children of alumni were accepted this year. This was due to the fact that they represented a strong academic population and there were very .: few doubts about offering them , places here. For the combined programs in which Union participates with its affiliates of Union University, Albany Medical College and Albany Law School. Union has accepted twenty-five students for twenty spaces in the six-year medical program, while in its six- · year law program, Union has accepted eleven for ten positions in the first round. There is a list • of alternates to fill the vacancies if the need arises. , This year the college has. for the first time. selected a recipient for the Faculty Scholar award. This scholarship is a financial aid· award which eliminates the loan and job which would normally have been awarded to the student. This award. made possible by contributions from the members of the faculty, is based on academic scholarship as well as financial need. The selection was Continued on Page 10 me ,program. met for the fin 1: time at end of June 1977. 1 ;~, allocation of funds did not start until November 1977 at which time I.E. F. became functional. From its inception, the new program received outstanding publicity being featured in Change Magazine, a national education journal among others. A number of the top schools in- cluding _many. of the 1 vy League have contacted U ni.on contemplating the possibility of starting their won funds for these purposes. The funding of I EF comes from 2 percent of the student's tuition. Specifically, $75 of the recent $400 tuition increase was earmarked for IEF with the remainder going into the General Fund. According to a source from Planning and Priorities, .. almost two-thirds (60 percent) of the lEF budget has not been used. It has also been learned that the surplus from IEF's budget (approx. $JOO,OOO) has been placed into the General Fund of the College operating budget. Concordy has also learned that the cabinet has decided to cut the IEPs 2 percent budget to I percent for future years. The lEF bas two categories of funding: in tbe fir$t category, student initiated research projects, the l®f:~-~\22 pmp~ls which requested -a total of$ I 1,;000 ··in support.. Funding was approved for 17 of them, awards totalling 4.616; ranging fr()m $50 to $1,010. The wide ranging projects 'funded included a documentary on the experience of Schenectady's early Italian . immigrants and ·a .study of rate &eterniination in the Massachusetts automobile insurance industry. In the second category, which deals with requests for funding innovative education on campus, twenty-seven proposals were submitted requesting a total of $81,000 in fundi-ng. The Committee approved 15 requests appropriating a total of $22,384. The funded proposals included: attendance at a summer workshop to address the problem of inadequate writing skiHs, acquisition of basic equipment for a new bio-psychological lab, and support for guest speakers in the field of communist studies.

Editorials Duplielty? The All College Senate meeting, held last Thursday, yielded the CUrious passage of a proposal which CGnspicuously showed their disapproval of the President's actions regarding the retention of Director of Admissions, Jay Shupe. The action appears, on the basis of students and many faculty, to contradict the President's statement of the early fall. At that time the President indicated that the recom111endations of the Allen Committee had been acted upon; however, he did indicate that these recommendations wer-e still open to f<eview by the trustees and administrative inquiries. Although the President did not clearly state that the Allen Committee recommendations had been acted upon in a positive fashion, the popular interpretation on campus was that the Allen Committee proposals would be carried out as listed. It seems that the President should be extremely dear on matters of that degree of importan~e to the college. h is lack of clar-ification at the time of his announcement and at the time of Shupe's reinstatement has only added ta the long list of incidents of poor leadership and poor judgement. If Comcordy assumes that Bonner chose t:he wording of his statement so as to hide his disregard for the findings of the Allen Committee; then the President is indeed guilty of the duplicity of which he has been charged. On the other hand, if Concordy a\ssumes. that the wording was not designed to hide anything and that he was accurately relating the state of affairs regarding the Administrators mentioned in the Committee report, then the President was still neglecting his leadership role by having allowed a nebulous remark to spread .throughout the campus. At a time when he was calling. for a clean ·· slate and a fresh start, this action seems highly incompatible with the actions taken. The President has both mislead the campus and failed to act in a responsible manner with regard to the judgement granted him. Shuffled Funds At the present time, it appears as if one of the most important innovations at Union College in recent years is running intQ problems almost at it\s outset. The major problem seems to be the alleged mismanagement cqncer.ning the budgeting of the IEF's funds. In a year when the school budget may run up to $!6 million. in the red, it seems somewhat ludicrous to condemn an organization for not spending its entire budget. Upon its inception, the IEF was to be funded from an increase in undergraduate tuition, approved specifically for this purpose. This increase a·mounted to $75 per student, per · year; totaling approximately $150,000 for the current academic year. Although sources refuse to'divulge ex:act figures, Concordiensis bas reason to believe that no more than I 13 of this amount has actually been spent. As stated ia the page one article, the surplus from this budget is being laundered (sic) through the Planning and Priorities Committee into the genera:! operating. budget of the College, a direct violation of the constitution of the IEF on two counts. Firstly, the All College Senate has jurisdiction over the I EF, not the· Planning and Priorities Committee. Secondly, the fact that the money used to fund the IEF came from a specific tuition increase suggests that these monies cannot be used for other purposes. Concordiensis sees only two courses of action concerning this money. Either refunding the surplus money by distributing among all undergraduates or .refunding money to those leaving Union and lowering last year's tuition by an appropriate amount. The announced tuition for next year ($4,600) includes money to fund the IEF without assuming any surplus from the current year. The carrying over of this money until next year appears to serve no useful purpose. By avoiding the All College Senate and going through Planning and Priorities, it appears as if the College is attempting to balance the budget and thereby cover up mismanagement in other areas by misdirecting funds appropriated solely for use by the IEF. In fact, the lEF must be looked at critically so that the gross error that occurred this year is not repeated. More importantly, other aspects of Union College must be reviewed in an effort to prevent the deficit budget that appears to exist now.

CONCORDIENSIS; Apri{ !~.19!8 · Forum Okays Films Monday night's Forum meeting, the second .of the Spring tertn, showed our representative~ to be well back into tbe swing of things, as they briskly resolved old business and br.ought o·ut fresh proposals for tbe future. Forum suggested a solution to the altercation between Mark lngel:;, mofie.sh()w\ng president of the \When Diplomacy Fails\ club, and the duly appointed school ~ilm Committee. It was decided that lngels shall be allowed to conti·ni.le showing his films in SS 016. The rationale offered by the Forum speakers for this decision was that the war films, since they only appeal to a special clientele, are not considered to be in competition with the Committee films. Furtnermore, the Diplomacy Club could not be restricted fwm airing their presentations by any written qU&lifications serving to restrict such activities to the Film Committee. However~ certain restrictions · were proposed; The war films must be henceforth advertised as \When Diplomacy Fails\ presentations. If the club's films should lose money,, the tax committee is under. no obligation to reimburs!l the organization, since there is no money .budgeted for this purpose. The Forum evidenced disappointment in .the loosely delegated rights of the Film Committee, and there were murmurings to the effect that more specific attribution of powers would be necessary in tne future. As it stands, SS 016 and the film equipment will be authorized for use by clubs on a first come, first serve basis. The sect,trity t· committee has come to the conclusion that no freshmen cars should be allowed on campus, as of tne forthcoming Fall term, ·due to the extreme lack of parking space. This proposition, destined to be highly unpopular with in,coming students, was further justified by the sentiment that freshmen do not need individual transportation, The committee feels that this restriction would be academically advisable .in that it would . keep the first-year thus encourage their involvement in the school. A well-known Forum member suggested, somewhat sarcastically, that the same effect might be achieved by chaining the freshmen to tbeir bedposts. • After maldng a statement concerning the current situation with regard to the position of Junior Trustee, Forum member Murray Levis~m pointed out the previously unnoticed option of an annual Forum review of the Junior Trustee. The Forum's consensus was that although they do have the power to review the actions of Junior Trustee Bria1_1 O'Toole, this would be a .difficult action to undertake since the Forum members have never witnessed Brien in his meetings with the Trustees, and since only comQlimentafy reports of O'Toole's behavior have reached the senators ..

CONCORDIENSIS, Apri/12, 1978 - ~ Forum Okays Films Monday night's Forum meeting, the second of the Spring term, showed our representatives to be well back into the swing of things, as they briskly resolved old business and brought out fresh proposals for the future. Forum suggested a solution to the altercation between Mark lnge~, movie-showing president of the \When Diplomacy Fails\ club, and the duly appointed school 'f~ilm Committee. lt was decided that Ingels shall be allowed W 'Continue showing his films in SS 0 16. The ratil:male offered by the Forum speakers for this decision was that the war films, since they only appeal to a special clientele, are not considered to be in competition with the Committee films. Furthermore, the Diplomacy Club could not be restricted from airing their presentations by .any writ•ten qualifications serving to restrict such activities to the FiLm Committee. However, certain restrictions were proposed. The war films must be henceforth advertised as \When Diplomacy Fails\ presentations. If the club's films should lose money, the tax committee is under no obligation to reimburse the organization, since there is no money budgeted for this purpose. The Forum evidenced disappointment in .the loosely delegated rights of the Film Committee, and there were murmurings to the effect that more specific attribution of powers would be necessary in the future. As it stands, SS 016 and the film equipment will be authorized for use by clubs on a first come, first serve basis. Last year tU1t10n was raised by $150 to establish and fund the International Educational·· Foundation. The IEF was originally proposed by the students to further student research and honor program .possibilities. Those IEF funds not used in a given year were to be carried over for use in the following year. It turns eut that less than half of the funds allocated to the lEF were used. Therefore the administration, in reassigning its budget, took a portion of these surplus funds to fill a deficit in another area, and then cut the lEF funding for the following year to one-half of its original base - without reducing tuition - until the lEF could become mere ''responsible\ in its use of funds. Same Forum members asked if not using ftmds extravagantly so as to deplete them was classified as irresponsible. However, it was the contention of the Forum that a stronger attempt should be made in the future to use all of the funds. The Forum will be checking areas into which lEF- slated tuition increases have been channeled. The Fourm announced that all committee applications must be submitted by no later than 4:30 on Friday, April 14th. Prospective applicants are urged to apply - but no exceptions to the April 14th deadline • will be: made. •A Forum member also voiced the opinion that Union students need a few motivated individuals to join the bookstore committee in pushing for the sale of used books at the college bookstore. Mark Burnett, a the Planning Committee, gave member of Priorities a list of proposed areas of student concern to be covered in the Union College mission statement, which is part of the Middle State Evaluation Doc11ment. The topics are admission standards, curriculum and the possible establishment of rigid Freshmen English and Math requirements, energy situations of the future, upcoming athletic programs, and educational programs beyond the traditienal four years at Union. The mission statement will be f.urtller discussed at next Monday night's Fourm meeting. Since the mission statement is supposed to reflect the issues on which the student population is most desirous of positive action, student walk-in attendance is highly encouraged. The meeting starts at 10:00 in SS IIO. Be there if you can! Morrison contemplates future of Union hockey. , ' Mark Felnberj Morrison Visits Campus by ANDY ALTMAN. and ED PAIKOFF 'i:harlie Morrison. the newest addition to Union's coaching ranks, has been visiting the college this week in an effort to acquaint himself with the \'orkings of the academic and athletic programs here. Morrison's appointment as varsity hockey coach and manager .of Achilles Rink was announced earlier this term by Athletic Director Richard S. Sakala, and was was reported in last week's issue of Concordiensis. Although he ·will not begin in a full~time capacity until he completes his contractual obligations with Lake Forest College in Illinois, Morrison has Umon with the philosophy that athletics must be subordinate to academics at an institution of Union's caliber. At the same time, he expressed the belief that excellence in academics can be combined with successful athletic programs as long as the college keeps things in their proper perspective. The security 1 committee has come to the conclusion that no freshmen cars should be allowed on campus, as of the forthcoming Fall term, due to the extreme lack of parking space. This proposition, destined to be highly unpopular with incoming students, was further justified by the sentiment that freshmen do not need individual transportation. The committee feels that this restriction would be academically advisable .in that it would keep the first-year thus encourage their involvement in the school. A well-known Forum member suggested, somewhat sarcastically, that the same effect might be achieved by chaining the freshmen to their Candidates Here already been in touch w1th 1~ ot the 20 students accepted for the Class of 1982 who are also considered to be hockey prospects. \In addition, Coach Morrison .has spoken with a number of Union's former hockey .players.

The Forum's consensus was that although they do have the power to review the actions of Junior Trustee Brian O'Toole, this would be a difficult action to undertake since the Forum members have never witnessed Brien. in his meetings with the Trustees, and since only com~limentary reports of O'Toole's behavior have reached the senators. Two candidates for the position of Dean of Students will be visiting the college this month. This is part of the continuing process being undertaken by the Dean of Students Search Committee. Each of· the prospective Deans will spend two days on campus, meeting with various administrators, students, and faculty members in addition to touring the campus.

Also, the number of schools participating increased to 72, up from 'last year's · record of 55. Why the noticeable increase? Union was provided with some financial assistance, which enabled many more schools to come to New York State. This aid was provided through the development office. Many participants agreed that Union was an excellent college in which to hold the conference. Its atmosphere and pedalogical tenets have,· ,asserted undergraduate research, whereas larger colleges usually concentrate on gradtiate research. Awards were given to those people w.ho have shown ability to delve into research in their respective fields and to present their papers to an audience of academicians. Awards were presented only to those who had written papers. The entire list of winners appears below..

I have no doubt that, along with being a very stimulating lecturer. Professor Gado is writing a thoughtful, thorough, and creative piece of literature. Gado has rewritten and submitted three to four hundred pages of his lngmar Bergman film analysis which dates from 1942 to the present. His first priority is his teaching job here at Union which is why it has taken him 12 years to research and write a thousand- page first draft. Professor Gado grew up in West New York at a time when film was beginning to be regarded as a serious art form. Film had primarily been viewed as a form of entertainment. It concerned sttch topics as mystery, gangsters and love. Upon the advice and Alexander and Garis Fields, which are beset with drainage problems and sparse turf. would both be allowed to remain unused for two growing seasons after they arc rc~ccded. I his would allow them to recover. During this time, the activities that would persuasion of two influential professors during his undergraduate years at Danrnouth, Gado decided to enter the teaching profession and developed a deep interest in the works of Fellini and Bergman. !he first professor, in Sociology. mentiened that cottrses on film would someday be taught on the undergraduate level. Gado found this hard to believe because of his casual acGuaintance with film during his y()uth. Nevertheless, he became inuigued by the unique styles of various directors. As a prelaw undergraduate student. he entered la\W school motivated by his interest in the nature.of law itself. He found law to be consistent and inventive, but the intellectual environment less than stimulating. Upon the advice of the second professor, he applied to several graduate schools in English, having taken only one E11glish course during his undergraduate career. Fellini and Bergman made their best films during the 1960's, however Gado did not see writing . about them for a research project. H.aving been a Professor in English for some time, he maintained his interest in film by aflplying for a Fulbright Award to Sweden. His aim was to learn the language so he would not have to depend on the subtitles of Swedish films. Gado wanted to use film as a link to other forms of contempot:ary and historical fictive art. He received the award, Planfor Sports Complex. W_!!nt to Swedelil, learned the language and married a Swedish woman. lt was only after his trip to Sweden that he decided to pursue his increasing interest in Bergman. It was a bold attempt at ·a subject that had rearely been explored in terms of its place in fictive art. lngmar Bergman views himself as rivaling his mentor playwright, Strindberg. He began his career with an interest in writing and dit:ecting theatre. Bergman proved to be a promising playwright, bttt never became a successful theatre person. Economic necessity joined film and theatre !together. in Sweden. Discovering he could never make it as a playwright, Bergman switched to film directing. America became aware of Bergman through his Cannes Film Festival winner, Smiles of a Summer Night. Most of the original works of lngmar Bergman are not easily accessible. His career spans over 35 years from 1942 to the present. with most of his early works manifested in scripts for plays and the direction of theatre itself. These documents are located in the archives, libraries, and provincial theatres of Sweden where access is difficult. It is hard to get these materials at least once to read and understand. The films in the original language may be viewed only several times during a brief stay in Sweden. Professor Gado's specific interest lies with the passions of Ingmar Bergman. The motifs of Christ and death recur as double threads in practically every one of his films. In reference to the Bergman film, Gado sees comedy as Bergman's return to childhood and the womb. Tragedy. on the other hand, is seen as an individual's movement through time towards the cross and, ultimately, death. Bergman expresses his own self-comtempt and hatred in his films, says Gado. The director emphasizes these feelings by using intellectual characters who never come out looking good in the end.

Leave him alone; go quietly slip away. He needs to be alone, for a while. Adding to the irony of Lou's message, you just can't comply. You gotta listen to it. Somehaw, the record is excrutiatingly attractive. There's a party going on, but somebody's old lady had too much of the wrong stuff, and \you know it's a universial truth, that when someone turns that blue, you know that bitch'll never fuck again.'' Oh well, drag her out in to the street and make it look like a hit and run. Sha Ia Ia Ia, man. This is the best Lou Reed solo album, ever.·· Honest, The blurb on the album at the radio station puts it best: \Lou would hate having his work called street art, but it is.\ That's because Lou is as arty as an empty can of soup. But then, look what Andy Warholdidwith anempty can of soup. Then look what Andy Warhol did to Lou. {He, in effect, started him on his career; for all of you non-Lou Reed fanatics). \Gimme Some Good Times\ begins the set by completely trashing the Rock and Roll Animal image. If the reader is not familiar with Lou's career, it can be summed up by stating that if rock stars were underarms then Lou has tried every brand of deodorant. Some work, others do not. The phases he's been through have left him either redolent of lilac or reeking of wasted sweat. In the song 1 mentioned at the onset of this paragraph (sorry about the slight _ sidetracking), Reed denies the difference between good and evil. This turns out to be a central point in this album/ self- confesion. \Gimme gimme some good times 1 gimme gimme some pain/ no me-tter how ugly . you arejto me they always look the same. •• Here is the essence of his apathy; as even absolute extremes have lost their significance. Sister Ray, a vision out of Reed's past, has ·finally hit her mainline and she doesn't even get high. Then there's \Dirt ... \Dirt was the only word that hurt,\ he! stammers in reference to what might seem to be a heartle~s girlfriend. But if one takes a closer look or listen, it becomes clear that Reed is cursing about himself. Thanks to a close friend who brought up this point in conversation,\ the whole attack falls into place as he wails of his own past career: \You'd eat shit, and say it tasted good if there was some money in it for you.\ He knows he's been dishonest, and now he's making amends by virtually setting himself out on a chopping block with an axe in his own hands. Lou's been screwed by 'em all and they've all screwed him. Now he's ready to chuck it. -· · _ - ' · · \l Wanna Be Black\ is an hysterical exercise in alienation, as he reduces the concept to the ridiculous. No more college boy nonsense. for him; from now on it's gonna \be a panther with a girlfriend named Samantha.\ It _gets funnier, and to elaborate any further would just be stealing his show. \Real Good Time Together .. is the perfect example of what Lou Reed could be if he had no balls. For the main section of the \tune\, Lou takes the old Velvet Underground (his previously mentioned, Andy Warhol inspired, association) classic and feeds it through a bag full of quaaludes to emerge with the result set down on vinyl. At the close, he shows us the enormous commercial potential of the song by implementing the typical guitars, drums and bass to come out nicely polished sound. Whoopdedoo. And that's e~actly what Reed wants you to say. I just listened to \Shooting Star\ again, and the best that 1 can do with it is to make assumptions based on the rest of the record. Someone's either burnt or burning out here; and it could be Lou or it could be his lover. \Leave Me Alone\ is exactly what the title says. It's a restatement of \Gimme Some Good Times\ but with heavier emphasis on the minor parts of that song which deal with total rejection. Someone's this and someone's that, but what use is any of them. The only one who matters in this scene is his homosexual lover, whom witM. he pleads: \Leave me leave me leave me aloaef Love me love me love me boy\. It's another escape route for the· king, or in this case \queen\, of disillqsionment. Those who saw the film Dog Day Afternoon this past weekend would find it logical that Sonny should try to reach Leon with this song. For these characters there is something meaningful out there, but what perverse lengths they must go to get it. \Wait\, by far the most beautiful song as judged from a traditional pop song viewpoint, closes the album with a touch of pure beauty. Behind Reed's intonations of a possible absolution of an inabsolvable relationship, a chorus chants: \Disgrace I Such a pretty face/ It was such a waste.\ All he wanted was to talk it out, but she just wouldn't have it. Now look at the trouble that he's in. The breezy, jazzy riff brings to mind those wonderful \what a day for a daydream\ type numbers,, only this time it's turned into a plain old bad dream .. The title track, \Street Hassle\ stands by itself as being the definitve statement on the life and times of Lou Reed. It was referred to in the opening paragraph, and that apathetic picture comprises the middle section of the piece. lt begins with sex; an act that could . have been for him, and probably was, beautiful. An epic deScription of the act is displayed, as Reed impassionately and rhythmically vocalizes over a 'constant, enveloping refrain clone in three part cello harmony. Guitars, bass, and drums make their way onto the scene ever so softly, and their use could be described as something close to novel the party gone misery becomes the event, and Lou can do nothing . but give it all up to the street. lt's a case of bad luck, as he Would say; and there's nothing much one can do about it. It's natural. Then comes the resounding climax, as even Lou's \boy\ has left him; eaving him moaning \Oh baby, I need a baby.\ Any baby. Little Louise has come home, finally. The drugs, violence and sex have run their course. The melodies are in the air, once more. What comes next only living will tell, and from all signs it's looking good. He's gotta think about things by himself, for a while; so, as they say on the wild side, sha la la la, m.an.

CONCORDIENSIS, Apri/12. 1978 Siletzky Directs by STEPHEN AVALLONE Let's pretend that Alex Shafer and Alice t ufel' are husband and wife. They are. That is, they are pretending. ln fact, we ~ad . a small ceremony of our own 1n the DLT the other ni~ht. With George Siletzky as the -presiding minister, with wedding cake and rice, Alice and Alex were. joined in holy matrimony, till death do they patt. Yes, Agnes and Michael ate on their way to a new and fun-filled friendship. And this is where the play begins, this is where Jan de Hartog introduces us to the escapades of nis two fictitious lovers Agnes and Michael, or more generally to the happy times and sad times of all love affairs. The actors are Alice Tufel and Alex Sha:fer; their director, George Siletzky; the play, Tbe Fourposter, Jan de Hartog's play continues through twenty•five years and six scenes of the ups and downs of one couple's relationship,. but ;he is speaking for all relationships, Can you relate to these? Mix.ed up feelings for someone very dear, jealous fear of the loss of yoU:r lov!!d one or lal!8hing hard together after tears just shed. no you know the apprehension of an unborn child, the problems of parenthood? Maybe yes, maybe no. lf ye~. come and see our show to assure yourself t~t these are age-old problems and that you are not the only one who gets .caught up in them. If no, come to see what you'.re missing or what's in store for you. George Siletzky. a senior who has been with Mountebanks two years, is enthusiastic about the play - he can't wait till opening night. He's so pleased with the script, because, as he says, \ifs a happy play.\ None of these mud- thick plots tbat drag your imagination through a swamp and leave you lying there, but just the simple story of a man and a woman making a go at life together, l~arning and relearning about love and hate and all those tltings th.at you and 1 are all made of. lt's a worthwhile play to see. It won~t leave you sad. It has the seriousness it deserves plus the humor to relax you. You'll leave knowing no more than when you walked in, but with a pleasant feeling inside that lasts. This is George's first shot at directing, and a fine shot it is. Playgoer or not, most students know his acting experience well suits him for the job. Playing lead as \Mac\. in One Flew Over · the Cuckoo's Nest, as Willy Lo~n in Death of a Salesman and just recently portraying Thomas Cromwell in A Man for All Seasons. George steps down off the stage to teach what he's learned. Alex comments on George's keen perception· as a director and how he's able to use it to their advantage. He encourages his actors to step . inside the · characters they are portraying, for only as soon as the actors identify with them, can the audience identify as well. And when the audience can forget that they're really just a crowd of spectators and isolate themselVes alone with the actors, in the actors' world, well, then you know you have a fine . production. And that's just what George is trying to do. No, it's no easy ·task, but a challenge he enjoys. And what of the actors? Achilles Ice Show Though both 'have acted before, neither have yet played as big a role as they are now. That's not to say they aren't good actors, as they have proved otherwise in fhe past. Alice Tufel began with Mountebanks last year as a junior playing Candy Star in Cuckoo's Nest and performed marvelously in And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little earlier this fall. When asked what problems she's having with this show, she simply pointed to Alex and smiled .sweetly. Both she and Alex were chosen as a pair that complemented each other, rather than on separate standing. There were many fine performers who tried out but none that matched up as well as these two do. Senior Alex Shafer, now in his second year on Union's stage, has been seen as Happy in Death of a Salesman and as Master Rich in A Man for All Seasons. Quite a repertoire. He too, like Alice, is learning as much as he can from George and handles himself well on stage. Hopefully this experience will give both of them the incentive to pursue their talents upon graduation, if only just.for the fun of it. \Broadway Ql), lee,\ a first event of its kind, Was a unique performance in figure skating presented on April 7 and 8 by the Achilles Figure Skating Club. Tt?.er perfornu;mce was a sp.ectacular show of skating talent incorporating the advanced as well. as the novice skaters. · During the first half of the show, the audience was flown to Never, Never. Land with Peter Pan. The performance contained highlights of this well-known fairy tale, opening with a stunning s1>lo by Jessica Potts portraying Wendy, followed by equal shows of talent by James Ewing as Peter Pan and Kristin Carman as Tinker Bell. Our visit in Never, Never Land would not have been as exciting had it not been for the younger novice skaters that portrayed the stars of the Milky Way. flowers, the lost children, the Indians of Princess Tiger Lily,, and the pirates of Captain· Hook. Interspersed among these group performances were tlte solos of the advanced skaters includillg Captain Hook and Princess Tiger Lily. lt was not only a successful Performance due to the outstanding skating but tbe costumes added color and character to the performers. The second 'half of the · sho:w consisted primarily <>f the more adva~ced skaters performing to the music from. Br.o.tl~hv~y .l1J~ys ... • •• ..J • \ •• •• including Grease, .Cabaret, My Fait Lady, and others. Again, the costumes were excellent. Featured as. guest stars were Bronze Medal Winners Karen Krivat and Bryan Savino whose performan.ce was simply outstanding. It was evident by the performance that the skaters put in many hours of practice. Debbie Rhodes, one of the professionals of the Achilles Club and a freshman at Union, stated that the floor rehearsals were begun in February and in March the club began practice on the ice. Becky Kershner, wife of .Professor Thomas Kershner and a performer in the Pippin and Salute to George M. Cohen numbers, stated the \Broadway on lee\ was truly a \community effort.\ the perlgrmance would not have been successful at \all if it were not for its volunteers. Mothers of the skaters spent hours designing the colorful and quite uniq1,1e costumes, which began with just the basic black leotard. Not to mention the scenery, lighting, music, make- up; etc., which was all voluntarily done.

The six-foot-high drawing, \Mr Mapelli's Garden No. 3,\ was done about 20 years ago by Bittleman at Cape Ann, Massachusetts, where he and his wife were staying for the summer. The Avnet collection is a group of 180 works by 100 American and European artists formed between 1960 and 1970, the year of Mr. Avnet's death. The collection will be the major spring show on view at the Museum of Modern Art from April 2S through July 4. T!Je · New York Times said the museum describes the collection as \its bigg~st bequest and one of the most important in its history.\ The A vnets had acquired works with the guidance of William S. Lieberman, director of the museum's ·department of drawings. Bittleman, a graduate of Yale University, has been on Union's faculty since 1966. The Museum of Modern Art's collection already contains Bittleman's work, as do the collections of the Whitney Museum, Brooklyn Museum, Fogg Museum, and Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

'~ ' CONCORDl$NSlS, Apri/12, 1978 Nott Memorial.~ Past and Present by David Goss At the center of U nivn's campus stands a deteriorating structure which has been admired by many people - historians, architects, engi~eers, and film-makers, to :name but a few. In 1972 tbis building, Nott Memorial, was placed· on the National Register of Historic Places ;ill recognition of its cultural significance. The National Register contains an official re~or~ of this country's structures which arcworth saving .. For several years now, Nott Memorial has been ill dire need of permanent repairs. Today, two things stand in the way of the restoration of the Nott. One is a lack of intent; the other is a lack of funds. N ott Memorial was initially conceived by the French architect, J. Ramee, who was cvmmissioned in 1812 to design the campus for Union College, the first planned college campus in America .. Ramee's concept of a Roman rotunda as the central building of the campus was never realized. Although ground had been broken in 1813 for this structure, Union failed to raise the amount of funds it had anticipated. so the project was shelved. Forty-five years later, long after Ramee's departure from Union, Edward Tuckerman Potter, Eliphalet Nott's grandson, was appointed the college's new architect by President Nott.

I was an acting student at the Eugene O*NeiU Centre, and l, along with the rest of the students in the National Theatre Institute program had been invited to see the dr~ss rehearsaL of the tour show of The National The~tre of the Deaf. It was entitled The Three Musketeers. \How cute,\ 1 thought. Some deaf people are going to tty and do an .adaptation of the Dumas novel! Well, why not? 1 went more out of vague curiosity than anytbing else. My \How Cute\ attitude went right out the window the moment l stepped into the rehearsal hall: the first man 1 saw was director Joseph Layton,. an Emmy award winning director whose television and Broadway stage credential$ are endless and extremely impressive. \This is the director of a Three Muskateers for the deaf?\ My concept of· deaf theatre was changing rapidly. Mr. Layton was talking to Mr. Fred Voelpel, a designer with a long Broadway career and a series of design assignmtmts with Barbara 'Stteisand to his credit. This was becoming · more interesting by the second. · Sitting at a long ta:ble, 'busily poring· over a mountain of produciion materials, was bavid Hays, founder of the National Theatre, a designer whose credits include the original Broadway designs for Long Days Journey Into Night, The Tenth Man, and Portrait of a Madonna. as well as over 30 New York City Ballet Company ballets for George Balartchine. By the time 1 had taken IllY seat, waiting fot the show to begin, the nature of my curiosity had changed: I was now ~agerly awaiting what l knew was going to be a very special stage event. I was not disappointed.

Here was a rich, novel, and extremely powerful stage experience, one whose surface had only been scratched in the past 10 years. Moreover, it employed a human resource, the deaf community, whose unique voice and. percepti9n has. never really been given a suitable outlet for creative expression. 1 left the O'Neill Centre to return to Union College with a vag.ue cornmittment within myself to explore this kind of theatre at some time in the future. That \some~ime\ came much sooner than 1 had anticipated. · Thanks to the generosity of the Internal Education Fund, the support of Drama Department director Barry Smith,. and the Deaf Community of the Albany- Saratoga Area, 1 have been given an ·opportunity to do a project in this very special kind of theatre. , and the response to the project has already been more positive . and enthusiastic than 1 could have imagined.

The parts are played frighteningly well by Steve Geloso, Andy McNutt,. Linda Klein, A«lam Frey, Tom Casey, Robyn Leith, Lisa DeLuca and ·Randy Klein. It is coinmon knowledge which force is with us here on campus and so the differences in \Dean Wars\ are quite noticeable and It is now possible for Union · students to get credit up to $500. The bank manager of · Community State Bank; Charles Lavine, visited the campus on Tuesday to publicize the offer. In a meeting with Joe . Zolner, Lavine expressed the desire to undertake a project n(lt often . done by hanks - the extending of credit to 18 to 24-year -olds. The program is based on having a checking account with the bank, located across from Mohawk Mall on State Strec;:t, and there having. the option to write a check over your balance up to $500 .. Lavine said that his loan credit program would be strong 'COmpetition for the major . credit cards. Presently, there is an 18 percent interest rate charged by the credit companies while his bank would only levy a 12 percent .interest rate. The process involves a visit to the bank to discuss the terms of the loan. ·a proof of inconte by student (parent .contributions count) and the filing of an application by the student. The student has a 30-day period to start making payments and a 36- month payback period is granted. For example, if .$500 is borrowed, then $.14 must be paid back on a monthly basis. A , statement is sent monthly to the student on his checking account, which also records his loans outstanding. Mr. Lavine stated that there are no quantity quotas and the bank is looking to extend as much .credit as possible either in the form of direct loans or overdrafts on a checking account. Lavine believes that extension of credit to college students, rarely done by most bankets, is a \show of faith\ and that he is trying to demonstrate the community-rriindnedness of his bank\\- The program has existed now for 5 months and all borrowers thus far ha¥e ,, honored the payments. Lavine, due to this success, wants to get the Union campus· involved in this \experiment.\ . Come see the Battle of the Bulge in 211 Davidson ., pleasing. The 'force· is with us, and we all live happily after. The second gem is entitled \Ineffectual Cabaret.\ Though this is a somewhat shorter skit from the show, it is au contrare to its title, quite effectual and I miabt add, to the pOint. The production would have been left as a script to die and rot . i like everything else in 1 Schaffer Ubrary except that it is all brought together by Adam Frey, Dave Marker, Andy McNutt, and the technical staff at WRUC. For any of you politically active or interested people, or, if you just 'wanta,J laugh or three, check out the NottWitts. They've . outdone themselves and undone , the school. l wish l could've said 1 more, however the best way to hear it is to listen - Friday at 7:30p.m. on WR.UC 90.9 FM.

The Dutchmen had every right to enter the game pessimistically. Pots<lam had just n;turned from a training week. in South Catolina, while Union had had very little outdoor practice time. ln addition, Dave Grotz (3B) and · Mark Decker (OF) were missing due to a dislocated finger and a suitcase .party, respectively. However, the outcome wasn't in doubt for too .long. Potsdam touched pitcher Joe Lavery for a. run in the top of the first on a , booming triple and a bleeder through the infield, but Union roared back with a seven run· bottom half of the inning. The first eight batters for the Dutchmen reached base safely, leaving the few chilly specta,tors wondering whether or ··not the inning would ever end. It went like this: pitch he saw for a line single. Second baseman Kevin I:redericks• grounder was thrown away by .the pitcher, ·captain Carm Gatta got an infield single, loading the bases. Chris Masseroni's ha.td grounder then got through the third baseman, sending home two runs. A wild pitch scored Gatta after Trace Anderson had singled him to third. Masseroni was then cut down at the plate on a grounder to short by third baseman John. Terry. Lavery walked; and Ron LeVine cleared the bases with a bases-loaded triple to left center. LeVine later scored on a wild morerun.s. In the fourth, Lavery showed signs of wild~ess, letting up two runs, but once .again Unio!l. exploded, this time for 6 runs in. a rally ignited by. Lavery's triple. By then .Potsdam's: coach had had abo~t enough, so he made a suggestion to call the game after his team had batted in th.e fifth, much to the. delight of everyone present. llowever, he might have reconsidered if he knew what was to follow, A series of walks accounted fot 5 nms before the . side was retired, btit rather than let tJ nion pad their . total again, · the game was mercifuJ!y ended. Dave Adsit stroked the first . pitch to complete the scaring in the first.

Ed Platz Union's Honor Program has been realized with the passage of a resolution by the EPC at the Tuesday, .April 17th meeting. The proposal, \An Honors Center fOF Union College,\ will be submitted to the All~College Senate at its next meetmg. _The new program, The Steinmetz S£bollus Progrqm, is intended \to provide selected Union College students the opportunity to engage in independent study and research, or equivalent creative endeavor, in a setting distinct from the requirements of Departmental or Divisional programs.\ The program will consist of a seminar, a full term of individual or small group study and research or equivalent creative endeavor - normally to begjn in the term following the seminar, and a regular colloquia informal seminars and occasional special programs. The seminar is a prerequisite to the Honors Term. The seminar will be counted as a term course in the Honor's program and will constitute one-third ofa student's program for that term. The Honors Seminar will be offered initially in the Winter Term 1979 · and will have a §mall, limited , enrollment. The seminar will be directed by the \Scholar-in- Residence,\ an academician who will be appointed to direct the student scholarly activities. The seminar itself will emphasize the modes of inquiry in a representative cross-section of the intellectual and artistic disciplines. The Honors Project (a fullterm or 3 course credits) will cansist of students who have successfully completed the Honors seminar. An individual Honors Project EPC Discusses IEF Funding IIY JOHN TYDINGS ihe Educational Policy Committee at its last two meetings has discu&sed the lEf funding. The JEF is constructed of an independent board which is responsible for the allocation of the money. According to the· legislation, IEF was set up as an untouchable fund to be autonomous from all normal budgetary pressures. It was specifically earmarked for ,ed uc:at ional innovation and advancement. lts proponents recognized that the years ahead presented an. immediate challenge for Union. This challenge includes the need for fiscal regularity and for the college to maintain educational growth. It appears as if the responsible bodies are now questioning these principles and feel that because the blldget was not spent, the IEF should be cut back until they can demonstrate a need for the money. This philosophy runs totally contrary to the principles which were the cor.nerstone of the Internal. Education Foundation. The committee has forwarded the following' proposal to the Senate for action at the next meeting. The entire issue of IEF ~:ut\ backs will also he discussed at this weekend's Trustee meetings. Hopefully. these decisions can be reversed and IEF will remain as one of the strong points of the college. !.he hJucatil!nai Pt>licy Cominittc~, having discussed reductions in Internal Education l-und budgeting currently being considered by the Cabinet and the PI an ning and Priori ties Committee, recommends that the Senate pass the resolution proposed below. Res·olved; that current proposals to transfer unspent monies from the Internal Education Fund to the general operating budget for 1977·78 and to reduce appropriations to the Fund foT 1978·79 are College Senate establishing the Fund, since: I. such changes violate an implied commitment to students that funds already appro_priated would be applied solely to educational innovation, ahd since 2. such changes also violate the provision m the enabling legislation which requires that unspent funds be carried over to subsequent yeats, and since 3. such funds are required to expand the Implementation of the freshman .preceptorial program begun on a pilot basis this year, and since 4. funds are also . required fbr implementation of a new honors program just submitted to the Senate for consideration. And it is also resolved that the Seriate regards such reductions in IEF funding with dismay as constituting a backward step in educational policy at Union Coll~e, espectally_ m itght of the College's public announcement of the establishment of the Fund and of the public response to· this announcement. And it is furt-her resolved that the Senate urges budgetary authorities of the College to carry over _current unexpended funds to 1978-79 in compliance with existing-legislation an<! also not to reduce future appropriations to the Internal Education Fund. Housing Announces Lottery The Housing Office has announced across the board increases in dormitory rates that will become effective next year. These new r\1-tes amount ot roughly a $50 increase in the rates for housing~ For next year, all singles, except those in North COop, will cost $1005; in North Coop the charge will be $1085. Davidson and :Fox residents will henceforth be assessed $921,. up from $870. Other raises in dorm prices reflect this $50 increase. The lottery schedule has also been announced. As was the policy for this year, all incoming freshmen will be housed down~ campus m Davidson, Fox. Richmond, South, Web~ter and We~t. According to the Housing Office, though. all dorms will be open to the other cla~scs. I he !otter: will commence on May 2 at 6:00 PM m Stuc.knt Acttvttic~, with the Coop and apartment drawings. Coop groups must consist of 12 members tor Bronner House and 16 for Smith House. The singles lottery will be held on May 7. from 6 to 9 PM in Old Chapel. Selections will be · made May 9 at West Library. Seniors should attend from 6 to 8 PM, Juniors from 8 to. 9 PM and Sophomores from 9 to 10 PM. The doubles and suite lottery and roommates May 15, 6 to 10 PM, at the West College Library. On May 17, Juniors will select rooms and roommates in the same location, as will Sophomores on May 18 from 6 to 10 PM. All students must bring their Union IDs with them to the number drawing and room selection sessions. The Housing Office requests that students' room choices, in order of preference, be d~terminedhefore arrival at the selection session. When one student selects a smte hef.she must have all of the three suitemates in attendance. Room contracts which are signed at the selection session are binding for the three terms of the 1978-79 academic year. Any student who is not currently residing on campus, but who wishes to for the next academic year, must request from the Housing Committee permission to participate in the lottery. These decisions are made on an individual basis, based on available space. . ·'. ··a: .·. >{ may re1lect the major curl:icular interest of the student or an alternate interest outside of the student's major. A center will be established for the program, under the direction of the \Scholar-in-Residence in which a series of regular colloquia, informal seminars, and occasional special programs will be conducted. In addition, the center will cooperate with other groups in the College in providing a forum for appropriate programs. The standards for enrollment in The Steinmetz Scholars Program will be as follows: l) The program will be open to full-time Union College sophomores and juniors in good standing. 2) Admissions to the seminar will be on the basis of an application filed in the term pr,eceding the seminar. Two letters of recommendation will be required. ' 3) Admissions to tile Honors Term (Honors Project) will be based on written proposals setting forth the nature and extent of the project based either in the student's major or a \well conceived project in some -other field which the applicant is adequately prepared to pursue.\ Applications must be approved br the Honors Faculty and, where appropriate, by the student's advisor. 4) Courses taken in the \Steinmetz Center\ will be called Honors Program Courses (H.P.) Departments will have the option of accepting appropriate H.P. work as partiafly fulfilling their major program requirements. Where appropriate, H.P. courses may also be·used to fulfill a part of the student's Liberal Learning requirement. The staffing of The Steinmetz Honors Program will have as its administrative head the Dean of Faculty, a \Scholar·in- Residence\ not necessarily of the Union community who will direct the program, and the ''Center Faculty,\ who will consist of four Union College faculty members, one from each Division of th~,!

. ' Pa(ff! 2 CONCORDlENSIS, Apri/19, 1978 Editorials Outlook On Saturday the 23rd of April, the Board of Trustees will' convene on Carnpus for the annual Spring meeting of the entire board. It was at this meeting a year ago that the turmoil of 1977 broke loose. Amidst discussions. of hockey, athletics in general and· admissions, two resignations were offered although neitller of them accepted. Following that meeting, Dr. Lee Davenport of Stamford Connecticut was appointed to chair a committee to investigate campus controversies of that time. One of the first official acts of that committee was to call for a moratorium on all discussions concerning those controversial issues. This moratorium lasted in excess ofthree weeks. This year's meeting does not deal with issues as obviously explosive as the NESCAC- Division I issue of a year ago but may indeed prove to be just as volatile. This meeting will be the first general meeting under the new Executive Board which was elected in January. The format is basically one in which subcommittees meet during the morning with the entire Board assembling for the afternoon session. Concordy has learned that the Dean Potts issue as well as the problems of the IEF will he .discussed during the meeting of the subcommittee on Academic Affairs and possibly during the afternoon session as well. It has also been implied that the subcommittee on student affairs will deal with the current problems concerning dogs on campus (see page 3 story) in addition to discussing the possible implications resulting from the increased numbers of students cooking in dormitories. Unfortunately, it appears as if the preliminary report of the Campus Review Committee will not be available in time for this meeting. Hopefully, this report will be completed by the end of this academic year so that by the opening of school in September, all of the problems and confusion of recent years will be only memories. Conjecture? The questions surrounding Dean Potts' return to hi~ teaching position in the History Department and his seemingly sudden departure from the Administration have caused many rumors to run rampant throughout the campu:.. Several inferences regarding the situation can be implicitly drawn from Dean Brownlee's letter (see Letters's section) to Concordiensis. It is apparent that both Dean Brownlee and Dean Potts would have enjoyed and profited from another year of mutual endeavor. Dean Brownlee and Dean Potts felt that a further one year contract would be ''desirable.\ It therefore appears to Concordiensis that the problems in deadlines for notification of intent could and should have been resolved in the period between February and March I (the deadline fo.r Dean Potts' notification to the History Department). At a time when many of Union's administrators are leaving voluntarily it seems unlikely that it should be totally unyielding with regard to a person who has served the school so welL An administrative procedure should not preclude the service of an individual who has performed admirably. Because Dean Potts and Dean Brownlee desired Dean Potts' continuation, it seems that only a higher administrative source could have prevented him from remaining in the Dean of Faculty's office. High administration sources have claimed that Potts desired to return to the classroom. Although Dean Potts would enjoy that situation, it seems that he wished to continue in his administrative· role based on his consent to Dean Brownlee to pursue the possibility. . . , It appears that many -of the facts concermng Dean Potts resignation are contradictory. In effect, by not acting upon Dean Brownlee's request before the March deadline, was the \pocket veto\ typical of Union College bureaucracy or was it equivalant to a dismissal of the Dean by a higher administrator? If the later case is true, some strong valid reasoning should be presented, because as Associate Dean of Faculty, David Potts has shown a high )evel of educational integrity. ~1)&11 l/y ~~J(io' {'(( :.S.t;w;~~ ).. • • \U-ntlt!lf 17 :;({ ~l 95 .utrttsts . ?:J'!{~M .. ~1tL~~ -.,.<l'J\.£CTAP\· • Editors-in-Chief ............................... , ........................

When the Internal Education ' Foundation proposal was passed last spring the intent was that \a · structure in the form of a foundation that will insure educational innovation and ; enrichment of the College's programs,\ be established. It was hoped that the program would be exempt from the usual budgetary · procedures in which various groups or individuals go before the Planning and Priorities .Committee to justify their mandatory requests. The lEF · proposal called for 2 percent of · projected total tuition revenue to be allotted to the Foundation each year. ln early March, the Planning and Priorities Committee . presented their budget Adieu recommendations to the cabinet for discussion. In these recommendations to the fundi~g fot lEF was set at the expected 2 percent. The cabinet reviewed the budget proposal and in order to help balance the budiwt, proposed a cut in IEF funding to 1 percent. The P and P committee accepted this with the reconuneildation that the funding be raised .back to 2 percent after next year. 1f the funding of IEF is cut for next year to l percent, the probability of it going up to 2 percent the next year is probably ·small. There are two reasons for this. First, it sh()uld be recognized that the I percent cut would be allocated for other things.

PagJ? 2 CONCORDIENSIS, Apri/19. 1978 Editorials Outlook On Saturday the 23rd of April, the Boa·rd of Trustees will convene on Campus for the annual Spring meeting of the entire board. It was at this meeting a year age that the turmoil of 1977 broke loose. Amidst discussions of hockey, athletics in general and· admissions, two resignations weFe offered although neither of them accepted. Following that meeting, Dr. Lee Davenport of Stamford Connecticut was appointed to chair a committee to investigate campus controversies of that time. One of the first official acts of that committee was to call for a moratorium on all discussions concerning those controversial issues. This moratorium lasted in excess of three weeks. This year's meeting does not deal with issues as obviously explosive as the NESCAC- Division l issue of a year ago but may indeed prove to be just as volatile. This meeting will be the first general meeting under the new Executive Board which was elected in January. The format is basically one in which subcommittees meet during the morning with the entire Board assembling for the afternoon session. Concordy has learned that the Dean Potts issue as well as the problems of the IEF will be discussed during the meeting of the subcommittee on Academic Affairs and possibly during the afternoon session as well. It has also been implied that the subcommittee on student affairs will deal with the current problems concerning dogs on campus (see page 3 story) in addition to discussing the possible implications resulting from the increased numbers of students cooking in dormitories. Unfortunately, it appears as if the preliminary report of the Campus Review Committee will not be available in time for this meeting. Hopefully, this report will be completed by the end of this academic year so that by the opening of school in September, all of the problems and confusion of recent years will be only memories. Conjecture? The questions surrounding Dean Potts' return to his teaching position in the History Department and hi:. seemingly sudden departure from the Administration have caused many rumors to run rampant throughout the campu~. Several inferences regarding the situation can be implicitly drawn from Dean Brownlee's letter (see Letters's section) to Concordiensis. It is apparent that both Dean Brownlee and Dean Potts would have enjoyed and profited from another year of mutual endeavor. Dean Brownlee and Dean Potts felt that a further one year contract would be \desirable.\ It therefore appears to Concordiensis that the problems in deadlines for notification of intent could and should have been resolved in the period between February and March J (the deadline tor Dean Potts' notification to the History Department). At a time when many of Union's administrators are leaving voluntarily it seems unlikely that it should be totally unyielding with regard to a person who has served the school _so well. An administrative procedure should not preclude the service of an individual who has performed admirably. Because Dean Potts and Dean Brownlee desired Dean Potts' continuation, it seems that only a higher administrative source could have prevented him from remaining in the Dean of Faculty's office. High administration sources have claimed that Potts desired to return to the classroom. Although Dean Potts would enjoy that situation, it seems that he wished to continue in his administrative · role based on his consent to Dean Brownlee to pursue the possibility. . . , It appears that rnany of the facts concernmg Dean Potts resignation are contradictory. In effect, by not acting upon Dean Brownlee's request before the March deadline. was the \pocket veto\ typical of Union College bureaucracy or was it equivalant to a dismissal of the Dean by a higher administrator? If the later case is true, some strong valid reasoning should be presented, because as Associate Dean of Faculty, David Potts has shown a high ~eve! of educational integrity. ~OED~~ ~!~t~ ~'\~~~~ O!ntttnr 17 ::.({ ~l 95 ittrnsts ' r-a~~~ J· ~L~:: <')j\N.£er .,.

s e e e I '. . \ . ' '. CONGORDlENSlS, April 19. 1978 Uberolleorning Oistussed 'Jy Andr.ew WisQff On Monday night, several faculty member$ and about two dozen students attended a spirited lntellectua1 Cabaret entitled \Liberal Learning: Political Compromise or Educational SenseT' Dean Potts started the panel discussion by reviewing the pre~ 1966 Distri bu:ti ve Requirement system and the old Comprehensive Education System. Potts. secretary to the Educational Policy Committee, described the Camp Ed System in terms of five. modes, (>t methods of learning. Union's experimental system predated the national trend toward less structured distributive requirements which peaked in the late 1960's. stimulate interest. 3.) The courses enable one to learn the skills that one should acquire from an educational system. Politics did enter tritQ the EPC's final decision, however. For two months; the Science and Engineering Division representatives \filibustered\ in order to separate c(ltegory \F\ (Technology and its Social Applications) froiD category \C'' (Natural Sciences). A rather lengthy , topic of discussion brought the evening to an erid - \watered down\ courses or, if you prefer, \guts.\ AU three panel members seemed' inclined to believe that some course should concentrate on breadth rather than depth. As Professor Lambert said, \our )lurpose is not to make scientists into humanists or vice versa.\ Professor Gado felt that the six categories of the Liberal Learning ·program encouraged wate.red down courses. In one of the last remarks .of the evening, Professor Lambert made the judgment that 4 'the basic choice is up to the students, They must take the responsibility in the long run for the courses .they choose ... nobody will educate you; you must educate yourself.\ lt seemed that the general consensus at the end ·of the two- bout discussion was that the Liberal Learning program is the res·ult of both p,olitical compromise an:d sound educational philosophy, satisfying some of the people SQme ,of the tirne. The new Liberal Learning program, which has also become a leader in a national trend, returns to the fundamentals of the old distributive requirements. One of the major differences, though, \ ... has been the absorption of many unheard of courses in the pre-1966,curiiculum, into the new Liberal Learning program,\ Potts said. This was partially ~ttributed to the innovativertess of the Comp Ed System.. According to Dean Potts, who is also a professor of history of education, \the Liberal Learning program teaches us h<:>w to live in an era of .scarcity as opposed to the abundance of the 1960's.\ Dogs Cause Problems on Campus Speaking on resources, Professor Lambert, an EPC member a.nd past Chairmart of the Camp Ed Board, opened a discussion on the imposition of 1ero sum game by the Trustees. The zew sum game (zero sum budgeting), fosters certain clements of competition between departments, faculty, and course enrollments. All three panel members seemed to be m agreement that some courses would have to maintain ll!rge enrollments (75-150) in order for others to accommodate only 5 or 10 .students. Professor Gado stressed-the undergraduate nature by ANDY ALTMAN As Acting Dean of Students, Rudy V. Nydegger has receiv:ed many complaints regarding the canine situation on campus. So far, complaints have concerned students being bitten (one severely), maltreatment of animais, and \large packs of dogs running loose, creating a potentially dangerous situation.\ While Nydegger realizes that every individual has the right to call the city police with reports of stray dogs, he would prefer to handle the matter internally. Although a number ·Of dog owners on campus are either unaware of College rules or simply choose to ignore them, there are two existing Senate resolutions which are applicable. The first resolution, which was entitled Proposal 89, was passed on June 6, 1964, and comprised eleven articles with respect to pets on campus. These articles are as follows: l. After September l, 1974, each dog on the Union College campus must have an individual owner who will be responsible for its care and res~riction to authorized areas. Stray animals will be removed. 2~ Dogs must be on a leash, maximum length 15 feet, and under the direct and immediate control of the owner and not tied to a stationary object. 3. AU dogs must be licensed in accordance with Schenectady City Law. 4. All members of the campus community, including those living off-campus; wishing tQ use the grounds of the campus for their dogs must ·register each dog with the Court on Traffic and Pets during fall term registration. A $50 deposit will be placed at that time with $15 of it being a .regis- tration fee which will be used to pay for a dog tag and to help defer the cost of a d·og catcher. The remammg $35 will be refunded at the end of the school year if no fines have been levied on the dog -owller. Persons will be asked to show evidence that item 3 above has been satisfied before registration can take place. A clearly distinguishable tag for identification will be issued upon receipt of applicatiQn and fee. This tag must be worn by the dog to which it applies. Dogs brought to Union during the school year must he immediately registered. The term of registration ends at the end of the school year. No unregistered dogs will be allowed on campus. 5. Students may shelter dogs in their rooms provided that roommates give written consent (form to be provided at registration) and that floormates are not disturbed by these. dogs. Dogs must be kept in the room of their owner when 'housed in college residences; dogs may not run loose i·n such buildings: 6. Dogs are not allowed in buildings other than living units. Dogs are strictly prohibited in cooking and dining areas. 7. Owners hold full responsib- ility and liability for all damage and harm caused by their animals; the college assumes ·no liability whatsoever. of Union, it1sisting that professors should not and for the most part do not structure theit courses to • graduate level specificity.

Anyone may run for this 1 year position. 8. Any member of the Union Community may file a complaint with either the Security Office or the Court on Traffic and Pets concerning violations .of any of the above~ The Security Office is responsible for the enforcement of these laws and shall hire a dog catcher who will, together with the Security Force, pick up strays and animals with complaints registered against them and demand identification of the owners who fail to abide by the rules. All names of offenders will be reported to the Security Office by both the dog catcher and the Security Force. An appropriate fine will be administered by the Security Office and this will be in accordance with the violation committed as defined by t.he Court on Traffic and Pets. Minor violations as defined by the Court on Ttaffic and Pets will have a minimum fine of $10 for the first offense and will increase at increments of $10 for every subsequent minor offense .. Major violations as defined by the Court on Traffic and Pets will have a minimum fine of $20 fot the first violation and will increase at increments of $15 for every subsequent major offense. The names of the owners along with the amount of the fine levied by the Security Office will be sent to the Court on Traffic and Pets where it will be put on record and the amount of the fine will be deducted from the remaining $35 deposit. Any student accused with a violation and fined by the Security Office has a right to appeal to the Court on Traffic and Pets within a period of 7 calendar days from the time of notification of a violation. The Court by majority vote can either uphold the fine or may dismiss the fine. Once an individual has accumulated $35 in fines, he or she will be required to remove the dog from the campus for the rest of the academic year. Failure to comply with this rule shall result in the following actions: E d u c a t i o n a l I n n o v at i on Committee, referred to the Coinp Ed System as \a ten-year disaster.

According to Gado, \the Comp Ed Board represented the four divisions, each representative looked .after his own.\ Gado suggested that \rather than try to teach a lowest common denomin-ator to everybody we should try to develop the individual's needs.\ Professor Lambert concurred with Gado and Potts; saying that the C<lmp Ed System \went downhill after the second year.\ Dean Potts defended the Liberal Learning program, saying that \it is not a political patchwork; ·it has a philosophical base.\ It attempts to increase breadth and depth in subj~ct choice since: L) The six categories cut across divisional lines. 2.)

Liberal Learning Discussed ·~y Andrew Wisoff On Monday night, several faculty mem·bers and about two dozen students attended a spirited lntellectua1 Cabaret entitted \Liberal Learning: Political Compromise or Educational sense?\ Dean Potts started the panel discussion by reviewing the pre- 1966 Distributive Requirement System and the old Comprehensive Education System. Potts, secretary to the Educational Policy Committee, described the Comp Ed System in terms of five modes, or methods of learning. Union's experimental system predated the national trend toward less structured distributive requirements which peaked in the late 1960's. stimulate interest. 3.) The courses enable one to learn the skills that one should acquire from an educational system. Politics did enter 1nto the EPC's final decision, however. For two months, the Science and Engineering Division .representatives \filibustered\ in order to separate category .. F. (Technology and its Social Applications) from category ··c\ (Natural Sciences). A rather lengthy topic of discussion brought the evening to an end - \watered down\ courses or, if you prefer, \guts.\ All three panel members seemed inclined to believe that some ceurse should concentrate on breadth rather than depth. As Professor Lambert said, ••our purpose is not to make scient.ists into humanists or vice versa.\ Professor Gado felt that the six categories of the Liberal Learning program .encouraged watered down courses. ln one of the last .remarks of the evening, Professor Lambert made the judgment that •'the basic choice is up to the students. They must take the responsibility in the long run for the courses they choose ... nobody wilt educate you; you must educate yourself.\ It seemed that the general consensus at the end of the two- hour discussion was that the Liberal Learning pr<;>gram is the result of both poHtical comp.romise and sound educational philosophy, satisfying some of the people some of the time~ Ed Platl 1\he new Liberal Learning program, which has also become a leader in a national tFend, returns to the fundamentals. of the old distributive requirements. One of the major differences, though, \ ... has been the absorption of many 1,mheard of courses in the .pre-1966 curriculum, into the new Liberal Learning program,\ Potts said. This was partially attributed to the innovativeness of the Comp Ed System. According to Dean Potts, who is also a professor of history of education, \the Liberal Learning program teaches us how to live in an era of scarcity as opposed to the abundance of the 1960's.\ Dogs Cause Problems on Campus animals; the college assumes ·no liability whatsoever. Speaking on r.esources, Professor Lambert, an EPC member and past Chairman of the Comp Ed Board, opened a discussion on the imposition of ;ero sum game by the Trustees. I\he zero sum game (zero sum budgetin.g), fosters certain elements of competition between departments, faculty, and course enroHments. All three panel members seemed to be m agreement that some ~ourses would have to maintain large enrollments (75-150) in order for others to accommodate only 5 or by ANDY ALTMAN campus must have an individual As Acting Dean of Students, owner who will be responsibte for Rudy V.

Dogs are strictly prohibited in cooking and dining areas. 7. Owners hold full responsib- ility and liability for all damage and harm· caused by their 10 students. Professor Gado stressed-the undergraduate nature of Union, insisting that professors should not and for the most part do not structure their courses to graduate level specificity. Student Elections Set (iado, a member of the EPC and a former member of the Educational Innovation Committee, referred to the Comp Ed System as \a ten-year disaster. They looked so hard at a core curriculum that there was a loss of a sense of purpose. •• According to Gado, ••the Comp Ed Board represented the four div.isions, each representative looked after his own.\ Gado suggested that \rather than try to teach a lowest common denominator to everybody we should try to develop the individual's needs.\ Professor Lambert concurred with Gado and Potts, saying that the Comp Ed System \went downhill after the second year.\ By MURRAY LEVINSON &BOB MORGAN Petitions for elected student government positions will be available starting hiday, April 21, in the Student Activities Office outer lounge.

The foHowing article is a brief bout of deserved publicity for prelaw at Unien written after an informative interview with Professor Joseph Board, prelaw advisor. Professor Board came to Union in 1965 and has been the prelaw advisor ever since. He has a PhD frop1 Indiana University and a law degree from Oxford University. He practiced law for some time before retiring from practice to teach here at Union and at Albany Law School. Prof. Board stressed several things regarding prelaw at Union. The first is that though it is ofte11 mistaken, \there_ is no such thing as a prelaw program or major. There is no common core of courses required by law schools as there is with medical schools,\ and a student can go into law from virtually any major. This, according to Prof. Eoard, is what make prelaw at UQion so outstanding. \Union College has a good reputation for law schools largely because of the kind of training provided by a liberal arts education.\ At a small school, students can be paid more individual attention, have more access to professors, and in addition, the liberal arts education at Union provides each student with the kind of diversified ba~;:kground that many law schools are seeking. Prof. Board attempts to make himself available to all students interested in any sort of f,uture in law or related fields. He finds that he spends an immense Eots ond Honky Tonks By ED CLOOS III apprehension of getting lost.

However, the Forum members wishing student input on this critical matter postponed their debate until next week. The topic of the Mission Statement that wHl be discussed on the .24th is \the future . of athletics at Union College.\ The following is a reiteration of the Forum's senti- ment: \In that the Forum is supposed to be a representative of the student body we would (sincerely) like all possib{e input on the Mission Statement cir- culated around campus.\ The Forum more than cordially invites. the st\ldent body to show its concern for Union's future by attending the next meeting.

Although it is deceiving to discuss prelaw at any school in terms of sheer numbers or percentages, Prof. Board stated that approximately 40 to 50 students apply to law schools from Union each year and that generally, all of the students who apply at a level equal to their achievement, get in. Included in this number are students in the 6- year Union College-Albany Law School program. Presently in its 4th year, this program provides exceptional students a guaranteed admission to Albany Law School after 3 years at Union as long as they m~intain a \high level of achievement.\ (Due in part to the nature of those students accepted to this program, no student has dropped from the program to date.) The curriculum for this program as well as for any student striving for law school is quite unstructured as compared to many other majors requirements (though certain courses are strongly suggested). Though Albany Law School is part of Union University, there is not an inclination for Union students to go to Albany and in fact, Union has sent students to a variety of law schools around the country. \In recent years,\ admist Prof. Board, \there has been an overproduction of lawyers.\ though this does limit the job market, as usual, if one is good enough, there is a job waiting. ln addition, there are many positions in related fields and so, thoug!J:, .. law practices may be hard to come by, there is .wor-t to be found. -With such a good reputatiOn, how is it that prelaw at Union is not so well publicized or known? Simply, Prof. Board is not seeking publicity for prelaw, To those wfio·seek it, it is available, and for those who are unsure, Prof. Board makes himself personally available. If 'making it' in law is what counts, then Prof. Board and Union prelaw have aU the publicity that they .need. So, now the decision is left up to you .. For those interested, Prof. Board has a few tips on getting started. Take the law boards late in your junior year or early in your senior year. Prior to the exams, read, seek demanding professors that will make the transition to law school easier, and be encouraged to get in touch with Prof. Board anytime. Wherever you are now, prelaw at Union has much to offer. .~

Many of you out here in reader land have probably heard at one time or another the song \Mr. Bojangles;\ but few of you have had your frame of reference graced with the .knowledge of Jerry Jeff Walker. Mr. Walker is a prime proponent of the surging Texas rock scene; and is highly respected in the circles to which he addresses h.imself. His most recent album, A Man Must Carry On, provides the listening audience with a wide range of Jerry Jeff musical pursuits. It is a most pleasurable album; as he mov~s from rip-the-rocks-out-of- your-rear rock and wll to gentle love ballads to his wife and .. to ~very Colorado girl who looks like she just got off 3 weeks of K.P.\ and then proceeded to charm the · audience with a selection of new and old numbers alike.

Co11edion ·on loan The Herman and Rose Burns Print Collection is now on exhibit at the Schenectady Museum. On loan to the college by Felice and Trustee Arnold Burns '50, this collection will remain on view through April 28. Among· the works included: Joseph Albers' embossed linear constructions, made by pressing the wet .paper into a grooved metal plate they reflect the striving for pure formal language ·of art that grew popular· in the 1920's under the Bal!:haus school. Frank Stella~s series of polygonal designs also reflect a constructivist mode, and are dedicated to a nu!llber of the artisfs fr.iends and associates in the art wmld in the late 1950's- and early 1960's. The abstract expressionist school of painting of the 1950's influellced.. t·he prints by Sam Francis and ,Robert Motherwell. The colors in the Francis print _ were laid down with a controlled splatter technique similar to that pioneered by Jackson Pollock. The lines traced in the Motherwell convey the same kind of spontaneous but not random gesture. Ron Davis' two highly colored prints are combinations of constructivist geometric shapes and rich abstract expressionist coloring. After the development of abstract art in the 20th Century, artists who continued to use figures no longer sought to depict visual reality with the same straightforward literalness that had been the aid of art since the Renaissance. On Thursday, April 20, 7:00 p.m. at ARTS 202;. Edward Fry, the Kenan Professor of Art History at Colgate University and Union College Jaffee Lecturer, will discuss the Burns Collection in a slide presentation, ''Contemporary Prints: New Directions for Avant Garde.\ A reception for Professor Fry will follow the Lecture. All are invited to attend. Jerry Jeff was raised in Oneonta which is surprising in lieu of the infrequency of actual references to sex. 1 guess everybody isn't as happy as they are built up to be. Regardless of his activities; Walker left the town in his early youth to search the land for that ultimate rodeo and found it eventually in Luckenbach, Tex.as. There, he and his cohorts, The Lost Gonzo Band, began producing sounds and records; and winning friends to howl with. Jane Wilson, a teacher of Speech and Drama, has had much of her poetry published and broadcasted, including one radio play performed. She is currently touring the United States, giving poetry readings at several colleges. She will be reading poems from her book Ringing the Migrants, published last May. Miners: Life in Darkness The town itself, under the mayorship {and actual ownership) of the late Mr. Hondo Crouch, has developed into a cultural hotspot and a thriving tourist attraction. What Washington, D.C. is to politicians is what Luckenbach is to country rock mus1c1ans. Austin is another thriving music center; and the analogy can be stretched into be-naming Austin the Potomac river .of country music. That may be pushing it; but for the pUrposes of this article it will have to suffice. Getting back to out original topic: Jerry Jeff Walker deserves to make a major breakthrough in popular music. He has \paid his dues\ so to speak; and has worked his art to a state of near perfection. His rickly toned voice hardly ever misses a note, and if he should then it almost sounds as if it was meant to be that way. He has taken a leave of the Lost Gonzos, and has formed a new band which has a fresh, nubile sound to it. That band was the one featured at his concert in New York City this past fall - a concert which was well appveciated by all who indulged. A sense of the artistic was pursued as he dished out his \standards\ (•'Mr. Bojangles,\ \Up Against the Wall, Redneck Mother,\ and \L.A. Freeway.\) Jane Wilson's poems are about people, those she has known, grown with and loved. Th~y are based on a wide range of experiences, including a period in which she counselled delinquent children. One senses in her poetry the belief that children are aware of much that the adult has yet to learn. Living in England, there is much of the sea in Wilson's poetry, both in images and rhythms. In a poem entitled \Flamingoes\ for example, she says, \Wings are the night, and armpits are exposed/to flare the. runways of their s.eas.\ Many of these poems describe sufferance, and Jane Wilson has said, \I cannot imagine a world without suffering. It appears to be part of the balance of opposites which makes the pattern. The terrible inevitability creates compassion. The universality· of suffering transcends time and space.\ At times there is a subtle humor in Wilson's poetry which creates an easy entrance into a poem, as exhibited in this excerpt from \I Go for Napoleons\: I go for Napoleons, for small men with chips on their shoulders, which they take the opportunity to carve beautifully, like Alpinists in a bad winter; Who . are working out their Thing in attics, who need he\ping; who command absolutely , battalions in piazzas; who take siK in suede, so In Our Blood: coal miners in the 70s is the theme for a series of films and lectures to be given J:ues,day, April 25 through Monday, May 1. Currently on exhibition in the Schenectady Museum are superb photographs taken by Earl Dotter. As the photographer for the United Mine Workers Journal, Earl Dotter has had the unique opportunity of recording life on the job and in tfie community of the American coal miner. His photography emphasizes the dignity, skills and satisfactions of the miners' work as well as its .dangerous and dehumanizing features. Presently massive amounts of m,oney are being spent in the drive for energy self-sufficiency. But few dollars are earmarked for solving the crucial problems that the men and women who mine coal face. Today one miner is killed every other day, and one is injured every 10 minutes. Anyone lucky enough to beat those odds has a 3 out of 4 chance of spending retirement suffering from black lung disease. It is not a crucially important time to introduce American coal miners to America, to show their significant contribution, .their problems and that they are · also m.embers of the family of man.

Feiffer utilizes all three definitions of the word ''cartoon\ in his play \Feiffer's~ People,\ which will .open Wednesday, April' 26 in the Nott Memorial' Theater. Fieffer's play is made of senenty-s.ome preliminary sketches (definition # l) in the form of short scenes, vignettes, and monologues. These are sketches. .in that they suggest much more than what is actually performed on ·stage. These. sketches are intended as humor, caricatures of the contemporary Arnerican public, artd satire of their lives, perceptions, and · beliefs in this society (definition #2 is fulfilled). Thirdly, and nof.at all least, most of tbe sketches in \Feiffer's People\ are taken from Jules Feiffer's renowned COMIC SI'RIP, nationally syndicated, and appearing in all kinds of newspapers from The Village V!)ice to The Berkshire Eagle (see definition #3). the seventy-some sketches in \Feifft;r's People\ are played by eight actors and actresses, all of whom must be able to switch from one of five to ten character types to another in the time it takes for the lights to go out and on. The Players are Jon Clark, Mary Mattimore, Sharon Rubin, Chris Chalifoux, Roger Summer- hayes, Becky White, Tom Farrell, and Ellen Lichtig. Beca,use each player has so l,'llany parts, it is impossible to discuss each cnaracter development, but all the players show an atl)azi~g agility to become a cqmpletely new character in a split second. Roger SumiJlerhayes. captures the Arperican male youth who is an e:xpert at getting it on with the \today .. female; he plays off the audience as Larry Charm whose , absurd· reasonmg~ for leaving the movies for politics end up not soundly half so ridiCulous as the political structure. He also commands the characters of a businessman complaining about the fuss over white-collar crime, an army captain, and many more. Becky White satires the catty bigoted sorority sister, the nice- folksy~mid•sixties felk singer, the patriotic mother whose · strong patriotism stems from a fear of the government, and, again, many other types. Chris Chalifoux is sad as a Superman sapped of strength by a .. realistic\ society, is confused as a male who likes certain liberations of woman but not all; he's an army lieutenant, a guest on \I was only doing my je>b'' Show .... Mary Mattimore is the potentially intelligent and intellectual. woman whose well- Spoken words become stupid with bigotry, she is the new woman who has thrown away the double standard but will feel guilty, she is the partner in a T.V. marriage and the mother of a daughter raised on T.V., the soon-to•be- pregnant woman who has finally discovered why it is right to bring a child into this world ... Jon Clark plays the spectrum from a guy, who for all his endeavors still respects. girb, to a . young rebel gone instant capital- istic success - from a. man convincing his clinging girlfriend of the virtues of independence to an American rebellious youth who can't visualize how to retain his idealism when he is old, around 25 or so ... Sharon Rubin ranges from the castr~ting female whQ feels her husband should be open-minded enough to accept her delineations: of her greater success, to a young girl sleeping and eating at home and very proud of her independence, from a would-be mugging victim who attempts to reason and talk her mugger oQt of Area Concerts· Spring term at Union is great and so is soll?-e of the music that can be heard around this area.

Ellen Lichtig's character switches ·include a pregnant woman whose idealistic ami philosophic reasons against hav- ing· children are suddenly and mundanely negated, a woman who's never had a chance to become any of the things she would really like to be, whose opportunity once more gets squashed, not to forget her very funny-sad dancer whose every attempt to ''express\ gets thwarted by the leakage of truth into her art ... \Feiffer's People\ is not a play to be missed; in fact you might want to go early in the week so you can see it again. The agility and variety in the acting is incredible, as well as the timing of lights and music. The music is improvisational jazz which will be performed nightly by Barb Fraser, Karl Thorkildsen, and Paul Matts, a.nd which ~dds another very fine .dimension to Feiffer's flat newspaper cartoons becoming three-dimensional on stage. Bill Pike's direction of .seventy-some scenes is aided by Ellen Berger, Stage Manager, and Chip Baker, Assistant Stage Manager. Lighting is designed by Jim MacConcy. Tickets for Union College students are 75¢ weeknights, and $1 weekends. Here are the winners of this year's Academy of American Poets contest on campus. First prize went to Jody Green for \The Attic Rocker\ and honorable mentions when to Terri Cohen for \Street .. and to Delanne Stageman for \Battle.\ THE ATTIC ROCKER That first winter here, 1 Watched you in your old rocking chair, you tried to push thread through the eye of a needle to make wool sized to one granddaughter fit another your hands remernbering folded rough plaids of one daughter's dress becoming the ,other's skirt Your hands became strangers (an unfinished skirt hangs in the back of my closet) and you compensated in your rocking, rocking ·faster, it was your sprint-lap and all else quickened more potatoes peeled, apples sliced with your head tilted down to lower your wind resistance, . ·you inspected the foreign workings of your fingers and rocked. It has been ten years now since l ran up to the attic to call out to you, tert years and I often _dream that the attic is your home - you are alive there; rocking and you shush me 'your living there is some secret and after my last dream of you 1 went up to the attic finding your rocker in the midst. of my mother's reupholstering, her attempt to sew fresh cloth on the worn frame. When she finishes she will give it to my sister who will soon rock my mother's first grandchild and then I will bring another chair up to the attic - the winner of the rocking sprint sheuld not have to sit on the floor. JODY GREEN STREET Children only carry pleasure in their hands: sticks and dandelions, ·insects and bottlecaps, things they can let go and forget, easily. The old man walks in the street beside the traffic, carrying in his right hand a flag, folded, the stripes of red and white visible to the drivers. He hurries on. The woman stepping quickly on the sidewalk bends her head down, and presses a loaf of bread under her arm. When mus_t the child carry for the first time, the flag he cannot drop; the loaf of bread which must be hurried home for dinner?. TERRI COHEN BATTLE on sunny days we'd see the old man out there, gaunt and bent, kneeling on the weedy lawn, brown-gray peach basket at his side, the same .cplor as his trousers. hot and bright the sun would shine and the ragged green surface of the ground was specked with sma:ll suns, . and dandelions. his effort drove the old, worn knife-blade into the earth, seeking dandelions' roots hidden in the dark underground. ,,. a littJe effort was enough, or too much. coughing, he would retire from fhe dandelion battle for that day. but he would be back another day · to renew the engagement against the hated dandelioa.s and brother weeds. I the job was never done. (dandelions grow faster than knife can hoae' their roots.) the old man died last spring. I remember how we stood murmuring in his front yard·, after the funeral - and the dandelions smiled up at us.

: ., . CONCORDIENSIS, Apri/19, 1978 Dogs Continued lassifiebs Continued from Page .3 10. Dogs caught on campus belonging to residents of Schenectady will be picked up by the dog catcher and taken to the pound. The owner shall then ·be subject to prosecution in accordance with the Schenectady City laws applicable to stray dogs. The college should make this policy known to the residents of Schenectady. II. This Proposal shall suspend the effect of Proposal 61 (Meeting of Aprill2, 1973) for the fall term 1974-75. The Dean of Students shall submit to the College Senate prior to the last meeting of the fall term 1974-75 a report on the effect this proposal has had in controlling dogs on the campus, and at its last meeting of the fall term 1·974-75 the College Senate shall consider the continuation of tile su&pension of Proposal 61. The second resolution was entitled Proposal 90 and was ,passed by the Senate on November 7, 1974. Under Proposal 90, the Dean of Students has .responsibility to enforce all regulations dealing with pets. the Dean of Students is also authorized to change the regulations in whatever manner he deems necessary. Dean Nydegger feels that some kind of action must be taken now. lie has stated that he would \prefer to see if we cannot make the regulations work before doing anything as drastic as banning all .pets.\ It seems apparent, however, that the only way in which these regulations can work is if everyone involved does his or her part to see that the regulations are followed and enforced.

CONCORDIENSiS, Aprill9, 1978 ISC Lobbies, for Students By TONY BENIGNO Do you want a higher TAP grant? Do yotJ need assistance in dealing with the New York State Higher Education Corpor.l!.tion? Would you like a voice. in Albany and Washington working to acquire benefits fer the private sector of higher education? The Independent Student Coalition (ISC} was conceived to deal with these and other problems faced by students in the independent, private, sector of higher ed11cation. ISC represents the 109 private Colleges and Universities in New York State. Presently, fo.rty-five such institutions, including Union, belong to and donate a nominal fee to fUnd ISC. Seven other institutions are active., bUt do not centribute any funds to ISC. In its brief two-year history, ISC has gained many benefits for students in the private sector. Through its-tobhying efforts, the ISC helped persuade New York Legislators to increase TAP by $300 for all freshman in the 1'977 .. 1978 academic year; this increase will be phased-in by one academic class pe.- year so that by 1980- 1.981 all independent sector students will have received the mcrease. Also, the maximum mcome e'ligjbility for the maximum TAP. award was increased from $2;000 to $2750; what this means. is that every studen•t recetvmg TAP in September 1978 will receive an additional $45. While lSC has helped !)tudents in a variety of oth~:r ways, these financial increases are quite important to those students in out sector Who cannot afford the high cost of a priva¢e education. delays awards, sometimes as much as nine i:nonths. Students rely on their awards to pay tuition costs. When the a ward does not come in time, many are forced to take and. pay interest on an unnecessary loan. If any Union students have experienced such problems, please feel free to call ISC for assistance, the numper is 436-7659. Ullman Awarded Contract Besides lobbying in Albany, ISC has a sister .. organization in Washington called COPUS. COPUS focuses on Federal legislation concerning private Colleges and Univetsities. lt successfully lobbied for an increase in Federal Scholarship Aid and the continuation of the National Dire~t Stud~nt Loan Along with increasing financial aid and working through the Higher Education bureaucracy, lSC provid·es a unique educational opportunity for anyone interested in politics. While Union provides legislative internships in Washington and Albany, it does not offer any with either special interest groups or the bureaucracy. ISC has internships available which allow the political scientist to observe politics from an entirely new and exciting perspective. Since (SC's staff consists ·Of only the Director of Operations and. Executive Director ·of Extemal Affairs, the student intern i·s given considerable responsibility. by ANDY OELBAUM The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded David Ullman, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Union College, a twenty-five thousand dollar contract to study and develop a variable ine·rtia flywheel. The one-year contract was awarded to Ullman by Sandia Laboratories of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a purchasing affiliate of the U.S. Department of Energy. Ullman has been studying the . variable inertia flywheel since he was a graduate student at Ohio State University. His agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy to study this type of flywheel makes him the only scientist outside the U.S.S.R. under contract to study its potential use~. The primary use of the variable inertia fly\'heel v.ill be in automobiles. Professor Ullman feeb that it can be used to decrease the amount of energy • • • I I Q .... and gasoline that an automobile wastes when not accelerating at a peak potential. According to Ullman, the use of just a flywheel in automobiles without any other device to recharge it is unlikely because it would not be practical. The development of the flywheel is important because it could significantly simplify automobile transmission systems. The usefulness of the variable inertia flywheel lies in its ability to maintain - or even inerease its speed as it loses energy . Maintenance of a constant spe~d is accomplished by changing the distribution of mass as it is brought into a more compact area around the axis.- The first known use of the flywheel as an energy storage device dates back at least to 3000 B.C., in the form of the pottery wheel. In the 1860's, it was used experimentally in torpedoes, and only recently has been examined for potential use in cars and buses.

Cornell University Summer Session, 111 Day Hall·, Ithaca, New York 14853 In the early l9SQ's, flywheel buses were in use for several years in Germany, Switzerland, and the 8elgian Cong0. At every half mile along its route,. each bus would slop, and an internal motor would be plugged into a stationary electrical outlet. After generating the flywheel up to speed, the motor would be disc.onnected, and the bus wotJld proceed for another half mile. program. Aside from legislative issues, lSC pwvides a valuable service to students by checking with the Higher Education Services Corporation as to the status of student awards. Through direct visits to the \Cmporation\, ISC helps student:> cut through the bureaucratic \red-tape\ that often A worthwhile organization is emerging in Downtown Albany.

This will: be Smith's first public. appearance since he was fited last fall after relea~ing a controversial letter highly critical ·of President Bonner's administrative practices.

In the feats of strength of the field events, ·union will have Doug Koch and Ed Kulick putting. the shot. Dave Cozzens and Cliff Rogers will be in the high jump, Jim Zalucki will vault again, and Earl Chilton will head the long jump and triple jump events. Union will also compete in the difficult outdoor events such as the discus. the hammer throw and the javelin throw. Umgman, Lee Parrish and Jason Deutschrneister. In the 440 yard event Matt Guilfoyle and Da,n Floumenhaft will compete, while Pete Vidkind and Dave Rohwasser will run in the half mile. Brian Liss will run in the long distance events (one-mile and three-mile) while Jack Conner will compete exclusively in the grueling three~mile event. Hurdlers include Mark Nazzon,. Matt Blum, Andy Barber and Phil Stegman. It is the running events where Union is the strongest and is a leader in their league. In the 100 and 220 yard dashes the Dutchmen have Matt Blum, Ed 01 course, one. cannot forget the two captains of the Union track team, who wilt again display their talents of effortless strides and consistent winning. Kevin Scheuer is always the man to beat in the 880-yard and mile events. Bob Moffat, it seems, can easily win any event in which he competes.

CONCORDIENSJS, Apri/19, 1978 eporte Lacrosse Moves Into High Gear The Union Iacross e team, led by senior co-captains Ray Stecker and Andy Brooks, evened its record last week by defeating Siena 19-11.

The game was controlled by the Dutchmen from start to finish.

Other scorers Stu Napear, Ray Stecker, and Brian Walck each had two goals apiece. Hard-Hitting Dutchmen Up and Down In their next match, the Dutchmen sought revenge as they swamped Hartwick 20-J. Senior Stu Napear led all scorers with four goals and five assists. on the defensive end, Senior Ken Beck played a stingy net which limited Hartwick to just three goals. Containing the opposition alongside Beck were Senior Pete Carmen and Sophomore Rob Fishman ... After the Hartwick match, Union faced its toughest contest so far as they traveled north to confront the Larries of St. Lawrence. Last year the St. Lawrence-Union .game was wild, with the Larries winning 11-10. This time the game was no different. Even the result was basically the same. St. Lawrence won again, this time 14-10. · Union's fourth game of the season was played last Saturday at Siena College. Again Jed Kanner led the scorers, this time by TOM BUIOCCIII The Union baseball team was up and down last week as the Dutchmen split four games with their opposition to bring tlteir record to 3-2. Last Wednesday, the Garnet held on to defeat Clarkson 11-8. On Saturday they split a doubleheader with Norwich, and on Monday, they dropped a 5-0 decision to Albany State. In the Clarkson game, Union acquired a big lead which it almost managed to squander; Clarkson touched starting pitcher Mike Hogan for two runs in tile top of the second on a walk, d()uble, stolen base, and a sacrifice fly. However, Union wasted little time in piling up a few ru11s of their own. In ti:J.e bottom of the third, Dave A.dsit reached first on an error and promptly stole second. Kevin Fredericks walked, and both ru.nners were moved up on Carm Gatta's perfect sacrifice bunt down third. Trace Anderson responded with a 2 RBI single, then proceeded to steal second and score on Jack Terry's base hit. Terry later scored to make it 4-2, but Clarkson managed to get the side out with the bases loaded. The Dutchmen added 4 more in the fourth as Kevin Fredericks (who reached base 5 times!) began the rally by drawing a base on balls. Gatta, Chris Masseroni, and Anderson then ripped a double and two triples, respectively, sending Clarkson's starter to the bench. Joe Lavery's sacrifice fly plated Anderson to make it 8-2. The fifth inning saw Clarkson score once and Union twice, and at 10-3, the Dutchmen seemed to be on their way to an easy victory. Hogan, although throwing a lot of pitches, was keeping Clarkson pretty much in check~ In the sixth, though, things began to change. Hogan began to tire, and left the game with 2 outs Softball Opens Up Jiy CATiiY REALS The women's varsity softball team has gotten off to a slow start this past week by dropping two at home. Team spirit remains high as everyone is certain that the potential is present for winning. On Saturday, Adirondack C.C. came to Daley field to leave victorious, 17-6. The weather was far from cooperative as a 20 mph wind raged bringing several snow squalls · temporarily suspending play. Jill Henry went the distance for Union facing 38 batters. lt appeared that the strategy of Adirondack was not to swing at any pitched ball. The hat grip was poor due to the cold and wet weather. As a result, 9 Adirondack players walked. Union came up swinging with Deb Schwartz leading with 3 singles and 2 stolen bases. Having 1 hits each in the game were U mon's Dot Scarpinato, Judy Driscoll, Debbie Downey, Diana Gazzola, and Gwen Young. Leading Adirondack was Hugadorn with 2 singles and a double. Cunningham got the win for Adirondack. Tuesday afternoon on sunny Alexander field, the State U nivetsity of Albany team defeated the Union women, 13-4. Jill Henry started as pitcher for Union but was replaced ~y Liz Yager in the second. A combination of consistant SUNY hitting, several costly . Union errors, and 10 walks granted by the Union pitchers were the major reasons for the loss. The. game provided plenty of excitement as both Dot Scarpinata (cf) and Sbeila O'Donnell {rf) threw SUNY players ()Ut at the plate. Union successfully caught another player in a run down between first and second. Deb Schwartz Jed tbe Union battinl!: with 3 singles. Judy Driscoll was 2 for 4. All Union women played in either the field or at bat. For Albany State, DeVito and Harig each were 3 for 4. Sapro was the winning pitcher. Thanks to all of the great Union fans that attended both games. Hope to see all of you on Thursday as Union meets the College of St. Rose at 3 on Alexander Field. Saturday, April 22, the women will travel to Siena for a 1:30 game. Junior Alan Greenberg, who \will be nafionallr ranked this year,\ according to rookie coach Kqyser. • and the bases loaded in favor of sophomore Dave Chussed. Chussed, used very sparingly last season, made his debl!t this year a . success as he snuck a law fast ball by for a called third strike to put the fire out. Union added one more in the sixth as Carm Gatta's sacrifice fly · scored designated hitter Rich Romer with their final run. From then on it was a question of whether or not Clarkson would run out of time. Chussed, like Hogan, .began to lose the plate. (Garnet hurlers issued a combined. 12 walks.) Clarkson scored 3 in the sixth, 2 . in the seventh, and left the bases full in 3 of the last four innings. However, Chussed got Clarkson's cleanup hitter to bounce to Terry with the bases full to end the. game at I 1-8. On Saturday, it was Union who had to play catch up in the first game vs. Norwich. Five walks and 3 hits produced half a dozen runs for the visitors in the top of the first, and they extended their lead to 9-0 in the third. _ The Dutchmen began to charge back in the ,third. Dennis Gazzola, Adsit, and Fredericks stroked consecutive hits, and after Carm Gatta drove in a run with a fielder's choice, Jack Terry drilled a shot over the 345 foot sign in l~ft center to cut the deficit to 9-5. Union southpaw Joe Lavery had settled down since the third, but Norwich still managed 6 more runs on 2 more walks, seven hits, and 5 errors. Their 15 runs made the game seem out of reach, but Union's 6-run fifth inning closed the gap~ However, they went down in order in the sixth and seventh, making the final 15-1 I in a game marred by 10 errors and considerable raggedness. Dave Chussed made his first start ever in the second half of the twin bill and turned in Union's best pitching performance of the year~ Although he gave up 6 runs, he was consistent throughout and in control all the way. On the offensive end, Union was its usual run-productive self, as the Dutchmen racked up more than 10 runs for the fourth time in a row. Kevin Fredericks virtually stole a run in the first via a remarkable sole effort. He struck out, but advanced to first on a dropped third strike. He advanced to second oh a passed ball, alertly stole third and scored on a wild pitch. U ilion erupted for a characteristic five run third inning as a double by Adsit and walks to Fredericks and Terry loaded the bases. D H Chris Masseroni singled a home run, and an error on Trace Anderson's grounder brought home another. Terry ripped an RBI single, and Joe Lavery ended the scoring by crushing a triple to right center. The Dutchmen clinched the game in the fifth by banging home another 6 runs as a couple of new faces helped the rally along. Two walks followed by Anderson's single loaded the bases, and Jack Terry sent home 2 runs with yet another clutch it. Lavery's fly · out scored Anderson, but the rally hadn't died yet. Freshman second baseman Steve Goll reached on an error, stole second, and scored ~ong with Terry on Damien Quinn's first hit, a 2 RBI single. Quinn later scored on an error, and Chussed coasted through the final 1 innings to make the final Union 12 Norwich 6. On Monday, Union's bats were thoroughly silenced by Albany State righty Dan . Dey. Dey struek out nine, walked only two, and scattered 7 hits. Only Adsit (4 hits), Lavery (2[;- and Fredericks (1) could solve Dey's tricky off speed pitches. Mike Hogan pitched well in defeat, limiting the opposition to a season low 5. tuns, but Dey was the big story in the 5-0 Albany victory. Union continues its busy schedule this week. In a late report, the Dutchmen dropped a 7-2 decision to RPI yesterday with details unavailable at press time. Today the Dutchmen travel to Middlebury, then entertain Williams at 3:00 on Friday. On Monday and Wednesday of next week, Union hosts Siena and travels to Colgate. It will be a tough grind, but if' the hitting returns and the pitching continues to improve, the Garnet should make a good showing. LINE.

:1 i i y Founiled at Union College 1877 SCH~CTADY:, N. Y., Wednesday,April26, 1978 No.21 Aid For Handicapped AIJ-College_ Senate in session. by JIM DAVIS To comply with a request by the federal government, Jack Litynsld Union's Director of ~hysical Planning, has prepared a ·transition plan for making the college's facilities accessible to the physically handicapped. '\It's only a plan, \ Mr. Litynski said. \Nothing is definite. This isn't a construction proposal. An part of the plan can still be revised by the government.\ Mr. Litynski estimates that the improvements he's outlining will cost a minimum of $345,000. Union's Board of Trustees received a copy of the transttlon plan at their interim meeting last Saturday. They will make their decision on the feas1bility of funding this project in the next few weeks. '\These improvements are. necessary,\ M·r. Litynski said. \But for a college like Union they represent a major ex.pense. That's going to affect the board's decision.\· Senate Discusses Vital Issues Study for the transition plan began last November, on the request of Union\s president, Thomas N. Bonner. He was asked to initiate an investigation into the construction of facilities for the handicapped in June 1977, in accordance with a provision of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that required all colleges to have been requested to begin such a study by June 30, The Yom Kippur holiday, lEF Funding, and the Honors Program dominated discussion at this week's meeting of the All College Senate held on Tuesday in the Old Chapel. As a result of the Senate's Action, Yom Kippur will not be a day of scheduled classes, the IEF Funding will be recommended to be maintained at 2 percent of tuition, and the Honors program will be investigated iii more detail. A proposal introduced by Jeff Scheininger was passed with slight modification. It states \There shall be no scheduled classes on Wednesday, October ll, 1978. F acuity members may provide for a make-up of any of these missed classes which are deemed essential.\ The rationale for the action wa::; rooted in a precedent established in 1974 and 1977, and upon considera~ions for Jewish students. Incoming Jewish freshmen are faced with a difficult adjustment problem when classes are held on the holiday; furthermore most Jewish students ar.e involved in synagogue service and religious custom. The proposal was opposed by Division Ill which, through Professor Sutter, introduced a substitute porposal which stated that classes would be rescheduled at the instructor's discretion which would not necessarily mean that classes would be cancelled. This consideration was based on the problems involved in cancelling a day of laboratory. The substitute porposat introduced by Sutter was voted down and the original proposal was passed wit-h Divisions 11I and IV in opposition. Professor Schick indicated that there was a need for the development of a program for holidays. The Senate passed a resolution recommending that the Planning and Priorities Committee on campus and Budget and Audit Committe of the Board of Trustees maintain the funding of ltF at 2 percent of the tuition funds. Theresolutioncomes in the wake of the current confusion over IEF Funding. The Board of Trustees indicated over the weekend, at their April meeting, that because the lEF Funds are actually part of the operating budget, surplus f1,1nds cannot be carried over from one fiscal year to the next. Because of this consideration, the lEF is currently involved in budgetary allocations and is competing with other campus needs. President Bonner indicated that although tl}s: Board of Trustees had a;p}?roved thr ''bro~d concept of lEF; tltey · We~e 'nQt :!\ware of the precise ·enabling l¢gislation; ~fter this· weekend's · meeting, the Board of Trustees returned the Budget to the campus and indicated that of the 300,000 dollars in the incremental budget for next year, consideration should be made for dormitory Fire Protection ($30 ,000), Achilles RINK Maintenance ($50,000), an·d campti'S maintenance ($50,000). With these and other requests, 'the need to prepare a Mlroii¢ed budget may place a strafiir~Ii~~­ IEF Budget · according· ·.to.~~,:·H~e President. .. .. ~ One td·lEPs t,miqueness and educational value many Senate members felt that funding should be maintained. Professor Wilson was curious to know why funds cannot be carried from year to year and why the Senate was not notified of this .at an earlier date. Professor Hartwig, of Planning and Priorities, indicared · that funding confusion occurred because of several recent errors and because those directly involved, namely the former Provost and Comptroller, were no longer available. He went on to say that a lack of communication between Educational Policy Committee and Planning and Priorities was involved in the cl:lange of IEF fqnding; . had Planning and Priorities 1\nown of the proposed Honors program, other considerations would have · been taken. According to Hartwig, the Continued on- Page 9 Trustees Meet on Campus The Board of Trustees met on campus this past weekend for their April meeting. The Board ordered the completion of the centralized fire detection system begun in the fall of this academic year. The aim of the \Anunciator System\. is to connect every building on camp1,1s used for housing with a central det~ction panel in Secmity. The Board be- lieves that the complete installa- tion of such a aystem will ensure a greater measure of safety on campus since fires will be reported wjth greater speed to the Schenectady Fire Department. Subsequent to this weekend's meeting, Chairman of the Board, Richard Day released a statement concerning the Review Committee. According to this statement, the Committee's Pre- . liminary Report will be completed in time .for the May 17th meeting of the Board. The final report of the committee is expected some time in June .. On the topic of the funding of the IEF (Internal Educational Foundation), the Board's Academic Affairs Committee . suppo;ted both the IEF and the anticipated Honor's Program. After considering the issue of funding, the full Board sent the issue back to the Planning and Priorities Committee to, reconsider the future funding of the lEF. A major endowment ca1llpaign is planned for the future, but as yet, the Board has not released any details about its goab other than enlarging the existing· endowment. On the subject of the.iorniula- tion -of a \mission statement;·~ the Board has yet to act but ftottt their recent meeting, it seems that its members are waiting for input from the Review Committee, the Planning and Priorities Commit- tee and Administration in writing a college mission statement. The Student Affairs Commit- tee of the Board also met during the weekend to consider campus- related issues. The committee dis- cusse!,l the \food service\ situa- tion on campus as to the inability of feeding all students housed in dormitories. The . res1,1lt of this- situation is that many Union College students cook in the dorms. which the Board \ 4 ''\\~· to be an unsafe situation. The Trust~es then advised that the controlling of students cooking in the dorms is essential to the safety of the campus. The conditions of the dorms was also discussed by the Student Affairs Committee. A. recommendation was then written to the full board that funds for Housing be kept at a regular level to improve the conditions of . many of the dorms. The recommendation referred to the large fluctuation in money allocated to campus housing from academic year .'76/'77 to academic year '77 /'78. This resulted in a large red1,1ction of money to housing. Ramps· like this one will be installed all over campus. Jeff Wilklow .1977. In preparing its transition plan, My. Litynski followed the ••rule of reason:\ He said that means that his proposals are discretionary, \What I think are appropriate facilities for accommodating the handicapped may not be acceptable to the government or to_ handicapped persons.\ 1 he transition plan, which was. completed in March; calls for a number of physical modifications of existing structures and relocation of certain activities to make college programs accessible to the handicapped. . The transition plan suggest physical modifications of Union's outdoor and indoo.r facilities that range from the installation of elevators to the widening of entry and passageways: Some activities, such as registration for classes at the beginning of each term, would be relocated to remove obstacles for the handicapped. •• AU of the suggestions are designed to assist persoi_ls in wheelchairs,\ Mr. Litynski said. For that reason, the transition plan finds that a few of the college's programs cannot be redesigned, and will have to remain inaccessible to handicapped persons. Such facilities include the bookstore, West College Dining Hall, the theatre in the Nott Memorial, and the Psychology building. Mr. Litynski said, \'In these instances, the cost of modification wa~ judged to be unreasonable to justify the comtruction. For u•~•Li:lllll;t:, to make the Upper ors of the Psychology building acc;esible to handicapped people, would be necessary to install The transi\~Q.Wlan'$r<scl;tedule : or program and facility m .o d if i cat i on c a II s for improvements to be completed in college housing and parking, as well as relocation of programs to be completed by June.

Editorials Rumors This_}IWSt week has ~een Union College bes1eged by a flood of rumors spreadmg up and down campus through students, faculty and admm1strauon. Heading the li~t v.a~ a rumor concerning the future of President Bo~ner._lt had been sa1d that the President would be submitting his res1gnat1on to the Bo~rd ol I rustees during the meeting of the body on Saturday. Accordtng to the \story\ heard by Concordiensis,. the Pres1~ent had three JOb oll~r~. One with the Department of Health, Edu~auon and Weltare m Washington, D.C., another as the presJ_dent ol a college som~where in California, and a third as President ol, the C oll~ge ol Charleston in Charleston, S. C. l~ IS the C~llege ol Charleston that was referred to by many as a rap1dly growm!? school somewhere in the south. This school had been a sm~ll pnvate college ~ntil it went public in recent years and has expenenced marked mcreases in enrollment. Sources in Charleston state that the _school is acitvely seeking a President although 1! ha~ not determ1med ''finalists\ at this point. Concordtensts . was not able to determine if the College of Ch~r~eston cons1ders Dr. Bonner to be a candidate for that pos1t1on. President Bonner categorically denied being a candiclate there alt~ough he did state that he believed that some people at that school m1ght like h1m to be. The recent return to the History Department by Associate Dean ol faculty Dav1d Potts 1~ also generating many rumors. In light ol much contradictory material that has recently surfaced, the true reasons tor Dean Potts' departure from ~d_mmi~trau.~~ . are ~till ob~cured. Concordiensis stands by ( onJecture. , 1ts edno nal of last week ( 41 19 1 78 ), until further relevant miormatlon 1~ uncovered. . Fundln- . I he recent conlus1on over the funding of the IEF and the rest of ~ncremental budget lor 1978-79 has brought several factors to the auent10n ol the Board ol I rustees and reciprocally to the campus. With the pas!>age ot thl!> weekend's Board meeting, and the return ot the budget to the campus and specifically Planning and Priorities, se\eral I actor!> . become very important and significant. First, the ~oard has mdicated that . lunds not spent in an allocation area can~ot be earned over Into the next year lor that area. Thus, unused lEI- money lrom th1::. year cannot be left to lEF f year. . or next In addition, the _l.Joard has indicated that several areas of high expense_mcludmg lire protectiOn, maintenance and Achilles Rink operatio~ ~ust be mcorporated into the budget.

Furthermore, the freshman preceptorial program must be funded.

It they are limited to $82,000 (1%), then many of _these prospects may have to be foregone. The positive aspects ot IEF_ strengthen the undergraduate program and help to strengthen U.mon lor the future. The IEF funding should help secure Umon s place m the hard future ahead.

Janice Vucinich ECSC Coordinator Warfare At WRUC Editors~ Concordiensis; This past Monday night, April 24, we had planned an interview with former Dean of Students, Mark Smith, to be broadcast f.live·l<ever WRUC. The interview was to have been of an informative nature, providing additional darifica* tion to the statements made in a letter Dr. Smith sent to President Bonner last September, which was highly critical of Bonner's perfor- mance as president; the circumstances surrounding Dr. Smith's dismissal as Dean of Students; and the selies of controversial events and issues which have factionalized the campus for the past two years, The it'lterview certainly would have been valuable to the campus community in terms of information and understanding of current campus affairs. However, the interview did not take place, but not for reasons involviri'g Dr. Smith nor interference by the college administration. The source of the problem dealt with WRUC itself. Directly after Dean Smith had agreed to an interview on the air; we informed tbe Executive Board, which is the governing oody of WRUC,. of our . agreement with Dean · Smith,: ln view of th.e fact tHat ·.n.o ohjectiQns were voiced by tbe Board, we pro¢e~ed alQng the satne.. pr~dures as had : ~n followed in our prepara~ ,; :~lO~ .•. of ,all interviews in the . ·· · past'~ al10wittg free r~ign within · , q,ur ·O\¥th,·ethb;at:.~ll$traints. · Fofibjl'ittg· this. fotmat,. sbt · su~cessful interviews were ·.conducted by u~, which bore witness. tQ the effectiveness of ~~r ·irtitllods. · · Over a week after we had first contacted Dean Smith concerning his appearance on WRUC, the Executive Board decided for unbeknownst reasons, to alter the conditions of the . interview without informing us as interviewers as to .the sudden shift in policy. W1thout our. consultation, the Board reduced the length of the interview by tw64hirds, Ji;~d barre([ phnne.,.in .. ,ques- . tlqns. A. ,.c.cnfron,tation developed . out of. a casual meet.ing .at . w:llich .. the credibility of one of tb.e inter- viewers was unfairly chal- lenged. Based on this premature unsubstantiated as- sessment. it was dedded that the interview would be pre- recorded if it was to be done at aU. This was stated in the form of an ultimatum. Various .! members of the Board re- affirmed this stipulation, ef- fectively precluding further rational discussion of the matter. In consideration of the live broadcast of the interview, the following points should be noted: · The c;ectibility' · pf the interview ts enhanced by assuring that it has not been edited, that the remarks are spontaneous. that the inter- viewer has not had the oppor- tunity to presuppose responses to addressed inquires, that this format has been shown to be effective and viable in all of our previous interviews. It is in the opinion of the. interviewers that this program should therefore be aired live. Not·.. withstanding these aforementioned contentions, the Executive B<lard insisted on taping the interview with Dean_ Smith, arguing that: { l) lf the interview is aired live, the station may be held liable for defamatory remarks made by Smith. However, aC()ording to the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Communications Com- mission, as codified , · by the Communications Act of 1934, the holder of a radio station's license is responsible for all material broadcast over the station. In the case of WRUC, the Board of Trustees of Union College holds the license. Therefore, the Board of Trustees bears ultimate (legal) responsibility, and not the members of -tile station. (2) 1f Smith utte-rs offen- sive, but non-libelous remarks directed at any member of the campus community and if the interview is taped, the Execu- tive Board contends that the station would have made \every\ effort to assert control o-ver the interview by preview and clearance of its contents. Whereas if the interview is live, they may not· have sought every enntrol. But. if the interview is taped and the station does not believe it w oontain offensive remarks, in the event thaf anyone feels personally slighted by' Smith's allusions, the station would be damned for not era8in:g . the (unforeseen) · offensive remarks, whereas a live inter· view wotttd· provide the station with every opportunity to co~ttol , the intervi~w within t~ ,. Hmitati:otts · of · a live brbad¢ast.

The argument which would, l suspect, be of widest appeal is that pornography, by treating people I»! objects in es· sentially one dimension, dim- inishe-s the humanity of men and women, most typi.t.:ally of the latter, while doing nothing tQ uplift the spirit. Nor does it contribute to the dignity or self~wortll of the individual. It makes pablic, and thereby de- grades. what ought to be both private ·and beautiful. I would hope, therefore. that members of an enlightened campus com- munity would have enough self-respect not to attend .the film. All those who are concerned with liberating both men and women from the bonds (){ stereotypes should find pornography especially offensive in this regard. however, such as public toilets, restaura.nts and bars will remain segregated. .The small increase in the money allocated to education of blacks will certainly not be enough for any fundamental change in the educational system. This system is calculated to ensure that blacks will function well in the low-paying unskilled jobs to which they are restricted by 1a. w. The system has · been dubbed \education for servitude\ and \education for ignorance\ whose architects have said, \Tiiere is no place for him (the black cliiJ,d) above the level of cerdiln forms of labour.\ This is clearly an educational system designed to relegate, blacks to a position of perpetual menial and spiritual servitude to the whites. lt was in opposing this system that hundreds of black school children lost their lives m 1976 in the student demonstrations of Soweto. renowned newspope1·s. As such. they can only be bririf reviews of the news and cannot carry all of the facl3 that the NY Times has the space to print. Far more extensive coverage of any story. the reader is referred to such papers. ment for the development and implementation of courses approved and recommendtEd · by the Educational Policy Committee. Fourth~ the AU College Senate does not have direct jurisdiction over IEF, rather Planning &, Priorities does. The following are quotes from approved actions of the All · College Senate of May 19, 1977. lt is apparent from these arguments by the Executive Board that their reasoru> for demanding pre-recording of the interview were ill~on­ ceived and . unfounded. Upon reconsiderati<.m of their stand m light of our above counten:harges, the Board modified their ultimatum, so as to allow the u~dited airing of the interView at the sole discretion of the inte.rviewcrs provided that it was taped prior t() airing. The deficiency !!! ~is last argument involves two C()nsiderarlgns inherent in the need. tQ pre-tape any broadcast. First. that you wish the broadcast to be edited, and- secondly, that the airing of the broa4g1St must be scheduled for a time which is particularly inopportune to the individual parties involved. Neither of these situations are applicable in the case of the interview with Dr. Smith. We came to the realization that in grder to air the inter- view nf ·former Dea~ Mark Smith in any form we would be forced to accede to the final ultimate . of the Executive Board, albeit unbased and illogical. ln view of our objectives · for the planned interview. which was to provide public clarification of an as yet muddled campus situation, the interviewers have chosen a course which would provide the most benefit to the college community as a who!¢. In so choosing this path, we have. had to sacrifice prin~ ciples which have so long and so luud been fought for. To these ends, we have el~ted to pre-record this interview which will be done by us under protest due to the b_reaching of the standards that had been established for the conduct of the SPOTLIGHT interview series.

Union Ruggers Confusion Clarified To the Editors: I was dismayed to read your article and accompanying ed- itorial regarding the Internal Education Foundation. I feel that a number of inaccuracies and deficiencies need to be corrected in order that . the College community has accurate information regarding this matter. First, I am not a member of the IEF Board. Rather, l serve as staff to the Board. Jn addition to those mentioned in your article, the Provost serves as a member of the Board. Second, all tuition revenue goes into the general fund of the College. from' there, it is allocated for use according to the College budget. Thus. to speak of an lEF surplus as being transferred to the College's general fund is to misunderstand the College's budgetary process. The I EF budget for this year was, is, and continues to remain $150,()00. To charge that ••the · surplus from this budget is being laundered through the Planning and Priorities Com- mittee into the general operating budget of the College'' is absurd. Third, Conoordiensis must -.not have looked very hard for information regarding current year allocations by lEF. If either my office or that of the Dean of Faculty had been asked, we would have \divulged\ the exact amounts allocated. In fact, Concor· dien$is itself listed $27,000 of such . allocations in editions numl>er l3 and 19 of this :year. Beyond those allocations, the IEF has since awarded $2,187 for five student research projects. Also. the Board has awarded $12,000 of next year's funds to the History Depart\ Finally, both of the Ah'\\\\ quotes relate to the major of both your article editorial~ the funding for for next year. The following a quote from the Planning&.' Priorities Committee minutes· of March 14, .1978. The College remain com~ mitted to a yearly level of funding for IEF (includin~' . carryover) of 2% of full-time undergraduate tuition, but that the portion of next year's budget (new funds) to be reserved for IEF be $82,000. The Cabinet, in its meeting of March 27, approved this rec- ommendation. Two points are crucialj;; Planning & Priorities, iif · . carrying out the respon~ sibilities assigned to it by the All College Senate, cot'lCillde' that IEF had not shown that could utilize effectively an allocation of 2% of under .. graduate tuition revenue plu& carryover of unspent moni~ from 1977-78. Thus, it was recommended that the total ' funding for IEF for 1978~ 79 be no more than 2% of under~ graduate tuition revenues. ln addition. Planning & Prinri•t...., recommended that from next year's revenues b¢ assigned to lEF. The difference between this $82.00Ef and up to 2% of under\ graduate tuition revenue would come from any carryover. Thus, neither the Cabinet nor Planning & Priorities nor anyone else has cut IEFs funding level from 2% to I% of such revenues. The confusion may come from the fact that the $82,000 rep~ resents I% of this year's budgeted undergraduate tuition revenue. Unfortun* ately, that dollar figure was explained to the Board of Trustees in material on the proposed 1978-79 budget in terms of such a percentage. Nonetheless, recommenda- tions for next year call for the IEF to have weU in exeess of $82,000 available for alloca~ tion.

f f- be r, 4, of rd ot he he he to in be rea~on WRUC should be enjQined, from airing the inter- view, the Executive Board be- lieves the Trustees have the right to suspend broadcast operations. However, case law has cited judicial opinions that the· administrative body of a college (i.e. the Trustees) does not possess the legal right to shut down a campus media source funded by the students, thereby infringing upon con- stitutional rights of free p~s. choose not to attend. The argument which would. l suspect, be of widest appeal is that pornography, by treating people 8$- objects in es· sentially one dimension, dim~ inisbes th~ humanity of men and women, most typi{lal1y of the latter, while doing nothinc to uplift the spirit. Nor does it contribute to the dignity or self-worth of the individual. it makes publi(), and thereby de* grades, what ought to be both private and beautiful. I would hope, therefore, that members of an enlightened campus com* munity would have enough self*respect not to attend the film. All those who are concerned with liberating both men and wom.en from the bonds of stereotypes should find pornography especially offensive in this regard. however, such as public toilets, restaurants and bars will remain segregated. _The small increase in the money allocated to education of blacks will certainly not be enough for any fundamental change in the educational system. This system is calculated to ensure that blacks will function well in the low~paying unskilled jobs to which they are restrict~ by law. The system has been dubbed \education for servitude\ and \educatioh for ignorance\ whose architects have said, \There is no plaee for him (the black child) above the level of certtHn forms of labour.\ This is clearly an educational system designed to relegate, blacks to a position of !Xlrpetual menial and spiritual servitude to the whites. It was in opposing this system that hundreds of blat:k school children lost their lives in 1976 in the student demonstrations of Soweto. renowned newspapers.

Fourth, the All College Senate does not have direct jurisdiction over IEF. rather Planning &. Priorities does. The following are quotes from approved actions of the AU College Senate of May 19, 1977. It is apparent from these arguments by th~ Executive Board that their reasons for demanding pre--recording of the interview were mwn~ ceived and . unfounded. Upon reconsideration of their stand iu light of our above countercharges, the Board modified their ultimatum, so as to allow the unedited airing of the interview at the sole discretion of the interviewers provided that it was taped prior to airing. The def'lciency l!! !his last ar~ument involves two considerations inherent in the need to pre~tape any broadcast. First, that you wish the broadcast to be edited, and secondly, that the airing of the broa<,\{.last must be scheduled for a time which is particularly inopportune to the individual parties involved. Neither of these situations are applicable in the case of the interview with Dr. Smith. · We came to the realization that in order to air tlle inter* view of former Dean Mark Smith in any form we would be forced to accede to the final ultimate of the Executive Board, albeit unbased and illogicaL In view of our objectives for the planned interview, which was to provide public clarification of an as yet muddled campus situation, the interviewers have chosen a course which would provide the most benefit to the college community as a whole. In so choosing this path, we have. had to sacrifice prin- ciples which have so long and so hard been fought for. To these ends, we have elected to pre-record this interview which will ~ done by us under protest due to the breaching of the standards that had been established for the conduct of the .

In light of the administration's intended 50% decfease in IEF monies (which would leave only $80,00() for lEF to carry out all of its programs), the honors program W()Uld n·ot be financially viable. Soltttions to this dilemma were to be sought at Tuesday's All College Senate meeting. President Ganz set the Mission Statement discussion in motion by issuing a plea for input on any portion of the statement. Talks began with the broad topic of Continuing Education at Union. The '7.orum, desiring clarity on the pmtion of the \mission\ of Union· College (whicll claims the intention of providing the best possible quality education), posed the issue of whether the growing graduate program gu.idelined by the lAM was in fact to be. represented as equal in importance to the central under- grad curriculum. Most of the members basically agreed that HERE AT LAST! I! The Annual Nortlt Coll~ge· \Drinks on every floor\ party · will take place on Friday April 28th.

Be with us on April 28th .for the best patty of the year!! since Union focuses, as it should, on undergraduate education, any expansion of the lAM program should benefit the undergraduate community. The case of a proposed expansion of lAM and subsequent restriction of undergraduates ili one of the graduate level stat. courses was cited as an exampl~ of the lAM's misconception of ···union's true •~mission.\ Next, the· ••place of the Arts\ at Union was explored by the representatives. The Middle Atlantic States review of Union for the last two year~ has emphasized the deficiency in this area. The Forum, in considering those aspects necessary to improve the department, noted the lack of housing, faculty and the students in the area. In response, it was mentioned that Rudy Nydegger told Barry Smith that there was talk of renovating the N ott Memorial to ·hold art classes; no action is pending on this subject as yet. Generally, the student government felt that it was time for the Administration to make a dear cut cltoice on whether or not to enlarge the Arts program. As of now, the current endowment drive is focused .at relieving tuition and has· indicated rio hard push for new buildings. · The forum then decided to postpone further qiscussion of the Mission Statement until next week. This move was enacted' to allow members more time to analyze the document. 1\_nyone who Wishes to voice his opi1tioit on ·the matter is encouraged'~to attend next week. Finally, Jo-Afin Messino re- ported that the Committee on Committees had approved the constitution of the Circle ~ Inter- national Club, but had . not allotted the organization funding.

Some of these people stand out: Eliphalet Nott, for example, our cantanker- ous · but vibrant President who served as such for sixty-two years. Retiring this year after thirty-two loving years of service to the school is Mrs. Eleanor M. Sarnacki, Head Nurse of th.e Health Service in Silliman Hall. Mrs. Sarnacki is a . warm, glowing woman, who has' .'be~n \gratified by my ~.v§ea'rs :·.at Union .. .l've enjoyed seeing both the school and the Health Service growing together.'' When Mrs. Sarnacki arrived at Union in the fall of 1946, she was the only nurse in a Health Service crammed into one small room in Alumni Gym. As there was no doctor on campus, she did all the suturing required, as well as putting on and taking off splints and casts, tasks that are today dorms. She remembers the old library that got torn down, and normally reserved for physicians. The service grew, and move<l to the second floor of Silliman Hall, acquiring a live-in physician in the process. Alth()ugh there is no physician living on campus currently, there are regular hours when one is here, and at all times they are readily accessible. Mrs. Sarnacki is proud of the Health Service, and says, \It is one of the best in the area.\ Of the many memories she has relating to her work, she recalled particularly a flu epidemic in the late '50s that was so severe, dormitories were quarantined and meals brought in, as she and other nurses and doctors cared for the students in their rooms.: Another time, mumps broke out' among fraternity boys in Hickok House, necessitating a quarantine of the house. The physical plant has changed tremendously during her years, and she remembers with obvious pleasure the softball games that were played on the field that now lies under the down,..campus the Kappa Alpha House that burned down, and all sorts of bits of Union memorabilia. She remembers the boys rushing anxiously down to the train station to wait for their dates to the proms, and she remembers Robert Redford playing with the children that crowded around him during shooting breaks. Before coming to Union, Mrs. Sarnacki had served with the Army Nurse Corp during the World War H years, 1943-46. Stationed at different times in A.frica and Jr.dia at behind-the- lines hospitals, she was also a battlefront nurse during one stint in an evacuation hospital in Burma.

Mazzone became the official Director of Food Services at Union College. Mr. Mazzone will continue as Manager of the Dutch HolloW Pub, also. In his new position, Mr. Mazzone has some exviting new changes for and additions to the present food service. These include: West College - West will continue to be the freshman dining hall, run by a contracted food service. Bids have been accepted from the following food services, and all are equally being considered: A.R.A., R.S.V.P., Service Systems, Servomation, Custom, Interstate United, and, last· but not least, SAGA. In Mr. Mazzone's opm10n, SAGA has shown tremendous improvement over the last few years. What will be offered for the incoming freshmen includes steak or a prime meal once a week, a buffet once a month with decorations and all the fixing, and weekly fast-food monotony breakers, to keep our freshmen happy. Hale House ~ Hale will become strictly an upperclass dining area with a IQ-meal plan being proposed. This will include steak or a prime meal · once a week, buffet once a month, and will be under the direct supervision <Jf the Director of Food Services, not West's contractor. We're still open for suggestions on how to make Hale House most beneficial to the entire campus community. The Rathskellar- The Skellar will continue to be run by the Rathskellar Board. As it stands now, SAGA works for this board; in the future, we hope to have the Director of Food Services report- ing to this board, with him super- VIslng the Skellar. Minor renovations are planned, but only to improve the service and the quality of food. No major changes are foreseen at this time. Pub __.:. The Dutch Hollow Pub will remain as a restaurant/pub as originally designed. We will continue to serve breakfasts- lunches-dinners as usual, provide special function services and catering. Our well-stocked bar will continue to offer its wide variety of liquors, wines and beers. This reorganization of the fo<Jd services has long been needed and promises to better enable us to serve the entire Union commun- ity. Angelo's responsibilities have tripled, and in order for him to provide the best in food service management and policies to you, the students, faculty, administra- tion and staff of Union College - his customers - he appreciates your suggestions and comments. In an effort to improve not only taste, quality and variety of food but also atmosphere, physical sur- roundings, and working con- ditions, he welcomes your support and honest opinions.

He has also worked as a journalist. He is the author of a chapbook of poems, PlaJJning Escape and co-author of Sleeping Obsessions, a book of collaborative poems published under the pseudonym Mercy Bona. Of this book, Ziegler says \Mercy Bona is a fictitious and somewhat perverse poet invented by myself and two other poets.

All Kindsa Theatre By STEVE MENOSSON A marriage is ~ wonderful tping ->to behold; an4- to behold the marriage between Agnes and Michael of The Four)JOster, is indeed an immensely satisfying experience. The Fourpostei', which was produced this past weekend in the Director's Lab Theatre, traces the essentially successful marriage of -two lovebirds on their wedding night to that of wizened sages on the morning of their departure from their home of 35 years. There is pain with the plea~ure as their love is questioned and tested by themselves and parties which cross their individual paths; but as in many marriages everything seems to work itself out. There are children in the picture; and the inanities of child rearing are displayed poignantly by author Jan de Hartog. All in all, it is a worthwhile evening of life and its trivialities, which by the way are what life is all about.

Pure Prairie league (wha will be at Union May 9th) have he(:!n in a prolonged slump. Not since 1973's Two-Lane Highway have they had an unqualified success; last year's live set was a wmmercial and artistic disaster. Just Fiy isn't the wtl(ile answer, but it is a long step· in the right direction. Steel guitarist John David Call has left the group; in his place is guitarist Tim Goshorn, brother of lung-time PPL lead guitarist Larry Goshorn. The personnel change has led to a major change in the group's sound. The strong country flavor which has heen the band's trademark has been largely abandoned in favor of a harder- edged attack. The change works to best advantage on rockers like \Place in the Middle\ (featuring a stinging solo by Larry Goshorn) and \Love Is Falling.\ Traces of the band's old ~tyle remain on the ballads ''Slim Pickins\ and \You Don't Have to Be Alone.\ The band has not completely adjusted to the new lineup, however. The cover of Alan Toussaint's \Workin' in the Coal Mine\ can't touch Lee Dorsey's original, and \Lifetime\ is embar- rassingly saccharine. But there is promise here that PPL may at last be ready to move into the first 'rank · of \country-rock\ bands. KAY A. Bob Marley and the Waiters.

True North had no U.S. distribution until last year; Cockburn's sole claim to fame was Tom Rush's inclusion of one of his songs on Ladie!i Love Outlaws. Circles in the Stream is a live set, recorded last spring at Toronto's Massey Hall. Like most live albums, it is a seini-\greatest hits\ package, and it ably showcases the many facets of Cockburn's considerable talent. reason There are superb solo guitar pieces (\Deer Dancing Around a Broken Mirror\ and \Cader Idris\) eloquent folk-style songs (\One Day I Walk,\ \All the Diamonds in the World,\ and \God Bless the Children\) and instrumental shadings remin- iscent of the early work of Paul Winter (\Lord of the Starfields\).

He explained that there have been many art styles in the tast forty years and that the prints from the Burns collection explain these styles and their significance. Fry outlined what he termed his \model for modernism and modern art\. Modern art began during the mid-19th century with the breaking down of religion and social morals.

The Pan- Hellenic Council is pledged to cooperation witb. the College in ! promoting all activities which ' may be of mutual interest as well as providing a greater under- standing of Union's fraternity and . sorority system to the camp)ls~ community. Mike Squier, Class of '80 and a brother at Sigrrra Chi, was elec- ted President of the Council. As President Mike will be respon- sible for presiding at all PHC meetings and enforcing a recently adopted Constitution and By- Laws of the C(}uncil. He will be the primary spokesman for the Greek system on vampus. Carm Saginario, Class of '80 and a brother at Phi Gamma Delta was elected Vice President. In that capacity, Carm will be responsible for chairing the , Council's Rush and Social Committees as well as maintain~ ing the new PH C room on the 3rd floor of Carnegie Hall. Rich Delaney, Class of '80 and a brother at Beta Theta Pi, was elected to the position of treasurer. As such, he must prepare an accurate budget of anticipated PH C expenditures for the coming year as well as .· maintaining complete and · accurate records of Council finan- cial transactions. Bob Colley, Class of '80 and a Phi Sigma Kappa brother, was elected PHC Secretary. He must compile and distribute Council meeting minutes and other necessary correspondence. All ·members of the Executive Committee welcome suggestions from both Greek members and independent students concerning ways to improve awareness of. Union's fraternities and sororities as well as making the Pan- Hellenic Council an even more viable and effective force on campus.

Not only do graduate school opportunities differ in each department, but each depa.rtment's attitudes. towards students are widely diversified, Rapidly expanding job opportunities and the wide range of disciplines available to Biology majors h&ve enabled most Bio majors with reasonable credentials - 3.0 cum, good recommendations, .sQlid G.R.E.'s (Graduate Record Exams) - to attend .a creditable graduate school. Professor Styles, who heads the Biology Department's guidance program for biology majors, told Concordiensis that the primary factors restricting an applicanfs ,choice of schools were his or her credentials and. personal preferences. lie also spoke of the need for highly specialized biologists by the world's developing .countries as one of the primary causes of the continuance of numerous graduate programs offered in biology. Students, according to Prof. Styles, frequently encounter difficulty entering graduate schools because of the prohibitive costs, rather than the scarcity of positions in graduate programs. Added to the general trend of the rising costs of a graduate education, the scarcity of jobs for Chemistry majors has severely reduced their chances of ever entering a graduate program in Chemistry. For fifteen years, expanding graduate' programs led college chemistry•~d'e;iutments to encourage their major.s to apply to grad schools. Now .a decrease in the number of job~? has induced most colleg~s and universities to reduce or eliminate their programs. This has transformed the optimistic encouragement of the 1960's into the discouragement of all but the most talented chemistry majors from continuing their education. The decline in population increase coupled with the slackening rate of chemical development in the United States ha:v.e decreased the demand for chesisn .in the two basic fi~lds o.pen to graduate students; teaching and research. Professor Scaife emphasized that the scarcity of teaching jobs was due to the declining nationwide student body, while diminishing availability of research jobs for chemists has made it possible for only the privileged few to attain positions. Restriction of grad.uate programs is also prevalent in the field of mathematics, as the top level schools are beginning to re.strict their programs. The Math Department, according to Chairman Arnold Seiken, has achieved success in it!! efforts to place its majors in graduate schools. Professor Seiken credits his department's success to its strength, as he believes that Union's graduates are as qualified as, if not better qualified than, math majors from other small liberal arts colleges against whom Union compares itself. The three basic criteria that graduate schools use to select students are .professors' recommendations, G.R.E. scores, and a student's. cumulative academic, index. the G.R.E. scores are thought by all departments to be influential in the Admissions process, but are overshadowed by · the weight which the student's cumulative average and recommendations have on the applicant's chances of admission. Professor Seiken mentioned ~hat the importance of the G.R.E. scores are measured in their ability to allow the graduate admissions departments a means with which to compare widely differing applicants with each other. Though the G.R.E. scores cannot, according to Prof. Seiken, pinp,oirit an, .a p plica n t'.s specialties, it usually is a• reasonable . measurement of a person's general abilities. The professors' recommendations have a varying influence upon the applicant as it can, in the extreme case,_ virtually assure a candidate's acceptance to a school where a professor from the respective department knows a colleaeeee ave excelled. Conversely, a Professor's recommendation may carry little weight in a school where our professors and graduates are unknown. entioned that the importance of the G.R.E. scores are measured in their ability to allow the graduate admissions departments a means with which to compare widely differing applicants with each other. Though the G.R.E. scores cannot, according to Prof. Seiken, pinpoint an applicant's specialties, it usually is a reasonable measurement of a person's general abilities. The professors' recommendations have a varying influence upon the applicant as it can, in the extreme case, virtually assure a candidate's acceptance to a school where a professor from the respective department knows a colleague, or at a school where Union graduates have excelled. Conversely, a Professor's recommendation may carry little weight in a school where our professors and graduates are unknown. A student's cumulative average is therefore the primary characteristic by which an applicant is measured. Most graduate schools, no matter what field a student is majoring in; will not admit a student with less than a solid 3.0 cum unless they have some unusual qualifica~ions. The competition between students who are applying to graduate school transcends all fields. No matter what the comparative availability of positions in graduate schools, no department can deny the necessity of impressive credentials to assure an applicant's acceptance to highly accredited schools. With all the competition a Union graduate has to face, said Prof. Styles~ Union tries to give their students a widely. diversified background in order ''to make them something special.\ Prof. Seiken echoed his sentiments, as he discussed the importance of the quality of the courses that the applica.nt has taken. The general concensus among the departments interviewed was that the quality of Union's academic program has led to the high Jevel of success that most of out departments have had in placing their students into high level graduate schools.

s f e e g n h '- . CONCORD1ENSIS, April 26, 1978 NYPIRG Po.ll Set In cooperation with students wishing to establish a New York public Research Group (NYPlRG) chapter on the Union College campus, the Student forum will conduct a poll on tuesday May 2nd to gauge potential student interest and .involvement in such a chapter. NYPI:RG is a non-partisan . research and advocacy organization established, directed and supported by New YorJ< State college and University students. A staff of professionals work with students to help· shape public policy concerning various student interests including environmental protection, consumer advo~acy, and other related matters. The poll will be designed only to gauge student interest in the possibility of establishing a NYPlRG chapter at Union and should the Forum decide that sufficient interest exists for NYPH~G, an actual referendum might be required to formally establish a chapter. lf enough interest is expressed for NYPIRG, the Forum would ha:ve to determine how. the chapter would be funded. A number of OA~s Announced Pam Kerin Doug Mahler Joanne Malin proposals for funding methods are presently under consideration. One method of funding, presented as a possiblility by the Student Forum, would be for NYPIRG to receive funding directly out of student tax money, just as if it were a campus club. Another funding option proposed that the student body would vote to tax themselves an additional $2.50 per semester and support the NYPIRG ch&pter through those funds. This method would require a referendum and is the way by which tnost other NYPIRG's are funded. An informational met:ting for all those interested in establishing a NYPIRG chapter will be held· .o11 Wednesday, April 26th at ·Jo pm in the Hale House Lower· Lounge. Students may obtain information regarding 1\YPIRG both at thi~ meeting and at an information table to be set u,p on thursday April 27 in Carnegie Hall. The Orientation '78 Committee would like to thank once again all these who expressed so much interest · in the Orientation '78 program by applying ·for Or-ientation Advisor.

He is known for a number of important· contributions to the computer field. According to Dr. Dijkstra, he ••entered the profession officially on the first spring morning of 1952 and as far as I have been able to trace, I was the first Dutchman to do so in my country.\ In 1957 when required to state his profession on his marriage license, \I stated that I was a programmer. But the municipal authorities of the town of Amsterdam did not accept it on the grounds that there was no such profession. And, believe it or not, under the heading \profession\ by marriage rec0rd shows the ridiculous entry \theoretical physicist.\ Dr. Dijkstra is known as the \fat he r o f s t r u c t u t al programming\ the logical technique presently used by most programmers. He has received numerous awards including the Turing Award from the Associa-tion of Computing Machinery. Dr. Dijkstra: h-a:s written three books and many journal articles. Union College is indeed fortunate to have such a prominent computer specialist come here to share his knowledge and experience .. Handicapped Programs such as the Freshman Preceptorial, student- faculty research, and the anticipated Honors program could cost as much as 150,000 dollars according to Professor Schick and Dean Potts. Any !EF cuts, according te Schick, .could endanger these programs. Nea1 Allen, speaking for Educational Policy Committee, went on . to say that IEF is essential to Union's future, and that innovative educational methods may be Union's claim to superiority. These considerations led the Senate to pass the 2 percent funding resolution. \Housing is the only _part of this phase that will involve much of an expenditure,\ Mr. Litynski said ... Relocating programs will requite a minimal .expense. And designating parking spaces on ~ampus for the handicapped will JUst require that a few signs be erected.\ The remainder of the modifications are scheduled to be completed by June 3, 1980, the deadline stipulated by the government for compliance with the Rehabilitati(ln Act. In the interim, the Act requires that a self-evaluation be completed by June 3, L978. This evaluation is to be conducted with representatives of the handi- capped, and is currently_ being Undertaken. - '•It's a bench mark, a status · Continued from Page I report,\ Mr. Lttynski said. \l\his way the government will be able to find out if the requirements are being adhered to while the project is still underway. They won't have to wait until it's completed in 1980.\ And, like Mr. Litynski noted, the construction called fo.r by tl).e transition plan will require a significant cash .outlay - funds the Board of T.rustees ntay find difficult to allocate without affecting other college programs. Whatever the expense, though, Mr. Litynski also said that Onion's plans fulfill all the government's requirements ... Our plans are as complete as l can imagine,\ he said. \We have for111al proposals, and I'd say that this isn't the case at most colleges.' 1 The final area discussed was the Educational Policy Committee proposal for an Honors Program. Since the various Divisions had not had sufficient time to analyze the program, the proposal was returned to the \committee of the whole\ for open discussion. Funding was of primary concern, and the hope of attracting an external foundationfor funding was present. Again, Neal Allen stressed the need for a new innovative program at Union and that fu,nding, although important, should not preclude Union from adopting the plan. This issue will be considered in greater depth at a future mee~ing~ Union College COFFEEHOUSE presents WALT MICHAEL FRIDAY, APRIL 28 8:30PM $1.00 Admission Old Chapel Come join us for an evening of good music, coffee, tea, lemonade, doughnuts and, of course, Irish Coffee!

The Union women looked sharp as they out- hit their opponents 20 to 15. Their season record is now 1-2. The game opened with the first 5 Union players reaching first through a conrl>ination of Siena errors, walks, alld hits. Fo'ur Union runs scored before the last out. Siena carne back with three lead-off singles. Starting pitcher Jill Henry and the Union women held Siena as they failed to get anY runs acmss the plate. Henry led off the second inning with ~m infield single and a stolen second base. Deb Schwartz's hit up the middle allowed for Henry to easily score from second. Deb (Puff) Downey advanced Schwartz with a sacrifice bunt. Dot Scarpinata~s infield pop-up made the second out. A hard smash to shart by Judy Driscoll resulted in an erratic throw to the Siena first baseman. Downey advanced to second and Schwartz scored on the .error. The inning closed with Barb Kessler ground- ing to second. Union would see its 6-0 lead dwindle away as Siena hitting produced 4 runs in the bottom of the second. 'Uni<m's hitting in the third was- a quick 3 up, 3 down inning. Pitcher Jill Henry was replaced in the third with no outs by Liz Yager. Henry had walked J and had no strikeouts while on the mound. Siena scored 3 runs. With the lead now in Siena's hands, 6-7, Union scored 3 unearned runs in the top of the fourth. Jill Hellry led off the innillg by grounding to the pitcher for the first out. Deb Schwartz reached first on an error by the third baseman. In an attempted steal of second, Siena's catcher overthrew second allow- ing Schwartz to advance to third. Downey grounded to the pitcher whose throw was wide of first allowing Schwartz to score and Downey was a warded second base. Dot Scarpinato flew out for the second out. Judy Driscoll's single past short was the only clean hit of the inning. The Siena pitcher committed her second error of the inning on Kessler's grounder. Downey scored and Driscoll moved to third. A wild pitch allowed Driscoll to score before Sheila O'Donnell grounded to second. Siena was probably glad to see the inning end as they committed a total of 4 costly errors. Siena scored 1 more run in the bottom of the fourth making the score 9-8, Union. Neither team scored in the fifth or sixth inning. Siena, much to even their own surprise, successfully turned over Women's Lacrosse by ANDREA BOWERS The women's varsity lacrosse team played two games last week: at Oneonta on Thursday and Hartwick on Saturday on Union's home field. The squad tied with'Oneonta 5-5 with goals scored by Barbie Burke, Eileen Thomas, Lynn Bateman, and Nancy Colt. Although the Hartwick game proved less successful at tile final score, still the Dutch\Vomen played a fine game with nothing to be ashamed of. Freshman Julie Evans snagged her first goal of the season with Lynn Batemand and , Amy Jaehatz also scoring. Hartwick is ranked in the same category with some of the more difficult opposition that he squad faces this season. Goalie Josie Ritchie continued her usual aggressive garne with 8 saves. The Dutchwomen travelled to Kirkland on Monday to return victorius 3-2. After a first half of sloppy play, Union was down by 2 to Kirkland, .But a determined effort on the team\s part won the game, scoring 3 times in the second half. Union's tough right defense wing, Buthania Shukri proved her worth not only as an aggressive defensewoman, but also in offense, scoring one of Union's valuable goals. Eileen Thomas, as first home, pumped in two goals. Eileen has contributed 5 goals so far this season. The varsity's record stands 2-2-l. The junior varsity were defeated at Kirkland 2-1. Union's Michelle Beaulieu scored twice but the referee discounted one, claiming that she was inside the crease. Kirkland's JV was composed of many of its varsity players. The squad's schedule looks quite challenging for the next couple of weeks. On Friday the varsity will be playing Middlebury at home at 3 on Library Field. On Monday the squad will face St. Lawrence at 4, also at home. Don't miss these two chances to see the women's lacrosse team at the heart of their season. Placement of Graduates in Government Positions Involving the Natural Sciences J. Job opportunities with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation are now essentially restricted to those who have taken (and been well ranked) in appropriate exams given by the N .Y .s. Dept. of Civil Service. Interested students should think about taking these exams several years in advance of graduation because of the complex of affairs. Inquiries should be made .at N.Y.S. Civil Service 457-235Z. 2. Mllst federal positions in the life sdences do not require an exanaination but a file of qualifications must be established in order t() be considered. The standard forms involved may be requested by calling 472-3313 (P.O.B. Albany, 3rd floor of the Federal Building, Broadway and Maiden Lane). Again, these should be completed well in advance of graduation and updated as appropriate. I have a:n example on file. 3. Thus, as it presently stands, very few of our students are in a position to gain employment in the natural sciences with the New York State or the Federal Government.
