Dr. Papanek has been for the past two years Director of the Czechoslovak Information Service in New York. He has been in the Czechoslovak diplomatic service since 1922, serv- ing in various capacities in Buda- pest, in Washington and in Pitts- burgh. He is at the present time closely associated with the exile government of Czechoslovakia in the liberation movement. Dr. Mieczyslawski has served in the Polish diplomatic service in Poland and abroad on different posts since 1927. After the collapse .of France he went to Great Britain where he joined in 1941 the Polish Air Force as a wireless operator.• Recalled by the past Premier Mikolajczyk to the civil service in 1943, he took up the duties of chief of the foreign press division of the Polish Gov- ernment. He reached the United States on official mission at the end of July 1944. In the broadcast both men strongly emphasized the tremend- ously important part small nations can play in the future peace by working along with the large na- tions of the world. Since there were a few members of Schenectady's citizenry present especially those who had left the Old World to take up their abode in this coun- try, the past broadcaet discussion proved to be very animated and the questions asked were not al- ways capable of being answered with great ease. Dr. Fox seemed pleased to see some new faces at this broadcast and he made mention of the fact. However, the absence of Union Col- lege students was conspicious. The weekend must have been strenu- ous. Frances Shaver announced early this week. A check 'disclosed it to be an excellent copy of the \Maqamas of Hariri\ made about the middle of the 13th century.

Basketball Game: Union vs. Co- lumbia in Alumni Gym. Game will .begin at 2015. The attitude on the campus to\vard extra- cml'icular activities is disgusting. No one can deny that our teams haven't received half of the support that students should and can give them. \Why bother\?\ and \So \vhat '?\ are the general expressions when one is asked why he didn't attend such and s1:1ch a function. A shmg of the shoulders, a sigh of annoyance, accompanied by that classical expression, \The lose anyway,\ seems to be a part of the support given our athletic teams. It is true that Union has been more or less unfOl'tunate in its past few seasons of basketball, baseball, and football. For those who want their indifference justified there is alwa,ys the explanation that the teams are composed main!~· of Navy men, most of whom hold an allegiance to another school which they formerly attended. Sure, that's a good excuse-you can't expect the teams to win fm· that very t'eason. Is this the way our coming basketball season is going to be backed'! Are only a few spectators going to be present to l'epre- sent Union, o1· is a good crowd going· to be at all home games and as many others as are possible to atteNd'! Show now that Union has the stuff that preceding generations had in such abundance. The student body ? is not soft, all it needs is a good swift kick in the posterior to get it moving__ We hope that thts will act in such a capacity. ? ? ? 7 7 ? CON CORDY'S INQUIRING REPORTER. ? American Institute of Electrical Engineers is holding a meeting in Old Chapel at 2000. American Chemica;! Society hold- ing a meeting in the Chern. Lab. Guest speaker will be Dr. H.

The topic, \Recent Develop- ments in Natural and Synthetic Fibers.\ Ho\vever, what would happen if the stu- dent body really turned out for games, learned the cheers, and let the boys on the court or field know that they were playing for a cause rather that because they liked to plar'? It is time for the \So \\'hat?\ attitude tn ct•m<' to a !'C'I't'<'Ching halt. The new freshmen ought to bem· in mind that now is the time to determine whether theil· life at college will be overflowing with memories of the old college spirit and a strong feeling for the alma mater or whether their college memories will only pmduce thoug-hts of study, classes, and dullness. Snap out of it now, Frosh, and let's see a turnout at games and other functions. Make some- thing of your college life, this is the only chance you will eve1· have. The same advice can apply to the uppel'- classmen and to the Navy trainees. Rathe1· than remember only a grind of study and work, resolve to recall ~;om college days as ones filled with excitement and the th1·ills of having your side v...in. And if they don't win, don't be ready to pounce on them with sar- castic remarks but at least feel that you were behind them and that perhaps next time will bring better luck.

Last year's hoopsters were a bet- ter squad than their record indi- cate::!. Most of the nine defeats we1e by close margins, one bad break being responsible for the loss in several cases. The prowess of the '43 Dutchmen was established, however, in fom· triumphs. Com- menting on the '44 version Hal 'Whitner, Director of Athletics, said that \L nder limited observatiOn the team is comparable to last year's squad. Height is a big factor and in this respect we are well forti- lied.\ The popular Union coach is high- ly respected among the players. Jesse discusses plays very freely with the squad, getting their opin- ions and suggestions. First string positions are earned and are not a result of picking names out of a hat. Complete records are kept of every man on the squad pertinent to his shooting, recovery of de- fensive and offensive rebounds, and bad passes. In Jesse's own words \the positions are wide open.\ Under wartime conditions, very few colleges will have experienced players. The majority of many teams are composed of military per- sonnel. At most, a player will have two seasons of college basketball. This is a far cry from peacetime when a coach had four seasons to watch each individual. This year's squad includes 18 men, fifty per cent over the normal pre-war total. Instrumental in this increase are the present draft Jaws and the navy restriction program which may re- duce the sqtad overnight. It is interesting to note that the only representation of last year's squad is George Davis, a candidate manager. A potential threat to the Red Raiders from Hamilton exists in three pet plays, namely, the Union Express, the Goshen Play, and the Amsterdam Special, which reputed- ly account for two marks on each attempt.

While at Central he also dabbled in the junior varsity hoop squad's activities, holding down a guard slot. He was also active in track, putting the shot and running the mile. In junior high school, Guy made the vm·sity basketball team for two years straight. \My biggest sports thrill? Well, I guess it was when I was playing football for Central and we went ·down to Miami, Florida, to play in ,the Orange Bowl, That game was to decide the Mythical southern high school championship,\ relates Guy. That was in December, 1943. \Was it hot that night! Ninety- eight degrees during the game, which was played at night. Maybe that had .something to do with our losing the game, 45-0.\ After leaving high school, Che- sick joined the Navy and was sent to Union's V-12 Unit thereon. That was in March of 1944. He expects to be leaving Garnetville in Novem- ber of '45. Upon completion of his naval duties, he wants to continue his study of medicine and become a doctor.

Dr. Fox, \\'(' salute you! Empire State Town Meeting, Dec. 1 0; Discussion on Immigrant Workers The Empire State Town Meeting~--- • held on Sunday, December 10, 1944, had fo~· its speakers Mr. Henry Miller Busch and Mr. Milo Lathrop on the topic: \Do Immigrants Take Jobs From Americans\. Mr. Busch, who is on leave of absence from the Western Reserve University of Clevel.and, accepted the responsi- bility of Executive Director of the National Committee on Post-War Immigration Polley, and he is in great demand as a speaker. Mr. Lathrop, the Public Relations Di- rector of upstate New York for United Electrical, Radio and Ma- chine Workers, received his under- graduate degree at Middlebury College, Vermont and his graduate degree from Yale University, His original profession was teaching and at one time Mr. Lathrop was with the Resettlement Administra- tion of the federal government. Until his present job, this gt:est speaker was a psychologist with the Army Air Forces. Mr. Lathrop felt that the1e would be no need to worry about the im- migration problems that might ex- ist in this country after the war. If there was an international setup provided for labor which could take care of the labor conditions and problems outside of the United States, then the labor situation in the rest of the world might possibly be so favorable as to cause no de- sire on the part of satisfied labor- ers to enter this country as poten- tial citizens. Prof. Busch revealed many facts and figures to indicate that immi- grants malte jobs for Americans and history proves the case. David Thomas, Samuel Slater, Charles P. Steinmetz, Pupin, Tesla, Knudsen. Koklter, Bellanca, Sikorsky and de Seversky were all mentioned as the type of outstanding immigrants who have contributed' much not only to the world but also to Amer- ica. In conclusion Pl'of. Busch an- nounced: The record of history, the proof of statistics and the dem- onstration of our present experi- ence, all combine to prove that the prosperity of the United States was developed with the cooperation of the immigrants and that it has been our experience that immi- grants make jobs for Americans.'' CHESS PLAYERS ARE NEEDED The following letter was received<$>------- --------- this week in the Student Activi- ties Office, and because of the lack of such a body, we reprint it here and suggest that a chern group be immediately organized and report to the Dean's office for further ac- ceptance. It is addressed to the Chess Team of Union College. Dear Captain: The 45th Annual tournament of the Intercollegiate Chess League will take place in New York City on December 27, 28, and 29, 1944. It will probably be held at the Man- hattan Chess Club, perhaps at the Marshall CheGs Club. Each par- ticipating College will enter a team of three players. Play will be con- ducted according to the rules of the Swiss System. There will be either four or five rounds in all. The en- try fee is $2.00 per team, payable at the time of the first round. The letter goes on to say that acceptance of the challenge must be mailed by December 18, to The Intercollegiate Chess League, 1760 Grand Ave., Bronx, N. Y. The letter h:; signed by Milton Finkelstein President of the Intercollegiat~ Chess League. This league consists of 11 mem- bers, including such schools as Cornell, N.Y.U., C.C.N.Y., Columbia, and R.P.I.

A studio has been assigned to him, in the card room of the Psi Upsilon house, which has the advantage of having abund- ant window lignt from three sides. This week these paintings are back m their original places. They have an air of ti eshuess abo1- t them and again people famous in the history or this country and in Union's his- tory gaze upon us. The College owns canvases by Henry Inman, Rembrandt Peale, Waluo and Jewett, and other well known American artists. The life- SIZe portrait of President H:liphalet Nott which hangs on the no1·th wall of the Nott Memorial Libral'y i::~ by Inman. When asked how he recognized a painting to •be by a partiCular artist, Mr. Kelly stated that a painting is rarely signed but that a painting is recognized by the artists' own individual style, technique, and bi·ush stroke. Mt·. Kelly considers the I'ept·ouuctions of Gen. Philip Schuyler, Martha Washington, and Gen. George Washington as excellent .. Although most ol the portraits are on can- vas, there is one which is h.1 a good state of pi eservation on paper. A visit to Mr. Kelly's studio proved most interesting. There is more to the art of restoration than most of us think. In some cases the canvases had been varnished without the accLmulation of dirt having first been removed. This made Mr. Kelly's work more labor- ious for he not only had to remove the existing coat of varnish but also had to remove the undercoat of dirt. Many of the paintings are in good condition; some unfortun- ately have been left unrepaired and the damage can only be repaired as best possible under the eil'cum- stances. The retouching comes after the dirt has been removed and from there the restorer builds up the layers of paint to match. In this way he does his best to con- ceal the flaws which age has left. Mr. Kelly, who has been at his work of l'estoring paintings for over fifty ~·ears, is following in the footsteps of his father who in- structed his son in the art. At the present time Mr. Kelly is working on the paintings which hang in Memorial Chapel. At the conclusion of his work here, he will report for another similar assignment in the South. ---0--- Civilian Notice By special wire to the Concordiensis l!'r-om Milton M.

He also discussed the relationsmp of the colleges to the proposed uni- versal military training. The dinner was gtven in honor of Dr. Fox's ten years as Presiuent of Union, and his 57th birthday. In appreciation of his achievements tor Union, the Alumni presented him with a tare piece of silver of the 1730's, suitably inscribed on its base. To Mrs. Fox, roses and a message of appreciation was sent; highly praising her work also. LeRoy J. Weed, '01, Trustee, pre- sented the gift to Dr. Fox m behalf of his friends here. \Vire Recorder While President Fox was the only scheduled speaker, the Alumni also heat·d 'greetings from their friends on the campus through the \Wire recorder'' which W.

The attendance was consid- ered especially good in view of the hundreds of alumni from here who are in the Armed Forces. As it was, there was a generous sprink- ling of men in Army and Navy uni- forms.

Siuce the establishment of the Hale House Dining Hall itq has been a rule of the College \ · that civilian students be re- quired to wear uecl•ties at tile evelling meals served there. A number of men recently have \fm·gotten\ this rule, and a few have openly disregarded it. On Executive Committee for term ending in 1949: William B. Jaffe, '26; Frederick B. Woodworth, '28; Alan S. Miller, '32; John B. Dow- ling, '37; William W. Mulvey, '38. Prexy's Speech In speaking of the problem con- fronting students and officials of colleges in regard to the proposed universal military training, Dr. Fox said: \The seventeen hundred colleges of the United States are involved, along with hundreds of thousands of commercial and industrial enter- prises and millions of farms, in the problem of military training during peacetime. In the future, most of all, it looms before the successive generations of young men them- selves.\ It is the desire of the Admin- istration to point out that this rule is still in force and that men without ties will not be ad- mitted to the Hale House Din- ing Hall for the evening meal. Mrs. Briggs and the Proctors have been requested to see tlmt this rule is enforced. In this connection students are reminded that in normal times the fraternities not only have a simila1· rule, but often require the wearing of a white shirt as well as the tie at the eveuiug meals served in the fra,. ternity houses, If military training is to come, it will change the circumstances of American life, not simply because of its enormous and continuing cost which will affect our standard of Ji.ving or becau6e it will reduce the quantity of our production in material goods; but likewise be- cause, if protracted to a yea1· it (Continued on Page 4)

Its guest of honor was the president of the CoHeg-e, Dt·. Dixon Ryan Fox. The banquet was dedicated to him because it was his fifty-seventh birth- day anniversary-and because it is his tenth year as presirlent of Union College. A decade has come and gone since the in- auguration of our president. Yesterday the alumni \Vere celebmting the occasion. Let us join them in mmking the event and pa~·ing tribute to Dt·. Fox. Ten yem· sago, on :\larch 2, 193-l, Himm C. Todrl, member of the class of 1897 and then chairman of the board of trustees, au- nounced, at a dinner in New York's Univet·- sity Club, the appointment of Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, professor of history at Columbia Univet·sity, to the presidency of Union Col- leg-e and the chancellol'ship of Union Univer- sity. A few weeks later, Dr. Fox visited the Campus as an Ichabod Spencer lecturer. In the following Fall, he assumed his office- president of Union College, the college from which he had received a degree of Doctot· of Humane Letters in 1931. Ten years have since passed, and in that time, Dr. Fox has shown his great ability ~ls a president of Union College. Fot· this tenth anniversary the entire student body offers its congratulations to Dr. Fox. The faculty, the alumni, those students who are serving in the nation's armed fol'ces-all join in to wish him many, many more yeaTs of service, and to thank him for his achievements. Union is prou dof Dr. Fox. All Union joins in the celebl'ation. The first ten years as a college president are very important. They mark the turning point in his career. N' o mol'e is he a mere president. He is now the \accepted institu- tion.\ After ten years as a college president, Dt·. Dixon Ryan Fox becomes an integral part of the College-an integral part of Union's history. Anyone who thinks of Union will think of him. The t\vo, previously joined only b;r hands, have now combined into one. A great variety of men has occupied the president's chair since the founding of Union. Some of these served for long periods. Others, for only a few years. Outstanding among them is Dr. Eliphalet Nott who was head of Union for sixty-two years. Dr. Fox's tenth anniversary marks the trancendancy from the second to the first group. D1·. Fox ranks now among Union's greater presidents. Jonathan Edwards, Eliphalet Nott, Eliphalet Nott Potter, Andrew Raymond, Chal'les Rich- mond-those are their names. When a man becomes president of such a tradition-bound institution as Union, he is ex- to fit hmself into the firmly molded society pected to sacrifice some of his individuality of the College. Dr. Fox has shown that abil- ity admirably. Union has not been changed to fit itself to Dr. Fox. He has fitted him- self to Union. The traditions of Union-their spirit and age-have not changed. Now, on the tenth anniversary, Dr. Fox himself be- c-omes a part of those traditions. Already thousands of students know him as their Prexy-hte man who led them thmugh their college years. Dr. Fox's life as president of Union College has not been an easy one. He was inaug·ur- ated a few years after the depression. The country was still weak-only the first mile- tuanl!. X. T.

Zitl'et·, 'lt. llarl' ':\aYy stones of the road to recovery had been reached. A few years later political tension in Europe incre~tsed. And theB came the war. Wars are not new for Union Coll.ege. Union wasfounded shortly after the Revolutionary War. It has lived through every war of the United States. This war has not hampered its 19l'Ogress. Of course, Union had to adjust itself to the abnormalities of the times. Un- der the leaden;hip of Dt·. Fox, this has been done without any major sacl'ifices of tradi- tion. The College carries on in spite of diffi .. culties. Dr. Fox has shown his qualities of leadership hel'e as everywhet·e. It is no easy task to be pl'esident of a college during war- time. The very rapid turn-over of students -some students are here for oaly one term, -the dec1·ease in emollment, the loss of some members of the faculty to the nation's serv- ices, the three-term-per-year schedule-prob- lems that are a heavy task for anyone. And J·et the College has carried on. Prob- ably the hardest times are not yet here. But they will prove to be no greater obstacles. in the path of our College and our President. Ten years have passed since the day when famous educators from the entire country assembled at Union and witnessed the inaug·- umtion of Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox as president of Uuion College. To those leaders in educa- tion it was a great day-another man was added to the circleo f college presidents. An- other man was chosen to hold in his hands the futme of his country, to lend strength to the pillats of the United States,-to protect, insure, advise, and plan the education of the nation. It is always a momentous occasion when such responsibilit;y is delegated. Youth is the strength of the wol'ld. The guides of youth have in their hands the power to erect o1· to destroy. The doctrines that our teachers give our youth are those that will mold our future. Thus, an immense trust is placed into the hands of the man who is chosen to be president of a college. He is no mere offi- cial, no mere administrator-he is a person with the greatest responsibility. The educators of our nation are its real rulers. They lay the foundaiton of its future -they train the army of thought and wis- dom that is to protect it-they ward off alien doctrines-they are the guardians of democ- racy, the guardians of the nations~the guardians of all humanity. Dr. Fox assumed his ·place among them exact1;y ten years ago. His outstanding work as president of our college has shown the wisdom of the trustees in their choice. Eco- nomically and educationally, the College has prospered under his guidance. He has led the College through the diffi- cult years of the present war. He has wol'ked with the Navy in establishing a V-12 unit on the Campus. He has seen the training of hundreds of sailors for officership in the United States Navy. He has weathered the storm of difficulties that has arisen. Unrler h.is leadership the Colleg-e has maintained its high standard of education. We congratulate him on his birthday. We congratulate him on his tenth anniversary as Union's president-and hope for many n1ore. We. give him our faith and our loyalty for guidance of our future. And lastly, we thank him-for his efforts, his hard work, and his achievements. Salute our President-the president of Union College-Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox! Buy that extra Bond Now!

I look forwa·rd with much pleasure and anticipa- tion to becoming an alumnus of Union College; not an alumnus in the dictionary definition of t-he word, but actuaHy doing all that I am capable of doing in an attempt to repay in some s-mall way what Union has done for me Gince my first day as a freshman. There is a certain indescribable feeling of good fellows-hi·p here, and the eel- lege 'where we're each the ether's friend' has such an atmosphere of friendlineEs that I hope I wiH never want to los·e track of events cc;m- cerning Union College. It i•3 through alumni that c·o!leges become knov.n to the outside world. All of us cannot become great men, but we can contribute in our own way by interesting others in the fame of our Alma Mater.\ Hpm·y Levy stated: \Yes I hope to become an active alumnus of Union. I like the idea of a small college whet·e everyone has a chance to participate in many ac- tivities. The small cla::<ses in•3Ure better instruction from able ptofes- soJ·s. The arrangement of the cam- pus is very appealing; the informal ait· that prevails evet·ywhere; the utter friendliness of all the stu- dentG. Once the traditions of this grand in<Jtitution get in one's blood they cannot be eluded.\ In the opinion of Waltel' Camc- cioli ''The informal atmosphe·re of the scientific laboratories where the help of the professors is easily ob- tained, is a very desirable feature of the college. The accumulation of good books and journals in the chemistry library offer ample op- portunity for the student who wishes to do research of his own. The characteristic 'good fellow' at- titude that prevails throughout the campus is ve1·y strong as it should be at any good school. I will cer- tainly try to increase the renown of this institution a•3 an alumnus.\ M. W. Smith, says: \Yes. Union has attempted, and I believe, suc- ceeded in maintaining as normal a college atmosphere as possible even during the most crucial war period. The courses which the Col- lege offerG, will supply a student with the necessary background for either a technical job. such as an engineering or in the field of chem- While we girls in our band are still singi.ng Union's pra.ises as a re-sult of the get-together we had with your band, I thought I'd just let you !mow what a grand time we all had there.

This affords Union their chance for revenge for the pigskin defeat suffered at the hands of the New Y0rk gridders at Ba:ker field last September. Elated by the Dutchmen's success in their first encounter, Coach Jesse Perkins has had the oppor- · tunity t0 watch his charges under actual competition. Enthusiasm, however, clid not blind the popular mentor and. with -keen perception, he mentally noted the rough spats which needed to be ironed out in. preparation for this week's game. Recent practices have been devoted to individual correction where bas- ketball L ndamentals were bei11g v-ioltaed. Observation indicates a ma-rked improvement in set shots, dribbling, and lay-up::>. ACT'ION IN UNION-C·OLGATE FRAY Columbia University is not send- ing an untried quintet to Garne~­ vil•le as T·he Liens have the benefit of their fight last Saturday night with their colleagues, the Columbia Midshipmen. The naval five, using · former college stars includiNg ' Johnny Lujack of Nctre Dame, ' Con·ection in last week's bowl- ing schedule: For December 9, :Subs vs. P. T.'s, Tankers vs. Tugs Cruist>rs vs. Destt>oyers, and 'Battlewagons vs. Carriers. Rodger• Merrill of Western Mich- igan and Enno Knocke, easily upset their university rivals 70-to-54. The fact that the Lions managed to avert a more lopsided setback at the hands of this aggregation of established stars speaks well for their prowess as a collegiate team. Also the New Ycrkers took over Webb Institute by a large margin in their first encot:nter. Scoring honors in the New York scrap went to Norman Skinner, a Columbia freshman, who accounted for eighteen marks. Interestingly, these high scoring honors were snatched by the collegiate team de- spite the presence of the eminent stam in the middies' line-up. Skin- ner, a product of Stuyvesant High School in New York, bears close watching from Union's side of the court. Leo boasts of another point- getter in Wood, who plays opposite Skinner as right forward. These two men present a formidable threat to the Union defense. The Boston Garden will be the scene of action on next Wednesday, December 13th, when the Garnet squad participates in the opening game of the doubleheader series. The Dutchmen oppose Bates Col- lege, and LaSalle and Morehead State battle it out in the second game. Union fans will root for the \grays\ this time in deference to the Bates Bobcats from Maine who will don their own garnet suits. Standouts on the Bates roster are Dave Luck of Staten Island, 20Q- pounder, who made a nai?e fo.r himself playing for Columbia Um- versity, and Paul Mitchell, of Wa- terville whose high school team copped' the New England title last year. The Bates squad has one civ- ilian, Sandulli, who is the shortest man on the team standing 5 feet 6. Wednesday marks the Bobcats' opening contest.

This initial headway was gained by the Subs despite the fact that the Tugs had a team average of 604 as compared with a 582 figure for the St:,bs, but the Tugs dropped one of thek matches and thus fell to the runner-up spot. Julius Karwoski walked off with top hono1·s in the individual $Coring column with a 173 average, follow- ed closely by Jack Stitt who was hot on Kar\\'oski's heels with a 172.

ELMER TIDMARSH Union Bond Drive Assured Success Navy and Civilians React to Sixth War Loan Admirably An Open Letter to the Student Body: It has IJeen brouo-ht to the attention of the Student Council that durinO' the past few weeks several incidents have occurred on ~ampus that have shown what we of the Student Council consider a definite lack of Union Spirit. Among these incidents are the poor manners dis- played in Hale House and the several attempts by some of the newer members of the Student Body to cause some slight disruptions in the administra~ion of cert~in Navy Activities. Dr. Eliph~le_t Nott, President of Un:on Col:lege from 1804-1866 ol'lgmated the rule govermng student conduct which is herewith quoted: \each stu- dent is expected to condud himself as a gentleman at all times ... \ This rule ha.s not been followed by many members of the student body. Those responsible for such occurrences m·e mainly from among the uppet· and lower members of the fresh- man class. With the above consideration in mind the Student Council has formed what we call an All College Disciplin- ary Committee made up of a group of four upperelas~­ men (men in their fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth term); two sophomores, (men in their third and fourth te1m) ; and one freshman, (man i·n his first or second term). The committee consists o:t' only civilian students as V -12 trainees are undel' the dit·ect disciplinary control of the Navy Administmtion. The immediate purpose of the All College Disciplin- ary Committee will be to set up in the main part fresh- man rules (considering the upper and lower freshmen as one o-ro up) and then certain general rules to be fol- lowed b~ the rest of the Student Body. This group is to then act as a disciplinary group and will dole out suit- able punishments for any infringements of these regu- lations. (Signed) DAVID M. COHEN, Chairman of the Student Council.

MELVIN J. l:IEIN -Courtetiy Gazette Mel Hein, Union grid coach gen- erally regarded as probably the greatest football center ever, played his 250th gridiron contest when he took the field with the New York Giants against the Redskins in Washington recently. It was Mel's 163rd regular league game, but his 250th all told, includ- ing the games he played in high school and college and exhibition and post-season tilts.

Civilian sales, for which a quota of $4,000 had been set, totaled $8,- 012.50 cash sales, with a maturity value of $11,959.33. Included in this total were the following maturity value sales: Faculty, $8,709.33; staff, $1,375.00; Hale House, $625.00; ground crew, $625.00; and civilian students, $625.0.0. Dr. Bennett, chair- man of civilian sales, stated that the response, especially by the faculty and staff, exceeded expecta- tions and is to be regarded as quite successful.

Co- AppointmE-nts hen for the establishment of an All Chai.rman Co.hen has made the College Disciplinary Committee 1 follow~ng appomtments for this which is to act as a rules commit- 1 comm1ttee: . Hein played four years of high school and a similar number of years at Washington State before joining the Giants back in 1931. This is believed to be t·he most foot- ball ever played by any one man in the 75-year history of the sport. Also released by the committee early this week was their decision to keep the price of admission down to a minimum in order to meet the problem of Christmas-de- pleted wallets. The admission price has been establ!shed by the com- mittee at a lower figure than has heretofore been known on the cam- pus for a formal dance. However, this low admission assessment was made possible only by cooperation between the Navy and the college administrations, and in no way will affect the quality of the band or the decorations. The latter two items will be on as big a scale as ever have been witnessed at col- lege dances, and this fact, coupled with the low admission price, will necessitate a large turnout on the part of the student body in order to insure similar advantages at fu- ture dances.

A poll was taken in each ship and dorm, and was presented to Council Chairman Co- hen who tabulated the votes and an- nounced the decision. The concen- sus was taken in order to obtain student body opinions on the choice of Hower or war stamp corsages for the coming formal. The major- ity was in favor of flower corsages. The second issue brought out at this meeting was the disbandment of the Sophomore Disciplinary Committee in favor of an All-Col- lege Disciplinary Committee. Lastly, a date was set fo1• the election of officers of the Freshmen Class.

The question hns arisen concerning the formulation of a veterans' org-anization and its possible function on campu~. Those hear- ing· this immediately mised loud screams of pmtest. prohal>l~· \'isualizing- a post-war col- lege dominated b~· a nwjol'it~· of veterans controlled by some centml agency s01newhat similar to the . ..\merican Legion and the \' et- erans of Foreign Wars. Think of the tremen- dous po\\'er, politkal <llld social, that such a group could \\'ield. Faced \\'ith the pu~sibilit,\' of a large number of Yeterans constituting perhaps the major pm t of the student en- rollment, l'nion should look fOJ'\'\'aJ'd to this problem and begin now to di:-;cuss and plan iHtelligentl~· for or ag-a·inst such an organiza- tion. The: larger part of the small nucleus of vetemns on campu:s decidedly disapproves of such an organization. One of their main ob- jections a.gainst an organization of this kind is that when a man retums to civil life from the armed fo1·ces he should immediately at- tempt to mix with the cro\\'d. If such an m- g·anization of veteran::; was established on a campus, the retuming veteran might easily lose himself <\lld associate only with those men who have been in sen·ice, thus neu- tmliziilg the effects that a colleg-e education might have on him. The experience in college might tend to draw him into a nmTO\\' world where he would onl;> seek as f1·iends, those \\'ho shared past experiences i-n the wat·. The una \'oidable fact that ph~·sically handi- capped veterans me going to return to the campuses in lmg-e numbers has been offered as a possible and plausible reason for a vet- enm's org-anization. W oulrl such a group really benefit these men'? We are told that the wounded vete1an wants no sympathy nut' does he W<Hlt to be treated differently than others. If there were to L>e a .club (not a l'ratemity!) exclusively for veterans these men should be perfect!~· at home there. Sucia-lly their spare time might be filled with recreation and entertainment conceived by this dub; Ol' vetet·an's organization to keep the term generic. Then what reason would these disabled men have in attending college·: Obviou::;ly to get an education. Along with the academic advancement however comes one of the most important factm·s in a college's existence-teaching- one how to associate with others through experience. A very good idea has been presented. Why not have a Coordinator of Veterans? This idea it seems is the better approach to the problem-if such a problem exists. The Co- odinator could be a membe1· of the faculty, preferably a veteran himself. He could act as Iiason officer between the college authori- til!s and the veterans, advise them as to their courses, keep them posted on the G. I. Bill of Hights and theil· privilege under it, ad- vbe them in reference to their insurance conversions and other such information. This suggestion, it seems, would benefit the vete- mn much more than an organization of vet- erans, and at the same time it would not de- feat the purpose of a college education. C11ion, at pl'esent, has no problems of this nature but in the near future such questions may arise. It would seem advisable to prepare all answet· for them now rather than wait until a crisis arises. ThE> 232nd EmpirE' Stat€' Town Meeting in Old Chapel at 1330. Prof. Charles T. Male will preside.

Homogenized Vitamin D or Regular Milk • Cottage Cheese • Buttermilk e Sour- ed Cream e Dari-Rich Choc- olate Drink • Freshway Orange Drink • Fresh Eggs \All students are strictly forbidden to play at cards, Ol' any unlawful game; to use prorfa.ne or obscene language: to strike or msult any person: to associate with persons of known bad character; to attend at places of vain and idle sports: to visit taverns with- out liberty; to ap11ear in indecent dress, or in woman's apparel; to lie, steal, g-et drunk, o1· be guilty of othe1· gToss immoralities. If any student shall transgress in any of these respects, he shall be punished b~· fine not less than fifty cents, or more than three dollars; or by admonition, 1·ustication, or expulsion.\ Thus states Section 2, Chapter IV, of the \Laws of Union College\ \vhich appear in the College Catalogue for the year 1821. To the civilian reader, this exerpt should have great significance. The male civilian col- lege student of today has practically no regu- lations to abide by outside of the scholastic requirements of the institution which he is attending. We at Union are permitted to lead our personal lives almost entirely as we see fit. True, we do have a few minor and inci- dental \laws\ by which we must abide. These laws, however, are few and fat· between. Since the establishment of the V-12 Unit at Union, all on-campus civilians have been required to eat their meals at Hale House. College men were expected to dine there, with full respect to their position in society. One requirement had to be made after it became apparent that these college men did not l'e- alize the significance of neatness and good appearance. That requirement was the xe- quest that all men wear neckties to the even- ing meal. Hardly enough to be termed a \law\. That simple requirement has, how- ever, been constantly by-passed by many of the student body over the protests of the Hale House hostess. We feel that the time for such action must come to a halt. Om feelings are coincidental to the action that is being taken by Student Council and Administrative authorities. It seems rather ironical to us that men who al'e given the opportunity to attend college in these troubled times should fail to cooperate with the few simple regulations set fot'ward b~· College officials. Were we to suffer under the regulations of the \Laws\ quoted above, unfortunately few of us could sufficiently discipline ourselves to becOn'ie what was then !mown as the \College j.\Ian.\ Are Union College men too uncultured to realize that a certain amount of dignity and neatness are necessary to make an honest and a professional appearance in the world in which they hope to follow their vocational ambition'? We are skeptical about this point, for we believe that Union has not deteri- oriated in cultural background or in social standing, Stop and think, men, about the attitude of the undergraduate body concerning Hale House. Perhaps we have legitimate gripes at times. Those gripes are being looked into and an attempt will be made to benefit our · · stomachs. Do those gripes entail the show- ing of bad manners and sloppiness while we eat our evening meals? Let us be thankful that we have the war time opportunities that are afforded us. Reforms are necessary. Reforms that can either be brought about through self discip- line or through the unwanted college-imposed discipline.

' ;;;,;;a CHRISTMAS DINNER IN THE TROPICS I T is more than likely that many of the American boys in the South Pacific will have turkey for dinner this Christmas. It's not a military necessity, but it's good for morale, and high morale is an asset in any fighting force. Good refrigeration equipment-the same sort that cools blood plasma, medical supplies, drinking water, and stO!\es of ammunition-will make this possible. Recently, in collaboration with U.S. maritime and naval architects, General Electric engineers designed new, pre- fabricated refrigeration equipment for Victory ships which saves cargo space and materially reduces shipyard installation time. These refrigeration systems furnish 372 tons of refrigeration at low tem- perature for meat and fish rooms, and 3 tons of refrigeration at 40° F for vegetable, dairy, and thaw rooms. And six and a half tons is a lot of Christ- mas dinner in anybody's language. Gen- eral Electric Company, Sch1mectady, N.Y. Hear the General Electric programs: \The G·f.

Bush on his recent interview of the Dean. He reported little or no success in obtaining a concrete answer upon which the Committee could malte plans. It was decided however that the Com- mittee would act as an autocratic group in preparing a statement of its purposes. .Purposes The committee then .penned a for- mal set of purposes which we print in full. of selections, which the Union Col- lege Choir as well as Dr. Tid- marsh rendered with all the per- fection of which they are notably capable, the 20th Annual Christmas Music Festival was held in Me- morial Chapel on Sunday, Dec. 17th. \The purpose of the All College Disciplinary Committee is to: 1. ·Create closer feeling between all civilian classes. 2. Bring the lower freshman class into contact with the rest of the civilian student body. 3. Attempt to restore pre-war col- lege life as closely as possible. ·1. To introduce a type of \Big Brother\ and handshaking week into the orientation program, with the hope that it will continue on the post-war campus. 5. Have jurisdiction over any ac- tion against regulations passed by this committee, with the approval of the Student .Council', and to carry these to the student body. 6.

For the newest in swing, the songs that everyone is whistling, tune in on Mondays and Thursdays at 1930. In the absence of Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, Dr. Edward Ellery, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry, acted as moderator at the services. The audience at the morning worship, while it was rather well represented from both the civilian and Naval student bodies, did not measure very well in comparison with the attendance of previous years. Murmurs of approval were easily heard throughout the morning worship, \Good King Wenceslas,\ \The Three Ships,\ and \Lo How a Rose E'er Blooming\ are select- ed as a few of the program which seemed to please most attendants. The afternoon's organ recital at 4 P. M. attracted a large number of music lovers and devotees of Dr. Tidmarsh's masterful control of the organ. The Union College Choir sang, in addition to repeated numbers from the morning service, several old time favorites such as \'The Twelve Days of Christmas\ and \While By My Sheep I w·atched At Night.\ Dr. Tidrnarsh choose for one of his organ num- bers \The Sussex Mummers Christ- mas Carol\ by Percy Grainger, who <Continued on Page 4) Your favorite artists record ex- clusively for Victor Fats Waller, Tommy Dorsey, Hal Mc- Intyre, Sammy Kaye, Vaughn Munroe, Glenn Miller, Duke El- lington, and many others.

An added and very welcome at- traction at this dinner was the af- ter dinner entertainment which was furnished by members of the V-12 t1 aining unit and by Jim Marsters of the Delta Upsilon Dorm, campus prestidigitator.

A quartet made up of Fred Schiffmacher, Richard McAlpine, Victor Springer, and Harrison Demgen, members of the Union College Choir, sang two numbers which the Choir had sung on Sun- day. The crafty manipulations of Jim Mat·sters brought rounds of laughter from those dining. From out of what had been introduced as an empty container, Mr. Marters produced several chocolate bars which he freely tossed to those about him. Thereupon the enter- !ainment was at an end and many m attendance left with the hope that we have more of these after- dinner entertainments at which . campus talent can be featured. :airrry a.tQristmtts tn lnu All

Some may have their sons with them at a Christmas in the nem· future; others will never see the same faces that were there in eal'lier and happier days. It is a rathel' discourag-ing thought that, after nineteen hundred and forty-four ;;ecu·s. mankind has yet to see the fulfillment of the words spoken by an ang-el hovering- ove1· a manger on the outskirts of Bethlehem, \Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace to men of good will.\ Upon the conclu- sion of the last war we \vere promised that we might see these wo!'ds come true. But as long as there are men who al'e not of good \••ill. they will never come true. The \men of good will\ will have to realize their ideals only by destl'oying those who oppose them. In a finer sense this wm is being fought because such \men of g-ood will\ have resisr- ed the ag-gression and barbarism of would-l.Je world conquerol's. ~ineteen centul'ies have passed since Christ lighted the way for such men and still the1·e is no peace in the wodd. The question today in everyone's heart is: \Will this wa!' end all wars? \\'ill we of this generation ever see the actual fulfillment of the angel's words'?\ For these nineteen cen- turies people have pondered ove1· these ques- tions and have found no answer. The world is engaged in the g-oriest car- nage in history. A magnificent wol'ld-wide butchery that would cause the l'uthless \bar- bmic\ conquerors of old to pale at the sig-ht. The em·th runs !'ed with an ever-increasing flow .of blood. Friend and enemy alike have suffered tremendously with more and gl'ea.tet· suffering- to come if v>e are to win the vic- tory of which we are confident. This war must be the climax of centu.!'ies of mad slaughtel' and destruction that man has re- leased upon man. Today m the Allied countries, ·we are all confident of peace; a peace that, we hope, will be etemal. The!'e have already been man~· discussions and conferences as to the best approach in accomplishing this dream of etel'!lal peace. Yet no really definite and unanimously agreed upon plan has been form- ulated. Already in the liberated countries civil wars have broken out and waged with countryman against countryman, brother ag-ainst brother, with as much fet·ocity as the conquero!' had vented upon them before their libe!'ation. Is this a preview of thing·s to come'? We, in college, have fo1· the most patt been untouched b~· war. Yes, there are many among our Navy students who have seen war in its worst moments, and a few of our veter- ans have not been untouched by the fight, but the majority have not seen or felt the impact of total war. The~· are to receive an education to enable them to cope with the complexities of life; life in a peaceful world. To these men of the younger gene1·ation will fall the task of reconstructing the world. Never before has a generation had the oppor- tunity of such an enormous load as this one. They will be responsible for the keeping of the future peace, responsible not only to themselves hut responsible to those who have died so that there might be peace and to those yet unborn who know nothing except peace. Our generation has been challenged. Can we meet this challenge and prove ourselves worthy so that some day in the not too dis- tant futul'e the words spoken nearly two thousand years ago will be true: \Glory to God in the highest, and on ea1·th, peace to men of good will\.

First, College Journalism is a great help in making the student realize the necessity of contacts. The contacts that you make in college last you through life, not just through College. While the various persons you may meet and know dul'ing yom· time spent at college may help you to have a better time while at colleg-e, they will also help you in the world that you \\·ill encounter upon gradu- atiOn. Never feel that the time you have spent in maldng friends is spent foolishly, for it is not. Some good, some bad, they all help you through ~·our formative rears. his inability to express himself. He should be able to express himself clearly and dis- tinctly, without hedging and confusing the issue. While you may say that working for : a college paper may not be the same as work- ing on an actual daily paper, it does teach certain thing-s. Not perhaps the clearcut fac- tual reporting but rather the color that is the required part of any story. The part that lends color and life to the whole publication.

It projects the stu- dents into the center of activity. It gives him a feeling of being an actual participant in the event. Giving him the beginning of respon- sibility not to himself, but to the organiza- tion in which he has taken an active part, gives him a ninroad to organization planning. Journalism gives the undergraduate an idea, or perhaps -a grasp of word usage which will be of invaluable help to him later. He knows how to put across an idea or thought which would otherwise remain hidden due to Any part that you may take in your school paper should add something to your scope, or rather grasp, of life. Whether you work on the organization Ol' actual editorial con- tent of the paper, you have g-ained by this work. By contact with the people that the very existence of the paper depends upon, or the wording of its contents, can you say that you don't feel enlightened by your work? i.Vlen should be encouraged at all times to take an active part in all undergraduate pub- lications. The actual worth of such activities can only be realized by men in the prof~s­ sional fields whose work is directly benefited b ysuch practical experience. Writing, how- ever, is beneficial to the every day activity of nearly every man in every vocation. Let no undergraduate fail to take advantage of this opportunity. (Contributed by Mr. Jer- ald L.

Set to Roll After H.o·liday leave Garnet Sports Subs Retain Top Spot Afte,r Navy Trundlers Chalk Up Third Round With the scheduling of five games to he run off next week came the announcement early this week of the open- ing date and data of the big intramural basketball tourna- ment, which will include this year two leagues instead of one and a round-robin type schedule instead of an elimi- nation tourney. The five tussles on the docket for next week are all iil the civilian circuit, with no V -12 games slated for then. The leagues, as they stand now, include a total of eighteen and possibly nineteen teams, eight of which are in the smaller civvie loop and the other ten or eleven in the Navy league. Jess Perkins, intramural <ilirector, isn't positive at this writing whether the eleventh Navy team will enter. How- ever, some Navy ships are represented by more than one team. At the head of the intramural program is Perkins, while directly under him are two students, one a chair- man of the civilian league and the other the chairman of the Navy league. A. George Davis holds the former post, and J. J. \Spic\ O'Brien was chosen as the Navy league high commander. Under the two loop chairmen are c\Ommittee chairmen, each league having a schedule committee and a referee committee. On the civilian schedule committee are listed Lindley Beattie and Myron Hait, while on the refet·ee committee are Louis Snell and Mac Warren. On the Navy side of the ledger, the schedule committee is composed of but one member, John M. Dempster. Two men comprise the referee committee, Nelson I. Wray and Chuck Richelieu. The Sportlight BILL HOLSTEIN With diff.iculty, the beam of this week's SparUight chases fleeting Bill Holstein, flashy guard of the Union cagers, and comes to rest only momentarHy as the Pittsburgh youth poses for one of those \sure\ set shots. The colorful career of this Per- kinsman flt·st-stringer entaHs four years of varsity basketball at Bethel Township High School near Pittsburgh, where Bill, as a for- ward, tangled with innumerable Pittsburgh teams. Moving on to the University of Pittsburgh in October of 1942, Holstein garnered a berth on the freshman team. Bill, a 155-pounder, stands 5 feet 9 inches and modestly admits that be also delves. into golf.

Red-headed AI Dingley was the hero of the night, pulling the game out of the fire with a two-pointer 20 seconds before the end. Cortland staged a great come- back in the final minutes, and with less than 60 seconds remaining held a one point advantage, but Ding- ley's shot decided the issue in favor of the Dutchmen.

The schedule will appear in full in next week's issue of the \Concordy.\ ;~­ Also, the complete civilian schedule was not released this weelt r by Jess. It, also, will appear next week in full.

On the Tuesday and Thursday sessions, one game is to begin at 7:00 P. M. and 8:00 P. M., respectively, with the Navy men participating obtain- ing extra liberty for such occa- sions. On Saturdays, games will get underway at 1:30 P. M., 2:30 and 3:30 P.M. Another rule laid down by the program's executives is that each team entered in the league shall furnish its own timer and scorer. This ruling was passed for the pur- pose of furthering more interest in the tournament, due to more services. Other rules include: (1) In case of a protest during a game, the protest should be lodged with the intramural direc- tor, Jess Perkins, or with O'Brien or Davis, according to the league in which the protest arose, within twelve hours following the game. ( 2) Only players living in the houses or ships for which they are playing are eligible to compete in regular league .contests. \3) Two defaults by one team shall be considered sufficient cause to drop that team from the tourna- ment.

Polishing off the blades again and readying themselves for the second match of their current campaign, the Garnet fencing squad this week redoubled its efforts to bring its individual performers to top shape fot· the t·ecently-arranged contest with the West Point Cadets at the U. S. Militat·y Academy. Tentative date for the affair has been set at February 3. Fencing Coach Jim Marsters has written also to Columbia, N. Y. U., M. I. T., Harvard and other schools to schedule mm·e matches but as yet has had no reply. The ten men listed on the swords- men's roster are also looking for- ward to a return match with La Salle Institute of Troy early in January. but no definite date has been decided yet. The fencers are recognized, but not financed, by the Athletic De- partment, and all expenses incurred must be sought after through the Student Finance Committee. NEW COACH? Scuttlebutt bas it that Miss Gertie Q. Gooch, above, will be named soon to fill the vacant intramural checliN'S coach's shoes at Union. i The Wagons look two of their 1 three matches in Saturday's sched- ule, dethroning the Cruisers, who won only one of their three en- counters and who had previously occupied the second-place spot af- ter they pulled themselves up from fourth position. Both the Tankers and the Car- J·iei'S failed to !'egister a win and thereby tll·opped to seventh and eighth spots, l'espectively, in the standings. The Destroyers and the fast-moving Tugs were the only squads to n1ake a clean th1·ee-game sweep. Ned Santerian of the Tugs was one good r·eason for his squad's performance because he turned in both the day's high single, 215, and the loop's high triple, 552. In doing this, Ned raised his average seven points to 170, coming within five points of Julius Karwoski, who paces the trundlers' loop with a sparkling average of 174.9. It ·ap- pears that the Tugs copped all the honot·s in last week's matches, in- cluding the league's highest total pinnage, 1831. The Tankers, captained by Bob Fleshe1·, turned in the poorest per- formance of the season so far. Their team's highest single was the Captain's own 152, while Dave Demarest failed to break 100 in two of the three games rolled. Zelte Zwit en, the able treasurer and not so able a bowler turned in only 328 pins for a tht·ee game average of 109. Since Saturday both Zelte and Dave has been practicing with -surprising results. Watch for them in the future. Team Standing Team Won Lost Subs ............. 7 2 Battlewagons .... 6 3 Tugs ............. 5 4 Cruisers .......... 5 4 Destroyers ....... 5 4 P.

No defi- nite decision was made on either of these two plans. At this time, eight lower Fresh- men wandered in to the meeting, and calmly took seats. After a, while, one of these freshmen, name-. ly Neil Hayes, stood up and made the suggestion to the council of having a lower freshman represen-· ta.tive on the All College Discipli- nary Committee. He also spoke vigorously against unofficial com- plaints against men in the Old Gym. A vote was taken by the council in regards to having a lower fresh- man representative on the com- mittee.

Prom Band Leader Student Chabs. Fraternities College Personnel. Topic:s It was announced this wee-k, that Union will play host to an Impor- tant \Conference on Post-War Stu- dent Life\ on .January 26 and 27. There will be prominent represen- tatives from fifteen important col- leges and universities all over the country. In a recent letter from President Fox to the representatives of the seventeen institutions invited, it· was revealed that the \Conference on Post-War Student Life\ will be concerned with the role of fratern- ities, stcdent clubs, and will place special emphasis on personnel work of the college. Questions Some of the questions to be con- sidered at this meeting are \What are the most effectual schemes for guarding and developin-g the phys- ical health of individual students?\ \Are intercollegiate athletics going to play more, or less, part in stu- dent interest?\; \What about non- athletic collegiate activities?\ \Should 'academic credit' be given students for any student activ- ities?\ \Should a faculty man's supervision of some activity be reckoned in determining his regu- lar teaching schedule?\ \What is the best student-tax plans?\ and many others. Chairmen This conference was suggested by the faculty committee on \Post War Planning for Student Affairs\ which is headed by Professor W. W. Bennett. This suggestion was acted upon and Mr. Kingsley W. Given was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Arrangements for this important plan·ning confer- ence. Open Discussioon The initial assemblage will take place in Old Chapel at 8 p_ M. and will be open to the public. The first session will be addressed by Mr. William G. Avirett, Education Editor of the New York Herald Tt'ibune. Mr. Avirett is a graduate of Amherst and has been observing . school and college life for more than a quarter of a Century, in re- cent years having contact with hundreds of colleges. From 9 to 10 the floor will be open for discussion and at 10 P. M. the delegates will retire to the Fac~ ulty Lounge at Hale House for an informal smoker. At 9 A. M., .January 27, the dele- gation will meet in the President's office to discuss the place of fra- ternities on the post-war campus. S11ch subjects as fraternity cooper- ative buying and accounting and coordinated costs will be discussed at this time. At 12:30 P. M., luncheon will be served at Hale House and from there the meeting will again be transferred to the Presidents office for a discussion of student activ- ities and student publications. 6:30 P. M. will see the closing meal at Hale House and at 7:30 in the Hale House Lounge the closing session will be held. Colleges Invited The seventeen colleges and uni- versities invited to attend this con- ferenc are as follows : Amherst, Bowdoin, Brown, Col- gate, Dartmouth, Hamilton, Haver- ford, Middlebury, Princeton, Rens- selaer, Rochester, St. Lawrence, Swarthmore, Trinity, Vermont, Wesleyan, and Williams. DR- W. W- BENNETT ' Chapel on Wednesday, December 27. 1944. Dr. Wold, who has advocated compulsory military training of some sort since his own college days, made clear that \this prob- lem of compulsory training is not a new one in this country. It has been acute on a number of specific occasions in our history, usually during and after each war, lapsing then into desuetude. Always it seems to me, it has been answered wrongly\_ Dr. Wold presented the following four points only in favor of univer- sal miUtary training: 1-The maintenance of a profes- sional army of the size for the probable needs would well nigh bankrupt the country. Dr. Larrabee felt that \we must not be caught again as unprepared as we were in 1917 and 1941. We shall need a sizeable force behind a world organization for collective security, and a much larger one if , Sl ch a world organization is not I brought into being.\ \ \To keep America strong, and se- cure, Dr. Larrabee stated, \we have got to have a younger generation conetantly growing up with two things: the skill and will to supple- ment om· professional fighting forces when and if the need exists. The place to begin is in a sound and democratic system of universal I education - phyeie.al, intellectual and spiritual\.

The t\vo dorms chosen for the housing of the girls are Phi Gam- ma Delta and Chi Psi. These plans have a•U been cleared by the com- mittee through the dean's office and through the head proctor. Informal Dances Also, a possibility for informal record dances to ·be held on Satur- day afternoon is seen, Hempton dis- closed.

Dr. Fox, with Professor .John Allen Krout of Co- lumbia University, is author of volume five, \The Completion of Independence-1790-1830.\ Some of the volumes were copy- righted in 1927 and the last :volume appeared this month. The set has been seventeen years in the pub- lisher's building stage. It would be hard to say how long it was build- ing in the minds of the aut:hor!;l and editors. Withot t doubt the most impor- tant full-scale American history undertalten within the past two decades, the series brought from the S&turday Review of Literature the statement: \Nothing of the kind so large as this has been es- sayed before, nothing has swept the mass of material together in so skillful a fashion. - ----o---- ASCE Holds Lively Christmas Meeting England Completed: Makes Short Visit to Union Professor Rojansky, distinguished member of the Physics Depart- ment of Union CoJ.lege, now on a leave of absence till March 1, 1945, arived in Washington from Eng- land -on Tuesday, December· 19, 1944. While in England, he did im- portant work for the National De- fence Research Committee. Professor Rojansky left for Eng- land about a year ago with a group of specialists, which included Mr- Webb, our college librarian. This group has since returned to this country. Pr-ofessor Rojansky, after a short visit to Union College, has gone back to Washington to con- tinue his work. ----o---- A. I. E. E. Formulates Plans for Meeting Mr. F. V.

Bibber and Walter Short, head of the E. E .. department and student president of the br-anch, respectively. To be held in the Old Chapel at Soloist Before he began to play his own solos back to himself as a discrim- inating listener, it never occurred to the young maestro that he was anything but a hot trumpeter; good -he thought, the best-his admir- ers insisted-but limited to one style. Much to his amazement he perceived that his instrument could give the sweet tones and from then ou he played both sweet and hot. Wherr Lee was only fifteen years old, he played trumpet in a tiny band in a New Yor·k club. Unable to read music he played only his own jazz, .and the customers began to talk about biro. Buddy Harrod heard the talk, came, listened, was impressed and hired the youngster to play at Yoeng's glitter spot on Broadway. Not long after his engagement at Yoeng's, Lee was working in the houseband of the Roseland Ball- room when: Joe Haymes' band was booked into the place as featured attraction. Haymes' trumpeter fail- ed to appear, Lee doubled from houseband to the Haymes outfit, racing across the floor- from one stand to the other. V-12 Representatives A-1-.Jack Carlson A-2-.J . .J.

Walter B. Goad, A/S, president of Tau Sigma, presented the certificate.

For nine years he was a Pro- fessor at the National Greek Uni- versity of Athens. Since 1939 he has been teaching in American Col- leges.

All Interested Are Invited to Attend. ------------------------ NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION Tn1.ditioml.lly the New Yem· is the time to turn over a new leaf, clean the slate, and start in wi-th new resolutions for a fresh start in the coming- year. The recent German offensive in the West and the subsequent loss of the tenitory in a few days, that was gained by the Allies after months of bitter fighting, sho~!ld add a sanibel' notE' to any New Yea1· resolutions that are being made. The fact that the Nazis were able to roll up such a powerful offensive when they were thought to be on their knees is unquestionable proof that the enemy is still powel'ful and dangerous. The allied peoples have been complacent for too long concerning the strength of the enemy and his inevitable defeat. They have taken it as a matter of course that their side would win in a short time and that victory could be easily reached. Let it not be thought that there is any attempt here to comment as a milita1·y strategist but this defeat we have suffered certainly could have been the result of a lack of spirit and praduc- tion on this side of the Atlantic. General Eisenhowe1· has been calling for more am- munition for several \veeks. At the same time, here at home there has been a general feeling that the wm· in Europe is so nearly over that workers leaving their jobs has be- come a familiar practice. There was a foolish school of thought that the General was only trying to scare up a ·war spirit and that there was I'eally plenty of ammunition on the front lines. A glance at the headlines shows that the General may have been justified in his appeals. Blood-donating and bond-buying have de- creased alarming!;\· in the past few months. Vi' e have just finished one of the greatest spending- sp1·ees in our history during the past Christinas season. Articles that were difficult or impossible to obtai:a were un- :>Cl'Upulously bought at outlandish pl'ices !1om the black market. Former blood donors ~ither don't have the time now or feel that their blood is not needed. :\!any are those who have not even attempted to donate this vital fluicl under such ridiculous pretense that they themselves do not have enoug·h. At the front the men are too busy to WolTY about lack of cigarettes and liquor but 1t makes a good topic of conversation for the poor unfortunates at home who are fo1·ced to remain at their jobs, making more money than they haJ ever hoped to and re- HMining perfectly safe from physical discom- fort. Right here in Schenectady we had an example of the kind of patriotism and con- scienciousness, altogether too common on the home front, by the walkout of the two hun- dred toolmakers at G. E. not too long ago. The blame is not on isolated incidents like this but on the sum total of all such inci- dents aU ove1· the country, and at a time when even' piece of fighting equipment is urgently needed. Yes, it will be an unhappy New Year. We have learned a lesson but it took an expen- sive toll in lives and supplies to teach us the lesson. Our New Year resolution should be that if it 1s in our power to make it so, the next new yea!' will be brighter, much brighter. GRIPE FOR IMPROVEMENT Once in a while somebody is heard cri- ticizing something about the G;ym. The cri- ticism is usuall;\· about some minor thing and it is quickly forgotten. Let us look at the picture. What are these criticisms? Are they well; .. founded? How important are they? fui listener can hear occasionally on the Campus. One of the ones that were most commonly heard until recently was the criticism of the fact that the water in the showers was usual- ly cold in the afternoon. L~tely, gripes con- cerning the poor conditions of the score- bom·ds have become prominent. .Most criticisms are vague complaints con- cerning the Gym in general. The gene1·al con~ dition is considered poor. The lockers are rusty, the floors are dirty, the faucets leak, rumors of having seen a mouse Ol' even a rat pop up on occasions, the bleachers are rough and dirty, the seat numbers are hard to see-all these are complaints that a care- Some of these complaints are clearly ex- aggerated. Certainly, the impression that they conver to an outsider is exaggerated. However, there is some basis behind most or them. Of course, the Gymnasium is now a good thirty years old. Any building will show ·wear and tear nfter constant use over such a period. But, perhaps the College could do something to improve the general condition. A little bit here and a little bit there might be sufficient. Greater care on the part of the students in using- the Gym- nasium might, of course, also be helpful. Let us do something about these criticisms. True, many m·e exaggerated, but there is no doubt that there are some thing-s about the G;ymnasium that could stand some im- provement. A. Weinstein, J.

4 Know your Campus The Nott Elm The ;\!'ott Elm now lives in mPm- orr only. In October of 1937, tree experts said that one of its two re- maining great prongs was dead and the other would die shortly. Deci· sion was then mace to remo\'e what was left of thP tree; and in its place one of its own seedlings has been planted. And s>o ended the life of the tree which was long the chief glory of Jackson's Garden, about whose trunk graduating classes held their Class Day exercises, certainly since 1875, and probably a few years earlier. We co not !mow jL st when the tree was named in honor of Eli- phale>t Nott. It was ancient before our great president was born. Dr. Herman W. Merkel of New York Zoological Gardens in 1908 esti· mated its age as at least 450 yeaz s, which-·would have made it more than a sapling when Columbus dis- covered this continent. It was a mcst unusual age for an elm. and Dr. Merkel explained that It was due to the uniquely favorable envi- tonment. The tree was unus: al in ways other than age. Three j?;reat btanches each the size of an ordi- nary elm trunk. sPparated from the main stem within seven feet of the ground and spread out gracefully, Homogenized Vitamin D or Regular Milk • Cottage Cheese e Buttermilk e Sour- ed Cream e Dari-Rich Choc- olate Drink 8 Freshway Orange Drink • Fresh Eggs AMSTERDAM DAIRY 315 Clinton St. Phone 6-2351 gave unusual depth to the wine- glass character of thr native Amer- ican elm. The tree was on the way to its demise in 1907 when happily for us, J. Leslie Walton '09, then a junior, met the late Dr. William T. Horn- aday while on a visit to his daugh- ter in Schenectady. Mr. Walton took this great na tUI alist to E>ee our elm. He was nn ch interested .and offered to send his friend Dr. Mer- kel to advise as to its preservation; and this resulted the following spring in much tree eurgery and the chaining together of the three sagging prongs. This undoubtedly prolonged the life of the elm. The cost was met by a gift of $100 from the Ttustees and the balance raised by the class of '09. It was the win- ter of 1922 that a very severe ice storm did much damage to trees in this neighborhood. It wa<' another alt mnus, Anthony C. Zachlin '21, who suggested the raising of elms from the seedlings of the Nott Elm. This was done by the college> gardener, first in the greenhouse and then in the nursery. A seedling was planted on the site of the ;\!'ott Elm. Now the Nott Elm is a part of the past of Union College; but its desce-ndents, like our own, will carry on into the future.
