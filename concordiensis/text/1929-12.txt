Our Rink Largest in the Lana that sta,t~ intercollegia.te tennis We are told that 'OUr new hockey rink is the largest one in champiims'hips will become an an- nual fea ttue. the country. We have inquired in various places and as yet have Union illaugurated the champion- not heard of one that is larger than the Ryder rink. The actual ships last yea.r and the matches siz;e of the rink is 2.0(') feet by 115 feet, but with the sideboards will again take place this spring under the auspices of the Union will be somewhaJl stnaJ!ler bhan this. Even at that, we are positive College Department of Athletics that it is .the biggest one :in this part of the country, and unless and sancti:oned by the United States we hear StHnething to the contrary, we have the right to claim it, Lawn Tennis A·ssociation. is the largest in the United States. The tc:.ms which will probably : take part in the tournament are How About a Dedication Albany Law school, Albany Tea- Come to thing about it, 'the rink has not been dedicated or named. \\:Ve would suggest that the occasion of our first hockey game with the ConneC'ticut Aggies on January 17, be celebrated .. with dedication exercises for the rink and perhaps H, Russell Ryder, himself, could be present. Sextet Gets On the Ice The Garnet blades h:a-ve already been in action on the rink, despite the fact that the flooding process did not turn out very successful the first tim.e. 'Phis is practically the first year that the lwckey team has been able to get in 'any real workouts this early in the season, and if the weather continues to be cold, the squad should be well undet· way by the time vaca'tion comes. With the great number of expe1·ienced players on hand, Union should bid fair to have a sextet this year ·that can beat Williams and Hamil- ton, a feat which the GaTnet has not been able to do as yet on the ice. New Football Scoring Ideas We s1ee by 1 the papers that Long Island university won a football game a few days ago by 'the score of 22 to 11, the first game in tl1is section of the counhy to be scored under the new systoem that has been advocated. By the new method of scoring, one point is gained for every first down 'that is made. Touchdowns count six points as usual, but there is no point after touchdown.· The idea is an attempt to make the firral score a l\ieal indication of the relative strength of 'the two teams on the field. Let's ·see if that system would have been used in the Union- Williams fray, ·the final score would have been Union 22, Williams 12 .. We wouldn't be surprised to find fhe method used in scoring many of the games next year. * * * * State Tennis Championship He1·e Again· We .are glad to see that Union will again act as host to the New York state intercollegiate ·tennis tournament in May. Last year the idea of the tournament took form and we were fortunate · to have the games on the campus. Such a practice not only helps to advertise the colJ.ege's name, but also g-ives Union a chance •to take a prominent part in a very worthwhile thing. We congratu- late the ·authorities responsible for its continuation here in Schenectady.

Captain Ed Finegalli o:f ·the football team, not sa·tisfied with the lighting leadership he displayed during the past football season, is ou't again for new lam1els. For the second time in three years. the football captain is leading the lac1·osse twelve. Finegan's elec- tion to the lacrosse captaincy, while not a surprise, is another indica•tion of the ability of a man whom we think will be remem- bered as one of Union's great foo-tball captains. But there'll be an awful r.ow if sh.e doesnt get somethin.g-. -and that s<>mething .pretty nice. Can't we help you again this yflar? We'-ve been helping Union men since back in the days when the college was considered 'way up town. And before that. Union Becomes a Many-Sport College With freshman teams, organi;oed or imprompltu, in practi- cally all sport·s in wlhich tihere is a varsity team, Union boasts athletic activity enough to keep this old c1ampus a-busy. There has been some criticism hefoTe that Union had too many sports to maintain, but we wonder what these same critics will say now with all these teams practicing. Whether desirable or not, it \a\t least shows that th()re is Jots of inte1·est in athletics and tha't means something. Many of Unions ablest minds have endorsed our suggestion that }'()U lay :.n a stock of Christma,s gift~ before the Holidays begin.

In Memorial Chapel 'That the people of the world are cons,ta.ntly becoming more indepen- dent in thought and action, was the essence of the sermon delivered in Dhapel Sunday by Rev. Dr. Geor:g+e Craig Stewart of Evanston, Illinoi·s. The sermon was based on the :fi.fth chapter of St. Paul's epistl'e to the Galations. Dr. Stewart stated that the young peoi>le of the present era disregard laws., customs and even l)arental auth<>rity and are mainly interested in asserting their freedom of thought ·and the right, to express themselves. Many parents are not irt sympathy with this trend of af- fair.s and try to rear their children in tlu manner of their forefathers. He said that this is art enlightened age in which every one should he perrniHted freedom of thought un- harnpel'ed by age old tradition. Follow One Master Tlu speaker pointed out that the dominant note of aU religions ot the present age is etnancipation and tepvession. \Youth should 'be com- plimented\ he added \for emphat- ically refusing to he the slave of creed and custom.'' Nevertheless all should be the slave of one master, Christ, for in being his slave they attain the utmost free- dom. He concluded with advice to fol- low ones good impulses. However, Dr .. Stewart stated that there are so many conflicting impulses in .a person's experiences fhat his choice is a difficult one. SOIREE!

Because these men and their as- sociates write straight from the shoulder-they give you the facts plus the excitement and thrill of the game itself. Because the New York Herald Tribune sports pages are admit- tedly so thorough, so complete, so full of real sports news that they are used as models by sports editors everywhere.

The basketball plarer \·ho took very long to decide bet\' een passing the ball and trying for a basket would soon lose his c ll::mces to do either. And the man \\·lw keeps putting off his decision in the clwice of a career may lose his chance to be very effective at anything . Isn't it true that not a few men up to their senior year are still very uncertain what work to take up after graduation? The result is that many a born artist, becomes an indifferent engineer, and many a potential laY\'yer, a poor salesman.

In Christ we find. the incarnation and revelation of· the fullness of God.

The bridges constructed under pressnre of this necessity, very crude in appear- ance, were built with almost in- credible speed, often under heavy fire. The Germans had occupied the Argonne for nearly four years be- . fore they were finally routed, and, in tl1at spa.ce of time had firmly entrenched themselves in remark- ably sti-ong re-enforced concrete dugouts, many of which can be seen t.o this day. Without the aid of engineering skill the enemy could not have retained his occu- pation of the Argonne region so long, nor, for tha:t matter could he . have been dislodged from it. At fhe close of the meetjng, upon ·the moti<>n of Prof. Miller a rising • vote of thanks was tendered Col. Greene in appreciation of his in- . teres ting talk. FRANK H. EVORY &CO.
