The football season was opened under most . favorab~e auspices last Saturday when Union met and defeated St. Stephens by a score of 45-o. The beautiful weather ser-ved to bring out a good-sized crowd, but it was far too warm a day for football and the game accordingly lacked the snap which would have been in evi- dence were the temperature lower. The ~game was, nevertheless, one full of in- terest, for in many ways it was purely an experiment. When college opened three weeks ago there were only four of last year's eleven back, and with the team so weakened the prospects were certainly not bright. Not daunted in the least by this fact, Captain Smith and Prof. Pollard set to work with a will to develop enough of the good material in the freshman class to make an eleven that would be a credit to the college. That their labor has not been without result was shown by Satur- day's game. The work of the new men on the eleven was far ahead of all expectations, and the student body is well satisfied that the team will do its best to make the season a successful one. Satuxday's game was simply a' ~walkover\ for Union. Our goal was never fol' a minute in danger and St. Stephens was outclassed in every point. Union's line resisted like iron the onslaughts of her opponents ; the tackles and ends were rtntch in evidence, both in offensive and defensive play; while the backs all dis- tinguished the1nselves -Capt. Smith for his cool, steady work, Mallery and Dunning for their ground gaining around the ends, Gulnac for hitting the line, and Keogh for both his running and kicking. The team work was un- usually good for so early in the season, but this and, in fact; all the work can be improved upon. The team has a hard season before it, £0 let it not rest on th.e laurels of the first gam.e. It was shortly after three o'clock when the game was caUed. Union had the north goal and the kickoff. 'The ball was cal!lght and downed on the 20 yard line, and after changing hands several ti,mes wa~ given to Union. Mallery started off at once with a joyard run around the right end and then Keogh carried it I 5 yards more for a touchdown, and kicked a goal. After Porter kicked off for St. Stephens the ball was steadily advanced to their 3 yard Hne where it was lost on a fumble. Here St. Stephens \braced up\ and were able to make 50 yards th1·ough several trick pl:ays. They lost the ball on a fumble, however, and it was easily carried back to their 20 yard line from where Carver scored the second toucl1down, Keogh failing to kick the goal. The next two chapters were short ones. In the first Keogh caught the kickoff and ran 55 yards, Mallery crossing the line a second later. Porter again kicked off, and after three end plays Gulnac went through the line for a 30 yard run and touchdown. Keogh kicked both goals. Scol!e, 23-o. The second half was but a repetition of the first. The ball was in St. Stephens territory the entire half and the four touchd()wns were made by Woolworth, Thebe, Dunning and Keogh, the latter kicking two of the goals. Score, Union 45, St. Stephens o.

THE OONOORDIENSIS. Prof. James H. Stoller, accompanied by bis wife and fam·il y, spent,. as all the students know, the past year in Germany, where he was en- ·gaged for the principal part of his time in special studies in his chosen branch of science-- Biology. He returns to Union in ~excellent health and has again resumed his position at the head of the Biological department. Responding to our request for an interview Prof. Stoller said that he and his fa,may spent their first 1nonth abroad at Weitnar. This is a :town about the size of Schenectady, situated in the heart of Germany, and is n1ost interesting to the traveller as being the horne of both Gmthe and Schiller. The houses of both these men 1lave been converted into museums, containing their furniture, pictures, books and lots of other things having a greater or less interest personal to the two great poets. Weitnar is a good place in which to get acquainted with Germany-to get into the German atmosphere not only of to- day but also of the past. The rest of the year Prof. Stoller spent in Leipsic. There are lots of Americans in Leipsic who go there either to study music, or for work in the university. The musical people seem to be very happy in Leipsic and it is in fact one of the great tnusical centres of the world. Here numbers of prominent. artists frotn all parts of the continent and America come to give recitals and listen to the music of others. Not a day passes but that there is an opportunity to hear good music. Once a week there is a grand concert at the \'·Genand Hause.\ Paderewski, who is so well known in tlie United States, said upon one occasion, that he considered it a greater honor to score a suc- cess at Leipsic than at any other place in the world. At St. Thomas' church there is a very noted boys' choir which was founded over two hundred years ago by Sebastian Bach. It con- sists of over two hundred voices. The boys come from all parts of Germany and incidentally receive an excellent education free of any cost. The Gennan student,, says Prof. Stoller, works on a somewhat different plan from that of the American student. Boys first study at the '' gytnnasia·\ and, wi,th. the aid of strict dis- cipline, receive a very thorough preparation for their work at the uni ve~rsi ty. Here there is a great deal of freedor11 given the student, and there is a fooli'Sh custorn among certain classes of students not to do HJuch work for the first year .. At the ''gymnasia\ they are under the lash of their teachers. an the time and when thev get out they think themselves entitled to a year of rest and fun. This they take in the way characteristic of Germ an students, indulging in the conviviality of th,e \Kneipe'' and fighting duels now and then. But after a year or hvo the earnest ones settle down to hard work. They take courses of lectures for a couple of years and then choose so,me sp€cialline of work. If successful in pros~cuting sotne subject of original research and ill passing their examina- tions they are finally g:iven their degree. There are at the universities societies some- what resembling our fraternities. Each m·em- ber wea1·s a colored cap, and while wearing these insignia, the soc:i·eties impose rules upon their m·embers, which· to us seen1, perhaps, rather rediculous. For instance it is considered a disgrace to enter any public conveyance which is not of the more elegant class ; a student who wears a colored cap is never seen in an electric car and if it rains, as it does a good deal of the titne in Leipsic, he is not permitted to carry an umbrella. \ On the whole, c<>mparing our Atnerican college men with the German university stu- dents, I am prouder th:an ever of our Atnerican college students.\ persocyals. Thotnas, 'g8, -is teaching at Mont Pleasant, a suburb of Schenectady. W. G.

Tracy has been appointed in- structor in drafting and Sllrveying. Mr. Tracey graduated from Shefieldschool, Yale university, with the class of '94 aDd since then has been engaged in practical worl\: in Ohio. W m. C.

H,e was a metn- ber of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and was very popular. In Septem?er of ~96 he entered Syracuse and V\rould have graduated last June had he not enlisted at the outbreak of the war. The announcement of his death will cause sorrow to many, as Mr. Bat·ry bad not a few friends still in college.

Persons having grievances or suggestions to bring before the college, or with opinions to air will be given a fair opportunity to do so in these columns. All communications, however, must be accompanied by the name of the author as a guarantee of good faith. THE EFFORTS of Manager Hinman to secure some of the old 'varsity captains to coach the team, are commendable. With good coaching, by men who have been on Union's best teams, the 'varsity ought to become strong enough to win almost every game of the season. Those of our football alumni who think enough of their Alma Mater to spare a few days from. their business to help the team along, will be enthusiastically received and royally entertained while they are on the hill. 'riiE CONOORDIENSIS wou.ld be pleased to pub- lish from time to time letters from Union 1nen who enlisted in the war, and were impressed by the various phases of ·Camp life or the excitement of battle. Experiences of all kinds, and especially those pertaining to our own students or alumni, would make interesting reading and would be of some value as records for future reference, as son1e facts .of the war would be revealed from the standpoint of college men. We will be glad tore- ceive such material at any time, and we will not publish the names of the authors, if they so desire. SATURDAY'S game demonstrated that the 'var- sity has been doing good work at practice, and that Physical Director Pollard and Captain ''Bill\ Smith can accomplish wonders when they have the material to work with. Although the weather was warm, the game was played 'vith plenty of snap, and some of the individual plays were exe- cuted with skill. It is fortunate that Union won the first game of the season, becaus'e victory arouses latent energy, and will keep up the spirits of the team. But Union must not becon1e con- ceited over the result of such a one-sided game. She has another foe to meet on October 12, a.nd the team will have to play its very best, for it is not going to let any college pile up a very large score against her this year. THE ANNUAL fall athletic meet will take place in a few weeks and every fellow who bas ability in a.ny line should co1ne out and train for a few hours each day. Liberal handicaps will be given and the prizes offered are well worth competing for. The banner which will be given to the class winning the most points, ought to be incentive enough to bring out almost every member of each class. Class spirit should be strong at such a time, and each one should contend desperately with the others for the championship banner. Then, the fa( in th de th go p€ as a1 pl w tl a n t: J] () 1 J

Now is the time for Union to begin to develop her material, so that when it is time for that Jneet, the team will be in prime condition to go up against the other colleges and carry of the pennant with as much ease as it did at the' first meet tha~ was held in Utica. WE URGE upon the members of the Musical association, the necessity of promptness in their attendance at rehearsals. The work ~of the clubs c&nnot progress well unless every member is present at every rehearsal and at the hour for which the meeting is called. It is unfair to keep the instructors waiting, unfair to compel the man- agers to go after the men and request their attend- ance, and unfair to the other members who have come on time; they may have other engagements after the rehearsal, and the delay caused by a few members will prolong the practice and may cause these engagements to be broken; also, the tardi- ness of so1ne will afford an excuse for the tardin~ss of others in the future. We hope that the mem- bers will look at this matter in the proper light and be at every rehearsal promptly on time. 8opl]omcre fl\eetii]Q. A meeting of the sophomore class was held Monday afternoon in the college chapel. The election of class officers occupied the greater part of the time, and in a few cases more than one vote was necessary. The officers chosen were as follows : President, Herbert L. Fuller ; vice president, Everett L. Grout : secretary, H. L. Bahler ; treasurer, John McNab; assist. business man- ager Concordiensis, R. H. Robinson ; football manager, A. S. Golden; football captain, H.J. Brown; baseball manager, E. B. Slack ; base- ball captain, J. A. Laing ; manager track ath- letics, W. E. Wormer; captain track athletics, R. B. Tummonds. The ''club\ won at the recent cane-rush was voted to be cut up and distributed among the members of the class. Y. {I\. ~. fl. U1or~ for tt}e Year. Along with the other organizations theY. M. C. A. asks for the attention and i,nterest of the men at Union college. No well-rounded man neglects the religious side of nature, and this organization offers about the only chance that the students have to meet together .and to plan and work among themselves as Christians. Plans for the year have been made and all the students, especially the new :m.en, are invited to aid in carrying them out. The regular religious meetings will be help as in former years, on Tuesday evenings and Sunday afternoons. On Tuesday evenings the students hold a prayer meeting, lasting a half hour. The Sunday afternoon services are gen- erally addressed by a m:etnber of the faculty or by one of the city ,ministers. They occur at intervals, whenever it is possible to secure speakers. In addition to the services, the Bible study comn1ittee expects to form classes which will be placed under competent student leader- ship and will follow the courses prescribed by the international committee. All students who are not members of student Bible classes are urged to join one of these. One of the faults found with a college education is, that it draws a man's attention from higher things and teaches him to spend his years in useless thought. Prof. Hoffman, of our faculty, well observes, \the knowledge that the average young American, even in our colleges, has of the Scriptures, is ridiculously little. He would be ashamed not , to know more about Burns or Bellamy.\ And as a recent speaker put it, \The Bible is the best preached book in the world, but not the best taught.\ The missionary committee will also offer a course in n1ission study to all who are interested in this subject and to any who may desire a historical knowledge of tnissions. From time to time there will be an oppor- tunity to hear and tneet travelling secretaries of the national committee of theY. M. C. A., and of the student volunteer movement for foreign missions. The association asks all Christian men in college for their support and will gladly receive into associate membership all who, while not Christians, are interested in the work,

Union, to her three previous victories in foot- fuall, added another on Saturday by d~feating the eleven representing Stevens Institute in a ·' well contested game. The day was damp, chill~ and by reason of a cold wind blowing 0ver the campus most disagreeable, but every- one present was amply repaid by seeing a very good exhibition of football. The elevens were tnuch better matched in this than in the other two games which have been played upon the campus, and consequently the g:nue could not but be interesting. Snappy playing was the rule upon both sides. Splendid teatn work there 1 was also in abundance, for neither side was able to make a gain at any titne of .more than 30 yards. Both lines stood the test well, the gar- net's especially so. Not a few times did the Stevens backs, without .effect, hurl themselves at our men who stood together in splendid shape. Our Hne bucking was not as fierce as in the Williams game but still was very good. For Stevens, an ,excellent gam,e was played by their quarter back, Myers, their right half, Appleton and their full back, Scammell. Keogh played a splendid game for Union . His running and dodging were much better than usual. Thebo did the best \york on the line. Clever tackling and two well blocked kicks are to his credit. The score of r I to o indicates two touchdowns and one goal. Another touchdown would probably have been made had it not been for an unfortunate play at a critical point. The first touchdown was made in the first half a few minutes after the game began, by Keogh, who made a pretty run of over thirty yards by doing some clever dodging. The second one was made toward the latter part of the second half by Gulnac. Union had hard work in making this touchdown and it was only the result of the • hardest kind of hamn1ering upon the Steven3 line that it was at all aecomplished. The good work of MaHery, Keogh, Carver and Fenton helped gain these last five points. The goal, which had been missed in the former touch- down, was very prettily kicked in this case. Union has thus far been m- successial in her football contests and it is hoped by those in charge that the coming games may be likewise. The team is undoubtedly the best one in several years so that U aion stands an excellent chance of winning the pennant this fall. She has some strong teams to tneet, however, and consequently nothing at all certain may be said. The line up was as follows : STEVENS INSTITUTE. UNIOJJ.

6 THE OONOORDIENSIS. j. 1 0lJ!Q vaQ Sel]aie~, Jr., '94· • U nio~ eoUege has contributed far more than its share to the nu tn her of coUege graduates in New Y(»rk city vvho have achieved eminence in profess,i:oaal and business life. This fact has so long been recognized that the friends of the college iba.ve beoome proud of the prestige of . their insti b:.1tio·n and are greatly grati:Hed over any indm<:ations that this prestige is not to be ditninis1t~.ecl. One of the rnost recent instances of a yo11'1.1ger alumnus of the college who has got his feet on the ladder and begun to cHtnb is that of Mr. John van Schaick, jr., who hasjust been , appointed assistant pasto1· of the Church of the ' Divine Paternity,. Universalist, at the corner of : Central Park West and 76th street. Mr. van Schaicl< gTa.duated in the class of '94, completing his course in thtee years, and spent the next two years as JHi ncipa~ of the Sharon Springs High schooL During the year 1895-96, he resided several r:no11.ths in Boston, where he engaged in University Settletnent work. The past year he has ser-vecl as professor of English and history in the ·College of E1nporia, Kansas. Mr. van Schaick con1es to the Church of the Divine Paternit,F just at a ti1ne when it seet'l1S to be entering, on a career rnarked with unusual pro1nise of success. A new building has re- cently been erected, and everything seetns to indicate ihat the future of the church under Dr. Eaton will more than rival its illustrious past when tbe:congregation sat under the well·known Dr. Cha.pjn. Mr. van Schaick preached his first senDo-n last Sunday night, and those ·who listened to hi1n then and those who knov{ of his record in. college and since graduation vvill agree equally :tllat his share in the 1naking of the nevv history of this church is to be an itnportant and an honorable one. C5:l}e Citerary §oeieties. For tl1e past few years there has been a gen- eral decline in the interest taken in the debatino- societies. Instead of the full number in th: annual e}dernporaneous debate, there have been but three or four anxious to compete, and this lack of interest is no doubt due to the rapid in- ,crease of fraternity spirit. 'The literary sodeties are an important factor in college life. 'They are a legacy fro1n the first sons of Old Union. The past few years 11ave shown the vast power that has developed from training in theseorganizatio:ns. The pulpit and the bar have .each its representatives who show the influence that their connection with these societies has produced. There is a special duty resting upon all the students of Union to join either the Adelphic or Philom.athean society, and do all that they can to promote their work. Lack of thne -is no excuse. An hour or two a week, can easily be found among the m,any hours of \poling\ or of wandering :listlessly about the can1pus. If the few prizes oflered form no inducement for indulgence in this work, then let the noble standing which Union has held in the literary world, claim hearty co-operation and support of every n1an in college. .. A .wee~ly opp?rtunity is offered in which to . ]:Oln ~n tlu~ work. T!1e Adelphics hold their meetings .In North College, and the Philo- matheans In South College. The attention of freshm.en is earnestly called to this branch of college work, and the renewed effort of all the students is earnestly solicited. . At a meeting ?f the Adelphics last Thursday n1ght, the follow1ng officers were elected : Presi- dent, W. F. H. Breeze, '99; vice president, John M. Tug~ey, 1900 ~ secretary, H. S. Bahler, 1901 ; executive cornrrnttee, Doran, '99, Schn1it- ter, '99, and Dalton, 1900. _Rillm l)i J'{ o tes. Walter S .. M~Ewan, '95, of Albany, visited Beta Theta Pt· fr1:ends last Saturday.

The Sophomore-Freshman game was played Wednesday and resulted in a victory for 1901 by a score of 6-· o. A drizzling rain fell all the .afternoon so that the campus was very ,muddy, but even with a wet ball comparatively few fumbles were made. During the first half the ball changed sides :several times and when time was called was in the possession of 1901 in the freshm.en's terri- tory. Near the close of the second half Brown made an excellent punt and Griffith touched the ball but failed to catch it. Weed meanwhile had broken through the Tine and getting the ball made a touchdo,vn. Robinson kicked an easy goal. The ball was put in play again and Weed and Brown each n1ade good gains, but tin1e \\vas called soon after with the ball near the middle of the field.

Burrows, Printer, 4t4State Street, Schenectady. N.Y. IT rs to be hoped tha,t *he football manag·eruent will he able to schedule a garne this fall with Dart- rnouth. Our uwn 1night be beaten, but they would enjoy meeting anothe~ C>f the New England tean1s. It is equally to be hoJ>ed that next year we may have another game with Willia1ns. 'l'he good feeling that exists be~t,veen the two colleges \.vas only streng·htened by- the courteous treat1nent given and received br both sides on the field a.t Williamstown. with which the players have entered into the game have nutde success possible more than any chance plays that have been made. An unfortu- nate play or a ftunble may lose or win a gan1:e, but such accidents are as liable to happen to one side ;: as to the other. PROBABLY the students do not appreciate the fact that.it is through the patronage of the busi- i ness men of Schenectady and Albany, who adver- ,, t~~se in the Concordiensis, that the paper can be published. It is the duty of every student to re- ~ciprocate this patronage, and let our advertisers see that the .college boys appreciate the fact that they advertise in the college paper. We hope that our readers 'Will glance at the ad vertisem·ents in each issue and trade with the business men who 1 are interested enough in the college to pay for space in the pape1· although they realize that the pro- fit will be srnaU. Call on our advertisers, Inention the fact that you are trading with then1 because they advertise in the Concordiensis, aud you will be doing pa1·t of your duty to the college and the college publications. WHO SIIOlJLD be subscribers to the college paper~ Surely the Concordiensis exists for all the students and should receive their support just the sa1ue as any other college organization. Because a dozen copies go into one fraternity house, or two copies to each room, is no reason why half the rneu1bers of any frate1·ni'ty or one occupant of a room should desire to discontinue his subscription. ON OCTOBER 15, another victo1·y w:t.s added to the series of uninterrupted successes of the 'varsity. This is the best gan1e that has been played on the cant pus this season, for the tearn~ were n1ore evenly matched. .Stevens put up an excellent gatne, but frequently furnbled, and several times lost the ball on downs, althong11 the average weight of the 'varsity was Inuch lighli.~r. Union is certainly play- ing in great luck, hut the excellent practice and training that the tean aas received and the spirit ! Much good could be done for the college if tl1e students would forward copies of the paper to friends at home. The prhnary o bje~t of the paper is to satisfy, the needs of the students and the alumni,, but it can also be used as an advertisei' for• the college. If the students who are so anxious to discontinue the pape:r would only forward their copies to sonie friend in the \ Prep.\ school at home,. who is contemplating a college course, this might be the 1neans of bringing hirn to Union. Or the paper tnight be sent to sorne alurnnus and a subscription obtained from hirn. There may be some alumni whom the paper has not reached

jhe er- be re- in ho as ies eir at be THE OONCORDIENSIS. 9 and they would be only too glad to subscribe if they were only put in mind of it. Again the paper might be sent to parents and relatives, who would like to know son1ething about the college, and what part their boys are taking ill college life. Nor is that all. The paper may be of more value to the student than 1nay now appear. Ten I or twenty years hence son1e of the students who are now in college n1ay regret that they have not in their possession the paper that was published during their college days, which contains the ac- counts of games and sports in which they took part, and the records of college life. psi l .. L Dal)Ge. Psi Upsilon gave its annual fall dance at its chapter house Friday evening, October the seventh. As usual, it was a most delightful affair and every·one present enjoyed themselves thoroughly. Not only a few ofDorp's fairest girls, but also several young ladies from out of town were in attendance vvhile the playing of Gioscia lent a decided charm to the evening.

6 THE Q:ONOORDIENSIS. 6ge fall meet The annual faU track athletic meet was held at the Schenectady Driving Park, Friday after- noon, Oct. zr. The weather was disa-greeable and the track heavy, consequently no very fast :. records were tnade. The m,eet was a handicap affair artd silver : and bronze m:edals were offered for first and second places respectively. The banner going to the class winning the most points was won , by '99, with 75 points to their credit. T'he · sophomores were second with 2 5 points; the freshmen third with 14, and the juniors iast with 9· There was a very small attendance of students, in fact, it was disgraceful that no 1nore vrere there to lend their presence, at least, to make tbe affair a success. Manager Bradford worked hard to :m~ake the meet a successflll one ; he was able to get a large number of entries, and if there had been even a fair proportion of the students present to show their interest and give encouragement to the contestants, the meet would have been a better one in every way. Of the fifteen under- graduates who were officials of the meet only eight were present. The events and the winners were as follows: roo yard dash-Won by Price~ '99; Weed, 1901, second.

At the college meeting Monday morning, President Bradford appointed Messrs. Vander Veer, Eatnes and Sherwood, a committee to petition the faculty for a holiday on the Monday preceding election day. The alterations made in the rules for the season of r898 will not n1aterially affect the play. It is not probabie that any captains or coaches will alter their methods, as there is nothing that would com pel them to do this, the rules cotnmittee having tnade every effort to make the rules perfectly clear rather than to inaugurate changes. The change that has been most comm,ented upon is that in the scor,ing rule, which really reduces the value of kicking a goal after a touchdown frotn two points to one. The result is effected by letting the goal and touchdown together count six as formerly, and increasing the value of the touchdown itself from four points to five. The difference in value of the touchdown will have no effect upon the play, nor probably upon the results of any game. But the r~duction of the prize for con- version of touchdowns will bring teams who have no good or accurate goal kicker more readily on a par with those who are fortunate enough to possess a man who can always, when the need comes and the nerve is required, put the ball over the bar.-WALTER CAMP, in Out- ing for November.

UNION played another game of football last Saturday without being scored against. The men were in prime condition and played good ball.

DuRING the football game last Saturday son1e of the spectators became so interested that they could not withstand the temptation to cliinb over the ropes, and get as close as possible to the side- was,_ competition was ·slow, and elicited little applause. Manager Bradford worked hard to n1ake the meet a success, and the students should have given hin1 their hearty support. Even if soine of the students could not enter any of the events, they at least should have gone to the· meet and done all that they could to stir up enthusiasm between the classes.

Union is not a whit behind the rest of the world in golfing interest and every day wit- , nesses enthusiastic golfers engaged in the sport. The links have been greatly improved during the past summer, and a room in south college has been fitted up as the headquarters of the College Hill Golf club. The members of the faculty are well repre- sented on the links by President Raymond and Professors Hale, Pepper, Ashmore and Bennett, while among the students Stewart, Warner, Bradford, Dunning, Casey, Loucks, VanVlack, Foote, Heermance, Wiley, Medbery, Rogers, Bonesteel and Brown, 19or, are the rnost inter- ested devotees to the sport. Even the people of · \ Dorp\ do not disdain to visit the links and take a hand in the gatne. Among thetn is Captain Romeling, who is considered an authority on all matters pertaining to the gatne, having taken a \special course\ in Scotland, ~he land of its birth. The golf links at Union are often brightened by representatives of the fair sex who handle the sticks in a n1au11er that may well make some of the men fear for their laurels. Match games have been played with :tile Hud- son River ·Golf club of Cohoes, the Hudson Golf club and the Saratog,a·Golf club.
