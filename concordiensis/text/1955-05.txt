We were pleasantly surprised to note that as a result of our editorial of April li>, the faculty has been. more than will- ing to cooperate in planning- and administering exams last- ing at the maximum, !Ji) minutes. Student cooperation in handing in pape1·s when called for vdll do much toward com- pleting the job of making the examination system fair and uniform. This will result in t:qual opportunities for all, no matter what any individual has following the exam, a more equitable base for marks, and a chance to get to the next class on time or to eat a decent lunch. Green Thumb We assumed that the reasoning behind the action of the prom committee in degignating Gallo as the official prom florist was to obtain bargain rates from that dealer for Union men buying corsages there. Supposedly, these rates would be lower than those at an~· comparable florist, in exchange for the inct·eased volume of business. A look at the prices listed by Gallo and by King, a long time supplier of prom flowers, shows that they are approximately equal. King then goes one step further by offering a 20 percent discount to Union men. Gallo says nothing. We do not intend to discuss the relative merits of these two reputable florists or theil' business practices. We feel, however, that desip:nation ~s official prom florist means larg-er profits, a portion of which should have found their way back into em·sage buyers' pockets in the form of reduced prices. It seems ridiculous to have an official florist unless the students get something out of it. The prom is a tet·rifidy expensive three or four hours for most students. When flowers, tickets, and the renting or cleaning of formal attit·e, each of which is an expense con- nected only with the prom and not the weekend, are added together, many students think twice before going to the prom, even thoup:h they are planning to have dates for the weekend. Any expense which the prom committee can elim- inate from this total (such as reduced corsage t\ates) puts the dance within reach of more people, increasing the num- ber of tickets sold, reducing expenses even further, and mak- ing the pmm a bigger and better affair. Coals to Newcastle The planning and hard work of the Student Council Election Committee resulted in increasing the num·ber of votes cast in the elections by 70 percent. This represents an increase fn>m the pitiful 260 ballots cast last year to a poor showing of ·13!1 on Wednesday. The council went to the trouble of bringing the ballot boxes to the voters, and received less than a 50 percent re- sponse. The protests were long and loud over the chapel controversy, but most students had no beef coming. There were many complaints about the weak and incompetent Stu- dent Council, yet only 28 percent of Union's student popula- tion had even bothered to vote. If the council makes a move during the next school year against the wishes of a majority of students, the c~m1plaints will again resound across campus, although the ma.JoJ'lt~· of students have no ethical right to complain. It was too much trouble for them to even circle a name on a piece of paper. · E. S. L. SHAFT •• but are you sure this is the open house?' !The HPC's Big Blast Is Tonight ~- .. , Mama Says! Papa Says!

Thirteen general survey Harr.ilton scored single runs in the third, seventh, and eighth, but the combination of Ritter's excel- lent pitching and the fine \.1iork of the Union infield which turned in four double plays was too much for them. In the big seventh Union's Dick Carpenter doubled behind Frank Ward's single and Hamilton pitcher Harvey's balk for the initial run. After Vollmer's walk, Spillane .singled Carpenter home and ·George Wodarzak squeezed in the third Garnet run. On the same play, a Hamilton error permitted Spillane to score the final, and winning tally. Carpenter Leads Hitters Junior Dick Carpenter leads the Garnet hitters with a .333 batting average, and has supplied virtually all the pov.. er in the line-up. The strong left-handed swinger is the only man over .300; catcher Frank Ward hitting the number evenly. Goa-ch Art Lawrence praised Car- penter for his fine ball playing, especially from the plate, and cited the whole team for doing a good job defensively. A sparseness of hitting seems to be the Garnet's only problem as they go into the Middlebury game today. Dave Ritter, Union's top hm•!er, evened out his season's record at 1-1 and will be starting again to- day and seeking both his and the Garnet's second win in a row. The rest of the Union lineup will have Ward catching, Carpenter on first base, Dick Yates at second, Bill Vollmer at third, and Jack Dres- cher playing short stop.

Prexy Views Objectives Last fall in an inten·iew with Gar~· Katz, I listed eight objectives for the year 195-l-55. Now, at the end of the year, I feel we have moved in the right direction in most of these areas. 1. We should attempt to integrate the Field House into our Colleg·e Life. The report of Professor Larrabee's committee recently adopted ];y the Faculty Council sets up a prugram fur the use of the Field House for interco!leginte athletics, physical edu- cation, intrmnural f'port~. anct HOTC ilrill which will keep the building fully used from September to June. 2. We must bring mote students into our athlet~c program. The same Larrabee repo1·t adds a second year of \carry- over sports\ to required Physical Education beginning with the class of 1959. It is hoped that this will encourage a good many sophomores to try out for varsity athletic teams. Win- ter tracl\ will definitely be added to our intercollegiate pro- gram. 3. Secure funds for a new lib1·ary building·. l\Iany o·f you have seen the plastic model of the proposed new building on display. During the year we have made pro- gress in our negotiations with foundations, though we do not as yet have money in the bank. 4. Expand the in.tegTation of Engineering- and Liberal Arts. The new five year combination program ha:; drawn very heavily in our new entering; freshman class. Several students havt> inquired about shifting- oYel' to this program at the end of the year. 3. Bring faculty, students, and administration into closer personal relationships. I want to compliment Georg-e Zervas on the fine work he has carried out in this direction during the year. \Ye will welcome any suggestions from Steve Holbrook for next year. 6. To tnake Fine Arts a permanent program. The appointment of Professor Charles Annan to teach courses in D~sign, Drawing, and Painting and the establish- ment of this as a presumably pennanent part of our curri- culum has just been announced. 7. To help the fraterniti('s clarify their social and edu- cational objectives. The Colleg·e now has a reCJuest before the ~ew York State Dormitor~v Authority for the erection of six new fra- ternity houses on the campus, help being supplied by loans from a Nev; York 'State bond issue. This procedure for incle- pendent colleges was autho1·ized ];y a bill passed in the recent New Yol'l{ State Legislature and .iust signed by Governor Harriman. 8. Try to get more f1·eshmen into extracurricular activ- ities an<l maintain a high interest in campus life. To my mind the revitalization of the Mountebanks under Professor Wing-ate's inspiring direction has been one of the high spots of the year. Other activities also seem to be definitely building for the future. I congratulate the Con- cordiensis on having· pushed for a constructive morale-build- ing pl~o,gTam. faTter Davidson, President The Crux of the Matter It has been five months since we assumed the editorship of this newspaper. In that time, we first tTead cautiously, and then, as our ire was aroused by the disinterest so com- mon on this campus in most things academic and extracurri- culal', we added an all too feeble voice to the chot·us of pta- test. In this, our last erlitorial of the school year, we would like to place the blame for this apathy squarely ·where it be- Iong·s, not on administrative or faculty stagnation as so often cha1·ged, but on the stuctenb:; of l'nion who with an air of smug complacency choose to live in their own personal worlds, whether fraternal or individual, while contributing nothing to the community, and louctly decrying others for not serv- ing their best interests. v\'e belong to a fraternity and prefer not to believe that the frate1·nity s:ystem is the primary cause of such a situ- ation. We can. however, hardly deny the arguments that rnany activitr leaders raise to the effect that rushing during the first weeks of the fall semester deprives them of many men \Yho not only are adopted into the ranks of the frater- nities, but inherit the mental outlook of the brothers as well. This has been reflected in the Concordieusis over the years with the result that an \in group'' of three or four houses who do participate in the newspaper urge their freshmen to work while other segments of the campus encourage their neophytes to seek what they feel to be more fertile fields. Unfortunately, this pattern is repeated in almost every ac- tivity. Thus the freshmen must be \taught\ (a very unfortun- ate but nevertheless descriptive word) that school comes before fraternity. And this can hardly be done when their first contacts at campus are with the fraternity system. Thus two possible 1·emedies remain open if we are to halt apathy in its infancy: 1. The school can return to a system of delayed rushing. subsidizing the fraternities if necessary, but in the long run producing a graduate who will be more conscious of the fact that he attended a college and did not only live at a frater- nity. 2. The activities can take matters into their own hands ~ts~hq•I \Ca.rry Down Harrowcluff!

(I FRIDAY, MAY 13, 1955 Letters to the Editor To tqe Editor of the Concordiensis: This is in reply to the \Green '):'hum])\ editorial in the Friday, May 6th isue of Concordiensis. Apparently the writer violated the first rule of good journalism by jumping at a conclusion and not checking facts. For the record, Gallo's Dov.·ntown Flovists of 96 Jay St. was desig- nated as the official Prom Florist unly after careful consideration by the proao committee of prices of- fered and concessions granted by several florists. We did not solicit the prom committee for this deslg- ·nation. The concession granted for ·re- ceiving recognition as the official prom florist follows: l. SPECIAL PRICES-eompa!·abl<' to other florists-EVEN WITH DISCOUNTS. 2. FREE ·- TIARA for .Prom Queen 3. FREE--TEN (10) corsages for chaperunes 4'. FREE-TWO <2J Dozen Ameri- can Beauty Roses 5. Assutr.1ng partial printing ex- pense. Needless to say·, .the above con- cessions in themselves represent sizeable saving f<lr the stu-dents. Even \'ith the increased recog- nition, posted. notices in all houses and on bulletin boards, advertising in Concordiensis and broadcasting over college radio, donating flo\'l- ers, and offering prices slightly above cost, we had no appreciable ·increase in prom orders over pre- vious years. We feel that we have made some contribution towards making\ the .prom a succes in helping to· keep costs down for the students. Even though we did not receive the added volume we expected, we sin- cerely hope that the prom, as v. ell as other college functions, which v. e hiwe always supported and will continue to grow and \reach rroore people.'' All we can say is that \Gallo. says nothing,\ because Gallo was. asked nothing! Thanking y()U kindly, John J. Gallo and D. R.

Engineers Apply Structural rrheory Senior Civil Engineering- students at Union have taken exb-a time to ap-ply the theory from. their Struc- tural Theory class to an a-ctual problem in the design of t·einforced concrete· -beam. Under the guidance of :Pr<>fessor Anthony Hoadley, the class <>f 14 was 1Hvided into .four separate gxoups: beam design, c~mcrete de- sign, fabrication and testing: Each group '\\as small enough to giVe the individual a substantial share of re- sponsibility. In. this way, a more unified combined effort of the ,group was o-b-tained._ . The reinforced concrete beam w:as designed for 4000 pound con- crete and to w:ithstand a maximum rr•oment of 188\K by the elastic de- sign and 388\K by the ultimate strength design. The beam was six feet, eight inches. in length, 11 and one _half inches deep and six in-c-hes wdde. Loads were applied at the one third points -with sup- p-orts six: feet apart. The class made the complete de- sign including strength of concrete, amount of reinfor-cing steel and §ize and load capacity. JOS. NUSBAUM, INC.
