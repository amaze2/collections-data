LONDON EDITION Vol. LXXIV., No. 23 Lord Fullum Beverage At It Once More Noted Drunk Staggers On Campus; TQ Talk On \Evils of Temperance\;· 'Worth 40 Pts.' Says CV By HILARY CA:RLYLE Lord F u ll u m Beverage,. noted author, lecturer, psy- choloO'ist, chemist, doctor, a tomlc energy physicist, .legal. counsel and diplomat, wtll be the guest speaker on the Tuesday Chapel program, April 1. Lord Beverage, who~e appearance on the campus IS beino· sponsored by the world- wideo \Alcoholics Inebriated\ association, will speak on \The Consequences of Temperance.\ Lord Beverage is fully qualified to speak on such topics of current interest as temperance. He was born United Nation, son of the fa- mous and oft despised Carrie. As an infant he rode about the coun- try papoose-style with C~trie. Youn,g United witnessed hls mothers many attempts to drive \demon gin\ from the hands of the mas~e~. More than once he saw CarneS' famous hatchet wrecking its venge- ance upon one of the few pleasures available to common man. Nation Revolts Nation was revolted by these scenes and at the age of 15 he left for England, stowing away on a banana boat with a girl known only as \Ohaquita.\ Beverage was completely enarmored of \Cha- quita\ and once in England they were married. His wife turned out to be a wealthy aristocrat who had been in the States on. \a fin.g.\ With her financial backmg, Nahan was able to purchase the title of Lord Fullum Beverage and soon took a place in the House of Loads. Liberal With Everything Lord Beverage soon won recogni- tion as an outstanding liberal. He was liberal with everything, drinks, the government's money,. govern- ment contracts and even w1th other men's wives. In view of his ac- complishments in this latter field, he was personally knighted ?Y the Queen, becoming a Regal Kmght of the Royal Knights of the Grand Knights of the Order of V.G. <Victoria's Garter l. Immediately after receiving this honor he took off on a two year binge spending at least one week in at' least one bar in every .coun- try in the world. It was while on thie bender that he decided to found \Alcoholics Inebriated,\ to foster development of that friendly spirit which only drink can give a man. \Temperan«'f\ Propaganda\ Dispersal of the faith bPcame an obscession with BevrragP and he started off on a world-wide !Pcture tour to forward his high and mighty ideals. Beverage has bee.n pleasP<l hy the recepti.on of hiS philosophi<'~ in thP Umted States with on<' exePption. That was what hP tPrms to he \a vile piece of temperance propagandB;· ~bviously dPsigned to lure unthmkmg per- son>< from thP path to umv,ers~l JOY which thf'y might travPrse without any un<lu<' pffort,\ He was speak- ing of a mo\'if' named \The Lost Weekend,\ One of the reputed reasons for Lol t!

Lewis also stated that r,egotiations with ,a \name band' for the May ninth event were proceeding favor- ably and that the committee ex- pected to be able to release the name of the band in the very near future. \Showboat Serenade\ was chosen after the committee made an in· tensive study of the ~ecorative pos- sibilities open to it on its limited budget. It is planned to recreate a river scene in Alumni Gymnasium for the pleasure of those attending the dance. Although no real show- boat will be available to be used in the decorative scheme, novel f,ea- tures will be introduced to produce the atmosphere of life along the rivers which showboats plied in their heyday. The committee intends to have the bandstand decorated so that it will resemble a wharf on the Miss- issippi, with its bales of cotton Lewis also announced other plan!> for what is considered the biggest event of four years of college life. Friday evening before the \Show- boat Serenade\ the Interfraternity Council will sponsor its annual In- terfraternity Sing. A weeltemj of athletic events is also scheduled.

The committee announced in Chapel this noon that Art Kean of Old.gym had won the free ticket it offered to the student offering the best suggestion of a name and theme for the dance.

CARLYLE Union ·college, which shat- · t.ered precedent in 1795 wh~n it adopted a French motto m- ; stead of the traditional Latin slogan, set another precedent : this week when it released pictures of the new College . J.{ing which was officially ac- ' ~epted by the Board of Trus- · wes in solemn convocation. · In announcing the change, Pres!· ' dent Carter Davidson said that al- though Union takeE• great pride in maintaining those traditions which wetc e~tablished countless years ago, the College also prides itself on its ability to keep abreast of teh times. He stated, \We are now .!itizens of the Atomic Age. It is .vell that t:vcryone realize that we have entend a new area. Union has lor.g had an influence on pro- gtessive <·teps and the Administra- tion feels that acceptance of this new Atomic Ring will further em-, phasize out position in the world Jf atomic fi.:;:;ion. It is hop!'d that I this ting will cteate an awnt,Pn<'•~ 1f hte new world we live in ar.d that Union, !Jy this step, will main- tain a pcsition of lwdership.\ Undergrads Incapable The new College Ring will .be '!!iven to every graduating Senior together with his diploma. .Ail- though several of the rir gE\ have 'appeared on campus during the last wee!{ t)ley were not legally be- ,stowed,, since undergraduates· are forbidden to wear this powerful symbol of a dynamic age. Dr. Davidson said. \We consider the Can average undergraduate incapable of coping with this tremendous capsule of concentrated ener[y. Therefore, we are outlawing pos- session of the ring by undergrad- uates.\ He further added, \In c ac•es where these rings have been worn without sufficient instructicn as to their use, some students have received permanent markings on their fingers due to the highly ac- tive elements contained therein. I trust that students who now havE: these rings will turn them over to the proper authorities at once:· Handsome Affair The new ring Is a handsome a( fair and one which any graduate might proudly wear as a symbol.of his academic and intellectual recog- nition by Union College, The base of the ring is a glimmering gold- like metal. Surmounted on this is a silver bomb shaped object which contains the radioactive elements. The tail surface of the bomb is made of a recently developed p!as- tice, colc.red red. Rcmo\'lng the tail surface, one finds a glass observation lens for observing the atomic fif'sion cham- ber. Close scrutiny through this lens, in a dar){ coom. will reveal the traces of splitting atoms. Care should be exerc:sed in watching the atom bursts thot1gh, f.or pro- longed exposure to the rays may be dangerous. Crib Note Cache Another novel feature of the ring is found in the tail surface. This is hollow and can easHy be employed as a converient cache for crib notes or other pa.pers of vital necessity. Dr. Davidson intimated So Long Neglected Dv, J. Potzan Panns, world-fa- mous Authority, is being brought to the Union College campus, an- nounced Alphic Society President \Dulte\ BaBuer today. Dr. Panns, said Bauer, has mapaged to secure his 1:elease from a long term con- tract with an educational institu- tion at Dannemora for the express purpose of aiding Union. Potzy, as the eminent doctor Is usually called, is a renowned ex- pert in many fields. A proponent of the 20 mule shift in football, he Is expected to revitalize the Union team. His most notable contribu- te the great American sport oo- curred last year when Potzy led the U.P. team to a splendid victory against Por Celain in the W.C. Bowl. In comemoration of this up- set, the students of U.P. presented Dr. Panns with the circular paper award. It has been further announced that the eminent Authority is to assist the Office of the Comptroller in raising funds. It appears that the ,present administration is wor- ried over the lack of income re- ceived from the rental of college property. Dr. Panns has promised ,to show the college a way to raise a great deal more than the $21,000 that the coming rent scale is ob- taining from the rooms .in South College alone. Another fuhd rais- ing scheme is the training of stu- dents to sit on each others' laps so that the Athletic Department will have more ,seats at football games o sell to alumni and townspeople. Potsy has also bee nasked to head a committee to restore Jack- son's Gardens to their former pristine beauty-affording peace and quiet for the myriad lovers ex- pected here in the wake of the, changes at hand. \The present condition of Jackson.'s Garden is an insult to all romantic minded people,\ says Panns. \The grass has been worn entirely too thin for any considerable use and should be restored to a utilitarian state.\ The local beer rules will come in for extensive revision when this dynamic exponent of two-fisted drinking hits the campus. Potzy believes, as may be noted in his. picture, that one shoUld never be far-removed from a scource of liquid. When questioned as to whether or not there should be liquOl' in the fraternity houses, he snorted, \Certainly! What in the name of the s·even blue blazes do you expect those poor tired boys to drink?\ He also said that milk is a fine baby food while water is 'excellent for rusting nails and rot- ting leather. The handling of Union's endow- ment funds will also be placed under the competent control of the renowned Potzy. Dr. Panns feels that the college has failed to make optimum use of the money· at hand. In the place of existing financing schemes, he plans to di- vert all available funds into a re- financing of the Allied Kiddie Kar Korporation. \If the courts do not interfere,\ says Panna, \this will be the greatest swindle In the his- tory of Union.\ The Alphic Society lias done Union a great service in bringing such a high-minded man to the college. The last change discussed by the noted educator was the revision of the Chapel system. Instead of the present plan of one and two points , for attending divine services, Potzy intends to give 40 credits to evecy man who can think up one good reason for having Chapel. All others will be automatically ex- cused. that this might be alicither reason . for not entrusting Undergraduates with these rings, Vol. LXXI Op Gentlem :, ·we •h; what is · more .til · student cessful, were fu student The tE advised!: ye>•terda l'CCO!'d 'f< Much rected 1 ard at t: have m1 tha:t \if and the ing en01 attend v this sou: valved 'some to latent, ir Evider portant · student these q the coli 'thing c than ati hard~wo: own aff1 curate, I Union.

Perhaps the whole affair is just another indication of the cld adage that the \hills are greener far away.\ ---01---- THURSDAY CHAPEL Thursday noon in Chapel, UCRS, the college radio station, came 'forth with the most important bit of news from that source this year. During the progvam which pur- ported to show the aims and meth- ods of the S·Ociety, messenger Mor- ton Silverman was dispatched post- haste with a lengthy piece of paper (roll-type). His statement as he left the crowded chapel was-\I wonder what Joe Harmon will do with this?\ This is the answer.

The others are giggling ar.d leaping up and down in the excesseE> ·of their in- human joy. Once Dr. Scale reached slyly into Not O'Chord's sack in an. attempt to steal s·ome of the lat- ter's catch, but he was thwarted when Not sank his teeth into the good Doctor's wrist. \Break it up, boys\ growled Dr.. Oxus \We've still got work to do\. \0. K.\ growled O'Chord,. \But tell dis slob ta lay offa me pets\. Later, after their gri£>ly task was completel', and the victims were snaking in the huge vats of formal- dehvde, our friends silt back for a little chat, sinre as Dr. Oxus ob- e<erved. it was too latr to ro to bed. Miss Sk111l, hearing mention of bPd now bee-an to perk up, and, w.inin\' the blood and matted hair ·off her dress. she covl:v turned to the f\en and simpered, \Ternis anyone?\ \Cawn't right now, old girl.\ said Dr. Scale, \you see I've got to pre- pare a lecture for my anatomy claw~s.\ \Oh hell, Doc\ pouted Rhynky. \Jet's just bat some balls around fer a while\. \Well. if you put it that way,\ leered the Doctor..

Few inventions have played a greater p!irt in shaping the world we live in! Since 1877-just one year after Bell's long experimentation was crowned with success-it has been Western Electric's privilege to help carry forward his great idea which gave wings to words. In that year Western Electric made its first telephone. More than 45,000,000 have followed it-over 4,000,000 of them in 1946 alone. Today, fro111 coast to coast, in factories, offices, distributing houses and central office installation crews, there are more than. 110,000 Western Electric workers. Imbued with the Bell System spirit of service, they are helping to provide equipment in record quantities to meet telephone needs far beyond any envisioned by the inventor. This year marks the 100th Anniversary of Bell's birth in Edinburgh, Scotland, on March 3. 1847. From early youth, he was keenly interested in aiding the hard of hearing. He became a teacher of \visible speech .. when 18 years old. This work led to experiments with \telegraphing\ sound, out c f which, in 1876, came his greatest invention -the telephone. Dr. Bell was a great humanitarian as well as ~great sci· entist. His accomplishments-in aiding the deaf, in com- munications, in aviation and other fields-were outstand· ing. His rich life-which had an incalculably great influ- ence on the world-came ro an end on August 2, 1922. West-ern Eltcfric AUNIT' OF tHE BELL @SYSTEM SING tBB2 Let the Buyer Be Sure!

FOUNDED AT UNION COLLEGE IN 1877 Vol. LXXIV;, No. 24 SCHENECTADY, N. Y., APRIL 15, 1947 Price JOe uy;HE RIVALS\ OPENS Open Letter : 1 Gentlemen: ·we have just returned fr·om what is ,probably one of the more .t•uccessful of the recent student body sessior: s . . . suc- cessful. that is, .J,n that there were fully 100 member:s of the student body pre sent. The term \successful\ is used advisedly sLnce the turnout for ye<•terday's meeting, broke the record for nun-point activities! Much criticism has been di- rected at {he Student Council ard at the Chapel system. Many have made the bland comment tha:t \if n0 .poi)lts were required, and the programs were interest- ing enough, the students would attend voluntarily\. To be sure, this sounds ideaL The catch in- volved is that we must fir.d '' some to a110use the latent,. ve1:y Iaten t, interest of the E•tudents. Evidently, something so unim- portant as the affairs of the student body docs not fulfill these qualifications. Evidently .. the college must offer some- , thing closer to home, rather than a:ttempting to burden the hard~worked student with his own affail•s and, to be more ac- curate, his own welfare here at Union. It seems apparent that cut- ting one's own throat is still in style here at the ·College. The students, by such action as this, are completely destroying what might have been an excellent case for a non-point chapel sys- tem. They are justifying the at- titude of the administration and no longer have too much right to argue against it. In the same breath, the neutrals are still re- fusing to. shoulder their propor- tion of re.-ponsibility in the stu- dent government. It was all well and good to become highly · indigmmt at rumours of frater- nitr caucuses and intrigues, but if those who objected to this piece .of realistic politics are not willing to effect any change, then we can be thanl,ful that the fraternity interest still ex- ists. It is obvious that someone must do the job. This is not designed to give the fraternities a clean slate, or to approve a student govern- ment controlled by a small group. It is. merely an attempt to point -out that no amount of talking will give Union the wide representative government that it should enjoy . .Action must be tal{en by those who have liter- (Continued on Page 3) To Star in To:monow's Opening Clark Potter, Robert Miller, and William Wat·ner .

In order to give the play as much as possible as it was presented in 1775, when it was written, the Mountebanks are going to dispense with the use of a curtain, using blackouts for scene changes. This represents the outdoors stage with- out a curtain that was used in Eng- land at the time of our Revolution. This carries out the Mountebanks' policy of continued work and ex- perimentation to produce better and better drama. The Board of Trustees of the col- leg.e have all been invited to attend the opening performance and sev- eral have accepted and will be present. Many of the Trustees of the various fraternities will also attend the opening. When Sheridan wrote \The Rivals\ he was young-, and fired with great energy and ambition. The play was originally about five hours long and because of this ex- cessive length was not very well re- ceived. Gradually the play has been cut down until the Theater Guild production on Broad.way a few years ago ran only about three hours. When the Mcuntebanl{s de· cided to produce it, several of the group got together with ;Director Robbins and cut it further until it came down to manageable size. The biggest difficulty was to keep the complicated plot intact without los· ing the light and spirited theme. The theater has been modernized in many ways since the last produc- tion. Biggest and most important of these is the new proscenium arch that replaces the old canvas and lathe arch.

('irt•ulation Jlannger Danger! Curve Ahead College students, quite occasionally, may be found indulg- ing in the time-honored practice of criticising the marking system in their institution. In the majority of cases, the criticism is just, but impractical. Due to size of classes and other factors, there isn't much we, as students, or our faculty can do. However, one of the current campus gripes deserves a line or two of comment. In some of the departments, which seem to adhere rather closely to what is known as normal \ABCD\ distribution of marks, arbitrarr drastic grade adjustments at the end of a marking period have recently been made. A man who made an 87 average found himself saddled with a C grade. If this practice becomes current in the courses lead- ing to graduate study, many deserving men, hoping for grad- uate school acceptance, will be sadly disappointed. Much of this mechanical type of marking may be due to over-sized classes and new instructors, but it seems rather shortsighted to mark all classes, no matter what their aver- age work, on the same scale. A curve is interesting but has its limitations, just as do the marks themselves. They are not an adequate judgement of work. They do not, if used religiously, give a true basis of comparison. An experienced teacher knows instinctively what he de- mands for any particular grade and makes his tests up ac- cordingly. Then, if he runs into a class high in intelligence, he will not fit his curves slavishly, but will mark each man on worth alone, even at the shame of handing in all A's and B's. The students would not be placed on the statistical rack. This editorial is meant as a genenil suggestion and as a reminder that marking policy constitutes a large part of stu- dent-teacher relations, unfortunately. If one consfders the other unfair, both are working at a disadvantage. Nuff said! Straw in the Wind If all the board walks in the pasture were laid end to end, is it possible they might reach Wildwood? Perhaps, now is the time to install adequate walks before the rainy season begins. Otherwise, Schenectady may have the distinction of possessing a miniature Venice, replete with Union College students paddling the existing walks as undersized mud- scows. L. H. C.

I do not pretend to be an author- ity en facts and figures, but it would be difficult to convince me that there is rr.ore than one out of one hundred student£· n Union who ~an appreciate the classical music offered at these recitals. This is cet tainly no reflection on the stu- dent body. Union is not a Con- :;:ervatoire. If I hadn't spent a small amount of time studying music, I wouldn't know what Bach's In_ven- tions were, not• Dupre's Vatiations. Frankly, I don't care, because music doesn't mean that much to me; and I feel that this is- the onin- ion of the majority of the men- on campus. To appreciate the heavy classics, they must be studied, or the listener must be endowed with an abnormal sense of music. Then why aren't these recitals planned for those who are expected to attend-and would if they were given what they want? Why is the student body expected to turn out enthusi9.stically to them?

Brooks Jr. This report discussed the presentation of keys by the various activities and made sug- gestions fer changes in the present rr.ethod of giving keys. The keyE', the comrr.ittee feels, should be given only to m(n in terrr:s six, seven, and eight . In addition these keys should be p1esent e d to men who have ~ent ' two years in an activ- ity . As a further modification it was recomrr: e nded that all keys · be standardized and a.Jso be of an im- p!Ov e d quality. Th e qu e stion of student partici - pation in extra-cun icul:u activities came up for discusdon again. The Boa I d of M a nagers stated that the existin g I . egulations that permit one activity to ~ man not on the Dean's Li8t are unfair. It is sugges-ted that instead, ali students in good st>nding be per · mitled to pa r tici- pate in unlimited activities .

EARL WARREN ~ermi to Talk AtGraduation President Carter Davidson has announced that Dr. Enrico Fermi , world famous atomic physicist, has been named as honorary chancellor of Union University for 1947-1948 . He will deliver the commencement adod.ress on June 8. It has also been announced that Gov.

Fingar '48, business manager; Douglas Maure '48, asS\istant busi- ness manager, and William Gietz ' 50, circulation manager . Under the new Publications Board constitu- tion, adopted at the sarr. e meeting which elected next year's officers, the IDOL is now constituted under a managing board, with specific titles assigned to each member. Re- tiring Chairman of the IDOL Board, Edward · C. Stefic ' 47, is the last man to hold office under that title. The new staff takes office immediately. New GARNET Staff Landry, as editor of the GAR- NET will have on the staff Ham- ilton Scheer '49 as busines manager, and Malcolm T. Hopkins '49 and Josef Weissberg '49 as a ssociate editor~. The current arrangement includes a Photographic Editor, whose duties will be asumed j.ointly by the associate editor Hopkins and Weissberg. The new GARNET staff takes office when the publication of the 1947 GARNET has been com- pleted. RECORD Revived Under Baa;r The Freshman RECORD will again be run by students under the supervision of the Undergraduate Publications Board, rather than by the Admissions Office. The new editor, Baar, will have working with him as assistant editors, Rich- ard Geyer '50, Richard Lie · b '51, and David Martin '50. This is a break with recent precedent in that the editor , immediately orior to the war, was a member of the gradual- · ing class. These men were recom- mended to the Publications Board by J. Harold Ripton '22, Director of Admissions , who handled the competition for the posts. Baar is a member .of Chi Psi fraternity, and is a past managing editor of the CONCORDIENSLS. He is head of the cheerleading squad, Student Council representative from the Class of ' 49, and a member of the Sophomore Discipline Committee.

Creation of a separate department of sociology at Union College under chairmanship of Dr. Arthur Kent Davis of Harvard University has been announced by Dr. Carter Davidson, Union College president. The new department will be an element in the division of social studies.

SWAN SONG It's been fun! · It seems about time for us to bow out. We don't have any particular thought at this time. Just kicking back through the year, we hope that we haven't hurt anyone with our well-meant slams and attacks. There have been times when this column has waxed wroth at the antics of certain campus personalities and activities. There have been other times when we have been tempted to throw in the towel from sheer frustration. Then, things began to straighten out, and, at this writing, the picture for the future seems promising. To the men with whom we have worked, and, sometimes, disagreed, thanks! We generally managed to get the paper out even if we had to cut each other's throats. There were slips like \Goldsmith's Rivals,\ and inaccuracies of other sorts. With the tolerant attitude of most of the student l.Jody, however, much of this has been forgotten. To the students who had to put up with our idiosyn- cracies, also many thanks! It's been fun! -J. HARMON ROUND TWO On April 7, the dormitory residents in North and South Colleges were required to pay an increased room rent, double the amount they had been paying up until that time. As the college announced last fall, the dormitory residents were to be charged half price as long as they were doubled up. This was all well and good. Everyone knew what was going to happen and they were more or less happy. In the last week prior to the mid-term vacation, the residents of overcrowded double rooms had to decide who was going to move to the pasture upon return to college. This decision was made according to the wishes of the men involved, but on very short notice. The new room rent was due the day the student body returned to the campus. Late payments were fined. HOWEVER-there was one flaw in the arrangement. Summer Session Pre .. Registration All students planning to attend the Summer Session should report to the Dean's Office Monday. Thez·e they will be given a sheet of pre-registration instruction.s and the necessary card:;;. These ca:vds must be pvoperly fi:lled out and returned to thib office by Saturday, April 26. In this way, plans can be made to :;~.ccommodate all Union men before applicants from other colleges are accepted for summer work. FRIDAY, APRIL 18, 1947 OUR STUDENT COUNCIL 'BY B. PIDLLIPS BARNI!.\T In correction of the Vets' Summer School announcement in Tuesday's CONCORDIENSIS, vetera:ns who are planning <m attending Union this summer do not have to see the training officer. The College plans on automatically continuing subsist- ence for these students. ·· The time has come for us to take a good look at the . existing set-up of the Student Council and its relation to the students on the campus.

THE IDOL Short Story Winners THE IDOL, Union College quarterly magazine, announces the following winners of THE IDOL Short Story Contest: First Prize: \These Flow the Blood\ by David Staub Second Prize: \Nightbreak\ by Daniel Smythe Judges for the contest were: Dr. Harold A. Blodgett, Mr. Arthur Phillips, Mr. Eugene Hayes, and THE IDOL board. These stories will be published in the May Issue of THE IDOL. Secondly, all conflicts between activities should be re- solved. The Constitution of the Tax Committee need not be at variance with that of the Student Council. In fact, it must not be. And last but far from least, the Student Council should bend its efforts toward becoming the instrument of the students. Open meetings would definitely be a step in the right direction. Definite attempts to bring up matters at meetings that the various representatives know to be of interest to the students would be a logical move. In short, make the Student Council a clear-cut, positive, democratic governing body. ~lllll!llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll~ li=========================:;-t = = Some of the single rooms were occupied by the same two who held them during the fall and winter.

Dr. Davidson told a Student Council committee that he thought those rooms which were not changed in occupancy should not be charged for at the increased rate. He ar- ranged to reopen the matter with the Comptroller. Regardless of their ultimate decision, it will not affect the administration initial failure to handle the situation without creating ill-will among the students. · The administration was at fault in the following respects: insufficient notice was given the men who were forced to move, and no provision was made for charging equitable rents based on accommodations. Third, but foremost, the students were forced to consult the President in order to receive the cooperation which the Comptroller's office had failed to display. In our opinion, the President should not have had to be bothered. It should have been settled before- hand in a way that would be acceptable to the students. This entire episode seems to be further evidence of the poor \student relations\ policy of the administration. Some of this may be due to the rapid change of command, as was the matter of the \final-less\ exam announcement, but the college should recognize that students deserve more timely word on their affairs. -L.

Goss was granted the Coffin Award recently, he received the highest honor the General Electric Company bestows upon its employees. The story be- hind the award went back to the days before Pearl Harbor. Then, drawing upon his nine years of special studies in meters and instruments with General Electric, Jim was able to de- velop a glass Vee jewel as a substitute for the hard-to-get sapphires used as instrument bearings. Mass production of the jewel cracked the bottleneck in bearings and en- abled us to meet the wartime need for in- struments. Jim began his specialization in meter and instrument problems when he was first as- signed to the Works Laboratory of G.E.'s West I\ynn Mass. plant in 1931. His work with instrument magnets, bearings and lu- bricants made him a leader in the field. In 1986,, at the age of 28, he became the En- gineer in Charge of the Laboratory, and was later named Technical Assistant to the Works Engineer. Next to schools and the U.S. Government, General Electric employs more college engineering graduales than any other organization. Jim Goss became a registered pharmacist at sixteen. By working as a relief. pharma· cist, he helped pay his college expenses. In his work tdday as Engineer in Charge of a G-E Works Laboratory, Jim directs re· search on meters and instrument problems.

FRIDAY, APRIL 18, 1947 OUR STUDENT COUNClL By B. PffiLLIPS BARNI!..'T The time has come for us to take a good look at the existing set-up of the Student Council and its relation to the students on the campus. The Constitution now in force should be given a cardr;. to thih J , ,· has bee11 in operation for a full year and the passage of time be made from other seems to have revealed certain basic flaws in its construc- in planning on the training uing subsist- tion. This Constitution is perhaps one of the most am- biguous pieces of supposedly definitive writing that has come this way in a Iong time. It 111ight be \Veil to point out a few of the inconsisteHcies , that exist iR the charte1· of the students' governing body. The most glaring example is the situation that exists in the provisions fo1· ameNding the Constitution. In one place a n1.ethod is provided where a vote of the student body is sufficient; another way is described whereby the Student Council itself may introduce changes. But, wonder of won- ders, no mention is made as to which plan is preferred, which comes first, or if both are necessary. · ~~~.~~~.' Another arguing point is the subject of the Treasurer of the Student Council. According· to the Student Coundl -:- ~ 1 Constitution, the Council Treasurer is eiected by vote of the '- :!?.J1 Student Body. Said Treasurer is also to be head of the Tax \~_ .. Committee. The joker lies in the fact that the Tax Com- ~ ,j mittee Constitution states that the Chairman of the Tax This classic of the author\s perform- the cast, the s reviewer that o present befon• Committee the selection ol in their an affected Committee is a Senior who has been appointed the preceding year to membership on the Committee. Now, we would lil<e to know if the Tax Committee picks the Treasurer of the Student Council, or if the Student Body elects a Treasurer who is also head of the Tax Committee. Enough said on the inconsistencies of the Constitution . There are certain other bones to be picked with the way the Council itself is to be organized. For instance, the President of the Council was elected by vote of the Student Body, but the Council itself selected the nominees for th_e hat leaves some- position from its own members. In short, the Council ~s an irascible, actually possesses the power of naming the President with gout, presents the Student Body holding only the limited right of counter- of an signing the Council's o1·ders. The proper method of naming the las· the Student Council President might be to place the names time; hiso por· of all Senior members upon one ballot and have all such men lines the many t his stubborn candidates for the post in an open election. dmit are beyond The Constitution itself is not the only weak spot in the Clark Potter, pictures of pursuing assur· interesting pat- an excellent foil demands to Harmon, Lloyd '\Vissof bl'ing in their delina· Century \char· a::; Mr.s.

The Student Council is supposedly the ~lected o·t·oup ·representing the students on the campus. In most su~h bodies, the meetings are open to the constituents. Our Student Council meets behind closed doors; the results of said meetings reach the students at the whim of the Council. Not only are mattet·s often discussed concerning ·which the students are unaware, but decisions are often made in vvhich they have no voice. In other words, once elected, the Student Council is no longer the servant of the student, but his master. It is highly debatable as to whether br not this is exactly a desirable situation. In fact, as time progresses it becomes increasi.ngly obvious that the Student Council as it exists here on the campus i:::; in need of some major overhauls. Overlooking for the moment the possibility that we might scrap the whole business and start over, we will try to present a few suggestions that cannot help but improve the present dis- turuing conditions. We doubt that these proposed changes will be made, but we will suggest them anyway in the vague hope that even Union inertia must end someday. The first and most vital step is a complete clarification of the Constitution of the Student Council. There is no room for ambiguity or vagueness in such a document. The Constitution should set forth all the rights and limitations in such language that there is no room for conflicting inter- pretation. This year's Council should not have to guess ............. ,....- ...... __.,..,~,..,.... ............. .,., what last year's Council meant. nnounces the Mr. of THE - - - - - - =I - - - - - - - - - Secondly, all conflicts between activities should be re- solved. The Constitution of the Tax Committee need not be at variance with that of the Student Council. In fact, it must not be. And last but far from least, the Student Council should bend its efforts toward becoming the instrument of the students. Open meetings would definitely be a step in the right direction. Definite attempts to bring up matters at ·meetings that the various representatives know to be of interest to the students would be a logical move. In short, make the Student Council a clear-cut, positive, democratic governing body. WE KNOW YOU WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE JAY JEWELRY CO.

Brooks has been managing editor during the current school year, and moves up to take over the editor's position. Joseph Enzer, the new managing editor, has been in charge of the underclas& edit0rial staff during this .past year. Brooks, in addition to his work .on the IDOL, has been on the staff of both the CONCORDIENSIS and the GARNET. He is a member of the Board of Managers, and is- a representative from that group sit- ting on the Student Council. Elected to Hale Club last March, Br.ooks is an English major.

New Coostitution Approved At the same meeting which elect- ed the ·officers of the four under- graduate publications, 1:\ new con- stitution for the Publications Board was approved. This constitution omits President Davidson, at bis own request due to press of other duties, as a member. Dean C. William Huntley is ex-officio presi- dent of the Board. The constitution provides for the election of one of the undergraduate members a& secretary of the Board. Membership on the Board is made up as follows, according to the new regulations: the editor and the business manager of the CON- CORDIENSIS, IDOL, and GARNET and the editor of the Freshman RECORD; one merr.ber of the .Stu- dent Tax Committee, to be selected by that committee, and three mem- bers of the faculty, to be appointed by the President of the College. The Coordinator f .Student Activi- ties and the Director of Public Re- J.ations sit on the Board, and may initiate motions, but they have no vote. The old constitution provided ma- chinery for handling the finances of the undergraduate publications, the function for which the Bo'l.rd waso primarily established. Financial matters may be appr.aved or dis- approved by the Board, but the final responsibility rests with the Student Tax Committee.

In the April issue of the UNION ALUl\1- NUS, hidden in one of the center pages, is a statement that might well raise the eye- brows of many students, for it definitely cmHmits the coHege to a program of plan- ning that has long been in the offing. The article referred to is the financial statement and A LOOK TO\\'ARD THE FUTURE. The lounges now open are woefully incapable Last week this column was de- read somewhat a:s foHows.

The following plan is proposed. The body as a whole. In many matters Constitution should be amended to such as rushing, pledging, and fra- College remains quite uninsured against ternity powers, the fraternitioes alone set the policy. These matters are often of prime importance to the eatire college. It should be, therefore, within the scope of the Student Council to .nullify any de- cision of the Interfrate1•nity Coun- cil that appears to be not in the best inte1•ests of the whole student body. It might be well to set up a boat·d composed ·Of the Dean, the President of the Student Council, the Coordinator of Activities, and the President of the Interfraternity Council tad decide what matters would come under such an author- ity. Natura:Hy, some decisions are peculiar to the needs of the .fra- ternities, but others transcend the narrow lines of demarcation and touch on the rights and privileges of all students. A third and vital change is the opening of all Student Council meetings to the students. Even the Congress of the United States is not so impressed with its own power that it feels empowered to exclude the citizenry from its ses· sions. After a:H, these meetings are supposedly for the benefit of the majority of the students. What goes on behind t~ose closed doors that the Council feels cannot beat• the light of general scrutiny of the public? Does not a constituent have the right to kn.ow h(!)W his representative is voting on matters that may be of prime importance to himself. Therefore it is im- perative in the interest of clean and honest government that any student may attend the meetings of the Council to assure himself that his elected representative is doi:Ug his intended job. Otherwise the CouncH can become a very power- ful organization responsible only to itself. The main gist of the statement, covered more completely on page one, is that the col- lege needs financial support for the construc- tion of five new, badly-needed buildings and the endowment of eighteen professorships. Now this should present an answer to a valid question asked by man~· students of late: IS L'r-.JION GOING TO THJNK S:\IALL OR THINK BIG'? the all-too-conceivable installation of leaders who are not only incapable of discharging their offices, but who may not even be crowned by popular choice. :\lay we make so bold to suggest that our readers lubricate the vox populi and give vent to theit· own ideas in liquida- ting what amounts every time to a par- liamentary scandal?\ !,etters .to the Editor An open letter to the writer of \Name Withheld\: THE DEAL :\lany viewed with alarm the picayune way in which the college has handled some of the athletes undel' its control. In other ways, this seemed to be the general trend, to rest on the acquil·ed tradition and past laurelg of other generations. However, the present ad- ministration has clearly seen the danger of complacency and has taken concrete, if only embryonic, steps in raising the calibre of education and life at LJnion. No longer should the average man feel that he is just another sliver on just another piece of dead- wood. Student Support Vital Important as is alumni financial support, equally necessary is student interest and ef- fort in this progTam. First, these men will someday be alumni. Second, at the present, they can be ambassadors, publicity agents if you will, for the college. Third, they can give the undergraduate's view on necessary im- provements, which is many times an excel- lent guide. As an instance of the latter, sug- gestions for a fraternity row, a new gym, and even a carefully worked out plan for leveling the pastme and constructing dorm- itories there, have come from the students. The spirit now lacking at Union, the in- tel'est in the college, is the one thing which can bring about the desired cooperation. If the administration means to foster this feel- ing in future classes, it must appeal directly to the students when they first register, in- stead of allowing the freshmen to become attached first to the fraternity and then, al- most incidentally, attached to the college. Possible Solutions The important unit in the campus life, as impressed on the incoming freshman, is the fratemit~·. Finally, after several hectic months, he becomes awm·e that he is in- cluded in a larger group, the college. There- fore, deferred rushing is one solution. An- other is greater emphasis on the class as an entity. Of late, little has been done to pro- mote adequate class meetings and social functions, and this is important in that these cut across the boundaries of egocentric cliques of all sorts, and form a direct tie to the college. The first step, as mentioned above, should include a better indoctrination of the new men IN THE COLLEGE, BE- FORE allegiance is claimed elsewhere.

Non-Sectarian? Last Sunday, the audience at the services in Memorial Chapel was greeted by the sight of a silver cross innocently reposing on the new Memorial Table. This is a commitment to one type of reli- gion at the expense of others. The Chaplain must realize that the Jewish faith, as well as several Protestant faiths, do not recog- nize this particular symbol. For these, the chapel is no longer non-sectarian, since it runs counter to their beliefs. Second in order of complaints is that a general place of assembly should not be used for a strictly religious service. Does this seem rather incongruous or are we old-fash- ioned? NOTICES .

There are unlimited possibilities for making chapel the entertainment spot of the town. But let me ask you that question again, Why are you here? We are supposed to be developing into university men.

Two weeks ago, a Sub-Committee of the Committee en Veteran's of the House of Representatives met under the chairmanship of H. A. Ramey of Ohio. Representatives of Minne£•ota, Cincinnati, Indiana, Colgate and Union appeared to tes- tify regarding the question of whether or not the present subsist- ence benefits. of the G. I. Bill of Rights should be raised·. According to the recent college survey made, the following infor- mation was given concerning Union students: The average single veteran at Union College spends $67.14 fo1· board and room and dur- ing a month will spend $100.32. Ninety-one percent of our single veterans have spent an average of $213 of their personal funds since they began training under the· pro- visions of the G. L BiH of Rights. Twenty percent of Union's single veterans work and they receive an ave1 age income per month of $29.16. Twenty-three percent of our veterans do not anticipate financial Jifficulty for the remainder of tneu .:>Chooling. Of the seventy-seven percent that do anticipate such dif- ficulties, fifty percent expect them at the undergraduate level and twenty-seven percent at the grad- uate' level. The married veterans at Union average $39.43 for rent and $64.92 for food each month. This consti- tutes $114.35 of an average monthly expenditure of $163,24. Ninety-three percent of these veterans have a.veragcd expenditures of $457.50 from their personal funds; eighteen percent have received aid from their parents for an average of · $179.41. Forty percent of the mar- ried veterans work as contrasted with twenty percent of the single veterans, and their average income is quite a little higher being. $40.58 per month.

Seventy-tom· per- cent of the married veterans anti- cipate financial difficulties before their schooling is completed, sixty- one percent at the undergraduate level and thirteen percent at the graduate level. The Sub-Committee,. hearing this testimony, gave some evidence of their feelings regarding the ques- tion under discussion. It was stated afte1· the meeting, that if a bill could be pushed through the Rules Committee to the floor of the House raising the present subsist- ence allotments to a reasonable figure it would be sure to cari'y. The Veterans Administration has ruled that where a veteran and his wife both are attending school un- der the G. I. Bill, each may receive the maximum of $90 per month al- lowance providing that they have a child. Under this ruling the wife is the dependent of the husband and the child is the dependent of the mother. For some time in Washington there has been discussion as to the successor of General Omar· Brad- ley. Candidates at the .present time seem to be narrowing down to Ma- jot· General Lewis B, Hershey, Win- throp Rockefeller, and Julius Krug, among others. Representative Mitchell is plan- ning to introduce a bill in Con- gres:;., according to reports, provid- ing that regularly enlisted men promoted to commission status in wartime and serving under combat conditions shall permanently retain their ranks under certain circum- stances. The U. S. Employment Service has taken over the responsibility for aiding war veterans in regain~ ing their old jobs after discharg.e. This is no little task inasmuch as 50,000 men are still being dis- charged each month.

Comptroller~s Housing Statement As a re:oult of the administration's announcement of a rise in the rental tee of dormitory rooms, many points raised by student discussion need clarification. In the f.lrst place, all rooms were classl.fied in April 1946 as to numbers in occupancy, and the normal rental charge was fixed at 75 dollars per man for each semester. But with the increased enrol'lment in September, students were forced to double up, their rent being halved, This condition was thought of as only temporary because of the· construction of FHA dormitorie~. The prolonged delay in their completion could not be J.oreseen, and now that all but two of them are housing men, college dormitory taci!itie,; are semewhat near normal. This means a teturn to established rates as set by college authorities, with the exception of student~ who occupy ;;ingle rooms without having re- quested them. 'l'hey are required to pay 75 dollars a semester, not l>l:! dollars as. pr8scribed .in the budget. It must be r~membered that the dormitories ace \perating on a non-prof.it basis, and if, in the future, pt tces continue to rise, it may be neces,;ary to make adjustmems. tn any event, students wiU be notiried well in advance or pt·oposed changes so that an understand- ing may be reached.

NUSBAUM~S ==ARROW SPORTS -SHilTS=~ 3 Doty Explains Interests; Purposes of Relations Club By ,JOISEPH D. DOTY ~ --------- Professor of History, IRC Advisoi'I What has a student the right to expect fron1 his extra-cun·icular activity, that activity which inevit- ably makes such heavy demand,; upon his time? The officers and members of the Union College In- ternational Relation:; Club have se1 iously aslted themselve,;~ this question and have arrived at a broad, genera·! answet. They have souo-ht thi;; answet· with an possi- ble\' frankness because it not only· implies a goal to be striven for but' also establishes a cl'iterion b:~< which the value of the club and its work may be judged. An extra-curricular activity ;;hould be interesting and even en- tertaining and, beyond that, should have enduring intellectual and edu- cational value. A student hw a right to expect to find both of these qualities in his extra-cunicu- lar activity. The I. R. C. endeavor,; to offer both and it judges its wot·k by the standard which is thus set up. Value of Club The more important question re- lates to the sound intellectual and educationa.J value of the work. The general purpose of the club is to stimulate interest in and pro\ide a better understanding of interna- tional problems. The end in view is to help maintain world peace, if possible, under United States lead- ership. It is assumed that eve·ryone- who knows anything at all about the present world situation and the natm·e of modern war will admit that this general purpose is of the highest order of importance. To achieve its purpo~es the I. R. C. canie~ on its work through meetings of various kinds includi'ng the showing of the best films avail- able, the sponsoring of conferences· on the college campus and partici- pation in conference~ held else- where, in the meeting of commit- tees for planning and administr a- tion and, ·above all, in regular, pub- lic fortnightly meetings. The club is not a spectator activ- ity, pleasant and restful though that sort of thing may be, nor is it designed to interest a select few. Not only at·e all college students invtt;;d to attend all meetings but thev are urged to do so. Moreover, the regular fortnightly meeting as the central activity of the club is so planned that a qualified speaker presents a topic. His address is fol- lowed by a period in which all per- sons present are invited to take part in the rn.eeting by raising questions, expressing opinions, and in general testing their ideas by the opinions of others, Future Plans Perhaps a bri.ef statement of the recent work of the club and its fu- ture plans will prove to be the mo~t effective method of present- ing to the ·interesting per,;on a basis fo1· judgment. The best avail- able film on contemporary Russia has been shown. A delegation of member,; represented the club at a regional conference on interna- tional affair~ last fall and will again attend a :,;imilat· conference in Washington next fall. Within two weeks the club will take part f,n· the second consecutive year in a conference for high school stu- dents. This cenference will bring ovet• two-hundred high school stu- dents to the campus, will hold its meetings in Bailey Hall and the Old Chap~! '3.nd over thirty col·lege students will take part as Ieade1s. Past Record The regular fol'tnightly meeting remains, however, the chief activity of the club. Dr. H. A. Larrabee, Ichabod Spencer Profe..sm of Phil- osophy spoke on the Nuremberg trials. Taking the position that these trials were legal and of last- ing ,nternational value he present- ed much weighty opinion well-sup- ported by reliable knowledge. Dean Andrew Clements of the Albany Law School, in a joint meeting of the I. R. C. and its younger brother The Society of Pre-Law Students, also spoke on the Nurem- berg trials. With much wit and legal knowledge he saw the trials as extra-legal and a bad precedent. Mr. Jo~eph Rotundo, in his inim- itable way, spoke on the United States and world leadership and Mr. Joseph Finkelstein analyzed Sumner Welles' outstanding book in the field of international affairs.

Of the men who filled out the question sheet, two out of three <•tate that the qualiy of food is not in proportion to the price paid for it, and that they would be unwill- ing to pay more for better quality meals. They did agree, however, that a choice of only one type of meal would be satisfactory if a higher grade of food were obtained. One question on the sheet asked for specific objections to dinir.g fa- cilities and suggestions for im- provement. Students complained of stale bread and sour milk, dirty silverware and dishes,. haphazard planning of diet, careleE>s prepara- tion of meals, and inefficiency at the lunch counter. Besides asking for the elimination of these condi- tions, men suggested that the I menu be posted two or three days 1 ahead, and that recorded music be 1 RIP•fON- rconunuect from Page 1 > rial about Union are mailed every month. Twelve regional .Memol'ial Schol- arships have been announced in schools throughout •the country l::>Y the Office. The regions covered include New England, California, the Mid-West, New Je!'sey and sev- eral other sections of the countl·y. Ripton noted that these sche>lar- ships have helped publicize the name of Union, although no defi- nite results have been recorded yet. Applications f0r admission next fall are no longer being received, as of Tuesday. The Committee on Admissions will make its final se- lections sometime during the next month. Ripton said that he b.e- lieves this to be the earliest closing date for acceptance of applications in the history of the College, a move necessitated by the large number of applications. Next year's entering class will probably directly reverse last fall's trend in veteran-non-veteran pro- portions according to Ripton. He expects the incoming class to be composed of 60-65 percent non-vet- erans. However, he emphasized the fact that there were no quotas and that the best men will be se- lected regardless of their military status.
