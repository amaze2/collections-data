Cooperation It> Essential \College is a cooperative enter- prbe. l!:veryone connected with it is expert in oome part of the work. Each agency is important and essential. Looseness of methods, cat elcssness in operation, indiffer- ence in accomplishment these can- not be tolerated. Perfection of the whole is dependent upon the perfec- tion of each part. Perfection of each part is encouraged and recog- nized, and the whole is the accom- plished of the college for Union College, the intellectual advance- ment of youth.\ He said the two chief agencies for the accomplishment of this aim are youth itself, and the faculty of the college. \Here is the realiza- tion of the Union College motto. 'We are all brothers under the laws of Minerva.'\ The three fundamental laws of Minerva were described by Dr. Ellery who said that they would produce intellectual advancement on a sound physical basi» which, if properly directed, leads inevitably to profound spiritua.I result,;. He tllu~trated this point by comparing 1t to the over-empha:;is of athlettcs 1 Continued on Page 6> bany; Roy Moon, Catskill; and Ric hat d Kennedy, Champlain; Donald Liffitun, Albany; Perriak Sherman, Flushing, L.

On ?>lovembcr 24, the new mar- ble :;eat around the flagpole will be unveiled as a memorial to the founders of the Psi Upsilon fra- tPz nity.

September, 1933 Dear l.'ndergt actuates: Since I was ill last semester and resigned in August, I have had no opportunity of bidding you an official good-by€'. This letter must take thE> place, then, of a hand-shake and a spoken word. You know that I am very fond of you, and that I have al- way~ gloried in your successes and z <\gretted your discomfort- ures. In my four and a half years at Union I can call to mind no undergraduate who has dune lllt' an ill-turn or given me misinfor rna tion: on the other hand you have been full of kind- ness. consideration and good- wilL I have many friends among you that I ,;hall alway,; remem- ber. Mrs. Day and Donald and I are living in our house in Nova Scotia and I am bu:oy converting it from a summer into a winter home. Here the brisk September windy weather is already begin- ning to twirl leaves across the bluest of skies. So invigorating i::; the air that this morning I got out my hack-saw and began to cut up stove and fire-place wood. Donald and I have already piled the cellar high with wood. Next week I am going to have a couple of men help me put a stone wall under my west sill, and then I ,-hall be pretty snug for winter. You can think of me this winter. if you think at all, a~ reading and writing be- fore a big log fire. Except for the war years this will be the first September for over thirty years that I have not bGen associated with some col- lege, and as Union opens I shall miss your vuices around the Ad- mini,;tration Building as you pick up freshman for your fra- ternities, I shall miss watching you at practice and in games, I !'hall miss your singing in ChapeL I hope you'll remember some of the things I've told you: \Learn to endure,\ \Learn a lit- tle ~toicism.'' \Learn to take them on the chin and come up smiling as long as you can stand and see.'' Good-bye, Union Un- derg-raduates; I shall always think of you with pleasure. FRANK P. DAY. I also want to say good-bye and good luck to my many friends among the students. MABEL K.

Distinguished as Scholar Distinguished as a scholar, sol- dier, teacher and admini»trator, Dr. Day became head of Union only four and one half years ago, but In thdt comparatively short time ,.,t hi:-; maz k on the institution. Popular with students and fac- ulty alikc>, his administration came to be refPn-ed to as \a new day for Union College.\ During his te-nure, the college ac- quired a biology building, an elec- tz·ical .. nginl'ering building. and the :\1ountebanks theater, as well as Gtaduate Council field, a hockey 1 ink and more t.mnis courts. Dr. Day i:,; credited as having strengthPhed the faculty and im- ]Jt·oved the curricula. His speech before the National Athletic Association~ following the Carnegie report, became the basis for revision of athletic policie~ not only for Union, but many other col- leges throughout the country. He combined the civil, mechan- ical and electrical eng-ineering de- partments undPr Dean Ernst J. BE'rg. This combination was his fiz·~t ~tep toward the organization of thp collPge on a divisional basis rather· than on the departmental plan. The systl'm of honor course:; was al~o introduced by him, and h<' also c>stablishcd the system of alumni scholarships, which are sup- ported by variou:; alumni groups. Oxford and Berlin A RhodPs Scholar from Canada, nnd 'In honors man both at Oxfot d and Berlin, Dr. Day was full pro- fessor at the age of 28. At the be- ginnmg· of the World \Var he left the Carnegie Institute of Technol- ~p;y, where he was head of the Eng- lish de paz tment to recruit and train the 128th Infantry Battalion, Cape Brc>ton Highland~rs. In Franct> he commanded thl' 25th Nova Scotia Battalion and on his return from the war' he was made both dean and director at the Carneg-iE' Institute of Technology. Later he became profes:>or of Eng- lish at Rwarthmore, and from there went t0 Union as Pre,;ident in No- VPmbc>r, 1928. He was inaugurated May 4, 1929. t~rially. upbuilding steadily smee he bl'came president less ~han fiv£> yPars ago.

September, 1933 Dear L'ndergraduates: Since I was ill last semester and resigned in August, I have had no opportunity of bidding you an official good-bye. This letter must take the place, then, of a hand-shake and a spoken word. You know that I am very fond of you, and that I have al- ways gloried in your successes and regretted your discomfort- ures. In my four and a half years at Union I can call to mind no undergraduate who has done me an ill-turn or given me mi:oinformation; on the other hand you have been full of kind- ne::;:;, cun:oideratiun and good- will. I have many friends among you that I shall always remem- ber. Mrs. Day and Donald and I are living in our house in Nova Scotia and I am busy converting it from a summer into a winter home. Here the brisk September windy weather is already begin- ning to twirl leaves across the bluest of skies. So invigorating is the air that this morning I got out my hack-saw and began to cut up ::;tove and fire-place wood. Donald and I have already piled the cellar high with wood. Next week I am going to have a couple of men help me put a stone wall under my west sill, and then I shall be pretty snug for winter. You can think of me this winter, if you think at all, a!! reading and writing be- fore a big log fire. Except for the war years this will be the first September for over thirty years that I have not b!ien associated with some col- lege, and as Union opens I shall miss your voices around the Ad- ministration Building as you pick up freshman for your fra- ternities, I shall miss watching you at practice and in games, I ~hall miss your singing in Chapel. I hope you'll remember some of the things I've told you: \Learn to endure.'' \Learn a lit- tle stoicism.\ \Learn to take them on the chin and come up smiling as long as you can stand and see.\ Good-bye, Union Un- dergraduates; I shall always think of you with pleasure. FRANK P. DAY. I also want to say good-bye and good luck to my many friends among the students. MABEL K. DAY Lake Am1is, Nova Scotia. Many Papers Quote Day's Resignation Retiring Prt>si~ent Editorially . by Newspapers in --+-- Acclaimed Numerous the East \Vhen WOI d was flashed over the wrres that Dr. Frank Parker Day was forced to resign the presidency of Union College because of ill health, hundreds of new:opapers, large and small, :r;nade room for the news. Many editors, realizing the t1 ue worth of thd. fonner president, expressed their plaises of his work and their sincet-e regrets for his illness. An editm ial ili the Schenectady Union-Star, after de:>cribing fully Dr. Day's aims and achievements in libetal education, sums up his accomplishments· and p.ersonality a~ follows: A man of broad culture, a Rhodes scholat;, a master of English letters, an athlete and a devotee of virile sports, he 1 Dr. Dayl brought to the presi- drncy of Union idE'als of schol- arship which are both sound and high Withal. he ex!'rcisPd a winning pPrsonality on the community. On' those occasions when \town and gown\ com- mingled during his administra- tion, he tinged the meetings with a d~lightful whimsicality. The history of, Dr. Day's policy, \Athletics for All,\ is told briefly on the editorial ,page of the Sche- nectady Gazette: Distinguished as Scholar Distinguished as a scholar, sol- diet', teacher and administrator, Dr. Day became head of Union only four and one ha:lf years ago, but in that comparatively short time >et his mark on the institution. Popular with students and fac- ulty alike, his administration came to be referred to as \a new day for Union College.\ During his tenure, the college ac- quired a biology building, an elec- trical engineering building, and the Mountebanks theater, as well as Graduate Council field, a hockey rink and more tennis courts. Dl'. Day is credited as l:}aving strengthened the faculty and im- proved the curricula. His speech before the Na:tional Athletic Association,. following the Carnegie report, became the basis for revision of athletic policies not only for Union, but many other col- leges throughout the country. He combined the civil, mechan- ical and electrical engineering de- partments under Dean Ernst J. Berg. This combination was his first step toward the organization of the college on a divisional basis rather than on the departmental plan. The system of honor courses was also introduced by him, and hf' also E'stablished the system of alumni scholarships, which are sup- ported by various alumni groups. Oxford and Berlin A Rhodes Scholar from Canada, and an honors man both at Oxford and Berlin, Dr. Day was full pro- fessor at the age of 28. At the be- girtmng of the World War he left the Carnegie Institute of Technol- ~gy, where he was head of the Eng- lish department to recruit and train the 128th Ihfa:ntry Battallon . Cape Breton Highlanders. ' Dr. Day came at a time when the tendency o,f Americ:m col- IPgP;; to PmphasizP athletics, often at thP PXp<'nsP of educa-- tion. was rPaching its climax. RPcognizin'-' thP advE'rtising vahrP to an institution of grid- iron succpsqpg, there npverthe- 1\\~ wag q trPnr! toward giving thiR unrluP importanf'P. Relieving that it is far bPtter for thf' !'tur!Pnt hnrlv to f'nnsist of many men 6f broad mental and phyF~ica·l training than of a f<'w specialists. PrPsident Day r!Pvot<>d muf'h effort toward this l>nd FurthPr, contrary to hr practice of somP Pducn.tional institution head!! of holding thPmF:elveg aloof from the stu- rlE'nt,:, he took d£>1ight in mln~­ ling with th!'m and in helping to spread the democratic at- moRph<>rP that traditioi1 makes pa 1 t of a f'Oil<'ge. In France he commanded the 25th Nova Scotia Battalion, and on his return from the war he was ~·made both dean and director at the Ca:rn~gie Institute of Technology. J:ater he. became professor of Eng- hsh at Swarthmore, and from there went to Union as President in No- vember, 1928. He was inaugurated May 4, 1929. Another typical editot ia 1 is the one from the Albany News. The resignation of Dr. Frank Parker Day as president of Union Colle;!e brings regret to everyone in this section, who knows him 01 knows the work he has done. A man of liberal mind, of high ideals, combined with ent:igy and executive abil- ity Dr. Day has left his impte:>- sion permanently on Union. He has heightened the college's in- fluence educationally and ma• terially, upbui!ding steadily since he became president less than five years ago. He had the confidence and high rPgard of students who nppreciatf'd his manliness and his Rincet ity and interest. He re~igns because of ill health and it iR a common wish of P\~rryone that he will regain hi~> hf'rtlth within a short time. The Troy Record also expresses regret, realizing the scarcity of ex- ecutives of his calibre: Not only Unir.n CollegE' but a wide and growing circle of ad- mirer\ regret that poor health has required Dr. Frank P. Day to resign as president of the falllUU8 institut..Ion of learning. The hope is sinceru that he will recover speedily, for educators of his type and ability arfi! alto- gether too few.

He had a genuine a;ffection for the under- graduates, was always ready tto give sincere, kind, and friendly advice to students who came to him, .and frequently .entered into an intimate conversation with them.

WELCOME FRESHMEN To you two hundred forty members of the class of 1937, The Concordiensis extends a most hearty welcome, and best wishes for a successful college career.

RANDOM IO'J~:SERYATJO'NS MUSIC by Rankine Hinme~n Lately the papers have been full of talk and more talk about the NRA. Editorial· writers have brought forth all their guns to boom the Blue ·magle .parade on its way to victory and resultant recovery'· for the nation. They all bear· out the fact that such basic in- dustries as steel, textiles and, railroads a·re picking up pro-· duction. Basic industries in a · healthy state, they maintain, : give true indication that ·na-' · tiona! recovery from depres-· sion is at hand. However, this betterment of . conditions may be a: mere il- lusion brought on by the use of economic drugs-the NRA with its bounties to farmers, extra tariffs, taxes, price fix- ing. In spite of all this, can we honestly say that our basic · ind ustrdes are really recover- ing? Surely, say the big-wigs. Steel is worll:ing overtime, the textiles are going full blast, and the railway carriers are picking themselves out of the slump of depres&ion yea:rs, all this an indication that timer are getting better. Could rtot. these symptoms of recovery b, regarded from another a>ngle 'i Let us call in Mr, Freud of . Vienna and give the whole sit uation a psychological aspect .

What t•hen? Let Mr. Freud answer that one, or at least assure u& that no such thing will occur. Industry and Life We speak of industry and never seem to tie it up except remotely with human life. A steel mill or a: factory is a· place where men work and get paid certain monies which they in turn spend for steel and' clothes and thus keep them-' selves working, This is the so- called scientific economic set- up. From the dawn of life on earth, even among the protozoa there can be distinguished a constant seeking for shelter, for protection from the ele- ments, for food. With the ad- vent of man there ca:me also a seeking for protection from other animals, and especially himself. Man's greatest enemy. has always been man. At one time he protected himself with a stout spear and a shield, now he does the same thing by do- This and That ·~im the only thing worthwhile •Ul life was to get all the money you can. ·He was amused when I told him it had taught me quite •the contrary.

Yet it is ea.Sy to see that the freshman regulations· are necessary as a mild disciplinary· measure. The fresh is worn pri- marily because it is the most rapid medium of promoting acquaint- anceship.

Sophomore Notice FOLLOWING TilE COLUMNS Besides following the sports I followed several columnists, not to steal their style<~, but to see how certain \\Titers compu·ed with their colleagues o.r rivals as the case may be. Among those I followed <•losely Wf'rf' Paul Galli<'o of the Dnily News, Dan Parker of the Mir- ror, Alan Gould of the Associated Press, Grantland Rice, a syndicate writer, Jolm Kieran of tbe Nf'w York Times, our own George Daley and W. 0. ~lcGeeha.n of the Herald Tribune, Joe Williams of the Telegram, several local writers of the Capital District of tl:Us State, and some that I followed for a few weeks in the mid-west on a short sight-seeing trip to the Century of' Progress Exposition. I hate to openly say just what I thinlt of these w1iters as they are top notch men, but there is not a man that can C()mpare with John Kiemn when it comes to clean, wholesome w1•iting. Iileran has the best of them t~topped but his popularity is confuted to a certain few who take the time off f1•om the hugh paper he writes for and reads this sport column. Gallico and Parlter iwrite for tlie New York Tabloids and their styles depend on theil' I'eaders.

To lay solid foundations in fundamen- tal fields of study before digging deeply into a :>ingle field is a very difficult undertaking.

He may be capable uf takmg the point of vww of the mmd approaching the field for the first time, of making clear the fundamentals upon which his specialty is based, in other words, he may be able as a teacher and interested in fellow beings.

Fox, captain of football, hockey player, and Student Coun- cilman, gave a clear c_ut presenta- tion of the issue, showmg the Ath- letic Board's action to be justified. To meet the chief argument of the Athletic Board-\unfavorable wea:ther causes too many cancella- tions with 'loss of guarantee\-Fox propesed that a reg~Ia;r rink be. established on Manav1lle Lake, where one thousand feet higher altitude keeps the ice sufficiently strong for use all season. Another Athletic Board argument -\coaching is too expensi:ve\-Fox refuted with the statement that two men connected with the college had voluntarily offered their services as coaches for the team. These two men, Mr. H. Laurence Achilles an-d Dr. Leonard B. Clark, have worked with the team before, and both are thoroughly acquainted with .the game. Condueted At Reduced Cost !:<'ox: concluded his speech with a list of six reasons why hockey should be reo-established as a minor sport, chief of which was number five, \That hockey can be conduct- ed at a greatly reduced cost so that any loss would be almost negligi- ble.\ When the student body approved the motion without a single dis- senting vote, President Da·niel Flinn appointed William Waldron II to notify the head of the Athletic Board of the action. After sE:veral announcements and notices to the freshmen, th~ meet- ing was closed. A most sudden breaking down of an old-time tradition occurrPd yes- terday morning immediately after the first Student Body meeting, when sophomores and upperclass- men heeded the injunction of Dan- iel Flinn, President of the Student Council, and permitted the fresh- men to leave the Old Chapel with absolutely no danger of losing their hats. Although not a single head was molested, most of the first year· men walked out with hats covered by hands. In previous years the old tra:di- tion was the cause of much com- motion, with the unfortunate fresh- man often suffering the loss of his newly 'purchased hat while receiv- ing a few good fist blows in return for it. Last year the president of the sophomore class was involved in a fast fist fight and some of the incoming class had to buy three new hats in order to abide by the rule. For these reasons, the Student Council bad deemed it wise to do away with the hat-snatching, and the announcement was made at the end of yesterday's meeting amidst much booing by tb upper classes and applause by the freshmen. However, five yearlings were ap- preb~nded for not wearing any hats and were required to sing the Alma Mater. ---•01--- Wittner Favors !Return of Hockey; Play At Mariaville th<! road at the rear of Washburn rent season got under way last mitted by instructors.

In the past few years our hockey team has been representative of the very best men on the campus. Their spirit has been excell- ent, and in the face of the most disheartening conditions, the team managed to complete a successful season last winter. There is not one good reason why Union College should not have a hockey team, and there are many excellent reasons why it should. A FINE START It was indeed gratifying to see such a large number of undergraduates turn out for the first Student Body meeting of the year. Let us hope that at least as many stu- dents continue to show as much interest tluoughout the year. There are many reasons why the under- graduates should show intense interest in student affairs. In the first place, interest in while for a corresponding period many col- leg·es are unable to show an entry on the blue side of the ledger for their athletic de- partments.

Nestle, with less than ' a. week's practice, captured a sec- ond from Lape within sight of the linish line. Gottschalk, suffering from a lame leg, did not equal his usual time. Ka:zmierzcak, who usually covers the course a:t a fast clip, was not clocked. The follow- ing times were handed in: Brock- wahl 19:14, Nestle 20:0(), Lape 20:08, Gottschalk 21:25, North 21:25, De Blase 21:27, Bastedo 21:58, Neuman 22:04, Sherman 23:05, Stevens 24:27.

Beekman as a member of the Executive Committee, discuss- ed the advisability of hockey at Ma.riaville Lake this winter, and elected- new assistant managers in three sports to take the place of those W·ho have not come back to college this year. John Argersinger wa.s elected as- sistant manager of the varsity cross-country team, taking the place of l)onald Hawkes, who is ineligi- ble.

Leslie Partridge, a member of the Kappa Alpha fraternity, who lives in Brooklyn was elected as- sistant manager of the varsity bas- ketball team to take the place of Leslie Kneher. Carl Johnson, the new vice-presi- dent of the Board is a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and a resident of Schenectady. He is manager of football. C. W.

Committee to Investigate Marla ville A committee consisting of Ben- nett, chairman, Robert Brearton, manager of lacrosse, and George R. Cory, Jr., manager of track and field was appointed by Profe»sor J. Harold Wittner, President of the Board to investigate conditions at Mariaville Jalte as a place for the varsity hockey team to play this winter. Hockey has been definitely reinstated at Union College, but it is not considered a minor sport, a,nd as yet, the board has taken no action toward awarding letters for varsity competition in the ice game. A committee consisting of Dorsey Hughes, Johnson and Cory was ap- pointed to consider a method of ap· pointing assistant managers under the new managerial election system in case a vacancy should arise. ----0---- Evangelical League The Union College chapter of the Evangelical stud·ents will hold a short devotional meeting Sunday evening in room 5, South Section, South College.

It is also doubtful whether· Chuck Krull, the depend- able sophomore end, will see action tomorrow, although his injury is not serious, Joe Milano, full'back, and last year's frosh captain, is still out of action with a fractured leg. Not Working SmQothly While not yet a smoothly func- tioning unit, the varsity showed some improvement over its per- formance in previous workouts. The ends displayed more speed in get- ting under punts and na.iJing the receivers. Semerad's .punts in prac- tice were .averaging over forty yards and his placement kicks for point after touchdown were rising over the bar fairly consistently. Jack Finch has been converted into a general utility lineman, play- ing a various times, center, guar·d, and tackle. At taclde, Finch was somewhat over-eager, often break- ing through to illegally block the kicker. Kendrick, playing in Krull's berth, fitted in well on the offensive but had a little difficulty on the defense against a shifty backfield. · Probable StRrting Lineup The starting lineup against Wes- leyan will most likely consist of Captain Austin Fox at center; Kearns and Moulton, guards; Agius and Dyal, tackles; Kendrick and Krull, ends; Semerad, quarter·back; Di Lalla and Rotunda, halfbacks; and Chrysler, fullback . The Wesleyan squad is better for- tified with competent subs than last year, has a heavier baclttield, and a new attack. Coach Jim Oberlander will send into action an untried Cardinal backfield behind a power- ful veteran line. Eleven lettermen have returned to school. Many :Backfield Candidates Oberlander has a squad·of seven- teen cal).didates i!lcluding Ol\tstand~ ing freshman backs and promising . members of Qast year's varsity who did not play regularly from which to build a backfield. Franlt Moyes, a lineman last year, has been made into a back and will be used as a line plunger and defensive fullback. Another halfbaclt who is trying to fill Larry Schlums' shoes is Jackson Burton, an outstanding all-round bacl~. Keith Huntress, a substitute last year, has been showing ability in punting and on off-tackle slants. A new offensive, \the Dartmouth System,\ featuring power plays, is being employed by the Cardinals this year. The Union team will have its hands full contending with a powerful punting game and aerial attack.

To this day: Old Eliphalet's one rule still g-ov- erns the students of Union Collt>g;e. It is simply: \It is expected that tlle students and faculty of the col- lege will conduct themselves as gentlemen.\ Naturally, studmts living to- gether on the campus, many hours away from any city of importance, as was the situation then, were in- clined to get togethN in cong-rnial groups. At first, these groups werP extra-curricular in nature. One of them, the PhilomathPan Society, is still the leading debating society of the catnpus. Another of these groups, Kappa Alpha, founded in 1825, is the oldest secret brother- hood of a social and liteiaty char- acter whi'ch has ha·d a continuous existence in American Colleges.

In like manner thP departments of economics, political science, philosophy, history and psychology will form the Division of SoCial sciences, and two other divisions will bl} formed for mathe- matics and other pure sciences, and, for the languag-es and classieR. This divisional plan has been found to be the best method whereby a student may discern the unity of knowledge which, under the old de- partmental system of instruction, often appeared as broken up into unrelated segments.

No tobaccos have ever been found that equal the spicy aromatic tobac- cos of Tu~key and (Jreece for this purpose. That's why we send 4000 miles for aromatic tobaccos from Sam- soun and Smyrna, Xanthi and Cavalla. When blended and cross-blended in just the right amounts with Chest- erfield's mild ripe Domestic tobac- cos, the result is a rich flavor and a fine fragrance. Chesterfields are seasoned right- they taste right. May we suggest you try them. the ciyare/le fkzf TASTES BETTER I • I ~ I I ' \l H (, ·h i\ ;• '· r .\., I : t1 I I I'.· ; ' I I ! i !
