Carol's ability was unquestionably accepted by all, and no verbal recognition of it could have been more effective than the very fact that £·he was lhe only girl playing football with a rough and rowdy gang of young boys. What is more astonishing is that Carol became the uncrowned leader of the gang, and the street in front of her house became the official gridiron for all games. · ~0:07.1.

To this day, I am unable to kie~,a foot- ball as far as· Carol could ·!tick in her prime. Of course at times her skirt rose a little higher than was quite propm· for a young la.Q.y, but it was an unwritten rule not to notice any such discrepancies. The o,nly .other deference s·hown het· in t>egard for her sex was that she was s·pared the usual blows, foul blocks, and vituperation which ac- company and are an inseparable part of a footbaft battle among boys. I like to think of the shocked faces of passersby-stiff and proper old ladies, amazed business men, en- vious young girls-as they saw a young blond girl playing football surrounded by a gang of respect- able, but nevertheless, young toughs And so a gang gTeW up with Carol as its nucleus which ate, slept, and dreamed, of practically nothing but football. .AB soon as the winter snows were cleared from the streets, we played football until the blazing sun of summer made the game even too strenuous for Carol. But when tne first breath of fall could be felt, the football would be dragged unmercifully from its• place of hibernation, and we would play till the biting cold of winter made the hands too numb to grip the pigskin. And a motley crew we were, too. Some of us wt re almost through high school; a few of us had barely finished the ~ixth grade. And there was always Carol, throwing another pass, mak- ing another touchdown and play- in~.: as hard if not harder than any of the rest. And we were all drawn together by our one bond of interest-football.

It was said that only two of the questions u£•ed on last night's pro- gram were sent in by students, and that all the rest had to be written by the station staff. This is a considerable burden on the members of the Society, particular- ly on the master of ceremonies of Remaining Stll.nding, and it is doubtful if the program can be continued next semester unless the interest of the student body is greater. Students are reminded that for every question used UCRS · awat·ds one free soda at the Scuttle- butt to the author, and if the ex- perts fail to answer the question correctly, the person sending in the question is awarded six free sodas.

TOO BUSY OR TOO LAZY7 Hecent observations a.nd experience have caused us to speculate as to the causes nf the disproportionately gt·eat lack of suppo1·t of the various student activities by the nctval tntinees here at l'nion. Is there some fun- dmnental reason why the navy men hr1·e seem apathetic, let!Hu·g-ic in thei1· attitude towm·d participation in activitie~. \Yhi.lr tho~e at most other colleges in this area form the backbone of neal'!~· all student affairs'? Are the trainees he1·e a less gifted gmup than any of the othen; \? Are they mo1·e ~tudious '! lias the college failed to instil that indefin- able something usu·ally called \spirit\ iu the minds and hearts of those in the \'-12 unit here'? \\'e wonder. At Colg-ate, for example, Li of the 16 membe1·s of the c1·o~s-country squad are members of nav~· or marine units of one sort or another. At Worcester Poly, the team to which om· harriers lo~t la~t week is composed of 12 men from their \T -12 unit, :md threr civilim1s. \\' on·ester, incirlen tall:--· has a higher ratio of civilian students to navy students than here at Cnion. The foot- ball teams at Colgate, Itochester, TI.P.I., anct \Vorce~ter are a.ll made up principally of men in the services, of whom the greatest nu.mller are V -12's. Civilian manpowe1· is notabl:--· lacking in all ath,Jetic teams everywhere where there are \'-12 units except at l\nion. llere there is not a single apprentice .sea- man out for ci·oss-countQ·. The only sailoi\- to-be who attended pmctices at all regularly had to drop the hill-and-dale sport for medi- cal reasons. Football was abandoned large!:-.· due to lack of attendance on the part of the naval trainees. There were only four mem- bei's of the \'-12 unit singing in the choir Sunday, and three of them came just before the service began, missing almost all of the pre-service rehearsal. The excuse almost invariably given h,\· LTnion's trainees when accused of not sup- porting activities, is that there is not enougl1 tillll' to do nn~·thing outside of the regular lla\'Y progTIUH. How cloes it happen that at the.~e other colleges the trainees seem to have su mueh mo1·e time, especially when ~ome of them reported!~· have stricter dis- cipline and brtte1· scholastie records'? Did l\nion receiw an inferio1· grade of \'-12 trainer~. one that has only time fot· study- ing and sca1·cely enough for that\! Assuredly the .:-:avy would not have en- count.ged tntinees to lead as nearly a normal college life as possi·ble, including participa- tion in extn1-curricular activities and fm- h'Inity membe1·ship, if there were no reason for them to do so. The Navy believes that those men make the best ofl\icers who have had a well-rounded backgTound, and, thus prefers \mulct-be of'ficets to lead balanced Ii,·es, as nearl,v as possible. Here at Cnion the \'-12 unit menrbet·s apparently regat·d a well-balanced life to consist principally of stuclying, eating, sleeping, and going out with g-irls at every opportunity. Sports and other extntClllTiculm· ctctivities receive scant atten- tion f1 om the lcu·ge maj orit~· of the trainees. I>o they think that the~· know better than the naval officials who planned the \'-12 program'? It Is probably too late fo1· the tminees he1·e to show during the rest of this semester that they ha\'e the ability, ambition and interests to support activities whole-hemtedly. \Vhat about next semester, however? \~' e don't want basketball to go the way football did, abandoned from lack of support. A nine- g·ame schedule has been drawn up, and, ac- cording to grape-vine somces, Y-12 members of varsity athletic squads will be excused from physical tmining classes, beg-inning- next semester, provided of course that it is not their fi1·st semester at co-lleg-e. Similarly, other activities will need strong suppo1·t from members of the \'-12 unit, \vho compose the bulk of the student bod:--·. We shall anxiously await developments next semeste1·. CARPE DIEM Of the many complaints we have heard around the campus this yeat·, one that we felt was pe1·haps the most justified was the contention that the1·e wasn't enough activit;.· going on this year, especially compared with former years. Until the past week or so we agTeed almost entirely ·with those Iamente1 s and attempted to c1·e~tte OI\ cause to be Cl'eated more functions on campus. ::--Jow, however, \Ve have a somewhat different at- titude. Sunday aftemoon we attended the Em- pire State Town .:\Ieeting, for what we shame- facedly admit \vas the first time in our three and a half yem·s at Union. The crowd present \Vas in the neighborhood of a stu- pendous, colossal thirty, which we under- stand is a.Jbout twice that at the usual broad- cast. Only six of this number were students, according· to om· count. These Town .Jleetings m·e informative and instructive as well as interesting to any student of the world today, and we wonder whether some of those who say there are not enough ·events going on here on the campus might not find some solace in these discussions. It rnal\lcs a definite phase in student apathr when intellectual matters are consciously igno1·ed. For those who have missed these meetings principally due to lack of adequate publicity, we apologize. To those others who kne\v of theii· existence but never got around to attending-, we cordially extend an invitation, with the assurance that they will learn something. To those who refuse to attenrl, we give our sad condolences, for theii· intellectual rlecline and death is near at hand. Another extremely timely feature, newly instituted at the college, in fact begun last .:\londay evening, is the series of lectures and discussions entitled \Freedom Forum\. Sponsor·ed by a large number of organiza- tions, including Union College, these pro- gmms will present, each week until December in Old Chapel, a prominent speaker who will lecture on some topic concerning national or foreign affairs. These promise to be ex- tremely enlightening, and we hope that a large number of students will avail them- selves of this opportunity for their own edification. The total turnout was fairlv good for Schenectady, according to one o'f the college Pl'ofessors, but the student tum- out did not manifest any great intellectual curiosity on the part of Union College's SOilS. Here, _then, are two more ways in which students can spend their time profitably right on the college campus. EDITORIAL 2 Will .Extinction Of Drc Jacksons Reindeer Revert Alaska \s Culture?

Tragedy was the most diE>tant thing in the minds of the four pleasure-bent occupants until the little ship suddenly ran out of gas.

Tearing off his clothes, he plunged into the breakers and, swimming with speed and determination, reached the cruis>er, which by this time was several hundred yards off shore. Calling to the skippet· for a thick rope, he wound it around his waist and told the four personS' aboard the ship to make this rope fast to a support on the deck. For an hour and a half, the young man treaded water ~~a human anchor. A man against an ocean, ·bnt he saved a ship and all its occu- pants from certain doom. The skin of his midriff was ripped off by the furious tugs> of the waves on the rope around his waist, but otherwise he was unharmed. The young man's name was Al- beit M. Irwin, he is better known to the men of Union College's V-12 Unit as \Chief.\ Chief lrwin says that he got \no a wards but lots of publicity\ for his re:::·cue feat.

It was only by taking out om· heaviest journalistic siege guns that we were able to make enough of a dent in his armor of modesty to get the following sum- mary of the essential facts of the popular V-12 physical training in- structor's life: Born in Newport Beach, Cali- fornia . · .. Always loved the sea. Sailed on many star class boats after his sixteenth birthday. En- joyed S'mall fishing boats, swim- ming, duck hunting ... came captain of the life-saving d~­ partment at Newport Beach, a poSI- tion of supervision over 48 life- ;uards which he held fer eight summers ...

Weighed 210 pounds then, as com- pared with present weight of 174. .. University of California scheduled Stagg's gridders for \breather\ that year. Chief Irwin and teammates upset the vaunted powerhouse ... Chief Irwin garnered \a few\ lau- rels in the course of his college ca- reer.

Says Irwin on Stagg: \He's 83 years old, yet he is perhaps the most active as well as the finest man I have ever known.

' i For Interfraternity Dance Seek to Save Face Afte.- Losing to Da.-tmouth, 19-36 Fo.- 2nd Straight Defeat Still seeking their first win of the season, the Garnet cross-country squad will encounter a strong ag- gregation from R.P.I. over the 4.7 nile home course at 3:00 tomor- ·ow. The Rensselaer boys man- aged to get four men in ahead of Worcester's first man. The latter, ncidehtally, beat the best Union runner, Art }iighland, by two sec- onds. Highland, fresh from time trial over the varsity course in 26-:52 \1\fednesday, has shown great im- provement over his Worcester form and is favored to finish first over he home course. His time on Wed- nesday, incidentally, is the fastest by a Dutchman since 1940. Coach Ketz is again pessimistic n bout our chances, but feels that his charges have their best chances thus far this season to win. Run- ning over the home course is con- ::;idered a great advantage in cross country. Viglielmo, Brightman Impt·ove Captain Jules Viglielmo also has shown improvement since the be- ginning of the season, and is ex- pected to place among the leaders by Coach Ketz-. Don Brightman is bird man on the squad at pres- ent, but is still bothered by shin ·plints. Others likely to place nmong Union's ftrst five are Roy Breg, Blaine Butler, Herman :Sioom, and Bill Eger. Two V -5 fliers, Hubbard and Middleton, are ulso conceded chances to finish v. ell, though they are dark horses since they have not been able to practice regularly with the squad. Other probable starters include Vic Maurel, Phil Shutler, and Jim l:lmith. Ralph Krueger. who missed the train for Dartmouth last week, will not run. Wily Wilford was again down- ·ight doleful when considering the chances of the Garnet against the Engineers from Troy. Their pow- rful and experienced team is. ex- pected to win handily over the bad- ly balanced Dutchmen. Last Saturday's meet with Dart- mouth was just a repetition of the ~ad story at Worcester the week berore. A one man team cannot win. Dartmouth's Big Green team placed five men among the first six to finish to win handily, 19 to 36. Highland Clost> to Burnham The only decent performance from the Garnet standpoint was that of Highland, who finished a good second to Dartmouth's ace rniler, Don Burnham, Burnham, who was last year's IC4A mile win- ner, usually runs that event in 4:12 ur thereabouts. which puts him on a level with MacMitchell, Dodds, Hnd other famous milers. Highland did well to finish only 33 seconds behind him over the four and one- 11alf mile course. Captain Viglielmo was the next Union man to finish, and he came in after the fifth Indian. He was tampered by a too fast start. and a wrong turn towards the end of the race. U.S.O. Movie, Old Chapel, 2000. Monday, October 11-Daily As- sembly, ProfeS'sor John L. March, 1200.

The date of the dance has been decided and approved by the Dean ior December 4. Reggie Carroll, '45, was appointed chairman of the dance committee. The meeting of the Interfrater- nity Council was presided over by Junius Stephenson, '44, newly elect- ed president. The dance question VIas foremost in the discussions of the group, as it had been decided c•arlier this term not to hold a <lance until next term. It had ·been tentatively understood, however, th:1t a dance would be put on some- time during the fa,ll. ~ioving rapidly after his appoint- ment to head the dance committee, Ca1roll disclosed yesterday that he had received administration appro- val for the dance and that the Dean had approved the Council's dPci- :sion to hold it on December 4. He also revealed that he had written sc>veral agencies to find out what \name\ band will be available at that time. D:ance Always Popular The Interfraternity Ball, also !mown as the Gridiron Ball, has in past years been the occasion for a weekend of celebration and fun- making. Most of the fraternities lteld house parties for theil· guests of the fair sex, the \Greeks\ mov- in~ in on friends in dormitories or cff-campus rooms. The dance was beld on Friday night, with a foot- ball game Saturday afternoon, and lwuse dances Saturday evening. In the past, well known bands have played for the Ball, including such nationally famous ones as Woody Herman, Jack Teagarden, and Son- ny Dunham. The spring dance, the ;)unior Prorr1, has had even more prominent music-makers, for ex- emple, Benny Goodman, Charlie Spivafi, and Glenn Miller, to men- tion bue a few. Both dances have been Union traditions fot· many years, and while this year's dance will of necessity be limited by the stiff scholastic schedule, the com- mittee promises a worth-while dance with a really good band pro- viding the music. Other business at the Interfra- ternity Council meeting included the election of a secretary, with James McN-ulty, '44, emerging the victor: and an announcement by President Stephenson that a repre- sentative of the L. G. Balfour Com- oany will visit the campus early in Xovember. ----0---- Junior .. Senior Dance The Junior-Senior Dance held on St>ptember 8, has been deemed a tinancb,l success by the co-chair- man, Armand Versaci, '45, and J. Robert LaPann, A/S, '44. The profit realized by the dance amounted to $65.13. This money ha,s been credited to the account of the Stu- dent Activities fund. Two hundred and forty-seven tickets were sold for $1.10 each giv- ing a gross of $271.70. The dance cost $208.07, which included pay- ments made for the band, printing, gymnasium, police, electrician, cloak room, a·musement tax and a miscellaneous account. Below is an itemized account of the income and expenditures of the dance: September 8, 1943 INCOME 247 tickets @ $1.10 .. $271.70 Following Viglielmo was Bright- man, 30 seconds behind.

WANTED --- PEACE AND HARMONY Ever since college began thi:,; July we ha\'e noticed a lamentable tendency on the pmt of the students, X a val trainees and civilians, to reg·al'd the other gToup as a separate en- tity, to t'esent and to envy an~· special pl'ivileg-es which might be enjo~·ed by those of the other part of the student body. \\'e will I'efmin from enumerating specific in- stances lest we be accused of digging up dead disputes. One needs only to look about. howevet·, and open his eyes and em·s to see and hear expressions of this antagonistic feeling. It is not om wish to state that either side ltas been right m· either side wrong. Let it suffice to state that a feeling- of un- friendliness and suspicion has existed and been felt by members of both gToups. \\·e have been accused of stilTing· up trouble by our editorial last week Criticisms ranged from mild objections to the advis- ability of the piece to violent attacks on our personal integrity. This storm of pro- test is another manifestation of the sus- picious and defensive attitude shared b;-.· ntan~· members of both the Naval unit and the civilian group towmd those of the othet· gTtlUp. The editorial was primarily intended to point out that here at L'nion. and not at many othel' colleges with V -12 units, acti- vities are at present canied on lat·gely b~· civilians. and to wily support for the extra- curricular activit;-.· groups fot· the next sem- ester. :\lcn·e data to bear out our contention that \·-12 trainees at other colleg-es pm·- ticipated to a much larg·er extent than they do here might he given. At Rochester. fm· example, a new managing board for their newspaper was just elected, all the mem- bet·s of which m·e naval trainees. Similar instances could be cited from many other colleges. llowever, at L'nion, according- to near!~· complete f'igmes, about .w of the 1:30 active participants in student activities m·e :--:avy men. These figures do not include the Band, which has strong support from the tiainees. The point which was being driven home was that a spirit ·which is apparently present at these other colleges, is lacking· at l'nion. Contrary to assertions of' some uninformed individuals,· this spirit was not missing at anr time until July 1943. :llany of the objectors to the editorial tool\ exception to nolle of the points made in the editorial, but misinterpreted it ~ts a slam at the trainees he1·e at L'nion. These disputnnts questioned the advisability of criticising- the trainees, and took the apparent stand that newspapers, or at least this news- paper, should be all \sweetness and light\. Some of them stoutly maintained that the~· are spending all their time on their studies and thought that we were attempting to subvert them into dis!'eg-arding their schol- astic endeavors in order to support activities. We have no quarrel with an~·one who can honestly sa~· that he is putting forth his best academic effoti and consequently has no time for activities. We did however direct our remarks to that not-so-small group who now waste time in the usual man- ner and who could use that time for par- ticipation in activities without decreasing appreciably their stud~· periods. -Invest- Buy u league, or more if necessar~·. with temns 1 eprcsenting both civilian groups and the navy ships. This should enable the two groups to become better acquainted as in- . divirhwls. so that members of either would · not regm·d the other as an alien class of some sort, but as fl'iends who happen to be members of the V-12 unit, or civilians as the case may be. Our previous suggestion earlr in the semester conceming this topic was poJi.tel~· and tacitly ignored. We hope that more cognizance is taken ot' this second attempt to integrate the two groups by means of one intramural sports program. Another method, already used once to pro- mote better understanding a.nd closer rela- tions betvveen the two parts of the student bod~·. is the holding of dances. The Inter- fraternity Council has planned a dance for the early part of next semester. Their ac- tion is to be commeded highly. However, one dance is not enough. The Student Coun- cil has spread vague l'tlmors to the effect that they might hold another dance next semester. Let us hope that these rumors become soldified by concrete action. The one dance which has been held was financi- ally successful, and there is no reason why another :~l10uld not be also. Relaxation is important under the strain of the stepped- up wartime pl·ogTam, so let us have more dances. s. War Bonds- EDITORIAL I Final Examination S(hedule Ph}\E'iCs 33 Soria!

However, if one were to compa:re it with the math de- partments of other colleges .jn the country, it would be fourtd that Union has oNe of the finest. And one of the mathematical tycoons of Union College is Professor Orin J. Farrell, B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. I Classes next semester will begin at 8:30 instead of a·t · 8 o'clock, Dean Charles F. Garis announced last night. All morning· classes will be moved up one-half hour, he said. The change was effected in order that the V-12 Trainees might receive an added half-hour of sleep, Dr. Garis explained. Letters Fram Honorary Chancellors Highlight C()rmmencement for Eight __ ,_ --- --- - --. - 1> President fox Reads Letters ;:rom Joseph Grew, Wendell Willkie in Daily Assembly Horatio Alger could . paint well the !He of Professor Fanell-the story of a poor boy born and I'aised in the bituminous coal region of Pennsylvania who struggled to ob- tain an education and who finally rose high on the ladder of success. But it was not an easy job. While he was in high school, he had to work after school in a store. During sum•mers, he was a hod-carrier. His ambition then was to become a bl'icklayer like his father. But his parents realized the value of educa- tion and encouraged him to study. When he volunteered to go to work after completing high school, they urged him to continue his school- ing. A brilliant student, he ob- tained a scholarship to Lebanon Valley College, one of the many small colleges which nestle in the hills of Pennsylvania. His years at Lebanon Valley are significanf in his life in many ways as those four undergraduate years are in the life of any <!Ollege grad- uate. But ·perhaps the most im- portant contribution Lebanon Val- ley made to Professor Fa,rrell was his wife. In the college dining hall, the Lebanon Valley, counterpart of Hale House, seats were assigned to all students. For the first bewild- ering and lonesome month of col- lege, there was but one other fresh- man who ate at the table of Fresh- man Farrell, a young pretty girl. It was love at first sight, and the boy and the girl who met at a col- lege dining haH, went together for their four years of college and were married one year after they re- ceived their degrees. His wife has had a profound in- fluence on Professot• Farrell, and they are very close. He speal>s of \we\ obtaining \our\ Ph.D. when re- marking about his• graduate work at Harvard. \We\ did this, and \we\ wanted that. And as children came, they too became part of this team of Farrell and Farrell. It is a family unity and solidarity sel- dom found in the chaotic world to- day. So close is it that one becomes convinced that the whole Farrell Family is really teaching mathe- matics at Union College. At Lebanon Valley, young Farrell was the B.M.O.C. He was editor of the yearbook, editor of the paper, president of the student council, and a member of the glee club for four years. In addition to this, .he earne·d money by tutoring, develop- ing and printing pictures, and sing- ing in church choirs. Incidental, of course, is that he was at the head of his class scholastically. College soon eliminated his am- bition to .become a bricklayer, artd he decided to become a high school teacher and then work up to .be- coming a high school principal. His first year out of college, he taught math at a small Pennsylvania high school. Since he took a Liberal Arts course in college, it is here that he claims he learned to do square and cube roots. Within a year. however, his ambition to be- come a principal was realized when he obtained the principalship at Mohnton, another small Pennsyl- vania high school. His last memory of teaching math in high school is of the day before school closed when one of the pupils to whom he taught square root came up to him and said: \Hey prof. I hear you aren't going to be here next year.\ Seeing the math teacher nod in assent, the boy remarked tactfully, \Well I'm damned glad!\ He was a very efficient and con- scientious principal, and he enjoyed the worl\ Perhaps his only handi- ca·p was his age which was only twenty-two, but he easily overcame that. He still remembers the day, however, when a boolt salesman came into the school, and seeing nobody around, came over to him and said, \Hey kid, can you tell .

F A·RRELL me when the principal will be in~., Perhaps the one thing Horatio Alger would not like about Orin Farrell is his· lack of a driving am- bition. Not that he is lazy, .for what has ·been shown here already ce1·tainly would disprove that. But he is easily pleased, contented, sat- isfied with life. The jeweled palace of the Taj Mahal, the Shanty in Old Shanty Town, would both be equally comfortable for him to live in. He is not a realist. He is not an idealist. He ideaJ.istically pos- sesses a certain faith in life, :but he realistically realizes the limitations of that faith. His realism would make him content with .practically any mode of life. His idealism would prohibit him from desiring an unworthy or unobtainruble .goal. It is his wife, therefore, who pro- vides the ambition for the team of FatTen and Farrell. It was she who encouraged him to become a col- lege instructor, to do graduate wot·k, to become a college profes- sor. Without his wife, it is unlikely that he would ·be where he is today. at -1 :.t~ on Wednesda} :.;, Attendance reg·ulations have not yet been decided upon for next term.

Youth ~--------------------~~---------------------------- 1 A Decisive Defeat of Pn'vious Cham·ellor Must Be Responsible Present Chancellor Ja;pan Is Necessary 1 For Enduring Peace It is i·Bdeed a pleasure for· me to greet the students of Union Col- I lege. I welcome this apport. nity ! to :o·pcak with you on n -;ubj<'ct near to my heart ~ to talk with ycu about the future of young American men a·nd women. Upon completion of yom· train- ing period, many of you will be officer candidate material for the , Navy. othet·, of you will move into the production of war ·essentials, while some of y0u wiH be called upon to ~et·ve yo~.r count! y in whatever place the rPgular clra.ft authorities deem most neceFsary to the speedy completion of the job. Each of you will be given an opportunity to serve and to help to bdng the victory clcset·. \Vaiting for release fr0m inac- tion to action is never easy. FUl- ing your days with training for action, future action, is tantalizing when every ncwE>paper, every radio account brings fresh tales of het·o- ism which might well be reports of your own deeds if your pericd of training were in the past. It is quite natural that as each sccceed- ing day brings the prospect of. a 1nilitary victory closer. eager young men champ impatiently and question whether they will be able to share in the actual fighting for the victory which they hold so dear. . Victor~· is Only First Step That victory. desirable as it ie, seems to me to be only the initial step in a long road along which we, the myriad peoples of the globe, must travel to 'bring peace and sanity into a war-wracked world that has been tmn asunder with clocklike regularity every twenty-five years. Whether the vic- tory is merely a hiatus between two more parts of the same world war or whether it is the first plank in a bridge over which the tired bloody millions of the world can drag themii'elves to an island of hope-will depend largely upon you. For it has fallen to your lot to be the leaders of the futL re world. Not because you are unus- ually gifted. and not because you are anxious or even willing to as- sume this burden, but simply be- cause nah: re in her infinite cap- rices has ~elected this moment for the balancing of the forces of good against those of evil in the world of today and tomorrow. And eo you, who have sought it, are being catapulted into world leadership. Elsewhere throughout the world, young men and women have had their energy drained by years of steady bombardment-- physical and moral. Many of them had no reservoir of honest, impar- tial education upon which to draw during these long years. They have lived upon a diet of hate and have been fed twisted doctrines and, at best, half-truths. Conse- quently, they-the very people who, in time, will become yo~ r partners in the control of world affairs-are There's a Real Treat In Store for You a.t the WENDELL L, WILLIUE today too sick, too confused to be of help. Other young people, mem- berS' ·of the family of our United Nations, will doubtless prove of great valor in the unglamorous fight ahead to rebuild the world. Mainly. however, you will be forced to rely upon your own strength. to draw from the bottom- less well of American literature and history, to walk firmly with Jefferson, to sing out bravely with Stephen Foster, to dream with the Wl'ight brothers, to build. I believe that you will not ·be bowed by the burden of your responsibil- ity, but lather that you will be sus- tained by it. You will find no dearth of other American boys to lead with you-for there exists in every decent American home that element of leadership, which multi- plied many times is, and always has been. the safeguard of Ameri- C:J.n democracy. Every town, every state, the en- tire nation is alive with potential leaders. Our history is crowded with examples of great leadership that sprang from humble men and women who were free to develop and express their ideas. We have alwaye been a nation whose strength came from her people and not from some artificial aristoc- l'RC~'· Quite recently, it has been the fashion among a small group to argce that it would be exped- ient to superimpose leadership from on top rather than to allow it to continue to well up from the people.

Why should you be sent to fight I Japan? WoLid H make much dif- ference wheh we had thPottled Germany if we composed an eas>y peace with Japan and left her un- trammeled in her so-called co-pros- perity sphere? Would it perhaps be enoug·h if she resigned the Phil- ippines and a few stepping stone I islands? At any J·ate, do we have I to hurry in carrying on our fight ! with Japan? Can't we ccncentrate nearly all our power on the Euro- pean war and then in good time clean up the Japanese island by island? There are some of the questions that are frequently aii'k- ed. I will tell you why we cannot af- ford to wait, why we cannot af- ford to enter a half-baked peace, necessary to counter the \inability of a democracy to act quickly or effectively.\ The lie to that non- sense is given by an examination of what has hap,pened to the lives of every one of you and your fam- ilies. Think back to a little over eighteen months ago; mark the differences, tally the score. Has democracy been effective in mov- ing ahead on a straight course? Ask yourself; ask also. the Italian and the German, yes, and even the Japanese. They know the answer to that one. This war has opened for us new horizons, ·both geographicaL and mental. The final victory will be won on the battlefield of men's minds. Ideas and thinking which have grown obsolete must be dis- carded-already they have been in large part put aside for the keener, sharper weapons of fresh, new, dynamic convictions. These new weapons must be turned into the plowshares after this war so that the peace will be forged out of the same steel which won the initial victory. Sincerely, WENDELL L. WILLKIE JOSEPH C. GREW why we wust finish the job com- pletely and irrevocably-now. And that means Japan's t nconditional surrender bmught about by het· total defeat-on land, at sea and in the air-until her armed forces are incapable of fighting further. Japan is a long way from our country when the distance is measured in miles. But with the constantly accelerating develop- ment of aircraft in point of speed, range, load capacity, and arma- ment, the distance that separate2 us from Japan is going to grow shorter year by year. Some day in the future it wot ld be feasible for a great fleet of Japanese bombers, in the absence of defensive meas- ures, to unload their devastating cargo on one or several of our American cities without. warning, as they did at Pearl Harbor. We are therefore faced with two al- ternatives; either we must remain permanently on a protective war footing-and that would mean that you, your children and your grand- children would have to devote the better part of yot: r livee. as you are devoting them today, to mili- REMEMBER THE MODERN DINER Albany St. and Nott Terrace INTERESTED IN SCHENECTADY INTERESTED IN UNION Maurice B.
