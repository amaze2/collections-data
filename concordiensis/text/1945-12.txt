The delay was a long- one. We are sorry for it however, the fault was not entirely with us. The delay in printing the Concot·diensis is not the only delay on campus this term. l\Ian~· other extra-curricular activities on campus were tardy in getting started. No one person is responsible fot· the state of affairs. Perhaps if the Concordiensis had appeared sooner, many of these things would have been brought to light. Fot· example, the re- organizational meeting was not held until the past l\Ionday evening- in Silliman Bali at 6 o'clock And so the story goes. But more basically and in a tardy manner, the Concol'diensis is grateful to note that the student body is on the decided increase. If another welcome can be extended to the re- turned veterans, this is it. And to all other civilians who are at Union for the first time, we are confident that Union will benefit by their presence. Before the war ended, numerous books and pamphlets were printed on how to treat the returning veterans. Not that such works lack their suggestive and praiseworthy points, but one look at the way in which everybody seems to be buckling down and getting along with one anothel' would indicate that few, if any, chances of misunderstanding will arise. For the most part, the veteran can be thought of as a student who has had his studies intenupted by influential experiences and now wants to finish his college career while at the same time resuming those contacts which were temporarily broken off. ' To the members of the United States Navy on campus, we welcome again the opportunity of being of service to our country and accept the inconveniences thereby imposed.

Coming from a coed college, Knox College, Dr. Davidson believed that it would btke a little time fat· him to be used to seeing fewer young ladies on campus. In our opinion Dr. Davidson even during his short visit made a lasting impression on the student body. We look forward :with great pleasure to his permanent anival in 1\Iarch and with anxiety to his inaugun1:tion after that. ---- ------ - ... _____ -- Dean C. F.

NEW TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT FRATERNITIES! CONGRATULATIONS! BachpJor of Scienc!'> in Chemis- tr~·; Anthony DiCocco, John R. Draves. Robert V. Espisito, Ru- With this week's issue comes the an- nouncement that 13 of Union's fmtemities have pledged 49 new members. This fact in itself is highly indicative of the strong will and desire for the continuance of fra- ternity life at Union. ~ Fraternities are considered as much a part of Union College as the class rooms and laboratories, or as the ivy-cove1·ed walls of its historic buildings. The social fraternity system, which h:.1s become a force in American education, originated at Union in 182!'i; and in addition to the first Greek letter society founded here in that year, five other national college fraternities have claimed Union as their birthplace. Union College accordingly has good reason to be known as \the mother of fraternities.\ The strength of any fraternity depends upoa the character and ability of its mem- bers. Fraternities are interested, therefot·e, in electing each year a number of good ali- I'ound men who can be counted on to con- tribute to the welfare of the group. The aims of the different fraternities, on the other hand, are by no means uniform. Fraternities offer \pledges\ to men who they believe will find themselves in con- genial fellowship and both give and receive something worthwhile as members. The \pledge\ is an agreement whereby the fra- ternity offers the candidate prospective membership, with accompanying rights and dolph M. Goff1·edo, Orin c. Hansen Jr., Frederick E.
