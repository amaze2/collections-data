The ConcordieJlsis VoL. XXV. UNION COLLE'.GE, APRIL 1 o, 1902. No. 21. SUPI{EMACY OP THE UNITED STATES i Hon. Danforth E. Ainsworth. 11r. ...t\.insworth, deputy superintendent of Public Instruction, lectured informally in the chapel upon this subject on the afternoon of March 2r. The chapel was well filled hy students and friends of the college. The speake1· said in part : ''The young tnen going forth fron'1 our coileges and universities today are far better trained to take their places in the intense activity of this age than are those who have not had such advantages. But their responsibilities are also increased with their learning, so I feel that our young tnen ought to understand the position of our country in the world. \We as a nation, have never appreciated ourselves. When Cleveland was president, the Republican papers were filled with criticis111s of the n1an and his ·policies, and when Harrison was presiden~ the Detnocratic papers ·were the sarne way. Through this political partisanship and the license of criticism we have never quite realized how strong we are. The American who goes abroad is so impressed with the smallness of what he sees as compared to his native land, that he is prone to boast. In this manner we have obtained the natne of being Jingoes. So between this feeling abroad and our own disrespect for public tnen and tneasures, we h~ve not appreciated our strength. \A few years ago the powers of Europe did not talk about the United States in their cabinet meetings; but now they don't talk about much else. Our cotning to the front has been sora pid that we do not realize it. \'VVe have long been spoken of as the world's granary but it was, with few exceptions, never realized that we should ever become wllat we have now become -the greatest commercial nation and the largest manufacturers in the worlc:J. ''The sum total of the trade baJance in our favor during the first one hundred :years of our national life was $388,ooo,ooo, while that for the last six years alone has been more than three thnes this figure! I apprehend that blessings co.me frequently to nations as to people-in dis- guise. The hard tirnes of 1892 taught the people of this country that they could go abroad for markets for their goods. The hard tin1es taught us to cultivate commercial relations with the rest of the vvorld. \The Russian governn1ent is building a rail- road as the crow flies, straight across the wastes of Siberia; but it is using American raHs and American cars. The city of Liverpool is equip- ping its underground railways with electrical apparatus frotn Schenectady, n1ade by An1erican workrnen. At Dunkirk, N. Y., they have just received an order for 6 5 locomotives to be used in New Zealand. They are used everywhere, where the best machine is needed. \Not only are our locon1otives in demand, but our textiles are as well. America is the largest exporter of textiles in the world. Per- haps some of you saw the recent 111agazine article that said that the United States not only carries coals to Newcastle, textiles to Man- chester, cutlery to Sheffield, but even beer to the banks of the RhiGe ? '' I do not apprehend that tho' we tnal\e mis- takes, our present prosperity will be temporary and followed by a heavy depression or disaster due to overproduction. My reason for this belief is that that nation is to succeed and pros- per which has the greatest and best supplies of coal and iron. This is the dawn of the Iron Age. Iron is king and Coal is prime tninister. The widest, deepest and richest vein of iron ore in the world has just been 1·ediscovered in Northern New York. We have more and better iron than any other nation on the globe. This is the iron age because it is the age of travel. Rails and c~rs are rnade of iroq..

6 THE OONCORDTENSIS. \As for coal, the prime tninister, the United States has twenty tirr1es more of it than has England, and it is of good quality and easily mined. We have the advantage in that our coal and iron are found side by side. ''Another reason for our progress is the abun- dance of cheap skilled labor. Our laboring classes are cosn.1opolitan, but they are better housed, better fed and better educated than the laboring classes of any other nation. They are a mixture of the best qualities of the strongest nations of the world, and tbe n1ingling of this blood gives us the best and tnost skilled labor. Nervous, quick, active, atnbitious Atnerica! Her workman will stand by his n1achine and do more and better work than any other workn1an in the world. \Cheap raw n1aterial, cheap con1n1unication, not cheap labor, will determine the supretnacy of a commercial nation in the future. \All the developn1ent of the future i., to be to our westward until there is no n1ore west.\ The speaker then gave teveral cotTlparisons, showing tbe size of this country. The 1nost striking was this: \If we were to put the population of the world in this country we n1ight have no part of it more thickly settled tbat Belgiutn is, and still have a shooting range, where there was not a single person, as large as Gennany, France, England, Ireland and Scotland all taken to- gether. . ''I never felt that I was outdoors until I crossed the Mississippi river a few years ago. ''There is a n1easure before Congress now that if passed will assure the co1n1nercial ' ' I . . 1 t supremacy of the United States. tIS JUSt w 1a was predicted when Na pol eo? was a?out ~o. sell the Louisiana tract to Amenca. I-Its m1111ster told him that if the isthmus was ever cut by a canal the waterways of the Louisiana tract would be the highroads of con1n1erce. But Napoleon sold it for a little l.ess than th~ assessed valuation of the farrn lands 111 Schohane county today. \The better equipment of the college n:an will give him a handicap over the other n1ne out of ten tnen that he will meet. Knowledge . '' 1s power. . The speaker closed by quoting fron1 Lowell the stanza that begins, ''Bring me men to match the 1nountains, h 1 . '' ''Bring me men to match t e p a1ns. SEMI-CENTENNIAL OF THE DUDLEY OBSE\RV A TORY. The fiftieth anniversary of the Dudley Obser- vatory was celebrated March 19th at the Albany Institute, Historical and Art Society with a his- torical address by Prof. Lewis Boss, whose im- portant work in astronorny has helped to place this observatory in the front rank of American scientific institutions. Special invitations had been issued by the Institute and Historical Society to the trustees of the observatory, of the Medical College, the Law School and the College. President Ray- mond, of Union University, presided and tnade the opening address, introducing Prof .. Boss, in whose paper was given an epitome of the 50 years of progress tnade by the observatory since its foundation in 1852 by the tnunificence of Mrs. Blandina Dudley and the leading citi- zens cf Albany. An address by B,ishop Doane followed. The occasion was notable frotn several stand- points-as a historic event, as -giving public recognition to the fine scientific work that is being done by the director of the observatory, and as opportunity for hearing three excellent spe~1kers. T'he I-Iistorical Society's assetn bly rooms were crowded to their utmost capacity by tnembers of the society and guests anxious to share in celebrating the setni-centennial of an Institution in which all public spirited Albanians take pride since it carne into existence and has been sup- ported largely through the generosity of citi- zens.

8 'THE CONOORDIENSIS. AT THE LAW SCHOOL. Saunders, 'or, visited the school last week. The Seniors were examined in Criminal Law on Wednesday, March 26. The Secretary has revised the school cata- logue and it will be out of the printer's hands within a week. Lester T. Hubbard, College, ~oo, Law, 'oz, has been elected a tnember of the University Club of Albany. The present schedule is as follows: Seniors-· Carporations, Mr. Tracy ; Evidence, Judge Landon; Bills and Notes, Mr. Lewis R. Parker. Juniors-Torts, the Dean; Agency, Mr. Battershall. Judge Tennant resumes his course with the Juniors on April 21, when he will deliver a short course of lectures on Sales, after which the exan'lination on both Personal Property and Sales will be in order. Arrangements are being cotnpleted for a joint trial between representatives of t11'e two Junior Moot Court Societi(\s. Messrs. Boorn, Mills, Britton and Smith compose the joint comtnittee in charge of the negotiations. Odwell, 'o3, Flinn, 'oz, Paige, 'oz, Bryan, 'oz, Nicholas DeVoe, 'o3, Milton DeVoe, 'o3, and O'Brien, 'o3, are among the Law men trying for places on the 'Varsity nine. This proportion of Law Departn1ent representatives should be n1ost encouraging to those who desire the closer amalgatnation of the various depart- ments of the Ur:iversity. In the Senior Moot Court, before Battershall; Justice, the case of Brown vs. Jones was argued. This involved the question of whether a mantel saved frotn a burning building was real or per- sonal property. Messrs. Brady and Darrin conducted the case for the hei,r, while the interests of the executor were looked after by Messrs. Flinn and K--:than. Judge Battershall ordered a new trial, thus sustaining the con- tention of the heir. The Appellate Coutt conducted by the Juniors has rendered several decisions on cases argued before them. Jones vs. Spencer, argued by Hotaling & Rogers for the former and Dyer & St'Tiith for the latter, was decided in favor of the plaintiff, Lawless, J., reading the prevailing opinion, and all the other judges concurring except Mills, P.

TRE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 RUTGEQS--UNlON DEBATE. Won by Qu tgers. The debate 'betwee-n the representatives of Rutgers and Union Colleges tovk place at New 13rut1swick, N.J., on the evening of March 28. The debate had been arranged some time ago between the two colleges and marks the be- ginning of what is hoped to be a series of de- bates between representatives of the two insti- tutions. The debate took place in Kirkpatrick chapel and was listened to by a large audience. Presi- dent Austin Scott, of Rutgers, presided, a-nd in opening the meeting referred pleasantly to the exceedingly warm and cordial feeling existiNg between the two colleges whose colors were the scarlet and garnet. The subject of the debate was, \Resolved that the Chinese should be excluded from this country.\ Rutgers spoke for the affirmative and Union chose the negative side. The judges were, Professor Frank M. McMurry, Ph .. D:.,of Columbia University, Professor R. MeN. McEii·oy, Ph. D., of Princeton University and Charles A. Murphey, Esq., of New York city. Rutgers opened the debate wtth Burton J. Hotaling, '03. He said in substance that Chinese exclusion has been the settled policy of this country for the last 20 years. The affinn- ative, he said, defended this policy of exclusion upon the three great divisions of the question in the following order: First, economical; second, social, and third, political. Mr. Hotaling was followed by J. Albert Bolles, 'o3, for Union, who held that the Chinese were the equals of most foreigners admitted to this country, and as such were admitted to the friendship of the governtnent. Martin L. Schenck, 'o4, the next speaker on the affirmative, handled the social side in an able manner and showed that the Chinese be- came a burden by not assimihting our views. They hold to their vices and their old customs. Lewis T. Hunt, 'o3, the next speaker for Union showed that the Chinese were industrious· · and patient. They are not guilty of bribery of our legislature, though this custom prevails among American.s in China. Frederick W. Smith, 'o2, as the last speaker on the affir.rnative set forth the political view of the question. He showed how different was their civilization from ours, separated as the two are by 4000 years. He maintained that they were a menace to the country, the political institutions of o~r country, their sole ambition being to gain the A1nerican dollar and return to China. Samuel B .. Howe, Jr., 'o3, the last speaker for Union, proved hhnself an able speaker and called attention to the fact tl1at no monster Chinese horde overruns our country, nor was there any danger of such an occurrence.

Inter-Class Base Ball. The attention of the base baH man- agers of the different class teams needs to be called to the fact that as yet no games have been arranged between the class teams. The necessity for this should be recog- nized. Let the managers of the class teams meet with the 'Varsity management and arrange a series of class games. These games can be of tl1e greatest importance in keeping up the interest in base ball and bringing out any latent ability that CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, $2.00 per Year, in Advance may exist in the under-classes. 10 Cents .

We painted the god about four years ago, We've turned in our brushes and paint, don't you know. Hurrah for Old Union ! Hurrah ! Naughty-two.! And farewell, grinning Idol, a farewell to you ! Exan1s are no more, and our dips are in sight, Hurrah, boys ! Naughty-two! We've passed up our sticks, and the profs are all right, Hurrah~ boys ! Naughty-two! Now Freddie and Eddy, Pop, Ashy and Nance, And the rest of the learned have had their last chance To stick us or let us through, Whichever they chose to do. CHORUS. Oh! Hurrah for the Faculty!

D., ex-Justice of the New York Supreme Court, and a n1en1ber of the Second Division of the Court of Appeals, died at his residence in Whitehall, N. Y., on March 30, of paralysis, after an illness of ten days. He was born in Easton, N.Y., Novem- ber 17, r821; was graduated from Union Col- lege with honors in r841, and was adtnitted to the bar in 1845. He was elected District Attor- ney for Wash.ington county in 1849, and served two tenns in that office. In 1863 he was elected County Judge, which office he filled for two successive terms, and was then elected Justice of the Supreme Court, continuing in that office until he was retired upon reaching the Contitu- tional age litnit of seventy years. He was designated by Governor Hill in 1889 as one oi the Judges of the Court of Appeals, Second Division, and continued to serve in that cap- acity during the existence of that court. A con- spicuous assistant of Judge Potter's career was the granting of a stay of proceedings in the case of Jacob Sharp, who was convicted of bribery in the city of New York.

L· i The Concordie11sis VoL. XXV. UNION COLLEGE, THE CENT~AL BUILDING TO BE COM- PLETED AND MADE INTO A LIBRA~¥.· The History of the Building. Union men everywhere will rejoice over the announcement n1ade by President Raymond last Tuesday morning that Mr. Andrew Carnegie had given $4o,ooo to enable the trustees to com: plete the central building and convert it into a library. When the college was ren1oved to its present site early in the last century a cotnprehensive plan for the grounds and buildings. was pre· pared by a French architect then in this country, and that plan adopted at the time by the college authorities called for a circular building in the center of the can1pus. The funds available l1owever, were insufficient to carry out the original plan in all its deta:ils, but the idea of a central building was never abandoned and for many years such a building appeared in all the pictures of the college, notably in the beautiful engraving on the diplotnas. In the confident hope that this idea would be realized the mound upon which the building was to be placed was made long before there was any h11mediate prospect for the building itself. A few years before Dr. Nott's death, which occurred in 1866, a foundation was laid broad and deep and strong, but the promise thus given was not to be immediately fulfilled. For fifteen years this foundation was all that appeared. The students called it \Fort Gillespie\ after the professor of engineering who had supervised its construc- tion. lti 1872 it became the scene of a singular midnight demonstration by the undergraduates who, after parading the city in white robes and to the solemn strains of; ·~r ··fulieral march, gathered about the old foundation for the mock burial of the trustees. In_ 1875 the announce- APRJL 18, 1902. No. 22. ment was ;m.ade that the long hoped for building was at last to be begun, when the students tnani- fested their de ight by another tnidnight parade ending again at ·'' Fort Gillespie \ where speeches we:re made and songs sung to celebrate the resur~ection 'of the trustees. But there were disappointments still to come, for the architect's plans were too atnbitious an.d called for more money than could he secured for this purpose and so the building which at last appeared, while beautiful and impressive, was incotnplete in many of its details and ill adapted to any practical use. Such as i~ was, however, it bore witness to the enterprise and energy of Dr. Potter, then president of the college, and it will be gratifying to all his friends to know that it was through him finally, that the money was ob_tained to complete the work which he began. In the fall of r9oo Dr. Potter called upon Mr. Carnegie and described to him the condition of the buildit:g, receiving at that tin1e the protnise of a sutn of money sufficient to n1ake all necessary repairs and to substitute metal for wood in the drutn of the dome. At Mr. Carnegie's suggestion estit11ates of the cost of the work were to be secured.. Dr. Potter's sudden and unexpected death a few weeks later while traveling in Mexico, interrupted the negotiations, but when Mr. Carnegie was recently appt·oache:l by representatives of the college he renewed his promise and generously increased the sum that he would give so as to provide not only for the conpletion of the build- ing, but also for its adaptation to the uses of a library. We expect to print later a detailed statetnent of the architects' plans. Enough is known at present, l1owever, to give assurance that the hopes of many years are to be realized and that the building originally designed to be the chief ornament of the college grounds will be worthy its place in the center of the campus, as prac- tically useful as it will be architecturally beautiful. ,

THE CONCORDIENSIS. THE UNIVEQSITY SMOKEQ. Great Amount of Credit Due to the Committee. '\.rhis affair which came off at the rooms of the University Club of Albany on Friday even- ing, April I I, was completely successful as. an entertainment and as such. should prove a sourc.e of great satisfaction to all concerned. There was a spirit of equality and oneness, of a true university spirit shown which testified to the attainn1ent of the object of the srnoker. College songs were sung and Union yeU s were frequent. The ~omtnittee deserves a great deal of credit for their efforts to tnake the stnoker a successful affair, and it is to be regretted that the men were not present in larger numbers. Thanks are due to the University Club for their kindness in permitting the smoker to be held there. The committees having the smoker in charge were: College-Hin1n ~n, 'o2, Griffith, 'oz, Bothwell, 'oz ; Medical- Carney, 'o2, Vander Veer, 'o3, Keens, '04; Law-Bender, 'oz, Merriman, 'o3, Taylor, '03.

I ' THE ,O:QNCORDIENSIS. 7 THE NEW ·CHI PSI LODGE. The mem 1 \'ers of the Chi Psi Fraternity are now housed in their new lodge,. the PI~ilip Spencer Metnorial building. Although the in- terior finish is not yet completed, it is expected that another month will suffice to put things in proper shape to receive visitors. The architecture of the building is designed afte:r that of an old English villa or country house having a suggestion of the Doman-Fren:ch style. The exterior of the building is of ~ort­ land ce:ment which is tinted a buff color an.d is interspaced with half-timber work whidb is stained a dark green. On the campus side is a large porch having ample roon1 for the rnen to sit about on warm days, while on the rear is a loggia designed more especially for a sort of conservatory. Within, entering from the front facing the carnpus, there is a massive staiTcase and commodious reception hall. Arljoining this to the right is the genera~ sitting roon\l and lounging room ; to the left is a large dining rootn. - There is a large fireplace in either room, and in the latter, the mantel is des.igned after one which graces one of the rooms of a Welsh Baronial castle. Facing the staircase is the memorial library. The attractiveness of the room is greatly enhanced by a large fireplace .and a mantel intended for memorial overhangiags. The finish of the dining room and memorial library is quartered oak \vhich is stainerl the color of the Flemish oak. The sitting room and reception hall are of quartered oak, the fonner is to have a finish of golden oak. The staircase is also of quartered oak, and is broken by a landing between each two floors. In the first landing the windows-five-are of leaded glass, the middle one having the fraternity monogratn in the center. These windows look out tovvard the campus. On the second floor is a g<>od- sized reception room and hall at the heac~ of the stairs. This floor also has bedrootns and studies en sulte, the latter being commodious and and will be fitted out so that, besides being -well adapted for purposes of study, wiU be much used for general lounging. A large-si~ed bathroom with shower is also on this floor. The third floor has combination study and bed- rooms, having an1p:Je closet room. The base- ment contains a large, well-lighted kitchen, butler's pantry, servants' quarters, heating apparatus, cycle. room, toilet-rooms and other accessories. The finish of the interior with the exception of the first floor and staircase is of cypress wood. The lodge has accomrnodations for twelve students assigning two to a suite. THE AQMST:RONG CASE FINALLY SETTLED IN UNION'S FAVOQ. The Htigation over the will of the late Thomas Armstrong of Plattsburg by which he bequeathed his entire estate valued at $r zs,ooo to Union college, cutting off his wife and son, Em met Arn1strong, with practicaHy nothing, was ab- ruptly terminated at Plattsburgh on Tuesday, April 8, during the trial of a suit in the supreme c,ourt before Justice Houghton, by amicable settlement outside of court. Judge Judson S. Landon transferred a small part of the estate to Emmet Armstrong on con- dition that he cease all legal action against the college. Thotnas Armstrong died in Plattsburgh in I895· HUDSON QIVEQ SCHOOLMASTERS' CLUB. President Raymond was one of the speakers at the meeting of the Hudson River School- masters' Club at the Ten Eyck, Albany, on April II-12.

Union's base ball season was opened on Saturday., April r 2, with a game with West Point Military A,caderny at West Point. The gatne although resulting in a defeat for Union was a sut-prise in a way, as it showed of what promising n1atedal U ni.on' s team is con1posed. Union took the lead in the fit·st inning when Griswold, the first man up, was hit by Graham, the West Point pitcher, and took his base. Grout by a sacrifice advanced Griswo.d to second base. Odwell hit the ball to the pitcher, who just recovered in time to tl1row hitn out at first, Griswold in the meantime making third . On Garber's en·or Griswold crossed the plate. Devoe was next up and was thrown out at second. Union held this lead until the .fifth inning when, with Gardner on first and Winston on second, O'Brien muffed Graham's long fly and two men crossed the plate. Try as each tean1 did neither was successful in getting another tnan past third base. The remainder of tlie gam.e was marked by sensational fielding on both sides, few men going farther than first. The West Pointers recognized Griswold's ability and made no attetnpts to steal second. In the first inning, Mahar made a phenomenal one-handed stop which saved a three-base hit. Not less brilliant was Heath's long run and catch of a fly to deep left. A pretty double by Griswold's catch of an infield fly and his quick throw to Od well catching the runn~r off first ba&e was another feature. Not an error was made by Union's infield and only one altogether. Devoe's pitching was remarkable. His de- livery puzzled the opponents to a great extent and he succeeded in striking out seven men and allowed only three scattered hits. He is un- doubtedly one of the best pitchers Union has ever had. The sun1mary is as follows :

SAMUEL IVES CUR- TISS OF THE CHICAGO THEOLOG- ICAL SEMINAI{Y TUESDAY , EVENING, AP~IL 15. Subject: Survivals of Prin\Iitive Semitic Re- ligions based on personal interviews with Syri- ans and Arabs. In opening Dr. Curtiss spoke of the best authorities on the subject of Syrian arch reo logy, and of his ll)ethods of study. He described the wonderful beauty of the Syrian scenery and stated that the con1 monl y accepted idea con- cerning the unhealthfulness of the climate is erroneous. With the Rev. Mr. March and another mis- sionary, in the summer of 1900, Dr. Curtiss set out fron1 Beirut for a pleasure trip through the beautiful hills of Lebanon. The people of the region, though nominally Mahotnedans, are virtually nature worshippers as they were in the days of the prophets. Their saints are buried in enormous shrines to which are brought animal sacrifices and over which many curious rites are celebrated. In a deserted village in the Druze mountains a young English woman of his party had discovered a shrine at which the rite of the passover was being performed, the blood of the goat v.ras sprinkled on the door posb• and threshold. The subject interested h in1 very much and the following sutntner with another party Dr. Curtiss went over the same ground making a more careful study of these shrines. At one shrine, a great tnonolith, an interview was held with two Arab priests which yielded a store of fascinating folk lore and valuable information concerning their religious rites. The Arabs of this region have many customs different ft~om those of other J\!Ioslems. No direct questioning availed because of the peculiarity of the Syrian nature, but the use of indirect methods brings out from these Arabs a singular confirmation ot the statements in the scriptures concerning the early history of the people. After some anecdotes about Syrian customs the speaker inYited any one to question him about r~lative topics and several points of interest were further illtunined. Dr. Curtiss is a very agreeable speaker and his short informal talk was well appreciated. INTE~-COLLEGIATE. The members of the Harvard foot ball team have been presented with gold souvenir footballs. A student vaudeville entertainment is to be given at the University of·California rn the near future. The Senior law class at the University of Wisconsin has adopted linen dusters and straw hats instead of the time-honored cap and gown. The inauguration of President Butler of Columbia will take place on April 18 and 19. Both days will be made holidays. On the first day the students will hold exercises and on the second day President Roosevelt, Gov. Odell and Mayor Low are expected to deliver addresses.

The class of 1842 will ceelebrat its sixtieth anniversary on alumni day, June 9, and it is hardly necessary to remind the members that Old Union's arms are always open to her sons. The Concordiensis presents in this issue individual histories, as accurate as it was possible to make them, of the members of that class. It has been necessary, as usual, to call on the fraternities for the large share of this information. In the next issue the histories of the classes of '52 and '62 will he given. The Base The base ball season has opened Ball Season. auspiciously for Union, although with a defeat at the hands of West Point. The game was a surprise in many ways. It showed. for one thing, what kind of material Union has for a base ball team. There is a very great danger, however, sometimes in auspicious beginnings for they have the e:ffect of pro- ducing over-confidence in the team and in the student body. The team relaxes their efforts to an extent and the students get the idea that the team will win anyway, whether they turn out and give it encouragement or not and whether they pay up their subscriptions or not. It is to be hoped that nothing of this kind will occur here. The team is doing good work but it cannot keep it up without the moral and financial support of the entire student body. Show your appreciation of the good work by supporting it. The ~ound Building. It must bring joy to the heart of every Union man, whether undergraduate or alumnus, when it is known that the building standing on Union's campus that has required excuses and explana- tions for lo! these many years will soon no longer need these excuses. Through the generosity of Mr. Andrew Carnegie, through Dr. Potter, it promises to be a source of pride to every Union man and to repay for all the years of reproach that it has suffered. It will be a thing of beauty, the central building in fact, and no longer by courtesy merely. Its usefulness is unquestionable. The present library is very inadequate in regard to size and as the library is constantly and rapidly growing this change will indeed be a boon. By the removal of the library from its present quarters in Washburne Hall two large rooms will be gained which can be used as class- rooms or lecture-halls or laboratories, or even a chapel. The authorities have not as yet made known their plans as to the disposition of these rooms. The New York Concert. The failure of the musical associa- tion in its attempt to secure a New York concert this year reveals an extraordinary state of affairs in alumni circles in that city. For several years the clubs have been enabled to secure an audience in Carnegie Lyceum mainly by the earnest endeavors

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 of Mr. Edgar S. Barney, '84, who has taken entire charge of promoting an interest in the association by advertising. and by personal labor tor which he deserves the highest thanks. This yeav he was unable to take upon himself this task and as none of the other alumni in New York and vicinity would undertake it, this :concert, the best paying one of the year, and the real aim .of the spring trip had to be abandoned. Mr. Barney stated that in his estimation a concert should be given in New York no .oftener than once in two years, because the interest .of the other Union graduates in New York required that interval for stimulation. Whether this indicates a soporific effect of such concerts or not, it must be acknowledged that it is too much to ex:pect that one man or nearly so should devote his time without receiving the support and cooperation. of his fellow alumni. At all events Union is no better off than YaleJ for the concert by the latter college's clubs in the same hall in New York was a financial failure. It has been the aim of the present management to control expenditures and avoid doubtful concerts, and th.e association at the close of this year on that account will be in as good financial condition as ever before.

In the third game of the season, Saturday, April 19, Union defeated the Rensselaer Poly- technic Institute team by the decisive score .of 19 to l· In spite of the pouring rain which continued during the :first four innings, both sides played snappy ball, the advantage, however, be1ng with the home team from the start. R. P. L failed to score in the first inning, Union making two runs. The second inning was a shut out for both ~ides, while in the third R. P. I. suc- ceeded in scoring one run. After the third, things were decidedly in favor of Union and the visitors failed to score again in the remaining four innings that were played. Union commenced to pile up the score, in tl1e fourth by making seven runs, and kept up the good work until the end. · M. Devoe at second, made a brilliant double play in the fourth inning, by stopping a liner and fielding the ball to first, catching the n1an forced off first. N. Devoe pitched the entire game and did admirable work in view of the rain which made it practically impossible to control the ball. A three bagger by M. Devoe in the fifth inning and also one by N. Devoe in the sixth were features of the game. In fact, every man on the home team played good ball. Wirth and Bascom played an excellent game for R. P. I., Wirth's work as catcher being ex- ceptionally fine. The summary is as follows : UNION. Griswold, c. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Grout, 3b (Capt.) ......•.....

Entered at .the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Chas. Bunows, 'Printer, {14: State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. Class of 1852. In this number The Concordiensis presents individual histories of all the members of the class of 1852. This class will hold the fiftieth anniversary of its graduation at Commencement. The bulk of the facts has been obtained, as usual, fr01n the fraternites. In some cases the information con- cerning the men has been very meagre, only what could be obtained from the Centennial Catalogue of the college is given. It is the duty of any alun1ni knowing of. any correction necessary in these ' histories to con1municate with the editors. The The management of the track team has Track. succeeded in arranging for a dual meet with Rutgers on May 10 at Ridgefield in Albany. This fact should be realized by every man trying for the team and also by any man having any ability whatever in that direction. The date is only two w~eeks distant and that means that every man will have to train and train hard. Manager Stiles is in. correspondence with the manageme11t of the University of Vermont track team and it is probable that a meet catl be arranged with that institution. And with the new coach, Mr. Thompson~ and the prospects of two meets there can be no excuse for anyone to com- plain because of the lack o£ an opportunity to show what athletic ability one may have. Union has won many a meet in the past against stronger teams than she will meet this year and here is au opportunity to show of what stuff Union men are made. Remember that it is for the honor and glory of the college that you strive. THE IDOL. Thou standest th.ere, 0 Image green, In silence, with the silent elms On either side·, .a.Nd thou between, Borne far from oriental realms. No servile throng-s about thee wait, In reverential awe profound; Nor bless thee in thy mute estate, Nor bow obeisance to the ground. Dethroned, the mockery of fate, The sport of ocddental youth, No blessings now dost thou await, Unlorded lord of all but truth ! A. H. HINMAN, '02 . • '95.-]ames M. Cass was elected to elders' orders by the recent seventieth annual session of the Conference of the Methodist Episcopal church he !d at Saratoga. '95.-Dr. George L. Streeter, who graduated from Union in 1875, has sailed for Germany where he will continue his study of nervous diseases. He will spend about eighteen months in Frankfort, on the Rhine, and upon his return will resun1e his clinical work in the Albany Medical College. '' l I . : . ·' fi I t t'~ ~j I t. '
