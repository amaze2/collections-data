Shortly thereafter, both culprits were seen riding bicycles on campus. New Sports Scheduled l'uesday, May 28 - Some say it is the occasion that makes men great. At Union. C dllege, it was men who made the occasion great, as Security was involved in a wild chase scene over rough terrain and one-wa:y streets that culminated i·n the recovery of a stolen bicycle. Despite the valiant effor-ts of the entire patrol team, the thief eluded the dragnet and disappeared in downtown Schenectady during the mid- afternoon. In a mastery of detective analysis, the patrol realized that only one of the two culprits had a bicycle 1vhen they were stopped· lor questioning only minutes before.

As we all know, Union is not as well equipped with: athletic facilities as it could be, so these new sports had to be ch()sen with one eye on the bank book.

As befits editors of a prestigious college newspaper~ we have decided to take this opportunity to say all the things we'Ve been meaning to say all term. When we assembled our staff in January, it was our intention to command respect and to stimulate participation in the many activities which the campus has to offe-r. We soon realized this was impossible, and boring. There were many obstacles to be overcome in order to reach such lofty goals. Like four flights of stairs in Carnegie, no typewriters, and a budget which wouldn't even pay for a coffeepot. But, a new sense of unity emerged from the ,.fubble of minds, and golden keys unlocked Library basement doors, revealing bodies which were never known to have existed. A new burner and quality subjective reporting permeated the· campus. A paper at long last had been created which could rise above the facts. ·When the new editors took control of Concordy, barely ~400 copies were consumed, and PYE was busy with its weekly collections of remaining papers. As the editors· bow out with this final issue, 2200 copies are consumed within the day, and PYE is nowhere to be found. According to the Concordiensis Survey, there is no correlation between increased circulation and the toilet paper shortage. The Concordiensis staff did not feign knowledge of all the news, but rather promoted lively discussion of issues, never before thought to be controversial. We must thank our staff and friends for their enthusiastic support in this endeavor. We thank the political activists of the school for providing appropriate targets. And we'also thank our critics, but for whom our belligerence would not have been possible. As Torch and Vi hand the presses over to Chris and Rob, we hope that the tradition we have founded will continue, knowing that we have been well read, and that people will believe anything. -Judy and Bill Concordy Target: Would you buy a used car from this man? ,.A QUIET BAR ... .A PLACE TO TALK\ THE Red Fox Inn PIZZ.A FamAY·A: SAnJRD4 Y 5-12 P.M.

Good Luck on finals. · Sincerely, Fiji P~or. Move no one wiH be able to gain the trust and confidence of :1s many people associated with AOC as Mrs. Reid has. ' . .I am not trying to write 'some sort of sob story in this letter. I am merely trying to point out just another incident at Union that reeks of selfishness and egotism on the part of members of the community. lf we are to combat loneliness and rascism and ~stab !ish a sense of community on campus, we all must do our !->hare... and that includes the administration. Do you know \\hy she is being forced to leave'? Because the Dean of Students is insisting that she move het office into the new offices -in Old Gym llall. Well, her job is not one that can be done in a place like Old Gym. She mu11t .be :sl':para.ted from that building in order for the atmosphere of 'her office to 'be maintained. It must be kept as a place where students can come to relax and discuss things going on inside themselves, witho!.lt the pressures of Old Gym confronting them. Sounds trivial'? So it might to most of you, as it did at first to me. But that is only because you do not understand the problems of the AOC program. I have been exposed to the program for a short time and have begun to understand how some people, other than myself, are livintz, f:urfhermore, just to top it off, Mrs. Reid was not even offered the normal cost-of-living increase in salary that was given to other faculty and staff members for next year. Mrs. Reid is one Hear Editors, irreplaceable person. Even in ;\s we approach the last days of leaving she has offered her home the academic year and everyone unci her phone to students who prepares to leave fat the summer, kHow her so that she can continue we tend to try to suppress our tt> help them when they need her. problems for the moment and let . . · ·- ihem wait for' solutions. until , September. Well, the truth of the matter is that if we let that pattern ocCI:lr this time, ,Union will surely face a crisis in the Fall. What can be done to rectliy the si~uation? Well, you might say that nothing much can be done anymore. Right? ... WRONG!!! lhat was the ~:~.nswer given to a group of studnets who went in a lew weeks ago with a petition to ask for a Feconsideration. I hope · that those who are ill the dccision-ma:king levels of the AdmiHistra-tion will review what hus happened and will reconsider the conditions that led to Mrs. Reid's ''resignation!\ Perhaps they will begin to see beyond their own egotistical and selfish whims, and begin to examine their decisions with the best interests of the students in mind. And finally, wh11t can you do? \ot much ... -if you sit down after reading this letter and don't take any action. But if you.<Jre moved hy what you think is an injustice that has been done, I have an idea. Take a copy of this letter, put it in an envelope, address :it to the Dean of Students, and drop it in l,ln inter-campus mail slot. \ow, I don't know if that's the place to turn to for a review of the decision. But 1 look at it like a c<tse of the \Alice's Restaurant Hlues.\ lf one person sends in a copy of this letter, t·he Dean and the rest of the administration will probably laugh. But if fifty people... eighty people... a hundred people send in this letter, perhaps students will be taken seriously for once, and the case \\ill be reopened for a review. I've said my piece, and given you my idea. It won't take much to put into action, but it's up to all of us together. Good Luck. If \\C don't succeed, or at least make an attempt, Union will be in for some hard times in the Fall. r Sincerely, Corwin What I am referring to is the \resignation\ of Mrs. Reid, Director of the AOC Program at lJ nion · and Coordinator of Supportive Services. We are losing an individual who has been with the AOC Program since its inception at Union five years ago, and before that worked in the Upward Bound Program. She is a sincere, dedicated and hard \\ orking person who radiates warmth and love to most everyone she comes into contact with. Her knowledge of further programs and opportunites for those in the AOC will take a long time for anyone else to equaL It is tmfortunate that she has been forced to her decision, for she is an irreplaceable individual. Who dse could be found who'knows each individual in the program as well as she does? And who is going to be found who can be trusted for the advice, consolation, and encouragement that she gives when it is appropriate'? The answer is that no one will have an easy time filling- her shoes.

JEAN CASSIN Students and faculty members met together on Wednesday, May 29 in West College library to discuss. some of the problems of Union College. About 30 students (over half of them freshmen) and Five faculty members, including Provost Enteman and .Professors :'ilichols, Schick, Kershner, and P. Allen atte.nded the meeting. The ·main topic of the meeting, whicn had been called by Matt Brief, was to be the revival of the Student Center, but the topics of discussion ran from security to women's .athletics. Many students said that campus security, while not the .. number one problem,\ is or should be one of the school's basic priorities. A feW related incidents which they had witnessed o.r exper·ienced themselves, indicating that they felt that the problem required immediate attention. l)rofessor Nichols and Provost E nteman suggested that students 111ight set up a volunteer escort and sec11rity service which would help ensure student, safety on campus at night. Both Nichols and Enteman, as well as many students, wondered how many students would vohmteer for such a plan. Student suggestions to alleviate the security problem incuded: a direct phone line to the security office, mote security manpower to cover the night and early morning hours, and more publicity of the problem to make students more aware of the seriousness of the issue.

No ·matter how long this might take. l\here is no time. Only change.\ hnan.u Amiri Baraka l\he C ohgress of Afrikan People is sponsoring an historic event-the first Afrikan Women's Conference-on the 5th, 6th, 7th of July, 1974 in Newark, New Jersey. The Conference has been called as an important step toward heightening- the political uwareness and educational\ development of Afrika-n women in. order that we may more effectively strive for the unification of all Afrikan People. The World. Liberation of Afrikan People is our struggle and the goal toward which we move. And our conference is more· than words well-placed. The workshops in Education, Social Organization, Politics, Health, C omm un ica tions, and· Guinea .. Bissau lJy GEORG-E M. HOUSER J\ new state in Africa has just proclaimed its establishment as an independent Republic and is now seeking recognition from the nations of the world. This in itself is not. unusual. It has happened with frequency in Africa in the last decade and a half. What is unusual is that Portugal, the European .power which has for . decades claimed control over this African country, still refuses to acknowledge its right to self- determination, and the liberation struggle continues. The country \1-hich has now proclaimed its independent status is Guinea- Bissau. lt is about the size of Rhode fsland, Massachusetts and Connecticut, with a population of close to one million people, and lies between Senegal and the Republic of Guinea in West Africa. I his summer I was fortunate enough to be able to go inside Guinea-Bissau with the PAIGC (the African Party for the li1dependence of Guinea and Cape Verde), the movement which has led the struggle for freedom. l was struck by the strength and efficiency of the movement which for some time has been operating effectively as a government for the majority of the people in that country. The new government is not in exile. The PAIGC has had external headquarters in both its southern and northern neighbors. But the real movement is in the country. It was the first meeting of the popularly elected National People's Assembly which, on Monday the 24th of September at a place called Madina Boe, in the eastern region of Guinea-Bissau, proclaimed the new Republic of Guinea-Bissau. The PAlGC has established a network of administrative institutions inside the borders of their country-schools, hospitals, teaching centers, a court system, etc. which are serving the needs of the people. 1973 · has hccn a tragic and t~sting year. for the P AIGC. On .January 20, Amilcar Cabral, who \\as founder. and the inspired leader ·Of the PAIGC was cruelly assassinated in a Portuguese plot to split the party and destroy the liberation struggle. My visit confirmed my conviction that the Portuguese plan had misfired hadly and had in fact led to an intensificatj,on .of the pe.ople's ~truggle. The movement; its leaders and its people were inspired by the necessity to re- double their efforts in order to make up for their tremendous loss. I even visited what had been an important Portuguese military base in the southern region, a place called Guilege which the I>AIGC captured in late May. A short while before he was killed, Cabral had announced that during 1973 the PAIGC would proclaim the existence of the htstitutional Development reflect o,ur seriousness. W orksho.p lectu{ers are Afrikan Women and Men from the Americas, liberation movements, Wes.t Indies and progre~sive Afrikan countries. As we come together, our working ideology has three components Nationalism ,because we, as a people, make up a nation, and to survive our commitment is to .struggle to see that our Nation is liberated; Pan- Afrik.anism because Afrikan J:ieople all over the world will be united or remain oppressed; and L!jamaa-Socialism because we · will · return spiritually and attitudinally to our own traditions while scientifically creating a technologically oriented modern J\frikan personality that will develop cooperative systems and collective institutions for achieving self-determination, self- respect, and self-defense, and the control of the world's wealth by the masses of people in the world. 1\.s Afrikan Women we understand that the all• encompassing seriousness of our struggle demands that we fulfill a \ ital and necessary role in the movement toward National Liberation and World Afrikan Liberation. We understand that. this role is one that we, as distinctly Afrikan Women, must fulfill, or there will be no nation--not in the community sense, the national sens~, nor the . state. This was not seen as a \Declaration of Independence\ hecause they were alrei=!dy operating as an independent entity but as a formal proclamation calling on the countries of the world to recognize the reality of this· independence. Twelve days befote his ·assassination, Cabral wrote a international sense. We understand that the house, at any point in the struggle, is the smallest viable unit of the nation itse\if_.and yet the ~ouse will not fully and completely exist until our goal is accomplished. We understand that we will no longer deal as \individuals\-an isolationist and death-slide which is suicidal at best. We understand that our job is tremendous-but then so Is our strength. And it is that strength, collectively, moving with the growth of our collective consciousness, that will insure our victory just as it insures the righteousness of our struggle. !,Ianning Committee Social Organization Work Council Congress ~f Afrikan People Dean Moore offered some suggestions to the incoming Assistant Dean. He suggests that he know exactly what his duties will be. He should, also, work closely and as effectively as possible with the Black students· and their organization. He should work with the BSA to set goals lor the organization, such as making Hickok House more of a living and learning situation, or set up a college placement office to provide information on special programs for Black students.

T. Watts PERSPECTIVE c More Wrong Than Right Text of Thomas Watts Statement Bla~k students must, from time to time, strenuously .resist attempts by the white academic world to reduce the very real · and persanal conditions that Black students endure into antiseptic collections of social data d~signed for the problem- .· solving mechanism of Aristotlean logic. The attempts to put ~he problems of Black people into such White terms have · always generated mountains .of legislation only, but have failed to provide adequate housing for Black people, have .failed to feed hungry Black.children, or have failed to free the mass of Black people-from the present- system of economic slavery. Black .students at Union fail to see how results in the microcosm situation at Union will differ from those of the macrocosmic American society. . Black people will never be freed from the shackles imposed by white Am.erican society through the continued actions .of white intellectuals, white liberals, or white legislators alone. What Black people need are solutions that have--not been . influenced or tainted by white people. There will he times - during the course of struggle of Black people when logical discourse and debate will benefit Black people, and Black · students. However, against the backdrop of this panel · discussion, today is not one of those times when debate will ;benefit Black people. For this reason, I cannot further . participate in this discussion. · Delivered to the Union Cqllege Community on May Hi, 1974 · at ··TOWN MEETING: What's Right and Wrong with Unioil. On Thursday, May 16, the community of Union College held a townhquse meeting. The subject of this meeting was ''What's Right and Wrong with Union.\ Thomas Watts was one of the speakers at this meeting. To start off his speech, Brother Thomas announced to the community that he no longer wanted to be refeffed to as \Tom.\ There is no need for me to explain that statement because it is self~ eVident. Next he came to the high point of his speech. The speech, which is also printed in the issue, \\as strong and came directly to the point lhis speech had caused a lot of emotions of different degrees t() come from those who had heard it. Dead silence fell over the gym when Brother l\homas and .six members of the B.S. A. walked out of the meeting. There have been many cxplanations of why the seven members. of ~he B.S. A. walked out. The majority of those have been wrong. I will give one member's reason for wa:lking out. It may be the ~arne for the others but generalization is not needed in this instance. I was one of the members who walked out of that meeting. l think that Brother lhomas excellently expressed my feelings. Past history has shown that no amount of talking is going to solve the problems that Black people -face I. in society, and likewise, no amount of talking is going to change how the white population feels about the Blacks here at Union. It is possible that I might attend other townhouse meetings but I know in my heart that conoitions will never change lor the Blacks here. We came half \\ay, but ther,e was no one there to meet us. Weare nowreturning to our extreme. (Peace and Power, Sister Gloria Jones.) Angola Engulfed Dalou The \ener:gy crisis\ let us all know how important oil is. Oil plays a major role in running Cadillacs and making synthetic African prints. for the people of Angola, oil plays the important role of helping to continue the illegal domination of their homeland by the Portuguese. The American .oil company, Gulf, has reached its tentacles across the Atlantic to the west coast of Africa to economically bolster Portugal, which is the poorest nation in Europe, as it carries out colonialist policies. Uy the end of 1972, Gulf had invested $209 million for oil production in Angola (the important oil fields had been discovered in 1966). The company, through tax~s and royalties, paid over. $60 millio 0 ' for oil ope.rations to the Portuguese. This figure represents 13 percent of Angola's pr_ovincial hudget,- and 60 percent of the military expenditures for 1972. (United Nations ·A/AC. 109/L.842, Feb~ 2g, 1973.) Angola's oil supply is estimated to he usable for the next 40 years, \\ith an average production rate of 150,000 barrels· per day. In 1972 the average output was 127,000 bbpd. Gulf explains its tole in Angola by saying that an \international company must remain politically neutral,\ and that Gulf wanted to \'improve the economic and social \ell-being of the African population.\; It is impossible to see how Gulf can stay neutral since the monies it pays Portu¥al are so · obviously necessary for continued oppression in Angola. As far as economic improvement goes, the new roads and airfields being built can only benefit the· soldiers because the Africans (91.1 percent of tht: population) cannot afford cars and airplanes. 0 ulf's \social well-being\ programs have so far been merely support for Portugal's \strategic hamlet'• project (which was first seen in use .in Viet Nam). As yet, over 20 percent of the population has been relocated. Of course, Gulf uses the famous line a~bout \creating more and better Jobs.\ 1-n 1972, of the 276 available jobs, 43 were held by foreigners, 141 by Europeans (l>ortuguese), and 92 by Africans. (The ()range Disc, Gulf Oil Corporation, vol. 20, no. 5.) In addition, a whopping 489 construction workers were hired to w.ork for white contractors. l\he African · population of Angola totals over 5,000,000 people. Gulf :is not the .only group of tlon-Portuguese whites exploiting the people of Angola. It is no secret that the white-minority government of the so-called Republic of South· Africa is supplyi1ig troops and aircraft to the Portuguese to help stifle the liberation forces of Angola. Also, the permanent committee for Foreign Affairs of the Dutch Parliament was presented with a report .entitled \Portugal en de \ATO\ in 1969. (There is a copy of the English version in the BSA Information Center.) This report Jetailed the NATO aircraft, armor and ships the Portuguese military uses against the freedom fighters of Angola. !he people of Angola have reclaimed • one-third of their count-ry. The major Angola revolutionary movement is headed by MPLA (from Po.rt ugl!ese, the People's \tl ovement for the· Liberation of Angola). We can only hope for rurther successes for the brothers and sisters of the MPLA. - T.

Upon asking him.if he had any friends that I could \\rite to, he gave me the address of Dalou Gonzales. I immediately wrote him a letter asking him what was happening, and a few days later I received his reply. I hese are excerpts from his letter that I felt were interesting. ''Dalou is 23 years old and was born in the ghetto of el Barrio on .Ia nuary 14, 195 1. Dalou is a l\aiman (Taino) name and it means \gives light\ or da luz (in Spanish).

Not only is she humanistic in thought, her whole approach toward life and education operates from this foundation. Living in the House Student Alliance of Union College was honored by the appearance of Sister Sonia Sanchez. Ms. Sanchez has achieved international acclaim for her works in the literary field. Very often labeled as one of the \militant\ poets of the 1960's along with such noted poets as Nikki Giovanni, Don L. Lee, et. at, Ms. Sanchez has undergone transition. This ar,ticle will not elaborate on her reading. If you were there, you know it was dynamite, if you weren't, you can check out her works in the B.S. A. Information Center and decide for yo1:1rself. I want to examine the person, because this· is what impresses one most. Very often impressions of writers are formed from works read by the individual. Vaguely familiar with previous works of Ms. Sanchez would lead one to the conclusion that she is an angry woman. However,. first encounter made me recensider. Such a woman would never have brought her twin sons Morani Neusi, and Mungu Neusi. It was not long after this, J detected that these children showed better than average awareness. This was primarily due to their mother's never-ending patience in answering any question they had and to their being educated in Muslim schools. It was from this observation. of such numerous interplays, one can understand how the creation of Ms. Sanchez first children's book might occur. Such a woman would not be so personally accessible if she were angry. As an instructor at Amherst Collese, I slowly learned about the relationships formed between the black students and her. lt is a relationship extending beyond the classroom. Her coming to the assistance of troubled black students, her offering of her home as a temporary recluse for those students, and her door always opened to those· students when Sister Sanchez has been a Mus lim for three. years and needless to say it has influenced her life and her writing. Not as uncontrollably lashing as it once. was, the blatant anger has been: channeled to application within an ideology. _Her notjcea bly _!_n_tense hatred for drugs, was perhaps incited by her husband, Etheridge Knight. He, also a poet, was known to have had pwblems with drugs. Her thoughts of love are hitter- sweet and her true compassion for the destiny of black people sum her up as being someone who is not angry, but sincerely sensitive, aware, and ready. Though the woman is strikingly small in stature, she is a giant of a human being who has the ability to touch the hearts and minds of our people. _ ---· ---- --=----~ I See with My Own Eyes ''The 'maker of this song, while in the spirit world, asks and receives from the Father some of the old arrows with which to kill buffalo ... \ - James Mooney ( iivc me the arrows./ They have t:omc, they have come./ Grey light rims sky;; Earth yawns./ (iivc me the arrows./ Father give them to me./ Rivers llow among L'<>ttonwoods;j Tipis rise ag~inst the dawn.; They have come;/ l ~hall cat pemmican. \At one time, I thought all I wuld ever be is a drunk.

I'm a two-year veteran of the house, this oft-repeated cab trip heing a part of that experience. And, in the lnng run that experience taught me more than ai:I my classes here have done. l.ivi·ng in Hickok can be -.uffocating at times, aod it can be monotonous, but more often than not it is alii you have in the ''Electric City.\ You move in, you move out with free will but there are always strings attached. While \ ou live here these strings-- frayed ~trings, hangman's rope, plastic cord somehow become the network of life. There is always that 4uestion \Why a Black f I ouse anyway?\ Let me ask you, why a house at all? Why not live outdoors? What'? It may rain, 'now or sleet on you? You're not used to the cold Schenectady environment? You need a house for protection? Hey, Hey! There's 1·our answer- -we need Hickok i·n this cold environment, a form of social protection, a source of \\armth. And, please do consider the source. It has atmosphere we as Black folk are used to and thrive on. On the first and second floor of the house hang two full- length mirrors. In those, we see our beautiful bods. But walking through the halls are human mirrors, brothers and sisters who reflect our strengths, our insecurities, our potentials· -we ,ce ourselves in each other and make adjustments from those inner visions. The vibrations of the house keep it rocking, sometimes unnervingly, sometimes inspiringly. And the smells of the house are familiar, telling those who've just entered ''hat's been happening ... these social signals and vibes all make up the house and all make the house a necessity to Black 'tudents on a white campus. !·or you white people who ~now some of Hickok's inhabitants but avoid visiting, 1 'all shouldn't wonder why ;.elations between the races are ' ., ' • 1n the House Don· Harrell on Drums, with Gerald Yancey and Elaine Baldwin doing the steps.
