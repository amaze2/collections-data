This year, 300 more sttJdents than last year voted in the elections. The results of these elections are as follows; Mia Caetano, Student Forum President, Hallie Heller. Junior Trustee, Rachel Schaffer, V. P. Administration, Matt Karlyn, V.P. Academics and Seth Brown. V. P. Finance. The election of Caetano marks an important point in Union's history. Sbe is only the second woman elected to the Student Forum Presidency in the college's history. During her Presidency, Caetano wants to concentrate on helping to create a more diverse campus with more social alternatives. Women, minorities and independents have been, for the most part, excluded from the prominent students on campus. Caetano hopes to set a trend, encouraging peopl~ other than white, Greek, males to run for these positions. This will increase student involvement on the campus and hopefully bring liP the school's morale. Caetano would like to bridge the communication gap between students and faculty. \I would like to see the stigma attached to the Student Forum diminished.\ stated Caetano. The president-elect wants to see the Student Forum taken more seriously. \I believe we can get things accomplished. We just have to take the initiative,\ she proclaimed. A recent example of this 'initiative' is the Mentor Program. A student, not involved in school politics, brougnt up this idea at a past Town Meeting. The idea was then developed by the Student Forum. This is an example of student body participating in their own government. -Caetano wishes to encourage such involvement in her term. \Participation through Town Meetings will bring school spirit up and more people will want to be involved,\ says Caetano~ Caetano also stresses the imp·ortance of social alternatives at Union. \The campus need.s social alternatives,\ stated Caetano. \The Greek system works for 60% of the students, but not for everyone, although everyone benefits from it.\ She explained that everyone enjoys the benefits of Greek parties and various alcohol - free events, such as the Big Brothers/Big Sisters Olympics. Yet, the campus needs social ·events to call its own, not necessarily in conjunction with Greek organizations. This will create a sense of unity and school spirit among the student body. Caetano hopes to instate an all-school fair and spring dance. The fair will include rides, games, prizes, food and Student Forum President-elect Mia Caetano photo h) Hn.tmu P~ttlwdc· the opportunity for the campus to come together in the spirit of Union. This is Caetano's answer to the students' desire for similar activities to Camp Union and outdoor concerts. Caetano, not having sat on Student Forum this year. cannot make any definite promises for the future. Although, she is very o p t i m i s tic for 1 h e accomplishme11ts of the coming year. \We can't change the world, \ Caetano stated, \but by working with the system our goals can be accomplished.\ Gary WillS JO speak · At .commencement ' . - ' . . . : Eleanor Baum,.

In November of 1992, Hull encouraged the student body to participate in the presidential elections. Many students heeded the president's advice and cast their votes on absentee ballots, while fifty •tempted to register Schenectady. .c surprise and dismay all but five were denied to exercise their constitutional right. President Hull was out raged by this and wrote a letter to the Schenectady Gazette proclaiming how \astonished\ he was that students were denied a local vote because \they live in a dorm and only have a post office box address.\ After the presidential elections passed the voting issue seemed to pass out of the mind of the student body also. Although he has not received a lot of publicity, Hull continues to fight for the rights of the students. Assisted by senior, Wendy Holender. Hull is continuing to fight for student voting rights. Out of the 63 voting districts in New York state. Schenectady is one of the five hardest to obtain pennission to vote in. This is because of a survey that every potential voter must complete before being considered for voter registration. The purpose of the survey is to determine the involvement of the applicant in the Schenectady community. Union students are viewed as just \passing through\ and therefore not eligible for the vote. Hull protests this view that Union stude11ts are just \passing though\. He noted that employees of General Electric, who do 110t own their own property and reside in Schenectady for less time than Union students, are allowed the vote. If this is so, why shouldn't students, who are a -part of Schenectady for four years, be allowed to vote? Although the presidential elections are over for the next four years. Hull would still like to see students register to vote and participate in the politics of their school community. \I would like to get the whole student body, 1,900 eligible people, to register to vote.\ Hull stated. He speculated that the reason the Schenectady community is so strict on their voting policies is becatise they a~c afraid that the students w11l become more of a powerful influence in Schenectady's elections than the residents themselves.

This is the fust year that Union College students have attempted a multidisciplinary. mobile robot project. In the Spring, of 1992, there was talk amongst the engineering department about making a robotic project an option for a sellior engineering and computer science project. While none of the professors involved are robot experts, each was able to contribute his or her area -of expertise. Professor Ch~rrice Traver initiated the pl'O!)ect and offered· her kno\Wle d ge in microprocessors and interface circuitry, Join Spinelli, his experience in mmmunications. David Hemlll endinger, his expertise in c<Jmputer science, Professor Jag<lish G~jjar, his expertise in se11sor technology and power el~otroni<: control, and finally Rtuly Eggert and latest additioo Frank: Wicks, helped in the s.lrategic design of the legs of too robcts. Brian Macherone of OCS. also contributed a ·great deal of practical know ledge to the project. This project was ideal in terms of mixin); different areas of disciplines. Six challenged students decided to take on the monstrous task of creating their own robots. The fall term of 1992 marked the start of these excited students. There are two teams involved: Mike Kimber (Mechanical Engineer), Dave Soldergren (Electrical Engineer) and Jim Teresco (Computer Science) built Robot \Tinbug while Eli Doane (Mechanical Engineer), Gil Bindewald (Electrical Engineer) and Joe Morocco (Computer Science) created ·Robot '\NORM a.k.a. \Non .. Qperating Robotic Machine,\ as revealed by Doane. The professors launched the projec.t with the money donate4 by the Internal Education Fu11d. The two teams of students worked on paper designs and research throughout this past fall term. Construction began in January. There was, however, one requirement: the students had to construct a legged machine, opposed to one with wheels. \A legged machine posed a greater challenge, \Professor Traver states. The main goal was to have three legs on the ground at one time. Professor Wicks e:rcplains that, \a robot is always stable with three legs. The ,mission of this year's project was [for the robots] to walk on uneven terrain, like a foreign planet.\ According to Eli Doane, this missi\011 has not been completed yet. The students continue to sweat in· carrying out this mission in time for the Steinmetz Symposium, on Friday, May 14. Regardless of the fact that \Tinbeg\ and \NORM\ have not yet walked, the project still proves to be a significant success. It not only teaches the students about other areas of discipline other than their own major, but it also allows them to work together as a team in solving inter-disciplinary problems, as .,-done in industry. Before the faculty]student teams ventured to Toronto. Eli Doane. accompanied by Professor Wicks, was the representative of the Union College robot team at NCUR. the National Conference on Undergraduate Research. Dining his spring break, Doane presented an 80 page report, on behalf of the team, in addition to several other detailed poster displays. On April 22, the robotic group left for Ontario's Science Center. The students shared a table with about two dozen other teams, from the US, Canada, and even India. The displays allowed all of the participants to share their computer and engineering know ledge, as illustrated by their robots. While there were quite a few organized events, ranging from walking to slalom .skiing; \Tinbug'' and \NORM simply stood proudly. waving their leg~ in a coordinated fashion on demand.

The Concordiensis NEW·S Professor of the Week Kurt Olsen by Michelle ,Rosenbamm Conc01~diensis write,. Union is filled with stadents who are hard workers and involved in many differellt activities. Many students are so busy they must plan their days carefully. ProfessoF\ Kurt Olsen, a Psychology protfessor at Union exemplifies theUni<m community. He does m:any things besides teaching, ,et he works hard at all he does. Only four years ago, Professor Ol!ren was hiredl for a visiting position. In these follf years he ha~ enlightened his students in several classe:s. He has taught Introduction to Psychology, Abn@lrmal Psychology, Personality and Dysfunctiomal Families i11 Child Development. Even though hi~ focus is on Abnormal Psychology;',. he enjoys teaching Introduction to Psychology since it \keeps him fresh in the whole field of Psychology.'\ Not only does .he teach classes here at Union, bmt he also sees patients outside of the classroom off,campus. Hie has also had e:xperience as a clinical research super'Visor. ms main interest is in chiildren and families. He focus~s his therapy on child abuse. sexual abuse and fami'ly issues. He also studies how children solve problems of social adjustment. He enjo)tls being a therapist, but would never give up the rewarding experience of being a professor. By being a professor he can \wo~k with enthusiastic, smart ·people.\ Olsen did not decide to become a clinical psychologist untH his senior year at Saint Lawrence University. Prior to that time, he wanted to go into the medical field. He received his P.h.D. m clinical psychology at .the University of Rochester. He chose to focus on Abnormal Psychology because of its versatility. Suburban life is comfortable for him since he grew up in Pearl River, a hamlet of Rockland County, New York. It is located south of Schenectady and is about a half hour from New York City. He graduated Pearl River High School in 1977. Presently he lives in Niskayuna with his wife and three children, ages eleven, six and three. He enjoys the pleasures of rural live. Besides teaching and co11nseling, Olsen has many hobbies. At least three days a week: he plays basketball during his lunch hour. He also enjoys listening to various kinds of music. including R.E.M. His love of natiJTe and environment is ,'!~)parellt as he frequently goes biki11g and camping at Lake Placid. Ttits past summer. he and hi.s eldest son, climbed Moun~ M:J..:'•;y, the highest mountain in New York State. It was a IItke over one mile. Unfortunately, Professor Olsen will not be part of the Union faculty next year. He was only hired as ~ visiting position. The adn1inistration wanted to switch his position to a tenure position. This led him to go on a job sear<:h. He will be working at Lycoming College in Pennsylvania. \I have enjoyed the opportunity to learn how to teach at Union College and to meet many intelligent students,\ stated Olsen. He will miss Union, however, he will not miss the t()wn of Schenectady. He will live in a small rural area just outside of the city and he plans to eventually buy some larld, He will be missed by the Union community. After o11ly four years, his enthusiasm and intelligence has enlightened the Union Campus. May 6, 1 993, page A3 Hom,osexuality Faced by Michelle Ellis Concordiensis Staff On Wednesday, April 28, Tom Paniccia spoke to the Unioll student body about an issue which may be even more controversial than abortion. He addressed the argument of allowing gay men to serve in the armed forces. His views are extremely personalized. due to the fact that he was dismissed from the air force after declaring the fact that he was a gay man. The College Center Auditorium has probably never been as packed as it was this evening. Students were sitting crammed together on the stairs, many lined the walls in the back, and the rest filled the balcomy to its limit. Paniccia first reported the chronological events. of his career and then proceeded to discuss why and how be declared that he was a gay man to the public. He was recruited at the age of seventeen to join the armed forces and once enlisted, he traveled rut over tile world. He is certain that he had no idea that he was say when he first enlisted in the Anned Forces. It was only when he was stationed at Davis Air Force Base in Arizona two years ago that Tom Paniccia_came to the realization that he was a homosexual man. He struggled to overcome the issue of being gay and its ramifications when applied to the Armed Forces. However, he decided that he could never come to terms with himself and his identity as a person if he continued to hide 'his homosexuality from himself and his peers. He evaluated his choices and realized that he could noi remain in his silent hypocrisy, which upheld an unfair policy. Therefore, fie began his :personal battle to change, as he phrased it, \The policy that is flawed, not the people\. He contacted a powerful gay rights organization and with their help he was able to accomplish part of his goal. He brought his case to the American people and humanized the topic by appearing 011 Good Morning America on July 23, 1992. The declaration of his homosexuality resulted in his dismissal from the Armed Forces. The twelve years of extraordinary service meant nothing in the inquiry and his release on the grounds that he was gay lmmiliated him. Paniccia did not give up and proceeded t() file a federal constitutional law suit on the grounds that the release violated his fifth amendment tights. His g()al is to win the hw suit and lD be reinstated in tht:: Armed Forces which he cont. on p. A4 Stud~nt :.Eomm Spotlight Administration Addresses Vali-Dine System . · · by· Ml~$:1lcler.

Union College plans to implement the Vali-Dine system next year. However, many siudents express concern abo11t the requirements of the new meal plans. The Vali-Dine plan, as outlined by a memo sent to the campus community, requires that all students living in college owned housing, with the exception of Greek:s who are on their own meal plan. must buy the college's meal plan. Freshmen must llave a 15 meal per week plan while upperclassmen must have at least 7 meals per weelc. Of these meal plans, $200 will go towards a declining balance credit account that can hoe used in any dining hall. Greeks on their own meal plans and off- campus students must buy a minimum of $200 credit on this system. A major concern. voiced by Seth Brown, is the difference in the amount paid for the meal plan and the actual amount spent in the dining halls. Brown explained that when a student goes to Dutch Hollow and uses the equivalent .of one \punch\ he can spend a little over $5. However, the a\Verage dollar amount the college charges for each meal is $8, and the students lose approximately $3 each meal. Vice ·President Mammola explained that these ntLtnbers are an average, and that Union is trying to \ establish an equitable dining program to take care of dining needs and meet college costs.\ Some students are positive about the theory of the decli11ing balance system. Brown noted that using this system, students may eat the value for which they pay. Vice Presid.ent Mammola also said that by 1994-1995 the college hopes to have a complete declining balance meal plan. These points may by used in a new grocery-convenience store in Dutch Hollow, and event11ally in the bookstore, copy machines, laundry facilities and vending machines, said Mammola. An()ther positive point Mammola noted is that the Vali-Dine system eliminates the 19-meal plan requirement for freshmen. He said this has been a complaint for some time, especially from women, who typically do not eat 19 meals a week. Re-presentatives from Webster House presented another concern regarding the requirement for upperclassmen to plll'chase a 7 meal per week plan. Students in Webster House and Smith House live in an atmosphere where they can cook for themselves and have no need for a campus meal plan. Vice President Mammola responded by saying that other col1eges require all students who pay room and board to be on the college meal plan. Ullion does not know exactly !low many students will be 011 the meal plan from year to year. \Our goal is to . regulate this and know specifiocally. Most students are already on the meal plan. The minority who are not will lose that privilege, \ Mammola explained. Members of the Greek community also expressed a concern about members who live down <:ampus but participate in their house meal plan. They will now be forced to be on two meal plans. Vice President Mammola explained that ideally it would be more efficient to have one single dining system, but now they want a plan that will \respect the Greek system... A similar question was raised regarding commuters, who wiU also be required to buy $200 of a declining balance. Vice President Marnmola said it is \part of the cost of going to Union College when costs arc high.\ Dean Alford stressed the need to \expand participation to create a more equitable system to hold the increments that food service costs increase.\ The more Jleople who participate in the program, the smaller the increase in food service costs. Vice President Mammola noted that food service costs increased by only 2% this yea:r. The college hopes to continue this trend. Both VIce President Mammola and Dean Alford expressed regret that some students will lose privileges and be crimped by the new system. Mammola said that they .. have to draw the line somewhere,·· and that they \accept responsibility to fine· tune the system.\ P.S. Write For News!

May 6, 1993, Page A4 NEWS The Coricordiensis Alumni Voices Concern About Housing Policy ---------------------- subsequent empty dorm rooms. The housing policies that emerged from those \lean years\ are 11eactionary, inflexible, intolerant and tmfair. What's even worse, the residence life l>ureaucracy and ;the non-teaching staff in general have _grown two or ~three fold in the past 13 years while the student enrollment !las remained fairly constant, thus creating ~tn even greater demand for dormitOiy revenue. by Andrew Wisoff Union College Alumni Class of 1980 Every couple of years it seems the Administration of Union College feels the need to \improve\ the housing selection process for students. Just like a government bureaucracy and the policy makers that are supposed to lead them, each change is made in the name of \improving\ the system or ma:kin·g the system more \equitable.\ Sometimes the real motive is the need to bring io more tax. revenue (excuse me, dormitory revenue). In the name of an \equitable\ system everything is really subordinated to the notion of maximizing revenue. Something is terribly wrong when the housing needs of the students are considered apart from the purely financial demands of the institution. A couple of years ago the College lost \a lot\ of money because of an unanticipated drop in enrollment and the Robotic Olympics cont. from p. A2 a chance to exchange modeling techniques. Eli Doane admits, \at the beginning of the project, we [the group] had all of these grand designs, but now we would just like to see the robots wa1k.\ In retrospect, Eli states that \so many people refer to engineering as the cutting edge •.. it's more like the bleeding edge.\ Because the robots have turned out to be such a great accomplishment, the faculty members involved hope to continue this new area of theses concentration. Depending on the final outcome of \Tinbug\ and \NORM;' it has not yet been decided if next year's students will start from scratch or attempt to teach this year's creations to slalom ski. Paniccia Speaks cont. from p. A3 , considers to be his only home. He declares that his home is being stripped away from him solely because, \ He is a man that just happens to be gay.\ Below, we stlall summarize the major on campus housing ,problems for tlie past 20 years, where we belie\le the problems exist now, and our solutions to those problems. We're sure that some adrni11istrators will .be disturbed b~ our analysis, l>ut constructive criticism (the ~truth as others see things) sometimes hurts, A major proMem between the early 1970's and 1983 was the overcrowding in the dorms. The basements in Fox and Davidson were storage rooms and West had lounges in the center of the 2n<l, 3rd and 4th floors. Freshmen were \low\ ()fl the \totem ]J(}le\ and had to live on campus. Since upperdassman had \squatters\ rigilts and greater seniority in h<>using lotteries, a.s many a.s 40 freshmen each year were given beds in the livingrooms bet~ween the two doubles in Fo:x and Davidson. This was knowll as the dreaded fifth man in a f()ur man suite (this was a :;courge only known to men). A dozen or so freshmen were also placed in Lenox Road hotising and had to walk to West for the required meal plan. This system was &bviously unhe~t:hy and unfair for many incoming freshmen. Also as a conseq11ence of this system and fewer on-campus rooms about 3() sophomores were forced off campus unless they had Juni-or or Senior roommates or ()ne of the very best Sophomore lottery numbers. Otherwise, most of the students wh<J lived off. campus did so beca11se they wanted to live off campus. Starting in 1978 a gradual evolution began whereby the order of seniority ~cbanged. \Squatters\ rights were eliminate-d and more housing was reserved for underclassmen. However, there was still overcrowding in Fox and Davids()n and a .few upperclassmen were forced to live off-campus Wh~> would have preferred to live on campus. During these years, it is safe to say that the dorms were rullning at 10()% plus occupancy. Prior to 1980, the Dean of Students organization (not countin:g food service) consisted of the J)ean of Students, his assistant and his secretary, a residence Life Coordinator, his secretary, the student Resident Advisors and a Coordinator of Students Activities. That's it! In 1979, the student apartments in West and Davidson were given to residence life administrators. In 1984 tbe basements in Fox and Davidson were converted to dorm rooms and the fifth man in a four man suite scourge was eliminated. About that time, tw<J couples wete added in place of each lounge on the 2nd, 3rd. and 4th floor :in West and two comer doubles <>neach floor were conveFted to lounges. A couple ()f years later, the corner lounges were converted back to doubles and triples. Thus, all of the lounges in West were eliminated .and an additional 12 to 18 beds were created. One fraternity was able to buy a house off campus bef()re the City of Schenectady ·changed the zoning laws to make it almost impossible in 1984. These are the major changes in capacity and net occllpancy during the 1980s. 1986 thru 1989 represented a fairly good equilibrium with almost everyone who w!lllted to live on Campus getting a room Fight for Rights co11t. from p. Al C()mmunity tb~t Union students should have a say in. The college owns the buildings across the campu; on Lennox Road but can not use them for administrative plll'pOses. This is because of a l~w stating that tllose houses can only be used for single family living. President Hull, ideally would like to use these building for administrative offices and free liJ> the on camp11s houses that are presently oco11pied by the administration, for Greek organizations or o-ther student activity groups. He is unable to change this law because he is only one vote. If Union students were allowed the vote then the college could better use its land to accommodate t:he student body's needs. If more students attempt to register to vote and protest the registration survey, the laws can be amended. \ There is no doubt that Schenectady's laws will be tl!rown out,\ stated President Hull, \it is a qtJestion of time.\ Until that time has come the :president encourages students to- attempt to register to vote in !be Schenectady area and sta11d up for their constitutional rights. without overcrowding (except for a few less desirable triples). Also, all of the students who wanted to live off campus (except Freshmen) could exercise their choice. These were the \fat\ years. The College dorms had increased capacity and were running at near 100% oC·cupancy without overcrowding. During the 80s the number of non-teaching staff exploded (particularly those under the Dean of Students oversight). there are more secretaries and coordinators than one can count. there were substantial physic;1l improvements to the campus as well. New buildings as well as infrastructure improvements. What we dislike about most of the newer staffpetsons is th:at their jobs are not just to make things easier for students but that they end up telling students how to live their lives. When a problem or need arises, money and personnel are applied. Once a bureaucracy is established, however, it will always find more work for jtself. Union students have far less freedom in their non- academic lives today than they had 15 years ago. Then came the lean years, 1989 through 1991. When the recession hit in 1989, the enrollment began to drop. The bottom line, more parents could not afford to send their sons and daughters to Union. With the Jncreased capacity in the dorms, and a budget based <>n a bloated bureaucracy, the College lost money. Did the College try to cut costs? No. Instead they continued to charge more for tuition, rooms, meal plans and fees. When the long time Vice-President of Finance for the College tried to trim a few expenses he ran afoul of President Hull's no lay-off policy. Bye, bye J<Jhn. It is certainly reasonable that the College should require more students live on campus Security in order to fill the dorms when the emoHment dropped. However, the policy that only SenJors could live off-campus is an over-reaction, inflexible, intolerant and unfair. Todays housing policies are an over-reaction because the nlllllbers last year indicated that some juniors would be able to live off campus this year and even more wiH have to live of:f-campus next year. The present Freshmen class and the incoming freshmen class are substantially larger than the outgoing clas~es and it is obvious that the bottom in the class to class enrollment curve was reached two years ago. By the time tile new policies went into effect the losses had already occurred and now the policy is an over-reaction. Welcome to the world of economic forecasting. 1'he policy is inflexible because it does not give Ju11iors and Seniors and equ.al chance to live off-campus. By the end of the Winter term admissions should know within plus or minus 10% the size of the incoming class. Based on those numbers a signup could be initiated the frrst or second week of Spring term allowing Juniors and Se11iors a fnst come first serve op(lOrtunity to liye off campus. The initial maximum number could be set low to reflect the possibility that the incoming class would be on the low side of the estimate. By the fourth or fifth week a second sign-up could be initiated, allowing for more Juniors and Seniors to move off-campus as .persons on the fust list either change their mind and stay in the lottery or more is known about the incoming class estimate. The policy is intolerant because it does not allow for change merely because a policy is a policy. Once an administrator or bureaucrat makes up bis/her mind, they are afraid that any change will cont. on p.

HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AIDS? DEAR DR. LAMB: How many people really know what AIDS is? I would appreciate it if you would explain how you know you have AIDS. AU I've ever heard was how you can contractU, but not what it is, how can it affect you and why. I'm 76 years old. DEAR READER: lf you don't have sex with anyone who is infected with the AIDS virus, don't use any needles that are contaminated with the AIDS virus and don't receive any infected blood or blood products, you won't get AIDS. It is that simple. The risk of getting .infected blood or blood products today is extremely low. The AIDS virus can be trans- mitted from mother to child. AIDS is often a sneaky disease. It may not cause any symptoms at all when a person is first infected. In others, it causes a flu-like illness within three weeks to three months after being infected with the virus. The symptoms are so non-specific that they could be caused by any number of illnesses. The acute illness may cause fever, sweats, fatigue.., muscle aches, joint aches, headache, sore throat, diar- rhea and a rash over the trunk along with swollen. lymph nodes. A person might think he has infectious mononucleosis, the flu or any num- ber ofillnesses. The acute phase, if it occuts at all, usually lasts less than two weeks. A person may again be asymptomatic. It is after this initial illness that the ELISA test for AIDS becomes positive. At a later date, a person may begin to lose his immunity. That makes a person susceptible to any number of infectious illnesses that the body's inunune system would ordinarily protect one against. The virus may also invade the nervous system. In this latter stage of AIDS, a patient will lose weight and be acutely ill. Until th.is latter stage of AIDS oc- curs, the only way it is apt to be detected is with blood tests. That is why screening blood tests are so im- portant if a diagnosis is to be made. To help you better understand how the virus affects people and how to protect against AIDS, I am sending you Special Report 115- WS, Protect Yourself from AIDS. Others who want this report can send $3 with a long,. stamped (52 cents), self-ad- dressed envelope for it to THE HEALTH LETIER/115-WS, P.O. Box 5537, Riverton, N.J. 08077. Readers should be aware in advance that this is a very explicit report deal- ing with exactly how AIDS is trans- mitted and how it is not. ©1993 by King Features Synd.

Fran Goldstein · Jodie Adams LETTERS The Encouraging Forum Election Last Friday, nearly seven _hundred students students voted in the. Student Forum Presidential and Vice Presidential elections. AI-· though this constitutes only about one-third of the student body, the turnout was encouraging. Last year, there were about three hundred fewer students who voted. Additionally, five students ran for Student Forum President, as opposed to the uncontested election of the prior year. Across the platform, most positions had more candidates. -Does this mean that more students care about where their school is headed and about making themselves·more well-rounded students? The easiest response to this seemingly rhetorical question. would be no, this year was merely an aberration, and the number of students who are interested in promoting themselves and their school is the same. Although it would be impossible to say that the problems that are encountered in trying to motivate people to become involved in activities have evaporated, it is obvious that students are communi- cating with each other about the ideas they have for improving the social and academic atmosphere at Union: . The first annual Student Forum Presidential Debate was held the Thursday before the election, and at least one hundred students and faculty members came to the debate armed with questions about issues that concerned them. Among the topics discussed were the possibility of an honor code, the lack of diversity on the campus, the need for for cultural education, and the lack of community at Union. These issues were discussed at length, and the debate was extended at least thirty minutes beyond the scheduled ending time. Obviously, some members of the Union College community are seeking to make Union a haven for social and academic growth. It is necessary for students to band together to discuss their ideas, and for the student leaders to present a well-founded consensus opinions to the faculty and administration. Perhaps we are headed in this direction.

Human Rights To the Editor: I would like to thank Alexandra Kreisler for tile interesting 1 and informative article of the IEF and Minerva funded \Evening in Human rights.\ It is a great pleasure to have worked on this important project with Junior Sociology major, Rachel Kest, and Joanne Tobiessen, Director of tile Career Development Center. I look foreward to participating Thursday the 6th in the human rights evening. Come at 7:00 to learn about human rights problems and what you can do with a career in iluman rights. I would like to make a small correction in Alexandra's very fine Concordy article. While, in Fall 1994 I will place some tenn abroad to Brazil students in human rights agencies, I cannot promise that Professor Kaplan will place her \Internship in the Delivery of Social Services\ students (Winter 1994) in human rights agencies. In past years, some students in Professor Kaplan's internship program have worked at the Rape Crisis / Women's Shelter. These, by their very natme, are human rights agencies. And, it is in this sense that some of Professor Kaplan's internship students have in the past worked on l11Jman rights concerns. However, Professor Kaplan will teach the Winter, 1994 Sociology internship course, and it is she who must make the agency placements. Not all of Professor Kaplan's internship students will work in a human rights agency. I hope to see you on Thmsday at the \Evening in Human Rights\ 7;00 p.m., the CDC Martha K. Huggins, Professor of Sociology Newspaper Content To the Editor: I am writing to the Concordiensis not as a member of its staff, but as a member of the college community. I want to express Iriy dismay over what our paper has become, and my concern lies within the Features section, namely. Uncle Edna. Although at frrst this question and answer column was amusing, I've watched it evolve over the past year into vulgar, rude, and offensive smut, reaching its disgraceful peak with last weeks issue. I'm confronting the vicious attack on \Paul from Hastings.\ It is obvious that someone in FeatureS has made use of their power of publication to release a personal anger against this individual. Although his full name is not given, \Paul\ is probably intelligent enough to know he's the victim of such excessive ridicule. To devote an entire column to the ruthless defamation .of one person can only be seen as immature and unprofessional. The purpose of a newspaper is foremost to report campus news while simultaneously and secondarily entertaining .the reader. However, it is my opinion that somewhere a line has been crossed and what was once enjoyable is now shameful gossip comparable to the National Enquirer . I would like to think tllat, for the amount of diligence involved in producing the paper, there would be a greater concern for providing · the college community wit-h quality articles and not allow the paper to be abused and used merely as a means of slandering our fellow students. As I read last week's C o n c o r d i ens i s , I was embarrassed to have my name included in the staff listing, and would hope that the rest of the staff aspires to more professional and respectable journalism. ['m sure that by writing this I'll become next week's \victim\, but tbat' s a chance I'll take in an attempt to inspire a movement away from the overall sarcastic tone the paper has assumed. Let's hope that Features will re-examine its purpose and work on providing a classier production. Eileen M. Colkin Class of 1994 DO YOU WANT TO TELL THE UNION COMMUNITY ABOUT AN IMPOR- TANTEVENT?

The Concordiensis Mentor Program Mentor Program Begins! First the committee would like to thank all who have signed up to participate in the new Mentor program. Over the past two weeks we have had over 300 .people sign up! The main reason for this letter is to inform those new Mentors. of the events in the next few months. Once the committee has th.~ list of incoming freshman, we will proceed with randomly matching you UP' with a sibling of the same gender. It came to my attention .after a conversation with an admissions officer that transfer students should also b~ included in this program; they' too will be assigned an upperclass Mentor. Once the matching process is complete, you will receive the name, address and phone number of your freshman or transfer student (some Mentors will receive two students) over the summer at your home address. The .incoming student will also receive your name, home address and phone number at that time. Fmm that point it is up to you. '1'1.-y to contact that person to help them feel more at ease befor~ they get on campus. Also, try- to encourage them to ask any questions they may have, and to contact you during the summer. Once back .at Union, it is up to you and your siblings to exclumge campus addresses and phone numbel'S. We are in the process of scheduling fall term events for Mentors and their siblings. Two ideas that we will try to schedule are a dinner during the first few weeks of classes, and a weekend camping trip. The activities are optional, of course,. and you will get further in formation during the summer. This program has a great deal of potential not only in easing the transition into Union college life, but in creating a more unified community on campus. It is very exciting to institute something. new at Union. From the i11itial idea brought up by Veronica Rogers and Katy Deely faU tenn in the Town Meeting, this program is becoming a reality. With a lot of determination and effort, Peter Savage, Jon Miller, and Alex Sklavos and' myself worked to create this program. Along with these people, many worked at the booth getting people to sign up. Everyone's efforts have paid off and are greatly appreciated. Lets make the Mentor program a new tradition! I Its not too late to sign up (there is a clip out fonn in this issue). If you have any ideas or questions please contact me at 372-3534, Pete at x4106, Alex: at x4112,. Jon at x4167. Again. our sincere thanks to those who have signed up already. Mia Caetano '94 Mentor Program, Chait Schenectady Violence To the editor: I am, wt:iting concerning an incident which happened about 6 P.M_ on Tuesday evening, as myself and four friends were walking to dinner. I believe that it is quite relevant to the ongoiE,g student vs. \doid\ debateo.. But first let me point out that I am stating the facts exactly (or as close to exactly) as possible. I am not bigoted, am considered a \Liberal\ by most ()f my friends. and though up to tllis point I never liked Schenectady all that much, by neithel' did I hate the people. Yet, I digress. So here it is: As myself and the four others(all male, one of whom was riding my bike) rounded the corner between Becker Houseo and Silliman, 10-12 Afro-.American youths about 16 years old or so, came towards us from the direction of Memorial Chapel. The~ were all riding bikes, moving quickly, and taking up the entire sidewalk. Before my friends and I could step aside, one of them bumped into the front person in our group and nearly slammed into me. None of the youths stopped or even attempted to go around us, even though they were riding on the sidewalk. And here's where it got interesting. As the last few rode by, I heard one of them, who had already passed, exclaim, \That Trek is a fat bike!\ As I turned around to see who had complimented my . bike (I assume that's a compliment), The last guy in their line tossed a glass of water, which he had been drinking, at me. It coated my shirt, and sprayed me from my head to my feet. They then road off quickly, and considering that they outnurnbered us 2:1, it was probably for the best Now my question is, Why? Not wily did they ride off, but why tmow the water. Was it, as yo\1 have said, a statement of envy over the fact that my friend was riding an expensive mountain bike? Weli if so, then maybe he should spend the summer flipping burgers in an Arby's, as I did. to earn the money to buy one. And if that's n1>t it, was he just being a pain in the ass for the hell of it? I Catl't understand it, but simply put, if that's the way \doids\ act on ou~ campus, then keep them off. The people in Schenectady can comptain all they want about Union students being .rude. But, in my opinion, until we start pltysically accosting them, and they find another means of financially supporting their \fair\ city, they can just shut the hell up. Sincerely, Andrew C.Siegel. LETTERS GenEd Complaints To the Editor: Here is a little advice for whomever is running this whole GenEd thing: My first experience with a GenEd course was fun-filled and even so popular freshman preceptorial. I had just settled in here at Union and this was one of my first classes; fortunately I was one of the lucky ones, I had an excelled teacher and I got something out of the dass. While I was taking the course, I spoke with many other freshmen who were also enrolled in precept, but had different teachers. I often read these students papers to see what kind of things they were discussing and writing about in their classes. To my surprise, the quality of work produced in some of the other classes was not the same as in my own. In fact, some of the papers I read were just pitiful, What was even more pathetic was that some of these student's pitiful papers were receiving \A's\ and \B's\ from their professors. I would often look over these so called \A\ papers and find not only mistakes with regard to subject matter, but simple grammatical mistakes that the teacher did not pick up on while grading. I once showed my professor a paper written for another section and asked him to estimate a grade for it, he said \C\ at best. .. that same paper had received an \A\ in the other section. So, this got me thinking, I am working my butt off for an average grade but I am learning. Some other people are turning in work of lower quality and getting excellent grades, but they are not learning anything. Well, I think that for $26,000 we should all be learning. I am not saying that I want a higher grade, because I earned what I thought a fair mark for the course. I am saying, however, that the freshman precept • on the other whole, was taught on a very inconsistent level. This in turn discouraged me, the impressionable freshman I am, as to the quality of some of the other cour5es that are taught here at Union. As I understand it, all the professors teaching the course meet once a week or so to discuss how everything is going. This is evidently not enough to ensure consistency. First of all, do the professors go through any formal mandatory training which enables . them to teach this course ... N 0. Why no? It seems logical, brush up on a few grammatical skills and what not. Second, why ~ ~ someone other than a EXPRESS YOUR OPINIONS, WRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR.

Students wh() have professors that usually teach physics, for example, are probably not going to learn the same things as those sttJdents who have an English professor, and those students are going to end .up writing in a much different manner. One easy remedy for this problem would be to make this course a pass/fail course. Another, perhaps better, approach would be to have the papers read by a panel of precept. teachers. This way consistent grading ·would be guarenteed, as some sort of an average would be established. I see this as a relatively simple and direct s-olution to this problem. The consistency in the teaching and the grading of such an introductory course is very important and something definitely needs to be done.

Jn an effort to be Executive Office of the President Washington, D.C. The President announced that he has transmitted to Congress the National Service Trust Act of 1993. The Act represents innovative public policy founded on traditional American values: offering educational opportunity, demanding personal responsibility, and building the American community. In affirming these values, the Act also rejects big bureaucracy -- reinventing government to unleash the ideas and the initiative of the American people, The President's initiative will: 1) Build the American community through a new domestic Peace Corps that brings Americans together to tackle pressing national problems. 2) Offer educational opportunity by providing educational awards to hundreds of thousands of students who serve our country; and overhauling and simplifying the student loan system -- saving taxpayers billions of dollars, lowering interest rates, and expanding repayment options. 3) Demand personal responsibility by requiring Americans who borrow to repay their loans in one of two ways -- either through service or through repayment plans that make it tougher to default. 4) Reinvent government by streamlining federal bureaucracies, relying on locally driven initiatives, and creating flexibility for students and competition among programs. The Act has two basic parts, the national service initiative and the reform of the student loan system. The centerpiece of the Act will establish a Corporation for National Service that will offer Americans who do vital work in the national service program a $5,000 educational award in return -· roughly the average indebtedness of a graduate of a four-year, public institution. In addition, the Act includes a variety of provisions to prom()te service by all Americans and in all fonns, The Administration's Student Aid Reform Act will provide all borrowers with flexible repayment options, including EXCEL Accounts, which allows borrowers to repay their loans as a percentage of their incomes.

In addition, borrowers will be able to switch repayment plans as their financial situation changes. The length of repayment will depend on the borrower's level of debt and income. The legislation requires the Secretary of Education to publish regulations on the specific provisions of this income- contingent plan. including the percentage of income to be repaid each year and the length of repayment.

The Concordiensis The Nature of the Beast by Dylan J. Ratigan Business Editor There once was a time when bigger always, meant better. The epitome of this saying, was held high for all the world to see in the fo:rm of America's booming corporate giants. Ask any economist about \economies of scale\ and s/he will talk to you for hours about the am~ing benefits of mass production and huge factory assembly lines. Henry Ford was considered as a genius for his amazing innovations, and the way in which he was able to utilize these miraculous \economies of scale\. About ten years ago globalization became cliche, and every pundit that you could get your hands on was writing about how the best was yet to come. Just wait until the trade barriers fall, and the market truly globalizes they said. Only then will we really see the explosive potential that these big businesses have locked up inside of their huge corporate headquarters. Well, the EC has arrived, NAFTA has been created, and the effects are soon to be felt. The trade barriers are falling, free trade is \in\, and before we no it, tariff is going to be a . dirty word. Where is big business today? ffiM has been better, Phillip Morris certainly isn't in the midst of some sort of explosive economic growth, and hundreds of their fellow e wallowing giants have never been worse off. What happened? The party Hne said that the falling trade barriers would make it possible for the big corporations, and only the b~g corporations to exploit this global market for the cheapest money going, and market products in volumes that mangers had only dreamed of back in the dark days of the tariff. Falling t:Fade barriers have made the market more efficient, and the companies with the most fat, big businesses, have been made terribly vulnerable. At the same time this free market bas reduced the barriers to entry enough that the small and medium sized companies, that once were denied access to larger markets, now have the ability to tap into this global free market and capitalize in ways that many thought was only possible by a limited group of corporate giants. Small companies are now able to sell their products worldwide, something that was previously rendered impossible due to th.e high cost of exporting. This has created a market that is much more competitive than anything that IBM every dreamed of having to deal witll. Another blow to big business has been the coming of the computer age. The use of computers, has actually narrowed the economies of scale. Factory assembly lines have become automated making it .possible to produce goods in small volumes at costs that 11sed to be reserved for the big corporations. This Career Development V~~;.~~ Center BUSINESS 0 is combined with the fact that computer prices are plummeting which makes them more accessible to small companies than ever before. In general, many of the barriers to entry have fallen, and most of the markets have beeo. infiltrated by these small and medium size firms. Other trends are giving the corporate giants headaches as well. For instance, consumers have been given a wider variety of options to choose from when they go shopping. And brand name latels no longer carry the weight that they used to. Todays consumers are price driven, and it is the little companies that are taking advantage. Todays big corporations are scrambling like never before. They are peeling layer after layer of middle managers in hopes of reducing costs. Efficiency is the name of the game, global or not. Many corporations have broken down into smaller more efficient \federations\ in hopes they can compete with their smaller COUIIterparts. For many big corporations this ma:y not be enough, and we may see a new age of corporate \break-ups.\ There are exceptions of course, the commercial airline industry still has tremendous barriers to entry, but on the whole the business world is headed for a drastic change. The perfect economy of scale has been reduced in size, and the market is terribly competitive.

This increase can be attributed to the recession, the loss of social stigma previously attached to bankruptcy filings and abusive use of the Bankruptcy Code. In the 1990s, it's imperative that consumers recognize the importance of taking respon- sibility for personal debt and plan· ning ahead to avoid financial stress. Responsible financial manage ment can be achieved in three steps. first, make a budget and list spending priorities; second, stay within your budget and track spending carefully; and third, learn to recognize the warning signs of financial overex- tension by asking yourself these questions: Are you always late paying your bills? Do you pay your hi lis in 60 to 90 days rather than 30? Are you unable to make the mini- mum payment required on your credit card statement(s)? Are you frequently approaching your credit limit? Do you use checking account credit lines or cash advances to pay your bills? Do you routinely tap your savings to pay everyday livin~ expens~s?_ Do you juggle bills, decidmg which bills you can pay and which ones you can't? Do you delay visits to dentists or doctors because you can\t afford them? Have you been turned down for credit? If, despite your best efforts to st:ly out of debt, you suddenly find your- self with too many bills to pay and too few financial resources, cont:lct your creditors immediately and seek help from a reputable credit counsel- ing service.

Saxton, Porter & Speir Scholarship THE WORKS OF THE COMTEMPORARY CHILEAN PLAYWRIGHT SERGIO VODANOVIC (b. 1926) exemplify the high level of creativity and innovation in Latin American theater today. Vcdanovic has been actively involved in the theater since 1947 and is currently a tacul.ty .member at the Catholic University of Chile. His thematic concern and his subtle attacks on societal corruption and greed .make his theater one of extraordinary contemporary appeal in Latin America. Vodanovic's social zealism is tempered with a sharp study ot the psychological mechanisms of power. El delantal blanco is a poignaJ~t farce about the hWl!an struggle tor power at various levels.

Hts objectives\.. The sick uung News stories don't always have to be serious, political or profound. Our world thrives on the unimaginable, which means that events happening amongst our population should not be looked upon with surprised eyes. Current events in tile news as of the past few weeks have proved my theory. I am thinking of a few examples in particular. Monica Seles, the number one women's' tennis player on the circuit this year was stabbed last week at a match during a break. Seles had sat in her chair on the sidelines and was surrounded by a large audience. Out of the bleachers jumped a young German man wielding a knife, and stabbed her in the back, dangerously close to her spinal column. She was taken to the hospital, and is healing now. Her tennis career is on hold for at least a month, which means she will miss some upcoming matches. It all sounds a little crazy. It wasn't even as if Seles was alone in a locker room and someone stabbed her. She was just resting during a ·break and was stabbed from behind. It is scary to think how random, but a mci en was.

This story started out bizarre even before I found Intervention in Bosnia Service Bill Introduced by Cole Timmerman Contributing Writer Western airstrikes. This is President Clinton's plan to solve the aggression and the \eth11ic cleansing\ in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many students of history, when looking at this plan, are reminded of LBJ's gradualist bombing campaign named Rolling Thunder during the Vietnam War. A bombing campaign that started and stopped whenever Hanoi hinted it was ready for talks. I'm not saying that Bosnia and Vietnam are one and the same, on the contrary; they are different in many ways. The U.S. public. though, is still affected by a part of the Vietnam Syndrome that is applicable to the Bosnian question: the liberals who shouted the loudest for the beginning of the Vietnam war, changed their minds once the grim violence necessary to win became apparent. President Clinton said that, the \conscience of the West\ demands that he bomb Serb artillery and supply lines. However, President Clinton's conscience is half hearted for he is not prepared to introduce American ground troops or bomb the source of the problem in Belgrade. It's only fair ,t<> ask President Clinton if his conscience will hold up when the U.S. bombs kill innocent civilians or when pilots are taken prisoner if he executes his airstrike plan. The new liberal presidency is ready to take military action on humanitarian grounds because they feel that there is little U.S. interest at stake. They think they can soothe their . conscience and then go home if the bombing doesn't work. The world does not work quite that way, though. Once a U.S. wesident commits American forces and prestige he can not afford to lose. Thus, doing nothing would cost President Clinton and the United States less than doing something in the wrong way. If President Clinton wishes to end the strife in Bosnia then I suggest he listen to the military leaders involved and take their advice to heart. The President has to decide what he wants to accomplish since he is not considering full intervention. He must consider when and how the United States will disengage itself. Until these critical questions are answered military action is secondary. The military leaders in America are becoming the unsung heros of the hour. People may condem them for not being ready to attack the Serbs, but if they followed hasty advice and the operation failed, they, not the president. would be blamed. Once again we can draw a clear parrallel to Vietnam. After it was apparent the United States could not win, the blame for the loss was placed on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and General Westmoreland. Instead the blame should have rightly fallen on the Texan hot-head, President Johnson, who committed troops to the jungle against the advice of the military, without any popular support. without any clear goals, and without any plan to withdraw. Who will be the Westmoreland of this conflict, Joint Chief of Staff Powell. or President Clinton? By Stuart Dawrs NSNS Staff writer President Clinton is expected to introduce his proposed national service corps legislation today - a plan that has met with mixed reactions from students and educators nationwide. Citing World War II's GI Bill and President Kennedy's founding of the Peace Corps, Clinton has framed his new plan as the next logical step toward funding higher education while :Promoting a sense of communi~y. By allowing students to repay government loans through a commitment to a period of community service, the White House hopes to inject needed life into the ailing Pell grant system. however, critics contend that the projected 1997 program enrollment of 100,000' is too small a fraction of the nation's 14 millions college students to justify a multi\'billion-dollar program at a time when budgets are becoming increasingly strapped. Compounding the issue is the fact that the President's economic stimulus package recently fell vic tim to a Republican filibuster in the Senate. The package had included $2-billion to help offset the already massive Pell Grant deficit. Although the community service concept has been criticized as too little too late, many view it as a first step in the right direction. \When Clinton spoke on the U.N.M. campus, the crowd definitely seemed to think it was a good idea. Besides the more pragmatic fact that it will give students a rounding they would never receive if they were simply to go into, say, business,\ said Lauri Sagle, a graduate student in American Studies at the University of New Mexico. ''I think that if we are trying to create a larger consciousness of what it's like to be globally connected, it's a good and important idea for students to find out what it means to be a part of society.\ Students majoring in professional .and technical areas have worried that the plan might force them to work in fields for which they have no training or inclination, but administration officials have said the plan will allow for some flexibility. \We're not going to lay out a program where we dictate where (students) are going,\ said Ethan Zindler, a White House spokesperson. White House officials have asserted that the only alternative for reducing the Pell grant deficit is to drastically cut the amount of grants that students now receive. According to a recent study by educational analyst Thomas G. Mortenson, such cuts will hurt especially at a time when the $2,300 maximum Pell Grant only covers JS percent of .typical institutional changes. In 1979-80, the maximum award for similarly-situated students paid 77 percent of those charges. Many students see the filibuster as not only signaling hard time ahead for the President's national service proposal, but also as the beginning of tile end for the spirit of cooperation which seemed to exist in the first weeks of the new administration. \Very few people I know get out of college and actually have a job wai1ing for them these days so T think it (the natioanl service plan) is a good idea, but I just don't know how well it will go over,\ said Mary Roney. a biology major at the University of Hawaii. \I did think before the filibuster that there was a chance of everyone worki11g together, of both parties working together, but since then -I don't know.\ All Statetnents for Student Forum Class Representative candidates are due by MondaY/ May 10 at 5 p.111. in the Concordiensis Office. . :1 ·, .

May 6, 1993 Cycling Races At Williams Scores First Points of the Season by Greg Tomac Contributing Writer After suffering from frostbite at the Army Road Race ~nd • torrential downpours coupled with poor road surfaces at : Cornell, the Union Cycling team ventured to Williams College for a 20 mile criterium · • on Saturday, April 17. Racing in the NCAA Category C race, the small squad composed of Tom Duckett (93), Jamey Rawstron (93), Rick Skoglund (93) and Jonathan Wintsch (95) were eager to score their first conference points of the season on this course. Before that could happen, however, Duckett was involved in a crash that also slowed Wintsch taking both of them out of contention. Active at the front, Rawstron helped push the leaders around the one mile loop until they caught the back of the broken field. As is customary in these multiple lap races, soon-to-be- lapped riders were removed from contention until only one-third of the starters were left. Among those pulled was Skoglund. Rawstron's early efforts proved taxing as he was not able to bridge to a breakaway in the later laps. Nevertheless, he finished strongly in eighth place to give Union its first collegiate cycling points of the season. On the weekend of April 24- 25th, the cycling squad saw additional action as Rawstron, Skoglund and Rob Goodwin (93) took part in the U-Mass Stage Race. Taking place in Greenfield (MA), this race was composed of two stages- a 43 mile circuit race and an 18 mile criterium. The circuit race was comprised of six laps around a rolling 7.2 mile loop painfully punctuated by a steep hill or wall. Barely 3 miles into the race, Rawstron punctured leaving Skoglund and Goodwin to battle the field and the wall. Goodwin was active at the , front for the first half of the race. Unfortunately, he found himself drifting towards the . back after the third time over the wall. It was here that Skoglund lost contact with the main group. Later in the lap a split fonned in the main pack while Goodwin was making his way to ihe front. As a result. he was caught in the second .pack and finished out <Jf contention for placing points. The criterium on Sunday, April 25, proved rn ore rewarding for the Union squa<l. The racing was fast in the first five laps as the blistering pace splintered the field. Two t1ve second gaps separated the pack into three groups within the first two laps. Helping set the pace in the first group were Rawstron and Goodwin. Skoglund, slowed out of the start by a crash next to him. found himself in the third group. As the gaps grew, only the lead group was allowed to remain on the course. With half of the 30 Japs around the half-mile loop remaining. Goodwin decided to toughen the race as he charged off the front. He would soon take a breather only find himself towing the field once again. Both Goodwin and Rawstron were prominent at the front during this portion of the race as they positioned themselves for the intermediate sprints or primes. Rawstron took one of the sprints while Goodwin placed third in another. Drained by their efforts, neither rider could respond when a series of counterattacks led to a three man breakaway. Both riders were left to challenge the rest of the field for fourth place. With two laps to go Goodwin took a flyer, forcing the competition to chase. Rawstron took shelter in the chasers slipstream and, with half a lap to go, unleashed a vicious attack which allowed him to cross the line clear of the pack in fourth place. A spent Goodwin flew in with the pack seconds later in twelfth place. With these results the squad is looking forward to the regional championships at Penn State where they hope to make a major impact in the criterium. ;t:!tsncerthas the O(>nes of our reviewer still shaking.

The lightweight eight loss was the first loss for a Union men's lightweight crew in two years. However, the lightweight four rowing later in the day were given a chance to redeem themselves.

May 6, 1993, page B2 A&E The Concordiensis Sculptor Willard Boepple to Visit Union May 13th DEPARTMENT OF VISUAL ARTS AT UNION COLLEGE PRESENTS: New York City based sculptor WILLARD BOEPPLE will present a slide talk on his work on Thursday, May 13, 1993. The lecture will take place at 11:00 a.m. in Arts 215. It is free and open to the public. Boepple is internationally known for his elegant~ rigorously formal sculptures constructed in steel and wood. Born in Bennington, Vermont, in 1945, Boepple attended the University of California at Berkeley, Rhode Island School of Design, and City CoHege of New York. He worked at Bennington College during the heyday of Formalism associated with the critic Clement Greenberg. Working occasionally as assistant to Anthony Caro, Ken Noland, and Jules Olitski, Boepple got his esthetics straight from the source. He became associated with Acquavella Gallery in New York City in 1976 and had one-person shows there in 1976,1977,1978,1980,1981 and 1985 In 1982 Boepple was stricken with a life threatening illness which left him entirely paralyzed for nearly a year. The slow and frustrating process of recovery, and of having to learn again how to physically make his sculpture, as well as to talk and walk, made his re-commitment to his art all the more remarkable. His sculpture has moved since then away from the conventions of constructed steel sculpture to become \Iona\ by Willard Boeppie ' ., ' . Screaming Trees Scream· Too Loud by Brad Periello Contributing Writer Being an ardent fan of Screaming Trees album Uncle Anesthesia, an issue which Concordiensis chose to ignore when introducing the band to Union College, I was inordinately pleased that my soon-to-he-alma- mater was a stop on the band's current tour. I should have known better. Without impugning the efforts of those who brought the band to our hallowed grounds, I must cry foul. In terms of delicacy, whoever mixed that show had the touch of an enraged rhino. I'd have rather seen my grandmother and her fat friends perform a nude rendition of \King of the Road\ than to have paid five dollars for Screaming Trees at Union. What upset my cart was the variance of quality between the album [ know and love and the concert (thankfully brief though my acquaintanceship with it was) which I'm trying desperately to forget. I can only assume that the band's most recent album, most of which I have yet to hear, is as good as Uncle Anesthesia. God knows the show at Union didn't live up to that highs tandard. To the person who manned (or femanned, for those politically correct members of our readership) the sound board at Achilles Rink; don't quit your day job. rm not complaining that the show was too loud; I like it when the bass makes my ribs vibrate. But I also like to be able to hear the guitar and vocals, too; had the show been properly mixed, my head would have spun from the driving guitar riff of \Alice Said,\ the second song of the program. At least then I would have gotten something for my money. As it was, the over exuberance of the bass and drum mix completely offset the efforts of the other members of the band. I couldn't hear Mark Lanegan or Gary Lee Conner at all. (I date my knowledge of the band - those Seattle bays are so very fickle - from the aforementioned album. Mark would be the vocalist, and Gary Lee the guitarist). This lack ruined the concert. I have extolled the virtues of \Alice Said\ to friends since Uncle Anesthesia came out in 1991; to hear it performed by its authors should have been sneer pleasure. Instead, I found myself embarrassed, cringing every time the overpowering bass mix made the rink's foundations shalce. Gary Lee should give his brother Van a good talking-to. The performance was bett~r heard fifty yards away from Ac.1:illes Rink, where the higher and Lo1- ·er notes of the concert were nicely in. ~egrated - happily, the ground still st. '>ok, bnt I could also hear Mark P. an1i Gary, nicely accompanied by their bandmates. I might have s.wed myself some money and 'Sat comfortably on the grass outsiO.~, enjoying the efforts ()f one of tny favorite bands. But at that point f was so pissed off that I went to drown my sorrows at a fraternity party, where later I was snubbed by one of Uncle Anesthesia's nephews when I tried to say how much I've enjoyed Uncle Anesthesia. It's too bad Bing Crosby's dead. I've heard that he used to give- a great (and well-mixed) show. And apparently he was civil to his fans afterwards, too.

Despite the crisp, precise lines of the steel pieces and the warm, vernacular quality of the wood constructions, Boepple's recent work has an existential edge. Without ever literally invoking the figure this work seems to car,ry a fondness for the things that we see and touch ia the world, and an awareness of their, and our, fragility and temporality. Willard Boepple began showing his work again in 1985, with a one person show of small bron.zes at Acquavella. Since then h.e has had solo shows in New York, London, Boston, and at the Mead Art Museum in Amherst. There was a 20 year retrospective. of his work in the Usdan Gallery at Benningtolit College in 199(). Boepple's sculpture is included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts,~ the Edmonton Art Gallery and Stor~ King Art Center. His second solo show at the Andre Emmerich Gallery in New York will open this May. Boepple received a Francis Greenburger Foundation prize in 1986 and the New York State Association of Architects Citation in 1988.

' . The Concordiensis A&E May 6, 1993, page B3 Serrano : Controversial Ph,otographer Captures Audience ----------~-------------- by Belinda Crago Co-Editor of Arts Andres Serrano~ introduced by Pmfessor Robert Phelen as \one of the most controversial Photographers\ in the mainstream of art today, presented a provocative lecture and slide show in the College Center Auditorium last 'Jhursday April 29th. Recognized by most from his modelling in \GAP\ adds, Senano grabbed the audiences' atteation from. the moment he stepped up to the podium. Admitting his distaste for lecturing because he' \doesn't like to be bored\ or \bore the audience\ Serrano spoke simply and honestly which. encouraged the audience to speak out and question hls works and ideas throughout the slideshow. Serrano introduced his series of photographs addressing various themes such as religion, life and death in Bodily Fluids , race in K u Klux Klan,. the homeless in Nomads'- and death and murder in the M o r g u e . Many of his photographs were painful and difficult to look at, but at the same time, as Serrano reminds us, they are day to day to subjects. Although his themes and subjects vary widely and ambiguously, his photographs seem to embody a constant; each addresses th.e Essential issues of violence and bea atv. In his Bodily Fluids, Serrano flashed the gruesome \Passion\ (1984), depicting Christ's head on top of the body of a bloody, skinless lamb with no introduction. The room ,remained utterly silent until Serrano broke t:he silence with his wit: \Catholics a:lways refer to Christ as the sacrificial lamb. Well ... I guess I reaUy reduced him to this.\ Included in this series were numerous depictions of blood, milk, urine and menstr11al fluid. When he was tired of all the rest of the human bodily fluids, Serrano resorted to filming his own semen in \Cum Shots\ which Serrano humorously referred to as \intimate self-portraits.\ He continued to humor the audien(e with the process and difficulty he underwent to produce these shots. In.Nomads. Setr<tno photographed a series of the homeless he met in parks, streets and on trains in New York City. Each work was titled by the name of the homeless person. After this series, Serrano decided he wanted to shoot unusual portraits of Holocaust Museum Nikki Goldin Arts Co-Editor · Monday April 26, 1993 marked the long awaited opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. The building, situated just off the Mall, was dedicated on AprU 22. The dedication ceremony was attended by both the presidential and Vice Presidential families, twelve foreign officials (the most ever at any such occasion), numerous distinguished guests and many Holocaust survivors. Elie Weisel, famed Holocaust writer and Nobel Laureate gave a moving speech emphasizing the fact that the museum 'is \For the Dead and the tivfng, We must bear Witness.\ President Clinton and Chaim Herzog (President of Israel), addressed the crowd as well. The building itself is comprised of the permanent exhibition, a Holocaust library and learning center and the Hall of Remembrance memorial room. Because of the graphic nature of the permanent exhibit, entrance is recommended for those over the age of 11. In a separated exhibit titled \Daniel's Room, Remember the Children,\ children can learn about the Holocaust through the narrative story of a young boy. I had the opportunity to visit the museum this past Friday and this visit inspired me to tell you all about this museum. What I found most powerful was the personal nature of the museum. From the moment one arrives at the building, he/she is forced to put himself /hetself back in time and place. At the entrance to the permanent exhibition, a visitor receives a card of someone of the ~!lle sex and relative age. On the card is a photo o:f the person and a brief summary ()f their life and situation at the -time of the Nazi invasion. The museum is arranged by time periods begit:ming with the years 1933-1939 and the promulgation C>f anti-Jewish legislation. Visitors begin on the fourth floor and work their way down until the post-liberation years At several points throughout the visit, one can update their identification cards to see how the Nazis affected their person. At the end one finds out whether or not the person survived the Holocaust. The person on my card fortunately survived and emigrated to Israel. / The last room of the exhibition . filters into the Hall of Remembrance, an open, peaceful room where visitors can think about what they have jt1st witnessed and light memoria-l candles if they choose. The Hall of Remembrance also contains the Eternal Flame, lit by Bill Clintoll during the dedication. The museum tells not only of the genocide of the Jews, but also of the atrocities towards Homosexuals, Gypsies (Roma as they were called), handicapped and prisoners of war. the museum also pays homage to those who worked ~gainst the Nazis, risking their own lives and the lives of their families, to save the Jews. By encouraging us to rEmember the past, the museum hopes to educate people and give warning :for the future. it was a very moving experience for me and I strongly encourage anyone planning to come t~ the Washington D.C. area to visit the museum. Tickets are free, bat I recommend getting advance timed entry tickets through Ticketron for a small service fee. masked people- \I immediately thought of the Klan.\ This lead to . his Ku Klux Klan series where Serrano phot()graphed masked members of tile this society. He described interesting accounts of his interaction with these people as a Spanish-American. \I don't like to make statements. My work is unconscious, not overly intellectual.., When Serrano presented his latest series Morgue, ,recently exhi,bited in New York City and Paris, the lighthearted atmosphere turned somber. Each photog.-aph was titled by the nature of the subjects death, including \Hacked to Death\ depicting the crotch of a man clothed in bloody underwear who was stabbed fifteen times by his wife. When asked why he cho~ such a gruesome theme, Serrano responded: \The question for me is not why the morgue but why not the morgue?\ He found no subject unap.proachable.. Other subjects included burn victims and other gruesome murder victims. A most shocking and painful shot was \John Doe Baby\ portraying the tiny clenched fist of a newborn baby who was found abandoned in bag. Just when the audience had given up hope fo.r this depressed artist, he ended his show with a touching tho~ght- \even though this child has passed away, his spirit lives on for me.\ In his introduction, Professor Phelen insisted that in art the \hook was just as important as the substance.\ With this being the case, Serrano's \hook\ worked. Whether it was his unpompous demeanor, honest sense of humor or unconventional means of lecturin~ Serrano demanded and received response that made his controversial and offensive work go over smoother. Serrano convinced the audience that he \[doesn't] like to make statements\ and urged us to interpret it in our own way while \My work is unconscious a11d not overly intellectual.\ Usually one would be a bit hesitant to accept \Blood\, an entire mass of red blood as the whole photograph, or even \Milk\ a similar photo, except entirely white, as work of art. But somehow, Serrano convinced us it was. AUDITIONS: A.R. Gurney's Love Letters -Directed by Thor Benander - No Memorization -No Stage Movement -Minimal Time Commitments Thursday, May 6 : 8 P.M.

May 6, 1993, page B6 FEATURE'S The Divine Frozen Yogurt by Jennifer Unterberg Contributing Writer Thanks to Richard Gorgen, manager at Dutch Hollow, four frozen yogurt franchise owners came to the college center to hand out free samples of non- fat frozen yogUiit (other wise known as 'fro-yo', \y{)g' etc.) .. This is beautiful,\ a Union College student exclaimed, ''it's free and you ,can have as much as you want!\ The frozen yogurt connoisseurs came from all over, eager to participate in a frozen yogurt lover's dream: free samples! Although the samples were not to be distributed until 12:30, students conglomerated in the c0llege center hours before. Talk had begun the night before, plans to meet in the college center at 12:30 sharp, lunch reservations cancelled, and classes skipped. \rm so excited, I'm skipping my morning class,\ one student said. At around ll :00, the first machine arrived. Two girls began pouring their own yogurt, \can we do that?\ people asked. The fantasy of serving your own yogurt, a dream for frozen yogurt addicts. The freedom of pouring the amount desired instead of being at the mercy of that scale at Freshens in which the .. employees so eagerly and analy measure the yogurt content to the ounce (by the way, the employees must measure the ounces or risk losing their job). Around 12:00. more and more students began salivating at the four yogurt machines. From a distance, students attempted to recognize the brands of yogurt from the uniform the pourers were wearing, .. I wonder who that man is in the orange and green shirt. Could it be ... Yes! It's I Can' 1 Believe its Yogurt!\ Students began listing flavors they hoped to sample. For yogurt lovers the chance to sample an ab~:~ndance of yogurts without having to buy an obligatory yogurt to save face was quite enticing. A •sample' is defined in Jennifer's dictionaxy (no, not as member of a band) as \a . Httle bit of yogurt in a scrunched up piece of paper\ (and if its from Freshens, it comes with a littile spoon- hello, no need.) Although the purpose of the sample is to allow customers to try a flavor whose taste is questionable, in hopes that the samplers wiU enjoy the taste and purchase a yone, the frozen yogurt expert knows how to take advantage of the system and receive. what is called, 'the bontJS sample.' As one 'sample expert• stated, \There's usually only three flavors and I Jmow what the flavors taste like, I just want more.\ As if we don't know what vanilla tastes like? Many people don\t realize that there is sampling etiquette- that is, there is a way to ask to sample 'generic flavors' without angering the owner. First, scrunch up your eyes, when asking for the flavor, as if reading the name of the flavor is a strain. Secondly, ask for the flavor using its official name. For instance, asking for 'chocolate' is a deatll wish, the owner will be tempted to shove the sample in your face; but, asking for \dutch chocolate .. or \bavar chocolate\ is excusable. Thirdly. and most importantly, use intonations. The ol' question mark at the end is quite effective in suggesting confusion. Fourthly, (if you are with a friend) while you taste the sample (of generic chocolate), look at your friend with the \I think I like it, you want to try?\ eyes. Fifth. in between tastes, scrunch up your eyes and look back at the name of the flavor. And sixth. if you're anticipating that 'second bonus sample' of, say, vanilla (ooh, daring) this time. sllake your head in disappointment and frustration as y0u throw away the sample paper,:(as ifnofuing is more aggravating tllan a flavor that doesn't taste exactly like Ben and Jerry\s ice cream) This prepares the employee for an upcoming second sample. Although some may label the act of numenms sampling as an act of deceit. placing the owner as the victim·; many yogurt lovers would agree that the customers may, in fact, be the victims. Victims deceived by the many names of ,flavors (ie. 'alpine strawberry'. What does alpine have to db with strawberry?), Allow me to use a scenario to pmve my point. You innocently walk i11to a yogurt store and see ,tliree flavors. Vanilla. Coffee, and Irish Cream. As you milnlel at the· unique flavors .!lnd purchase a pint of eaciL, Little do you know that your •Irish Cream • is merely a swirl of vanilla and coffee. {Pretty sneaky, mister), The pourer will even go to much effo:tt to distract you or stand in front·of the machine wliile quickly pouring the twc flavors into one cup, thus, forming 'Irish cream •. You are later faced with ridicule a:s you proudly announce a new flavor to your friends. It's the old \Reeses\ candy bar phenomenon~ where a company takes two pro!IIJcts (peanut butter aJtd chocolate), mushes them together .and sells the product for millionK As stated in Bachelor Party (staning Tom Hallks) it's like a \'jam sandwich'. You take two pieces of bread and you jam them together. Get it? 'Jam sandwich\' ... Now, who\ s the victim? Market sales for Frozen Yogurt are increase llt an average annual rate of 12-15%, and as the representative for Dannon Yogurt ~tated, \'sales are increasing year after year. The frozen yogwt trend is big business.\ Froz.en Y:ogurt seems to be a definite trend in the United States. Interestingly Cont. on page 87 Having a Good Time Sober MicheUe Rosenbaum Features writer This is a story many Union students may relate to. It is not a true story, so the names are made up. Hopefully this will get a point across to the Union campus. Friday night was a beautiful night. It was warm out and the sky was clear. Caryn did not feel too well, yet she wanted to go out since it was the last weekend to go out before finals. She was really stressed about her classes, and she just got into an argument with her sister who is supposedly her \best friend.\ Her friends knew she couldn't stay in and be depressed, so they encouraged her to join them. First, the five girls tried to decide where to go. There were five big parties going on that night. They finally decided they would begin up campus and work their way down to the donn. They knew it would be a late night. They were all stressed out from a hard week so they planned ahead and bought their own alcohol. American or Golden Anniversary beer did not appeal to them. The last thing Caryn wan ted to do was drink. She knew that if she drank, her mood would only get worse and more exaggerated. the alcohol would not have helped, but hurt her. She decided to stay sober that night even :though she already paid for the alcohol. Her friends were shocked since Caryn is usually the first one to drink, but she was still determined to enjoy herself without drinking alcohol. They played some drinking games while Steve Miller Band was blaring through the stereo. They slowly cheered up and began dancing. Caryn simply watched them and laughed. Just seeing all of them enjoying themselves lifted her own spirits. She had a ha11dflll of jellybeans to put some s11gar in her system, a11d bega.n to dance. Her troubles eventually were forgotten. They left the donn aro11nd eleven o'clock and went to the ftrst party. Caryn had to hold two of her friends up. It gaye her a feeling of control. Slie was the helpful o.ne and slle was smiling. At the party, Cilryn for tile first time, did not run towards the bar. She just walked around and found so many people to talk to. She talked and knew what she was saying. Surprising to her. many ()ther people were sober too, S() she had people to talk to who didn't slur all their words together. At the same time,. she was laughing at everyone else! Half the girls who came t{) the party looking nice, did not look too good anymore. They couldn't even staod strai!lht, The Concordiensis New & Improved Uncle Edna Unde Edna is a Union College student who answers real questions fr001 real people. Tired? SuDf).umed? Mid-tenn weary?

The Concordiensis FEATURES· Helping an Upset Friend Jennifer Unterberg Contributing Writer Here's the scenario: your friend is crying. She is to the point of hysterics. It is obvious she is upset about something. (no, really?), so you ask her what's wrong. \Nothing!\ she screams. \Just leave me alone! I want to be alone!\ A cowboy boot is _ hurled at you, the heel missing your head by a inch.. Whoah, major dilemna. Do you a) ignore her plea and beg her to tell you what is wrong b) tell her you believe her (why would she lie) and immediately leave c) use 'puppet therapy' or d)stand there, dumbfounded, not knowing what to do. If you answered 'd', you are not alone. For many women, there is a fine line ·between being 'pushy' and 'negligent'. Knowing when a friend wants to be left alone is a difficult task; for often times, the upset friend wishes for you stay, but is worried she is being too demanding and hopes that you will respond to her plea with, \Oh don't be riduculous. you are so dear to me that I will stay here forever even if the hottest guy wants me to leave with him right this instant\(O.K I'm pushing it). Aimee Murdock, a Union College student suggests, \you ask her :what's wrong twice. The second time.Jater, dude.\ Granted, the 'Are You O.K' dialogue can get annoying, (\are you O.K? Are you sure your O.K? No, really are you O.K?\) but how is one to know when to stop? Especially tricky is 'The Day After'. For instance, you stayed up all night with your friend, trying to calm her down, assuring her that her life was not over, there are other fish in the sea (\well maybe not at Union,\ Jane, \but Union's merely a pond!\). The following day, you see your red-eyed friend in the College Frozen Yogurt Cont. from page 86 enough, when interviewing employees of Schenectady, one worker commented that eating bagels and frozen yogurt were very stereotypical behavior of a Union student. \It's the pseudo 'healthy trend' of upper/middle class people .. •• Could the frozen yogurt trend be a trend that, in fact, significantly reflects our society? When asking female students why they enjoyed frozen yogurt, all responded with \it tastes good. I like sweet treats.\ When following the frrst question with, \would you still like it if it had as many fat grams as ice cream?\ all but one responded with \no\ \Yogurt is great.\ one female student stated, \you can eat it and not feel guilty about it. If s the best of both worlds, ·it tastes like ice-cream and there's no fat.\ Another student agreed, \It tastes great and it's fat free!\ The Dannon Yogurt representative mentioned that the newest trend is the \sugar- free non-fat\ flavors. A '. Center. Do you ;1) run up to her and ask her if she's O.K, 1isking an angry response of \I was O.K, until you reminded me!\ b)go up to her and act as if the night before never happened, (as if you didn't see her make that 'scary crying face' characterized by a runny nose and drooling mouth), .assuming your friend wiU bring the subject up if she wants to talk about it, or c) make a tnad dash to the ·bookstore, frantically purchase a 'friendship' card, and im¥Dediately send it to her mailbox (\Ted I really don't have time to look up her ~?ox number ... \) Again, besides the traditional sending of a card, one can not predict the appropriate action. · Blame for this confusion can be directed at the rexistence of three types of 'upsets'. For example. one type of upset is the 'PMS' upset. The difficulty of knowing how to respond to a pre-menstrual friend is understandable;.for instance, sometimes a friend will come in the room sobbing, \I don't know why I'm crying, I just am!\ Other times, the friend may start crying during an· At&T Commercial, or over news that her cute second grade History teacher, married the fifth grade math teacher (\he didn't wait for me!\) or even crying after seeing \the cutest baby in the whole world!\ Although it is at times best to wait three or four days before becoming concerned with your friend, the \Oh you're just PMS\ tends to be overused by boyfriends is not always appropriate. We all know that sometimes true feelings come out during those PMS times! Another type of potentially confusing upset is the \Drunk Upset\. The scenario: you are at a 'registered' weekend party. While yot1 are engaged in deep conversation with your date. you are knocked over by a woman, in her 40's, passed by the Dannon machine and asked if the vanilla was 'sugar free nonfat\. I asked the woman why she preferred sugar-free. (Dannon has never been known for coming up with unique names for yogurt flavors; for example 'fruit on the bottom'? That sounds like a name for a character in 'Dances with_ Wolves\) She responded, \because I can't afford to be so fat, I have to lose weight\ (She was not fat. At all). Could tile craze for non-fat frozen yogurt represent more than a 'new taste?' Could the initial 'nice snack' turned into 'nice meal' phenomenon reflect a present craze by women for an ideal body. A craze for 'thinness?' As quoted by one male Union student, \Girls obviously eat yogurt because it's not fattening. Why else woul4 they eat that tasteless 'rotten milk.' Ice-cream tastes better:• Not one female student disagreed with the preference for ice-cream. Another male student exclaimed, \Girl's eat frozen yogurt so they won't gain weight. You're not judged by person running passed you, sobbing and screaming, kicking open the fratenity door and running outside into the pouring rain. Do you a)act as if that maniac i~ not your friend and continue flirting or b) kick off your heels, say \see ya'\ to your date and run after your friend. This is indeed a very tough situation; however, there are two signs which can he used in assessing whether your friend is engaged in \drunken crying.\ One sign is crying over a ridiculous incident; such as a friend crying over a guy she hooked up with once during freshman orientation (the week where everyone hooks up with everyone), and four years later he passes her in the Colege Center without saying 'hi'. Another sign is if she is par.taking in the 'nobody likes me routine', one in which she questions her friends' love, her family's love, and every guy on campus's love for her, shouting, \I'm going to be an old .maid!\ Considering tile odds of your friend remembering anything the next day, you may be tempted to say \shut up\ and throw her in bed; however, truth may be coming out, so it's best to do the 'patting the back-\we love you'\ method. The third type of upset is th.e real thing. It is when your friend has valid reason to be upset, and she is truly sad. A Warning: in this incident, when saying to an upset friend, \I know/' take extreme caution, for we don't always know, do we? Yes, we might know how it feels to fail a test (well, at least I do), or to have your feelings hurt; but if a friend, spring term Senior year, has just discovered, that she has eight more requirements to fulfill in her major, saying \I know, I know\ might get another cowboy boot hurled across the room. Boots do come in pairs! your body, but your personality!\ The student ended his statement with, \well thafs not how it actually is, but that's how it should be.\ Is society to blame for women feeling as if their figure is their most important asset? Chery 1 Bonica, commented, \Frozen Yogurt? Of course its less fat, so it might be a women's issue since women tend to be more concerned with their body. B. ut it is because society imposes restrictions on a women's body. Restrictions that are 11ot placed on men.\ (Cheryl Bonica has been known to turn even frozen yogurt into a women's issue.) Frozen Yogurt is \the best of both worlds\ for many women, for it tastes great and its non fat. Some stated that it is a healthy snack while others stated that it is .a great meal \because it fills me up ami I won't get fat.\ Is this healthy product actually provoking unhealthy eating habits? \I'll eat anything if it's nonfat,\ one student exclaimed. Although. frozen yogurt may be a great tasting product, it should be kept to a 'sweet treat' instead of a product that assures ones May 6, 1993., page B7 Be Naked: Be Free Erin M. 0 'Neil F eatwes Editor Remember hearing about that guy at U.C. Berkley who got kicked out of school because he refused to wear clothes? I don't know if it was a fashi()n statement, a political statement, or what. All I remember is that he got kicked out, and I thi~tk that is ridicul•us. Well, obviously several of my fellow Union studen~s agree with me, as I have noticed an oatbreak of naked males cavorting about campus~ I'm not talking about the ceremonial naked Nott run, we've all seen plenty of those, and fumldy it doesn't excite me that much anymore. No, these brave men have taken naked.lless to another dimension. They do not cover themselves with shame as they scamper across the lawn in .front of the library. 1bese men a11e naled and proud. These men are naked at fraternity parties •. We should all be so 'brave. In a society that is so wrapped up in physical appearance, these men are virtual pioneers in the realm of total self- acceptance. They are proud of their n.al.ed bodies- so proud, they want everyone to see them, to share them. Of course, after a few too many beers, one might grab hold of the wrong appendage in an attempt to shake hands, but hey-· itms a risk they are willing to take. Where better to get naked than at a fraternity party? Clothes can be so restricting. After a few drinks your stomacll becomes bloated, and you are forced to suck in your stomach or burst a button. Not these guys. they can let it all hang out. Nakedness also cuts down on the cost of laundry- no clothes, no laundry. Cigarettes of drunken party-goers do not burn holes into yl()llr clothes, but into your flesh. Fellow nakedteers can compare battle scars. Clothing can also be misleading. A guy may wear a pair of jeans he thinks make his butt look !\DOd, when in actuality it is a !)lubbery mass of flab. A wolllan who meets this man at a party may think, \Hey he's got a nice butt! I think I'll take him home tonight,\ only l<l get there and be knocked u11ccnscious by the wave of fat pouring loose from its restraints. With nakedness there are no such misconceptions. What you see is what you 1\et. Browse around, check out his nakedness from every angle before you make the final decision to bri!lg him home. You just can't lose. Okay, maybe was somewhat surprised when l turned around ~t a Ji)arty last weekend, only to find myself standing face te face with a naked man. It's 11ot something that happens every day, but after that, the party became all the more interesting. Naked men were sta11ding around, engrossed in co11versation as if they were doing nothing unusual at aiL Well that's the way it should be! If they want to be naked- let them. ll's a free country. arnd if you don't like it, you're free to leave. Far be it frolll me to look at this issue one sidedly. Let's suppose that I were to show up to a party nake!l this weekend. I would venture a guess that I would get a bigger reaction than these valia;nt men did. Not because I have a body like Cindy Crawford, but because I am a woman, a:ntd no woman that I know has ever been spotted naked at a party. Doing a naked N&tt run maybe, but hanging out at a party- never. Why is that? Why are women so afraid to show their stuff? This is a. serious moral debate in need of consideration, and like most women r know, I do not have the boalls (literally or figuratively) to be the first to try it out. So, bravo naked men! Bravo! Not only are you nude, but you are beatJtiful. You are our brave leader~ cf tomorrow- future presidents, astronauts, Chippendales dan<:ers, what have you.

One of them was passed out in the middle of the floor, while another one's head was literally in the garbage can. It took about a half an how just to convince her that she would be okay a11d that she had to go home. Finally the five of them walked back to the dorm. Waking up the next morning, Caryn felt like a new person! Unlike her friends who all felt worse tban they had ever felt, she felt great.

The goal of the event was to provide a learning experience for both the children of Schenectady and the Union students. This was in an effort to increase the conununication between Union College and the Schenectady community. Fortunately,. due to the cooperation of numerous Union College and Schenectady volunteers, and the gorgeous weather, the Youth Olympics was an overwhelming success. Over 130 \Iittles\ from Big Brothers/Big Sisters and the Reach Out Center arrived at Union for a day of excitement and fun. When they arrived each \little\ was assigned to one of 18 teams. Each team was representing the participating Greek houses and Union's Big Brother's/Big Sisters Club_ All of the \Iittles\ were matched with a Union student who became their big brother/big sister f-or the_ day, and assisted them thro1:1gh all o+ the events, cheering them un and helping them have an enjoyable time. Since it wasn't possible f()r every Union student to be matched with a \little\, those who weren't big brothers/big sisters for the day assisted in cheering the Iittles on, setting up, and running all of the festivities that were planned for the day. The greatest entertainment of the day came during the six competitive events: a potato sack race, a spoon and egg relay, an obstacle course, a suit-up frenzy, a three legged race, and a water balloon toss. The \littles\ had a great time participating in these games with the Union students, a11d also enjoyed other activities that were planned for the day. When the \Iittles\ were on breaks between the six events they were treated to face painting, tie-dyeing, and a li'Ve band. In addition, there was a barbecue for lunch, with \~ '*-t.W t:;- <»: *>/J,_.~ .\;\~·~ ' ! salads, hot-dogs, hamburgers. soda and other foods donated by the Greek houses. The \Iittles\ did not leave the day with just memories, as each one was also given a T-shirt and ribbons that were awarded for their accomplishments in each of the six events_ Tbis day was possible only The Vandal Scandal Vandalism Rises During Spring Term by Heather Manley Concordiensis Staff Last week, Fted Alford, Dean of Students; and Paul Mantica, Director of Campus Safety, met with key student affiliations to discuss the problem of vandalism on the Union College campus. This meeting was in an effort to start to seek approaches for change. This year's estimated cost of vandalism, according to Mantica, is approximately $18,000, an increase from previous years. The administration is looking for ways to decrease the damage caused and the costs inflicted. Opinions vary as to the sources of the vandali~m. Mantica explained that some believe it is generated on campus while others think it comes in from the community_ Based upon Mantica's six. years of experience at Union. he believes it is mostly campvs-related. Non-campus incidents create a different pattern. In these cases, the crime is a theft. such as broken int@ a car or stolen stereo. On- campus incidents, which are much more prevalent, occur in conjunction with events on campus, such as parties. Mantica explained that acts of vandalism have established a pattern of peaks and valleys. -, The record of campus - vandalism shows the number ;: of incidents during vacation ~ periods are much smaller than -~ those occurring when school is ::1!l in session. September sees an £ increase in vandalism, as well E! as April and May, which, Q f according to Mantica, are \atrocious\ every year. Sometimes the vandalism is associated with mid-terms and finals week. \The pressure of exams stands out as a time of vandalism,\ explains Mantica, as he notes oro ken windows and doors reflect _the stress of this time. Compared to the number of incidents that occur, the nurnber of people caught is negligible, Mantica said. The cont. on pg. 3 with the support of numerous people and organizations.

The course is called, The History of Gardens and lan£iscape Architecture and its goal is to plant a beautiful floral arrangement in front of the library in time for graduation. About a year and a half ago, Profes&or Louisa Matthew took notice of the unattractive marigOlds, which were usually planted outside of the library. This unappealing sight ·triggered the idea for her gardening and landscaping class. \The library is a perfect arrangement of parterres,\ Professor Matthew e~plains. A parterre is a garden bed, low to the ground with a simple geometric shape, planted with co11trasting colors. It is not only the most formally planted garden; but unique because it is · closest to a building and can be see11 fr()m above. The first few weeks of · Matthew's course provided the class with a background in ·different gardens and • lat1dscapes. Landscapes include · architecture structures in gardens, such as casinos or villas. The class began its historical sweep with versions in Islamic gardens and then switched to Western traditions, covering both classic and medieval periods. Studies in 15th -18th century gardens and landscapes, with concentrates in Italy, Frauce and England, followed. After the class dipped its feet in the history of gardens and landscapes, Professor Matthew divided the class into four groups, in preparation for the final project, involving the four garden beds in front of the library. Each group was · assigned to present two to three garden architecture proposals. The class discussed all of .the proposals and selected one from each group. . Presently, the students are designing scale drawings as a guide to their future planting. Professor Matthew reveals that \there is one tricky part\ to the grand plan. It is difficult to project a successful growth in the garden beds. On the whole, parterres involve designs with complected geometric figures, such as stars~ braids, and knots. These types are not only extremely expensive, but they take a year to grow. As a result, Professor Matthew ch<>se a simpler and more practical approach. She selected anm.ials, which are - cont. on pg. 3

May 13, 1993, page A2 Modern Dance at Union by Michelle Rosenbaum Concordiensis Staff The Modern Dance Ensemble, is the only dance club at Union College. At the present time there are only seven students in the ensemble. They are hoping to promote the club and recruit many new members for next year. The group meets once a week for an hour and a half under the direction of choreographer Ellen Stinopoli. In addition to directing the ensemble she teaches Modern Dance at her own studio and teaches two Modern Dance classes at Union. These classes are offered in an effort to teach dance students technique. Modern dance can be performed using various different styles of music. This style of dance developed in the early 20th century, as a protest against classical ballet. The aim of modern dancers is to communicate with the audience rather than simply entertain. It is more of an art form than a dance. 'T'he dancers usually do not .. --ar shoes and no specific dress is necessary. Included in modern dance are interesting steps such as the \drop swing\ and falls. The dancers \feel\ the mwsic as they dance to it. Unlike ballet or jazz, rnodern dancers tend not to dance wifh the beat of the music. This year the ensem'ble performed on Parents' Weekend. In addition, they are performing this Friday ,j n the Performing Arts Department at 4:30 P.M. as part <Jf the Steinmetz Symposium. T'hey have been preparing a six minute piece since March. Music will be provided by a composer who has milde a piece especially for the routine. The program will be called \At Intervals,\ through watching the preformance the reasc:ming behind the title will \become clear. The eHsemble hopes to expand in the coming years. Next year they are plan;ni ng to have at least two perforrn!lnces. They also plan to attend t()ther modern dance performatJces to increase their knowledge of the dance. Members are constantly practicing and attempting to further edoc;ate themselves in an effurt t() become a superior c:lub. Anyone interested in any kind of dance is strongly recommended to join the dub. Modern dance heightens the viewers' and perfonaers' awareness of artistic experience.

The day was a tremendous success and benefited all who participated. The \Iittles\ had an enjoyable and memorable time as they experienced the Union students' contribution to the Schenectady community. The day not only provided fun and excitement for the Union students, but it was also a learning experience as they interacted with the \Iittles\ and learned more about the community. The friendships which arose between the youth of Schenectady and Union students served to increase the communication between Union col:lege and the Schenectady community.

Union's 200th Quickly Approaches Plans Already Being Made by Michelle Rosenbaum Concordiensis Writer September 1994 will not be a typical beginning of a typical year at Union. There will still be the new first year· students eager to begin classes and old Seniors eagerly awaiting graduation. However, the sky will not simply be blue, but filled with colors from the fireworks to celebrate Uni'on's bicentennial year. This will be a year of celebration and our campus will be bigger than ever before. Founders Day, February 25, 1994, will be the \kick off' of the bicentennial celebration at Union College. The Bic::entennial Committee is beginning to plan many festivities for the bicentennial year. The committee is a group of faculty, administration and eighteen students. Kristen Reidt and Trisha Nelson are the 1995 class representatives and will coordinate the student effort . Two major events the students will organize for the Bicentennial wil1 be Founders Day and Student Prize Day. The Founders Day celebration will be on a Friday evening . Following dinner there wiU be a ceremony and Gala celebration at night. Reidt and Nelson will plan these events with the help of sixteen other students, whom have yet to be chosen. Student Prize Day will consist of a whole day of interesting games. They will incorporate games of the past with games of the present to iurther . celebrate Union'~. founding 200 years ago. The whole campus will be encouraged to get involved in the day's activities. There will be a carnival with. events which place emphasis on different kinds of skills and the events will be organized by class years in order to bring each class together. Others on the committee are planning many exciting events beginning in September 1994. G:1e of these events is an Intellectual Symposium. The committee is currently in the process of inviting speakers to Union from all over the United States and the world. These speakers will tend to focus their lectures on education and the business world. A time capsule has also been discussed. There wiiJ be an art contest to design a symbol for the capsule and the committee is hoping that participants will place in the capsule items which symbolize the essence of Union. Another event Is the National Conference of Undergraduate Research (NCUR). Many ,undergraduate students will come to Union from colleges across the United States to present their undergraduate research. It will be similar to the Steinmetz Symposium, however, it wiU not simply consist of Union students. Planned for June I 995 is Union's yearly commencement exercises. Since this is far off in the future, the plans are indefinite. The committee hopes to have many \big name speakers\ to deliver invigorating speeches on that day. . · Tlie'se are simply a few .off the ideas for the bicentennial celebration. The campaig11 delivered a budget and proposedl it to President Hull. However~ because it was too high, he cut the budget in half. Needing: funds, the committee hopes· t()l receive many donations from various companies and. television stations. Alumni support will also be a big pait of the bicentennial budget. \The Alumni are S() enthusiastic about helpinE Union for this ·celebration, They really show their appreciation of our college:' states Reidt. Nelson states that \It is incredible to hear old traditions and connections the professors on the committee have. I am so excited about the future events and by being involved in the Bicentennial committee. I am learning so much about Union.\ The committee hopes to get many people involved and is planning for a great bicentennial year. Poetry '1\_eadlft9 & s i9ni\9 ea-ea-ea.. Jordan.

The Concordiensis NEWS May 13, 1993, page A3 Professor of the Week: Michael Frohli:ch by Caroline Paine News Editor Education has almost always been a highly treasured tool in soc~ty. People are encouraged to try and experience new things in the name of learning. Pr<>fessor Frohlich fuas dedicated his life to this cause. He emphasizes that students shou.Jd not be afraid to try a variety of courses of stBdies in their education. He claims that,. \Discouragement is something you brin.g on to yourself,\ and encourages students to really learn during their time at college. Frohlich grew up in Ann Arbor Michigan and proceeded to go the Michigan State University to receive his b.achelors degree. After this he attended Harvard to obtain his masters degree in botany. Presently he is an associate pmfessor at , Union College ·Vandalism cont. from pg. 1 plants that come up for one -season and then die. Funded by the Internal Education Fund, Professor Matthew purchased decorative foliage plants from the famous White Flower Farm in Connecticut. The flower designs are based on contrasting colors, so dark red and a mottled green were chosen. The spaces will be filled with mulch, which helps to keep the weeds down. Planting will take place all day on Saturday, May 15. The Grounds Department have been quite helpful in the workings of this project. Professor Matthew made special mention of Section Head of Grounds, Tom Heisinger, as well as Grounds Operator, Connie Schmitz, who even came to the student Gardening cont. from pg. 1 forward because of peer pressure. \The atmosphere doesn't encourage people to come forward,\ explained Mantic-a. However, some violators have been caught. When trends have been noticed, the school employs extra security. This has been successful in preventing vari<>us incidents of vandalism. Mantica is perplexed by this aspect of his j,ob. He understands the students' desire for protection. Yet, he believes \Vandalism is directed at programs that are there for the students' protection.\ Acts of vandalism where he has taught for the past 15 years. Plants have almost always been Frohlich's passion. He became a botanist because he loves working with \beautiful things.\ No matter how you look at ~hem, wether it be as a whole or under a rnicroscope you· always see something beautifuif,\ the professor said of plants. When questioned as to why he chose to teach instead of a straight research position, where he could work solely with plants, Frohlich smiled and replied, \I always liked talking. It is an occapational 'disease' of faculty.\ Although Frohlich gives much of his time to his students, often staying late hours after classes to help them, he still finds time for research. He believes that, \It is important to stay stimulated or the mind because docile. I do this through research.\ In 1989 Frohlich received a grant Problems presentations of garden designs. Because the Grounds Department wiiJ be busy grooming the rest of the Union campus over the summer, Professor Matthew will be in charge of watering the garden during thi·s season. While this year's class is serving as an eX:periment, (assuming all .goes well), Professor Matthew hopes to teach thls course every other year. Thus far, the class has been a positive experience. Senior student, Aimee Murdock expresses that \we [the class] are getting the opportunity to plant and landscape gardens in front of the library for graduation for the first time. It is a great way to apply classroom knowledge to the outside and realize how much goes into this.\ at Union witnesses tend not to come take their toll on street lights, fire alarms, doors and windows, which place the students in jeopardy. Mantica believes that ultimately the answer is with the students themselves. He reasons that Union College is a student's home for four years and you wouldn't do these things to your own home. Mantica asks the student body to do some soul-searching and ask yourself, \Is this what we really want?\ Hopefully a solution can be reached as \safety should concentrate efforts on protecting students from others, not· protecting them from themselves.\ ***Reminder:*** Friday-FIRE_WORKS! aturday-CARNIVAL! *Don't Miss Out!!!** from the National Science Fouudation 's I\Hd-career.

After Graduating in Russia by Vladimir A verbakll and Benjamin Meyra1 Contributing Writers This summer will be a tough time for a lot of Russian students, disregarding their relatively young Gge. majors and political situation in the country. As an averilge American bachelor predicts !!he possibilities of llis employment, a student in Russia may quickly find Gut about the uselessness of his/l:ler major. Let us remind y-ou that the Russian system of education is very different from the American system. Russiian students are supposed to stlldy for five years, entering schcool at the age of 17 and choosing their majors at the time of application. Of course Russian students never faced the question of payment for education. On the contrary, the Russian goverment pays foJl their education and in addidon provides them with a stipend equal to the minimum salary ill the country. Although you call Golan Heights until Syria c.grees to peace, while Syria refuses to discuss peace until Israel is fully withdrawn from the Golan. · Inside Israel's own political system there is unrest. The Rabin Labor government and the Likud party led by President Netanyahu. Netanyahu says he intends on not do a lot with this sum, you are still able to live on it and go on studying. After bacheloreate exams seniors. received a diploma and were required to take part in a mandatory \distribution\ program. 'J:'his term made sense in old times, when \distribution\ was considered a kind of social service. According to this program, a bachelor was to work for three years in a specified state agency and by doing so, he would be\ paying back \ his stipend and education to the country, (By the way, it is very similar to what Clinton's administration proposes today). This summer, a university diploma will probably be unnecessary in job seeking. A few years ago graduation was called a \ door into the bright future \ but it is now more similar to a door opening up to a state employment agency. In 1990 the fear of unemployment affected only 9% of all seniors. In 1991 the percentage doubled. Today half of students (sometimes up to 90% in other universities) are sure about the lack of any hope to find a position appropriate to their majors. Even in forms to be filled out in employment agencies there is no section about college degree or course of study. Instead of this, there is a question about the last position y()u held, and if you have spent five years in university . , . Well SORRY, there is no need for people like you. Last year students could still' think about changing their major, ff their original specialty was not in a great demand on the trade market.

The trade unions basically gave up finding available positions for .. bachelors with engineering diplomas partly because of the excess of new engineers and partly due to the cutbacks of businesses. A couple of years ago, interest in the sciences shifted to the humanities. Happy boys and girls were applying to economics, law, psycology departments, overcoming huge competition and were absolutely sure that their knowledge would always be in demand. But now it is known that economics majors for instance, will most likely become unemployed . The majority of companies prefer not to hire immature and inexperienced bachelors, but rather former emloyees of the . State Department of Planning who understand the complexities in business. Then what kind of help· do seniors get from their schools? A lot of deans tend not to take care of graduating students and imagine that everything works by itself. Once 60 big companies were asked if they needed schoo I alumni and the reply was negative in almost 40 cases. However school presidents claimed that they could always find positions ·by making contracts with those 40 companies. Nonsense'? Absolutely not. It is a normal situation all over Russia.

Jodie Adams UNION STUDENTS AND DYS- FUNCTIONAL RELA'TIONSHIPS Why do so many Union students complain about their· inability to find intimate social companionship during , their co'llege years? Students have few problems in finding other individuals that intrigue them, however, it is not uncommon for students to engage in much non- superficial discussion. In other words, although the everyday social opportunities exist, the potential for developing deep-rooted relationships is rare. Part of the cause of the perceived problem may be the lack of diversity that many students have encountered·· prior to enrolling at Union. This problem is only com- pounded by the fact that students who attend Union are from fairly similar racial, ethnic, and socio-economic classes. In this case, students who are unwilling to engage themselves socially and intellectuaJiy will probably feel no need to engage their peers. If a student's curiosity can be peaked solely through self evaluations, then they are unlikely to pursue deep intellectual relationships with other ind.ividuals. In short, they will be too self-centered to sustain such a relationship. Many of the dysfunctional relationships that exist at Union occur because many students tend to be self- centered and are unwilling to learn about the needs of other people, particularly people of the opposite sex. Although experimentation and personal social growth are encouraged during the college years, students should not become so wrapped up in their immediate physical and emotional needs that they aliCJw for little positive communication with their friends. Although immediate gratification may be hard to pass lip, the consequences. may be much more far-reaching than people realize.

It was not our intention for Concordiensis to print he letter as news. Clearly the letter should have been printed under a different head- ing, perhaps opinion. We would like to ad- dress other housing related is- sues as well, privately owned fraternity houses whose 99 year land leases expire by the end of the decade and the possible real long term secret agenda of Dean, now Vice President Mamolla. Unless the privately owned fraternity houses fight now to renew their leases, the college for sure will pick them off one at a time and either deny their renewal or substantially change the terms of their leases. Why? Because the privately owned houses are one of the very few areas. of campus life Mamolla can't control; and the college, through Mamolla have come to contra) just about ev- erything else. Wake up, Sig Phi, Alpha Delta Phi, and the rest. Fight now with your alumni be- fore it's too late. Is it possible that . Mamolla real1y wants ALL stu- dents to live ()ll campus without exception? We have heard from reliable sources (staff and temured professors) that the long term goal is to build another dorm and force ALL students to live on campus all four years. Mo1e control, not to mention that it's always more expensive to live on campus. Since we believe that the above is true, then the col- lege should announce this as a long term goal. But, until the college builds another donn, the overcrowding should not be al- lowed. There are do:rm rooms which were built as doubles being used as triples. Bedrooms have been built in places that were mean to be l(;)unges (I ounges are necessary for a variety of social reas<'lns ). Finally, our basic point is this. If Union's students want \freedom of choice\ in their housing selection, as opposed to a more limited choice by those who think they know what's best for you (want to control you), then you ought to wake up and do somethfng. We suggest you express yourselves to your elected student representatives or letters to the editor.

The· Conoordiensis LETTERS Former Student Recounts Term Abroad Changed His The following letter was written to Professor Bill Thomas, Director of the Terms . Abroad Office, by Dean Kawi, Class of ·1982. Dean writes about his Term Abroad experience, and how it has . changed his life. February 1993 .Pear Bill. _ _ Thanks for your letter. I will be meeting with Sheila o:Donnell tomorrow. She's already warned me that her finn is not hiring but she~s bound to have interesting advice since she's \in the loop.\ She ·also said that she could arrange a meeting with a couple of of her friends who are also lawyers, I will I et you know what happens. Now, to answer yoqr questio.n,. ~ should start at the beginning. When I arrived in Bath, there was a sign-up . festival during the first week of · classes where the students could learn about and join · student organizations. I . remember, there was the Bath . U. Polo Club, the Bath U. · King Charles Springer Spaniel .·Club, the Bath U. Ascot Club, · and then there was the Bath University Rugby Team for · those ill-bred students who . arrived at school without their . horses, dogs, and ascots. (You • might add those things to your \What You'll Need In Bath\ . list). Needless to say, I ~as as · ill-prepared as any Union • College Term Abroad student would have been, so I had to join the tugby team. After finishing the first game of the season with a broken nose I put my Chi Psi beer-drinking experience to work and made some new friends in the post- game pub crawl. The following summer, one of those friends came to New . York and stayed with me and my family, which was the first . of ~any visits each way. After Happy About Speaker for Commence- ment, Gary Wills Subject: Letter to the Editor I respectfully submit the following \Letter to the Editor\ with the belief that it should be of interest to all your readers, and of particular interest to graduating seniors and their families. COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER GARY WILLS I am highly pleased to learn this year's commencement speaker will be Garry Wills, g~aduating from Union and working in New York liegotiating contracts to ship oil I got an MBA. By this time, my English friend. had a w:i fe and a new son and he a.csked me :to be the boy's Godfather. At the Christening, I met the Managing Director ()f an old British. engineering c-ompany famous for making motorcycles. The larger part of their busine$s now comes from building high.power, ultra- light-weight aircraft engines for military applications,. although they still build motorcycles. At the time, there were problems in the marketing d-epartment and the MD hit u p.on the idea of planting me there ostensibly to help but to actually figure out what was wrong and to help fix it. Within a few months of my arrival, two managers who sl1ould not have been there were gone. I was offered one of the positions but decided to begin law school instead. After my first year of law scilool, I took a study abroad pmgram in Arcachon (on the sea near Bordeaux. The weather was better than Bath's but there was no rugby). We studied E:EC law, comparative criminal pmcedure (which was the most iateresting: German versus American rules on cross e:x.amination, · police iaterrogation of suspects, . treatment .of defendants,etc.) aDd comparative corporation law. My summer after Arcachon was unplanned which became a problem as the pmgram came to a close at the end of J tme. There had been mlk: of internships in Paris for ''~n terested students\ but nothing had been organized. I pltessed the professor-director of tile program to call Paris which he finally did from one of those (llot) glass phone booths near tile beach. He got a former student on the phon~, a young Firench advocate, and handed the wh() followed critically acclaimed earlier works such as ''[n venting America\ a biography and revisionist account of Thomas Jefferson ancl the Declaration of Independence, with this year's P~.:rlitzer Prize winning \Lincoln at Gettysburg. 11 While many syndicated newspaper columnists gain readership by appealing to C()nservatives or liberals, Mr Wills offers moderate opinions alld insights, and criticism of the extremes. Mr Wills often uses the tecllnique of asking his readers to imagine themselves in the otller persons situation, time or place as a prerequisite for Ullderstanding feelings, options and actions. This technique is well illustrated by Mr Wills' cO<lllmn of this week, in which he considers today's situation in the former Soviet Union in terms of the radically new life and choices of the people and p()Htical leaders. Mr Wills also graciously and effectively shares his skills, as I learned from his participation in a \Symposium on the Craft of Nonfiction 11 • This was a phone toe. I practically lived in that phone booth, relentlessly calling her and another of the professor's contacts in a large, corporate law firm in London which he had scribbled on a scrap of paper for me before he Ieft Arcachon. I actually stayed in Arcachon several days after the program ended, not yet having anywhere •else to go. You can imagine how many telecartes I used! Magically, on the same day, I was offered both positions. I left for Paris shortly afterward and went from working in Paris on a Friday to working in London the fo11owing Monday. On top of all this, the best friend of my English friend's wife happened to be leaving London for several weeks the day after I arrived so, after meeting for dinner in London and getting caught up, she left me the keys to her house. After London, I worked in Germany for two weeks in a company belonging to a friend's father and returned to law school. The following summer, I worked for the same French firm and also worked for a private detective in England wllom I befriended during my odyssey at the London firm. (He had been hired by the firm to find someone and I was sent to meet him). I al~o took a vacation in Greece with my then-girlfriend, an advocate in the firm,. and visited my · German friends again before returning for third year. After law school, I carne to France to work at the Assemblee Nationale (thanks to a friend in the French firm) which is where I am now. If there is one thing to be gleaned from all of this it is: the less a student knows about what he wants to do, the more times he should be picking up the phone and calling people, getting information, making friends and taking risks. Sending out cover letters with major literary event two years ago that was organized by Albany's renowned writer William Kennedy. Union has been honored and enlightened during the last two commencements with Children's Defense Fund founder Marian Wright Edelman and Presidential Candidate Paul Tsongas. Garry Wills is an excellent choice to continue this fine tradition. Sincerely, Professor Frank Wicks Mechanical Engineering Liberal: Do you Really Think So? To the editor: This letter is written regarding an opinio.n submitted to the editor by Andrew C. Siegel last week. I fell that in fairness I must clarify some things for Mr. Siegel, as it seems that he has a very blurred view of Schenectady's resumes only woks if you pick up the phone and call too. If there is one thing that I would have done differently in college it is that I would have spent more time abroad. I learned more about how the world works and about how people think in that one semester abroad than I did during the rest o.f college. That's really what college is supposed to teach but doesn't anymore. When else in life but on a term abroad do your get the chance to stay abroad for months at a time, to irmnerse yourself in another ·culture, to escape the narrow-mindedness of the micro-environments that we grow up in all for what your life would cost during that time anyway? I remember friends in college who were too indecisive to fill out a term abroad application or who put it off and before they knew it they were graduating. It's unbelievable that someone could miss an opportunity like that. Some people would rather just stay in Schenectady. I · won't even comment un that. Some people worry about running out of time to fulfill requirements for their major. My answer to that is Teresa Sibeni, the six-year med student who spent a year in Central America and still completed the program on time. Every rule gets broken · sodtier· or later b)' the ·person who was clever enough to call the right person and say the right thing. So you see, if you hadn't sent me on that first term abroad I am certain I would not be where I am today. It's not the \contacts\ that I made. (Who would have known? At that time we just wanted to play rugby and drink beer!) It's the experience which deepens as time passes. At Christmas immediately after the term abroad I would have said that it had been great fun. Now, after situation. When I read that most of Andrew's friends view him as a \Liberal\, I had to wonder from what perspective these friends made their generalization. Those friends could very well have been members of the conservative group from which Union College draws it's reputation. If I am wrong, I am very sorry for the harsh accusation. If I am correct, I believe that you all should rethink how you evaluate your feelings about the \fine\' city of Schenectady and it's people. I would like to make it clear to everyone reading this article that I am a Schenectadian, or as Andrew called it, a \doid;' I was born and raised in Schenectady; I am happy to be able to receive my higher education at Union College in Schenectady. I know, as do most permanent residents of this city, that Schenectady has been in a recession ever since General Electric began cutting back. In short, local jobs have not been bountiful for the past several years. Now lets consider the 10-12 Afro- American youths that Andrew May 13, 1993, page A 7 How Life years of reflection, of making sense of something someone said or did in England, of reading articles in the newspapers about Britain with closer scrutiny (mostly because I had been there), of travelling to former British colonies ami seeing parallels and differences, I am realizing the importance of studying abroad. That term in England gave me the first large piece in the puzzle of how the world works and how people think in a more profound way than a student ordinarily gets from a \liberal arts\ education. I know it's · impossible to explain to a 20- year old that there are definitely. unforeseeable, intangible. long- term benefits to be gained fmm a term abroad. benefits that outweigh the seemingly insurmountable problems of \How can Buffalo win without me watching?\ and \Who will take care of my dog?\ and \When will I tind time to write the application essay?\ and \Where will I find clothes for Madrid?\ and \I know it's the last day to apply, but how can I?\ It's snowing and Humanities is soooo far!\ and · etc. Perhaps selling terms frivolous indulgences. That should be easy- anyplace will seem like a frivolous indulgence compared with Schenectady! With best regards. Yours sincerely, Dean Kawi P.S. Suggested answere to the . questions in the last paragraph: Don't worry- they broadcast the Superbowl everywhere; Your parents will feed the dog, even if they swear they won't; Have your boyfriend write your essay; You don't need clothes in Madrid; If you make friends with Bill Thomas, you may never have to walk to Humanities in the snow again . is complaining about. I feel safe to assume that since they were all about sixteen, and they all rode bicycles, they probably do not own their own automobiles, which would allow greater choices of employment. If it was not apparent to Andrew, I will clarify that there are only four fast food restaurants. I ike Arby's, in downtown Schenectady. These children may not have been fortunate enough to get that job at \Arby's\ that would have facilitated the purchase of an over priced bike. To all you students who agree that we should fence out the Schenectady community, I would like you to make the following considerations: First, understand that most people in this area are not as fortunate as we are. The education we receive at Union makes us elite. Our less fortunate peers have no l:hoil:e but to deal with that. Every person deals with problems differently, and I am truly sorry that Andrew got his cloths wet and his feelings hurt. May it never happen

May 13, 1993, page AS again! Second, please understand that these situations are not fully representative of the Schenectady community. I know many fantastic people in Schenectady. If you ask an one of my \pure\ Union friends, they wiH surely attest to sincere quality of many Schenectady folk which they have encountered. To ,\keep them off,\ as Mr. Siegel suggests, is a narrow minded, isolationist view that can easi•ly suffocate the purpose .of higher education. Lastly, I beg you to take the time to consider the situations of the Schenectadians around you. A major part of the undergraduate experience at Union includes learning to live with different types of people. Please do not stif'le that experience by resenting the city and people 0f Schenectady. Remember that Schenectady was here first! Respectfully, Eric D. Johnson '93 GoodBye and Good Luck from Ms. Marlin To the Editor: After four years and nine months at Union College, I am leaving for another position in the area. In my tenure at Union College I have met some really super students. I have seen people who never though they would be able to afford Union comt.:: here due to the financial assistance offered by the College. This has included students from typical middle class families, single parent students who have transferred into Union as well as students from economically disadvant- aged backgrounds who are the first in their families to attend a college. There have been students whom I have very much enjoyed working with and will miss. To these students I would like to say good bye and good luck! Caryn Kaplan Marlin Associate Director of Financial Aid Incompetence Discovered at Concordiensis I am writing because I abhor mediocrity. The Concordiensis is at best mediocre. I, along with many other students and faculty feel that a highly selective institution like Union College deserves better then what Concordiensis has to offer. Therefore, when Concordiensis came to the Student Forum meeting to appeal to the student body for better equipment, I found it in my heart to vote in favor of their request. I have recently come to realize that new computers does not necessarily equate to a good paper. Twice I have not been published in Concordiensis. Both times I handed my disk to a staff member explaining what was on the disk we1l before the deadline, and both times my writing llas been ignored without all·explanation. 'fllis week I was appalled to find out that according to the front page of the · Con cordiensis I had apparently won Vice President of Finance when I actually lost. Wasn't ·it bad enough to lose? In addition on page 3 there was an article titled \Administration Addresses Vali-Dine System.\ This is all issue as Ms. Manley mentioned is of major concern to me, therefoFe I would like to clear up some of her comments. Freshmen a.nd Upperclassmen are required to have a $200 declining balance in addition to the Freshmen 15 and the minimum 7 for students in . campus owned housing (excludi11g those students living ,j,n fraternities or sororities with their own meal plans). Those students who will be eating at Dutch Hollow or Upperclass Dining (Upperclass will be on a cash basis next year) will have a little mme then $6 to spend rather thlen the $5.35 we have this year_ Finally one will only be spending over $8 a meal if on the 7 meal plan. The other options are much better values. Througb()ut just this article alone I could continue by pointing out multiple grammatic:al errors as wdl, but I think I've said enough. The computers will come as promised,. but I would like to see an improvement in editing so mistakes like these will not happen .in the future. I would suggest that next time you approacb. the Forum for money make sure that either your quality has improved or I'm not there. Seth Brown As we haw maintained in the past, the Concoulie~TSis is a reflection of the studerzt h~dy at Union College. If you believe that the Concordiensis is mediocre, i.t ix because the average student at Unton is apathetic.

Stating t:h(l!t you will not support Concordiens1s: if you are reelected to the Forum ts JJoth unprofessional and ridiculous. To assume that immediate improvements can be made less than one week afte:r receiving computers is childish. M~ybe you are unaware of how difficult improvement is, and maybe you sh11uld read up on your facts before yoz; write an article, or are you a hypar:rite? As a piece of iriformation, the Student Forum did not give Concordiens1s: any money towards buying the c-omputers. They were purchased 'Wtth advertismg revenue.

The event was held at Frank Bailey Field where partkipants walked over four miles to raise $200 for the worthy cause. Delta Upsilon would like to thank all those who contributed to make the event such a success! Response from Schenectady To the editor: I would like to comment on the article written by Andrew C. Siegal last week in the Concordiensis. As a resident of Schenec~y and a Union College student, I run appalled with Mr. Siegal's remarks toward the people of Schenectady. First of all, Schenectady residents are not \doids.\ The use of that term to refer to Schenectady residents only shows that he is indeed a bigot, whiCh he claims not to be, and is also not very liberal. A liberal would not judge an entire community on the basis of how a few residents act. I am not condoning what the youths did, but I also do not understand the hatred of Schenectady which is obvious in the article. Union College does not fmancially support Schenectady, and Schenectady is not a \fair\ city. It is the home of Union College. If any person who attends Union has a problem with Schenectady, let me remind you that you came to Schenectady, Schenectady did not come to you. Let me also remind you that Union College did not become the fine institution that it is by being located in a \fair\ city. Schenectady has been very good to Union CoOege, and Union College has be.en very good to Schenectady. I personally feel that it is a salutary relationship for both the college and the city. Most residents of Schenectady respect !Jnion College students and go out of their way to help them by offering internships, flexible jobs, and making them feel welcome. Of course there are those residents of Schenectady who are jealous and intimidated by Union College students. This happens in every college community and is not only characteristic of Schenectady. This is still not reason enough for those Schenectady residents to what they did to Union College students, but I would expect the educated Union College student to understand the situation and deal with it in a way that did not include name- . calling and labelling of an entire city. If Union College starts closing its gates to Schenectady, it will be closing its minds to society and ignoring the problem rather than trying to solve it. Eric S. Clifford, '94 Watch Your Words To the editor: You would not believe how stupid I felt myself after I had read the article \Caetano Encoutages ... \ in the past issue .. Total confusion! Never, ever I could possibly think that I was \exch:1ded from the prominent students\. Why? Jl:lst because I decided to be an independent student and was not \honored\ to belong to \other than white... and males\. According to it, I won't be able to ''bring up the school moral\ also. What a pity for me! Ok, enough about it, but look what Caetano says about the Student Forum to be taken more seriously: \We just have to take the initiative.\ This is so simple. Of course, right here in the corner, there is the Initiative Teller Machine, just do not forget put your President Card in, type the PIN, and then ... We observe the happy Student Forum President going back to her office with a sack full of the initiative. Meanwhile I did not recognize that I was getting a huge unexpected benefit based on the statement of Caetano about the Greek System that \everyone benefits from it\. Really? Even me? From a whole bunch of pledges annoying me with the phone calls in the morning time and pretending to be my old friends? Or, possibly, from drunk guys floating around and screaming how well they got cliunk'? However the best part was the following. After Caetano had talked a lot about diverse campus, the initiative, the Mentor Program and the possibility of c;oming together in the spirit of Union, she said :\We CANNOT change the world, but by working with the system our goals can be accomplished.\ Where did you get this from, Mia? Either we CAN change the world (but definitely not by \working with \ the emerged from the middle of nowhere unrecognizable \system\), and a lot of things that you have discussed will make sense, or we just have to give up and start looking for more social alternatives. - Sincerely, Vladimir A verbakh The Concordiensis Timing ofFresh- manLottery Questioned Deru- Editor: I would like everyone to know that it was reatl:y idiotic for those who were responsible to hold the General Freshman Lottery on the same night (Wednesday, May 5th) as the speech delivered by Pulitzer Prize-winnig columnist Clarence Page in the College Center Auditorium. Clarence Page is a journalist nationally knqwn for his ip.sightful commentary on various issues, and I was really looking forward to attending his speech. But I col:lld not attend, because I would not risk missing something as important as the Freshman Lottery. Did it not occur to anyone in charge that some freshman students would want to attend Mr. page's speech? I am very glad that I attended the lottery, because me and tny three friends managed to grab the last available suite in Davidson House. But I am also very disappointed that I could no attend Mr. Page's speech. The people in charge should have the wisdom to hold these two very important events on different nights. · Sincerely, Anand Rao, '96 'MAP TESTS In College, Really! To the Editor: I couldn't let my freshman year go by without expressing my discontent with one of my Ge.n Ed courses. I will not mention names but the course had something to do with history of a group of countries to the east of the United States. I was shocked at how the grade was going to be determined: midterm, final, and four map tests. MAP TESTS! I hadn't had a map test since sixth grade. What shocked me even more was the manner in which these map tests were graded. A location had to be physically drawn on a blank map in the exact position the professor deemed correct. Is this a fair method of grading someone's knowledge of history?? I don't think so. What pissed me off even more was that we were given maps of Africa and America. Someone tell this professor that the course is not History of Africa. Where were challenging essays and papers that I expected coming to such a fine academic institution? I don't consider rewriting in an essay what my professor and try to get a good grade, which I feel is very undeserved. I know that I am not the only one who feels this way. I was told at the beginning of my studies at Union that I would be challenged intellectually, socially, physically, economically (just kidding), and religiously. I am still wai1ing for the intellectual challenge in my Gen Ed requirements. Anonymous Freshman

Adam Perlow My name is Adam Perlow and I am running for Senior Cbss representative. Before asking for your vote I will tell yo\l why I feel I am qualified, what I would do as your class representative, and why I would tike this honor. At Union I am a Peer Facilitator, a contributor to the business section of the Conc()rdiensis, a Gate Keeper, an Ambassador, and recently have been selected as a senior intern for the Admissions office. While many students .oonstantly complain about varicrus aspects of Union, I take Htings a step further; ], do something about them. For ,ex.arn:ple,. I feel this campus lacks acceptance of all types of ,peopl'.e, and lacks e,xposure to ,people who can offer them new perspoeot:ives on controversial issues. lfherefore, I became a Peer Facilitator and work hard with !Len other Peer's to develop thoug.ht provoking workshops and n~1ost recently a Series on Diversity responsible for brin!Jjng h!l campus a group of supe~b :speakers coveting such issu~s as race, gender, se:xuaJity, discrimination, and 'Gay-'s in the military. If :something bothers me at Urii<Jn and I am not a member of the g:roup responsible for addressing the area of my ·Concern, I step in anyway. Last term during a Union town meeting with some two hundred odd people, I publicly spoke out against the President for illlpG sing new charges on the students that offered Httle fle>.:ibili:ty. The president HsteJied,· and compromised. Most recently, I assessed all the lfnion food establishments and spoke with many students to develop a comprehensive list of problems, complaints, and desires. I met with the head of Dining Services and changes will be taking place. Already, prices have been lowered on a few items at the Dutch Hollow restaurant which I suggested were a bit inflated. I remind you ali of this I have done on my on volition without belonging to any correlated committee. When I believe in something or have a problem, I act quickly and efficiently. I am never afraid to speak my mind and will stop at nothing until my mission has successfully been completed. I believe in criticizing when necessary and commending when earned; as I recently did when I commended President Hull for balancing Union's budget, a feet other school's dream of accompl,ishing. If I am chosen as the senior class representative I will guarantee the following: A monthly walk through all residences housing seniors to acc!fpt complaints, and suggest ie ns. The develnprnent of a' 11 ew campaign directed at the od hninistration to see about inst,itJJting. some senior pridleges and discounts.

Junior Class Representative Nate Coffin If you are a current Sophomore and have read quite eno11gh creative political rhetoric for one day, relax and allow yourself to absorb the following anecdote. The other day, I was reaping the rewards of spring on West Beach, catching some rays, feeling the grass between my toes, and ducking a few errant frisbees. A group of students well within earshot had struck upo11 a profound conversation concerning their presence at Uni()n. They touched upon a number of current issues facing the college, and openly voiced their opinions regarding them. The topic of discussion eventually shifted to the always scintillating subject of reputations, and more spedfically to how the students would like to be remembered after graduation. While some students yearned to be remembered for qualities such as sexual prowess or beverage capacity, others spoke of lea<lership and a good work ethic. T.liinking about . this discussion led me to recall a certain passage from Life's Little Instruction Book. I'm sure most of you have picked this thing up and flipped through it at least once (it's that little itty-bitty plaid book with the cute sayings). On page 274, it reads: \Leave everything a little better than you found it.\ Indeed, this is a maxim to weigh heavily as each of us proceeds through our years at Union. All who attend this institution have been provided the opportunities to br()aden our horizons, challenge our minds, push our limits, t::md test the waters of life. Accompanying these in v ai uable opportunities is th.e co11siderable responsibility of giving something back, of helping to promote Union and its students. Indeed, we all have the capacity to be remembered as people wh() made a difference. I earnestly want to see Union mllde better, both now and in the long term. I echo the setltiments of the student body in calling for a more academically, socially, and demographically diverse institution. I would like to promote student participation in tile important groups and committees on campus. At the same time, I would like to ensure that student government itself genuinely represents the concerns of the entire student body. Indeed, this college is your college; tllis college is my college, from Jackson's Gard.ens to Fox and Davidson, from the Student Forum t() Administration, this college is mllde for you and me. JtJn.iors, friends, and fellow stude11ts: take a moment on Frid111y to lend me your sup_purt Give me the ()p~ontt~nity to make your voice: heard. Let's work t()gether t() make Union a little: better than when we :r.ouud it. Bri3n Davenp·ort I:lello, my name is Brian Dave:nport: and I'm running for Jun.ior Olass Representative. I'm mo.t going to list all my qu~tll:fications or put forth some transpa:re11tfacade. Instead, I'm goi n~ to make a promise to you, T~gether with the Stlld•ent Forum, I will do evervthing in my power to take this campus back from the admi ni.stration. It has beet:t an ongooing trend of the policy makers here at Union to ignore the v 0i ce of the students. This is DU[f school and our home for fou.ryears. We pay tuition and we p2y the faculty and staff. It is otJr ~responsibility to make our !foi ce heard and to make the adrriinistratlon give us what we wa11L, nCJt what they think is · best for us. The system is a br.-,1 ,Jl .. -;· ... ' .. I~L. 1 ,J:..' •'•. ~'*t --111if_ perfect example of this. It may be a useful, practical system, but the way we are forced to pay an extra $200 a term is outrageous! Because of their inability to raise money, the administration chose to pass the buck on to us. The student body should be more instrumental in the decision- making process. I can offer you fresh ideas, enth11siasm, open-mindedness and loyalty. It's time to get up out of our chairs and decide for ourselves how to live our lives. There is no more time for passive representatives who take the administration's decisions as unquestionable and absolute. Why not elect someone who will challenge the administration when needed and stand up for what we want? Jonathon Miller The time has come again for you to elect your Class Representatives.

Not only am I interested with representing the concerns of my peers, but also those ·Of the entire campus community. The elections should not be a popularity contest. Voting is a blind risk that the campus needs take open their eyes to. In being an active rnernber of the campus community I have been able to get things done at Union. My involvements include the African and Latino Alliance of students, Orientation Committee, Campus Action, Student Assessment Committee, aRd Aids Awareness Weet< Committee. These organizations play major roles in the lives Union students. At the same time it gives me an opportunity to participate in different campus events serving to educate us. I will not spend the remaining part of my college career stating what is wrong with Union. Instead I arn going to help enhance that what Union hast() offer. Vote for Lisandra Ramos. A Vote for Me is a. Vote fo.r You! Joshua Kane My name is Josh Kane and I am running for junior class representative to student forum. My experience as a member of the student forum Committee on Committees has given me a glimpse ofhow this campus is run and I haye realized that I would like to be more involved. I have seen several cases of miscommunication between the administration and the student hody, the most glaring of which (in my opinion) being that the second floor of Fero house has been given to residence life as new office space. This space was originally intended to house offices for student clubs. I think the fact that res. life is now there exemplifies this miscommunication because the administration, if asked, would probably tell you they didn't .ki10w which clubs the students wanted to have in Fero house. Because I would make every effort to in.sure that our class's interests are not misunderstood by the administration, and conversely that the administration's wishes are effectively communicated to the students, I want to serve as class representative. I am eager to give something back to the college community, and I think my skills at communication would serve me well as a class officer. I would appreciate your vote in the upcoming election! ophomore Class Representative Ellee Nisselson For those of you Who don't know me, my name is Ellee Nisselson, and I am running for Sophomore Rep·resentative. I am running because I want to make a difference here at Union College. I am a hardworking, energetic, and dedicated candidate whose goal, if elected, is to in~pire more people to be active in the college community. Union provides a few \social alternatives.\ Amorng these are Chet's, Coffeehouse at Fero, concerts, and speakers. I feel that there should be more dances, comedians, bands, and theme parties. ] want to motivate the campus community to take part in these activities by making people more aware of their options. The different activities that I participate in, which many people on campus have never even heard about, are Delta Psi Delia~ a coed fraternity at Union, and next year I will be living in Ludlow House; a specialty house on campus. I believe that, whether you are Greek or Independent, Unkm should provide various forms of social activities in which all of us want to participate in. There is a lack of interaction and communication between the various student organizations on campus. The MulticuHural dinners, the c u I i n a r y E X p 0 s e, th e Merengue/ Salsa dances, and the diversity workshops are good examples of ways we can increa~e i nteractioli between these groups. We should expand upon these ideas, and encourage more people to become involved. I would love to hear your suggestions of different types of activities that you would like to see at Union. \Should I transfer?\ This is a question that has crossed many of your minds. I know that it has crossed mine. This dissatisfaction with Union is a big problem, and I want to make things better. Union is a lot more fun if you become involved. I attend the student forum meetings and the Chet's meetings so I can gain experience and learn first hand how things operate at Union College. I also attend the \town house\ meetings, cross- talks, and debates beca11se events on campus interest me. My involvement at Union is keeping me from transferring. I am learning how to make Union right for me. I am trying to find my niche and I want to help you find yours. College is supposed to be \the best time of our lives.\ I want to make Union a better place for you. Don't forget to vote on Friday, May 14. You can make a difference. Seth Brown On Friday elections are being held for class representatives to the Student Forum. Currently I am President of the Freshmen Class. I am asking you to reelect me to tlli s position. I have tried to become involved in every aspect of campus life. I am on the Chet' s Committee, Dining Services Committee, Campus Acti()n Committee, President of the Kosher Kitchen, and Ru~by Club, as well as being a Student Ambassador, a Gatekeeper, and an R.A. for next year. My main objective has been to observe the flaws of Union College and fi:x them-. I helped organize a tmvu meeting in order address the problems of cheating at UIJion. I also helped organiz;e a week condemning \eth11ic cleansing\ in Bosnia to keep the campus aware of what goes on outside Union. The current projects that I have taken on is to ~reevaluate the new vali-dine meal program that will be enacted next year and increase communication l:Jetween the student body and the administration. I feel that over tile past year I have learned a lo:t from being on the Forum. I have seen some succes_sful 1hings occur throughout this year. The school-wide dance, the Kid's Olympics and 1he mentor program were all worthwhile ventures. I think Union is headed in the rightdirection. I would like to build on these and other plans to make Union the place we all dreamed it would be. Vote for ex:perience, innovation and dedication - SETH BROWN 1 FOR CLASS OF 1996 REPRESENT- ATIVE. Michael Rand I feel that it is important to understand just what your class representatives dli>. Most think .that they do nothi,ng. however after a year of being on student forum I say differently. Student Forum requires a lot of dedication. Several hours each week must be given to Fomm, whether those heurs are in the form of meetings or sitting at a table getting a pe1ition signed or even just attending a speaker that we as Student Forum think will enhance the campus awareness of problems such as racism or sexism or vandalism. Most importantly, however, it is our job to relay your concerns to the Forum. If you have any problems or concerns I will listen and make the Forum aware of the way that y<Ju feel. It is necessary to be outspoken and I think that those that I have gotten to know can attest that I am outspoken. I have been committed to the Forum for one year now and have become very familiar with the way it functions and with what it can and can't do. With your help of selecting the right people, Student Forum can accomplish a tremendous amount. Please vote for Michael Rand. Thank you. Steve Lapinski An increasing number of Union students are becoming concerned about their lack of say on campus matters. Due to a series of controversial new decisions, the administration appears to be taking over the campus. However, this does not have to happen. There is tremendous potential for power within the Student Forum. This is ultimately our school, and we deserve a strong say in the policies and rules which will affect us for the remainder of our college careers. This affects every member of the· Union community, Greeks and non-Greeks, women and men. It is up to our elected representatives to make sure the Forum is using its power to the fullest in· order to best represent the entire class. As sophomore class representative, I promise to make sure this is the case. I feel that my strongest attribute is communication. I know that I will be able to listen to and understand all of the ideas and concerns of our class.. I will then make sure that these suggestions are defended in front of the Student Forum. I will also be able to effectively communicate with the administration and with other groups or organizations. I have always been involved in various clubs, activities, and sports, and I have had plenty of leadership experience. I promise to be both an active and enthusiastic representative. Union is a great school. It is important, however, not to be content. There are plenty of improvements which can be made. Vote for Steve Lapinski on Friday and let's make Union an even better place. Alex Johnson Don!t Forget to Vote on Friday J I

' l The Concordiensis STUDENT FORUM May 13, 1993, page All Sophomore Class Representative Additional Candidates Antony Sinanis Do you want the voice of the sophomore class to be heard, or shall it be lost in the silence? If you want to be heard, vote for me, ANTONY SINANIS and I will be your voice. I feel, that by electing me, the sophomore class will be united under a representative that will stop at nothing to make his presence felt. As the voice of the sophomore class, one of the main issues I will confront is the lack of diversity. This is a problem that encompasses the Union College community. I feel, by implementing my communication skills I will be able to encourage the sophomore class to unite under this pertinent issue. Another issue I will bring to the attention of the sophom0re class is the lack of unification between Greeks and RATZ by BEN SMITH independents. By enlightening the sophomore class, we might be able to break down the barriers between independents and Greeks. Thus, by voting for ANTONY SINANIS, you are voting for your voice ! ! ! ! ! Rich Fuerst As sophomore represent- ative, student interests would continue to be my number one priority. First, I would like to work with the student body and the administration to voice your ideas and concerns to improve aspects of campus life. Students here do a commendable job with community service. However, there could be more involvement that could lead to a better feeling of achievement and a more positive feeling from the surrounding community. N()t only would Union be synonymous with outstanding academics but also with a strong feeling of social comm:itment tc the people of Schenectady. Our challenges should be addressed thr<>ugh a willing a!ld knowledgeafule represent- ative who will echo the opinions of the sophom()re dass! Vote RICH FUERST for sophomore representative'!! Bill Ferguson My name is Eill Ferguson, and I am running for Sophomore Representative to the Student Forum. The Student Forum is responsible f()r the allocation of about $30()~000 every year! This is a responsibility that should not be taken lightly. My main ccncern, and the reason for my candidac:_y, is to make sure that said money is appropriated in a manner that is fair to all the students at Union College. Sometimes when people come to the Forum to ask for money, they should , and deserve to, receive it. Other times when people come asking for money for bogus programs or reasons, they should not receive Student Forum money. It is absolutely essential that someone on the Student Forum is there to ask the tough questions about finances and how our money is being spent. My pledge to you is that I'll be there to do just that! After all, it is our money that the Forum is spending. The Forum's money comes from a fee that is added to our tuition every term. You deserve no less than to know your money is being used wisely and appropriately. So I ask you to vote for me if you believe there should be more equity and accQuntability in how the Student Forum spends our .money. You deserve a Representative that will make sure your interests are taken care of on the Student Forum and that bogus special interest groups that don't deserve your money don't get it. \I WILL ask the tough questions!\ Thank you.

\ ·. May 13, 1993, page A12 Can The Nature of the Beast by Dylan J, Ratigan Business Editor Over the course of the past' month of S<l, I chose to write about the coming of a corporate Armageddon. The fact of the matter is that the abandonment of corporate loyalty on the part of middle rnanagers along with big businesses recent fall from dominance may merely be symptoms of a much greater problem. It is possible that the way that our c1nporate system has evolved has created a system that can only breed the results we are now seeing. A system has been created in which there is an abundance of wealth at the top of every major corporation_ I oontend that this distribution of wealth is terribly skewed. This unequal \vage distribution in the corporate sector has created a work force that is very detached from it's supervisors. There is a gap between CEO's and their managers, and the managers and their employees which started as something that was merely fina11cial and has grown into a gaping chasm that makes it nearly impossible for members ()f one group of employee's to relate to another. This chasm has also created a system that lacks any sort of vertical comraderie. Whenever there is a group of people working together in any ,ort of ~ituation and the members of the group fail to relate to one another, it is inevitable that this group will fail. The corporate system that America has created for itself is the perfect example of this ~ituation. Corporate America has created a system that breeds it's employee's to he loyal to no one but themselves. And it is this system that inspires ~ e 1 f- p r e se r v a t i o n a n d advancement that is on the -verge of bringing corporate America to it's knee's. Why exa.ctly this system evolved the way that it did is lmrd to say. Capitalism had it's origins based on the theory that if you were to allow people to peruse their own entrepreneurial interests with as Jittle government intervention as possible that they would act in a manner that was both highly motivated and competitive. This system at the same time would provide consumers with the best Jlossible market prices as a capitalist system, in theory is llighly responsive to consumer demand. BUSINESS The Concordiensis Bridge the Chasm As the system evolved however, those who were successful looked for ways to close out their competitors in order to provide themselves with as much financial security as possible. So, while all of the up and comers were more than willing to supp()rt a free market economy, as soon as they had established themselves in their respective industries the concept of a free market no longer served their interests. So, very shortly after the capitalist system had ~:eached its potential and hundreds of young business people had established t-hemselves, the motivation shifted from one that looked to create to most competitive possible market, to one that was looking to close off the flood gates. The motivation was not to create a system that makes it possible for anyone to succeed, on the contrary, the motivation becomes one in which businessmen ;[ook to create a system in which it is almost impossible for anyone to succeed. This system manifested itself in the form of America's corporate giants. These mammoth corporations were able to create enormous financial and regulatory barriers to entry that made it possible for them to milk the market for all it was worth. Thus, the tremendous influx of cash into the hands of a relatively small group of people. Once this system had been established, one that presented itself under capitalist pretenses, but in fact was operating under a system that was diametrically opposed to the theory of a free market, the CEO's and mangers sat down to divvy up the spoils. The spoils were distributed in a manner that was in direct accordance with the way in which they had been obtained. The people at the top thought of themselves and their immediate peers first. Note the number of high paid vice presidents in any one of Americas large corporations. It is this system that sought to close itself off to the threat of competition, that created a corporate system that is fat and inefficient. It pays enormous salaries to those at the top while it leaves those at the bottom earning just enough that they cannot collect welfare. It is this sort of system that ineluctably breeds resentment, and breaks down the type of comraderie that is necessary for a basiness to succeed. It is this system that has created gaping chasms in the relations between the corporate ranks. And it is this system that has given America's corporate l()yalty the axe, and this system that has brought about the end or at best a massive restructuring of the corporate era. This system of paying the select few at the tile top an inordinate amount of money while leaving those at the bottom to starve has filtered it's way into almost every aspect of our so~iety. Case in point, the president of Union College Rodger Hull earned $152,563 plus benefits for the '91..:'92 school yei\T. The next \Does the financial gap between the president of our coHege and the rest of it's employees ac- count for th.e possible gaps in loyalty felt on the part of the student body and faculty.\ closest salary at the college was $106,000, and the highest paid professor made a little bit more than half of what Mr. Hull made. T!tese. numbers can be compared to the fact that the people in dining services, and the secretarial staff earn between $10,000-$20,000 annually. The question is not whether or not Mr. Hull is twenty times more valuable· an employee than someone who works full time in dining services, that question is moot, no one is worth twenty times more than any other human being, financially or otherwise. The real question is does the fact that the creation of a perverted corporate system that has infiltrated every aspect of our economy serve as an explanation of our current societal woes? Does the financia:l gap between the president of our college and the rest of it's employee's account for possible gaps in loyalty felt on the part of the student body m1d the facuhy? Does this situation of detachment from the welfare of others account for some of the wasteful behavior that goes on at this institution? Can the fact that ,there is a leaky faucet in Raymond that no body seems interested in fixing that is wasting at least 60,000 gallons of water a year, can this fact be traced back to the financial gaps that exist between our president and those who wmlld be responsible for ending such waste? Can .this fact be trac~d beyond the gates of Union to a system that has created looming financial chasms throughout our entire society? Perhaps the odgins of the problem lay in some very different, more complex causal argument, but the fact of the matter is that the leaky faucet has not been fixed for over a year, the corporate giants are dealing with a set of circumstances much more dire th&._n any of their worst nightmares, and the day of reckoning is getting closer every second of everyday.

J¥p u - -Ma~ 13, 1993 Baile,y Field to Be Renovated Courtesy of Public Relations Since Frank Bailey Field was completed in August of 1981, the athletic facility at Union College has provided ,countless hours of near maintance-free use for the school's intercollegiate and intramural programs as well as for numerous high school events. The artificially-surfaced field and surrounding track wi II undergo a renovatiofl that will begin on Monday, May 17 and is expected to run thro11gn the middle of July. The playing field, which was named Frank Bailey Field in 1988 in honor of Fraak Bailey, Class of 1885, will have its existing carpet and underlying pad replaced. Meanwhile, the surrounding six-lane, 400 meter resilite track, will be upgraded to a polyurethane surface. \The field has been a real positive asset to the college\ said athletic director Richard Sakala. \When the dedsion to construct the field was. made in 1980, we knew there would come a time that the playing surface would have to be replaced. The original carpet came with an eight-year warranty and we were uble to get 12 years or extcnsi ve usage for our intercollegiate and intramural programs as well as for numerous high school and other special events.\ Two companies will be working on the project. The Balsam Company, whk:h put down the original carpet, will replace the existing astroturf with an upgraded version of the knitted 11ylon surface. The big change, however, will be in the underlying pad. The E-laycr System will provide a better cushion than the original pad because of its porous construction, wi II greatly improve surface drainage. The track renovation will be undertaken by the Copeland Company of Nassau, New York. Completion of the project is expected to be in time for Union's summer camp activities. The baseball/softball camp, scheduled for the end of June, will be moved from Bailey Field to the diamond 0n Alexander Field, across from Alumni Gym. None of the eights or the men's varsity open four were able to make it out of the quarter final round. The men's novice eight came closest out of this group missing semi- finals by only four seconds. They ended up finishing 14th out of 2 I. The women'.s varsity eight and novice eight finished 15th and 18th For the Union College Crew Team this is their first National Title ever. For the lightweight four this capped an undefeated ( 46 ... 0) season that included a state championship. However , the most impressive statistics are held by J .J. Weiner. In addition to the state and national title, he compiled Track Competes at Albany by Jonathan Simon Contributing Writer This past weekend the Union Track tearn attended the New York State tra<:k meet at Albany. The meet was a two day affair encompassing Friday evening and all day Saturday. Friday's memorable performances were in the men's 4x 100 where the tea.m of Matt Schmitter, Jonathan Simon, Frank Attah, and Ch~od Riley ran 45.1 0. Later that evening John Metz (36:03.61) and Adam Russell (38:22:01) ran the 10,000 both faring quite well. Saturday saw the rnen's 4x800 and 4x400 meter relay teams run exceptionally well. The 4x800 team of ]()nathan Simon, Mike Leding, Marc Sheridan, and Russ Stram ran a seasonal best and impressive 8:22. The 4x400 fared just as well. The team of Jonathan Simon, Mike Leding, Russ Stram, and Kevin Pestalano ran 3:32. On the track the team looked sharp and an air of enthusiasm was felt towards this week's meet and towards next season. The notable performances in the field events were a fourth place finish by Chuck Cleveci (Javelin-52.06m). And the best open performance of the meet for Union track was put in by Matt Stern with a jump of 6-2 in the high jump. This season is concluding on a very good note. Even better times are expected this week where several athletes are looking for bids to the NCAA Division III Nationals. I encourage you to come out and cheer on this great and rising team Friday.

• May 13, 1993, page B2 Mets by Greg Kalish Associate Sports Editor ' Once upon a time, in a land called Flushing Meadow, there resided a team who played b-aseball. They didn't just play baseball, they exceUed at it, ruthlessly maraude:t;ing anyone who dared enter their domain known as Shea Stadiam. They played with a hustle, a determination, a fire, a charisma, all of which resulted in two divisional championships and a world championship. They had names like Dykstra, Hernandez, Carter, Wilson, the backbone of the unit. And people came to Shea Stadium to watch this team play, and the people cheered and applauded the efforts being put forth on the field of play. The players were proud to be New York Mets, and the people were pround to be their fans. These days, its hard to tell whether or not this New York Mets team even knows what sport they have chosen as their occupation in life. While the attendance thins and the clubhouse distractions continue, the losses mount making Shea Stadium a far different place from what it was less than a decade ago. With players such as Bobby Bonilla and Vince Coleman leading the league in salaries and indifference, the Mets have tumbled into last place in the National League East, two games behind the expansion Florida Marlins and just two games ahead of the Colorado Rockies for the worst record in Major league BasebalL And while it is difficult to point fingers at individual players (since baseball is a team sport) Bonilla and Coleman both SPORTS The C oncordiensis Seasonal Woes Continue perfectly epitomize this year's dub. CoLeman was signed three years ago in an attempt to CE>mpensate for the loss of DruTyl Strawberry. He signed a ll.!lcmtive three-year deal worth nearly twelve million doHars. It is hard to figure out exactly what the Mets found so inviting about Coleman. Perhaps his low career batting average, his horrendous fielding, or maybe his indifference to both his pr:ofession and his teammates. Either way, Coleman spent nearly two-thirds of his first two years with the Mets on the disabled list. During those two years, however, he created his share of non-baseball related fireworks, a resume that inciludes two shouting matches with coaches and an on the fie.nd shoving match with manager Jeff Torborg. This year, Vince has picked up right where he left off. While to his credit, he reported to spring training in fine sh~pe, and has yet to punch or push any of his coaches or teammates, his lack of concern is one of the main reasons the Mets are where they are. Last week, Coleman dropped a routine t1y ball in left field at Shea because he \forgot\ to wear his sunglasses. Three weeks ago, he was swinging a golf club in the Mets clubhouse and hit Doc Gooden in his pitching shoulder. Gooden was forced to miss his start as a result. just two days into the season, he chaUenged New York Daily News writer Bob Klapisch to a physical confrontatkm in the Mets locker room after a game. ' Since his signing and his two home-runs in the first game of last year season, everything has gone downhill for Bobby Bo. His batting average is buried in the low two~hundreds and, at one point,. he had gone 0-8 I with runners in scoring position. He is receiving Hearly six-million dollars a season for llol \0 his abominable play, making g him one of the biggest rip-offs ~ \' in baseball history. He gets : booed no matter what he does ~ ·;:: and that famous Bobby Bonila ~ smile which was supposed to revive the Mets and lead them back to glory, is aU but dead. A smile now would probably break some blood vessels in his face. The collapse the Mets have endured cannot solely be blamed on Bonilla and Coleman. They haven't had a second baseman or shortstop hit over .220 in three years, they have been striken with injuries to key players such as Doc Gooden, Bret Saberhagen, and John Franco, and they haven't had an effective middle reliever since the flood. As of now, they are eleven and a half games out of first place, the most in th~ majors. Yet, optimism for a turnaround still remains. Eddie Murray is off to a fine season, Gooden leads the league in lowest earned-run- average and Anthony Young is getting closer to breaking that monstrous personal losing streak that now stands at seventeen. If this trend continues, the Mets just might make a run at the division title, and then the league Steve Klopfer following tnPough at the net during the Union Tennis Home Finale last week.

• The Concordiensis FEATURES May 13, 1993, page B3 Conversation in ,New &Improved the Nude :uncle Edna ~----~--------------~ Erin M. O'Neil Features Editor I recently had the unique privilege to attain an up-close interview with one of Union Colleges' most sought after students- Naked Mike. Naked Mike is one of the two fearless males I spoke about in my article last week. 'For those of you who missed it, Naked Mike and his cohort Naked Christian were recently spotted, wel;l,, naked at a fraternity party at the College. This topic .sparked my interest, thus I arranged an interview for all of yo1:1 enquiring minds out the:r:e. Unfortunately the interview was conducted without the presence of Naked Christian, which was too bad, for it would have been nice to get the whole picture. Nevertheless, the conversation was stimulating as Naked Mike and myself (clothed) sat by the stream in Jackson Gardens and dug deep into the pit of his soul. Here's what he had to say. EMO: So tell me Naked Mike, when did you first get naked at Union College, and why? NM: (Laughs softly) Well, let me thi~k. My first nakeq event took place the winter of my sophomore year, I'm a junior now. Anyway, Naked Christian and I were bored one night and were looking to play some beer pong. But then we thought, \Man wouldn't it be a lot more fun if we got naked?\ So I stripped down NM: (Grins) Funny. Naked. I liked it. That's why I've been doing it ever since. EMO: Has your nakeclness had any effect en yo1:1r sex life? NM: No, not really. Well actually, that night that you wrote about in your article I hoeked up with a girl before I got naked,. and then hooked up with her again afterwa:r:ds. EMO: Hmm_., interesUng. How do you find that women, in general, react to your nakedness? NM: (shrugs) Women like it. I just think they like seeing guys naked. The fact that it's me is a bonus. EMO: Do you .find now that people think of you as \The Naked Man\? NM: Yes, well at Union College there's a seven day gossip cycle. People talked about it for seven days after it happened, hut it got an additional seven days worth after your artiCle. That means I was talked about for fourteen days. Wow! (Smiles) EMO: Would you ever ~et naked with out your partner, Naked Christian? NM: (nods) Yes, definitecly. I think it says a lot about me, like that I'm self-confident. A lot of peeple have talents: they can sing or act in front of other people. My talent is that I can get naked in front of people. I think that's pretty unique. With thos.e other people, y<lu can't see that they're nervous. But if I'm nervous you can see it physically. and I put on my cango- a wool EMO: So are you self- hat and a pair of golf shoes. confident? Oh yeah, and a scarf, so I NM: Yes. wouldn't get cold. Naked EMO: What do you feel aie Christian wore his fishing. hat your best attributes? and bowling. shoes. We had NM: Physical? EMO: Anything else? NM: I have a nice goatee. EMO: You can see that with your clothes on or off. NM: Yeah, you're right. Well, I guess you could say I don't mask my oody with clothes. I mask my face with a goatee. EMO: So you don't Uke your face? NM: I'm neutral to it. I have nice, teeth. EMO: Do you feel you and Naked Christian have a special bond as a ·result of your joint nakedness? NM: Naturally. But we had a special bond before the nakedness. A very special bond. In fact it was that bond that caused us to get naked together in the first place. EMO: S0 nakedness strengthens the bond? NM: (nods enthusiastically) Yes, definitely. EMO: What are your favorite naked activities? NM: Beer pong- naked or clothed. I also like to play air guitar and pretend I'm in the Grateful Dead. EMO: Hey, me too! But aren't you forgetting sex? NM: Yes, I guess s,ex falls into that category. By the way, I agree with what you said about the guys who do the naked Nott run. Those imposters aren't naked. The ultimate naked feat would be to get naked indoors somewhere. Like the College Center. EMO: Is that your ultimate naked goal? NM: No, I don't think so. I'm not quite there as a full fledged nudist. I mean, I'm good, but this isn't e:xactly a tough league. EMO: What is y o u r ultimate naked goal? fun, but it was just a bunch of EMO: Yes. NM: I have a continuing guys at the party, and I think goal to recruit fellow some of them were kind of NM: Well I'm thin, girls nakedteers. I've dedicated my annoyed. They gave us a hard like that. life to helping others enjoy time. EMO: Thin, or lean? their nakedness. Of course, it EMO: How did you feel NM: Lean, of course.

So, I guess this is a dedication to those people and 1'11 just a mention a few of my favorites: 1) Seinfeld- OK, granted he is the star of the show, but nothing ever seems to go right for him. I really canit think of one episode where he comes out on top. In the last episode I saw Seinfeld was dating a virgin (whom he referred to as \every man's dream come Seinfeld!

The Concordiensis ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT Shari Benstock on Wharton Biography by Talley Belsinger Co-Arts Editor ., Last Tuesday visiting speaker' Shari Benstock spoke about her soon to be completed biography of Edith Wharton, author of House Of Mirth. Shari Benstock comes from the University of Miami and was a past English professor of Unio~ Professor Edi Giunta. Benstock 1s author .of the well known books Women Of The Left Bank, and Textualizing The Feminine. Benstock's decision to write a biography on Edith Wharton is a courageous one because it will be the successor ·.of R.W. Lewis' first Wharton biography. Benstock stated that one of the motivating factors of her work is that since Lewis's publication volumes of unpublished materials, mainly letters, have been discovered. These volumes are now housed in the Yale Library. She went on to speak a??ut the trials and tribulations .of wntmg a biography. For Benstock the hardest issue that must be dealt with is to decide what is fact and what is fiction in Wharton's life. Where the Lewis biography did help Benstock to grasp the general time line of Wharton's life and to become better acquainted with her major life shaping events., she ~ad ! to question many of his theones. Benstock discovered through her research of the new letters, that while Lewis did make many correct connections and assumptions about Wharton's life, the release of these new. sources showed her that there were instances where there was no authoritative sources behind some of the popular stories and gossip that · had formed Wharton's history. This is where Benstock's research got exciting and challenging. Some of her most valuable sources were medical, court and tax records, burial plots and vaults as well as newspapers and publications from. Wharton's lifetime. Benstock reminded us that as more time lapses between the death of Women of the Left Bank Edith Wharton THE HOUSE OF MIRTH Student Exhibition \Intimacy''' and \The Illustrated Raven\ THE DEPARTMENT OF VISUAL ARTS AT UNION COLLEGE PRESENTS: A combined exhibition of \Intimacy\ and \The Illu.strated Raven\ will be on display in the Arts Atrium at Union College on Sunday, May 16-May 22, 1993. Opening Reception: Sunday. May 16. 1993 4:00PM. The public is invited. . Lauren Kohl, currently a senior art student at Union College, has created a series of drawings entitled \Intimacy\. She is interested in the human form and the numerous ways that it can express emotions without the use of verbal language. \Intimacy\ explores the em<Jtions of joy and love expressed by, and for another human being. The drawings in this series are done with charcoal on paper. Zaibi Chaudhry, a senior biology I arts major at Union College has spent the last six months studying wild and captive, injured ravens. She is fascinated with the challenge of bridging the gap between the arts and the sciences. Complementing a scientific comparative analysis/ the \Illustrated Raven\ e:xplores avenues of artistic expression and representation of biological forms through graphite drawings and etchings. WRITE FOR ARTS. CALL 370-6155. Wharton and the publication ot her biography that the number of actual living acquaintances of Wharton diminishes. This was another area where Lewis' biography was helpful because he had verbal accounts about Wharton from relatives and friends that are no longer accessible for Benstock. Some interesting and mysterious aspects from Wharton's life that Benstock addresses in her biography include the question of Wharton's paternity, that of Edith's relationship with her husband Teddy Wharton, Wharton's possible mental illness in the late 1880's, and her affair with her lover Morton Fullerton. One of Benstock's most difficult tasks was to decide with discretion what to print about Wharton and what to keep private. Also another interesting ethical question that Benstock was faced with was uncovering the truth about favorite Wharton stories that had been embellished and passed along. It seemed hard for her to strip some of the magic and eccentricities from Wharton's life in her pursuit for the cold hard facts. Shari Benstock concluded the lecture with some advice for biographical writers as well as readers of biographies. Her advice to the biographers is to get out onto the streets and dig deep into archives because they are rich with information. She said to think like detectives and try and Verify everything even if it means that some of the best stories ~elt away. She reminded students to take every biographical fact with a grain of salt and to remember that biographies are purely! interpretation, even if they . are grounded in fact. Finally, Benstock gave a word of hope that she used as inspiration for her biogrctphy, she reminded her listeners that all the information is never totally unearthed, there is always somethini! new to be discovered.

May 13, 1993, page B8 ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT The Concvrdiensis WAYNE TRIMM by Belinda Crago Co-Arts Editor Presented in part by the Biology· Department and the Department of Visual Arts, Wayne Trimm, naturalist/ artist, lectured on the field of Biological Illustration in the College Center Auditorium on Thursdav Mav 6th. J ' In his forty ppblished books, including Birds of Ch.ina and Guild Hand Book of Scientific Illustrating, Trimm unites biology and art. In his introduction of Trimm, Visual Arts Professor Walter Hatke, insisted that bringing together these two fields \optimizes a Liberal Arts education.\ With \Bramble\, his pet Great Horned Ow I resting on his arm, Trimm proceeded to explain the nature and significance of Biological Illustration. Trimm insisted that this art is a non verbal form of communication and a \way of reaching other pe()ple without sounds, written word or modem forms of communication.\ The field originated, explained Trimm, in an attempt to discover new worlds in America's early history. Artists used to work from dead creatures, which lead to a \stiff\ illustration, but now it entails a detailed understanding of anatomy from live creatures. Getting out irt the fields while working in groups trained in differen! disciplines gives way to the most effective technique of Biological Illustration. The class \Illustrative Organism\ taught in part by Walter Hatke of the Visual Arts Department and Professor Carl George of the Biology Department, makes excellent use of. this method, praised Trimm. After his introduction to his field, Trimm energetically proposed: \Let's have an open house\ and turned the table (and the owl) over to his wife, a Wild Life Educator, to discuss the habitat and nature of birds of prey. Through her demonstration, and many questions from the audience, . we learned of many unique characteristics of the· owl. Both Trimm and his wife emphasized the personality of \Bramble\ and other owls, instead of generalizing all birds of prey into one category. The Trimm family, including their young son, presented a down-to- earth, \hands on\ type of lecture that both entertained and enlightened the audience. By \talking with people\ instead of \to them\ Wayne Trimm and his wife succeeded in their task to \educate about wildlife.\ Trimm even made an owl call (and a very goo€! one) at the audiences request. \UNTITLED #1\ BY LAUREN KOHL PRIZE DAY CONCERT ILLARD Photo by Brianna Patnode CHET's CoRNER We hope that everyone enjoyed the music of Bogart last week ...

A big bailg of colorful sparks .flared from the sky as the Union crowd oohed and aahed at the sigllt. A couple of comments shared by some spirited Uni()n student.;;: \What is better than Fourth of July in May'?\ -Cheryl Blitt \They were spectacular!\ -Bethany Cooper \It brought the whole school together- it was not just a Greek event or an independent event- everyone was included. -Rebecca Kleinhandler \The fireworks were emblematic· of our Union College experience- they came and went\ -Sherine Nabih \I laughed, I cried, it was better than Cats.\ -Heather Gauntt The Union spirit carried through the weekend with a booming carnival on West Beach on Saturday afternoon. Quite a few booths, in addition to a barbeque feast, compliments of West Dining Services, were enjoyed by Union students. Sigma Delta Tau and Theta Delta Chi were two houses that represented the Greeks. SOT's \Sink the Sig Delt\ was quite a hit, according to brave sisters Jamie Aronson, Niki Beland, Jen Anderson, and Tracey Galiatsatos, who were all cold and wet by the end of the day. TDChi presented. \Go Fish,\ where talented participants won a fish for tossing a ping pong ball into a cup of water. The Student Forum attempted a pie throwing booth, but the pudding and whipped cream slowed business Schenectady, NY down a bit. SADD was aiso popular with its fruity flavored snowcones. As for the grand food display, West Dining was flipping hamburgers and hotdogs all day, not to mention Academic Dishonesty The Debate Continues by Jennifer Unterberg Contributing Writer On May 17, 1993, wllat began as a town meeting at Chet's to discuss Academic Honesty at Union ended with an emotional discussion between students and faculty, conveying the complexity af such an issue. The Sub-Committee on Honesty and Practice organized a panel discussion, at four professors defined cheating and told why i1 is wrong. For students. however, the task of defining cheating proved insignificant in comparison to the definitio11 of 'merit' and how 'effort' shol!ld be measured. Many Uni<Jn students expressed fati glle because of the burden of pressures at Union to obtain excellence. as well as frustration by the mixed- messages conveyed between the college's emphasis ()D 'merit' and a grading system which places numbers ()n performance. Professor B arbanel, Mathematics Department Chair. began the discussion by reading an excerpt from the document delivered to the mathematics students on their arrival to his class, outlining the definition of cheating. Professor Barbanel stated that although cheating on exams may be difficult. 'problem sets' designed to replicate problems which graduate students may encounter in graduate school and research. are assumed to be done on an individual basis, and yet may not be. Professor Barbanel asked the audience of students to create an atmosphere at Union in which cheating is unacceptable due to \positive peer pressure.\ The second speaker, Professor Carroll, of the Chemistry Department, defmed cheating as \the act of taking someone else's idea and claiming it to be yours.\ Professor Caroll elaborated eloquently on the complexity of the issue of cheating by posing questions to the audience. For instance, in a classroom, what is the mentality of the students? Do students assume if the teacher does not state any rules and regulations that it is pennissible to study off of old tests and to work in groups; or is it the opposite, where students presume that if the professor does not mention anything, that each student should conduct all studies on his own? Professor Carroll suggested a 'vicious cycle' of cheating. where knowledge is cumulative; that is. the knowledge one fails to master in the beginning will result in a continuous state of 'catching up'. This state will cause one to constantly rely on other people. and forever falling one step behind, fail we to succeed in future research or career aspiration due to the inability to progress with ingenuity. Professor McCarty focused on this concept of ingenuity by using a scenario to illustrate her point. The scenario was one of her calling the other professors and inconspicuously gaining information on their ideas, yet presenting them as her own. She asked the audience why her action would bother them. Senior. Karen Hurwitz, responded that Pro fe s so r M c C arty' s presentation of the ideas of her colleagues strips the panel of a unique perception, devaluating the need for four speakers. Professor McCarty agreed. \It's as if there should just lle one speaker instead of four.\ The error in cheating, suggested by Professor McCarty, is its inability to provoke novel ideas.

College this Spring Term, students wonder why the · College Center. a popular and crowded meeting place, is not .air-conditioned. Spring Term of 1993 bas already seen its share of humid days. Any student going to check his/her mail after a 10:00 class knows that the College Center easily .becomes hot and crowded. Unfortunately, like many projects on the campus, the air- conditioning question revolves .around budget constraints. · Construction of the College Center began in the Summer of ,1985 and was completed in the Summer of 1987. \As with any construction, you always need to reconcile what goes in to the project and the available budget,\ explained Joseph Mammola, Vice President for Campus Life. The college also renovated Alumni Gym at the same time. Because of budgetary constraints, \it was decided that cuts had to be made. The decision was to air- condition only certain areas. 11 said Vice President Marnmola. These areas include the Bookstore, the Administration Offices and the Auditorium. those spaces which are used during the summer months. Vice President Mammola realizes that one could argue the school should have foun<l the money to install the air- conditioning in 1987, as it would have been cheaper theu. However. limited resources called for cuts to be made. If it wasn't air-conditioning, it would have been something else. To install the system today. the school has to increase the chiller capacity,, add more ducts and tear down some walls, an expensive project. Consequently, the college has no immediate plans to install air-conditioning in the College Center. Dutch Hollow Restaurant will be renovated this summer to make way f<J:r the new Vali-Dine System, whic.h will create a new way <Jf serving food. Within this renovation, they will try to improve the \air-handling and air-flow.\ \Unfortunately we don't have funds to air- condition at the time,\ Vice President Mammo1a said.

Blood pressure and eye tests were taken by licensed nurses and optomologists to check the well being of Union students. Nurses Pauline Streeter and Mangie Roca from The · Schenectady Blood Pressure Clinic reported, \the blood pressure of the students were very good. The Universal Average is 120/80 and most students were 110/72, wich indicates normal to low.\ The Union College Annual Health Fair took place Thursday, May 13, in the College Center. The :purpose of the fair; as described by Sandy Moshe, director of Health Services. was to promote well-being at Union and inform the students of what preventative medkation is out there. Representatives from thirteen health organizations included Schenectady Family Health Service, Planned Parentho0od, Associates in Women's Health Care, and The American Red Cross. Representatives set up booths full of information brochures, free exercise tapes, and free condoms. \I'd say the longest line was at Dr. Fox's eye examination booth,\ Ms. Moshe stated. \My favorite booth,\ Union Cellege student, Tenly Fisher. announced, \was the Planned Parenthood table. They had roses made out of Condoms, which was cool, and they had this funny pop-up book called Peeping Pete. It was great.\ As Nurse Streeter left the College Center, she smiled, \it was a fun day.

I I li ' l . I i The Concordiensis NEWS Faculty Addresses Dishonesty cont. from pg. 1 cheating, replication persists over intellect. Lastly, Professor Frazier of tile English Department offered tllree philosophical perceptions on :the definition of cheating: one Philosophy professor had defined cheating as an act of 'deceit', as in the deception of 'knowledge'; another defined cheating as an act of 'theft', as in stealing tile ideas of aAother; and thirdly, as an act of 'corruption' in clieating's disruption of the harmony and values of society. Following these perspectives, Professor Frazier ilhrstrated the act of cheating as an English professor would, by giving examples. These examples included \recording the answers onto a tape and listening to it on a walkman during an exam\ an.d \placing a brilliant piece of work in your not so brilliant piece of work.\ Although each of the four professors conveyed their personal feeHngs on cheating, the crucial turning point in the discussion occurred when cheating was defined as more than a defiance against school policy, but as an obstacle to the professors' goaL Professor Frazier shouted, \we're here to help the students. Call it a crazy profession, but we want to teach you.\ As h::e stated this, the audience shifted in their seats and swayed the discussion away from the crime of cheating and towards the possible cause of cheating at Union. One Union student spoke of the pressure at Union to act as if everything that is taught in . a classroom is understandable. That it is a difficult task to risk looking \stupid\ in front of classmates when asking a question about a confusing topic. Another student confessed that besides the ritual of office hours, he does not feel as if the professors are really interested Security in students' learning and understanding. Union College exists as a h~gMy competitive school in whicll students continuously feel tile ;pressure to acquire new ill.formation with ease and brilliance. A Union ·student relayed to the audience that as a Prec..Med, he was made well aware: by professors that A's are th-e key to Medical School. Another student told of the re<dit~ of a high cumulative opening the doors to graduate scho0-ls. The senior exclaimed, \rece11tly rejected from some graduate schools, I know how hard it is to get into graduate scho()[. For many schools the cut off is a 3.0. I know I could do better than many students out tllere, but grades are what count:s.\ Altllough Professor Frazier disagreed with the importance Of gFades for graduate SChool, placing more value on recommendations and GRE score·s, a Pre-Med student begged· to differ. The complexity .of the issue of Ac:ademic Dishonesty seems to stem from the array of pressmes and mixed messages sensed by the students. At a liberal arts college, such as Union, where knowledge and intellectual curiosity is applauded by professors, the reality of the system used to meas:ure one's knowledge, one's 'merit', may, in fact, be frustJating to· students who often times feel as if their merit is mot being measured accU1ately. The grading syste:m may be creating an environment in which the magnitude of the pressure to remain competitive is so great that honesty becomes obsolete. As one student said, \all that matters are grades. When you get out of a test, no one asks you what you learned, all thtey ask you is your grade.\ Is it possible that the real question is not the definition of Report REPORrED INC.IDEIITS TO THE CAMPUS SAFElY DEPARTMENT Monday, May 10, 1993 through Sunday, May 16, 1993 PATE BEPORTE!)• TIME REPORTED· LOCATION· INCIDENT 5/10/93 12•10am 5110193 7•4Qarn 5·11 0/93 12'56pm 5110193 2·5C!prn 5110193 4•1§pm 5/1 0/93 5·1C!pm 5111193 4·3(tpm 5111193 10'40pm 5112193 1:00am 5/12193 2 • 2 Oa m 5112193 2·20am 5112193 3:4 2\ m 5112193 9:3Oam 5112193 4:45!lm 5113193 2 • 0 6a m 5113193 3 ·IJ.Oa m 5113193 4·!i7am 5113/93 1 ·~1p m S/13193 .1 0·24pm fHj4193 t2mld 5114/93 2 ,.,sam 5114193 J·tspm 5114193 5 •!JOo m 5114193 s '/ISpm 5114193 10·20pm 5115193 B :OOam 5115193 t ·OOpm 5115193 4;00pm 5115193 4;'!5prn 5115193 11 ;Sopm 5/1'6193 12·34am 5116193 2 ·:I lam 5116193 2 '34.am 5116/93 2 ;3 7am 5!16193 3;1Qam West Co I !~:tqe: Student mj schjef Fox House Vandalism- Trash can des1royed-urjne on floor West College Theft-gold chain Dayidsqn H ol9se Vanda!lsm .. wjndow College CentEr Theft-key• Ejeldhqu.se Theft-Sneakers Hans Groot 1<111 Off Campus West Col!ede Harassment of studen1 North Co!!eg., Rodent problem Eero tfouse Suspicious qr(!up S & E SafetY Hazard FOx House Eire-minor damage .. no Injury Webster HolJ se Odor of mariiuana South Colle~ o Computer Ctr.

For many studeAts at Union. the pressure from parents, graduate schools, and corporations to graduate with a high cumulative average may be so great that the inner excitement for education, the inner need for knowledge and the inner pride for 'doing one's own work' is put aside to allow room to focus on obtaining the highest cumulative possible. at any cost. Acknowledging the complexity of such an issue, Union must work from all sides; working to promote an environment which not only punishes the act of cheating due to the crime of theft and its corruption to society at large, but an environment which does not allow for a facade of knowledge in a classroom full ofconfusion. Once professors are shown that not all topics are immediately understood, an environment can be created in which professors and students work together to enable all students to master a topic, fulfilling both pressures: graduating from Union with the knowledge and confidence to be able to create one's own ideas, as well as, an impressive cumulative average. The discussion on cheating and wily it is wrong addressed many of these important issues. This is just the beginning of the effort to make students more aware of academic honesty and the Jack of it at Union. These issues will be addressed further tonight at 7:00pm in Fero House as students and faculty gather to discuss grades and Union's grading policy.

Here's a new flash - Dade County, Florida - English is no longer the 1 official language for the population, 50% of whom speak Spani.sh as their native tongue, where Italian and . Hispanic peoples make up the majority. As one Dade County resident stated, \This country is • made of immigrants, we should realize and honor this\ • and such se~_ms to be the attitude among the majority of · residents involved in this landmark decision. But even though the attitude among those living :in the county seems to be overwhelmingly jubilant, the repercussi~ns of this decision are being entirely overlooked. This has the potential to change the entire . way this c<>untry is run, from being a monolingual society to one which discourages American unity. There will always be those in power who are only concerned with preserving the status quo, thus protecting their power. And there will also always be, those not in power who wish to be, and who; relentlessly cry for revolution and change to-put them in such a position. It seems that the latter group mentioned above has won a monumental fight, but the change which will ensue· can not help the country. · With quite a high illiteracy rate at present, adding· another language or two would only be detrimental. America needs to recognize the importance of all of its 1 cultures, but it is crucial that a premium is placed on education, and that all members of the country may function well together, because we cannot afford to waste valuable human resources. Making English the national language, and encouraging its use will better· the country without detracting from the cultural individuality that makes this country so great.

App·lause for Peer Facilitators To the editor: On behalf of the Orientation Committee and Orientation Advisors, I would like to sincerely thank and applaud the Peer Facilitators for their tremendous effort in conducting the Diversity Workshop on Thursday, May 13. The program they put on for the students was not only educational and informative, but thought provoking, as well. · · The workshop the Peers performed was used as an effective device to convey and discuss many topics that the Union College Community deals with on a daily basis like diversity, multiculturalism, racism, etc. At first glance, many assumed that the workshop would include a long lecture accompanied by numerous facts and figures done in national studies, but they were wrong. The program evolved into a dynamic performance where those present took the leading role in debating issues that troubled the minds of many. To top it off,. the video shown by the Peer Facilitators (which was shown on a national broadcast) appeared alarmingly real and many were taken back by what their eyes had just witnessed. The following discussion that the Peer Facilitators prompted among the group challenged LETTERS the thoughts, views, and ideas of those present. In conclusion, I would just like to remark about the job the Peer Facilitators accomplish on a weekly basis. ln my opinion, they are all amazing and their work is professionally done. The enormous amount of time the Peers log in to put on a workshop like this one, often goes. unnoticed. But, its worth it! The Peer Facilitators made a difference in my life and those who attended. It is just a crying shame that only 3.75 % of the whole Union College Community elected to attend this program. Until a person has not experienced a diversity workshop of this sort; they have not experienced life at all. Joseph B. Saltzbart '94 Orientation Committee Co-Chair Thanks For a Successful Concert To the Editor: Last Saturday, Union's orchestra and choir gave a pedormance in Memorial Chapel. Several works were performed, including Mendelssohn's violin concerto played by Liz Maranville and a premiere pedormance of \In Transit\. As the composer of \In Transit\ I would just like to thank all those involved who helped make it a success. I send a hearty thanks to the members of the orchestra who were patient and worked diligently to make the performance memorable. I would also like to thank Hilary Tann, who was instrumental (pun intended) in both the fabrication and performance of \In Transit\. Dawn Parisi was also vital to the completion of \In Transit\ as without her there would have been no music at all! . Finally, I would like to thank all those who came to the concert- everyone's support was rn uch appreciated. There is one other thing I would like to mention. The Prize Day concert, and Steinmetz symposium weekend as a whole, represent what Union could be. It is a shame we get a chance to see the various paths students are following so rarely.- In particular, music (as well as the Arts Department as a whole) could greatly benefit and become a substantial part of Union College's atmosphere if students are willing to talce the initiative. I can only hope that I have begun something that others may follow and surpass. to both better themselves and the Arts as a whole on Union's campus. To KG, YC, JP, BP, JH, KH, LM, and anyone else who hears my voice, I leave you one final statement. The torcb has been passed. Jason Buchwald '93 .

The Concordiensis Response To Diversity Workshops To the Editor: After attending a number of diversity workshops held on campus we can not understand why so many students, faculty. and administrators complain about lack of diversity and social awareness on campus. It was clear from the attendance (or lack ,there of) at the latest workshop that our college campus does not feel the need to be educated on this topic any further. As John Gray mentioned in his workshop (\Black White. and Gray\) y6ur silence indicates that you understand and agree with the existing attitude toward diversity at Union College. For those of us who did attend, the workshop was very thought provoking .and the experience will definitely be beneficial to our lives. Thank you peer facilitators for making these diversity workshops available to those of us who still feel that we have something to leam. Sincerely. Lisa Schneider Dayna Greenberg Greek Week Conflicts Arise To the Editor: Recent events during Greek Week have shed some light on gender inequalities on this campus. Specifically. a softball game between two sororities on the designated women's field met with conflict. A scheduling mistake placed two fraternities on the same field during the same time block. Instead of engaging in rational discussion to settle the discrepancy, the fraternities ignored the sororities, who were already occupying the field. and began playing their game. Some individual brothers went so far as to throw balls at the women remaining on the field. The I.F.C. and Panhell members present were totally ineffective in remedying the situation in a fair manner. Later on that day as well as the following day, members of one of the fraternities felt the need to shout insults at our sorority during other Greek Week activities. Apparently, this harassment came from our attempt tp, stand up for ourselves during the softball field incident. This might .seem like a minor matter, but it .struck us as indicative of the subordinate status of women on this campus. Clearly, the men felt it was their inherent \right\ to play on the field, despite the valid arguments of the sorority women. It is frightening to realize that such blatant disrespect for women was accepted that day. Had any discussion in an attempt to solve this petty error taken place between the men and the women, perhaps this letter would not be necessary. As it stands, no formal apology has been made, revealing the attitude that no hann was done. We don't agree. Sincerely, The Sisters of Sigma Delta Tau Lack of Support Continues To the Editor: Last week, the Peer Facilitators sponsored another program in the Diversity Series. Black, White, and Gray, presented by John Gray. was the program last week. This was . an interactive program that attempted to reach the heart of feelings about \isms\, not just the intellectual side of \isms\. Unfortunately. only - approximately seventy people showed up for the program.

Even at tlle most widely attended e:v.ent (Tom Pannida, about 25<1 in attendance) the number of a-dministrators and faculty was small. J:ohn Gray was also di:;heartened by this.

For WORLD NEWS THE MIDDLE EAST by l.ara Greenberg Con cordiensis Staff The Middle East peace talks hit a rut last week when Pales~inians cut back the size of their delegation in protest of what they called \lack of seriousness\ on the part of· Israel about their proposal for a self-governed Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .. The Palestinians also deemed the Israeli announcement to allow the return of an additional25 of the 400 deportees, i..rladequate. n,e total number returned would then stand at 126, but the Palestinians say tlley are holding ou1 for fuH return. Later in 1he week, the United States fm the first time in the current peace talks intervened, trying to persuade Israelis and Palestinians to agree on a plan for Palestinian self-rule. The United States failed in bringing about· any progress, which marked the end of the third week of the talks. The proposal was outlined by the United States in a brief document which the Palestinians and Israelis rejected because of the language used. The document outlined the arrangements for the self- rule, which included the dissolution of the civil administration and a new body to run the ins and outs of the Palestinians' lives. Finally, the document placed the territories in the bands of the the United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338. Both sides agreed to return to the table sometime in the beginning of June. The political tension within the Israeli government is still high. Early last week, Prime Minister Rabin fended off a potential disaster which would cost him the m4jor religious party in Parliament, Shas, and the parliamentary majority. Shas withheld their resignation for a week, allowing Mr. Rabin to take action. They demand that M:r. Rabin dismiss the Minister of Education and Culture, Shulamit Aloni, who is also a secularist. She had remarked several times on religion and scri.pture, greatly offending Shas. territories in March took place this week. Two Israeli men and two of their Arab business partners were shot and killed by a passing car in the Gaza Strip In a very unusual announcement Hamas and the Palestinian Liberati.on Organization took joint responsibility for the incident saying it was in retaliation for the Army's shooting of Palestinian guerillas earlier this month. In a separate incident, Israeli troops kiUed two children during a clash between soldiers and local youths. The Israeli right represented by the Likud party continued to ~. ~~e~~f3 criticize the Labor-led left for : being weak on land 31~~~W\-~~] concessions. The leader of the Likud party, Mr. Netanyahu, made it clear that it would not support any land concession that gave up strategically important locations. A proposal by the Likud party said that they ·would not be bound by concessions made by the Labor government, and went further to say that they would take up arms to resist any effort to return the occupied territories.

The question of making money in the new Russian market was not addressed and left many of you wondering. One may ask himself how is it possible to survive in this new economical environment as jobs are so scarce, foodlines lengthen, and people are starving ( according to the American media). The answer to this problem of survival is simple: find those unfilled slots in the job market whether it corresponds to your diploma or not. One category of jobs does not hold much prestige in the college community. Obviously. after you have spent five years in college you do not want to waste all the knowledge you have gained. However, it becomes necessary to lower your standards due to the changing job market in the country. Sometimes it is just the only option you really have. Of course. being a secretary, hair dresser, shop assistants or a newspaper salesman is not a very respectable profession, especially if you were trained as an engineer. However, it could be much profitable than any non-existant position suitable for your degree. For instance, if you are an attractive woman, you need to take into account the possibility of becoming a secretary. A company might hire you and send you to a three months training program, but normally if the person has good hopes of obtaining the position the training is most likely paid with one's own means. However, in this latter case, there IS no assurance that you will be employed, CPAs undergo the same process as secretaries, although most new companies would rather send their own :present employees to learn bookkeeping. If the company has good financial stability and · deals with growing businesses, a person in a vocational position has the opportunity of earning five times more than a college professor. If you are a Liberal Arts major yo11 might be able to work as an independent tutor and the test way to succeed in this is to advertise yourself as an excelle11t teacher \successful in. dealing with younger children\.

•·' The Concordiensis Stressed by Eileen Colkin Science Editor 011e of the most commonly heard phr~tses among coHege students is that they-'re \SOOO stressed out\ and reas<Jnably so. Think about it. We've got ]Japers, labs, exams, love lives- the works. It's inevitable that students feel overwhelmed by life. However, there are occasions when ordinary stress builds up a11d'converts to ·~persistent anxiety\- a more serious condition that results from prolonged periods of stress. Anxiety is that moment in which a pers<Jn feels uneasy, worried, or afraid bec~use they believe there is some threat to their safety or well being. It's an ent,ir.ely normal response- just one of those human defense mechanisms. The anxi-ety response alerts us to impending danger and prepares us, both physically and mentally, to react in a way that will protec:t ourselves. It's when these feelrngs never go away that the condition can !be described as \persistent anxiety.\ The immediate physical responses to an::xi.ety are heavy breathing and increased heart rate, .dilated blood vessels~ and tensed muscles. The emotional responses include uneasiness, appreh.ension, and dread. Today there are many situations that can lead to prolonged anxiety responses- the demands of a stressful career, financial troubles, divorce, family prob-lems, etc. Over time, symptoms such as irritability. edginess, depressed mood, and varied physical complaints may result. While anxiety or tension assodated with the stress of everyday life does not require medical treatment. treatment may become necessary when symptoms become persistent and severe enomgh to change the way a person lives or th.eir quality of life. People tend to think of anxiety as a· \mental\ or .. emotional\ problem. H(}vrever, anxiety can effect both the bodyr as well as the mind. Therefore, persi.stent anxiety can produce a variety of symptoms both .physically and emotionally. Emotional symptoms inc l11de edginess, insomnia, excessive worry, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Physically, the syrnpt<>ms include rapid heartbeat, shalci.ness, chest pain, burning or upset storn;ach or stomach pain, headaches, difficulty breathing, and muscle aches and ]Jain. Mlllly of these symptoms are similar to those. of other diseases. In fact, its not uncornmon that a person believes they have some hideous physical disease whe11 their symptoms are that of persisteflt anxiety. It is only when a phystcal examination and medical tests reveal no physical disease that a doctor may suspect r;:fress to be the cause .. Still, Rose Condo.ms \ Tbanks to Planned Parenthood, coupRes can no longer complain that condoms \break the moment\. Female Students spoke optimistically that the ne~ Rose Condom' (a rose made of f()ur condoms), introduced at the Uni()n College Health Fair, may be the solution to kcepiflg the moment alive. \Exctlse me while I take a petal off of my rose,\ one student demonstrated using a French accent .

Not only that, but it is a condition that can be treated as soon as its diagnosed. So, what do you do if you think you have persistent anxiety? Obviously, the first step is to get to a doctor and check yourself eut. Depending on your medical history and symptoms, he or she may recommend a treatmeRt regimen that includes methods of .. chilling out\ changing your diet -its a bummer, but you gotta do it. One of the major dietary changes will probably be the elimination of caffeine, so pack up the Coke and pop open an OJ. Of course, exercise and a therapy course can also be recommended- including a support group that will help you cope with the source of the anxiety. Sometimes, there are medications available to help relieve the symptoms. Naturally. there are no \immediate\ cures for anxiety. Many of the methods used to treat stressed out people are gradual, as are the medicines that can be prescribed. It may take a week or two before you begin to feel the effects. However, there are few side effects and eventually the programs work. So, if you feel like your stress is more than just your everyday freaking out and may be something more serious, or if you think your are physically being effected by anxiety, see a doctor- it can only make things easier. Facts courtesy of Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals Health & Nutrition by Judith SheJdon THE WELL-BREAD SECRET: Bread is not, in and of itself, fatten- ing. As a matter of fact, bread, used properly in your diet, can contribute to both good health aad weight con- trol. Judi Adams, a registered dietician who heads the noaprofit Wheat Foods Council, said, \Our society spends more than $30 billion annually on a wide assortment of fat-fighting diet ,tools when aU it might take is a few extra trips down the bread aisle .... 1nhe secret of bread's success in weight control is carbohydrates. Bread and other .grain foods, such as pasta and cereal, are high in complex carbohydrates. When you increase the amount of carbohydrates in. your daily diet, you cut down the percent of calories that you would get from fat. Last year, the United States Department of Agriculture released the new Food Pyramid, which indi- cates the proper proportion of foods that should be eaten. daily to maintain good health. The suggested intake of grain foods was given as six to 11 servings each day. While that seemed to be an overwhelming amount of food, it's not that difficult, really, to satisfy the USDA • s su gges- tion, and still maintain your weight. The following is a list of suggestions from the Wheat Council that helps meet the daily requirements: * Eat at least two servings of com- plex carbohydrates at every meal. A serving would be a slice of bread, or a roll, or a half cup of pasta or cooked cereal, or half a bagel or muffin. * Snack on bread and grain foods. Try fresh bread, bread sticks, crack- ers, or pretzels. * Lighten up on your toppings, or (better yet) learn to eat your bread plain or use fruit jams, or low-fat spreads. FRESH FRUIT: Continuing with our series on how to buy and store fresh fruit. (Our thanks to the Lifetime Health Letter of the Univer- sity of Texas for the following infor- mation.) KIWIS: Especially high in vitamin C, and are a good source of fiber. When you buy, look for ftrm, plump fruit. Ripen at room temperature until the kiwi yields slightly to pres- sure, then refrigerate. NECTARINES: High in beta- carotene, and contain vitamin E and potassium. They·re also a good source of fiber. When you buy, look for medium to large, colorful, un- bruised fruit. Ripen at room tempera- ture until the fruit is yellow-orange and gives slightly to gentle pressure. Refrigerate and use promptly. PEACHES: .a source of fiber and potassium. When you buy, look for finn, colorful, unbruised fruit with a yellowish or cream background color. Ripen at room temperature until the fruit yields to gentle pres- sure. Refrigerate and use promptly. ~1993 by King Features Synd. FITZ HUGH LUDLOW DAY Sponsored by Fitz Hugh Ludlow Committee & Speaker's Forum Warm sun, entertainment, and free food, all the necessities a student could dream of, will be provided at Union College. What could be a better way to end Remiion Weekend and the school year than the fourteenth anniversary celebration of Fitz Hugh Ludlow Day. In 1979, Fitz Hugh Ludlow Day was founded by a group of Union College students who wanted to do something for Union rather than for themselves. A graduate of the class of 1856, a prominent literary figure and author of Union's Alma Mater, Fitz Hugh Ludlow thoroughly enjoyed Union and was extremely proud to have lived and learned here. This day is meant to create a sense of community by promoting interaction among the faculty, administration, staff and students. The gay is recognized every year in order to create a family environment, where diverse groups of the campus can come together to have a good time. Fitz Hugh Ludlow Day will be a non-alcoholic celebration of Union and it's students. There will be free food and entertainment from lpm-6pm on Sunday May 23rd.

Overall Greek Week was a success with beau- tiful weather trough Sattuday, when a sorority softball game was played beneath a rainbow war. The sisters of Gamma Phi Beta were the overall winners, followed by Delta Gamma. This Union tradition proved again to be a fun and successful competition for the Greeks on campus. that arched over the Nott Me- morial. The overall winners among fraternities were Sigma Chi, with Theta Delta Chi taking sec- ond place and Fiji placing third. The men participated in events such as the keg toss and keg roll, softball, the tug of war, volley- ball, and ultimate frisbee. Theta Delta Tau won the keg roll and the tug of war, while Fiji won the volleyball competition. The brothers and pledges of Sigma Chi won softball and Ultimate Frisbee to secure their victo- ries.

I \ 1 \j May 20, 1993 Rawstron and Cycling Club Excel at Penn State by Greg To.IDac Concordiensis Staff In the best outing for the cy- cling team to date, Jamey Rawstron ('93) led an attack by four breakaways to take the C category road race In the East- ern Collegiate Cycling Confer- ence Regional Championships. This was the first of <l\W-O stages being held at Penn State on May 1-2. With only 5 miles remaining of the hilly 30 rn ile race, Rawstron launched a searing attack on the course\s longest and toughest hill. Only three rac- ers were able to resp()nd to the change in tempo. A~; soon as they joined Rawstron~ the four worked together to fo1ge a one minute lead over the main pack. Pleased with their concerted effort, the four agreecl to cross the line together in a four-way tie, which they did wiith over a minute on the chasin~ pack. Up until Rawstrotn's attack, the race had been a sedate af- fair. Most of the damage had been done by the crnurse and heat as riders rode two loops around an undulating circuit containing four climbs. Each dimb took its toll as weaker rid- ers dtopped from the back of the pack Among those hanging Oil were Rob Goodwin ('93) and Rick Skoglund (93') - the rest of the Union contingent. Skoglund would loose contact towards the end of the first lap while Goodwin fought back se\ era! times to rejoin the peloton. Iron i- cafly, it was Rawstron's attack which pn'>ved Goodwin's undo- ing. He l1ad just bridged a gap to the remainder of the peloton when Rawstron's surge severed it further. He would come in just after th.e first group of chasers and barely out of the first 20. The following day's criterium saw riders doing 15 laps around a one mile loop. There was plenty of action in this circuit marked by a small rise, sharp turns and narrow sections. As riders funneled into the narrow sections there were several crashes - two of them perilously close to Goodwin. Union riders were spared from any road rash but m i sfort unc did not com- pletely escape them. Rawstron sw ffered a mechanical and was not able to finish. Ne\ erthekss.

Never- theless, they were amongst the lucky finishers in a criterium that saw much of the field pulled. It is unfortunate that the judges only picked out the top 20 places. If they had, the record would have shown this to be Union's strongest performance of the season. This race should be ex- cellent preparation for their next competition, the Electric C'ity Stage Race, to be held locally on May 29 - 30. FIJI Wins the '93 Volleyball Tournament by Lee Schacllter Associate Sports Editor This past weelkend, the Union College Beach Volleyball Tournament was held ;at the FIJI sand volleyball court. It was a lot of fun to watch, and the com- petition was fierce. The tourna- ment was being held simulta- neously with the end of Greek Week, so there were lots of sporting events to see this week- end. There was a me11's 2 on 2 tournament and a women's 6 on 6 tournament. It was :set up and run by Eric Glazer, Aaron Rees, and Stu Savage, and there was free barbecue and so•da: There was a large turnout to watch athletic talent at its IJ.est. The weekend started out with the women's tournament and six teams showed up for the event, which benefited Big ·Brothers/Big Sisters;. Sigma Delta Tau beat Delt;a Gamma and Gamma Phi Beta on their way to the finals, where they met the team from- Fox South. Fox South had beaten Delta Delta Delta to get to the finals . But on Sunday, Sigma Delta Tau · beat Fox South in an Lmpressive display to win the women's vol- leyball tournament. On the men's side of things, eighteen teams showed up to go for the gold- but at the end of the weekend, only one would re- main. Game after game was played, tile sweat continued to pile up, but when only four teams remained, they were the teams from Delta Phi, Phi Gamma Delta, Theta Delta Chi, and Al- pha Epsilon Pi. Delta Phi's play- ers were Dave Zemel and Joel Morrill, FIJI's rep res entati ve's were Jim Polites and Jim Willey, Sean Jorgensen and Scott Coughlin played for Theta Delta Chi, the defending champions, and Adam Kahn and Alex Bernstein were on the court for Alpha Epsilon Pi. To get there, Delta Phi had gone through Phi Delta Theta and a Fox South team, FIJI had defeated Beta Theta Pi and an- other Fox South team, Theta Delta Chi had beaten Delta Up- silon and Sigma Chi, and Alpha Epsilon Pi had taken care of Delta Psi Delta and a West Col- lege floor team. Once there, Delta Phi was paired with F.IJ1 to get into the finals, and Theta Delta Chi went up against Al- pha Epsilon Pi. The latter was the first game of the semi-finals, and Theta Delta Chi took down Alpha Epsilon Pi, 11-4. 11-l. In the second match-up, FIJI beat Delta Phi by a score of 11-8. 11- 8, to propel themselves into the finals against Theta Delta C'hi. So the stage was set. It was late Sunday afternoon, there was again a large turnout to see who the 1993 champions were going to be. The match was one which showed great athletic prowess on both sides of the net, and was very close as weH. Scoring a point was not easy. since both teams were defend- ing well on their opponent's serve. It was a game with a lot of setting and smashing. but at the end of the first game in the best. of three, FIJI won 15-13. The second game was fantastic as well, but FIJI took Theta Delta Chi out of their regular set-and- smash game plan and forced them to try to place, not smash. the ball over the net lll()re than they wanted. The second game ended with FIJI on top b) a score of 15-10, as they became the 1993 Volleyball champions. Congratulations, and good job to all the teams that participated in this year's tournament.

May 20, 1993, page B2 FEATURES The Concordiensis Poetry:An Ode.· Dear Uncle Edna An Ode to Beer Pong · BY Erin M. O'Neil Why can't girls play beer pong? Such a foolish, ridiculous rule. It's not fair- girls can't play beer pong, the official party game of the school. It's no fun to stand on the sidelines. Watching the boys have their fun. I could be just as good as them, if they gave me a chance, just one. Plink, plink, plink, plop, The melodious sound of the game. One down, two down, your serve, I know the rules, this is lame. Tell me, why can't girls play beer pong? I'm not talking an occasional tum. There's a fierce competitor inside of me. Any opponent I could burn. Female pong players unite. Raise your paddles up high and shout, \Death to male dominated beer pong!\ Guys will be watching us on the sidelines, it'll be their tum to pout. I'm gonna play some beer pong, just you wait and see. Next year at the tournament The winner won't beD-Phi, it will be me. Why Wait? - Michelle Rosenbaum Feature .s writer Do you ever realize how much our lives we spend waiting? Out of twenty four hours a day on average we wait at least one hour. What is waiting? To wait is to remain or expect something. We remain and expect things so many times in our lives. What are we really waiting for? Waiting did not begin in college. When we were young waiting was an even bigger part of our lives. Let's begin in elementary school. Remember waiting for your chocolate milk after giving in your 10 cents to get it. What about when you were the \chosen one\ to get the milk. you were chosen to wait on line! The worst was waiting on line to get a drink of water. No matter how thirsty you were you had to wait for the person in front of you. On the same note, when you had to use the \girls' room\ or \boys' room,\ you had to wait for the person who went to come back. Sometimes the person forgot to come back! You still had to remain in your seat. Expecting something came into play when we waited for recess or for the school day to end. If the class was bad we had to wait even longer to go· outside and play on the swings. We waited for the audience to quiet down before singing in our chorus concerts or performing our school play. Worst of all, we a1 ways had to wait for everyone to sit down on the bus before it began to move! As we grew older we constantly wait for similar things as we did in elementary school. We have to, however, wait for more. Whenever one goes to an amusement park, they should allow extra waiting on line time! If anyone has been to Six Flags Great Adventure, they know what I'm talking about! In order to get on more than six rides in one day, it is necessary to get to the park at ten in the morning. If you're planning to go on a sunny weekend bring a lot of money, because you'll get thirsty waiting on all the lines. Then again you'll have to wait on the line for food so you'll lose your place on the line for the ride and have to wait longer! The waiting never ends! Waiting for friends is something we all go through at least once a day. We've all made people wait before! Prom night, for example, either the girl waits for the guy or vice- versa! Simply going down to eat can be a waiting process. Even if it is just waiting for a friend to meet you downstairs. When you're hungry, waiting is horrible. It sometimes seems like hours when it's only seconds. Once in college it seems like we wait for everything! How many times have we had to wait to meet with professors when we have an appointment made? We've all experienced those two o'clock appointments which don't begin until two-thirty. Go to the Nautilus/weight room- the word says it all! The line to buy and return books could take an hour. The line at Dutch Hollow-shali I continue?

Have you considered joining the Uncle Edna fan club? Dear Uncle Edna, My girlfriend is transferring to another school next year. I am also going to be several thousand miles away in the Far East. We are still very much in love. What should we do? -F.O.S.M. DearFOSM, Stay together with your girlfriend. Go to the Far East. Date as many oriental woman as possible. Come home, look your girlfriend straight in the face and lie like a dog. Just . don't ever show her any of the sexual chopstick tricks you learned while on the trip or yell \Bonzai\ when you jump into bed Dear Uncle Edna, I was wondering if you could help me figure out why I have a wedgy every day of the week? What would recommend as a solution? -Up the Creek Dear Creek, The obvious answer is to refrain from wearing underwear. A less obvious solution would be to cut the crotch out and still wear it. An even less When you go to a movie, waiting in line for the ticket can get so annoying. Waiting for the phone call from the person you lik:e could drive you crazy. Call waiting-the word in itself explains it! Friendly's restaurant strives on making customers wait. Now the word wait probably means nothing to you after seeing it so many times. There are positive aspects to all this waiting. It gives you time to think before ycu \do.\ It may allow you to have time to read the paper, you thought you had no time to read. You can talk to a friend you haven't seen in days. Patience is the key. Be patient and wait a little bit. It's a major part of our lives which we can't get rid of completely! Write for than Elvis obvious solution would be to putty up the anatomy that's causing you .this problem._· Remember, crack or cracks can kill. Dear Uncle Edna, Last week Erin O'Neil wrote \Browse around, check out his nakedness ... you just can't lose\ Can't lose?!! How can anyone possibly take someone horne when they have no idea what kind of personality this guy has? Maybe we should make a catalogue for g.irls to shop around for the bod of her choice. -Scrawny Dear Scrawny, Hey that' catalogue idea is great! What section would Erin look for you under- 'Tools'? or 'Helmets'? Dear Uncle Edna, I did not appreciate the tirade of insults you bestowed upon me a few weeks ago in your column. I asked you for help and you gave me hurt. I'm not going to take this standing up. You just answered your last question, buddy. -Paul from Hastings Dear Paul, When did I just answer my last question? Keep reading- this is my third to last question. By the way, you don't have to take this standing up, I'll give it to you in whatever position is most comfortable. Dear Uncle Edna, I believe I saw Elvis today! He was standing outside of the college center. He had everything- the hair, the moves, even the gold chains. Rumor has it he's involved in one of those fraternity things- I think the ski-lodge one. People may not believe me but I hear he's wanted dead or alive and I need the money. I'm desperate. I need your advice. -Priscilla Dear Priscilla, Actually, The Weekly World News recently reported that Elvis was living in a love bungalo with Adolf Hitler and Jimmy Hoffa. If you're really that desperate and need money :that much- call me, we'll strike some sort of deal.

The Concordiensis A&E May 20, 1993, page B3 Corners of Introspection Musical by Jennifer Unterberg Contributing Writer \I loved it,\ Jen Aronson said while leaving the Nott, \I couldn't have loved it more.\ See it a second time, it's even better. I will admit, this was the first musical I had attended at Union College. My reluctancy to see performances in the Nott was not due to a pessimistic attitude on the quality of acting on this campus, but the mere fear that the Nott would collapse while I was in it (it doesn't look very sturdy). Let me tell you, if the Nott had to collapse on me, I would make sure that it would occur during a performance of \Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up\; that way I would be insured entertainment forever. \Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up\ directed by Alan Bryce, is a musical of outstanding quality. From the opening scene in which Eddie Ryan (performed by Gilda Corradi) enters the school he attended as a child, to the finale in which Eddie and Becky (performed by Katherine Wulfing) m,arry, the audience was held in a trance, captured by the beauty and. the believability of each of their performances. Through Eddie's eyes the child hood of four boys and four girls, growing up in a strict.catholic environment is reminisced. Musical numbers illuminate the many issues of growing up. For instance, \Does God Love Fat Girls Too,\ beautifully sung by Katherine Wulfing, displayed a young girl's insecurity about her physical image. \How Far is too Far\ (sung by Aimee Murdock, Bethany Stockholm, Dass Seaman, and Katherine Wulfing), and \Private Parts (sung by Scott Morrissey) hallmarked the beginning of \Strength\ by Jenni.le.r Drazen Review adolescence and its impending sexual tensions. The audience smiled throughout the entire performance, not . only entertained by the c hiildren and their expressions, but by the nuns. Sister Lee {portrayed by Kristy Holbrook) was a hit, u:Sing words such as \chicky\ to d~scribe Cindy Rothschild's statue ()lf the Virgin Mary(\I can assure you (;(]d wouldn't have chosen a pansy fm a mother)\. The nuns (Buffy Rube11stei11, Marla Kreiness, Kristy Ho1bmok, and Ericka Johnson) welfe hilarious during the 'nun jig' and Sister Lou{Ericka Johnson) ended the first act perfectly with a click of the heels. Confession scenes. coNtinued throughout the play, each confession funnier than the next. Between Louie( Ed ward Dorsey) following Depki' s (Neil Kanterman) advise on disguising his voice to fool Father O'Reilly, to Felix's (Sam Schneider) countless impure t~oughts, to Eddie's mortal sin of stealing money to buy a Pagan Baby, the audience was in hysterics. The tenderness of fhe musical rested in the love be-tween Eddie and Becky. From the first tirne they speak in the playgraund to the hospital scene on prom night, the chemistry between the tvr<J was felt. Many of the audiences· tyes were glossed with tears as Becky walked on stage in her wedding drEss. A well deserved standing ovation was given to the cast .at the end of the musical. Their performances were truly outstand::in~, the s.et design was excellent,. and the musical scenes were stupeadous! If only \Do Black Pa!tenit Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up\ could come out on video tape if would be entertained forever without being smooshed by the Nott. ]l1core! THE DEPARTM;ENTOF VISUAL ARTS AT UNION COLLEGE PRESENTS: \Corners of Introspection\ is on view at Union College in the Arts Building Atrium, May 24-May 28, 1993. Opening Reception: May 25, 1993, 4:00-5:30 pm. Refreshments will be served. The public is invited. Corners of Introspection is a progression of drawings, paintings, prints, sculpture, and architectural designs by Jennifer Drazen. Drazen's representational and abstract works examine her metaphorical and paradoxical juxtaposition of th~ \corner\ as a space of uncertainty and security. Her works invite the viewer to enter her reality and participate in her search for self- definition .and discovery. Drazen is presently a graduating senior at Union College and will be entering University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of ArchitectuTe this fall This exhibition is free and open to the public. Hurlyburly ,: A finale at Nott by David Hopson · Contributing Writer Colleges, like all other communities, inevitably undergo changes as time goes on. Indeed, the Union which we leave behind as Spring term draws to it's end is not the same Union to which we will return in the Fall. Granted, some of the changes are minor. For instance, it seems likely that neither the institution of the Vali-Dine system nor the withdrawal of a Freshmen's rights to have a car on campus will have a profound affect on the schools atmosphere. Although, other changes will be more difficult to overlook. For in three weeks, we will be forced to bid a fond farewell to the Nott as the home of Union College Theater. However, before the thespians take their residency in the Yulman Theater, the Nott will be graced with one last performance. Hurlyburly, a play by David Rabe and directed by Stacey Cervellino, will be performed on June 3rd, 4th, and 5th. Focusing on a group of Hollywood talent scouts, the play deals with the small yet infinite tortures of day to day life and the group's unsuccessful attempts to escape from them. But it is not merely another tragic indictment of life in the fast lane. Instead, it addresses concerns and problems which are common to everyone. For surely everybody has to some degree struggled to make themselves understood by a world which apparently has no interest in listening. It is exactly this point that director Stacey Cervellino hopes the audience will realiZL'. Cervellino, who is directing the play for he-r Senior project, believes that \the play has a lot to do with our Jives at Union. Of course, the problems experienced by the characters are exaggerated, but they have a lot in common with the typical Union student. Here, peopk• are just as invested in the images they produce as the stereotypical Hollywood talent agent would be. And when they are unable to carry that image to the level we want, we often try t<J escape through one 'outlet or another, wether it be through violence or sex or alcohol or drugs.\ Lastly, it is important to note the strength and confidence which the cast brings into the production. Their task of conveying a group of people plagued and hardened by their loneliness and desperation is successful, which is even more noteworthy considering the number of talents who come newly to the stage. HURLYBURLY. Written by: David Rabe. Directed by: Stacey Cervellino. Production Stage Manager: Walter Soule. Starring: Bill Callahan, Fran DeAngelo, Mike Ezra, Hallie Heller, Jonathan Quint, Stephanie Richter, and Cindy Rothschild. Performance on June 3-5 in the Nott Memorial at 8:00 PM. Tickets wi11 be on sale for $3.00 in the college center starting on May 31st. CHET's CoRNER Chet's Corner This will be a ·very busy week for all you Chet's goers so get ready.

Alumni Council Candidates Announced Elissa Katz: To the Seniors: For those of you who do not recognize my picture, I am Elissa Katz, and I have decided to run for a position as an Alumni Council Representative for the Class of 1993. Throughout my four years at Union, I have been involved in numerous clubs and' activities. This year I have been active as a co-chair of Gatekeepers, captain of the Women's Tennis Team, a member of both the Student Athletic Committee and the Environmelltal Society, and an Ambassador. In my past years at Union, I have been editor of the Freshman Record, co-chair of the Social Committee, a meru ber of the programming board and film committee, and a disc jockey. Through participation in these activities, I have come in contact witb many administrators~ faculty, staff, and students. This has given me the ability to kllow who to contact and where to go to follow through with other commitments and activities. RATZ by BEN SMITH Last winter term r went on a term abroad with the Sea Education Association. This is a private academic institution and each class elects an alumni representative. I was chosen to be the representative for my class. My duties include keeping in contact with my class and ship mates through letters and phofle calls. I act as a liaison between my class/ship-mates and the main office writing and sending newsletters twice a year updating everyone's whereabouts and happening. Throughout our years here we've seen a number of improvements; the opening of Chet's, Fero House, and the breaking of ground for Yulman Theater. As an Alumni Council Representative, I hope I can encourage more positive changes for the students at Union College; and plan great parties for reunions to come! VOTE ELISSA KATZ. THANK YOU! Roxanne Schneider As we count down the days until graduation many different ~ 1 \NS'I'Ql> OF ~R ARf.IS ~lt.ITIN6 AT 1ll6 \\'~, rrs \EI< LEGS. sentiments can be heard. The on~e that comes as most surprising to me is, \Once I leave, I will not be coming back, giving money, or thinking about Union..\ Although this statement may hold true for some seniors, it does not for me. I have always held to the pht:ase, \Leave it better than it was when you came,\ and I have attempted to do that here in my years at Union. Through the different facets of campus I have become involved in (including the Orientation Committee, Student Forum, Admissions, Peer Facilitators, S.P.A.A., the Political Science Department, Dining Services, and the Greek System), I have found how much those students before us enabled us to have what we have and to do what we want to do. I do feel as if I have attempted to make this a better place than it was when we came, yet there is still more work to do. I am running for the position of Alumni Council Representative for the Class of 1993, because I feel it is important for the future classes of Union to have alumni supporting them as we have had alumni supporting us. The Alumni Council can and does a great deal to improve Union and to improve student life. As we have seen, sometimes the student voice is not enough, but wit11 the alumni voice the student pleas become stronger. It is important to have alumni there for the sttidents, and I will be one of them. I would also like to see to it that the administration sticks to all it has promised and all ,that has been achieved. We have worked hard for many things in our years here, I however would like to continue working to ensure that all we have done and wiH do continues to make an impact, and to ensure that the future students of Union have a voice backing them as well. I would appreciate your support and vote on Friday! Lara Chamberlain As an active member of our Senior class, I am interested in continuing my involvement with Union. As recent graduates, it is important that we exert our alumni influence and I will see to it that we hav~ our ideas represented on Alumni Council committees. Furthermore, I will facilitatr communication both between class members and between the class and the College throughout the five-year position. - Joe Pecora I am writing to ask you for your vote in the class of 1993 Alumni Council elections. The Alumni Council represents the interests of Union College alumni. There are three positions available for our class. As an Alumni Council representative for our class, I well make sure that our interests are expressed adequately to the council. We have invested a great deal of time and money into Union College. Let us make sure that Union College maintains its level of prestige. One must remember that Union College always wiU reflect upon us. Thank you for your consideration. ·Good Luck To All Candidates By Leigh Rubin Not surprisingly, Pin-the-Tail- on-the-Inflatable-Donkey never received the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.

May 20, 1993, page B8 ANALYSIS The Concordiensis Post-Cold ar Realities by Cole Timmerman Contributing Writer There ru;e times in the world when the affaits of man come to a cross roads. Such times require decisive leadership, bold action, knowledge of priorities, and above all else conviction. Metternich of ·the Austro- Hungarian Empire used political, religious, social, and military pressures to stabilize the European landscape after the ravaging campaign's of Napoieon. Roosevelt, Churchill and Stal-in combined their people's power to defeat the dark ambitions of Hitler's Nazi Germany and the expansion of Japan. Lastly, the bold actions of United States Presidents from Truman to Bush reduced the spreading influence of communism. Now the world's political landscape is again in transformation. The prospects of a stable peace among the world natioms has never been closer. However, as close as t:1i~ .peace may be, large complex hatreds and animosities rem~in. Time is running out. For all their iaternai probl-ems, R us~ia and its partner republics still posses a formidable stockpile of nuclear warheads, aocurale ICBMs, and huge arsenals of conventio11al weapons. Behind the array of fledgling parliaments and elected presidents, there stil·l hides dangerous men in high places who harbor imperial ambitions for their nations. Such men should be watched, not ignored. Western European nations struggle with protectionism and nationalistic interests are slowing down the process of free trade. Now the the prospects .of a protectionist tide and a global trade war are increasing. The lines are being drawn: Japan and the \Little Dragons\ North Am~rica, and VI ~tem Europe centered around the German industrial giant. Such a trade war would only plunge the world deeper into recession and further shake the financial markets. Asian nations are rapidly ,acquiring modern arms to complement their mighty economic power. The easy availability of weapons makes a 'build up hard to .stop. It can only be matched by keeping U.S. forces in the region. In the aftermath of the Fersian Gulf War, the tentative stability of the region has been shattered\ With Iraq economically devastated and militarily damaged, Iran is blooming as a regional power. With Iter weapons and America's deep seated hatred for Iraq, no president could rally Western forces to counter an Iranian i11cursion into Iraq. The smoldering fires of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina threaten to engulf the region, if not the world. A torrent of refugees bound to, or in Northern Europe and Western Europe are setting off ethnic and nationalistic feelings. Here the American military machine cannot, and should not be used to win a military victory, for one cannot be won at a reasonable cost. However, America and her allies can use their weapons and weapon stockpiles to give the Muslims a fighting chance to stave off the spectra of genocide. The Presidency of the United States net only entails the leadership of th~ great nation but the leadership of the West, the leadership of the indust:Iiialized free world. In that seat sits a man who is caving under the pressure. During his campaign :he attacked President Bush on ~is lack of a policy in Yugoslavia, now Mr. Clinton is backing away from his promises. At · home he promised a tax cut to the middle class and now he is hinting and in fact about ·to deliver one of the biggest tax increases in history. -His stimulus package was defeated by the Senate without a fight, his new jobs bill is about to he destroyed Finally the centerpiece ofillis promises and his campaig11~ a revamped health Care system is now fading. As Mr. Clinton realizes how rn uch ~he plan will cost he bacls away again. Mr. Clinton, during his campaign, pr(}fessed that he knew little abollt foreign affairs and that domestic policies were his forte. If this is his forte the world will have to turn from America and look for a new leader. But a strategy must be enacted or the .challenges of the post-cold war world will overwhelm mankind. 19 ~93 Varsity Letter Winners 94 Acquarulo 95 Ahrens 96 Alaspa 95 Albert 96 Allaire 94 Anderson 95 Anderson 96 Anderson 93 Aron 96 Attah 94 Aurora, Jr. 95 Baker 94 Baldwin 93 Bang 94 Battiston 95 Baumgartner 96 Beland 95 Ben-Ezra 93 Benker 96 Bernardo 93 Bernstein {mgr.) 94 Bevan 93 Boulanger 94 Bovardi 95 Bowden 96 Boyce {mgr) 96 8oyd 93 Bradford 95 Brown 93 Brundage 95 Brustolon 94 Callahan 95 Carrpbell 93 Carlin 96 Chase 94 Chiu 94 Chodosch 93 Chudy 93 Clearfield 94 Cianci 96 Comley 95 Coote (mgr.) 96 Corley 95 Richitelli 96 Riley 96 Riley 93 Robison 96 Rock 95 Rose 93 Rosenfeld 95 Rotkiewicz 95 Rozwadowski 96 Rudin 94 Ruggeri 96 Russell 95 Rutherford 93 Sachs 95 Saltz Lewis Jennifer Ryan Christopher Jennifer Mk:hael Julie Stacey Jonathon Frank John Jason Jennifer Jonathon Steven .Matthew Nicole Gary Julie Michael Jill Kelly Cort Keith Scott Philip Scott Timothy Jennifer Bradford Michele William Kristen McKeough Kenton Alexander David Brendan Joseph Charles Shannon Mark Scott Jason Christopher Charred David Heather Scott Jonathan Stephen Anne Seth Joseph Adam Eugenia Robyn Erica 94 Cortes 94 Cusic 95 Dagostino 95 Darby 94 Darby 96 Davidson 96 Davis 93 Dolan 94 Donigan 95 Draizin 94 Drumm 93 Duckett 96 Duffy 95 Durocher 96 Dybas 93 Eberhart 95 Elsing 96 Eldh 96 Elfenbein 94 Ernst 94 Evans 94 Evans 92 Evans 96 Fanning 92 Farnan 96 Fehr 95 Filosi 96 Fishbein 93 Fisher 93 Fitch 96 Fitzgerald 93 Fitzhenry 94 Flowers 93 Flynn 94 Foster 95 Galla11t 95 Gauntt 93 Gelder 93 Gerstenzang 93 Girardi 96 Goldberg 95 Goldfine 95 Garfinkel 94 Saltzbart 95 Savage 94 Schmitter Schwarz 96 Sealfon 96 Sealfon 96 Seymour 93 Shaw 96 Shelov 95 Sheridan 94 Sidel 95 Silvestri 93 Simkins 93 Simmons 96 Simon Kevin Stephen Dave Keith Kevin Jennifer Julie Greg James Allison Paul Thomas Brad Kate Matthew Ross Leigh John Ron James Kenneth Steven Jason Kimberly James Megan Nadine Jason Timothy Nathan John James Jayson David Allison Michael Heather Bret Robert Andrew Elan a Rachel Carrie Joseph Stewart Matthew Andreas Seth Seth Linda Clifford Danielle Marc Ted Nicole Lori Peter Jonathan 95 Goulet 96 Grandwetter 93 Grillon 9!5 Haines 95 Haines 93 1-laU 9S Halliday 96 Hancock 93 Harrington 94 Harris 94 Harrison 96 Haver 96 Hayashi 94 Haydock 95 Heffernan 95 Heller 94 Hill 96 Hirschman 93 Holbrook 95 Holbrollgh ·96 Holunga 95 Horst 93 Howell 95 Hawk 94 Humphreys 96 Hunter 93 Hussar (mgr) 95 Hyman 96 lngis 95 Irving 95 Ivanyi 94 Jiampetti 93 Johnson 95 Johnson 96 Johnson 95 Johnston 96 Kaminski 96 Kanders 93 Katz 95 Kelley 96 Kessinger 94 Kessler 94 Kleinhaus 9& Simonton 94 Smith 93 Sodergren 95 Solom<lS 95 SouthiNortil 95 Spenello 94 Spritzer 93 Steele 96 Stern 95 StoHer 913 Strarn 96 Strack: 94 Swiecicki 96 TarabCJrelli 94 Teasdale Dean David Joy Joshua Joshua Sabra Susan Christopher Dawn Brian Gregory Jamie Eri Paul Marcie Hallie David Allison Kristen Cory Shane Adam Megan Stephanie William Andrew Robert Evan Elizabeth Chris Julie Jeffrey Michael Robert Matt Deanna Lorene Reinis Elissa Matthew Amy Mi11dy Micllelle Reid Byron David Nicole Georgia Diana Blaira Gregory Matt Chad Russell Patrick Christopher Christina Sarah 96 Klopfer 96 Knight 96 Kobayashi 96 Krochmal 96 Kukko 94 Kurz 96 Kussy 93 LaSara 94 LaBonte 94 Lainez, Jr. 93 Laing 98 Lamphere 95 Landa 98 Lann 96 Lazauskas 96 Lading 94 Lent 93 Levantis 93 Lewis 95 Uebhoff 94 Ught 96 Logan 93 Logan 95 Lombardo 95 Lombardoni 93 Lucy 96 Lunlanski 96 MacDonald 95 Maguire 96 Mahan 93 Maher 95 Manna 96 McCarte 95 McCarthy 94 McCloskey 93 Mcintyre 96 Meade 94 Mala 96 Mendelson 96 Metz 96 Metz 94 Miller 96 Miner 95 Tellez 95 Terrell 93 Trevisani 95 Troy 93 Turri 93 lworrbly 96 Vallee 94 Vargas 95 Vernon 9S Villa 93 Volterra 95 Von Sahet 93 Walker 93 Wallon 95 Weedmark Steven James Tsuyoshi Aaron Brad Casey Liz Natasha Chad Marco Susan Amy Elizabeth Matt Chelsea Mike C.

Josef Schmee Receives Sharpe Chair of Management by Michelle Ellis Professor Schmee is a very Contributing Writer active member of the Union College community and an asset to this institution. He On May 21, the Trustees and President Hull appointed Professor Josef Schmee as the first Kenneth B. Sharpe Chair of Management recipient. Professor Schmee was recommended to receive this honor by the Dean of Faculty. The Kenneth B. Sharpe Chair in Management was recently established at Uni0n through the generous gifts of Sharpe, who is an alumni from the class of 1943. Sharpe is chairman of the board of Sharpe manufacturing Company, which is the country's leading manufacturer of spray paint guns. Ken Sharpe, an extremely successful entrepreneur, has built a productive and lucrative company, and is acknowledged as the leader of this field. Sharpe's company also competes successfully with overseas competition. His participation as an alumni in Union's development is very appreciated and valued. received his Ph.D. in Administrative and Engineering Systems from Union in 1974. He has had numerous publications recognized by professional societies. He was elected an honorary Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 1982, with special attention to his sequential estimation research. He is the director of the Writing Board at Union and has directed the graduate Management Institute. He has served as a faculty trustee and as chair of both the faculty Review Board and the Planning Priorities Committee. In recent years, he worked at General Electric as a visiting research scientist for corporate research and development. Speaking with Professor Schmee in person, one can understand why he was selected to receive this honor. He briefly expressed his appreciation of his installation as the holder of the ,chair; however, he did not discuss his accomplishments, which made this honor possible. Instead, Schmee discussed the important implications behi11d Sharpe's gift and the significance that his success should have upon students graduating with a liberal arts education. He stated that students wiU be invited to next year's. Ken Sharpe seminars at Unio11, and they should take advanttge of this opportunity. Union will be strengthening their grad\:Jate 's potential for success by providing them with a series of lectures which will give them an edge in the business 'World that they can most defi11itely utilize. Schmee stated, \Students will learn that :small businesses are the liveliha-od of the American economy. Big businesses are shrinking, where as small businesses are growing. Small businesses need generalists, not specim.ists and these careers welcome liberal arts college graduates.\ Schmee stated that Sha1pe 's cont. on J)g. 2 t- i I· t .{ .. Photo by Brianna Patnode Abzug Fights For Women's Rights. ReUnion Weekend Festivities by Karen Hamilton CoTJtributlng Writer .Bella ·Abzug addressed the Union College community on Monday., May 24. She spoke about the need for equal tights and representation for women and minorities. Abzug was born in the Bronx on July 24. 1920, the same year that woman won the right to · vote. This was a prelude to how Abzug's -life would take shape. Abzug started her leadersltip roles as early as h~gh school, where she was elected· class president at Waiton High School. After high school she attended Hunter College, w.-.ere she was president of tbe college's student council. Abzug then attended Columbia University Law School, where she became the editor of the Law Review, the University's news letter. After graduation from law school, Abzug devoted her life to the equal rights movement. In 1970, she ran for a seat in Cong;re.ss. Her slogan exclaimed, \This woman's , place is ·in the H9use • the House of Representatives. ' 1 After the election she became the first woman elected to Congress on a woman's rights/peace platform. Since bet election to Congress, Abzug has become known world wide as a \champion of women's rights and reproductive freedom.\ Presently Abzug she has been elected to be the first Cp-Chair of the National Women's Political Caucus, where· she continues to fight for equal rights and representation. During her talk at Union, Abzug covered women's rights topics such as abortion, health care and overall reproductive rights of both men and women. Abzug's hope is for equality of women, especially in th~ political arena as well as in the health care perspective. As it stands now, only 11% of politicians. in office are women. ,Although Abzug•s main thrust is feminism, she also remembers to recognize people of other minorities. It is her goal that women and minorities get equal representation in our . government. cont. on pg. 3 by Caroline Paille News Editor On Saturday. May 22, alumni flocked on campus to participate in ReUnion 1993. The festivities of the day regan with a parade of the classes starting at the Arts Building and working its way around campus, past Bailey Field and concluding on Nott Field in front of the Nott Mell1orial. Each class having a reunion wore costumes indicative of the era from which they gradi{Jated. The participants marched to the music of a local bagpipe corps and high school mar.(:hing band. Upon the conclusion of the parade, the alumni mi,grated to Schaffer Library Plaza, where the Alumni ConvO<:ation was held. Jerry Thurston, '61, presiding as Master of Ceremonies, reminded the audience of what a wottderful place our college is. \I tis very hard not to be enthusiastic, even passionate, abomt this special place.\. After his welcome, Thurston introouced Norton Reamer '.58., the Chairman of the Bo:.rd of Trustees, who extended Thurston's welcome to the graduating class of 1993. He made the graduating class aware of their responsibilities as near future alumni. Reamer voiced how he hoped the class of '93 would carry on the tradition of \loyalty and devotion\ to the college that the present alumni share. The extreme pride in Union that Reamer spoke of was demonstrated by Frank Messa, '73, chairman of the Terrace Council, as he gave an update of the 81st Annual Fund. The college is 70 percent near completion to its 3 million dollar goal through alumni support. Messa sighted that out of all the colleges in the United States only 25 of ·them have support from 50 percent of their alumni; Union College is proudly among them. Yet Messa urges the present alumni and graduating seniors to give all they can, 50 percent is wonderful, but he would like to see 100 percent alumni support for Union College. After Messa spoke Jon Barr, Commander, Navy Recruiting Command, spoke to remember those who not only supported the college, but also their country. Commander Barr commended the 3,500 Union studellts who participated in the V-5 and V-12 programs at the college during World War II. A plaque was presented to the school in recognition of the V- 5 and V-12 's 50th anniversary of being instated at Union. Along with the World War II veterans. three other alumni and one faculty member were recognized for their contributions to the college. Joseph D. Goldreich '45. Chesler M. Sawtelle '32 and R. Theodore Vinick '43 received Alumni Gold Medals for their service to Union a-; alum n i. Also Professor Charles M. Tidmarcll. of the Political Science Department. received the Faculty Meritorious Service award. With the conclusion of awards presentation, President Hull addressed the alum11i. He congratulated the V -12 veterans and saluted the Class of 1943. who were also having their 50th ReUnion. President Hull described his pride in the tremendous show of financial sup.port this past year. He revealed his plans to begin renovating the Nott Memorial as soon as the funding permits. The president explained that he cont. on pg. 3

May 27, 1993, page 2 NEWS The Con~ordiensis 23rd Annual Business Campaign Studen,t FGrllm Spotlight ¥ear In Review Courtesy of Charlie Casey Union College Public Relations ------------ Union College's 23rd Annual Business Campaign (ABC) is planning to raise $150,000 in support of scholarships to help promising local students attend Union, it was announced recently by Thomas Maggs and Thomas Zack, campaign co- chairmen. \This financial aid is critically necessary because the College follows a policy of admitting all qualified students without regard to need, promising that a package of scholarships, loans and work programs, as necessary, will make it possible for them to meet expenses.\ said the chairmen, partners of Maggs and Zack, The Business Insurance Brokers, at 501 State Street, Schenectady. \We feel strongly that the ABC Scholarship is one of the College's very best initiatives, helping young people coming out of our own high schools,\ Maggs and Zack said. \Also we are convinced that Union is a unique asset. one of our nations finest small colleges is a neighbor we tend to take for granted.\ Last year's ABC Scholarships provided support for seven local students to attend Union. Gifts and grants account for about 10 percent of the College's income. At the same time, student aid covers 12 percent of expenses. The Annual Business Campaign ends on June 30. Besides Maggs and Zack, members of the executive committee of the 23rd Annual Business Campaign are Philip Arony, vice president, Private Banking Group, Key Bank of New York; William Bates, partner. Lewis, Kaehler, Bates, Angle, Jones and Cioffi; Kevin Bette, partner, Columbia Development Group Inc.; Vincent Debaun, director of corporate and foundation support, Union College; Bruce Schmee Awarded cont. from pg. 1 success as a liberal arts graduate, which is magnified by his donation of a chair in his name, should convey to the student body an awareness of small business· enterprise· s potential for success in the future. Schmee's position on the writing board also reflects firm support for writing skills in Union students. Schmee stated that writing is essential for the business world today and in the future. In the eighties, business was conducted by telephone however, in the nineties, writing is the convenient form of communication. due to the popularity of fax machines. Schmee expressed his belief that the students who can communicate their ideas briefly and clearly will be preferred over those who can not. Clearly, Schmee' s involvement in strengthening Union's students writing abilities reflects his intention to better prepare students for business careers. Schmee's insight and experience in teaching the operations of the business world are valuable to Union, and he clearly exemplifies the type of faculty member who will receive the Kenneth B. Sharpe Chair in the future.

By Alexan<ler Sklavos \Ex\ Student Forum President This year saw a lot ofchanges, but let us start with this week. !We have been talking a l()t lately about the Vali-Dine system. ~ost recently we have been discussing the location of .the new jconvenience store. After a lot of p-ros and cons, we recommended ltllat the convenience store be put on the third floor of the College !Center, along with the videostoreand arcade. One of the Forum's chief ()bjecti. ves this year was totJe 'in touch with the students so we can do exactly what they want us to. The • \Town Meetings\ started in lhe Fall were the offspling of that ()bjective. The \Mentor Program\ is a direct result •~nf the first ·Town Meeting. I truly hope that next year's Forum wiJI continue · efforts to communicate with the students. The Forum continued to supp<ut Chet's in the Fall, and then created the Chet's committee. This social alternative, created by last year's Forum, has improved by leaps and bouu~s. It has a!most everything any other bar has; beer, liquor, a handsome , Greek bartender, music, and hot wings. All it really needs to do now is accept the Vali-Dine card for pitchers. In the Spring we wanted .to target a weekend and pack it full of ·events. May 14, 15, and 16 was perfect. The Fiji volleyball ·tournament, Greek Week, an orcllestral concert, and ·:a play were already scheduled. The Forum atided fireworks on Ftida·y night, . and collaborated with Fiji to spo.nsor an all-campus :picnic that was tremendous. There was also.a mini- carnival wHit booths by CDC, SDT, the StudeRt Forum, J.S'.U., and S.A.D.D. The profits were given to charity. Although the carnival w11sri~t huge, everyone had a good time, and it has a lot of potenti.al for next year. I~m not going to go over everytlling the Forum wmked on, but all in all it was a very good year. Thank you to evezyone on the Forum, and to Lee Bloomros:en, Mrs. Marra, and Mrs. Clark.

Turf Replaced on Bailey Field by Heather Manley Concordiensis Staff After 12 yeru::s of.use,_Unjon College is replacing the astra- turf and track on Bailey Field. The track and turf were originally installed in 1981 with a life expectancy of eight years. According to Richard Sakala, Director of Athletics, after four extra years of use, it is due for replacement. The project, scheduled for completion by the Balsam Company on July 10, 1993, involves removing all the old turf and replacing it with an improved astro-turf product. Tlle fonner pad was made of polyethylene, according to Sakala. The new pad is an E- Layer system that allows for more cushion. Salcala also explained that the current field is crowned, higher in the middle to allow the water to drain off to the sides. While the new turf will still rely on , the cr.owned shape f<Jr - drainage, it will allow the surface water to drain down through the system. The new field will not have the traditional block U in the center of the field. Salcala explained that repainting tiJe u each year makes the surface . abrasive. which has ca11sed complaints. Instead, a garnet block \Union\ will be spelled out in each end zone. After approaching Sakala. the brothers of Phi Delta Theta became the proud owners of :the U that was removed from 'the old field.

. May 27, 1993,. page 4 NEWS ANALYSIS The Concordiensis Memorial Day: A Time For Celebration by Veronica Rogers News Analysis Editor This upcoming weekend is the last weekend before final exams, before seniors enter their last two weeks of college existence, and one of the last chances for people to spend time bonding with others who made this year so memorable. In conjunction with memories, this weekend commemorates an important part of history that Union does not celebrate. Memorial Day, or Decoration Day, has been an intricate part of America's History since the Civil War days. When we were kids, Memorial Day weekend meant that we had Monday off, one more day to sleep late. Now, here at Union, the holiday doesn't even give us the privilege of missing classes for the day. I am not complaining about the college's policies, I _ am noticing how strange it is that a holiday 1hat signifies so much for the generation before us, can be forgotten just because we have to go to classes. That shouldn't happen. Whether a soldier in a battle, or an innocent victim of cruelty, remembering who has died brings out our simple instinctual feelings of compassion and an overall unification within the human race. This culminates on the day designated for that purpose. Usually Memorial Day is celebrated (an oxymoron of sorts) by having parades and memorial services. The ct;lebrators are brought together by one common theme, death. It seems as though the relatives, friends, and random civilians, however, are not merely taking note ·of the loss of life .. Instead people are remembering the bravery, courage and loyaltv displayed by those who have died. Our generation has only experienced war th]jough the Persian Gulf War. This was a scary time because I had never known what it felt like to watch a war unfold in front of my eyes (or through. the media). Besides feeling empathetic, there is no way for us to really feel what the generations .before us have felt for tile loss of those around them. To make note of what once (in this case regarding Memorial Day) usually constitutes as remembering simple facts like dates, pe<>ple involved, number of casualties, and other small elements. I think people fail to recognize some .other important aspects of how the events honored have affected us. Including the Civil War there have been around 980,969 battle and othe:r military deaths from all the subsequent conflicts [not including Persian Gulf War]. The major wars included in this census are the Civil War in RETURN TO: Reference Desk, Schaffer Library STUDENT PERIODICAL..SURVEY 1993 Schaffer Library, Union College , 1861-65; Spanish- American War in 1898; World War I in 1917-18; World War II in 1941- 46; the Korean Conflict in 1950-53; and the Vietnam Conflict in 1964-73. Although almost reaching a mil'lion deaths is' a fascinating fact, it should not 'be viewed as the most noteworthy aspect of why we .. celebrate\ Memorial Day. More significantly is the impact of the previously mentioned wars on our nations history. These major events are the catalysts for change in our continuing evolution, therefore Memorial Day shouldn't only be to remember the dead. The clashing betwe·en the complex desires of the human mind, and the simplicities of natme (all humans are created equal) continues to be the basis for unrest among .people of the world. The difference in outcome for any of the major wars would have changed the course of the RETURN BY: June 10 ~ The library is considering exchanging some of its current periodical subscriptions for an expanded • interlibrary loan/ document delivery service.

It is scary to think what would have happened if people such as Hitler remained in power for more time than he did. Of course this would be unlikely becaqse he was a crazy tyrant, but the possibility did. exist. Maybe we should feel lucky that our nation still remains a ,powerhouse. We ·could be a communist country with almost no freedom trying all of our lives to defect. Memorial Day should not be to mourn, but rather it should be considered a time to say thanks to those courageous soldiers who risked their lives in the name of patriotism and loyalty. By doing so, they kept our nation together so that today we can continue to live free by our constitution. Seniors: 16 Days Till Graduation!

The Concordiensis SCIENCE AND HEALTH May 27, 1993, page 5 e eeko utrition Grab A Salad U.S. Dept. of Health·and Human Services Did you know that eating salads can be . an important part of staying healthy? Leading health authorities recommend that everyone .should eat a diet low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables. The US Department of health and Human Services, the US Department of Agriculture and the National Academy .of Sciences recommend eating at least S servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Salads are an easy way to have one Qr more of these 5 daily servings. Adding lots of fruits and vegetables to a salad creates a healthy alternative , to high fat foods. Fruits and vegetables are important sources of vitamins A and C and fiber; most are naturally low in fat, calories, and sodium and have no cholesterol. Diets high in fruits and vegetables may also help reduce the risk of cancer. What is a serving? One serving is 112 cup of fruit or cooked vegetable, or 1 cup leafy greens, or 1/4 cup of dried fruit. It is important to note that eating one large salad could provide many sewings. Keep your salad healthy and low in fat. Many people have already started eating more salads. However, they often add items which reduce a salad's health benefits. Ingredients and toppings such as most regular type salad dressings, mayonnaise, and oils contain fat and should be used sparingly. Croutons, olives, avocado, fried noodles, nuts, and .crumbled bacon are hidden sources of fat which should be limited. Remember to choose carefully your dressing and the amount of it you use each time. Each tablespoon of regular type salad dressing triples a salad's calories, approximately 90% of which are from fat. And one ladle equals 2-3 · tablespoons! Five points about salad for better health:: ·Maximize your salads by adding more . fruits and vegetables to them. -Choose healthier, low fat salad ingredients. -Use low fat, reduced calorie dressings. -Eat salads more often and at any time of the day. -Select a mixture of leafy greens for y0ur .salad, preferably the darker ones. Finally, Dress for success tips: -Too much dressing defeats the pwpose of a low fat salad. . Try to dress your salad with only two tablespoons or choose a reduced calorie dressing. -Fruit juices, flavored vinegars, and herbs make dressings flavorful without adding fat or salt. -For guilt- free creamy dressings, use buttermilk or lower fat yogurt and add reduced calorie mayonnaise sparingly to thicken it. -For a tangy fruit salad topping, try non fat or low fat yogurt like vanilla or lemon. All of these tips should make for a healthier and more fun diet, so get to the garden and EAT YOUR VEGETABLES!!! Health & Nutrition by Judith Sheldon MAGNESIUM THE MAG- NIF1CENT: No,that'snotthename of a magician, but rather reflects the way researchers increasingly feel about this mineral as they learn more about the various roles it plays in maintaining good health. The cover story in the May 1993 issue of the University of Texas Lifetime Heal'th Letter deals with some of the known, as well as potential benefits of this mineral. For example: Heart Attacks: Magnesium treat- ment at the time of a heart attack has been shown to reduce deaths by one fourth. Continued magnesium treat- ment for one month following a heart attack cotttinued to show decreased incidences of heart failure. High Blood Pressure: Studies show that a deficiency of magnesium may contribute to high blood pres- sure. Magnesium supplements or in- travenous magnesium therapy can lower blood pressure. This may be due to magnesium·s ability to relax constricted blood vessels. Diabetes: Daily magnesium sup- plements given to adult-onset diabetics with high blood pressure resulted in a significant drop in blood pressure levels to normal range. Osteoporosis: One study shows that taking magnesium along with a calcium supplementation increased bone mineral density for postmenopausal women on estrogen therapy. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: After being given magnesium sulfate in- jections for six weeks, CPS patients reported more energy, less pain, and a generally improved emotional state. Food sources include whole wheat breads and pastas, brown rice, dry beans, seeds, nuts, leafy green vegetables (spinach, kale, chard) and oatmeal. To reduce loss of mag- nesium in cooking, use minimal water, and shortest cooking time possible. A VOTRE SANTE! To your health. That's what the French say when they offer a toast. Scientists who have puzzled over the ability of the French to withstand high in- cidences of heart disease despite a cuisine that relies heavily on high fat dairy products, now think the French fondness for red wine may be the .reason. Pourquoi? Because of its phenols. These chemicals, which give the wine its color, are also an- ·tioxidants like vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene, They clean up free radicals, and inhibit the oxidation of LDL - the ••bad .. cholesterol - which reduces the risk of coronary artery damage.

Ask Dr. Lamb by Dr. Lawrence E. Lamb HOW CAN SHE MAKE FAT STOMACH FLAT? DEAR DR. LAMB: I need help. I am a 49-year-old woman and never had this prot.lem before. My stomach is getting fat. It feels like a pocket of fat from one side of my body to the other. It bothers me when I put my dotltes on and when I bend, sit or walk. When I wear something around my waist, it hurts. Do you know what I can do to get rid of this uncomfortable and miserable feeling? I dislike putting on clothes. I exercise and watch my eating habits. DEAR READER: One of the hard- . est things to do is get rid of ab- dominal fat. It is not just the roll of fat you can feel under your skin either. There is aoout as much fat inside the abdomen as there is out- side. That internal fat compresses your abdominal organs and can make you feel uncomfortable. It makes such common problems as a l1iatal hernia worse because the in- creased pressure inside the abdomen helps to force a portion of the lower esophagus and stomach through the :, nonnal hole in the diaphragm into 'the chest cavity. You can also have abdominal dis- tention from gas. Such problems are made worse if you also have a lot of excess fat inside the abdomen. You will feel uncomfortable leaning for- ward when sitting or bending over as to tie your shoes. Another reader asked about liposuction and evidently misunderstood my previous com- ment. Yes, you can have liposuction done for fat under the skin. You can- not use lip<>suction to get rid of the fat inside rour abdominal cavity. You will need to go on a diet that is sufficiellt to help you lose weight. General eiercise programs are good to help yo1:1lose weight, but no exer- cise can c()mpress the fat inside your abdomen. The fat has to go before you can fl:~.tten your abdomen. I have discussed the causes of an enlarged abdomen and what you can do to flatten it in Special Report 104- WS, How to Battle the Bulge, which I'm sendi11g you. Others who want this repor! ean send $3 with a long, stamped (52 cents), self-addressed envelope f(}r it to THE HEALTH LETIER/104-WS, P.O. Box 5537, Riverton~ N.J. 08077. You can begin the exercises to flatten your ab- domen wl1ile you are losing weight, but don't expect too much until the fat starts t() disappear. «:ll~3 by King Features Synd. 20 tmmm:JSou r cream 26 29 SOURCE: Detroit Free Press, Cook's Healthy 11andbook Write For Science & Health

The Concordiensis FEATURES May 27, 1993, page 7 The Missing Piece ·Have you Found Yours Here? by Jennifer Unterberg Contributing Writer It was missing a piece and it was not happy, so it set off in search for its missing piece.\ Shel Silverstein tells a fable in which a piece sets forth on a journey to find its missing piece. Without it, the piece cannot roll swiftly. 1'he piece must, therefore, take its time. Time enough to meet a worm, or smell a flower, \and sometimes .it would pass a beetle, and sometimes the beetle would pass it, and this was the best time of aiL\ The piece, full ·of persistence, searches high and low, having adventures, falling into holes and. bumping into stone walls; all the while, singing happily. One day, the missing piece sees a sign,. Schenectady, New York; \that's an odd name, maybe I'll try it.\ The piece wobbles into a campus, Union CoLlege, .and thinks to itself, \Hey they don't require S.A.T. scores, it can't be that bad. Maybe my missing piece is there.\ \What are you doing here?'' a strange piece asks, \[ thought Union was the best kept secret in New York?\ \I'm just trying to find my missing piece,\ the missing piece responds, \are you it?\ \I'm undecided, but I'm searching also. I hear this is the best place to search, for you're always surrounded by friends and professors, and the only things you have to worry about is an occasional measles epidemic and finding a third class. Oh. we missed Camp Union by a year, but at least we don't have to take Homes and Buildings! You.'ll be fine. With 2,000 other missing pieces, you'll fit right in.\ Full of excitement, the missing piece chooses a dorm and settles in. eager for the four year adventure. Four years ago, we. like the missing piece, wobbled into Union as separate pieces. Our journeys prior to Union had been diverse. · We were individuals and unique, and yet we were alike - we were all searching for a piece that would make us whole; believing that once we found that piece, our lives would roll swiftly and happily. We came to Union our freshman year ambitious and 9&% of us Pre-Med (that is, until we took our first science). Advisors encouraged us to take a multiple courses from an array of disciplines. Although we couldn't figure out who 'staff was or how he could teach so many classes at one time. we began to feel more and more comfortable at Union. As separate pieces at Union, we assured one another that our journey did not have to be taken alone, that the quality of a journey can be enhanced by company. We opened our doors to our peers, \open-door volicy. please,\ and cheered each other on, taking pride in each other's accomplishments.

As we engaged in ou.r personal search, we became leaders of the Student FonJm, leaders of various organizations, and clubs.

We will always remember early spring. The monsoons. And then the grass turning greener, the sun shining brighter, and the donning of shorts and Birkenstocks long before the temperature ever reached 60. Thinking back it is appropriate to say thank to everyone who has helped us along the way. To the faculty: for their commitment, for making us think, and for sharing with us only a fraction of their knowledge, for teaching us discipline and responsibility, and for not calling on us when they knew we hadn't read. To the librarians for helping us make sense of the card catalogue system, and for patiently extending those inter-library loan due dates. Thank you to Ted and everyone in the mailroom for brightening our days, for keeping that glimmer of hope alive that more mail will somehow arrive in the afternoon sorting, and for knowing all 2,000 names and box numbers by heart for the days that we were too lazy to use our own ZBTs. Thank you to campus escort for keeping us safe, and warm. Thank you to the ladies at Dutch Hollow for being a constant reminder that good things still come in small packages. And to our friends: Our gratitude cannot be fully expressed: for always being there, and listening, for their guidance and for their support, for starting early, staying out 'till all hours of the night, and then justifying the whole thing with us in the morning. Thank you to our friends for believing in us when we didn't believe in ourselves. And most of all. thank you to our parents for the long distant calls home and the updates on our beloved pets left there. And thanks moms and dads for making the whole thing possible in the first place. A few wills to some of you who are graduating and some who are not: To next years inhabitants of Gillespie Street: your own personal police surveillance system, our favorite neighbor, Andy. To all Senior Thesis Writers: A sense of humor, an incredible ability to procrastinate, and an unlimited number of weekends spent {procrastinating) in front of your computer. To the '93- '94 Student Forum: Patience and extra long meetings that run into the years best episodes of your favorite t.v. shows. To next years residents in West: Lounges. To Anthony Albanese: A vacuum with directions on how to use it. To Marc, Pete, and Bueller: Another neighbor next year with a car alarm ... but louder. To Mike Rand: Our apartment when Lee and Co. move out. Finally this from Robert Fulghum: \There was a French criminologist named Emile Locard, and fifty years ago he came up with something called Locard's Exchange Principle. It says something to the effect that any person passing through a room will unknowingly deposit something and take something away. Modern technology proves it. Fulghum extends it. Every person passing through this life will unknowingly leave something and take something away. Most of this \something\ cannot be seen or heard or numbered. It does not show up in a census.

Current Union College students were very excited to welcome alutnni back to the campus, what th~C\ weren't pre- pared for was the school's mission to hide them a.s far away from the alumni as -possible. On Friday night, when several students were looking for places to eat after 7 p.m., they found that Du1ch Hollow was closed and tha1 the Skellar was no longer acceptimg meal cards. Given the few dining alternatives that students ,have, it should have been possible for the school to accommodate them.

Dear Editor: I was very angry about the events that occured at Union due to ReUnion weekend. It is degrading to the students that the alumni are given more respect and precedence than the students who are attending the school. I noticed the comforts that the school put up, the awing over Library Plaza, the lights on the Nott, etc. and originally thought that it was a nice idea for them to make Union look aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the school was implementing a pecking order as well. My realization of this began Friday night, when I arrived at the the College Center to find Dutch Hollow closed. I understood why the school needed to shuffle a few schedules around, but my question was why wasn't the student body informed of this or given any prior notice? I don't seem to recall anyone mentioning this. Informing us when we arrived at the College Center at 7 p.m. was a little too late to find out By then, there were no other dining options left on campus, I wondered why was I going to have to pay for a meal that I had technically already paid for when no college dining facilities wereavailable? I accepted this for it was Alumni Weekend. Disrupting a few aspects of the usual college routine for one night was understandable. On Satwday, I anived at the College center at 6 .pm to return some movies. Rudely, I was informed by a Security guard that the College Center was closed and would not be open until 9 pm. All I wanted to do was drop off the movies and mail a letter, but he informed me that I could find another mailbox and come back after 9 prn to . return the movies. Again, I mentioned, no one had been informed. Snidely he replied that it had been announced and made known all week. The security guard then retorted, \it was in The Concordiensis.\ Well, I have read The Concordiensis and have not found any such announcement. I have sent a letter and a copy of last week's Concordiensis to Campus Safety and encouraged them to locate this \annoWlcement\ and inform me when they do. I would like to know why it is that the Terrace Council should have such precedence over the entire college community. Aren't there other places on campus available for a banquet? If the Terrace Council is composed of many college alumni, then don't they remember what it was like to be a student? As for myself, I thought that closing the college center for five hours for a banquet was outrageous. If this is truly our student center, then why was it closed? Does it make any sense for these people to displace an entire community? I don't think that my money is any less green than the money of the alumni. Why is it that they deserve so much more respect? A friend told me that it was the way of private schools to butter up alumni because alumni are the surest ways· for schools to get money. I am disappointed. Maybe it's because I went to .public school and such elitism is frowned upon there. Union is not only encouraging classism, it is a living example of it I think that the only thing we must respect the alumni for is having already lived through Union's silly bureaucracy and foolishness. Excuse me for realizing that regardless of how I support this school, I will not deserve respect until I leave here. Maybe, just maybe the administratioa will read this letter and take just a little consideration before planning ReUnion weekend next year. Perhaps this ReUnion Weekend can be enjoyed, by all not just a few. P .S. Did anyone else happen to notice how the flag suddenly grew ,exponentially in size on Friday and then shrunk after the alumni left on Sunday? A~umni must have bought the flag too, huh?

The Concordiensis A False Sense of . Security Dear Editor, As exam time approaches, I am writing this atticle to warn others not to make ,the same mistake I did. If you feel like this will never happen to you, just remember, I felt that way too. It was Friday and exams started on Monday. It was gone. My entire backpack was gone. I thought these things only happened in dreams. How the hell was I supposed to study without my notes and book? After class I left my backpack by the doors looking out at the College Center in the Science and Engineering Building. I had to retum at 1:00 for an appointment with Professor Smith. But now, with my bookbag missing my plans has obviously changed. Frustrated and angry, I started to look around; I went to most of the offices, classrooms, and bathrooms on the first floor and even searched the basement and stairwells. It was hopeless. I reported the incident to security and I could only hope that someone would turn my things in or call me. In the meantime, I scrambled from friend to friend putting notes together, and I obtained a book from my professor. I felt betrayed and cheated, but knew inside I had to regain my normal spirit if I was ever going to learn anything. I made at least four unsuccessful trips that weekend back to the sport I had last seen my bookbag thinking that just maybe, I had imaged the whole thing and my book would be waiting for me. Monday morning, Professor Weick called to tell me he had found my bookbag in the men's restroom on the second floor of Science and Engineering. Only my notes were in it; my books, ten dollars, and my calculator had been stolen. Unfortunately. my notes were soaking wet. and before I could use them. they had to be hairdried. I was stressed and angry, but I still had to study for my exam which was the next day. I reasoned that sometimes after my exam, whoever stole my book would attempt to resell it to the bookstore. I informed the bookstore of the situation, yet deep down I felt as if I had been beaten. I wanted to go home and get away. It was scary to know that \someone\ around me had touched and pried through my things. I had thought that the students at Union had a strong sense of community and respect for one another. My friends and I had always left our things in the library or outside Upperclass Dining, knowing that our peers would take only what belonged to them and nothing else. I guess I can say I was lucky. Thanks to the cooperation of the bookstore, the thief was caught, and at the beginning of this term I got back my book, ten dollars. and extra money for my calculator. I was glad justice was done, but nothing can ever take away the suffering I went through or be done to restore that sense of trust I felt towards my peers. So, please, watch where you leave your tllings; it might be inconvenient, but it is better to inconvenience yourself a little, than risk losing so much. . Sincerely, Soume Daulat Class of'95 Fraternity proposal e concerning Vali-diae Dear Editor: During an I.F.C. Meeting held at Chi Psi on Tuesday, May 25, Vice President Mammola and Dean Alford met with representatives of campus fraternities and sororities to discuss how these groups will be affected by the Vali -dine System that is slated for implementation this coming fall. At this gathering, Mammola outlined the plan, and then explained the school's rationale for having taken this course. As a part of this program, it was confirmed that all students living in independent campus housing will be required to pay for a seven meal plan regardless of their access to kitchen facilities or membership in Greek organizations. As a fraternity member, I am concerned ah<lut how this will effect my brothers, who, for whatever reason, are not living in the house. To most fraternity and sorority members, eating together is an important way in which they can come together. LETTERS Even Greek R.A.'s would not be exempted. 1'he prospects of these people having to pay fraternity or sorority dues in addition to the meal plan would make their continued membership in Greek life a staggering financial burden. · During the question and answer portion of this encounter, the Greeks in attendance came up with a . counterproposal that I feel is fairer to fraternity and sorority members. Under this proposal, Greeks w.ho are living in independent spaces will be exempted from the seven meal plan requirement. In return, a1l Greeks win have their V alidine System balances raised from the proposed level of $200 per term to roughly $240, or whatever level would make up for the loss of income that this exemption might cause. This will ensure that the school continues to receive approximately the same income level that it expects to enjoy. white making it more feasible fo1 our out of house members to be active. As a Greek I am not entirely pleased with this plan and consider tile school's decision to impose any additional charges u11fair in light of the contributions that the Greek system makes to the community. But I understand the administration's need to have predictable income levels for its food services, and I feel that this is a reasonable compromi~e. I urge the administration to consider this proposal seriously, and also encourage my fellow Greeks to support this program.

S Thank you to all of the members of the Union College Community who have contributed to the Coacordiensis this year. - - The Editorial Board May 27, 1993, page 9 Professor of the Week Cont . cont. from page 3 Productivity is dependent on planning.\ \You have instilled in your students not only an understanding of the American political process, bttt an ability to play important parts in the unique experiment we call American Politics\ Unlike many professions which are reinforced by a grand payment or a promotion, Professor Tidmarch, as other professor at Union, is reinforced by his students. As stated by Professor Tidmarch, \The faculty is rewarded by seeing the students succeed in the classroom and out. The faculty's greatest pleasure is in seeing you succeed out there; going to law school, getting top jobs in law firms, Vice- President at the age of 35, partaking in socially worthy jobs that don't make much money but enhance the quality of life. This is confirmation to the faculty that we did something worthwhile. We helped produce the people that went out and made their mark.\ In the same light, Professor Tidmarch encourages his advisees and other students to think long and hard before pursuing such high prestigious jobs such as in law or political science. He finds that many students have a misconception of success. To Professor Tidmarch, success is not measured by affluence or prestige, but measured by oneself, internally. It is the concept of success that Professor Tidmarch is worthy of lecturing, for it is he who defines it. \Success Professor Tidmarch states, \requires a great deal of self discipline. Just as important is a conviction of what you want to do, for if you do not pursue what you want. you will not he happy.\ \Many of us know you as a tireless worker who demands everything for this college and nothing for himself' Professor Tidmarch spends much of his time interacting with students. He feels strongly that the relationship between the students and faculty needs to be changed to a more supportive system. It sadd.ens Professor Tidmarch that too many students leave Union without having taken full advantage of Union's resources, \the education you can get here is one hundred times more than you pay for in terms of life value.\ It is the 'life value' of education that Professor Tidmarch instills in his students and fights for others to follow. The 'life value' of education is not merely the facts in which one memorizes during a class, but facts about oneself and the reality of life. Professor Tidmarch worries that Union students lack the self confidence they so deserve. \Union students seem to have an inferiority complex. They fed insecure because they do not attend an ivy league and assume that they can't compete.\ Professor Tidmarch feels that it is the responsibility of the faculty to give students the self-confidence aRd the determination to pursue their goals. Professor Tidooarch feels strongly that students must be prepared for the unpredictabk events in life. Diagnosed with cancer one year ago, and learning a wi;'1~k ag11 that the cancer cells nad spread have required Professor Tidmarch to dig deep inside himself and usc his personal resources to fight his battle. \Over the past five years and especially this year, I have learned a new app,·ectatlon for human potential. We have a lot in us, we simply must dig down and search. Although you may not get it all done in one day and you might have to go the long haul. you can get it all.\ \Set high standards for yourself and pursue them relentlessly. and you will he pleasantly surprised how much you can accomplish. You must have the determination and will. Don't get too comfy. This does not mean becoming a workaholic. Set high standards in many aspects of your life. such as rclationsllips and friends. Don't ncgiccl them cr ta\:e them for granted .\ \Many of us know you as a conversationalists whose love of talking politirs is rimled onfy by your passion for playing rock and roll.\ Although Professor Tidmarch is undergoing treatment for cancer, he teaches one class and continues his interaction with students. He says that this interaction is part of his therapy. it keeps him active and energetic. He also feels that discussing his canc('r is healthy, that it proves to people that illness happens but life goes on. \At twenty- two, f would have never dreamed that at forty-eight I would be diagnosed with cancer. You've got to hit it straight on.\ Professor Tidmarch will he on sabbatical in the fal 1 working on a book on the change of political language through the years and a book on the history of the Union political science department for the bicentennial. He will return to teach classes in the spring. Next year at this time. Professor Tidmw~t will be close to another birthday, and with his voice back, he promises to once again wear his pink outfit and 'schtick' and hold a concert for the students, playing his guitar like he did with Charlie T. and the Undergraduates. With the blossoming of the new flowers. the man of resilience will once again teach another class. not only of facts, but of life values. \But all of us know you as a friend. For that. the Alumni Council is proud to present to you the Faculty Meritorious Award.\ Mrs. Moore. the political science department secretary said, \he is truly beloved,\ as Professor Tidmarch left the room. ....

'Women m Central Park, NYC\ 1993 by Alison Kocsis Fire in the Basement This Woman's Work by Jenrtifer Unterberg Staff Writer Calling all Dreamers and Optimists, The Garnet Minstrelles and The DutchPipers are proud to announce the release of their debut Compact Disk Fire in the Basement. Pre-selling has begun in the Student Activities Office and the disk can be purchased for $10.00. Yesterday, Senior Beth Kaplan orderEd one, \I'm so excited,\ Beth exclaimed/' my favorite song 'Island Earth' is on the disk.\ A fan of the singing groups, Beth, like many others, loves to listen to the Minstrelles and DatcPipers, for their music is so uplifting. Fire in the Basement promises to be as hot as the title. As Megan Howell, member of the Minstrelles, sings, \Bumi11g Burning, Burning baby, Fire!\ The heat burns, not from high-tech studio dubbing, state of the art equipment, or sound mixing (no lip singing here); but from the natural energy of the two singing groups. The array of sounds, beats, and harmony of the Minstrelles and the D11tch Pipers creates a musical sensation that astonishes the ear. The pairing of outstanding voices with a creative, hip edge forms an entertaining and impressive sound which does more than replicate a o ular son . The members enunciate each element of the song and enhance the originai score with dynamic vocals. Two to three times a week, the two groups practice in the basement of the Nott (hence, the title Fire in the Basement), listening to popular songs and creating new sounds, as well as preparing for their many performances throughout the year. Sunday at the Fitzugh Ludlow Reception, the Garnet Minstrelles previewed songs from their upcoming disc. Although the group was not complete, the performance was as spectacular as always. Three of the songs included \Only You\ \Uncle John's Band\ and the popular \Island Earth\ Nine songs from The Dutch Pipers, including \Zombie Jamboree\ \The Train Song,\ \Graduation on time\ \Duke of Earl\ can I Love you if you Won't go Away\ will debut on the disk, as well. On June 4, the heat and energy will peak at a grand performance by The Dutch Pipers and The Garnet Minstrelles. The promotion of the official release of their disc, Fire in the Basement will become a celebration for their many months of hard work and the permanent recording of such. talent and energyyyyyyyyy(''Break!\) ;y .. oL1 a.re happily invited to j!iQ _ 1 o K w 1 o }t: _lf.s - an interrnedia art exhibit THURSday jUNE. );1993 11':30- 2:JO perFORM ng ARStudio arTSbldg by Rebecca Parlakian Contributing Writer \Women hold up half the sky/' says a Chinese proverb. \This Women's Work\ a collection of performances premiering on June 2 at 9 pm in the Arts Department, gives us the opportunity to see the world through women's eyes.

The Wasteland Draws a Crowd by Daniel J. Bullen Contributing Writer On Tuesday, May 11, under the direction of David Hops{)n, T. S. Eliot's monumental poem The Waste Land was preformed by a cast of ten. The cast enacted Eliot's search for spiritual redemption and life in an era of sterile emptiness came to life. Craig Pike narrated the search, and The Waste Land came into being in terms of his wandering. The voice of tlle poet took many voices around this central pilgrim. Beglnning in the narrator's disgust with the time in which he lives, and the reawakening of spring kindling old memories and desires, the stageplay then portrayed a scene fmm Eliot's childhood. These scenes, in which Sarah Teasdale, portraying the Lithuanian Countess Marie Lairsch, recalls simple joys of y()11th, and laments again the ennui and emptiness of the present. Another happy moment arose in the hyacinth garden, in an affair with the hyacinth girl, Rebecca Parlakian. We are told of the sensuous death narrator en;countered with her, numbed and stifled in the \heart of light, the silence.\ Then Uza Burnett, playing Madame Sosostris, the fortune teller, foretold the narrator's future, a future devoid of rebirth, one of death by water and eternal, ttnfu.lfilled wandering. The lament of the narrator, frenzied by the unreal city's meeting Madame Sosostris' prognistication, distraught by the death and his plight, with which, in the last line of the scene, he burdens the audience as well, implicating the listeners also in the Waste Land. In the second scene, th·e personal and social theme of the poem errupted with the narrator's empty marriage with Rebecca Parlakian, a woman determined to communicate who is always only frustrated by ner vain attempts, which elicit nothing from her husband; indeed he thinks nothing but borrowed thoughts, and true communication thus is rendered impossible. Then the searcher finds nothing but repugnance in a lower class pub woman, played by Julie Shanebrook, who relates him a story of unfaithfulness and a botched abortion. This is symbolic of the faulty nature of male- female relationships, reducing to primal urges the reasons for social intercourse. The narrator repents for these lusts in the third scene, after he watches, through the disgust of three girls playing by the river Thames. His raving emptiness; and then through the eyes of Bill Wolff, representing Tiresias, he witnesses the ·disaffectionate intercourse between a typist, Rebecca Parlakian, and her \lover Doug Bartell. These encounters, in addition to the numbness of the Thames daughters, Anna Love, Ruth Lerman and Barbara McCuen, monotonously relating their sexual encounters, dishearten him, and he pleads with the Christian God to be plucked from so odious and corrupt a setting. He dies the physical death of Phlebas; the Phoenician sailor, to be reborn in the East, with new spiritual guidelines, at last in an atmosphere which seems promising to yield rebirth and redeemed spiritual growth. The stageplay ends on the Hindu path to spiritual fulfillment, for Bill Wolff, the thunder, about to bring life-giving rain, speaks a single syllable, and is interpreted by followers Doug Bartell, Sarah Teasdale and Liza Burnett to mean three Hindu words: give, sympathize, control. These, the narrator learns, frenzied at the sight of his spiritual disarray, will lead him at last to the state of being called shantih, \the peace which passeth understanding.\ In adapting this poem to the stage, David Hopson had many difficulties to overcome, and his dramatic presentation was a success in mounting every obstacle. The poem indeed came alive, and not as a single voice narrating a decline in Western civilization, but as many voices, many people, portraying that d edine, by their disaffectiona te relationships, by their numbness to each other, by their repugnance for their current state of affairs. In fact Eliot did intend The Waste Land for several voices The staging revolved n<Jt around a central character, but around a general decline. The staging was brilliant, as characters carne and went, and took on diffeFellt personae, showing Eliot's idea that the characters in the poem are all related by being all in the same spiritual and emotional state. Another novelty occurred on this night, and shocked and surprised many. The audience for this dramatic poetry reading packed the College Center auditorium. This raised spirits both among the faculty and the cast by the large turn out. The cast's hard work and skill was displayed to many and by all justly appreciated.

' i' SPORTS: The Year In Review Women's and Men's Swimming & Diving Both the Men's and Women's Swimming and Diving teams met with great success this season. It was a landmark year, with both teams finishing second in the New York State Championships. The second place finish was the best ever for the men's squad. On the national level, the Women's team placed eighth in the country. The meet was highlighted by the excellent per- formance of Julie Benker. Benker won the national title for the 100- yard backstroke. Both teams are looking forward to even more success next season. Crew Teams Have Banner Year The Men's and Women's Crew teams had very successful seasons. The high point of the season came during the Dad Vail Regatta. In that event, the Union Crew teams competed against 84 other schools. During the Regatta, the men's lightweight four cruised to a national title. The mem- bers of the lightweight four are: Kevin Puppe, Matt Green, Pete Shwab, Matt Kirk, and J.J. Weiner. Union Hockey Looks Towards Future The Union Skating Dutchmen suffered a less than successful second year Division I season. They fmished the season with a 3- 22 record. The highlights of the season came in Union's home victories against Cornell, Princeton, and Vermont. The team was unable to claim victory while away from Achilles Rink. Fortunately, most of the team were rookies, and they are sure to improvewithayearofDivisionlexperience under their belts. The strong performances of freshmen Reid Simonton, Ryan Alaspa, BradKukko,andShaneHolungawillsurely lead to improvement next season. The Dutchmen are graduating only two players from this year's squad: Captain Greg Steele and Kevin Darby. The End of an Era for Union Baseball As the Baseball season comes to a close, the future of the team is in question. With the loss of senior Captains Mike Johnson, Dave Sodergren, and Jim Fitzhemy; Union's looking for a new wave of team leaders. Senior Mike Johnson won team MVP for his excellent performance at second base. The loss of Johnson and Sodergren will leave Union with a big gap in the infield. Younger players, such as Dave Dagistino, who was named to the New York State Division Iii All-Star Team, will launch a new era of Union Baseball. Lacrosse Has an Emotional Season This year's Lacrosse Team experienced success as well as disappointment. The highlight of the season was when the Dutchmen defeated William's College for the frrsttime in twenty-three years. The low of the season came with a difficult loss to Hartwick College in the first round of the playoffs. In that game, Union was tied with Hartwick for most of the contest. To the dismay ofUnion fans, Hartwick rallied late in the game to claim victory by the score of 11-9. Brian Harris was named Capital District MVP. Cory Holbrough and Nate Finch were also named as All-Stars. Union College Senior Julie Benker won the national championship in the I 00 meter backstJ:olce at the Division III playoffi at Emory College in Atlanta over Spring Break. Benkervvas one offrve Union swimmers to be named All-Americans for their peiformances at the chClmpionships. Sports Quiz . by Lar·ry Duncan EXPANSION TEAMS 1.
