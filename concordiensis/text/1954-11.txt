Lewis be charged with violation of a Supreme Court order against a coal strike, and by investigating the American Federation of Musi- cians. He was also in favor of an amendment limiting Presidential tenure to two terms. After being named Vice-Presiden- tial candidate for the Republicans in 1952, Nixon entered in an ambi- tious schedule. Eut then lightning fell. He was asked to cxplain. the source of his income, as he seemed wealthier than most Congressmen but had no known inheritance. The t>n tire nation listened to his ex- planation. Nixon has b0en on the Board' of Trustees of Whittier College since 1939. In 1948, he was chosen one of the 10 outstandi:ng young men of the country by the Junior Chamber of Commerce. Both he and his wife, whom he married in 1940, are members of the So-ciet-y of Friends.

We all know that a party is no fun 2-t aU '11-ith no games, and w-itllol!t fun a. party is no party at all, so, it could be said that parties are games. ·Of course, it could rulso be said that games are parties b11t this would be incorrect because only games that are fun are pa.r- ties, and all games are not fl.U!. The relevancy of this statement could ·be questioned if all of .the implications contained herein are not aocepted and understood? VVe wtn assume that everyone accep.ts lind understands these things. The simplest sort of game is to gather in good, happy fraternity, and say or do things to excite -Iaughter. This is a pippy past- time. The on.Jy trouble is that laughter is very difficult to ellic it except by te1'ling jo-kes or doing some sort of ·shocking thing. 'JJhis is, of -course, not acceptable. ·'Un- funny things are l-ikely to be .too pippy g-iving at least some of the participants pip or some such thing. \'Zounds says yo·u, \It sounds simply awful,\ ·(We main· tain a scholarly and very profound' silence.)·· We eliminate this thought; on to new and exciting things. The party versio-n of \Droodles\ (those simply ginger little dra'Wings ·which some Price fellow draV!s) can be \l!ery interesting. When for-- tified 'VIith some of Phil's sp~ia.J \Bath- tub- gin- for Connoisseurs,\ one can find a multitude of inter- esting places to put these things, and most extraordinary themes. This· game all too quickly tends. to :become obscene, and should be abandoned before the spirit o.f good clean fun is lost. Spea:k.ing of good cle·an fun, (we thought were the only one,) Sherwood has an · evocative game played with jelly beans in his column across the page. .Seems like a lot of trou.ble just to eat ·candy, but then maybe we just don't get it. If all of this useless to·rnfoolery bores you (and it surely should) you rrlght try science. Science is, at times, jolly fun. Some of you rr.ay kno.w this, some others 1nay not. There arc multitudiferous dif- ferent pleasurable scientific activi- tlf's and ex-periments - w€\11 try here to concern o-urself with some of the less obvious. Gravity lends itself to some good fun (but t() pt·otect ourself from the eenso!\ and censure of the Publications Board we'll leave You to explore these fields.) Some of the once- games have become grim science. There was once popular a game played with cards, called, we think strike her-or rather poker, whi<h involved articles of wearing ap- parel. This was as ·hot as an ex- plosive device used in celebrating Independence Day, until the abuses wh:ich inevitably accompany a good thing set in. There is another ex- perirr •ent-purely scientific-which We haven't yet mentioned; prob- ably we shouldn't. It consists of quaffing one ounce of beer e\l!ery minute for as long as it can 'be done. The results can be astound- ing. If you don't think your da.te ~ill rniss you, you might try for a record. This colurr::n would be happy to print the name and cOon- sumption of the week end's re-cord holder.

A:-;!-!Jgtattt l't'l'\ EdJtur In 1952, with th-c election of a Republican majority, Senator Mc- Carthy, hy reason of seniority, took c-ontr·oJ of the Senate Committee on I·nvestigations. l'n his \'arious hearings, including Fort Monmouth et. al, 'he failed to uncovn a f''ingle comm.unist who was not already known to t-he Federal Bureau of Inv!'stigntion. Th0 reason for this is quite simple. He deriv<>d all of his infonr.ation Pither from in- fol'mants who were already in touch with the F. B. I. or he obtained it, nobody know!'< how, ft·om the secret, confidential files of the F. B. I. itself. He did, however, manage to i·nsult and impugn the honor and integrity of such men as General Marshall, President Truman, Chip Bohlen, General Zwicker, and Dean Achl'son; and of such instit-utions and organizations as Harvard Uni- versity, The Americans for Demo- cratic Action, and the New York T'imes. Ni:xon and then·R<'presentative .1\fun-dt of South Dakota sponsored the first pi~e of legislation to be sanctioned by thC' Un-American Activities C0ommittee, the proposed Subversive Activities Control Act of 1948. Although many revisions were made on. the bill to remove the unconstitutional parts, it was not passed. Nixon spent most of August, 1948, dabbling in the Con- gressional investigation of Red espionage in the U. S. and it was he who insisted on the meeting be- twean Hiss and Chambers. Thus, ·he was cme of the major instru- ments in the reopening of the case. At ,tJ:lat time, he said that he was At M. B.

In the r·esulting Sen- atorin.J hearings he contributed to his own downfall with the aid of a puckish elf from Boston named Joseph Welch. More and more, members of the Senate began voic- ing their disgust over his methods of Q.peration and his callous· inter- pretation of Senatorial rule·s. Fin- ally four senators were appointed a committee to study charges and to recommend censure action on Scmator Joseph R. McCarthy (R.- Wis,). Their findings were such that they have recommended this an<! it seems likely that the recom- mendation will be carried out. The S!.'nator has made many phrases which have become bywords of Americanism (1954 style). Among them are: \I have here in my hand , , .\ and the inevitable \Point of order, Mr. Chairman, Point of order.\ He aJso has said tha.t the \Great American jury wH! vin•dicate me at -the polls by re- electing a sweeping Republican ma.jority.\ '!ou are also invite~ to use our repair sewice.

QUOTES OF 'DISTINCTION The Garnet yearlings traveled to LW!g rsla:nd last Saturday and trimn:1ed tlle Morrisville Aggies by a score of 25-0. This is the first victory for the Frosh following a 13-13 tie with the New York Mill- tary .A=demoy in their opener. Dick Cieollela's squad uses t•he same split T attack emp!Qyed on the 'Varsity. Piloted by quarter- back ·Dd Janulionis the yearlings also rely mainly em the option. Ja.nulionis, a halfback in high school ·wa..s conve·rted into a split T direc:tor ·in record time, and in Union is in dire straits with a sever-e l~k of material to work with, as Coach Sam Hammerstrom, in his fifi!h year- at Union, was greeted by only 22 candidates in his opening workouts. The num- ber has since been augmented for the sake of scrimmage, but there is an obvious lack of depth -and strength. Especially in the line will the strain of sixty minute football tell on the Dutchmen who have been heavily scm·ed upon consist- ently.

Although Haverford outweighs Union by 1() pounds per man In the line, the Garnet can boast a solid 172 pound backfield compal'ed to 160 pounds for the Fords. How- ever, Haverford has two fast and shifty halfbacks, Don Cohill and Don Hopkins, who with quarter- back Ted Regan pitching are sure to figure prominently in their pass offense.

A similar situation too place in the Williams game last year \hen the Garnet enjoyed a 21-6 halftime lead only to see it dwindle al.\ay in the clos- ing minutes. The gridders started off slowly in the third quarter. The field was in bad shape by this time and the wet iball caused a rash of fumbles. Williams looked as if they might repeat last year's upset as they moved for two quick scores. Fullback Tim Hannan drove over from the six for- the Ephmen's second TD and added a third a fe•W' minutes later on a two yar-d plunge.

Steps are now being taken to purchase the f.Joor at a cost of more than $17,000 complete. • Union Plans Portable Court for Fieldhouse cer and lacrosse, and intramural football and softball, vo.ould be ready for use as an athleti·c .field by the time classes resumed in September. By ART HOEFS Gazette Sportswriter Although the Union College :Vlernorial fieldhouse is about half completed, school officials yesterday lJegan think- ing in terms of a portable basketball floot· for the campus athletic structure. :;. :(. :(. ATHLETIC DIRECTOR BILL HETZ announced that he had been empowered to enter into a contract with the Dil'•atale Flooring Co., of Boston, for a basketball playing floor which \Vill be the most mod- ern of its kind in this area. The Union board of trustees has appropriated the necessary funds for the purchase of the floor which is figured to cost $14,500, plus an additional $2,500 for baskets. The floor will be 11.2 by 60 feet overall, including a 94 by 50 feet court with 5-foot borders on the sides and a 9-foot runoff on the ends of the playing area. Made of kiln-dried clear stock beechwood, the floor will nave sup- ports of 2 by 4 thickness, with all flooring joints also backed by 2 by 4's. Sill (3 by 8) bolted tog·ether in an unbroken line will bind the pieces together. The floor will contain 210 panels, 4 by 8 with an over-all depth of 2~~ inches. Panels will weigh 152 pounds each and will be supported by individual spacers placed under every seven boards. :;. :;. ~ THE BUILDERS, the DiNatale Co., have been building floors for 70 years. They made their first basketball floor in 1937, and today s.re considered the most important basketball floor makers in the U.S. They have portable courts all over the country, two in South America, and one in use in Germany. For the Union setup, the floor will be constn1cted in sue~ a Ir.fl.Il- ner that the enUre court can be stacked into a corner- of the field- bouse in 28-foot high pilings. A cr«w of about 18 men will be need- ed to assemble and dismantle the floor. The floor is built to such perfec· tion that the Boston Garden crew can lay the floor in about 90 min- utes and take it down in about 45 minutes. The fl.oor in the Beantown Garden has been in usc about eight Ftlrd's Lineup <Continued from Page 5) Although injured earlier in the year, Bill ()rtman, Haverford's full- back and best ball carrier will be back in action. Hal Weaver, 180 pound junior who filled in for Ort- ·man, has proved such a valuable ball player with his running and passing, lhat coach Hicks will un- doubtedly switch him to one of the halfback positions in ()rder to make use of his talents. But the skill for which Weaver is particularly noted is punting. Weaver is the 13th best punter in the nation with a 39.5 yard average in four games. This, however, is not the whole story, .As a team, Haverford has compiled an average of 39.6 yards in the same number o.f games. The reason for this oddity is that the Ford'·s other punter, Mark Randall, while not having played as much as Weaver, has still managed to outdistance him. Therefore, Union fans, \vatch the punts on Saturday. They will probably be the longest seen here all year. Since Haverford had no game on the 30th, its coaching staff scouted ou; game with Williams, Earlier this year they were up for the Ver- mont game. Since these were the only two Saturdays on which Hav- erford did not have a game, it is readily apparent that Coach Hicks realizes lhat his squad is playing against its strongest opponent. If this were not true, Hicl{S would have spent other Saturday after- noons scouting other foes. Both teams will work from the split \T Haverford taking advan- tage of its fleet halfbacks in end swe~ps designed to outrun the op- position. Union will also rely on the ground game, but with four hard-running backs who can ex- ecute almost any play. Haverford also has the dubious distinction of suffering from periodic attacks of fumblitis, which have cost them several g'3mes. Letter To the Editor of the Concordiensis: years. :c. :r- :;.

Lend Them Your Ears A few weeks ago it was my good fortune to be present at the prom of one of our neighboring women's schools. One of the most enjoyable parts of the week-end, highlighted by the formal, was the entertainment which was provided by two singing groups during a long intermission by the band. This past week-end those of us who did attend the prom were fortunate to have the Dutch Pipers for this entertain- ment while Claude Thornhill and his band took their rest. It was clear to see that the group had done much in the way of preparation for the event. I thought it was a disgrace to the students and their dates the way they were received I personally enjoyed listening to the Dutch Pipers. I believe that this was something new that they were begin- ning. Hal Vink has worked very hard with his men in order to bring something to Union which is present at almost all other men's colleges, a vocal group. I wanted to listen to them. They were gi\'en very little chance to be heard. It is quite possible that there were many people present who will differ with me as to the quality of the group-this is immaterial. What is important is that there were few of these people thoughful or considerate enough of those who wished to listen to the Pipers and for the singers, to remain quiet and allow them the courtesy of the stage. I would have been ready enough to excuse these men on the grounds that they were unaware tha:t they were in- terfering with the entertainment. I could not do his, how- ever, in view of the fact that Mr. Vink had to come out him- self and ask for quiet. It was sadder yet to witness no de- crease in the noise after some semblance of order had been called for. I doubt if an~· people were fortunate enough to hear the vocalizations to any acceptable degree. I, as previously stated, believe that the Pipers are good. I should like to see them eontinue at l:nion. They should l.Je given, the chance to perform for the school; these performances taking place at one of the noonday ehapels. I hope that when they are called up to ·the chapel stage they will receive the consider- ation flue them. And Cheer On Her Team ... A little \·oice from the rear spoke up last week and called for administrati\'e ~uppu1-t of our football team travel- ling to Hamilton tommTow. This year's edition of the Gar- net eleven stand poisecl on the threshold of establishing their .best season's n·t·ord since 19·19 when we had an uncle- footed season. The team with its record of 3-3-1 has posted a record of whieh we should all be proud. Over the year the\' have howed onlv to such teams as undefeated Hobart and pow(>rhouscs as ·Amherst and Rochester. They tied a strongly favored Vermont team which went on to defeat Hochester and defeated Williams, who were rated as slight favorites. This small voiee ealled for the school to journey to Hamilton to encourage om squad in their, efforts to post their winning season. It was gratifying to witness an an- swei· from the faculty to this call. I believe that it was a sound idea to call off the Satur- day Eleven o'clocks in order that those wishing to attend the game may have time to travel to Hamilton to root on the Dutchmen Gl'idders. It is my feelings that this aspect of college life can be as rewarding to the students as their studies. It is certainly a large step towards I'ecovering that lost school spirit which has been so sorely bereaved. Tile school has also arranged a bus to transport those ?tudents who find themselves without a car for the trip. It IS my hope that all of the students who have not made theit· plans for the week-end to joumey up to Hamilton to witness the contest. The faculty and administration have provided the means for a res urge in student interest of student function; in this case, our revitalized athletic .program. \Ve hope that the students will make the second necessary step hi this direc- tion. G.R.K. FRIDAY. NOVEMBER· 12, 1954 Letter to the~Editor Dear Sir: (OY\COtdtel1!;1$ ?lo.V\5 for lk• \)n,oVl Co\le3e. Lt \,rc.ry _,.,,.,. As a past a;ssociate editor of the Concordiensis, I have followed with interest the first few issues of this ·new school year. lt is par- ticularly gratifying to note that the job one has sweated over for a couple of years has passed over to new hands with little apparent difficulty in the process. In all, the 'Gordy shows '1- definite improve- ment over last year, ·perhaps not·m the mechanics of putting it to- gether, but certainly\.in the scope or its coverage and in the participa- tion by members of Ute lower classes in itH organizatioll.., Much as I am pleased with this year's paper, l run somewhat dis- turbed, however, by the goings-on under the headline \Tulips and Chimneys.\ Wh-ile I was a member of the staff of the Cop.cordy, it was impossible for me· to comment edi- torially upon the pen-and~ink antics of Edwar.d Cloos, Jr. Now, as an alumnus, I am in a .position where I can do so with impu11.'ity. It is not my intention to criticize Mr. ·Cloos' personality, were '1: :to harbor any such judgements as \vould. be detrimental to his reputation if I publicized them. Rather, I shall -confine my attention and criticism to his recent column in which Mr. James Brown received what is, to Tulips and Chimneys - By Edward Cloos, Jr. I should like sincerely to apol- shades found in th(} roofs· expr-esses ogize to J1m Brown for our egre.g- a feeling beyond our words. ious breach of gentlemanly ethics, The most impressive work, to We hope that our ill-considered our mind, is on~ large and certain- choi'cc of words and acti'on are not ly not usual, can vas called simply, and have not been constructed to \Nude.\ At first one sort of walks be in any way a reflection on Mr. right into the picture and it be- Brown's COIIlSiderable service to comes flat and purposeless-gobs of , my mind, an unjustified calling- do\\'11. It ·is not within the .province of this letter to debate the merits of the issue which .provoked Mr. Cloos' personal attack; ·!'ather, I shall only consider the attack and its possible consequenc·es. In his letter to the :Editor of ·October 29, Mr. Dominick Carbone proposed, as one solution, that Mr. Cloos be removed from his position on the Concordiensis. Now, while I may find some of Mr. (Hoos' foi- bles of imagination beyond my cc>mprehension, and while I :may dispute the reasoning behind those that I do understand, I s-ee no -t·ea- scn to remove him .from .the staff as long as he is a 'student at Union College. If he oversteps his bounds, as he seems -to :have done in the column in question, he still may not be t:emoved. 'This may st:em, to some, to be a form of fav- oritism by the Editor, or an indica- tion of Editorial support of his views. Actually, however-, it is th~ Union, paint spt•ead with a pallet knife in :r- :r- ¥- seemingly haphazard fashion; but The art of David Cohen. T'he fir-st thing we did w'hen viewing Cohen's art for the initial time wa:s to compare it to the pre- vious exhibit of Paul Burlin. This is, we think, a rather natur;'l.l .thing to do--almost necessary. T'he con- trasts are striking. Burlin, who by his ov.n word \just paints,\ has unity in -his work which is Pxceed- ingly powerful; he seems a man with a really definite purpose, a concrete philosophy, which, though it is not easily defined, is rPadily seen. Cohen seems to flounder in doubt; he seems on the edge of a real instght, at \the doors of per- ception,\ so to spealr, yet he hadn't passed through this \door\ by the time of his untimely death. He at first seems an almost typical Bo- hemian artist-rather abstract and somewhat sloppy, with no purpos~ at a:ll. It would be more than merely unfortunate if one were to leave with only that impre·ssion and never return to see if it were justified, The second visit to the Cohen Showing is a richly rewarding ex- perience. Now the first concept of the artist is changed; one sees that Cohen is ·a man of beautiful artistic individuality, The easy grace seen in his face is every- where apparent in his art. He still seems confuse·d and uncertain, but not at all completely. The rather Large canvas called \Roofs of Paris\ shO\\\S in subtle splendor aH that is this enchanted city--and not an Eiffel Tower to be seen. The nuances of dark but not somber from farther off than the -space be- tween the boards affon:ls the figure l;ISSUmes an entirely -new impor- ta.nce. Two new \dimensions\ come from Cohen, the real dimension of depth to the eye and the equally real dimension of the emotion of Cohen; this strange figure comes alive a.hd steps toward a corn::r which emerges from the color-; the large hips and heavy but graceful body seems not a representation of a woman's bo4 at all but rather a representation of a woman her- self. Our interpretation of his \woman\ is that sh<> is shy, grace- ful, and extremely by apologetic sensual. Some (}f the work is pleasingly sentimental but not very satisfy- i:n:g. \Pont Neuf\ and \Vineyard\ are two of this sort. Cohen's \Self Portrait\ is puzz- ling beyond our gr3sp. He has dis- tot·ted ''llimself\ apparently with a purpose, but one which is not easily accE>ssable_ Perhaps he feels in his ·portrait the lack of unity and di- rection which seems to be in his work. We weren't able to get John Bradbury's opinions on this - they should be interesting. The drawing entitlet:! \Woman.\ is an extraordinary thing. We have considerable respect for Co'hen for his work alone; The delicate power in this blazing nude' seems all of Cooeh's ideas of women. The char- coal called \Head of Woman\ seems almost the Yungian female co>mplem1'mt to Cohen end suggests the clarity in some of his works- perhaps this could be dt.lled the \last\ of the artists work more correctly than any of the others. ------- European Adventure By Gary R..

If the qual- ity is poor, then it is the Editor's responsibility to :see to it that it is improved, and nqt to discharge staff member as .a penalty for work which is unacceptable, intentional or othenvise. This brings one tl!) the question of the propriety of Mr. Oleos' re- marks. Since he did not submit proof for his conclusion!'l as to the nature of Mr. Brown's character, he is guilty on two counts. First, h<' has libeled Mr. Brown, Second, he has violated the ethics .of the newspaper fraternity by defaming a person's character, without proof, in ·an attempt. to ein·phasize a point. In addition, Mr. Cloos has pre- sumed to sit as judge upon one of his fellow students, - one who l:asn'.t a defense to match all of- fense which is mediate(! via a news- paper column. I do not ask for Mr. Cloos' re- moval·; I only request tha;t he a;ban- ·don this \avante-garde'' brand of McCarthyisrn for the interesting, if befuddling, .discussions he so fre- quently produced last semester. It is to the best interest -of all ·con- co:'rned, including the College, that the Concordiensis remain an organ for the d.i¥~emination of informa- ticn, editorial opinions,. and•enter- tainment.-not smear. Only in that way can the Concordiensis· remain an independent student publication rather than a faculty and ad·minis- tration-dictated paper.

Summing Up lt has !Jeen my pleasure to have been CO:tlnected, in vari- OUS positions, with the Concordiensis for the past three and almost one half years. During this time I have come to understand the l'nion College extra-curricula system. l should like to shal'e with you now my impressions of the advantages to be gained from participation in these activ- ities. I am also more concerned with what I see as a major problem in interesting and keeping students active in this field. I have always maintained that participation in extra- curricula work can be the most rewarding and beneficial part of your four years at L'nion, many students here fail to realize and take advantage of this. I am not advocating that students give no consideration to their scholastic life at Uuion. What I am trying to say is that not the work done in the classroom or in the library, but the habits established in your relationship to your activ- ities are the most formative to be experienced at college. The man who is given any measure of responsibility in his work is fortunate indeed. It is more true to life than any work encountered in classes. You are expected to perform a job, a good one at that. You cannot let up for one minute in these efforts. If you do, the t'esults will be clearly visible. Personal relations, almost lacking in your scholastic pur- suits are of primary importance in activities: you are work- ing ~·ith and for your fellow students. 'Th.e experience of having a jul.> tv uo anu having to do it with the help of other men, with the end result of performing .a service for the campus wherein your results are tested, is the most valuable part of ~·our college life. I am not attempting to evaluate my acl1ievem~ts along this line. I am only thankful that I have had the chance to do this. Before I attempt to comment what I consider to be the main pitfall of activities today, I will briefly mention ~he satisfaction which l have received in doing a job for you w1th no thought of or personal gain. I have been thrilhid that I have had the opportunity to do this. It is granted to too few students and umortunately only a handfl.ll of you may share this feeling with me. I have stated that almost all of you faiJ. to take true ad- vantage of \vhat I feel to be these wonderful opportunit~es. Our extra-curricula system appears to be the work of a few for the benefit of the many. The true advantage comes not in reading your campus newspaper, but in contributing to it, not in listening to the radio station hut working on it. This is your serious oversight. You have in yom· negligence of activities added to the work of those seriously interested and have thereby in- creased their gains. There is tremendous satisfaction in do- ing the lion's share of the work, but this has seriously hurt the standards of the work produced. I have often been confronted by the man who wishes to work for the newspaper. These men are serious in their de- sires, but when the time ·comes to pick up their assi~nment at the office it is too much trouble for them. This is your trouble. Everything is too much trouble. You want the ad- vantages but are willing to do none of the vvorl~ which will truly gain them for you. You have been worried about your .studies. How will your participation in an activity hurt your studies 1 At the present time anyone devoting worl> to an activity will to some degree Le hurt. I believe that this is your fault, for poor participation on your part can have one of two effects. An undermanned organization may bring· about the harder work of those men who are in positions of responsibility.; th:is work will J'esult in a fine level of achievement of the activity and the benefits to the few. A mediocre product from this group may also follow the apathetic body. In my associations with the paper I have learned never to allow my other responsibilities to lag because of the press- ing demands of the paper. This is a sad confession; how- everever, I am making it. If you ask me why, I will tell .• Another Viewpoint Thea.tre Wh:irl By ·Carl Niemeye1• On the program handed the a.~di;_,~ne ch:arrucitMs. >'l.ith .th.e anac.hi:\on- ence at H!Ulna Hall Thurs~ay li1ght tstic hnes seemtJd to me a: hap12y . \A Phoenix Too Frequent\ .wa.s idea,, w<hich may have been r.ntpl!'cit . modestly descrllbed as \a '\\>Qrkshop_ in the :pla,y and tl)ay have been .proouction, -sponsored by the · De- Professor Peterson's 0111;!1, :happy .partment of English and the contribution.
