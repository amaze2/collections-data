'rhe object of the meet is to promote competition among the men in the district who are not afforded the opportunity of getting it'lto the big meets held in New York. It is the second meet of its kind staged by the Union offi- cials and if its success is as great as the one two years ago, it will be worthy of every bit of attention of the student body and the people of Schenectady. Coach Bruce has arranged for the entries of Lafayette and Colgate and a number of other contracts are in the making with other colleges in the district.

Werle Issue lVlanager _______________________________ E, T. lv.Iauger FHIDAY, nfARCH 2, 1928 We understand that at a jointrneetingofthe Terrace Council and representatives f1•om the various fraternities on the campus l<~.st Wed- nesday, all of the groups pledged themselves to contribute 50 7o of their men to the cause of reviving the dying sports at Union College. Just what is to be accomplishe<ii by such agi- tation is hard to say. It represents energy clumsily misspent. Colleges are f<:mnded upon courses in the pursuit .of knowledg-e, not upon athletic organizations. Organized. athletics are developed after the colleges, as healthy activ- ities in which the students were inte1·ested, and for the average undergraduate they have never become the primary object of four years of work preceding· the award of the sheepskin. They have always been extra-curricular activ- ities, with the marked value of such. But if men m·e no longer interested in athletics, then the athletics must suffer; they cannot be xarn- med down the throat of the student. Extra-curricular :work has a value in the development of the college student, and college athletics form an important phase of this work, but never;..the-less there are other forms of ac- tivities besides athletics. The ex.tt·a-cunicular work in the main is of value to the student only as it is born of a spontaneous and healthy interest, and there is no use of forcing a man into a niche where he will not fit. Let men be encouraged to participate in outside activities in general, and those who are fitted for places on the squads will assume them, while those who are fitted for some other form of activity will also find places. Thus groups will not be cluttered up with disinterested material, the time of the coaches will not be wasted on un- suitable men, and there will not be the useless expense of outfitting unwieldly squads. There has been some unfavorable comment on the action of the faculty in requiring two years of gym work. In reply to this it can only be pointed out that the requirements of l.Jnion in gymnasium work during the last few yea1·s have been far below the average amount of work in other colleges. There have been no changes in the eligibi'l- ity rules as a result of the meeting of the Ter- race Council with the students' activities com- mittee of the faculty to .eonfer upon these rules. The faculty evidently still intends to keep those out for athletics up in their work. even at the ;risk of losing men to such a degl!ee that' the teams are materially weakened. It was found, however, that the rules in use at Union .are no THE.

But when it comes to auy attempt .to make athletics the vital and essential function of a college we strenuously object. We ask why not have a sales- manship campa·ign for members of the clubs, the :band, the musical clubs, the publica,tions ancl all the other extra-curriculum activities here at Union? The answer is ob,·ious. ~===::=::=::=:=::=::::::=:= ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~;! Corner State and Broadway For a moment let us briefly consider the h,istory of the rise in prominence of athletics. Some years ago this country suddenly became possessed ,of the mens sana in corpore sano theory. A wave of enthusiasm in athletics at that time met a real and vital need. But gradually the idea was commer:cia.Jized and capitalized for the benefit of the few and' at the expense of the many. :\nd in the last few years the conception has stormed the doors of universities and colleges, not without results which threaten the very foundations and purposes of higher education. In other words, sports have risen to such an importance that they would command more attention from students than the pursuit of knowledge. It is our opinion that education is Life itself and not preparation for Life. The word education is de- rived from the Latin educare, to educate, which in turn is from edllccrc, which means to lead .out, to draw forth. Is not, then, our purpose in pursning higher education to attempt to acquire knowledge, to be 'led forth, to gain experience so that we may better cope with the many situations which we have only commenced to meet in this Life? To be sure, extra-curr·iculum activ- ities provide many of the experiences which we will eventually meet, yet education is first essential and should be considered as such by every student. vVc maintain that ev('ry student should strive for a balance between extra-curriculum activities and studies, but with favor to the latter, the purpose for which he should be in college. Furthermore, we believe that if a student does not wish to engage in any outside activity, he should not be forced to do so. It is entirely a prrsonal matter, one of likes and dislikes. If memory serves us correctly, in the play \Three Wise Fools\ there is a line which runs something like this: \True education is learning to do the thing that yon don't want to do at the time you do not want to do it.\ Here we seem to contradict our platform, bttt note there is no thought or hint of the word \com- pulsion\ in that line. So let us continue to have the varied program of .athletics at Union and let us have the athletics the men desire. I£ the student body does not support hockey, fencing, soccer or any other sport, kt us do away with them. Let us have sports for the men and not mrn for the sports.

No other word in the language has such a far -away sound. The old writers used to amuse them- selves byimaginingaland whereevery- .thing was topsy-turvy; where people walked on their heads, built their houses upside down, and where the trees grew into the earth, spreading their roots in to the air. And we of the north still feel a certain straNgeness about these regions when we read of their cold, blustering Julys, and their rose-cr-owned J anuarys, -merely a sign of our own provincialism, no doubt. As a matter of fact, the real Antipo- des are very much a partofthemodern world. In Australia and New Zealand small towns are growing in to cities, the cities are constantly being embellished with huge new buildings equipped with the latest type of Otis Eleva- tors. One of the old writers we have spoken of would doubtless ask if the elevator men in the Antipodes say \Up!\ when the·elevator is descend- . d \D I\ h ' . . mg an own. w en 1 tIs mountmg. No matter how topsy-turvy the other side of the world rna y be regarded by some, the fact remains that Otis Elevators are accepted quite casually and do their daily work in antipodal buildings.

Iloek well 'J.'UESDAY, MARCH G, 1928 Whencvc:t- education is discussed very few ref- erences are made to its incidental function of de- veloping pet-sonality. Thinkers clash over the duties of inculcating character, ideals, and train- ing for prodl!ction, but very few mention the in- evitable by-product of true education-personal- ity. It appears that the American educational environment today tends to discourage its devel- opment. Tl1is is just another way of saying that it militates against any bene:fit being obtained from iiltelledual adventure. Let us consider a concrete e::xa.mple. In elections of all sorts, what man is neve!~ .ovet·lookcd? The haz~rd of generalization in answering such a quesi:ion should be appreciated. Yet we dare to spec:ify the man who either lacks person- ality or whose personality conflicts least with those around hi111. Bring on exceptions; yet we main- tn.in thn.t the man who invariably gels what he is after in college is that one who generally accepts the stat11s qz.~o, generally accepts the facts .of life passively. Be is a good man, of course, and he l'a,n alw~ys be <;ot,mted Qn to sene on a committee. He listens. ::Bu,t he seldom volunteers an opinion, he does not lead-he lacks personality, though he is £requemtly labelled \a quiet person with a pleasing pet•sonality.\ - - - = !=====-- =- ~et The Grecian Dreaml I = -- As cveFy one else has commented upon the meeting called by the Terrace CouncH la;st Wednesday noon relative to better support for athletics .perhaps it would be wcH if w~ tuade our r.ema~ks on that subject few and hrief. \\'c might say that tire a·ims were good but their tnarksmanship poor; t-hat is the meeting proceeded .on a false supposition that a ,fraterni-ty president can control the members of his fraternity. Just a!lk any of them i.f it can :be .done. It can'·t. * * * * But Moby Dick covered the meeting pretty thor• oHghly and fina:J:ly ·suggests as a •solution the abolition of some of the sports. A fine idea but .try to do ~t. Abolish soccer and immediately all the shin .kickers in the college become enthusiastic over soccei:. ''I'he athletic authori-ties immediately become tyrants, squelching soccer for the purpose of exploiting .another sport. 'Dhe soccer team that was kicking over the S!1lallness of its appropriation a few days before, and growling abe:mt not having more shoes, immediately becomes an outraged body clinging desperately to that undesirable appropriation, which was too small to be ' of any value. As soon as the Athletic Board stops buying three or four lacrosse sticks for every student who wants to wave a club ar01,md his ·head, ,the Athletic board is accused of trying to suppress lacrosse. Because every candidate for the track team is not handed a new warm-up suit and a few pairs of spiked shoes the .first day he comes out, the Athletic Depart- ment is being accused of stifling athletic ambitions. Because everyone who goes out for a few days for any sport is not handed a .gold medal for doing so, the College is all wrong. And then the outraged, and much abused students rise up in anger and say, \Let's have athletics for all!\ \Vhen the intra-mural athletic program is ready .to be run off, these arm\chair: warriors sit in their chairs .. ' and razz, or sit in the bleachers and razz the teams. \Let's have athletics for all!\ A fine idea, but most of these ardent supporters of \athletics for all\ seem to consider sleeping as the best form of athletics. The c0llege, has to a degree, however, taken the advice of these parlor athletes, and instituted athletics for all Freshmen and Sophomores in the well known gym classes, Immediately the howl of the poor abused students, They have to take some exercise, which in- terferes with their armchair athletics. The students are being suppressed and imposed upon. \Let's have athletics for all!\ they holler, but then say \Yeah that's all right for everybody but me. I should be exempted from them.\ Yes, we agree with Moby Dick, that perhaps there arc too many sports at Union, but we don't see where the clipping action is going to start, if it is desirable to clip ssme of the sports. * * * * The finals in the beer suits versus blazers contest have not been nm off yet. Announcement is expected momentarily. * * * * A fe'v days ago, an alumnus visited Union for the first time in forty years and attended the chapel ser- vices. He was of course duly impressed by the Sopho- mores in the rear of the chapel who created such a noise tha.t the service was interrupted. It is not neces- sary to he an aclvocate of compulsory chapel, in order to maintain gentlemanly decQrum in chapel or any place of worship. The least otic can do is act the part of a gentleman while in chapel, even if it is .a different and unusual procedure for some. By AN'TISTOPHANES Such a .rnan has not fully realized his educa- tion. I£ he lad, he would accept issues actively. He would .n~t be so uniformly popular because his opoinions would not always be in accord with those a1·ound him (and college men are seldom above taking such .differences personally).

MARCH 9. 1928 THE COLLEGE MAN: HIS RELIGION Students do not enter college with a consciously chosen religion. They come to college with an inherited religion which they had accepted more or less without question. Consequently, they are unprepared to meet any side-sweeping attacks upon the formality, dogmas and superstitions which usually enshroud their faiths. Scepticism is awakened and developed early in college life l1ecause it is necessary in the search for truth. Religion is then confounded by under- graduates with the mo1·e material things that are studied, and the same scepticism that is used to question theories in physics and chemistry is also used to test the spiritual: religion. As a result, religion, for the moment, suffers. From out this healthy scepticism, however, most college men arise with a strong belief in the finer ethical prin- ciples of l'eligion, yet, without definite desire to be known as a member of any religious sect, be it Catholic, Protestant or Jewish. For most intelli- gent men agree it is religion that lives on in man while religions die. Does a college education destroy religious be- lief? A liberal education defines and strengthens religious belief because it aids the student to better evaluate the principles by which he will form his attitude towards life, which is another term for religion. A college man desires the simple faith in good- ness and righteousness without the hullabaloo that one is to do good because it is the means of going to heaven some day. This is the world we live in. What interests the undergraduate is a knowledge of how to live the good life here. The college rnan believes that too much attention is usually given to the outer forms of worship and little attention to the cultivation of the few- there are only a few·-principles of good living and the attainment of spiritual contentment. To those wl10 look upon the college man as the source of greatest danger to our conventions, we point out that although in his freshman year an undergraduate is tempted to give up many conven- tions and even his own 1·eligion as he meets the first wave of intellectual scepticism, by the time that he has attained his last year in college, he has come to realize the necessity of convention, the necessity of organized religion and other such in- stitutions, for some people. He does not want them destroyed. But for himself, he would rather have less of convention in his life and more sin- .cerity and naturalness, less organized religion and more personal good standards of living.

H you ·consid·er the dictum \athletics for ail'; in the mandatory swse, Sure it's the bunk. No man .is going- out for an activity if you stand :him in the corner, ,point your finger at him and say, \You gotta git for the ping--pong team now.\ But if you show the advan- tag-es in pa•rticipation of extra-curricu:Ia.r activities to him, he's ten times more likely to get a·ll enthused and go ollt, Now where yen got us wrong is that you oppose giving ev.ery man in Union the opportunity of engaging in some athletic competition. Well', we rather approve of the idea of ptttting an English ·on the sports here. Give the 111en .the opportunity to participate and, if they don't accept, take it away. While we would prob- ably have more sport activities and need more equip- ment, we ho11es tty believe bigger and hettct varsity teams for the intercollegiates would be developed. Of course, such a crazy idea could not be sat down •on ·by the co'Hege in a moment, exactly as this fifty per centllln bt1siness ·cannot relieve the aola,rming sport situ- ation in· a second. But we wager you the time is com- ing when there will be only morning cbsses here, thus leaving afternoons free for the men to take advantage of any activity they want, studying, sports or .other- wise. Just so •long, however, as the Temple of Health paraphernalia is invoiced, team roll-call taken and fel- lows drive right home following classes our Utopian dream will not be realized. ·But to ,get ·back to the affairs as is and will likely continue to be, this whittlin' process you spoke of. Yea, that's what's bothering us too. vVhere you going to start? Deny a man a right and he immediately craves it more than ever. No one wants to be among the limbs which must be hacked to make the trunk strong. Did you ever stop a moment and try to count up our nurne~ons sports? You haven't got enough fingers on your two hands for that. And how many of them are receiving support from the student body they merit? Not over one-half or two-thirds at the most. Yet g-iven proper backing and equipment they would tlnivc. 'Po be worthy of further continuance tl1ere mnst be deserving support on the part of the students and sufficient equipment. This applies not only to athletics but also to many other \weak sister\ activities on the campus. Sooner or later we must choose between a general participation in activities by most of the stndents, or else concentration in a com- paratively small number by a .few me.n. 1'he sooner we decide the better. And those parlor athletes you mcn.tion. They're :rll right when it comes to post-contest discussion and cussion, yes sir. But just the merest suggestion that th.ey might serve the interests of Union in addition to holding down a study room chair, the parlor athletes they raise mighty cries of negation. Better let them sit on their cushions, they .don't know what they're missing. Suppose yeu'll be at the Spring Sports pep meeting next Tuesday night in the Union. You'd better come and see l1ow many new spring sports have sprung up already with this warm weather. Mebbe some ·have died a nattt~al death. Who knows? Yours, MOBY. * * * Tomorrow will witness three of the Garnet teams in action. The second annual Union College invitation track and field games on the board track should he an intercst·ing meet to see. The two-mile intercollegiate ~clay between Lafayette and the Garnet will no doubt be the .center .of interest. The Maroon quartet appears here with no defeats in three years of competition. In .t11e WaJ!ace T. Foote pool the swimming team meets Cornell. And at night the basketball team winds up its season against the Alumni. This final contest for the quintet should prove fast and interesting and Coach Hardman's hoopsters will have to extend themselves if they trim the old grads. DICK. desiring tl1ese tbings for himself, he is nevertheless convinced tlw.t he must help to keep up the con- ventions and organized religion for those who need , . it to fit them into our social life. We arc glad to note that some other way has been found to attract students to Union besides a description of our athletic prowess. To distrib- ute The Idol to high schools as a representative institution of Union college is a sign of an intel- lectual movement on the campus that is highly gratifying. At least the contents of the literary magazine will outlive any athletic record that we may establish during any one year. And accord- ing to many alumni, faculty and undergraduates,, . the literal'Y output of the first issue is a credit to : any college and pa1:ticularly to Union College. . .,-M. M. E.

Perhaps the closest battle of all will be seen in the 70 yards low hurdles when Stollwerck of Colgate, metro- politan hurdles champion, and Tl10mp- son, former New England A. A. U. champion meet. If the latter is in condition, the battle is sure to be tough. Records Due to Fall Three records are slated to fall dur- ing· the course of the meet. Captain Totten, starting from scratch, will try to better McMillan's ma·rk of 10:07 £or the twa-mile run. McMillan is en- tered in a specia·l mile run and he will try to better Kilpatrick's record of 4:5r 2-5 for that distance. He will also be clocked at the half-mile post, wl1ere it is expected he will have beaten Kilpatrick's mark of 2:09 3-5.

Ma.uger \J.1UESDAY MARCH 13, 1928 The Te1~1•a.ce ·Council has decided upon drastic action concevning Student Body meetings because of the lack ·o:f interest and attendance. The test case next l\fcnday, however, will be of no avail if the seats ue not filled fo.r the meetings follow- ing. Therefore the threat of regular mar'king must stand permanently. ['hose who do not wish any activity,:; scholastic, rel·igious or extra-cur- ricular, \I•auJmed down their throats\ may have their conv·idi()ns weH founded, There is no deny- ing, though, that the situation .calls for some such radical action as the th1·.eat of th~ Terrace Coun- cil. The old ~1·guments against compulsory cl!apel will probably he hashed and rc1lashcd on the cam- pus and ap.;lied to this depa.rture in student gov- ernment pl'~cedure. The ma.in result of the Coun- cil's decisi()n, pel'haps, win !be a se1·ies of interest- ing gathering-s which are, d'oubtless, all that can be hoped f{)lr anyway. 1 The stell.acr sportsmanship of two of Coacl1 Bruce's run:ners was, in the minds of many~ the feature of .the Second Annual Indoor Track Games held ()ll. the board track •on Alexander field last Saturd~iY- The action of these two men in consenting to withdraw when, in the one case, there was a certainty of .a ,first prize medal and, in the other,. practically a surety of a prize win- ning perfor111~nce, is to he commend~d highly. The times of these men seem to prove that they would have scored in their events even if they had been Cot'l•e~tly placed by the handicapper and the other meet ·officials. Seldom, indeed, is ther,e found such a display of good fellowship and sportsmansl1ip .as exhibited by these two track- men. E. S. B. TilE :cONCORDlENSIS, TUESDAY, MARCH 13, l928 §a :a ~ ILet The Greciau Dreaml i -- -- -- - -- -- ,=- == i == -: Someone in the P. S. Department suggested that the snowballs be confined .to the f1:osh to· the e:xclusion of the windows. A member, ()r rather members of th·e Te~race Council made similar suggestions; with the resul.t that more widows \IWel'e broken yesterday and than any day this winter, B·roken windows brought :forth a contribution to this column so it at least hadi rone good result. The le.tter follow:s: To Antistophanes: I wonder ·whether it ·is some ferm .of perversion, sadism, or something Hke that, •Or whether it -is plain unadulterated ignorance .that is responsible for the plunking out of the window ligb.!s in the P. S. seminar r-oom when the freshmen are s'tlbjected to a snowh,;dl barrage. ;r suppose that I am an old .calamity howler to be throwing a wet :blan:ke.t on this childish .pleasure, but it is rl!:ther annoying to :It a·ve your seminar and study mom and yaur books ·on ,the table littered with snow and broken glass to provid':e .this seemingly neces- sary a·nd imbecilic pleasure. I \V.ould he willing to ovetil.:~ok a ·stray shot once in the while but the shots that put out these thirteen window lights weren't stray <>nes at aU-they were well directed. The sad part of .it all ·is .that men sup- pasedly of college intelligence :are .guilty ·of .this assi- nine wanton destruction. And this :isn''t the first time it l1as happened. It has occtured on several occa- sions before. I can:'t imagine any.thing more child- ishly vandalistic, more colossally stupid, or more lowl(Y ignorant than this. And done by men in college. Well, as Percy Marks wrote in \The Plastic Age\ . , . \If college men are the cream of the earth, God help the skimmed milk!\ Amen, I say to that. P. S. 4· * * .,., Anyway the seminar rooin looked like the Second Battle of the Marne had been :fought there, and one might think from appearances that al)i debates and argu- ments of the P. S. 4 students were not verbal. To date however there have been no casualties reported in that dass though threats of :annihilation ·have been aimed at some members. * * • It seems to be a habit with ·some students to do what they are ·requested not .to. d'o. Perhaps it would be a good idea for someone to .s11g'gest that they ~~Aep ' · awa.y from the 11iver. * * • Perliaps if the Terrace Council should suggest that students keep away from student meeting, .tJi~ attend- ance would be better. Such a method ·has not been tried as yet, but the reverse method is now. bei~g tried·. If more students do not attend! •the student meetings, years ago nearly everyone wen:! to student meeting there will be no student meeting. to attend.

Smit.h Desk Editor ------------------------------------1. C. Werl~ Issue Manager------------------------------R. E. Rockwel: FRIDAY, MARCH 16, 1928 IMPETUS One inevitable outcome of the new interpreta- tion of the 'lb-race Councilman will be increased competition in undergraduate activities, and espe- cially in those concerned with student govern- ment. The typical candidate for the coveted honor in the past depended entirely upon sheel' personality coupled wi-th a confident acquaintance with fraternity politics to advance what 1ame1s he may or rua.y not have gained on the athletic field to an undeserved prominence. The renovated constitution, radical though it may appear in its initial application, can not fail to restore sus- tained effort in every branch of student activit~ to a par with proficiency in sports. . , The anaeiUic support accorded certam ma,)Ot' campus acti-vities during the present college yea!' has been the source of incessant criticism from both alumni and faculty. The lack of a brilliantlr climactic future in those organizations has influ- enced numerous 'veak-willed genii to a state or dormancy insofar as the expression of their nat- ural resources is concNned. For the average college man, there is no recognition superior to that of the college letter with its monopolizing sug- gestion of higher honor. Interest in student government on the campus has been nearly annihilated by fraternity politics. There will always be a certain a-mount of deals on any college campus. But, the new method of .se- lection of members, by its curbance of saleable objectives, defies machine politics even in such well-develo11ed models as our own. SPRING SPORTS The prevalent misconception that the spring sports boom is an attempt of the athletic depart- ment to force active participation upon the stu- dent was efFectually dispelled in the Terrace Council smoker Tuesday night. The appeal which the leaders presented embodied suppot•t for love of amateur sport and requested deletion of support resulting from a contorted ;Sense of duty. The physically unlit man who persif?'tently ~ntr.UJle,s upon a coach's time and attention is as detri~erttai. to the success of a team as the demure Herculean who finds it less trying to conjure glory .out of contemplation than to test his native endowment against the sporting standard. S. V. S. ~ :§===================!~ § =-- -- i j What They're Doing i J == = Lo and .behold, after we had ,given up aU hope o-f ever receiving any communications, especially around this time when we are about :to -relinquish our reins on thi·:s space, we find two in the mail. When it rains it pours. One was from an out-of-town alumnus -who wa..s of the opinion that the time was not ·quite ripe for -us to be taken to the gallows and hung at sunrise. T'll.a-nk you, Mr. Alumnus, for :giving us a few more hours to inhale the intellectual breezes which blow about -the campus, not inf:requen-tly:. If our attempts to . ha-ve not only the students but also the alumni sense more clearly con:llicts which arise occas-ionally in some phases of the campus life, particulady athletics, have b~en .r,ead, oHr efforts in writing th-is column h:we not been in vain. Brick..:bats or ~bouquets, commun-ications ave always welcome. In -the second letter we find there is a desire f9i' an addition to the list of all-year activities. We prin-t it herewith: D·ear Moby: The writer is interested in the stimulation of bowling, not so much as a sport, but tor the value that may be derived in the building up of tne physical structure of Union men. With that i11. mind, I hereby cha,Henge all-comers for the one-man bowling championship of the college. A. H. F. Come <:me, come all, ye enthusiasts. We shall be p'!t:>ased .to take care of all replies to this challenge. Officials &'alore, splendid races, keen competition aJI:d some students brought the indoor track season to a close last Saturday after-noon. The deluge of snow, which threatened to annihilate all resemblances of a board track, stopped in time to permit the games to continue as per schedule. The newspapers ·said the st.aonds were full. Yes, two of them. And how. Which reminds us of the story of the negro dominie who had m.ova:ble seats placed in his sanctum sanctorum. If he knew his congregation was -to be lar.ge, he placed ~he seats close together. But jf he had a hunch his con- gregation was to be small, he left plenty of mom between the seats. The Union swimming team brought its season 'to an end last Saturday by defeating Corne-ll. This \vin was tl-ie only one of the year for the Garnet mermen. In t:~.lking with one of the members of the Red team we found out some very interesting facts. Swimming is n<>t a recognized sport at Cornell. The coaching is d<>ne by a student and, furthermore, the team mem- b-ers pay all their expenses on trips and arrange all 1neets. \Ve wonder just how many of the sports at Union which are not paying for themselves financially 117ould continue to exist, if tl1e members of the squads 1vere required to bear the expenses. We suggest that ifuis plan might be given a trial here to determine w•hether or not some of our teams deserve continued Sl.lpport, Much speechifying, lusty yells, a few songs and fewer students ushered in the Garnet spring sporting season at the Union Tuesday night. In some respects tlhe pep meeting, sponsored by the Terrace Councli. 117as a success. The Union spirit of yore staged a- par- -tial come-back. That, at least, was gra:tifying. But the disheartening part of it was that less than twenty p-er cent of the student body broke away from its pres\ ent state of inertia to attend the meeting. Freshmen, tne band, and the Garnet Goblins were conspicuous by their absence. It is an old Spanish custom here at Union that freshmen a1·e required to attend all general student affairs, such as pep meetings. As a grande finale Tuesday night the Alma Mater was sung. Some- one started the second verse; a few· sang it, while the majority present hummed along 'til the chorus. The fllird verse was not attempted. Criticism of the Mon- d.ay student body ·meetings perhaps has been justified, ro be truthful, very little has been done at them this rear. But next Monday comes the test. The least that we might do at student body meetings is to prac- tice singing three Yerses of the Alma Mater. All of vvhich goes to prove the sooner Union men learn to \live\ Union, and not merely classes alone, the· better.

TUESJ:>AY, MATICH zu, 1~28 La~t Wl'ek the Terrace Council made another of its Jll'J·iodiral threats aimed fo arouse the dying inll'l'l'st in StudL•Itt Bod_v met'ting,;. .Although not t•ntirl'lv successftrl, the tlu-e~d was not. without diect, .and yPslerduy tlwre wt•re a few more than usual at the l\Ionday gathering. IIowcvcJ\ the Council umvittingly crrnted a far greall'I. intl'l'l'st in the meeting by developing a new topic for discussion in -its revision ef the Ter- racP Council constitution IJr{)dding for tlw in- creasl' in membership. The purpose of this action, we take it, is to ma1\e the org1wization more >I\t'pre- scntativc of campus. aetivities and to eliminate thr effects of student politics. The original council was ln.rger in proportion to tlte Student Bedy of the time, and included men from a greater range of adivi ties than docs the }Jresent council. Tlw attempt to return to this uniwi·sal scope is a laudable step, and we hope for its success. But the advantages resulting- fr·om the sugges- tion of the Coun.cil that seven men be tapped and two dected, thus increasing- tl1e proportion of those tapped, are more difficult to see. In spite of the fact that the organization was founded by the senior class of 190G, the Terrace Council is now the executive gro11p of the enti-re Student Body, and the sh1dents should he u.Howed a greater voice in the selection of thci-1· rcprescntatins. Th(' organization is now intended to exist as a govern- ing body, and not another campus soricty. \Ve cOiwratulate the Council urlon its worthv <\> • aims in endcav:oring to wrench out the cffeds of student politics, hut of the success of these aims, we arc doubtful \'11e1·ever .one finds a college campus, one finds a crrtain amount of politics. The very life <Jf the student activitiPs on the campus seems to be fused wiH1 polities, and try as we will, there ltas as yet iheen fmmd no -very cffedive way of ·eliminating the evil. One deplorable aspect of the Terrace Council as it exists today is the lack of responsibility which it is ahl~ to command from the Student Body, as was shown by the behavior of the under- graduates after the Student Body meeting last 1\londay. If the students wish to have somebody take the responsibility of representing the under- graduate body in its rdations with the college, the least they can do is to allmv :these men s01i1e dig- nity in their office -after they .are chosen. With the pulJ!ication of tbe schedule for elec- tives, all sophomores and juniors should be seri- ously consideri'J1g their courses for the coming Somrth·ing was said con.cerning -the constitution of that stone-seat councH and the right of that constitu- tion to be changed withou-t consulting the student >bod,y. The student body was in-formed that the Terrace Coun- ci-l had a right to change its c-onstitntion brcause it ne\·er had .one betore, that is no one ever found one . I-t was suggested that if the T'en:ace Council were .the governing body of the students, the students should have somet·hing to say about any such -constitution. To this it was ·replied that because no one had ever found the constitution it didn't say .that ·one did not Pxist, ;u1d that the Terrace Council had a right to l'hangr its non-existing constitution as it .pleasrd. Be- sides the Terrace Council was .founded by a senior class and not by the student body at lar.gr and therr- fore, the studrnt body at large had no control ovrr the Terrace Council. * * * \\\hereupon one rose and said if the studPnt body . ,_-, had no <:ontrol m·er the Terrace Council, the procPss was redprocal and the Terrace Council slronld have no right to control the student body. It is not .for us to argue whether thP Council ·has this right. It mrrrly nerd be observed that right or no right, they ha\·e very little control. * * * This student governing committee among othrr duties which it has taken unto itself or acquired or received since 1906, has elrcted to sec to the enforce- ment of the freshman rules. You know, such rulrs as freshmen shall speak to upperclassmen, and freshmen shaH attend student meetings. Yes, thrsc rules are still in the handbook. Yesterday while this august body was defending its powers in student meeting, a group of twen or twelve frosh held a meeting all their own in the engine('ring building. It was too much bother to go to student body meeting. They even ad- mitted it. Besides no one makes freshmen go any more. frosh don't have te do much of anything now. * * * \Veil, anyway, there is one good result. Probably there wiH be a few more at student body meeting next week to hear what the band of leaders, foreordained by the class of 1900, has to say next week, and to hear what is to be done about amending that non-existing constitution, by which the student body is to be gov- erned. It is great to know that the class of 1906 de- creed for all eternity a governing body for the poor unsu~pecting students. * * * Only five window glasses smashed yesterday. The Terrace Council didn't attempt to exert its mythical control, and the number of fractures decl'eased about 16o.%. But there is a solution to the problem. We have brrn informed that window breaking could be stopped in five minutes. The .details of the plan were omitted so we can't pass it on. * * * The beer suit and blazer battle was fought to a finish last week. The blazers won, and accordingly everyone has forgotten that a class costume was ever considered. Prace reigns supreme. By ANTISTOPHANES. year.

Mauger FRIDA.Y, MARCH 23, 1'928 It is now a score of years since the inception of the Ichabod Spenc~r Lecture Series at Union. In that time we have had manv notable lecturers upon a va1·iety of subjects. ·But is that enough along that line? Conceding the point that the lectures have served and are serving an admirable purpose, are t11ey complete in their scope? Upon close analysis they may be found to be too limited both in their frequency and _in their subject mat- ter. Then, too, there is the added circumstance of some lectures not having a very great appeal to the students. Without desiring in the least to detract. from the excellent and authoritative pre- sentation of Professor Dougherty's on Assyrian Art, the fact must remain quite obvious to us that very few of om· Student B0dy is captivated by such a subject. Is it not true on the other hand that Professor Driesch, speaking on a sub- ject of more potent interest, of modern contro- versy, inspired quite an impressive turneut of the student group? What does this signify? Does it not give rise to the thought that the students are and would be quite receptive to speakers on subjects of more vital interest? It is not our intention to alter or reconstruct or in any way to injure the dignity of the Ichabod Spencer lectures. But there is a definite need for something supplementary to this course. It is true that we also have another lecture series but the time presentation prevents general attendance. The college should undertake to augment these lectures with another series in the nature of a forum. This would provide not only informa- tion but would also give rise to discussion. The forum should be liher~l in its scope, providing and encouraging a presentation of a multitude of sub- jects of economic, philosophic, and scientific inter- est. When subjects of a controversial nature are presented and if the two sides are to be presented separately it would of course be .tl1e rule to have the dates for their presentation as close together as possible or ha,•e them both together in order to present their views in the na±Ul·e of a debate. Th.is might appear to be a rather feeble sug- gestion in view of the fact that several forums already exist in the city. These, however, mean very little to the Student Body, either because of their lack of familiarity with the organization sponsoring them 0r because curricula,r activities intefere with their patronage. If t'he college would undertake this we also could not hope for 100 per cent response but it could be arranged to provide for the greatest possible participation. A suggestion as to how this could be consummated is in order. We believe that a very nominal charge added to the tuition fee .of each student as well as a nominal admission charge to the public at large, the same as is being done at the average fot•um, would amply provide the income necessary for the expense of obtaining ·men who are pre- eminent in their fields as designated above. It is to be hoped that the Student Bod~ will give this a little sober thought. Can we be so resi~ed to genera.! r9utine Qn the ca.mpus that ... THE CONCORDIENSIS, F-RIDAY, MARCH 23, 1928 ' ·J: .. 1:_1 i!=W.=: =ha=t==Th=i e=y=,~=e =D=.•· o=.in=: g=· ~~ Of course, it is useless crying over ·spilled mHk or somctirncs digging up .the .past, ibut before the seas011 has faded too far in.to the p;ts•t, we 1ha ve a word to say about lwckey. It is. _lVeBckn:own that 'hockey 'is being received with increasing pop.ularity in both college and pr.ofessional spor.t worlds. It is logical that Union should wntinne to a·ugment her prestige in athletics by giving suppol't to this win.ter activity. But it is a fallacy to jud.gc .hockey as a sport at Union by the number ·Of games l}layed. Naturally the students are not going to lend suppor.t to ,puck con- tests if they are not played off. Furth-ermore, when ' games are played, providing they ta:ke place at a con- • 1 venient location, the student support would increase many-fold. This leads to the question of a hockey rink on' the campus. Five years ago the studen.t tennis courts were flooded and 11scd as a rink. Since the managerial de- pa.rtment of that sport failed to dispose of the ice at the end of the season, that .fact was given as an excuse for not having the tennis cotmts in condition at an ea·rly date in the sping, Consequently the hockey team shifted its scene of action to Central Pa·rk, where it has since more or ,Jess held ·forth each winter when condi- tions did not deem otherwise. The disadvantages, both to the squad members and the student body, of having the college rink at Central Park are obvious. In order to give hockey the support which it deserves, Union College should have a rink on the campus. W:hcther it b~ an inclos~d or open-air arena is up to the weather man. Early this winter Dartmouth faced th·c same question as to a choice of rinks. After searching the weather bureau files at Hanover for fifty years back, it was found that aU winter seasons, save this last one 1 indicated conditions were favorable for an open-air rink and this one was finally constructed. The past weather records of this locality would soon deter- mine which type of arena would be suitable to the requirements of Union. The fact remai'ns, however, that an inclosed rink, if needed, could not probably be had at once. But hockey could be greatly aided by an open-air rink, the labor and materials for which could be obtained for a sum of about one hundred dollars, By l1aving some sort of arena on the c.ampus probably more men would come out for the sport than have in the past four years and certainly the student body should offer better support. This matter of a hockey rink would not come under the direction of the department of physical train- ing and athletics, which .only safeguards the Parthenon of Physique, but rather under the jurisdiction of the Committee em Buildings and Grounds. Does the stu- den~ body wish to offer more support to hockey by indicating its desire for a rink? If so, let it dra>v up a petition to that effect at a Monday student body meet- ing and present it to th.e pr.o.pel.:' ~ommitte.e, with . the Terrace Council as interme<;liary. It is not too early now to commence advocation for a new hockey arena. MOBY DICK. we are af1~aid to entertain any suggestion con- cerning different procedure? Let's start the ball rolling. B. B.

Afte'r much discussion during wl1ich the Council made no effort to suppor-t its measure, the matter was tabled. A week lahr the Rtudent body saw a repetition of the same fa.rce.

The students have not as yet been able to dl'cide. It would seem that tl1e Tenace Council should be an honorary society, with certain control or powers delegated to it by the student body. The Council would act as sort or an .exectttive committee, at the request of the student body, to perform certain func- tions. ... ,. ,.

A course which will give men desiring a cultural ac- quaintance with the various art forms an understanding of the fundamental qualities of art. A previously ac- CJUired bad,grounu of ancient and me- cliaeval history -is helpful but not es- Sl'lltial. The course has been planned with a yinv to ~u~taining the interest and is carrinl on by lectures, the use of lantern slitlcs and the prints of the Carnegie collection and a stuuy of the \Cni1·ersity prints, a sd of which each stuucnt must buy but will not regret doing. Music r. The present course in Mu- sical Appreciation as given by Profes- sor Tidmarsh offers all the necessities which go toward helping one to like anu appreciate good music, the uni- versal language. Study of the elemen- tal forms of music is made, leading to the history of musical development after which various compositions are played on the college organ and ex- plaineu in detail. Recommended as an instructive anu entertaining course for the student who likes music or wishes to broauen the scope of his education. Not good for those who are tone deaf. Psychology I. This course is sup- posed to be a stuuy of the clements and simpler processes and laws of the mind but as now given would proye a ddightful three hours a week for Addison Sims of Seattle since it consists of facts, facts, and more facts of a highly· technical nature read 'from textbooks. The work has been given until it is now a jumbled mass with neither head uor tail. The course will, however, prove extremely practical if one can 111anage to master the princi- ples of human psychology without the au va lll'agt' uf lurid, spontaneous lee\ tures. Psychology 2.

It is necessary, therefore, to remember that the play was first .pre- sented to a people to whotn war was entirely a romantic pastime-a people who had not fought the enemy at close range for a century; to whom war meant galloping on ho!'Seback across an open £eld, sabre out, ],)1ume waving, all to tl1e accompaniment of loud cheers. If death did come, it was a glorious one, met gallantly at the cannon's mouth, while beautiful young ladies hundreds of miles away breathed languishing prayers for the soul of the departed hero. To such a people, Bluntschli's remarks wel'e disgusting, and critics voiced their dis- approval loudly and constantly. It only remained for Mr. Shaw .to re· fer them to l!alf a dozen prominent military authorities for endorsement of his facts. 'The Theatre Guild Company chose to interpt:et \Arms and the :Man\ rather as a burlesque than as a satire. -Whether they overplayed or not is a question, The stage di~ections which Shaw gives seem to indicate that he intended it simply as a satire. For the effective transference of tl;e idea to an audience, however, it was neces- sary to throw more into the li11es and stage business than the author indi- cated.

Anyone who has seen her play the part of the actress in Mol- nar's ':The Guardsman\ as well as that of Raina, will realize what a fine actress Miss Eldridge really is. She can play two .tota11y different parts with equal effect. Mr. March, in the part of Sergius Saranoff, was also excellent. His was the best oppor- tunity of the evening to burlesque, and he made use of that opportunity tellingly, Miss Alden as Louka, the servant girl who had not the soul of a servant, played extremely we11. Mr. Gaul's performance as Blnntschli fciJ rather below the standard of the other leading characters.

A regu- lar business meeting was conducted after the banquet. Dudley Smith and Harry C. Lamebrton, as scholarship committee, reported on the scholastic standing of the Southerners. Mr. Herbert Merritt noticed in his talk that the club is a rather unique or- ganization. People living away from home in various sections of the coun- try very rarely get together to any great extent. Following this talk, there was a dis.cussion on the pos- sibility of using ,;rushing\ schemes in order to get more Southern men here each year. The meeting .then proceeded to the election of officers for the coming year. The results of the election were as follows.: William F. Lanier, Jr., ,president; James E. Swan; Jr.; secre- tary-treasurer. B-oth the newly elected officers graduated from The Citadel, Charleston, last year and both are now affiliated with Kappa Alpha,

Croft, Jr. FHI.DA Y, 1\IAI.H'H 30, 192~ In o-rder to think intdlig-ently we first must have n problem. This fact <.'Xplains why th<.' Student Bod~· nwctings wer<.' almost relegated to the place among tiH' b:V·gon<.' traditions of Union Coll<.'gr. Tlwn• were no issues facing the under- graduntPs to solv<', or JWI'llaps \l'l' might bett<.'r sav no onP brought up any .issues before the studl•nts for their solutitm. ~a.turally, intellig<'nt stagnation sd in that lweame almost physical, as our athleti(' records show. The controversy over th<' proposed constitu- tion of the Term('e Coun('il was suf!ieient to pack the Old chapel twic<' thus far and cause the m<.'et- ing-s to run ov<'r the allottl'd thirt.v minutes d<'- spite tlw fad that some professors had threaten<.'d to mark absent the late-conwrs. Surdv this sac- rifice on the part of ::;ome students in staying late is a sign that, given issues, there will be plenty of so-called college spirit available. • With the constitution of the Terrace Council almost s<'ttled, since tlw committe<' that met with Counci.lmen has brought forth two solutions, one of whieh wiU in all probability be accepted by the undergraduates at their next meeting, it is imperative that new problems be bt~ought to light before the students for discussion and possible solution. The spark or intPrest shown by the students recently must be fanned into a flame of zeal preg- nant with pride in their Alma M a fer: a more gen- uine form of college spirit. We feel that there are a number of rough spots in the road ka.ding to the progress of Union College in the intellectual, physical and spiritual fields. Although these rough spots have been known to manv very little has been done to do away with th<'m and rarely has any mention of them been made in a Student Body :Meeting. There is the problem of apparent apathv of undergraduates toward intemational, national or even state issues. There is the apparent :kink in the undergraduates in supporting debating or any op<'n forum where issues confronting intelligent men could be discussed. The g-rowth of selfishness. that is festering in almost every corner of the campus as the cry of \what's in it?\ is shouted at every underta·king by students has some remedial cause behind it. Tl1is certainly is a major 'pr9blem. Where but in open debate can the lash of var.ied opinions finally bring out the truth and where is there a better place for such discussion than in a Student Rodv meeting? P~hlicity is conceded a big factor in securing applicants from which a college can select its enrollment. The Handbook states that Union has had a Press club since 1905 but manv believe that it does not exist if they arc to judge by all the publicity given to Union affairs outside of the Capitol District. This is also a seJ'iouH problem. Perhaps complete reorganization of the system used at Union will ma]{e the Press dub here com- parable in its results with those obtained by such colleges as Amherst, Williams oi• Hamilton. · ;Then there ate the courses o.ffered by the col- lege. Certainly there is room for improvement . ( \ { ·. t ..

L- ·. ; H The fourth annual scramble for fencing, boxing and wrest.J:ing awards was run .off in :the Temple last Tues- day night in a nmch more lively matmer t•han that which has chatacter·ized simHar C\'ents h1 yea•rs previ- ous. We never before realizrd so ma-ny students of ·l\.nion Col'lcgc ·c6u·ld find it possible to a-ttend a col- lege f.unction~thei:c was even a handfu-l of town meH present. Perhaps it may even ·be .possible ·to get a majority of the sHtd'cnt body out for the home base- baH games this spring if the undergraduates can find for theiHsrh·es a governing body .ca.pable of getti-ng the students behind the teams. Nevertheless, the bouts Tursday n.ight were most interesting and showed signs. o'f far more practice and skill in some eas~s than has been eddenced in any- previous fina·ls. The athletic dl'partment deserves a great deal of credit .for its efforts in .building u.p a class of indoor sports such as it has. Intramura-l con- tests ·have not, in the past, played the impor.tant part at Union ~hat they have in the majority of c01lcges, a taher deplorable fact, as interclass and interf.raternity meets are perhaps one .of the g.1:eatest factors. in build- ing up a bond of .unity and a common spirit in a col- lege. Every year at lJ nion, however, witnesses a greater interest a·nd enthusiasm. over the intramural schedules, and the students are realizing more and more that such schedules open a place for everybody, instead of only thr cream of the athletes, as is some- timl's more apt to be the case with varsity teams. There wl're one or two decisions in the fourth annua-l bouts in which we were unable to understand the attitude of the judges, a sentiment which seemed common among the observers, but the manner in which the student body accepted the rulings of the offi- cials was commendable. We noticed less crabbing· over doubtful results than t'Ycr before. Once again the matches included an event in .fenc- ing, afcter a year in which the sport has been dormant at Fnion. There was a renwrkflble degree of skill dis- played by the contestants considrring the short period in which they ha H had to develop, most of the squad consisting of new men out for the first time this year. In the season when the sport was dropped two years ago, there had been an intercollegiate schedule ar- ranged by those interested in -the activity, but before the matches materialized the team had ceased to exist because of a lack of equipment and the resignation of the coach. \Vith new coaching facilities and added equipment, there should soon be built up another team of intercollegiate caliber. But there always seems to be a catch to a good thing. On the way out of the Parthenon following the bouts we were asked ot put our mite in one of the wooden boxes on either side of the door, in orde1· to help send Olympic teams across the sea. But the cause is a worthy one, so we did not feel so badly about it after all. The Union track schedule is unique this spring in that it includes Olympic trials, the first of whch are to be held in New York on June 23 and the finals at Harvard Stadium on July 6 and 7. \V.e noticed the athletic departinent saw fit to clear Alexander field of the board track this year before any midnight student brigade carried it away piecemeal, as was the case last spring, If the weathet• man is good enough for the next two or three weeks, he may be able to counteract the effects of the antiquated drain- age system on Alexander field before the spring sport season commences. Because of the late start in prac- tice, both the baseball and lacrosse squads will remain here over the Easter recess to l_)ractice for their opGn~ ers with Colgate teams on Ap.ril 21. The batsmen will jc;mrney to Hamilton for their contest while the but- terfly chasers will play their initial game on home ground. MOBY DICK. here. The1•e is no doubt in many minds but that concerted action on the part of the undergradu- ates would make some of the courses that are almost a farce assume more dignity. Both pro- fessors and college officials welcome intelligent suggestions for improvements in the cunicula. In this respect .we feel that a course might be added that offered an unbiased study -of the big religions of today, There is no 1•eason why intel- ligent men, prompted as they are by the same religious instinct, should clash so. vehemently as they do just because of the mere difference m their outward expression of this instinct. A comparative study of religions, as il. comparative study of literature or biology, cannot help but integrate thinking men int~ a fraternal body gov- erned by the principles of good living that were advocated alike by Christ and Confucius, Buddha and Moses. · We have learned the lesson of stagnation. Let us find something to. do, to think J'eflectively about, to keep us spiritually alive. Let us clear the road to intellectual and spiritual progress·.

A well-planned pt·ogram of civic education will go to the heart of many of these matters and will increase the ranks of the politically intelligent. \The safeguard of democratic gov- <·rnmen t lies in the preservation of the opportunity to vote, and not in the 100 per cent exercise of that oppor- tunity.\ ---o--- CHASE CONCLUDES TALKS On Monday night, April z, Dr. Freshman numerals were awarded· Lewis Chase will give the third of to the following in football and bas- the series of Tristram Lectures in ketball: the Old chapel.
