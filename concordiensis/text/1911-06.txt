THE CONCORDIENSIS v·o\L. 3-± JUNE 17, 1911 NO. 27 UNION'S ONE HUNDRED-FIF.TEENTH COMMENCEMENT UNEXCELLED In Past and Is ·Great Success In Spite of Inter- mitt·ent Rain--- The Baccalau· reate Sermon. In spite of four days of almost continuous ra1n the one hundred and fifteenth commence- nlent of Union College was the most successful in the n.1e1nory of the oldest alum.nus that at- tended. Never before has such den1onstration of spirit and enthusiasn1 been exhibited by the alumni. Early Monday n1orning the graduates began to arrive in the city and register at the alun1ni headquarters in the Dean's office at the west end of the south colonnade. By night there were more than a hundred on the register and Tues clay, alun1ni day, witnessed a continual line of the graduates registering throughout the n1orning and part of the afternoon. The Baccalaureate. The l)togratn of the week opened Sunday eve- ning with the annual baccalaureate sern1on, de- livered by President Charles A.lexancler Rich- nlond. The service was held in the First Pres- byterian church. Rev. Fred Winslow Adan1s, pastor of the First Methodist church of this city, delivered the invocation. Rev. A. Russell Stevens on, pastor of the First Presbyterian church, offered prayer, and the Rev. B. W. R. Tayler, rector of the St. George's church, read a passa.g·e fron1 the Bible. Rev. Clayton J. Pot- ter, pastor of the· }'irst Refonned church of Schenectady, n1ade an earnest appeal for a large collection, which is devoted to paying the ex- penses of delegates to the Northfield Student Conference. The church was crowded in spite of the threatening weather, ·. which interrupted the set-vice by developing into a heavy thunder- shower. At tbe conclusion of the sermon, President Richn1011.d delivered the usual chage to the Senior class. It was as follows: \Gentlen1en of the Graduating Class: I have not much to add because everything- that has been said to,...night has been said directly, and spec.ifi cally to you, but I cannot let you go with- out a tnore intimate word spoken, as it were, in the boson1 of the fan1.ily. I wottld speak to you not at a distance, hut upon the comn1on footing of friends-for we have become friends in these two years we have been together. We have tried to do what we could for you. Few, indeed if any, will be the rnem.ories with any tinge of bitterness, but the n1e1nories of kind and help- ful intercourse will be abundant. You have be- t a vecl, with rare exception, as self-respecting- tnen should behave. You ha·ve learned each in his degree, son1e little-son1e much, but all of you have learned .son1ething, and this will soon be put to the test. The h.ighest lesson we have tried to teach you is the worth of tnanhoocl. We have tried to help you find yourselves. I do not warn you not to think of yourselves more highly than you ought to think, the cold world will take c~re of that-on the ~ontra.ry, I wottl(t encourage each one of you to believe in hilnself and to stand Ennly upon his own feet. Dare to be yourself. Yield not at all to the tyranny of tnajorities-- they are as often wrong as right. Be a voice and not an echo, and if yot.t becon1e wise and strong, ren1ember always the obligations of the strong. I need not say that we all wish you well and that our earnest prayers shall follow you. I speak for all the faculty and even for that friend and counselor whose lips are silent now, but whose spirit still seems to live a1nong us. \\Vherever you go y()U shall always be our boys, and when you corne back here frotn time to ti1ne in the years to co1ne we s l1all welco1ne yon as to your own horne. \As a last word let n1.e offer you as a guiding principle a text fro1n the Good Book: 'And what doth the Lord require ,of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk hurnbly with thy Gocl.'-Micah. 6-8.\

6 THE CONCORDIENS1S. GROVE AND CLASS DAY EXERCISES POSTPONED BECAUSE OF RAIN Fraternity Teas Make Up Only Activities During ·t.he D \D U \ \K A \ and ay- . . ., . ., \Psi U .\ Entertain. Monday morntng of commencement week dawned cold and stormy. It was seen from the first that it would be inadvisable to attempt hav- ing the usual grove and class day exercises in the college garden, so the program was postp~ned until Wednesday afternoon. Cards announc1ng the change in time of the exercises were posted about the campus, but not before scores of spec· tators had gathered at the N ott elm in the garden to witness the expected program. A student was sent to announce to the assemblage'the postpoae- tnen t of the program. Durin a the afternoon three of the fraternities b a-ave teas which resulted in a relay \tea-party'' 0 for the guests. Kappa Alpha, Psi Upsilon and Delta Upsilon fraternities were the hosts on these occastons. The Kappa Alpha lodge was artistically dec- orated with green boughs, oak and maple, and white flowers. The guests were received by Mrs. S. B. Coffin of Hudson, Mrs. E. D. Simmons of Glens Falls, and Mrs. Geradus Smith. At the table Mrs. Walter Briggs, Mrs. E. T. Lawsing and Mrs. L. Garnsey served the tea and ices. Mrs. Calahan and Miss Calahan served the punch. Those who assisted in serving were the Misses Sherman, Betts, Dunning, Gray, Stein, Montignani and Dennison of Albany, and the Misses Pear- son, Church, Clark, Lane and Moore of Sche~l­ ectady. The rooms in the Psi Upsilon house were at- tractively decorated with ferns, red roses anJ peonies. Those who assisted the members in re- ceiving and entertaining the guests were: 1\tit s. I B. F. Carmichael, Mrs. A. G. Veeder, Mrs. B .. A. Burtiss, Mrs. Garrett Veeder, Mrs. D. VV. \iV eed, Mrs. W. W. ,Baker, Mrs. James Parker, Miss Esther Van Slyck, and the Misses Patterson, Chamberlaine, Hillis, Hay, Moore, Hoagland, J\fc- Gregor, Glen and Bradt. In the Delta Upsilon house the fraternity colors were displayed in the table decorations, a great basket of yellow and blue flowers, and there were white roses on the mantels and other places for decoration. Those who received, presided at the table and assisted in the serving of refr.eshm.enfs were: Mrs. ,E. C. Whitmyer, Mrs. Robert J, Landon, Mrs. Olin H. Landreth, Mrs. Edward ElLery, Mr$. E. R.

Feature-Action on Death of Professor Ashmore. Tuesday was the big day for the alumni. Early in t:h.e morning the old graduates, and young ones also, began to assen1ble upon the campus. Never was there such enthusiasm shown as upon this day. Prominent at this time, as they were throughout the entire commencement week, were the metnbers of the class of r88r. There were twenty-six of these graduates of thirty years ago · and the spirit shown by every one of their num- ber was seen throughout the week's events. The distinctive costume of this dass induded white caps and gowns. Morning Program. At 9 o'clock were held the annual meetings of the Phi Beta Kappa, the classical honorary soci- ety, and the Sigma Xi, the honorary society of the scientific departments. At 10 a. rn. took pla.ce the tneeting ·of the Board of Governors of Union University.

Just before the alutnni tneeting occurred the first annual atumni parade. This is an innovation in cotnmencen1ent week, but proved to be an entire success, and so will d.oubtless be an im- portant part of future con~tnencement programs. Headed by a band of twenty pieces the reunion classes paraded the streets of the city and broke ra11ks on the campus, where the diffe1·ent classes, vvh·o were gowned in picturesque, and in some cases grotesque costutnes, were photographed by the official photographer. William Graham, of the class of r851, was grand marshal The Alumni Meeting. At the alutnni 1neeting of the General Associa- tion, whi.ch was held in the chapel, the following officers were elected for the ensuing year: James R. Fairgreave, '82, president; F. \IV.

Tb~ Class ~f Din~t~~n-EI~v~n. A..gain the old gray walls of Union college bid farewall to a graduating class. It is a class that averages in nun1ber, forty-nine,. with other classes in recent years. Once more it is seen that the graduates in the engineering courses exceed those in the acaden1ic departments-but the difference is not as marked as in the past few years. More than thirty-two per cent of the total number is divided an1ong the courses leading to the degrees of the bachelor of arts, bachelor of philosophy, and bachelor of science, each of which is a branch of the academic de- partlnent. It is with 1ningled joy ancl regret that the undergraduates bid farewell to the seniors; joy to know that their college-mates' goal of gradua- tion has been reached, regret that the loss of their influence and co-operation n1ust be sus- tained. Nineteen-eleven has been a class worthy of its Alma Mater. Many of its me1nbers have been active in promoting the welfare of the col- lege and they have been the means of estab- lishing precedents that will last forever. To each· we wish future success-success such as a ' . Union graduate seldom fails to attain. May you realize the ideals and ambitions that have doubtless originated during your college course and that have been fostered by your faculty and classmates. Union .. s C,omm~n~tm~nt W¢~k. As at every college and university, commence- m,ent week is the greatest of occasions at Union. It is a tin1e when a group of youn-g men bid farew·ell to their four years' harbor and lat1nch their ,craft of theory upon the tempestuous sea of practicalities. It is time when hundre,ds ·of mariners successful in the past,. dock their time-- tried. craft to indulg-e it) reminiscence of them- selves in the n1aking and to renew their ple.dges of loyalty to their Ahna Mater. . ' T'he recent co1nn1encen1ent has doubtless been the greatest ever held at Union. It cotnpletes anotht r year of sue cess under . President Rich- lnond. In1prove1nents have been seen in the cur- ricu1urn, in alu1nni -organizations, in finances, in athletics, and in the appearance o'f the campus. In short, there is not a detail of the institution that has ren1ained untouched, while advancement in all directions continues. The great success of Presidertt Richmond seems to be but in its in- fancy. There are doubtless unthought of de- ve1opn1.ents to be n1.ade as a result of his earnest and faithful labors in behalf of Old Union. NEW ALUMNI PUBLICATION.

About the gate, which is nearing completion, had been arranged several hundred chairs in the open.

The crowd· stretched far .out about the entrances ancl those eager for. ad1nission sheltered themselves fro1n the rain by the means of u1nbrellas. Though the picturesqueness of the outdoor ex- ercises was not present, the program as rendered in the chapel could not have been more lm- pressive nor. tnore appreciated under any other circumstances. Prof. Baker's Addref.s. George Pierce Baker, professor of dratnatic literature at Harvard university, delivered the principal address. Dr. Baker has an irresistably attractive personality and his address, co-mpre- hensive and detailed, was one of the most in- teresting ever delivered before a local audience. Not for a mon1ent did the scores of people, who were standing in all parts of the chapel, lose in- terest in the entertaining, instructive, and varied account of a n1an who has furnished a song that has brought solace to people of n1any tongues. Luquer. Gives Appreciation. Tha·tcher T. P.

The crowning feature of the program, the ab- sence of which would have left ah incomplete- ness not to be supplied otherwise, was the singing of the song, \Home Sweet Home,\ by Madame Ahna Gluck, the fatnous soprano of the Metro- politan Opera Company. The exercises had lasted more than an hour and the many people who had stood through the program, both men and women, were naturally somewhat fatigued; but the introduction of Madame Gluck, who is well known to Schenectady audiences, brought forth thunder·ous applause. The scene tiiat fol- lowed was the most impressive ever beheld in the college chapel. As the clear voice of the singer nroke forth in the words of \Home Sweet Hotne,\ a song dear in the hearts of every man, woman and child, and especially beloved by this audience, gathered to revere the memory of its author, there was a silence, unnatural in its in- tensity, that seemed to emphasize the sentiment contained in the lines. At the conclusion of the stanzas the aud·ience remained as if hypnotized, then, moved by a sudden reaction, burst into pro- longed applause that resulted in a repetition of the last stanza by Madame Gluck. Many of the audience were moved to tears and the scene is one never to be forgotten by those who wit- nessed it. ENTHUSIASM AT ALUMNI LUNCHEON GREATEST EVER KNOWN AT UNION Demonstration N etrer Before Seen at Annual Feast Arouses the Alumni-Parade About Drill Hall. At the conclusion of the dedication of the Payne memorial gate the alumni body marched to the State armory, where the annual alumni luncheon, which is given under the direction of Miss Mary Back~s, was held. On this occasion was seen the most remarkable evidence of Union spirit among the alumni that Schenectady has ever known. More than five hundred of Union graduates and friends seated themselves before the festive board that never presented a more attractive appearance. The luncheon was not long in progress before Madame Gluck, accompanied by Mi;ss Jewell, entered with Mrs. Richmond. At the sight of the singer the entire number of diners rose to their feet and broke into tremendous cheers. Old men waved theit handkerchiefs and in- dividual dasses gave their respective yells for Madame Gluck. As the applause subsided Pres-- ident Richmond announced that, for the benefit of those who were unable to hear Madame Gluck at the dedication exercises, she would render the fi·rst stanza of the song of \Hotne Sweet Home\ at that tim·e. The great assen1blage re- mained standing, while the words, enhanced in sentim·ent and beauty by the expression given them by her singing and by her charming per- sonality, floated through the vast drill hall of the armory. Applause that called for an encore resulted. Madame Gluck repeated the first stanza while President Richtnond led the audience and the entire body of men broke forth into the words. Following the luncheon the alumni formed by classes and marched about the hall with the band in the lead. As the line passed the speakers• stand where Madame Gluck was seated, the marchers waved a salute and were rewarded by a smile of appreciation from the sjnger. Cor- nelius Waldron, of the class of r8.<8, .erecf and sturdy, with just pride held high his card reading \ '48,\ and brought forth much applause as he passed the spectators, who filled the gallery and west side of the hall. The luncheon concluded with the usual speeches and the entire body adjourned to the campus where, thanks to the weather conditions, the an- nual A!lumni-'Varsity baseball game was played. The result of this at the end of the fifth inning, when playing ceased, was 3 to 2 in favor of the Alumni. The annual president's reception was held from 4 to 6 on this afternoon.
