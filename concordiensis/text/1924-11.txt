i. tHE CONCORDENSIS, TUESDAY, _NOVEMBER 4, 1924 Dr. Frank Bailey :Is Founder ! . I of Union's F;ina.n:cial Policy! , I I College Treasurer During Twenty~three Years of i Service H!as :Managed Affairs With Rare judg ... ! n1ent-· Pensonal Gifts Ex:ceed Those of AU ·Other Donors {EDITOR'S NOTE-This a-rticle was prepared with the idea of pre- senting to the studeHt body 1 {acts .about a man who has ·done n1uch ;for U niotl College.) Dr. Frank Bailey, treasurer of Un1on College, has been one oJ. the g-reatest factors in placi·ng the college in the firm financial po- sition which it BOW occupies. Taking charge of the college finances at a tiine when debt was threatening to take the historic institution out of existence, DL Bailey maneuvered the capita} of the college with such rare judgment that today Union CoHege is reported to earn a higher interest rate on its actual investments than any other coHege or university in the United States. Dr. Bailey .has duties which are fundamental and necessary to the maintenance of Union and to which is given .scarcely a thought. He must take charg-e of the capital and make it bear sufficient in- terest to support the institution, for the tuition paid by the students twice a year covers only a fraction of the necessary expenses. Another of his important duties is taking charge of the various legacies which have been left Union College by the alumni and friends. He must see that the terms of the legacies are fulfilled in a manner that will be most beneficial to the college. Union's Worst Period The events immediately preceeding the advent of Dr. Bailey are interest- ing, as it was then during a period of about 1'0 years that Union faced its most doubtful period; and these events furnish a background for the brighter achievements of Dr. Bailey. It was during this period that there ;was much agitation for the Femoval of Union to Albany, which had it been successftt would have probably destroyed th great wealth of Union traditions. In 1892 Gilbert K.. Harrou1i. was elected treasurer, and he began the upward movement in the college's fin- ances. Since the death of President Nott, the debt of Union hacl been growing larger and larger. The income from the students was reported to be at one time only $10,000 which was collected at irregular intervals. by the treasurer or his representative who made one or two hasty trips to Sche- nectady during the school year. Har- roun took hold of these conditions ancl took the first step toward putting the finances on a firm basis. It had been the custom for many years, in fact since shortly after the 'time of Dr. Nott's death, to mortgage a large track of land on Hunter's Point, Long Island City, to meet the cl.eficiency between the budget am 1 the small income from the students. The income from the Hunter's Point land was about just enough to pay the taxes ordinarily and meet any sma11 deficienry. · This ment that the college was b1·eaking even, but that the f?T<•unds huildings, laboratories, and teaching facilities were receiving litlle attention. Treasurer of Union College D,R. FRANK BAILEY Harroun saw this fact, and also saw success in the financial field. He was that to continue the former policy then president of the Guaranty Trust r with its great expenditures meant ruin. company from which he resigned but He then began a thorough over-haul- recently. He is president of the Realty ing of the finances and found that there Associates, Prud·ence company and the was only $25,000 a year to be counted Bensonhurst company and the as real income. He saw that to spend . firms. He is vice-president of the beyond this would mean the elimina- Bond and Mortgage Guaranty Com- tion in a short time of the capital pany, and the Bush Terminal com- which he had succeeded in building up. pany. He is a director in the Nassau National bank, New York, Brooklyn Edison company, Westchester Title and Trust company of New York, and the Investors Incorporation. Dr. Bailey graduated from Union in the class of 1885 and later received the degree of doctor of laws from his Al- ma Mater. Upon his graduation, he · immediately entered the banking busi- ness in New York where his rapid rise has been of a phenomenal nature.

Immediately following these rec- are if a student has had the prepara- ord boo'ks, published first by the stu-· tory course in Latin, he has :]aid the dent body and then by the senior foundation for the college classical· class, a book known a:s the \Centen- courses, which open up the higher nial\ vvas published in 1875.

Several scholarships In former years the college vote in jHesidential elections has been a sure indication of the acutaJ resu.lts. The election of Harding and of \Vilson, each time he was elected, was prophi- ci~d in very near the same ratio as the actual number of ballots later showed. An interesting fact is that the stu- dmts elected Coolidge even in the home territory of his 0pponents. The returns of th; college straw vote indi- cate that Coolidge was just as success- itt! in \\'est Virginia, a Davis strong- hold, and in Iowa, California, North and South Dakota, ),fontana and Ore- gon, which one had reason to believe would swing to La Follette as in the .\J cw England States. \Fighting Bob\ still retains the University of \Visconsin, that of Washington, and a few scattered colleges elsewhere. Davis keeps Kentucky, Tennessee, and X orth Carolina. One question of great interest was answered most definitely. How do the negroes feel toward the Klan? The manner in which they voted toward their favorite candidate might be some indication of this answer. La Follette has declared himself against the Klan and likevvise has Davis; Coolidge has not. In Atlanta University, which is largely a negro school, the vote gave Coolidge 151, La Follette 5, and a rotmd zero for Davis. Knoxville Col- lege another negro school went 100 per cent Coolidge. The reason for this seemly illogical move 011 the part ol the negroes is partly explained by the fact that in the South the Democra1 has always been found to be the goou Klansman. At any rate this is an in· dication of the man in whom the con- fidence of the negroes is placed. year following. and pr·izes, including the Daniel F.

PIPE BENDS GET AROUN'D MANY DANGER POINTS Good pipe-line engineering ern,wJoys pipe bends in many places in prefevence to el- bow fittings and expansion j0ints. In steam lines which feed re<:iprocating engines, for instance, the pulsat:ing flow of steam makes the use of pipe bends at right angle turnsalmostimperative t() avoid ham- mering. In straight runs of piping subject to temperature variations, pipe expansion bends are the most satisfactor-y .means of taking up expansion and contraction. Pipe bends of any form reduce the strains which are usually the causeofleaks atj oin ts. They must' be ptoperlydesigned, however, ~nd made to fit into place without forcing. Otherwise dangerous strains may be set up in them, completely offsetting the advan- tages derived through their use. lnvc_:stigations carried on by Crane Co. have uncoveredmuchinformation ofvalueabout pipe bends. The resuits are summed up in complete data tables that form an inter- esting chapter of Crane catalog No. 5 I. If this book is not in your files, we will be glad to mail you a copy on request.

Smith, '26 November 18, 1924 CON;GRATULATIONS! Two outstanding athletic Yictories in one clay cannot go without comment. as Cnion was hrought to the front with the 62 to 0 victory over Hamilton and the winning of the cross-country championship of the :\Iidclle :\tlantic States Interco1iegiate Athletic Association. The foothall team deserves hearty congratulations upon the overwhelming victory Saturday. Although the Garnet team was un- doubtedly better and was favored to win, few supposed that Coach Pern E. Leary had built up a steam roller that wottld crush the Buff and Blue with an alnl.ost. unheard of score. There is no doubt that Union has one of the leading small college elevens of the East: The men ·who made the Yictory po~sible deserve much credit. E\'eryone recognizes the part played by the coaches and the first string players, hut in the time of triumph we should not forget the scrubs. T11e secmHl string men who have labored as faithfully as their more g-ifted. companions who actually play in the games have just as import;J.nt a share in rounding· out a team. Without men with wlwm to scrimmage. it would be hard to constntct a good team no matter how good the raw material. There is much reason to be proud of the 1924 football season, despite the fact that the team won only three victories. The eleven has met a stronger and more widely known teams than ever before and has made a creditable showing each time. The tie games with N.Y. U. ancl R. P. I.and the 13 to 6 defeat at WiHiamstown lack little of being· classed as victories. The winning oi the intercollegiate championship cross country run is as important as the winning of the Hamilton game, and pos- sibly more importat in the final analysis. The result of the race shows the remarkable ability of Coach Harold Anson Bruce, who revived the sport and turned out a team which won both ·of the dual meets which it entered and made a fitting climax to the season with a victory over 10 teams, including Rutgers and Lafayette. Union's fame in the athletic world is rising. 'Charlie' Waldron and \Dr. Derry Coaches 'Scottie' McNab Speak 1 Debating Congress at State ~Pep' Meeting I Dr. George H. Derry opened the 1 meeting of the college debating con-· The \pep\ meeting preceding the gress in the chapel at 4 o'clock Monday Hamilton game, arranged through the afternoon with an informal discussion courtesy of the management to be held on the construction of a speech. The at the State theater, took place last meeting was previously planned for Friday night with only ahout half last night, but th~ hour was changed of the student body and large number due to the get-together. of Schenectady residents in attendance. Dr. Derry gave his hearers at the Scottie McNab, Union '08, former captain of football and a three letter r.!an, was the first speaker on the pro- grain. He told of Union's tussels with the old Buff and Blue rivals of nearly twenty years ago when he was a reg- ular in the Garnet lineup, and empha- sized the effect the spirit of the .student body on the morale of the team, speak- ing particular of the possible ill-effects of· a general feeling of over confidence. In the absence of \Chet\ Woodin 0f the Schenectady Rotary club, \Charlie\ Waldron spoke a few words on the spirit of the Hamilton game. Both speakers .expressed a feeling of \'arm friendliness toward the Hamil- tonians and spoke highly of the worth~ :ncsf:l of the ancient Garnet foe. chapel .an opportunity to air their per- sonal views regarding the benefits or harm to be dedved from the existence of a third party, such as La Follette's. Before members ·Of the gathering spoke, Dr. Derry outlined La Fol- lette's issues in his last campaign, most important among them beirting La Fol- lette's opposition to t_he issuing of in- junctions in labor disputes. Leon Brown, who acted as speaker \pro tempore,\ called on each of those present to speak either in favor of or against the establishment of a third party. Dr. Derry criticised each speaker and offered him advance for improvement. The next meeting of the congress j will be Monday night at the College Union. speed of action. and lack of plot.

Foster '27 Issue Editor, H. \Vynn Bussman, '26 November 26, 1924 The Soiree is-The Soiree! On the eve of sLtch an auspicious occas10n as the Sophomore Soiree, it behooves us to express our utmost satisfaction for the glories and pleasures of this '\vorlcl's goods. To see so· many bright and shining countenances before us on this ·beautiful Sabbath morn -no, we mean Thanksgiving eve-all under the same roof, all to the same purpose bent, and all achieving that purpose, the pursuit and capture of pleasure-in short, Mr. Copperfield, it is a rare sight indeed. \Vill Bever 1nore be seen. Though you seem to be innoxious Like a pertified old saint, You're as bad as aU the ladies In the wa)\ you prink and paint . I:f you could only break the spell That holds your cold lips dHmb I'm very sure and certain that Forth many tales would come. Perhaps it all is for the best That yott for aye are n1.ute. For you might give away some thingc; Not best for good repute. You'd tell me of many fights That waged beneath thy sight, Of ambuscades, and bloody ·scuaps, And stealthy frays at night. And then mayhap, in softer vein, Of lovers, hand in hand, Acting oft as lover wont By Eros' breezes fanned. You've watched the freshmen enter \iVith a smile upon each face, AH too quickly changed to staidness As they're made to take their place. Then you bid adieu forever When the four short years are by. And out into the world they go With a sad, reluctant, sigh. No wonder that you wink at me, When you's seen so very much Of life and love, of fight and fun, Of storm and sun, and such. Still is thy tongue; yet you know more Than I forever could, Though you are only cold gray stone- And I am flesh and blood. St. Lawrence to Oppose Sophomore soirees come a11d go, just like che-cks, street cars, horse races. Pleasure is indeed a flitting, ephemeral thing: it is Garnet Court Squad and a real and living phenomenon tonight; tomorrow it will be but a tnennory. The principle seems to be to cram the greatest amount o·f joy into a few ho-urs of the dance. The student is a remarkably consistent creature in this respect-the principle ·of cram is applied to both study and pleasure. One crams the mind with much knowl- edg-e, which is, however, of short duration; the other gluts the senses with what the senses are supposed to be glntted with, and for an equally short time. Be that as it nuy, it is a good plan to live lile in the present, provided the past is not quite forgotten and the future is not entirely a negative quantity. God gave us the past s·o that we might profit from tbe wisdom of others and wax exceeding wise. He gave us the future along with a conscience so that we might suffer the exquisite pangs of remorse at having done a truly noble act and the hig·hest :;ense of satisfaction at having committed a heino·us crime. But He gan us the present that we might enjoy life and its beauties. So all aboard for the S. S. Pleasure! The Soiree has been admirably atranged in all its details. The St. Lawrence will oppose the Garnet court squad on December 13, accord- ing to an announcement made by Man- ager Herman E. Crannell. The game with the Albany law school five on this date has been cancelled. After two weeks of strenuous prac- tice, the basketball squad is rapidly rounding into shape and Coach \Bill\ Hardman is well pleased with the form most of the candidates have displayed to date. Of the new men, McKay, Davidson, and Martin look particularl~r promising, while on the other hand, Gilligan, Skane, and O'Neil have not as yet shown the form they did last season. The biggest problem facing Coach Hardman now is the develop- ment of a reliable second string team. The first cut will be made next Satur- day, at which time the present squad of 40 men will be reduced to about 25. The first game of the season will be played with State Teacher's college in Albany a week from Saturday night. It is not probable that \Sig\ Makofski, stellar forward of the past two court date is ideal, for Thanksgiving is usually an ideal day of rest. We venture to say that the afternom1 after the night before will be as seasons, will have sufficiently recov- ered from the injuries he receivecl in so nom ulan t as the aforesaid night. For every reaction there is rt the Hamilton football game to take rcci·procnl action, as the scientist says so quaintly. Let us hope that part in the opening basketba11 con- test the t:eaction from the pleasures of the Soiree will be chiefly expressed in deep and sonoro11s sleep, free from that dark brown taste. .Ann-Where does the new young man that all the girls are wild about After which maudlin settHments, it is perhaps wise to close with c0rne from? 1 · 1 · · · · Tique-Oh yes! he's a G~eat Necker. t 1e sng-gest10n t 1at \Vlse Sotree guests w11l not read the above olla (·L . 1 1 d . k ) ong s an you now. podrida at all, nor vnuch of tl:e rest of this Concordy, but will bend * * * her efforts to the business of the evening, 'Which is life, liberty, and.

Open Day and Night Home Cooking-Table Service Seven Doors Above tbe Armory The Collegiate Ford 724 State Street Schenectady \\'ith a rattle ancl a clatter, \\'bile the engine heaves a sigh; \\lith the tires growing flatter, The collegiate Ford rolls by. Each fender has a separate song, Each spring a different squeak; The top flip-flops as it rolls along, The gas tank has a leak. The cylinder walls are badly shot, The crankshaft terribly bent; The rickety ·engine~s always hot, The body one big dent. But all in all, it's not so bad, \\'hile not a pretty car; The driver's plight is not .so sad, It's better than walking, by far.
