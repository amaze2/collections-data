Katzberg INFIRMARY BY FALL: FOSSrBLE The recent action of the Student CottncU de- manding tl;lat an inllrmary be established on the ' campus in order to safeguard the be~ltb of the student bo.dy will venr Uk~ly have c~n~rete re- sults by next fall, if plans being dis(}ussed are supported by the undergr.aduates. Th.e .fact that there was a case of a serious contagi~us disease , on the campus last month and that It was not discovered until it had existed for two weeks, has stimulated -different agencies on the -campus to work toward the establishment of thE Infirmary with great zeal. Place Available First, we need an infirmary where a trained nurse and orderly will be constantly a.t hand to tend to the sick students who may be .quarte:red there and properly nursed to health. No com- munity the size of Union College can a.ss:uve a.de- quate health precautions to its memb-ers with()ut a place in which to segregate and treat its sick. The magnanimous action of the faculty in turning down the offer to turn Dr. Hale's old quarters in South College Colonade into a c1un house in order t)lat it may be available :for an infirmary should be acknowledged bl\ the stu- dents at once. A resolution should l>e adopted requesting the Administration to convert Dr. Hale's home, when it is available, into a.n in- firmary. The cost of this conversion should be borne by the college trustees, but thE malntain- ance of the infirmary should be .the responsibility of the undergraduates. The activities tax is too large to i-ncrease for any reason. Therefore in order to· ol>ta.ln a fee of about $3 to $5 a year for the maint,a:inance of the infirmary, some reductions should be made in the ·present fees allowed the student-supported activities. No E:JI!;tra Tax to Finance Inflr:mary A sound plan to obtain such a fee has b.een suggested by the Student Council: Absorb the freshman l';por~s into the intramural sport sys- tem; do away with required gy-mllas:ium for sophomores and use the coaches' timE dev()ted to sophomore gym to training the intramural teams. Such conversion of freshman spor-ts will allow a cut of about $2 in the athleti~ iee -which may be turned over to the infirmary, :a:.nd at ,the same time it will permit really \trained intra- mural teams\. Since it is planned to have the champion intramural teams of Union meet those of Williams, and perhaps other nearby colleges, . the extra-mural program will really- be Increased. The saving possible comes from the fact that no guarantees will be necessary and no NEW equip- ment. Intramural teams such as football will be equipped from the used varsity- material. For example, Professor Wittner reports tha.t :sufficient surplus varsity football equipment is a.vailable to equip adequately an intramural squa.d of fifty. Since the regular coaches will be xequired to train the intramural squads it is quite likely that more material will be found for .the varsity teams, another advantage. The other money needed for the infirmary fee of $3 to $5, may be obtained l:w takin};l' fifty cents from the $1 Student Council fee (-which it is willing to give up), and a like or larger sum fl•om the publications tax, will raise the mil'limum $3 fee necessary. If more is needed, it i$, ltkeiy that the fees of the Band, Glee Club and Mounteibamks THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 3,. 1933 We newspapermen must be a belligerent lot.

We, hope that the former is the case, but we en.t.ertl'J.in great fears -that the latter is probably the 1;Fue state of af- fairs. What has become of the famed Garnet chee,r leacl:ers'?

But a few days .ago a sweet young th-ing asked us what was this baseball game so popu· lar among fraternity- men.

The victor of a recent ping-pong series bet· ween Reg Walrath and Jack EtuBs was sche~ duleq to escort a certain young damsel (The initial is R) to the next Kappa Slg dance But man proposes and cupid disposes and Jack wHl not be seen with the aforementiened R. Just a case wherein is disproved the old saying \Te the victor belong the spoils.\ 'The recently -organized Misogynist Society (Womenhaters to you, Cuthbert) has gone phfft. At the second meeting all but one of the charter members had to leave early for heavy dates. A friend of ours swears that he saw us in a well-known bistro on an even.ing when we were snuggled in our downy couch. We must have a double or perhaps our friend was seeing double. Well, as a pal recently remarked after a healthy burp, we'-re one up on you. TOBY and. other student-supported activities will be cut somewhat to raise the additional money required. What Must Be Done Now What must be done now, however, is have the students take a decisi:ve stand on the question of having an infirmary by ,passing. the following resolutions Monday in Student B0dy meeting: 1. That we go on record as demanding that the college provide a furnished place for a student infirmary. 2. That in order to raise the adequate sum annually needed to maintain such an in- firma.ry, all freshman sports be incorporated in the mtramural sy-stem which shall henceforth have definitely assigned· varsity cpaches. 3. That in order to have such full time coaches for in- tramural sports, required gymnasium for sopho- mores be abolished If the students are really interested in their own welfare they will be on hand in large num- bers next Monday morning to vote these resolu- tions in Student Body meeting. W.T. E. AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION The Student Council, after careful considera- tion, has seen fit to disband the interfraternity council and to incorporate under its own juris- diction the control of fraternity matters. The move is not one by which the Stud,ent Council designs to be dictator in fratern-ity affairs. The council is merely taking an interest in fraternity conduct that the fraternities have refused to take themselves. Essentially the new plan provides for a joint consideration of fraternity matters by both ad- ministration and student body instead of by fra- ternities alone, as bas hitherto been the case. It is quite apparent that this colla.b()ration is desire· able, for the fraternities are an important part of the college and should be governed in the best interests of Union. lt is not implied by the adopti()n of. t}le amend- ment that immediately shall there be a new set of rules. imposed on fraternities by which they must abide regardless of their opinions. The move has been made to save the student interest in fraternity matters and at the same time to aboh ish a useless organization which has for three yea;rs functioned very poorly, if at all, and whiCb, through its lack of true representation of all fraternities, has really little reason to de~ termihe fraternity policy at Union. Under the new plan the council, like a court will conduct a hearing on all questions pertinent to ru~hing and conduct and will try to judge quest1ons as fairly and with as much objectivity and impersonal feeling as it can in order to sat- isfy the majority of fraternity men and not the few. And, the fraternities will be fr.ee to register any protests or remonstrances they may feel re.,. gardihg a question undergoing iegislation. It is the sincere hope of the Student Council that the student body will fully perceive the fairness and justifications as set forth above for its adoption of the new amendment. DONALD E.

THOUGHT VERSUS SARCAS'M The open displa;y- of ignorance and zealous contempt, prompted by individual hatred, shown by .J:ames Burke in his prepared address in Stu- dent Body meeting yesterday was probably his long awaited retaliation measure against the Stu- dent Council whic:h found occasion to discipline hi:m some months ago. Therefore, Burke's vehement charge that the Student Council's JlOwers should not be \increased\ can easily be discounted, because it ca:me from a prejudiced source. As .a matter of fact, since the Student Council js held responsible for all fraternity affairs, the Intetfraternity Council, like any other organized group on the campus, is subsidiary to the Student Council and so, is held responsible to the central governing body of ou:r campus. Therefore, abolition of the Interfraternity Council does not \increase\ the power of the Stu- dent Council, but merely shifts the burden of im- mediate responsibility .for the social and rushing activities of fraternities from a comparatively in- active group, which the Interfraternity Council admittedly is, to the more active Student Council. A little thought will easily convjnce one that th'El Student Council because it is held responsible :for all cam~\ls aativities is a more efficient or- ga.ni2lation to handle the inter-relationships .of :fraternities and also of neutrals than is the In- terfraternity Council which does not represent every fraternity and none of the neutrals. There is also the matter of personnel, the Student Coun- cil consists of student leaders elected to office white the I. C is composed of fraternity appoint- ed representatives, not necessarily leaders. M;r. Burke, unlike his famous namesake in Parliament, gave a display of oratory without .the support, however, of the structure of thought. 'Yet we. are glad 'M:r. Burke was sarcastic: It l:las ar<lu:Sfld public opinion among the student body. POINTS OF VIEW ON THE ABOLITION MEASURE IlEAN 'C.. F, F, GAlUS: \Due to the fact that the . Interfraternity Council h~sn't been active lately I believe that the proposed amend- ;ment is a good thing. The Interfraternity Council has been unwilling to carry out its duties, and any legislation would be re- ferred to the fraternities before being passed;\ DONALD NITCIDIA.N: \If there was really such hi.tepse intel'est in the Interfraternity Coun- cil before, it is strange that persons so 1 • tensely intel'ested have not man:.Ltested this interest before by consulting the Dean of Students or agitating for it through some such rnt'!dium as ''The Concordiensis,\ Be:> DEBT MUBR:X.Y: ''It .means nothlng to· th'e Student •Counc'll to hav:e ·t}lis amendmen:t .p~sed ·only s<l far .as th·ey :belie:ve ths.t· (it is •beneficla;l':to·'th-e Student body/' THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 19'33 The Camp.us Spectator, ' -- l' -· S'l'QBENT SIJ)RVlCE 'BUBEA;U I ..

A POLONWS IS LGSIJ.' :llND ll'O.UND When Abe Smith who .scored a hit as the min- ister :in \Tlle Man Who Wouldn't Go to Heaven,\ was lost to thil Mounteba.nks last week, it lookell for a while that Hamlet wouldn't come off in Ma,r<lh, for where could another such Polonlus be found'? Well, the old rule that no man is indis- pensable worked again, f<Jr Director Carroll soon found in Joe Olender possibilities for creating the role of the shrewd, crafty chancellor to King Claudius. The interest that the production of Hamlet (in modern dress before stylized settings) has aroused among per~ons in other <lolleges (both Colgate and Willia.D:\s have offered to spon- sor its production there by our dramatic society) indicates the increasing, and well earned, pepu- larity of The Mountebanks. Incidentally, Jerry Bagster-Collins, is visiting on the campus and wUl be back on the faculty and .in the Mountebanks next year. PUBLICATIONS TO MOVE '.1'0 SILLIMAN HALL As soon as a committee headed by Mr. Enzer and aomposed of the editors of the campus pub- lications complete their survey of the ·needs for an efficient publications office, the Publication Board will probably provide the equipment with which to furnish the north wing of Silliman hall for use by The Concordicmsis, Garnet, Idol, and Handbook. lt will be an ideal place in which to work., and will probably r.esli1t in better publica- tions, more comfortably edited. rr'HE SPECT .A TOR.

Goodman THE ABOLITION OF FROSH SPORTS The action taken by the Student Council, in favoring the abolition of all freshman spo·rts, with the -exception of football, follows in line with the economy program which has been sponsored by the administration in the other departments of the college. Union is not the first to take this drastic step to balance budgets. Dartmouth established the precedent last year with the announcement of a greatly curtailed athletic program. Cornell and Syracuse soon realized the inadvisability of .con- tinuing with freshman athletics, in addition to limiting varsity sports. The Little Three colleges are contemplating the dropping of frosh sports, and Union authorities are rightly facing the pres- ent economic crisis by suggesting the abolition of other freshman athletics than football. The athletic program is, and should be, an integral part of one's college education. 'l'here is a point, h0wever, beyond which college athletics may be over-em:phasized. During the \prosperity\ years, alumni readily handed out thousands of dollars to see the Alma Mater win games. This cannot be criticized, from any point of view, but there is a situation at the present time which demands the greatest of thought. Athletic expansion or development becomes harmful when it restricts the curricular program -of any college. This is exactly what we must con- sider at the present time. The athletic budget of Union college for fall sports shows a financial surplus. The salaries of co'aches or of the athletic director are not in- . eluded in the budget of the athletic department, however. Their salaries are paid from the col- lege budget, the same as a professor of English, biology, or any other department. Thus, it can be seen that the athletic depart- ment is really running at a loss. This loss must be met from the funds, which could otherwise be used to expand our labora- tories, our equipment or that part of college for which we came bere to receive an education. By abolishing the freshman spo·rts, funds are made accessible for use in sponsoring a well de- veloped intramural program, which, 'if managed properly, would he of direct benefit to every one ; of. us, instead of specialized training of the small proportion bf students who 'make up the teams. ·This would mean that every one -of us could re- THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, FE.BRUARY lO, 1933 ·----~~----------~~~----------. .

DR. DAY RECOVERING Dr Day's condition is improv- ing stea,dily it was announced yesterday. The date for his de- parture to Trinidad has not as yet been set but it is th.ought that l:le will leave about the first of March. In the opening speech, Donald Nitchman, president of the Inter- fraternity Council, clarified the ac- tion of the Student Council in the drafting of the proposed amend- ment, and stated that the real spirit of the action was to sup- plant the slowly decaying Inter- fraternity Council. Nitchm,an de- clared that if anyone should sug- gest an alternate plan for reorgan- ization, the Student Council would be glad to give it equal considera- tion. Sorkin Proposes New Pla.n Accepting this invitation im- mediately, Reuben Sorkin, '33, t.ook the floor and set forth his ide~s for an entirely reorganized, fully representative interfraternity body. Sorkin's proposal included two other points: first, that the head of each fraternity be a member of the new council; second, that the new council be given a charter en- titling it to certain powers and privileges. Such an organization, Sorkin maintained, would assume a responsible part in intramural sports as well as social affairs. At this point a vote was taken on the motion tabled last week, to amend the Constitution of the Stu- dent Body of Union College i~ or- der to abolish the present Inter- fratern.ity Council. The motion was decisively defeated by a rising vote. Sorkin then embodied his pla.ns into a. motion for the reorganiza- tion of the Interfraternity Council, authorizing the president of the Student Body to call a meeting of the heads of all fraternities to draw up final plans . Action Postponed In the discussion Wnich followed this. motion, George Moore, '34, stated his approval of the new plans and made several sugges- tions about representing bodies other than fraternities, such as the neutrals, the Key and Blade club, and the Pyramid club. Due to lack of time, Robert Mur- ray, ''33, moved that Sorkin's mu- tion be tabled until next week.

Sports Editor -------- Joseph Woolman Issue Editor -------------- Arthur J. Katzberg SUSPICION Yesterday morning an unusually large partion of the Student body went to the Old chapel to ·vote down a motion which ha;d been introduced by the Interfraternity Council. The proposed amendment regarding the administration of in- terfraternity affairs had received ample consider- ation on the part of its proponents; it was a per- fectly sound plan, to which the only objections were. for the most part trivial. Why, then, was it rejected? The answer is that the Student Body, especially the neutrals and certain fraternity men not represented on the Student Council, are sus- picious of the body in which .they have vested . the power of student government. This is a very deplorable condition and one v;hich promises to act as a block to further constructive legislation. It. is only reasonable to e~pect that groups ··which are not represented in the Student Council will be suspicious of its every move. Theil' anx- iety even carries them to the point where they suggest including neutrals on an interfraternity council! Such an idea is ridiculous on its very face. But nevertheless the fact still remains that these unrepresented groups constitute a disturb- : ing· element which will continue to retard what- ever progress the Student Council may hope to make. : · Previous to last year, the student governing body was in the habit of lagging behind the mass of the students. It had no initiative. This situ- ation was remedied by the establishment of the Student douncil. In the past year the new body :has done its work admirably well, and now when it is at last in a position to .take the lead in campus affairs, it finds itself helplessly shackled. How can thjs new problem he met? How can the cries of lack of representation be quieted, so that the council may continue its valuable work? It is not to be expected that the suspicion which has been aroused will, of its own accord, die out, even with the aid of time and persuasion. There remain, theref~re, only two courses open to the Student body.

It is very .queer that as soon as a person starts aiding ·our fat-faced editol' hy writing columns :for him, he, meaning the columnist, is immediately shunned by the better circles about the campus and .finds himself barred from intimate bull sessions in which events of the previous week-end or night are discussed. My fellow outcasts, H. W .. S •. Jr., Toby, Tee Pee and myself are thinl!.ing quite seriouf:3lY of organizing a lepers 'colony and re- tiring from public service. Al'l those wi!'lhing. to join have only to write a column. for the Con- cordy and theY will be automatically enrolled. Speaking of colonies it has just been brought to my attention U1at a nudist cult is to be estab- lished in our m.·idst. I:tl .anyone happened. to be strolling along Lenox road last Sunday night they might haVe seen two of the charter members romping about between the Delti Phi and the Phi Delt house clad on.Jy in thei·r masculi-ne beauty, as such. The initiation fee for this very exclusive ·cult is fifty cents' and application ·must be filed as soon as possible with Dave Corwin, the present ! High Exalted Ruler of the organization. I would like to congratulate the D~ U.',s on their good fortune in being r.emembered in the will of a deceased alumnus. Such loyalty, as ex- pressed by this man, speaks well, for a fraternity commands the respect and admitation of all of us. If they are thinking of starting a buHding fund with this money the Betas would like very much, with the aid of the \Specialist to draw up the plans for the new house as the old red brick job is becoming a bit oM-fashioned and in- convenient. \ While week-ending. at Dartmouth who should I see wandering aimlessly about the streets of Hangover but E:&:-Senator .Judge and Frank Hig- gins, athlete and teacher's friend. These two very fine gentlemen enjoyed themselves very much but just couldn't seem to make out. They visited all the dances and amused themselves by watching the dancers through the windows of the various houses. When it came time to retire they were received with open arms at their house and al- lowed, as a special privilege, to enjoy the hos- pitality of the washroom i The Senator told me confidentially in a personal interview that it was the most comfortable bathtub that he had slept in, and that he was thinking seriously of arrang- ing a similar guest room for visiting brothers in the Barracks. We have to compliment Mr. Achilles on his astrological ability. He has a way of seeing into the future and then of seeing that things are ac- complished, but Saturday morning after Bible class he was talking with some· students about the hockey game with Colgate that night, and predicted that :Union would win the game by a 0 to 1 score. What is the football team going to do next year? You might be able to save Coach Hatfield a lot of mental anxiety. In talking with Ren Antoli, captain of the pucksters and right half on this year's Colgate undefeated eleven, after the g.ame Saturday night (and we are not saying where) w:e learned that Andy has his squad in practice ,already for next year's season. The backs and ends work out three. days each and will get outside for daily practice as soon as the weather permits. It is getting very late and I feel much in the need of sleep after a hard day of classes. lt is a tremendous load off my mind to know that I 'Lave done my duty in informing my readflrs of the outstanding events of the past week and hope that if anyone desires more details concern- ing the above events they will see me as soon as possible.

STUDENT SERVICE BUREAU The initiative taken by Henry Gulnac and Douglas Smith in forming the Student Service Bureau promises to establish a worthwhile extra- curricular activity here. The Bureau is built around the system used at Cornell, which has proved beneficial to those students directly in- terested in it and to the student body at large for 37 years. The Bureau is in its infancy, but will event- ually furnish .a means for some students to earn a portion of their .college expenses, at the same time performing an excellent service to ·every undergraduate. ' By the establishment of the Bureau, students ~.re afforded tlle opportunity c:>f tailoring and laundry service at a price heretofore impossible under \cut throat competition\ such as has ex- isted between the many tailors and laundries in the city. The Bureau is a. Union institution and de- serves the patronage of every undergraduate. ..

It doesn't grow anyw'here ·else in the W()rld. ~ There is a type of this White Burley that is best suited for pipe smoking. It is neither too thick nor too thin. It is not light and chaffy; at the same time, it is not rank or stl.'ong. t~u. S. Type 31\ is the government classification for White Burley. Since no other pipe tobacco has yet been found which :seems to equal White Burley, this is what we use in making Granger Rough Cut. Next, we use the Wellman Method, a famous 1870 method of making pipe tobacco, to give Granger its fine flavor and fragrance. Then, too, Granger is ~('Rough Cut''- just like they used to ~('whittle\ their tobacco off a plug with a jack-knife. It smokes cool, lasts longer and never gums a pipe. And finally, we want to sell Granger for 10 cents. Good tobacco-right pro- cess-cut right. So we put Granger in a sensible soft foil pouch instead of an expensive package, knowing that a man can't smoke the package. Granger has not been on sale very long, hut it has grown to he a popular smoke. Folks seem to like it.

THE PROBLEM STILL UNSETTLED The proposal made in Student Body meeting Monday which was tabled until the next meeting, to the effect that a working inte1·fraternity coun- cil be es'tabl'ished with greater power than is held by the present Interfraternity Council (since it stitl exists, theoretically) will go no further tow- . ard settling the problem facing the student body. The entire difficulty seems to exist in the fact , that enough confidence is not placed in the Stu- dent Council to warrant its inci'ease of power. The vote which defeated the abolition meas- ure and the relegation of power to the Student , Council, consisted almost entirely of an off-cam- . ·pus constituency. These men are either envious : · of the power which would be given to the Student :council, or, they do not feel that the Student ·Council is capable of pl'Operly handling the re~ ... sponsibility given to it. This latter alternative is readily discounted by the work which has been done by the Student ·Council this year. Never before has there been an u~dergraduate legislative body so representative. whi.ch has accomplished the amount of construc- tive work that this body has done. Its size, in- cluding men from all classes makes it far more representative than the former Terrace Council. The Student Council would hold a balance of power, in spite of the establishment of a new In-- terfraternity Council. ·Any matter which passes the Interfraternity Council would have to go be- fare th~ Student Council and passed in that body, , . before being subject to ·the approval of the under- graduate body_ This means that the responsibil- ity is placed in that body, regardless of the origin •of any new pr.oposal which might affect us. In order to advance legislation which will be conducive to the best interests of the student b0.dy and to the college, power great enough to make possible an authoritative working unit must be vested in some representative undergraduate body. This body is and should be the Student Council. Any attempt to curtail its activity is barmful to the college and to each and every one of us. We must remain loyal to its sanctions if any constructive work is to be accomplishec!. toward the betterment of undergraduate condi- tions at Union. Stripped of its power, the organization will soon become ·dormant and lose i:ts usefulness as ' ' was evidenced by the Terrace Council. We must respect the work done by the Council and coop- erate with it by VGting for its proposals. ' '· THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1933 Peeping Tbru the .K:eybole As I recall to ll,lind the last column of my very good friend and :feHGw columnist, M. G., I ·find, that I'm in the same predicament-without news. tr ·do wi'sh, things w6:Uld reach the point Where we columnists could profit froin the exag- gerated and wild stories which characteristically arise from sources of ;scandal-and which we are ev:er ready to write a:oout. If Y·ou and You de- sire to read about yourself o·r better stHl~about your friends-for goodness sake, go out with .them and do something,. Don't be sfl,y,, teU your professors where they should. get off at or i:li you want real publicity give a wild party :lior your friends and invite i:ne, Be sure and have it in some isolated section of the city or campus, far from the ears of .the faculty-let them read about it-it would be more fun. At this time I .should like to dwell for a few momen·ts upon the tragedy which occurred in the boxing world as a. result of a fa:tal blow. The sad feature of this terrible catastro}!rhe is that no one can be found who took any precaution what so ever, that might have avoided the event: which has so shocked the nation. l:t has been voiced. by various characters ccmnected with the boxing game, that Ernie Schaaf was too good, too clean and much too fine for the boxing game. Of course as you listen to or read such an opinion as the above, immediately you see many loop holes in the statement. True enough, however, the statement is as sound as the old proverbial Ply- mouth Rock, when one considers the condition of the sport of boxing in this state. Some of the things which have taken place in boxing in this state, during the past ten years would not be tolerated in professional hockey, baseball or foot- ball. The persons responsible for this rotten con- dition, in such a clean and. healthy sport are nothing but spineless satans with an eye towards big business. So grossly overpaid, they do not even hesitate to boast -of the low practices in wh~ch they are ·engaged. About the best argument wh1ch can be vouched in support of the above nemarks is that of suspension. Tell me, did you ·ever hea-r of any boxer or manager being su- spended for all times because of a serious offense i~ connection with a match? Why of course you d1d not, nor you won't for quite some time. The severest punishment in the game for a gross of- fense. may be, comparable to the crack of a pad- dle yielded by the fraternity member to the in- itiate. One more disgusting fact before I bring this paragraph to a close. As you all know Car- n_era was brought to the District Attorney's Of- fiCe f.or the usual questioning, following an event of th1s type. Oh, what a scene it was-so d-- pathetic and discourteous. Instead of a cere- mony clothed in solemnity and serious of nature -what took place? Here's what happened. All those who were summoned to give an account of themselves were interested in something else- whether or not they were in the focus, of the news reel cameras, which functioned am-id the blaze of flashlights. While this mockery took place, some where in the same city the fine char- acter and clean fighter who had to die in order to prove that he had not faked was ly-ing cold forever in a morgue. All we can ho]le is that Governor Lehman w.Ul get comprehensive ans- wers to his questions, especially to the main one. Why is professional boxing so low and not worthy to such a type as the dead boxer? Change of Residence Within the Past Week The Delta Phi house has lost four noble per- sonages recently. The men in .ques-tien -have for-. s~en the comforts and characteristics of frater- nity life, for a life of luxury and shall I say- wealthy associates. Mr. Willie Buchanan, Mr. Phil Langworthy, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Huested are now residing on Park Avenue-the only bad feature is that they must refer to this city instead of the good old domain at the end of the Hudson River. I say Willie old bean-wH.I you have your pipe and slippers now. Know that-The Hockey game last Saturday night was the first home game in three years-- that Mr. Davis of the T. N. E. house was surpris- ed recently when our director of athletics told him he was manager of Freshman Hockey and that he should get out and do some work-that we still have a Rip Van Winkle with us is in the glorious and fine personage of Harold \Sleepy Hollow\ \Gallant.\ T:hat · Gordie Bell claims it is bad business to throw snow balls at icicles which hang from roofs of homes on Park Ave- nue.

Swan C Groesbeck CLARIFYING A MUDDLED ISSUE Some of the discussion in the Student Body meeting yesterday makes it sadly evident that a large portion of the Student Body has not even the vaguest idea of how our student gover:p.ing bodies are conducted, or what powers these or• ganizations are supposed to possess. Th.e present Interfraternity Council is sup- posed to have jurisdiction over fraternityc .affairs and nothing else. A new council would likewise take charge of fraternity- matters, but it would NOT be a student governing body as many of us seem to think. The Student Council is the only group that enacts .student legislation, and· neither the present Interfraternity Council, nor any new council that might be organized, could ha.ve any powers other than the control of fra- ternity affairs. The l'easons that thus far have been advanced for a new Interfraternity Council c1o not t?h,ow that such a body, if organized, would accomplish anything constructive. In the first place, a new council could do lit- tle or nothing about the present rushing condi- tions, however bad they may be. 'Not until the college is able to provide dormitories for ali the freshmen can a plan be devised to improve the present unsatisfactory conditions. The Interfra- ternity Council has, in the past, attempted to in- augurate a new set of rushing regulations with the result that they were rejected at once by many of the houses. There is every reason to believe that if another attempt were made that it would suffer the same fate. Some of the groups that are so h,eartily in favor of a new Interfra- ternity- Counci1 1 and are using the necessity of new rushing rules as a basis for their argument would do well to bear in mind that any new regu..: lations would only make rushing more difficult for them; and would be likely to drive several houses <>ut of existence. 'The Student Council has just established a set of dance regulations. These rules were discussed with the heads of the fraternities, and we have heard little or no adverse criticism of them. The new rules regulate both fraternity and college social functions. If the Interfraternity Council should produce another set of rules, they could only govern fraternity dances and not college social activities. The dance committee of the council rnade a thorough investigation of the dance situation. The rules which were made cover all social :functions. That these rules are approved by- a large majority of the Student Body is evidenced by the complete absence of opposition when they were voted upon in Student Body meeting. Therefore, why should we want any changes or any more rules concerning social functions? The argument that the Interfraternity Coun- cil could take steps to improve fraternity scholar- ship is weak and m!'lans nothing.

It ·has been said that all :fraternities could be forced to join the proposed :Jiew coundl. Such a statement is incorrect. There is no section in the constitution of the Student Council, .the Inter- fraterli,ity Council or in the· motion to. be voted upon ne::xt week that even hints at compulsory membership.

Consider the illusion that there is a mysterious way to give cigarettes a superior \:flavor.\ EXPLANATION: Cigarette :flavor can be controlled by adding artificial :flavor- ings. By blending. And by the quality of tobaccos used. Cheap, raw tobaccos can be \built up.\ or \fortified\ by the lavish use of artificial flavorings. Such magic, however, seldom holds the audience. Your taste :finally tells you the truth. The cigarette flavor that never stales, never varies, never loses its fresh ap- peal, comes from mild, ripe, fragrant, more expensive tobaccos •.. blended to bring out the full, round flavor of each type of leaf. It's the quality of the to- bacco that counts! ' ---- It I$ a fact, well :known by .,_,. leaf tobacco experts, that Camels are made from finer, MORE EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other popular brand. Because Camel actually pays millions more every year for choice tobaccos, you find in Camels an appealing mild· ness, a better :flavor. And Camels taste cooler because the welded Humidor Pack of three- ply, MOISTURE-PROOF cellophane keeps them fresh. JVO TRICKS •• JUST COSTLIER TOBACCOS IN A MATCHLESS BLEND

Goodman DANCES AFTER MOUNTEBANKS PERFORMANCES The Mountebanks has exerted a great effort this year to present to undergraduates the best of amateur performances. Attendance has greatly increased over a period of years, so that the debt contracted for, to enable the building of a new theater, has been wiped out. There is not, however, the attendance at Mountebanks producttons which there should be. T})cis condition certainly is not the fault of the productions themselves, of the actors, nor of the directors. Our productions compare favorably with .those of any other small college, but some- thing is lacking in the \drawing power.\ A play usually ends around 10:30 or 11 o~clock. This breaks into the best part of an evening, and there is scarcely anything else for one to do after this. If dancing were to be introduced after the plays, a more enjoyable evening might be spent by undergraduates and faculty members. · The prbblem which immediately confronts this , idea 1s that of its financing. By charging twenty- five ·or fifty cents, in addition to the regular as- sessinent, enough money would be realized to pay for ·an orchestra such as the Garnet Goblins. The dance could continue until 12 or 12:30 o'clock, gl'eatly adding to the entertainment of the eve- ning. h ' ' By this innovation, more undergraduates wou'll:f'be encouraged to attend the Mountebanks productions than is the case at t}:1e present tirne. This would also act as an exceUent medium for all 1 iindergraduates to \get together\ in a social : ~capMity: .,1 : •' IS FRATERNITY HAZING EFFECTIVE? With fraternit-y initiations starting t-oday, the I old question of hazing comes to the foreground. The effect of· corp.oral punishment in estabUshing a .deep sense of respect and love for the frater- nity ma.y -be .questioned. No set rule would ap- ply to all individuals, and .it is a matte.r of te~­ perament, as to the effect of this type of initia- tion. It may be left up to the psychologists to de- termine the reliability of paddling a pledge until he must resort to eating from the provevbial maRtel~piece, so that he will understand his :place in college and in the .fraterp.ity. Individual re- actions .differ, )J.owever, and likewise, the effec- tiveness o.f :hazing. A far greater sense of loyalty may be instilled in any man by sound reason than by force.

T:he abolition of an Interfra- tevnity Council would not only be most unfortunate, but also back- wa['d. The present condition of the f:raternity system is anaJe>gous ta that of student government, previous to the establishment of the Student Council. Fortunately, student government was compl'ete- lv \overhauled\ in the form of the Stu-dent Council, so that instead of a degenerate organization;- student government took tl:J.e form of .a~ dea:wcratic, more representa- tive, powerful and progressive body whose purpose was to hetter' ------~-------;::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::~=!----~~-=------~~~~------------~~ st11dent welfare at Union College. 1 Had student gevernment been ab()lished, which was suggested, this progress and improvement would have been impossible. There- f<He, the question arises, why can't this same \overhauling\ proc- ess be applied to the Interfrater- nity Council instead of destroying it? The immediate necessity for an Interfraternity Council whe:rein all fraternities and social organiza- tions (indirectly defined as mem- bership in one society prohibits membership in another similar o:r- ganization) would be re-presented by their respective presidents, and wllich would be granted certain powers and privileges by the Ad- ministration, cannot be emphasized enough. This proposed coancil would be both selective and repre- sentative. It is a known fact that f:vaternities have not progressed 1 in the same manner as the college and Student Council, but have more or less deteriorated. This fact cannot be denied, when one cocnsiders the adverse criticism of f:raternities by faculty in class- rooms and chapel, the attacks ag-ainst the fraternity system in Idol and Concordiensis, the unusu- ally small number of pledges, poor scholarship rating in comparison with that of neutrals--te all of this more could be added. This de- plorable condition becomes very serious when one considers that the greater portion of a student's eiliucation is obtained in the fra- ternity house, that nineteen hours o11t of twenty-four are spent in the chapter lodge, that fraternity men in twenty-three fraternities consti- brte a large portion of the student body, and finally that fraternities, students, and college are really one and affect one another. This grave situation can only be remedied by a spontaneous, co-op- erative effort on part of fraterni- ties using as a means an Interfra- ternity Council composed of se- l&cted men which will be found in heads of the chapters, and which must be a real Union College or- ganization having a hundred per- cent representation of fraternities. Once organized, this proposed In- terfraternity Council would set a definite goal, and devote itself to improvement of the present frater- nity system. Re:£orms which have been suggested could be installed in the present poor pledging sys- tem. Improvement in scholarship might be fostered. In addition to Rerg cup, the Interfraternity Council would award a cup for the best general average; also a plaque to chapter having best studying <Jonditions, provision being made that no fraternity could obtain more than one trophy at a time. Rules governing the fraternity dances would be made by this council and greater co-operation would be insured. Intramural sports umder auspices of the council could be improved upon, so that leagues :would be formed and each frater- ndty team might play several g:ames. Disputes between frater- llities cauld be settled by this coun- C!il. Numerous other improve- lnents and plans could be carried ()Ut by the proposed Interfraternity Council providing it had support ()f all the fraternities. It is the ()pinion of the writer, that every fraternity man interested in wel- fare of his fraternity, the student body, and the college should sup- Port the proposed Interfraternity Council in order that the Mother of Fraternities may be proud of her offspring.

Sorkin's motion for the establish- ment of a new Interfratet>nity Council was defeated by a 90 to 57 vote, Tom Wade, '33, opened the meet- ing by reading the story appearing in the February 10 issue of The Con- cordiensis stating the stand taken · by the Student Council ~n favoring the abolition ·Of all freshman sp0rts, with the exception of foot.:.. ball. At the conclusion of his talk, he moved that the student body go on record as favoring the abolition of all interc.ollegiate athletics, with the exception of football. This mo- tion was seconded by Bus Dill, and the vote was almost unanimous in favor of the motion.

Stewart, Jr. WHAT'S TO DO ABOUT IT? Who wants the Interfraternity Council? At present it seems that no one either wants it, or cares to relinquish it. Action was taken to abol- ish it some weeks ago by Don Nitchman, presi- dent of the council, but this move was taken by some to be an attem]lt on the part of the Stu- dent Council to incorporate additional }JOWers into that body, and the motion was defeated, by those persons who had unjustifiable reasons to be jealous and envious of the powers already ex- istent in the Student Council. A new move was made, in all sincerity, to es- tablish a new Interfraternity Council, which would act as a governing and legislative body for fra~ernities. Inherently this stand was war- ranted, but the attempt on the part of. neutrals to gain representation on an interfraternity coun- cil spelled its doom. The Interfraternity Council continues to exist, theoretically at least. If no further action is taken to abolish it, it will continue in its dormant capacity, as has been the case for the last two years. There are, however powers granted to this council which are not being enforced at the pres- ent time, and will never be enforced as long as these. powers are entrusted in that body. The St11dent Council is an active organization which has the facilities and ability to supervise the interfraternity system at Union. It is in this unit that the power should be granted, and not until this is done will any constructive work be done toward bettering interfraternity conditions. FRESHMAN ATHLETICS The almost complete approval of the under~ graduate body in favoring the abolition of all freshman sports, with the exception of football places Union on the band wagon, along with other schools which have taken this step to de- emphasize athletics. No longer are athletics holding the high re- gard of the people, above anything else, regard- less of costs. We are beginning to wonder just what advantage a sports captain has over the average student in obtaining a position after graduation from college, It is being shown to us quite clearly that aside fro:tn the possible healthful ad.vantages, which may be questioned THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1933 ' . . ·- -. . Recently I have receive<l, requests from some of my readers to insert poetry in my column. oc- casionally. Although the poem reprinted below isn't or~ginal it is very appropriate. About aH we have heard or read lately is requests for ·contri- bu.Uons. to welfare work or .pleas to purchase tickets .for charity balls and I rnu.st admit that it is· 'becoming very annoying, to me at least. A CHARITY DANCE After the dinner they h:a:d all enjoyed, They gave a soiree for the Unemployed. The ladies rose with languor from thek places, A look of duty on thei·r pretty faces, The .men, in tailcoats, moved like marionettes . . . 1 Puffing with unconcern their cigarettes~ In this wa-rm, lavish room the fire leaped high, Revealing figures on the ta]lestry, And the rare painti·ngs· lining everS>\ wall. Musicians placed themselves within the haill, And soon the golden sounds rose to the cei:ling. Charity gives one such a pleasant feeling. The dancers moved on light and airy feet.

Now that I have presented my views on or- ganized charity (for want of a better naine), I shall try to catch up on a few \personal touches\ that I feel that you should know about. For the past few months two very prominent men about the CJampus have been taking weekly pilgrimages to the nearby metropolis of Scotia. Each Sunday night. they would meet at the accustomed place, board the troliey, take their accustomed seats and glow with anticipation over the pleasure the oncoming night held in store, A ql!iet :Qle{l.l, a warm fire, soft music, etc., what more could a man. e:ven a Senior, ask for? When they reached their destination one would trudge bravely up to the second floor apartment while the ether held forth on the first floor. After a quiet but .enjoy- a;ble e:vening these two happy warriors would meet again and return home, tired but happy. Not having the heart to disclose the names of these two most worthy gentlemen, I will merely add that if one were to journey to R. P. I. this Saturday night he would see them both in action for the last time on the basketball court. The little bird just informed me that the no- torious Jay Sullivan has already begun t:raining for the track team. He was seen doing a five seconds flat, fifty the other morning on Mason street. -M.G .. for such sports as cross~country, the hero of the griairon hasn't enjoyed any preferance over his fellow student who has not been misled by this false .hero worship. What then could any senior advise a fresh- ma;n to strive for,.so that he would be best fitted to obtain a position upon graduation? Certainly marks do not hold the coveted position, when college valedictorians are forced to take jobs col- lecting garbage at twelve dollar-s per week. Freshman athletics will unquestionably be abolished at the next meeting of the Athletic Board. This is a wise move; since it makes pos- sible an extensive iatramural program which will benefit a greater proportion of the students than is the case at the present time. general.

She appears to sit on the stage, with the lower part of her body concealed by flowers. She• can wink, smile, and nod. She can talk, laugh, and sing-all at the same time. Thousands of people have seen this feat of magic and pronounced it a wonderful sight! EXPLANATION: Audiences used to pay an extra fee to go behind the scenes to see how this trick was worked. They- dis- covered that the three-headed woman was merely a reflection in a mirror. The glass showed the heads of three girls but the body of only one. The otlur two were cleverly hidden so that only their heads showed in the mirror. SoURCE: \Magic Stage Illr.esions and Scientific Di11e11sions\ by Albert A.

Also old is the suggestion that pro· tection for your throat and freedom from coughing ca:n be ac;Jhieved through some magic trick. THE EXPLANATION: The easiest ciga- rette on your throat is the cigarette that is made from the cnoicest, ripe tobaccos. Cheap, raw tobaccos are, as you would naturally .expect, harsh to the throat. Ripe, costly tobaccos are mild, mellow-gentle .. The question is whether a cigarette is made from cheap tobacco or the more expensive grades. r.- It is a fact, well known by · .leaf tobacco experts, that Camels are made from finer, MORE EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other popular brand. American men and women have smoked more hiHions of Camels than any other brand because of the appeal of more ex- Pensive tobaccos and matchless blending, Won't you stack up yotir own experience with a cigarette made from milder, cost· lier tobaccos ... ag.ainst magic claims about \ . d ctgal'ettes an • yaur throat''?

A month ago the Engineers I'e- ceived a 64-11 drubhing from an inspired Union team which had previously lost six games in a row, in a game in which ninety percent of Union's shots went true. After a four game losing streak, the 'Tute quintet defeated Stevens Tech 25-21 a week ago last Satur- day. R. P. I.'s victory seems to indicate that Saturday's game will be no runaway, for Steven's Tech won over the Garnet team 29-21 during the Christmas recess.

Champ '35, Diamond '35, Tytko '36, and Zubres '36. In the field of sabering, Rogers, '35, Mor- rison '34, Lane '36, and .Champ '35 show best form. The fencing class has been invited to Gloversville High School to give an ex:hibition. In the spring the fencers will com- pete with each other for the ·cham- pionship. · Individual Attention Given There are not more than twenty members in the fencing class be- cause of the fact that Mr. Von Forstmeyer has to fence with each member individually. Unlike any other sport fencing is not done in groups. It takes from Oill\3 to two years for a student to become skilled with the fpil. .A.t present there is a tendency . for eastern colleges to introduce fencing into the regular · acti.vities, and Union should be pmud of the fact that she is one of tile colleges that has already been one of the leaders in this sport of kings.
