The national secretary of such an organization is usually the man who lreeps the group cooper· ating and growing. Ellery has been true to this tradition. During his activity the number of college c-hapters has g1o.wn from 34 to 79, and 32 clubs have :been added to the organization. Ellery would sht ink from being credited with the entire gt owth of the society during the past 18 years, but any one w·ho has sat in its executive committee meetings realizes how greatiy his earnest efforts to keep in clo<e touch with all American scientists Robert Hayner and Harold Bod- enstab were elected to the Studen-t Council as freshman delegates at· the first meeting of the new year,. held on Wednesday night.

Any athletic 1 ivah·y occasions a rise m spirit within a school; when the rival colleg-e is one of such proximity as IL P. I. to l'nion, this spirit is magnified and intensified by pt·opinquity. So long- as thert> is a Hensselae1· Polytechnic Institute anrl a l'nion College, e\·er;-.· student in each school will be convinced that his is the supe1·ior college. This is a perfectly natural and healthy condition, and is one which no one wishes to alter. The less att1·active phase of the rivalr~·, however, in which misguidect students attempt to prove the superiority of their respective school by damaging property a.nd taunting- memlJPrs of the rival institution is one wl1ich ]padeJ's nf tlw two schools hrqw to abolish. The invitation to tomon·ow's dance, the joint alumni meetings, the proposerl dinner of student executives of both Fnion anct H. P.

Inevitably, ho·wever, will come the realization that the slightly-less-than- cordial relations of the past are merely a popular fiction and m·p based on little othPJ' than some exaggerated chauvinistic spirit which has been fostered by a lack of mutual associa- tion.

Albany Academy's sextet will meet the It eshman six, fresh from its victory over Hoosic School, on the local ice Thursday.

George Hugh Smyth, t·ector of the Hitchcock Memorial Church, Scarsdale, will speak on 1 \The Forever Unknown Road\ at · the regular Sunday morning chapel I I services in the Union College Mem- orial Chapel. I Born in New York City, Dr. Smyth studied at New York Uni- 1 versity and prepared for the minis- try at the Union Theological Semin- ary. He organized the Hitchcock Memorial Church in Scarsdale 26 years ago with 19 members in a small portable chapel. Today the 1 Church has over 1600 active mem- bers. The works of Rossini, Rimsky· Korsakoff, Clokey and Guilmant will be featured by Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh in his regular Sunday Organ recital. Loud Talks Softly On Wire Editing The joys and sorrows of a wil·e editor on a metropolitan daily were the theme of a talk in daily assembly on Wednesday by Grover Cleveland Loud, Harvard '10, wounded veteran of the First World War, raconteur extraordinary, and present Do- mestic Telegraph Editor of the New York Times. Mr. Loud por- trayed some of the anguish of editol'ial excision in the later editions, where the \something to go in, something must come out\ rule prevails; and also the rejoicing over a news beat on the grand scale, such as the one scored by the Times at the out- break of the present war. The veteran journalist, who worked in way through college by writ- ing for the Boston papers, ex- pressed in an interview both his liking for Union, and his regret at his inability to lend a h<J.nd in the makeup of this issue. Outing Club Invites Ski Fanatics All Trails Lead To Liniment Chest Sever·al faculty member~ are ex- pected to avail therrtselves of the recent invitation of the Outing Club, which h~s placed its cabin at North Creek cabin at the di:;posal of all membe1 s of the college staff for this week-end. The Club an11ounced that it will hold its annual Intercollegiate Out- ing Club Week-end at Skihaben on February 24. William Kruesi and William Heinz, who are in charge of the program fot the weel{-end, indicated that invitations would be sent to the Outing Clubs of the following neighboring colleges: Amhet ~t. Allegheny, Barnard, Brown, Cornell, Connecticut, Dart- mouth, Hat·vard, Jackson, M. I. T., Masmchusetts State, Middlebtlly, Mount Holyo!{e, New Hampshire, Pine Manor, Pembroke, Radcliffe, Remselaer Polytechnic Institute. Skidmore, Smith, St. Lawrence, Swarthmore, Vassar, Syracuse, Tufts, Vermont, Wellesley, Wesley- an, Williams, and Ya,Je. A joint meet'rng of the Outing Club and the Schenectady Winter Sports Club iE planned for Wednes· day, January 2•1, at which time ski movies will be shown. An alumni committee, which in- cludes Ned Taylor, William Swan- son, Frank Thorne, Alvin Van Val- kenbutg, JcEeph Paul and Frederic Wyatt as members was appointed at a. recent meeting of the execu- tive group of the club. The ski teams representing Ham- ilton, R. P. I., St. Lawrence, and Colgate will be guests of the club at its cabin on February lOth. A new profit of $41.60 was real- ized from the recent lect-ure by Otto Schniebs, sponsored by the group, it was stated. Facts Not Faced \Very o.ften students do not like to .face these facts m· admit their truth, so fat as the paper is con- cerned; and yet they are qui-te will- ing to admit that the college maga- zine must either be a practice ground for undergraduate writers who wan-t an opportunity to try out their own work in pl'int; or a pro- fessional magazine competing with other magazines on the newsstand. In the latter case it must refuse to allow the average undergraduate writer to uee it as a laboratory, be- cause his work does not measure up to the desired standard. \There is only one way to have a really firet-class newspaper on a college campus, and that is to have one member of the editolial sta.ff professionally trained and perma- nently there, while generations of student editors come and go. He does -not interfere with student edi- tm ial policy, naturally, but he does see to it that a certain technical standard of news accuracy and ty.pogt aphical perfection is main- tained. Student editors and re- porters who cannot measure up to that standard are dropped from the staff just as they would be from any professional pa.per. Stu- dents who fail to do their share of the work and to appear at meet- ings would have their names im- mediately removed from the mast- head; not because this director was assuming dictatorial powers, but because he had helped students to esta.blish and maintain certain standards which they themselves approve. Vicious Circle ''There is a vicious circle in this business of campus activities con- ducted wholly by students. Let us assume that the magazine or news- paper .starts off as a \course\ un- der the direction of a faculty mem- ber. He chooses the ablest and most dependable students and puts them in charge, and supervises their work becau~e that is his job. The students gain managerial Rbil- ity and technical skill under this supervision until soon they want to take over full direction; and they are encouraged to do so. But then the burden of campus affairs and shifting personnel begin to have their inevitable effect. Standards are lowered, discipline is abandoned, and the output is good one year and bad the next as the personnel changes. And then some students suggest a return to the original situation, but there is an outcry that that would mean a smrender of student independence. An unimportant change in itself, it would take on a large t=ymbolic significance; so the student activity muddles along. \No I am not expre~sing any Et·long opinion,\ said Mr. Johnson. \Perhaps by muddling along, through trial and error, a student gets more education for himsel-f; and even though the community suffers, after all the college should en-courage students to work out their own salvation. But in a sys- tem of education by ttial and error there is danger that the et•rors themselves will set a standard.':

The Jay-off has been due partly to our knowl- edg.- that Union has been enjoying a vacation in the intetim, and chiefly to the fact of St. An- dt'€'ws' longer recess which is just now coming to a regrettable end. Although the vacation has left our corr Pspondt'nce in a hopeless state, be- cause of it we feel considerably better qualified to repmt on \Life in Britain\ than at the end of our first two and a half month,; in this cloistered '\·arsity town. Our wanderings have not led us far: chiefly in and about Glasgow. bt'ietly to Edinburgh. and for one week-end to an industrial to>An half-way between the two,-never south of the border, down England way. However, despite the loud protestations of both parties concerned. it has been pt ivately hinted that English urban life is nut wholly unlike Scottish. Just before New Year we did more black- cut driving than we had befor·e or probably will again. because the pat ticular vehicle to which we had access, like thousands of others, went up on blocks the first of the year. We were glad to re- turn to the Jowly trams aft€'r spending a couple of t•venings in fog, on ice and the wrong side of the road, with one fifteen watt head lamp. Motor f:Jtalities have t ioen about 100~; in Bt itain sincC' August, but it is a source of unceasing wonder to everyone that they have not quadrupled. Nat- urally the domestic motor industry will be prac- tically annihilated at the end of a couple of years' hostilitiP~.

Two assets have reached here from Schenec- tady recently. One was the broadcast of the community carol Eervice which we luckily picked up at 12:30 a. m. December 18. The choir sounded familiar. and great to our prejudiced ears, as did Dr. Tidmarsh's annual solo and exhortations to the populace. The other black-inked entry was the news of Sam Hammerstrom's selection as Little All-American. Congratulations. Sam; we were glad to have our expectation confirmed.

The com- mittee, whose actions have the sanction of the Interfraternity Council, will be composed of Dr. Marcellus Clowe, College Physi- cian, Mr. Frederic A. Wyatt, As- sistant to the Secretary, and Mr. Theodore McAllwainc, Assistant Comptroller. Two houses will be inspected each week although there will be no set order for the visits. Each house, however, will be notified a few days prior to the committee's inspection. Psi Upsilon will be visited this afternoon. After the campus has been completely cov- ered, reports will be prepared for both the college and the various fraternities. The committee will stress three points. Dr. Clowe will inspect health and sanitation facilities; Mr. McAllwaine, physical equip- ment; and Mr. Wyatt, possibilities for study. In a letter to the heads of each house, President Dixon Ryan Fox aslted that these inspections not be looked on as intrusions but rather as a helpful service that the college is performing for the fraternities on ·its campus. Rehabilitation of Alexander Field Sanctioned By Board of Trust·ees Construction Will Necessitate Transfer Of All Home Football Games for 1940 Season to Albany or Mont Pleasant The Bourd of Trustees, meeting last Wednesday in New York City, sanctioned the appropriation of $10,000 to \reha- bilitate\ Alexander Field. Work on installing a new drainage ~.vstem and su!'J'ace for the field will begin shortly after the commencement exercises.

Sigmund Spaeth To Speak Here Tune Detective to Give . fer of all 1940 home football games I to another .site. Athletic Director J. Harold Wittner is considering I two locations for these games. He disclosed yesterday that the home football schedule would permit the playing of games at either Hawlt- ins Stadium in Albany or at the Mont Pleasant High School Feld in Schenectady. Hawkins Stadium is the home park of the Albany Eastern League baseball team. Baseball Site Needed In addition to necessitating the transfer of football games next fall, the work on the field would render it impossible to play any home baseball games in the season of 1941, although it probably would not interfere with either track or cross-country meets. A new site for baseball practice must be found. It is possible that games might be played on the Central Park dia- mond in Schenectady. Professor Wittner also indicated that the contract for the work on the field would be let to a single concern which would furnish all engineering aid as well as the skilled and unskilled labor. Among the contractors who have surveyed the field is the Rubien Construc- tion Company, athletic field engi- neering firm, which was in charge of constructing the infield at the Yanl,ee Stadium in New York City. This company recently completed a project at the Massachusetts In- Demonstration Lecture On February 9 . stitute of Technology. Union College, together with the· Schubert Club and the Thursday Musical Club, will present Dr. Sig- mund Spaeth, noted musician, writ- er and lecturer, in a \demonstra- tion lecture,\ entitled \Fun in Music,\ on Friday night, February 9. in the Memorial Chapel. No tick- ets will be sold, as admission will be by invitation. The 1200 guest tickets have been equally divided among the three sponsoring groups. Members of the Union College Glee Club and Col- lege Band, may each receive two guest tickets. Othet· students will be entitled to one each. Students wishing to attend may obtain their tickets in advance from Mrs. Helen Jenkins, manager of the College Bookstore, where they will be ready for distribution tomorrow, Dr. Spaeth will illustrate his talk with piano selections. He has chosen the title from his recent book of the same name. Best known today as the famous \tune detective\ of radio, he estab- lis~ed his national reputation on the lecture platform, in motion pic- tures and through his several books. ---o--- Potter. '21. Speaks In Daily Assembly Opponents Would Not Object Union teams !Ilet such opponents as Yale and Dartmouth at Ridge- field Park in Albany in the nine- ties, Professor VVittner stated. In 1931 Union played R.P.I. in a bene- fit game in Hawkins Stadium. It was Professor Wittner's opinion that opponents would not object to playing in Albany or on the Mont Pleasant Field. He added, however, that there would· be an additional expense for the transportation of bleachers to the Mont Pleasant Field if that site were chosen. Poor drainage of Alexander Field last spring forced the cancellation of five baseball games and aroused student opinion to advocate an improvement in the playing field. Since that time, the Graduate Coun- cil and the Trustees have given their support to the program. A movement has been started where- by the student body may contribute towards the expense through \.sub- sistence dinners\ at fraternity houses and dining halls.

Issue Editor ..................................... Robert Schulberg Assistants Granger Tripp 'Solomon Blechman Armand Fiegenbaum Tuesday, January 30, 1940 CURTAIN CALL He came, he saw, he conquered, did Glover C. Loud in his recent brief visit to the campus. Rarely, we feel, has a daily assembly speaker so held the attention of his audience. Stu- dents who had an opportunity to chat with Mr. Loud during his short stay were even more captivated, and several faculty members have joined in this popular enthusiasm. His droll anecdotes, based on years of experience as both a college professor and a journalist, we believe, rank him among the most interesting· visitors Union has known in years. Our purpose, however, is not to eulogize the man or to attempt an analysis of his popularity; we wish merely to urge that efforts be mad.e to ensure his visits in the future. We are not interested in the title which he might bear in these appearancees, so long as this title, be it honorary fel- low, visiting lecturer, or merely \Friend of Union,\ affords .students an opportunity to meet and chat with him. Loud liked Union; to state that Union liked Loud would be rank understatement. It is, therefore, we feel, but a natural request to ask that steps be taken to bring him to the cam- pus more frequently. We .can think of no campus visitor who has had a more stimulating effect on students with whom he has come in contact. Let us have more of this par- ticular brand of stimulus. A LOYAL ALUMNUS \He labored for Union College in thought and deed from the time of his graduation fifty-two years ago to the time of his final illness; the colleg.e problems were his problems, its triumphs were his triumphs. The American college is a monument to such men-\ such was the fitting eulogy by President Fox of l\lr. Charles B. 1\lcl\Iurray, '87, whose recent passing deprived Union of one of her most loyal and devoted sons. Mr. McMurray's incumbency as President of his alma mater, and his tenure as Chairman of the Trustee's Commit- tee on Buildings and Grounds were marked by his unswerv- ing devotion to his colleg-e. The Electrical Engineering Build- ing, Alumni Gymnasium, Bailey Hall, Butterfield Chemistry Laboratory, Memorial Chapel, General Engineering Building and the Physics Laboratory, all of which were constructed under his supervision, will serve as permanent reminders of Union's debt to Mr. McMurray. Minerva momns the loss of a former President, a trustee, and a loyal alumnus.

The announce- ment also stated that President Roosevelt has recommended an ap- propriation of $85,000,000 for the work next year. The major portion of the appropriation, over $60,000,- 000, will go to out-of-school youths and the .College Work Program for the entire country will receive $9,- 500,000. This will mean, in terms of the preeent arrangement, that the 11umber of college youths x·eceiving help next year will be reduced from 273,000 to 249,000. A meeting to consider all phases of the Colleg.e Work Program will be held in Syracuse on February 8, and Miss Frances Travis will. .represent Union at the conference. long time.

Bands at Although it might have been ex- pe~ted that the 'cello with piano accompaniment alone would be weak, Mr. Feuermann when play- ing with Mr. Smeterlin quite car- ried away the audience. In fact the audience wa~ so 1·esponsive that it appl·auded the moment the virtu- oso's fingers left his instrument, whether it was the proper time to applaud or not. This ignorance on the part of the aud,ience was also noticeable when llf1. Smetezlin played Hayen's Sonata in F major. It seemed that try as they would to ·present a dignilied musical con- cert in the traditional style ,the artists' perfot·mance was contin- ually intenupted by amateurish slips. The lights flashed en and off at the wrong times. • And what more heinous crime in stagecraft can there be than a rustling during the intermbsion. It was rather a disappointment that Mr. Feuerrnann played no thirds or sixths during the concert. It did not give him the chance to s·how the artistic talent he is re- puted to possess. But all the acci- dents, flat or shar.p, were forgiven when the two arti,sts combined their respective abilities, to give the most excellent performance of Gtieg's Sonata in A minor that this c 1 itic has ever heard. ----0--- AT OTHER COLLEGES It was stated by the \Oberlin Review\ t ecently that nine-tenths of the bool{s taken by faculty mem- bers from the Oberlin Library are \dime novels.\ Of this type of read- ing, three groups are most enjoyed. First in popularity is the detective story; second, adventure, and third, Westerns. A $400,000 addition is to be made to the Stmng Memorial Hospital in Rochester. The reason for this addition, it was stated by Dean W·hipple, wa.s that the University is faced with the possibility of los- ing some of its medical teachers unless added accommodations for their patients are provided. A col1ection of old clothes was recently taken at St. Lawrence for the benefit of families of strik- ers at the Chicago \Herald-Ameri- can\ as a \gesture of friendliness to professional newspaper men.\ The results of a poli held by the \Rensselaer Polytechnic\ at Al- bany State College in order to determine the attitude of the State gil·! toward R.P.I, students were published in the following manner: \Their whole opinion of us might be summed up in the words of one pulchritudinous :mem- ber of the sophomore class who : said, 'Give me Union-or give me death'.\ Special Rate Vacat;on Tours To MIAMI or PALM BEACH including rail round trip, 1 $ meals in dining cars, hotel ~ 69 I with bath I week or more. 1 transfers. sightseeing, etc. up - Organhwrs~\-; an tt•tl: -- ;:l'l:'cH~fier~ an(I ~tudt>lltf' whn an-· itlt't-'l't'f{lt•d ill organizing gJ'IlUJI~ of 111 m· lllOI'l' 011 the~e tour.:->, \\ rlte f11r !--pt>ctal tlffPr.

Y., tomonow to meet the Hobart Colleges States- meH in Hs eighth contest of the current campaign and to also in- augurate the second-half nf the Union College winter sports sched- ule. The Dutchmen will be scekinf!\ their third win of the season, and hope to brealt a five-game losing streak which came on the heels of victOI :.=s ;n tile ;1rst two games of the campaign. Hobart, on the otl~et hand, is making only its third start having defeated the Orange and Pm·ple Alumni, 57 to 27, and lof>- ing to Hamilton College. 32 to 37. Two Teams After the defeat at the hands of Middlebury, Coach Nitchman :;split up his squad into senior and un- dergraduate teams, but early fouls called on Union in the Rohester game forced Nitchman to break up the combinations. Those now playing on the senior ~quad include Co-Captains Herb Watson and Lou CarT, LaRue Bu- chanan, and George Miller with Ha·rry Palmer and Sam Hammer- strom battling it out for the fifth post. Mickey Rathlev, AI Turchick. :Cen Jakobowski, Walt Swart, and Jack Vannier compose the under- gz aduate quintet with Lee Sher- man ;:erving as reser·ve. Resumes Practice Yesterday the Gar·net team re- sumed pr·actice after a one wee!{ lay-off in favor of mid-year ex- aminations. A scrimmage with the yearling five and passing and shoo~­ ing drills comprised the session. A very light drill is scheduled for· today in which the Garnet will taper off for the fray. Hobart is a new-comer to th(' Union schedule, replacing Tufts College which the Garnet defeated in a close, exciting battle last yea!'. Five veterans compose the Hoban team which had eight wins and four defeats 1 egistered during lasl year's campaign. Captain Will Dob- bin and Sam Clemans as guards; Hank Welker and Rich Ferris as forwards, and Clare Popalisky at center are the li!{eiy Statesmen starters. The contest tomonow star·s a week of hectic athletic activity in which the varsity basketball team plays at home Friday against McGill University; the varsity hockey team meets Hamilton and St. Lawrence away Friday and Saturday; the freshman basketball team encounters the Cobleskill Agricultmal School quintet here Saturday night; and the undefeated varsity swimming squad makes its second start of the current season at Syracuse against the highly- touted Syracuse University tank- men. More than the coming opponents. however, Coaches Joe Wheatley, Nitchrp.an, AI Ciampa, and Art Lawrence are concerned about the eligibility lists which will be is- sued by the Dean's Office early next week after the mid-year marks are announced. Any rulings which will make athletes ineligible for away contests may hurt Union's winter season considerably be- cause 11 of the remaining 22 con- tests will be played on foreign courts and rinks or in foreign pools. ---0----- Watson Leads Scorers Co-Captain Herb Watson, '40, is the leading scorer at the halfway mark in Union's varsity basi;;etball season by virtue of his total of 63 points scored to date. Of the Gar- net varsity's 240 points, Benny Jakabov\Tski, '42, has garnered 46 points to rank second to Watson and Mickey Rathlev has the third highest number to his credit with 37.

Won 1, Lost 1 Freshman TeamsRegisterTwo Wins; Darrow, Albany State Are Victims This year's winning intramural basketball team has more to look f01·ward to than the usual si'lver cup, according to announcement made today by Wilford H. Ketz, di- rector of intramul'als. Both the wh1ning team and runnerup will take part in a series of two imer- collegiate intramural basketball games· when they r·ept·esent Union against the first and second teams fi'Om R.P.I. Tentatively on March 9 the team which wins the intramural basket- ball contest in Troy will travel to Schenectady to meet Union's lead- ing team in Alumni Gymnasium, Ketz explained. On the same date. if everything goes as planned, the team ranking second in Union competition will play the runner- up Rensselaer team on the Engi- neer's court. Innovation at Union Being an innovation in intra- mural activity at Union, Ketz ex- pressed his belief that such a se- ries would help foster· good will between the schools as well as pro- viding an added incentive to all intramm al teams. \Good feeling between institu- tions can be fostered better by in- tramural teams than by inteJ•co.- legiate squads,\ Ketz said, \be- cause the incentive to win is pre- set ved, but the hard feeling which so often accompanies a victory in intercollegiate competition is not as likely to develop.\ rt was also a-nnounced :yesterday Sparked by \Bob\ Carnwright~- and \Beezer\ Seguin, Union's frosh i , . basketball squad scored their first· Wa.tezs · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 1 win of the reason Satmday night 1 Bombard · · · · · · · · · · · · · 0 0 1 that plans have been made for a 2 telegraphic bowling match between 1 Union and Syracuse University on Satutday, February 17.

Other Garnet scorers were \Mac\ Macomber, six points, \Bob\ Carpenter. four points, and \Hank\ Wysocki, two points. Ncne of the Albany men were outstanding as score1s, eight men scoring the 24 points. Hammond of Albany made two spectacular long set shots during the fi·rst half. Although slow moving in spots, the Union year·iings played a hard, fast games, completely outclassing t·he teachers. Macomber played a dependable game. snatching the ball time and time again from under the basket and putting it in po;;ition for scoring plays. Wy- socki and Carpenter also showed improved form in running and pass- ing the ball.
