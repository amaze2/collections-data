-·---. To THE fastidious person whose recognition of the beautiful in nature and art is inborn there is a certain sorne:thing which abhors the sight of the incongruous, the loud or the flamboyant. It is in keeping with the feeling which impelled Sydney Smith in speBking of a certain quarrelsome person to state that \ his very face was a breach o£ the peace.\ It is the sam,e feeling which rebels at the actions of an effeminate n1an, and is shocked by the antics of a coarse woman; it is on a par with the disdain which the refined and eultured feel for the brutal and the illiterate, and is in consonance with the lack of regard shown the man who does not regard himself sufficiently to want to appear in mann.e1·, dress and education like a gentleman. The schools and colleges seek to instruct their students as to the means best employed to make scholarly men and educated womeu of those under their tutelage; in o:ne particular we can assist them, and that is to keep them informed or the styles in dress which the teachers in fasllion declal'e to he the best.

A man who has worked hard all year wants rest or at least a change of labor in vacation time. That is all right, but however much you forget of Calculus and Greek, remember the Butterfield lectures. Neglect no opportunity to tell your friends about them and especially young men about to enter college. Remember that the students them- selves can do a great deal toward making next year's entering class the largest in Union's history. THE INFLUENCE OF IDEALS ON HUKAN PROGRESS. THE FIRST BLATCHFORD ORATION. If we look o-ver the world to-day we behold one word stamped in large type ~pan the face of all nature, and that word is pro- gress. Whether we penetrate the realm of literature, of science, or of art, we beh()ld eve1·ywhere evidence of advancement. Nor would I exclude the sphere of morals from . this list, for I believe the world is growing better, even though pessimists tell us the contrary. Now what is the motive power that lies back of all this progress and makes advance~ ment possible? I answer \Ideals.\ Through the imagination we are continually forming standards whereby we. reguls.te our aims and estimate our achievements. By \imagina ... tion\ I do not mean that wild and fickle · fancy which is common alike to the child and the madman; but that higher, nobler · power of the mind by which it ·works over the materials of experience, and recombines them into loftier forms according to the laws of reason. It is this powe~, then, which gives us ideal standards; and the efforts of
