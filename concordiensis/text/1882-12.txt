Two babes were born on the same calm morn 'Mid lowly country folk; The sarne lip's speech toid the birth of each, As n~ighhor with neighbor spoke. \\Tith the same fair scope for parental hope, Their early days bega.n; Arid many a: year, through smile and tear, Their paths together ran. The one grew strong, and, tight or wrong, By strength his will prevailed; \Vhatever he tried, in his towering pride, Assurance never failed. The other grew good, by compassionate mood, And self with him grew small; For others he thougnt, for others wrought, E'er swift at troubles' call. The one a.t length, in manhood's strength, Strove hard for public place; '\Vhere fame was the prize for dazzled eyes, He ran a tireless race. But the other left not, his own native cot. Though manhoods' star was bright; The fame he sought was the fame he got- The fame of doing right. Now the one lies instate 'rnid the wmbsofthegn:at- Carvecl marble marl ... s the spot; And strangers stare, as they loiter there, And read what he vvas-not. But the other is Ja1d 'neath a bramble's shade; No marble marks that spot; I\() strangers stare, as they loiter there, Nor read what he was not. Thus virtue brings, on spotless wings, Requital unsurpassed; For an honest life, at the close of it's stnfe, Finds honest rest at last. ZUR, '83.

5CJ THE CONC,ORDIENSIS. SCHENECTADY II1STORY. ~- jJWOUBTLESS th~ col.lege stu- ~~ dent has never 1mag1ned that Schenectady \vas a remarkable town Ten to one he has thoug!zt just the contrary. I i e has probably looked upon it as a dull, stupid, uninte rest- ing old place full of homely girls, homely houses and, conseqnently. hon1el y streets. But let him bear in mind Sche- nectady has a history, Schet~ectady can boast of having been tbe scene of a real 1nassacre. Indeed she has never rec0vered from the scare she receiYed on that n1emorable \Vinter's night. Her citizens have often heen charged with being unpublic-spirited but the charge is an unjust one, in- asmuch as the present condition and appearance of their town is not due to any lack of public spirit on their part, but to an all prevading fear. In a word, they are simply afraid. Afraid to enforce means for a respec- table depot ; afraid to clean the streets afraid, alas, to be enterprising. The terror which once smote the hearts of their ancestors, the hand of time has never shaken off, and though considerbly modified in intensity by the influences of many generations, it nevertheless still exists in the natural timidity of the Schenectady people. But to resume, the history of the queer old town is one chain of ro1nantic tradition. As you acquaint yourself with it, you learn that the spirits of those scalped Dutchmen, who were frightened to death, (not murdered as s~1pposed) on that night 11 early two b undrcd years ago, still haunt its many by-\vays. The whoop ot the savage, though rendered faint by the noise of nla- c hi nerv and w hi sUes, still re-echoes . .., from house to house. The sparkling Mohavvk still keeps time to the sentry's tread upon the parapet of the furt, yet to-day noth- ing ren1ains of either fort or sentry save a beautiful iron fence erected on the spot by the patriotic citizens of the place. On the shores of tbat streatn the Red warrior and his Dutch betrothed sat in sweet con1munion and nibbled on the same piece of H ollanci cbeese. In its soothing waters those sturdy Dutch pioneers were wont to wash their faces once a week, a custon1 which indeed has been handed down to the present day Once on the very site of State street, an Indian runner contested the nimbleness of legs with a Dutchman of renovvned speed for a box of herring. Can yon doubt the issue of this race, for who ever imagined that a l)utchn1an could run? Not that he weuld fail for want of grit, but ·rather on account of his peculiar build.

a- ps ry ns ed Nn he of of his . f THE CONC,ORDIENSIS. 5i The Indian won the race of course, but better for hi rn had 'he not ; w bile gorging himself shortly afterwards with his prize, he was seized with acute pains resulting from the effects of too much salt, and scarcely hav- ing time to give the Indian death rattle in good style, he expired in the arms of his dusky spouse. But if the Dutchn1an was obliged to \acknowledge the corn' to the Indian in the n1atter of running, the latter, tradition tells us, was greatly excelled by the fo~1ner in the hand- ling of a certain instrun1ent of war- fare, tnuch in use among certain peo- ple of our ovvn titnes, namely the long bo\v. Such are son1e of the ro1nantic as- sociations connected with Sche- nectady. What has become of the two races \vhich \vere allied so close- ly with its early history? Another people now occupy the land that was once theirs. Their fate, though sad, is not how- ever without its parallel. The won- derful progressive spirit of America's g-rowing people, sweeping all before it, h'as been the means of their dis- appearance. The Dutch have been swallowed up in the great gulf of the human sea, which has been flowing so steadily and rapidly for n1any years toward the land of Freedotn. The Indians, thinking to have been robbed of their rightful possessions, scorning the weleome hand of civ- ilization, have fled to the regions of the far West. It is within your power, fellow student, to see in this old town de- scendants of those people. Stroll irito its suburbs some war.m spring after . noon and perhaps you may meet the bent forn1 of an old man. His face \<- bears the gloom of a great sorrow; his eye grows dill? as he gazes wist- fully up and down the street, think- ing the mean while of the proud po- sition his father's house once held. He calls to 1nind the richly stored pantry and the well filled cellar; his mouth waters for a tastP- of ''old Dutch courage; \ his eye beams for a moment with an intense joy, but only for a moment and then it once more resumes its mournful look. The picture tnay not affect you, but it nevertheless tells the story of the disappearance of a people who had done as much for the laws and prosperity of this state, as the peo- ple of any nation represented in the u·nited States to-day. Out of the host of noble red mf\n who were wont to snatch the bull head fro111 the :\·fohawk's \Vaters and plunder the fat gardens of the Dutch aristocracy, but one descendant re- mains. You have all seen him no doubt, strai6h t as an arrow, friend- less and solitary he roams about. T'he haughty mien and imposing

The rustling head-dress and to1nahawk do not adorn bis person, but a dilapidated plug hat and .a clay pipe reign in their stead. A savage in the midst of a highly civilized society; surely there can be no n1ore deplorable sight than this! What ever Schenectady n1ay be _ to-day, dull or dirty, it still can point with pride or rather satisfaction to hs early history. Study this history. Seek the Dutchman and Indian, learn the hearty ron1ance of the one and the \\\i·eird tradition ofthe other. Think upon these tales of peace and And now, when hare against the dark'ning skies I see a hlasted trunk alone upreared, I think how worldly eminence may rise To such a parallel, a glory neared To the b~gh stars, when hy some sudden shock 'Tis lost of crown and left for time to mock. /----..

'fhere is certainly at this time a great need of a course of lectures in our college. The Dr.'s leetures on History were particularly instruc- tive to thos~ who are taking an in- terest in the I1 istorical society no\v conducted by Prof. Price. History to most young tnen is a dull and un- interesting study. but when brought forward in the shape of well- written

' ze. for for It ,, s no by a res . 111- 0\V THE CON·CORDJENSIS. . 53 lectures, it is apt to ·gain tbe at- tention of tbe student. There is more ron1ance in history than the casual reader would ~uppose and tbis the :Dr. never fails to bring out to the gratification of his audience. We only wish that we could have such treats oftener in our college course. ri\ J~\~: PROI~OS to the above, we ~~would again. call the attention of our readers to the Historical So- ciety. Every man in college should try to beco1ne a member of this association . some time during his course. We read not long ago an article showing the ignorance which the average An1erican youth will oftin1es exhibit .about the his- tory of his own country, and con- trasting this ignorq,nce with the knowledge vvhicb. the English youth has of British history. Now we would like to ask the question, \How many college n)en and even gradu- ates of to-day are well enough in- fonuecl on Colonial His tory not to merit this criticism ? Echo answers; fevv Prof. Price has ~ hown great interest in the association and well deserves the thanks of all who are connected with it. We would like to see n1ore of the under classmen present. l~he \Vork is entirely vol- untary, so, if aqy one bas not the the tin1e to put on preparation they . can at least spare the tirne to attend ------~----~-~-\\-'--~--~ and be benefitted. Ev.ery one who has attended the exercises regularly will ad1nit that they have gained much good. ?itJA~l H Y is. it .that we cann~t have '\!;)~ a choir In chapel this year 1'he exercises last year were very n1uch improved by the singing, and there is certainly enough musical talent among us now to make the much need additions to our worship. A glee club ought to be started, and then we could be assured of good singing. Let some energetic man make the move. Surely not in many years has there been so little \life\ rr1anifested among the students of our old college. Let us arouse from our lethargy at the begining of a new term, and bring back the \days of long ago.\ C'\i'~l @PINIONS differ, as the east ~4--'0\' from the west, as to the best course for students to pursue. Some advise to apply the attention closely to son1e curriculutn of stud v and, mak- ~ ing- a perfect recitation the guiding star of one's course, to leave all else to future consideration. The advice of the aged n1 p1ister \to concentrate th~ thonghts with unwavering zeal on the mysteries of lie brew lore,\ is very comn1on. Frotn this extreme to the course Lord Byron pursued of of devoting the greater part of his

54 THE CONCORDIENSIS. time to reading and writing 'is a g-reat space filled with people whose views shade more or less toward on c or it he other of these extrem~es. Great n1 en have risen from every place in the line and naturally enough have views as various as their courses. In this age of minute division of labor, when division extends ton1en- ta1 as \veil as n1an ual labor, the only road to success is that of the special- ist. Therefore it behooves everv one tb beware how he wanders into the seductive field of general study ana to remember that energy is r er- fecti ve in proportion as the object to which it is applied is sn1.aJl. The men who move the world of thought are those vvho confine themselves within narrow 1in1i ts. A o-assiz mar- o red his researches with manny errors by trying to embrace the whole field of science. A distinction must be made be- tween the years of school life and the > years devoted to life's work, between the youth and the n1an. If the foundation be broad and solid a stately column may be erected, but if the foundation be narrow and weak the column n1ay tumble in ruins at any moment. The specialist must have a broad ground of general know ledge as a basis of support. The ''proper time to begin to specialize lies beyond the years of school life in the \broader field of action,'' as it it is called. Is it not in fact a narrovver field than the school present ? People expect that the advantages of a college course \vill be improved and that a good application can be made ofthe acquirements. College men are expected to take - the lead in social, political, literary and relig- ious -vvork. 'fhey must mould the thought and action of the 111as '· T·o prepare for the great aesponsibility of after years, the various means for broadening the views and develop- ing the n1ind should be err1ployed. No one should allow :::tn essay to con- sume the time that fighily belongs to debate, nor ponder over a difficult problen1 when an bour in good society would rest the mind and, so, throw light on the perplexing point. It wot1ld be but foolishness to say what each should choose or to n1ake any definite rules. Each one must govern his action according to his need. It is a good plan to build up the weak places, since \the weakest place mus' stan' the strain.\ ~ IDT is a strange paradox that Har- ~ vard, the most extravagant of American colleges, should take the lead in economic measures. Last spring at a mass-n1eeting of the Fac- ulty and students a Co-operative So- ciety was formed as a rneasure of economy.

Is p- to up ar- of ac- of THE CONC,ORDlENSIS. 55 A superintenaent \vas appointed; a store rented and stocke'd with books and stationery. An order book is kept through which goods not in stock n1ay be obtained by any stu- dent. Reputable Boston finns give liberal discounts to members. Each 1nember pays a fee of two dollars per annum to meet the expenses of run- ning; no eli vidends are declared ; the ad vantages enjoyed are lovv prices. All goods are sold at nearly ~whole­ sale prices; a sn1all margin being necessary, as a small stock must be carried over. A discount of .33 1-3 per cent on books and stationery is had ; 6o per c.ent on stylographic pens, 10 per cent on furniture and a large discount is given by tailors. Though not the first attempt in this direction, this is the first success in practical details. The society has 700 members. No credit is given, so, no risk is taken; the only induce- tnent being cheapness in buying. 'fhe superintendent is required to give bonds and is held resonsible for the managetnent of the store. Not every college \vonld need as extensive syste1n as Harvard, but all students would apt:-reciate the ad- vantages of a sn1aller enterprise. Nearly every class of men now en- joy the benefits of Unions. The ~'fWAS NOT ALL A DREAM. C!::e: ~ T was~ a dis~,a;l spring evening. d!-:. The warm ra1n was slowly melt- ing the snow which had hidden the bosom of n1other earth for three long weary n1ont hs. I say weary, for who does nDt grow weary of seeing other fellovvs gliding around with angelic companions, while he himself is doon1ecl to wade, slide or stumble over defective pavements ? I was sitting in my easiest chair, holding the AI hati1bra beft ~re my eyes and striving to follow the author in his· delightful description of those oriental scenes. My atte111pt;-; were all in vain. The patter of the rain and the god of sleep were far more powerful than the flights of genius and I was borne away from Spanish beggars and gentlemen from the highway, away from Moorish gran- deur and Moorish beauties to the region of an o1d :Dutch town. It is the evening of our church soci- able. The rain is beating against the window, the streets are all aflood Must I stay at home? Yes. My rub- bers are played ot1tJ my umbrella has- been borrowed.

When I reached the door the rain had changed to sleet and was driven by a furious north wind. My spirits immediate} y arose. 1'his can be shaken off thought I. \tVhat is an umbrella worth? Bravely I ste, 1ped forth. Being accuston1ed to the coping leading to the street I got on won- derfully well cons~der~ng ·the icy cov- ering, 1 only jell twice. The other times I clung to the fence and saved n1yself the humili:ttion. As I passed the college grounds and struck the paven1ent 1ny feet flew in mid air.

Now I 11\/Ust go back. Twould be sure to get out. J never would hearth e last of rny temerity. I look sadly up the street. A pair of steps \vas floating down in the current.

Again I reached the fence. But I was al- most frozen. How I \ skinned ,, along that fence. It started the cirM culation and the frjnge on my cloth- ing also. Of this last I took no heed. At the nex-t crossing I make a pair of stilt3 of son1e pickets and strings I happened to have.· The crossing was successful. Now the water was lovver. Soon I carne down from my elevated tran1-wa.y. The water was just tot he top of my boots No 1natter 7 I said, the canal wi1l stop this confounded -w.ater. I also th( ught name was legion.

Beyond all was serene. Thepavement was oB1y glassy. I had crossed the Rubicon. There were no more serious obsti- cles till I reach the place. Alas! My clothing was in sorry condition.

Putdng on lots of cheek (a verry unusual thing by the way) I sauntered carelessly in. My dilapida- ted appearance was unnoticed. Four- teen charming creatures surrounded me. 1~hinking they had boquets to sell, I said, \No thank you, I don't need any.\ They were a trifle taken back, but again said that they were glad to see me 'fo ·whom would I be introduced ? I saw my tnistake. rfhere vvas only one other student present. I looked at him and'resolv- ed that he sh·ould not take my girl hon1e to-night. That evening pass- ed in just fifteen minutes, no one ever noticed 1ne before, but now I \vas lionized. At last I selected one and boldly asked if I might accom- pany ber to the parental roof. She said that she had a friend with her. I was only to happy to take then1 both. W~en they were ready I fo1 ... lowed then1 out. But there were three and evidently well acquainted. I said that I had only two arn1s, when the odd one remarked that she guessed she had a beau. I looked around. 1'here he stood 'Whitt} with rage. I apologized and said that I knew that she bad fully fifty, only I had not seen any present. The walk back was the· shortest I ever took. Several times I com- • forted the waist places -in carrying those delicate fo~·rns over the cros- sings. Once we met a pyramid of ice, formed by the drippings from a jolly burgher\s roof. This was the only place where we all fell. At other times, one at least managed to stand erect. Where the water troubled my passage down nothing but ice impeded the return, such was tbe suddenness of the flood. As the last fair form vanished through the doorway, the Alhambra fell to the floor and aroused :me from a strange mixture of the real and the unreal. -D.

Yet, ere the term's first week had gone, He captive seemed in fashion's mesh ; A certain dashing style put on, (~mte unbecoming in a fresh. He wore good clothes, he lugg(:d a stick, He puffed a naughty cigarette : And lo! it did'nt make him sick~ He even on a ball game bet. At last h.e roused the sophmore By troting out a tall silk hat. The outraged so phs with anger swore That th =y could really not stand that, And so they vowed that this young man, They'd haze a bit to set him right. To g1ve the lesson they did plan At 12 o'clock the cotning night. He learned their scheme and in it joyed, That afternoon he c..;ame to town And, ft>r a certain surn, employed A fighting man of great renown 'ro sleep that night with in his bed, To which he smuggled him with ca1e, The night came on, and, at its dead, The band of bold, bad men cam.e there. Darkness intense was in the room ; No light gave out a single ray, And in the dense and a\vful gloom The so phs began their pranks to play, Then spoke the freshruen: ''Get you hence, Or, by all thing:., that I hold dear, I'll Leat into your head more sense Than else will get there for a year! They answered with a jeer. He gave The fighting man the sign to rise, The bruiser did so: Heaven save The soph who got it 'twixt the eye:.,! Then in the darkness yells arose, Loud cries of agony and fear, As one man got 1t on the nose., Another just beneath the ear. The window opened. Out they flew, Heels over head. And .soon ihey found Themselves all battered, black and blue, Stacked in a pile upon the ground. Did they return? 01?., no, indeed! They hankered for go further knock From freshy's fist. They all agreed They'd .rather stand an earthquake shock. And now the freshman wears his hat, And sports his most obnoxious airs; He smokes cigars, and, more than that, He sometimes even almost swears. Do sophs insult him? Not at all! They even strive to be polite, And wonder how a man so small So everlastmgly can fight. -Boston Post. L.INES ON THE DONKEY.
