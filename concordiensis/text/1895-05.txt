The three beautiful graces of this latter part of this nineteenth cen- tury are political economy, political fCi- enoe and social sr-ience. Taken together these treat of the laws by which nations becotne rich, prosperous, and civilized. So1ne of the foundation- principles con- cerning these sciences laid down by the lecturer were: That sciences whieh relate to civil and social work are for social man and not for money- making purposes; that 1norality underlies both the State and so- ciety; that for the State, society, and the individual, the highest progress springs frorn industrial prosperity; and that all countries protect co1nmerce according to laws. Fron1. these principles the speaker Sh()wed how the industries of a country are the bulwarks of a government; and tha-t any move of the govern1nent for the pr()iection of these industries is for the people. And since a protective tariff ac- complishes this it is f()r the best interests of all, and is a product of these political and· social seiences. ,.,

AT a recent meeting of the student body the election of Mr. A. S. Derby, '96, as Manager of the Musical Association was unanimously approved by the house. The success which has already attended Mr. Derby's efforts bears conclusive evidence of his ability to fill the office. WE wish, in behalf of the college, to thank Mr. 0. E.

It is not generally known that there was an understanding between the Fort Orange and Albany clubs whereby the for1ner, which contains a large nuinber of Union men, should entertain the Williams clubs ou their visit to .Albany., and that the lat- ter, which c ... ontains many Williams n1en, should open their doors to Union. No ONE doubts but that the musical association will in the future be a perma- nent college organization. The college now possesses three clubs, in either of which membership is an honor; and in future years it will be as eagerly sought after as membership upon any other col- lege organization. To those who have worked long and earnestly for the perfection of the clubs, the college is greatly indebted; but espec- ially are we under obligations to Mr. Joe O'Neill, who for the. past two years has devoted his time, his energy and his re- markable talent to the accomplishment of the end which has recently been attained. ·•

THE communication r~ceived by Dr. Raymond from the War Department, which we publish in another column, re- minds us that we are holding for publi- cation in the near future an interesting account of Union's rally to the front in '61. It is by a '62 man, and tells of the effect of the Sumpter attack, of the loss of Big Bethel and of the· death of Ellsworth, upon students at Union. It recounts in a thrilling 1nanner the succeeding days that witnessed the organization of the Union College Zouaves, when the bugle call, and the tramp of 1nen were familiar sounds about the campus. It will be one of the most interesting contributions of the year. AT A MEETING of the student body last Friday the following resolution was offered, and, after much discussion adopted: Resolved, That the wearing of the letter ''U,\ or the fRJ.ly written word ''UNION,'' or any other letter or combi- nation of letters upon cap, sweater, shirt or uniform in' any way indicating or conveying the impression that the wearer is a member of Union University be restricted to the officers and n1embers of the several Athletic Teams, as defined by the Constitution of the Athletic Board, adopted April26, 1895, including the Base Ball, Foot Ball and Track Athletie asso- ciations. Further, That these resolutions be ·appen.ded to the ~y-Laws of the Athletic Board as a special action of the under- graduate body of.Union College. We feel certain that the advantages which will result from the adoption of · this resolution will in a short tirne remove all opposition which the action n1ay have, It was taken as a n1ark of the appreciation which Union men have of the work of their athletes, and the merited recognition will act as an incentive, in the future, to harde1· work upon the part of those wh.o are aspirants for athletic honors. Too LATE for ample notice in our last issue came the news of Williams' with- drawal from the annual dual games with Union. The disappoint1nent with which this information was met. at Union was augn1ented when it was learned that the season was too far advanced for Manager Barnes to arrange a contest with another college, and hence, our track and field athletics will be forced to go by the boat·d for this season. Two years ago, when the dual games were nrst he'ld, Union won the cup by a ~mall mar'gin; last year the tables were turned, and Williams pulled out winner after the hardest kind of a struggle. This vear Uni011 would have surely won. ~ .
