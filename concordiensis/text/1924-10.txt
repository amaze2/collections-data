As a football player he's a good poet T E T' S admit that all men are not born for U gridiron honors, just as all men are not born poets. You can admire a man's grit for plugging away at the thing that comes hardest to him. He does derive benefit in developing himself where he is weakest. But to achieve real success it is only common wisdom to pick out the line for which you have a natural aptitude-and go to it . Particularly if you are a freshman it may be useful to remind you of this principle, because it can help you start off on the right foot in both your campus activities and your college courses . If your fingers love the feel of a pencil, why not obey that impulse and come out for the publications? You can serve Alma Mater and yourself better as a first-class editor than a third:.- class halfback. Similarly, when it comes to electing your.col- lege courses,you will be happier and moreefli- cient if you choose in accordance with yotu natural aptitude. 'Jhe world needs many types of men. Find: your line, and your college course will be a prep- aration for a greater success. \eaf'ern Electric Company Sin'e 1899 ma&ers and distrzliutrm of electrical eguiprmnt Fact Seve culty a Polyte• bmtion Profes: Vedde1 j.ng fro Dr. delega1 OregoJ Presid· Union.

One chose the college as being the best in New York state, and another because he hoped to get into personal contact with the faculty. Several men'tioned financial reasons and one man came right out and said he came here be- cause Union was not co-educa tiona!. A few gave the building construction _course as a reason, others the athletic opportunities offered here. Other rea- sons were equipment, the employment hureau, location, and the age of the college. Peerade Committee Out to Collect Tax A meeting of the Frosh Peerade committee was held last night at the Sigma Phi Place. Tylet D. ·wood '2'6, chairman of the committee, is anxious to have all men pay the tax voted by the student body for the support of the pcerade. All freshmen are re- quired to get receipts, inasmuch as these slips may prove to be life insur- ance if the owner is stopped by blood- thirsty sophomores. Wood also re- ports that the crop of ideas is very scant ;,ts yet and good ideas are essen- tial to the success of the parade.

From February 2:3 to April 6 the biology department will have speci- mens from the college herbarium on display. This will be followed on April 6 with an exhibit to show the history and development of bookmak- ing with examples of manuscripts. The written book, the Poorman's Bible, horn books, early printing and a few specimens of modern pri·nting wll be shown. The last exhibit of the season will be arranged on May 18 and will be on display until after Commencement. Se- lections will be made from the Bailey collection of books on American wit and humor. This ~ollection was pre- sented by Dr. Frank Bailey, treasurer of the college. It is already very ex- tensive and is growing. fast as Dr. Bailey makes new additions to it from time to time. It is especially rich in tnateral of the middle and last cen- tury and is valuable in showing the life and customs of the country. Although the student library assis- tants last year were a valuable aid it has been decided to secure greater ef- ficiency to have the regular assistants on duty whenever the library is open in order that studen_ts may get expert aid in securing the books or inform- ation they .are looking for.

This allegation, in at least a large number of cases, is true. The raw material, in the form of high and preparatory school graduates,·. is gathered rather than selected, is thrown into the machine; the wheels are turned and a stereotyped, heterogeneous finished product is shipped out into the world. .Now and then the machine slips and a few \irregulars\ appear, but for the most part, the products of the Maine plant and the Texas plant are iclentkal. The causes leading to this situation seem to us to be obvious. Success and failure in the American uniYersity are determined solely bv marks. .\ man takes a text-book, learns what someone else has t<-l say on a subject, \\'rites this opinion on an examination paper and gn.dnates with honors without having hacl an idea of his own. His classmates have read the same text-book, have recorded the same opinion. has undergone the same abstinence from reflection. They are all truly products of the same mold.

College men who spend all of their leisure in pursuits which are US(•les~ and may prove harm:ful deserve harsh criticism, for they are w <tsting perhaps the most \'aluable part of their lives. \Vhile intelligent thought should be encouraged, there are ses- sions which are held by the students which take time away from ;,tudie::; and more worthy pursuits and have no lasting beneficial re- sult. College students would benefit greatly in their future years if they would spend more of tl1eir time in reading books and articles which )nay pro\·e of benefit to them later on. Instead of :following 111.erely the sporting pages, the reading of news about the real hap- penings of the day would show that they have some serious interest in the matters which really count.

Wynn Bussman, '26 October 21, 1~24 COME OUT FOR DEBATING Few things in college can be applied to after life so directly as debating, an activity which has fallen somewhat into discard at Un- ion within the last two years. Engineers will find that their theoret- ical studies must be tempered with experience before it can be ap- · plied to their life work; academics will find that their knowledge of, languages and the liberal arts cannot be put to direct use, but all who' leave c0lleg·e with the ability to speak convincingly before an au- dience will find that they have learned something wl1ich will mater- ially benefit them throughout life. Practical experience in debating will be offered to Union stu-, dents on a larger scale than has been attempted in recent years. Dr. George H. Derry and J. S. Green, who will train the debaters this year have exceptionally good qualifications, so that men who work under them will learn debating thoroughly from the fundamentals through all the finer points which go to make up the art. J\'o one should hesitate to go out for debating, providing that he has some time at his disposal and the willingness to work for the . college and for himself. No one need t·o be a great orator or even an exceptionally good speaker before taking the debating work which is offered this year. Large numbers of men are needed; freshmen, sHphomores, juniors and seniors. Debating at Union College must be placed on a higher plane, where it always was until quite recently. If willing men with the des-ire to raise U nion.'s standing in the forensic art will take up the work \vith sufficient enthusiasm, it is certain that their ef:forts \vill. not he in vain. · In addition to working for the college, a work which is not less \·aluahle than playing- on athletic teams, there are re\vards for those \Yho take part in the actidty. There arc trips to other colleges and those \\'ho speak in intercollegiate contests are eligible for election' tu Tan Kappa :\lpha, a national dehating fraternity with chapters. iH culleges all m·er the United States. The nnderclass debate, the Allison-Foote debate, the intercol- legiate debates next semester, all merit the hearty support of the vvholc student body. Three Dances Given After Trinity Game Delta Phi, Phi Delta Theta and Phi Gamma Delta held dances Satnr- clay night following the Trinity game. The Delta Phi dance, preceded by a dinner in honor of the alumni who had returned for the week-end, con- tinued from eight to 12 to music fur- nished by Hartigan's orchestra. Re- freshments were served. The pat- rons and patronesses were: Mr. and Mrs. E. M. Cameron of Albany and Mr. and Mrs. Ferdinand Helm of Schenectady. The dance at the Phi Delta Theta house was given as a freshman recep- tion to enable the first year men to become better acquainted. Dancing was held from eight to 12 and the -music was furnished by the \Oriental Serenaders.\ The patrons and pat- ro!'lesses wer.e Dean and Mrs, Charles F. Garis and Mr: and Mrs. Harold Wittner. Refreshments were served. The Phi Gamma Delta dance was· held from nine to twelve. Meyer- hoff's orchestra furnished the music. Refreshments were served during an intermission. The patrons and pat- ronesses were Mr. and Mrs. M. Hotchkiss of Schenectady, Mr. and Mrs. A. J, Bradt of Schenectady and Mr. and Mrs. William Barnett of New- burg. Many alumni who had returned to . Union for• the events of the week-end attended the dances. A new rule was passed last year :.tmcerning attendance at fraternitj . dances to the effect that freshmen, and sophomores ate excluded unless specially invited. This rule was. modified when it became the custom for upper campus fraternities to in- vite all classes in other hill fraterni- lies.

Avery When the referee's gun ended the Trinity game, the Union Cotlege f0otbaH team. had completed ·one\half of the hardest schedinle a Garnet eleven has ever essayed. The second half, on paper at least, promises to be even more diffi..cult than the first four gatnes, and the true mettle of the :fighting eleven Perry E. Leary lilas assemMed will be tested to the limit. The faults have been poi11Jted out time and again. What has been done to eliminate these short-· comings in the fi.rst half of this season .should be of interest. . No team, not even with t11:e sustained driving power of Notre. Dame, could perform in a creditable fashion without a field general. Coach Leary was faced with just this problem at the beginniRg of· the season.

Middlebury had no place on the Gar- net schedule at such an early date, but Coach Leary drilled his men to win the game, and the varsity gave all they had, but were beaten by a more seasoned team. The low score to which Middlebury was held indi- cates the brand of defensive fight the Garnet displayed. When the Union eleven left Ohio field, it was an altered team.

BETTING AND ATHLETICS 1 \ \\ith the commencement uf the fall season uf athletics various; matters in comwctiun \\'ith culleg-iatr.: sports rise fur consideration: because ut the effect \Yhich they have both upon athletics and npon 1 the hudy ui indi\·iduab particip<lting in them. One of the must im- portant of these considerations is betting. It is probable that betting will occur so long as athletic events continue to enjoy their present poPtdari tr, particularly the professional events which attract world wide interest. :\ltlmug-h it is true that professional spurts are the scene of the hcavie~t \'\.·agers. it cannot be denied that college sports have become a field fur .the placing of wagers. For the student who is interested in the furthering of colleg-iate athletics a consideration of the detri- 1 mental effects which betting on school teams have upon them is 1 essential. :\ prohlem in regard tu this question is that the practice: becomes harmful not only for the student, hut also for the team: members, the school, and the sports themselves. i In the first place, many of the students who place their money I upon the outcome of an event, do so '\vith the false impression that I they arc clcmonstrating school loyalty by backing their team's per- formance \\'ith actual cash. This is really a poor example of school 1 loyalty. L(>yalty consist::; in rooting and constantly urging and en- couraging a team to victory regardless o.f circumstances. The man whu places his money upon a team because he sees in this procedure, a medium i(>I\ easy return:-; has not exerted himself toward furthering; his tea111's interests. It i:-; a distorted idea for support. i Then there is the danger \\\hich exists when a student of limited finances takes the risk of depriving himself of necessary money, thruugh betting. Such a practice is neither fair to himself nor to those i respunsih!c for supplying- him with funds for his school expenses. I :\ncl t>n the uther hand, the fortunate better does not always disPose I of his win11ings in a manner must beneficial for him. College athletics have attempted to become isolated from any- thing pertaining to professionr:dism. Student betting acts as a coun~ teracting force in this attempt. The result of placing large wagers upon the outcome of a college football game or basketball game may re:-;nlt in the forming of nnderhanclmethocls of fixing their result in a manner similar to that prac-ticed on several occasions in big leaaue baseball. College athletics are not tolerated, however, because~ of pecuniary returns. \\\hen such is the case, they n1ay as well be aban- clonecl. B nt betting is one of the big factors in a movement toward that cn<l. :\ luser becomes disgusted with his team, and refuses to suppllrt it. . \ winner looks upon it as merely a factor in producino- llill1 easy money. :\nd both incli;vicluals lack the sportsmanshi;, ·which slmulcl characterize e\·ery college student. If h~t_ting must occur, reserve it for horse racing, prize fights, I and the l~1g- leagues. There is no place for it in collegiate sports.-!

A successful steam trap should be a pas- sageway for water and a barrier to steam. It prevents the loss of any steam while it dis- posesoftheaccumulatedcondensationfrom pipe-lines and headers. Or drains receiv- ers, drip pockets or steam using appliances. It is automatic, performing its important function without attention. Steam traps of the right type, properly ar- ranged, will return hot condensation direct! y to the boilers as pure feed water. Conserv- ing the \heat of the liquid\ of this conden- sate, they effect large fuel economies. They are the most economical devices on the market for boiler feeding. Steam traps can also be used to draw condensation from low pressures or vacuums, discharging directly into a higher pressure, and meter- ing the discharge if desired. Cranetilt traps perform these and similar functions in many important power plants, in chemical plants, paper mills and oil re- fineries. Their operation is fully described in a Crane publication entitled \Condensa- tion.\ We will be glad to send a copy to any engineering student who writes for it.

March Dr. John Lewis March, pro- fessor of psychology and head of that department, the third oldest meinbeF ·of the Union Col'- lege faculty, has just complet- ed 25 years of active service on the teaching force. Dr. March came to Union in the fall of 1899 to become head of the new clepartn:tent of psychology which was then separated from the old department of philosophy. He was giveN the rank of assistant professor upon his arrival but soon was raised to associate pro- fessorship. In 1922 he became a full professor in recognition of his excellent service. Dr. ~farch graduated from La- fayette college in the class of 1893 when he received his A B. degree. In 1896 he received his .M. A degree from the same in- stitution, and in 1903 he had con- ferred upon him the degree of doctor of philosophy. Between 1895 and 1898 he travelled and studied in France, Germany and Italy. Mr. March is the author of two books, one dealing with his professional subject entitled \A Theory of the Mind\ and an- other, a book of poetry, entitled \A Book of Verse.\ Dr. March has just completed the first draft of a new text book in psychology into which he has incorporated all the results of his original investigation in this subject. He will revise the whole work at an early date and then choose a title for it. It will not go to the printers for many weeks.

Such conditions ob- tain, in certain parts of the Ktaadn, rock flow. The creep, or flow, is due· primarily to the action of the frost which forms underneath boulders or, pebbles. The expansion force of the freezing water lifts the rock a small: curs to some extent, and, as their con- tours becoine nwrc rou1tded, transpo'r- tation takes place without much dif- ficulty.\ For Raincoats, Sheep Lined Coats, 725 State St., Above Nott Terrace Gloves and Mittens •NTERWOVEN SJ\OCI<Jt.t(iFCOMPANY' GOOD SOCKS GOOD SHOES RIGHT PRICE RICH QUALITY In the futme the movement of rocks Sweaters, Basketball Goods, may possibly reach a point on the \ =-===-============== mountain side from which they may roll crashing down the mountain like an avalanch.

Opinions, ideas. differences, parli- mentary practice, personalities, and legislatiYe debate will be suit- allle witnesses of the re-establishment of one of the oldest traditions oi the campus. That the new Union senate will undoubtedly be a vital force in the development of better debating and in putting campus relations into a state of more complete unity is probable. The art of debating, for debating is an art, has not received at Union for man)\ :years such as impulse towards improvement and enlargement as our new legislative body can and will produce. Union's debating· teams for the last few years have been of un- questioned personnel but the thing which has been lacking is an ·expression of the common interest \\vhich the student body should .have in this activity. The consoling factor, in discussing this seeming lack of interest by the many, is the equally deplorable absence \\'hich there has been of an organization through which the student can declare his feelings toward debating. :\ow that \YC have the ways and means to express our thoughts, \et us turn to the improvement of an activity which already has taken a step to\\·arcl greater success. follo'.VS: Union-Hawkes and Knight, i ends; ~ftdquecn and Maisel, tackles; .

Not only is its purpose the furthering of the spiritual man, but a large part of its activity spreads to the so'cial side. In the conductance of get-to- :gethers and other meetings it fosters a feeling of comradeship and g-oodwill among the students which is accepted so naturally by eVeryone that it hardly is appreciated. The spacious rooms at Silliman Hall are especially an excellent s.tudy and meeting place and the present year finds the hall used more extensively than ever. Furniture and conveniences extending even to the installation of a victrola have been placed at the dis- posal of an)' student. Th~ rooms have also become a rendezvous ior aH meetings when a larger hall is not required. Has any·one asked .ho\V these things were made possible? It is true that it is through the aid of Union's gradu.ates who have realized the value of \Y\ \vork, but rest assured that the success -of the \Y\ i4>eli depends on the whole-l1earted support of the men in college.
