Photo by Ed Platz II ·v~tume N(), 1~7, No. 13 February 1, 1978 Tenure D .. . eciSIODS by JlM DAVIS Three professors and two librarians have been gt'anted tenure, Provost Charles William Huntley announced. They are Earl Dwight Phaup, a~sistanf professor of ecoMmics; Leslk A Hull, assistant .p.rofessor of ·chemistry~ Josef Schmee, assistant professor of administration and management; and David Gerha11 and Janet Gregor, oJ the library staff. Usually. a professor or staff member must work here for 6 years before rt:ceiving tenure. The first step in the tef'••re-granting process is taken duf.ing the Jrd year in which a person wo!'ks at Union. At this time, a review of the professor or staff member is done by the ·department in which he works. The committee makes a basic judgment about the person's abilities and likelihood ef receiving tenure when he becomes eligible 3 years later during his 6th year of serv.ice. Committee Begins Review About half ()[ the people who come t!nder 3rd year review are favorably judged. according to P r o v o s t H u n t I e y . T h e.s e individuals continue in their present positions. Those who do not receive the approval of the 3rd year review committee are allowed to continue working for one more year and are then discharged. At the beginning of an individual's 6th year of service at Union, he becomes a candidate for tenure. An ad-hoc committee, usually composed of 4 faculty members, is formed to review the p.erson' s candidacy. The committee utilizes a number of different methods to judge a candidate's past record and worthiness of receiving tenure. Committee members talk to the candidate's professi()nal colleagues. Tney also talk with the candidate and a ran<Jom sample of students and alumni who have been in the candidate's classes. An announcement is placed in the Concordiensis to inform persons who want to give their opinions to the tenure b AND\' ALTMAN AND · members of the faculty.

One of the major \bones of contention'' was that that one of the appointees, Robert Wood, had written a letter of recommendation for Bouner when he was first being considered for appointment at Union, and therefore he might be biased ,in making any decisions at all related to the President's stay at Union. But when Wood and the other three committee members made their first appearance on campus on Thursday, January 26th, and presented tl1eir interpretation of the charge, most if not aU <>f the critics seemed to :agree that the cemmittee members would be able to separate any personal biases they might have from their professional judgement. Another opinion is now that the review has been made to be very broad, the questi:ort of conflict of interest is no longer a relevant one. \Early returns~· indicate that most parties involved feel that the committee's appr0ach is a realistic one, though rtlally people foresee only a very moderate preliminary report evolving by the April 21st Board of Trustees' meeting.

The lteview Committee was. hired by the Board of Trustees to formulate reco.mtnend,ations which will point the school in what appears to them to be the right direction for the future. It does not have to abide by the Committee's decisions regarding these problems, but ·as t·he Board · selected people who it feels are highly compet~nt and capable of doing an equitable and quality job, it seems doubtful that the Board Will reject any of its decisions. Last week's issue of Concordiensis stated, \sometime during the last month the intent of the review has beeh altered.\ According to Serti·or Trustee Andy Koblenz, the overall intent of the Review Committee was not significantly changed.

' ~ ' I I I r ' ; ' ' I . ' ' . I ' ·: ' Page2 Editorials Future Hopes \ Union College now lies at a critical junction in its life as an institution of higher education. In the coming deca<ies, Union, with careful planning, could rise to become one of the strongest small colleges in the nation as many of the weaker ones fold, diverting resources, including important individuals such as students faculty and administr.ators, toward Union. It is no secret that the future for private education looks bleak, especially in New York State where there exists a surplus of schools With a decreasing number of college-age students. To this end, it is essential that Union College adapt a formal direction accepted by aU and applicable across the board. With this type of mission in mind, coupled with the newly organized campus review, the stage is set for a concerted effort toward determining Union's future. The possible implications that this review may have concerning the Administrators put aside, the information gathered by the committee can have far-reaching effects in the area of long-range planning. Recently, many 1 of the proposals and policies of the current administration have come under fire from this newspaper, many outspoken members of the Union College community, as well as numerous aspects of the off-campus media. Concordiensis still believes that many of the ,programs implemented or expanded in recent years were not necessarily beneficial to the College. Hopefully, the information brought forth by the Re:view Committee will be useful in determining the proper course for Union to take in all areas of the school, especially the arts, continuing education and athletics. It is important to realize what will truly be a proper course of action for the school and to implement this course regardless of administrators' individual ideas. Too often the emphasis of Union's programs has been altered as a result of the ideas of an individual rather than by a generally accepted, widely publicized and understood overall course of action. The time has come for the Board of Trustees to determine collectively if not unanimously the direction that the school must take, by effectively using input from all aspects of Union and for the administrators to implement these policies for the overall good of Union rather tha11, continuing the political games that ha..:e characteriz~d this institution during recent years. l:dnors-1 n-chtel .. :'loeiN> edtior~ ....

CONCORDIENSIS, February I, 1978 Report to the Stockholders The management of the Dutch Hollow Pub has been much concerned over the campus-wide conft~sion regarding the Pub's governance, its policies and its purpose. ln the hope of furthering communication between the management of the Pub and the campus community its st.ockholders - a series of reports has been initiated to serve as a forum for ideas and information that Wi·ll help to bring understanding to the campus community - about its Pub. The Dutch Hollow Pub originated largely out of student interest and was designed as the student center's focal point, solely for the enjoyment of the campus at large, since admittance is limited to students, administra- tors, faculty, staff, and alumni. The Pub provides not on'ly customer service to the campus but also provides . substantial wages to the students through varied part-time jobs. Over 70% of all wages paid by the Pub go to students. Tum Back It is the Pub's goal to cater to the needs of the · campus community; to provide the social , formula necessary for interaction between faculty, staff, administrators, and students;. and to a void being a financial burden to the campus community by being a contributor to the campus in general. The Pub is a reasonably large business center and as such must manage itself. wisely and effectively. While its intent is not to maximize profit, it nonetheless must seek to meet its costs as it pmjects them to be. Minimum wage increases, while a benefit t0 the student worker, are a rising c0st. Food costs have soated and must alsb be met. Probably the most misunderstood undertaking in its cost controlling battle this year has been the \electronic bar.\ It is hard to make clear the nickel and dime nature of the restaurant business. The tiniest percentages of waste can lose thousands for an operation such as the Pub. Many concepts lie behind the use--of such a system.

Mitchell Wolin Dear Editor: As an Englishman, l may be · qualified to offer a couple of conunents on last week's arti.cle concerning the Term Abroad at Bath. The reason the bathtub predominates over the shower in British households, has a tWil•fold explanation. Firstly, one cannot sing properly in a shower. Secondly, in a country significantly less addicted t<t doing everything in a frantic . hurry. ablutions are just as much a matter of relaxation as of hygiene. It is extremely difficult trying .to read the newspaper in a shower. If anytlting resembling a bathtub is known to exist on this campus, 1 wo.uld appreciate further information.

Andrew Lee Chinese Studeat · Assneiatlnn Forum View Campus .Review In the last week a number of significant and legitimate questions ha¥e been raised concerning both the composition and the scope of the review cun;ently being conducted on campus. The questions are pertinent and this column is addressed to answering them . First of aU, it is both ,of our opinions that the composition of the Review Committee ought to be viewed favorably until events prove this tack unfeasible. The selection of all members of the review was mad~ with an eye toward quality. When these men were selected, tlu~ir particilar connections with Union were largely unknown. All of them fully divulged those connections immediately after being requested to serve. · Two points ought to be kept in mind. First, the difficulty or i!llpossibility of finding qualified people willing to serve in this capacity, totally unfamiliar with anyone at Union; and secondly, the delay involved with conducting such an exhaustive search. Given that these are men of high calibre, and with unimpeached integrity~ the decision was made to move ahead. The other major thrust of questions concern the charge given the committee. We sought a presidential review and got a campus review; does that let Bonner off the hook? The answer we must give most emphatically is that the behavior of the president will figure prominently enough for it is to receive the closest scrutiny. This was an issue :raised at the January meeting. The committee was interrogated, especially by campus trustees on this point. We are assured that not only will we receive assistance charting the .course, but that people and their behavior will be important in their ·evaluation. Having speken with the committee during their campus visit it seems that so far our faith in them is justified. Until that faith can no longer be justified we hope the Union College Community will join us in cooperating with the review and revitalizing Union. Andy Koblenz, Student Trustee Brian O'Toole, Student Trl!stee G.P.A. Poll The Student Forum sponsored a Student Poll Thursday, January 26, to guage student sentiment on a change in our 4-point grade point system. The question asked was if students felt a modification of the college's present system was in order. Six hundred and ninety- three (693) students voted in the poll, which is approximately 35 percent of the entire student body. Two hundred and twenty-two (222) of those 693 would like to retain the status quo by keeping our present system; 461 would like to see some type of modification. fhe distribution of votes was as follows: 140 voted for a 12-point system; 113 voted for an 11-point system; 89 voted for an 8-point system; and 112 voted for a 7-point system. Thus, the majority of the students polled felt a change i~ in order though the type of change is not definitive. Michael Ganz, the Student Forum president, will present a proposal for a change in the present grade point system to the Educational Policy Committee this week. Advisi;ng System During the past few years there has been much discussion and some criticism concerning the advising system here at Union. A possible solution to this problem, that has been _accep~ed ~nd encouraged by administrators, faculty and students, Js the mfus10n of students into the advising system. This student advising system would act in conj un<:tion. with the present faculty advising system in an effort to ease the burden of the usual academic adjustment first year students are asked to make at Union. Student advising would bring a new dimension to our advising mechanism. U pperclass students wouwd be giving academic advice to incoming freshmen from a different perspective than any of our present faculty members, counselors or administrators. These j.unior and senior students have first hand knowledge of require- ments, course selection and other helpful insights because of their recent initiation into the college community. These upper- classmen. in the event they didn't know the answers to some of the questions posed by the freshmen, could refer them to the appropriate person or organization. It has become apparent that the best place to administer this program is from within each department. Tentatively, the present system calls for juniors and senior~ to have the option of volunteering to advise incoming freshmen entering the same curriculum as themselves. These student advisors would be assigned to a freshman who has stated his or her intention in that major and .should contact the new student in the beginning of the fall term. It shguld be pointed out that some departments already have student advising programs. In most cases though, we hope to go further than these programs that give each freshman student the name of an upperclassman in that major to contact if they need adv.ice. We are looking more for the type of advisor who would be enthusiastic in contacting their freshman assignee and offering their counsel and guidance. As well, an stud~:nts who enter Union with an undecided major would be set up with a student advisor froni a pool of students that would volunteer in the Assistant Dean of Faculty's office. In this way allfreshmen would be guaranteed a student advisor. What we need now .is a junior or senior from each department to volunteer to head this advising program in their respective major. At this point, myself arid this person will approach the department chairman with a forrnat for administering this program. Any student or students interested in organizing this program should contact Randy Feldman at Fox, Room 360; 370-6510 or Box 1404 in the mailroom. With an intense effort and dedication and support ftom all parties involved, we should be able to make this pwgram a reality for the coming year.

Self.Rule Dear Editors: Many · people who discuss foreign affairs rarely take the time to understand th.e point of view of those they oppose. T <r reach a tnlly defendable position. one must unde,rstand both sides of the argument. In 1947, the U.N. General Assembly voted to partition Palestine into two independent states. The result of this was that the Palestinians who had been living there were displaced without their consent. They have been struggling to regain their homeland since then. In simpler terms, they were thrown out of their house, and are trying to get it back. .The Ufiited States and several other countries firmly believe in theory the right of a people to self\<<etermlnation. Why is it then that we have so often acted against this ideal? In practice, we generally only support this the<>rY if the government to be set up is non-communist and friendly to .;)I<:I.LI:>i~. Of course, they agree. Ad Four (after brief recess): They say it should be 0. We say we've just agreed it was twelve- and-a-half. They say let's compromise at six-and~a-quarter. We say to ourselves let's not be radical, and we and they agree. Act Five (after brief recess): They say it should be 0. We say we've just agreed it was six-and-a- quarter. They say let's compromise at three-and-an- eighth. We say to outselves let's not be radical, and we and they agree. Act Six (after brief recess): They say it should be 0. We say we've just agreed it was three-and- an-eight. They say let's coml\romise at one-and-nine- sixteenths. We say to ourselves thete have been exceptions but this is essentially the case. Tbts practice holds true for most European nations too. If the Palestinians were allowed to set up an independent state, the P.L.O. would most probably seek out support from the Soviet Union which is what Israel is afraid of. With strong Soviet backing, Palestinians would· probably become even more aggressive and would attempt to carry out an ultimate goal of regaining their entire Palestinian homeland. However, is it fair to prevent a people from having a homeland just because of what they might do? We must question the strength Of our assurance of this possibility. The leaders of the P.L.O. have made numerous statements to the effect that they would like to see the elimination of Israel from Palestine. But more importantly is that rarely in the history of the world have an oppressed people used such barbaric and disgusting methods as the P.L.O. and gdtten away with it. Their acts of terrorism are horrifying examples of the general disregard the P.L.O. has- for h'Uman rights. As long as the Palestinian people continue to support the P.L.O., we must ~Uisume that they also share in this total lack of concern for · human rights. Therefore. they tnUJ!t not be. granted the rights of humans. specifically the right of self~determination. Until they choose to switch. their support to a representative group that uses civilized methods to publicize their ideas, we must not allow them to be treated as civilized people. However, if they do change their approach to an acceptable manner, then we mu&t grant thent the tights they come to deserve. Then. and only then~ should the · question .of a Palestinian homeland be considered. As for now, Palestinians as \a whole should be considered barbarian:s, and rnust be treated as such. Mih:heU Wolin let's not be radical, and we and they agree. Act Seven (after curtain falls, in nearby tavern): They congratulate us. \You are tough negotiators,\ they say. We thank them for being so willing to compromise. As we celebrate our victory, Tricky Tom, the owner, and H.R. Bob, the bouncer, tell us the drinks are on the house. \Just give 1:1s half of what you have left,\ they say. Dizzy with our victory, we cannot figure out how much is half of one-and-nine- sixteenths and so we give them all we h.ave. \Now either shut up or get o1:1t,\ they tell us. Happy that we still have a choice, we say to ourselves let's not be radical, and we and they agree. Prefer Bathtub· Dear Edit(}r!

In other words if a course· is taken pass- fail, and the student fails~ his cum will not_ be affected. All of thl!se measures have been suggested as a result of Past abuses of the system,. and in order to· increase exploration in fields other than one's major, which was the original intent of the pass-fail option. · The next proposal was made by president Mike Ganz requesting that the Social Committee be broken up into 2 separate ·committees, one of whii;h would ·Professor Allen discusses educationalpolicy .. 4.

There would still be much interaction between the two committees, for example, in the actual aperation of a concert. After some discussion and objections raised by one of the forum members, the motion was passed overwhelmingly.

It has the responsibility to encourage and to approve or disapprove potential new programs within the curriculum, and it is responsible for curricular and educational innovation. The committee is charged with the further development of the Liberal Learning Porgram, and it has the advisory responsibility . for the formulation of careful plans with respect to the number of faculty and/ or their placement in various departments and programs. The Educational Policy Committee must consult with the Planning and Priorities Committee to provide advice for the distribution of various faculty. The E.ducational Policy Committee, composed of one faculty member from each of the four divisions - Humanities, Social Science, Science, and Engineering · one faculty member at large, three students, and the Dean of Faculty, meets regularly on Thursday mornings from 8:30 to 10:00 and sometimes calls special meetings. In addition to these members, the Associate Dean of Faculty, David Potts, serves as a non-voting secretary. The presence of the Dean of Faculty's office is important to the Educational Policy Committee because the EPC has no staff. The Dean's office is used to gather data and research matters pending before the committee. The Educational Policy Committee, in fulfilling its duty of developing policy on the school's curriculum, routinely reviews suggestions for new courses; all course proposals must be submitted to the EPC for approval. The committee considers such things as whether the· new course overlaps another, or if the proposed course will replace a current course at Uni?n. The Educational Polley Committee does not systematiCally review all the courses at Union, rather it looks at the ones that are affected by proposals for new co11rses. Such things as student enrollment, the number of majors. in the field, the emphasis of the department and expertise of the faculty are taken into account when the EPC makes its decision. The EPC must also ensure that a new course is consistent with the college's long range education policy, a matter that concerns the committee. For instance, a proposed English course in advertisement writing style, even though ten students and a faculty member push for it, is not likely to be approved by the EPC since it is not Union's policy to offer courses in journalism. The EPC is also responsible for reviewing the allocation of resources for such things as department staffing and program costs. Due to overlapping responsibilities in the area, the Educational Policy Committee at times must work closely with the Planning and Priorities Committee, responsible for making college budget recommendations to· the Administration. Finally. a major task of the EPC is to initiate proposals that affect the curriculum. The EPC is responsible for determining what type of education Union should be providing, and seeing to it that the school's curriculum meets this goal. Ultimately, all proposals of the EPC must be submitted to and approved by the All College Senate. Professor Neal Allen, Chairman .of the EPC,. told Concotdiensis that the committee is currently considering such things as the implementation of an honors program at Union and the review of th.e liberal learning categories. The committee will also evaluate the freshman preceptorials to see if they are accomplishing· their designed purpose. The EPC will soon be meeting with faculty members of the Arts Department to listen to what they feel is needed to strengthen the arts program at Union. The Educational Policy Committee continues· to work closely with the Dean of Faculty's office on staffing and curriculum design, and relies on the office for data comparing Union's courses with courses offered at other institutions. Last year the EPC develqped the Liberal Learning Program and recently has submitted a proposal to the All College sweet? Senate calling for a- change in the college's pass/fail policy. Briefly, this proposal allows a student to take one course outside .of his -major pass/fail each year, but the student must notify the Registrar before the end of the first week of the term. Courses taken pas~jfaii cannot . be used to meet the Liberal Learning requirement,~ and the grade, either P or F, will not affect the ter-m or cumulative academic indices. Also, any co11rse taken pass/fail, in a major that the student subsequently changes into, will receive the earned letter grade; this grade can never be changed back into a pass/ fail grade. 1f approved by the AU College Senate, this proposal Will take effect on September, I, 1978, The Educational Policy Committee is working on many things that will ha.ve a significant effe.ct on students, and Concordiensis wil examine some of them in more detail in the future. The next item on the agenda was a proposal to cancel the Campus Voice. The editors have expressed the concern that there is a lack of involvement in the paper a,nd that they simply have not·been able to come up with articles to fill the paper. A proposal to withdraw fufids, although maintaining the constitution was passed, with hopes that if renewed interest arises, it would be continued. Next a motion was made requesting the removal of Bob Motgan as chairman of the .Election Committee. In the past weeks there have been numerous complications during the planning and running ·of the poll, held last Thursday, concerning the grade point system. Discussion ensued, and, various sentiments were expressed due to the fact that Bob Was not at the meeting, the motion was tabled and will be brought up again next week. Student Trustee, Andy Koblenz . next reported on Wednesday's Tt\lstee's meeting. A proposal to aliow WRUC to tape fhe Student Forum meetings Was brought up. This motion was not passed. A reason for this mentioned, was that the tapings might decrease the efficiency of the ~eetings. It was noted, however; that because the meetings are open, WR UC reallY does not need the approval of the Forllm. All rneetings of the student foru~Jl are held on Monday at lO:QD. in SSUO. The meetings are open to the campus and attendance is encouraged. From RA To DousinJC by DANNY WOJNILOWER Mike Rotondi, a senior English major from Troy,. N.Y., is currently serving as Student Assistant to the Director of Housing. After working in the Housing Office this fall term, Rotondi was asked to assume .a more active --role upon the resignation and departure of ex- Director of Housing, Ms .. Suzanne Dowling. At this time, Rotondi is sharing what was previously Ms. Dowling's position witll Diane Elliot, Laura Mastrogiovanni, and Linda Peck. He is quick to commend them for their help during the past month. Acting Dean of Students Rudy Nydegger is overseein.g the Whole department. The mliin task for Rotondi has been talking to students and making necessary on•the-spot decisions. This has not caused any real problems due to his experience stemming from service as an R.A. during the last 18 months. Also, students have been fairly cooperative throughout this transitional stage, thus allowing things to settle with Old Gym Hall. As an ex-editor-in-chief of Concordiensis, Rotondi parallels the two jobs i:n a number ·of ways. .. There are always little things going on so it becomes of.utmo.st importance to stay otgamzed m order to handle student problems effectively and avoid pile-ups.\ Another similarity pointed out is that both.jobs require listen'ing to complaint after complaint while never receiving any :praise at all. ''No one tells me they like their housing arrangement. I only hear siud.ents' problems. Jt•s a thankless job. Only now can 1 understand why Suzanne wanted to resign.\ One difference cited by Rotondi is that while he is now getting pa:id and working 25-30 hours · pet week, as editor of Conto.rdiensis he went unrewarded monetarily and spent nearly twice the. time, that is, in the area of · 45-55 hours each week. When asked if his position made him an acting memt>er of the adltlinistrati~n Rotondi commented, \I've been an arm of the administration for the last 18 months as an R.A.\ He further stated that administrative work does not fit. into his future plans. Rotondi's career in the Housing . - ,, . Office will be ct?ming to a close tn the very near future as the task of hiring a permanent Director of Housing should be accomplished within the ne.xt few weeks. Looking back, Mike feels it has been an 1 'interesting experience as a student but when :combined with s.chooi work, there's really no reason to do it. Besides, the novelty has simply worn off.'' An active 'student on campus for the past three and one half years, Mike has made no definite plans for after his graduation this June. w help Mar the · A man star1 Mar addi Gan have mor foll( 'I 1 2 2 I l [ !3 l 1 Fel: 1 the: wei Stu 1 ret1 op~ wo 1 to yo1 c lea am I ye1 St1 yo an be b) r ins· re~ eli~ Vif l. soc pic: p.t frc a.J tht \sc th' m gc he st to th OJ Cl 0 II s1 Ct

Page5 FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS Applications for aU forms of financial aid are now a vail- able at the Office of Student Aid, Old Gym Hall. Students desiring ren!)wal of aid as. well as . new applicants MUST submit applications. The PC S has been supplanted by a· new form called the Financial Aid Form (FAF) for tbe 1978-79 academic ;year. In addition to fulfilli11g the college require- ments for financial aid consideration, this form can also be used to file for the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant (BEOG) program. The F AF must be filed with the College Scholarship Service no later than March l, 1978 and the Master Application must be rettuned to the Student Aid Office by the same date. ' Eats and Honky Tonks by ED CLOOS lll Allow me to confess, dear readers, my dissatisfaction with the current predominance of \Eats\ in this column. Of late, my bar and grill research has not been up to par. In fact, I've been scrambling just to make bogie. For instance, my planned tour of Kruesi Ave. has been forestalled indefinitely. Close encounters of the late night kind have been rare these days. In the ·place of adventures in inebriation have been a series of innocuous outings ,in search of the perfect noon repast. 1 don't mean to say that lunch is without its quirks. Many ar.e the safaris I've taken, and many the prizes I've received for my daring. On occasion, these gastronomic .forays have been dangerous. My principal regret is as follows. If (:ve a place as a servant of hedonism, I feel that ifs as a proselytizer for alcohol. In reviewing luncheonettes, I fail to advance the cause. As l understand it, the function of lunch is to rebuild one's fortitude for the long haul to the end of the working day. The pragmatism behind lunch is evident in the Electric City. This writer has previously noted the disproportionately large number of eateries in Schenectady: Could it be that the working populace of Schenectady is sorely in need of rebuilt fortitude? The recent difficulty in the Electric City's fuse box suggests this may be so (Forgive the imagery if you will, but this city without \Generous Electric\ would certainly resemble a home with blown fuses.) To make a long story short, I fear that I may be guilty of promoting the 9 to 5 industrial nightmare lifestyle in my constant endorsement of lunch. Any guilt notwithstanding, a combination of cold weather and respon- sibilities (the horrors!) have kept me from straying too far from home. To save this week's effort from the abyss of abstraction, allow me to comment on a few recent experiences. A trip to the Alps Grill (Nott St., near the railroad ()Verpass) proved a disappointment. They offer only a few sandwiches and a soup of the day to placate a hungry man. After a beer and a few moments reflection on their comprehensive selection of the disgusting Hereford Cow cordials I was, as they say, outta' there. to tell folks what they already know, thought I. Examination of the matter revealed woefu! ignorance in some quarters of the college community concerning this spa of the stomach. Apparently I'd put too much stock in the curiosity of local intellects. A torrent of superlatives might not do justice to the sandwiches served up daily at the corner of State and Erie. rve never had a better roast beef sandwich anywhere. Of the pastrami and corned beef I can't make the same claim. However, they are of consistently higher quality than those at any other local eatery I've frequented. I've recently developed a passion for Maurice's ham salad sandwiches. Good ham salad is a rare find above the Mason-Dixon. For under $1.00, the sandwich is a bargain as well. The chicken liver and knockwurst sandwiches have received ••fave raves\ from associates. For what it's worth .• 1 try to hit Maurice's at least once a week. Diai·A·Visit The Union L uncheo net te (Lower Union, across from Spencer Business Institute. If that doesn't ring a bell, how about just down from Planned Parehthood?) proved satisfying, as usual. The proprietor makes his ow11 sausage and bakes his own rolls, or so he claimed six months ago. If your taste in sandwiches runs to hot subs in torpedo rolls with the usual options, this place should meet with approval. While dining, I happened to overhear tell of the plight of a young lady foolish enough to allow a girlfriend to mate indiscriminately in her studio apartment. Live and learn, I gu~ss. Now located in the former home of another local institution of long standing, the Nicholaus Restaurant, Maurice's has been through several locations and decades In Schenectady. Why hell, my pater ate at Maurice's in his undergraduate days.

The new plan, Dial-A .. Visit, goes into effect on February l. It provides discounts of up to 50% for intrastate toll calls. All calls dialed directly and placed. between the hours of 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. on weekdays or from 5 p.m. Friday through 8 a.m. Monday will be eligible for the discount. While there is llo \service charge\ for the plan, there will be a six dollar minimum monthly charge. The 50% discount·rate does not go into effect until the customer has made 12 dollars worth .of in- state toll calls. If, for example, the , total cost for all in.-state calls at the end of the month is less than or equal to 12 dollarsf the customer must pay six dollars. Once the customer has made more than 12 dollars worth of in- state toll calls, the calls will then cost only 50% of the actual cost. Example: dollar minimum 50% discount rate actual cost of cost under in-state toll .calls Diai-A•Visit $3 $6 $6 $6 $10 $6 $12 $6 $18 '$9 $26 $13 While the plan does offer a substantial savings, · there are problems for the college student.

This is most definitely true in the play \A Man For All Seasons,\ by Robert Bolt, to be presented by Motinte banks February 24 through 2(>, and March I through 4 in the N ott Memorial. Set in the sixteenth century, it is the story of Sir Thomas Moore, \a hero .of selfhood,\ ca11ght between two oaths; that of his self and that of society. The conflict in the play is that Henry V HI., King of England, waits to divorce Catherine of Spain and marry Anne Boleyn. For Mo(}re to condone this marriage would be to deny his Christian principles and to detract from the power of the Pope. However, the King and the people want him to swear an oath that the King is the supreme head of the church. They want \the good- housekeeping seal of approval.\ All methods are used to try to persuade hirn to comply. Moore is \throw11 into the water,\ and temporarily solves the problem by staying silmt. The most painful for him is how his family doesn't understan<l ltim. Moore is not a saint, he is a man, a very influential man. ••He is a man of integrity.\ He never sought political p()sition, but it was thrust upon him. He rose up through society to the position of lord Chancellor. Among his many attributes, \he has a great sense of humor.\ But he is being pushed; he is caught in the middle with everyo11.e closing in. He must keep his self-respect. This play deals with the common man, the person who infilt:rates everything. He doesn't ··want to have strong responsibilities. Throughout the play, the images of water are used. A common man does not want to get into deep water; he wants to stay on the central dry land. When be is forced out into the void, he must find a constant factor from which he can draw. Although kept in its historical setting, the play deals with contemp.orary issues. It is essentially the question of ··ean every man be bought off?\ Bolt explores · Sir Thomas Moore, a common man bv Bolfs definition, by John Rose.· Moore is a man trying to hold onto his conscience. As stated by director Barry Smith, it is \an existential question in a world of chaos and doubt.\ Moore is a very difficult character to portray. As Rose puts it, ••He is a political figure, a powerful figure. For me to understand the seriousness of his position, it takes a great deal of work. I cJon•t identify with him as closely as I did with Biff (Rose played Biff Loman in \Death of a Salesman,\ performed last term). All of ~he characters in the play are examined, so that we see in pragmatic terms that all the arguments on both sides are valid. Many practical and political questions must be solved. However, Moore solves them on a higher, possibly less realistic level than other people can, handle. In fact, it was Sir Thomas Moore who coined the phrase \utopia.\ Directing the show is Barry Smith, with Sharon Rubin as his assistant. The common man is played by Hank Hancock, Alex Schafer is Master Richard Rich, We'll do it my way or else! Chris Harding plays the Duke of Norfolk, and Lady Alice Moore is portrayed by Mary Mauimore. In the role of Lady Margaret Moore (Meg) is Margaret-Ann Maloney, .Bill Pike is Cardinal Wolsey, George Siletsky plays Thomas Cromwell, and Signor Chapuys is done by Tom Farrel. Chapuy's attendent is David Van Weiss, Randy Klein is William Roper, and King Henry Vlll is portrayed by Mitchell Blair. Alice Tufel plays a woman, With Robert Gurman in the role of Thomas Cranmer. For this show, Mountebanks is employing the services of Suzanne Frisch, a guest costumer from New York City. Miss Frisch, who has had considerable experience in theatrical costuming should ·~ able to .add .a true air of authenticity to tile sixteenth century setting. All in all, this is one show you won•t want to miss. The Other Francisco ~ . . . . ' - - -- ' The Other Francisco is a dramatic and insightful account of black ·slavery during the 19th century. Based on Francisco, a famous Cuban anti-slavery novel (written before Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin), The Other Francisco presents scenes taken from the original novel which deals with the tragic development of an impossible , love affair between two slaves - Francisco, a black house slave; and Dorotea, a mulatto maidservant who are persecuted and mistreated by their master, Ricardo, because his advances to Dorotea have been rejected. The film intersperses scenes from this essentially melodramatic. story with scenes set in the intellectual salons of the period where the novelist, Anselmo Suarez Romero, is applauded for his humanitarian, liberal intentions. These scenes serve to set the novel and the author's objectives within a broader historical framework, revealing the actual social and political forces responsible for slavery and the then-,growing demands for reform. The film then further takes apart the structure of the novel, questioning its historical accuracy by contrasting the novel's romantic, idealized conceptions of slavery with the actual historical conditions, revealing 'the other Francisco' by showing the· brutal exploitation of blacks, the influence of African culture, the frequent sabotaging of production on the plantations, and the widespread uprisings of the period. both a compelling historical drama and a unique film experiment which illuminates a period when politicians, intellectuals and slaves all fought to wipe out slavery - but each with extremely different purposes jn mind. Scene from the film . Creative Workshops A creative music workshop is being formed to provide space and opportunity for people to get together to work I play I perform in any idiom. This workshop has evolved as an extension of the Jazz Workshop, but is in no way restricted to the performance of jazz alone. So far, m:embers have expressed _ interest in doing traditional folk, beb()p, music- theatre, baroque. rock, bluegrass, funk, ••avant-garde,\ \American primitive,'' and a host of others. Plans ate to have a different type of workshop each day of the week, with performances to be scheduled as the need arises. There are no requirements as to technical proficiency, experience or time-commitment, but it is essential that participants be reliable, · flexible, ahd willing to put a lot of energy into the projects they do undertake with the workshop. lf you have any ideas, would like to become involved, and/ or just want to listen, call 346-0195 or drop by room 217 Carnegie (inside of room 214) Tuesday or Thursday nights. -- a by J] Jaz: music pe~ot inflat1 world the r~ ln th Tyner recog Mr perfo1 last F maste free-f, thee' a swc tric-1 Guil~ song, reed 1 tenor and Fam snycc evide playi quid grou1 eveni Ea a vel in ten was first audic virtu finge Mel M cont; Indo cong L.ati1 restr frorr othe com grea with The diffe char colo stan pian did The: year the dire' T ever of 4 the Fan flyir the the sax. cia! sax \eli I peri ma1 wh< 1 hall acci aud glill ~ s a II

There _are no media,. inflated Framptons itt tile jazz world, only musicians striving for the recognition that tney deserve. In the past few years, McCoy Tyner has won himself that recogniti~m. most, of his solid, down-home jazz background. These moments always evolved into a free-form race u,p and clown the ivories, or into a beautiful enharmonic passage. .Fletcher's cymbals and kickbeat were always right on time behind Tyner's soles. Tyner encouraged his quintet to take the forefront on most pieces. This was mos( enjoyable in a modal piece, featuring Joe Ford's alto sax. Ford has both an incredible feel for the jazz line and a mastery of his instrument, which he sho~ed in an extenqed a-capelii! solo. _ Tlte sextet ended the evening with a Middle~Eastern influenced piece. The audience applauded loudly, appFeqiative of a night of trtJiy :professional jazz. culture McCoy Tynuperjorming in Chapel.

Prize Winner Visits Union Each piece they perfo:mud was a vehicle for extende<i solos and intense improvization .. Mr. Tyner was the last to take a solo in the first piece. He amazed the Chapel audience with his ineredible piano virtuosity. His lightning-quick fingers reminded one of John Mclaughlin's guitar playing. Mr. Tyner's compositions contain distinct latin and Indonesian elements. Franco's conga playing accentuated the Latin element, wnile his lack of restraint i!l performance detracted from the stage presence .of the other musicians. Mr. Tyner's compositions and solos sllow a great influence from his years with jazz-great J olln C<lltrane. The Coltran-esque consists of different ways .pf playing the changes to attain a wider array of colors and emoti-<>n-s. Tyner started playing as Coltrane's pianist at the age of thirteen, and did so until he. w-as nineteen. These are extremely formative years for any musician, and set tile stage for Mr. Tynet's present direction. by DEBBE DAMRELL The American Composers' Forum will bting Pulitzer-Prize- winning comp()ser Ned Rorem and his works to Union College~s Memorial Chapel at 8 p.m. Friday, Febmary 3.

II n CONCORDIENSlS, February I. --~----------------~--------~--------------~ Te·nure Decisions Continued from Page I commit~ee that an iQvestigation is being undertaken. If the candidate for tenure is a professor, his professional papers are sent to two prominent scholars who act as unbiased referees. \We try to get all the information we can about a . candidate for tenure,\ Provost Huntley said. \We try to look into all areas of his Work.\ After all these steps are taken, the chairman of the ad..:bot committee Writes a report that includes the committee's judgm~nt of th~! candidate's merit for receiving tenure. These ·reports ·can be very .. weighty,\ according to Prom~t Huntley, sometimes running I ;200 pages. This ·re,port is sent to :the Comrrtittee·on Faculty, which has jurisdiction over <1ll college personnel matters. This committee also discusses the candidate's eligibility for several hours with members of the ad-hoc commtitee. Following this, the committee reaches · a. decision on the candidates bid for tenure. About 4 of 5 C!lndidates for tenure receive it, according to Provost Htmtiey. \But the decision isn~t official until the Board of Trustees' Com-mittee on Academic Affairs approves the candidacy,\ Provost Huntley said. \'So copies of the ad.:hoc committee report are sent to board members, \Members of the Committee on Academic Affairs have come to .respect the decisions of the Cotnmiptee !>U Faculty. They usually confirm the committee's approvals without q liestion.\ Once a staff member receives tenure, he can usually continue working here for the remainder of his career, \although many people do leave to move on to other jobs,\ in . Provost Huntley;s words. A staff member who has been granted temrre caa only be dis.cha.rged either if the department in whi~:h he worked i~ discontinued or if the .individual is g1,1ilty of com1ni\ting a felony, sud as stealing or murder. \Neither has happened too often,\ Provost Huntley said. Most individuals who begin work at Union must roemain here fo·r 6 yeats before being considered for tenure. But the tenuring process can be shortened when · a distinguished .professor with previeus experience comes to the college. · The five staff members who have received tenure this year now are virtually guaranteed of a jot) for as 'long as they wish. \I'm very pleased to have received it,\ Professor Phaup said. ''I look forward to being able to take advantage of this opportunity to contribute to the Union community.\ Varsity Cheerleading As they proceed into their fourth full season, the Varsity Cheerleading squad is proving that they ate. here to stay, Led by captain Susan Rothenberg and co-captain Sari Gerb, this season's cheerleaders ~tre showing that they an~ determined to make their squad a permanent factor in the vanity spprts scene. This previous football season saw the squad encountering many difficulties within their own group, reflecting the unfortunate apathy of the Union campus towards the varsity football program. However, as basketball season nea,red, the U niort Dutchgirls solidified their squad. transportation, the Union Dutchgirls cannot go to many nf the varsity basketball games played at other college~. However, they have consistently shown their· dedicatipn to their squad and their team on the ltome court. Review Committee Joining captain Rothenberg and co-captain Gerb on the varsity basketball court are freshmen Liz Weisser and Susan i'¥mes, both of which have added a fresh outlook to the squad. Returning from last year's Dutchgirls are sophomores Patti Moran and Nanette Pasquini who saw the 76-77 cheerleading squad through a rough first year at Union College. They loo.k forward to next yeafs football and basketball seasons. New uniforms and transportation expenses will be available to the girls through their fund~raising -effort-s this year. Support these girls in their efforts to further a worthy group on our college campus. Continued from Page I In interpreting the charge, the committee made the following requests: 1. The Union College Board of . Trustees should set up a liaison committee with whom the Review Committee .can consult as ideas develop. 2. A person on the U~ion College campus should be appointed to . gather any data which might be needed by the committee,. and make appointments for the committee with people on campus. 3. Each trustee should be interviewed individually by members of the committee in an effert to help define ~tnd clarify the issues which the committee has been a~ked to resolve. 4, The committee· should visit the campus on January 26th and January 27th, 1978, to talk with various people in all areas of the college. 5. A preliminary rep()rt sh6uld be made available by the committee to the )loard of Trustees by the April 21-22nd board meeting. 6. Reports to the Board through the Liaison Committee be circulated at Union Colleg~ as widely as the B<.>atd des\res. With respect to the committee's first request, a Union College Board of Trustee Liaison Committee has been established. Serving in this capacity are Chairman of the Board ·Dr. Richard D. Day; Vice Chairman Thomas Hannigan, and Secretary Arthur Vash. Union College Provost William Huntley has been selected to serve as the on• campus liaison.. Some of the trustees have been interviewed by the committee, and interviews with the others are forthcoming. ihe committee began its review process with .a January 26th through January 27th visit and study of Union College. Some members of the faculty who were interviewed include Economics Professor E. Dwight Phaup, Distinguished Professor of History and higlter education Martin Lichterman, Acting Librarian Ruth Anne Evans, The Robert P. Patterson Professor of Government Joseph Board, Political Science Professors Charles Gati alld Byron Nichols, Biology Professor Willard Roth, Professor of English Hugh Alan Nelson and Professor of Music Hugh Allen Wilson. The questions asked by ihe committee were for the most part general·, and thus the responses which they received will probably be used to formulate an overall base fot takeoff. Part of the visit to the college included a general meeting held at the Schenectady Holiday Inn on Thursday evening, January 26th .. lt wa::; attended by the four UNION BOO.K needs photo· . gl'aphers, typists and people to work on layotJt.

VESTS FRYE BOOTS PR.O•KEDS ALL AT DISCOUNT PRICES com.mittee ·members an,d approximately 20 Union students. The purpose of the meeting was to solicit student feeling about the college. The general sentiment to come ou~ of the meeting was that President Bonner is the source of most or all of the \important\ problems at Union. The committee members tried to stimulate discussion on the broad area of student life on campus, but the students present at the meeting continued to blame Bonner and refused t:o be changed to another track of discussion. Thus, although no catch-phrase such as \campus review\ was ever coined by the Board of Trustees or the Review Committee, it appears that that is what Union College has before it. No one is now denying that, and as tbe direction of the committee is now official, any conclusions which they draw will be based on a long period of study. The Board of Trustees feels that justice will be served here, and that if .President Bonner is the root of marty of Union's major current problems, the committee's review will certainly lead to.,that deduction. .,.-.-.-----c .. . \. ·-· .-. !PA,RENTS' WEEKEND date! . !has been set for May S, 6 and j !7.

As a result, Binghamton not only tied the score, but in turn, went ahead by two points .... Enter Steve Abba. Abba, a junior substitute, came off the bench to catapult the Dutchmen. His scoring was insignificant, his hustle and \offensive rebounding show\ inspired the Dutchmen. Soon the momentum, which had been exchanged throughout the contest, seemed to be in Union's favor. Union missed a shot, Abba alertly scrambled for the rebound, Binghamton tried to fast break and Abba cut off the outlet pass. A mishandled ball fell loose on the floor, Abba dove, recovering the ball, setting up Tony Coles for two points. Yet Binghamton did not fold, hitting several clutch baskets during the waning minutes of the game. After a series of missed foul shots, both teams deadlocked, forcing the overtime. Ten seconds after the opening overtime tipoff, Union scored. Seconds Ia ter So bosi nski connected again. (Just one of his remarkable 10 field goal performances). Before Binghamton could regroup, Union had scored again, this time by K. R.

Union's top scorer, Sobosinski had 21 points, Cardney tallied 16, and captain Smith connected for 15. The Dutchmen visit rival Albany later this week. One can only hope for a traditional match- up played with the intensity that Union demonstrates so often. 5pOrt5 Hot-handed Greg Sobocinski. Swimmers Falter by PETE MARTINI After opening their season on an encouraging note by defeating Hartwick, the Union College swim team lost to both Trinity and Kings Point last week. A scheduled rneet with Hobart was snowed out and has been rescheduled for February 19. Against Trinity last Wednesday, host Union was defeated 59-49. Encouraging performances were turned in by Andy Berquist, who won tbe 1000 meter freestyle; Doug Richardson in the 500 freestyle and Mark Peronto who beat his nearest competitor by a good four seconds in the 200 meter butterfly. Wes Jakovic was only one tenth of a second off first place in the 50 meter freestyle. Co-captain Jim Lowe continued his fine breaststroke performances by winning the 200 meter race. At Kings Point on Saturday, the Merchant Marines handed Union their second straight defel;lt, 71-42. Doug Richardson, this year's most consistent point getter, won the 500 meter free- style and finished sec~nd to a record setting performance by a Marine in the 200 meter. In the 200 butterfly, Peronto was tough again but his fate was the same as Richardson's in the 200 freestyle as another Kings Point swimmer broke an Academy record. The relay team of Tom Burgess, Jakovic, Phil Hubner, and Richardson were victorious, providing Union with one of its few bright spots on its trip to Long Island. Today the swim team travelled to Albany, who are always eJ~.cellent and this year are enjoying their best year ina while. On S,aturday, February 4, N orwick comes to Uaion after last year's victory which was preceded by a four year Garnet domination. This is Union's last home meet until they finish· the regular season on February 21 against Oneonta, so come give your support. -.........-- UColl's Record-Breaking All-American-------,--- Bob Moffat, a senior from Stamford, Connecticut, is this issue'sathlete of the week. Moffat's st():ry at Union is an unusual one. ln high school the two-sport star was recruited by Union- for basketball. Once at Union, Moffat turned his attention to running. At first, his fortunes faltered and his future looked bleak. ln fact, there was one point in his first year that Moffat faced the prospect of never running again. \After l hurt my knee'' refened Moffat to the torn ligaments that required a ca:st for two months, \I wasn't sure where 1 was going. After l got back on the track, though, my nind was made up to do some good running.\ And what ~:unning it has been for the lanky speedster. Running year-round and following a strenuous weight-lifting program, the tightly-Ill uscled senior burst into Union in the middle of his junior year~ At a race in Syracuse, Moffat turned in a 600 yard dash. ·of 1:10.8, which for weeks was the fastest in the nation. A:.fter a grueling season that induded numerous fieldhouse and Union records, the economics major came through with a second place finish in the National Championships, earning him All- American honors. The spring season saw tnore of the same from Moffat. As in indoor track, he raced ·in four events and <mce again was undefeated and earned A11- American honors. Summertime and fall were devoteg to training, and last week it was back to some serious running for Moffat, ' Bob Moffat, Athlete of the Week In the Plattsburgh meet, the Garnet workhouse won two individual events 1n new fieldhouse record times and contributed to a winning mile relay effort. Moffat's time in the 300, J2.4, was . a new Union College record, h1s second of the seasoh so far (at Dartmouth last week, Moffat, in third place, was clocked in 1:03.2, or .2 seconds off the world record in the 500 meter dash). Moffat is also an excellent student. Since brief academic troubles in his freshman year, the speedster has yet to fail to make the Dean's List, and presently can boast a 4.0 cum in his major of economics. Moffat, a school record-holder in countless events, is happy with his situation at Union, but is nevertheless troubled by the present athletic problems the school is facing. As a promising sophomore, and a nationally respected junior, Moffat's invitatioils to races in such places as New York City, San Francisco, and Philadelphia would si~ply go unacted upon amidst the turmoil in the athletic departtnent. This situation will hopefully be rectified by the end of this season, before Union loses its only Bob Moffat for perhaps another generation. It should be noted, though, that as the first major indoor .track meet of the· season, the Millros~ games in Madison Square Garden were getting underway, Moffat was home in bed, awaiting a 3\1'2 hour bus trip to Plattsburgh the next morning. i-EightNational AAU 30~' :kilometer championsbips will~ ; be on the line Sunday, March' : 19, in the fifth annual : Bankathon - the Sehenec· :.· tady to.

The mile relay team comprised of Scheuer, Moffat, Matt Guilfoyle and Pete Vielkind was again victorious. The final score was 68 points or Plattsburgh, 56 points for Union. and 44 points for Colgate. However, Union set three new records for the hosts' fieldhouse. Ce-captain Kevin Scheuer t inished the 1000 yard run in 2:15.2, a second faster than his previous week's time.

Women's Hoop Edged By EPHS by LYNN BATEMAN When one considers the excellent basketball team which Williams has fielded in the past three years, one can see why Union's women were psyched to beat their last opponents last Wednesday. Williams had clobbered Union in the past three years, and this aura emanated confidence from the Ephwomen, but Union was ready. Right from the first jump ball Union dominated the game, in what turned out to be a low scoring yet high excitement game with both teams tied at half-time. Williams had difficulty getting through Union's man to man defense and' had to depend on outside shots, which was not to their advantage, but certainly to Union's as forwards Debbie Sears, Jill Henry and Sandy Key snagged rebound after rebound. There was fine hustling play by Andrea Bowers, Sheila O'Donnell and Kathy Lett also, as they made their presence known on the court by their continual harassment of Williams. Unfortunately, half-time break appeared to be what the doctot ordered for Williams, ·as they came out super-psyched and hustling even harder. This fast breaking allowed them to gain a lead on Union of several points, which the Dutchwomen could not regain as the last few minutes· ran out, with Williams victorious 44- 36. Jill Henry was high scorer with 10 points, and has the distinction of averaging 15 rebounds per game. Y au can look forward to the Dutchwomen winning more of their games, as they continue their long schedule, having played New Paltz Tuesday night, and the calculating women from RPI here at home at 6:00 Thursday night. Come cheer your team on. and watch them send their crosstown rivals home in defeat. . e:xcu~~' in losing to Plattsburgh, Coach J~uues cited one situation which burt · U niort in the final standin;gs. Plattsburgh grabbed the fitst three places in the shot put, gi¥ing them a quick ten poin~. James had anticipated that Colgate, with their team who putted 50 feet, would help Union by cutting down on the possible points that . Plattsburgll could obtain. · However, this failed to · · occur. Coach James was also disappointed that Union did not gain atiY points in the 50-yard dash, a usual strong event for the Dutchmen, and Plattsburgh instead collected 5 points. The meet st~ll turned out to be close with the whole Union team putting out maximum effort Yet with: more runners· than lJnion, Plattsburgh added to its strength and this showed in the final results. Union now turns its attention to its next meet {Sunday I :00 p.m.) at home against Oswego and Springfield. Coach · James again expects another close meet with both Oswego and Spring- field having many strengths. James is especially looking ferward to the mile relay teams. This will be the final event of the day and might very well decide the winning school. lt Will be the climax to. what should be very intense competition. As such, the meet could provide· an e~cellent opportunity to chase those Sunday blues away, while at the same time seeing some of the best track competition on the entire East Coast. Olympic Reps at Union lhe 1980 Winter Olympics are coming to Union College February 4. That's when Shelia Young, gold medalist in speedskating in the 1976 Olympics, and two of the leaders of .the organizing com- mittee for the 1980 Games in Lake Placid will be visiting the campus. Ronald MacKenzie, president of the Lake Placid Olympic Organizing Committee (LPOOC), and J. Beriiard Fell, the LPOOC's executive director, will join Miss Young in a presentation about the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid. Their appearance in Union's Memorial Chapel , will begin at 7:30PM. They'll be talking about how lake Placid, a small village in the Adirondacks that .hosted the 1932 Winter Olympics, became the host si~e ·f-or the 1980 Games. Their presentation, Which will include· a film about Lake Placid and the surrounding ski i:l,reas, as well · as the construction of Olympic facilities, will provide the members of the audience that night with up-to-the-minute information about preparation for the Olympics. \The Olympics are only about two years away,\ said Barry S;ymonds, a student at Union. \This is a great opportunity to find. out What's. happening up there, After all,. Lake Placid's only about a three h.our drive from Schenectady.\ Miss Young, Rev. Fell, and Mr. MacKenzie will answer questions after the program; which I will cover all phases of Olympic activity and will include information about the ski areas around Lake Placid that will be used in the 1.980 Olympics, and are now open to the public. It's sure to be a lively session. Luke Patnode, who is director of pUblic relations for the Olympics and Will also be coming to Union, said, \They respond very well to direct inquiry, and don't duck any questions.\ Admission to the event is 75 cents with a Union College 10 and $1 for the general public. So if there's anything you'd like to know about the I 980 Winter Olympics, then come to Memorial Chapel at Union College on February 4 at 7:30 PM tofind out the very latest information. UColl Team Curls And Gets Whirled by DAN ROSENBAUM A team from the Union College Curling Club· traveled to Albany this weekend to participate in the 16th New York State Governor's Bowl bonspeil. The inexperienced squad met with its expected fate; it lost all three of its games. The organization of a bonspeil is somewhat odd· to one accustomed to single elimination events. It is usually made up of three different events. In the Governor's Bowl the first event is called the Governor's Bowl; the second event, the Patroon Plate; and the third event, the Fort · Orange Cup. Each team is guaranteed at least three games. Those that win all three prelims play down for the first event. Those that win two out of the three play off for the second event, and those that win only the third are in the running for the third event. That way, all teams have. a chance to win an event until they have finished al1 their games. The Union team, headed by Steve Breiterifeld and including Keith Dropkin, Bill Moss, and Dan Rosenbaum, was far outmatched. The combined experience of the Union squad was less than that of a single member of any team it faced. As a result, it was beaten rather badly. In the bonspeil's opening match held Thursday night, Union was shelled by an excellent team sent by the Schenectady Curling Club. Despite the lopsided score{Union won only two of eight ends) the team was warmly applauded for the ends it did win. Its second game, Friday afternoon, was lost by a somewhat smaller margin to a different Schenectady squad . (They sent five different teams!) The third and final match was iost by a small margin of only four points to a Rochester team that went on to win the Fort Orange Cup. The first event was taken by Schenectady #I, skipped by Don Beeler, while the Patroon Plate was won by Schenectady #3, headed by SWede Gable. I I iff1 ..,. ap Ct co af re< pa WI F! F!

A..cco rding to Huntley, \the best interests of Union College are hest served .by having Mr. Shupe continue in his present role.

Student Forum Gathers by MURRAY LEVISON The Student Forum met for their · weekly meeting Monday night. After the minutes were approved, Matt Nagorsky of Concordiensis spoke. He was' concerned about the fact that after the Student Forum requested a weekly column in the paper, little interest was shown in writing for it. He asked that the Forum appoint a member of the Forum ea<;:h week to write that week~s column, with no one writing ·twice in a row. It was agreed that tbe column shauld be continued and that the guidelines suggested by the Editors be followed .as closely as possible. President Gan~ then brought up the question of why the Editors of Concordy weregetting free dinners at the Pub. Nagorsky stated that Concordy used to exchange a 3\x4\ space in the paper for soda and sandwiches on Tuesday night when the paper was being put together. As the quality and. quantity ·of the foed was decreasiJ:!g, the Manager of the Pub ·suggested that the staff ,get six dinners a week in exchange for this space. The dinners were to be rotated amongst the staff members on Tuesday nights, at which they could discuss that night's work while eating. Murray Levison moved that \Concordiensis shall determine who is to be charged for ads and so cha.rge; and that Concordiensis, if they so desire, shall make refreshments available to the paper's staff on the night that the paper is put together, at their · own expense.\ This motion was defeated. A motion to make the previous statement. a ''sense of the f()fum'\ and a further motion to table, did not receive seconds. Finally, Andy Koblenz proposed that Concordiehsis determine those who shollld be billed and allocate funds for food in a responsible manner. The statement was presented as a \sense of the Forum,'' and this was approved. John Tydings reported on the work of the Educational Policy Committee. A subcommittee of EPC approved a change in the grading system to ail II point system, as well as a chang~ in the deadline for withdrawal from courses to receive a \W'' to the lOth wee)c. Both proposals will go to the full committee soon. President Ganz proposed that the Student Forum recommend to the EPC that they begin te do serious work on the proposjJI for an H onot's Curriculum. This proposal, submitted by Prof. Michols, has been in the EPC for one year now. Ganz's proposal passed.

Mr. Shupe went on to say that1 \Many faculty members and administrators had approached me, expressed their confidence and said they didn•t agree with the recommendations · of the committee... I don't see my continuing at Union being at odds with faculty as a whole.\ by DAVID GOSS One of the major re~ponsibilities of the Educational Po.licy Committee lies ill the area o( curricular and educational innovation. Since the beginning o( this academic year, a large portion of time has been spent by the EPC discussing the implementation of an honors program at Union. Recently, Professor Neal Allen, Chairman ()f the Educational Policy Committee, distributed a report to the 'EPC entitled Honors: An Alternative Proposal. The report, Allen ·explains, was presented \for consideration, aware that details - both large and small ~ will need careful attention.\ (This article will discuss some of the aspects .of Professor Allen's proposal and raise some points, meant to be constructive, concerning action to be taken by the EPC.) The need for an honors pro- gram has been established. One point, on which all EPC members seem to agree, is that this program should have its own physical facility. As Allen points out, this center is essential as a setting within which the honors program can develop. Allen also ex:presses his feeling that the Steinmetz name should be attached to the program. These two ideas were both contained in Byron Nichol's 31 .. page report, \Proposal to Create an Honors Program at Union College: The Stejnmetz. Curriculum\ (JaJ1\lary 197.7), which was responsible for initiating qiscussion of an honors program within the EPC. Due to the existence of different opinions among EPC members. implementation of this program has not occurred as soon as several faculty member& and many students had hoped. This should be one of the main concerns of the EPC, Hopefully, committee members will be flexible and conciliatory in order to reach an effective compromise within the next month, so that an honors program can be implemented by September. This is not to downplay the importance of the underlying pt:inciples behind the program; it is merely a call for some type of decision to be made by the committee. As Professor Allen proposes, participants in the honors program \shall be involved in indepenqent research projects or in equivalent creative endeavor, during the terrn(s) of their appointment.\ Their acceptance into this program will be based \in part on their promise of being ready to share a common interest in each others work, and an engagement to participate in a program of informal and occasional formal colloquia.\ Furthermore, Professor Allen suggests that D()t more than fifteen students would be selected per .term. during the initial year of the program. Also under Allen's prop<>sal, Union would \establish a center, to be known as the Steinmetz Center.\ Participants in the honors program would be expected to attend activities which include bi-weekly informal meetings and the appearance of a Steinmetz lecturer at least twice during the term. Each participant in the honors program would receive credit for three term courses upon finishing a one-term Steinmetz project. Open for discussion among committee members is the question of what cumulative grade point average should he the eligibility criterion for this Continued on 'Page 10 Although he never approached anyone about the possibility of !tis staying, Director Shupe has expressed a fondness for Union owing to the fact tllat he is both an employee and an alumnus. He has a desire to help the institution and feels he can do so by adding some continuity to an administration that has been rattled by recent resignations and <terminations. Shupe is one of the .four or five l<mgest serving administrators. having been employed by Union since his graduation in 1967. Byron Nichols, author of honors proposal

; iJ ''.', .. I ··J . t .. , ,I, Page.2 . Editorials Surprise! During April of 1977, Admissions Director Jay Shupe submitted his formal resignation which was to be inacted at the pleasure of the college. Due to the heated and controversial events which besieged the campus, hts resignatton was delayed pending the investigation of the Allen Committee. The committee, which was charged to explore the improprieties in admissiom, especially those related to the hockey program, strongly recommended that the Admissions director be given a one-year non- renewable contract which would terminate at the end of the 1977-78 academic year. rhe recent· announcement made by the Provost, regardmg an extended contract lor Admissions Director Shupe comes as a complete surprise to Concordiensis. Concordiensis strongly disagrees with the action of the Provost. The lack ot regard for the findings of the Allen Committee stands in the foreground of Concordiensis' disagreement. The unfavorable view of the action is compounded by the apparent suddenness of the action and the lack of communication within the campus concerning the issue. In addition, the rationale pre~ented by the Provost also appears to be shallow considering the seventy of the situation. Clearly, Union does need experienced and qualified administrators. However, Concordiensis believes that such individuals should possess the highest regard for administrative integrity. The documented proof that Shupe altered the proper admissions process warrants the action recommended by the Allen · Committee. Furthermore, if Provost Huntley believes that the Admissions Director is the second most important administrative .post, then why is he so rapidly willing to place someone in that position who has a questionable background. with regard to that position'! rhis process ol avoiding or disregarding the recommendations of various committees within the governance structure is not unprecedented. The Davenport Committee's suggestions of last spring went largely unheralded. Concordiensis would like to know why these types of actions are being taken by key administrators at a time when Union is attempting to right itself by claiming that openness and honesty are the crucial factors. · Also, because it has been suggested that a positive associ~tion eX\isted between the Admissions Violations and the Presid:.:nt, Concordy can only ponder the implications of the reversal <JI the Allen Committee recommendations and the granting of the extended contract. Forum Speechless As stated in the page one article, the Student Forum agreed Monday .night to continue their weekly column that appears opposite this page. It is obvious that the \Forum View\ column this week is nothing more than the agenda of the February 9th All College Senate meeting; an agenda that was prepared a full two weeks ago. Obviously, this was not the intent of this column as originally proposed by the Editors of Concordiensis. The column was designed so that the members of the forum could express their interpretation of campus events, ideas or suggestions or anything else that they felt would help to inform the Student Body of the issues and allow the forum to act more responsibly as their representatives. Apparently, these 18 representatives of the Student Body in the Governance System of Union College either have: I. Absolutely nothmg to say. 2.

LETTERS tenure denied Editors of Concordiensis: It was sad to note that Concordiensis failed to mention in last week's article on tenured faculty, that Professor James Kenney of the economics department did not get tenure. I don't know how you could have missed such an important decision. I suspect· Professor Kenney's appeal will be a controversial and well- supported issue, rivaling the Stineback tenure decision debacle of 74-75. In my four years at Union, I have come to know Professor Kenney, and I feel he is one of the most admirable members of our faculty. Let me review some of the. things that the t~nure committee must have reviewed: --Professor Kenney is chairman of the most important and time-consuming committees on campus (Planning & Priorities); -his rapport with most stu-dents is excellent; -his support cf Union's athletics- malctand female- .is unquaJified as anyone who attends some of Union's leSser known athletic events knows; -he has received grants for his work and has had much of it published; -and as a teacher (in my opinion) was interesting and well-informed. It is hard, to imagine what criteria were used in judging Professor Kenney and why he was denied tenure (the reasons l have heard from informed are simply unjustifiable}. and it is discouraging to know that our s-ch.ool newspaper was not even aware of this important decision. I hope that in the future Concordy does a bit more investigating to find out what , is going on, on <:amptis, and that students like myself who believe that Professor Kenney is getting the shaft, will speak up.

Ihe recent· announcement made by the Provost, regardmg an extende<l contract tor Admissions Director Shupe comes as a complete ~urpnse to Concordiensis. ('oncordiensis strongly disagrees w1th the action of the Provost. lhe lack ol regard for the findings ol the Allen l'ommittee stands in the foreground of Concorrliensis' disagreement. !he unfavorable view of the action is compounded by the apparent suddenness of the action and the lack ot com mumcatton within the campus concerning the issue. In addition, the rationale presented by the Provost also appears to be shallow considering the ~evt:rity of the situation. Clearly. Lnion does need experienced and qualified administrators. However, Concordiensis believes that such individuals should possess the highest regard for administrative integrity. I he documented proof that Shupe altered the proper admissions process warrants the action recommended by the Allen Committee. Furthermore, if Provost Huntley believes that the Admissions Director is the second most important administrative post, then why 1s he so rapidly willing to place someone in that position who has a questionable background. with regard to that position'! l\his process of avoiding or disregarding the recommendations of various committees within the governance structure is not unprecedented. The Davenport Committee's suggestions of last spring went largely unheralded. Coocordiensis would like to know why these types of actions are being taken by key administrators at a time when Union is attempting to right itself by claiming that openness and honesty are the crucial factors. Also, because it has been suggested that a positive association existed between the Admissions Violations and the Presid(;nt. ConcorGy can only ponder the implications of the reversal tJl the Allen ~·ommittee recommendations and the granting of the extende<l contract Forum Speechless As stated in the page one article, the Student Forum agreed Monday night to continue their weekly column that appears opposite this page.

New regulations for \Pass/Fail\ grading from Educational .Policy Committee (see belo\v). 3. Proposal for a change in .calendar from Student Forum (see below). 4. New Business. PROPOSAL i<~OR A CALENDAR CHANGE Whereas, there has been a problem with the Jewish holidays at the beginning of the school year, Whereas. the first three days of classes in the Fall term and the last two days of classes before Thanksgiving vacation are poorly attended, It is then proposed that the beginning of Orientation for incommg Freshman and transfers be formally started two days earlier than has previously been done (Thursday instead of Saturday). By moving Orientation up two days, the first day of class will sta-rt on that l'ollow;ng Monday. Since classes will have started on a Monday rather thaa1 a Wednesday, there is no need for the \hal.f· week'' right before the Thanksgiving vacation. This proposal then calls for classes to end on the Friday instead of the fuesday belore Thanksgiving. NEW REGULATIONS FOR \PASS/fo.AlL\ GRADING On January 26, the Education Policy Committee approved the following new regulations to be considered for legislative action by the College Senate at its next regular meeting. L These regulations replace all previous \pass/fail\ legislation by the Faculty Council and· College Senate. 2. In order to explore areas of the curriculum substantially distant from previous or current course experience, a student may take one course in each academic year to be graded on a \pass/fair· bas1s. The course must be outside the department(s) of the student's major and should normally be selected from beyond the division(s) of the student's major. 3. A student who desires to take a course on these conditions. must notify the Registrar before the end of the first week of the term; on a form provided for that purpose. Consent of the instructor and a statement concerning standards of performance to be .inet for a passing grade are required .. 4. Courses taken on a \pass/fail\ basis may not be used to meet Liberal Learning or major re.quirements. Instructors will submit letter grades, and the Registrar will transfer the grade of a student taking a course \pass /fail\ to either pass ( P) or fail (F). Neither grade~will .affect the term. or cumulative academic indices. Should a stude.nt change to a new major field, grades in courses previously taken in that field on a \pass/fail\ basis will be changed to a letter grade.

Grades thus changed may not revert back to \.pass/fail\ no matter what future changes in major may be made. 5. This legislation will become effective as of September l, 197K Rationale: In studying patterns of student course selection under the current \pass/fail'' regulations, the EPC found substantial evidence of widespread disregard for a principal objective of the original \pass/fail\ legislation. According to a report prepared in 1971, the \pass/fail~' system was intended to encourage \curricular venturesotnepess\ among students through exploration of cpurse offerings .. in fields distant from their majors.\ \Pass/fail\ enrollment patterns for tbe year 1976-77 indicate that a little more than half of the enrollments were within the same center as the student's lnajor and one fourth were in the same division as the student's major. The Committee also found that use of the \pass/fail\ option had decreased from 6.1% of all enrollments in 1970/71 (the first year of the \pass/fail\ option) to 2.8o/c of all enrollments in 1976-77. The Committee,. after considering this information, concluded that the objective of .. curricular venturesomeness\ would be better served if the \pass/fail\ option became linked to a carefully constructed plan arranged by stud~nt and instructor. Such an agreement, based upon clear understanding of .rationale and standards, could provide both the support and the supervision cond~cive. to attaimnt'lnt of positive education goals.

I l r d n r roller derby Dear Editors: I did not attend the Union vs. Colgate hockey game on Feb. 4, but I am told that the violence was warmly received by at least a portion of the hometown crowd.

NEW REGULATIONS FOR \PASS/FAIL\ GRADING On January 26, the Education Policy Committee appro\Cd the following new regulations to be considered for legislative action b~ the College Senate at its next regular meeting. I. These regulations replace all previous \pass/fail\ legislatlo n by the Faculty Council and College Senate. 2. In order to explore areas of the curriculum substantially dtstam from previous or current course experience, a student may take one course in each academic year to be graded on a \pass/fa11'' l>asts. The course must be outside the department(s) of the student's najor and should normally be selected from beyond the division(s) of the student's major. 3. A student who desires to take a course on these conditions must notify the Registrar before the end of the first week of the term, on a form provided for that purpose. Consent of the instructor and a statement concerning standards of performance to be met for a passing grade are required. 4. Courses taken on a \pass/fail\ basis may not be used to meet Libera! Learning or major requirements. Instructors will submit letter grades, and the Registrar will transfer the grade of a stLLdent taking a course \pass/fail\ to either pass (P) or fail (F). ~either grade will affect the term or cumulative academic indices. Should a student change to a new major field, grades in courses previously taken in that field on a \pass/fail\ basis will be changed to a letter grade. Only under this set of circumstances may a pass gracle be translated back into a letter grade. Grades thus changed may not revert back to \pass/fail\ no matter what future changes in najor may be made. 5. This legislation will become effective as oJ September I, 1978. Rationale: In studying patterns of student cour.se selection under the current \pass/fail\ regulations, the EPC found substantial evidence of widespread disregard for a principal objective of the onginal \pass/fail\ legislation. According to a report prepared in 1971 ~ the \pass/fail\ system was intended to encourage ··curncular venturesomeness\ among students through exploration of cp.urse offerings \in fields distant from their majors.\ ··Pass/ fail\ enrollment patterns for the year 1976-77 indicate that a little more than half of the enrollments were within the same center as the student's major and one fourth were in the same division as the student's major. The Committee also found that use of the \pass/fail\ option had decreased from 6.1% of all enroll mens in 1970/71 (the first year of the \pass/fail\ option) to 2.89C cd all enrollments in 1976~77 .. The Committee,. after considering this information, concluded that the objective of \curricular venturesomeness\ would be b<etter served if the \pass/fail\ option became linked to a carefully constructed plan arranged by student and instructor.

The place: The Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Student anti-war demonstrators battle with Chicago police. Scores of demonstrators and police are badly wounded. AltHough this riot and the police tactics used to suppress it were unprecedented and caused a tremend·ous natienal uproar, the incident underscored the fact that not o'nly was such a demonstration ineffective considering the amount of people involved, but the fear and antagonism caused by this violent, \radical\ action, set the student movement far back. That episode and other less prominent demonstration·s showed that although students · can have a voice when we commit ourselves to a cause, we must have ·more organization and &ophistication to deal with the complex social issues of our time. Problems of cot.porate · and gove.rnment rip-offs are subHer and less obvious injustices than those exemplified by slogans such .as \Peac·e Now,\ .. End Segregation,'' or \Cleanse the Earth.\ Marching up and down a. ·tiver .bank chanting \End Pollution Now\ won~t dean up he river. Symbolic efforts will not do - hard res~arch, data collection and .effective presentations are the answers. Since such disciplines already go on. in every academic institution, why c:an't acadetnics aM social reform go hand in hand?

Day, Jr. a 1939 Union graduute, was elected chairman of the college's Board of Trustees at a Board meeting in N'!w York City Januuary 25. Dr. Day was first elected to the Board by· Union· alumni in 1973. His current term of office expires in 1981. . Dr. Day received an Alumni Gold Medal in 1974 to honor his work as chairman of the college's annual fund drive for two consecutive years. He has served as chairfllan of the Union College Committee on· the Medical Professions and as an alumni class agent and local alumni club officer. He succeeds Samuel B. Fortenbaugh, Jr., a member of the Union class of 1923, as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Fortenbaugh, who will remain on the Board, has been a Board member since 1963 and chairman since 1969. Under his chairman- ship, a $7million science and engineering center was opened here. Other officers named at the meeting were: Vice-chairman, Thomas E. Hanigan, Jr., a member of the Union class of 1944; Secretary, Arthur M. Vash, a 1951 Union graduate; and General Counsel, Arnold I. Burns, a 1950 Union graduate. Mr. Hanigan, the Board's new Vice-chairman, became a Union Trustee in 1969. In 1973 he was named to the Council of Union's Institute of Administration and Management. He has served as a member of the Executive Committee of the college's New York .Alumni Club. He is also a past chairman of Union's Terrace Council, a group of major college .supporters. Mr. Burns, new general counsel, has been a trustee since 1976. His current term will end in l9SO. He has twice served as national chairman of the college's annual fund drive, and is current chairman of the Terrace Council. The Board's new secretary, Arthur M. Vash, has been a Union trustee since 1971, and his current term of office ends in 1979. He has served as an alumni admissions representative and as chairman of the college's Boston- area capital campaign fund drive. In other action at the January 25 meeting, the Board approved the appointment of four leading educators as consul!ants. Named were George Hazzard, Robert Wood, David Robinson, and J.L. Zwingle. The consultants have been retained \to assist the Board in charting ·a course that would be most effective for the future of Union College both in the short and long_ range. To the extent necessary, the performance of the Trustees, the President, the Administration. the Faculty, and the Students should he reviewed.\ Chairman Day also announced that the executive committee of the Union College Alumni Council had sent the Board a letter outlining issues that alumni feel are of primary importance to the well-being of the college. The issues outlined include the mission of the college; admissions policies, standards, and procedures; the role of athletics; the college governance structure and the college's relationship to Invincibility During December of 1977, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi appeared on \Good Morning America,\ \The Merv Griffin Show\ and \The Dick .Cavett Show.·; His message to the United States and to the world is that 1978 is the Year of Invincibility for all nations. The genet.al connotation of invincibility is being so powerful (i.e. with weapons) that no other nation or nations could attack one nation and really harm it, let alone conquer it. However, there is another type of invincibility which is better. This is a nation that is so powerful in terms of being a positive influence, that it does not even allow the birth of an enemy. Since all nations ~hat exist already have their share of enemies, invincibility would. inclUde dissolvimt the cause of conilict and disallowing any more to be created. T)).e basis of invincibility is the Transcendental Meditation Sidhi program. This program develops higher states of consciousm;:ss in individuals througli th~ .practice of tbe T.M. sidhis or super- normal abilities su~h as flying, invisibility and others. With ·enough people practicing this program in each nation. it can make the nations invincible. Every individual has a role in helping himself and his nation to become invincible. On Thursday night at 8:00 p.m. in Student Activities outer office, Feb. 9, SIMS Club will show a videotape of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi speaking on the Role of the Student in making a nation invincible. Admission is free and all ar~ welcome. the community. Dr. Day said that these issues will form an important part of the board's agenda for the coming months. He said that the Board will work closely with the president and the administration to resolve these issues. Dr. Richard Day, newly e/ecied Chairman of the Board of Trustees. Although NY PIRG does work on politically-related topics, it is not a political organization ally mote than an investigative journalist· belongs to a political organization. The concept behind NYPIRG is simple: Effective action on state and local issues can best be achieved by a ·pooling of resources and a centralization of action, as· opposed to a small. single..campus group. This is, of course, an important advantage for a school th~ size of Union witlt its limited resources. At a time when Union College's i ri:la g e i s s u ff e ring , a n organization such as NYPIRG could restore Union's public face through publicity of our student's i\}vestlgative empirical research. Whatever your political· views, N YPIRG is a great chance to get involved in important issues.

Many people are unaware that representatives of Kappa Sigma, a fraternity which died out at Union in the late 1960's, visited h~re in an. attemr>t to begin rechartering a chapter at Union College. Two members of Kappa Sigma's national organization visited with potential Union College Kappa Sigmas for about a week. The visit ended with a reception attended by the national members. local Kappa Sigma Alumnae, and interested Union students. Kappa Sigma was fpunded at the University of Virginia in 1869, It is one of the larger national fraternities with 182 chapters and colonies. THE SOCIETY OF WO·. .

Before Kappa Sigma can be rechartered_, the College must grant its approval.Joe Zolner, the Direc.tor of Student Development, is presently examining the issue. He would ·appreciate advice from any interested party. Although · the Pan-Hellenic Council cannot at this time take a formal stand on the issue, the aUthors of this column will attempt to explain some of the different possible views of the situation. First, considering Union's history a's far as fraternities are concerned, there should be no objections to the addition of another new fraternity. After all, the first three fraternities in the United States were founded here because of a wholesome attitude · towards them.

Also, Union College has within the past year seen the rechartering of one ·fraternity (Zeta Beta Tau) and the new .chartering of two sororities (Delta Gamma and Sigma Delta T ~11). Then, what is the problem with another fraternity? Since 1970, when Union went co-ed, the number of Greek students has been on the decline Of course, this was not unex.pected since co-eds could not join Greek Societies until this year. Moreover, this fall saw one of · the sharpest declines in numbers of pledges over the last ten years. Therefore, the admission of a new fraternitY might further divide a declining number of students who wish to join Greek societies. It could possibly lead to the downfall of some of the smaller houses.

CONCORDIENSIS; February 8; 1978 Page5 culture \Man\ Gets Fitted Out by ALICE TUFEL Up in the costume shop of the Nott Memorial, Susanne Frisch is busy designing costumes for the up-and-coming production of A Man For All Seasons. What is so special about Ms. Frisch are her impressive credentials.. She graduated from Queens College in 1974 with a BA in drama. In addition to working on the costumes for the Broadway productions of Bubbling Brown Sugar, Sergeant Pepper, and Joseph Papp's Hamlet, she also did costumes for Ed,ward Albee's Seascape, starring Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr and Frank Langella. She has worked on costumes for off-B'i:oadway productions and the New York City Ballet, as well. In the fashion industry, Susanne's experience includes work for Jessie Dorio in New York City as assistant to designer Victor Whitehurst. She also designed the costumes for the 1976 Mountebanks production of The Tempest, which are still in excellent condition. In preparation for designing the costumes of this term's Mountebanks production, Susanne did quite a bit of research. She began by becoming familiar with the play itself, and studying the time period in which it takes place (1526-1534 ). Pouring over books on the history of fashion. Susanne began to get ideas as to what type of clothes were Worn during tl;.at period. In designing (he costumes, she also considers the personalities of the characters and their interrelationships with one another. For each character she makes a sketch of the costume that he or she will wear. Precise measurements are made for each actor and actress, and work on the costumes begins. In addition to the main outfit, shoes, belts, hats and any other accessories that are needed are custom- designed for each character. As the costumes begin to take shape, the actors and actresses involved in the play are called in for additi-onal fittings so that everything fits exactly as it should. Ms. frisch is also doing a great deal to help those involved in the play to become accustomed to their costumes. Women will have to wear a \bum roll,\ an undergarment shaped like a tube, which i~ worn around the hips to accentuate the figure. Certain postures, stances and ways of walking must be practi.ced so that the actors and actresses will be as comfortable in their costumes as they would I be in their own clothes. The lack of pockets in the clothes of that period is another element which the characters will have to get used to and work with. Susanne Frisch works in the costume shop Monday-Friday, until 5:30 and many evenings. With her are several students who, under her watchful gaze and careful instructions, are helping to put the costumes together. If anyone is interested in helping with costumes. contact Susanne in. the Nott Memorial costume shop. There is plenty of work to be done! In all, there are 22 costumes to be made, as several of the 14 characters have 3 costumes each and it is a monumental task considering the nature of the clothes Worn during the eal'ly IS.OO's, and the short amount of time given for the costumes to be completed. Susanne is also working with the director, Barry Smith, and the set designer, Charles Steckler. Of Barry and Charlie, Susanne says, \I think very highly of them, professionally and as people, too.\ She first met them while working on The Tempest, through a teacher who both she and Charlie knew from Queens College. Bec~use Susanne enjoyed working on The Tempest, she came back this term to do A Man For All Seasons. When vhe play is put on, every aspect of it must be taken care of professionally in order to assure optimum performance. Through · the proposed Theatre Artist Program (TAP), Union has been able to bring in guest artists. TAP - would provide the college with the best professional theatre exposure possible. It would also enable students to take advantage of workshops in many areas such as mi.me, voice, theatre management, playwriting and sound.. and electronics, among others. Although we were lucky enough to have Susanne Frisch design the costumes for A Man For All Seasons, she is not here through TAP. Unfortunately, TAP is still a proposal, and it has yet to receive any steady endowments. If Union is to continue to be able to afford such talents as Ms. Frisch, the college ... i •' Lady Alice /~/ community must be aware of the Y. need for endowments for TAP, \ . i and support such programs \ \ wholeheartedly. Only in this way can Union continue to enjoy drama at its best. In the mean time, the Mountebanks are working as hard as they can· to produce the best play they can. and with the impressive costumes designed by Susanne Frisch, A Man For All Seasons is one show that no one should miss!

This is only one ot the many films to be presented to awaken appreciation of the arts. (See the film schedule in Concordy's Feb. l issue.) The birth of photography is well .. documented and illustrated by the complementary pioneer work of Louis-Jacques-Mande Daguerre (1787-1851), . Joseph Nicephore Niepce ( 1765-1833), and Fox Talbot (1800-1871) in this new a!td definitive film. · The fascinating early history of photography is traced in sequences depicting Daguerre's development in 1838 of the first commercially feasible. process for recording photographis on polished metal plates, based on the earlier work of Niepce. The success and widespread popularity of his daguerreotypes gave photography its first world- wide impetus. Niepce, one-time partner of Daguerre, actually produced the first . permanent photographic image by his heliographic process, probably in 1822. Talbot's contribution was the invention in 1841 of a practical method for producing photographic negatives on oiled paper, the Calotype process. The work of the first great portrait photographer, David Octavius· Hill (1802-1870), utilized these paper negatives. The photographs of another important early photographer, Hippolyte Bayard, are also shown. ln 1851, Frederic Scott Archer (1813-1857) made his major contribution, the inventio.n of the wet-plate or collodion process.

All this and more will be the lot of a UC group sometime in 1978-79, if Prof. Bruce Reynolds (Economics) has his way. ''It's a good time to put in a bid for a visa,\ claims Reynolds. \Williams is sending a group in the spring; Bowdoin just got permission for a summer visit. Why should we hang back'?'!\ Well, money is one reason - about $2000 per head, in round numbers. Ttils includes all transportation and living expenses for a three-week tour of factories, schools, agricultural communes and tourist highspots in 4-5 Chinese cities. Still, as Reynolds admits, it's a bit steep. ''I'd hope that we could defray some of the expense for· some of the group,\ he says; but by-and- large this is clearly not a free ride. Although Reynolds, one of Union's three resident \China experts,\ plans to spearhead the organization of the group, it's not a \Union College\ group in any official sense. Thus the trip is potentially open, not just to students, faculty and staff, but to any member of the community - although Reynolds expresses a particular hope that \people with some language background\ might be attracted to the expedition. Reynolds himself has had the \China experience\ once before, as a member of a Yale University delegation in October 1973.

He had many interesting experiences to relate. CON CO ~D Y: What .type of .program were you in? LARRY KIRSCU: This was a 3-month program sponsored by Ohio State. The first two months were spent in Moscow at the Pushkin Institute where we had classes. The last month was a combined travel and study period. We covered three Cities; l.eningtad, Tallin, and Minsk. What was the goal · of the program? The goal of the program was to develop fluency in the Russian language, so there was a great deal of emphasis placed on oral speech. We did very little writing, the courses concentrated on the practical usages of grammar. There were actually two types of courses: practical, where we used the grammar; and lecture courses, where we were given lectures on subjects ranging from Contemporary Soviet Psychology to Literature. The courses were tough because they were all in Russian; professors talked for about 2 hours straight on a college level. How much of a Russian background did you. llave? I've been taking Russian since 7th grade, so I've had about 10 years of it altogether. I had a · good foundatio11 to start with and was able to keep my head above water. What was the attitude of the Russian professors? It became very clear to us immediately that we were there for one purpose only; they wanted our dollars. We had willing professors, but the relationship, I think, was best characterized as cordial. They seemed very pleasant but did not go out of their way for us. They held a very businesslike air about them. Do the Russian schools teach anything about the U.S.? Absolutely not. They know little about the U.S. As a matter of fact, when a person goes to Russia, he is so cut off from the west that if California had floated off into the Pacific while I was there, I would have never known. I did not know who had won the World Series until about a month later. From what I saw, the Russians know less about the West than practically any other people in the world. All they know is what .Pravda, the Russian ne~spaper~ feeds them. Did you have any trouble corresponding with people back home? This .gets into the interesting part of the whole story. My roommate, a U.S. citizen of Lithuanian descent, brought into Russia about 3 suitcases full of dissident literature. Much of it was confiscated upon his arrival, but he still managed to sneak some through. The Russian officials, therefore, had his name and knew who he was. They watched both of us and it was pretty hait:y fot about 2'Y2 weeks in Moscow. Out of our group, he and I were the only ones followed, and if l hadn't been his roommate, I wouldn't have been followed either. As far as mail goes, I did write a lot of letters to people in the U.S. Who never got them. It's interesting, because my other roommate had a friend who had a friend in the Lithuanian Secret Police, who told him that every letter that comes to the U.S. from Russia and vice-versa is xeroxed. When they have time, they read the letters also. Were yo~ told what to expect before entering Russia? · could find a bug, but there was none there. They probably build them into the wa!is. lt is also a cardinal' sin to mention the names of your Russian friends in the room. The .government could eventually pick up on the names and create s9me tmuble. As a matter of fact, I have some relatives and friends in Russia, and as soon as I told lhem l was going there, they said, \Oh please drop in, we want to see you immediately.\ I did this and they greeted me with open arms. Then, during this 2Y2 week period that I was followed, I called them and asked if I could come over and they said something like, \Well. not today, we're busy, maybe tomorrow.\ I had the same thing all during this period. Most of the Russian peo_ple I knew were afraid to be seen with me, fearing their names would be linked with mine. How did your f~iends know yo!J were being followed? Probably the word· filtered down. Students, especially undergraduates, ·ate in the .high risk category. The Russian~ don't know who we are, artd if any .type of movement would come, it would probably spring up from the students. Union Welcomes Poet We were briefed in Frankfort and the first thing they told us was that our rooms would be bugged. We were housed in a huge hotel for students and other .people who came to work in Moscow from other patts of Russia. They told us not to talk about anything of great importance in the rooms. Ot course, we unscrewed the telephone receiver to see if we I was the most annoyed during this 2!.-1 week period when I took out a girl I had met at the Moscow State UniYersity. We went to dinner at one of the better Moscow restaurants, and during the meal, I noticed the character who had 'been following me around for the last week or so. As I .kept glancing back at him, my date caught wind that there was a guy back there. She excused herself to powder her nose and took off. I qever saw her again that night: When I went to her dorm the next day and asked what had happened, she explained that she doesn't come from the Moscow a,rea, and needs a permit 'to live and study at. the University. She figured that if someone was watching me already, l was not a good person to be associated with, so she left. She was afraid for herself, which I could perfectly understand. Because of this situation,. did you find it difficult to make Russian friends? by JODY GREEN Opportunity knocks only once, or if it knocks twice you'd never be able to predict when it would knock again - and then you might not be there to answer the door anyway, and besides opportunity is not the A von lady who is so anxious for a sale that she'll stand on your front porch in a wind-chill factor of who could guess so cold while you stand inside deciding if you like the post-Christmas-pre-inventory- half-price-limited-amount-only special, so removing the metaphor and getting to the point: when opportunity arises it invites you to make a choice, you either jump at it or you let it pass you by like the rest of your life. Well an opportunity is abou.t to unveil itself, and it is giving you plenty of warning so you can't rationalize to yourself that you missed this one chance in a million because you were unaware, unprepared, or found out too late. If you've been spending your time at . Union contemplating the meaning of liberal arts and wondering how they could possibly reach you here - if you are horrified or even slightly amused by the idea that you could spend four expensive years at a small New England liberal arts college and are yet to heat or read a poem that you can understand and enjoy, heraldic trumpets are blowing! Here is the opportunity you can't afford the self-hate to miss. Poet Roland Flint will be at Union on Friday, February 10, on which day he will hold both a poetry reading and a writing workshop. The mateFial of Flint's poetry is so varied yet so know_n to any· listener that no one IS excluded from his work. Flint takes the English language - the one that we are required to know at least u_p to an intermediate level before graduation (check with the registrar's office) - and plays upon common phrases and common idioms of the language until the words take on a kind of magic and reveals miracles in our lives - yes, miracles in our lives. Now, if that explanation is too poetic try this - Flint uses words in such a way that you could read them thinking they were just words like those on a cereal box, and without you realizing it they turn into poetry and magic words, and you've liked them and even understood thern. The opportunity offered to you is to see and hear one of the finest poets of our time. Roland Flint's poems are not an acquired taste; you'll like them because they are in your language. So this is the opportunity and if you miss it, well there is always Tara and tomorrow is, after all, another day. Friday, February 10 Writing workshop: 3:30 Humanities 114 - bring copies of work or just bring yourself. Poetry reading: 8:00 Hale House Lower Lounge. Refreshments will follow. All are welcome, all is free of charge, all is presented by . Idol. · Roland Flint, poet No. Russians happen to he very curious people, completely shut off from much that goes on in the West, and they have a lot of questions. They ask you everything covering the whole range about life in America. What was the attitude of most of the Russians you talked to? One of fear. The Russians I talked to seemed to live with the idea that we had the Neutron Bomb at our fingertips and at any moment were going to drop it on them. This is easy to understand if you know anything about Russian history. The war left a great wound in the loins of Mother Russia; Leningrad lost something like 22 million men, so thefre very afraid· of subsequent wars. This fear is compounded, by whatever propaganda the government feeds them. They're living in a .genuine fear. - This article will be continued in next week's issue of Concordy.

a the a sia, I ing the ing red igh me As sa if on I be I he a of so nt by in CONCORDIENSIS, FebruQry.8,1978 · Pagel A SAGA of Epicurean Proportions? by LINDSAY TA.N .[very day at five minutes to five in the after:noon a line is seen gathering along the corridor on the first floor of West College. On line, the assembly consisting mainly of freshmen with a spr-inkling. of upperclassmen wait, some .patiently, others not, for five o'clock to atrive. The cornmon purpose they snare is wa·Jllng for the doors of West ct 1 ning haU to open and welcome them in. For some it's an ordeal, tor others, a painless ritual. To sec \~>hat is happeningon the food seem at Unio.n College, (oncordiensis met first with Mr. Liarv Jones, the Food Service Utr~c.:to r of Saga at U nion, and later with the Acting Dean of Students, Dr. Rudy Nydegger. Saga has been serving Union tor the past seventeen years. ll is a professional food service management company \Wilich first began at Hobart College in Geneva, New York and now serves over four hundred colleges and universttles. Tile present Feod Servi.:e Director is Mr. Gary Jones who has \)een in this position for a year. Previously, he held a similar position at the University of Vermont. First, Mr. Jones describ~d the situation that led to the closure of the Hale House for dinners. Then he gave his views on the food services here at Union, what his intentions art!, and how he tries to approach the problems. Hale House was opened seven years ago with the aim of providing an alternative dining facility for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Last year, the cafeteria did not serve breal-;.fast. And two weeks into the winter term of this year, Hale House was closed for dinners. The situation is quite easy t'o understand as Mr. Jones point~ out that the attendance for dinners averages forty to fifty person~ a night and at best seventy persens. These figures include freshmen who usc their meal tickets. An attendance of about one hundred fifty persons spending an average of two dollars per person is required to break even. This clearly is not the case and so over the Christmas vacation, Saga asked the Acting Dean of Students · and the Housing Di-rector that they be allowed to end services at Hale House. Dr. Nydegger says that initially Sa,ga wanted not only to close for dinners, but also for lunches. D:r. Nydegger .. opposes such an idea, citing that there are faculty and administrative staff who use Hale House for lunches, that the Rathskellar does not provide an adequate lunch menu and that the Pub cannot accom- modate an increased lunchtime .·:- :iJh7~WY.V·:._;:. ... {·;.:i;;:i4~h~Vtl· -<· -.-·. .. ···.:.;. • .'.w.;..':o~·:• ~;<(-. ,.-.• • *•~•n-;:. .. ,.-=::-:-:':->l:':-0~>M\.'~ ~• crowd. Before a decision was reached, he asked Saga to take a head count to survey the attendance over a two week period at the beginning of winter term. The results showed nonprofitability at Hale and it was mutually agreed to discontinue the dinner service. It is noted that the present yearly contract that Saga makes with Union all0ws them to change dining arrangements during the middle of the year. Asked why Hale House was not attractive to students, Mr. Jones says that he does not really know. He has tried a gourmet-type menu but that did not work. The food preparation at Hale is essentially the same as at West College. As to the students being priced out, he feels that is not so; the prices, he says, are reasonably set and not out of the reach of students. This . year, in order to boost attendance, he has even allowed freshmen to use their meal tickets at Hale:,. So far, no attempts at making Hale House successful has worked. To compensate, the dinner hours at West College are now extended to accommodate more people as well as to stagger the crowd. Coupons which were only sold at Hale House can now Students enjoying lunch at Hale be purchased at the Saga office at West. The future of Hale House is at the moment undetermined. There are no firm plans but now that Hale House is no longer used for dinners, Saga wishes to encourage students on campus to use the facilities to a greater extent. Activities such as dormitory parties and club meetings are welcome to use Hale in the evenmgs. The future of Saga Food Service itself at Union is also unknown. To discuss this matter and food service~ on the campus a:s a whole, Mr. Jones, with his district manager, Phil McKenzie, met with Dr. Nydegger and Angelo Mazzone, the manager of the Dutch Hollow Pub, on the 24th of January. In that meeting, discussion centered on the formation of a student and faculty cpmmittee on food, and also on the renegotiations and renewal of the contract Saga has with Union. Eats and·HOnky Ton~s With regard to the formation of a formal food committee, Angelo Mazzone is going to come before the Senate to make this proposal. It is felt that improvements and innovations on thtr food services here can only be implemented with the help of students and various other constituents of the campus body. The help they seek is in the form of suggestions, constructive criticisms and other types of input. Mr. Jones favors a persenal approach because food is, to him, something personal and would like to see more students go up to him to talk about the food service. by ED CLOOS III The . city of Albany is, for me, a disappointing experience. To begin with, i:t is a hideous city to drive in. On our most recent voyage, my cornpanion (a sardonic Scotsman) and I found ourselves breaking Central Avenue down into a series of challenges and obstacles. A Personal favorite of mine is the hill just inside the city limits, shortly after the highway overpass (1. 787?). This section is always good for a few tluills. Then there's the part of Central Ave. where double parking is the rage. The appearance of the city is no prize either. Central A venue is one of the sleaziest large city business districts frn familiar With. From what I've observed, most of the residential districts of Albany are in competition for the honor of being most dilapidated. At the heart of this urban mess stands the giant monument to Nelson Rockefelier. In sheer Volume of rock, the South Mall Probably exceeds all the other m?numents to public figures in ~his country put together. Nelson IS lucky to have had the taxpayers to foot the bill. Given the current Price of marble, I doubt if he Would have undertaken the Project on his own. Suppose he had? He couldn't possibly have &otten zoning approval for such a monstrosity anywllere, but for the allspices of· good <>lei Urban ---..;~. . .;., i - '._J_....,.!... Renewal. Befot):: moving to the Capital District, 1 had no idea what my father meant when he said that Rocky had an \Oedifice Complex.\ Amidst all this pessimism, my recent sortie revealed some interesting drinking places in the Capital city. My fellow traveller and I had been in search of an o.ld style pseudo railroad car diner. Albany is a fertile hunting ground for this particular type of Americana. On Broadway (near the D&H Building) we located what seemed an ideally shabby spot, the Metro Diner. Unfortunately, they close after lunch. The temperature being next to nothing, and. traffic at the peak of its afternoon escalation, we declined to get back in the car. Setting off on foot, through the side streets, we had gone only a few blocks when we came upon a most intriguing building. The sign proclaimed \Downtown Athletic Club.\ Above this was painted a winged foot emblem, with a martini glass painted on the toes. Thinking this t0 be our kind of sport, we ventured inside. The place turned out to be a classy bar, with a dining room and an upstairs facility for music · and banquets. The \Athletic\ motif was achieved in part by pictures of local sporting events of days past; of Babe Ruth, and of old newspaper pages. The ) ( . ' ) I ' •' £ 4 II dining room had a backlit niche in one wall filled with various sports paraphernalia. The sandwich menu was varied, and priced within reason. The dinner menu was rather high priced, but in keeping With the pretensions of the place. On Sunday afternoons there is live jazz, provided by local notables such as Nick Brignola. Located on Maiden Lane, one block north of State St., this place is definitely worth checking out. On our way hack,. as a reward tor having made it halfway to the city limits, we stopped at Pauleys Hotel (Central Ave., across the street from Mendels Pub). Founded in 1889, this bar's appearance has changed little since the turn of the century. Its current owner has restored it (that is, renovated it without changing anything), and see~s its inclus.ion in the National Registry of Historic Places. While sipping our drafts and munching peanuts, we engaged in conversation with an elderly gent who had been going to Pauleys \all his life.\ He assured us that the joint was largely the same except that \now they've got girls in here.\ Jazz on weeke.nds, $1 Heinekins, and a twenty foot long table game resembling. shuffle- board add to the attractions of this venerable tavern. • t ... ' '. The contract Saga has with Union is made on a yearly basis and the expiring of the present one arrives on February 28th. During the meeting, however, it was agreed that the contract be extended for another month. This extra time, Dr. Nydegger say§, would be used to re-evaluate the food service provided on this campus and then based on these findings renegotiate for a new arrangement, if it so warrants. In the mean time, Union is open to other contract bil:is from other food service companies. This· move is not unusl)al and is done every year. The Ii>ean feels that Saga has expressed interest in continuing their services and sees no reason why they would not be here next year. Until the food committee is formed and a new contract is signed, there is little in the way of modifications that can be made. At this time, there are no definite plans, but there a:re some things that Mr. Jones would like to see done. First, he would like to have, in a permanent capacity, someone who knows the food business in the administration to which Saga can turn to as a link to the school. ~ I ' I '' '. Kathy Donahee Presently, Mr. Manone is informally the liaison between Saga and the administration. He says that they have a good working rapport and describes the competition between Saga and the Dutch Hollow as healthy. Dr. Nydegger agrees to such a position and says that Mr. Mazzone would be the first person considered if such a position arose. Secondly, Mr. Jones would like to see the modernization of the existing facilities at West College. A broiler and a grill were ordered by Miss Dowling for West, with the aim of expanding the menu. These two items were returned because the wiring and ventilation systems could not handle them. Dr. Nydegger admits that the facilities at West need moderniza- tion, but nothing can be done till the evaluation of the food services are completed. Union College is not a highly profitable operation for Saga, but the comparison of Union to facilities at other colleges cannot be made as Mr. Jones puts it, it would be like comparing apples with oranges. At the University of Vermont, where he was previously, there are ten dining facilities; here he is beset with problems of another nature. There is less llexibility here, but again every school is unique_and he refuses to hazard any comparisons. For us, this is the food we are and will be getting unless we start talking, as Mr. Jones suggests. He does not claim to be a mind reader and repeatedly he emphasizes the need for students to come forward to express their feelings and ideas. So, can we conclude a Saga of epicurean proportions'? Well. perhaps not, but the answer is really up to us. -· I FINANCIAL 1 1 AID APPLICATIONS Applications for all forms of 1financial aid are now avail- : able at the Office of Student :Aid, Old Gym Hall.

Intellectual Cabaret Can standardized tests predict students' performance at college? How closely? .And how much should college admissions offices rely on them? Those questions will be discussed Thursday, Feb. 9 at Union College by two visiting professors of psychology, who will lecture on \Prediction ,of Academic and Professi.onal Achievement\· at 7:30 p.m. in the Social Sciences Building, Room 016; Professors Health and Wallach will discuss the SATs with those present in Intellectual Cabaret from 9:30 to 11 p.m. after the lecture. Tile lecture, part of tile Union College psychology department's lchabod Spencer Lecture Series, is open to tile public and free. Area high school guidance counselor!! and secondary school educators are especially in:vited. The two lecturers will be Douglas H. Heath, professor of psychology at Haverford College, and Michael A. WaUach, professor of psychology at Duke University. Heath's book, Maturity and. Competence: A Transcultural View, was published recently by Gardner Press. Wallach's works include the article '•Tests Tell Us Little About Talent\ in the 1976 January ... February issue of American Scientist, and .a chapter on \The Psychology of Talent and Graduate Education\ in the book Cognitive Styles and Creativity in Higher Education, edited by S, Messick. Heath and Wallach will discuss the ongoing controversy about the uses and merits of standardized tests. They also will talk about alternative methods for selecting students for under- graduate colleges, law, medical and other graduate schools. The lchabod Spencer Lecture Series was established at Union in the name of an 1872 graduate, and bas brought a number of noted speakers to campus.

The .problems centered around the question of who decides exactly when ah election- 'Or poll is to take place, and who counts the ballots. JoQArtn moved that Bob Morgan be removed as Chairman of the Elections .Committee. Bob Morgan then told his .side of the story. He felt that the Forum w;as interfering too much in decisions that should be handled entirely by his committee. The motion to remove Morgan was withdrawn so that a consensus of the Forum could be taken. After discussion, the motion was reintroduced. · This was defeated in a. secret ballot vote.

The depth of Springfield became immediately evident as they took the first three places in the shot put for II points and grabbed .l 0 points in the high jump. This gave Springfield an early 21 p0ints and as it turned out, gave them an insurmountf).ble lead. Though Union took first place in seven events, Springfield gained enough points in other events to keep this distance between them and the Dutchmen. finished a far second. Despite these setbacks there were man,y excellent perfor- mances by Union. Earl Chilton was first in the triple jump (45' 9\). Keviri Scheuer gained first place in the mile (4: 17 .4) and in the 1000 yard run (2:13.5). Bob Moffat produced another record, as he ran the 600 yar:d .event in I: I 1.3 seconds for first place and a new field house record. This time for Bob and Kevin's time for the 1000 yd qualifies them for the IC4A meet in Princeton later this year. / Springfield tooK 8 points in the 50 yard (first and second place) and first in the 55 yard hurdles. This is a usually strong event for Union, however, Matt Blum, their best in these events was injured this week. Springfield also took first in the lo.ng jump, 2-mile run and out vaulting, Jim Zalucki who In the 880 yd event, Coach James was very pleased with the efforts of Pete Vielkind and Dave Rowhasset who finished first and second respectively. They were also part of the winning 2-nifle relay team along with Bob Moffat and Brian Liss. Brian had another good day as he also finished third in the 2-mile run and fourth in the mile. Sophomore Tom Stegeman, replacing injured Matt Blum, leads trial heat over final hurdiP In the 440' yd tun, Matt Guifoyle finished second overall with a time of 53.7 seconds. In the same event, althoqgh they did not place, Dan Flaumenhaft and John Boffenmyer took first and second in their heat. Dan also showed his continued improvement when he was suddenly thrust ir.to the second leg of the 'mile relay tea~? joining regulars Matt Guilfoyle, Kevin Scheuer and Bob Moffat. He more than adequately filled his new responsibility as he stayed on the shoulder of the first place Springfield Funner giving stalwarts Kevin and Bob the chance to conquer a good Springfield relay team. Next week Union travels to New Hampshire for a meet against Division I teams Dartmouth and Brown. Coach James is very excited about this meet because he feels that facing Division I schools will bring out the best effort in each of the team members. The team will train hard this week for one of their biggest meets of the year and as Coach James put it earlier this year, for their adventure into the unknown. Skiers Improve Midway through another successful season, the wo~en';s baskeiblilf team; led.lfy b.fgli-- · scorers Sheila O'Donnell (l) and Jill Henry (r), returns home against Siena Feb. 11. The Union College Ski Team went west this weekend for its second intercollegiate invita- tional of the season. Colgate and Syracuse University hosted the meet with the alpine races at Mystic Mountain and the nordic events right on the S. U. campus. Fourteen schools competed in all.

This winter, however, spurred on by freshmen Tom Sargent and Fred Thimm, the Uni'On squad has been upsetting the balance of power which seems to have evolved among such Division II powerhouses as Cornell~ RPl, and West Point. This weekend left Union ahead of Army in the . slalom and giant slalom for the first time, with 115 points to the cadets' 107 points. Union's jumpers and cross-country skiers a·re improving with each , meet, padding the standings established by the downhill racers. Peter Blauvelt from Cornell took first place in the giant sla,lom with Fred Thimm pulling off a second. Eric Spalding of R.P.I. trailed into third place 1.637 seconds behind. ln the slalom Blauvelt again captured number one, and Fred Thimm was pushed back to third place by Spalding. Torn Sargent brought Union 31 points With a close fifth place. The other three members of the Union squad at Colgate; Parker Antin, Marty Chaader, and Rus Spindler all did quite well, each contributing toward the final point score. Next weekend the Union Ski Team will be racing at Greek Peak in the Cornell Invitational. If Union keeps on improving at this rate, with a little luck it might qualify for the championships at Middlebury.

Albany State, which lost to Union earlier this season in ·.1vertime, was seeking revenge. rhey had the home court Jdvantage and the game was heing regionally televised. Furthermore, tht; Albany students :1ad packed the arena to its maximum. The one thing the Great Danes forgot about was Union's persistent style of play. The contest was even from ._:e beginning to end; Albany scored, Union scored. As a result, Union found itself down by just ·one point due to sharp outside shooting by Greg Sobocinski and clutch inside hoops by Captain Mike Smith. The half ended Albany 26 - ·Union 25. When the second half started, both teams appeared ·eqt~ally prepaFed. Albany State, hoWever, jumped to an early 35-27 lead as Union could not put the ball in the hoop, and was plagued by several key turnovers. With an eight point lead and what seemed to be control of the f'reshman guard Joe Condary Fred Brucb game, Albany opened up its offense into the ''four ~orners.\ Thi§ strategy is used to pull the defense. out thus forcing the defense to foul, or enabling the offense to work the ball around until a man is found wide open underneath the basket. Fortunately, Albany could not find an open man and could not sink the free throws after being fouled. Soon, the Union Cagers had pulled even with the Great Danes thus gaining the momentum. With just minutes remaining, Albany held a four point lead. After a few costly turnovers, Union again t·ied the score. In fact with just twelve seconds remaining, Sobocinski connected on a ten-foot jumper giving Union a 51-49 lead. Albany then called time, setting up a play designed to give their leading scorer, Cavanaugh, the - ball. ·The play worked as Cavanaugh hit a twenty~foot jumper thus putting the game into overtime~ 51-51. - Overtime is nothing new to Union, as . the Dutchmen have now played four 0. T. games this season. Yet, this time the pressure seemed to bother the Dutchmen as tlley missed every field goal try they attempted. However,. the Dutchmen, led by \pressure cooker\ Steve Nearpass, con- nected on key free throws while . Albany consistently missed. Nearpass, who scored four of his eight total points in overtime. swished three out of four in the closing seconds .of the' game as Union won 57-55. Leading scorer for Union was Sobocinski with 18.

We've sent out inquiries to hockey playing schools and we expect even more applications within the next three weeks.\ All of Union's opponents next winter will be Division II foes with the exception of Colgate. The Dutchmen will play home and away series with Elmira. Plattsburgh, Potsdam, Buffalo, and Cortland. Ten of the regular season games are at home and 12 are on the road. In addition Union will play two games at home in the tournament,. although the actual opponents from the field invited have not been determined. Four teams are front the Eastern Division ll; Merrimack, Salem State, Lowell and Holy Cross. the remainder of the Division II teams are in Union's Western Division, which the Dutchmen headed in the previous two seasons. Mr. Sakala noted the schedule includes virtually all of the top Division ll hockey teams, led by defending playoff champion Merrimack. When questioned, Sakala told . Coneordiensis that he :had a difficult time putting together next year·s schedule \Pressure cooker'' guard, .:J..eve Nearpa_ss Smith had ten, Nearpass eight. * * * * Thursday, . the Dutchmen travelled to Rochester to play what was supposed to be 'the weakest team on their schedule. This fact 1 wmbined with a letdown after the Albany win played a .major role in Union's loss. A remarkable shooting performance by the U. of R. also contributed to the loss .. Rochester, whose recerd was a dismal 1-13, came out smoking, hitting 20-foot shots ,time after time. He.fore. Union could regroup, the Yellowjaekets: were in front to stay. At halftime, Rochest~r led by only three, 39:. 36, but Union was in foul trouble. With ten minutes gone in the second. half, Mike Smith fouled out. Smith scored twenty.:six points without playing the remaining ten minutes. Soon, Steve Abba followed Smith to the bench with five fouls. After Abba, Sobocinski, then N eatpass. As a result, Union's uniformity was broken. Cardney directed· the offense; scoring eighteen points, but the· defense was lacking as Rochester amassed a season high ninety points. The game ended Rochester 90 ~ Union 83. * * * * Saturday afternoon, Union played Trinity,at home in front of an embarrassing 'home crowd of approximately 500. Trinity; another supposedly weak opponent .played sloppily. But Union, who shot 30 for 71 from the floor and 6· of 14 from the free throw line, looked even worse. -Union, who looked as though they were bored playing the game, relied on Cardney and Smith to do all the scoring. Sobocinski was cold from the field and every other Dutchman appeared to he afraid to shoot. Smith tallied 24, Cardney tallied 21, but a team cannot rely on just two scorers. Trinity began overplaying these two, yielding outside shots to the -remaining Union Squad-. However, Union passed up the shots. Because of the scoring imbal· ance and Union's cold shooting performance, Trinity upset the Dutchmen 68;..66. This week is Union's most important of the season. Wednesday, nationally ranked Hamilton -plays .. at Memorial ··Fieldhouse followed by Division II power Assumption, also at the fieldhouse.

The new regulations for ••pass/fail\ grading that the All- College Senate approved at its February 9 meeting means that students will have to decide earher in the term whether they want to take courses for credit and not receive traditional grades. Faculty members - inCluding the studr;mt\s instructor - will be made aware of this decision. The Senate's ruling, which will become effective September I, was submitted by the Educational Policy Committee (EPC), chaired by Neal W. Allen, which had approved it J~puary 26. The new . regulations repla(:e all existing .. pass/fail.. legislation of the Senate. The· new regulations requite that students notify the Registrar by the end of the first week of the term that they wish to take a course on a \pass/fail\ basis. Presently, students are allowed to notify the Registrar of this decision through the third week of a te'rm. An amendment to the new regulations proposed by Senate member Michael Arato that would have c9ntinued this procedure under the new code was defeated. • Allowing students to wait until the third wec::k of the term to decide whether they w~nted to take a course 'pass/fail' wouldn't solve anything,.. said Senate member Hugh Allen Wilson. \They'd ·only exercise the 'pass/fail' option to avoid getting a bad mark.

We hope by ANDREW OELBAUM Acting Dean of Students, Rudy V. Nydegger, has renounced his candidacy for the position of Dean of Students for reasons which he said were primarily related to his future career objectives. Acting Dean Nydegger explained to Concordy that though he had thoroughly enjoyed the challenge that his position as Dean presented to him, he felt that ·many personal considerations prevented him from remaining a candidate. The etiect that Nydegger's candidacy has had on the Dean Search Committee's attitude toward the other candidate~ is indeterminate, as the committee has been operating with all its members only since last week.

In addition, the new regulations state that ••pas!l/fail\ courses. ••must be outside the department of the student's major and should normally be selected from beyond the division(s) of the student's · major.\ No such recommendation is included in the present \pass/fail\ regulations. This additional statement is consistent with the EPCs stated rationale in proposing the new legislation. That rationale noted that \the EPC found substantial evidence of widespread disregard for a principal objective of the original 'pass/fail' legislation .... The . 'pass/fail' system was intended to encourage 'curricular ven- turesomeness' among students through exploration of course offerings 'in fields distant from their majors.\' In other business, the Senate heard the report of the sub- committee of Planning and Priorities charged with \defining what is a student activity, and ther~fore what activities should be funded by the College ... After hearing the report, given by Mark Burnett, a student Herbert G. Sutter, a Senat~ member, proposed and the Seriate approved that it take no action on the report until it is presented in writing. Also on the agenda was a proposal from Student Forum that a change be instituted in the scholastic calendar moving the beginning of the academic year from the middle of the third week of September to the beginning of that week and moving the beginning of Thanksgiving vaca- tion from the Wednesday before Thanksgiving to the Friday of the week preceding the holiday. This measure was tabled until the Senate's next meeting. Although the dates for next year's Freshman Orientation have been tentatively set, Thomas N.

The vacancies tc;J be filled are the Director of Housing and the Director of Career Counseling and Placement. According to the Acting Dean of Students, Dr. Rudy Nydegger, the search for the Director of Housing is being actively pursued. At the present time, the applications for this position are being r~vie'Wed by the Housing Committee. This committee consists of four students; Madeline Berger ('79), the chairperson, Jessica Bernhardt ('80}, A-nne Bernsteifi ('80) and John Watters ('79). Included in the committee are Mrs. Thelma Borgar, who is presently sitting in for the Director of Housing, and Mr. Harry Overocker, who works at the Maintenance Department as a material expediter and represents the college staff. This committee will present a list of candidates, which they consider worthy to be interviewed for the job, to the Dean of Students. Next. the applications will be reviewed by the Head Resident Advisors and by the staff in the Student Affairs Office. They will submit any additions they may have to the first. list of candidates. Dr. Nydegger hopes that a list of candidates will be ready by next week so that appointments for interviews can be made. The applicants 'Will be interviewed by the Housing Committee, the Head Resident Advisors, staff of the Student Affairs Office and the Dean of Students. To the suggestion . that the applicants meet with the other members of the student body, Dr. Nydegger says that if there is sufficient interest a meeting could be arranged. He also says that it is probable that a new director will be appointed by the end of the winter term when the Dean of Students submits his recommendations to the Provost. The Provost, Dr. Huntley, will be the actual person hiring the Director of Housing. Commenting on the response to this position, Dr. Nydegger s~ys that the response has been light. From a member of the Housing Comm1ttee, 1t is known that there are. a total ol sixteen applicants so far. As Jor the diversity of the applicants. Dr. Nydegger says that the candidates range from college graduates looking for their first job, to high school teachers, to assistant directors of housing at .other ~olleges who are looking to this job as a promotiq,n. They come from as far as the midwest and one from Boston, but most of them are fr<1m this area. There are also three ·to four Union alumni who are applying for this position. Meanwhile over at the Placement Otlice, the position of the Director of Career Counseling and Placement will be empty on March 21st. The . two other me-mbers of the professional staff, ·Patricia Furmanski and Barbara Fatum, will take over temporarily as co-directors after this dare. So far there have been rio moves to initiate a -search process. The reason for this being that during Spring term, the -recruitment season will be practically :over and Ms. Furmanski and ·Ms. Fatum can handle. the workload. There have been, however, meetings among. -the Dean of Students, the Student Affairs staff; Ms. Furmanski and Ms. Fat11m. The topics discussed during these meetings included the criteria they will ·be using to select a new Director of .. Career Counseling and Placement and changes in the character of the job. itself.

Serious errors in cut:ricular planning, errors in the faculty's perception of the administration, and the recent outcome of what began as a weU-intentioned gift to the school, are now beginning to be felt. by GREG HAMMOND .John Byron Girdner ventured to Schenectady, N.Y. as a graduate student from Duke University twenty years ago to be Union College's · first general counselor. As the school's only general counselor, Professor Girdner counseled I SO students a year with problems that varied from vocational decisions 'to academic difficulties. To alleviate the work load Union now has four counselors for personal, academic matters, and career resources for vocational plans. As the new chairman of the Psychology Department, Pro- fessor Girdner does not expect any changes. \A good solid department,\ he says, \with the professors continuing their I research but remaining accessible to {he students, is what you can expect.•• Professor Girdner has, at one time or another, taught a majority of the psychology courses in the department and will continue to teach Psychology 62-63, \Praticum in Human Relations.'' In this course, Professor Girdner tries to illustrate methods of applying Psychology to everyday living and practical affairs. The course has practical flair combined with experiences and : ideas. ln question\ng the educational system, Professor Girdner feels that the graduate level is ill- defined for the students and the professors, while the elemeitta!Y Girdner heads Psychology Department school level, which teaches the students to master symbols and the world about them, is more p11rposeful in its objectives. Professor Girdner also feels that tltere is no difference between the students of the sixties and today.

With his last baseball bat resting firmly in the corner of his office, one look at the man and one brief conversation with him quickly confirms that he is a \true jock intellectual.\ This makes the second-year Union professor a ftdl-fledged member of what has become more and more of a rare breed. The second research topic deals with human infonnation processing as it relates to differential cerebral engagement. Simply stated, this is observing what the differences are between the two cerebral hemispheres in terms of their differential processing information capabilities. The goal is to ultimately identify the electro- cortical events associated with this processing. A research paradigm is now in the process of being developed.

Prof. Bashore, former minor-leaguer. In the case .of Dr. Bashore, his intellectual aspect is now totally in the foreground, although he 'is often seen working out in the gym. Bashore attained his B.A. in Psychology from UCLA in 1969 and later attended the University of Colorado at Boulder Where he earned his M.A. in 1973 and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology (with a minor in Biological Psychology) in 1976. During this time, he spent one year working in a Pepilsylvania hospital. The idea for this topic, which ::tlso deals with studying the differences. between left,..handed. and right-ha11ded individuals, came about from wondering how individuals come to find out about our world in the most global sense and the importance of the brain in the matter.

In an agreement made with the Burroughs Corporation, the college will receive the B-6800, a new and more powerful machine which will greatly revitalize lJ nion's computer science curriculum. The new computer will have many technical and physical advantages over its predecessor, the B-5700. The main frame ·of the computer, including a state of the art central processor, will possess a much greater memory capacity, as well as a significantly increased speed of operation. Programmers will no longer be hardware limited, as had become the case with the old machine, nor will they have to contend with the relatively inefficient and time consuming software o( the 5700. The 6800- emplo~s • integrated. circuits as opposed to transistors, th~refore, it w.ill consume a great deal less energy and thus be less expensive to operate. The 6800 has an operating system which can support time- . ...., - sharing, batch processing and remote batch, and will use the programming languages COBOL, ALGOL, and FORTRAN. The emphasis will be on time sharing, or interactive programming, which allows the user to correct mistakes in a program immediately. Teletypewriters will be used, at remote Say roodb;yt to an old friend. locations such as the library. Batch .processing, which involves a considerable time delay between submitting a program and receiving an output, will gradually be phased out. The new machine improves Union's position in attracting high caliber faculty, since it puts the college in competition with many larger universities possessing sophisticated computing facilities. The computer will serve as a valuable aid to faculty and student research projects. In addition, computer science majors will benefit not only because the 6800 is a definite improvement from the status quo, but it places them in a potentially better employment situation when they graduate, since the new system is much closer to what is actually used commercially than is the outmoded 5700. The administration will also benefit from the efficiency of the new computer. Since its operation will be less time-consuming for the professional staff ot - the• computer center, it will free them for such administrative-related· tasks as compiling budgetary data and doing financial planning. There have not yet been any provisions roade for .the time allotment that students and faculty will have on the terminals. lt. is hoped that the continued practice of staggering assignments can eliminate any potential log jam on the terminals, but this may be wishful thinking considering the number of users. li appears that some type of system will have to be instituted. The computer is scheduled to be installed sometime in August, and will hopefully be completely Q!perational for the beginning of fall term classes next September. ' • • ' ..... ~ • '-. '. 'W Committees. It was argYed not only ~hat he should not be on · both committees, but that, in • President Ganz's words, ••he should not have given the green light before the Forum approved.\ Finally a motion was made to the. etiect that Lubart should not be on the Search Committee, and that one of the remaining three finalists who is .not on another committee or on the · Student Forum should . be chosen. This motion carried. Following this, it was mentioned that Lisa Katz was the only one of the 4 candidates who met these requirements and she. was, therefore, approved by the Forum. . The next matter of business concerned the Educational Policy Committee. At the beginning of the meeting the EPC : proposal with regard to the ~new + /- grading system was distributed among the Forum members. Since the EPC approved the new grade-point average computation, it will shortly go before the All College Senate for further action. Several topics on the matter were discussed but no resolutions were made. President Ganz then brought forth the reappointment of Jay Shupe as Admissions Director. He proposed that the Forum pass a motion condemning Provost C. William Huntley's decision to retain Shupe. In addition Ganz also placed blame on Union College President Thomas Bonner for avoiding and neglecting the Presidential Advisory Board. During the discussion that followed it was mentioned that in September President Bonner delayed any action on the Shupe c_ase, and by Feoruary decided that it would not be in the best interests of the college to cause another administrative loss. The Forum passed a res<>llltion on this subject proposed by President Ganz. Murry Levison, commenting on the violence at the Union-Colgate hockey game, motioned that a proposition be sent to President Bonner concerning this matter. The \friendly message\ proclaimed that the President, in order to insure the safety of the college community~ should warn non-members to fully accept and ret1ect in their behavior on campus 1 the college's decisions. As a last order of business, President Ganz asked if there was any new business, therefore sparking a discussion on the progress of the student body's purchase of Carnegie HalL Joe Zolner, Director of Student Development, replied that although all the facts were not in as yet, at this point the idea I~oked unfeasible due to excessive cost factors. Also a proposal that all committee loans of capital goods over ten dollars should appear in <Joncordiensis, was passed.

Hellenic News by RlCH DELANEY and ALAN HERTZBERG We will begin this article with an indictmentofthe Union College student body. We accuse ·the students of an unwarranted· apathy towards the winter varsity sports programs. In simple language, very few students have been showing up at varsity contests. Last Wednesday, the Union basketball team hosted. Hamilton College. Hamilton is rated in the top 5 in NCAA Division Hl, which is a quite impressive spot to be in. Union could have used a home court advantage while playing such a team. A home court advantage, to those unfamiliar with the term, is the :emotional edge that the home · team usually receives when the stands are filled almost entirely with fans partisan to that hom~ ·team. An example that may hit closer to home was the Achille~ Rink crowds of one or two Years ago. When the home team scored a goa.J, the roar of the crowd was deafen.ing, but when the opposition scored, one could almost hea-t a pin drop. In this situation, Union's team clearoly had an emotional edge~ During the Hamilton bas~etball game, we saw Union play an exciting game and t,hev were just edged out The team did not give up and seemed to be just on the brink of staging an upset victory. We believe a crowded Memorial Fieldhouse may have helped the t~rn to do just that.

The various events promot.ed compeHtion between the dorms and fraternities. Each activity was worth a .set nUmber of points . Richmond. with a total of 24 points holds first place while Sigma Chi and Webster House tied for second place with 21 points each. Winter Carnival commenced on Friday in Achilles Rink with a tug- of-war. D. Phi came in first, followed by Phi Sigma Kappa, followed by D.U. The results of the obstacle course were D. Chi in first, A.D. Phi 'in second and Davidson in third. During the obstacle course, the teams were not only judged on the speed of .their skater, but also on their cheering sectian. Ri<;hn;10nd took first place, Sigma Chi second and T.D. Chi came in third. Cu!'iing. held in the Cur.Jing Rink resulted with Richmond in first place, D.U. in second and West College in third place. The last athletic event held on Friday was the faculty-student broomball game. The Union College faculty topped the students in a 3-1 game. On Friday night, many students relaxed· at the special Winter Carnival wine and cheese coffeehouse. listening to the music of Trilogy. The snow sculptures were judged on Saturday. Webster Houses' lJ.S.S. Enterprise won 21 points~ Sigma Chi's \Union Dilemma'\ (Rodin's Thinker on top of Achilles Rink) won I 7 points; Richmond's Bathing Beauty won 14 points.

Al'ong the way she learned a simple but revolUtionary approach: ••to fill a space in a beautiful way.\ Ever since, in both her art and her life, O'Keefe has been filling spaces in beautiful· ways... On canvas, she has distilled her vision of nature: an expanding universe in the heart of a flower, the closeness of a lost horiZl'>fi, the rhythms of life in a sun-dried bone. As a woman, she has projected an image of courage and quiet passion. This is the first and only film that O'Keefe has ever allowed to be made of her life and work. The devastating portraits of Alice Neel as · portrayed in Collector .of Souls seems in direct contrast to Neel's benign social presence. This film celebrates the art and personality of 76-year-old Alice Neel. It points up to the unsentimental, forceful nature of her style .... The directness of her vision and relationships with other people is clearly documented. The film shows her in the process of painting a ·portrait, recalling her early years candidly, revelling in her recent national recognition. The film carries many message!;, not the least of which is the inadequacy of society consistently to nurture the gifted, unconventional individual.

He said that he found the Dean of Students to be a complex and difficult job that requires many skills of a person, including: an . expertise in financial matters, strong administrative ability, and the ability to relate comfortably with students. The responsibility· of eliminating the large 1,mmber of candidates and developing a list of finalists lies with the Search Committee. The commi~tee only began to actively evaluate the candidates last week, as its two final members were not appointed until that time; hence the effect the Acting Dean's candidacy would have had on the tnernbers of the committee as well as their opinion of the other candidates will never be known. The last two members to be appointed to the committee were two students: Tim Dowling and Usa Katz rt. According to the Cha1rman of the ·Search Committee, Professor Aubry, the two ha:ve worked incredibly hard thus far since their appointment to the committee. Professor Aubry also reiterated the committee's goal to ha've a new Dean of Students by this coming June. He also stressed the fact, however, that though the committee selects the finalists for the job, only the President and the P.A.B. make the final decisio!J.. Professor Aubry expressed his hopes that the committee's selective process will be low key, but that its final candidates would be visible to the student body so that the students would be ·able to voice their optmons on the prospective Deans. The student body's inp.ut, Professor Aubry added, is vital to the process of selecting a man who could be a successful Dean of Students. - by 1' rh~ Unio1 know Curn .Galle sched Schel minu I he galle1 phot• fh was Ros Oep< was, art <l studc teacl art f told rele\ origi Libr bee< insu a Ilia Schc year T acti· Gen gaU for rece ope gi'aJ of ' rhi wit!

Ihe shows presented in the gallery have run the gamut from !N AfH ANP ~:~ lV I Ul A·~ h)N Walter and Naomi Rosenblum Collection. Mark Felnber& photography to sculpture. The Union College Art Gallery was started in 1974 by Nina Rosenblum of the Arts Department. Her basic premise was. '\lf you're going to have .an art department, you have to have students look at art.\ In order to teach the, history of art and the art forms themsel:ves, people need to look at art and hear lectures on relevant topics. The gallery was originally located in the Schaffer Library in the music section, but because 'of poor lighting, insurance needs, and security, an alliance was made with the Schenectady Museum after two years. The gallery has had a very active history in its past ,few years. Generally, the directors of the gallery like to have a big opening for each show witn lectures and a reception. One of the · largest openings was for the ·photo- graphy from the collection of Walter and Naomi Rosenblum. rhis show was in conjunction with the Walter C. Baker Lecture. Another very successful exhibit was a collection of protest posters. The Lewis · H ine collection of social documentary photography was also a high point in the gallery's history.

If it is to house a permanent collection, then these things would become necessary. The proposal to rehabilitate the Nott Memorial had included provisions for an art gallery. Another idea that was proposed was to use the third floor of Carnegie Hall. However, Carnegie is not the most .pleasing place to have an art gallery. Also, in order to qualify for possible grants funding, a gallery must provide access for the handicapped. So far, the Union Gallery at the Schenectady Museum has been very successful. It is one of the many ties that Union has with the Museum. It is possible that if the location- of the gallery were changed back to a campus ·site that the community might not see it as much. But the general feeling is that adequate publicity would take care of this. Up until now, the gallery has been ha~ing four to six shows a year. If it was located on campus, there would almost definitely be more student involvement, and therefore more shows. It would be much easier. to expand the programs. Because of the advantages of having the gallery on campus (and aiso a desire to expand the entire arts complex), Virginia Bush, the Chairman of the Arts Department here, ·bas put in a $7500 budget request for an architectural survey. The gallery is currently funded from the President's Contingency Fund. At the beginning of this year, $4800 was appropriated out of this fund specifically for the gallery. The directors of the gallery have a free hand in spending this money on the gallery in the best way they see lit. At the end of the year, they submit a report to the president. Generally, each show runs about $.1000. Seven hundred dollars of this goes to the Schenectady Museum for heating, lighting, and security expenses; the rest ,.;,.-\ ~, :::;~: . .-:~. for transportation of art work. brochures and publicity. Ruth Hall is employed as a part time assistant 't<:> work at the museum. She serves both as a curator and a per~on who can do a lot of the \foot-work.\ As is standard for most shows, the artist exhibiting · receives no fee. lt is evident that the gallery is quite active even with only minimal staffing and funds. The Union College community should realize that the Union Art Gallery is for them, and that they should take advantage of it. Mrs. Bush hopes that in the future, the scope of the gallery will expand to include art forms in all of their realizations drawings by engineers, by biologists, by medical illustrators, etc. It is important for people to realize the relevance of the visual arts to . all areas ... A school like this tends to separate the visual from the other areas.\ Arts are not a separate part of people's lives.

PageS Editorials Portidpotion Six of twelve times during almost everyone's stay at Union College, they find certain campus situations particularly disturbing. As is the case with most \bones of contention\ -at Union, the subject matter of this editorial is a perennial aU-star whose incipiency is in late September and full bloom period during Union's long ten•week winter time. Because this situation is so annoying it is imperative that it be aired again and again until a solution is reached. Following the sudden resignation of the former Union College Varsity Hockey Team, .many students and faculty felt bad for the players as individuals. Other students and faculty voiced a view that if the former players felt n<l other connection to Union College than playing hockey for Ned Harkness, then their presence on campus was niether needed or wanted. With most of Union's former hockey players. now either at other schools or in professional farm systems it has been s1,1ggested they did not feel like part of the school except when it came to playing hockey, not for a particular school, but for a specific individual. But the purnose of this opinion is not. t~ question the ideals and values of our former hockey players. Th1s ts a genuine concern for what appears to be a school inhabited by a large group of people who say one thing and do another. For it is a lot of the same people who criticized the former hockey players for their apparent lack of scb.ool spirit. who are now \crowding\ into the fieldhouse and hockey rink for basketball and hockey games in \epidemic\ proportions. Saturday afternoon, which has typically been a pretty boring time at Union and th11s been delegated to a day of study, saw the college .hockey team take on a Division ll opponent in the person of the University of Maine. The head count taken in the stands, which was performed by the same 9•year old boy who counted at last Friday and last Wednesday nights' basketball games and the Saturday hockey game against Colgate, was approximately the equivalent of 103 Union College students, faculty and other personnel. Allowing for p<lssible error in the tabulation process, the attendance (it would be a misnomer to call it a crowd) was very embarrassing and more important, it was sad. Sad because only 5% of the Union College campus felt strong enough ties to the school to be able to set aside a couple of hours of their ••precious\ time to support fellow students wearing the school colors. · The prevalent retort to charges of apathy in the case of school sporting events is that it's only worthwhile to watch when the outcome will be a Union victory. Is that the only reason students, faculty and other college personnel flocked to see the former hockey team, and continue to abstain from supporting the present hockey team and basketball team? For those not in attendance (and as was alluded to before, it was much easier to count those who were in attendance), U11ion's (your) basketball team faced two of its toughest opponents of the season this past week in a span of three days. While Union lost to Division Ill's second nationally ranked team Hamilton, and saw a half-time lead against Division II pow~rhouse, Assumption, result in a tough loss - a little more support (maybe 400 or 5()0 additional spectators) could only have aided the team's efforts. Is Union filled with people so narrow-minded that they will participate only in activities which guarantee individual material rewards .such as getting into the professional school of one's choice, obtaining a specific job, or being granted tenure? CONCORDIENSIS would like to think not. If this accurately paints the picture of the typical Union College personage then it is time for a major overhaul of admission and hiring of personnel ~~~- . If this opinion has been a waste of breath and contmues to surface each year but fails to inspire an ethical and equita~le solution, CONCORDJENSIS feels sorry for the future of Umon College. Most certainly, we are all here to make something of ourselves but there is no reason that we can't take an active interest in what ;thers do (especially when they represent our school), while we do it.

Commentary: Apparent Discrepancies The recent announcement of the extension of Admission Director Schupe's contract has served to once again bring to the forefront many of the administrative pr~bleJUS that still face the c~llege. Th~re is nc;> question that Ja,y Schupe is, ind~e<i, a competent admtf!lStrator .-: a rare com~odtty at _Uruon College today. There is also no question of th~ nature of t~e ll!lP~opnetles .. h~ commttted as Dtrector of Admissions in the past. Union does need cotnpet~nt, 1ndustr1ous a~~mstrators ~ but at what cost? Must Union sacrifice its rnoral staJtdards to retam comp~tent a~muustrators? .A.re the st~ndards . 0 f integrity and honesty expected of students and f~culty 1napphcable to ~dmpustrators. Many readily recognize that Jay Schupe has suffered profess1onal~y - perhaps ~ar m exc~ss of what was merited, but what .is .often overlooked is the degree to whtch the repu_tatlon of Umon College has suffered. In this respect, the Schupe decision represents a serious moral dllen;m8;· . . . However, what should be of far greater concern to the campus commumty ~s th~ ~ppant attttu~e displayed by the President to the ~stablished ~ove~nance ~tructure, not onl~ m thts mstance but m general. Dr. Bonner has not met wtth the ~restdentlal Advtsory Board y~t tl.11s term. The only repoyt made to the Advisory Board by the Pres1dent was a memorandu~ dat~d Feb!uary 9, 1978 ·-:- stx weeks subsequent to the beginning of the term. The PAB was told m thetr me:tmg of September 29, 1977 that ••the investigations of last spring have been accepted and acted upon. T~e Bo~rd was neyer informed that there existed the option of extending Schupe's· contract and that .thts opt10n wa$ bemg investigated by either the President or the Provost. The announcement. concernmg Schupe's contract, as reported in the Concordiensis of February 8, 1978, was . the fust ki).owledge t~e P AB had concerning this iss\le. Prior to this date, the Board was; working ~nder. the assump~1on that Dr, Bonner had enacted all recommendations of the Allen report ~ mcludmg t~e termmal one year contract for the Director of Admissions. Perhaps this was an impror~r assumpt~on on the .part of the PAB - or perhaps the president's temar}Cs had l~nt themselves to ~mn~erpreta~10n. One must recognize that botp the .Allen commtttee .and the Pre~1dent~al Ad':ts~ry ~oard poss~ss .no power other than to advise and recommend. Clearly, Dr .. Bonne_r ~s entt~ely w1thm h1s. prerogatwe as President to extend or revoke the contract .of any of <hts adm1mstrators. However, m any type ~f representative government, t~e .leader has certain_ moral obligations to th~se . he serve~. In th~s instance, the President was rejectmg a recommendation endorsed by two commtttees. comp~ased of ~1s constituents. He had a moral obligation to inform the PAa~ (the. AUen ~om~ttee smce .bemg disbanded) in confidence of his action and the reasons he !elt thi~ ~ctlon was JUstified. ~e~lecung to do this has placed the .HAB in an awkward and embarrassmg pos1Uon. It also serves to mdtcate once again the .disrespectful manner in which Dr. Bonnet bas come to treat both the students and faculty of Union College. . . , Now, the college community may ~est a~sur~d that Dr. Bo!lner has ''a~c~pted and ~ct~d ;up~n all recommendations resulting from the mvestlgattons of last spnng. The rehin~g of Adm1ss1on ~rrec~or Schupe marks the final scene in this lengthy tragedy of a small college m ~earch of an tdeift~ty. Presumably now U~on can forget. t~e pa~t and lo~k to~ard _the future.

'eClSlOn Editors, Coneotdiensts; The decision by Provost C. William Huntley to extend the contract of Director · of Admissions Jay Shupe does not merely raise questions concerning the retention of an administrator who demon- strated blatantly unprofes- sional ethics. With his rehiring, the entire matter of Admissions violations {and with it, usurpation of the governance system) has been neatly swept under the rug. Out of this affair came no disclosure of all . responsible parties; nor mechanisms for the prevention of such events in the f'uturc:-. · One aspect· of . the Sh.upe affair not fully explic;ated by the Allen Cotnndttee report is. what were the . p.ossible motives of the Director of Admissions• in falsifying Admissions Committee documents in order t(} gain entrance for certain student athl~tes.

The results were discussed at a recent Student Forum meet1 ng and although they were seen as sufficient cause to call for a change in the grading system, no particular system seemed to be a clear· choice. At the Feb. 10 meeting of the Equcational Policy Committee, the following proposal was made: That the grading system be ch?nged to include pluses and minuses for all grades except 'D' and •f.

PASS-FAD~ On Jan. 26, the Educational Policy Committee approved the following new regulations to be considered for legislative action by the College Senate at its next regular meeting. I. .These regulations replace all previous \pass/ fail\ legislation by the Faculty Council and College Senate. 2. In order to explore areas of the curriculum substantailly distant from previous or current course experience. a stl!dent may take two courses in each academic year to be graded on a \pass/fail\ basis. The course must be outside the dep~rtment(s) of the student's major and should normally be selected from beyond the division(s) of the student's major. 3. A student who desires to take a course on these conditions must notify the Registrar before the end of the first week of the term, on a form provided for that purpose. Consent of the instructor is required. 4. Courses taken on a \pass/fail\ basis may not be used to meet Liberal Learning or major requirements. Instructors will submit letter grades, and the Registrar will transfer the grade of a student taking a course .. pass/fail\ to either pass (P) or fail (F). Neither grade will affect the term or cumulative academic indices. Should a student change to a new major field, grades in courses previously taken in that field on a \pass/ fail\ basis will be changed to a letter grade. Only under this set of circumstances may a pass· grade be translated back into a letter grade. Grades thus changed may not revert back to \pass/fail\ no matter what future changes in major may be made. 5. This legislation will become effective as of September I, 197!L

East Asia at Union College Chinese Student Alliance Promotes ' . Cultural Exchange and lfnderstanding by STEVE YUEN '19 Chinese students were not cetnmonly seen at Union until several years ago. When my fathet studied here in 1940, there was not another Chinese around. In 1971 my brother came to this campus as a freshman. He was one of only two Chinese students at that time. As time went by, there were more and more Chinese pursuing their college careers at Union. But it was not until the fall ef 1976 that some enthusiastic Chinese students organize<I a Chinese Student Association (CSA) .. One o•bjective ohhe CSA is to organize social gatherings fm: the Chinese and interested members of the Union communitv. An ot h e r. · o b j e c t i v e · is to produce a deeper understanding of ethnic East • ~· . Op . • u· . ~•an · · · .. portunities at · ·moo differences and to encourage cultural exchange between the Chinese students and the rest of the college community. An example of these two objectives was the Chinese New Year Party, organized on Jan. 28 by the CSA, with help from a lot of Chinese language students, some facldty members, and some .people from outside the campus. An art display, a calligraphy exhibit and some slide shows on Peasant Painting ~nd Mainland China Today were shown to introdl.lce some of our 4000-year old culture. As entertainment, Chinese chess, a Tai-chi demonstration, and Chinese songs and instrumental music were presented. We also had the Chinese dinner, a cooking. demonstration, and a Bruce Lee · movie. . in a \Multiplicity of Ways\ by BRUCE L. REYJSOLDS the five students in my first-year Chines-e class were undergraduates. Here at Union, we sometirnes get freshmen who have studied a respectable amount of Chinese or Japanese in ·high school;. and are ready to take · oti for the Orient for a summer of · upper-level study. There's one clear parallel between Union and Yale. Introductory Chinese there was my tirst taste .of the Far East. I discovered a strong SP,irit of camaraderie .among those involved in the program, whiCh in the end drew me further inte the study of Asia. I now feel that this is typical of Asian Studies everywhere - perhaps because the culture is so different from our own. or because any intensive language program requires a relatively high level of commitment. Certainly, 1 see the same thing among those at Union involved with East Asia- especially the students: interest, involvement and esprit de corps. One could print in mechanical fashion the curricular and other aspects of East Asia at Union: courses as diverse as Chinese literature or Japanese politics. But instead, let me allow a few participants to speak for themselves. Due to our limited budget (we have been denied any funds by the Tax Committee for next year), our activities are very much. confined. We would have liked to pursue our two objectives by doing something as .. big'' as the Cornell CSA's event this Fall. That organization invited 20 universities/ colleges in New York State to a Chinese Weekend. Lectures and entertainment were Contrary to popular . beli.;:f, East Asia is not 8000 miles away. It's here at Union, in a multiplicity of ways. The community should be more aware of that fact and should draw more · heavily than at present on the Asia-related resources available to us. To that end, we've pulled together today all the varied aspects of East Asia at Union, on two Concordy pages. Rather than offering a systematic but dry introduction to the following stories, I'd lik.e to strike a personal nole, by comparing East Asian studies here with my own ell peri en c,e as a Y a I e undergraduate, twelve years ago. First, some differences. There was at Yale a formal, degree- granting program in East Asian Studies, into which I gravitated in my junior year. At Union, students interested in Japan or China remain traditional departmental majors - Modem languages, Political Science or whatever; or they may major in Comparative Communist Studies with a China concentration. In addition, at least one student, Peter Hooper, has designed his own East Asia program, as a thematic major. Experience in Taiwan~a Fascinating, Friendly Piece of China . Another difference between today's Union and the Yale of the mid-1960's is the enormous variety of extra-curricular activities here which bring East Asia onto the campus. Union's two dozen Chinese students, organized into the Chinese Student Association, generate a variety of events during the year. Film and lecture series also seem more frequent here than at Yale in my day. And foreign travel is so much more commonplace now. I can't remember a single Yalie spending a year in Japan as an undergraduate (as Scott Eaton here has done); And the notion of the whole set of Chinese-language students in effect decamping for a summer on Taiwan would have· been unheard of (to say nothing of a group visit to the .. real\ China). Of course, this has also changed at Yale and elsewhere by now. For one thing, air travel has become significantly less arduous (and costly)~ For another, students seem to be coming into foreign language study at an earlier age nowadays. Only two of by SARAH LEE MCCLINTOCK Mornings in Taipei announce themselves at 6 AM with musical zeal by a merciless onslaught of garbage trucks with bells, street venders singing the virtues of cabbage and carpenters tinkering away at the nearest apartment complex under construction. On this particular morning, 1 had determined to hibernate in my bamboo mat bed (with tablecloth sheets) for at least another hour, or until my landlady, Madame Chang, rose te pray and the scent of incense filled the fourth floor flat we shared. But it was not to be. In the distance, somewhere! from the area where Chin Hua Street meets Dung Bing Road, a vender began his approach. Softly at first, the tune played by the chimes on the wagon he had drawn into Taipei from his fields early that morning began to sound familiar.

Page 10·.·. CONCORDlENS..JS,·. Febr.uiJry J.5, · J.978., East Asia at Union College Chinese Student Alliance Promotes Cultural Exchange and Understanding by STEVE YUEN '79 Chinese students were not commonly seen at Union until several years ago. When my lather studied here in 1940, there was not another Chinese arouad. In 1971 my brother came to this campus as a freshman. He was one ol only two Chinese students at that time. As time went by, there were more and more Chinese pursuing their college careers at Union. But it was not until the fall ol 1976 that some enthusiastic Chinese students organized a Chinese Student Association (CSA). East Asian Opportunitiffi at Union in a \Multiplicity of Ways\ by BRUCE L. REYNOLDS the five students in my first-year Chinese class were undergraduates. Here at Union, we sometimes get freshmen who have studied a Fespectable amount of Chinese or Japanese in high school, and are ready to take off for the Orient for a summer of · upper-level study. There's one clear parallel between Union and Yale. Introductory Chinese theve was my tirst taste of the Far East. I discovered a strong spirit of camaraderie among those involved in the program, which in the end drew me further into the study of Asia. I now feel that this is typical of Asian Studies everywhere - perhaps because the culture is so different from our own, or because any intensive language program requires a relatively high level of commitment. Certainly, I see the same thing among those at Union involved with East Asia- especially the students: interest, involvement and esprit de corps. One could print in mechanical fashion the curricular and other aspects of East Asia at Union: courses as diverse as Chinese literature or Japanese politics. But instead, let me allow a few participants to speak for themselves. One objective ol the CSA is to organize social gatherings for the Chinese and interested members ot the Union communitv Another objective is to produce a deeper understanding of ethnic differences and to encourage cu1tural exchange between the Chinese students and the rest of the coHege community. An example of these two objectives was the Chinese New Year Party, organized on Jan. 28 by the CSA, with help from a lot of Chinese language students, some faculty members, and some people from outside the campus. An art display, a caUigraphy exhrbit and some slide shows on Peasant Painting and Mainland China Today were shown to introduce some of our 4000-year old culture. As entertainment, Chinese chess, a Tai-chi demonstration, and Chinese songs and instrumental music were presented. We also had the Chinese dinner, a cooking demonstration, and a Bruce Lee movie. Due to our limited budget (we have been denied any funds by the Tax Committee for next year), our activities are very much confined. We would have liked to pursue our two objectives by doing something as \big\ as the Cornell CSA's event this Fall. That organization invited 20 universities/ colleges in New York State to a Chinese Weekend. Lectures and entertainment were Contrary to popular belief, East Asia is not 8000 miles away. It's here at Union, in a multiplicity of ways. The community should be more aware of that fact and should draw more heavily than at present on the Asia-related resources available to us. To that end, we've pulled together today all the varied aspects of East Asia at Union, on two Concordy pages. Rather than offering a systematic but dry introduction to the following stories, I'd like to strike a personal note, by comparing East Asian studies here with my own experience as a Yale undergraduate, twelve years ago. First, some differences. There was at 'I ale a formal, degree- granting program in East Asian Studies, into which I gravitated in my junior year. At Union, students interested in Japan or China remain traditional departmental majors - Modern Languages, Political Science or whatever; or they may major in Comparative Communist Studies with a China concentration. In addition, at least one student, Peter Hooper, has designed his own East Asia program, as a thematic major. Experience in Taiwan-a Fascinating, Friendly Piece of China Another difference between today's Union and the Yale of the mid-1960's is the enormous variety of extra-curricular activities here which bring East Asia onto the campus. Union's two dozen Chinese students, organized into the Chinese Student Association, generate a variety of events during the year. Film and lecture series also seem more frequent here than at Yale in my day. And foreign travel is so much more commonplace now. l can't remember a single Yalie spending a year in Japan as an undergraduate (as Scott Eaton here has done). And the notion of the whole set of Chinese-language students in effect decamping for a summer on Taiwan would have been unheard ol (to say nothing of a group visit to the \real\ L'hina). Of course, this has also changed at Yale and elsewhere by now. for one thing, air travel has become ~Ignilicantly less arduous (and costly). For another, students seem to be coming into foreign language study at an earlier age nowadays. Only two of by SARAH LEE MCCLINTOCK Mornings in Taipei announce themselves at 6 AM with musical zeal by a merciless onslaught of garbage trucks with bells, street venders singing the virtues of cabbage and carpenters tinkering away at the nearest apartment complex under construction. On this particular morning, I had determined to hibernate in my bamboo mat bed (with tableclotl:l sheets) for at least another hour. or until my landlady, Madame Chang, rose to pray and the scent of incense filled the fourth floor flat we shared. But it was not to be. In the distance, somewhere· from the area where Chin Hua Street meets Dung Bing Road, a vender began his approach. Softly at first, the tune played by the chimes on the wagon he had drawn into Taipei from his fields early that morning began to sound familiar. As he drew closer, it was unmistakable, '\Oh give Me a Home Where the Buffalo Roam\ floated up from the alley; and I wondered if he knew it was originally an American song, or whether, perhaps, we knew the origin of our own version.

Our conversation quicly centered on music, as she was carrying a flute, and the dilemma of the Chinese Music student. She suggested that the Chinese are culturally at an impasse, an observation that gained support throughout my stay. Mastery of the ancient Chinese instruments, revered by Confucius, is no longer respected as worthwhile, and is being replaced by the Western piano and violin. As the Taiwanese become more familiar with our Western affinity for harmonious music, the Peking Opera (which sounds to the untrained American ear like a cat riding a roller coaster, accompanied by a two-string violin novice and three Suma Wrestlers on cymbals) is losing popularity. Opera in Taiwan is now predominantly attended by a dying breed of Pekinese upper class officials who migrated to Taiwan during the Mainland Revolution between 1947 to 1949, and the future of traditional Chinese Music is uncertain.

The first problem that we· encountered, and the most obvious, was in trying to convince the Chinese that what we were speaking was indeed Chinese and not some otber language. Since we could not overcome this slight inconvenience <}Uickly, we became quite adept at sign language. It wasn't long, though, before we could participate in dai'ly conversations. Out nex:t challenge was transportation. Assuming we could re.ad the names on the buses, and know which ones to use and where to get Mf, the only problem we ran into was getting on a bus heading in the wrong direction. This, however, gave us further opportunities to,meet the Chinese as they attempted to help us find olir way home. If worst came to worst, there were also inexpensive (the cheapest in the world) taxis available to take us home, assuming, of course, that we remembered our addre.sses. We studied Chinese in the University of Pennsylvania's Intensive Summer Language We fell in love with Chinese food at our first meat The fresh fruits were amazing: pineapples, watermelon, lichi nuts, mangos, papayas - anything the fruit lover could desire. The vegetables were equally abundant and enjoyable. There was always rice or noodles, besides various meat and vegetable dishes. The meal was usually followed by soup and fresh fr11it. Needless ·to say, we always ate (or tried to eat) with chopsticks. Some of us got an even .closer view of Chinese life by attending a wedding feast. We got to try such diverse things as jellyfish (crunchy!), turtle soup, and things the name~ of which we never did learn. Nonetheless, we enjoyed them all immensely. When the program was over, we each packed a bag and traveled around Taiwan for a few weeks. The scenery - lush,, mountainous countryside, full of rice paddies, waterfalls, and tropical flowers -was among the most beautiful we had ever seen. The mass-transportation system throughout Taiw~n is excellent and inexpensive, so there was never too ·much of a problem, getting where we wanted to go. Since we traveled toward the end of our stay there, we all had to be a little careful of our money sit\lations. This led us to stay in some truly unforgettable places: a Buddhist monastery located on top of a 'mountain; a mission, again on a mountain, .run by an old Swiss monk, where we stayed in the ··communist Room\ (one big bed for ten people); and an old American Air force radar base in the middle of nowhere. We wouldn't hesitate to go back to any of them. Total expenses while traveling, including hotels, food. to get places, what to see, and where we could stay. More than once they even insisted on taking us out to eat. There were many things that made our stay in Taiwan outstanding.

All in.all, it was a truly unforgettable summer. Chinese Language Courses. Provide an Interesting Alternative Mandarin (the dialect typically called \Chinese\).

No buses could get through, so those of us who were staying at our mountain \'resorts\ at the time were able to enjoy the scenery for a day or two longer. The time of the year also happened to be typhoon season, which, needless to say, could slow up transportation ; a bit. The people we met while traveling were as nice and as helpful as those in Taipei. They were always willing to tell us how \Chop Suey\ ... \Made in Hong Kong\ ... \Don't they speak Chinese in Japan?\ Beiore studying Chinese here at Union, this was about the extent oi our knowledge (or \mis- knowledge\) ot the Chinese language. But now, sixteen weeks later, the daily exchange of, \Zao nimen dou hao ma?\ - \Hen hao. xiexie ni,.,' exemplifies how this once insurmountable language can be successfully \tamed\ and turned into conversational Chinese.

To say nething of the half light of the Rathskeller. Without further ado, let the feverish scribbling begin. A curious desire to mingle in the GE noon hour crowd led rne to the Erie Barge '~Erie Blvd., in the vicinity of the Other World bookstore). In my Electrictown career, I had never visited this bistro. The recent failure of the business stimulated my interest. How <Jould a place with an ample parking lot and .a giant potential clientele lurking nearby fail? That question remains to · be answered. The cur rent management s.bould 'be there for a while though. The luncheon menu· is simple, and the sandwiches substantial. There is a soup du jour which ·one can substitute for the omnipresent french fries. I chose a .pastrami sandwich on rye. It was satisfying, although uninspired. The sandwich was fat, and the meat lean, the opposite of which is often true in Capita'land. The flavor of the pastrami was a tad bl'and, and the bread suspiciously li:ke Freihofer 1 s celebrated Buffet Rye. My Connect i c ut cultivated companion, by now a veteran of the Electric lunch experience, opted for a humongous hamburger, l was able to observe changes in her expression seeming. to indicate satisfaction.

STUDENT EXPERIENCES IN RUSSIA At the corner of Altamont Ave. and lfamburg St. is a little estabJisllment called the Tip foe Inn. Ha Ha, thought I, Tip Toe Inn-Stagger Out. This past week, the Ranger and I dropped in (ln case you weren't aware, Rangers are ready te drop .anywhere.) We found a bright, cheerfullocal pub, complete with bantering regulars et al. The staff seems to consist .of several women, and they impart the feeling ,that you just dropped by .tlteir home for a visit. by CHUCK KATZ This is the second half of a two- part article on student Larry Kirsch's experience in Russia. Concordy:Let's switch over to Russian culture for a minute; what is the food in Moscow like? 'Larr:y Kirsch: First of all, there are very few vegetables, hardly any fruits. and the quality of meats is terrible. A lot of people around Moscow have very little meat to eat. As it turned out, Moscow was not half as bad as Leningrad. where the food they gave us was almost completely unpalatable. I remember one night we ate dog, and we probably ate cat as well. In Russia, you'll hardly ever see a stray dog or cat roaming the streets because they're eaten. However. the dairy products, such as milk and cheese, are good. I don't want to mislead you by saying that all of the Russian food is bad; it's not. If you know where to go in Russia, what restaurants. and what to order, the Russian cmsme can be excellent. The fish there happens to be very good. They have Sturgeon in abundance, which costs a phenomenal amount in the U.S. Of course, the Russian way of serving is that it takes about a half hour between courses. One time I ate in a restaurant. I spent three and a half hours there, which tends to kill the day. However. the majority of the Russian people do not eat the better quality food. Q. Did you find anything interesting or peculiar about the Russian way of life? A. It struck me that the people are so preoccupied with a day to day struggle for existence. You don't know what it is to buy in a Russian store. To buy something, you have to stand in one line to find out what the item costs, then you have to get in another line for a receipt, and then you have to go to a thicd line to pick up the item. This takes a great deal of time. For a housewife to put together a meal, she has to spend so much time on lines, because there are different lines for most items she has to buy. She has to go to one store tor meat, another store for fish, and even if she can buy the meat and fish in the same store, she has to stand in different lines to do so. The stores there are not like our supermarkets. You can't just go and pick up things in an aisle. For the Russian people, a great deal of their time is spent cuing up in lines. I personally feel that this situation is purposely perpetrated by the government so the people don't think about how bad off they feally are. Q. How were your living accommodations'! A. We were housed in betel rooms,· with three people to a suite. The attitude I think one has to go to Russia with is to expect the worst Anything favorab-le that you get should be considered a bonus. This attitude worked for me. I expected the Pilint to be peeling off the walls and the plumbing to be inadequate. But in Moscow 1 was pleasantly surprised. We were on the 14th floor of a IS story building. We had plenty of heat and plenty of hot water. Incidentally, we had plenty o.f cockroaches toe, but that comes with the territory. However, in Tallin. we had to go for five days without water. We couldn't shower or wash. The name of the hotel in Tallin was called The T oombes, which I felt to be quite appropriate. Q. Did you hllve any problems while in the hotel, otherthan your room being bugged'! A. Of course, for the first few weeks we had to get over the initial dysentery. You can imagine the three of us going through toilet paper like crazy! By the end of the first week we had used up about two rolls, which really isn't that much. We went to the lady who sits on our t1oor to help us with any problems we had. There was one on every floor of every hotel; you hand in your keys to her when you leave and you pick them Up again when you come back in. If you have any problems you go to her. So, we asked' her if we could get some more toilet paper. She said, \1'111 sorry, but you've used up your allotment for this month.\ So she wouldn't give us any. That's the type of thing Americans take for granted; there's no toilet paper. Certain inconveniences like that . could make you almost not want to go back. I remember the same thing happened in Minsk. We had just checked into the hotel that day, and found there was no toilet paper in our room. I asked the lady sitting on the floor if I could have some toilet paper. She made about 5 or 6 phone calls behind the desk, then s'he finally turned around, opened the combination safe behind here, took out a roll of toilet paper and handed it to me. Q. Did you have to go through this routine every time you wanted a roll of toilet paper? A. No. Eventually we founcl where to buy toilet paper; at 11 kopecs (close to twenty cents), it was was well worth lt. It's interesting, because the Americans think. 'Of course the Russians have toilet paper; they're not that backward.' But, it's surprismg. Q. Being a visitor, did you find that any of the Russian people tried to ta~e advantage of you'! A.lt's funny, because we 'had a little trouble with a cab driver one d~y. Normally, the cab fare to the school costs about 67 kopecs (about •$L25), but this one day my roommate and I came out of the hotel and went up to a cab driver and said, \Take us to the Pushkin Institute.'' The driver was standing neKt to another driver, a friend of his, and he said ... Two rubles.\ We knew the fare was only 67 kopecs, so we realized he was trying to cheat us. Then the other cab driver goes to him. ••No, .no, that•s too cheap; three rubles.\ I had a sarcastic urge. so l said to them, ••Five rubles and that's my final offer,\ and l walked away. They both looked quite puzzled. That's -how you survive in a place like that. You can't take it too seriously, because they think you're a tourist coming out .of a hotel; and they want to get you, just like a cab driver almost anywhere in the world. Q.Given aU that you expenenceu m Russia, do you feel that you would want to go back'? A. It's hard to explain. As bad as it was sometimes, with the weather,. it gets quite cold there; the shortages of food; the things that I'm not accustomed to, and tbe things I didn't have ~here that I have here; in some way I'm just drawn to it. There's a certain magnetism about Russia; yeah, I'd go back. I really don't know why; l don't know if it's the language, but there's something about it which I' have a definite interest in.

P.ctge 15 rt5 HOckey Falls to Maine by DANNY WOJNILOWER Before a SJll!.f.lle crowd re.sernbling those that have been attending Union basketball g~nrtes, the Dutchmen fell to the University of Maine by a score of 10\1 last Saturday afternoon at Achilles Rink. In fact, many of the small group of Union students present exited during the first intermission following a fine figure skating performance by Nanette Pasquini beneath the scoreboard reading Maine 4- Union 0. Few bright spots marked the first stan~a for the Dutchmen who were outshot 19-3. A number of fine saves by goaltender Dave Schmertz and a beautiful diving stop of a two-on-one break by sophomore defenseman Bob Smolens stood out in an otherwise poor period.

BY LYNN BATEMAN lt was a long week for the Dutchwomen as they had three games coming up within five days, one at New Paltz and the other two a home and home series with RPI. The first game against New Paltz was the bright spot of the week as lJ nion pressed their way to a win in a sometimes very slow game. New Paltz played lethargically and unfortunately Union played down. to tlreir level, but fortunately not low enough. that they would lose. lt was aa excellent game for Sheila O'Donnell as she bagged l'J points and snagged many New Paltz passes. Jill Henry was next high scorer with 13 points and a number of tough rebounds. The final minutes saw Union literally mauled by New Paltz as the Stateswomen realized that they were definitely going to lose. as they did, with Union on the high ' side, 53-41. The next probably the two games which the team would most like to forget, as they were both squeakers lost to RPI, back to back. The first game took place at Union last Thursday night, and Union was very confident that they would tally another win against unfortunate RPI. The play was very close and the score was within two p<Jints almost the entire game - and as the clock ticked on there Was a race to win the game. Union could not quite ·seem to pull it off, however, as they lost by a hair to the Engineers 39-37. The next game on Saturday at RPI was almost an instant replay of th.at Thursday's, as the two teams battled it out on the court with tied scores most of the time and good hustle. With one minute left, Union was down 39-37 with the chance to tie it up and go into overtime, but it just was not to be as Union had several fouls.as they desperately pressed RPl, and downed· DQnna \Hust1~1.; 1 Reals, leading women's hooper. Sheila O'Donnell was high scorer in both games with 14 and 12 points respectively, and Sandi Key and Jill Henry dominated the boards as they pulled down 61 beautiful rebounds between· them in the two games. Fate took a turn for the better for the Dutchwomen later this past week a!> they garnered two more wins while suffering a setback by Skidmore. The Skiddies came to Union with winning on their minds, and no matter hOw hard Union tried, with Sheila O'Donnell and Jill Henry scoring 12 and 14 points, and Jill's 22 rebounds,. they could not persuade the Skidmore team to do otherwise as they took the well-fought game 60-48. This fact did not daunt the Dutchwomen, however, as they traveled to Siena the next Thursday and behaved like unruly guests, trouncing their hosts 65-53. The game. in general was very sloppy, characterized I!~ many-fouls on bofh sides, but this did not stop Sheila O'Donnell from having an excellent game with a high of 32 points, and many steals and interceptions. Del>bie Sears was next high scorer with 12 points an<l 13 rebounds. When Siena returned to Union on Saturday in search of revenge, they found their attempts thwarted by the buzzing bombers from Union, who used every opportunity to search for the nets, scoring 62 to Siena's 54. Sheila O'Donnell and bebbie Sears were high scorers again with 19' and 14 points, and Debbie .. Soaring\ Sears pulled down 18 rebounds . . Besides the victory; there were two other highlights in the game · on Saturday. One was the much- improved sfouL shooting of the Dutehwomen as they- hit ·18 for 25 at the line; and the other was the surprise talent of the team, Jill Thomson. Jill Henry has very unfortunately been sidelined with an ankle injury for a short while, so Coach Barta thought it wise to recruit another player to round out the bench. Jill Thoms<ln agreed to help out, and did so in excellent style. The next home game is Saturday the 18th, against Clarkson. Be there! Assumption opened up thf second half with eight consecu· • tive hoops. Moreover, they neve; lost their lead as they continuall~ out-rebounded the Dutchmer underneath. Soboscinski continued to shoo well, 18 points total, but U nior could not. st<Jp Assumption fron getting two or three shots evefl time down court. A-s a result Assumption won 66-55. Mlke·laeco Greg Sobocinski: 44, and Mike Smith combine for bound.

The P AB !~It that it was not effectively ftlnctioning as an advisory boar\'1. The opportunities were hDt present for two-way discussion between the board and presidertt, and as a result effecti~e consultation did not occur. The sentiment among many committee members is that the situation currently present is not conducive to mutual cooperation on: matters of importance to the college.

Their pUrpose was to answer any questions Forum members had concerning the establishment of a NYPlRG chapter at Union. The discussion featured questions in reference to suitable typ'es of funding for this operation and the advisability of subjecting this matter \to student referendum. 'fhe first question coming from the floor dealt with concern over the distribution of funds received (rom our campus. Any financial assistance given to NYPIRG by Union College will be spent on our own chapter. Costs eQcountered would covet the financing of NYPIRG publica- tions, - Xerox expenses and professional (non,..student} staff salaries. In case the creation of this new branch resulted in expenses higher than Union funding provided, extra funds would tlow into the Union branch from the central organization. NYPJRG usually employs a funding mechanism whereby every member of the benefiting student body contributes $2 per semester for its function .. S.U.N, Y. at Albany is on a two- semester regular scholastic pro- gram. Therefore, full-time students give $4 per annum to the organization. However, Albany's summer students are assessed an additional $2. lt was questioned . whether Union students, who study in a trimester system, would be taxed a total of $6 per year;. plus the additional $2 for students (such as 6-year law and medical students} who take courses during the summer term. The type of funding finally decided upon would depend on the contract oe.gotiated between Union and NYPIRG. . is a referendum every two years to confirm the continuance of student interest. Brian O'Toole questioned the advisability of a small college with tinancial restrictions like Union .. diving head first into such an adventure.\ He inquired if' we could not perhaps fund .. a paragraph instead of a chapter.\ NYPIRG replied that such a scaling down would not be feasible, but to guard against non- acknowledgement of student dis- satisfaction with the chapter, an annual referendum could be taken. President Ganz reported the latest news from the All College Senate. The wording of last week's Student Forum resolution condemnin·g Provost C. W. Huntley~s reappointment of Jay Shupe as Admissions Director was seriously objected to. Therefore., the Student Forum carefully reworded their proposal to be resubmitted. The third major area of Forum discourse brought up Casey -Qtllanan's te~ignation from the Presidential Advisory Board. Mr. Callanan reportedly had a verbal disagreement with President Bonner over Bonner's apparent failure to bring certain pertinent information. before the Board, and the occasional misrep- resentation of those mattets. The Forum meeting ended in a closed session after which Todd Miller, the Forum Secretary, submitted his resignation. experience which could only have been a valuable asset in his next professional position. Subsequent to his work at Carnegie-Mellon, St. Margaret Memorial Hospital in Pittsburgh oftered Hauser the position of Chief financial Officer and he served · in that capacity for approximately eight and one half yeats. According to Mr. Mauser. the hospital was similar in size and operating budget to Union College. He went on to point out further similarities in that \both Union and the hospital are non- profit organizations, and both are in the people business.\ Mr. Hauser decided to make the move from St. Margaret's to Union because he felt his profes- sional opportunities there were limited. While at Carnegie- Mellon, he had heard much about Union's academic reputation. The job as described to him was clearly a challenge, ana his interview with Concordiensis seemed to indicate that this was the kind of position he was looking for. Though he was able to make a professional contribution to the fimmcial sector of the hospital, Mr. Hauser sees his new position as \allowing him to broaden his activities and having greater growth potential.\ Prior to taking over his .. command\ at Union, Mr. Hauser went through a screening process which required him to make three separate trips. On two of these occasions he met with various members of the College on campus, and on another occasion he traveled to Boston for a meeting with two members of the Board of Trustees who chair the Finance Committee and the Budget and Audit Committee, respectively. Mr. Hauser later attended the January 25th meeting of the Board of Trustees in New York City. Since his permanent arrival on campus, Mr. Hauser has attended a tneeting of the President's Cabinet, and also a meeting oft~· Planning and Priorities Committee. His initial reaction following these meetings is that there is every indication that the budget will be balanced this year, and that whatever \trimming and Ted Bick, C~a.irma'! of Presidential Advisory Board Randy Feldman motioned that a referendum should be presented to gauge student interest in NY PlRG. Todd Miller suggested that a poll, which would merely engage student opmaon, be substituted for a referendum, which would constitute a binding decision. The amended motion was carried. H the Spring Term interest poll is favorable toward NY PlRG, a referendum wiU follow which, if passed; would commit student financial suppott.

They are ultimately concerned with the well being and good future of this college. It would be easy for any given individual within a specific sector ol this college to gain nearly complete acceptance of a proposal based in his sector were it not t:or the actions and efforts- of the members of this college who chose to remain involved. From a desire to see Union College remain above water, Students, Faculty and Administrators remain involved and active in the transactions and decisions which are carving this college's path. ·rhus, having become accustomed to this manner of action, when the administration, and especially the president, deny or attempt to alter the process which allows members of this campus to contribute in a positive fashion to the workings of this institution, they are asking for a continuation of the criticism and controversy which the president claims is causing the downfalL Yet it seems ironic that the controversy represents the attempts of many to prevent that same · downfall. The recent activity between the PAB and the president is highly illustrative. The members of the PAB legitimately felt that the decision regarding Shupe's reinstatement had been determined without giving them the opportunity for constructive positive input. Also it appears that previously submitted positive input, narnely the Allen Report, was ignored. The question which remains is why did the president and the administration ignore the Allen Report's findings'! Of concern to the president, especially with regard to the PAB, is that of confidentiality. ln Casey Callanan's letter (see letters section), the president appears fea-rfal about having matters discussed in the Board meetings appear in the pages of Concordiensis. His worry seems somewhat unfounded since members of the PABhave not \spilled the beans\ to CoJ1eordy. The only contribution to the paper made by PAB student members has been in the form of last week's commentary \Apparent Discrepancies.\ The article. discussed nothing which was not already public knowledge. Shupe's reinstatement and the Allen Report were not only known to the PAB, and thus Con~ordy cannot see a breach of confidentiality. What Concordiensis does see, however, is a criticism of presidential actions. lf tllis cFiticism is at the basis of Bonner's claims to loss of confidentiality by his Board members, then Union is being led by a man who cannot take constructive criticism. Another aspect may center around Bonner's dislike of public discussion ol maHers before the PAB by members of that cotnm1ttee. ·In ellect, 1s Bonner saying that membership precludes the opportunity lor opinion concerning matters already of public knowledge'! It seems that criticism is important in a democracy, and that it allows lor the interaction ot strong ideals. Through the controversy, the best aspects are maintained while the weaker are cast away. With this in mind, Con~ordiensis hopes to open up channels tor discussion and disagreement. Under the fire of community scrutiny, ideas can be tested and valued. Without it, ideas are being implemented without the careful screening which might point out flaws and weaknesses. t:oncordiensis hopes that within this community, clear channels ol discussion and criticism will open and widen. U they are closed or lorced shut, a major portion of the positive thought which maintains this campus a strong one will be silenced and lost. Concordy is not advocating that everything should come under criticism, but if thing$ seem inappropriate, then good constructive criticism should be levied and not unwarranted attacks. In this case, those ideas and proposals will be allorded the opportunity for defense and in this fashion nebulous tlloughts and ideals may be transformed into positive actions for the good of this school. Por this to h;tppen, everyone, especially the president, rrn.isl be open and truthful. With clear, open discussion, officials. can truly do their jobs and support the beliefs of those whom they represent. Editon-in-cbief .........................................................

It was submitted to the editors with the request that their names be withheld for obvious reasons. * * * * Most incoming t'reshman males and females are aware of the unha,lanced male to female ratio that exists here at Union, but an~ not aware of nor prepared for the social patterns which result from this ratio. (this is nQt meant to sound erude, just an honest part of ·the pattern). We discussed our majors at dozens of fraternity parties, with males, most of whom we would not even recognize today. And we had to explain aU too often that we did not want another drink because the drinks made at fraternity parties were so strong that we would never make it home after even one more. It was and is not that we do not like the fratern.ity parties, but that we went to all of them indisctimi- nantly because we incorrectly assumed that going to all of them was a necessary part of being socially active. We are now more selective in the ones that we attend. There is definitely a prestige asociated with U pperclass male- freshman female relationships. It s~ems to l:>e very difficult to carry on a friendship with a persen of the opposite gender here. As soon as a guy expresses an interest in a more intense relationship and the girl rejects that idea, wishing to continue enjoying the friendship as it existed, the guy disappears. We've noted definite differences between males in fraternities and non-fraternity males. They seem to be seawhing for different levels of relationships. lt is not that we mean to be intentionally critical. It is just that · we are tired of the games . ceaselessly going on here, but we are fully aware of the fact that we · will continue to play the games until we graduate. The first stage of the patterns which we encountered involved freshman males. Logically, unfamiliarity with surroundings tor the first few weeks of Fall term gave freshman males something in common with freshman females. But we soon noticed a pattern developing. After spending evenings with freshman males, we both noticed, separately, that they have a tendency to leave belongings behind in our rooms. This left them with the false security of knowing that indeed they would be able to come back. Just for the record, belongings ranged from tennis rackets to radios. Vacancies After a few weeks we had had enough of the games freshman males play and sought the accompaniment of . \mature\ upperclassmen. This in itself was a game, as we soon .discovered that we, along with most of the other freshman females, were seeking the companionship of upperclassmen. This is where we first encountered the stiff competition between Union females, regardless of class. But that is another story. We went for four months without buying our own drinks, and even then we · by choice Mislead I he position of Secretary to the Student Forum has recently become available ..

There is little chan.;:e that the school will not be re-accredited, and so the main purpose of the process, which takes place every 10 years .is actually to give the college a chance to evahlate itself, examining ; its strengths and weaknesses, and to look into the future as to how weaknesses will be handled, The Commissi6n of Higher Education· allows the College many choices. as to how to go about .performing the self-study. Some of these are: I) Comprehensive ~- where every major aspect of the college is appraised, 2) Comprehensive with certain emphases - basically the same with special attention given to selected areas, and 3) selected topics ~ concentration on certain areas or aspects of tl:le college. lt is expected, as indicated by a member of the Planning lilld .

Possible areas of emphasis · include the following: c,ievelqpment of an Honors program, the Admissions system. the development of the Arts program, the Library, the athletics program, the governance system, the role of Engineering, and the role of continuing education. Since the beginning of 'this year, at least two statements of mission have surfaced: one from the Planning and Priorities Co~­ mittee, as referred to above, and one from President Bonner. The Statement from Planning and Priorities stressed that the ''mission <Jf Union College shall be to provide the highest possible quality liberal education to undergraduate students in the fine arts, humanities, social sciences. natural sciences. and engineering\ and that \critical thought. the .acquisition of specialized kl)owledge, and the awareness of a sense of social and intellectual context,\ shalLbe encouraged.

Sakala, Union's Director of Athletics, may become part of the college's admissions committee, The committee establishes .procedures to be followed by the admissions staff in the review of applications for admission her:e an9 also reviews a pottion of each class' application folders, The proposal that the director of athletics or a \designated representative\ serve on · the admissions committee was made at the committee's Feb. 1 meeting. The proposal was on the agenda as new business of the All- College Senate, which could have given it fmrnal approval, at that body's February 9 meeting. However, the Senate dicl not consider the matter, and it was ~ postponed until the next meeting. ... Until that time, Mr. Sakala has .§ • been invited to attend all ~ . admissions committee meetings. ·~ i During this time, he will have no voice in the committee~s decisions. A. D~ Sakala to serve on Admissions Committee? The admissions committee now consists of elhen faculty Budget Discussed In light of some recent innuendoes concerning the management of the school's budget. Con.:ordiensis W<Juld like to present some basic information surrounding the budget in order that everyone might more . fqlly understand it. A budget is a plan for coordinating income and exp~nses; that is to say,. a certain amount of money is received by the school in the form of tuition and t'ees, gifts, grants, etc., and a certain amount is spent on administration, faculty. maintenance, etc. to run the schooL The tinancial officers of the college make estimates for both revenues and expenditures,· thereby preparing a budget. At the end of the yea,r (in June), when the ad.ual revenues and the actual expenditures become knQwn, the school deterqtines whether there has been a budget surplus or a budget deficit. For example, in 1976-77, the school received $15,005,014 in revenues, and spent $15,005,533, creating a deficit of $519. Without wanting to inject any subjectivity it must nonetheless be noted that it is commonplace to encounter deficits and surplusses into the thousands ocf dolla.rs as Faealty Meet The Union College Faculty met Wednesday. February 15th ·in the Old Chapel at 4:30 to discuss matters concerning the tenure process and the awarding of Latin Honors for the 1977-1978 academic year. The meeting was chaired by President Bonner. The Latin Honors system was again redefined due to conflicts between newly established criteria and the published figures in the catalogue which was distributed to the current senior class when they were freshmen in the fall of 1974. The figures announced at that time are to be used; the Latin Honors. system . required that .a student maintain an average of 3.0 to 3.49 to graduate Cum Laude. 3.5 to 3.64 to graduate Magna Cum Laude and 3.65 or better to receive the honor of Suma Cum Laude. Proposals enacted by the Registrar last year required that these requirements be elevated due to the high number of students with indices in those ranges. Suma. Cum I aude was elevated to 3.~ and up, Magna (urn I aude was changed to 3.6 to 3. 79, and L'um Laude required a cumulative index of 3.35 to J59. I he higher levels established were deemed unapplicable to the clas~ ol 1977 because .they had not been properly informed ol the changes through the normal catalogue methods. This action taken by the faculty upon student request was enacted by the PAB and the All-College Senate. The faculty also determined that the cla&s of 1978 would be subject to the new elevated requirements. Again, this year, complaints concerning notification and catalogue announcement have prompted the faculty to allow the application of the old; lower numerical ranges for the awarding· of Latin Honors. To avoid this type of contlict again, the faculty decided to leave the achievement levels open in the catalogue and base the awardi~g of Latin Honors on yearly announce- ments. The second major item of business was that concerning the renewal of contracts of those professors who have attained a tenurable status. The Committee on Faculty presented new considerations. Currently, before each contract renewal (once every three to five years), the tenurable faculty member goes thr.ough a re-evaluatiun process which determines whether he can remain at that status. Also, before the tenurable professor is given a tenured position, a re-evaluatiun process must be completed. At present, the faculty, Dean of Faculty and the Committee on faculty act with very specific guidelines for \passage\ through the re-evaluation process in all cases. Without adopting any- thing as final or concrete, the faculty considered various pro- posals to restructure the process bringing a professor from a contract renewing tenurable posi• t1on to a tenured position which does not have the renewing.aspect involved. Before any proposals can be formulated and any action taken, the Board of trustees must be consulted and\ their views considered in the re-structuring process. Mention was also made at the meeting concerning the type of action which the faculty should take regarding the Shupe incident. Professor Bick, Chairman of the PAB indicated that the issue would be dealt with at the next meeting of the Board. No specific action was deemed appropriate by the faculty at that time. .. unforeseen expenditures and savings are always cropping up. For e~t.ample - an oil'icer of the school leaves or passes away - his salary doesn't have to be paid. Anyone whose job involves a budget of some kind · will -of~ course know that a budget balanced to the last cent is ridiculous; it never occurs, nor should it. The budget projections for 1977-78 are as follows: Revenues - $8,203,200 in regular tuition and $214,800 in application, orientation, graduation, foreign st11dy, and: miscellaneous fees as well as forfeited admissions deposits Which give the day pra_gram a total of $8,.418,000 . Continuing education totals $1,267,000. Endowment income (the money earned by the school's endowment fund, now about 30 million dcllats) tata:ls $1,000;000. Total gifts and grants $1,833,100. Total ~ponsored research (Federal gov't., New York State, Private Sponsors) - $430,000. Total other sponsored programs ~ $215,000. Total Jecovery of indirect casts (sponsored research and programs) - $60,()()0. Other sources $1 1\0 Total student aid ~ $518,500. Athletics - $15,000** (note-Achilles Rink, $195;000, is listed separately with auxiliary enterprises). Therefore, total educational and general revenues $13,892,073. Auxiliary enterprises, which include dormitories, Dutch H oil ow, Bookstore. Achilles Rink (the $195,000 mentioned above), and the Girling Center totals $2,099,600. The total revenue, tnen, is set at $15,991,673. ·rhe ex. pendrtilre side is obviously much more detailed. Educational and General ex.pendittnes, broken down by department (history. economics, etc.) and other categories such as the Central Machine Shop, Faculty Assistants, Faculty Research, Travel, etc. totals $3.~19,912. Sponsored research totals $476,000. Other sponsored programs $229,000. Graduate studies and continuing education $.1,097,010. Library $6-15,098. Student services $676,337.

Page6 arts CONCORDIENSIS, February 22, 1978 cultbre - Poet to Give Reading Poet John Ashbery will give a reading of his works at Union College at 8 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 23, in Room 202 of the Fine Arts Building. It's fr.ee and open to the public. Ashbery, whose latest book Housebo~t .Days, was published last fall, has achieved a permanent and prominent place among the major contemporary poets. Essay lni tia ted \The Separated Family,\ a photographic essay based upon various encounters with families in the Schenectady community, has been initiated by the members of the Intermediate Photography course otlered through the Department of the Arts at Union College. Under Professor Nina Rosenblum's supervi~ion, Beth Doropr;ker, Sara Jones, Randy Meyers, Michael May and Barry Eagle have begun this project which will conclude sometime in May with exhibits at the Schenectady Museum and other community showplaces. Their purpose is to document the workings gf the farnily in Schenectady and surrounding areas . .Jn particular, they inhatd te concentrate on the families in the lower stratum of society. The working hypothesis is that a low income level places stress on the family structure. Their intent is to discover the nature of these strains and the means with which they are dealt. This will be accomplished throllgh visits with various families and group homes and the development of close personal relationships with the subjects of the study. One recent collection of 39 poems, Self~Portrait in a Convex Mirror, won the three most coveted Ame~ican literacy prizes --: The Natwnal Book ·Critics Ctrcle Award, the National Hook Award, and the Pulitzer Prize. Earlier works include Tu.-andot and Other Poems, Some Trees The Teonis Court Oath, Rive~ and Mountains, The Double Dream of . Spring, and Three Poems. He has written plays and essays and is co-author, with James Schuyler, of a novel, A Nest of Ninnies. . So~et~mes puzzling and always tmagmatlVe, Ashbery's work has been described by critics as embracing both avant-garde and traditional elements. ' His poems contain \evocations of a richly populated inner life that reveal a wholly original awareness of all the disguises that reality takes,\ The New York Times has said. Try It You Might Like It Having studied the works of such artists as Lewis Hine, Eugene Smith, Earl Dotter and the Farm Security Administration, a socio-realistic photographic approach has been decided on as the best mode of conveying their concern with the subject. They feel that the visual impact of an artistic and intellectually designed photographic essay will have a far reaching effect on the community. \Sense is often illusory ... so that Mr. Ashbery's close illusions of sense have especially grasped our attention, giving us the turn that provides a:ccess to an immense range of deiights,\ wrote A. R. Ammons. A native. of Rochester, N.Y., Ashbery ·grew up on a farm in western New York State and was educated at Deerfield Academy, Harvard, and Columbia, where he specialized in English literature. by STEVE MONOSSON The subject of this article will probably be offensive, to say the .least, to the general populu:s of this campus. But this is due solely to the fact that the gcl'lera.l populus is basically uninformed about the topic of this article and threfore does not really have an hone.st judgement to .offer. If people would just open their ears a little they would find themselves treated to an amazing new phe11omenon which could change the tace of modern society. And what is l;tis super power which is imminent and powerful and just all around . spectacular'! Punk Rock!!! Those of you still with me should,ma:ke at least half an e:ffort to listen to what is being said here, because the object known as punk rock is truly somethitt.g to be listened to open-mindedly. Clear away the hype and what you have is a movement designed to return rock and roll to its basic roots and to clear away the technological and \artistic\ bullcrap which has attached itself to rock and roll over the past couple of decades. That's all. Whatever else comes along is only done to purport that motto, and for the plain sake of being outrageous. Remember when tl1e Beatles failed to cut their bair'! Well, I don't because I was too young at the time; but the fact remains that both events (hair length and punk rock) were given RA APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE Beginning Monday, Feb. lO, applications for the positio11 of Resident Advisor will be available at the Housing Offi4le in Old Gym Hall.

Johnny Rotten; the Pistols' gifted lead singer, takes the standpoint of the group which The resulting implications of the work could provide an extraordinary educational experience. The work of the FSA (Farm Security Administratin) proves that a project of this is one leaning toward social disturbance rl).ther than musical prestige; but that only adds to the high pitched fervor of the tunes. ·~God Save the Queen\ is bysterically anti-traditionalist. \Sub-Mission\ deals . with an underwater love aflairs while '•No Feelings\ sums it all up as J.R. boldly proclaims his self- superiority.

It is their sincere hope that their finished project will, like Walker Evans· and James Agee's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, be a work in which the viewer \is no less centrally· involved than the authors and those of whom they tell.\ Sadly, most people probably will continue to abhor the Sex Pistols and all other proponents of punk politics, even after this one-sided, glossed over, false in parts document. If by sc;>me chance somebody does heed this message and continue to despise the movement after listening to the record, dori't give up.

In 1955, he went to France, where he wrote art criticism tor the Paris Herald Tribune. He returned to New York in 1965, was executive editor of Art News until 1972, and now teaches English at Brooklyn College. His last book, Houseboat Days, is .his \Very best book,\ reviewer Harold Bloom said, \with many astonishing poems in it; some . transcending even Ashbery's most beautiful work.\ Ashbery's Feb. 23 appearance at Union is sponsored by the. college's Lectures, Films, and Concerts Committee. ATS·To Perform They've played for crowds of upwards of 15,000 people to standing ovations. They've worked vith acts like Loggins & Messina,. Neil Sed aka, The Band, Judy Collins, Bette Midler, and David Bromberg -delighting all these audiences. Rex Fowler and Neal Sh1.1hnan - AZTEC TWO- STEP - have brought their magic .t() records, with their three albums. \Aztec Two-Step\ was a critical success, and established Fowler and Shulman ·as multi- talented :singers; musicians, and writers. \Second Step\ marked Aztec's RCA debut, containing many Aztec favorites: \rm ln Love Again'', \Faster Gun\ \Walkin.g On Air\ and ••Humpty Dumpty\'. Three years in the making, this second album was the culmination nf an emotinal and physically draining period of hard W()rk, miles upon miles, and at times, desperation. ..Two's CompaiJ.y\ is full of the depth and lyricism, the strong melodies and subtle harmonies that have endeared them to their fans. Theirs is what Rex describes as .. really personal music\ .. It's close to the heart. Aztec Two-Step has been in existence since the summer of 1971. At the time, Rex, a native of Maine, and Neal, ~ full- blooded New Yorker, were WQrking · independently in the Boston area, They met at the Stone Phoenix Coffeehouse, and on that summer night, Aztec Two-Step was born. The musical combination of Neal's urban perceptions and Rex's mild,. agrarian background clicked immediately. For the past few years, Rex Fowler and NeaJ Sh!llman have been weaving a unique patchwork of folk, rock and country. Wherever they perform. their loyal, fanatical,. and always vocal fans come out to support them. lhey have created something of a legend about themselves. Come~ see, heat, listen, absorb, enjoy, experience Aztec Two-Step on Sunday, February 26 at 9:00 in· the Memorial Chapel. It's a concert you won't forget. Maurice B.

Page 10 · ~- CONCORDIENSIS, February J2, 1978 Dining Alternatives You deserve a break today. by DAN ROSENBAUM Suppose you are one of the many who simply can not stomach Saga for even one more meal. Suppose· also that you know yourself well enough to know that unless you have. a place you are supposed to eat, you would be subsisting on a diet of Fritos and Twinkies. Or .suppose you just hate te cook, or like to cook but can~t. Or say you want more out of culinary life than a sub at the skeller, or a steak sandwich at the Pub, or a Plastic Platter at our favorite all-nitery, the Jolly Tiger. (No one really eats at White Tower, do they'!) One answer is the fraternity meal plan. Several houses have opened up their dining rooms to independents and, often, the food is relatively cheap, relatively good and some places even gwe \munch-out\ privileges. This· article makes no attempt to judge the quality or ambience of each plan. · fhat is left dther to -your bravery or another article. All that will be found below are the bare facts: what it costs, what you get, and (in case you don't knoW) where it is. Delta Chi is located off in the furthest reaches of Lenox Road., in the northern side of Raymond House. If you live on campus, that might be an inconvenience, but there is a large colony of Unionites over on Nott St. that are closer to D. Chi than anything (besides Rupsis). They charge $32()./term, for three meals a day on weekdays. Also, yo1,1 get breakfasts on the weekends. and .tel'tovers whenever you can get then1. Twice a term, you are expected to pitch in with t·he dishes, but most of that work is done by a ·crew of seven, Who get a reduced rate for their food. Delta Phi charges· $240 f term for three meals a day, five days a week, with breakfast and lunch on Saturdays. The kitchen is open and they say there's no kitchen duties involved. Kappa Alpha, in South Davidson, is reknown for having the best food on campus. I don't know if that's true or not, but they do have one of the most flexible plans around, and they say they'll tailor it around your needs. Basically, 15 meals costs $300, lunches and dinners only is $270 and dinners alon~ cost $150. The kitchen is open and although they hire w~iters, the waiter's list is very long, so don't count on it Eats and Honky Tonks Phi Sigma Kappa, now installed in South Fox, has just begun to open its dining room to independents. They cha:rge $235 per term for fifteen meals .per week, with no kitchen privileges and no kitchen duties. Dinners alone run about $140. by ED CLOOS III How are Schenectady and New York the same'! In both cities one can make investments on Wall Street. Due to my great guilt over not paying any taxes. l often feel compelled to generate revenue for the city and state by investing with Schenectady's premier investment firm. Taking a plunge in the working man's \Market as it were. On my most recent investment foray, my satisfaction with my noble act was so great that I decided to take myself out for lunch. When in the vicinity of State and Erie, this is no easy matter, as a half dozen choices beckon. Maurice's usually wins out, but this time I decided to try something different. For the sake of nostalgia, Slick's Tavern (Ferry & Liberty, down the street from Jack In The ... ) was my choice. In d'ays of yme, while a resident of the fringe oft he Stockade, I passed many an hour in Slick's. The attractions in those days were giant roast beef sandwiches, a large bottled beer s~lection, late movies on Cable T.V., and an occasional inter- esting customer. Small~ quiet, clean, and always open till 4 A.M., Slick's was an ideal place to misspend youth. I remember well the night Marty Marston, . an ex-Electric City tavern frequenter, and I got in a long conversation with a nut. A huge guy of about thirty, he had just gotten out of a hospital somewhere. Apparently he tost the greater part of his sanity in the service of Uncle Sam. As t~e passed, we discovered that he had just come into town on the 'Hound, was living at the \Y ,\ and planned to take Hotel and Restaurant Management courses at Schenectady Community. We got into a long rap about the Italian neighborhood where he had grown up in Rochester. I played softball on the same fields he had, and drank in some of the same taverns. Then the experience began to get spooky. He talked loud, so that gradually everyone in the place came to be aware of him. After a few beers, he began to get paranoid. He would turn occasionally and admonish other patrons that it was \No fair talking bellind my back.\ Tension mounted as the clientele came to realize this a~some guy was crazy. Who knew but that he might try to tear the place up any minute? The bar stayed on edge as we continued to talk: I, for one, was a little hesita11t about leaving. Finally, after another hour or so. the guy abruptly left. Short story anyone'! Little has changed of the Slick's 1 knew a piddling two years ago. Budweiser SS Competition . The Eastern New York state championship in the Budweiser Super Stars competition, with teams competing from eight New York colleges and universities, will get under way at 2 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 25, at the Alumni Recreation Center of Siena College, Loudonville~ N.Y. Competing for the Eastern New York · championship and the opportunity to advance to regional and national meets will be teams from Columbia Univer- sity, C. W. ·post, the State University of New York College at Oneonta, Union College, Adelphi University, Siena College, College of St. Rose and the State University of New York at Albany, Since last fall, men and women athletes from I 75 colleges and universities ill 32 states have taken part in the Budweiser College Super Stars competition; initially at the campus level but advancing in 1978 to state, .regional and national finals. The Budweiser College Super Stars National Championship will be decided in competition to be held in May at Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla. Endorsed by the National Entertainment and Campus Activities Association, the Budweiser games pit teams of four men and two women (plus alternates) against each other in six events; volleyball, S80.:.yard relay race, obstacle course, canoe race (Frisbee toss if watersports are not available), tug-of~war and \six-pack\ Pitch, In (a basketball variation). Contestants must be full-time Stlldents at their respective institutions who have not participated in varsity sports and do not attend school on athletic scholarships. Campus level winners receive Budweiser College Super Stars athletic warm-up and competition uniforms and are advanced to state championship competition. State winners receive team and individual trophies, and regional and national. winners will receive trophy awards and merchandise prizes. Budweiser College Super Stars competition on the campus level is sponsored and coordinated by local Budweiser beer distributors in· their respective communities.

Except for prices, of course. Tbe old $1.50 Roast Beef sandwich is now $1. 90, but it's still a gigantic undertaking. With macaroni salad and chips, it definitely fills the gap. They also b,ave ham and turkey, and tuna on Fridays. Psi Upsilon, across from Humanities, costs $280 for lunches and dinners, five days a week. The kitchen is open and no waiting is expected. · l was so comfortable that I felt compelled to kill most of the afternoon, sipping beer and watching an Errol Flynn-Bette Davis movie about a newspaper- man with a drinking problem and a faithful wife. There's something intriguing about sitting in a tavern in the 70's watching a movie from the 30's depicting tavern scenes from the turn of the centJJry. In the days of the free lunch, laid back places like Slick's must have been the downfall of many a man. One of the leading aspects of this grill is its spotless cleanliness. Who knows what .ghosts lurk in the proprietor's subconsci(lUS'that cause him to polish the ash trays'! The cleanliness theme ~)(tends to a sign on the register urging the reader to \Keep Your City Clean. Eat a Pigeon.\ For a few quiet hours in an old time bar, Slick's is a good · bet. Speaking of good bets, the Boulevard Diner isn't getting my money again soon. Of all the late night greasy spoons, the food is the most lackluster, and the atmosphere the dullest at this establishment. Speaking ot' investments, good bets,.if you will, here's the best tip you'll get this year. Play Fratello Ed every time he runs, provided it's 7 furlongs or less, and you'll make out handsomely by year's end. Sigma Phi offers a lO meal plan for ·$250. In addition, they serve a light breakfast on weekends. Waiters eat free during the meals they work and the kitchen, again, is open. A.D. Phi charges $265 for ten meals. Waiters are paid, and the kitchen is open. A fifteen meal plan is $305 and arrangements are Hexible. The meals are great too. ZBT, of course, offers the Kosher Kitchen. For $300, they give you 15 meals during the week arrd a brunch on Saturday (closed kitchen and no clean-up). · 'fhere are also two non-Greek eateries at Union. One is Bronner House, in the southern corner of North College. Bronner House is a co-op set-up. Dinners on Monday through Thursdays are prepared by .people on the plan themsel~es. The price is $125 per term for fifteen meals, Kitcben is open, but remember, if you eat, you cook . There is also Smith House, nestled between Sigma Phi and A. D. Phi. It is also a co-op, with teams of two cooking for the 20 boarders once every two weeks. They charge $180 per term and the kitchen is closed. Dish- washers get discounts, but there are only two of them. Smith !!()use contracts their food purchases out to Fraternity Management Associates, which buys about half their food for them. They are the only independent eating plan on campus to contract out. In vin cibili ty Over three hundred scientific experiments, conductedat leading research institutes throughout the world on the growth of higher states of consciousness. have demonstrated that regular practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique enlivens the ten fundamentals of invincibility in the areas of physiology, psychology, sociology and ecology.

However, when thoughts start to stray onto bigger and better , terms, the Union term al>road program may come to mind. The following is one student's account of the term abroad in Italy. Septemb,er 19, 1977. Eurocentro Piazza Santo Spirito N~unlero 9-50122 Firenze, ltalia.. This was what we, the Union College students in italy, would kno'W as our home for the next ten weeks. Being in italy was the most incredible experience of my life. After all, at what other time did I wake up in the morning, playing \The Foreigner'!\ i rio longer could say \Good morning\ because th:e woman I lived with didn't speak English. Yes, like it or not, and I loved it, ·speaking Italian became routine. lt was not a challenge, but also a necessity. Union sent an incredibly great class to Italy. Our class primarily consisted of juniors, with a few seniors and one sophomore. We would often get 'together at a disco club or at the corner bar to socialize in an atmosphere that I've never known before. The old competitive \Gotta get the A\ feeling wasn 1 t staring us in tile face~ A more relaxed atmosphere resulted. A typical day for me began early (9:00 a.m.). Since we didn't have classes until 12:50, I had all morning to· play tourist. Then i would report to school, ten minutes early. of course, so l could check my mail and read whatever came througll. After school I would go home and talk to my Italian Mother (Signora Castelli). We would talk, during which she would correct my Bronx-Italian accent until I got it right. Before 7:30, I'd walk around Florence. Then there was dinner with Signora Castelli and Security Takes Action As part of the Affirmative Action program required of all institutions accepting Federal grants to education, a program has been initiated by Ms. Reagan, special assistant to President Bonner, and Ms. Dolores Harris in Security, to aid those students and faculty members needing special parking spaces adjacent to classrooms due to physical handi- caps or permanent disabilities. The affirmative action program's major responsibility is to monitor hiring , practices with regard to minorities and women. However, due to a need to assist persons with handicaps who otherwise would be greatly inconvenienced, a number of parking spaces have been set aside for this use through this office. As of now, there are only two spaces set aside, due to anumbel 'contact Dolores Harris at· of factors including the inability Security (370-6718).

My Signora took in boarders from many places. There was one Swiss student named Paul and three Americans. Through Paul, I met many students from all over the world (Ca-nada, West Germany, Switzerland, Holland, and several other ·countries). for the first five weekends l took off to see the cities of Capri, Venice, Rome, Pisa and Padua. Union . also sponsored trips to smaller towns like Orreto, Tar- quinia, Savaria and San Gimignano. The last three weekends I stayed in Florence because there was much to do and see. I had gone from .. 1 have ten weeks to see this and that\ to \Oops - I've only got three weeks left.\ The exchange rate is so different. When We were there, we averaged 872 Lire per dollar and almost no coins were to be had. Many merchants tried giving as- sorted goodies like gum or hard candies as change. At the very beginning, when something would cost 250 Lire, I would tlip out. I'd start the tabulation, wondering how could I ever afford this. Then I'd breathe a sigh of relief, realizing that 250 Lire is about 30¢. Of course, the people need mentioning. The I tal ian girls are very sheltered and consequently most of us met very few girls our age. The rnen were another story. They seemed to hang out, waiting for American girls to Walk by so they could play up their masculinity. Such lines as \Please tell me why all the beautiful girls in the world are American,\ or, \Would you like to make love'!\ were not at all uncommon. At first, it was shocking, but after the initial culture shock wore off, it was easy to say '\r\ ea - sometime next life, buddy!\ For anyone questioning, \Should I go or not'?\ the answer is: GO! Nothing I could say could help you comprehend all the marvelous things that will happen. The term abroad program is the best thing around. It can't be beat. You'll never be able to live in and experience another culture in the same way.

Page 14 . Goodman Featu.red by CHUCK KATZ Union CoUege's Art Gallery will be featuring the work of artist Sidney Goodmall, a \New - Realist,\ starting em February 25, and continuing until April 9. The exhibit will consist of twenty-six drawings, done in water-color, pastel, or charcoaL Mr. Goodman is considered to be a \New Realist\ because of the way he depicts the quality of life in Contemporary America. He shows a great interest in and concern for the Suburbs. Industry also plays a big part in Mr. Goodman's work. In his d~;awings, Sidney Goodman displays a sense of isolation; a feeling of loneliness and alienation. Goodman has participated in many group exhibitions. Among them were, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, \Annual Exhibition,\ in 1974; the Pennsylvania State University Museum of Art, .. Living American Artists and the Figure,\ exhibit in 1974; and the Suffolk Museum, \Realism exhibit in 1971. Mr. Goodman will open up his exhibit with a lecture at 7 o'clock P.M. on Tuesday, February 28, 1978, at the Schenectady Museum, which houses Union's Art Gallery. A reception will follow the lecture at 8:30. Wine and cheese will be served. All are welcome and encouraged to attend (either the lecture; the reception, or both). Goodmtm - Woman in Bed I His works show a vast range of interests and talents: from nudes to horse races or ·landscapes to superhighways. Goodman has taken a strong Classical tradition in art and has updated it to give it a modem content and form. Mr. Goodman places his beautifully rendered realistic figures in surreal settings, with the emphasis on showing the quality of life in modern America. Campaign Aims For Record Sidney Goodman was born in Philadelphia and educated at the Philadelphia College of Art, where he received a B.F.A. in .l95!:t, and is currently teaching. About 100 campaign volunteers and business leaders, representing firms throughout the Capital District, gathered at the Holiday Inn on Nott Terrace; for a kick- off dinner to help raise support for Union College. This year's Annual Business Campaign will try to \set a new record of giving, both in number of companies and in dollar support\ drive chairman Henry E. Whittingham, Jr., told the people attending. Whittingham noted that last year's campaign raised $108,000 and attracted support from 261 area business concerns. \It is a means by which we can, in some measure, recognize the many benefits realized over the years by this community from the college,\ he said. The college's impact on \the social, cultural and intellectual life of our communiW defy measurement,\ Whittingham said. But the measurable economic impact of the college on the surrounding- area is now estimated at over $37 miUion annually, he said. When Union was founded 183 years ago, \the name 'Union' Mr. Goodman has had several one-man <,!Xhibitions, and has participated in many public displays. One-man exhibitions have been held at Terry Dintenfuss, Geo.rge Washington University, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Philadelphia College of Art, and at the University of Rhode Island. Some of Mr: Goodman•s work is on display for the public to view at such places as, the Brooklyn Museum, the Chicago Art Institute., the Museum of Modern Art (New York City), the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., and' various other galleries throughout the country. Grants Available ln addition to these private displays and c<>llections, Mr. by R. LILLIENSTElN Are you interested in the Humanities\? Would a $2500 grant help you get interested'? Here's what it's all about. The National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent Federal grant- making agency created by Congress in 1965 to support projects related to the Humanities, has created a special program called ••y outhgrants in Humanities'' designed to encourage ventures in the Humanities· similar to those ~~ . .,. Goodman - Woman in Shower Stall conducted by more experienced professionals within the Endowment's other programs. Because man's experience has been principally preserved through books, art ·works and other cultural objects, the Humanities are often defined in terms of specific acad~mic disciplines. Thus the humanities include, but are not limited to the following fields: history, philosophy, languages, .literature, linguistics, archeology, jurisprudence, history and criticism of the arts, ethics, comparitive religion, and those aspects of the social sciences employing historical or philosophical approaches. This last cate-gory includes cultural anthropology, sociology, political theory, international relations, and other subjects concerned with questions of value and not with quantitative measures. The National Endowment for the Humanities exists, however, not only - or even primarily - for the support of formal work in these disciplines, but to encourage the . understanding of ideals, values and experiences which have been and will be formative in our culture, and to relate the study of humanities to national concerns. The Youthgrants in the Humanities Program supports humanities projects developed and conducted by young people in their teens and twenties. Proposed projects may include the design or execution of an educational program; humanistic research or study of a specific problem; or even other activities aimed at applying humanistic knowledge or dissemim~ting it through film, exhibitions, public presentation, and other media. Profesor Paul LeClerc, chairman of the Union College Humanities department, considers this a great opportunity for students to expand their horizons in the Humanities. Students interested in this program or who would like more information on Youthgrants are urged to contact Professor LeClerc.,as sGMr'as pos- ~ible either in his office on the second floor of the Humanities building, or by phone at 370- 6~ 13. Final applications are due by April 15, 1978, however, potential applicants should submit preliminary proposals as soon as possible. The general Y outhgrants application and grant process is outlined in a special brochure available upon request. For copies of the Youthgrants' information brochure or other information about the program, write to: Youthgrants in Humanities, Mail Stop 103, National Endowmenis for the Humanities, Washington, D.C. 20506. The majority of Y outhgrants awards for individual projects is under $2500, but grants for group projects may range up to $10,000. Now · are you interested in the Humanities'! Bonner Applauds· Carey Union College President thomas N. 'Bonner, a member of the board of the Associated Colleges and Universities of the State of New York and of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, on February 16 applauded Governor Hugh Carey's support of a compromise bill that would improve the state•s Tuition Assistance Program benefits to students i.n both independent and government-sponsored colleges. Bonner viewed C>tller proposals put forth in the legislature as too heavily favoring. either one or the other of the sectors. The governor's proposal, which would put into effect his commitment to raise the maximum TAP award from $1,500 to $1,800, also provides an increase in the eligibility threshold - the net taxable income ceiling below which a student becomes eligible for the maximum award - from $2,000 to $2,150 by next fall. The governor's proposal also would make all students eligible regardless of which year of college they are in. Other proposals offered to the legislature would have lifted the threshold immediately to $5,000, but would have restricted the benefit to freshmen. Bonner announced his support of the governor's proposal in a speech to , area businessmen at Union's Annual Business Campaign kick-off dinner in S.chenectady. About .100 corporate and bu~iness executives attending the dinner heard Bonner · stress that the independent colleges in New York represent an impor-tant financial resource to the state through the tax savings they represent. Independent colleges derive an average of 7 per cent of their income from state tax revenues, primarily through TAP and \Bundy\ aid. Government- sponsored institutions receive 75 per cent of their income from tax sources, he said. came from the union of comm.unity people who petitioned for the college charter and gave $35;000 to start it on its way,\ Whittingham said. \We are here, 183 years later, with a purpose to continue that community interest in the economic v.iability of Union College '- to help support its purpose of academic excellence.\ \The real key to the success of the Annual Business Campaign,\ Whittingham told his audience ·\is people like you who care and who personally are interested in and appreciate the work of the· college.'' · Arthur F. Casey, a 1952 Union alumnus and member of the campaign's executive committee, noted that the college's Annual Fund Drive reached the $1 million mark last year. \The Annual Bu!liness Campaign ... was a major factor in this success,\ he said. \I know of no other college .in the country w.hich receives · this type of significant support annually from its business community,\ Casey added. Union alumni \are very grateful to you and are proud to count you as members of the Union family,\ he said. \And as such, 1 know lspeakfortheentire union College community when I invite ·you to bring your spouse and children and enjoy the many lectures, plays, art exhibits, concerts and sports events sponsored by · the college and open to the community throughout the year.\ \Union is very much your college, too,\ he said.

Come and cheer the winning women on! The Garnet machine is still rolling along, despite injury after illness after injury. The last three games have been plagued by bad luck, as another player is sidelined tor the rest of the season and · the Russian llu has temporarily struck down several ot the women. 'lhese setbacks may have diminished the si:z.e of the team, but certainly not their spirit, as evidenced by their string ot victories which now has the Dutchwomea with a winning record of 7-6. North Adams was the first victim of the week, and they had all the advantages. First, they were at home and Union had to travel to them, second, they had about twice as many players as Union did. North Adams seemed to know about Union's lack of players and was determined to run U ni@n into the ground with 'only their sickly seven playing. During the game, Sandi Key became very ill with the flu and had to stop playing, bringing Union's number down to six. The points were within two throughout the entire first half, and just as both teams tied with eight minutes left in the game, Dot ~carpinato suffered an injury to her knee, which reduced the Union squad to five. The wmnen managed to rally themselves enough to win the .game for Dot by the slim margin of 57-55.

National contender Bob Moffat by ALLAN MOLHO lhe Union College track team put on a show last weekend for an euthusiastic crowd and the television med·ia as they overwhelmed· Albany State and Middlebury. !he final totals were ~4 points for Union, 64 for Albany, and 5 for Middlebury as they competed with only five runners due to the outbreak of tlu. I hough the flu had its toll on all · tlte teams, Union seemed turned on by the TV cameras which basically came to see All- American Kevin Scheuer and Bob Moffat and the vocal crowd. l-'mtn this, one could clearly see the team put out that peak effort. As a whole; they won ten out of 15 events anq most, if not all, members had excellent individual records. Most notable were the outstanding and consistent effor.ts <>f Kevin Scheuer and Bob Moffat.· Kevin easily won the mile in 4: 14.2 and the 1000 yard in 2:'1 5.6 seconds. Bob was at his typical best as he won the 600 yard (I : 12.5 seconds) and along with Kevin, was part of the winning mill¥ and two-mile relay teams. lo the spectators' surprise, B!lb- also ent~red the 60-yard dash. With the other sprinters starting in the blocks. Bob started standing up and finished first in his heat and fourth overall. emphasizing his ·extraordinary ability. Other excellent performers were Uave Cozzens, first in the high jump (6'S''), Earl Chilton, first in the triple-jump (44'!l\) Jim Zalucki, in the pole vault (12'6\). Pete Vielkind and Matt Guilfoyle as usual finished first in the 880 and 440 yard events with times of 2:00 and 51.9 seconds, respectively. rhough it was sometimes a problem at previous meets. this time there were many outstandi·ng backup per- formances as Union ·finished second or third in W out of 13 events. Some of these perfermances were just as exciting as a first-place result. Examples of this were the efforts of Rob Fischmann in the 600 yard (third), Jack Connor in the two mile (second), and Pete Pettit tinishing sc;:cortd in the !l!!O yard who competed for the first time this year because of an injury. Union now faces tbe latter part of its schedule with an invitational meet at RPl this weekend.

Amherst JUmped to an eal:ly lead, building a commanding 30- 16 dominance. Union could not come back. Union, who played without marksman Ureg Sobocinski (out with the flu) and center K.R. Marshall, could not muster a potent enough ollcnsc as Amherst swept the boards clean. I o make matters worse, Union . sullered a poor shooting night, connecting on just 22 shots in 63 attempts. Amherst, on the other hand, hit 25 out of 47. L'aptain Mike Smith led the Dutchmen, scoring 20 points. f-ollowing Smith was freshman sensation Joe l'atdany who added 15 points to the attack.

Against RPI last Wednesday, Union was missing its pointgetter to date, Doug Richardson, who was out with the ilu, along with King and Wynn. The rest of the team picked up the slack however as Broad brooks, Lowe, Perento and Jakovic started the day with a win in the 400 medley. Union added points with wins by Perento in the 200 butterf1y, Broadbrooks in the 200 backstroke, and co-captain Jim Lowe in the 200 breaststroke. With only the 400 freestyle relay to go with the score ~ven at 52-52, RP.I was victorious and left Union's record at 2-5. On Saturday versus Michaels College the Dutchmen, behind a strong team effort which saw nine different swimmers earn first place honors, won 65-47. Richardson was back .at it again, winning the 2~0 freestyle over second-place finisher Andy Berquist. Broadbrooks won hts backstroke event, and Lowe won his second straight breaststroke decision.
