Robbed in their patrimony by political changes, they are forced to peddle matches in the streets of Paris.

She is brought to his gar- ret in Montmartr·e, where in the best moral tradition of the time, they are married. \Georgiana thinking she has lost her sister, becomes chambermaid to la comtesse de Ruedecentre, and is led by her into the life of a \light lady.\ She becomes finally a member of the vicious cou~·t at Versailles, after the Cin de:~·ellla theme has entered the story In the person of the comtesse's elderly, ugly daughter who is jealous of the girl. \The reunion of the two sisters is accomplished by an aged ..Abbe who discovers Emmeline while vis- iting the sick ladies of his parish.

The men, chosen from the junior class in the division of Social Studies are: H. Laurence ..Achilles, Jr., Henry D. Hartmann, Charles H. House, Jr., Henry M. Seider, Paul Goldberg, and Melvin Muroff. On Monday December 7, at 8:00 p. m. in the Old Chapel there will be held the first of a series of lec- tures to be sponsored by the club. The speaker will be Ml', Frank Manheim instructor in history, who will 'talk on \Amos Dean, His· torian of Civilization.\ Amos Dean, who graduated from Union in 1826, was a founder of Al- bany Law Scl:iool and of Dudley Observatory, as well as professor in the Albany Medical School, first chancellor of the University of Iowa, and a lawyer and historian of note. The lecture will be open to the public. The Social Studies Club was organized in the fall of 1924 wi_th the authorization of the SoCial Studies division, and is intended to serve as an honorary society for the division. Its purpose is to pro- vide an opportunity for the inter- change of knowledge between the fields of the division. The primary requisites for election into the club are scholastic standing and intel- lectual capacity. The faculty, al- though not included in the :mem- bership, often attend meetings and participate in discussions. Dr. Earl E. Cummins is the club's faculty adviser, Comntunity to Be Co .. Sponsor of Drama Festival Committee of City Chamber Of Commerce Meets to Start Underwriting Fund Shares at $25 Campaig·n for $1:i,OOO Mini- mum to Finance Project Begun Last Night SCHENECTADY, N. Y., Nov. 30. -The Mohawk Drama Festival whose artistic achievement has been reported in every cmner of the United States and Canada by near·ly every newspaper since it wa::; established by Union College two years ago, today became a community enterprise of the en- tire city of Schenectady. The sharing of responsibility for the ~ucces::; and permanence of the drama festival with. Union College is being accomplished by the organization of an underwrit- ing fund, in units of $25 shares, of at least $15,000 . The campaign for the under·- writing fund is being conducted by a Chamber of Commerce commit- tee of which Carl W. Snyder, dis- tl·ict manager of the New York Telephone Company, is chairman. Last night the committee met in Hale House for dinner and made Its plans after hearing favorable reports from Mr. Snyder, Presi- dent Dixon Ryan Fox of Union College, Lawrence G. Magner·, vice president and treasurer of the Schenectady Trust Company and president of the Chamber of Com- merce, John G. Barry, honorary vice president of the General Elec- tric Company under whose admin- istration as president the Cham- ber of Commerce assumed active lntere::;t in the drama festival, and Mr. Charles D. Coburn, director of the festival, who came fl'Om New York to attend the dinner. $5000 Already Underwritten The campaign got off to a fly- ing start with $5,000 worth of un- derwriting shares subscribed by the members of the· general com- mittee. It is expected that an addi- tional $1(),000 will be underwritten within the next ten days. Mr. Magner, who with President Fox, Mr. Snyder, Mills Ten Eyck, and Samuel L. Whitestone, will be trustees of the underwriting spon- ~ors, made it clear that he and his associates would do everything possible to keep the Mohawk Drama Festival accounts on a strictly business like basis so that it balances its budget without any ct·eficit, and thus avoid calling upon the underwriter's to share in any loss. He said that the Chamber of Commerce recognized in the Mo- hawk Drama Festival not only a great cultural asset to the Clity, but \cold bloodedly, a great means for financial gain to the merchants of the city.\ ----o---- Red Cross Dl'ive Nets Over Set Goal ()f $250 Union College achieved its goal in the annual Red Cross member- ship drive with a collection of $264.24, a little over the goal of $250 set for the college thJs year. All but two of the frater·nities contributed to the Red Cross. In addition, this year the dormitory sections were solicited and all are represented in. the final total. The Faculty and staff contrib- uted a total of $141.75, the frater- nities $88.47, the dormitory sec- tions $15.33, while $18.69 was col- lected from non-resident neutrals in daJily assembly. The 19'36 drive resulted in an increase of $47.03 ovet· the 1935 roll call whose goal was only $200. This increase of 21.69% over last year was attributed to the Increas- ing social consciousness of stu- dents, and to the \prompt cooper- ation of the roll call workers,\ by Mr. Milton M. Enzer, solicitor for Union College. He was assisted by Henry M. Stephenson '38, chair- man of the stud·mt roll call workers. ---01--- The Two Orphans: 40-Girls-40. -advertisement Mr. Atwood first gave a thor- ough outNne of the organization of Standard Oil Company.

N()tt Delivers Address While Ceiling of Third Floor Goes t() Pot Fr·iday, Nov. 27.-The final disin- tegration of South Section South College began this morning as a picked squad of some 3,000 termite.: undermined the ceiling of the third floor lavatory. The first debris fell at 4:04 a. m. this morning. The work of laying bare two square feet of lathe was completed in the record time of ten minutes. The Concordiensis was informed that at exactly the same time Comptrollet· Anthony DeH. Hoad ley and Grounds Superintendent Samuel Johnson turned over in their sleep and muttered uneasily. The occurence at the time, how- ever, was attributed to indigestion. Impressive ceremonies were held later in the morning to· dedicate the ruins. Attended by many of the distinguished shades of Union alumni, the exercises were opened with a prayer by Eliphalet Nott D.D. Using as his text the Biblical verse, \From dust you came and to dust you shall return,\ Dr. Nott stated that the \coming ruin of thif section of our beloved dormitories is a gl01 ious example of the truth of the word of the Lord as revealed to man. \As a former re:oident of South College, for some time removed from its cheer·ful precincts, I will be especially please<;~ to visit its ghostly halls in the future. I trust that the present Administi ation will be so kind as to allow an old man this little caprice.\ Corporeal residents of the Sec- tion, however, were not entirely pleased. Combined with the recent backing up of the fourth floor drains, this renders two of the three showers in the building use- less. Resigned to their fate, they said to reporters, \What's the use. It's getting too cold for showers any- how.\ ----0---- Rtudents Injured in Auto Accidents Are Improving The two Union freshmen, Rob- ert E.

T'his action elicited only feeble response from Prague and Belgrade in conjunction with France, while London expressed regret.

Tt:e first thing which comes to mind is that two of the most powerful nations in the world are quaking in the face of propaganda, especially when those two nations have the strongest military govern- ments in. the world. The whole universe hears Adolph Hitler say that his people are ninety per cent behind him, that his government !:as become solidly unified in the face of world disapproval, that the 1ebirth of the German people has talten place, that he has a perfect censotship, and that he has a great police force. Now just why is Hit- ler so concerned about propa- gandists in Moscow? Why does this airtight nation suddenly cry out in fear of internal strife?

Perhaps Japan would like China to place her armies in Japanese hands to fight Russia's influence in North China. This would, of course, leave Japan free in China. And perhaps Germany would like to co-ope1·ate with Poland or Bul- garia in tatting a very fertile piece of the Ukraine.

There were, to om· lmowl- edg-e, a few, all of whom belonged to frater- nities, and were wm·king- for their own selfish interests. But it takes more than a handful of pal'tially interested souls to sell the idea of Union. Everyone has to appear to be more than mildly enthusiastic in thoeir mental g-y1·ations, lauding incidents, tradi- tions, persons that we associate with the college. What this college needs, perhaps more than anything else, is to have its ego en- flated several pounds so that we will feel there is more mom in which to expand. It is a virile idea to have plenty of self-respeet, and that is a characteristic we must inculcate more strong-ly in our college. L'nion has many just rights to be proud of itself. One M the oldest institutions in the land, its traditions and atmosphere are inextricably associated with the past, while, at the same time, her policy is always for- ward moving and liberal. Unique is the fact that our buildings gather around them the memories of their antiquity, the lore of their early inhabitants. Not many American uni- versities can point to their halls with the same attitude of mind that we can, for many of ours are steeped in the glory of the past. North College and South College dormitories are products of the aftermath of the War of 1812. The Library recalls the pranks and tomfoolery of tho8e who first used it in the Civil War period. Old Gymn Dorm ev;en antedates this in its origin, in fact it was the first building of its kind erected in this country foT the sole purpose of offering pro- tection and providing opportunity to incli- viduals in pmsuit of physical culture. Customarily co-lleges replace their old build- ings with more luxurious and grand new ones, but our policy has been to rehabilitate what we have first and theu afterwards one should not get Ollt and do hiS pm't.

One couple after another (Contbmea on Pag-e ') CINEMA By JOHN B. DOWLING The moving pictures having been ratht>r indifferent this Thanksgiv- mg holiday other cinematic matters :tre more noteworthy. Sunday's New fork Times carried two articles on different aspects of the moving pic- turfs and each in its own way, while repeating things that have often been said, is a fresh, timely examination. Samuel Goldwyn writing an article for the magazine section re- plies to the charge that the motion picture producers pander to the lowest tastes of the people and never enlarge their horizon with honest, realistic stories of life as it is. He lays the blame for this condi- tion on the audiences themselves saying that if audiences did not go to the bad pictures they would ::ease to be produced. This repeats the plaint. as old as the industry that with large sums of money be- ing put into films producers can- not afford to gamble. Goldwyn says that they must attempt to please a worldwide audience whose reactions can only be gauged by what they have rejected in the past and that any progress which is to be made must be gradual and the element of risk offset as much as possible by employing good taste. Deploring conditions which have resulted in double feature bills, Bank Nights and the like, Goldwyn predicts that within a year audi- ences will have rebelled to the point where exhibitors will find It to theit· best interests to present only one good feature and that this will relieve pressure upon pro- ducers and enable them to be more careful with their product. The article touches upqn censorship, writing and other phases. It is an absm·bing document representing the opinion of the man who pro duces the consistently best films in America. The other article appears in the motion plcttire section of the Times and is by Janet Graves. BeiJ:lg con- cerned with the more specific problem of writing it is of interest to the layman who often wonders just what a reviewer means when he says that a film was well writ- ten. Lucidly non-technical the article using examples from well known pictures repeats the belief held by the best directors that the burden of any picture is best carried by the physical motion on the screen and that sound should be employed only to give the story subtlety and point Such a picture was Tlte lnformet where dialogue was kept to its most effective minimum.

Ken Brown, while not possessing so deadly an eye, is coming along fast, i·s an improved player over last year, and will make a. good running mate for Teddy. Smi tb., although ineligible for away g-aines, is rated with Teddy dn scoril1g ability, and his height will be a great asset to the team which will average about six feet. Shultz is a wonderful guard and plays a hu d, aggressive game .on the of.fensiv.e as well as the defens~ve.

So far this year, 313 students have talten part in five events as compared to a total participation of 534 men last year in the complete list of activi- ties. The intra-mural program has proven of value in fostering worth- while competition among the groups in the college. It has given other fellows, besides the varsity athletes, a chance to obtain bene- fit from sports. \The intra-murals,\ said Mr. Lawrence, \give the fel- lows who are not physically equipped for varsity sports a chance to develop an interest in athletics and to obtain the valu- able exercise it affords and it also gives then a chance to make val- uable contacts.\ The five events held so far this year are: Touch-football, fall ten- nis, the football field meet, and la- crosse and swimming. Great inter- est was shown in all of these by the students and total par- ticipation this year should surpass that of previous years according to Mr. Lawrence. Having weeded out and d·is- posed of a great number of en- thusia.sts from his frosh basket- ball squad, Coach Nitchman is now working out with fifteen men among whom he thinks. will ()ODie a team equal to that of '34, when Podbielski, Smith, Smith, Shultz, Shultz, Doyle, etc. set a new high for fre·shman basketball and shat- tered a lot of records in their short season. At present of course, there is no idea as to which men will compose the five, but there ~re plenty of capable players who al- ready have shown enough ability to warrant recognition.

He plan£ to keep ten or eleven men which will face one of the most interesting sched- ules the freshmen have had. They will pla.y six g-ames, two more than last year, and will take several trips.

Graves Honora1·y Fellow Describes University Education in Past ,Centuries Students Very Free •Even Could Fine Professors Who Tried to Lecture With Great Haste ln his first official appear- ance as honorary fellow in education last night, Dr. Frank Pierrepont Graves, president of New York University, drew a colorful picture of college and univ.ersity life in Europe when education was in its in- fancy in the third Spencer Lecture of the year. \The University in those days,\ he said, was a corporation. It is hard to tell what the University is today. The modern meaning of the word is a sort of college of colleges, although this was not the original meaning. The earliest university was Bo- logna. established in 1158 with a charter from Frederick Barbarossa. It represented 17 nations from the Italian side of the Alps and 18 from the ·Other side, At the University of Paris. established several years later, four nations were repre- sented. The head of each nation was called a procurator or proctor. He represented the nation and guarded and controlled it to some extent. Early Resoo.rch Labs Witl!. the renaissance there came in the humanistic education and the formation of new universities like Frankfort and Wittenburg. The 17th century brought realism and the use of laboratories with experiments on plants and animals. A great movement toward the end of that century was the develop- ment of independent research which has taken the form of the modern graduate schooL Two types of work characterized the lJnivel'sity in early times, said Dr. Graves. There 'were the lec- tures, in which the manuscripts were often dictated to the students, and the debates, which formed the only type of \laboratory work,\ in which the students were expected to show what they had learned. Students Employed Profs In these universities, the students were supreme, They employed the professors, determined their salar- ies, and even fined them if they lectured too fast to be followed, Dr. Grave·s remarked. \The life of the student was very free,\ he said. \It was important for the king, for those persons who had t<> charter the university, to see that the stu- dent got all he wanted, because he was likely to pick up his professors and go to some other town.\ This suspension of lectures, called ces- satio, often led to unruliness among the students and frequent town- gown rows, and usually_ the stu- dents' side was favored by the law. During the entire medieval period the students were under the protec- tion of the monarch, and were judged in the university courts. Addresses Student Body \This whole matter of college life concerns itself with the preparation for the future and with active liv- ing at the prese-nt time,\ Dr. Frank P. Graves said this morning in dally assembly. \This brings into question three fundamental points: food, or maintenance of life; sex, or the perpetuation of life.; and reli- gion, or meaning of life. The first two we share with the animal king- dom. \There never was any group of people that did not have some form of religion, the one characteristic that the human race· alone pos- sesses, and that differentiates it from animals. As far as we know, there :has been no evidence to show that a.n animal has a view of God, unless, as· some :people ·be1ieve, it be in the form of a huge dog Ol' horse. UNION COL.1EGE, SCHENECTADY, N.Y., FRIDAY, DECEMBER. ·l, 1936 Clowe Shows Himself, Advises Rest, Retires Wednesday, Dec. 3.-In one of his infrequent public appear- ances, Dr. 'G.

Miss Travis said that 62 per cent of the college men are doing some- thing to defray their expenses and that through the employment bu- reau and the cooperation of the city of Schenectady, an average of four jobs a day have been provided. \This marks an increase over the number which was provided last year,\ she stated, \and the student workers are getting better types of jobs.\ Miss Travis, who has been direct- ing the employment bureau since 1934, also organized the Odd Job department three years ago. She ex- plained in her report that the odd job department has been averaging four jobs daily since the start of college this fall. Miss Travis said that this was the most interesting part of her work, because the stu- dents were often called upon to do ludicrous things. NEWS AND V JEWS-Special Courses O'< D'\'\\ ~'ii\N Fox.

In a petition addressed to Fred- erick A. Wyatt, proctor• of South CoUege, they maintained that the college has done little to insure the comfort of the occupants of South Section rooms, and that it has for years broken promises to remedy conditions. Their petition, listing 11 outstanding grievances, was signed by all of the 15 stu- dents living in the section and in the RQ{)ltery over the Ellery House. Cali College \Lucky\ \It is lucky for the college that it doesn't seem to be subject to tenement inspection,\ one student said in commenting on the situa- tion. The petition itself was couched in quite definite terms, and asked immediate repairs. \It is our intent to have some conditions 1·emedied befot·e the present seniors living hel\e end their terms in college,\ it said. \The state of affairs has been made rather obvious by the 1ecent flooding of the bath-rooms and by defects in the lighting system, and by the gradual decomposition of a living place that has not been renovated since the year of the Great Blizzard.\ No I<::nc()uragement to Stay \The college has m<..de e:xterior decoration~ in South College Couriyard, which may be an effort to attract people to the campus. But nothing has been done to en- courage them to stay there. ..... In conclusion, we ask to re- mind you that although the col- lege, in the room-contracts, ex- tracts many guarantees and im- poses many rules, it has d<>ne lit- tle to make our lot in this section very comfortable.\ The list of grievances asked, first of all, l'enovation of the lavatory facilities, \so that we may a.t least be clean, if not comfortable!' It asked that floors, both in the rooms and hail-ways be relaid, and that suitable doors be installed where needed. It also pointed out the fact that several ceilings were in bad condition, and that there are no closets in almost half of the rooms.

I>ean FAIR EXCHANGE The Mountebanks have, during the past week, promised us one of the dramatic events of the season in the soming tonight of Omnibus. Omnibus, in case you didn't know, is the Skidmore dramatic association. And sinee it seems to be conventional to vvelcume a 11ylhing that is or appe1·tains to Skidmore, we are writing this editorial. The idea of aiL exchange of plays between the two colleges is a good one, since it is impos- sible for the schools to collaborate on the :same pla,Y::i. It gives rise to reflections on whether o1· not The Concordiensis and the Skidmore News should exchange editorial boards, or if athletic teams fl·om the two in- stitutions should compete. It would all be welcomed from Union's side. However, these are editorial vapol'ings even more idle than usual. We hasten to close by saying that although we don't ex- actly see h.ow all forty of the promised cast are going to fit on the Mountebanks stage, we are expecting a good time.

WE LIKE WORKING FOR WOMEN To Miss Frances Travis, director of the student employment bureau, the sixty-two pel' cent of the Student Body which is en- abled by her competent directions to support itself partially or wholly, extends a unan- imous vote of thanks. Since 1934 when Miss Travis began her present work she has devoted much time and effort in increasing and maintaining- the rep- utation of her organization to the point where she is now able to tell with too much modesty of the large percent of approxi- mately eight hundred students who are alJle to \do something to defray their expenses.\ With complete charge of the National Youth Administratio11, she has had the initiative to establish the odd job department, and to build it up to its present status. Because of her competence, her ambition, her sympathetic interest in the \sixty-two per cent,\ we wish her to know that her work is sincerely appreciated. THE COUNCIL GETS A JOB It is cause fo1· general rejoiein.g that the Terrace Council, so long shorn of any great significance, finally has a job of work to do. (Jeillng Zero, by Frank Wead.: Pnsented by the Schenectady Civic: Players under the direction of. Mabel Hearon Hodgkins, December 2nd through 5th. Trite as it may be to say, the purpose of drama is to give the audience a dramatic thd'ill. The best test of a play is the amount of response it evokes in an audi- ence. Judged by this standard, the Civic Players' production of Ceil-· ing Zero is an unqualified success. It had the audience on the edge: of their seats a good p-ortion o:f the time, which is enough to make any play a success. Ceiling Zero is, of course, a pow- er:ful play. Written by a man who combines ability as a playwright with expert lmowledge of his sub- ject matter, it possesses realism and strong dramatic power. Espe- cially excellent is the second act, a piece of very good playwriting .. , The cleverly-Wiought suspense leading up to the tragic crash which ends the act 'is a masterpiece I of writing. Except for a great deal of fal- tering with lines, the Civic Play-1 ers' performance was excellent for I an amateur group. In fact, th.e leading actors proved themselves good by putting over their parts with thoroughness despite forgot- ten lines. None of the perform- ances were faultless except those of a few minor characters. Hmv- evei', in the leading roles Thomas Poole and Lester Van Der Werf gave strong, sympathetic perform- ances although they marred them considerably by forgetting lines.' 'rhe work of two of the minor characters, Robert Wllllains and Fred McChesney was the most thorough and best done of all. '!'hey played their roles i.n a most competent, yet unobtrusive man- uel', which most amateurs in small parts might do well to copy. THA.

That the grand opera b-rought to Albany by the San Carlo Com- pany was a much appreciated treat to the theatre-goers of the hinterland was evidenced by the· frequent and enthusiastic applause which greeted the presentation of, Cavellerla Rustlcana and Paglhwci: last evening.

Thanks to Nels Much ·of this rise :in basketball C()nsciousness and the effective· combinations that have represented the college recently can be traced to the untiring efforts of Head Coach Nelson Nitchman. \Nels\ to everyone, he has lifted Union quin- tets into the limelight where other coaches would have produced an average team. At the present writing we have no idea as to how the '36-'37 court- men are going to make out in mat- ter of number of games won or lost. We aren't particularly interested in guessing as to the possible outcome of the season. What we are inter- ested in, however, is the fact that past records and future expecta- tions are such that Union can af- ford to be classed as capable corn- petition for the imposing array of teams on the coming schedule~ Major 'l'eams V\linning or losing we can be sure that this year's five will be fighting until the final whistle-a better team may beat them but it won't: be because of lack of effort or en- thusiasm, Colgate, St. Lawrenee, Dartmouth, Columbia, C. C. N. Y., and Buffalo are tearns that prac- tically any college would be happy to meet. Placed on one schedule- they form an .imposing menace to the number of victories that the Garnet may ring up, but their pres- ence alone offers proof enough that Union has advanced beyond the stage of just fair teams and has reached a point where they can meet leading fives in the East and make a creditable showing, some- times proving more than a match · for their \big league\ opponents. In preparation for the coming contests the varsity \ten\ has been placed through a strenuous period of conditioning and practice scrim- mages both among themselves and· with the freshmen. According to the positions the boys have been assuming in these practice sessions it seems fairly certain that the starting five will be composed of just who everyone thi.nks it will be.

One of the outstanding players at Mid- dlebury, Nelson will take over the reins o-:f lee leadership in the place of Art Lawrence who coached the team 'last year. Duke b.ru a very promising out- look for the coming season with a squad of 19 players with which to work. He has been holding the first practises at Central Parlr un- til the rink on Cbuneil Field is completed. A great pessimist as to the abilities of the team, Duke has been working his charges at top speed in an effort to weed out the squad and whip the remainder into top notch condition by the time .o:f the opening game with the Massachusetts on Jan. 6. No ·Scrimrnag·es Duke was adamant when ques- tioned concerning the first scrim- mage ... No, sir,\ he ejaculated, \no scrimmages until the fellows can handle .the stick and know the differenc~ between ragging the puck and a swing song.\ Nelson has been ·stressing fundamentals entirely- .but specially emphazing stick handling. He has been drill- ing them in offense and defense, using two men in each department Not much can be ascertained as yet con.cerning the possibilities of the team but it is shaping up fairly well and should have a good season. Fencing News \'l'he fencing team has al- ready scheduled five meets for the coming season, and two additional matches with Wil- liams College are pending,\ Captain James Righter stated yesterday. Tlte first match is with Nm- wich, March 6. There is a re- turn match with Norwich, two with M. I. T., and one with Hamilton. Union will 'be represented by four men in the foils, three in the sabre, and three in the epee.

He is needed to tal1e down the mistalres of the fresh hoop- sters as Nehwn Nitchman, court mentor, barks them off. The man- agers are hard pressed nowadays to keep up with Nels as he fol- lows the actions of each player during the daily scrimmages and points out individual mistakes.

In the past several years we would have stopped at basketball, but the1·e is a definite suspicion in this precinct that the Duke of Nelson will de> the same thing with hockey that Nels Nitchman has done with basl{et- ball. However, before the curtain is completely drawn on the grid- iron, and the heroes of the hard court and the frozen surface are thrust into full view there are sev- eral points which would bear men- tion. Football is changing with the pass·ing of each autumnal Satur- day afternoon, the changes are numerous and some of them not so noticeable. There is one change, nevei'theless, -not yet made which most certainly must be effected before next September draws around. The .past campaign was a gloriously successful one in every way. But it did have one regret- table .feature. That was the acri- mony aroused concerning the rule With the opening game over a month away, Coach Art Lawrence has been dril'ling the aspirants to the year-ling squad strictly on the fundamentals of the ice spmt Par- ticular emphasis has been placed· on conditioning. The fro~h may be seen daily on the boa1·d hack on Council Field gett-ing into ,;hape for the ardours of this hardy winter activit:,•. 'The fundamentals of passing, shooting, and skating wHI be stress- ed with particular emphasis placed on the latter. The skating abilities of the frosh at'e on the whole good ·but they need plenty of practice. Actual practice on ice has been limited so far, the group having been only once on Collins' Lal1e in Scotia. In the future they will probably use thi:s lake, Central Park, and the rink at the Mohawk Golf Club. Board talks twice a week in which fundamentals and positions and elementaz-y plays are discussed, al::;o comprise an important part of tht' p1 e-ga me training.

Army-Navy, Princeton-Dartmouth, and last year's game between Notre Dame and Army were all decided by an official acting on this ruling. It isn't right to lose a wel1 played game on such a snap judgment. Now it is p1·etty well agreed that the present wording of the rule is just about as clear as possible, therefore a change must be made. Two sensible sug- gestions have been put forward. John Kiernan of the New York Times is for letting the players battle for the ball freel:y without a cumbersome ruling. However it seems to me that the l'ule pre- sented by Tom Thorp, the well known official, is the more practi- cal of the two. He would have a standard fifteen yard penalty for interference. Under the first sug- gestion ther·e would be too much temptation for the defending backs to play the man rather than the ba:ll. The receivers would have to concentrate on catching the pass and would literally be at the mercy of the defense. Since the present trend is to encourage th.e offense, the Thorp rule would ·be the m01·e practical, that they know the game fairly ~-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ well and with time should improve and secure positions on the team. Bill Nugent, Bob King, Floyd Dec- kro, L. Hallenbeck, Ted Robinson, Bob Furman, and Dave Light have also shown up well. As to those changes which are coming about, there is for instance the passing of the bon'e-crushing fullback. Fullback has fallen to a place where its only mention is the FB at the bottom of the line- up in the Sunday sport•s section. Those human plows who backed up the line with beserk: abandon and plunged center for that need- ed yard are fast losing their im- portance. Army on Saturday didn't call forth a Murrell, a Joe Stancock, or a John Kilday when they needed a yard on fourth down on Navy's 4.

John S. Krull and Samuel Hammerstrom of the fre::;hman class were elected to the Student Council at a meet- ing held in Washburn Hall tonight. In the longest meeting o·f the year the council also voted to set up a Student Scout fur the puipu;;e of judging offenders uf the fresh- man rules. The penalties which might be used were definitely set to clear up the confusion which was in a large part the cau::;p of the recent attaclt on a number of freshmen by a band uf houdt>d . Sophomores. Krull, who is the b1·other of Charles M. K1 ull '38, comes from Stony Brook School, Long Island, and was a lineman on the fresh- man football team. He is a pll'dge to Beta Theta PL Hammerstrom, who is from Jamestown, was cap- tain and quarterback on the F1 esh- man football team. He is. pll'dged to Lambda Chi Alpha.

There is altogether too much dialogue and not enough action, What dialogue there is, has a few good gags, makes no at- tempt at setting character and lies heavily in the hands of the major actors. As usual the support peo- ple, Helen Broderick, Eri<: Blol\e and Erik Rhodes, are superior to the featured players. Ken Murray and Oswald, The Dixieland Band, and Sue Ryan make for enjoyable vaudeville tllis week. Murray works with the band In an informa:l act that is not wr>w entertainment, but funny enough to keep the audience warm. I am no judge of swing music, but the fellows in the Dixieland Band seem to have lost their fire, fOI' they are, after all, getting on in years. If you remember Benny Davis and his semi-pro revue last year you will recall Sue Ryan who sings travesties on torch singers and the like. She is back in her own act and better than ever.

Frank Bailey, foe the past 35 years treasuret· of Union College, will be the guest of honor at the annual banquet Thursday night of the New York Alumni Association at the Hotel Astor. The man who has seen Union through the most difficult period of her financial history into an era of bal- anced budgets will be the 1·ecipient of tl·ibutes from the Ad- ministration, the alumni, and from feiends of the colleg-e. ----·--------~ Speakers Thursday at the ban- Honored by Alumni FRANK BAILEY Everest Lists Bids On Cooperative Buying In a letter sent to all fraternity treasurers this morning the Stu- dent Council Committee of House Stewards, headed by Robert D. Everest '37, which was appointed to investigate the possibility of establishing a cooperative buying organization at Union, listed a number of bids received by the committee from merchants in the Schenectady area and elsewhere, for the consideration of the various houses. The bids, sent in response to the committee's requests for price lists, show price reductions of from five to twenty per cent. All houses seriously interested in the cooperative experiment are urged to have a representative at the next meeting of fraternity stew- quet table at which Dr. Bailey made his first official statement in 1901 will be Dr. Charles N. Wald- ron, Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox and Louis J. Horwitz, chairman of the Thompson-Starrett Construction Co., who founded the Thompsen- Starrett Foundation courses in building construction at Union, M. I. T., Yale and Carnegie Tech. In~reases Budget Ten Times Graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1885 after working his way through college, Dr. Bailey entered the stock rnar·ket, and in 1902 was made tt,easurer of the college. Since that time the college has run entirely within its budget. During his admniistration, he has increased the annual budget ten times and the endowment by the same proportion. He has himself made gifts unofficially estimated at $500,000 to the college. Since he became treasurer, the physical plant has bee nexpanded by nine new buildings, including Bailey Hall, the Memorial Chapel, Hale House, the Butterfield Laboratories and Silliman Hall, and all of the old buildings have been renovated. Dr. Charles N. Waldron, secre- tary of the college, for many years a close friend of Dr. Bailey's, pays tribute to him in the latest number vf the Alumni Monthly. He says, in pa.1t: \Thirty-five years of balanced budgets was a discipline Union College needed, and it stands high in th.e services our treasurer has rendered. We hope it has become a binding tradition, for the la.ck of this so1\t of financial sanity had had mo-re to do with our decline than had any other one cause. \Dean cried out for a 'Culturge- 1dent of the Scottish Classical As- Acute Cl()lldi'tions in South morning service.

Yes, a coffin. Laid in the coffin is a corpse, and the corpse moves. The cC>llege isn't starting a course in embalm- ing; it's Dr. Everett W. Thatcher's apparatus for controlling the flow of electrons. accurate measurement smaller currents. of much best equipment in the best condi- tion we have ever had, and an en- dowment with a market value greater than its book value. Every vacuum tube has two ele- ments-an emitter of electrons and a receiver. Between these, most modern tubes have a grid or a ser- ies of grids. The grid is nothing more than a charged wire which either attracts of repels the nega- tively charged electrons. When an electron strikes the re- ceiver, it doesn't set up too much of a racket. Even when one hun- dred thousand trillion electrons strike it every second, it doesn't create enough stir for anyone to know the difference, but when the noise is amplified one million times, as it is by Dr. Thatcher, it sounds lil'e \rain on a tin roof.\ Engineers in the past have met a great difficulty in measuring very small currents. When they want to measure minute fractions of am- peres, they run Into fluctuations in the flow of the electrons which throw out their calculations. Dr. Thatcher, by the introduction of variously arranged series of grids and by experimentation un- der different conditions, has cut down these fluctuations approxi- mately 80 per cent, making possible His apparatus in the Physics Lab- oratory is protected from external forces to the nth degree. A thun- der storm could be raging outside and the building could be rocking from an earthquake without creat- ing any effect on the instruments. Each disturbance is reckoned with by Dr. Thatchet·. A wire cage which surrounds the main amplifier iso- lates the machine from electrical disturbances. Outside the cage ls a long angu- lar box, the \coffin in which are housed galvanometers sensitive to ·one millionth of a volt. The \corpse\ by an intricate system of lights and mirrors, records the fluctuations of currents on a graph. The \coffin\ with its moving spot of light give~ an eerie atmosphere. Dr. Thatcher Is a graduate of Oberlin College from which Charles M. Hall, inventor of the electrolytic method of aluminum production was also graduated. He received his doctorate de- gree at Michigan. His apparatus has grown in the last two years to an outstanding position in the sci- entific world. Dr. Thatcher's work has been rec- ognized by grants from Sigma Xi, the national honorary scientific fraternity, and the Radio Corpora- tion of America, which constructed and donated many of his tubes. \We would not minimize the achievements of presidents and faculty through these thirty-five years, but it is simply the truth to say that, without Ml\. Bailey their work would have been great- ly limited. His has been the out- standing accomplishment at Union College in our generation. Frank Bailey is, indeed, our first citizen.\ \Thirty-five years ago-to be ex- act, November 23, 1901,-the for- tunes of Union College took a def- inite turn upward. On that day the trustees of tJnlon College appointed a new treasurer. Their choice was Frank Bailey of the class of 1885. \The story of the progress the college has made from that day to this is inseparably linked with his name. The task was that of physi- cal rehabilitation. Everything else depended on this; and the times themselves magnified its impor- tance, since it was the period dur- ing which material equipment played a rapidly increasing role in education. \It was well Mr. Bailey was a young man and for his own sake, we hope, Ignorant of the folly, neglect and crazy patchwork methods which had made up our financial history for the preced- (Continued on Page 4)

Tue:oday, December 8, 1936 OU!R GREAT BENEFACTOR Not many students in college have spoken to this man, perhaps as few have seen him, but this is no criterion to judge the loyalty and affection he holds fol' Union. His name is on the lips of every student in the social studies division every day in the week, and it is not unknown to those of other divisions; in fact few at·e the graduates of the past twenty-five years who have not heard of him. And yet the affixations of titles, inton- ing his prominence, find no place next his name. The stacks of the library are to be opened next week to whosoever cares to retrieve his books. The numerical distribution of the books is somewhat different fmm that which existed before and for that reason the librar- ians will assist in directing searchers to th-e proper book numbers. When the users of the library become familiarized with the loca- tions of sections, they will be left to them- selves to find what they are after, to browse to their hearts' content. While this acti()n was not prompted by anything The Concor- diensis said or did, we feel that the need for it was fairly presented. The many queri€s of students as to why they could not browse in the shelves led us to seek the reason, but ou1· editorials never aroused a rebuttal. However, the students have now what they have b€en asking for, or at least a part of it, and we of \The Union Alumni Monthly\ P. B.-Refreshments will not be served. P. S.

Most coaches take the best of the lot and let the remaining .group spend their time watching the game from the bleachers. This may be all tight in some colleges but in the smaller institutions there is so lit- tle material from which to choose that to so do would reduce the team to such a small gr•oup that the chances for succes13ful partici· pation in the sport would be great-· ly reduced.

Frosh lmpt·oving By Rigid Training Foster Brown, B.ill Nugent, Bob Feldman Pwbable as Defense lVIen With the opening game of the season about a month away, the Vrosh Hockey squad is gradually rounding into shape. Coach Art Lawrence is still concentrating on the fundamentals but aftet· a few practices on the Central Park rink certain of the aspirants to the yearling ice team have shown def- inite that they possess many of the qualities of a promising hockey player. Brown Shows Promise Foster Brown has shown the best promise to date and with Bill Nugent and Bob Feldman will probably compose the defense of the yearling ice team. Gene Fink, Mortimer Heck, and Johnny Cone have displayed good possibilities and might possibly wor•k into a fit·st string line. The goalie posi- tion is a toss-up among L. Hallen- beck, Ted Robinson, and \Cy\ Briggs who have all shown plenty of promise. This lineup is a tenta- tive one and the next few weeks of practice might change the Hst of probable starters considerably. Coach Lawrence is encouraged by the number of freshmen who answered the call for the squad and the results of the first days of practice have shown that the material is good, The schedule is a tough one but with a few more weeks of hard pt·actice the year- lings should be in good form and set to have a fail· season. -o---- ATHLETIC NOTICES Frosh Physical Exam A big factor in his team's offense, Grant wiH be missed greatly in all away contests. .At guard we find Johnny Schultz, a sophomore who was forced to leave the college for a year after he finished his fres llman term. Next to Ted, Johnny llas the best eye on the team, especially on foul shots. But his special forte is the cutting game. TaJcing advan- tage of the sHghtest laxness in his man's guard Johnny exhibits an a)}ility to find opening-s in the de- fense th.at is nothing short of ex- ceptional. It is a beautiful sight to see Ted and Johnny set up plays for one another which culminate either in a set shot at' a pass to Grant under the hoop for a sure lay-up. In the Intramural league games Friday night the Delta Chis de- feated the D. U. five by the score of 22 to 18 in a close hard-fought game. Leforestier starred fot• the winners malting 10 points while Furman and Everest both scored 8 tallies for the losers. The Phi Delta ThetliS defeated the Kappa A:lphas by the overwhelming score of 37 to 12. Biber, Schermerhorn, and Buchanan were outstanding for the Phi Delts making 10, 8, and 8 points respectively.

Although nEw to the squad, George has s·ho>wn an apti- tude that bids fair for' him to be- come another of Nels' top notch proteges. Tall, dark, well muscled, George is not to be trifled with when he has a basketball In his hand.

Nitchman, Freshman Coach, yesterday. \Every fellow out there on the court is working hard, and I haven't been able to singje out those who wHI compose the fresh- man team. I do not think. it fair either to the fellows themselves or to the school to make a deci- sion based on such work. as we have been carrying out so far.\ A practice game will be held with the Mohawk Day School this afternoon. This will be tne first chance Nitchman has had to view the team lined up against outside competition. The outcome of the game will undoubtedly play an im- portant part in Nitchman's choice of the men who will represent the Freshman on the court. \.At the present time,\ said Nitchm.an, \the main faults of the team are: ·inability to ·follow up on shots off the backboard, occa- sional sloppiness in ball handling, and spasmodic weakness in de- fense in the individual player. Up to date, mostly individual work has been carried out. In the future more emphasis will be P'laced on team defense, which has not been stressed at all, and on team work, the mainstay of any successful team. -J. J. S.

Ris New Literary History of Albang Is Publi~hed by Godman Hislop '3() The first litenwy history of Al- bany since A. J. vVeise wrote his ·book on Albany in 1884 has been published this week by Codman Hislop '30, ln~tructor in English and onP of the :\·oungeot members of the Union College faculty. Beau· tifully printed and bound by the Argus Press, of Albany, the boolt has a detailed bibliogz'aphy and in- dex, and a foreword by President Dixon Ryan Fo.x. It is titled \Al- bany- Dutch, English, and Ameri- can.\ Mr. Hislop, who was reappointed to the Union faculty this year and who was for a year secretary to Dr. Charles N. Waldron, wrote his very readabiP history of the oldest .Incorporated city in the original T'llirtl'en Colonies after consider· able research. F.fe is at present at work on a detailed biography of Union's great president, Dr. Ell- phalet Nott. Written in concise literary style, Mr. Hislop's work typifies a new kind of historical writing. As a \local history\ such as has bl'Jen advocated by President Fox fOr many years, the work will be used 'by Albany public schools. Albany Is one of the first municipalities to encourage the teaching of local history in its sc:hools. The boolt, wl!ich was started last November, considers the gt·owth cof Albany from the Mohican settle- m m ts to the present day in 4L3 well illustrated pages. Dr. Fox: i.II his introduction ::.ays: \In his con· densation the author has not sacri- ficed too much of the dramatic and picturesque.

That part of th.e hi'story reveals an increasing In- terest of the city In social welfare, by the building .of hospitals, de- velopment of public health, parlrs,. and reorganizatiorr of the pollc::'e and fire systems. The author describes the effe~t of increased transportation o:n· streets, which led from cobble· stones to macadam and finally to concrete pavements.

South College Residents We I come Improvements Resid~nts of the south section of South College Dormitory express whole-hearted relief that the ad- ministration is to take measures for the immediate repair of the sec- tion. While all hope that the sec- tion may soon be renovated en- tirely, they are grateful for the promised temporary improvement. Following a petition presented last week by the residents of south section to Professor E. S. C. Smith, dormitory proctor, that conditions In the dormitory be improved, Comptroller Anthony Hoadley pro- mised that repairs would be ef- fected during the Christmas recess. Unlike North College Dormitory and the middle section of South College, this part of the dormitory has never been renovated and is in a very dilapidated condition. ·

Ed Ean·y it costs th.e stu.dents to be governed ·seen1s like a poor investment when considered in the light of the Concordiensis poll of Octo- bel'. In this poll only about thirty per cent uf the voters \Vet·e in favor of perpetaating the Student Council. Now if there al\e so few who wish to be governed by this body, and yet a1·e :forced to contribute to its fi- nancing, is it fait- to impose on the majority the will or a well org;anized minority? This 8ituation is what makes dictatorships possi- ble and we eertC:linly do not want to see any- thing of this sort here at Union. Evidently a chang-e of some so1·t is necessary to alter this malignant usurpation of student faith. The underdog \''ill stand trampling on just so long and then he will rise up to deliver his t·ecalcitrant blows. Apparently th.e Student Council is run by a hierat·chy of the senior class, or a joint one of the two UPl'>er classes and it ma,y be this hiera1·chy is comj)osed of only a few persons. The n1.embers of the lower classes perhaps are eHhn· afraid to voice their own opinions, or feel that they are not expected to. Along with these accusations we would like to say that the capabilities of the mem- bers of this hiera1•chy falls below the aver- age of our nor-mal student. That we trust om destiny, at least our destiny while in colleg-e, to men of this typP. shows how suc- cessfully we can be duped. But we do not want to be, and yet we will not defend our own interests. We must be pretty weak, if this condition continues to exist. Let us call for a revision of the Council. George Stroebel '3ii attempted something of this nature, but failed. I I is failure was due to the fact that he had nothing to offer but criticism. We have a plm1 for reorganizing- the personnel of this defunct body which we would like to offer later i11 detail, but at the present Assistants C. ·rahy we will mention but a word. Let us have a It.

Not We must be fair, however, and admit that had Lins remained in · the fray the story might have been different and our boys might have experienced' some difficulty in de- feating the New England five. Lins is probably one of the best .players to ever appear on the Alumni Gym- nasium floor. The entire team-its attack and its offense-was built about this rangy fm·ward. Possibility That Podbielski and Schultz May Play Because of Illness; Union Will Use Middlebury Formulae Once Again There are several 1dnds of tests all varsity football or basketbaH teams go through at one time or another during· a season. For Union College the game here with Colgate Uni- versity tomorrow nig·ht has been fondly captioned The Acid Test. 1 Union eviden,t!y had the alkali test Wednesday night when 1\Iiddlebury consented to act as red litmus paper. Seven Points In When Lins was taken from the game-after about five minutes had been played of the first period-he had sco~ed a total of seven points. His team was trailing ·the Union five by a mere basket and were working efficiently and with some degree of smoothness, Lins left the game and Union proceeded to mon- opolize the ball for practically the remainder of the half, scoring six- teen consecuti-ve points immediately following Lins' departure. The home team ·amassed a total of twenty-two points to Middle- bury's six dm·iog the remainder of the half. Lins was decidedly the sparkplug of the visitors and it is really too bad that he was forced to retire ftom the conflict. Had he remained we possibly would have a much clearer notion of just what Union is going to exhibit against Colgate tomorrow. As it is, Union is-almost literally- going into its first contest, lln tried, its ability un- known. Sextet at Princeton Following in the footsteps of last year's hockey team, Duke Nelson will take his varsity candidates to Princeton University this coming recess to hold practice sessions with teams representing Princeton and Williams. They will be en- camped in the historic college town from December 29 to January 2. During the Princeton leave-of-ab- sence from all festival activities, the Union team will hold an exhibi- tion meet with Cornell at Playland Casino, Rye, N. Y., December 29 at 8:30. This is an entirely new inno- vation in the usual training ses- sions for Union and will go far to- ward giving the fellows more of an opportunity to get acquainted with their skates and the Nelson form- ula for good hockey.

Eve1y membe1' of the team saw action in a g-ame in which the ball was constantly in po::;session of the Ft·eshmen. !Cozlevcar was, without a doubt, the best player on the floor, sinking shots with a slcill that was bPautifu1 -to see. The starting team was composed of Watson and Kozlevcar as forwat·ds, Buchanan as center, and Bt>if:tin and Hanson as guards. Watsort was moved to center before the game had gotten well under way, \Despite tb.e outcome, said Nel- son W. NitchnJan, coach, this game Is no basis on which to judge the team. However, it did sho1v what kind of work the team as a whole needs and what ea<!h player needs. As a group the fellows handle the ball fairly well. Their greatest weakness is in defense play. Many have played zone defense Vlhile in high school and thus do not know how to guard propet·ly. In the fu- ture the greatest stress will be put on bt·eaking from defense to of- fense and from offense to de- fense. A great deal of time will be put on switching. \Watson ICozlevcat•, and Brittin are the best playePs on the team. Watson must work more on his de- fense. Kozlevcar is also wBak on defense, while Bl\ittin needs to brush up on his shooting. Hanson is a scoring threat but must learn how to switch better. :r. :r. s. For Deluxe Ce>aches Call G. A.

'The Com- mittee has also decided to publish a financial statement at the be- ginning of each coll'ege year in bound pamphlet form.

The appoint· ment of Leon Fraser, life truste~ of Union College, to the presidenc:y of the Firs·t National Bank of Nevv Yot·k City was announced yesterda.:y by George F. Balter. chairman of the bank's board. Mr. Fraser became affiliated with the First National Bank in the ca- pacity of vice president on July 1, 1935. His advancement to the pres· idency was not entirely unexpected as it had been. ltnown for some tim.e that Jacl!son E. Reynolds, retiring pre<idt>nt. had bPen desirious of leaving the financial world for a long vacation and more· leisure, and wh<•n M 1·. B~raser accepted the First National a.ppointment it was ex- pected that he would advance ra· pidly. Mr. F.raser, at ·17 will become th.c pt·esident of one of the most im- portant and pi'{)Jbably the most dis· tinguished bank in the country. He was born in Boston and has been at dlfferen t times a teacher, ne\VS· paper reporter, business man, sol- dier, lawyer. and financial diplorna.t. He is a gr-aduate of Columbia Un.i- versity and holds four degrees from it. Before go,ing to the First Na- tional Mr. Fraser was head of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland and he has been credited with playing an im· portant part in drawing up the plans for that intemational ·bank. For House Linen Service PHONE 4--3166 American Coat, Apron Be Laundry Co. 1 03() Barrett St. Trott opened for Wesleyan, up- holding the affirmative, by stating that a gap exists between state and federal jurisdiction. He argued that most low wage earners at·e. women and children in sweatshops unpmtectd by labor unions. This bt eds crime and disease which eco- nom'ic progress demands be cleared up. Fallon presented the argument that the evils will not be removed by a law, because nation-wide ad- ministration would be impossible. Improvement in conditions must be brought about through labor unions. The point of save wages was again emphasized by the second .speaker· for the affirmative: Stone said it would be impossible for in- dividual states to form laws be- cause capitol would shift over to other states. To avoid waste it would be better for one Federal government to· administrate such a law than for firty-eight states. That unsc(oupulous businessmen are fighting against the law was his claim. Graves declared that such a law would disrupt our en tire economic system. He pointed out that en- forcement would be impossible be- cause of different wage scales in different states, the impossibility of determining a standard wage, chiseling, inefficiency in adminis- tt·ation, and because the value of wages would decline through in- creased costs and recovery would be retarded. ----0•--- \Squaring the Circle\ Is at Slddmore Tonig·ht The Mountebanks will close their production of \Squaring the Cit cle\ tonight at Slddmore College in the second part of an exchange of plays between Union and the girlR' college.

It is important, he ex- plained, to get in the right work to begin with because concerns do not shift men around much once they are located in a department. Industry today is looking for quality not quantity in the college graduates it hires, said Mr. Davis. \We hire men because we feel sure there will be a place for them the rest of their lives.\ Formerly men were hi·red just to fulfill a specific job, he explained. \We people in industry employ men, not merely their ideas, per- sonalities, m· appearance,\ Mr. Davis told students in Daily As- sembly this morning. Employing an allustration from calculus, he ex- plained that employers sought in a man an integrated whole-a com- bination of all desirable character- istics.

Sunday, Dec. 13-More than 4,00{. ·students, faculty and townspeople packed the Memorial Chapel at Lhree services today as Union mad, its annual observance of the Chz ist ••as season V~>ith three musica,, _;ervices. The climax: came tonight when almost 1,500 people filled every 3eat and available standing space to join in the fourth annual Carol Sing sponsored by the college and ananged by the College Y. The singing of the old, favorite noels and carols was sent out ovet the city of Schenectady by means of an amplifying system mounted in Silliman Hall, and many more people gathered outside the can- dle-lit windows of the Chapel to hear the singing. The regular Sunday morning service was turned over, as has been the custom, to Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh and the choir. With no preachez·, the student singers gave a program of many of U:e oldez· cards and some more ambitious Christmas music. This part of the day's pt·ogram is reviewed on page two of today's Concordiensis. In the afternoon, the choir again assi·sted Dr. Tidmarsh at the reg- ular organ z·ecital, and formed the nucleus of the Carol Sing tonight. T'he Choir was entertained at a buffet supper tonight by Pl'esi- dent and Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox. Dr. Fox spoke at the evening serv- ice afterward, complimenting Dr. Tidmarsh and citing the singing as anQther example of cooperation between community and college. Soloist for the Choir were Ed- gar Moulton, Fred M. Alexander, Alan Van Wert, Charles Berger, and Darwin Friss, French horn. Miss Helen Henshaw and Tony Sharpe accompanied the commun- ity singing on organ and piano, respectively. Dean Will Gl'ant Permits To Make-up Class W o1·k Dell;ll Charles F. F. Garis has anno11nced that for the conven- ience of students who have been away on \authorized\ trips from the campus, his office will issue \Activity Absence Slips.\ These slips will serve to inform instruc- tors that the student has been away from class -with. permission of the college officials and is therefore privileged to be pezmit- ted to \make up\ his work and tests, Upo•ll presentation of the activ- ity absence slip, the Dean's office will suspend the charge of one dollar for any make-up tests or e:xaminations missed during the period indicated on the slip. No instructor may refuse to permit a student to make up a missed test if he presents a slip covering his absence. The slip is not an excuse for ab- sence from class, but is for the convenience of the faculty who will per'mit it to mitigate any loss of work. Immediately there was great m- Frederick L.

The meeting was called by Rob- ert I!:verest, president of the stu- dent council. The recommendation of the student council that nine men be appointed this year instead of eight as in former years was put in the form of a motion and passed. The suggestion, originally made by Dr, W. W. Bennett, that the elections be conducted under the preferential system, was overruled by a motion in favor of the usual non-preferential ballot. Eleven fraternities as well as the independents are represented on the slate. Seven fraternities nom- inated one man apiece, three nom- inated two men apiece, and one put three men on the ticket. Fiw independents were named. The nominations with their affili- ations are as follows: A. H. Merri- mna, Beta Theta Pi; Edmund R. Arundell, Psi Upsilon; J. C. Bowie, Sigrna Phi; Arthur B. Lawrence, Kappa Alpha; Frederick B. Haw- ley, Chi Psi; .Tames W. Scott, Sigma Chi; Robert B. Shepard, Alpha Delta Phi; Winterton U. Day, Vin- cent Smith, and Donald U. Liffiton, Phi Delta Theta; L. W. Thompson and Anthony A. Canale, Lambda Chi Alpha; William W. Mulvey end Edward .T. Barry, Delta Upsilon; George Doyle and Elmer' Johnson, Delta Phi; Harold Ackerman, Francis Agostini, Julius .T. Bund- gus, Hyman A. Enzer, and William Hoolt, independents. The elections will take place in daily :assembly as soon as the bal- lots ai\e printed. The unofficial date is Friday, December 18. ----0---- Fn1ternities Are Taxable By Social Security Act Fz·a.ternities are. taxable employ- ers under the new Social Security Act, it was learned at the National Interfraternity Conference's annual meeting. In discussing the status of fra· ternities as employer's under the Social Security Act, it was found that the Social Securlty Board had ruled that fraternities must pay taxes :for unemployment insurance and old age pensions for under- graduate employees as well as reg- ular house employees, such as housemen and coolts. Waiters, stewards, treasurers, and all those receiving any sort of remunera- tion for work or services rendered the house are eligible for such benefits as regular workers re- ceive under the act, and the house must pay regular taxes extracted A missive addressed to Dr. Doty was almost pathetic in its mood. \GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SYM- PATHETIC ATTITUDE\ it said, \YOU HAVE BEEN SO UNDER- STANDING.

Van Dyke· Proctor's) capitalizes on the curTe~t style of fast superficial comedies, the popularity of its ac- tors, Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, and Franchot Tone, and the na1ne of its director. The story emanated from one of the women's maga- zines which accounts for its blend of romantic heiress, smartcracking r·eporters and international spies in a highly improbable chase around Europe. The result may be good box office, but in the fact of recent light comedies must be set down as heavy footed humor. religious institutions, and confined t<> singing only a few traditional car()ls. Th.e researches of histo1·y have revealed a new wealth of early folk ballads and camls, Tone and Gable are two rival re- porters, London correspondents for New York papers, who cooperate in covering stories, though Gable manages to trick his partner at every turn. They start out for a wedding and an experimental air- plane flight. But the bride, Miss Crawford, runs out on her mar- quaint and refinedly beautiful.

A motion picture is made up of so many elements that it is a won- der that so often a film comes out that has what we are pleased to call artistry about it. The only conclusion that could be reached is that upon rare occasions all the factors balance out just right and the film possesses the intangible quality for success. Love On the Run conscientiously tries to be funny, and that may be a condemnation. Money was evi- dently spent lavishly and the act- ing of Crawford and Gable was adequate. :But despite all that it will join the long line of pictures seen to be forgotten on the mor- row.

It stated five times in succession that \it is a little known fact that polo, a game of the an\ cient Persians, was invented by Chinese women.\ Beet Tops A beet harvesting machine, tested jointly by the University of South- ern Califoi·nia, Davis branch, and the United States Department of Agriculture is \tops.\ The machine· is capable of pulling the beeks, top- ping them, and delivering them to waiting- trucks. These same fraternities were just a short while ago, lilte the card sharp who yells \cheatin' \ at his opponents in a game, decrying the prevalence of deals on the campus at that time. Perhaps they were thinking of a. few very wise and clever neutrals in the Senior Class who had garnered a few choic.e positions for themselves. Another house, a member of the present \deal brought out, in publicati.on, the fact that neutrals were bemg left out of things because of das- tardly other houses, who, no doubt, did not include that particular house in their \machine\. But things are different now. These houses have suddenly about faced and are pe!!.sonally see- ing to it that independents on the Union College Campus may find no important place in any body which has the least responsibility. They will, no doubt, nominate the same group of men who even now are holding important positions. These men are good fellows, thE!Y are popular, but this writer wonders if they have proved capable. Has, for example, the Student Council or a number of other governing bodies, pt•oved noteworthy? Have these men for whom we have all con- sistantly thrown away our votes ac- complished much in the way of working hard in these bodies or much needed campus reforms? I think we all know the answer. Eeretofore, the majority of neu- trals have taken a. back seat and merely watched the passing show, and show it certainly has .been. I think it about time that they throw off their apathetic cloaks and be- gin to take a personal interest in affairs. In other words, it is about time that t11ey become organized. Not only for t!).emselves: but for the good of the college in general, in which a large percentage of stu- dents think of Union College as a place to go to in the morning, and return from in the evening. Think it over neutrals. Become interested in college affairs, and as alumni you will be more conscious of how your old Alma Mater is get- ting along. \You don't get much out of living in one room of a fifteen room house, as Dr. Fox suggested. Organizations is good medicine. In Union there is strength. A Junior Neutral What a Relief!

As a foul shooter he has no peer. the game in the closing minutes, not set the world on fire in its Early season, off-night or not; there is no getting away from the fact that Colgate had much too much on the ball for Union. It was the first defeat for the Garnet on the home boards since St. Lawrence stopped them in December ·last year. Now the Larries are in the offing again to plague the Nitch- man record. Despite the fact that the same team with the addition of Brannigan, a left hande:d soph.o- more, is back; and despite the C:ol- gate shellacking, don't sell Union short Wednesday night. They got a lot of bad basketball out of their systems and will give Versocki, Rockmore and company a real tus- tle. Frosh Glimnters- While the varsity have been steal- ing the focus of the field glasses, the freshmen have been steadily improving. Nels has about fifteen men out there now, and <:an't de- cide which five to cut. That is a very healthy situation. The squad has a good number of big boys, and will be unbeaten unless I miss my guess. With the possible exception of Podbielski, Lou Kozlevcar, the affable freshman forward of the Austrian ancestry, is the slickest ball player in school. It is useless to enumerate his good points. He does everything well. He can rock back on his heels and fire deadly longs which are cir- tually impossible to block or he can fake and bore in under the basket and lay them up from under the backboard without using the board. (If you get what I mean). Nor is he the only star. Herb Watson, Bill Busino, and Bert Brittin are close behind. Nels may even think that one of the above is better than Koz- levcar. lf so, that is where we di.f- fer.

His team needs as St. Lawrence Wednesday much time as it can get on skates. Much drill and improvement will be necessary if Nels expects to gain a victory over the visiting St. Lawrence team tomorrow nite. The strongest team that Syracuse has had in recent years barely gained a victory from St. Lawrence by a 40-31 score. From all reports the next ()oppo- nents are even better than Colgate, and are slated to repeat last years licking. Especially good is their right forward, Versocki, who ran up a total of 11 points against the big Orange team, with hardly a dissenting opinion.

Goal Sllooting Yesterday's session waa given over mainly to shooting pucks from all directions at .AI Borden who is the only capable goalie now working with the team. Ken Tomp- kins the regular CUI3todian of the nets last year may turn out after the Christmas recess, but that is problematical. At present a tenta- tive starting six would include Cap- tain Fritz Hawley, Doc Orton, and the tempermental .Art Breymaier on the first line with Joe Paul and eithet• Fred Vanderbilt or Hank Clay, who is developing into quite a prospect, on defense with Borden in the goal. It is extremely doubt- ful that Paul will be able to make the trip to Princeton and appear against Cornell at the Rye Play- land. The sparea are Larry Achilles, Bob Shepard, Jamie Bond, Axel Merriman, S~ott Smith, Howie Thompson, Frank Agostini, and the celebrated Burlce twins from Co- hoes. B.

Yesterday Nels put hi,; freshman team thmugh an exten- sive practice. First carne funda- mentals and then mot·e fundamen- tals. This was topped off by an hour of hard scrimmage. The squad was divided into two teams, and in the absence of Bert Brittin, who is out for a couple of days because of an injured knee, Nels inserted ·himself in the line up of the first team, and put Busino in Brittin's position. The first team was composed of Kozlevcar, Wat- son, Buchanan, :Busino, and Han- son. The second team consisted of Nitchman, Tanner, Perry, Brock· myer, and Mohl. Mohl and Hanson alternated. Play Is Even 33· If this scrimmage could be used p· as a basis on which to determine 7 the difference between the two 8 teams, it would be very difficult to 0 decide which is the better as the 2 score was 35 to 33 in favor of the 0 first team. 0 Kozlevcar, living up to 'hi~ past 17 r·eputation, was one of the most consistent players, closely followed P by Watson who was a constant 3 scoring threat.

Bids Applegarth Adieu Gives Dinner for Secretary Who Is Pl'omoted to Dr. Fox's Office Miss Lillian Applegarth, who <lur• ing the past years has been secre- tary to Mr. Milton M. Enzer in the News Bureau, today assumed her new duties as office sect·etary for President Dixon Ryan Fox. Miss Anne O'Neil Beattie, who has been secretary to the president since March, 1910, it wa::l learned, will hereafter continue her duties on half time. Nine dtudent::l a::lsociated in vari- ous capacities with the News Bu- reau and Mr. Enzer last night gave a \good-luck\ dinner at Hale House in honor of Miss Applegarth, .and presentPd her with a fountain-pen desk set a::l a token of appreciation and as a convenient tool with which to begin her new dutieo; to- day. Several weeks ago, Mis:; Beattie asked to be relieved of pat t of her duties she has conducted for nearly 27 years. Miss Beattie joined the Union College staff a year after Dr. Charles Alexander Richmond became pt·esident. At that time, President Richmond had \desk :lpace\ with the late Dr. Frank Coe Barnes, in charge of admi>l:Jion8, in what is now Dr. Burge:J John:oon':J office in Washburn Hall. Later the president's office was moved to what would now b<' the upper part of the College Dining Hall, and finally, aftPr the war, into theo Ad- ministration Buildim;. But not un- til Dr. Fox bt>came president were his qum ten; and those of the Sec- retary \Mr. Charles N. Waldron) placed in their present location, and so pleasantly decorated. Miss Beattie has ~erved under four pres- idents, Dr. Richmond, Dr. Frank Parker Day, Dr. Edward Elle1y and Dr. Fox. Miss Applegarth became secre- tary to Mr. Enzer in 1930. Since then she has become convei:\sant with the college affail s and its per- sonnel, and, since the adver. t of President Fox when Mr. Enze1· was made assistant to the president for public announcements, she has fi·e- quently assisted the president's of- fice in the preparation of rnan u- scripts for publication. Miss Helen Deines has been en- gaged to replace Miss Applegarth in the News Bureau. The students who attended the dinner for Miss Applegarth last night were: S. Ralph Cohen, '3i. John B. Dowling, JJ·., '37. Fenton A. Gage. '37. Hyman A. Enze1·, '38. Henry M. Stephenson, '38, William W. Mulvey, '38, Edward Ret:' rtyk, '39, David Yunich, '39, and G. Load- wick Peck, '40. Mt·.

The results of this resParch wet·e published in the September issue of the Journal of Heredity of the American Genetics Association, and according to Dr. Leonard, Mr. Righter's work repre- sents a distinct contribution to this little known field. The fact that Mr. Rig-hter's piece of z·esearch grew out of his hobby of raising bantam fowls should make his topic more interesting to other students having hobbies along :;cientific line,;.

Hoadley, chairman, the com- mittee is made up as follows: Charles T. Male, vice-chairman, Frank B. Gatchell, Jr. and S. Ralph Cohen, '37, Samuel FatT, '38, and Rollin T. Wright, '39. In a letter to the members of the committee, announcing their ap- pointment, Dr. Fox said: $200 rfl01·th of Black Eyes \We are very anxious to have the College Dining Room meet the needs of the students in every prac- ticable way, and anxious, too, that the students understand the prob- lems of conducting a College Din- ing Room.\ When asked as to the scope or duties of the group, Dr. Fox fur- ther stated, \This is simply a means of getting student opinion, and serving perhaps as an inter- preter for student feeling about the Dining Room.\ The Council has not as yet been given any specific duties or powers, and the first meeting will probably be called after the Christmas re- cess. The Dining Room, with the rest of Hale House, was opened early in the Spring of this year, the result of a gift of an anonymous donor. Mr. and Mrs. N. W. Cease have been in charge of the Dining Room since the opening, and it has be- come a popular place for group banquets and dinnet·s. Every time the lamp glass and bulb of one of the campus lamp posts are broken it costs the college $1.30 according to ComptrolJer Anthony DeH. Hoadley. The glass in the poly- paned lamps, which afford such tempting targets for snowballs and other missles, accounts for 40c of this amount and the bulb the other 90c. ·Over $200 has been spent so far by the college in repairing three black eyes given to cam- pus illumination. Mr. Hoadley said that students were not in all cases responsible for the damage since much was done by town rowdies, Cummins Writes Booklet On Government, Labo1· Faettl ty to Spend RecEss ~t Meetings Many Travel t() Atlantic City; Art Lawrence Howe-ver Will E1nbark ou Honeyntoon Union College professors will travel to many points of the aca- demic co·mpass during the two weeks of Christmas recess to at- tend meetings of learned societies.

Fraternities, which are employers in such cases, and the management of Hale House are responsible to see that their !tit- chen help and student waiters are enrolled. Failure to do so may make them subject to a fine of $10,000, it was learned this week when one of the fraternity house stewards gained an interview with Administrator H. A. Haubner of the Securities Bureau in his office in the P-ost Office Building. Mr. Haubner, who is a fraternity man himself, considers the .frater- nity as a profit taking organiza- tion. He is forced under the Social Securities Act to place the college organization in the same class as the boarding house, hotel, and country club. Because only domes- tic help in private homes are ex- empt from the. Act, all ho1,1se em- ployees must be included -in its roll, not only chefs and house mothers but also student waiters; and all other students t·eceiving any remunerat'ion for services.

Eliphalet's Scrawl May Net $J.O; Many College Prexy's Bring Less Eliphalet Nott, D. D., who gar- nered millions for Union College while president for an unconscion- ably long tim<', i<S just u name to- day, but that name is still worth $150 to $300 and more in cold cash to the college. It's all a result of the craze for autographs that sends fans streak- ing after movie stars, trans-Atlan- tic flyers, exploreJ's and other fans. In other words, Eliphalet Nott's signature is worth money, but not a great lot. Codman Hislop, who as secretary to Charles N. Waldron achieved the reputation of college archivist last year, refuses to be quoted on the subject, but admits there might be as many as 150 autographs and holographs of the great Doctor ly- ing around the college. The signa- tures appear· on everything kom college diplomas and land deeds to patent grants. Helmer L. Webb, the college li- brarian, quotes the market price of Eliphalet Nott script as no more than a dollar or two, but there seems to be two schools of thought on the subject. A faculty member, so far unidentified, has stated that he would give $10 for a genuine Nott.

Mr. Nathan goes farther, how- ever, and points out that our Eli- phalet is still worth a lot more than other college presidents of the same approx:imate vintage, \In the way of college presi- dents,\ he writes, \Ellphalet Nott, quondam president of Union Col- lege, is worth a dollar more than Theodore D. Woolsey, once presi- dent of Yale, a dollar and a half more than James Mather, once president of Harvard, twice as much as H. T. Durant, founder .of Wellesley, and more than merely twice as much as Mark Hopkins, erstwhile president of Williams.\ Even at that, however, Elipha!et Nott is a bargain. Brigham Young, thousand-wived Mormon, can ask, and get, $15 for his signature, and Chief Justice John Marshall. is at an all-time high of $65. Royalty brings very high prices, a Henry VIII being worth $215, and Henry IV of France selling for $105 a throw.

Yet we feel that in some rather intangible way we have itl common with them an affection fol' the colleg:e, and we take this opportunity of addressi11g them. We have published on pag·e one an account of a sel'i€s of organ recitals, given by Dr. Elmer A.

Beginning Jan- uary 9, these 1·ecitals will be broadcast each Saturday from 1 to 2 o'cloc-k, Eastern Stand- ard time. The oppo1-tunity of having· this weekly contact with men far away is denied many colleges, snd Union is particularly fortunate in enjoying- it. To ou1· alumni abroad, we say that these progran1s, can, if the alumni so wish, act as a tie with Union and as a reminder of un- doubtedly pleasant associations, and we Ul'g-e that they- tune in.

Bal<el' '15 decided to show here his collection of antique art for the first time anywhere. In the gTacious .Slll'l'oundings of the Faculty Loung;e which his generosity has made pos- sible, the delicate craftsmanship and g·enius or long--dead artists were a welcome relief from a world lht·oLIJing with Social Studies courses, royal romances and student councils. The subject of the beauty of many of these items in the collection could inspire pages of rhapsodic periods, uut it is treated elsewhere in this issue. This editorial wishes to comment upon the spirit in which the col- lection was shown. Mr. Baker's spirit has al- ways been one with that of the college, and it is his kindness in extending to us these com- paratively minor considerations, as well as his larger beneficences, that The Concordi· ensis wishes to acknowledge. However, there might be some doubt as to whether this college has deserved the com- pliment. It would seem that we have fallen badly from grace in the matter of encour- aging an 3ippreciation of the arts, both lively and pictorial. While two years ago we had the Union College Conceits in the Memorial Chapel, and the exhibits of 1~eproduction and original paintings arranged by the Faculty Women's Club, this year we have had little but the Japanese prints and Elroy Green's water colors and oils in the Bookstore. One of the major pleasures of the past four years, we think, was listening to the Vienna Boy's Choir on a memorable night two years ago, and although we under- :,;tood little of it, the exhibit this spring· of modern art was extremely interesting·.

The results of these tactics are known to all. Ken Brown was about the only man who seemed to have ever seen or played against a zone de- fense. The rest were helpless. What's the answer? Of course, Colgate did not use the above method of play in the second pe- riod of play but Union certainly did not display the same brand of ball that they had in the first pe- riod. In other words we seem to have a twenty-minute ball club. We have said before and we say it again that we do not like to criti- cize either the individual players or the team as an entity. We do not believe ourselves capable of such criticism. Something, however,. is caus-ing the team, to let down considerably in their playing abil- ity as seen during the second por- tions of the two major games to date.

The two ·hard scl'immages that the freshman .basketball team has had this week has enabled Coach Nels Nitchman to discover the ef- fects of his month's coaching. The team, s.ays Nels, works fast breaks well, .as a unit, but will have to distil:lguish ·between fast break situations and the situations. whc>r!' the defense is set as in the latter case not to thtow the ball away but to keep it in their pos- session. The rnain team weakness is that it does not follow up shots quickly enough More time in the futm e will bE> spent on team of- fense and defense. Some of the fellows have im- proved a grPat dE>al oil defense. Mould, in particular, has made a great deal of progress. Miller's ag- gressiveness and ability to put into practice the things that have bee.n gone over have resulted in better performances on his part. Even thP best are not above cri- ticism. Louie Kozlevcar, by far the best prospe-ct, has at times not too well controlled drive, but when it is he shows up very well as can be testified by anyone who has seen the freshmen practice. J. J. S.

St. Lawrence staged a strategic move in the second half of the con- test Wednesday evening, and over- tool{ a three-point Union lead to come out on the long end of a 89 to 28 score, giving Union its second setback in succession. By fa,.;t, but none too brilliant ball playing, the Garnet five played St. Lawrence to a standstill in the first half, bottled up Versocki pretty effectively, and fed the ball to Johnnie Shultz for two field goals and watched Johnnie ring up seven foul shots out of nine attempts at free tosses. In the foul-throwing contest W. Thomas of Lambda Chi Alpha and J. Tinkle of Kappa Nu are tied with 22 out of 25. D. Ford of Chi Psi and W.

Basketball Notes Basketball notes-You may not have noticed but Grant Smith played for almost a half with three personal fouls against him and did a swell defensive job. In fact Ire held down Wood, the big St. Law- rence center, better d~ring that period than in the first half when he didn't have to worry about leaving the game-this is the last stand for that athletic dynasty at St. Lawrence headed by Gus Ver- socki and his side-kick who started their careers as sop.homores by trouncing Cornell in football in the opening game of the season and continued in like vein for the next three years ... Union was un- fortuna.te to come up against Ver- socki on one of his· best nights. .Anybody who shoots a dead ball the wa.y he does in his set shots can't be that hot every night. ..

OppoSite City Hall Zone Defense Effective Union seemed well on its way to the second victory of the year but bottled up by a zone defense, and the devastating shooting of Ver- soclti and Wood, the home team was practically helpless. Five points were made by the Dutchmen in this half, all by way of free baskets. Only on about two occa- sions did the Union men penetrate the stiff defense of St. Lawrence for a half-way good shot at the hoop. The St. Lawrence troupe were a fast-breaking, fast-moving outfit. Versocki and Wood, of course, be- ing the outstanding members on the team. Fouls were committed continually, which slowed up the game.
