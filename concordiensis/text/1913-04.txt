Our baseball season opens Saturday, \vhen the nine goes to Ne\v York to play the fast Cohnnbia te:un. This ·wi11 be our first gan1e and Coh1n1b1a' s sixth. They haye had sev- eral \veeks 1nore of practice and have been hardened into shape \Vhile our players have had scarcely any real practice, O\iving to the delay caus~cl by the incon1pleted dian1ond. In spite of these handicaps, the team goes to New York, determined to play the gan1e of their live&. The Colun1bia nine defeated Colgate'· by a 10-5 sco~e; Rutg-ers;-- by a 9-7 score in a se·ven inning gan1e and has lost only to Atnh.erst by a close score. The Rut gers tnen tel11.1s that -vve ought to \Vin foT they hit Columbia's pitcher hard and at ,,,.in and on1 y 1 ost the gatne through \vretched fielding.

I 11 an intervie\Y \vith a Concorc1- icnsis reporter, last \veek, Coach Da-vyson mac1e the following statetnent : ·'The call for candidates for base ball t bis spring- has been 1·es1)onded to in a tnanner that is very gratifying. Such a host of men and such -vvillingness I have seldo1n seen. Each day there are enough men to n1akc three teams, and then a fe\v to spare. The back\vard spring, hov~,.ever, vvi th its rains and high \vinds has kept the men frorn '' sho\ving '' much thus far. \iVith about fouTteen men trying out for pitcher, five or six for catcher, and fifteen or 1nore for tht' infield and ou tfie1d, the t)rob1en1 is one of rather a difficult nature- I n1ean the probl<:·nl of picking out the nine men \vho should con.!- pose a first team. The solution \Vill of ne- cessity have to be broug·htabout slo-vyly. \\?e -vvon' t be able to tell just who the best men a.re, probably till the season is fairly vve11 ad- vanced. There are so n1any positions to be filled, and the men are comparativelv 1111- knovvn to the coaches that \ve n1ust~'t be in1patient -if things come our \vay s1o\vhT. All that I can say novv is that \Vith a~ eYt:n break of luck, etc., I think \Ve ought to hwvl; a fairly successful season. Fred T.

ii I, i 8 THE CONCORDIENSIS WO:RK STARTED ON GYM. New Building Will be Ready for Occu- pancy by Decembe,r 9th Work on the excavation for the foundation of the new gymnasiun1 has been started and is being rushed along. The Amsterdan1 Construction Company has tnoved apparatus to the spot and is busy with men and tearns. The formal laying of the corner stone w111 be held Commencement vVeek and after this ceremony the building win be rushed to cotnpletion so that it can be used early in Deceinber. This means that the Junior Week festivities vvill take place in our O\Vn gymnasium and will th~s acquire a truly co1~ lege atmosphere -vvhich we have missed at the TenEyck and the Golf Club. Our bas~ ketball games -vvill be played there and -vve will at last, after a long vvait and 1nucb toi1 ·and labor, have a real gymnasit11n, one of vvhich we may be proud and \Vhich '\vill be a credit to the college. Our old building- has lasted \Yell bnt has becotne too antique and c1ecrep1t to adequately serve the co1Tcge in its true capacity. The nevv building \Vi11 be of brick covered -vvith stucco. The basketba11 floor V\rill be 120 feet long vvhile the main floor will have a length of 168 feet. The lockers for the players will all be located on one floor and \~ill be very atnple. The swimming pcol and indoor 1·unning track are things which 1._Tnion has 1nissed badly and their acquisi- tion is an in1portant addition to the college. In addition to the dressing rooms for men there ,vill be spacious roon1s vvhich \Vill be set aside as dressing rooms for the '''\otnen at co11ege dances and like functions. The alumni luncheons at co1ntnence1nent time ·will a1so be served in the 1arg·e tnain hall. The plans ·were dra\vn up by George Post & Sons of Ne·w York and the contract has been let. The total cost vvill amount to consider- ab1e tnore than one hnndred thousand c1o11ars and when cotnpleted our gymasiu1n -vvill he excel] eel by none in colleges of our size. The student body 1nay clain1 a l:n rge part of the credit for n1aldng the bu1ding a possi~ hility, for it 'vas in the undergraduate body that the gyn1nasittn1 fnncl was started and not till later '\vas it presented to the alu1nni. Bnt without alun1ni support the pillan could never bave matured as it has, and we feel that much praise is due those alun1ni who rallied so loyally to the sun.port of their Aln1a 1\'Iater. ---:o:--- MAY AMEND HONOR CO:URT President Ulrich Appointed. Committee to Receive Suggestions In view of the recent unfavorable criticism of the present \vorkings of the Honor System, the Court has decided to an1end the constitu- tion as conditions n1ay detnand. To\vard this end P1·esiclent Ulrich has appointed a com~ ' tnittee con1posed of Masterson '13, Mayhatn '13, and C. Shern1a11 '14, to receive sug-- gestions fron1 the student body for the an1end- ino· of the Honor· Constit11tion, so that the b Honor Syste1n may becon1e effective and so that the supposed defects in the system may, if possible, be eradicated. The co1nn1ittee will, from these suggestions, dravv up art1encl- ments which the Honor Court vvi11 offer to the student body for ratification. The I-Ionor Court realizes that some minor defects tnay exist at present but it is very anxious to remedy these and to 1nake the systen1. reallY efficient. rfhe appointing of SUCh a C0111- n1ittee seen1ed the easiest and best -vvay to get the real sentitnent of the uncle1·graduatcs and to find, if possible, the. solution of the eli fficu1 ty. --:0:-- An enjoyable dance \'aS given bv Chi Chapter of r:1i f~_lm:-na D.:lta 1ast Saturday night.

TI-IE CONCORDIENSIS 9 DEMOCRACY IN TERRACE COUNCIL CLASSICAL CLUB In tune with the change in national achnin- istrative affairs con1es the proposal of a change in governing· student affairs at Union in the forn1 of giving the three upper classes the ·entire privilege of electing the n1embers of the Terrace Council. It is said that by this method, the council \\vill becon1e more clen1ocratic and a more nearly perfect repre- sentative of the student body. Just \\vhat fault can be found -vvith the present council and its actions seen1s unexplainable. The pro1noters of this nevv idea are silent on this, indeed, the coun~il is rather commended for its \1;.rork so far this year. For some tirne past, there has been a feeling of rest]essness among son1e students and it hus made itse1f n1anifest in attacking various college customs ancl activities. At present it is assailing the Terrace Council. This body \vas founded at l~nion in 1906. Half of it is chosen by the 1ncn1 bers of the senior class and half by the retiring· conncil. It is stricth· a senior society and to place the control of its n1e1nbership in the hands of the student bocly \\·ould abolish it as such. On the basis of the plea of democracy, it \voulcl seen1 as though the council \vere den1ocratic enough as it is. It \vould be absurd to propos~ that the president of the senior class be chosen by the student body, and yet he is a repre- sentative of it and presides O\'\Cr its n1eetings. A.nd so ·with the Terrace Council, it seen1s on1v reasonable that the fello\VS, older and wiser in student affairs, should select the rcp- rcsentatiyes of the students. And these fellows arc the tnem bers of the retiring coun- cil and the senior class, the former of \vhon1 by virtue of their experience in Terrace Council \York and the latter of \vhonl by kno\ving best of all, those of their cla~smates <1eserying- of the bon or, are the proper ones to n1ake the selection. Look over the various councils of the past yeays or, at least, those which you have knu\vn about and consider whether or not the honor has gone to the de- serving anc1 cotnpetent men. .A.t the n1ccting of the Classical Club held April 1st,. a constitution \vas adopted. After the business of the evct1ing an interesting pa;ger on '' JVIncn1onic Latin Puzzles '' \Vas read by Professor Bennett. The club gave its first public lecture vV cd- nesclay night, 'v hen Principal Frank Kellogg of Albany High Sc..:hool spoke on '' The Latin Lo J\er in Italy.'' The 1ecture \vas illustrat~ ed by stereoptican views.

We are to edit a pa1)er \vhich \Yi11 represent \\C n ion in the \Vorl d. of colleges, \Vhich \vill interest and enthuse the a] nn1ni and which vvill be truly represen tati Ye of our student hodv. Such a task demands constant attention and much considerati<>n and thought. \Ve are giving it this careful attention and continue to O.o so, not merl' l.r aiming at a continuance of its past good re- cord but sttiving to-vvard a betterment of that reco1·d aud to\vard son1e definite improvement both in the character of the news and in the literary style in which it is written. We fL·el that we can do this and can make the Con- cordiensis a more truly representative of the college if n1ore of the students will take an active interest in it. At present it is i:mb- 1ished by a certain fe\v n1en. If this nun1ber could be doubled or trebled, it \vou1d con1e nearer being a real student publication. \Ye \vonk1 like to have full v half the student bod\· ~ . occasional contributors of ne\vs iten1s, stories, short sketches or anything of that natu rL· \vhich so he1l)S to give the can1pus attnus- phere to a real col1ege paper. If W'\C can help give our magazine sotncthing- of this ntn1osphere as a permanent thing, \VC shall 11aye done son1ething for lTnion. Any articles or contributions of any sort n1av lx· 11andec1 to the editor anc1 \vill be considered ancl, if possible, used. \V c \vish that even· man in college might feel a personal interest in the ConcoTdiensis, for it is just such an interest achieved in any undertaking 'vhich can, and n1ust tnake that enterprise a sue- cess. ---:0:--- THE NO ..

THE CONCORDIENSIS ll spirit of fair and honest dealing and of the san 1 e fine sense of honot·. By this agree~ 111 ent, co11ege politics, as they ha:ve heretofore L~~isted at U 11ion, will be abolished. \Ve a11 kno\V of deals vvhich have been n1ade and vve arc a11, deep in our hearts, as harned if V\re took any pa1·t in those deals. 'fhe \V hole idea of politics in college is \Vl,ong. Only the best n1an should ever gain a student office and \Ve should have enough 1oya1ty to lTnion t, 0 -want only such men e1'ected to any under- rules based upon honor, and t11e sooner his connection vvith the college ceases, the better for a11 concerned. But ·we fee1 sure that no such lack of personal honor exists in our co1- 1egc and that the '~No- Deal .l\green1ent '' \·111 succeed and \vi11 beco1ne a 1)Crtnanent 1nstit u- tion just as the Honor Court and fot the san1e reason. The idea, that one n1an o-rad ua te office . ,..., should have a certain office -or chairtnanship because he can give anothet- n1an a certain number of votes, irrespective of his fitness for that office, is fundatnentally wrong. It is deals of this sort that barm a college ancl that \\~ork real injustice to the students; ancl it was to correct just these evils, that the ' ' No- Dcal Ag-reement'' \vas pas:-;.ec1 by the student hodv. rrhe Terrace Council has dra\Yll up the ag-recn1ent \Vith g-reat care ancl precision and it has been drafted frotn systems in operation in other colleg·es, changed to fit local condi- tions. True, it may be f()tn1d necessary to atnend it after a fair triaL No one can fore- tell and provide for all the exigencies vvhich 1nay ar1se. Our honor constitution \vas amendc:d and changed se\\\eral times before it reached its present degree of perfection. But both Honor Systetn and No- Deal 1\g-ree- 111ent depend, not so n1uch upon the v\·orc1ing: of the articles or the severity of the punish- 111ents as upon the degTee 1n \vhich the spirit of fairness and of individttal honor is present in the student body. The student is placed upon his honor in both instances.

16 THE ·CONCORDIENSIS THE NO-DEAL SYSTEM The n1ain feature of the No-Deal System as recently adopted by the student body is, that it aims to e1in1inate dealings in colleg-e -~politics betvveen groups or individuals for their mutual advantage. While it places a tnan upon his honor not to buy votes for any consideration \\vhatever there is nothing 1n the ag-reement, either expressed or in1plied, that prohibits the free dscussion of candidates. The penalty for violation is that the guilty party is ineligible to vote in any undergraduate election, and the forfeit- ure of eligibility to election or app<?intm.ent to any undergracl.uate office or comrnittee. The agreetnent is to be ratified each year, four-fifths of the student body being requirec1. The Honor Court constitt1tes the co1nn1ittee to pass on all cases ar,is1ng under vinlations of this agreement. 'ro those conversant \\Vith the c\-ils of ''col- lege politics'' at Union, this agreen1ent con1es as a vvelco1ne retncdy. \Vhi1e it is still 11n- tried, it can \York no greater evils than a1- rcad,· exist. It probablr has its 1rnpcrfections; thes~ ,,·ill be fonnd in its \Yorkinf{· It can be amended to meet these as they arise. It is hoped that like the Honor System, this No- Deal Ag-reement rnay bccon1e an eff~ctive and lasting institution of old lJnion.

THE OONCORDIENSIS 9 FO·OTBALL SCHEDULE Manager Telfer announced yesterday the football schedule for next season. The schedule \VaS held Up for sometime vvhi1e the manager tried to arrange .a game V\rith R. P. I. The schedu1e was so nearly co1nplete when athletic relations \vere resumed that 1t -vvas impossible to arrange a gatne for this coming season_. The Hobart game ,vi11 be played in Buffalo, on l~ovember 4th, election day. This was thought a better place than either Geneva or Schenectady, for there are many Hobart and Union alumni in Buffalo, and a larger cro\vd is expected than if the game were played anywhere else. The sche- dule follows; Sept. 27, St Lavvrence on the Campus Oct. 4, Rutgers at Ne\v Brunswick Oct. 11, 11assachusetts Agg-ies on the Cam- pus . Oct. 18, Wesleyan on the Ca1npus Oct. 25, Rochester on the Carnpus No\T. 4, Hobarl at Buffalo Nov. 8, Stevenii on the Can1pus ~ov. 15, Ha1ni1ton at Clinton ---:o:--- TRACK TEAM BUSY \Vith the approach of fair weather Spring track \vork has begun in earnest.

Captain LaEarro11 feels in order to deyelop a teetn1 that sha11 represent the best in t'nion, n1ore n1en should be out for each event. In order to n1aintain track athletics on a level vvit11 other athletics here, the several events on the track and field tnust be keenly contested ancl the \Vay to b1·i ng: t11is a bont is for every n1an to do all that he can to support the tean1 . The schedule is no\v cotnp1eted listi11g five n1eets, the fi.rst one less than a n1onth off. 0\ving to the constructive \vork o·oino- on b b for the ne\v gy1nnasitun, the oy·al track \v:ill not be a•ailable for the quarter mile run and the longer events. Through the courtesy of the General E1ectric Athletic Association, hovvever, their park has been placed at our disposal along with lockers and sho\vers. Begining next week the squad \vi11 be kept at training table and no provision vvill be neglected which may insure the men in the best possible condition.

The knovvledge thus gained will ·help greatly ~n avoiding son1e of the dangers \\' hich are so often in1n1inent, and also in pub- lishing a paper \v·hich will bring greater credit to the college ~than ·ever before.

Chaucer's hun1or is thus made more convincing and its sincerity \vins con- fideace. Delicacy is -always present in Chaucer's (Excepted for the 1itei~ary contest) I-!un1or in poetry is a -rare thing, and it re- quires a maste·r to use it without burlesquing or lowering the tone of the work. Chaucer has n1ade hnn1-orous touches constantly in his \Canterbury Tales,\ and yet, at no tin.1e does the reader feel that the piece has beco1ne com-- n1onplace tl1er-eby. I 1 t seen1s that Chancer had hun1or. Unlike many an author who rnake:~ his point by gross exaggeration or the mech- anical turn of a situation, l1.e relies on the nicety of his descriptions to secure his humor, and ·never are vve ·chagrinec1 by the rough var- iety o,f punning hurnor or horseplar. lie aclds his chuckle as a \by-the-\Yay or inter- polates his ·witt'icistns in s·uch a harmless 1nan- ner that they prejudice the rc3-cler almost un- kno.wingly. As he describes the ::\'Ionk: a ren1akable po·wer of differentiating hun1or, pathos, and irony; and ·in no case does his · irony strike blindly or unjustly; when he laughs you feel that it is n1ost properly; when he starts a sign, you do not consider it out of \\Vhat! sholde he stuuie, and make hyn1selven vv nod ( n1acl) 11lace. Chaucer's \Prologu-e\ is written in a con- Upon a book in cloistre alwey -to poure, Or s \vynken (toil) ,,·ith his hancl,es, anc 1 lab- 11 dential, alrnost serious, vein, ren1arkable for its dignity of fan~1.tiadty. Yet this closeness 1nakes the reac' c r n1ore responsive to his ·ef- f ec·ts and artifil c ~. Chancer does not labor for effects,-it is his o\vn personality that n1akes clitnaxes and sallies, and the reader fol- lo·ws unconsciously. Thus the humor does not strike the 1·eader as stilted ancl artificial, but quietly carries hirn away by its rippling, natural flow. So guileless it seen1s that at tin1es it requires a ready \vit to penetrate its subtle rich:1·ess. 'This characteristic is beautifully ex- clnplifiecl in a quotation from the Prologu~e, where, in speaking of the Prioress he declares: \l\.ncl French she spak ful fa ire and fetishly, J\fter the scole of Stratfo,nl-·atte-Bo-\ve,\ and quietly sn1iles at the conscientious way she follo\\-ed her lessons. But in all his fidelity to ·1i fe he does not oYerclo detail or cl ra \V his in1ages on a minute sca1e. 1-1 e s<:·lc:cts carefully \vhat he consid- ers charactcri:;tics and artistic ; the re~.t he leaves su ggestec1. ] n the development of his characters, Chaucer does not car1cature, as oure, A.s A.nstyne bit (bid) ? 1-Io·\V shall the world be served? La t A .. ustyn have his swynk to hyn1 reserved.'' Other aspects of Cha.ucer's versatility in handling his tnaterial are ·ever present. His rnastery of clirec t hun1or is exe1nplifie·d \\rhen ''Pertel-ote\ says: \Have ye no n1annes herte, and han a berd? -which seen1s ·to he a terrible thrust to poor (~hauntecleer.\ In describing the fox, he gives ·wittingly a yague, clrea.cl itnpression by as- cen ti·ng a fevv features : \11. is color vvas bitwaxe yel we and reed ~ And tipped \vas his tail, and bothe his eres \Vith Blak. unlyk ·the remenant of his heres: 1~Iis sno\vte s1nal. with glowying eyen t\veye. \~et of his look for fee allnost I cleye.'' Here every w-ord is r~. s·troke vYhich n1akes the fox a beast to he feared by \fonles.\ and this satne sirnplicity {}f diction is is charn1. f)ryclen. that n1aster of roesy, tried vrith gnn-d

I ! 14 THE CONCORDIENSIS intent to better the verse of Chaucer in this ta1e, but his 1nasterly vocabulary was too ex- plicit, ancl his words drew too n1uch aHention to detaH itself where Chattc·er used suggestion . . l\lthough Chaucer's verses are shnpie, they are full ·of zest that is rarely equalled. \tVhat can equal this rondo of serene ·cyndcisn1: ''For, also siker as In principio, l\Iulier est honTinis confusio; :M\adan1e the sentence of this Latyn is v\\:on1an is lnannes joye and al his blis.\ Chaucer's agility in Latin is not excelled by his r·eadiness in English. .i\ncl so are his allusions to the lurking ''Russell,\ viz: \Iscar- iot,\ \Canelon and Sinon~these of a fox l lly the very coa,trast o-f their seriousness to the situation, we in1agine the characters to lean back and cast deris·ive laughter at their wick- ed in1·itator. ..l\nd in a sin1.ple phrase he catches unrivaled point to his jest, saying: \.:-\nd when that Pertelote thus hercie hytn rore, She \vas agast. and sevde '·O herte deere., 'j 1n \Yhich the vvords ''herte deere·' force a glnp nf 111irth down ~the reader's throat. Yet v\'ith all these excellencies of style, \Ve yyoncler how ~it is tha~t a tale \vritten nearly six hu·ndred years ago can be so universal in its appeal that it is still truthful in its delineation of character toclay. T·here is n1or·e than the n1ere truth of the fable vvhich has 1n1n1or- talizecl Chaucer. I-Iis grasp of hun1an nature has given us n1uch of the enj oyn1ent of his vvriting. Fe\v authors can be as universal in their at1nosphere a'S Chaucer, v.Tho enables the 1nan fro111 \l ennont or T1·nrneo to ~ee at oncr these literay prototypes in daily life and t·o ap· precia te Chaucer's cheeriness, witticisn1, and quiet chuckling. It is not 1nerely loL·al colo1 that Chancer has brought intD this tale, fo1 that is con11non enough to all who have ha<l any e-xperience ·in life. but in ''Chauntecleer.\ ancl '' Pertelote,\ are foreever en1hoclied cePtain pha·ses of hun1an nature. We have a rather unnecessary predon1inanre of the \n1arde(1 life'' episode in our n1oJern htunorous litera- ture; yet ·Chaucer eleva·te:s all this rustic monotony to a classical level,-w hich ·certain1v is a proof of literary genius. · I-Iis treatn1ent of the subject is epic. Every des·cription brings a clin1ax, an<l every incident carries a certain elen1ent of suspen·se. Nlanv of Chaucer's vi·e\vs and analogies are uniqu~· to Chaucer hirnself and these unexpected a~;­ pects stin1ulate our interest. His w·ork is art, conscious and superior, \V hich makes us feel that Chaucer is sitting by and enjoying his ef- f.ects as they reach our n1inds. I-iis work i:-; always natural, and yet nothing in it is acci- dental. '~~1erry Chaucer'' \vas indeed versatile in hi:-; hun1or, for it rcal 1 izes the pathetic side of life as well as the gay side. \Vith hin1 the n1oral is serious, and, unlike a mere jester of the court, he can preach as vvell; for your final in1pression \vhen the two principals of the barnyard dran1a have retir·ec.l, is sincerity tt) life. You fe-el that Chaucrr h1.s g1ven you a tnoral po-tion covered with a swe·et coat of htunor vv-hich is not shallo\v nor the pro·cluct () f an :irresponsible n1ind.

Timely Hitting and Costly Errors by th.e Visitors Do the Rest. Tufts' baseball tean1 arriyed in Schenec- tady \vith the sca1ps of Cornell and Syracusl' still fresh in their belts. They looked and acted the part of experienced n1en at the ,g·an1e. Harris, Tufts pitcher, had shut out Corne11 the sa1ne \veek and \vas scheduled to oppose enion. Our team had gone to Cohnnbia the week before, but \~.ret grounds and incJe111ent \veather had preyented the gan1e. Conse- quently they lined up against the Tufts nine for their opening gan1e of the season. ~1ore than halt the team \vere ,gTeen n1en and \vhat the result of the ga1ne \vould be, especially since Tufts had a \Yinni11g streak, no one could foretell. 1'ufts sho\ved up \vell 1n practice and every tnan played his position like a v·eteran. It \ivas plainly to be seen that they \vere in tnid-seasnn forn1 \vh11e C nion \vas still not yet fully acquainted \Yith all the ins and outs of the diamond a1thon.g·h they sho\ved lots of snap and speed. rl'he team has been on the diamond not quite a week and has been co1ning along rapiclly l'\'l'r since. It is too bad that had weather and other conditions keep the tea1n in the grass so late every year and it is all the more to their credit to \Vjn the opening g-ame. The \Yeatlier \Vas the \Vorst kind for air- tight baseball. A cold \vind ble\v across the ca1npus and cut.1nto the bones of the players and ~pectators. Fe\v fans ren1aineo seated for long yet they stood around and loyally \Yatched the gan1e until the finish: The players '''\ere aln1ost glad ·when their turn can1e to lea ye the hench and take the fie1d \Vherc they could jun1p aronnc1 and keep \varn1. Consiclcri ng the \veath cr it \Yas noth- ing short of remarkable that tl1e gan1e \vas as fast as it vvas and the pitching so steady. Coach Dawson picked Humn1er to start the gan1e. How long- any one pitcher -vvould last \Vas itnpossib1e to tel1. None of then1 \verc old 'varsity n1en of experience. None had pitchec1 n1ore than a few inning-s at a tilne. ... -\t best it seemed as thoug·h, \Vhatever pitcht'r w·ent in, he \vould not last O\'\Cr fonr innings.

THE SECOND BASKETBALL LEAGUE rrhe fight for recognition 'vhich the smaller colleges of the East have been 'vaging-for the· -past three years has at last resulted in the -proposal by the Inter-collegiate League to form a second league composed of St. Law- renee, Colgate, Rensselaer Polytechnic In- stituter Rochester, Syracuse, New York Un- iversity, the College of the City of New York, cide the chan1pionsbip of the East.

From an athletic stand- point, the proposed league \vould seetn to be a splendid thing, looking at it from every standpoint.

12 THE CONOORDIENSIS AN u·NUSUAL ·END (Accepted for the Literary Contest) I first 1net Simeon Burr in the grade school, where vre soon becatne very intimate. I wondered \'rhy it was ~that everybody con- sidered him a fooL He was, it is true, not like other boys. vVith his moody, thoughtful ex- pression, aln1ost bordering on. surliness, :he see1ned to ·shun the society of the rest of ns. In the classroon1 he was a doubting Thon1as. The teachers disliked him, probably because he got on ttheir n·erves by his rigid cross-exatnin- iug, and he in turn held the teachers in con- ten1pt, because they disliked what he called thoroughness. I-Iowever~ he and I got along very well together. His originality and queer- ness seetned to have a strange fas·cination for n1e. Sitn never took anything for granted. 'Phere is where he differed fron1 the n1ajority of us. .~VIost of us. a·re ·too lazy to investigate an~d v·erify, -vve ·n1erely svvallo,v whatever is doled out to us, and -vve ridicule the one who takes pains to verify to his O\vn sa.ti,sfaction the as- sertions of so-caUed authoriti.es. Sitn said the auuhorities w·ere generally ·correct in their fundamentals, but why any reasoning hutnan being should be compelled to accept the con- dus·ions drawn from them by som·eone else, he could not see. The trouble with poor Burr was that he persi1sted in thinking in his own vvay, instea<i of following ~the well beaten path \~f C·onvention. H enc'e ~he \Vas a fool, an out- Last. It was but natural that Burr should get o. long poorly in school. He was not the one F:i ve conditions at the very start ':vas too tnttch, so Burr's father thought. He decided tha:t it would be betrter for Sin1 to go into busi- ness. I n1ust say I hated th·e prospect of con- tinuing without hitn. l-Ie oflten told n1e that I was ~the only one \V hose oo1npanionship he likedJ!. .. Poor fellow, he was n1isunderstood by everybody, of that I was convinced. Deep ·.I down. :in rny heart, I knew he was the better n1an, y·et 1ny reoorcl in school -had al \Va ys been superior to his. How,ev-er, Sim took it all cheer :Fun y and told me on the quiet that he hadn'';t the faintest notion of going into busi- ness afte-r vacation. D:tt:ring our .spare time, Sin1 and I had constructed in his father's barn, a ·crazy look- ing affair thart Shn 'iVas pleased to call a flying nTacll!i·ne. It was northing like anybody else ever ¥1a·d tnade, or even seen ·before. Sin1 had his O\vn ideas about aeroplanes, and he heart- ily disagreed w1,th all the 1nodern designers. He to·ok the house fly as hi.s model, and by ca refu:l study. he had dravvn up what to us at least, seen1ed a plausible plan. I was at first only a spectator, hut as tin1e 'vent on, and as I applaadecl his effor;ts, he dec:ided to take n1e into JJartnership. I had nothing to say about the rna.tter; as soon as Sitn 1nade up his tnind to have me, he just said so, and that encl·ed it~ On account of Sin1 I often suffered ridi- cule -at the hands of my fatnily.

Long before daybreak on the 27th of June. we carried our machine to a large field about a half mile frorn the house.

The change in the p~ edge was n1ade that a pledge might be had \vhich was satisfac- tory to every member of of the faculty. Some of the professors refused to recognize the former pledge but these say that the new one will be satisfactory. All the amend- ments are to remedy some of the minor de- fects which were alleged to exist in the forn1er constitution. 1'he amendments fol- lo\v : Article I, Section I amended to read, '' In order to make his exatnination or test valid, each student sha11, at the end of his paper, sign the fo11ow·ing· declaration :-~ I pledge my 11onor that during this examina- tion I have neither given nor receiv-ed aid, and that I have reported or \vill report any vio1ation of the Honor System \vhich comes under my notice.'\ Added to Article I, Section II, ''The use of any paper other than that distributed by the examiner sha11 be considered pritna facie evi- dence of fraud. '' Article I, Section III added to read: '' No student shall have books or note books on his desk during the test or examination unless so s peci:fiecl by the examiner.\ Article JI, Section I\r, n1ade Article I I, Section vT, and Article II, Section I\r added: '• No student shall leave the room n1ore than tbree titnes during- a test or examination, nor for a period longer than ten n1inutes, nor under any circntnstances shall g·o to his \ roon1. --:0:,-- The first events of the interclass track n1eet ·w111 be run off totnorrow· afternoon on the college oval.

THE ALUMNI DEPARTMENT \Vhcn the Concorcliensis Board elections \vcre held last tcrn1, it ''Tas c1ec1c1ed to create t\YO 11C\\' depart1nents \vith editors \\rho should look aftc'r the obtain-in.~· anc1 the accuracy of the ne\YS in each of these clepart111cnts.

It is in re- .~·arc1 to the ah1n1ni c1epart1nent that \Ye · ,,·ish to say a \vorc1. In the past we h aye pn b- lishecl bnt little alumni nc\vs for the silnple re~ts > n that \\·c were nn~:t1)1c to o hta in an\T.

The Concordiensis is not lin1itecl in its Clr- culation to the underg-raduate body but goes to 1nany alumni vvho are perhaps more inter- ested in the alumni ne·ws than in the current happenings on the Hill. \Ve feel that, such being the case, 1ve ought to endeavor to print a certain an101111t of this ne-vvs in ever~· issue and should do our best to make thi~ departn1ent a permanent thing. To be snre, it is at present in the experimental staKe, bn t it seems that \vith the help of the students, the alun1ni dcparttnent can be 1nade one of the fixtures of the Concorcliensis ancl can an- S\YCr a definite den1and for alurnni ne\YS on the part of the graduates. rrhc Boarc1 ain1S to enlarge this dcpart- lnent ancl to give it its proportionate an1onnt of space in our pag-es if \Ve can be snre of ohtaining fresh and accurate ahu11ni notes \\yith \vhich to fi11 the space. And that is as far as the Board can go. The alumni editor has peen \Vorking hard this tenn to supply this ne\VS hin1self, but no one man. can c..lo all the \\york. So tnany of the students kno,y of alun1ni \vho ha vc done sotne notable \vork oT something \\·orthy of notice 1n the stuc1cnt publication of their A ln1 a l\Iater.

When there \vere no en- o·ao·en1ents to be ke1}t, ''Dandy'' could be seen ,\-! c.._, absorbed in his la\v books. He loved to handle the massive morocco bound volumes anc1 took keen delight in hurling a vociferous bon1bast of legal non1enclature at his less fortunate fellow students. '' Dandy '' be- catne not unfamiliar w·ith the inticacies of the hnv, and this consideration earned for him the appelation, \The nig-ht school attorney.'' Furthermore he had taken a course in law with a correspondence school and \vas avvarded a diplorna, engraved in Latin, \vhich con1d bear comparison to the \ Dip'' of any insti- tution in the country.

The Dramatic Club 1nade its annual al)- pearance 11onc1ay Night, in its production of I' The Sno\;vball,'' at the 1Vlo11a\vk Theatre. The affair \Yas a huge success and \vas su- peri or to the club's ~fforts of 1ast :y·ear in the san1e proportion -vvith the progress of all enion activities. The audience vvas not as large as the manager anticipated, alth.ough the orchestra seats were almost all taken. The night was rainy and it is to hoped that this \vas the onlv reason that kent the audi- • < cnce frorn being of standing-room-only size. E yerybody that ·was there had the best kind of a titne and enjoyed every n1innte. The audience \vas very appreciative and ,c.~p­ p1auded the boys roundly. The students packed the front ro-vvs and at intervals c he~red ancl sang. the good old songs. T0e co11ege~ orchest~·a \vas· in . the ·pit under the eli recti on of C. T. ·:WI ale '13 and rendered a p- propriate nn1sic. '\ rrhe Sno\V Ball'' \iVaS a three-act comedy ancl the scene ·was laid in the Featherstone House. rrhe drawing roon1 in the act gave suspicion that the son of the honsehold 'vas a Union student and had sent horne some of Gunning's unsurpassab1e banners and blank- ets. The action in brief \\vas this: Felix Featherstone intends to play a litt1e joke on his \vife and incidentally teach her a lesson. Uncle John has a prese11Hn1ent that things win not turn out ·well and in a \vay he is right for Mrs. Featherstone is a match for her husband and turns the trick on him. The joke assumes tren1endous co1nplications to Felix and gat11ers size and impetus like a rolling snO\V ball until fh1:a1ly Felix is pro- perly punished and penitent. There were seven characters and to which one in particular belongs the spoi1 is a pro- ble1n.

Santee '16 \\·as the ideal of the ba1c1-heac1ec1 ro\v. Ethel G-ranger was be\vitc hing and it \\ras plain to see that ''Dick '' did not have to '' put on '' n1uch in lo\rer' s role.

Don Hutchens '13 had the heavy part as far as the men \\vere concerned. He had a lot to remember and a number of entrances, all of vvhich he handled in an excellent man- ner. The part was a good one but could easily have been overdone. Don was equal. t:o the occasion and kept the audience in good humor throughout. George 'Vadsvvorth '14 \vas the original and perfect '' Uncle ] ohn. '' '' \\Vaddy '' is funny, any\vay, and given the part of a crabby, suspicious o1r1 lT ncle, he \Yas nnsur- . passable.

It \vas their efforts that kept the club together for four long months anc1 straightened out the n1any difficulties that arose. J nst a \Yord ahont the coach, ~I r. Simon J. Leake. He has coached the club for two years and is well li1ced by aH xvho kno\v him. This year he had an up-hill fight against ntany disappointn1ents but persisted until he got the play into shape. Mr. Leake gave the n1en a thorough drill in little details and finishes that ·were so splendidly accomplished Monday night that perhaps they escaped ob- sel·vation. The only criticism, if it be one, is that the play had too fe-vv characters. The ''Studes\ would ha-ve liked to have seen more feUo\vs have parts. Leake preferred a play \Vi th more characters but '' Snow Ball \ vvas selected because it was the intention of the club to n1ake quite a number of trips. It would have been rather difficult and expen- sive to carry many more than seven n1en and so that is \Vhy the parts \Yere limited.
