.. -,--- VoL. XII. UNION COL.LEGE, JUNE, 1889. No.9· BACC '\LAUREATE. STEWARDSHIP OF ONE'S SEI\F. The design of this para hle is to show that the stnallness of an endowtnent does not eKcuse one for neglecting to itnprove it. The one talent man, as weH as the five talent, teceived a trust proportionate to his ability. He did not have as rnuch capital, but he was not c 1pable of handling as n1uch. Nor was he required to produce as tnuch, A return upon .otle talent : was all that was asked of hitn. He was con- detnned, not because he failed to hand back ten, or four, but two. Or, ntther ~ because he failed to hand back any interest, or proceeds what .. ever. He would not have been held to the sarne rate of increase as his fellow-stewards, for a \ sn1all capital cannot comn1and the sarne oppor- tunities as a large. Men buy re·al estate in a growing part of a city, hold it five or ten years and n1ake a fortune ; and the world praises their foresight and shrevvdness; it rnay be justly,. tho' their neighbors were quite as wise, lacking only the capital with which to buy and hold. \ The rich tnan's wealth is his strong city.,\ but \ the destruction of the poor is their poverty.\ rfhey lUU_St buy-- flour by the pounJ, coal by the bu5hel, clothing on credit, all at the highest price and on the hardest tenns. Still the duties of prudence and economy rest upon the poor as heavily as upon the rich; as heavily, not rnore so, tho' we are always talking econorny to the poor and liberality to the rich. Both are alike stewards, and \ it is required in stewards that a n1an be found faithful.\ Not that the steward on daily wages do what the steward should who has five n1illion dollars., or half a n:1illion, or a quarter, but that each be conscientiolJS in using what he has. ~'Unto whotnsoever rnuch is given of hitn shall 1nuch be required\ ; this our Lotd says. will be his standard of judgtnent at the last ; and he says we recognize the propriety of it universally ; '' to who1n 1nen have com- :tnitted tnuch, of him they will ask the more.\ '\If the1'e be fi:rst a willing n1ind,\ not to give only, but to accept our stewardships and live accordingly, then ~' it is accepted according to that a tnan hath, .and not according to that he hath not.\ This obviously just principle per- vades the entire divine governtnent. When it is asked to sutn up the law of God, this is his ansV\rer: '' Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy soul, and with all th_y n1ind, and with all thy strength.\ You and I are not ex- pected to love with the powers of a Paul, ?r a John, a Luther or a Milton, but with all our own powers. The child's unintelligent, cling- ing affection is quite as precious to us as the wiser and tnore critical affection of maturity. And on the other hand it is harder to find the child cold and distant than to find the rnan so. We expect from. each what each is adapted to give ; .and the shock is quite as great to n1iss sitnple confidence on the one hand as deliberate regard on the other. So God will have from each of us all the love our hearts can give ; but he will never blatne us, n1uch less condetnn us, because our natural capacity for love is sn1all. 1~hat capacity is hZ:sgift; the full use of it is our stewardship; and for this only can we be held responsibl.e. To have five talents or one talent is not our concern ; but only to itnprove what we have fi-otn God's hand. Now there are three standards of use set forth in the parable. The first is sin1ply not to de- stroy or vvaste ; to be able to say, when an ac- counting is required : \ Lo, here thou hast that is thine.\ In other words, sitnply not to be a prodigal. In fact, this is a stage below that of the one-talent servant, for he did not take his Lord's n1.oney, use it in business, keep all the

:I 45 T'HE ,CONCORDIENSIS. --~~----------- ----- ---- ---------- ------------------.- ]Hofit and hand back the bare talent at last. I-Ie returned the identical coin, which had not been tot~<ched n1eanwhile. If he n1ade no profit for }Q is n1aster, he tnade none for hitnself. But be- ' 1ow this is the absolute waste of \vhat is entrust- ed to the steward. So the prodigal son spent ]:drs substance in riotous living. l-Ie very soon h:ctd 11othing for hin1self or anyone else. And at the other extren1e is the faithful and wise use of · .one's endovnnent, \vhich will enable hin1 to say ~t tl\le iast: \Lord thy five talent~ have be- con:1e ten, thy two talents four.\ thetn at alL Yet how superior they are to tnoney ! HoV\r n1uch n1ore evidently ~' talents \ within the Lord's meaning l llow rnuch t.nore widely distributed, indeed universally! Ilow rnuch less·skill it takes to use thern, and reap their benefits! How n1uch rno1ie certain the re- turn ! Yet it is a striking conlinent on the real value of n1on.ey that we usually think of lt only in connection with this parable. And eYen n1ore striking still that when the Lord wished to speak of the whole tnatter of stewardship, he found no better illustrati:on than the talents. As Solot11on had said centuries before, \Money answereth ali thing~.\ We express alnzost all vah1es in tcrn1s of dollars. The worship of tnoney is indeed both vulgnr a ncl wicked ; but not less so is the conte1npt of it. It is the world's 1nediun1 of exchange; the tneasure wherein, by cotnn1on consent, vve express the estitT1ate in \V hich we hold our choicest treas- ures. Its acquisition is the tnaster-tnotive of the world. 1~hose vvho are indifferent to it for its own sake, vvant it for what it will do for thcn1, ancl en~tble then1 to do for others. Those \vho vvillingly forego its enjoytnents and advantages, still t\u·e anxious to 111~1ke provision for their children's having then1 ailer they are gone. Now it ,is not of rnoney exclusively, nor in- c:!lieed especially, that I desire to speak this even- ing-. Ste\vardship is by no n1eans lin1ited to }J'H)perty. It e1nbraces equally titne, opportu- 11ity, talent of eve.ry sort. If you are a poor 1nan in good hc<llth, that health is as n1nch your t;den t as your rich neighbor'.s n1oney is his. If you are a person of leisure, ti n1c is your partic- uLa endowtnent, and your are boun.d to ask ooncerning each hour \vhether it is put at inter- es.t or buried in the earth. If you h<n'e learning, the q_uestion is at vvhose service you are holding it, your own, or your Lord's. If you have a voi:oe to sing; a hand to chann tnnsic out of · 'keys OT strings ; an eye to discern beauty and skill to create it; the question of judgn1ent is vvlijether your n1aster and vour fello\v-n1en are • w r-e£tpi ng any benefit frotn your voice and hand ttnd eye, or whether you feel at liberty to use tl1€n1 entirely for your own pleasure. If you tutve inherited or acquired refinetnent, pleasing a~Uhess, elegant rnanners, you \vill be called to say at the last whether you used them sin1ply to n1ak.e yourself popular, or also to turn that pop- ularity to accoutit for lnunan \velf~tre, getting Rear n1en to guide and cotnfort thetn, ancl above all to point thetn to it. If you have personal b·cauty, that n1ost transient yet coveted chann, a11d which \Vins its way everywhere to hun1an hearts, he sure the Lord will require at last \vl\I:ether you have Llsed it tncrely to gain adtnira- ti on and feed yourself on flattery, or to clothe a h·eart of love, and through your exernplifi- cc:Jtion of Jesus to win n1en to hin1. Such thi11gs as these are to seldon1 thought of as \tal- e.nts \ within the 1neaning of the parable ; vve too seldon1 feel that our stewardship touches Now this very G1ct of the universal desire for and appreciation of tnoney goes far to secure a right stevvardship of it. Carried to an extren1e, indeed, it defeats; that stewardship, for it tnakes n1en nJisers, refusing to acknowledge that there is any clain1 upon their property, htunan or di~ vine, beyond their own. But this side of that extren1e it is entirely healthful. It fixes atten~ tention upon property. It secures a high esti~ 1nation of it. It tnakes the handling of it soletnn business, for which even the trivial feel that they n1ust sotne day render an account. And herein there is a reasonable degree of fidelity in this fonn of stewards;hip. We deplore that so n1any n1en hold and tnanage their tnoney selfish- ly; that so rnuch less is given than the needs of lnitnanity and religion require. We figure out that this cause or that gets only a half cent a year frotn each n1an and won1an and child. And it is possible in this way to n1ake a very n1elancholy showing, and conclude everybody r

On1itting all victin1s of accidents and contagions and epide,rnics, how few keep their bodily powers as long and as efficient as they rnight! How few of us ~here this 1norning, should the Lord con1e and ask an account of our physi- stingy and selfish\ But such is not the fact. The cases are legio11.. They are all supported, n1ost of thetn liberaHy. The generous people are runn berless. l\r1oney flows by into a tnulti- tude ()f treasuries. And there is other steward- ship .of n1oney than giving it avvay. Its wise use is _as in1pera:tive. The good of ourselves .and our households tnust be subserved by it. Loolc over the world, and you vvill see a tnulfitude of five and two talent servants who, ·. cal endowtnent, would be able even to say, \Lo here thou hast that is thine.\ We have wasted our bodies. We have squandered health. We have been self~ind ulgent in food and drink,. in sleep ancl labor and pleasure. We are not as fat· as 1noney goes, are laboring conscientious- I ly to Ket usury for their Lord. Let us turn now frotn this to a far wider and tnore irnportant stewardship-fro.rn tnoney to onrsehres. The question I raise at this thne is not vv l1at is out· standard of well-doing as to n1oney,. but as to ~urselves. Take the total that n1akes up ?LH ·personality, physical, tnental, n1oraL, natural endovvn1ents and acquired poV\ 7 - ers. What do vv e regard as our duty here? Hovv <:lo we feel that we ought to handle our- selves in view of our stewardship fron1 God? the ,1nen and \\vornen physically that vve ought to be at our age. We have not the substrattun of bodily vigor on which all 'our other activity and usefulness are conditioned. We 1nay have been econotnical ot our tnoney, but we have been prodigal of our bodies. So, too, of our tnental powers. God gave us strong tninds ; one fine logicai accurnen, another brilliant imagination, another accurate taste. vV e have fed our n1inds on garbage, not to say on poison. Their nerve is gone. Their n1uscle is flabby. The work we ask of thetn they can not do. We con1plain that we do not perceive the great truths of God as they are presented to us ; that we can Jzot believe this or that. It is true we can not ; not because of any innate de- fect, however, but because we have wasted our povvers. We have so long indulged our rninds with the trivial that they hctve lost aptitude for the tnotr.entous. We have kept then1 laughing so persistently that novv nothing looks serious. Should the tnaster require an accounting, we would have to say: ''There is no interest, and our capital is largely gone.\ The three standards still prevail, waste, re- te.ntiot1, itnprove tnent. I-I ow tnany of us are -vvasting ourselve ; not our tnoney ~but ou1~selves. The beautiful innocence of childhood is gone. We say, and truly enough, that it is in1possible to keep it intact ~1:r11id the struggles and ten1pta- tions. of life. But there is surely no need to throw it away. We are not co1npelled to rub the blootn of the peach violently, even though handling n1ust needs sotnevvhat in1pair it. We are Rot bound to blunt the sensibility of youth by 'W~tnton indulgence in itnpure speech, unclean reading, salacio11s thoughts. We tnay not be abl:e to guard the l1eart against all intrusion, but we need not throv-v open every door and let un- clean beasts riot wi'thin. Yet how con11nonly we do just that. And when the Lord cornes and requires this talent cf positive purity, it is gone. We not only have failed to in1prove it; we ha ye squandered it. We are not even able to say : \Lo here thou hast that is thine.\ So of very n1uch else that 1nakes up our origi- nal endowtnent. Take health, for exan1ple ;· a blessing that, as we truly say, we never prize until we have lost it. Of course, we can not alw:ays be vvell. Sickness cotnes in the order of nature. The bodily powers are not in1n1ortal; So just once n1ore of the centre of personalty, the u.;z\ll. What a n1ajestic power this is, as God bestows it! What stean1 is to the locotno- tive; what the rudder is to the ship ; vvhat the sun is to the solar systetn ; all this, and n1ore, the will is to the n1an. IZept, trained, nurtured, de.veloped, it n1akes one easily tnaster of hirn- self and largely n1aster of his environtnent; frittered away, it leav~s one a chip on the ocean's tides. And it is so easily wasted! as easily as health, as easily as n1oney ! Allow yourself to go on undecided., letting the vvill have the poise. Indulge yourself in fickleness, never

Alas! true once n1ore; the etnotions are pain- fully stir:ced ; the tnind clearly perceives the need of the supply, but the will is gone ; there is not enough power to left to stretch out the hand for the pardon Jesus offers. And the rnan who has been prodigal of this rarest treasure of his being stands at last atnid heaven's bounties. This it is to waste ourselves. Now we tnust not f:-til to note that here the n1iddle course can not be taken. As to our- selves, sitnple retention is itnpossible. There is either advance or retrogression. Our 1noney we 1nay lay away, or buTy in the ground, and years afterward recover it unchanged. B:ut we are changing daily. 'Ve are either better. or worse than we were a year ago, or ten years. Our bodies are less efficient vehicles for our souls, or tnore efficient. Our rninds are less capable of grasping great truths, or n1ore capa- ble. Our wills are weaker or stronger. We can not retnain stationery. 1\'he plant is either growing or dying: and so are we. No 1na.tter when we are called to account, we can never say of ourselves, \ I return just what was en- trusted to n1e ; I have neither tnade nor lost; Io, here th~u hast that is thine.\ Yet this is precisely what those are expecting to do who deny all stewardship of thetnselves as they do all need of Christ, and, ~'Well, I have not wasted n1y powers or tny opportuni- ties ; I have never been a prodigal ; n1y original endown1ent is intact; if I have no investrnent to present to the Lord, I have no lo~s to latnent; I have never 1nade any clai1n to be tnore faith- ful than others ; I have never chosen ] esus as my Lord ; but I have tried to do about right as a n1an an1ong tnen, and I think I cai1 face the judgtnent undistnayed.\ Ah, beloved, but where is your increase? Where the usury of yourself P Has the Master no right to require this? ]f you could return yourself to hitn just as you c::ttne forth, would that be enough? If you coultl produce yourself at the accounting as the servant in the parable did the buried coin, t:ou'ld it accept just that? Would you in si tnilar circutnstances? With all the tnoney and labor and ca1•e you are spending upon your child, would you be satisfied if ttt 2o yea1~s of age he retnained just what he was at six? Haven't you a right to interest on your inveshnent? And has not God the sa1ne right? Is there anything that will satisfy your con- science except ten talents in plaoe of five, four in place of two? And how strange that we shouTd ·Confess this obligation in everything .else more readily than in religion ! We would not ask a friend even to loan us his 1noney without interest. We are uneasy if a day passes in which we are not learn- ing SOlnething. We take ourselves to task if we squander a dollar, or an :hour ; if we allow one garn1ent to be tnoth eaten,. one .foaf of bread to mold. Yet in religion, if we are not actual spendthrifts we are content. [f we have not utterly thrown away our spiritual inheritance we go on unconcerned. Ren1ernber, the servant who could say what we can not, '' Lo, here thou hast what is thine,'' was cast into the outer darkness. Only those who presented their cap .. ital with interest entered into the joy of their Lord. Young gentlemen of the graduating class: Whatever other thought you tnay have about the education you have been acquiring in your four years here at college, I beg you not to forget, in relation to it, your stewardship toward God.

An:d ste\V· ardship mot of your ·education alone or chiefly, but of yourselves; of that manhood in which your education is a large, though by no rr:reans, the only factor. That you have been through college n1ay give you a tetnporary and factitious importance in the eyes of some people; but yotl will soon learn, if you do not know already, that it can never insure success in life. It gives you, indeed, a great .advantage ; not the advan- tage of having a little tnore knowledge of lan- guage and science and 1nathe1natics :than the the tnaj<.>rity of your fello\Vv-tnen possess.; this counts for little ; but the advantage of having trained rninds and disciplined wills; of being able to command your powers and put then1 to such service as you choose. You have a sttonger and nobler 1nanhood, if you have been faithful in your college course, than you cou1d have had otherwise. And this is the real, I n1ight aln.1ost say, the only real thing. This, rightly used, rneans success. You ought to rnake tnore tnoney than others. You ought to reap larger rewards in tnedicine, at the bar, upon the press, in public life. You ought :to be tnore influential and honored 1ninisteTs of t~e­ ligion. You should find tnore happiness antl tnore prosperity in life because of your four years within the walls of Old Union. You have earned this reward; it is justly yours. Written when visiting Union Union Co1lege at Commencement in '84, and read at a reception given to President Harrison K.

I feel sure you will not do it.. I feel sure you will use youtselves generously in the spirit of a broad hutnanity and a divine love. Then, when the day of account- ing cornes, you will not say sullenly: \ Lo, thou hast thine own, '' but joyfully, \ Behold, I have doubled all tny endowtnent in using it faithfully for thee, tny Lord.

Class Address. In an :etnergency, a poet without a then1e, :a n1instrel without a n1use, a singer without a song, are no n1ore to he pi;tied than an ad- dresser without an address. And this evening, f1·iends and classtnates, I an1 a n1ost worthv ob- \' Ject of your tendet;est syn1pathies and cotnpas- . SlOBS. I would be silent to-night had not the occa- sion compelled tne to speak, and j~ust as Anthony, who w.as a \ plain, blunt tnan,\ but who loved his friend, was so powerfully rnoved at Cresar's funeral, so I-without \ wit, words or worth, action or utterance ''-on a n1ore vivacious occa- sion, atn protnpted to show forth sotnething of rny feelings. I would that I could turn to you the troubled days of tny senior vacation and bid then1 speak for n1e. They would put a tongue in every one of those thousand fruitless eflorts of mine to write an address that would enliven up your spirits and tnove even the disordered cobble stones of this ancient city, to give place for an asphalt pave1nent. The cruel hand of ti1ne presses heavily on us at this cotntnencernent day. With saddened heart and tearful eye we receive the unwelcon1e sutntnons that bids us frotn a happy life to a world of care. For four years, with cotnn1on interests, disappointinents ctncl pleasures we have shared each other's lives, and while the spirit of-~' the past will live around us,\ in the future still the reality of those happy days of association and inti1nacy is fled and gone for- ~ver. We will often long to hear Old Union's l1alls once Inure ringing with our cheerful songs, and to see her grey walls once tnore vibrating with our lively fun. But for us they are ever silent; graver sounds and sterner sights await us in the storn1y, troubled world. Those strong bands that have bound our little fleet so closely together while in this peaceful harbor of training and discipline, tnust now be loosed, and each of u:s n1 ust brave life's high seas of usefulness and acti v j ty-alone. The parting is indeed with sorrow, and yet the conditions under which we separate are tno.st cheerful. Unlike the launching offrail ships on the perilou'l ocean, our departure on the ternpest- tossed sea of Hfe is with preparation and equip- age, and like tnighty ocean vessels with tried rudders and perfect heln1s, we take up our life's journey ~,rith the full assurance that with the engineering arn1 and watchful eye vve will gain our {.lesi red port in safety. But we are not now to rest upon our oars while vvaiting for the approaching storrns. This hour is detern1ining our future course in life and establishing our eternal destiny. It is an hour for which we have long been working, instruct- ors striving, parents praying. An hour full of hopes, rich in prospects, abundant in opportu- nities, and one upon the decisions of which de- pen.d the quality of our lives, the nature of our sucoesr, the character of our renown and the extent of our usefulness to our fellown1en, our country and our God. :Life at this critical tno- n1ent is, to us, itnpressive in its grandeur, startling in its realities, fearful in its responsi- biliti:es, and it calls tor all our achieved ability to direct and govern its 1nighty forces away frorn the enticing \vhirlpools of wastefulness and evil into the channels of highest usefulness and of greatest good. The best part of our lives has by no n1eans been spent; it has in reality just begun. 1~he boundaries of our past success have he en 1i tni ted by the book and class-roon1, but the possibilities of our future are illi1nitable and ·without encl. There are unrivaled princi- ples in profession, unkno\vn truths in cotninerce, undiscovered laws it1 political governtnent, hid- den treasures in society and tnorality, all of which are vvaiting in countless nun1bers for sotneone to reveal thetn to the needy,. anxious world. Before and round about us there are n1yriads of voices urgently calling for honest, thoughtful, broadn1inded, educated tnen; n1en who will, in their chosen departn1ents, give their life and labor to the cause of truth and right. May h tunanity's fingers of ridicule and scor11 never be defiantly pointed to one of us while it is said \ he heard tny anxious cries but

Let us fron1 this age glowing with the exatnples and achievetnents of great tnen, and frotn this hour, golden with opportunities and brilliant with prospects, fashion our highest ideals and detennine to 1nake the ·world and lnunanity better for our having lived.

But the end will crown our W()rk in life as surely as it has our achieven1ents in .college- but it is for us to say what that end shall be.

The beauty .and grandeur of our crown of reward at the end of life will be but the reflections of our life's perseverence and labor.

Your prophet not being privileged by titne in its unchecked course, to devote the passing hours in n1aking use of his stilus with the dexterity ancl digit tnanipulation of son1e hoary haired prophet of long ago, asks indulgence frotn you, lest in your wrath, you hurl the weapon of conten1pt at hitn. Thus the necessary qualifications for a prophet are nutnerous indeed. He tnust possess clair- voyant powers, peregrinating capacities and a thick epidennis. And now, as the prophet stands before you the \observed of all observers,\ he is in sooth the tnost protninent tnan in the place. As he leaves by the back door after he bas concluded his prophecy in a peroration that glowed and scintillated in exuberant redundancy, he is cognizant that he has a host of enen1ies; for he has enunciated rnany pitiful tales in his expatia- . ating are the pleasures of the world, let us re- Inetnber tnan's highest nature, his noblest and chiefest end; let us live for llitn \vho owns our life and who crowns our death.

I5I THE CONCORDlENSIS. And now~ as the intoxicating tnelodies of your prophet's tnusical voice have been tbe cause of · the pitter patter of hurrying feet to this. n1ost glorious place, and as the gay,, bubhii ng and often trickling laughter of the coy tnaiden, together with the vociferous,, guffawing of the boisterous youth, add to the j.oyous joyousness of : joyosity, bursting forth in a hundred different ·- - ·--- __ ...:...._ __ ---~----------- -------------- siT11ple-rninded children of nature listened with attentive ears, and carne down \Vith corn, peas, eggs, faH overcoats, stewed tripe, straw hats and stewed potatoes and other rural luxuries, which proved invaluable to the threadbare inhabitants. Thus we see Blessing obtained Oil \ tick\ what he :had no cash to pay for. Yelling •'So long\ at hirn, I seized :tny grip and continued 1ny per- arnbulations, I soon ·ran over a tnan, and in his ;! ways, strike the tytnpanutn of rny auricular appendages, I puU n1yself together in a: vain atten1pt at elucidation. But to begin. at the beginning. Upon leaving the classic walls of \Old Union\ and after turning tny back to Dorp, I entered upon the duties of life. My first pursuit in life was the study of law, and after a few years of hard labor I tnanaged to scrape together a few dollars, and being of a restless disposition I detennined to set out and look up the boys. Accordingly, I j u tnped on the first freight train that catne along, and securing the tnost protninent looking brake on the car, I seated 1nyself and started on tny journey. I n1ust per- haps, have been on the car about ten 1ninutes when, on looking through the darkness, I dis- cerned the figure of ·what was once a tnan, but now appeared a woe-b~gone specitnen of hutnani tv. With a '' forget-tne-not \ look on his face and a tear in his eye, he reached out his hand and faintly 1nunnured, \hello Pipe,\ Gentletnen, I instantly recognized that voice, that dear angelic voice, it was the astral voice of . Dick Can1eron. Gentle1nan Dick. I asked hitn where he had been and was surprised to learn that shortly after leaving college he had joined the Salvation Anny, had 1narried one of the sisters and had alreadv risen to the rank of captai1.1. During his recital the conductor appeat~ed and not being acquainted with that gentletnan I shouted So-long-Dick, and n1ade tny escape. After wandering around for a few weeks I acci- dentally ran across Blessing. Frank went into the lecture field, holding forth to large and fashionable audiences con1posed chiefly of intelli- gent savages, upon the science of agriculture illustrating his lE:cture with the stool and pail, and a superanuated hull's eye watch that would do nothing but tick ; to these discourses these dying tnotnents he confessed to tne that Barstow was occupying the exalted position of clergy- lnatl. Barsty, he said, would have 1nade a for- tune in no ti1ne, if he had lived in the blessed era when the protnise ·~'Ask and ye shall receiv.e,\ was fulfilled.; so well w~s his disposi- tion understood by his congregation, that they invariably left when he Jooked aska11t at thetn. This long speech ended the unfortunate's career, so dropping a tear I hastened on. The next man I tnet was Snovv, \ Beautiful Snow,\ Jessie Calculus Coheirrier Snow, he had invented the tnethod ofpl:acing Sinall cog-wheels in tla.e back teeth, for the more perfect Inastica- t'ionoffood. Bidding Snow good-bye I hastened to the next town. Thete I found Culver in a 'dying condition. After staying with hitn a few days I had the mournful satisfaction of closing one of his eyes. I say one, for the other per- sisted in staying open, and his interesting countenance, even in death, preserved that ineffable wink of intelligence, which so en1inently characterized hi1n atnong the liviQg. The next subject was a queer one, the poor unfortunate being Washburne. I really think he was the tnost abject specitnen of hutnanity the world ever produced-this resplendent huninary, like the fourth of July, had hi& first quarter, like a ruined spendthrift his last quarter and :like an otnnibus his full and en1pty. Y e gods., how glad I was to tnake tny escape.. I next tnet Conover. Ladies and Gentletnen. This subject is involved in doubt and obscurity. I next 1net Professor 'fhotnas W. \tV right and found hin1 to be the only authority we have tor believing that such an individual exists. Kissing each good-bye I hurried on n1y travels. After a two days' journey I catne upon Dorion. Phil was the card tnanipulator in the side show and after loosing ten dollars on the queen, I said good-bye

Ed had opened an insurance office shortly after ieaving college but failing to secure a ·good livelihood, had gone into a rnnseun1 whet~e he was doing the song and dance act :for the ossifi.ed l tnan and bearded lady. I left 11itn in his glory .•'\ and blew on. I then tnet J. 1-Ioward Hanson. Shortly after leaving college 1-Iow.ard opened a: law office, but as everybody knew as tnnch as he did, he left tbis, and the last I heard of hin1 he was peddling corn salve an1ong the heatl1en:s in South Atnerica. Of Voorhees and :Sirnpson I could ascertain nothing. About this titne wearying of the east and learning that the rest of . the boys had gone west, I stole a tnule frotn a canal boat and securing a new outfit at a -fh~e I proceeded on tny journey. As I was slowly riding over the tnountainous part of Southern California, I tnet Harder. He infonned rne that he and Stoller had gone west together in the vain hope that fron1 beneath the chaotic depths of this oblate spheroid they could . find sorne fossilliferous ren1ains that they could utilize in writing a book on the '~ Evohttion of the earth and its inhabitants.\ But h .. e went on to sav that Stoller had been shot while endeavor- \ ing to elucidate to a borderer, that he had evolved frotn an ape and that the only ren1iniscence of : hini was an inscription on a tomb stone, as fol- lows : 1'ute Stoller. The history of the individual is the epito1ne of the class to which it belongs. Retnarking that it was a very fitting one I put spurs to Bucephelus and on we sped. I next tnet Flanigan,. he was in the hospital suffering frotn consun1ption caused by excessive cigarette stnoking. Frotn him I lean1ed that John Lycurgus Ge-heitner Whalen had picked up a pin in a jewelry store, for which act the state had kindly given hiln board and shelter for ten years to con1e. I next n1et Wait. Nelson in a n1on1.ent of tnental abberration opened a news stand in Chicago for the sale of this pro- phecy and the last I heard of hiln, he was doing quite well, he being the sole agent. Frotn authentic sources I learned that Furn1an started in as a teacher but as the scholars knew n1.ore than he did, he sent in his resignation, and subsequently becatne tnusical director of the organs in a side show. Your prophet then turne<l his face toward hotne and during his horneward travels tnet Fah~grievc. Billy had passed an uneventful life his chief pursuit being the sale of hair oil. Persuading Billy to accotnpany tne, we c~une to vi'ew the classic walls of old Unton. Arriving here -vve were 1nuch surorised to find that Mike .. Nolan was superintendent of the grounds and buHdings; having .. succeeded Geotge Clute. We were both pleased to leatn fro1n Mike that under the careful guidance of President vVebster the college ranked with its old rivals Yale and Harvard. And now ladies and gentlemen, and brothers ofthe class ot '89,-trusting that your prophet has fulfilled the duties of his office up to the standard of your expectations he bids you fa,rewell. ED. S.

SIMPSO.\X '89. The Decline of Art. The characteristic sentitncnt of our XIXth century civilizRtion is one of cotnplacency. Walking upon a dizzy sun11nit, breathing an atlnospherc laden with n1astedy achieven1ents in the reaJn1s of science, we look down the '\vinding p£lth or ascent with scorn-and above, into the infinite regions yet to be senrched with defiance. We forget that decades, generations and centuries, ns they con1e and go, ~lre after all but as the tun1blcrs in the circus. They, too, fon11 a· cohunn, not only of n1en, but of 1nan's ach ieven1ents. Upon the shoulders of the XVIIIth. century the XIXth has tnounted. It peers a little farther into the rnysterious ex- panses before it than did its in1n1:ediate prede .. cessor-· yet after all the stern fact still ren1ains, that to the one as well as the other, the horizon issues Hre peretnptory con11nand-'' Thus far and no farther ·shalt thou go!\ Etnerson has beautifully said that ''an individual life is a su.c- cession of 111oods strung upon ten1peran1ent \- so it is with the life of the race, but break the stt·ing and the precious beads are scattered npon Tirne's infinite ocean, whose flood tide never re-. turns what· the ebb has borne away. If then, with all our boasted independence, we are so dependent, surely it ill becornes us to alTo- gantly treat centuries long gone by. Ere we could enjoy the fruits of the present, sotne rug- ged, honest soul n1ust have guided with patient ha.nd the ploughshare-sotne beneficent Provi- dence n1u.st have pronounced his gr::1cious bene- diction of showers and sunshine. Let us rather act the part of the wise tnan, who, now and then, witl?draws frotn the hurly-burly of life to cast the balance of his nobler self, and, if he finds a deficit, traces it to the cause that he tnay intelligently apply a ren1edy. ...J\dopting this couTse, our own virtues will ~1ppear less-those of others greater. We shall find that in sotne things-in one thbzg-Art, or, rather, the Artistic sentitnent, the despised past far out- shines the glorious present. The cause of this L'lct will be the subject for our brief considera- tion. First of all, then, our century is one of nlate- rial progress and developrnent. Alas ! in the vvorld's arena, in the battle-field of life, our ears are forever rent with the shout, '' Down Eros ! u·p Mars!\ fro1n the vast throng of htnnanity as it rushes on to its glittering goal, the goal which V\'ben reached proves to be the fool's gold of falsehood, which cru1nbles under our touch, in= stead of the pure, unalloyed n1etal of 1'ruth. Material progress, I bave said, chantcterizes the age, but above it an inexorable despot, rul..: ing with an iron hand, sits Intellect.

History of '89. The dass o.f '89 ho!lcts a peculi~1.t place in the history of 'Union Colleg-e. Since the thtrk days ofold Union are pass~cl we n1ay speak of then1 without reserve. When tbl'e class of '89 catne here it seetned to hring\'.ill- 1 l!uck, for instead of getting a president~ ns all of us had expected~ vve were dootned to 1nonths oc hope and <loubt. Year follo\reJ year with affairs grovving tnore latnentable, threatening- clouds began to thicken around the good old college, hut never diJ '89 lose hope or confidence in the ultin1ate success of Alina Mater. In truth during the first three years of our course hope was a n1aai:.t with ns; it ro-.;c in our breasts everv dav; vve felt instinctively that vve w ~ ~ would he iN college to ha i:t the advent of s~Hnc hero as president, to cheer the dawn of Union's bright days. We kne\V tbait t~1e college n1ust be at the turning point in its cycle~ just as \Ve learned in our books of the earth in its course around the sun, when in the hlea'k days of Decetnber it reaches the farthest point in its orbit and turns and tnakes for the sunnv davs of \ .. Juile. And our fondest wishes were realized. Perhaps there were tin1es when our zeal and despair tnac.le us act in a hasty tn:tnner. We do not purpose to defend all our conduct while in college. It we ever shocked the good sense of our friends 've arc sorry for it~ and plead extretne provocation and youthful hot blood. At any rate we have \vbat we desire<l-a President, and just the one of our choice. 1.,... ou \vill con1e across ve.ry perverse tnen in college~ but the tnost perverse fellowr. that ever entere(l the blue gate would, if he had sufficient counlge~ slap Dr. Webster on the h(lCk and cry \Bully boy Prex.

Confidence and contenttnent have been upon every f~tce. ~confidence in the n1an \vho is at the heln1, .a u:d a finn belief _in the future pros- perity ·of the college already so auspiciously begun. NeveT were the hopes of Union brighter and success 1no1·e assut:ed than to-day. Nor is this ~aid fro.tn 2ln unfounded burst of enthusiastn, but frotn tNuni stakable signs and cold facts. Now since an this is true it cannot be out of :; place, and if it is you should pardon a history . \vhich deals onl:y ·with truth, if we recall sotne of .' the dark sce:n.es that '89 passed through in antici- pation of the glorious present. Darkest of all perhaps and :tnost vivid in our 1nen1ory is that January rnidbight n1arch in '88 through the tnost blinding, the heaviest snovvstonn, we verily believe, that ever struck the g~ocl old city of Schenectady. It see1ned to typify the hazy con- dition of the college, while we represented the defenders of sornethi ng or other, we knew not what, as we tn1dged along alrnost buried in snow. Nevertheless vve 1nanaged to start a fire that night and Jell ourselves hoarse in the vain expectation o:f awakening the sleepy delinquents n1iles and tniles disbtnt. Inasn1uch as the traces of war l1e1Ve disappeared vve n1ay tell those who wonder what we are talking about that on that eventful d~.y we were a little angry at a body of gentle tnen, the Board of T'rustees, for faiEng to elect a president. It vvas indeed a nH~morable day. In the afternoon was held the stonny n1ass 1neeting in Powers building. There gathered wha.t sect11ed like a band of patriot rebels about to declare war on oppression. Neither the French States-General nor the Con- tinental Cong1~ess in all their vebetnence can be con1pared wiH1 the spirited body then asse1nbled -for exactly what no one seen1ed to know. Huddled all t<>gether in Prof. lloflinan's room suspense an.d <l'etennination upon every face. With difficulty the chainnan brought the indig- nant throng to son1e degree of ordet. Then without a tn-()tion to that etlect we proceeded to take into cons.ideration the afHtirs of Union College. 'lTp jun1ped one patriot of'89, the redoubtable, he only, the tnathetnatical, ethical, astronotnical, g,eological Conover, whose, patriot.istn gleatned frotn his eyes like :the reel hot glance of the tiger when it spring:£ for its prey,. whose entire bear- ing, whose straightened nruscles bespoke intense feeling. \Unconditional imi11·ediate holt,\ he cried. For a n1otnent \'\ All hushed was the hillows conuriotion.'' Then fr01n the turbulent n1oh :forty tnen craved recognition frotn the chair. 'The chair tnotioned to the unconquerable, Hunsicker~ who was standing on the table over in the corner, his face flushed vvith the excite- t11ent of the occasion, his hair standing on end. \'\Ve have waited four years,\ he shouted, and pandernoninn1 greeted the words~ and everybody sang \ We'll hang trustees on the sour apple tree.\ vVhen quiet was again restored in that inforn1al assetnhly the speech n1aking w.ent on fast and furious. Everybody agreed and yet few did agree. '89 took its full tneasure in d~b.ate. Up rose the staid and potent Hanson who spoke a few quiet words that set everybody thinking. Then stiill another the gaUant Cully whose look vvas as fierce as when with the foot-ball tuckecl under his ann he bas dashed down the field through opposing ranks who tried in vain to stop hin1. 1\1otions, now, began to be hurled at the chair. One piping freshman \vho was roosting upon the stean1 rnd iator caught the eye of the chainnan and said in a tren1ulous voice ·which betokenecl his sense of responsibility: \Mr. Chainnan, I tnovc that we bounce the Board of Trustees and give then1 ten days notice.\ Another pro1nising freshman \vho was not sc rash den1urred to this and n1oved to proceed to the election of a president of Union College. Still another freshnutn was a bout ·to tnake a •· tnotion when his head catne in contact with an overshoe that happened to he flying across the rootn, and he wHs quietly inforn1ed by a burly sophotnore that the next freshtnan who attetnptecl to speak would be fired out the window. It was inde.;d a wonderful n1eeting. You 111nst pardon its occupying so tnuch space for it was the incident in '8g's history which n1arl\s the crisis between the fonner ti1ne of hope and doubt and the following period of contenhnent and prosperity. Let us now take a hasty glance at this first part

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 156 of '89's career, the first three years. It has its brightness as well as its glootn. We were pro- bably the 1i veliest set of boys that ever entered Union College. And so Hke n1ostboyswe were constantly getting into scrapes. vVe ·cannot~ however, record in this brief history the infinite nurn:ber of scrapes, nor even the praiseworthy scenes in whi:ch '89 took part. It is our ob5ect rnerely to give an outline, to rnake pron1inent a few facts. that will throv-v light upon the whole, and tnalre clear the chat-acter, the general tone and disposition ~fthe class mnid its various rela- tions, good, had and indifferent, during four years at college. We believed fin11ly in athletics. We believed that students could in n~ better ~ray contribute \ to their n1anhood, to their best interest and future success than hy deve] oping sound, strong and tnanly bodies. Every class has its hobby. Sotne believe too tnud~ in books ;. sotne devote all their titne to the girls; but \Ve held to the pleasures of athletics. Accordingly our record has been brilliant. In. foot ball, base ball, running and jutnping we have been foretnost. We believed furthennore in '89. No split ever 1narred any of our ·:pleasures. We were always ready for a lark together, too ready per- haps, never tnissed a class supper, nor withheld our enthusiastic support frotn anything which tended to exalt the fair farne of Alma Jlfater. All classes do this to a certain extent but what vve desire to call attention. to is ~he unique har- tnony which has ever characterized the class of 89. We have diflered in our opinions as auv intelligent body of persons having independent views n1ust necessarily do, but still when the occasion for action carne a subtle enthusiastn see111ed to unite us. Now a word for our distinguished ( ?) \vork in recitation rootn. Tl1e historia11, in spite of threats, will blurt out the truth in this n1atter i. e. that the dizzy heigl1ts of ro spots never had rnuch facination for the sober spirits of '89; at any rate we failed to clitnb so high, but, on the average. were content with the tnore n1odest level of 7 or 8. Indeed sotne tnalicious persons have itnputed another n1ark as the appropriate insignia of '89- We reject the innuendo with scorn and will ex- plain how, by a curious coimcidence, such a nefarious 111ark catne to be associated \vith exceedingly studious and virtuous young tnen. It is the custotn of the all-wise factflty, at the end of every tenn, to send to the parrnts or guardians of the students a little report i tHlicating their standing in each study. Now if .a student is so unfortunate as to pursue too ze~lh:l'usly what has cotne to be the favorite avocation of so.tne and has received in coUege parlance the sotnew hat .. l ·d. . l b. f ~ . ·f . \ '' rnts ea tng an( arn ,'lguous tulln e o .. s,J ting, the governor at hotne finds one or tnore queer tnarks on the report consisting of two letters, N. S. There has never been any tnystery attached to these letters although we have heard of a Sophotnore who pei-suaded the old gentlen1an that they stood for ''~~one Supe1~ior.\ The correct interpretation, how,ever, is \ .. Not Sustained.\ Now it happened that when '89 was in college a year or n1ore ~·ertain enterprising fellows atnong us defern1ined to found another Greek letter fraten1.ity at Union, ·where SJ tnauy glo!·ious ones had already aris:=n. Accordingly the Nu Sigs can1e into existence~ or in full the N u Sigl~1a Gan11na. 1\bout <>lre-half of the n1etnbers of '89 were N u Sigs, a t~d the aforesaid . tnalicious persons rnaintained that N u Sign1a Gatntna was nothing else than the N. S. Gang, while sotne tenned it the north section guards. They were undoubteJly envioLtS of the elegant key which could scarcely be distinguished frotn that of Phi Beta Kappa. The character of N u Sign1a Gan1111a w,ts entirely original hut it re- nounce~, at least its fonner men1bers renounce, any connection with the opprobrious n1arks N. S. The coincidence was ac:cit\ental. But there is an end to \ everything under the sun,\ as Professor VV~ ells said when he finished his lectures, and '89 has reached the end of its college life. Never again shaH we jun1p at the sound of the old recitation bells, not C<tll any class work a bore. No tnore the soporific hour with the professor of Latin, after which it was our wont to go and take a nap. lle i~ now in Europe; God bless the steatner. Rtunor has it that he goes to recuperate his leg; Blessing has pulled it so vigorously all year. Poor Jlieditah- bah! No tnore the Socratic discussions in Prof.

I 57 THE CONCORDIENSIS. Hofll11an's recitation. Let us ao hack to one of b them for rncn1ory sake. The bell has struck, the boys are all snugly seated, the roll is calLed, and then the voice of Socrates rouses the fellows to a sense of duty. ~' l'v1r. \Vait, what is your opinion of the relation of tnind and n1atter ?\ , After a pause vVait ansvvers. Socrates corners hiH1, and shows hitn that instead of being a Christian young gentletnan he is a tnaterialist hut doesn't knovY it, and secretly agrees vvith Darwin and Janles Stollar that we are all des- cended fro1n a n1onkey. 1'hen heattacks Levvis; and Eddie is startled to find that he is tnore nearly allied to Bob Ingersoll than to any other person or creed. Now he tries vVashhurne, hut it doesn't work. Bob and Dick Catneron are straight-laced, fighting- orthodox tnen, nor can all the wiles of I-Iofly's logic ensnare then1 for one n1on1ent into the forbidden ground. So the debate goes ou and w lten the hour is over, the fellows get up and leave with the sincere conviction that they don't knovv anything and never \vill ; that there is nothing sure in this world-nothing whatever but a six spot in Ethics. vVhen the exatninations in. Ethics came vve used to go in vvith a faint heart. 1'en questions to answer, anyone of vvhich would req uit·e an hour. But ho\Y long hnve we? Three quarters of au hour to answer those ten questions. 1'en into fiwty-five is about four. Four tninntes for an hour's work. But we have a tnan that can beat Prof. I-Ioflinan in exatnination ~ i1_1 the person of the professor of English. 1'o observe Prof. 1'ruax carrv on an exarnination, one vvould be \' seriously inclined to think that he W<IS n1aking experitnents to discover the best tnode oi execu~ ting critninals. However, both give excellent results, and we rnust pass judgtnent in these cases only upon results. Now to say farewell. 1'he brightest days, the jolliest days, above ,dl the freest and tnost tran-· quil days arc now but nlethodes, \vhich will becotne n1ore refreshing as the years glide by. Our dear old t~tn1iliar haunts on the catnpus will soon be overrlln with strangers. In the Gyn1, upon the diatnond and tennis courts, where we have played in careless frolic with bosoa1 friends, if we revisit in a few years we shall be stared at as intruders. Nobody will know us, and like . . poor old Rip Van 'Vinkle, when he can1e down frotn the n1ountain, even the dogs will bark at our heels. Where once we were hailed by everybody then no one will recognize us. Let tis hope that when that titne con1 es '89's historian can \vrite a n1ore earnest and nobler h istorv· of . ~ every 1nernber of our class. M. NoLAN, JR.

What shall I sing? l\Iy subject und~fined, A subject for myself I'll have to :find.

There is a legend that in ancient titne8 There lived a m.ln 'neath genial The ban climes Born of the gods, \1f them a progeny In strength and might a hnman prodigy; His father Zeuc::, omnipotent, supreme, Held by the other gods in high esteetn; His mother, noblv born, was Alcrnene, A royal daughter and a princess, she. While yet a child, he was by p:trents left Out in a field, of every care ber~ft; Left in the hope that, come as he did from hea\'en, Celestial aid would :-.oon to him be given. He rescued, soon hy kindly hands is borne To palace halls from which he had been .torn. So did he grow in sinew large and great, Until at last he'd nigh reached man's estate. In feats of brawn he all his kind surpasseJ-. Ahne he stood, for none with him were clas:-;ed. He, trained from his youth in all the archer'~ art, Could wield the bow and send the winged dart With nice precision and with aim exact, No·acquisition was there that he lacked. A pupil apt in all respects was he,

TfiE CONCORDIENSIS. With tew bad traits; but once, unhappily, In angry mood his right arm's sturdy blow His tutor in the pangs .of death laid low. From palace halls, he bani 1 shed goes away Amid tl)e scenes of rural life to stay. Among companions rude his strength is praitied, At many a trial of might they stood amazed. In height he wa~, as is the poplar tall, Like to a giant towering over all. In beauty, too, he was without compare, His finely chiseled features lily-fair. In all the land of Greece there ne'er was seen A stronger youth than he was at eighteen. Oft to the woodland dense, from comrades gay, With weary feet he took his lonely way. And so it happened .that on a summer's day When aimlessly he let his footst<:ps stray, His mind engrossed with care and thought profound, He finds himself on gentl_y rising ground; And on this spot he sees the road divide- Which path to take is for him to decide. The one to the right unbending takes it 1~oute, The other to the left. He stands in doubt. Then suddenly to his astonished sight There come two maidens clad in raiment bright, The first of lofty stature, graceful mein, In all the realm of beauty was she queen. The other, with much ornament bedecked, Comes to the you.th with eager feet dh-ect. Without delay this latter silence breaks, And to him standing there these words she speaks: '' I see you are in doubt, my youthful friend, \ As to which path your footsteps yon should bend; '' I am your friend; if you but trust in me, \ I'll point a road to ease and luxury. '' No pain or tt-ouble on this road you'll meet, \ But everything with happiness replete; '' On every side are pleasures to enjoy, \ In which J'OUr fleeting hours you 1nay employ. \ No toilsome labor and no anxious care \ L\..nnoy the traveler on his journey U1ere. \ Now this way and now that the highway bends, ''At every turn some new delight attends, '' Through rneadows green and oft through pleasant yale, '• Where bursting buds the passer-by regale. ''There runs hard by a brimming, babbling brook, '' Which twists and tw·n& through many a shady nook. \ See, in the boughs the birds are sweetly singing; ''Look! 'neath the feet the frag·rant flowers are spdnging. '' Now beauteous youth you have your choice to make, '' Which of the roads do you prefer to take?\ When then she speaking ceased, the other came And spoke these words, addressing him by name: '' List not to that vain woman's speech, I pray, '' For if you do you'U rue it n1uch some day- '' A round ofpleasure she would ha veyou lead. '' Now let me counsel, and ti1J precepts heed, '' I do not pro1nise make but to deceive, \ Nor do I ever false assurance give. '' Not smooth and levd, but hard and steep the J 1 oad '' That leads through mountain heights to my abode. '' No pleasing landscapes g1 1 eets Jhe traveler wea>~·y, :' But .rocky steeps-the prospects sad and dreary; '' No blooming flowers are seen, nor is the~re heard \' The n1erry trill' or joyous note of bi.rd. '' No cooling winds or balmy breezes blow \ Upon the harsh and rugged way below. '' Both toil and trouble everywhere abound, \ And care that eats the soul is also found. \ But once the height is gained, the danger o'er, '' An even, level path runs on before, \ And leads to dwellings fair and mansions bright, '' Where brightest dawn succeeds the former night. '' Engrave this saying true upon the heart, \ The highest prizes, which the gods impart, '' Are given o::~ly those who close pursue ''The path of Duty and keep her in view. \Now guileless youth, while yet JOUr choi.ce is free, '' List to rea::;on 's voice-be led by me.\ Thus spoke the woman, and the sequel shows The youth obeyed her and her pathway chose. This legend, classmates all, to us applies; Before ns, 1 oo, a road divided lies; Now at the point of juncture do we stand, Frotn which two branches run on either hand. Turn to the left, a path of ease is spread; Turn to the right, a path of toil you'il tread. Press on, nor let the shades of carking care Your soul o'ercome when driven to deep despair. Though da.rk and drear the day at first may seem, Ere long will come the noon-day's ruddy beam. For him who travels on towards Duty's gates, A garland green of lam·el leaves there waits. 'Tis only in this way that we can gain The highest honor, and noble ends attain. 'Tis not to. self alone the debt is due, But to our Alma Mater, kind and true, Who for the years gone by has been our guide In wisdom's mazy track; and at our side Has walked through Learning's rich and verdant fields, And all the paths of truth which science yields. All that we are, all that we hope to be, We owe, 0, Alma Mater dear, to thee. With strength to brave the storms of coming years, With faith to vanquish unbelieving fears, \Ve lay with reverence upon thy shrine The aspirations fond of Eight-nine. JOHN L. SIMPSON, '89·

It will be, in a cert~tin sense, the offici~! organ of the college, and vdU \N()rk for the inter- ests of the college; but its spe-cial ain1 'vill be to stand at all ti111es for the inten~sts of the student hody. The litetal'y work for the cotning year will con1prise a series of articles frorn Alutnni of the highest standing and of recognized literary ability. The engineering cleparttnent of the past yenr has been so successful an expcTitnent that it will be continued. The lack of local news, a noticeable and yet irre:tuediable fault, we think vvill be fiHed by the expected growth in nun1bers and the tnore active and popular condition of the college. vVith the support of the students, both financial and personal, the board confidently hope~ to rnake the paper worthy of the institution it tepresents. * * ' * UNION's ninety-second Cotnn1ence1nent is over. The first year under the new administra- tion is finished ; and frotn the large nun1ber of altnnni present last week, nothing was heard hut expressions of praise for President Webster · ·and of joy and confidence in the future of the college. The speech of the President at the Alun1ni dinner was noticeably solid and earnest. There were no glittering generalities ; no prophecy of future possibilities; there was the cool and con- vincing expression, that if he stayed here, Union would have a solid, synHnetrical and healthv ~ - growth, and that he expected and depended upon the alutnni to help hin1. This is the kind of talk that carries conviction and confidence to tnen of practical n1incls and leaves an earnest belief with every well-wisher of the college that the policy of.the college \''ill be right and suc- cessful. * * * THERE was probably no one thing that served n1ore to n1ake the alut11ni feel at hotne than to find that they could still have their annual job at stone breaking. It is co1nn1endable and eco- notnical to put a lot of large slate on the drives and walks a few days before cotntnencetnent instead of earlier in the ten11, as it obviates the necessity of hiring it broken and Jnakes the -.visitor useful as well as otbervvise. * * * THE appointn1ent of Cole, '88, as tutor in English, and of Schofield, '88, as tutor in n1ath- etnatics, tneets the approval of all who have known these tnen in college. ~Both are tnen of keen n1inds and have excellent kno,vledge of their departrnents,. and beth are n1en of excellent personal influence.}

THE CONCORDIENSTS. 160 - -~------- -- -- ---- -- -\----- -~ ------ - - - -- -·· IN THE Chancellor's address a recon1nrenda- tion was 1nade to young tnen to study a certain titne each day upon history. This iclea is espec- ially worthy of thought; for what is history but pr,ophecy? A knowledge of it is an invaluable aiel to the lawyer and clergyn1an. It is abso- lute1 y indispensable to the journalist and politi- cian. And not alone the general history of . great nations, but especially that of great n1en and peculiar occurrences ; for frorn these can be gained a· knovvledge that will often be of tnore service than the best advice or 111ost deliberate judgtnent. ·The Chancellor's address frotn beginning to end was n1agnificent in its power of thought, brilliancy of rhetoric and finish of oratory, and · vvill repay tnany a reading. * * * OwiNG to the inability of THE CoNCORDIEN- SIS to obtain the nu1nuscript of the oration tak- ing the first Blatchford tnedal, it cannot he pub- lished in this ntnnber, but the copy will be obtained fro1n Mr. Blessing, the winner of the prize, and published in the first nun1 ber of the new year. --- --- ------~- --------~--~----------------- -- The Commencement. GROVE EXERCISES. The beautiful arnphitheatre in Jackson's gar- den was well filled Monday afternoon with an audience cotnposed n1ostly of wotnen cotne to witness the first of the Cotnmencetnent Exer- _ cises.

Conover. ol Planting of Class Ivy. Music. The tnusic by Parlatti's fan1ous orchestra was the best heard in years and was especially fine in the evening at the·· CLASS DAY EXERCISES. These vvere opened \vith a pleasing and thoughtful address by C. I-L Flannigan· of Albany, the president of the class of eighty-nine. The oration was delivered by J mnes How~n·d Hanson of Schenectady. It wr~s retnarkahly well delivered and can be found published en tire in th,is nurnber. Next was read the poetn written by J. L. Simpsoa of Schenectady. Mr. Sin1pson was also the ivy poet, and both of his productions are printed elsevvher,e. The history of the class was read by Michael Nolan Jr. ofSchenectady, who gave the audience an account of the affairs that have 1nade '89 so tnodel a class. 1'he prophecy by E. S. Hunsicker of Norris- town, Pa., was then ~rea<.l to a thoroughiy atnused audience and was follo-vved by the class,ically written address of L. L. Cmn·eron of Albany. All of the class day productions will he found in this nu1nber. ALUMNI DAY.

Raytnond of Albany as })resident pro tcn1, called the ahnuni to order at I r o'clock and when Secretnry Clute call the roll, classes '29, '39, '49, '59., '69, '79 responded.. Sotne very feeling eulogies were pronounced in regard to dead alun1ni; after which the following officers were elected. President, Dr. A. V. V. Rayn1oncl of . Albany; Vice-President, Dr. Tunis L.

At the TRUSTEE MEETING. Little was done of outside interest, except the. a ppoi nttnent of Phi lip H. Cole, '88, tutor in English and J. M. Schofield, '88. tutor in Mathe- tnatics. OVER THE BANQUET in the round building, President Webster pre- sided, and while the eatables disappeared, Parlatti's orchestra produced enchanting tnusic. The noise was of an excellent quality and was furnished i.n abundance principally by '88 and '89 ; these two classes atten1pting to drown each other out with class yell and song. The first address \Vas tnade by the President, who spoke of the fonnation of the itTI})Ortant nlutnni associations during the past year and of the financial condition of the college. I-I e told about the good condition of the Hunter Point property; of a $5 ,ooo gift fron1 Hector C. Havetneyer, '6r, of New York City; and of . alu tnni subscriptions yielding a special inco1ne of$4,175 annually. He also reported the pros- ·})ect of a cl'ass next year nutnbering at least 50 ~tnd probably 1nore. His talk was noticeable for its lack of glittering generalties and by its plain, earnest and confidence inspiring tone filled the hearts of the feasting ahunni \Vith a sure belief and trust in President Webster. -- -------·------- ,...f'he President closed his address by reading a letter frotn Gen. Butterfield, '61, presenting a large engraving of one of nature's nobletnen- /Chester A. Arthur, '48. The portrait is an. ex .. ceHent one and was accepted by the Hon. Hooper C. Van V orst. T'he retnainder of the proceedings were presided over by Chas. E1no~-yT S·mith, '6r, the honorary chancellor; who on taking ·t:Jle chair stated that he was an exception to the tradition that a Union tnan is ready .at a n1on1en.t's not:ioe to qualify any ernergency. He then. })ro- ceecled to show bow 1nistaken his assertion was by :tn;aking the brightest of toast-1nasters. The oldest graduate present was Hugh D. Banks;, ''29., · who spoke eluting the course of the banquet. PRIZE SPEAK[NG. On Tuesday evening the prize contest occurred at the eh ureh, a tid frotn beginning to end was rernarkably good ; the Veeder contest especiaUy being 1uuch better than heretofore. 1\he fh·st Sophotnore speaker was Wn1. A. McDonald of Gioversville, who handled his subject of'·' Educa- tion and Enterprise,\ with an excellent voice and graceful gesture. Tracy H .. Robertson of Elmira, next spoke upon '' Philip IIenry Sherian.\ Mr. Robertson has a good stage presence and spoke with con- vincing earnestness. At this point Prof. Truax announced the special Veeder question. Resolved '\That purity of the ballot vvould be obtained by the adoption of the .A .. ustralian systetn.\ The Junior speaking was opened by John I. Bennett of Chicago, who announced on the pro- gnnntne that \They buried hitn atnong the kings.'' His oration had to do with ~he two aristocracies, the one of blood, the other of brains. It was thoughtfully written and pleas- ingly delivered. Wtn. S. Cassidy of l\1echanicville spoke of the ''Strong Cotn hi nation,\ of church, state and school. This broad subject was skillfully written up by Mr. Cassidy and his ear11est delivery pleased the audience greatly. \ An1ericn's Poetry \ was the thetne chosen by Fritz E. Hawkes; of Eln1ira, who believes that a strong national poetry can 1nove 111en to the purest and strongest national 1 if e. Geo. C. Stewart of Perth, was the last speaker and handled his oration on the '' Anny of tbe Reserve,\ with powerful oratorical ability.; clain1ing that a man's strength lies in his reserve poweT.

I\etnarka ble stage presence and logical argutnentsbeing particularly noticeable frorn the fact that :he was the only representative of the Freshrnan class upon the stage. The coH1n1ittee .cotnposed of E. D .. • Pahner, A. P.

President Webster clad in his robes and cap, opened the last of the exercises at IO :30 on Wednesday n1on1 ing after the procession had tnarched in to the strains of the !matchless 1narch frm11 '~ T'anhauser\ played by Parlatti's orchestra.
