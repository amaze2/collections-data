H. THE TIE THAT BINDS Union Colleg·e graduates have maintained u loyalty to their college that can best be compared to the growing loyalty of fra- tel·nity men to their Greek letter societies. Who makes your bed in your dar mi- tory IDLE DRIVEL It's a strange comparison to make. It's obvious that the college as a whole is held in highel' esteem than any one's fraternity. It may seem obvious, but the contrary is true. Fr·aternities have assumed precedence <JVel' the college, and no longer is a student here a Union man, but a fraternity or a non- fratemity man. The means of identifica- til>ll i:; purely and simply Greek. Whatever may Le the aJ'g-uments in favor of or against fratemities, it seems that Union College has mothe1·ed them too well. The youngsters have gained an independent spirit that is threatening to divide the college into many little factions. Interrelation of students has long gone by the lJoards. Fraternity social af.fairs occa- sionally bring together various representa- tive persons, but the group is a select one. The majority of the college never gets to- gethel'. There have been instances, at prom, at the Schorr concert, at athletic events- sometimes-where the whole college meets. The opportunities have been too rare. Ath- letic events, if they are attended, are at- tended by groups and the groups rarely mix. Whether Union College will become a col- lege of extremely divided loyalties where only the frater is smiJ.ingly welcomed and where the class mate is grudgingly accepted remains to be seen. 1937 This is the editorial that sounds the :pal't- ing knell. Famous in journalistic annals for iLs triteness, as the farewell to the senior class, the final adieu, the sophistic and soph- omoric lending of wholesome advice, tht ll•w·- jel'ldng goodby, this editorial has been the :.;omce for many telegraph messages and other pieces of modern literature. As undergraduates we don't envy the sen- iors too much, because we still have a year or two of cloistered academic life. We should feel sorry a.nd happy for the seniors, in this parting gesture, and we do. But we are not happy or sorry for the class. Human minds don't usually can·y such emotions for a gTOUp. It is a personal feeling that makes us gay Hr sad. To Bob, or Jack, or George, or Fred ot· Jerry we extend the friendly farewell. Om· emotions are for individuals, not :for a group. The consciousness of belonging to a cer- tain class is a lJinding force, though arti- ficial. And it is to overcome the sense of heing just part of the class of 1937 Ol' '38 or '39 that we bid goodby and g-oodluck to the outgoing undergraduates of Union Col- lege. Or fraternity room on the second story! W-ell, you're all that I've said, and even more of it; You're per·fection, I haven't reached the core of it! You get to your classes good and early, ·With a smile on your face so :you won't look surly. And when you recalled on you treat your professor To a.s many facts as a father con- fessor; When the poor guy's wrong you tell him he's right, yet And y<Ju don't get bored when hi.s lecture's trite yet. So you get all A's for scholastic labor, Which pt·oves that you're srnar-te.l' than your neighbor. · And in sports you earn your major letter, Which proves that in strength of atrn you're better. You get hono1· and honors and honors and honors, Till you're almost as great as anonymous donors. MOTION This, we hope but doubt, is In the nature of a columnar curtsy. The former conductor of the cinema column has Ju.st Bent Double bowing out and we seize this opportunity to do a bit of pip- pin-polishing. By the time September roll.s 1round it is barely possible that the old dark house on Jay Street tVan Curler) will be open for bllsi- ness. One of the better known local promoter.s has interested a grou}l Jf very far-sighted Individuals in che p<Jssibilities of cheap movies plus adulterated burlesque at twenty-five cents a head. A new ,·oof, some new seats, a coat of ,mint and a dust-mop wouldn't do the theater any harm, and the basic policy sounds pretty good; • owever, considering the appaient .>trength of local, self-appointed Defenders of Public Morals, we fear that the more interesting half of the propused bill would be adult· erated indeed. But God bless 'ern for trying. Then again, vaudeville should re- sume at Proctor's about the end of October. The past season did have N\.T.G. and Stepin Fetchit, and Ina Ray Hutton, and Fats Wal- ler; but their efforts went for aaught in the face of a multitude of Fl'ed Lightners, Harry Savoys, .md sundry wooden leg shows. The new crop may bring one of the .varmed-over l<'rench Casino shows, Cab Calloway, perhaps the Ritz Brothers and F1·ed Waring . . . all this is the most fanciful kind of conjecture, but anything is pos- Jible. At any rate, we may safely assume that there will be sufficient numbers of Lightners, Savoys, and leg shows to keep the scales oft- balance. Hollywood will probably save ouch epics as The Story of Emile Zola, The P1•isoner of Zenda, Art- ists rund Models, and Hurricane for Fall or early Winter release, but delicacies like Parnell, Capf;ains Courageous, The Road Baclt, and A Day at the Races may be seen in the dark during vacation. Fur- thermore, by September Walt Dis- ney's full-length Snow White and the Seven Dwal'Ves should be near- ing completion; Jim Wade, '39, should be in line for the role ()f Ashley Wilkes in \Q-.W.t.W.\; the cast of Idiot's l)ellg-ht should be hard· at work, and the Hearst pa- pers should be publicizing the lat- est picture· of; quote, that dellglitful come dIe n.n e, unquote, Marion Davies. The most encouraging news .is that W. c, Fields and Harold Lloyd wil1 be facing tlte cameras again. J, M. We wate going to tell ~·ou about the sheep on Danton's lawn, about the college':o new standing a:; a social \batter\ school, about the new revival of leatning in the Lib1ary, and other little stories, but we decided to basket thetn all with the 1 est of the stale news and make our own little v.aledictory-for the year. ' We'd like to see the new council evolve that much talked about ~ew system of student government, see them hold stud<mt body meet- mgs more often, We want deals, but deals in the open not the back- whisper lcind. ' We'd like to ~ee new faculty members on the Publications' Boa1 d each year. We think, if they used a system of having the President appoint thtee dLfferent members each year, that more members of the fac111ty would pa1 i1cipate in taking an active inte1est and hand in the affails and ptoblems of our publications. And the memberd would not be on long enough to align themselves with g-roups out· worn ideas, and certain prejudices. ' We see need for an jmpt·oved advisor system whereby faculty memb~rs overcome their reluctance to bend, and share the problems of thetr \advlsees.\ .we wa!lt student commit~ees similar to that working ·in the So_c~a~ .studies department, w1nch Will compose an investigating and Ct'ttlctzmg body <Jf the departments' curriculum, fac11lty, and inshuc· tlon methods, and which vvill publish their report annually. We'd like le» see the re-installation of freshman rules and of harmless traditions, which non-deliberative bodies have destroyed. We'd like ~~ have m<Jie all-college affairs, which furnish both cultural and soctal value to the students, and bring about the well known idea of \integration\ of f!aternities, which the Conc()rdy harped about so much in the last year. .we want an. infirrna.ry, a new rushing system, co-operative bu:ymg; a pass, fat! and honor marlting system; better attended con- carts; and les5 criticism and more participation of our honorary fel· low seances. In short, we want less indifference, less sllilplcion, and rnore interest. And if you're home now, wondering whether to spend the summer swimming, playing tennis, or working, we'd like you to decide to participate more in the aff!.lits of your college for the year 1~37-38.

Publications The stress and strife and trials and tribulations of newspaper and magazine publication were present in profound abundance during the past year at Union College. With The Idol taking the limelight- mainly because it was abolished- The Concordiensis remaining edi- tol\ially inactive, and Tbe Garnet displaying itself with a little n:iore of joi de vivre but yet undistin- guished, the year was mediocre for student publications. The Student Council voted for a new yearbook, this one to be for the incoming freshman class. The publication will be an enlarged freshman handbook, complete with pictures of the neopb.ytes and their secondary school biographies. Un- der the direction of Frederic A. Wyatt and Edmund R. Arundell, '38, a staff of three editoriJ has been selected to publish y-ear. Although the Publications Board recommended the abolit!ion of The Idol last November and the Student (!ouncil carried out its suggestion today The Idol Is once more exist- ent. Several plans for new maga- zines were submitted to the Student ~ouncll, but in effect The Idol, as ·It was -BriginaHy intended by its editors this year, was retained. The editors of the quarterly for next year are as follows: editor-in- chief, Edson V. Draper, '38, of R:.ocky Mount, N. C.; Louis C. Maples. '38. of Notwieh, Conn., T. Douglas 0. Stevenson, '39, of Brooklyn, and Benjamin Rathbun jr., '39. Other editors may be se- l~cted in the fall by this staff. The final publication of The Idol, \for summer\ was Issued Wednes- day afternoon, and despite some in- congruity in typography and pic- tDrlal lay-out-and the yellow front cover -was one of the best issues i11 the past three years. A variety of articles written by a variety of student authors helped give the quarterly a worthy collegiate touch. H. A.

Im.proved This Year New and Rare Booli:s Added; Magazine List ·Enlarged; Equipment Installed A remodeled building, new equip· ment, and an enlarged staff are evidence of a year of active g.rowth for the College Library. A:fter the old Nott Memorial un- derwent a series of major operations last summer that changed a draJ'ty, noisy boolt warehouse into a mod- ern library with ail·-conditioning and sound-proof offices, the staff, headed by Helmer .A. Webb, librar- ian, was faced by the task of ar- ranging and straightening up the books. This task of stretching it- self into its new home has occu- pied the library's entire year. Work on the third floor, Union's attic, is still going on. A gift of $10,0{)0 for the improve- ment and enlargement of the book stock bas resulted in the purchase of a number of large and .important sets_ Of the sum, $2000 has already been .spent, the large part for books and literature in the modern lan- guage fields. Among these pur- chases Is that of an edition of the Encyclopedia ttaliana, the finest ~n­ cyclopedia in the world, accordmg to M:r. Webb. Thrt}ugh a gift t}f John Vanneck, the library is now in a position to replace the p.eriodicals dropped dur- i~ the depression, which have left a four-year gap in the files_ One important task recently be- gun is the copying of valuable books by means of the optigraph. So far, a number of volumes have been completely copied with the new ma- chine. Robe!! J. Ulennon. .Jl' .. Schenectady Charles H. Goddard. Harkensack, :-1. J Charles H.

GuyGriSW()ld Pitchingfor Alumni; Jones Will Be Varsity '1\virler Concluding what has been a rather mediocre season, the Union baseball varsity will face the· Alumni Sa:turday in the game which usually turns out to be the · classic one of the year. With a record of three wins and defeats in intercollegiate <:ornpetitlon, the va.r·sity never tluie·.ss will have a good chance of taking the final contest ·even though Guy Griswold, master pitcher .for Union in late years, is slated to toss them up for the old grads. c·oiby Jones, the Garnet's most condotent pe1·former, will toe the slab for the varsity, with Waters and Johnson in ze- serve. The varsity's chief advantage is that of ptaclicE>, a.s is always the case, for althD>uglJ most of the Alumni are capablE enaugh in the field, the lack o i J>ractice together will hinder theJn. The probable lineup for the alumni will fin.d Fiore at short, Clark at first, Br-an<low hugging the keystone, and :Reed covering the hot corner. In the field will be Dill at left, Marotta at center, and Meredith at riJ?ihL Di .Lalio will catch Griswold:s deliveries. On re- serve for the g1·~duates will be Sa- batini, Loomis, Nels ·N\itchman Cad- wallader ,and Aclt:ley. Raiph Se- merad and Al Stevenson, who have exams at Harvard, will not be able to play. In looking over the about-to-be- completed season, VIC find that the record is not extremely impressive. However, Coach Nelson, in his first year at Union, w~s considerably hampered by unt:rled material, and, working around Marra and Brown, the two veterans, he·formed a team which played ex:C!ellell.t ball in sev- eral games and at: 1 east made a creditable showing. In the others. Three Yl~tories Opening against a l'eputedly strong Middlebur-y nine, Union sur- prisen even itself In running up a 13-3 win in six lnnl;ngs, since dark- ness and rain halted the game at that point. Jones. in his debut, pitched masterfuJ ball and kept out of trouble in all b-ut two innings. The next two ·ganes were washed out, and then Rochester gave the varsity a shellacking, 17'3, as Union pitchers failed to .st:op the Yellow- jacket hitting bat'rage. Syracuse next took a close ga.me, 11 to 7. Coffman, Orange p.i tc her, was nicked consistently by- Garnet bat- ters, but came tbrougb in the cru- cial points to subdue tbe Dutchmen. Jones and Brown led the attack with three blows ap ieee. By virtue of a squeeze play in the eleventh inning, Johns Hoplt.ins was defeat- ed 7-6, as Waters chalked up his first victory. Tll.oznas and Yunich Neither of Union's two spring minor sports teams, the courtmen and the linksmen, had illustrious seasons this year.

BARBIERI HOURS: I :3().7:00 P. M. scheduled r aJned out. The best the ~~~;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;~~: / golfers could do was to win one and tie one, losing its other four matches. The tennis team made an inau- spicuous debut on away- courts, los~ ing to Swarthmore and Ha;verfcrd by the close score 4 to 5. Rained out in the home matches with Syra- cuse and Williams, the netmen then lost two to Colgate, 1 to 8 and 2 to 7. M. I. T. next conquered the ·Garnet 7 to 2. Union broke into the winning column for the first time at Syracuse, beating the Oxange 5 to 4, and won its last two matches with Middlebury and Ver- mont, 6 to 3 and 6 to 3. Tbe Dutchmen this season had an ideal doubles combination in Captain-elect Fritz . Hawley and Marvin Dwore, number 1 and 2 men, respectively. They were outstand- ing in the singles also. The squad will lose four men by graduation this year: Captain Orton, Norman .Stewart, Bernie Salad and Donald Baxte1·. The team was unfortunate this year In that it had little op- portunity to play matches on Its home courts since three contests here were rained out. Ineligibility rules took their toil, keeping the squad crippled for away matches. GUERRA PHARMACY 600 Union St.,· c:or. Barrett l'hcne 2-94:._1 You're .Going As an Underg rad,.

If he is eligible to play in away games next year, Union should be sitting pretty. paced Union with four and three hits respectively. Williams next eked out a heartbreaker, 3-2, as Union began a four-game road trip. Waters, though pitching fine ball, was credited with the loss. The second Rochester game proved better than the first, but again Union was on the short end, 8-1. Johnson, in his first varsity game, held the Yellowjackets for six innings after- allowing seven runs in the first three. Army then nicked Union, 7-6, to end the road season and then the Garnet blasted R. P. I., 15-7. The final collegiate encounter was dropped to Mass. State, 13-0.

We have tendered Union a few who will bring credit to her name. In their bands lies the future reputation of '37. Next Monday we will be grad- uated, and we will be leaving Union.

During your fou1· yea1•s the faculty has tried to place before you the ideals of scholarship and gentlemanly conduct. We hope that we ·have inspired you with the things that make for success. , .. \We hope that we have helped you find. yourselves. There is noth- ing so important as finding a ll~e work suited to your abilities. This is the one thing that will lead to real service and happiness. Having found yourselves, accept yourselves and ·be yourselves. \Union College is your college. It has a fine tradition. Help us lteep it fine for the gene1·ations of young men yet to come. \We hope that yom· paths may be so laid that you may return here frequently. We shall always wel- come you home. In the years to come the college will need your help and counsel. I know you will be prepared.\ Reeves Speaks \Our methods of thought have changed since the times of the Greeks. Yet over many minds to- day the Greeks still hold sway. \The error of the Greeks was in establishing a system of abstract thought and assuming tbat the measurable world conformed to it. But it rnay be that their abstract- thought system does not represent the corporeal univel'Se, The Greelts, I. e., lacked the pragmatic spirit. \Pragmatism. Recognizes the ex- Istence only of what can be meas- ured.. Abandons classical truth test for one of workabilitY,. That only is valid which can be 1 set up as a scientific experiment. . . . Its sole criterion is utility. \Objection: that pragmatism ignores values, morals, standards of abstract judgment. But value is utility. On pragmatism's own ground, moral becomes a meaning- less word .... \To the doubter it Is questionable whether rational :philosophy can be 'proved'. It cannot be demonstrated on pragmatic grounds.\ ---0 Student Committee Studies Courses Social Studies Faculty To Act On Student Suggestions For Curriculum The faculty of the Division of Social Studies now has under con- sideration a study of the freshman and sophomore curriculum in social studies made this year by the Social Studies Club to determine student reaction to the courses and what changes, if any, students felt should be made in them. No action has been taken as yet but present indi- cations are that several important suggestions will be adopted without material cnange and that all of them will have some effect on the teaching of the courses. Last year the division facl,llty voted to conduct an investigation of the curriculum of the first two years and also requested the Social Studies Club to make an independ- ent investigation. The committee appointed to make the study in- cluded: G. Curtis Stewart '37, chair- man, Charles H. House '38, Henry H. Hartman '38, Melvin Muroff '38 and Casimir Rrrskowski '37. The study involved a detailed ex- amination of each of the five courses offered by the ])ivision of SoCial Studies. The questions con- sidered were the purpose of the courses in the general plan, and how -well the courses were fulfilling their purpose. .An examination of curriculum ·1•equirements in these t:wo years was also undertaken.
