While, step by step, this progress has taken place, the many men who have contributed to it could not know what. far-reaching results it would have. Now the ultimate boons grow cleat. Water power development becomes a national policy, steam bids fair to rival water power for cheapness, economically produced power brings more plentiful goods, lights houses and hauls crowds in cities, is. carried to rural sections to lift washday drudgery from farm women's shoulders. Among the many industrial victories that are behind this revolution, none is more important than wider knowledge of piping materials and better materials. One of the highly prized chapters of our history is the contribution that Crane research and valve engineering has made to the general advance. The results of this research are embodied ina Cra,ne book, Pioneer- ing in Science. It is a fascinating story of engi- neering development and a valuable refer-ence work for engineering students.

Cameron Tuesday, March 18, 1930 LECTURES Our colleague last week bewailed the fact that so few students attended the lectures g1ven on the campus, noting the fact that although the speakers are brought here primarily :fo1· the benefit of the unde1·graduates, the audiences are composed mainly of faculty members and townspeople. Wonde1·ing just what the cause of this lack of a-ttendance was, we conducted a cursory investigation amorig members of the Student body. The reason generally given for failure to attend was that, in many cases, quizzes were being given th€ next day. It 1s obvious that this is by no means the sole reason for fhe lack of undergraduate at- 1tendance at the lectures, but it IS equcally true that it is a contributory cause. Many students are forced to miss lectures they want to hear, because of the necessity for preparation for exams. If it were possible to notify all mem- bers of the faculty, some •time m advance, of the date of 'each lecture and to request that no qmzzes be given the following day, the lect- ures might prove of more va.lue to the Student body.

At the same temperature, at various stresses,. it will be given the same test for the same time-period.

The contribution made by C-rane. metallurgists to scientific knowledg€! of the reaction of metals under high pressures and temperatures is known and respected throughout the world, is familiar to every oil man who has used the cia.cking process and every engineer who has to clo with piping.

The alterations which were begun last fal·l, will make this sec- tion as modern as the two already completed, namely the middle sec- tion of South College and the south section of North College. Al- though this work could be com- ·pleted in short order if necessary it was thought that there would be no reason for so doing since the students living in t.he dormitories have adequate accornodations. About $2o,ooo is being spent on this section alone. All of the or- iginal building that will be left will be the walls and a few floor beams. The partitions have all been re- placed, the halls and lavatories have been tiled, and. an entire new bath has been installed on the first floor. The only change in size that has been made is the ad- clition of a closet in the front as well as in the rear rooms.
