This resolution he put into effect; and on February 2.8, 1849, he arrived here on the steamer California. He had a checkered career, making and losing several fortunes. Death of Lewis C.

His early education was obtained in such schools as the neighborhood of his native town afford- ed, and afterward at a college preparatory school at JYfanchester, where he continued his studies until his entrance to Union, graduating in the class of i87o.

Dr. Wells delivered in the chapel on Thursday, April r 3th, the second in the series of lectures. There were present besides the students a number of townspeople. The Dr. said in part : After having in our previous lecture dis- cussed the Mediterranean sea in a general \vay we \vill in the present lecture devote our- selves to a vie\v, so to speak, of that fatnous European resort, the Riviera. It extends, that is practicalLy, fron1 Toulon to St. Ren1o or Mentone. 1 ... his is the French Riviera, while to the east extends the Italian Riviera as far as Genoa or even Pisa. .l\.s regards the French Riviera, through- out its entire course the coast presents a beautiful and diversifie:d picture to the o~­ server. The delightful clin1ate, the grandeur of its mountains, cliffs and pron1ontories, the beauty and peacefulness of its bays and inden- tations, the richness of its foliage and vegeta- tion all contribute to tnake it one of the tnost . beautiful places in the \Yorld. Throughout the entire coast the predotni- nating influence, strange to say, is not French but English. It \vas the English tourists who discovered its charms and \vho yet uphold them, fill its hotels, support its public institu- tions and provide a greater portion of the capital necessary for the operation of its tnany enterprises. It is jokingly said that in many places, even amon~ tb~ poorer classes, nucleus of the English population. The visits of royalty and the nobility to certain spots on the coast have rendered those spots very popular to the traveling public, to whon1 the fact that the \ Queen once stopped here\ gives an additional charm to an already attractive place. The centre of the gayety and pleasures of the French l{iviera is the city of Nice, tvventy years ago tributary to Italy, but i1o\v in French territory. There especially, have the English full sway. rfhere are tvventy thousand English inhabitants, and it is they whc sup- port all the public works, baths, g~rdens, etc. Representatives of all the nations of the world · are to be found here, and it is 5aid that evety language of the world with the excel)tion of t_he French, is heard here. It is in Nice that occur the famous battles of the flowers, a species of the carnival of southern Italy. In the past the carnivals \vere the great events of the year at Nice, but recently they have become so co1nn1on as to be used as a advertising schen1e, thus destroy- ing, to a great extent, ail their novelty. and charm. The country'surrounding Nice is beautiful, and the view that one is enabled to see while driving on the Corniche Road, a road hewn out of the mountain side, are charming be- yond description.
