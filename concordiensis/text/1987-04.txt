By the second day a lot ()(classes were close to closing ()lilt, but that wasn't displayed CJ!ll the computer.'' When ask::e!d why so many students veer~ shut out of many of their desired courses to begin with, Wl)lf :responded that the registru' s uffice · can only \work i'ii-th what they are given.\ 'lbis spring term tpey were ·gi\Ven less than ·usual (Please see table, p .. 5). The lack of offerell courses is due, in all proba~ilit)', to the faculty load cut tllat was enacted the precedin!; academic year. Professorsl!llust now offer only six course:s. a year rather than the seve11 tlta:t were previously required. Apparently the trend towards ElCJs(H)uts as a result of CCJntimued on page 2 doubled. The Annual Fund is design.-ed to gain contributions primarily from alwnni, but also paren.t!5, friends of Union College, and corporation matching programs. This money- ~s used by the Trustees in the budget wherever they deam n.oecessary. Money from the Allnual Fund allows the Trustees flexibility that they other~ist~ would not have.

The first was to enhance the miX of students, According to the April3 issue of · The Chronicle, \The SAT cannot escape the cultural bias and handicaps certain groups, including women and minority · students.\ Nourse's comments agreed with this ·observation. Said he, \If we sole- ly based admissions_ on S~ T scores, our college commumty would be a community up upper middle income, well-to-do students: a very homogeneous student body.\ Moreover, studies that have been con- ducted by Bate::; College sup• ports that the SAT is not a better indicator of a student's college performance than a student:s · high school performance or hlS Stalemate In Sigma Phi Decision rernark;:tble increase as due to alumni, the principle con· tributor.:~, who are supporting an ideeal.\ Decker also described alumni as \satisfied customers\-they want to give back Vibat they received from Union. Decker stated that they are concentrating their efforts on the y()llnger, more recent grad~tes. His reasoning was Individual Member Found Guilty, Suspended By JON COHN Since last term, the Sigma Phi fraternity has been under close scrutinization by the college, due to the seizure of marijuana plants in the house. The illcident has put the school in the difficult position of . determining what should be done in res!XJnse to the crime, a felony irl this country. Acc.ording to De a11 of Students Joseph Mammola, the new developments of the issue have moved the focus flf the punislunent from the llo11se to an individual. \The collE@~ has identified one student wruo was most responsible f()t' in- troducing and producing a large amount ()if marijuana in tile Sig Phi fraternity'', said thE Dean. He went on to say, \1'hat following a hearing by the conduct committee, the st11dent i was found guilty of chargEs and e has been suspended indefin:itely rn by the college.'' § The important point .the Dean ,! wanted t() make was hi)W the a! school will deal with the ~ fraternity as a whole following s the hearing. In a well tb()ught .§_ out r~(»J1Se to the q11estlon, be said that Sig Phi \has inllit:ated to the college, by means l)f a letter published in the Con- cord.iensi9,. that they would like to take p()sitive steps this current spring term to prove to the colteg~ that they did not condone tile actions of the suspende(i individual.

CONCORDIENSIS,- April 9, 1981 Union's Annual Fund Has More Than Doubled Since 1976 Continued from page 1 that · contJ;-illuting becomes a habit, and ii only becomes a habit whem giving begins im- mediately .after graduation. We based his statement on statistics that indicated a continuity ()f giving. He also wanted to stress the fact that small do!lations do make a difference. . • • Decker explained this remarkable increase as due to alumni • • • who are \supporting an i~eal.\ requires donations o:f $5,0000 or more. Each .()f these organizations is volru1tarUy run and maintained. Decker at- tributed the upsurge in donations in the last four and five years to volunteers. In the Leadership Gifts COmmittee, every class had a bead agent and to assist hirn-het are asso~iate agents-numbering about 1,000. the total for 1984 to 1986. Union is, therefore, in the top 1 percent of alwnni participation in U.S. 11Jliversities. Decker described such a high level of par- ticipation as a \healthy sign for a c<>llege.\ He said it indicated a belief in Union and a desire for alumni to stay in contact with one another. Pre~ently, Gordon L. Decker is Director of Development. The College Resources Office is headed by Robert B. RQsmussen, Vice President for C()llege Resources. . ' ' Vice-President of College Resources Robert 8. Rasmussen. There are four means of soliciting money: the Terrace. Council, the ~Inner Circle, Regional C()mmittees, and ·the Leadership Gifts Committee. Each use phonathons te contact alwnni. The Terrace Council asks for dconations from $l,OOo- 4,9999, while the Inner Circle The Annual Fund gives the Trustees, who decide the budget, extra money to apply to the operating costs (i.e. professors' salaries, new books for the library, light bulbs, etc.) of Union. For example, the Fund moderated a potentially severe economic pro-blem when in 1974 the price of h~ating oil sky rocketed. The money was there for such an llnexpected event.

HONIG Dean o:f Students Joseph Mamrnola is !l~W in the process of evall~ating some 100 ap-- plications for Associate Dean of Students that he received after local and national ad- vertisements in newspapers and journals. Robert Massa, while leaving his positim as associate Dean of Students .at Union, will be s:erving as . Associat~ Vice President for Academic Affairs at Trinity C.ollege in San Antonio, Texas. Massa com- mented taat his replacement should understand the role of discipline, the place of fraternities and sororities, and \ ... show a gEnuine concern for the issues and problems students often face.\ Massa added, in a March interview, that he regretted ''the timing of all this.\ But he added by saying that \we do have very capable people ... to ea~e the transition between my departure and the ap[>ointment of my successor.\ So .during this month, Mammola will narrow the applicant pool down t() four. At that point, each candidate will have an interview, and will mingle with the . faculty members and the students. Mammola hopes thai the new assistant will assume responsibility May 1. He added that until that point, \I'll hold the ship as best I call.\ Continued from page 1 school .students graduating in the top 10 percent of their class and who met other specified requirements so as to receive aid in the form of jobs and grants; and four, the approved changes in admissions. Tbe fourth recommendation, besides the. establishment of SAT's as optional, called for an encouragement of applicants to submit a written or creative piece ()f work that was prepared for a school assignment and graded. This added criteria would allew for students that are strong in the arts and htunanities to show their talents and hopefully not be discouraged to apply due to their GPAs, high school ranks, ortestscores. Furthermore, the recommendation called for an increase in emphasis by the admissions' office in advanced placement, \quality of course selection,\ extra-curricular activity, and steady per- formance evident throughout the senior year. Professor Adrian Frazier, Humanities Representative said, \The entille package ofproposals, not OA applications are available now in Whital<er House and at the box office in Old Chape,~. Applications are ·due April 17 in the Student Affairs Office· located in ' . Whitaker House. Upon returning your application you may sign up for an intervie·w just SATs, but the possibility that students are able to submit written as well as creative projects should cast the school in a different light.\ The task force's members were Prt>fessors Underwood (former Chair), Lewis, Hassib, Frazier, Lambert (Chair), and Deans No-urse and Weiner. Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies Terry We-iner. The creation of the task force was initiated by a concern in the College's future admissions. According to the report, there were four factors that the ad- missions office had to deal with I when revising its policies and pr()cedures: first, \the I dramatic reduction in the size of the 18 year old cohort in New Tuesday, April7, Thursday, April 9, Wednesday, April15, Thursday, April16, York State until the middle of the next decade; \ second, the fact that tuition costs at private college's are sufficiently high and growing; third, the growing popularity of public univer- sities; and fourth, increasing competition among smaller private colleges for the \same pool of students.\ The decision to make SATs optional was one which was thoroughly researched. The task force l()oked at Bowdoin's and Bates' implementation and experience with the policy. (Bowdoin was the first to abandon the SAT as a basis for admission in 1970; Bates followed just recently in 1984.) The findings supported the committee's belief that by making the SAT optional, the College had' much to benefit. Commented Nourse on the condition of this new policy, \We have no intention of allowing this to diminish the quality of the educational standards here. If we get any indication of such, adjustments will be made.\ Presently, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Affairs Terry Weiner will be supervising the implementation of the new policy. \I tllink that my role h~re is to develop a study to give some sort of indication to the impact that the policy will have.'' A report is scheduled for 1992 that will report the findings for the four year period based on the first graduating class that will have been admitted under the new admissions policy.

A large· variety of activities, workshops, speakers and events were scheduled throughout the week to address issues that women are facing today and identify con- tempor-ary women's concems. The members of the 19~7 Women's Week Planning Committee are Fran Czajka, M()lly Herdic, Sigrid Juncker ~ Robin Palladino, Yvonne Szymko, Chris Telesca a10!d Amy Walsh, with Joan[Je T()biessen serving as faculty moderator.

A Doubles Tennis Tournament will take place later in the afternoon. favor of any creativity that the women expressed. Of tl}e many attributes and deficits that Union College possesses, the topic of interest to these women was the social environment at Union. One of the problems they noted is the homogeneity of our campus. It is undoubtedly difficult to be \different'' here without ex- periencing feelings of not being accepted. They also examined questions as to how our friend~ ships develop, and how we in- teract on campus to meet new people. By means of a \map\ of ideas, at which the center was the \terrific social set-up\ the participants wrote any ioeas for improving the sodal en• vironment here at Union. Some of the ideas included the availabilityof an all·night social center. This would allow students to meet with friends for coffee or to socialize at any time.Another addi\essed the importance of student-,faculty interaction in a ''social professorship\. Each yea.r, Union would hypothetically free one professor from all other duties to work solely with any student .groups to orgai!i7;e or create new social opportunities. This would ensure guidance on a continuous basis. A shuttle- bus Service to promote inter- registration £or courses at Siena, SUNY A or RPI and social interaction between these Capital District students was further suggested. The W():rrlen also expressed an interest in the increase of flexibility of housing at Union. Perhaps more students· could enjoy Smith or Bronner House if the occupancy was changed on a termly basis. Although there were many more events in the week's lirae- up, some of the highlights in- cluded.: \Imagining an Ideal Union' '·-a workshop headed by Brin Quell as a brainstorming sessi<>nto allow women students to develop creative ideas for. change as they saw fit at Uni()n, The ideas resulting from this workshop were then presented at the dinner for women faculty and students on Tuesday. \Tile Next Step\ jointly sponsorEd by the Society of Women Engi11eers and the Plannmg Women's Week T·shirts designed by Rebecca Ruoff will be on sale through Friday for $5 on the Library Plaza betw~en 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Also ()11 sale is a book on health concer-ns for women, \Our Bodies, Our- selves\ offered at half-price for $8.50. Joanne Tobiessen, faculty moc:;lerator. The above ideas were simply a sainple·of the topics discussed in a two-hol,!.r period on Monday. !fhestl students firmly believe that individuals CAN make a difference and through their participation, made .suggestions to address important issues that affect our lives at Union. Philosophy Forum: On the Subject of Law School By D. C. STUBBINS On Wednesday, April 1, D1·. Charels Bosk of the Sociology Department of the University CJf Pennsylvania met with students Df the Philosophy Forum to clisc:uss his view of law school as ed11ca tional institutionf!. Dr. Bosk' s insights were .unique because he himself took: a sabbatical from teaching ~t the University of Pennsylvania Law School. This enabled him to see his law education from the three-fold perspective ()£ professor, sociologist, amd stu.dent. Many of Bosk's ob- servations reflected negatively ()ll the law school environme11t. He commented that the law students were isolated from other student populations ~t the university. He critized the curriculum as lleing unimaginative, unintelled:ual, and too compartmentalized. For Bosk, areas which were unsuccessfully addressed by law schQ?ls were legal ethics and the relationship between justice and the law. Im his opinion, far more attentio11 was devoted to the task of legal problem-solving making law school resemble. a trade school more than a branch ()l the university. While not wholly condemning the law scho()ls for .this, Bosk felt that it W!Ul im· portant for S()ciety to iJe aware of this pr()cess and to re- evaluate tile status of both lawyers e~i:ld · the legal profession.

FEATURES Mexico_· '87 - • ·- - - • < By DIANE.ROSE and JANE BARKIN Waking up to Schenecta- weather just does not compare to the guaranteed sunshine in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Even though classes started at 8:00 in the morning (ugh), the weather was warm and beautiful, the sure-fire mood enahancer. We lived with families so most of us got home-cooked breakfasts which was also a great time to talk with your Mexican Mamas. The home was where we learned the most by talking with different family members, participating and eating meals --together. The fpmilies were warm, giving, and generally speaking, couldn't do enough for us. That was our consensus aboat the Mexican people in .general, with exceptions, of cour~e. Living with a family enables you to participate in the culture, strengthens your language skills, and provides a ca-ring· atmosphere making your stay easier. Oar day started out fairly - early. We either walked to school, or our Mexican family drove us in the rooming. We had three hours o-f intensive Spanish, followed by two hours of \Mini-courses\ and finally, a modified literature class taught by professor Pilar Moyano .. We had breaks approximat~ly every hour which was often fade-prevention time. At 2:00 we went home for 'comida', \the main meal of the day, the equivalent of dinner, After gorging on often interesting foods, it was customary to take a siesta, or our afternoon nap. Family memtiers · returned to work at 4:00 and we either returned to the school for. an evening class, or wandered into town to meet our friends. We frequented .a bar called LaFraglia, famo11s for its pizza and two-foot beers, Horny's Grill, a sunny place for shady people, and sex:to Sol. Both Mexicans and Americans frequented these places so we all had Mexican friends as well. Most weekends we were free to do as we pleased. Some travelled to the coastal resort towns of Iztapa and Acapulco, and others to Mexico City to play. The whole group spent a weekend visiting Puebla, a European ... looking city. There we saw President Miguel de laMadrld ·m a parade. We also took a day trip to ancient Aztec pyramid ruins called Teotihuacan-certainly a sight not to miss. We had a break during the seventh week. Some parents came down to visit, While others in the group travelled to Oaxaca and Puerto Escondido, a deserted beach and hippie hangout. Unfortunately, Puerto E~ondido will probably. be another Acapulco within the next five years, but definitely a place worth visiting now. Studying in a foreign country, particularly Mexico, can be a frustrating , confusing, challenging, and yet rewarding experience. Altho ugh technologically deficient at times, Mexico and its people have much to offer, including the rich traditional culture. All in all, we learned a lot about Mexico and ourselves, and had a good time learning.

Jeans Shortened Charge Accounts Welcome What's the Funniest to You Over Fitness With . . By MARJORIE. HOFFER Some students are in great shape these days, «Jf course the new gym has been encouraging· -but long before it opened many students have been taking advantage of aerobics classes taught on campus. The majority of classes are taught by senior Fran Fragasso. Not on1y are her classes free, but she is responsible with help from Mrs. Marra, for forming aerobics into a club and increasing its popularity. Last year, after the school could not · allow the paid aerobics to contillue for in- surance reasons,. Fran ap- proached Mrs. Marra with the idea of reintroducing aerobics. The classes began in Old Chapel. With the gym and Carnegie both under con· struction, no other room was available. Since then, students have sweated it out in the field house, and worst of all, the basement of social sciences. Now, the classes are taught in the exercise room of the alwnni gym. Complete wi1h wiridows, Fran is grateful that there is a place and organi:zed aerobic instruction available to the Union commun!ty. A former commercial model; Fran was working in California where the fitness craze began. She wa·s told by her agency that in order to get in shape, she had to begin a strict exercise :routine. This involved rwming twenty-one flights of stairs six times, doing nautilus, and aerobics. Before that time, Fran had never been seriollS about exercise, but says that after she started working out she became \addicted to it.'' Fragasso's next move was to England where she was studying at a university for two years. She said that in England it was difficult to exercise, but she kept fit by running stairs in a twenty-story dorni, jogging, and lifting weights on an \ancient universal system.\ . Returning back home, Fran entered Union a year ago. Now a commuter, she joined.a local health club to help her stay in shape. One· of the aerobics in- structors approached her and asked her if she would like to teach a class. Figuring that teaching a class would be a good way to stick to her workout, Fran has been instructing ever since. It took her about nine months to feel comfortable teaching a class. She said that the difficult aspects of teaching have been talking in front of a class, getting the timing down, and knowing when to switch exercises. Although Fran teaches at Union, she also works at the health club on Tuesdays and Thursday. Sometimes she admits that leading a class can YES it is final/ . Please join us for lunch Fridays at 12:30 in HALE HOUSE Thing Thal Happened Spring Brea~? \1 abnost drove off with an old lady's foot out the door.\ \I met a guy in a gross bar and. talked philosophy with 'h' '' un. , \I set off my neighbor's alarm at 3:30 in 'the morning.\ ·\I met a Zeeb at a switnnling pool in century village.'' \I found out my ex-bOytrtend was a year younger than me. I guess that's why he was so immature.'' \I got my hair beaded.\ \I spent a half an hour looking for my car in the wrong parking lot.,; \My friend locked the keys in his ear with the engine running and we had to call the police.\ \Our hotel overbooked and sent us to the nicest hotelon the island with extra nights and a free dinner.\ · \Well I didn 1 t exactly rub my sunscreen in right ... \ \[ stayed home and got a tan.\ \I met a girl who didn't complain.\ \I was taking my final, lost track of time, and was so late getting to the airport that I almost missed my plane.\ \Throughout high school there was this girl who had a crush on me and annoyed me. Well, who do you think I saw in Florida? ? ? ? \ Fran be difficult if she is tired. Because she is the motivator, she obviously cannot stop nor . look like she is about to give up. Although Fran admits she now breaks less of a sweat, some days are not easy, even for the instructor. However, she said that she has tried to do aerobics on her own, and she was unable to keep up without a class to push her. At this point, Fran believes that the most challenging part of her sessions is far from com- pleting the routine, but trying to find new ways to decrease the monotony of the warmup and cool down. Every two months, Fran attends a required meeting for the employees of her health club. An aerobics instructor from Rochester comes to conduct a class to make certain all the aerobics _instructors are in shape. From the instructor, Fran says she learns new moves but also tends to imitate his \drill sergeant\ mannerisms. She. also gains new ideas from taking classes in different parts of the country. For the students who attend aerobics regularly, Fran says she has definitely noticed an improvement in their en- durance and body tone. Fragasso also feels that changes made in the music have helped to improve the classes. She used to use a tape issued by the health club. Now, she has tapes made by professional DJ's. Aspects within aerobics itself ate changing. For example, due to an increase in injuries, low impact aerobics which involve less high kicking and an in- crease in upper ann movement are becoming more popular. Also, aerobics instructors will soon be required to attend a training session in order to be certified (Fran adds that she is CPR certified) .. With an average class bur- ning up --500 calories, it is no wonder Fran does not watch her weight to maintain her pencil thin figure. Believing that people should exercise at least twenty minutes every other day, she says that \... it takes about one and a half months to feel comfortable in most aerobics classes.\ Although Fran is very pleased With the popularity of her aerobics classes at Union, she wishes that more males participated. Graduating this spring with a degree in . English, Fran Fragasso will leave Union and enter law school. Although she is happy to have done a lot of ''little things,\ Fran will now be concentrating on her graduate studies. Most students in their four years are unable to ac- complish what Fran has in two. She will be leaving with a \high impact\ at Union, for aerobics are now an established part of the athletic program. Next year they will be taught by Gina Mancuso and Diana Sciocchetti.

II Face\ an inter-religious bulletin of ADL spo~e to the audience about freedom and Passover. Klenicki stated that Passover focuses on ·an exile and return to slavery. Moreover~ he noted the value of freedom to practice religion. \To be religiously free means to follow discipline and that is what Passover points to~ 1 ' says Klenicki. Klenicki also stressed the flolocaust as a 20th century Exodus experience. ''Time has stopped, and continued. We were there, and then a few years later, not even there.\ In conclusion, Klenicki added the necessity for new discipliil.es to face the 20th century challenges of time~ The second speaker of the evening, Dr. Eugene Risher; was appointed by Pope John Paul II to be consultor to the Vatican Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews, and is also of \Faith Without Prejudice: Rebuilding Christian Attitudes Toward Judaism.\ Dr. Fisher spoke about the importance of Christian· Judeo relations because religions have interpretations of the same events. Dr. Fisher stated that ''Easter is our Pass()ver feast.'' Dr. Fisher also touched on other important themes such as the transition between death and life, and how Christians view life that \hope is possible.'' Moreover, Dr. Fisher men- tion~d the \eVil· of the con- centration camps,'' and made clear that that in l;)rderto accept the validity of Christianity the validity of Judaism must .also be ·accepted. ReverendDr. Robert Everett, the Protestant Chaplain at Farleigb Dickinson University, and author of \Dealing Honestly with Jews and Judaism: A Study . in the Thought .of James Parkes\ spoke extensively about freedom. \The idea of freedom, what does it mean?'' Everett asked the audience. He then stressed how Americans accept freedom and don't think about it,. and the extensive fighting W.orldwide because of lack of freedom. \People want t() have · freedom, but have fears of being :free. Freedom is more than being happy. It is better being dumb and happy than smart and not free,\ added Evenett. · Finally in discussing religion, Everett emphasized that ''Religion is dangerous when one tries to prove how religious one really is.\ \The discussion seemed to accomplish a lot,'' said Mr. David Bodrrian, the Assistant. Protestant Chaplain at Union1 and the moderator of the dialogue. \At a Liberal Arts school it is good to initiate dialogue for people in order to acqUire ap- preciation for different backgrounds,'' added· Bodman.

Pag~ 10 F~unr.kd at llnion Col/eg~ /8.77 ------------~ ~~----- Spring Registration Union students recently experienced a frustrating and disappointing registration process. 'fbe vast majority of freshmen and sophomores-· and many upperclassmen as well-were \closed out\ .of some or all of their desired courses. The reasons are many (see article p. 1) but one fact remains: the students, through Concordiensis, foresaw the problems and their causes and even promoted solutions, all of which apparently went unheard. At last year's \State of the Union\ conference, several students expressed dissatisfaction with a registration system that allowed oversized, ineffective classes as well as frequent closeouts. One Concordiensis editor proposed an alternative system, wherein academic departments could survey student interest earlier in the term, perhaps during sixth week, in order to anticipate areas of extreme interest and plan course sections. The reply: it was not feasible. Beginning that spring, at least two depart- ments began using such a system economics and political science. A Concordiensis article Jan. 29, 1987 detailed the benefits of the plan. Still, no other departments we know of have followed suit. Even those two departments seem to have been unable to meet the high demand for their <:?ourses, which suggests that even more problems exist. Registrar Dwight Wolf delineates several of them in the registration article (p. 1 ). Some are technical, due to computer programs and student abuse af the card system. However, the most fundamental problem stems from Admini&tration policy, which students and Concordiensis CONCORJJIENSJS, April 9, 1987 LETTERS . - - - - - . .. . . . . - . . . .

Now then, mightn't we be dom:g something which leads otbe~s(i..e. t~ose who CQmpiled the bst of whtch schools we are concerned) to believe dif- ferenUy? One recent example of how we may be doing so is Union's deci~ion to drop the reqmre~ent for the SAT test for prospective students. The SAT test may have some minor imperfections, but to allege that it is biased with respect to a person's sex, as Union is ma.intaining; seems slightly ludicrous. Can we not find a less drastic alternative by which to equate the number of respective males and females here at Unlon•t Also:..•couldn't this action further decrease our. chances of being included among the nation's most re.spected places of higher learning?

Union offered a second 1 , registration for freshmen and sophomores, but that was an emergency effort that ()nly eased, not corrected, the situation. Yes, you guessed it. At' 1 State of the Urrion, '' another Con- cordiensis editor pointed out that courses load reduction without immediate hiring would increase class size and an article next week put it in print. The reply: gradual hiring would be sufficient to compensate. Apparently, hiring did not keep pace with the reduction. No, the students aren't always right, and the ad- ministration isn't always wrong. But student perspective can foresee problems that administrators don't always see, and the College should heed that foresight and use it for the best interests of the school. Mandatory SAT Scores Dropped As ·Of J }IIY 1 submission of Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scor~s will no longer be mandatory for applicants to Union. Studies have shown that the SAT score does not provide an accurate method for screening prospective students. ''!he SAT cannot escape the cultural bias ... and han· diCap~ certain groups, women and minority students being the prime. examples.'' (President Morris) Furthermore, it has been Judged that the SATs do not measure a student's ability to do well in college any better than high school grades. In. the future, Admissions will rely on the College Board's Achi.evement t~sts .and the score on the American College Testmg Exammatwn as standarized measurements of prospective studeti~s. The college. is also encouraging applicants to subrmt ex:amples of creative work talent proj~cts. and assignments from high school as part of thei; applicatiOn. Thus, talented students who might have ot~~rwise been deterred from applying because their abilities were not reflected through the SAT's will be en- couraged to apply. The decision to eliminate the mandatory SAT score was ~ade i[ol hopes that this will increase the applicant pool, and Its social and demographic diversity. Studies· have in- dicated that at Bates and Bodowin, two other colleges ~hi~h have a.dopted this admissions policy, these ob- Jectives are bemg fulfilled. Dean of Admissions, K.

The building itself fits well with the remaining bUilding of the old Altimni Gym as well as with the surroun<,ting buildings of Bailey Hall, the Schaffer Library, and the Science and Engineering Building in its use of dark brown stucco on the exterior~ Its low height sUf- ficiently hides its massive size. The gym is clearly in keeping with current Postmodern ar~ Chitecture. It retains the basic classical elements of the old build~g in its engaged concrete columns and the white moulding above the main en- trance, The large round occuli arowtd the section housing th(' pool resemble those of the lobby of Philip Johnson's AT&'l The addition to the alumni gym i.s well integrated into the campus and its surrounding architecture. Furthermore, the new addition and the already existing alumni gym have been well integrated .to form a single, cohesive building. The new addition and old section of the alumni gym have been integrated. by means of exterior colors: the new ad- dition is painted the same mauve,color as the alumni gym. Furthermore, the strip of wall just before the wall meets the roof has been painted white on Many people are celebrating the opening of the newly .renovated Alumni Gym com- plex, which seems to be an example of Union's ability to thoroushly think through and. complete a project. It was very important to the campus morale to have the structure finished~ The exterior of the addition was finished along the same theme as the older section, by the use of grey stucco and concrete pillars. The windows on the newer section, while very attractive,. don't seem to be of the same style as the older ones. This, l!owever, is not terribly noticeable, due to the fact that the older · style windows are basically restricted to the front. One area they need to pay at- tenticln to is a smaller band of Buildingand create an exterior · illumination at night, together · with .. the sky light, that is very aesthetically pleasing. The use of the ~ngled sky light and the same type of ,glass-block in the setnici:r.cular main entrance is reminiscent of James Stirling;s Engineering Faculty Building at Leicester University and of the rear interior courtyard of · the AT&T Building. The interior of the gym is divided into two levels and all of the facilities are easily ac- cessible--fQr participation or observation--from the main lobby which is .between them. The preservation of the former . exterior wall of the west facade of the old gym on the upper level of the addition gives a . nice sense of history and growth to the entire complex whiCh, in tliis way, reflects the whole campus. · the alunmi gym, and this ~arne strip on the new addition has been made white using cement. As a .result, the walls between the two flow together in an even, pleasing pattern. When you look at the Science and .Engineering Building, you realize that the exterior colors of this building ·are also predominantly dark with a strjp of white cement just before the roof. As a result, the fa~ade is outlined at the top with a white strip as is the now cohesive unit which sits to its right--the new addition and alumni gym. windows along the upper roofline. This strip incorporates several decrepit looking win- dows and vents, not at all up to tne standards of the rest of the exterior. The newly sandblasted embl~ms on the front, however, are an .attractive ornament on the grey facade. The interior is nicely detailed. The color theme of'the walls and floor, as well as the textures, connect the older and newer sections. By keeping the facade of the exterior wall, a more relax.ing and interesting ap- pearance is created in the hallways. The gym and pool · sections are both finished to an optimum level. The basement incorporates a series of logically placed weight rooms and locker rooms. .

When one looks at the outside of the building it becomes evident that not only does tile addition not fit in with the architectural style of the campus, it doesn't even fit within the original style. it was supposed to add to! Although · the inside of the building adds much to campus life and in this way meets its original criteria, the outside is a bland, institutional looking structure that I wouldn't even w~nt to attempt to try to label under one of the architectural styles we have studied this term. Moreover, it is a lame attempt to work the Classical style into this no-name work. Fake columns corner the structure along with its glass doorway entrance and are of- fensive in their half•hearted attempt to represent the \Classical style.\ The outside of the building is finished in an ugly stucco design that could have at least copied the same GRENADA ST. VINCENT the building; hence, the onlooker can distinguish the original Gym from its additions. The additions also stand out because the building is in a larger scale than the rest of the campus. As mentioned earlier, the large slabs of concrete do not mingle with the nearby architecture of the Library or Bailey Hall. The fact that the Gym's addition houses a swinuning pool creates an awk- ward inner area to light. To solve this, the architect ·chose large round windows, which, as mentioned earlier, is a motif already found on campus. However, these windows, which are about six feet in diameter, look like portholes from the outside, leading one to wonder what is on the inside. In fact, this observation is made so often that a mock legend has been spreading the campus that on a clear night, with a good view from the Library, one can see a steamship trudging through the campus. In conclusion, it should be said that the architects and the College did not entirely ignore the character of Ramee's · original plans. The building of the additions were catered to the original Alumni Gym so as not. to destroy its original structure. While those involved are not guilty of claims that no considerations were made for the campus, nevertheless they should realize that the efforts made were not entirely suc- cessful. Work on the Gym is com- pleted. Its presence on the campus has become a fixture. And Union College must live with its Titanic. style and color of some of the other buildings on campus. Also, when facing the Schaeffer. Library, with its rounded- arched windows one wonders what the architects were thinking when they created the.ir \porthole\ style windows. The addition, the Altunni Gym largely fails to com- plement the original structure. Although this is difficult to do, the architects have made no effort at representing this style. In that sense, the building is a failure.

Chapman was equally as honest in his assessment of the trouple's fihn projects. He was sharply critical of \The Meaning Of Life,\ claiming that it 'never had the kind of central theme on which their. peculiar brand of dry humor thrived. Chapman did admit that ''The Life of Brian'' was his favorite fibn of all time, and. in doing so, brought forth a rousing cheer from the audience.

Chapman spoke of his latest project involving the organization called ''The Dangerous Sports Club.\ In the wake of his adventure hanggliding over an a«:tive Ecuadoran volcano and par- ticipating in a ski race in which he competed in a Venetian gondola strapped to skis, Chapman is now a member of the club and hopes to make his next film about the antics of his fell@W clubbers. Chapman also spoke of the origins of the Monty Python trouple. Hired to perform as a \circus'' act for a BBC production, Chapman decided that a name of a cheap talent scnut-producer like Monty Python would be appropriate, and hence the name Monty Python's Flying Circus was born. Chapman emphasized the uniqueness of the troupe, and explained that their work is a product of their individual strengths and talents. Chapman assured the audience that the ··only material that the trouple performed was that which brought laughter from all members, and was, at least in their minds, humorous enough for public consumption. Chapman was equally as honest in his assessment of the trouple's film projects. He was sharply critical of \The Meaning Of Life,\ claiming that it never had the kind of central theme on which their peculiar brand of dry humor thrived. Chapman did admit that \The Life of Brian\ was his favorite film of all time, and in doing so, brought forth a rousing cheer from the audience. We enjoyed the show, and I thought that the atmosphere at RPI was super. It was a great way to get back into the new semester~ and now I look for- ward to the future and to more hilarity from the Monty Python Flying Circus. GERMAN TABLE Every Friday 12 : 30-1 : 30 P . M.

13 THE ARTS U2: The Joshua Tree By JIM M;ae!LAUGHLIN . Few bands have been subject to the praise md accolades that U2 has been given in the last two years. With tile arrival of their .fifth album, The JOSHUA TREE, many W()ndered if it would be an improvement on their 'last, · somewhat erratic effort, The UNFORGETTABLE FIRE. Take heart true fans, The JOSHUA. TREE is far better than F\IBE ·and should propel U2 CJ\lt of its label of. being the biggest cult band in the world. Wh.eFeas the UN- FORGETTA:&LE FIHE was for the most part a collection of eclectic ideas rather than songs,. the· JOSIIUA TREE is more in line, without com- promising any of U2's artistry. 02 kept. the pr(Jduction duo of Brian. Eno and Daniel Lanios, .yet returned t() ·old producer Steve Lillywhite for a few cuts. ·One Lillywhite mix, ''With or Without Yon,\ ts the. first single from the alblllTI and one .iJf the most erotic so11gs to come out in years.

Further, on \Joshua Tree,\ U2 allqvvs a little Blues and country to slip in on such songs as \R\UlningTo A Standstill,.\ and \Trip Through Your Wires.\ The most moving track on the album clearly is \One Tree Hill,'~ a song dedicated to the sudden death of one of their crew members. U2 doesn't evade its usual political topics either. Songs such as \Red Hill Mirting Townp\ which deals with the miserable existence of England's mining population is stirring; and \Mothers of the Disappeared,'' which is an elegant ballad on oppression in Chile 1 keep U2 in th~ foreground as the band that most stays away from conventio11al mainstream music cliches. What the album does lack is one clear hit single that will push U2 into the forefront of American music charts. \With or Without You\ may do it, but you can never tell in a land where Bon Jovi can reach number one. Along with the release of The JOSHUA TREE, U2 has kicked off a worldwide tour beginning here in the U.S. Typically, U2 tickets sell faster than anything .(except maybe for the Boss), and many arenas have already sold out five or si~ dates in a - matter of hours. But keep faith true fans, if you dori't get tickets for the 1;1pring, U2 will he back in the U.S. come late summer. Irish Band U2 Rock Group Stryper Says To Hell- With The Devl By PAUL EDWARDS Many hard rock bands have been criticized for lyrics dealing with sex, drugs, or violence. But at the RPI Fieldhouse on March 10, a band called Stryper showed that heavy metal can carry a positive message. Stryper is a .hard rock quartet who stand out from among other rock groups by singing songs about God and about people's relationships with Him.

Stryper has also had to overcome personal obstacles. Some of the band members were drug users before they decided to follow God. At the RPI concert, lead singer Michael Sweet told his audience that drugs coJJld only provide a phony temporary security, while perfect peace and security could only be found by living with God and following Him. Violinist Itzhak Perlman _ their message and musical talent: Stryper'.s album, Soldiers Under Command, had Consider the heavy MTV airplay given to Stt\yper's current album, it was sur- prising that the aud.ie11ce was most enthsuiastic overtl1e older · favorites, especially- the lightning-fast, 'God's Ue Rock That Makes Me Roll'.

Stryper gets its name from a passage in the Bible, \By His stripes we are healed.\ Christians believe this passage means that Christ died to pay the penalty for the sins of mankind, making God's forgiveness available to those who will believe in Him. Some Christians have wondered whether Stryper's hard-driving music might belittle the idea of God's glory, but those who attended the concert can attest to the sincerity of the band in its efforts to present a message that honors God. The Bible encollrilges its readers to \Make a joyful noise to the Lord,\ and Stryper uses the \noise\ of heavy metal to do just that.

In the intro we see ''Hi\ McDonnough (Nicholas Cage) as a rather poor stick-up man, going through the system's wheels of prison and parole a couple of dozen times. The piece has a sort of \Alice's Restaurant\ feel to it, filled with dry. witty dialogue. When the opening is over and the Intro-credits show up on the screen, it's almost kind of a let- down; as if the audience doesn't think the rest of the fihn will keep up with the first part: However, the second part is just as funny, with the break for credits coming as sort of a rest period for laughing. On the whole, the whole movie is out of the ordinary, and to its credit: quite hysterical. Directed by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan of BLOOD SIMPLE fame, RAISING ARIZONA is without a doubt one of the most original comedies to come out in years. Nicolas Cage as \Hi\ McDonnough decides to ' • go \straight\ and marries his old prison guard . Ed .(Holly Hunter). The two snare perfect wedded bliss except for the fact that they cannot have a baby. With adoption out of the question due to fli's prison record, the two decide to heist an infant from the Arizona family, Who recently had quintuplets. After the job is done, the McDonnoughs find thernselvesthe proud parents of Nathan Arizona Jr., heir to the Arizona Unfinished Furniture fortune. As one could probably guess, all does not go well £or the new parents as they have to contend with normal child- rearing problems such as pampers, prison pals, police, and the \Lone Biker from Hell''. The entire movie lends itself to laughter, right down to the camera work. The movie is set and fihned in a sort of Warner Bros. cartoon fashion. The camera work creates ISU PRESENTS International Film Festival laughter as if it were a character of its own, moving with odd close-ups and weird chase scenes. · All told, the mqvie just isn't normal compared to other comedies of recent release. The Coen brothers present a\. work that is vastly original in content' and style. · Nicolas Cage is perfect as the sleepy-eyed. Hi, redeeming bimself from the whiney, irritating perfortnance he gave in PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED. Also, Randall \Tex'' Cobb makes a hilarious debut as the \Lone Biker from Hell\ a cross between the Road Warrior and the Tasmanian Devil.

In the intre we see \Hi\ McDonnough (Nicholas Cage) as a rather peor stick-up man, going through the system's wheels of prison and parole a couple of dozen times. The piece has a sort of \Alice's Restaurant\ feel to it, filled with dry. witty dialogue. When the opening is over and the Intra-credits show up on the screen, it's almost kind of a let- down; as if the audience doesn't think the rest of the fihn will keep up with the first part. However, the second part is just as funny, with the break for credits coming as sort of a rest period for laughing. On the whole, the whole movie is out of the ordinary, and to its credit: quite hystericaL Directed by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan ef BLOOD SIMPLE fame, RAISING ARIZONA is without a doubt one of the most original comedies to come out in years. Nicolas Cage as \Hi\ McDonnough decides to ge \Straight\ and marries his old prison guard Ed (Holly Hunter). The two share perfect wedded bliss except for the fact that they cannot have a baby. With adoption out of the questian due to Hi's prison record, the two decide to heist an infant from the Arizona family, who recently had quintuplets. After the job is done, the McDonnoughs find themselves the proud parents of Nathan Arizona Jr., heir to tlle Arizona Unfinished Furniture fortune. As one could probably guess, all does not go well for the new parents as they have to contend with normal child- rearing problems such as pampers, prison pals, police, and the \Lone Biker from Hell\. The entire movie lends itself to laughter, right down to the camera work. The movie is set and filmed in a sort of Warner Bros. cartoon fashion. The camera work creates ISU PRESENTS International Film Festival laughter as if it were a character of its own, moving with odd close-ups and weird chase scenes. All told, the movie just isn't normal compared to other comedies of recent release. The Coen brothers present a work that is vastly original in content and style. Nicolas Cage is perfect as the sleepy-eyed Hi, redeeming himself from the whiney, irritating performance he gave in PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED. Also, Randall \Tex\ Cobb makes a hilarious debut as the \Lone Biker from Hell\ a cross between the Road Warrior and the Tasmanian Devil. Myself, as an impartial reviewer, found that I was laughing quite loudly in the theater, but noticed that I wasn't making a fool of myself, rather, was right in step with the rest of the audience.Film g r a d e : A c 0 \E 0 0 Q) :J C/) ell \0 -~ a; ::2: >. .0 0 ..... 0 ..c a.

During the past two years, Union's Physics and CheniiStry departments have each begun outreach programs designed to espose secondary school students and faculty to the excitement of contemporary scientific research. The Physics Department's program, coordinated by Professor Laszlo Baksay, encourages high schools to invite a lecturer from Union's physics faculty to talk about a topic of current interest drawing from actual student- faculty work being done at Union. The lectures are, ad- justed to a level which · the students can understand and offer the opportunity for a follow-up visit to Union's research facilities. In addition, faculty are available to discuss career opportunities in physics with interested students. One physics professor who has given talks at Greenwich Central School, Newcomb Central School, and St. John's Elementary School is Dr. Richard Magahiz. His· topics The Chemistry Department is also making an effort to become involved with high schools.Like the Physics Department, it has sent a letter offering to provide guest speakers and has recently had faculty give presen- tations.However, the depart- ment's main goal is to establish a link between secondary school teachers an<l college faculty as well as link.s among secondary Currently, the department has two programs in effect: the Bulletin Board System and the National Science Foundation · Honors Course. The BUlletin Board is a Macintosh Computer network that allows high school teachers to ,exchange in- formation aad provides a calendar of events such as talks and meetings tllat may be of interest. Twenty years ago, Union became one of the first schools to establish an NSF program, and has recently reinstated it. The program brings teachers here to take courses on such subjects as laser technology, computer hardware, and spectroscopy . and has a threefold goal: to bring teachers up to date on new developments, t() form con· nections, and to establish loyalty to Union among both teachers and their students.

' ~~· ' '· ' . ::· ~ \ . . ~· . '. ; By CHRISTINE DVORSKY During the past two years, Union's Physics and Chemistry departments have each begun outreach programs designed to espose secondary school students and faculty to the excitement of contemporary scientific researcb. The Physics Department's program, coordinated by Professor Laszlo Baksay, encourages high schools to invite a lecturer from Union's physics faculty to talk about a topic of currEnt interest drawing from actual student- faculty work being done at Union. The lectures are ad- justed to a level which the students can under-stand and offer the opportunity £or a follow-up visit to Union's research faeilities. In addition, faculty are available to discuss career opportunities in physics with interested students. One physics professor who has given talks at Greenwich Central School, Newcomb Central School, and St. John's Elementary School is Dr. Richard Magahiz. His topics have inchtd!HI \What It Is Like To Be &. Pilysicist\ and \Particle Pllysics''. He feels that b(}th students and teachers enjoyed thE presentations, which he f()und easy to make understa!lde~ble through the use of props such as magnets, a laser, and. a Geiger counter, and ample ()p:portunity to ask questions. Ali:hough he has no definite pla.ns fer future visits, he assured, \I find it enjoyable and plan to ,;o on.\ Professor Jay Newm.aE:l, who spoke in Saratoga, Sllenendehowa, and South Glells Falls schools, added that through a National Science f'o undation grant, courses are being held for high school sclenee teachers. The Chem.istry Department is also making: an effort to become involved with high schools.Like the Physics Department, it has sent a letter ~ffering to provide guest spea.ker:; and has recently had faculty- give presen- tations.Ho\VIEVer the depart- ment's rnairl gtlal is to establish a link betweetl secondary school teachers and college faculty as well as links £tmong secondary school teachers. In tbis way, according to Department Chair Professor Tom We!'ller, it is possible to make a long-term impact by whicl1 talented students will be enc~uraged in their study of science and at- tracted to Union. Currently, the deJJartment has two programs in effect: the Blllletin Board System and the National Science F()undation H()nors Course. The Bulletin Board is a Macintosh Computer network that allows high school teachers to exchange in- formation and provides a calendar of events such as talks and meetings that may be of interest. Twenty years ago, Union became one of the first schools to establish an NSF program, and has recently reinstated it. The program briNgs teachers here to take courses on such sullj ects as laser technology, computer hardware, and spectroscopy and has a threefold goal: to bring teachers up to date on new developments, to f()rm con- nections, and to establish loyalty to Union arn()ng both teachers and their stlldents. \AIDS Info\ This Spring, the Union College Student Affairs Administration is distr.ibuting information about AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases to each student at Union College. This information is objective, factual, and nonm.oralizing in nature. The distribution of this information represents tboth a concern over the increasing number of diagnosed AIDS <.ases in the general populatioll. as well as a belief system that A liDS is a preventable disease ir! .an informed community.

April9, 1987 Ruggers In a World of Their Own By JEFF ALBRECHT Union Rugby isn't a sport. it's a state of mind. · This past ·Saturday, Union proved this ·with a 3d-O shutout win against the RPI squad with only three days of practice in preparation for the game. The shutout-a product of Union's great Q.efensive play-is not uncommon to the Union ruggers. \The backs and the forwards (line and serum) had a swarming defense,\ felt senior Tom Muzzinigro. \There was great pursuit.\ Union's defense was put to the test early when five minutes into the first half, RPI was knocking on the door to Union's try zone with the ball set on less than the one meter line. But for more than five minutes, RPI kept being denied blr the defense of the Union ruggers. Soon the ball was cleared, and for the rest of the game, the ball didn't get .much closer than Union's 22 meter line. Union scored first at about ten minutes into the . first half. Junior John Baker fell ori a loose ball in the try zone for a quick four points. Junior eight- man Chris Sheridan, who took over kicking responsibilities for Union's first game of the season, converted the try for an extra two points. Union's second try of the game, and their last of the first half came off of a five-meter serum down { aa scrwn played five meters from the opposing try zone). Sophomore wing- forward Ed Vassallo dove on another loose ball in the right hand corner of the try-zone for four more. With the ball brought directly back along the sideline, Sheridan converted the try on a kick from a very difficult angle to put Union ahead by a score of 12-0 before the end of the first half. \We didn't do what we had worked out in the first half,\ said line-captain Josh Derechin .. Scrwn captain Jody Perkins agreed, \(In the first half) we didn't ruck. RPI was beating us on the rucks.\ In the second half, however, Derechin said that everyone was more relaxed, attributing a few of Union's first half mistakes to opening game nerves. it for four more. Sheridan missed the conversion-16-0. ~ The next try came when Muzzinigro, running down the field, kicked into high gear and ran 50 meters past every. de.fenseman for the score. Sllel\idan's conversion was good an<l the score grew to 22-0. The. next try came off of a liae-out around mid-field. Tluoughout the game, Union scrummers Dave Morrisson an<l Sheridan did a great job wrnning their lineouts on throws from the hand of sophomore !looker Steven Bordonaro, and sp<Jiling RPI's lineouts to gain possession of the ball. This was no exception. With a pass from B()rdonaro off of a two-man line oat, Sheridan grabbed the ball, was caught by an RPI defen- seman but passed off to co- captain Josh Derechin who ran the long way to the try zone without even being touched. The conversion was good, and the SC()re grew. And the score grew a little more on the sixth try of the game. Muzzinigro kicked the ball up ahead only to be recovered by junior Dave Webb this time who passed back to Nuzzinigro, who ran another 50 meters for four more. The C()l)version was successful and th.e score. grew to 34-0. Union's final try of the game came on another serum down near RPI's try-zone. Sheridan to()k the ball out of the scrwn and ran it weak-side into traffic, passed to Muzzinigro, who passed to Webb, and then finally out to Pat DiCierbo who ran it in f~r a try of his own on the left si<le ofthe try-zone. for one of the :prettiest lines of the day. DiCierbo came in with 1:9 minutes left in the game to repl'ace an injured Neiditz. Sheridan, who had made five out of his first six conversions, missed the seventh, and the fillal score read 38-0. As ... there were many bright spots for the Union squad on Saturday, pel\baps the brightest came from freshman V'Ving- forward Dave Austin. Mid;..wray through the second fu!llf, Vassallo left the game witJJ an injp.ry to his side, and Allstin · came in. Austi.rJ. in his first ever rugby game showed poise t~nd aggressiveness seen by lll()st veterans. Austin, along \nth many of the other new fre.sll• men, show a very talented Union future. Union's Killer B squad came out with similar success. 'They won their game by a scored 20~ 6.

Yellow J·ackets sting g·ridders 'l'he Union College Dutchmen dropped their. second straight game on Saturday at the hands Of the University of· Rochester . Yellow Jackets. This loss . lowered the Dutchmen to a record of no wins, and two losses, one of the worst starts in recent history. The Rochester offense easily ripped through the Union defensive line, resulting in many long runs from scrim- mage. Another source of the Yellow Jackets' offense came from the special teams unit, which put six points on the board with a seventy-five yard punt return,. and repeatedly put the team in good field position. From there, the Rochester quarterback was able to complete passes, and suc- cessfully execute running plays, effectively killing the ·clock and 'lowering the morale of the Union defense. Aside from the weak defen- sive line, penalties killed the Dutchmen in tbe twenty-four to twenty·embarrassment. The team committed ·close to a half- dozen personal fouls including ~ \roughing the kicker\ penalty which reslllted in a Rochestev score., Coach B.agnoli must teach his players how to 11se better judgment when it comes to committing costly penalties. One of the few bright spots for the Dutchmen was Sophom()l.\e running back Ryan Mason. Mason wasable\to penetrate t!J.e Rocheste[\ line, gaining a respectable amoWit of yardage against a somewhat stingy Rochester defense. The defense · was able to bold the Dutchmen both on the groWld (except for some of Mason's long runs) a11d in the air~- causing trouble fer the Union quarterbacks. Hopefully Al Bagnoli's Dutch- men will be able to recover from this humiliating loss at the hands of a team which tlley should have defeated. This Saturday they will travel to Hobart in search ()£ their first win of the yoWlg season. lf Coach Bagnoli plans on beillg involved in post-season play, be and h!s players must figure o~t how to get back on the winnilig track.

In each of the _past two seasons a yoWlg Union College women's softball team has posted a school-record 12-win season and been invited to the state postse;ison . tournament. Two years ago the Lady Dut- chmen won 10 of 13 regular season games (including their first eight) and finished the campaign with a 12-4 record and a third place finish in the in- . Sophomores Jennifer Stc>lz, Val Sarwin, and Lisa Tortorello are all expected to see time on :the moWld. Overall, Robert is pretty happy . with her defense, ,especially in the outfield, Jlihior .two-year starter Colleen .Dundon returns to left while S()phom.ores JUlie Gallo and Rhonda Bogue are battling for ,the starting-rightfield slot. The upcoming women's lacrosse season at Union College should be a very in• teresting one. Head coach Martha Morrison enters her lOth .season with a roster that includes seven letter winners from last year's varsity, nine players who posted a 9-1 record for the jayvee squad, and 14 freshmen. Once more, not one of her three goalies has played in a varsity game. In two years as a starter, jllrlior attackman Jane Barkin llas scored 56 points on 48 goals and eight assists. Junior Deb· Hodin has tallied 32 points in her two seasons as a starter. Defensively, the Lady Dut- chmen will be counting on a solid year frcm three-year starter Elaine Pick. Last year, she scored eight points, ln- .cluding seven goals, and shows 10-13-13 for her career. J\.mior Carolyn Zutell earned a varsity letter last year after spending her freshman season on the jayvee. She is a three-year starter for the field hockey team and last fall was named to the New York State Division III All-State second team. Sophomore Stacey Rosenfield earned a varsity · letter as a rookie m 1986, while Missa Blake will see time on the varsity in her freshman cam- paign. . state event.

Last year was a bittersweet one for the Lady Dutchmen. At the start of the campaign, Morrison honestly felt her team could surpass the school record eight-win season of 1981. She also ~elt that the squad had enough talent to receive its first-ever mvitation to the New York State Tournament. Well, the Lady Dutchmen did get their ~vitation (finishing fifth of eight teams), but fell short of the win record with their 6-7-1 finish. The 1986 season was one where Union either completely dominated its opponents or lost the close ones_ Four of Union's five wins were by seven goals or more while six of the final seven defeats were by five goals or less. In fact, the Lady Dut- chmen lost two overtime games in which they led with under a Katrina Hami'lton, Fiona Shukri, and Anne Rosenau were aU part of the 9-1 jayvee squad last year and will be expected to contribute as starters this season, Meanwhile, freshman Anna Allen will see time on the varsity as a sub. Sophomore Courtney Lynch will provide the leadership and scoring from the midfield. She tallied 35 points, including 26 goals, to finish second on Union's scoring chart as a freshman. Classmate Erin Sheehan netted six goals in her rookie campaign to earn a varsity letter while Sarah Shaw, Danielle Lavigne, and Nicole Angelides are ready to break into the starting lineup after a season on the jayvee. Freshman The situation ih goal is the mcst unsettled on the team. Currently, junior Andree Lebel is battling freshmen Linda Hynes and Jamie Lipsher for the starting berth. The 1987 Lady Dutchmen lacrosse team appears to have the talent to produce a winning season. The e~perience of last year, both good and bad, should benefit the upperclassmen, and the schedule is ·certainly in Union's favor. All ·things con- sidered, this should be a very interesting year for coach Morrison and her team. Susan Bassett Joins Athletic Staff ByS.I.D. Susan Bassett has been named Aquatics Director and assistant men's and women's swim coach at Union, it was annoWlced by Athletic Director Dick Sakala. Bassett, who will oversee all the activities con~ cerning the College's new eight- lane, 35-meter Olympic Pool, was the head swimming and diving coach at William Smith College in Geneva, New York prior to accepting the full-time position at Union. \I'm very pleased that Susan has joined the athletic staff here at Union,\ said Sakala. \She @ will bring a great deal of ex- a ~··' perience not only to the swim o <· >.:- teams, but to the overall lfJ recreational, instructional, and intramural programs that have Susan Bassett to do with the pool.\ Smith finished with a 9-3 record, was ranked fourth in New York State, and was represented by three swimmers in the national meet. \I'm very excited about comi.tlg to Union,\ said Bassett. in the state. Within the academic setting, I feel that we can come up with a very respectable program. I'm certainly looking forward to the challenge.'' In 1986 Bassett led William · which lost its first four games; won a school record 12 in a mw to finish the regular season at 12-4. Unfortunately, they lost both -of their state tournament games to end at 12-6. With only two graduation losses and three overall losses from last year, fourth-year head coach Charlyn Robert is cautiously, but optimistically, looking forward· to another successful year. ''I am going to be doing a bit of experimenting for the good of the overall' program this year,\ she said. \rm looking to get more out of our overall pitching staff, and I'm looking to get the · younger players a lot more playing time. Last year when our starters ran out of gas at the state tournament, our bench wasn't ready to pick up the slack. · I don't want that hap- pening again thistime around.\ Robert has been very suc- cessful since coming to Union in 1983. Her fall field hockey team of 1985 set a school record for wins in a season (10) and finished fifth in the state tournament. '],'he 12-win softball mark of the last two years is also a Union record. In all, she has taken field hockey and softball to postseason each of the last two years. _ Last year then-freshman Kris Tierney pitched in all 18 games while hurling 104 of the team's 120 innings. Though Tierney, who had the 12-6 record with a 2.56 ERA, will again be the Lady Dutchmen's No. 1 hurler, Robert is looking to a staff that includes three others to keep Tierney fresh throughout the season. The big question mark on the team is the vital role of catcher. Junior two-year starter Jean 1\lon&co, tbe team's \best bitter,\ according to Robert, bas· not fully recovered from a ]nee injury suffered in the eighth game of last year. -The ia.jury, which kept her out of the fleld hockey season, where she was a two-year startei . in goal, continues to plague Monaco, even after summer surgery. Overall, coach Robert is pleased with her team's preseason hitting, the pitching depth, and the pot~ntial for a solid all around defense. She is concerned about her pll'l.yers taking teams too 'lightly based on Union's success of the last two seasons. \I'm optimistic about the year, but I'm going into it with a great deal of caution,\ she e11:plains. \Aside from the pdential pr~blem at catcher, I don't want the players looking past their upcoming opponent. They have to realize, and I will make them realize, that you ean 't live on past performances. ihis is a new year and we will go into our first game with a o-o record and a o-o score. Teams are going to come a.fter us because of our past ac- eomplisl1ments and we have to be not only ready for them, but more than ready for them:\' Alumni and Employee Families are Invited to Use the Gym Bassett, a 1979 graduate of Ithaca College where she earned a bachelor of ·science degree in physical education, graduated from Indiana University with a masters of science in physical education in 1980.

CONCORDIENSIS, April 9, 1987 illnncn;r~.ttnsis · -~SPOR Dutchmen Pitching .Sta·ff-- Will :D·e-cide Success- Lose to Oneonta etmen Drop Opener ByS.I.D~ Union College's . baseball team has ·posted three con• secutive winning seasons. During the last two -years, the Dutchmen have won 32 of their 48 games with back~tO..back 16- game win campaigns. Last year the team .captured the Upstate New York title by taking a 7-2 decision from Hartwick in Oneonta. - .Second .. year head coach Gary Reynolds feels that this year's team can top the school record of 16 wins in a season if the pitching staff, which has a ·good deal of potential, can come through. The 10 players that .Reynolds opened · the .season with on April 4 against St. Lawrence combine for a total of 17 varsity letters. \There is no doubt that this could be one of the better Union teams,\ said Reynolds, wllo posted a 16.:.7 mark in his rookie campaign. \The whole key, as is the case with any team, is the pitching. I think we've got the_ potential at every phase (starting, middle relief and closing relief}, it's just a matter of if that potential can get the job done.\ Senior Rich Bartosch will again anchor the staff. In his third year as a starter, Bar- tosch \loQk~ better tha,n ever,\ according to Reynolds. \Rich r~ally worked hard during the offseason and it show,\ said the - Union coach. Last year Bartosch. led the squad with a 5-1 mark (with two saves), but his ERA jumped to 5.02. However, in two seasons,.· the fireballer hasfa.nned 70 in 94 innings· while giving up 78 hits, 41 earned runs, and 64 walks. He was the winning pitcher in the .·ECAC game with seven strong ittnings. Following Bartosch in the rotation is junior Ken Horan and junior Tim Valachovic. Horan, like Bartosch, will be looking to bounce back from a · somewhat off year in 1986. As a· freshinan, lforan was. 2-1 (with one save} with a 1.81 ERA as a relief pitcher. In his first year as a starter; he posted a 3..2 mark; but his E~ jwnped to 4~80. \1 have a great deal of con- fidence in both Kenny and Titn,\ said J;teynolds. \They both..gained a: good deal of ex- Perience last year, and Tim's performance this past fall proved he ca11 handle the ··pressure. However, the success of the team will depend on how well they back up Rich.\ Union's middle relief will consist of Dave Giordano and Scott Perlman. Both pic~ed up their first varsity letters last year .. Perlman, a sophomore, posted a 3-0 record while Giordano recorded .four saves. The closers will be , senior Steve Alves and freshmen Aaron Root and Marty Hurley. Al:ves, a three-year ltterWinner who will also DH and catch, is 6- - 1, lifetime. Union's defense and lineup should he excellent in. 1987. Leading the way for the Dut- chmen -is three-year starter Alex Rita, whO led the team in hitting as a freshman (.426), finished second as a sophomore (.359), and led the Dutchmen last season (.451). Rita, who was the team's lVIost Valuable~ Player in '86, has been struck out only five times in 221 at- bats. Junior Dave Anderson, who hit .365 last year, will start in center while tw~year letter winner Glenn Kata retilrrts to right. . The infield is solid with last year's starter, Dan Klinger back at first. Three-year starter _ Andy Markopoulos will move -~ from third to second, Horan will play short when he . is not pit:- ching, and jWlior Scott Gold- smith will take over at third. Freshman Bill Butcher will share the catching With Alves, who will alSo .be the DH. Klinger, who started at linebacker last fall, hit .351 with ,four home runs in his rookie season while Markopoulos had his best year in '86 with his ;386 average and 20. RBl's~ When he is on. the mound, freshman Pat Secchiaroli will be at short. Sophomore transfer Tony Amarante and Tracy Valacbovic will also see time at third behind Goldsmith, who hit .273 in nine games last year. _ Reynolds _ is very high on Butcher. \Bill has a great deal ofpotential and talent,\ said the second-year coach. \How quickly he adapts to college ball and the _ responsibility . of han- dling colle_ge pitchers will be the key. If for some reason he should need to be broken in slowly, Stevie (Alves) has done a great job for us the last couple of years.\ At one point in the season last year, Union was 9-1 and in the hunt for a possible NCAA tourname11t berth. . However, the pitching staffhad an ERA of 5.00 and with only four opepings for roughly 40 interested schools, the Dutchmen's chances for a spot in the -national tourhament were a long shot at best. With the success of the last two seasons . and the potential for another solid year, the Dutchmen could raise some eyebrows this spring if the pitching staff comes through. By ANDREW MILLER To have a successflil team in any sport you need talent, dedication, aad luck. If you have only some ()f the · · ingredients it will be a long time before you cook up a winning combination. But as the song goes, two out of three ain't bad, right? If you are the Union College men's tennis team the missing third has spelled nothing but trouble. The talent is there, although it may be raw. First year coach Anna Means has been overwhelmed by the en- thusiasm and dedication shown by the players. The missing ingredient is luck. To say Union tennis has had none of it would be an Wlderstatement. The traditional thorn in the side of any college team is replacing gr:aduating seniors~ This was the least of the \87 Dutchmen's problems. They lost only· two seniors to graduation. With the abundance of freshmen and sophomore tryouts, the holes were quickly filled. The team's main woes came from the unlikely source of student transfers. The Dut- chmen lost their number one and three players to, other schools as a result of the fresh- man duo deciding to take their talent elsewhere. This, along with ·the graduation of the seniors, as you can imagine, left many shoes to be filled. Things. couldn't get much r------------~----1 worse, but they did.

Senior By DAVID JONES and MARK BURTON A stiff northern breeze, chilly temperatures, light rain and a rough chop on ~aratoga Lake made less than comfortable conditions for -the . Skidmore Invitational· Regatta held last Saturday. This was no deterrent for a determined Union College team. The sacrifice of having spent spring break in the hills of Tennessee, training paid off as all crews made strong show~gs in the first seasonal race. A total of 59 rowers and coxswains made the trip and all will be _ actively competing this spring. Men's Varsity Eight, Novice, A Eight and Novice B Eight all won their respective races. In addition, the Women's Novice crews and Men's Lightweight Four made strong :;howings. · In the first race of the day, the women's first Novice Eight rowed a more than respectable race, coming iii third out of .a field of five crews. The women's second novice crew lost a head- to-head .matcl:l with Skidmore, but nonetheless were satisfied with their performances. Coach Georgia Sullivan was extremely pleased with the performances and was quick to point out that this is the strongest start ev~r for the women's. novice program. The men's novice crew~ also started. their season on a high note. The Novice A crew finished the 200 meter course in'6:57, a fulH3· seconds ahead of Asswnption. In the most lopsided victory of the day, the Novice B crew beat Skidmore _ by nearly two minutes. In the Lightweight Fours race, Union lost to a traditional lightweight powerhouse - Rochester. It should be noted, however, that dueto an illness, Steve Tulevich was replaced by Coach John Ciovacco. The Men's Varsity Heavyweight Eight rowed their way to victory in the last race of the day. Starting the 2000 meter race next to Skidmore, U. of Rochester and Assumption, the Union Va1:'Sity crew pQlled a good start and quickly found themselves out in front, where they stayed. for the rest of the race. Union crossed the finish line in a time of 6: 42, about 12 seconds in front of second-place Rochester. Varsity Heavyweight Eight coxswain, Joe Murphy, expe1tly piloted his crew through the rough water onto their third straight victory as a varsity crew .. Union College will travel to Ithaca College this coming weekend to continue their winning· streak. Union crews will travel to Worcester, MAthe following weekend to battle Connecticut College . on Lake Quinsigmond. Rob Mohlar picked up rigJtt where he left off last spring, as he won two races. Mohlar won the 400 meters in a personal best time of 49.7 seconds and then came from behind in the mile relay, anchoring it to victory in 3:33.0. Union also looked strong in the 400 hurdles, as Jeff Simkins .and Dan V~ughn went 1-2, clocking tii_nes of 62.5 and 64.5 seconds. Simkins also added a third place in the 110 . hurdles, which he ran in 17.0 seconds. The only other victory for the Dutchemn came in the 5000 meter run, where Bob Stenard and Steve Szydlik tied for first as they cruised to a one- minute victory in 16: 45. However, several other athletes competed strongly in The backbone of this year's squad is number one Singles player Doug Banks. .Senior Captain Banks' steady play and exemplitive dedication make him the player to watch for '87. . Banks' doubles partner, returning sophomore Chad Levin, has joined Banks in assuming a leadership r-ole on the team. Levin had a suc- cessful varsity season last year compiling. a six and four won- loss record. Levin's efforts were a consistent barometer of the team's fortunes as the Dut• chmen also closed '86 with a six and four record. The doubles tandem of Levin and Banks should be a force to reckon with throughout the league. The rest of the starting team -nongwinning causes.

This Saturday, the women travel to Albany State, while the men are home on Sunday for the Union Relays. is made up an assortment ()f Wlderqlassmen with the sole exception of Andre' LesPierre. From the steady play of Jiln O'Brien and Joe Voyticky to the finesse of LesPierte and the power of Dan Elkeslassy, the Dutchmen have a wide variety of styles that compose a solid base of players for the present and the futtlre. On the road in their first match, the fighting Dutchmen travelled to the rainsoaked lands of Oneonta. The perennial power form the west was too much for the inexperienced Union squad to handle. Although dropping a 6-3 loss to , Oneonta, the n~tmen showed all the signs of a team on the rise. As the deluge raged on out- side, the match was played in Oneonta's new bubble dome facility. The constant sound of rain '!>eating down on the tarp- like dome created a feeling of Wleasiness as the \wet behind the ears\ netmen took their- warmups. Union's nwnber one player Doug Banks played a steller- three..set match. Banks' super!J ground strokes and top con- dition propelled him, over- Oneonta adversary Scott Ait- chison, 6-2, in the third set. Banks dominated the first, 6-1, but Aitchison came back strong in the .second set, 3..&, to force a third and final set. Oneonta evened Up the score with a second single victory. Union's Chad Levin played exciting tennis although coming up short in a first set tie- breaker, 6-7. Oneonta's Dave Lencewiez kept up the pressure and took the second set, 6-2. Kemal Boya put Oneonta on top by one with his 6-3, 6-0 defeat of Dutchman Jim O'Brien. Boya overpowered the steady, but inexperienced O'Brien. Down 2-1, Union desperately needed a victory. The call was answered by freshman Dan Elkeslassy. The Morracon-born Elkeslassy came back with vengeance after dropping the first set 2-6, to take the second and third and the match, 6-4, 6 .. 3. Elkeslassy forced his op- ponent off balance with a mix of power and old country soft clay pace. Union's Joe Voyticky and Oneonta's Gary Glassman traded sets, each being cap- tured on a service break. Glassman was too much for Voyticky to handle on this day as the Oneonta opponent rolled to a 6-0 third set victory . Oneonta pushed their lead up to 4-2 with a S..l, 6-4 sixth singles victory. Mike Edelstein dominated the Dutchmen's Andre' LesPierre, 6-1, in the first and held on to capture the second, 6-4 . With Oneonta up 4-2 in .team scoring, Union was forced into the situation where they would have to sweep the doubles in order to pull out a victory. Levin and Banks got things rolling in the right direction with a stunning 6-4, 7..& victory. The match was masterfully played with both sides playing classic attacking doubles. The Union comeback was quickly snuffed out as Oneonta took the remaining two doubles matches to capture a 6-3 team victory. • Although dropping their first match, the '87 edition of the Union College Dutchmen have proved themselves to be ex· citing and competitive. The team deserves the backing and support of the school. The netmen's next home contest· is April 14 at 3:00, versus Skid· more.

GROSSMAN With all the publicity about the SuperFight bout between Sugar Ray Leonard and Mar- velous Marvin Hagler how could I afford not to shell out $30 to see two of boxing's greatest non-heavyweights battle in Las Vegas? That question was stirring in my mind last Mon- day evening as I was sitting around with nothing to do. I had scouted out my options: I called Gepetto's to find out if they would illegally be in- tercepting the broadcast via satellite. After I found out that they wouldn't have the fight, a friend called to tell me that a drinking establishment in Troy that he frequents would be carrying the fight. But, boy that was an awful long way to travel to see this fight. You see, in my heart I kind of pictured these great boxers sitting around and saying: \Gee Sugar, I promise I won't hit your eye too much, and if you don't hit me too hard I'm sure we can put on a goo.d show and pick up a cool $12 million each.\ Not too different from Hulk Hogan and his boys, I hought. ~ - Nevertheless, when my friend 'ame· home from his night class 'e decided that we would take a rip down to Center City where .. hey were getting $25 and $30 to see the fight on closed circuit television. Somehow we knew that we were destined to see the fight. Since there were preliminary bouts we arrived much later than the rest of the crowd and managed to sneak through the back door which was heavily guarded by a security officer that was olr viously more interested in watching boxing than us. We got there just in time for the fight to begin, and quickly assumed our seats amongst the high-priced $30 section. The crowd was not equivalent to the inner circle at the fight at Vegas and my friend commented about the fact that not many soft drinks were being sold. The first couple . of rounds were quite Wlinteresting as the two fighters tested each other out. It was clear that Leonard was in good shape and still had the quickness that enabled him to capture the welterweight and junior middleweight crowns. ~or the entire fight,. Leonard was dqdging Hagler and was able to· come in for a few quick pWlches and then pop back out to the ropes~ The tbird round was better. Hagler showed some of his strength by pounding away at Leonard in a neutral corner, but could not come ·UP with. any solid blows to really stun the challenger. This supported the Pro Wrestling theory, and I realized in fact, that neither fighter landed one damaging knockout blow during the entire fight. However, I knew the fight was heating up when the beer guzzling monsters sitting next to me began to go crazy. To my left, two middleweights who . I learned were brother-in- laws, supported Hagler and knew that he was beginning to show his stllff. (They decided to . leave the wives at home.) To my right, weighing 312 lbs., a heavyweight from Niskayina, had obviollSly put down about $300 on Leonard and he didntt hesitate to let everyone in the immediate vicinity know this. · (He had about nine Budweisers before the sixth round.) Leonard continued his strategy until the eighth round when Hagler started to throw a few punches. Again in the ninth, Hagler scot·ed a few successful •1unches, but Sugar Ray was 1ble to bounce back even though he was corhered. The last few rounds continued in much the same fashi{)n, and Leonard's main advantage was his speed and showboating maneuvers that brought the crowd to its feet. When the 12th round ended, both fighters put their hands up and claimed victory. Thf' decision would be announced. The fight was not great, but everyone that shelled out $30 will tell youthat it was. With the objectivity of rton~paying customers, we determined in our minds that although the fight was entertaining, it was not one of boxing's greatest or evcm near greatest fights. For the first time, you could hear the announcers voices in the Center City Arena: 13--15 Hagler; 18-10 Leonard; 1543 and new . . . At that point everyone rushed for the eXits realizing that Sug~r Ray had been awarded the decision. For the ftlllOUilt of people . that pidted Hagler before the fight, April 9, 1987 Defense Will Be The Key to Lax Success ByS.I.D. Prior to head coach Mike Toop's arrival on the Union College campus. in the winter of 1985, the Dutclunen's lacrosse team had not had a winning season since the 6-5 campaign of 1978. In his .first year (1985) at the hehn, Toop worked to wipe away the defeatest attitude that many orthe upperclassmen had developed and ended the campaign with an 8-6 record. During last year's preseason he set a goal of a ll:l-win campaign. Though he fell just a bit short of the mark, his 8-4 record produced the first back-to-back winning seasons since the campaigns of 1976, '77 and '78. What is a bit remarkable about the team's success under Toop is that the Merchant Marine Academy graduate turned the team around vir· tuaUy by hfrnself. Aside from a little bit of volunteer come· when-I can assistance, Toop has had no formal assistant coach .. . Wltilthisyear. Chuck Prioret a full-time eoach at Union, and Dave Roberts, a dedicated volunteer, both have strong lacrosse backgrounds and haven't missed a practice since preseason began in mid· February. . 1 'Having Chuck and Dave to help me this year is going to make a world of difference/' explained Toop. \In the past rve had to do everything pretty much by ~nyself, now there are three pair of eyes, each wat- ching a certain aspect of the game. The players are getting a great deal more individual it sure seemed as if an inor- dinate amount of Leonard fans attended the Center City broadcast. Almost everyone proclaimed victory. As I walked out, I realized that the Pro Wrestling theory had held tap. When I woke up this morning and saw Leonard and Hagler already setting the stage for a rematch, Only Bob Arum, the promoter, can po~sibly know how many millions this one will be fore. At that point I remembered the words of Herb Broob, the coach of the 1980 U,S, Olympic hockey team who said, \Fool me one~, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on you.\ ' . , .. -~·:. coaching and ·it is already beginning to sllow. •• The backbone to any lacrosse -team U; its goalie, and Toop feels that junior John Thome \is as good ~s they come\. Thorne, a tw<ryear starter, and Most Val11able Player of last year's squad, .has put up some impressive n11!llbers thus far. As a freshman, \Thomey'' posted the 8-6 record, allowed 113 goals, came up with 237 saves, and po:sted a 67.7 save percenta,ge. 'Last year, he allowed just 8f):goals, registered 164 saves, and. had a 65.9 save percentage. Last year's defensive Ullit allowed just ~49 shots on goal, down from 350 the previous year and 47 4 the year befo~e Toop took over. Two of the reasons for the vast improvement are due to the play of senior Mark Leyton anti jUilior captain Greg Leahey; Leyton is a three-year letterwinner while Leahey has won two. Joining them on the starting Ullit will be junior two- year letterwinner Gary Cor- nick. Junior Chuck Weber, sophomore Chris Johnson and freshman Steve Garnett will also see playing time in the backfield. At midfield, Toop has nothing but rave reviews for senior and two.:year captaint . Andy R()ss. As a fresbnian, Ross finished third in scoring with 9-5-14 and helped the Dutchmen, who posted a 3-9 record with 118 goals allowed,. win 50 percent of their faceoffs .. As a sophomore, Ross finished· fifth in scoring with 8-9-17, and was the Dut- chmen's top faceoff man with a 68.2 percent average. Last y.ear he placed fourth in scoring with 9-&-15 and was again the leading faceoffman with a 61).1 average. Supporting Ross in the starting midfield Will be junior Len LaMonica and sophomure David DeBerardinis. The second unit will feature sophomore Blake Henderson, sophomore Mike pccellini and freshman John Keller. Hen- derson was second on the team in face()ffs last year. Shawn Morton, a two-year letterwinner, and freshmen NickBaratoff, and Peter Cotier, both of whom had a successful winter for the Skating Out-· chmen hockey teamt will make up the third midfield. Sophomores Matt Arnold, Chris Ramsay, and freshman Scott Daniels are alS() expected to see playing time. Senior Peter Agricola, a two- year letterwinner, will add a great deal to Union's midfield once he gets over a nagging knee injury. If the Dutchmen do have a question, it concerns their at- tack. Last year the team tallied 109 goals, but John Romeo, a four\'year letterwinner and the team's second leading goal and overall scorer has graduated. However t Toop does ha\J:e junior Phil Horn, senior Tony Darin and senior Will Piersol to put points on the board. Sophmore Andy Albert and freshmen Grosse Pointe, make up the second wave. ~ \I'm confident about our first line of attack/' stated Toop, ·\But it is the one area where we don't have proven depth. If we should suffer an injury to any of our starters, we could be in trouble.\ Once again Union will play a very ambitious schedule. Among the dozen games this year are highly regarded St. Lawrence, Geneseo, - Mid- dlebury, Williams, as wen as local arch rivals Albany, Siena, and RPI. , \OVerall I'm not shooting for a specific. number of wins at this point of the season,\ says Toop. \I know that we are a better all around team than last year, and I expect to Show that with this year's won•loss record.''

Recognizing that exposed . asbestos insulation represented a potential health risk, the College began removing, that material in 1985. However, several students and health professionals believe that Physical Plant has not followed proper procedure in the removal process, and thereby jeopardized the safety of Union stu<lents. PhysicEt,l Plant maintains that their actions .. have, been·' adequate for· the · circumstallces andthat air tests have shown no danger, but the· validity of those tests is also in question. History of the Problem Asbestos fibers are known to be a carcinogen, as documented in several recent studies. A report from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) claims that \the diseases caused by asbestos exposure are life- threatening or disabling. Among these diseases are lung cancer and gastrointestinal cancer,\ to a lesser extent. The report and m()st; studies admit that although any exposure can have irreversible effects, only prolonged exposure (in excess of at least 10 years) results in the development of cancer. Lung cancer is the most ;C()m- mon ailment, and it reslllts from the accumulatio11 of asbestos fibers in the lU!lgs. The source of the asbestos on campus is in insulation around pipes, where it is normally contained by a protective fabric covering. However, over the years since its installatiO\n the fabric has deteriorated to the point where it easily rips and punctures, and in the Rathskellar arid in the West College cafeteria storage area, these pipes were open to the air and exposed to workers (see photos page 3 ). Recent work has temporarily corrected that problem. Union's Aetl~ns Confiioct With Federal Codes ~ • ... > According to Director _ of Physical Plant Jack Hill, l1is office became concerned that alterations in the Old Chapel building during the construction of the new Hale House kitc.hen opened up insulation and ex- posed the Skellar to asl>estos fibers. Physical Plant decided to remove the insulation to eradicate the hazard, using Union maintenance workers. \Our own people did it.'' said Mr. Hill. Wood also states that the problem of being unable to fill all the positions for R.A. from the original pool of applicants is not unusual or coincidental. The .same thing happened last year, and was also a function of fewer applicants due to early ad- yertising, believes Wood. Wood asserts that the Selection Committee is not at all disappointed in the applicants reviewed; \We are very local Construction Responsible For Recent Water Im-purity That operation is where th.e College first diverges · from proper procedure. OSHA has established regulati()ns regarding all aspects of the removal of asbestos from bUildings, in order to prev-ent contamination of the area and subsequent health risks. Mr. Hill stated that because th.e \Skellar inv()lved a minor amount of material,\ the procedure \did not have to follow regulations.\ According to the manual OSHA publishes, however, small-scale jobs \such as . . . removal of asbestos-containing insulati()J1 on pipes ... on beams or abov-= Continued_ on page 2 By R. REED WHIDDEN Last Tuesday and Wed- • nesday, the Union College campus experienced a water condition that produced a brown substance from the faucets. This condition was al:;o evident in neighboring areas. What was in the water, and was it safe, were two of the first C(mcerns of some people. Residents of such dormitories as Richmond claimed that they could not do their lallndry as a result of the brown water. Fliers posted around campus by Residence Life also _ suggested. that laundry not be done. Many wondered neld how it got there. There are two dif- ferent water systems that give us our water, the transmission system that moves the water · from one part of the dty to the other and the distribution system that sends water to individual homes. Magenesium that is naturally in the water is oxidized out at the transmission system and from there the water is passed to the· distribution system. However, at one point last week when it was necessary to relocate a water main (due to construction of a mall in Rotterdam where the pumping station is located). These magnesium deposits were stirred up and got into the distribution systems. This happened once last November as well. Richard Lilley, Superin- tendent of Schenectady Water Department, has begun ·a· project to flush the pipes. This would be done .. by pumping water out fire hydrants and into the streets. Magnesium would then be . washed a way by any rain and eventually make its way back to the river. Lilley also said that magnesium was a number two standard. This means that it is not unsafe by E.P.A. Standards and State Health standa!'ds. The problem is being taken care of. and ac.cording to the city of Schenectady; there is no cause fOr alarm.

The West College Situation In the West College cafeteria storage area, there are a number of pipes covered with asbestos-based insulation. Those pipes had deteriorated largely as a result of age and the contact from stacked boxes (see pictures). Student Manager Peter Ralbovsky' '87 said that .a food service worker brought the . problem to the attention of Joseph DiCarlo, unit manager, in the beginning of January 1987. Mr. DiCarlo reportedly spoke with Food 'Service Director Jan Gray that week. Ralbovsky adds that the worker apparently spoke at the end of that month with Dean of Students Joseph Mrupmola and Ms. Gray again. Approximately a week later, Ralbovsky said, a. maintenance worker came to West and repaired the exposed areas by wrapping them with duct tape, as shown in pictures. However, Ralbovsky said the College had a casual attitude toward the problem: \After the fir~t contact, they didn't mak~ a mov~onitforq~iteawhile.\ The .Air-Testing Question .· Union, in response to what Mr: Hill called \student and employee concern/' conducted testing of the air in West College storage and the Skellar February 6 and 10, after repairs had oeen effected. Union conducted the actual sampling itself, using the equipment from the Enviroment One Cor- pOration, a Schene~tady finn. Environment One also analyted the sample. The results snowed the asbestos fiber concentration in the Skellar to be 0.006-cc and in West to be 0.015--cc, well below the \Permissible A. Here is an example of the ill-kept basemefit area.

Mr. Hill did not know of the exact removal and cleaning method but asserted that air sampling was conducted after the work was completed and that his employees followed proper disposal methods, in- cluding using designated waste sites. Mr. Ken Relyea, the direct supervisor of the project, had no comment and referred all inquiries to Mr. Hill. There are also regulations pertaining to the workers used for the procedure. According to an OSHA industrial hygienist, anyone who will be removing asbestos is to receive training in proper procedure. The workers are now also supposed to wear special \fit-tested\ rubber filter masks .. plthotigh at the . time of the Skellar wurk. paper filter moisks were permitted by law. The ·maintL·nam·p worker had no prenous training; lHme\·er. filter masks were provided. The West Collt,gt· Situation In the West College cafeteria storage area, there arc a number of pipes covered with asbestos-based insulation. Those pipes had deteriorated largely as a result of age and the contact from stacked boxes (see pictures). Student Manager Peter Ralbovsky '87 said that a food service worker brought the problem to the attention of Joseph DiCarlo, lll.it manager, in the beginning of January 1987. Mr. DiCarlo reportedly spoke with Food Service Director Jan Gray that week. Ralbovsky adds that the worker apparently spoke at the end of that month with Dean of Students Joseph Mammola and Ms. Gray again. Approximately a week later, Ralbovsky said, a maintenance worker came to West and repaired the exposed areas by wrapping them with duct tape, as shown in pictures. However, Ralbovsky said the College had a casual attitude toward the problem: \After the first contact, they didn't make a move on it for q!Jite a while.\ The Air-Testing Question Union, in response to what Mr. Hill called \student and employee concern,\ conducted testing of the air in West College storage and the Skellar February 6 and 10, after repairs had been effected. Union conducted the actual sampling itself, using the equipment from the Enviroment One Cor- poration, a Schenet!tady firm. Environment One also analyzed the sample. The results showed the asbestos fiber concentration in the Skellar to be 0.006-cc and in West to be 0.015-cc, well below the \Permissible Exposure Level\ af 0.2 fibers-c<! as establish.ed by N. Y StatE OSHA. (Seechartpg.4). Students and employees question the validity af thE tests. Mast of those questioned . agree that the Skellar is, a year and a half after tlile removal, p r o b a b 1 y a s be s t o s - f r e e . However, the testing in West was conducted in the \Ca11 Storage Room,\ according t() the test results. Ralbovsky said that that room did not have a.s much serious damage as thE \Dry Storage Roorn,\ where foodstuffs and supplies arE kept, and would have a lower reading. Mr. Hill stated that he believed that the \testing was representative,\ and Ms. ; Patricia Lazarro, testing coordinator for Enviroment One, claimed that the test was \simple to perform\ and that Union personnel could easily do their part. Ms. Lazarro said that she was satisfied with th~ technical aspects of the testing, although she was unfamiliar with the locations and could mt judge their selection. HiH. For the procedure, Union plans to hire a professioaal firm ex:peri:enced with asbestos removal and familiar w1th regulations on the work. Legal Aspects The exact legal standing is difficult t0 detennine. Contacts at N.Y. State OSHA, N.Y. State Environmental Conservation and federal OSHA all agree that only an investigation could determine the College's status. Such an investigation can result through any employee com- plaint; or a complaint from any individual will result in an inquiry from OSHA which may lead to investigation. The OSHA industrial hygienist (an in- formal spokesman), who aids in investigation, said that all complaints are kept con- fidential and the investigation team never learns the name of the complainant, in order to have unbiased interviews. All contacts agree that the College should have folilowed federal regulations in the past and must do so in the West operation. The OSHA hygienist said, \They (the College) violated laws, not just recommendations. They should have known that there were regulations . . . there was no excuse for not following them.\ other students were coll- cerned about the accwnulatio11 of asbestos fibers on foodstuffs and utensils. Mr. Hill stated that \fibers if any, float in air. If they land, they will float again with air disburbance. They don't accumulate 011 something and stick to it.\ ThE OSHA hygienist, after hearing a description of the cir- cumstances, said \I wouldrtt want to eat anything from there.\ · Union would fall under federal ·OSHA jurisdiction. Although the New York State OSHA has no jurisdiction over the private sector, Assistant Director Carl The College is planning hJ remove the asbestos from West this summer, according to Mr. Thurneau said all the regulations are \well documented and supposed to be followed.\ Here is an example of the ill-kept basement area. The asbestos lined pipes are in contact with boxes. The basement in West, the dining facilities storage· area, reveals asbestos contamination. The cooking oil that West uses for its cooking is stored below asbestos lined pipes. The soda canisters are stored in the basement directly under ialling asbestos.

By MICK~Y BRADLEY Forget the National Enquirer. Forget tbe Star; the Globe - even Concordiensis. The best weekly p~per in the coi.Ultry bY farjsthe Weekly World News, a .sub~Enq uirer supe-rmarket tabloid that has all the others ·'beat. by miles. You may not . think you've ever seen the News, but I'm sure you have. The front ,page devotes so much ·space and attention to its headlines -which practically scream out 11t you £rom across the market - that you have to look twice to make out the banner and see what the paper is actually named; At first it looks like the Ne\' York Post .(which sometime,s does daily what the News does weekly), but look again. Would· the Post·ever run .a headline'like \YOUR SHOE .SIZE \TELLS HOW LONG YOU'Ll. LIVE\ then in smaller letters beneath: (I calculate your life span with (\asy-to-read chart inside ! ''? (In case yoh were wondering; I'm in the 74\'79 bracket.) .And can the Post claim \America's best and brightest horoscope'?\ The News is in a class .by itself. The main difference between the News and other similar papers is that it is much cheaper, both .Jn cost and in style. None Qf it is in color -the newsprint comes off in your hands almost from the moment you look at it - and it ,rarely . picks ou famous people {except Princess Di, wlro is everywhere), Which is prooably what keeps it out of tile courts and out of the public spotlight. When it does discuss a famous n,ame, it's usually someon~ to whom its readership ca:n relate, and never about anything scandalous, only ridiculous. For instance, this week's cover features Tammy Bakke-r in a totally straight-faced article entitled, \My Hot Tips For a Heavenly Marriage.'~ (As might be ex:pected, the material is taken from an int-erview Tammy did with another source prior to 'her recent Scandal.) Instead of attac}dng the big names, the News goes for the bigger shocks. \8-YEAR-OLD WIFE IS WIDOWED TWICE\ \ATTACK OF THE MAN- EATING· DRAGONS\ and \SNAKE 'GOD'TAKES OVER FACTOR~\' ar·e arnong the first titles I ever cut out and th:ey still retain their luster today. On my door right now (just next to the shoe size-life span chart) is a current rave about a ten year old girl who is possessed by the spirit of the family's dead poodle. It seems she's been biting the rnailman, scratching at fleas, and chasing cats. So far, my personal aU•time favorite cutout is the headline which read \PHYSICAL THERAPIST CHARGED WITH GIVING DEADLY ENEMA\. · I often· wonder wbat the tyPical News reader~ profile is like. You can tell a lot about its ptitrons by looking at: its ad· vertisements - which are often as good or better than the copy jtself. At'leasthalfoftheads are f&r shady . weight-redl!Ction schemes and most all of those feature hideous photos of grossly overweigt_lt men and 'Women (News readers must be fat). Many are selling some sort .of Christian religious symbol or me~al (News readers must be God-fearing). OtheTs ·range froro get-rich-quick schemes, to ·hair · products, to astrologer services (Newsreaders.must be . gtillible ). · .Andmany ofthesethemes are echoed in the articies them- selves. I don't buy the paper every week, so I can't be sure that it is actually editorial policy, hut I . cannot recall a single issue that has gone by without at least orie l)FO story, This week's is. a good one: ' 4 .FAMILY ABDUCTED BY UFO'' reads the headline, featuring above it the quote, '-'We were sucked into the sky by-a beam of light\ and the ·eye- catching topper, \They were strapped to tables and ex.amined like laboratory bags!'' (The-exclamation mark is a staple in every News ar- ticle,) And anti-Russian sen- timent ranks high with the readers, too. In fact, the paper is so right-wing George Will and Bill Buckley would .even laugh at it. Rock music is killing and corrupting our youth,. it says; gays should be imprisoned, not cured, to prevent the spread of AIDS; and TV Evangellists, especially Brother Oral, are Wlduly maligned. Some of this stuff borders on self-parody. Of course, I've no doubt that the editors are fully aware of the inunense joke they are perpetrating here - I'm sure a large portion of the News' patrons are bad taste fans like myself. Just look at Ed Anger's weekly column, \My America'', in which this raving right- · wi11ger takes conservativism well past the point at thich it could ever · be serious. Sometimes it's clever satire (as in this week's column about OrC~l Roberts), but sometimes he just runs ~ild. The first article by him that I ever clipped discussed how overrated art is, asserting that Walt' Disney was a better ''drawer\ than DaVinci or · Mi.chealangelo. His art ob- servations went like this: '\Mona Lisa could use a black velvet background and mayqe those big eyes that stick out,\ \those impressionist guys like Monet and Renoir were real duds... their pictures are all fuzzy like they were done by drunks,\ and best of all, \What abont that statue Venus de Milo'? Isn't it about time they put her arms back on and covered up her naked top so women and children can see ller, too?\ Ed Anger, it turns out, is really Rafe Klinger, an Associate Editor who laughs at his stl.lff along with the rest of 11s. r hope ·the same is true for De;,lr' Dotti, the absurd advice C()lurnnist, and for Whomever does the terrific \Pet Talk\ column (readers love pets.~ in fact, according to a recent article, they love· them more. tban spo~es and children). Sirlce the paper ·is printed in Flori4a, I have .this imag~ of the The $~~Q~(IJ!X1 is Coining Help Sigma Phi support the American Cancer Society \·.\ . '. . \ \\ \ . ' . ' . staff lying around the beach with umbrellas and stmglasses, sipping Pina · Coladas and dreaming up the next ridiculous issue. '\\ .· ' .. The paper does have its shortcomings, .of course. Many of its most outlandish stories come from obscure places across the world, their ac- companying photos are usually noticeably sensationalized (I have a picture of a smoking hen with a cigarette artifically placed in its mouth), and the headlines are so good that the articles themselves are often a letdown. But, hey, that just makes them easier to clip and display and since two good titles are rarely back-toback on the same page, I half suspect that the editors are aware of the utility they serve on my door. I . ' ... And yet, friends think I'm crazy when I come. home with the latest issae. For 55 cents, I'll admit, I am easily amused- and amazed. Last swnmer I was checking out of a supermarket when the woman in front of me grabbed a copy of the News out of the stand. Faced at last with a serious reader of \America's most exciting paper\ (their claim), !tried to learn as much about her as I could from looking at her. The headline that attracted her escapes me, but I remember she was overweight, middle-aged, and synthetically dressed. Her only other purchase was· a package of frozen dietary fish sticks. It occurs to me that the Weekly World News is. America. Essay The Ess.ay (We Treasl!re Your Words) Check It Out . ... Humanities 210 / ........ \/ •• .. I ' \ I \. \ ~ By ALEX STEPHENS The classrooms and hallways of academia seem empty. The many paths criss-crossing the campus anq its budding greens of spring and the IFC meeting hall in Phi Delta Theta house is regulated by a temporary figure. This hollow feeling is due to a vacant office in Student Mfairs behind a locked wooden door with clouded glass. Inside, the oak desk harbors an empty chair and its surface is void of family photographs, bureaucratic papers pertaining to college and a brass nameplate engraved with the letters \Robert J. Massa.'' Who will fill Massa's shoes as Assistant Dean of Students? The position was held by Massa for four years and he no doubt helped mold the perameters of the job. Part of his respon- siblilities were to oversee IFC meetings, dealings with members of the Greek organization and decisions concerning student conduct. So, the search is on for a replacement and what do you do when need a job filled? You put an ad in the newspaper. Advertisements about the job appeared in local and national new~papers . 'and journals attracting 100 applicants. Each applicati'On will be sifted through by Dean of Students Joseph Mammola and then narrowed down to four can- didates. One can only imagine the type of newspaper and ad- vertisement the message ap- · peared. Every now and again a \Metroland\ blows around campus and upon scanning the ads and personals in the back one might happen upon a small innocuous ad stating: \Small liberal arts college seeks Asst. Dean of Stud. Must have previous experience and un- derstanding of Greek sustem and own construction helmet. If interested please call Joe at Union College-(518) 370-6000 days, 370-5555 nights.\ Or, perhaps the administration sought to canvass a more sophisticated group of per- spectives and on those serene moments of flipping through the monochrome pages of \The New Yorker\ your eye catches a flowery colored ad about a tropical condo establishment. Beneath it is a box with a light sketch of peculiar building with an array of ecclectic ar- chitecture and Hebrew letters adorned upon the dome. The subtle lettering states: \The Great Sphinx, 2500 B.C. Stone- henge, 1900-1700 'B.C. the Pantheon 118-125 A.D. Union college, Schenectady 1795. Be a part of history.\ Actually the ad appeared in bulletins like the \Hudson-Mohawk Association of Colleges & Universities\ under a section labelled \Open Positions.\ It read: ''Assistant Dean of Students, Union, 3/16/87.\ Dean Mammola's office said that no candidate has officially been asked to visit the campus as of Tuesday so therefore the preliminary selection process is still on going. Although there was emphasis placed early on for the replacement of the Assistant Dean position before the end of this school year in June, which seems unlikely.

Career Observation Days have traditionally given students ,a chance to ex~lore certain career choices first• _l}~uid, while also preserving the irilportant link between Union col1egiates and alumni. Pat Matteo of the Career Development Centet organized the program and set up tran- sportation for all those par- ticipating. Some of the par- ticipants gave these im- pressions of their visits. Wayne Kotary Biology Major, 1989 Wayne visited Michael Pletman, a fifth grade reading teacher at Rosendale School in Niskayuna. He spent a regular school day in Mr. Pletman 's classroom, both observing the various reading classes and interacting with students. Since Wayne is in- terested in teaching on the secondary school level after graduating from ·Union, he found the day to be quite · in- formative. Mr. Pletman ap- peared very satisfied with his job and was willing to answer any qaestions regarding education-related courses of- fered at Union and obtaining teaching certification after graduation. Melissa Mayer Computer .Science-Psychology Major, 1988 Melissa visited Daniel McManamon, a senior account executive at H. Linn Cushing Advertising Agency. She described \a typically hectic day\ that she spent there, observing the stages by which an idea is transferred into an advertisement. She ac- companied Mr. McManamon on his daily errands, visited a client and examined a finished Next fall, THE WRITING CENTER will need Tutors who are-- PATIENT IMAGINATIVE RELIABLE SENSIBLE FLEXIBLE TACTFUL SUPPORTIVE LITERATE FRIENDLY & NICE Are YOU something like that?

She felt that everyone in the office was not only friendly but willing to offer career ad- vice. This, in particular, was important to Melissa since she is looking at advertising as a future career. Chris Rua Mathematics Major, 1988 \During the 'Career Observation Days' last week, I visited two Union College alumni: Daniel T. McManamon, Cla_ss of 1976 and Timothy B. Thornton, Class of 1957. Mr. McManamon is the Sr. Account Executive at H. Linn Cushing Advertising firm, and Mrs. Thornt-on .is an attorney at Mcnamee, Lochner, Titus, and Williams, P.C. Although both of the days I spent \shadowing\ these two alumni were dif- ferent, both were worthwhile experiences. By visiting clients, meeting associates, talking about day-to-day activities, and observing the interactions that took place between colleagues, I was able to get a better sense of both fields. For example, Mr. McManamon showed me the various aspects of marketing and coiillllunications as we toured his workplace, visited clients, and delivered materials to vendors and clients. In a similar manner, Mr. Thornton described. his experiences as a lawyer specializing in trus~s, estates, tax, and real estate. By seeing the type of office work he does daily, touring the courts, visiting clients, and informally discussing · present and past cases with whiCh he had dealt, I was able to \first-hand\ in- formation that I could not have read in a book. Their descrip- tions of the· decisions and struggles that they had to deal with along along their career paths were realistic and in- formative. I found their advice and insight very helpful as I continue to explore my career options.\ By SHEVAH and ARABAH When in Israel do as the Romans did. Well, not exactly.

Even if the bed was not the most comfortable, bugs were flying around our heads, and we were freezing, we still fell asleep quickly, only to wake up to another day which resembled the previous one so · much that we lost track of just what day it actually was in our six-day work week. At the end of our kibbutz stay we were all ready for a week of toW'ing. We toured the southern part of Israel.

' Class Review: Psych 49 Psychology of Addiction :By CATHY ,BEI)N.ARIK Since Union College is a small liberal arts college with an intimate facU:lty-student at- mosphere, a majority of students feel they are exposed to an the various pr~grams which the college has to offer. Usually, this .is true: However; there is one particular college asset which goes, for the most part, unnoticed by the fllll-ti.Ine undergraduate day stadents. This asset is the programs offered by the Office of Graduate and Continuing Studfes. The Office of G.-adua:te and Continuing Studies offers a wide range of courses not only to graduate students and part- time evening students .but· also to full•tiine day students who can ju~tify their reasoning for enrol}ment in an evening eourse. Usually the ratio of day · students to evening students is low. However, this 'past winter · · · temi a .psychology. course was e'ffered.: iri which day and evening student enrollment approached an equilibrium. Psychology 49, the of ·Alcoholics Anonytn(lus. and can .lJe generalized to say that a person is addicted to a sub- stance beca·use he has a,n allergic reaction to the sub- stance Which ,causes physical and psychological dependence. However, the idea was presented and backed by nUitlerous studies tllat an ad- diction is any potent ex:perience that is used as a coping mechanism and eventually becomes the Diain focus of a person''s life. This . definition thus allows us to better un- derstand eating and love ad- dictions and makes us aware that even though, over time, tl'le human body will build a physiological tolerao.ce for. a drug, even to the .point that the drug is needed to maintain the physiological balance, it is not the dr-ug but the eJ:Cperience the drUg evokes to which a person is Mdicted . . . In taking an. eve11ing course .like . .Psychology 49~ the day student · i$ gaining many more things than jl1St knowledge of a specific subject. He ,is gaining familiarity with the programs offered by the Graduate and Continuing Studies Office, creating faculty ties with professors who teac.h evening courses and discussing im- porU:mt issues with older students who hold very different view-points. For the student who expresses concern that Union is too homogenous, perhaps one of the best ways to diversity his education is to enroll in an evening course.

Psychology of Addiction, taught by Professor Tom Dowling had ai.Inost, equal day and evening student enrol1ment. The course was h~ld on Tuesday evenings from 6:30 to 9:20. Tln:ee· hours may seem imposing, but tn fact, the subject matter was so in- teresting that the lectures passed quickly. The first six weeks of the course were devoted to lectures and movies concerning alcohol addiction, heroin addiction, love addiction, . eating ·disordets,' therapy for ''addicts and<their ramiliEis'.and a·· ... , 'varietY of · case studies to tHustrate the points whiCh Professor Dowling raised. After the lecture, half of the course was finished each student was asked to write a paper and present a lecture on a topic concerning some aspect of addiction. The topics presented varied greatly and often reflected a students' personal interest or life experience. The student lectures were not only informative but also provoked discussion on present day issues dealing with alcohol and drugs (ie. the 21-year-old drinking age and drug use in schools). These diseussions allowed. the yoWlger day students and the older night students (10 years· and greater ·age differences) to better un- derstaild, but not always agree .with one another.

Page 8 ,CONCORDIENSIS, April 16, 1987 ·- FEA'TURES .. .Eating Disorders Mayor Karen Johnson of Schenectady speaking at Union. 'Women in Politics'' By STAFF As part of the itinerary . for Women's Week 1987 at Union, Schenectady Mayor Karen Johnson spoke to the college community on Thursday, April 9. The topic of the lecture, \Women in Politics,\ was suggested by the Women's Week Committee for an important reason, since the questions Mayor Johnson ad- dressed were to be used as data for a nationwide research project. This project, sponsored by Rutgers University in New Jersey, was designed to study the impact of women in elective office. The mayor discussed how the presence of women in office affects public policy decisions. She questioned whether elected women officials have the ability or opportunity to reshape in- stitutions, from a local to a national level. Women in city hall as well as Congress fell into this range of discussion. Lastly, Johnson theorized about how the leadership style and par- ticipation of women in the political process is unique. After the lecture, the audience was invited to attend a reception for Mayor Johnson. This lecture was set up so as to help bridge the gap between Union College and the Schenectady community, while informing students about the challenges of holding public office. Karen Johnson was President of the Schenectady City Council from 1980-1983 before her election as Mayor of Schenectady in 1984. · By MARJORIE HOFFER Every moment, someone, somewhere, is complaining about their weight. Responding to the emphasis that our soCiety places on thinness, many people, especially women, develop eating disorders. Although the disorders are usually psychological, they are connected with the predominate false belief that \thinness equals happiness.\ Last Wednesday, as a part of Women's Week, Linda Frye and Tim Dowling of the Counseling Center presented a film and . discussion on the subject of eating disorders. the film en- titled \Bulimia\ dealt with the binge and purge cycle which affects a large percentage of college students. According to the film, about two million people are victims of bulimia. Bulimics, like many non-bulimics, see food as a way to deal with stress, anxiety, and depression. Most people develop bulimia after going off a diet.. Ninety percent of all dieters gain the weight back. The easy answer for someone who wants to lose the weight, but not deal with the denial of a diet, is to eat what she wants, and then vomit or take a laxative. Dieters, bulimics, and anorexics are obsessed with eating and deny them- selves certain foods that have a GARNET NEEDS PICTURES! CANDIDS, SPR-ING BREAK, CLUBS, ETC. . . PLEASE TURN PICTURES INTO MRS.

The denial is what causes the bu.limic to binge on these fattening foods. Fear of weight gain causes the personto purge. Aside frorn the medical dangers, (bUlimics often develop sore throats, headaches, and dizziness from the loss of potassium, as well as terrible teeth problems from the acid in the stomach, and those who use lax:itives can suffer from dehydration- the repel'cussions of these ailments can be very serious)., the psychological' struggle of 'being· caught in this · cycle is devasting. These people feel out of control, have a low self- esteem, and become even more depressed than they were wben they began the cycle. The narrator in the film of- fered suggestions to help· stop bulimia, One was to change the way a .person perceives food. Instead of denying fattening foods, these foods should be consumed, but in moderation; This way, the bulimic does not feel as though she is denying herself, and will not need to binge. Another preventive measure was to write down feelings, amount of food eaten, and time, in a journal. After a week, th~ person should analyze the journal to see if certain moods induce eating behaviors. Perhaps the best suggestion was to exercise. Not only does exercise burn calories, but it is soothing and an antidote to relieve depression and anxiety. Of course, the best way to deal with any psychological problem is to seek professional help. These days there are:- many professionals specifically trained in the· area of eating · disorders. After the fjlm, Frye and Dowling led the discussion. Although few student members of the audience shared their feelings, insights and ob- servations, some interesting points were brought out. Onein particular was the role of the media. Dowling and Frye agreed now that the media has other issues to attend to, such as drugs and AIDS,-problems like anor~]da ~nd J;nilimia _ are receiving less attention. Sometimes, the less attention tile better, .for many people feel tllat the media actually en- courages women to become bulimic when they see it used as a coping mechanism. Frye stated. that usually, an eating disorder is a way one copes with other feeling that th~ .bulimic or anorexic does not even know ab()Ut. This aspect of an eating. disorder was not ·brought out in the film, and shows the importance of ,professional help when dealing with someone who has a disorder. What do you do if your .roollllllate, or someone you • know has .an ec;lting di,sotder? J)owling advises that yQu confront the person once with the fact that you are aware of her problem and are interested in helping. However, he stressed that you approach her ()nly once; more attention would only encourage. the bulimic/anorexic to continue. Frye. and Dowling stated that bOth the Counseling Center and Health Services can offer their services for a student with an eating disorder. They added that they can put students in contact with specific people and organizations that deal with eating disorders. Though Dowling and Frye agree that peer support groups have been UIISuccessful at Union, a student, Linda Haynes, is in- terested in starting one. If in- terested, please contact her at X:4158; Because rnaga~ines, books,. and television shows have dealt with ·eating disorders, most students are aware of their e,Ustence. However, few people realize the true problem that a person with an eating .disorder has is not with weight, but some other deep-rooted problem. A.gain, the medical dangers can net be ignored, as they are very serious. An eating disorder is n<1t a fad diet. If someone has one, she should not feel em- b<trrassed about seeking help. A.ll calls to the Counseling Center are completely con- fidential; their number is X:6161. Flood · Relief Campaign The Red Cross has launched a special Flood Relief Campaign to raise money to aid ·the' 992 families affected by last weekend's flood. Over $175,000 in direct assistance will -be dispersed over a eight{8) county area. This appeal is necessary to off-set the costs of providing immediate support as hundreds attempt to put their lives back together. The Red Cross must depend on the generous support of the community to assist with its planned emergency aid. the recent t1ooding has caused hardships in the c()unties of illster, Schenectady, Mon- tgomery, Delaware, Ren- .sselaer, Greene, Saratoga, and Schoharie. Donations can be sent to Re5f Cross Flood Relief, c Norstar Bank, PO Box 1674, Albany, NY, 12201. The Red Cross has opened disaster assistance centers for residents of the affected counties.

Last week I parked my car in the Fox-Davidson parking lot directly behind Fiji. In the morning I found one tire slashed and the rear spoiler torn off. I learned from the Safety and Security Depart- ment that three other cars also had their tires slashed the same night in the same lot. There are definitely not isolated incidents. From the time I enrolled here at Union I've encountered more van- dalism aRd theft than ever before in my whole life. Late one night during fall term I witnessed someone in a beat up heap of an automobile taking a baseball bat to a Mercedes Benz right outside my window. What is this, a college or a combat zone .. When I reported both the destruction of the Mercedes and the slashing of my car to Safety and Security I got the same type of reacti0n; we understand what's going on, but we can't do much about it.

Just, will be held in the Music Room at Schaffer Library.- By KATHY STEINBACH Yours, Anne recounts the story of Anne Frank by setting her written words to musk: · This expressive medium has created a superb dramatization of the tragic confinement of Anne and her family as they hid from the Nazis 'during World War II. The Frank family and their friends were restricted to small living quarters for 25 months in Amsterdam, Holland. This small place sets the stage for a play that covers the two year period in which one sees Anne blossom into womanhood and become best friends with her diary, known as Kitty. As well as Anne, both families must learn to accept their hideaway and often complain of their situation as they fight for space. The aggravation of living in this space for months on end is often forgotten y.rhen they receive news of dying Jews who were unable to hide. While music carries the play from scene to scene, it has a high-point during the last night of Hannukkah. The families dare to light the candles that could giye away their location and sing together in the hope that soon they will have the miracle of freedom. · Freedom seems to be near, as the Allied Invasion has oc- curred, yet the Frank family and friends are discovered and taken separately to con- centration camps. Their struggle to survive ends for all but Mr. Frank who gives the bitter final monologue. The original production opened off:·Broadw.ay at Playhouse 91 in the fall of 1965. The 1967 production of Yours, Anne, at The Egg, is directed by Robert W. Tolan, who is the Producing Director of Heritage Artists Ltd. Musical direction is by ·Uel Wade. The set was designed by James Morgan, costumed by Mary Marsicano, and lighting by David Lockner. The part of Anne is played by Joan Scheckel. Anne'.s parents, otto and Edith, are played by William Brockmeier and Karen Gibson and Margot, Anne's sister is played by Gina Kaufmann. Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan, ·the other couple are played by Frank.

Throughout the film, as with DINER; Levinson depends on dialogue for·the basis.of his work. Hence; what better people to talk than salesmen, and talk they do. TlN MEN is filled with the funny, human conversations that have become Levinson's trademark. He allows his characters to talk themselves in circles, much like real people talk. This is especailly seen in the scenes where the salesmen come up with some very funny schemes to hawk their wares. The salesmen have the gift of bag; every time they open their mouths it is to sell. No more is this evident than in the scene where Tilley's wife discovers she was the prize of a fight and tries to move out of BB's apartment. BB tries to talk her into staying, but the whole time he is apologising he is selling a product, himself. When Dreyfuss and DeVito argue over car damage, or are squaring off to fight in the parking lot, they aren't so much fighting each other than they are trying to outsell each other. Thus, the htunor in the TIN MEN comes from humanness of its characters and what they say to each other, rather than just what they say as a line. TIN MEN is an achievement of reflection for Levinson, he seems to just reach back and give the viewer 1963, in both the way it was, and the way it's remembered. He not only wants us to see the life of the allim- nium siding salesmen for their inherent humor, but also for their place in an old way of American life. At the end of the fUm, when the Tin Men are being ruined by the Home Improvement Commission, Levinson gives the viewer the sad feeling that withthe decline of the door-to-door salesmen, there was a corresponding decline of a special part of America. The message is · subtle, but it is there, not lost in the humor of the film. TIN MEN is a complete fihn, involving humor, sadness and most of all: people. Special kudos go to Touchstone Studios for . producing some of the best movies in the last few years. The offshoot of Disney has been responsible for THE COLOR OF MONEY, DOWN AND OUT IN · BEVERLY HILLS, and RUTHLESS PEOPLE. Further, they have been using actors an acresses such as Bette Midler, Richard Dreyfuss, Danny DeVito, and Nick Nolte in way that no other major studi would.

{ . . Page 14 CONCORDIENSJS, April 16, 1987 When my friends and I graduated from high school, we all took part-time jobs to pay for college. · They ended up in car washes and hamburger joints, putting in long hours for little pay. Not me. My job takes just one weekend a month and two weeks a year. Yet, I'm earning $18,000 for college. Because I joined my local Army National Guard. They're the people who help our state during emergencies like ·hurri- canes and floods. They're also an important part of our country's military defense. . So, since I'm helping them do such. an important job, they're helping me make it through schooL ,., As soon as I finished Advanced · Training, the Guard gave me a cash bonus of $2,000. Then, under the New GI Bill, I'm getting another $5,o·oo for ~tuition and books. Not tp mention my monthly Army Guard paychecks. They'll add up to · more than $11,000 over the six years I'm in the Guard. · · And if I take out a college loan, the Guard will help me pay it back- up to $1,500 a year, plus interest. It all adds up to $18,000-or more -for college-for just a little of my time. And that's a heck of a better deal than any car wash will give you. - THEGUARDCAN,HELPPUT YOU THROUGH,_COLtEGE, .TOO._ ..

\ ' CONCORDJENSIS, April 16, 1987 Page 15 SCIENCE, HEALTH,· AND TECHNOLOGY Alzheiiner's Linked to Down's Syndrome Uni,on Students Attend Rochester Symposium By ALAN DeSALVIO Barth Bracy gave the first talk from Union, titled \High Pressure Particle Detection Chambers,\ a presentation based on research presently ongoing in the basement of the S&E building, involving a large steel vessel (the Bomb} under , dangerously high pressure (up By JOHN BERGERON Many of us, in our lifetimes will know someone who has either Alzheimer's disease or Down's syndrome. It has recently been confirmed that Alzheimer's, the most common form of senile dementia is related to Down's syndr.ome, a very comtnon form of mental retardation,. in the sense that victims of both disorders have abnormalities i.n the 21st chromosome. lt becomes in .. creasingly important to diagnose the cause of . Alzheimer'.s as Americans live longer and thus more of the pO.pulation becomes .susceptible to the disease. Researchers first became aware of a pOssible connection between the two disorders when they noticed that Down's syndrome victims who live into adulthood display symptoms of Alzheimer;s (successive stages of short-tenn memory loss)· in their later years. Scientists already knew that pown's patients have an, extra copy .of the 21st chromosome and through new recombinant-DNA processes using gene markers, they were able to conclude that the guHty gene in an Alzheimer's victim is on the 2ist chromosome. These markers are strings of DNA. which have a known position on the chromosome. In experiments using genetic markers, the researchers are interested in whether people with, -· 4 •• - .\-~ Alzheimer's always inherit the same type of marker. If this is true, then it is likely tnat the disease causing gene is located right next to the marker and thus they are inherited together. James Gusella and associates at Massachusetts General Hospital performed these experiments with ten dH'ferent markers on fmu families with a history of Alzheimer'.s · and two of the markers which have a likelihood of being inherited together were situat.ed near the suspected gene. for Alzheimer's. The disease's .effects on the brain involve deposits of irregular proteins in two forms. The first are fibrous nerve tanbles which build up inside cells, The second are patches of decaying nerve endings en· veloping a thick core. Both the tangles and . the patches, or ,plaques, are found in adults With Down's syndrome. Within the core of each plawue is a protein named A4. Researchers found a gene that uses the entire A4 sequence~ A4 was found to be imbedded in a larger protein which normally causes no damage to cells. Protei,ns in the brain have ,receptors which are molecules that help process information sent to the brain. It is believed that in an Alzheime·r's victim these receptors are not broken down correctly and they leave behind deposits of A4. Researchers have yet to discover how the problem gene causes the production o.f these fibrous tangles and plaques. Although this discovery implies that Alzheimer;s is inheritable it also means that researchers could eventually treat it as well as Down's syndrome. Facts On Eating Disorders . . t.

Three of the thirty talks given during the one day session were given by Union students, who were ac- companied on the five hour trip setouring around the fallen thruway bridge by Dr. Laszlo Ba~ay and his wife, Marika, Dr. Richard Magahiz. Dr. . Seyffie Maleki (the Union . Society of Physics .Students chapter advisor), Alan DeSalvio (1987-88 New York . State SPS associate councillor), Sing-yun Lee, Stuart Pratt, Jorg Schalbach, and Anthony Vrondissis,. noe of whom gave talks but instead provided in- valuable moral support for the hardy few who did face the unforgiving, audiences. The twenty-minute presen- tations had to be divided into three parallel sessions, demonstrating the great in- terest in research amongst undergraduates, who represented thirteen separate institutions, from SUNY Buffalo to West Point to RPI. In all, some fifty interested in- dividu~ls showed up to hear the talks, whose subjects ranged from Condensed Matter to Astrophysics. FAST, FREE DELIVERY WELCOME TO to 500 atmospheres). This is done to concentrate matter in the detector volume., and work at this pressure has never been attempted before. Dr. Laszlo Baksay is the .supervising faculty on this project. Peter Ralbovsky · giive the second Union talk, titled ''Diode Lasers in Atomic Physics\ which dealt with the frequency tuning capability and highly monochromatic nature of the cheap and easily available diode laser. Peter, a graduating senior, did this work in con- junction with Seyffie Maleki. The third and final Union talk was given by Louis Schick, the 1986-87 New York State SPS associate councillor, entitled \Making Stardust\ and it dealt with the computer modelling he and Dave Greenlaw are doing of molecular coagulation in the circUili-stellar envelope, with which they are trying to un- derstand the froces behind interstellar dpst formatiion. Dr. David Peak is the driving force behind this research. From the physics standpoint, the trip was a rousing success, but. at many times along the seemingly unending journey, we all wished it had been sponsored by a closer college, even (gasp) RPI.

Lose ,to Colo·nials By ANDREW MILLER With high expectations and · good spir-its the '87 edition of the Union College men's tennis team travelled to Hamilton to take on the fighting Colonials. Ten hours later the Dutchmen returned; having suffered their second defeat of the young season coining in the form of a 7-2 · downing by a strong Hamilton squad. As the old saying goes, it's not over 'til the fat lady sings. But this match seemed to have been decided before she even ate her first two-pound box · of chocolates. Hamilton came out smoking taking all but one of the single matches and thus relegating the doubles matches to mere for- mality. It was Colonial Paul Markson, Hamilton's first singles player, who set the tone for the day. Markson held off Dutchman Doug Banks, 6-4, in the first and came back strong to take a 6-2 second set victory. Banks and Markson battled each other and the wind, as the two .ignored the lli1favorable weather conditions and played exciting, attacking tennis.

Let round ended in a three way tie between Norman, Larry Mize, and Steve Ballesteros of Spain. This reslllted in a sudden-death playoff, only the third in Masters history. On the first hole, Ballesteros folded with Mize and Norman tying again. What happened on the next hole was one of the most -dramatic and memorable finishes in golf history. Both golfers teed off and sliced their shots to the right of the green. Norman's shot landed just on the skirt of the green while Mize's shot landed about 140 feet from the hole to the right. Mize proceeded to take his next shot which he chipped onto the green, and watched it roll directly to the hole as if it was being pulled by a magnet. Norman missed his 50 foot putt and Mize took home the victory, which incidently was a swn of $162,000.0nedoesnot have to be a pro-golfer to appreciate the excitement . of this years Masters, and for that matter, all the major tournaments. In the past it was not uncommon for me to keep turning the channel when I saw golf on TV. Yet after this weekend, one can really understand how thrilling the game of golf really is. If you · don'tlike golf or have just never taken the time to investigate it, you really should. It's a great game and it can be played at any age. Coach Scanlon, head coach of the golf team, recommends that players start at a yoWJg age. It is easier to learn when you are still young. So if you have a feeling you might like golf, don't hesitate for a minute; it's a great game. ~· ... ·on the road to Henley Varsity Oarsmen Defeat Rival Ithaca ByMARKBURTON · and DAV·ID JONES -Last weekend· the· crew team· · travelled to· Lake Cayuga to race in the Ithaca Invitational Regatta. Other colleges par- ticipating were Colgate, Hobart, Rochester; and Ithaca College. Two Union crews came away with victories after a full day of racing. Both the Men's Varsity Heavyweight Eight and the Novice Men's B crews won their respective . races. Emotions were high in the men'·s varsity boat· as they prEpared themselves to take on traditional nemesis Ithaca. Calm water and a chilly drizzle were the conditions as Union, Ithaca, and Colgate came to the starting line. It quickly became a two boat race as Colgate fell bad~ at the start, leaving Union anti Ithaca to battle it out. Union, rowing at a'lower rating than Ithaca, pulled ahead slightly at the 5.00 meter mark and was able to increase this to a lioat-length at .1000 meters. This proved to be enough as throughout the rest of the race Ithaca was unableto come back ag~inst the. more physical Union boat. They did mal!-age to take back a few seats at the start- of the sprint. However, Union held fast and responded by increasing their lead and finished the race in a time of 6:07, a full· 5 seconds ahead of Ithaca. A happy Coach Ciovacco had this to say af- terwards: \The future looks good. We beat them by the same margin as Georgetown did lal!!t w.eek. I would say that this already puts us into the top ten at The Dad Vails (National Championships) .. \ In the closest race of the day, Union's Novice Men's B boat defeated Hobart in a photo finish race. The two boats were even for most of the race with Union gaining a slight ad- vantage with only 250 meters to go in the 2000 meter race. Some equipment problems in the final strokes caused the Union boat to slow down ami provided an opening for Hobart to come back. The two crews appeared to finish in a dead heat but the race judge ruled that Union had won by a margin of 0.12 seconds. This was the second consecutive victory for this spirited group ..

Tra~k 'Team Splits with Hamilton )3y.MEN'S TRACK TEAM Both the men's and women's track · teams were busy last week, as each had two meets .. Last Wednesday, the team traveled to Hamilton College, where the· women came away, 87·45, winnners. Sophomore Lorie Anderson led the Lady Dutchmen, as she won three events and was second in a. fourth. Anderson took the long jwnp (3.98 meters), the triple jUinp (8.89 meters), and the 100, meter hurdles (19.3 seconds), and finished a close second in the 400 meter hurdles (74.6 seconds). Newcomer Beth Jewett showed that she will be a bit contributer to the team as she was a double winner, whming the shot put (8.19 meters) and the :discus (28.53 meters). Veteran Julie Halpern won two events also, taking the 400 hurdles in 69,3 seconds and the 100 meter dash in 13.8 seconds. Halpern also added a second place in the shot put, throwing it 7.32 meters, Fresh- man JenRegan chipped in a win in fhe high jwnp, a second in the 100 hurdles, and a third in the 400 hurdles. Union's other individual wins came in the distance events as Eileen Brady won the 1500 in 12:10. While the women defeated Hamilton, the men dropped a 1()0.64 decision to the Con- tinentals. 'I'he meet was closer than the .score indicates, because the Dutclunen lost several close races. Freshm.an Chip Silver led the team, as he recorded a first in the triple jump (39ft., 11 in.), a second in the higll jump (1.83 meters) and a third in the 110 hurdles (17,6 secDnds). In the 110 hur• dies race, freshman Jeff Simkins had the same time as the Y'tinner (17'.1 seconds), but w~U~ «rwartled second place in a race many thought he had won. Simkins added a third place in the 400 'hurdles (61.3 seconds) latet· in the day.

As the 18th hole came around, five golfers were still in contention for the victory. Greg Norman, who ended up taking second place for the second year in a row, could have sealed the victory on the final hole with a putt but he missed it by an inch or so. As it turned out, the Veter:an trackster Bob Stenard is one of Union's more expenenced runners . . Stonionis · added points in the field events, with Hamilton taking second in the shot put (10.00 meters} and third in the discus (33.14 meters), and Stonionis taking second in the javelin (47.53 meters) and third in the shot put (10.72 meters). On Saturday, the women's team traveled to Albany to compete in the Albany Women's Invitational. Running against several .out-of-state and Division I schools, the Lady Dutchmen fared surprisingly well. Jen Dilorio led the women with a second place throw .of 110 feet in the javelin. Julie Halpern added a fourth place in the 400 hurdles (69.1 seconds), then led the mile relay to a quick time of 4:23, as she led off with a 62.9 second leg.

Alex's 12 for 17 start this season boosts his lifetime average to .429 and his runs batted ill to 58. Rita's batting prowess has not been achieved solely on power. He has a selective style that has earned him some impressive stats. Alex did not strike out once in what is Alex Rita traditionally a shaky freshman season, and since then he has only gone down on strikes a total of 5 times. Alex's above average athletic ability has earned him quite a bit of recognition over his · career.

Page 20 CONCORDIENSISt April 16~ 1987 April 16, 1987 Union Rugg.ers Sto.rm Dixi,e! By CHRIS SRERIDAN and ROB SHARP Late in the 19th century, a war broke out between the northern and southern halves of the current United States. In this Civil War, many lives were lost, and as in all wars, one side showed domination while the other showed defeat. Many historians say that history repeats itself-the north conquered the south in the late 1800's, and last weekend the north repeated their victory. There are only three things that could cause the can- cellation of a Thursday rugby practice-Captains Rob Sharp and Steve Konlian haven't woken up yet, happy hour at Geppettos, or a competely insane road trip to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. The trip started out in typical rugby fashion when one of the doors to one of the 15 person vans fell off while the team was still at Union. Seeing this as an omen £rom the rugby gods, the team realized that this would be a trip to remember. The two vans and one station wagon left Union with over 35 ruggers aboard. It was seen that 15 ruggers in a van for an extended period of time can have a better time than 2000 students at Union on a typical Saturday night. The boys showed their gentlemanly side by greeting many female passersby with the traditional rugby \Hello.\ Arriving at the University of Maryland at 1:00am., after eight hours of sightseeing and unspoken reverlry, all were excited to participate in the night life of one of the biggest party schools in the cQuntry. After checking in to their luxury hotel, the boys drove to the strip, where the 40,000 Maryland students release tension. Because most of the bars were already closed, the . streets were loaded with people, and the ruggers quickly made many friends. The following day, the ruggers made their way into the U, of Maryland football stadium to fraternize with the hundreds of voluptous students soaking up the sun on the stadiwns benches. After seeing some of these beauties, Konlian, who's speech was already impaired beyond understanding (it was concluded that he was speaking a slavic language not heard since 1620) and his eyes the size of small honeydews, seemed to momentarily lose con- sciousness. It seemed after talking with a few of the Maryland students, that their course load was almost as demanding as the Union ruggers' own. One semi-:passed out junior who, according to Sharp, had the liver the size of a Volvo, and the brain the con- sistency of gummy bears, claimed that he had a \History of Maryland Athletics\ exam at 4pm. The team arrived at Duke University around 11 pm. The beautiful university was highlighted by the friendly natives. Although Union tried to make a party out of the com- paritively non-existent social life, the rugby players realized that they came 15 hourstPprove something to the south-and prove they did. Arriving in Greensboro the following day, Union found themselves lined up to play three games in the next six hours. Union's first was against highly favored Fayetteville Rugby Club from Fayetteville, NC. Nicknamed \Fatalville the club looked to intimidate Union, however it seemed to be Union's day for the in- timidation. Union scored first, and last in their opening game. Thanks to trys by Steve Delano and Perry Levy, Union shut out the natives 8-0. · \I just put my head down and ran it in.\ After an hour breather, Union faced the University of North Carolia-Greensboro. This famous and highly regarded Southern power~house was clearly not expecting the in• tensity or the power of Union's A-side. Again, Union was the first to score, Konlian, who was later named the tournament Most Valuable Player, got a feed from junior Josh Derechin from about 10 meters out. \I just put my head down and ran it in,\ Konlian said. Steve Delano scored again, on a beautiful 40 meter run to give the ruggers ten points. UNC-G managed to put six on the board themselves right at the end of the game, but couldn't muster any more, and fell to the wrath of the Union \Huns.\ The play of the game, and in many aspects the play that kept Union in the tournament was one only attributed to intensity and knowledge of the game, . by Derechin. Late in the UNC-G game a· UNC rugger escaped through Union's defense and ran into the try zone for a score. However, according to the rules of the game a try isn't a try until the player places the ball on the ground in the try-zone. After running into the try. zone, the player ran towards the middle of the field to gain better field position for the con· version.Chasing him into the zone was Derechin and Chris Sheridan. Before he could place the ball on the ground for the four points; Derechin came up behind him and knocked the ball out of his hands, into the air and Dereehin was knocked ' . - . out of bounds by Sheridan. This totally heacls up play by Derechin was one of the maj(lr reasons Union made it to the finals of the tournament. Un- fortunately, Union did lose senior wjng Steve Delano-a major loss to Union's line; Delano, Union's fastest runner was taken out of the game after also receiving a broken nose and a possible concussion after illegally. being taken down by a UNC-G lineman who tackled the tough runner around the head. Union definately missed Delano's quickness in the en- suing games. Perkins felt that the Union ruggers lost· intensity in the second half of the game against UNG-G. ''We lostmomentwn in the second half and In a way this was good because it showed us that in a- tight game like that we can lose the momentum and still win the game.\ . After upsetting UNC-G, Union's third oppenent of the tournament, Mrytle Beach Rugby Club, from Myrtle Beach, SC, decided it was more prudent to forfeit to Union than to play, as they were clearly not prepared for the inevitable loss. With their 3-0 record, Union was scheduled to face Cherry Point Rugby Club from Cherry Point, NC-a Marine-base situated team. On their way to the semi- final matchup the following day, one of the rugby vans broke down on the freeway, some 35 miles from the our- nament. Union arrived at the field about an hour late only to be notified that they had five minutes to get ready· for the game. The marines had already been warming up for about a half hour and when the Union ruggers arrived, the marines were in the midst of doing drills that most of the Union players could not com· prebend. However, Marines-a team not used to being beaten. The win was due, in great part from the work of Union's scrwn who literally walked right over the Marines. With Several Union Ruggers converge on an opposing player as he· attempts~to score on the D~chmen. Tournament M.V.P. Steve Konlian pushes through the arms of opposing. Ruggers. players such as Steve Lipsky, Dave Blee, Tom Christian- son,Sharp, Jodi Perkin, Dave Morrion, Sheridan, and Adam Helfand in front of him, eight man Jeff Albrecht didn't have much trouble scoring twice in the game (a thfrd one was their called.back).. Perkins sealed the win with a try of lU$· own--\I molested the sctum .. half;'' he said. \Then I just ran . it in.'' Union defeated the Marine's 14- 7 to advance to the finals. Another major. reason for the work of the freshman fullback Rob Dodge. Do()ge, who saw his first A..,side start in tl\e Fayetteville game, played at a level often not seen in even those who have had several years' experience. Dodge made several unbelievabie · plays throughout the whole tour• nament, showing his skill as a kicker and overall as a player. He was a major reason for Union's success over the weekend. Union's wing, Jeff Zorn also had a great game against the Marines as well as throughout the tournament Every game, Zorn hacl several great runs, to the cheers from the southern fans .. Union . • • now found themselves being cheered not only by Southern fans but . . . beaten teams • .. • \Go New York! Show em Rugby how it should be played.\ The final game called for Union to face the host team-a highly talented Rugby club called Triad, from Greensboro, NC. Although the final score • was 24-12, in Triad's favor, this doesn't show just what ;kind of a game it was. Early in the first half, HookerDave Blee had to leave the game after going head to head with one of Triad's largest playerws. Blee broke his nose and will be out of Union's lineup for quite some time. Replacing him was freshman Steve Bordonaro, who with only about a week's hooder . experience did a commendable job for the northern team. Later in the game prop Tom Christiansen had to leave the game after a severe shoulder injury, only to be followed by.second~row Dave Morrison, who suffered a concussion. Helfan came in to the . game as a substitute -for ChrJstiansen, and brought into the game with him a new meaning to the word intensity. Unfortunately, rugby only allows two injury substitUti'Ons all game, and when Morrison left the game, Union was forced to play a man dom.t. Althe>ugh Union's serum still dominated the much larger Triad serum, 'Morrison's .presence was'needed arta.' Union felt the effects of playing less oneplayet. · Dillion's f.irst score of the championship game came off of a beautiful, long run by Konlian, who took a hit and made a beautiful pass to Perkins who ran it in for his second try of the day. Albrecht had a try taken away, and while many (}f the players made his way down field with the ball, and by the time some of Union's defeDse knew what was hap- pening, Triad put another six on the board. This 12 point dif- ference was a major factor in the game, and yet, the northern rugg-ers still did not five up. Uaion, who were gawked at by many of the southerners when they first arrived at the toumament because they were from New York (it was thought that the northerners wouldn't last past the first day) now found themselves being cheered on Mt only by the southern fans, but also by some of the teams that Union beat on the way to the final game. -Cheers such as \Go New York!,\ and' \C'mon Unio11!! Show' em rugby how it should be played,'' echoed throughout the stands. fueled by this, Tom Muzzinigro drove in another Union try after a pass from Bordonaro. Un- fortunately, time ran out on Uniom's comeback and the tournament ended with Union one game short of the cham- pionship. ''l thought we did really well,\ Perkins felt of the way Union played. ·\We would ha·ve give11 Triad a much better .game without all of the injuries we bad. We were definately hurt by all of out guys going down.\ Throughout the tournament, Union hd a different attitude than many .of the Southern teams. Perkins said, \A lot of the southern teams were r·eally cocky. We weren't cocky at all- not like the other 11 teams in the tournament.\ Corttrinued on page 18

Photo of the Week: Oiled 'skin and frisbees hit We~t Boeach as Union ·experiences its first week-long heat wave. The recent rise in profits is attributed to General Electric's acquisition of the RCA Cor- poration under which the NBC television network is · a sub- Sidary. Gen~ral Electric bought RCA for $6.4 billion last June; by doing su, General Electric also acquir~d the highly suc- cessful 11ational network television station, NBC (National Broadcasting Company). The increase is also said to be a result of higher sa:Ies in the company's aircraft engine production, which is based in Fairfield, Conn. According t~ the GE chairman, John. F. Weleh Jr. \W'e are continuing to pursue economic opportunities available from ratiOnalizing _RCA and GE operations, and we· have identified. a number of strategic improvement projects in other businesses.\ The core manufacturing operations for General Ele~tric is based in Schenectady.

Also on the bright side, a representative for Mr. Bunk off has estimated the project to be 93 percent e()rnplete which agrees with Union's release that the center is more than 90 percent complete.

Mr. Rieschick's acceptance of the position of director of . alwnni affairs marks a full circle for him in terms of af- filiation with Union. After • graduating from Union in 197 4 with a degree in history, he worked for one year as manager of one oftbe New York Mets' minor:.league teams. From 1976 to 1983 Mr. Rieschick returned to Union as director of the annual fund. In 1983 he left to study 'in the seminary. A few years later, he was drawn back to college work and accepted the position of director of the college fund at Lafayette. Rieschick's return to Union as director of alumni· affairs, marks the final arc in the circle. In general, Mr. Rieschick says that his duty as director is to ''serve alumni and develop their interest and in- volvement.''

CONCORDIENSIS, April 23, 1987 Page 3 Former Position Director Reassumes Alumni Affairs • Ill By EZRA SHERMAN The position of Director of Alumni Affairs that was left vacant when former Director Harrison G. Demgen accepted a new job as Union's director of . major gift programs is now filled. Paul Rieschick officiaUy took over an Aprill of this year. Mr. Riescl.lick's acceptance of the position of director of alumni affairs marks a fuH circle for him in terms of af- filiation with Union. After graduating from Union in 1974 with a degree in history, he worked for one year as manager of one of the New York Mets' minor-league teams. From 1976 to 1983 Mr. Rieschick returned to Union as directer of tile annual fund. In 1983 he left to study in the seminary. A few years later, he was drawn back to college work and accepted tile position of director of the college fund at Lafayette. Rieschick's return to Union as director of alumni affairs, marks the final arc in the circle. ln general, Mr. Rieschick says that his duty as director is to \serve alumni and develop their interest and in- volvement.\ Helping him to accomplish certain aspects of that end are associate director • of alumni affairs Kerry Mendez and assistant director Eileen O'Ce:rmelt Mrs. Mendez has the full-time job of planning and OrganiziNg Homecoming and ReUnion Weekend. Mrs. O'Connell is in charge of coordinating th€ alumni club get-tegethers thr()ughout the COWl try. Alumni clubs consist of graduates who talt€ an active interest in Union and w!Jo meet to discuss changes and potential areas of growth at Union. Mr. Rieschick sees these dubs as an importa·Ht resource of the college. First, they supply feedback on Unim's develop- ment, and secondly, they off~r the students practical advice about the job-market and participate in the job hosting program offered by the Career 'Development Office. Rieschick claims that student participation in alwrmi affairs is growing. When he graduated in 1974, student phonathons were just getting started. ·Student involvement has grown to the point where students are often the ones who are sent as representatives of tlle college to Homecoming '87 Parade Meeting TODAY 4:30 p.mo in SS012 All interested in organizing the parade, c-ome to this 1neeting W:i£ntzuttt' s I <lllenn~rs & mai1ors 1fitit 1714 UNION Sl AEET (518) 374-6647 Specializing m su~de & Le.ather Cleaning Shirts & Blouses Laundered Zippers Replaced- Jeans Shortened Charge Accounts Welcome YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAUJf talk to al1:1Illl1i. One of the new director's goals is to expand this trend of student involvement. As he says, \the more involved the students are new, the greater the chance of having active alumni in the future, after they get out.\ .c: .1:::: E (f) rl If first 1mpression.s are worth anything, I got the feeling that Mr. Rieschick's statement, ''people should have a lot of pride in Union,\ is a sincere one.

Demgen Room Lottery System Underlined Process to Be Conducted from May 13 to May 26 The room lottery will be conducted from May 13 to May 26. The .computer will random ely assign numbers to students by class year. That is to say, the computer randomly assigns numbers to members of the classes of 88, 89, 90. The com- puter then translates the ran- dom number to a number that is understandable- 1 through 500 - roughly the size of each class. This will be done for each class with the exception of the in- coming new students. Members of the Residence Life Staff will distribute to eligible students a lottery card bearing the student's name, ID number, and lottery nwnber. The student MUST present his- her ID and pick up his-her lottery card IN PERSON. Only students presenting IDs will receive a lottery card. If it is impossible for a student to pick up his-her lottery card that night, he-she may do so at the Office of Residence Life the next day. A $10 late fee will apply - no exceptions. The selection of available Co-op intt>~est meeting Distribution of lottery numbers Co-op Lottery Singles Lottery Senior Lottery Doubles & Suites Junior Lottery Doubles & Suites Sophomore Lottery Doubles & Suites campus housing is divided into three categories: co-op-singles- doubles, triples and suites. There will be a meeting to explain the selection process for co-ops on May 7th. A member of the Office of Residence Life will answer all questions about the co-op lottery at this meeting. The remainder of the campus housing will be selected ac- cording to class year and by the lottery nwnber assigned to each student. Singles Lottery: The senior with the lowest lottery number (N().l) will have first choice of available singles. The senior with the next lowest lottery number (No.2) will have the second choice. If some singles have not been selected and there are no more seniors present, the junior present with the lowest nwnber will have first choice of the remaining singles.

Page 4 CONCOR_DIENSIS, April 23, 1987 FEATURES Philosophy Forum on . ~ . \\· Talk ·Of The Town Concordy recently asked: \What is favorite s.pring time activity at Union'?\ your Legal Moralisin and AIDS Photographs and InterViews by AlKiapper 'BY CHIDSEY DICKSON \Camp Union and West Beach!\ Jodi Burgess, '87. \Laying out in the .sun listening to tunes.\ Rhonda Bogue, '87. . \.Springsteen golf or any sport tha.t can be played with beer in hand.\ Jim Poirier, '90. Found: $100.00 Afikomen Last Wednesday Dr. Christine Pierce, Assoc. Prof. of Philosophy at N.C. State, gave a paper criticb;ing legal moralism, that is, the in- stitution of a body of laws forbidding certain practices that are not ethic~lly palatable. Phrased this way, it sounds like Pierce questions tlle underlying precepts of the Constitution. Indeed, it was the year-old Supreme Court ruling, vis-a-vis that the constitlltion did not ''confer the right\ of sodomy, which brought certain questions to bear concerning the sound- ness of the S.C.'s interpretation of what is and what is not im- plicitly granted by our Forefathers (who, we are supposed to believe, knew nothing about tllis abominable act). It is true that there is no mention of Sodomy in the document ene way or the oth~r. This doesn't surprise us since neither do they tell us which way t9 brush ()Ur teeth (up, down or side to side?) or how to throw a dinner party. Yet, this decision supported the 23 states who still consider Sodomy morally objectionable and punishable by law. The High Court came by their decision not by being compelled to see the outrageous harm (if there is any.) the. practice has on the general public (like, say, smoking), not by being shown that the AIDS :.virus is com- municable only through anal intercourse (which it is not), but because Irnmanual Kant together with a !()rig line of other philosophers, clergy and doe- tors have said tlut the act was \unnatural\. It's my opinion,_ and 1 think the opinion of Dr. Pierce, that on this one the Court was very high, which, no one will argue, is not a right conferred by tile constitution. By DOUG rtE~CE This past Sunday, April 19th, teams of one to three people register~d at the Flagpole for the Jewish Student Union's first annual Afikomen Treasure Hunt. I know, '\'What's an' AfikomenJ'' An Afikomen is the second half of the first piece of matza us~d in a Passover sedar, or service, and must be eaten to end the service. Traditionally, if there are children at the seder, the parents hide the A,fikomen and let the children find it. The child who finds it can then make a deal with (i.e. bribe) his or her parents to end the seder. The origins of the Afikomen Treasure Hunt are different. It is the creation of Mr.'s Jon Fink and Rob Goldman, who both hid the Afikomen and provided the contestants with a sheet of riddles hinting at its secret location. The questions were very challenging, yet within a half an hour, two contestants - Jeffrey Rosen and Geoffrey Schenkel, found the hundred dollar Afikomen and brought it back to the Flagpole to claim their prize. Here is a copy of the question sheet, if you can answer these quickly, perhaps you are ready to enter in next year's Hunt - and win a $100.00. Each answer contains the name of something on campus. After you have found all the answers, copy down the un- derlined letters. You must unscramble these letters to find another clue. This clue will lead you to a place on campus where the Afikomen was hidden. CLUES: 1) Person connected with the Lemon Slave Case. (HINT: An historic figure. ) 2) He plays with squares on TV. 3) The one beer to have when you're having more than one. 4) Comedians talk about Danny Rose here. 5) This person wants to be touched right now. 6) This finicky eat's favorite rock group is the Eurythmics. 7) Compute the length of the graph of: 2 3/2 2(x + 113) from X=l to X=2 Add one to your answer. (HINT: The entire hunt centers around this answer.) Most of Pierce's talk dealt just with the unsound argument ARTISTIC1 CllEAfiVE1 Help us design Camp Union T-Shirts.

Anyone who has arrived in the latter half of the 20th century knows well that sex is not just for making babies an~ ore. At l~?.st, the majority of young . people feel that recreation, ex.pression of love, \ventilation\ are ot·ber 'Natural' reasons for coupling. So, the situation seems destined to amend itself as .progressive ideas establish themselves as the ne\Y· precedents, etc. · So, what's the problem? According to Pierce, there ls a severe prejudice against homosexuals in this country, an abrupt distaste for their lifestyles, a conspicuous lack of sympathy for those who are sick--the targets of God's Wrath, it is believed by some, etc. And an this despite recent cultural autonomy and general \e.mancipation\. -This. homophobia-and the myths and misconceptions that attend and $Upport it-ruay present more of a detriment than annoyance to the overwhelming (?) heterosexual population of the u.s., the reason being that it clouds the country's per- spective of just how serious an epidemic the AIDS virus can be. As long as it remains the \gay plague\ no one worries about it because of their supposed immunity (disdain} towards \those people.'' People they are-and more than likely-they are more like those condemning them than anyone would gather from the statistics which associate the virus with homosexual men. and 1. v. users except in rare· cases ( 10 per- cent) It is the general feeling today that some homosexual activity constitutes a gay lifestyle wllich was reinforced, at one time, by the epidemic as the virus acted as something of a brand or ear tag. However, this can hardly account for the fact that today, AIDS is spreading into the heterosexual population at an ~larming rate. Nothing has changed except our readiness to a$Sociate the deadly virus with a 'criminal' minority in· light of recent scientjfic discoveries, re: the transmission of the disease. Ignorance of the true situation can only impede the process -of finding a cure since \Safe sex\ will not be taken seriously unless we . all feel ourselves vulnerable. As of now, few states are even willing to hear proposals concerning the education of young people since an ac~owledgement of the problem might he construed . as their approval of promiscuity in general, or spedficaHy, homose:luality. Few tegislators will be eager to inform· the public on how to be safe while undertaking illegal activities because of\' the 'obvious hypocritiCal implications. It would be analogo11s to Nancy saying, ''Just say NO-and if you just can't, then try not to drive, · and if you do, dt:ive . within the speed limit... \ As long as legislation sup- ports (however indirectly) the absurd \self-pruning\ or \Wrath\ model of the disease, there is little hope the epidemic will be checked. As long as homosexuals· are vexed, the constitution will not \read\ so as to confer a· right to Sodomy and the public will continue to think the disease contained.

For his culinary initiation into the world of greasy spoons, Mickey chose a ·little spot in Mohawk Mall. Yes, we escorted our Date to the Woolworth Restaurant. The menu consisted of many mouthwatering specialties. Unfortunately; they were out of more than half of the dishes (those teasers). After much haggling withthe waitress over items in stock, we eventually settled for two turkey dinr1ers (with either green or wax beans) and a grilled cheese sandwich. Incidentally, our special guest had one of the turkey dmaers and a cake. The three of us sensed a story here. We wantedt get a real feel for the kitchen activity (after being outsed from. our first table because the section was closed) so we situated ourselves at a table right near it. MM MM- you could just smell those savory aromas wafting out from the oven right to our table. We saw the synthetically clad kitchen hands remove the turkey dinners from the freezer and put them into the microwave. They cleverly placed the deli-sliced turkey around a hunk of stuffing resembling a real bird, just like mom used to do. We also saw one of the waitresses take out two pieces of Freihofer's white bread and an individually- wrapped slice of cheese food and slap it on the griddle.

The 9lst By ALEX~TEPHENS . So~e .people say that Patriot's Day was created because there weren't en<>ugh three-day weekends in Massachusetts. Neverthele..ss, it suits the wants and desires cf many a 13aY State resident. especially tJ:lose who like to get out in a spring day and watch the top•ranked marathoners compete in the Boston Marathon. What's particularly unique about Patriof s _Day and watching the Marathon is, as one spectator put it, \it's the only place you can watch a wo~ld championship for free.\ And that is ;part of its charm. All along the 26,2 mile trail, beginning · in Hopkinton and ending at Boylston Street near Copley Square, thousands Qf onlookers linethe streets to see. Some have the ease of stepping out their front doors and have their shoes drenched with ex-· cess water (this also can be a problen1 since Marath()n Monday is the only day one can legally litter). It is genuine tradition that permeates from the crowds. For most it's as traditional as· turkey on Thanksgiving, Wacle B()ggs . batting over 300 and . tbe presence of Rick and Dick Hoyt, the .father who pusJtes his C~P. stricken son in a specially designed wheelchair for the duration. , But there are also those distinguished young college types who are more than happy to partake in the festivities. For them it is another reason to celebrate life. Students from many colleges, including B.U., B.C. and Babson College in Wellesley, join the spectators and not just to put ·a certain amount of time to make their designated parties legitimate and return to the kegs and dope, but to cheer their compatri()ts who have taken on the arduou.s task of running . the Marathon. Although some are compelle!l to return to \basecamp\ to satiate their thirsts, many stay and watch the · endless river of runn~rs in iridescent apparel and flourescent running shoes (usually ranging in price somewhere close to the national debt for the complete outfit, excluding the official number). The students say to themselves, \I'll leave right after this guy with the monkey mask comes ,by\. But then their eye catches a bearded fellow wearing a bison head with a T·shirt saying \Cowman-Moo\ and the v :remain, setting another 1U¢t.

Finally, · Update on Student Grounds Committee After a recent meeting with Dean Marnmola, the Student Grounds Committee is ready for' action. This committee is comprised of students who will provide a liaison between the student body and .Physical Plant, (Security and Main- tenance).. The team liaison implies two-way com- munication. That is its hope is to promote student awareness of campus problems as well as to inform Physical Plant of students' concerns about the ,campus. The committee will serve as an organized body which will be able to follow up on some of the suggestions students make about the maintenance of the \grounds\. Committee members will meet regularly with the maintenance staff to give them the students' per· spective of the campus. voi~in~ attitudes toward such topics as snow removal, tree removal, puddles, maintenance requests for dormatories etc; 1 The Student GroUilds Com- mittee would also hope to instill pride in Union's bea11tiful and historical campus. In doing so, students will be less likely to commit the unfortunate acts of vandalism which occasionally • occur. Finally, the committee will dispense information about the various situations on campus, ranging from the status of the flag, to the availability and safety of campus parking. Applications for the com· mittee are currently being accepted for the 87~ school year. Anyone interested in the aforementioned activities: of the Student Grounds committee is urged to apply.

At night, the possibilities are endless: go to Georgetwon dancing, the bars on the Hill, the Kennedy Center, 9r party at one of the many college campuses. Living in a hotel is also ad- vantageous. It is only two blocks away from work. Secondly, Maid service is provided daily. The maid will not only make your bed, do your dishes, and clean the bathroom, but . she will also leave a chocolate on your pillow. Another luxury is that every morning the newspaper is delivered to your door. The term in Washington is more than working for a Congressman in one of the three Congressional office buildings, going to Congressional hearings, meeting prominent national figures and crashing receptions · (which cannot -Jle explained but has to be ex- perienced). It is the opportunity to see what happens behind the closed doors of Congress. It is not necessary to be a political science major to get the most out of this term, the term is a benefiCial for anyone who is interested in the working of the government. Do not be worried that you do not know enough about Congress and national affairs. You are there to learn, and the other members · of the staff are more than willing to answer any questions . you might have. You will learn more ,in one term of hands on experience than you would sitting in a classroom in Schenectady.

CONCORDIE~SlS, April 23, 1987 FEATURES Chopper Focus Playground at Union Day Care Center Volunteering By MARJORIE HOFFER Four hours a week JilL 'romack takes care of her little sister, (of Big Brothers Big Sisters), and twice a week she volllDteers at the Schenectady B()y's Club. Since Freshman year, Jill has been a big sister to Deana, and has been working at the Boys Club for two terms, (in eonjunction , with her psychology class). She finds her work satisfying, as she says, ' 4 Even though I only have Deana for four hours a week, i1's four hours that she is away from her negative environment. I feel that I have helped her in a l<Jt of wa.vs, and that to me, is very rewarding. Having a little brother or little sister, is sometimes frustrating, but it is a!)solutely worthwhile.\ Many opportunities exist for students interested in gaining some work experience. Volunteer work does not only help the people you work for, it also helps yourself. One student who volunteered at the Schenectady Girl's Club says, ' 'I am a psychology major ,and after I started working at the Girl's Club, I knew one thing for sure, clinical psychology is not for me.\ This hands on ex- perience helps students define their career choice. Another student, a ·jtmior, who volun- teers at WMHT, (Schenectady Public Television) said, \This 'internship' I have was worth every second. I do not get paid, btlt the experience was money in the bank. I picked up on a lot of aspects that go. on in a television station. Even on a career day, no one can absorb that much. I highly recommend that no matter what your career interest, get an internship. It's probal:)ly the best way to find out what you really want to do. No course can answer tba,t.'' As part of her psychology class, ·Gayle Diamond volun- teered two hours a week at Union's Day Care Center. Now, she has a regular volunteer schedule with an institution in Schenectady. She says \Vol- unteering is something that I was always active in. While at Union, aside from the general satisfaction I receive from helping other people, volunteering .gets me into the community. I also enjoy working with Circle K, the on campus community · service club. For anyone who is in- terested in community service, Circle K is a great place to start.\ ' May Cheung, a Junior, has been volunteering at Schenectady Planned Paren- thood since sophmore year. She began working there in search of some volunteer work, and said she saw a \tiny sign (asking for volunteers) on my floor that probably no one else saw.\ Once a week, May councels patients before they see the doctor. She feels that she has learned a lot, and has become more sensitive about many issues. May also stated that though She sees many people from Union,. that everything that goes on at Planned Parenthood is kept completely confidential. Most people are there for a routine check-up, as May added, \it's really a doctors' office, people. should not feel embarrassed about coming.\ Ellen Rossner began volun- teering at the Elmer A venue School as a student in Human Relations I. Although the course ended last term, Ellen still works once a week with children who require special attention. Their problems vary from being sexually abused, to children of drunk parents, and other difficult home· en- vironments. Ellen realizes the limitations of her work at the school, but nonetheless states, \It would be . egotistical to believe that I could change their world. But just one little thing makes such a difference in their lives. Before I left for vacation, I gave them a party and bought a cake that said 'keep up the good work' and one little girl asked me why I was Spending my money on her.'' Ellen has become so attached to her students that she feels that it will be difficult to leave them at the end of the year, ''I wanted to call them over break to tell them that I would be coming back\ she said. No matter the major, many volunteer situations . exist around the Schenectady area. Another option to volunteering is to have an internship as course credit. This type of situation is a bit more difficult to set up, however, it can also be extremely rewarding. At Union, the most popular internships of this sort are in conjunction with the Political Science Depart- ment. But, with a willing . Professor, the possibilities for any iildependant study are endless. An economics major· could intern at a bank, and a student interested in medicine could work at one of the three liospitals in the area. Sometimes, it is a bit difficult to look beyond the campus gates. An internship or volunteer work will not only help the institution you work for but it will make you more aw~re of what you want to do .in the oh so near future ... By MICKEY BRADLEY I hav~ a recurring nigl:ltmare · where I'm being chased down a long, dark corridor by a short, balding man wearing a neat . pin-striped suit. I keep- running . and he keeps getting closer, about to overtak~ me at any . moment. The map.: Nell Golub, president of Ptice ~hopper. . Price Chopper is taking over · my life. It may sound silly, Qut it's true. And it's not jU$t, .the fact tbat they have every kind o.f food or non-food item I eeuld ever want - though they· <:er- tainly do -. er the social · phenomenon of bulk food, which .is an essay in itself. They pyovide me· with things no supermarket was ever meant to carry. . · . .. They started out innocently enough with bank machines. All one has to do to access his cash is slip in a plastic card, press a few · numbers, and xncmey magically appears. I can't remember the last time I went to a bank to do banking; those machines are so convenient I don't plan to set a foot in one again until I need a major l(}an or mortgage and by then, Price Chopper will be offering those ·too. Think I'm exaggerating? There's a new Price Chopper in the drawing stages now whose plans include an insurance center: you will actually be able to purchase life and car in- surance in between squeezing fruit and weighing vegetables. In fact, th,is new store promises to be bigger and better in every way: an on-premises one hour photo lab, a fresh flower shop, La Gourmet (a catering ser- . vice), a full pharmacy, lotto ... the list goes on and on. Of course, this is in addition to all the services they already provide. I go .to .the corporation now not only for my grocery needs and my banking needs, but also for my entertainment needs, since they started ren- ting videos. And if you don't have a VCR, no problem! -they rent those, too. And .they offer . current best•sellers at prices no bookstore can touch. Pretty soon, an evening at Price Chopper will be a complete night on the town. Actually, Price Chopper is encouraging this. Last year 1 they started so~ething called \Singles Night\ at the store, which is designed to help lonely men and women meet each other. After all, if you discover you use the same floor wax or toilet paper as someone else, The English Department is conducting a Reappointment Review for Adrian Frazier, Assistant Professor of English, and welcomes comments concerning Professor Frazier's teaching, Dinner Adventures At. Union service, and scholarship from- all interested faculty and students. Please send statements to Jim McCord, English Department by April 27th. Dine and learn with the faculty. That is the invitation that awaits those who would like to have an informal evening away fro:tn home that provides the opportunity to learn more about life in a foreign country through a new program of the Office .of Graduate and Con- tinuing Studies at Union College. \Dinner Adventures\ will take place on three Wednesday evenings, beginning April 29, when participants will gather at Hale House on campus to sample the cUisine of Iran and hear an informal talk (probably with slide or videotape) about the culture of Iran, as un- derstood through the ex- periences of Mohammed Mafi, '------------------------~-assistant professor of civil engineering at Union. . The second adventure takes place on May. ~ with Le~trice · Mendelsohn, ass1stant professor ~f art, . as the evening's gmde to Italy. An art historian who travels and studies there frequently, Mendelsohn will share highlights of Italian culture with guests enjoying a dinner specially prepared for the event.

Butzel· fn the late sixteenth and early . ;eventeenth centuries the C::<lormon world view at the base M many thories was that the earth was the center of the aniverse; the geocentric theory. Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, de::~cribed a system in which the earth was at the ·center and the sur1, moon, planets, and stars revolved around it. ptolemy, a Greek astronomer in the second 'c:erntury, believed the sun and (Jlanets moved around the earth 1!\'llile it stood still.

He obse[\vtd and recorded the changes in the appearance· of Venus .as seen from the earth. At first,. h.e described it as a round an-d small planet. After a few da:ys, it began to lose its roundness,. became horn- shaped, .and eventually di'minishEd until it vanished. It reappeared as a morning-stat withthin hCJrns and continued to grow mtU fully round. The phases were an important discovery because it supported Copern;f.cus.' heliocentric system. rt is easy to say that the. phases ()f Venus fit the Moon Hides Y.enus This Saturday In the early seventeenth ee11tury, Galileo designed a t~Lescope tllat enlarged the iltlage · of d,istant objects. Through his telescope, Galileo w11s able to see a vast amount of C!elestial objects that could not be seen by the naked eye.He [)b:served four ()f the twelve satellites that revolve around Jll]l~ter.

Venus will disappear behind the sunlit side of tbe ·thin crescent of th\e waning Noon at about 6:35a.m. eastern daylight time. Venus will not disappear · suddenly but will take about 20 seconds to fade -out, because it has an appreciableangQlar size of 12 arcseconds (its real diameter is a little lessthan that of the Earth).

Page 10 CONCORDIENSIS, .April 23, 1987 Foundrd o1 l lm011 Co/J~~ /817 ------------- -----~-- Improve Evaluations: Improve T.eaching Altho~gh teacher evaluations by students are theot·etically required, each term there are professors who do not feel obligated to participate in this process of review. Tenured professors do not need ttJ hand in evaluations unless they wish to be eligible for merit increases in pay, promotions, or awards. The reluctance of professors to participate in the student evaluation system indicates one of several problems. Either they are not interested in self-improvement, they do not respect the students' opinions, or they do not believe the evaluation system is a fair one. In any case, these problems must be addressed. If professors are not fulfilling this evaluation responsibility for the first two reasons they have no place here at Union. Unfortunately these 11{)minal professors continue to receive normal merit 1n- creases{which are based on the cost of living increase) without any positive criticism of their ability as instructors to learn and develop from. There is no process whereby professors who are performing below standards (not available for office hours ... ) can be censured. Recently there has been much debate over the effectiveness of the current system of judging professors' teaching ability. Questions have arisen concerning the student evaluations, whether they are taken too seriously or not seriously enough. The accuracy of the student evaluations has also fallen under criticism. They are not an objective measure of ability nor are they based on tangible proof. Instructor ratings are affected by class size which the professors often have little control over,thisdoes not reflect'their teaching ability. Unfortunately student evaluations are still the primary source of information concerning professors' teaching performance. It would benefit both professors and students to have a· supplemental method of evaluating professors. The College has devoted a considerable sum of money to improve the physical facilities on campus. Now we should put forth a similar effort t()ward creating and maintaining a process of evaluation which would emphasize a continual improvement of instructors ability even after they receive tenure. The Faculty Review Board has encouraged a system of peer evaluation which would improve the current system. However, at present there is no formal procedure for peer review. A periodic review of professors could also be instated. Possibly even the chairmen of each departgment could sit in on classes or hold open sessions in which students could express their citiques of professors, both positive and negative. There are many different systems of evaluation which we could adopt which would be more acceptable than the current one. The. New Determining Curriculum: . Union's Future Most of us have forgotten that next year Union will have an en- tirely new \Liberal Learning\ program. It will have absolutely no effect on any students reading. this, but it is a step of staggering significance to the future of the College. The curriculum theme makes a statement about the ideology of the institution, its direction, goals, and in that sense will shape all other departments of the College. The intended replacement, the much-publicized General Education proposal, involved over a year of research and work. It made a move toward an organizing theme, that of Western Civilization, a theme also currently used by Harvard University. It was v<Jted down by Union faculty in search of an even better system. There were many individual complaints aboutthe proposal from faculty with specific interests, but most of all there was a pervading unease that the proposal defeated the sense of coherence it was intended to promote. General Education was a \distribution requirement\ system; it would allow a variety of selections within specific categories. However; the variety was great; allowing students to avoid requirements, while requiring so many courses that it could potentially interfere with the major while preventing students from trying certain fields. A committee chaired by Professor Gado is currently developing an alternative proposal, to be released to the community during sixth week of this term. The new proposal will be a \core curiculwn;\ that is, a smaller group of specific courses, developed especially for that purpose. This would obviously achieve a specific .goal; as defined by the course material, at the cost of eliminating student choice. It is therefore imperative that Union selects a worthy goal as the object of this central theme, something that will not only educate students about their world but also prepare them for a foreign world that plays an increasingly im- portant role in our society's actions as well as our own individual. behavior. It is also imperative that the courses chosen must correspond to normal student interest, covering a variety of fields as freshman preceptorial does in its reading list, and doing it better. We should also hope that the committee does not feel the pressure to com- promise that is so common in any institution, particularly strong on a committee trying to find an acceptable alternative. If they can nove for a innovative central theme that emphasizes the strengths )f the College, it will improve every student academically by >reparing them soundly for further work in any department and .;iving them a truly meaningful background. Furthermore, it will establish Union in the academic world, improving our prestige, and thereby stimulating present faculty as well as attracting new faculty. All that will happen if we do it right. The potential to fail is also there, as Harvard has seen. In a recent speech, Secretary of Education William Bennett condemned Harvard's core curriculum on Western Civilization. He said, \I think students would benefit from a real core curriculudm, a set of fundamental courses-or- dered, purposive, coherent. I cannot discern such a core curriculum here.\ Bennett added, \Harvard epitomizes the failure of American universities to provide students a real education.\ In the nex:t few weeks, Union's committee will finalize their concept of a real education. They should heed those words, as should the faculty who will vote on it, and the students, who can actually in- fluence those views. LETTERS . . - . . - - . \ ._ .. ·- . _Budget Neglects Financial Aid. Students · To the Editor: The newly adopted state · budg.et has a serious and critical element missing: · student financial aid for college students in need. These students and their · parents face increasing college · costs and an increased reliance on debt. Budget negotiations . began with the Governor promising to make higher education accessible to all high school graduates, regardless of 'their financial means. The reality is quite different: .The state decreased student financial aid by $35.5 million. And, because of • structural faults in the state's financial aid programs, the state, over the past three years, · has failed to spend another $70 million which had been ap- propriated for student aid programs, Over the past six years the percentage of tuition covered by TAP has shrunk- for the most needy students, by 11 percent. During. the same period, non- loan federal grants have decreased by 35 percent. This is occurring at a time when our economy and national defense require more, not less, college educated citizens. It has always been true in America that education .plays a major role in improving the opportunities for all citizens. In the earliest years of our nation and state, basic literacy was the key to a better livelihood. With the onset of industrialization in the 1860's, more highly d.eveloped skills were required, and a high scho()l diploma became the ticket· to op- portW1ity. Today, we are in a post- industrial economy technological, complex and ·service-oriented which demands an \}Ven more highly developed set of conceptual and analytical capabilities. It is an econom,y which requires college education as a prerequisite to job opportWlities. This will be even truer as we move toward the year 200(). We must enable more New Y c;~r~ers of aU economic means to attend and complet.e college. Our major vehicle to do this has been the Tuition Assistance Program, which seeks to eliminate the most insidious barrier to C{)llege for working amiddle class .families -the lack of adequate student . financial aid .. Since World W:at: II, access to college has always been provided by financial aid programs provided by govern- ment, businesses and colleges. The cost of higher education has increased and ~any of our New York State citi~ens are in danger of being locked out of the door of opportunity. The. in- dependent instituticms are doing their share in New York State: Over $400 million in fipancial ajd was provided from their own resources in the 1900 school year. We are simply asking that government do its fair share to l;lssist its citizens in obtaining access to the college of their choice, and that choice should not be restricted by ability to · pay. A student should choose the college which provides the field of study he-she is in- terested in, in the setting which fits his-her needs. Government must be willing to invest inore, not less, in our student populaticm - yoW1g and old. And that population is changing. It is no longer solely 18to 25 year olds. More students are taking longer to ·complete college. More adults are going back to college to enable them to change careers. More single parents with young children are trying to avoid a life of dependency by r.etuming to college. And, finally, we must face up to the fact that the traditional 18·25 year old pool consists of families with less income and accumulated savings, Debt is not the answer either. Until government leaders assume a more balanced share of student financial a'id, not only will tuitions continue to rise, but increasing numbers of low and middle income students will be denied the opportunity to attend college. The financial stress is real: debt cannot be pushed much further. The Tuition Assistance Program needs a major upward adjustment in awards for financially needy students. Sincerely, C. Mark Lawton, President Corrunission on Independent Colleges and Universities All students are invited to meet with the candidates who will be on campus to interview for the Assistant Dean of Students position. The candidates will be available at either 10:30 am or 3:30pm, according to the schedule listed below. Theirresumes are available in the Dean of Students' Office.

This is occurring at a time when our economy and national defense require more, not less, college educated citizens. It has always been true in America that education plays a major role in improving the opportunities for all citizens. In the earliest years of our nation and state, basic literacy was the key to a better livelihood. With the onset of industrialization in the 1860's, more highly developed skills were required, and a high school diploma became the ticket to op- portW1ity. Today, we are in a pest- industrial economy technological, complex and service-oriented which demands an ~ven more highly develeped set of conceptual and analytical capabilities. It is an economy which requires college education as a prereq1:1isite to job opportW1ities. This will be even truer as we move toward the year 2000. We must enable more New Yorkers of all economic means to attend and complete college. Our major vehicle to do this has been the Tuition Assistance Program, which seeks to eliminate the most insidious barrier to college for working amiddle class families- the lack of adeq1:1ate student financial aid. Since World War II, access to college has always been provided by financial aid programs provided by govern- ment, businesses and colleges. The cost of higher education has increased and many of our New York State citizens are in danger of being locked out of the door of opportunity. The in- dependent institutions are doing their share in New York State: Over $400 million in financial aid was provided from their own resources in the 1986 school year. We are simply asking that government do its fair share to assist its citizens in obtaining access to the college of their choice, and that choice should not be restricted by ability to pay. A student should choose the college which provides the field of study he-she is in- terested in, in the setting which fits his-her needs. Government must be willing to invest more, not less, in our student population - young and old. And that population is changing. It is no longer solely 18 to 25 year olds. More students are taking longer to complete college. More adults are going back to college to enable them to change careers. More single parents with young children are trying to avoid a life of dependency by returning to coHege. And, finally, we mlist face up to the fact that the traditional 18-25 year old pool consists of families with less income and accumulated savings. Debt is not the answer either. Until government leaders asswne a more balanced share of stNdent financial aid, not only will tuitions continue to rise, but increasing numbers of Jow and middle income students will be denied the opportunity to attend college. The financial stress is real: debt cannot be pushed much further. The Tuition Assistance Program needs a major upward adjustment in awards for financially needy students. Sincerely, C. Mark Lawton, President Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities All students are invited to meet with the candidates who will be on campus to interview for the Assistant Dean of Students position.

CONCORDIENSIS, Aptit 23, 1987 Page 11 C .. OMMENTAR.IES' \ . . . . a LETTERS The Pork- Barrel Curriculum By ALAN Nl!lLSON r \I used to daydream about making myself famous be being . the first person to design, a liberal education curriculum satisfactory to all jurisdictions. It would include four years of English and writing courses, enough language courses to produce competency in the literature and culture of one language., proficiency in a se<;ond; Ame~;ican, European, and non-Eurpoean history; political .science and public affairs; classical civilization; Old Testament, New Testament and non-Western religion; sociology, anthropology, and psychology, Western and non- Western;· the mathematics and two laboratory sciences our scientific colleagues insist everyone must have, along with courses in the impact of science on public affairs: ecology; nuclear power, and so on; appreciation and literacy in art, music~ and film; women's studies urban studies, black studies, and the Holocaust- just for starters.\ (J. L.Sammons, in Profession 86.) A while back; I sounded off in these pages about the shape of the GenEd curriculum that had been proposed in the fall. It was, I said,·cautious, unimaginative-, superfidal - a re-shuffling of the old cards in a way that was neigher confident nor energetic. It was no real solution to the problems of Liberal Learning. My complaint was (and remains) that we have neglected the work that should come llefore building - a new \GeriEd program. instead of looking at the foundations, the proposed program has tinkered with the surfaces. Jeffrey Sammons, whose daydream appears. in the box above, shows us what happens when we try to satisfy all jurisdictions; he c{llculates his \ideal\ curriculum as requiring somewhere around 14 years for a bachelor's degree. If you don't like the sound of that, what would you delete from his scheme? Who would quarrel with the virtues listed there? But something's wrong, right? And what's wrong is that he describes a curriculum of politics, not policy. If everybody's favorite thing has to be included, we end up with what I call the \POrk Barrel Curriculum.'' If you try to build a GenEd program by making sure that all parties and interests are involved, you end up with something like Sammon's nightmare - or scaled down to reality, like Liberal Learning, perhaps. Politically, it's the easiest way - each department of the college gets a piece of the action. It's the way Liberal Learning was devised a decade ago, and the \new\ .curriculum doesn't alter the balance. · When the · fit iakes us, we rearrange the shape of the requirements, but not too much - not much at all. We ask our- selves to do just about what we have been doing, maybe changing the name. The con- stituencies remain the . same, not because they're confirmed but because they're never challenged. So the Pork Barrel Curriculum becomes also the Unexamined Curriculum. Back to Basics · . . . But once every couple of decades, I think we .need to return to conversations more fundamentaL We need to look once again at just what it is we think every educated person should know. We can never • .. kr10w whether Verities are indeed Eternal unless we look hard at them now and again, Remember, we're talking about Requirements here. We're saying that every student, to,receive adegree from Union, must enroll in certain courses, in specific academic areas. We are speaking, not of what may be desirable for this or that student, but what is essential for every student. We are naming studies without which we would not regard any student as worthy of our diploma. With a mandate as solemn as that, we ought to think large and long about what we regard as truly essential .. not just ad- mirable or interesting, but essential. And that is just the kind of thinking, I say, .that we have not been sufficiently urged to do. If the Zwicker Committee spent time on it. I can see .no sign of it in their report. And if the Gado Committee is inclined to, I· can't see where they will find the time before they must report this spring. This is not really a matter of blaming anybody - committees like this usually do what they think they're eXpected to. do. But I could wish that the first committee had thought it their first duty to look at bed rock again - and even more im- portant, to invite or coerce the rest of the community to join them. · It would drive us mad to look at First Principles every Monday, but it's been a long time since we've seen in the Faculty (or the Administration either) any serious talk about the most basic motives of our enterprise. Why are certain things required of all students? What is essential? What's desirable? And what's the difference? For Example • • • Take (only for example) th~ virtues of a lab science. That requirement may be virtuous indeed, but if so, it will show well when we ask ourselves once again why it is. Instead of just assuming it is a good thing, why not take account of it, examine it, make the case for it on its most fundamental grounds? Wl}.at kinds and levels of arguments would a scientist make? Would a sympathetic non-scientist make the . same case or a different one? · I do not mean the kind of off- the-cuff, hip-shot statement made in a faculty meeting; I mean a considered, reasoned, carefully articulated apologia that concerns only the need of · every student to give .serious study to a lab 'SCience. Are the grounds practical - e.g.~ every responsible citizen should know certain facts and prin~iples, for intelligent functioning as a citizen? Arethey phUosophical- e.g., science as one way of knowing one kind ol reality? Are they a matter of a student's cognitive development -e.g., an experience of a particular kind of reasoning and proof? The case ought to consider whether any .science will do, or a par- ticular one; Whether a ''soft\ science may do as well as a ''hard\ · one.; whether a laboratory is essential. And so on. If the foundation-case were stated, we would want to ask next what kinds of courses a non-science student ought to be offered, to fulfill the aim of the cwse. The same physics as engineers need, for ex~ple? The same introductory 'biology as we have, or something dif- .. ferent? One course for all, or a number of choices? Another question: should these matters concern only the faculty in science, or are the opinions of non-scientists germane'? If we speak of the general education of all, can the sciences win an enthusiastic endorsement of the rest of the campus, or must it be just the pork~barrel resignation: I'll let you have your licks, will you let me have mine? Now, I happen tothink that all .. undergraduates should have. some work in the ~ciences, though I think they have not always been adequately ~erved by the courses offered. But what's m.ore important, I think, is that the believers oc- casionally take stock, return to To the Editors: It has come to . our attention that a major procedural change has taken place regarding Union's Women's Volleyball team. While we are aware that there were problems with the . program last fall,. the means by which these problems are being resolved appear to conflict with the philosophy behind Union's intercollegiate athletic program. This past Week members of last year's team received a letter from Coach Bonnie Gehling stating that there will not be open tryouts for last year's members and only those who receive invitations will be allowed to participate in the program. Coach Gehling has also stated that this decision has been made with the ad- ministration's backing. We find this new policy to be unfair and discriminatory and feel that each student should be judged afresh at the beginning of each season. We cannot understand how the ad- ministration could back such an unjust policy and sincerely hope that this change will be carefully reconsidered.

Students Need to Take~ction By KEN BUDKA In last week's Concordy, a student wrote a letter com- plaining about the inef- fectiveness of the Union College Security Department. The student's car was vandalized while parked in one of the ·dormitory lots. He claimed that 1 this act of vandalism was the direct result of lax security · procedures on the part of the force. . Two weeks ago,. an uniden· tified man entered West College .. during the night and walked into the unlocked rooms of sleeping Union females. He remained in each of several rooms for a number of minutes, telling the residents he, \needed a place to stay.\ He was in thedormitory for over six hours till finally a Union student notified the .~ecurity Department. · Is it fair to place all the blame for these two incidents on the ineffectiveness of the Union the Union commWlity to be their eyes ·and ears. How many people saw John Nolan's car get vandalized or the other cars that have been vandalized this · year? How many Union students came in contact with the West College intruder before security was notified? If students believe that there is room for improvement in the service that the Security Department provides, they should let their suggestions be known. Perhaps the addition of one more night patrol car could increase the security of the campus. But the largest room for improvement lies With the students themselves.

On studio recordings SQUEEZE plays a brand of easy, effective rock; letting their tuneful lyrics lead their sound. Led by songwriters Difford and Tillbrook, it is those very lyrics that distinguish them from other bands.

Starting the evening out, SQUEEZE got the audience going with a couple of favorites; \Annie Get Your Gun\ and \lf I Didn't Love You.\ However, they were not able to sustain any real momentum to match the first few songs. They used the show to highlight a few new songs, the highlight being \Cigarettes and the Single Man,\ a sort of ''Black Cofee\ part two, that asked the souful question of the Alone,\ ... what do you have to go home to.\ Many of the songs were slower than most of the other music they played, making them more effective. The best work of the night was done ()n \Take Me I'm Yours,\ with ·SQUEEZE breaking from the hard style to a rythmic arrangement that allowed th lyrics to be un- derstood. But muchtoo often the band took the safe route,trying. to make their songs dancea ble for the crowd.

SQUEEZE's musicianship-was obviously good enough ·to perform on their own terms, rather than try to be the dance band that they aren't.

A large portion of the film was spent · discussing the in- troduction of .Dada and Surrealism and the affect these ideas had on art and sculpture. Dadaism can be elq)lained as \minimal art\ and Marcel Duchamp's \ready mades\ prove how everyday objects can beviewed as art. One such example of this iS his broken panes of glass. Duchamp did not even break the glass bim· self; he saw them breaking on a truck and saw something in them. The fihn was very enjoyable and equally educational. I at- tended the afternoon showing in Hale House Lower Lounge which enabled the audience to eat lunch during the film. The only unfortunate inconvenience during the film was the in- termittent interruptions from one table of political sceince professors who were seated in the rear of the room. They were more interested in holding their own conversation than wat- ching film. The lack of silence made for an unnerving at- mosphere. Today the first showing of the series entitled \The New World\ will be shown. The first showing will take place in the Milano Lounge at 12:30 and the second will be in Arts 215 at 7:00. Both shows are free of charge and open to the public. For more information please call the Arts Department at 370- 6201. This cabaret which-featured Dave Provost, · Leslie Orner, Jim Havard and Wendy Richards was one of the most outstanding performances of this season. The 10:.00 P.M. performance was quite . crowded, the audience even spread themselves among the Old Chapel's balcony. For we upper classmen, this evening brought back the nostalgia of the cabaret's of our freshman year. The audience was also in- spirational and should be credited for their enthusiasm and participation in this per- formance~ People danced in the aisles, sang the chorus to songs and supported the artists 100%. Adam Rossman emceed the event. He metaphorically referred to the audience as a ''happy family.\ Adam matter- of-factly introduced the cabaret performers and kindly spared the audience of the poor comedy which they are often subjected to during many cabarets. Adam did mention that these artists have been satirized by Concordy. Therefore, in writting this aricle I shall omit any subjective opinion. This review truly speaks for the masses.

Union's · Mo·untebanks started pr()duction work winter term for Godspell's opening parent's · weekend (May 7-9). The show will run May 12 and ·May 14 through ~Y 16. Tickets cost ~-3.00 for students, $4.00 for 1 aculty and staff, and $5.00 for the general public. Gcldspell is known officially ts a musical based on the gospel .wcording to St. Matthew, the story of the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The plot consists of a string of stories about his teachings and these stories are told as parables·. The show is not so much religious as it is a \musical cornedy with socially relevent issues.'' Jesus is portrayed as an ordinary man sharing ·his knowledge of the world, not as a legendary biblical figure. Set in modern times, the play's underscore is popular contemporary music. \Day by Day' 'nis the · most recognized song in Godspell and, typical of the show's music, it is upbeat and positive. The music and lyrics for the show were written by Stephen Schwartz with much of the dialogue lifted from the New Testament and updated. Steve Boone, as set designer, transformed the Nott into a warehouse. The setting makes the audience an integral part of the show's environment. Like the cast, the audience listens and learns from the songs and dialogue. Musical director Drena Webster Cl has been working with the cast members as a whole and individually on the music since the middle of winter term. Over 50 people auditioned for the play and the final cast consists of 10 actors-actresses. Director Randi Goldstein had a difficult time selecting the group and of thenr as a whole, she says that they are aU very talented. Some are better singers, some are better actors and some are better dancers, but as an ensemble, . they are able to balance each others' strengths and weaknesses. Michael Hiller is Jesus of Nazareth and Bruce. Osler portrays both John the Baptist and Judas. The rest of the cast members are indefined characters, all of whom sing solos and back up for solos. They are: Winston Bliss, Melissa Bloom, Steve Brown, Betsy Gillespie, Karen Goos, Andrew Livernois, Adnrea Mobilio, and Leslie Shamilzadeh. There is not much in the script about the in- dividual charactor traits. In rehearsal, the cast works to build and create mannerisms, habits and personality for their part. They meet and rehearse five nights a week for about two or three hours a night. It is important for an ensemble to rehearse a lot, to know each other and to trust each other in order to be able to experiment and try to push and expand the limits set by the script (and the script has a lot of leeway for · individual interpretation). The play's choreographer is Katie Boyd. She works closely with Randi to find the best possible way o.f using movement to get across the show's concept. There are very few stage directions in the script so Katie, by listening to the music, decides what in- terpretations would best reflect the song's feeling. Director Randi Goldstein is motivated and she knows what she wants. Her dedication and the dedication of her assistant Stephen Burdman, have pushed the cast and production as far as it has come and they will continue to inspire them to grow and create in the following weeks. After all of the time and energy that has been exerted, Godspell should be a smash. GODSPELL.

Notes by Lucy Du~an Translations by Lucy D.uran and Sidia Jatta Amadu Bansang J obarteh Amadu Bansang, a Manuinka professiorul musician, is one of the (>UtSt<lJH.ling players of the kora in The Cambia. This record pre~ents some of Ute pieces for which he is best known. [ncluding some .of the oldest and tnost prestigious items in the repertoire, such as Lambango and Tutu Jara. Amadu regards himself above all as a vocal' accompanist, but he also e11joys a cons· iderable reputation as a solo player, and. ! t is this aspect of his music to which this record .is mainly devoted. His instrumental .style is highly individual; pethaps·its most striking feuwre is its clarity and brilliance .of .tone. As the kora setves prfmarily to accompany singing, how- ever, two vocal items have been included in tne record. Amadu Ba:nsang was born about the beginning of the 'First World War. in Tambasansang (upper-river Gambia), where his fatlwr,. who was originally from Mali, had settled under the patronage of Chief Falai Kora .. After Falai Kora 1 S death Amadu's family moved further west to Bansang, where Amadu g;rew up, and hence became popularly known as 'Amadu .Bansang'. His earlies.t ·instruction on the kora was fr()m his father, wl10 taught him to play in the Malian style; later he was taught by his e.lder brother, Bala Jobarteh, whose son is now one of the leading players in the Mali National Ensemble. Having established his reputati<m as a kora player, Amadu, still in his early twenties, .left Bansang to seek patronage. He· settled in the Komhos (western Cambia), and. following a period of intensive study of ti1e Koran, he became musician to Sanyali Bojang (the present Chief of Brikama), who has be.en h..is patron for the last twenty y~ars.

The answer frorn this critic is; yes, but ... The problem with the movie is not that it's bad; just that it is not good enough to warrant the five · dollar price tag at the cinema. This is the kind ·Of movie that will invariably be Shown on cable couple thousand times, as well as doing a good business at the local video store. BLIND DATE takes an old joke abQut \ ... the girl who gets wild when. she drinks.\ and tries to make two hours of en- tertainment out of it. Willis stars as the victim of the joke; a yuppie type (the new movie cliche), wh~ needs a date to impress the boss at a business dinner. On the recommendation of his brother, he arranges a date with the lovely Nadia, played by Kim Basinger. Warned not to let her drink because she gets out of hand, Willi$ willfully lets her imbibe while anticipating the results.

CONCORDIENSIS, April 23, 1987 Page 15 Amadu Bansan.g Jobarteh· MASTEROFTHE KORA Notes by Lucy Duran Translations by Lucy Duran and Sidia Jatta Allladu Bansang Jobarteh Amadu Bamang, a Mandinka professional musician, is ()fle of the outstanLling players of the kora in The Gatrlbia. This record presents some of the pieces for which he is best known. induding some of the oldest ancl most prestigious items in the repertoire, such as Lambango and Tutu lara. Amadu regards himself above all as a vocal accompanist, but he also enjoys a cons- iderable reputation as a solo player. and it is this aspect of his music to which this record is mainly clevoted. His instrumental style is highly individual; perhaps its most striking feature is its clarity and brilliaRce of tone. As the kora serves primarily to accompany singing, how- ever, two vocal items have beeR included in the record. Amadu Bansang was borN about tbe beginning of tile First World War. in Tambasansang (upper-river Gambia), where his father, who was originally from Mali, had settled under the patronage of Chief Falai Kora. After Falai Kora's death Amadu's family moved further west to Bansang, where Amadu grew up, and hence became popularly known as 'Amadu Bansang'. His earlie~t instruction on the kora was from his father, who taught him to play in the MaHan style; later he was taught by his elder brother, Bala Jobartch, whose son is now one of the leading players in the Mali National Ensemble. Having established his reputation as a kora player, Amadu, still in his early twenties, left Bansang to seek patronage. He settled in the Kombos (western Gambia), and, following a period of intensive study of ti1e Koran, he became musician to Sanyali Bojang (the present Chief of Brikama), who has been his patron for the last twenty years. Arts Dept. & I.S.U. Sponsors (African Harp-Lute) FREE CONCERT Sunday, April26 8 p.m. Performing Arts Studio, Arts Bldg., Union College ANY IDEAS For Art's Articles? and Julie THE ARTS Jim and Buddy at Tile Movies By JIM MacLAUGHLIN BLIND DATE starring Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger directed by Blake Edwards rated: PG 13 I suppose that the big question cencerning the film BUND DATE is if Bruce Willis (of \Moonlighting\ fame), can succeed in a movie. Tile answer from this critic is; yes, but ... The problem with the mevie is not that it's bad; just that it is net good enough to warrant the five dollar price tag at the cinema. This is the kind of movie that will invariably be shown on cable couple thousand times, as well as doing a good business at the local video store. BLIND DATE takes an old joke about \ ... the girl who gets wild when she drinks.'', and tries to make two hours of en- tertainment out of it. Willis stars as the victim of the joke; a yuppie type (the new movie cliche), who needs a date to impress the boss at a business dinner. On the recommendation of his brother, he arranges a date with the lovely Nadia, played by Kim Basinger. Warned not to let her drink because she gets out of hand, Willis willfully lets her imbibe whHe anticipating the results. Of course, the even.ing doesn't go as planned and Willis finds himself out ef a jeb, hlll1ted by Nadia's psychotic ex-b()yf.riend (portrayed wonderfully by John Larroquette), aNd finally in jail. 'fie film is plagued, however, by two severe problems: the plodding direction of Blake Edwards, and the woeful miscasting of Kim Basinger. Edwards' direction of BLIND DATE pulls out all of the u.sual devices from his moves; car crashes, spilled food, and ruined social occasions. But the movie falls short in the fact that these scenes are used rr1ore as filler for the script rather than the farcical comedy they should be Hence; the .pratfalls become boring and predictable, such as the last scene . in which Willis and Larroquette share a messy fight araund some food tables. The problem with Kim Basinger is that she is plain, and simply; boring. Her role calls for her to act wild ·\and uninhibited, yet aU the while luring Willis on to greater promises as the evening wears on. In films such as 9% WEEKS, it was perfect for 1ler to act in embarassing scenes and sUll maintain a level of feminine dignity. However, BLIND DATE is a farce, and dignity has no place in comedy roles such as hers in this movie. Rather than seeming carefree and erotically promising, Basinger seems stiff and un- comfortable in the role of the wild inebriate. The role would have been better served by someone such as Melanie Griffith. As a film, BLIND DATE fails as a comedy; it's not that funny. Basinger's blandness throws off the major area of humor in the film. It is this reviewer's advice that people save a sawbuck, and wait until next fall when it comes around on cable. FILM GRADE: C Campus Movies This Week Peggy Sue Got Married Never mind the odd lack of plot and enjoy the stunning performance from Kathleen Turner as the middle age housewife who gets the chance to change her life from the past. Directed by Francis Ford Coppala the movie also stars Niclas Gage as Peggy Sue's irresponsible husband. An oscar nominee to Turner for her great work; she saves the picture and makes it worth watching. Fri., Sat. & Sun. at 1.19 and ll.

CONCORDIENSIS, April 23, 1987 Page 19 1:1.:-. Athlete of the Week By CHRIS HINCKLEY The Union College Baseball Team has had its fair share of bad luck this spring. The recent dreary weather has put a dark cloud over the beginning of their season but the Dutchmen are trying hard to rtQt let these adversities affect their start. To find the cure to· the gloom you don't even·have to look past the baseball diamond. The bright spot that .I speak of is Dutchmen pitcher Rich Bartosch. Rich's performance so far this season has been excellent and he is following a path in his senior year that would cap off an outstanding pitching career at Union College. Bartosch began playing baseball at Union his sophmore year and his performance that season could only make you wish that he had played as a freshman. As a sophm:ore Bartosch saw a lot of pitching time and recorded some jm- pressive stats. He pitched 51.2 innings struck out 38 batters, walked 35 and allowed 40 hits. Rich Bartosch His reeord ended up being 4-2 .and his eta was a very low 2.17. In Rich's Junior year he en- joyed an equal amount of success. Because of an early season shelling Rich was fighting back all season in the era category but his other stats showed his real prowess and his record ended up at 4-1. Last year, after the team won the ECAC's, Rich travelled to New York City to play summer ., ball. He played for the Liver- pool Rainbows wllere he was scouted by such pro baseball teams as the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cincinatti Reds. _As a Division HI .pit~her Rich is fighting an uphill battle and ff does get I drafted it will be a notable achievement. Although the Draft is on Rich's mind he is concentrating more on the baseball season at hand, \I wouldlike to make the NCAA's. It would be a nice way to end my career and it would mean a lot to the team, especially the seniors.'' This spring thus far Rich has done quite well. His era stands at 1.33 and his 2-0 record makes him responsible for half of the teams 4 wins. The 6'4, 200 lb. Bartosch is a member ·Of the class of 1987 and he is an electrical engineering major. He went to Corcoran High School in Syracuse, N.Y. where he achieved All-City status. Congratulations to Rich whose performance this year could be the key to a trip to the NCAA's. · Track Team Impressive at B.C. By TRACK TEAM The Union College track teams challenged several of the top teams in the East last Saturday as coach Ru.ss Ebbets took a small contingent of athletes to the . prestigious Boston College Rela~s. The meet was held at the Eagles new outdoor facility in Newton, Massachusetts. Competing against Division I schools, several Union team members turned. in personal bests or school records. Senior :Rob Mohlar led the Dutchmen with an impressive third place, in the 800 meters. Mohlar ran 1:52.1, his fastest time .of the year, to qualify for Division III nationals for the second straight year. Julie Halpern also scored for Union, taking eighth inthe 400 hurdles. Halpern won her heat of the hurdles in a new school record time of 68.2 seconds. Sophmore Lorie Anderson also won her heat of the hurdles, clocking a time of 71.2 seconds, as both she and Halpern quali~ied for the state meet. Also turning in a new school record was fresh- man Eileen Brady, whose time of 5:06.0 in the 1500 meters broke luge Stockman's old school record by 0.2 seconds. Brady finished fourth in her heat of that event. Q) \'C 0 uj .6' .9 0 ..c: 0. Senior runners Steve Hayes and Rob Mohlar hand off. Both Steve and Hob did well at B.C. this last weekend.

Freshman Jeff ·Simkins added a time of 61.8 in the 400 hurdles, and Chip Silver rounded out . Union's strong .showing with a leap of 6 feet in theHighJwnp.

At the time of printing, the Brewers had won 13 straight games, which tied them with the '82 Braves for the Major League record in consecutive victories at the start · of the season. All winter long everyone talked about Cleveland and the Yankees with little mention of anyone e~se. Yet the Brewers seem to be playing baseball better than ever before. There is one thing looming in the minds of everyone in baseball though, .it is not even May yet. Although the Tigers of '84, the A's of '81 and the Braves of '82 aU had in between 9 and 13 game winning streaks and too.k first p~ce in their division, only the Tigers won the World Series. As a matter of fact, of the 6 teams that have started off the season with 10 or more straight vic- tories, the Tigers are the only team to even make it to the World Series. Milwaukee is at least making ·their victories exciting. Last Sunday, the Brewers went into the bottom of the ninth down by NOliN THE BOX SCORE Mark Zimmerman a 4-1 count. With the aid or two homeruns, the score at the end of the game read 6-5 Brewers. The re!?t of the leagu_e seems to be fairly normal. In the AL east the Yankees are right on pace with the Brewers and have a 6 game winning streak. In the West the Angels and Twins are switching back and forth in first place. In the NL West Cin- cinnati and Giants are in a tight battle with Houston not far behind,. In the East, the Car- dinals lead the Mets by a game or two, but just lost their number one pitcher,. John Tudor, in a freak accident against the Mets. The Mets catcher, Barry Lyons, was chasing a foulbaU and ran rigllt into the Cards dugout where he collided with Tudor and broke a bone right below Tudors knee~ In addition to that, the Cards nwnber one catcher, Tooy Pena is also on injured reserve with a broken hand. Don't worry Mets fans, St. Louis will be out of it by early June, but keep an eye on the Pirates. Just to mention the hockey playoffs, \the winner of the Philadelphia-Islander game will win the Stanley Cup,\ says hockey expert Doug Schur. However, Edmonton will be hungry after last years catastrophic incident that eliminated them last year. @ClD®~liD®m 00®22 Ever wonder what the longest game in professional Hockey history was?

OJ OJ .e D.. Laxwomen .Potential Beginn,ing to Show Laxmen on Q~11est for C~up A Silver Lining? By ANDREW MILJ..ER What can you say? For the third time in as many matches the Union College me11s' tennis team were defeated befol'e the doubles teams took: to the courts. The latest d()wning came at the hands of Slddm.ore, 6-3. That is not the ~i~n of a healthy team. But watt, there is a light on the horizon. If every cloud has a silver linimg then Dutchman tennis sholll<l take comfort in the fact tllat they just might be the best ~3- team around. If you think it sounds kind of weak, kind of like the box of Rice-a-Roni yD>u receive as a consolation prize for hitting the devil on the J ok.ers Wild, think again. Union doubles play has been outstanding, acting not only as a catalyst but alsO> as the backbone of the team. 1'be three doubles tandems are playing agressive tennis an(J are all coming together well .as a unit. Chad Levin and Doug Banlts are undefeated in team play as Union's number one dU·O· They have competed against tllree of the top teams in the leaglle ana have come away witiJ. decisive victories. Levin and Eanks ur;>set Skidmore's highly- t(}uted ntimber one squad ()f Bill Jennys and Allen Smith 8-6 in a pro-set contest. Union's Dan Elkeslassy and Joe Voyticky finally seem to be coming around to the emotional play they exhibited in the pre- season. It was a tough thrEe set 7-5, 4-6, 6-2loss to Skidmore that bro11ght the enthusiasm back into their game. Jim O'Brien and Dave Lesch picked up another team point and gave the dutchman a 2-1 edge in the doubles play with a 6-4:, 6-4 victory. O'Brien and Lesch continue to look strong as they boosted their per-sonal record to 2-1. Union's downfall, as usual, carne in the singles. Although the matches were close, a victory anywhere from number. two down to number six singles would have turned this match around. Captain Banks again played stellar tennis as he came back fmm a 6-1 second set thrashing to take the third set and the match 6-4. From then on it was all downhill and all Skidmore. Levin was again hooked up in a three set battle that could have gone either way at any point ··in the match. Levin played superior tennis but didn't have enough to get him over the hump to victory. Levin's play is crucial to the teams success and he wi1l be looked heavily toward if the team has a chance to turn their Chad Levin ser'Ves up another winning game. April23, 1987 Capital District Cup In Laxmen' s Reach .

After last ye~r's fourth place finish in the Upstate · t()ttrnament, this seasQn promised to be the most fruitful yet. The team began its .season witll a match on Library field tile weekend of .April 4. Uliforturtately history repeated itslef; Union lost to a strong HC>fstra sqt~ad by the .score of 12- 0. The loss .of fullback Gret~hen Be~ker, due to a broken a1'm, weighed heavily on the out<!ome of the game.

Union's offense, which has not been as productive as in the poast, has been hurt by the loss of at- tackman Will Piers~l and middies Pete Agric01la and Blake Henderson. The lalmlen's defense, led by junior goalie John Thorne, has sufcered in depth by the loss of pla)J'~I·s due to poor academic performance. Nonetheless, the D11tclnnen have the capacity to go un- defeated for the remaining six games of the .season. Although unproductive all yeac.

On attack, Junior Phil Horn leads the team in sc()ring with senior Anthony DaRin very close behind. On defense Thorne backs a solid Wlit consisting of senior Mal\k Leyton and juniors Gary Cornick, Greg Leahy and Chuck Weber. This Saturday, the Dutclunen will take on the Hamilton Continentals at home, on the turf at 4:00. Next Tuesday, Union will play for the Capital District cup when they take on the Engineers of RPI at 3:30 in Troy. the first three games due to a waiting period for a recovering broken arm.

• CXVI, No!· 22 Asbestos Test Results Completed; PTL Assures No ·Dangers By D.B. GULLIVER Late .Monday the Physical Plant department received the resUlts of the most reeent asbestos testing in West College and the Rathskellar. The results · show that despite following improper removal procedure in the Rathskellar and dmage to insulation covering . in West, there is no significant eon~ tamination problem in eit:her , location .. The air sampling, conducted . April 21 by PTlrlnspe<.torate, · was more extensive than the .previous testing that Union conducted.

PTL also sampled the Paper St()rage room in West and the office area in the Skellar, two locations employees cited as trouble areas. According to Mr. Mar-k Wysin, a certified industtial hygienist at PTL, the reslllts are \very comparable\ tG thos.e determined by Enviroment Oiie, and in fact show lesser levels. However, PTL used a different technique and the . results are not easy to compare · (see tables p. 2).. However, the \lower limit of detection\ as established by NIOSH is 10 fibers per 100 fields (a field is a Specific microscopic area; 0.00785 sq. mm.) and at no tnne did samples exceed that level. Mr. Wysin said that those levels are \a factor of ten,., below warning levels. Union did not receive the results in time for Concordiensis to solicit com- ments from state and federal agencies .

Professor Ludwig sp()ke on the tenure process in response to apparent student disc«Jntent. Professor Ludwig is Chair of the .Faculty Review Board, which oversees and participat~s ill the tenure decislon making process.

Summary ofTenure Pr01cess First, a swnmary ()£ the process as·· it' stands·· now. Professors ·are hired on ()ne of . either two tracts-the te11ure tract ()r the visiting p!'()fessor tract. Obviously, those hire([ on the tenure tract are eligible for tenure. In the fall of a -c!an- didate 's tllird year, lte-.she undergoes a merit review. This evaluation consists of a written review by the chairperson ofthe department of the candidate. ·1hese reviews then go t.o the FRB where they make a list of appro~imately twenty five professors who they feel deserve a merit increase (i.e. a pay raise of either $1 ,om or $1,500). This list goes to the Vice President of Academic Aff~irs who examines the list. Then. in the spring of the candidate's third year, lte ex- periences a \reappointment review.\ The department chairperson and SEnior members of the department begi~ an evaluation which . con:sists of interviews W~Lth students and a- reading awd critique of tne scholarly work. A report is written up and given ,(o the FRB who then decides iftllie candidate's ccntract should tile renewed f()r another tblrtee years. If the FRB rejects :tile candidate, lle is given a CJ!Ie- year contract. Ifthe candidate's contract is re11ewed, an Ad H10c Committee, separate from tile FRB, is formed to review tile candidate. See Commentary on Page 10 The Ad Hoc Committee do~es not begin to investigate the candidate until the fall of the- si;xth year~ The Committee interviews twenty five to thirty students, alunmi, and every member of th.e candidate\s department. Concerning ilte candidate's scholarship, a committee of ten members is formed to read and evaluate tile work. The candidate has tl»e right to approve or disappr()V\e of the members of this ca~n­ mittee. The Ad Hoc Committe-e with this information makes -<~ decision taking primarily iJlto consideration teaching abilit.y and scholarshiJ) with camr;nL.s service a minor factor. In onetJf the two main categories, th-e candidate mJ,lst be judgecd \excellent\ and in the other hE must be judge<! at least \vers good.\ The Ad Hoc's report is th:en given to the F'R.B who will holds conference with the Ad Hoc Coiurnittee to discuss the= material.

Many .American students have already expressed a strong wish to practi-ce a foreign language and to know more about the various cultures of the world. The successful terms abroad at Union have in some ways already answered this wish. The majority of students who went on any of these terms abroad have come back with a strong desire to return to the country they have just discovered and to the friends they have met. Also, most students who are going on a term abroad would like to get a better idea of the coWltry in whichthey wilLspend more than two months. Thus, the in· ternatlonal HollSe, which would be composed of 50 percent Americans and 50- percent foreigners, will be a good op- porttmity for those students who want to feel the atmosphere that they had or will have in that foreign country.

President Morris Delivers Lectures On West Coast By MICHAEL SILBERSTEIN Since last Thursday, Union College President John S. Morris has been on the West Coast at selected hotels speaking at a series of gatherings of the Union College Alumni Association. President Morris. has spoken in Los Angeles, San Diego, S~ln Francisco, Portland, and Seattle. The series of lecturer will end tomorrow evening in Denver. Topics of discussion include Union's outstanding 1986 football season which is cap- tured in highlights on a videotape. Also, President Morris narrates a slide presentation on campus facilities, including the newly renovated Alumni Gym, the new swimming pool, and the soon-to-open College Center. Keeping in touch with past gradu.ates is an important part of Union's image with alumni to preserve.

Continued from page 1 inpublic places, questions as to determining violations of ethics, and an aspect of the state budget called ''Member Items.\ Mauro went C>n to ex- plain how thes.e and other issues break down into a problem of the proper distribution of political power. For example, the proposal to ban smoking in public places was not enacted because tlne State Supreme Court ruled that the ·Public Health Conunission was ex- ceeding its authority and that \such broad social issues should be deleg~ted by legislature.\ However, noted Mauro, the basis for this verdict is to<» broad and inclusive to remain unchallenged. Mauro explained that the system of checks and balances said that as the separation of powers is not as ingrained in State Constitutions as in the National Constitution, states develop more checks and balances, inevitably causing more controversies over the proper delegation of powers. Mauro's speech lasted close to an hour, during which time he explained extensively various examples of legislative and legal ambiguities concerning the proper delegation of powers between the state legislature and the executive branch.

The sequence of events began on Friday -evening with a presentati<m by Eddy Remy and other college·stud,ents about the . experiences they shared when living in Kenya. The · presentation was well attended by both faculty members and the student body. Various points of interest emerged during the discussion, such as the so<:ietal values .. in lC~ny.a, the con- troversial issues concerning game hunting, etc. On Saturday, a very ;large audience .gathered in Old Chapel to witness the \Inter- national Festival\ the main focus of the weekend. Master of Cet·emonies for tbe evening was Matteo Coveri Abbondio. The evening began with a Buana Dance, perfovmed by Eddy Remy. This wa.s followed by a fashion show, with fashions modeled by Arlene .SUverio, Leslie Orner, Kenya Lenoir, Erika Rauscher, Meredith Auten, Tony Corsello, and Darryo Tlggle. The clothes were kindly provide<l by Mabou, a boutiqUe located in Saratoga. ' An Indian performer followed~ · playing the Sitar and dancing, thus bringing a note of magical India into the hearts of all. The clothes of Frivolous, another -boutique also located ·in Saratoga, were modeled, musically accompanied by VivaldF s Four Seasons. A Korean performer then played a facinating native instrument .. More . fashions by Krizia, Ungaro and Missoni (clothes kindly provided by Joseph Iaia) and Bea Covert alternated with a fantastic performance by a bellydancer, a burning comedy · act by Matteo Coveri Abbondio, an . exotic dance by Guest of Honor Shahrz:ad :Maghsoudloo and a traditional fashion show which displayed various nati:ve . costumes of numerous I.S. U. members. Finally, the nigilt came to an end with a smashing performance by a Greek group. On Sunday., International Weekend ended with a splendid performance. by Amandu Banseng, a native of Gambia., who played the Kora, a unique instrument of his land. The musical notes floatiilg in the air of the Arts building brought a spirit of fascination in the hearts of all those who attended. Thus, International Weekend 1987 carrie to an end. The· United Colours of ail countries shined itl the splendor of sharing an.d exchanging of cUltures.

A Colorful and · Successful Experience By JILL TOMACK Matteo Coveri-Abbondio gets my vote as I.M.O.C. (Inter- national Man on Campus) for. . his witty and charming per- formance as M.C. of the International Festival last Saturday in Old Chapel. Eddy Remy, clad in gorgeous African costume, introduced everyone to traditional African song ami dance. AUdience participation was at its height as th~ spec- tators joined Eddy in rhythmic African chants. Brooke Hoberman made a stellar performance as Eddy's (volunteer) dance partner. Four \Union College beauties\ Kenya LeNoir, Leslie Orner, Erika Rauscher and Arlene Silverio, modeled modern European fashions avec elegance. During a rather dull portion of the evening, when an Indian woman played the sitar and a Korean woman played a traditional Korean instrument, the audience passed the_time by ~ampHng some. d~ious in- ternational delicacies. The crowd was reawakened by the gyrations of a dynamic belly dancer. Yet more fashions followed as the Union College models showed off an original Italian. designer collection of \clown. wear.\ A former Upion Gollege student gave a surprise performance with a lively Iranian dance that had the audience clapping and dancing in the aisles. The highlight of the evening was Matteo Coveri- Abbondio's comedy act. The delightf\il M.C. charmed the audience with his humorous rendition of the trials and tribulations of being an Italian student ill an American school. The audience was then treated to two songs . in Creole and French, which were done beautifully without ac- companiment. Exotic traditional costumes from such places as India, Iran, Spain, Japan and Th~iland were modeled by some more Union students. The Iranian costume modeled by \Kate\ was espedally eye~catching. A rather dramatic glass-br~aking Greek dance was the evening's grand finale. The audience was forced to move back out of the way as plates and glasses were shattered right and left. Even though the show seemed poorly organized, the members of the International Student Union should be congratulated for their efforts in bringing cultural awareness to the campus.

You find yourself making mental notes. of all your friends' \Spring Fling\ weekends, deciding which campus has the best bands playing for the prime party atmosphere. Preference, of course, goes to schools within a two to four hour drive so the gas and toll ex~ penses don't reach huge proportions. Even if you want to go the greater distance, it's not too difficult this year. You can easily gc 'to faraway colleges in either D.C. or Philadelphia, since US Air will take you there for $5R or $68 round trip departing from Albany. Some argue that planning a good roadtrip can be just as much ftill as the trip itself. The strategy tends to revolve .around just how late Thursday afternoon you'll be leaving along with how early Monday morning you can arrive back in time for class. (It seems that Friday classes lost all significance by the time Spring Term rolls around.) Then again, the lack of planning is an equally valid approach. It usually takes the form of something like, \Hey want to head to Boston?\ around dinner hour on Friday. Half an hour later, there's five of you in the car and you're heading for the Mass. Pike. Road trip essentials are but a few crucial items. Most im- portant is the selection of tapes Psychology Dept.

Mora,lity By KA.VEHSHEIB:I\NI The manner with which we conduct ourselves is based on a set of moral precepts. However, we rarely stop to question the validity of these precepts, their inferences and their founding principles. One philosopher wh() .propounded these questions; and Who is one of the greatest contributors to the issue of morality is the nineteenth century German philosopher, Jmmarmal Kant. · ·. In his treatis¢, Foundation of the Metaphysies ·Of Morals, Kant crit.ici:z;es our present moral system, ~d he discusses the. implications of ,having moral codes, and the.:·elements that niust ~xist fof.a 'inoral.lavv . to be accepted as such. His ;conclusions are too noble and romantic, and his e~p.ectations too high. However, his crl,ticism raises many important matters regarding both our method of fipding moral laws and our treatment .of them.• The most basic implication of accepting that moral codes do exist, by which we are thereby judged, is that humans are free, or autonomous. One might ask free from what? Kant's answer iS that we are in some ways free from nature. We are a sort of divine mortal beings. In con- trast animals; trees, and plants are completely bound to nature and act only out of instinct. It is therefore the concept of our freedom that allows us to judge someone who has killed .another~ a murderer, and duly punish that person. On the other hand animals killing each other (and even in some instances eating their babes) are con- sidered to be acting only out of instinct (hence their action is not determined by their own will, but rather a force in nature) and are free from both ours and divine judgment. The aspect of our being that :allows us t9 exist on this higher groW1d witfr-respect to nature is reason .. It is in oilr . ability t(J reason that we find our freedom, and it is by virtue of our freedom that we have ethics. Therefore, Kant argues that not only are the foundations of morality to be found only reason, but also that they can be found in reason since morality is a rational a priori concept. One significant point arising . from this statement is that morality cannof be discerned throu:gh empirical r-easoning. Expetlence can he used as evidence to support the existence Qf a prior know.ieqge, but it cannot be used f() prove it. A simpleexe~mple is tile C()ncept of God. E:!!<!)erience can De used as evidence to support. tile idea of tbe existence of G()d, but it cannot be used to ,establish God's existence sans doute. From the fact that moral law can be · cletertn1ne~ solely thi'Oitgh reason witholit the aid of ex:petien<:e, Kant infe~s that the morat le~w should therefore be univel's:ally valid fvr all ·ratio~al 'Cl'~tures. Al~~», if they ·.are :•to ba.ve: any W(ll\thj moral 'laws · shoulil be unc'()nditional. imperative statements: \Thou . shalt not •• ,, regardless of the eXisting ~Circumstances and inceatives.\ The .sec()nd clause must be hlpUed in the com- mandor elsE the commartd is no longer a moral orte but a practical one. One can im- mediately ~ee that indeed if ·circumstan«!es and incentives are allow~d to affect a moral law (theY do in real life, but Kant is di=:;cussing art ideal), then the m()rallaw is no longer a universal one, go!id for all creatures with the capacity to reason, b11t rather a principle that can only be applied to beings that can be and are in those mitigating cir- cumstance&. Also, m'()raJ laws become c<Jrnditional statements dependent Oil external factors. The significance of these facts is· that both the mamer with which we have created our present Inol'al values:, and the reasons vte abide by them lose their worth. All our ethical standards aFe based on present and future circumstances and incentives: one must not steal, cheat, or murder not only because ,it b; not good, but aiso becaqse 'ODE will be Pl!Ilished.

Ca II Mari orie at x6~.64 or Cathy at x43-65 while the other is quickly forgotten. or if the mission had succeeded and the tw() soldiers had survived, then they would perhap::; both be vener-ated as heroes. The moral of the .story (pun fully intended) is that we have judged the soldiers not by their se11se of duty, but rather by the follol\-ilhg · exter-nal un- predict.aille events. Kant, therefore places moral law on very high and vulnerable grounds. According to his princlples, if I have a duty not to lie, .and I am placed in a cir- cumstance where my lie might save hllndl!eds of thoilsands of lives, I m11St still obey the moral command and tell the truth. ·Many Sllch. absurd e:xamples can b~ raised· 'to · cllallenge Kant's theory to see if it has any Poetry Review: .J:: - ...

To realize an ideal he has been greatly influenced I greatly enjoyed the way in which Mr. Tomlinson read from his works. He truly made me understand the difference between reading a poem and hearing a poem, since poetry is ideally meant to be heard. By placing great emphasis on rhythm, Tomlinson used his voice to convey the feeling of the poem. Listening to the poet read, it became apparent that the words themselves are only one part of the poem.

By MARJORIE HOFFER The phones have been ringing in many alumni homes as the 1987 student spring phoneathon completed their drive last Thursday. This year, the focus was on re~ent graduates and the 91 student callers raised $30,456 f()r the annual fund. Because Union's tuition only covers two-thirds of the operating C()sts, the annual fund is vital i.r! order to keep tuition costs lower. Therefore, students directly benefit from the drives. UnfortWlately, this year, the participation was not at its fullest. Despite an effort to recruit clubs, fraternities, and sororities, the Hale House's capacity for sixty callers an evening was not used to full advantage. However, on the final night of the phoneathon, forty-two callers dedicated their time to the annual fund, despite the tempting outdoor weather. Naomi Mendel and Carri Scribner, (Annual Fund Directors) say that the most successhtl callers are self- confident and believe in what they are soliciting for. Students who participate in the phoneathon really do enjoy speaking with alwnni. Scribner cited some exceptional student callers. For-- example, Bill Smith, from Beta Theta Pi, not only came two nights in a row, but won all the nightly prizes awarded f!!JI\ the most money raised.

Page 10 CONCORDJENSIS, April 30, l987 Olnnrnrbirnsis F~ ol limon C~lqfe 187\! ------------ ----- Does T·enure Weaken Teaching? Union has long had the reputation of a \teaching\ college, a place where teachers' concern for students and the craft of teaching was foremost. That's why many ofus came here. In general, the quality of teachers here live up to that reputation. We all know, however, that there are exceptions to that rule. There are professors who lack the enthusiasm necessary to be effective; there are professors who care more for research and writing than teaching; there are teachers who do not prepare for their classes and ramble off on random tangents; and anyone reading this can think of other reasons and fit names to such examples. The article on page one outlines the tenure process. On paper, the system looks fine, bat nothing is ever as ef- fective in reality as it is on paper. Technically, by the time a professor reaches the final review for tenure, only the strongest candidates remain. However, after that point the \quality control\ virtually disappears, thereby allowing a teacher to slip into complacency at precisely the time problems may begin. One professor recently said that after a number of years teaching, dissatisfaction and boredom would be more likely to creep in. Another added that professors, in an effort to boost or maintain prestige, will put more time into researching or writing in their specialities rather than into teaching. For whatever the cause, at least a few tenured professors have let their teaching degenerate. Ac- cording to Professor Ludwig, chair of the Faculty Review Board, any correction depends on the efforts of the department chairman, through an \appeal to the persons' professional pride,\ through the leverage of assigning courses, and through merit pay. However, it can be seen that those measures might be ineffective in many cases, and one can imagine how difficult it would be for a department chairman to discipline a colleague of several years. What can be done about the siutation? Union should re- examine exactly what it values in a teacher. If it truly values quality .of teaching, the College shouldhave a way to make certain that anyone teaching in a classroom actually belongs there and deserves to be there. The College should be able to certify the quality and, if it finds a professor lacking, be able to remove him from a teaching position. In short, the idea of lifetime tenure should be scrapped in favor. ()f a system of periodic reviews ofeach professor, even after the sixth year. The teachers that did not meet a reasonable standard, the same standar-d used at the three and-six year level, would be given a year to revise their work pending another reviw. If the sheer logistics are too much, one could review only the teachers not meeting a certain level on evaluations already conducted each term. This idea may sound radical and offensive, and perhaps we would have avoided such a statement, but the idea isn't all that unusual-two professors, when asked about the idea, said that lifetime tenure was at the heart of the problem and that Union would be better off without it. Change, ho~ever, ean only come through tenured faculty. Concordiensis does not believe it has all the answers;. it is our place, however, to point out problems and offer possible solutions. This time, the idea is not entirely our own. Doubtless, the mechanics are by no means ideal, but the concept itself has merit. We would appreciate further consideration and comments. Cheating Ourselves Let's face it, cheating goes ()flat the College. We have your basic write it c;>n the hand, read it off your neighbor, get it from the files, and the classic group effort on exams (not to mention direct transfer of homework and labs). In an ideal system none of this would exist, but there is no such animal. Why would anyone put out thousands of dollars to educate themselves then turn around and avoid learning by counting on others to do their work? As they say \those who cheat are cheating themselves.\ Unfortunately not everyone sees it that way. It doesn't help the situation any when temptation is increased by professors who walk out during exams or give out make_- up exams that are identical to the originals. Professors should monitor such exams more carefully. The College Administration could also improve the situation by producing a more decisive academic honesty plan. Punishments should be outlined and regularly enforced. Preventative medicine is the best: students should be made aware of the consequences of cheating before they decide to take the chance. Exams and papers should be monitored more carefully. Although the College has begun an examination of academic honesty policies, they have presently moved it to the back burner to work on \more pressing issues.\ Isn't academic honesty a pressing issue? COMMENTARIES ·Professors Size Up Oasses By JAYM. GROSSMAN With more than the necessary amo\.Ult of commotion: about spring term registration, I thought it woUld be a good idea to take a look at some of the classes with larger than normal enrollments. The ever- informative registrar, Dwight Wolf, filled me in on the num- bers: 93 students in Professor Berk's Holocaust class; 92 students in Professors Hansen and Wells' History 10 class; 77 students in Professor To her's Classics 23; and 85 students in Classical Mythology taught by Professor Sorum. · There were several different reasons for these abnormally sized classes: 1) some professors don't mind teaching large courses 2) some professors . ailowed several students to enroll above the original class size limit 3) more classes were scheduled this past fall leaving many students to enroll in less classes this term. The professors in these classes had some interesting conrrnents to make about their larger classes. Professor Berk, who normally_ teaches large lecture-type classes, said ''It's fine_ with me. I have no dif- ficulty teacl:iing lecture C()urses. I enjoy it. I don't get the stimulation from smaller c;lasses that I do from larger ones.\ Hoever,. Berk did state that larger courses present some grading problems. \I can't put my colllllients on each paper.\ He also suggested that not as much careful attention as he would like goes into each paper. Professor Sorwn made some eloquent comments about her 85-student Classical Mytllology class. Sorum said that she would like to teach it as a 30-40 student course and that by teaching it to more students changes the nature ()f the course. She said that it can be taught ·effectively at the 50-60 range, but that she ch()se to raise enrollments. Sonun stated that the six course load reduction has not affected enrollments as much as students have said it has. Again, Sorwn felt that there were problems with grading and that it was very hard to assig11 term papers. Professor Toher was in- triguedbytlle fact that the four largest classes were in the ,Social Sciences. Toher said that the numbers ,., certainly changes ·bow you teach the course.\ He also said that he can't give out term. paper assignmEnts any more and now schedules two ·one~hour exams plus a final.exam. He added that a clasS: of this size at a university would have ad- ditional smaller sections with teaching assistants to answer questions. ''The absence ·of the te1lin paper hurts the class, but the_ large class- size doesn't prohibit good education. What seems to be the reasons from these prafessors who teach large ·classes are 1) grading is more difficult, especially the assignment of terrt1 papeL\s 2) the interaction between shtdel)ts is linllted 3) some additjonal help with grading and extra help would be ilnm.ensely helpful.

The discussion was an eye- opening experience for those students who attended, in- cluding ourselves. Maureen DeBlasio and Lorraine Troja~ discussed the brQad variety of problems facing many pregnant women. DeBlasio told' many anecdotes about her ex- periences in: helping ~pregnant women, many of whom were young and unmarried . and in serious financial difficulty. Seh eJrplained that Birthright provides economic b.elp for these women, and also works· with state agencies to .help women receive government ald such as welfare, Medicaid, and 'WIC (a food assistance program for women and their children) .. But other kinds of problems also face the women they co\Ulsel, and the speakers gave us an informative look at some of these situations. Some women face social problems such as boyfriends who refuse to accept artY responsibility or provide any fotm of help. DeBlasio .stated that some teenage mothers receive poor nutrition and are ''living off of pizza and coke\ when they walk in Birthright's door. Some women have only had poor role models in their own homes and have little concept -of even the basics of motherhood; a problem Which· the Birthright counselors said requires a lot of time ·and patient work to remedy .. This type of long-term · counseling is not provided by the governtnent, and the Bir- thright counselors themselves have 'had to make this com- mitment. The speakers said that some of the women Birthright counsels are in harmful relationships with guys who refuse to help them, and that many girls remain emotionally dependent on guys who are irresponsible.. Birthright workers devote a great deal of time to counseling young mothers about their relation- ships, teaching them how to hreastfeed, helping them to deal With .their parents· and families, and arranging for free medical care to be provided by local · doctors who support Bir- thright's work. Long after the baby is born, . Birthright con- tinues to try to help women with the long-term problems which have led to their situation, which involve economic problems and a lot of social factors like . personal relationships and _home life. Birthright also helps women to place their children for adopt(on after they are born, if that is what the woman decided to do. 'Oley affer other· services, in- cluding free pregnancy tests and Lamaze classes. Although most of the people they assist are Schenectady residents, Birthright in Schenectady· also offers to help Union College women. We want to thank the speakers for presenting such a fun account of all the kinds of programs ·they have to assist w~men with problem pregnancies. Many women have abortions because they see · no· 'other solution. We feel that society must reaCh out to help W()men whose pregnancies have created ~erious problems. As individuals and as a com- mil!lity, it is our responsibility to provide women with positive alternatives to abortion, and this includes financial help along with emotional support and counseling programs like Birthright's. As member of the Pr10-Life Forum, the student gro11p which sponsored last 'fuursday's event; we ·invited Biltbright to come speak . on c8Jl1pus because we see Bir- thr'ight as filling a real need: for women to have other choices besides abortio11. It takes a great deal of bard work and serious commitment to help WQmen who are in financial and pel'sonal trouble. But Birthright has made that eonunitme11t to help, despite all the difficulties involved. Several Union stll!lents have volunteered to help out at Birthright in the past, and· several others ex- pressed that same interest last Thursday. If anyone would like to volunteer at Birthright for assisting with Lamaze classe& or other programs, or just wa11ts more information about Bilthright, the organization is located at 146 Barrett Street in Scltenectady.

General Educ.ation Editorial Clarified Last week, my editorial (entitled \The New Curricul urn: Determing Union's Future\) had two in- tentions: first to show how important the central curricuhun is to the College: second, to show how both General Education in its current form and the Gado Committee's alternative (as the grapevine has it) both contain ideas that, on the surface, appear sound.

Performing the songs \a capella\ she left the im- pression that she couldn't have done any better if she had musical accompaniment. Nadia truly moved the audience with her beautiful voice and left the stage to much applause. Unlike most cabarets in which the performers are students, there were several acts by non-Union people.

On accot111t of technical difficulties, the older woman had to play the sitar for a span of over 20 minutes, while waiting for her daughter's music to be found. During this time the audience grew restless and remained so while the daughter enacted a 13th century ritual dance. The evening's everits could be termed truly stylish. Each girl in the audience was given a carnation upon arrival at Old Chapel and the building was decorated with balloons and streamers. Throughout the night, a fashion show was put on, displaying modern clething from aruWid the world, as well as the traditional costumes of several countries.

Seven Bright Walkers ByJOYCYBUL On Friday, April 24, the play \Seven Bright Walkers\ was performed by the Black and Latin Alliance of students tn: Memorial Chapel at 8:00. This play was performed during winter term, and is back by popular demand. It was written by Virginia Artist, and is a ''m-oving dramat:izathn depicting the atrocities suffere<i by a race of people who Slll'· vived in spite of the odds faced.\ LeAta Jackson and Sylvia Carey directed it, while Nadine Johnson produced it. This play was very spiritual and moving. Song., dance, and dialogue were combined in such a way as to bring the true spirit of black history to the audiEnee~ The time span of the play ranged from pre-slavery days in Africa to the sixties. Major time periods depicted were the civil war, the Depression, Wo1·ld. War II, and the espeeie~lly moving rendition of the death of Martin Luther King. The dancing . and singing in the play were superb. So~gs ranged in themes from nattve African to Jazz to the Blues •. Some of, the songs were ''Bless the Child,\ ''The Answer. is Blowing in the Wind,\ \We Shall Overcome,'' and most importantly, the \Negro National Anthem,\ which was written by James Johnson. · Throughout all of history, Blaeks were treated very badly by whites. This can l;)e seen through slavery and the Jim Crow laws. But they .held together, and refused to be beaten. This was the main message conveyed through this play. Th.e \seven bright walkers\ refer to the things which all people have within them, such as love, musical talent, or skill with the hands. The \seven bright walkers\ were .the things that Blaeks always had on their Side which could not be taken away. This play represents a ·step· in. the direction of Martin Luther King's dream~for a day when all people can be equal. ~~M~~-~9•f1J~r~?;t~,~;i·;.~-~~~:~;':~i~~~,1~:::.::;x ,,,, .. :,: · .liffleeae~Uiliiif1 > col'lege;'\cor.l't.~~t:··c:~.m:·A1fttee''T:~sfl:lrf-

Yet, the viewers 1 cannot help but feel a big dose of gailt in panning the movie as such, due to the reactions pulled from them while watching it. As a movie PROJECT X is a fairly formulaic piece of film. The movie concerns a chimp named Virgil who is taken from his original trainer, Helen Hunt. Virgil winds up at an Air Force testing base where he is to be used in radiation experiments. 1 Following the predictable path of plot, Vi:rgil is befriended by Matthew Broderick, who tries to prevent the animal from being irradiated.

The movie never really takes any challces with the basic struture, and the audience is never in any real suspense while watching the film. What the audience is doing, llowever, is drying its eyes from a few highly effective moments.

Without these moments of powerful pathos, PROJECT X would be just another \cute animal\ ID()Vie, but it redeems itself to a level slightly above such fare. Matthew Broderick, the eternal boy, is convincing as the I.Ulwil:ling trainer who rescues the chimps. He works well in tandem with Helen Hunt, but her role is terribly un- derwritten.

But then she disappears, only to conveniently resurface in order to fufill the obvious ending of. the movie. For the most part, PROJECT X takes no chances in presenting its story, sticking to the routine \happy ending\ formula.

Call Nancy and Julie at 382-1007 Seven Bright Walkers ByJOYCYBUL On Friday, April24, the play \Seven Bright Walkers\ was perfonned by the Black and Latin Alliance of students in Memorial Chapel at 8: (){). This play was performed during winter term, and is back by popular demand. It was written by Virginia Artist, and is a \moving dramatization depicting the atrocities suffered by a race of people who sur- vived in spite of the odds faced.\ LeAta Jackson and Sylvia Carey directed it, while Nadine Johnson produced it. This play was very spiritual and moving. Song, dance, and dialogue were combined in such. a way as to bring the true spirit of black history to the audience. The time span of the play ranged from pre-slavery days in Africa to the sixties. Major time perioO.s depicted were the civil war, the Depression, World War II, and the especially moving rendition of the death of Martin Lllther King. The dancil1g and singing in the play were superb. Songs ranged in themes from native African to Jazz to the Blues. Some of the songs were ''Bless the Child,\ \The Answer is Blowing in the Wind,\ \We Shall Overcome,\ and most importantly, the \Negro National Anthem,\ which was written by James Johnson. Throughout all of history, Blacks were treated very badly by whites. This can be seen through slavery and the Jim Crow laws. But they held together, and refused to be beaten. This was the main message conveyed through this play. The \seven bright walkers\ refer to the things which all people have within them, such as love, musical talent, or skill with the hands. The \seven bright walkers\ were the things that Blacks always had on their side which could not be taken away. This play represents a step in the direction of Martin Luther King's dream-for a day when all people can be equal.

Page 18 .1987 ... On the Road to Henley Varsity Eight Races National Champion By DAVID JONES We dropped our boat into the Schuykill River for a practice run Saturday evening. We rowed to the starting line, twned and came down the race course at about half pressure, Tomorrow we would meet the National Champions, Temple University on ;this .same course. As we effortlessly rowed down the course, we all knew what the next day's race would tell us: where we raned nationally for Dad Vails sChCJols. The Dad Vail Regatta is held the second week in May and is considered the National Championships for non-Ivy League schools. Temple's varsity Heavyweight Eight has won this race the last four years in a row. Emotions were extremely high as we headed towards the starting line. We could see both Temple's Varsity A and Varsity B boats warm-up as we warmed-ip before the starting line. We were going to row the race .of our lives in a couole of official started. the ~ommands. Something . was wrong! CoJ! .. swain Joe Murphy bEgan to yell at the official and wave his hands but to no avail the race had started. TllYee .. quarter, h{llf, three-quarter, then a full str()ke and we knew something was Wf()ng now, as Joe violently steered to the starooard. J()e _ canedthe boat to'stop, but again to no avail as we rammed a small wooden '.stake' boat with our port-side oars.. The damage: a broken oar, a shattered oarlock and eight frustrated oarsmen. We headed in. Rowing now with a borrowed oar and new oarlock, we pulled back to the starting line. The official was no'W aware of the stake boats and correctly positioned 1lS away from them. A stiff wind and moderate chop were indicatiolls of a fast race as we once again aligned for a start. \READY ALL .•. ROW\ were the starter's commands andwewereoff. All three crews were even. ''SiJt .. seven-eight- lOOO.meter paint we were still in the thick ·of things, but something was wrong .. We were having trouble .recovering ~ver the choppy water and we were fallin.g back. \Last 500 \.Bring it up for the sprint,.'' were Joe's words as the stroke rating eame up and we entered the final stage of our race. Temple ;vas clearly pulli!lg away at this point and it seemed out of our · · control to colT'ect our strok~. At the finish line, the times proved the !iiscl\eJlancy; we were fourteen seconds back ·on tlleir first boat. We finished in a time of 5:49 and the National Champions bad a time of 5:35. We had lost otll\ first race since · tbe Spring of '86. Although ~' race was lost, we gained tremendously from the trip to Philadelphia. We had the best pre-race meal of our lives at Annemarie Loftus' llDuse · outside Philadelphia the night before. We hadn't rowed the race of our lives, but we do know where we stand on a national scal.e. The race also produced a list of im- provements for us to wo:rk on · before the Dad Vails in -two weeks. We will see Temple again, in tWD weeks, in the finals of tile championship race on the very same race course and the elutcome will be dif- ferent the second time al.\'ound. Rugby ...

Page 18 CONCORDIENSJS, April 30, 1987 ... On the Road to Henley Varsity Eight Races National Champion By DAVID JONES We dropped our boat into the Sch'lYkill River for a practice run Saturday evening. We rowed to the starting line, tuined and came down the race course at about half pressure. Tomorrow we would meet the National Champions, Temple University on this same course. As we effortlessly rowed down the course, we all knew what the next day's race would tell us: where we raned nationally for Dad Vails schools. The Dad Vail Regatta is held the second week in May and is coH.sidered the National Championships for non-Ivy League schools. Temple's varsity Heavyweight Eight has won this race the last four years in a row. Emotions were extremely high as we headed towards the starting line. We ceuld see both Temple's Varsity A and Varsity B boats warm-up as we warmed-ip before the starting line. We were going to row the race of our lives in a couole of official started the commands. Semething was wrong! Cox- swain Joe Murphy began to yell at the official and wave his hands but te ne avail the race had started. Three-quarter, half, three-quaxter, then a full stroke and we knew something was wrong now, as Joe violently steered. to the starboard. Joe called the boat to stop, but again to no avail as we rammed a small wooden 'stake' boat with our port-side oars. The damage: a broken oar, a shattered oarlock and eight frustrated oarsmen. We headed in. Ro'WiRg now with a borrowed oar and new oarlock, we pulled back to the starting line. The official was now aware of the stake boats and correctly positiened us away from them. A stiff wind and moderate chop were indications of a fast race as we once again aligned for a start. \READY ALL ... ROW\ were the starter's commands and vve were off. All three crews were even. \Six-seven-eight- l!OOG-meter point we were still in the thi:ck of things, but something was wrong. We were having trouble .recovering over the choppy water a11.d we were falling back. \Last 500 ... Bring it up for the sprint,\ were Joe's words as the stroke rating came up and we entered the final stage of our race. Temple was clearly pulling away at this point and it seemed out of our control to correct our stroke. At the finish line, the times proved the discrepancy; we were fourteen seconds back on their first boat. We finished in a time of 5:49 and the National Champions had a time of 5:35. We had lost our first race since the Spring of '86. Although a race was lost, we gained tremendously from the trip to Philadelphia. We had the best pre-race meal of our lives at Annemarie Loftus' house outside Philadelphia the night before. We hadn't rowed the race of our lives, but we do know where we stand on a national scale. The race also produced a list of im- provements for us to work on before the Dad Vails in two weeks. We will see Temple again, in two weeks, in the finals of the championship race on the very same race course and the outcome will be dif- ferent the second time around. <!tnnrnrbiensis SPORTS Rugby • Continued from page 20 The serum didn't seem together as a team.\ He added that he felt that exhaustion had a lot to do with the loss. • 'Four games in two days is tiring. I don't think they have a better team than us.\ The final score was 12-6. Union's one try came near the end of the game. The baU seemed to touch about 10 of Union's players on the way into the try zone. It ended up in Albrecht's hands as he powered his way toward the goal. He was stopped by three SUNY ruggers, but dished a blind- behind-the-back pass directly into the hands of Dave Morrison, who ran in his first career try from about 10 meters out. \I didn't plan on passing the ball,\ Albrecht confessed. \I thought I could get by, but I started stumbling. I knew he (Dave) was behind me. So, I thought I'd put the ball on my hip and it just popped into his hands.\ However, UHion couldn't muster up any more points and fell to the SUNY team, 12-6. Although Union is losing many great seniors to graduation, the team seems optimistic for next year. The Union Huns received a plaque for sportsmanship this year, and hope to win the cham- pionship next year. Union Killer B's were un- fortunately not as successful as • • the A side was.

' CONCORJJIENS1S_~ Apri~ 39, 1987 Page 19 Athlete of the Week By CHRIS HINCKLEY The recent success for the la~omen .of Union College has brought the team some much d,eserved . recognition. The ladies of Union have, for the second consecutive yeat·, been invited to the New York State Tournament. 'The individual play of many of the players has beenoutstanding, but one lady's play has stood above the rest in recent weeks.. Sophomore midfielder Courtney Lynch has played outstan!Wlg lacrosse all year and' her play in recent weeks has earned her the honor of Athlete o£ the Week. Over Courtney''s two years at Union, she has definitely made her mark on the Union College astro turf. As a freshman Courtney recorded some im· pressive stats. With a total of 35 points, 26 goals and 9 assists, she was the team's second leading scorer. This caliber of play espeCially by a freshman is Courtney Lynch impressive and to better it would be outstanding, and that is ·exactly what Courtney ·IS doing. With just three games left in the season, Courtney .had already equalled her ac- complishments of last year. In recent action against Mid- dlebury she scored four goals, but the Lady Dutchmen fell, 13 to 11 to a top-notched Mid- dlebury team. Later in the week, Hamilton visited the Union.turf.and, again, the ladies were defeated, but Courtney managed to score two goals and record one assist in the 14 to 9 loss. Ori Tuesday, in another losing effort to Oneonta, ·courtney kept up her scoring drive with two goals. Courtney's ability in lacrosse is not the only .sport that she excels in. She has also been a varsity ·field hockey player for the last two years. She has started for the team for two years and as a freshman she was named to the NYS All- Tournament Team. Courtney hails £rom Pelham, NY, where she played lacrosse and field ·. bockey for Pelham High School, and in both sports, she received All-County honors. Congratulations again to •Courtney Lynch and good luck to her and the ladies lacrosse team in the rest of their season and the state tournament. .• . 'Defeat Hamilton - Laxmen Win Over- Tin1e Thriller By LACROSSE TEAM The Union College Men's Lacrosse team continued its roller-coaster. season by splitting two to\Ugh games last week. After taking another step toward maintaining the Capital District Cup by defeating Siena, 10-7, early last week. The Dutchemn weat into a game against a tough Williams squad to try to set a winning streak in motion. Williams, who had dominated the laxmen in their meeting iast year, came to Union looking for an . early victory. Although Union dropped the game, it certainly was not a blowout! Williams opened up the scoring early in the first quarter. However, the Dut- chmen, hungry for a win, struck back to tie the score one-ail by the end of the quarter. The rest of the game, while a tough close battle, did not go as well for the Union Dutchmen. They were outscored 1..() and 3-2 in the next two quarters,. respectively. However, trailing bY two goals in the fourth quarter, Union came back to tie the game at six goals apiece, midway through the fourth quarter. Despite their tough play, Union was unable to clear the ball from their defensive zone late in the fourth quarter, and WWiams pumped in a goal to go ahead for good, 7- 6. lijghlights for the Dutchmen on defense were attackmen Tony DeRin and Phil Horn with two goals apiece. Midfielders Dave DeBaradinis and Pete Cotier also pumped in a goai each. Andrew Ross, Len LaMonica.and Blake Henderson all contributed with assists. On defense, goalie John Thorne had an outstanding game with 17 tough saves. Aiding Thorny with a tenacious defense was Mark Leyton, who had a bonecrushing hit at midfield, the always tough and consistent play of Greg Leahey, Gary Cornick., Chuck Weber, and feshman and groundball expert Steve Garnett. Despite this tough. loss, the Laxmen boWlced back in a big way in front of a good crowd this Saturday against a strong Hamilton team. 'fhe laxmen, who took a $·2 lead into halftime, saw their lead slip away as Hamilton scored five consecutive goals·in the third quarter. Nonetheless, the Dutchmen were not about to roll over. Coming back with six ,goals to Hamilton's two, the Union team put the game into overtime as Andrew Ross, scored with only seven seconds remaining. Then, with minutes left in the sudden death overtime, sophomore middle DeBaradinis put one in to give the laxmen a spectacular 10-9 overtime victory. Playing well for the · Dutm Chinen on attack was Horn with three goals, Darin with two and Len LaMonica with five assists. Also helping out was junior Andy Albert. At midfield, Ross had two goals and one assist. DeBo bad a g()al, as did Blake Henderson and freshman Nick Baratoff. Also .playing strong games were Mike Vicellin, Pete Agricula, Pete Cotier and Chris Ramsay. On defenset John Thorne had an outstanding 25 saves and a fantastic .735 save percentage. Also having strong games were Cornick, · Leahey, Weber, Garnett and Leyton. Over the past few weeks l have concentrated my efforts on major .professional sports of various kinds. However, this week I have decided I will ex- plore in depth the games that we here at Union College play. No, baseball, lacrosse, and track will not be on the agenda. , The games that I am talking about take place. in West, Silliman Hall, the Gym and a variety of other locations around the campus. To begin with, how many of you have played the \West Time Trial Game\. Contestants are required to go to West on any weekday between the hours of 12:15 and 12:45 for lunch. The requirements are simple. Wait on the shortest line and then find something that looks good enough to eat. If you're still in the race after this point you then must get drinks and . napkins, all while carrying your tray. If you manage to get back to your seat without any spillage, you may enter ,your time into the contest. Just so you can pace yourself, the record time for this task is 7 hours. The present record holder gives a bit of insight on how he did it. \I would have cut my time in half if I didn't try to . find something good to eat.\ The next event is less como plex. Stand outside the main entrance of Alumni Gym and try to guess which of the doors is unlocked. Sounds easy huh? If 0 , .. 0 -- -· . -- . . -- NOT IN THE BOX SCORE Marie Zimmerman you said \yes\ you obviously haven't been to the gym recently. The reCDrd holder achieved entry in three tries From here we move tl Silliman Hall for th• registration race. This even takes on sev-eral differen' aspects .. First, contestants an· required to partake in marathon stailding. When that phase of the co~ petition is over. entrants are reqllired to choose three courses, all of which are interesting and can easily be managed into one's schedule. For those of you who have withheld from entering the first two contests, this is the one for you. As of 1987, there have been no successful finishers. In the event that someone does suc- cessfully all of the phases at Silliman, it has been rumored that their i.d. number will be retired and tney will be given their diploma 011 the spot. The final (!Ompetition is similar to roulette. One must guess how many rainy days there will be in the month. Guesses sbOIUcl range from 15- 31. The winning guess for the month of April .was 25. As you can see, Union College is one of ,the foremost athletically orientated colleges in the world. Feel free to engage in any of the aoove mentioned contests, but don't expect to win. The odds are heaviJY against you. · -------........-- _____ ......... ______ __,.._...._ _______________ 0. . >··,,:,;,.;;<'; .. ,,;. ···\ ..

Leonard continued her fine season with a third in the 309() meters (12:03) against tough competition. Freshman Beth Jewett picked up Union's other points with a tQird in the discus (31.25 meters) and a fourth in the shot put (9.02 meters). The track teams kept up their busy schedules over the weeken<{. Both the men's and women's track teams traveled to tile Hartwick Invitational, and both fared well, J!.S each came home With a third place trophy. Lorie Anderson's win in the 400 .hurdles (70.4 seconds) was the only first place for the Dutchmen, but Union more than made up for this deficit in second, third, and fourth place finishes. Junior J en Lee led the women's contingent, as she captured two second place ribbons. Lee ran a strong 400 meter race {63.7 seconds), ~d then came back to anchor the 800 medley relay team of Sherry Cargile, Shirley Cagle, and Anderson to a time of 2:00.7 seconds. Also, not to be overlooked was Julie Halpern, who finished fourth in the 100 meters (13.4), but who also broke her own school record in the 200 meters in finishing fourth in that event (27.4 secon(is).' On the men's side, Union was led by strong per- formances from Jim LeBron and Steve Hayes. LeBrou ran a personal best of 4:10 to take fourth in the 1~0 meters, while Hayes sprinted a quick 11.4 in the 100 meter dash to take third. Also running well for the Dutch- men were Dave DeFilippo, who was fifth in the 1500 in 4:17, sophomore Wayne Korary, who cruised to a 2: 03 in the 800 meters, and freshman Jim Campoli, who walked 5000 Varsity Letter Winners • Please pick up your complimen1ary tickets at Alum·ni Gym by May 1 meters in 24:56 to take third in that event. In the field events, freshman Terry Rathwell and J en Dilorio picked up second places in the men's and women's javelin, respectively. Rathwell un- corked a throw of 181 feet, his best of the year, while .Dilorio tossed it 117 feet. Dilorio added another second place in the discus, where she qualified for the state meet with a throw of 102% feet. Freshman Chip Silver added third places in the high jump (6 feet, 1 inch} and the triple jump ( 41 feet, 6 in- ches). Union's freshmen \big three\ weight contingent of Cl:lris Stonionis, Chris Hamilton and Mike Sirowich, rounded out the·scoring for the Dutchmen as they took fourth through sixth, places in the hammer throw. · Sitowich also contributed a fifth place in the discus throw { 117 feet). Also last weekend, Coach Russ Ebbets t()()k two of his top athletes to thE prestigious Dartmouth Invitational in Hanover, New Hampshire. Seniors Rob M()hlar and Mike Reed again sbowed th~i\ ~bility to compete mtll D1v:ts1on I runners as they fared quite well in their respective events.

This even takes on several differen aspects. First, contestants an required to partake ii: marathon standing. When tha; phase of the competition is over, entrants are required to choose three courses, all of which are interesting and can easily be managed into one's schedule. For those of you who have withheld from entering the first two contests, this is the one for you. As of 1987, there have been no successful finishers. In the event that someone does suc- cessfully all of the phases at Silliman, it has been rumored that their i.d. number will be retired and they will be given their diploma on the spot. The final competition is similar to roulette. One must guess how many rainy days there will be in the month. Guesses should range from 15- 31. The winning guess for the month of April was 25. By LACROSSE TEAM The Union College Men's Lacrosse team continued its roller-coaster season by splitting two tough games last week. After taking another step toward maintaining the Capital District Cup by defeating Siena, 10-7, early last week. The Dutchemn went into a game against a tough Williams squad to try to set a winning streak in motion. Williams, who had dominated the laxmen in their meeting last year, came to Union looking for an early victory. Although Union dropped the game, it certainly was not a blowout! Williams opened up the scoring early in the first quarter. However, the Dut- chmen, hungry for a win, struck back to tie the score one-ali by the end of the quarter. The rest of the game, while a tough close battle, did not go as well for the Union Dutchmen. They were outscored 1-0 and 3-2 in the next two quarters, respectively. However, trailing by two goals in the fourth quarter, Union came back to tie the game at six goals apiece, midway through the fourth quarter. Despite their tough play, Union was unable to clear the ball from their defensive zone late in the fourth quarter, and WUliarns pumped in a goal to go ahead for good, 7- 6. Highlights for the Dutchmen on defense were attackmen Tony DeRin and Phil Horn with two goals apiece. Midfielders Dave DeBaradinis and Pete Cotier also pumped in a goal each. Andrew Ross, Len LaMonica and Blake Henderson all contributed with assists. On defense, goalie John Thorne had an outstanding game with 17 tough saves. Aiding Thorny with a tenacious defense was Mark Leyton, who had a bonecrushing hit at midfield, the always tough and consistent play of Greg Leahey, Gary Cornick, Chuck Weber, and feshrnan and groundball expert Steve Garnett. Despite this tough loss, the Laxmen bounced back in a big way in front of a good crowd this Saturday against a strong Hamilton team. The laxmen, who took a 3-2 lead into halftime, saw their lead slip away as Hamilton scored five consecutive goals in the third quarter. Nonetheless, the Dutchmen were not about to roll over. Coming back with six goals to Hamilton's two, the Union team put the game into overtime as Andrew Ross scored with only seven seconds remaining. Then, with minutes left in the sudden death overtime, sophomore middle DeBaradinis put one in to give the laxmen a spectacular 10-9 overtime victory. The nex:t event is less com- plex. Stand outside the main entrance of Alumni Gym and try to guess which of the doors is unlocked. Sotmds easy huh? If Playing well for the Dut- chmen on attack was Horn with three goals, Darin with two and Len LaMonica with five assists. Also helping out was junior Andy Albert.

By TRACK TEAM The Union College women's track team concluded its dual meet season in a respectiable fashion last Tuesday at Albany State. Led by Jen Diiorio's win ill the Javelin and another school record by Jen Lee, the Lady Dutchmen finished third in their meet, close behind winner Albany State and second place Binghamton, but ahead ()f RPI. Dilorio's toss of 36.2 meters (about 118 feet) allowed her to win by almost two meters. Lee had her best 800 meter race of the season, running 2:24.5 and narrowly missing a win. Her 880 meter time broke her own school record by nearly a second. Union's only other victory came in the mile relay, which was timed in a very fast 4:15.6, but several other athletes had outstanding meets. J:ulie Halpern ran 66.7 in the 400 meter hurdles to take second, closely followed by Lorie Anderson in 69,8 seconds. Halpern also added a leg on the winning relay team. while Anderson chipped in a second place in the triple jump. Fresh- man Clare Ginsberg-Lytle, not at her best because of a serious knee injury, still managed to qualify for the state meet in the 400 meter dash with a third place time of 64.2 seconds. Distance runners Martha Demany and Maria Leonard also fared well in their races. · Demany picked up a second place in the 5000 meters ( 22: 21), while Leonard continued her fine season with a third in the 3000 meters ( 12: 03) against tough competition. Freshman Beth Jewett picked up Union's other points with a third in the discus ( 31.25 meters) and a fourth in the sllot put (9.02 meters). The track teams kept up their busy schedules over the weekend. Both the men's and women's track teams traveled to the Hartwick Invitational, and both fared well, as each came home with a third place trophy. Lorie Anderson's win in the 400 hurdles {70.4 seconds) was the only first place for the Dutchmen, but Union more than made up for this deficit in :~~~~~;.t~~~~:3~nf~~~eW~~: Varsity Letter Winners - Please ~::;:~~~d ~~~in:=~~nd aspl:~: pick up your complimentary ~~~~~~a~(6~~r s:c!Js)7 :0~ L_t_ic_k_e_ts_a_t_A_Iu_m_n_i _G_y.;_· m __ b_y_M_a_y_1_.,/ then came back to anchor the , 800 medley relay team of Sherry Cargile, Shirley Cagle, and Anderson to a time of 2:00.7 seconds. Also, not to be overlooked was Julie Halpern, who finished fourth in the 100 meters (13.4), but who also broke her own school record in the 200 meters in finishing fourth in that event (27.4 seconds). On the men's side, Union was led by strong per- formances from Jim LeBrou and Steve Hayes. LeBrou ran a personal best of 4:10 to take fourth in the 1500 meters, while Hayes sprinted a quick 11.4 in the 100 meter dash to take third. Also running well for the Dutch- men were Dave DeFilippo, who was fifth iu the 1500 in 4 : 17, sophomore Wayne Korary, wh() cruised to a 2:03 in the 800 meters, and fresilman Jim Campoli, who walked 5000 meters in 24: 56 to take third in that event. In the field events, freshman Terry Rathwell and J en Dilorio picked up second places in the men's and women's javelin, respectively. Rathwell un- corked a throw of 181 feet, his best of the year, while Dilorio tossed it 117 feet. Diiorio added another second place in the discus, where she qualified for the state meet with a throw of 1021!2 feet. Freshman Chip Silver added third places in the high jump (6 feet, 1 inch) and the triple jwnp ( 41 feet, 6 in- ches). Union's freshmen \big three\ weight contingent of Chris Stonionis, Chris Hamilton and Mike Sirowich, rounded out the scoring for the Dutchmen as they took fourth through sixth places in the hammer throw. Sirowich also contributed a fifth place in the discus throw ( 117 feet). Also last weekend, Coach Russ Ebbets took two of his top athletes to the prestigious Dartmouth Invitational in Hanover, New Hampshire. Seniors Rob Mohlar and Mike Reed again showed their ability to compete with Division I runners as they fared quite well in their respective events, Mohlar finished a very close second in the 800 meters, which he ran in 1:54.99. Reed, in only his second steeplechase in three years, took seventh in the event, clocking 9:30.9. This weekend, the women compete in their state meet at SUNY Cortland, while the men will travel to Worcester fo1· the WPI relays, in their final tuneup before their state meet. - .....

RANDOLPH Baseball is a game where a curve is an optical illusion, a screwball can be a pitch or a person, stealing is legal and you can spit anywhere you like except in the umpire's eye or on the ball. -Jim Murray, sportswriter As the tr-apeze swings back and forth between wins, losses and rain, an investment -by Barnum and Bailey sounds possibly advantageous. But this week Unio11 College baseball defied these two famous cir- cusmen. Rich Bartosch started off the week hurlirng seven innings of scoreless baseball against Division I, Colgate. The hard- hitting bats ()f Alex Rita, one for two with a double, Dan Klinger, two for two with a double and a _l)pmerun t~Ftaling five RBI's on the day and a double by rookie pinch-hitter Chuck Hennekns put Union ahead, 11-o. With a sure lead, B!ilrtosch left the game to rest for the busy weekend which lay ahead-two doubleheaders. Union went on •o win, 11-3. The impe11ding North Adams ·~arne the next day occupied .•veryone's mind. The stinging loss only one year before remained 0on everyone's con- science. NO>rtb Adams was a 'good basebtall school'; one of 1 heir coaches had even donated seven thousand dollars to the team so that they could take a spring training trip down south. Ken Horan was sent to the mound. After one half of an inning Union was down by one run. Freshman shortstop Pat Secchiaroli came through with a one-out double to score Alex Rita and Dave Anderson. North Adams went on to strike out 15 Union batters. In the f()urth inning a controversial call put the tying run on first base. The umpire claimed that the fly ball had been 'trapped' in the out- field. Thus, the batter was safe at first base. He stole second and was kno-cked in on a single. The two teams were at odds until the sixtih inning when a Bill Butcher single drove in fim O'Leary for the winnir 6 run. Like Billy Marton or ..:e com· rnented, \Everytr~ng looks nicer when you win. The girls are prettier, th'~ cigars taste better ancl the trees are greener/' Coming of~ two confidence- booster wins, having won their last five games, Union faced Middlebury in a doubleheader at Central Park on Saturday. The sun was shining and it was Parents' Weekend at the stadiwn, but Union dropped both games to their Vermont opponents. The defense was just not there but the offense was pretty. strong. Freshmen Scott Dellorfano and Bill Brundige helped· out and pitcher Marty Hurley made eight nice plays at shortstop. On Sunday, Rich Bartosch and strong defense saved Union. Batiosch threw the first no-hitter of his career. He struck out eight St. Lawrence batters and leads Union pit- chers with a total of 33 strike- outs. He is 4-6 and has given up only four rllils all year, as his ERA plunged to 0.75. Steve Hovley, Seattle Pilots out- fielder, on<Je said to a pitcher, \a base hit is the perfect example of negative feedback.'' Bartosch deserved only praise as once again tllis year, he l1eads Union'S pitching staff. The final 5core was 5-0 after - home run of his own. Soon thereafter, though, Union fell behind 9-2, as five and a half innings finished. In doubleheaders, only seven innings· are played per game so Union's chances to regain the lead were slim. Many disap- pointed fans left the park. But writer Roger Kalm was correct, \The rhythms of the game are so similar to the patterns of American life. Periods of leisure, interrupted by bursts of frantic activity.\ The bottom of the Sixth inning can be sum- marized only as 'franic ac- tivity'. The inning began with three consecutive walks. Ken Horan sacrificed in the first run of the inning for the second out. Dan Klinger's single then scored another, followed by a two run double belted out be freshman Bill Butcher. Speedy Alex Rita ran to third base on his hard-hit shot to right field which scored one, making the score 9-5. Second baseman Andy Markopoulos came through with . a clutch single to scote Rita. Dave Anderson walked and a single by Pat Secchiaroli scored Senior Rich Bartosch delivers another ·strike en route to his first no~hitter. Alex Fita's first homer of the season, a two RBI single by Tony Amarante and a two-RBI double by Ken Horan. During intermission, between the two games, some fans asked Tony Amarante if he ever hit ones like Rita's 378-foot shot. Goodhearterlly he replied, \In batting piactice.\ Both Fate and ability smiled on him in the game that followed, as he hit a Markopoulos. Anderson stole third and managed to come home on an error, Two days in a row, reliever Scott Perhnan held opposing teams to runless innings. Walks, a stolen base and a .fieldei·'s choice kept. the remaining dedicated fans on their feet, but Perlman kept them hitless, Union's record now 8-4. The frantic activity that ensued was surpassed only U·nion Huns End Their Season On Down Note By CHIRS SHERIDAN Every year at the end of April, a strange ritual happens in Clifton Park, in Upstate New York. This ritual consists of over 60 different clubs .. teams that compete for one thing-to be established as the best rugby football club in New York State. Two years ago, this honor belonged to Union College's men'steam. Unfortunately, this year was not the year for the feat to be repeated. Union was matched up first round against the top seeded team in · the state-a bizarre occurrence considering Union, too, was in the top five. Brock- port, who won the tournament last spring, won the cham• pionshipthis past fall, e~ded up winning this yea's Upstate Tournament. . SUNY Brockport scored both . of their tries in the first half only. The first one came off of a five-meter scrummage when one of the Brockport scrwn- mers fell on the ball while it lay in the middle of the scrwn. The conversion was wide and the score was at 4-o. Soon after, another Brockport rugger made his way across the try zone for ·SUNY's second of the half. Again, the conversion was missed, and the score became 8- . 0. Union held Brockport to no tries in the second half, but couldn't manage to muster his own, and ended up short eight points at the final whistle. ''They're a quality team,\ eighth-man Jeff Albrecht said of Brockport. \We played them tough in the second half. We can play with them.\ . Tom Christianson also felt that ··Union played really well later in the game. ''We .played well in the second half. Brock- port intimidated us in the beginning.\ • In losing the first game, Union's hopes to repeat their 1985 championship went down the drain. They were forced to play in a consolation bracket- facing two more teams before th~long Saturday was over. The by Rich Bartosch's joy after his no-hitter earlier in the day. Posthtnnously, Barnum and Bailey may break into an oc- casional smile but Union baseball, centerstage, behind coaches Reynolds and cam~ pinelli, has the final one. first team they faced was Oneonta. Union had no problems defeating them as they proved with a fi,nal score &f 16.0. The \Huns\ first try came after a beautiful run by line captain Steve Konlian. Konlian dished. the ball off to Jodi Perkins who ran the ball iil, utting Union up, 6-o. The next two tries catne from Albrecht. He scored his first when he fell on aball·in the try zone after the serum pushed the Oneonta scrwn back about 20 feet. His second carne after he scoQped up the ball out of the serum and raced in strong side for six more, The final score was 16-0. The next win of the day wa!S perhaps t~e biggest for UJ?iOn of the tournament. Christianson felt that the \high point was definitely beating Siena.'' Union hadn't defeated Siena in their last few matchups. This time, however, not only did Union beat them, but did it .by an imp.ressive 16-omargin. Union's first was again scored by Perkins after the wing~forward scooped up a ball after it popped aut of the serum and ra~ed in forf&ur points. Later in the first half second-row Chris Sheridan received a pass from Perkins at the 5o-meter lin~, outr:aced a defender to the left sideline, and raced down the field to give Union some insurance before the half. In the second half Union's only try was Konlian;s who powered his way in for f;ltill more insurance-and a 16.0 lead. \I'm happy we beat Siena,\ Albrecht stressed. ''They're ranked five m the state. it was definitely the highlight of the tournament.\ Albrecht was injured for most of the fall season after being injured during Union's loss to Siena. He did regret that the rugger that injured hiln was not playing this past weekend. Union returned to Windhover Park, Clifton Park,. for the finals of the consolation rotind on SUnday to play SUNY Buf• falo. HJ was di$appointed at the Buffalo game,\ Perkins said. ''We had an even serum push, but in the second half they got tired and we fitalted pushing over them.\ Cht'istiansen felt that \we snould have won the last game. We got down on ourselves after tMY got two qUick tries. We couldn't keep up the intensity. C()ntinued on page 18
