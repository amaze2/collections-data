FR 2-3611 • • • • . . rcu op Garnet Coiored Glasses The wonders and intricacies of the op-er~tion of the Student Council and the machinations of its rnembers a-re a never-ending source of amazement to us. But .last week's meeting reached an all-time high in the delica~e financial maneuverings of some of the student body s org-anizations. The problem at ha~d 8:t this last conv~n­ tion was to whom the sponsorship of the f()l\thcommg Winter Weekend should be awarded. . . Three factions, the House Presidents .Council, the Sophomore Class, and the Campus Chest, wer:e at war for the nomination. The last of these three obVIou.sl~· lac~ed the manpower to handle the numerous adtninistratlve facets of the weekend and was forced to thro-w its balance of power to that body which would accept t~~ junc~ure, the Class of '59. This occurred when the or1pnal b1d of the Campus Chest was withdrawn by the pi'esident of the 'Sophemore class in favor of a joint one. The Student Council, in reviewing the bids b€fore it, had to decide which choice would be more li1\ely to provide the students with a well-planned and well-executed week- end of entertainment. That should have been its major, if not its only, consideration. Instead, the student body was subjected to some rather unbusinesslike arguments. The Cam:p11s Chest organization contended that it had trouble in coping with the student apathy in its fund drives and that the spon- sorship of the weekend would make this year a financial success. It was the prediction of the Sophomore presi- dent, Sheldon Smith, that the Junior Prom which his class will ).}resent in the next college year would be a losing proposition. Rather· than accept the charity of the Tax Committee to make up the difference for thE expected loss, the Sophomore class hoped to make it up itself through the joint production of the Winter Weekend, which& we assume, Mr. Smith prophesizes to be a success. In regard to these arguments, a few questions arise: is the student apathy toward the efforts of the Campus Chest to raise money a necessary conside1·2:tion of the Student Council in awarding a bid; how vali<l ]s the con- tE!ntion that the same group sponsoring two successive activities will make a profit on one to com}:)€nsate for a loss on the other; and has not the ability of' the HPC to conduct a well-run weekend been proven in the past three years by the Mardi Gras series. We do not object to the selection per se, but to the emotional and unrealistic persuasion employEd by the varying pa1ties. On the basis which the Campus Chest and Class of '59 asked for the nomination, the Student Council's choice is a natural one, fot~ ce1tainl:y they are more in need of money than the HPC which has a. problem in disposing of its surplus funds. But we do object to the fact that the Council permitted such issues as have been discussed to overshadow the practical basis fox its decis- ion: which group would do the better job? We fear the Council tends to view the world through g-arnet-colored g-lasses. The student groups on campus are independent bodies and should not foist the solution of their individual pt·oblems upon the Student Council. This year the Campus Chest has effected a drastic reorganization designed to increase. its efficiency and the Class of '59 has attempted an affair on the order of last year's Brubeck concert. Such action i.s laudaJ:>le but ultimately, to disbrt a quote, the answer hes not m the Student Council, bat in them- selves. PAC Letter to the Editor T() tlle Editor of Concordlensis: Soone years ago the campus chest was instituted as a \Panacea for all the ills of student philan- thr~py. It was thoug1ht that char- Ity after charity IW<luld no lcmger pester students with individual door to door drives·; 'instead, stud- ents could give once and give gen- erously, then forget 8/bout the charities for the rest of the year. Bwt t:he formula has failed to W()rk out. On ·OOJir'}lUS after cam- pus the c-ombined charities ap- proach, Campus Chest, has result- ed In less rather than morb stud- ent .giving. It seems that the Canipus Ohest has disintegrated lwto a wave of \a1truisti<: orgies\ wit<h a ·de-emphasis on knO'Wledge about the charities and under- standing by the student of Why he ie st.IJ}lp.orting them. These are the pr()'biems that 'fruce 1he Cam· pus Chest at Union. Tb,is year, serious thought has :been given to the prolblem of how to increase the educational con- tent of the campaign and to aug- ment the student subscrLptlon to the campus Chest. 'l'hrongh !POS- ter cama>aigns and other sources of pulbllcity, we hope to 1bring to the student body ollJil understand- ing of the. \WihY:' of Campus Chest. Av:areness is t!H 'begjnning of wisdom and as su.och the Campus Chest, 'because it olllakes the col- lege community aware of ·the needs of the peoJlle throughout the world and its responsibilityto them, is an importattt part of the learning process for .college stud- ents. Through pa.rticlp-ation in a united fund raisln.g ~rive <either by working or giving) the stud- ent does tang~ilble -wo-r!t in assum- ing his l'esponsiblllty toward his fellow man.

'l'h·e failure ,af Fleisehlma.n. to By S·tefan Steln As we walked down the steps to the Bepartment of Music's one rooon office, library and classroom in the. basement of the Chapel, we were rather surprised to see three professors as well RJ:! seventeen students working in a theory and harmony class. We managed to attract the attention of Professor Edgar Curtis, the Instructor of the course, fot· a moment. Brush- ing aside his shook of blond llalr, Ml'. Curtis took out his appoint· ment book. We realized the state of music at Union as we were put down for a few moments in the busy afternoon schedule. Reflect- ing Professor Curtis' arrlbiti()lll attitude, the music pr~gram at Union is moving forward at a tremendous pace. A pleasant accent beti:'a:IQJ this well-trained musician's Scottls'h origin. He crume to this country about fifteen years ago after llavlng reecived his education at the University of Edlrrborough, He studied the piano with Rudolf Serk!n and conducting with such outstanding men a.s Serge Kous- sevitslty, Fritz Reiner and George Szell. In spite of this impressive background, we noticed t!hat the newly a.ppo.inted Director of Music was more concerned with presenting his plans for music at Union than discussing his oWn achievements. Curtis considers the spreading of live, serious mu.sic to untraln· ed audiences one of the major challenges in his career, especially here at· Union. He ·knows that there is an untapped ·wealth of talent in the student body to help him achieve this end. The admis· slons office records show that there are at least 100 musicians on the campus with experience• \I am encourl).ged by the serious interest shown in music by the students and faculty, ·but I bope to see even .more student instru· mentalists come out into the open and arrange themselves into small groups with the thought of torm· ing an orchestra In mind.\ The need for string players is alarm- ing both on campus and off. It is Professor Curtis' earnest hope that all Instrumentalists interest- ed In participating in the music program will introduce themselves to him.

A not-too-overwhelmingly grand total of 120 Union College students have availed themselves of the oppo1·tunity to view the play in its first six showings. In contrast, 35 students from Nott Terrace have seen the production. Despite the fact that Union students do not have any financial obstacle, very few have managed to negotiate the distance between their residences and Hanna Hall for an evening's entertainment, and (dare we say) man who has three fathers, drops All in all, this was tl:te best- out of the sky, and is pursued balanced M:ountebanlt show I've by a_ ravenous female.

They have usually done a commendable if not always especially com- petent job, although there is no specific drama depart- ment at Union from which to draw upon for actors and technical manpower. The enel'gy and enthusiasm of their members have often more than compensated fo1· this lack. \Joan of Arc\ THE UNGUARDED MOMENT with Esther Williams and George Nader Steaks. Seafood and ltetlian Foods Our Specialty Their performance this term of the Shaw farce has received praise from critics both on and off campus, and more than one faculty member has placed this production among the best the ~Iountebanks have presented at Union. And yet their efforts seem to have been rewarded by one of the sparsest attendances in recent years. This surprising apathy on campus has not been evi- denced solely by the meag·er crowds at Hanna Hall. The Rathskeller, once a favorite and thriving spot at Union has been struggling through t}le term, and the imminent threat of its closing seems to have had little effect in creating more business. If and when the Rathskeller should fold, it would mean the loss of one of the few tradi- tions remaining at Union that has served a useful purpose as vv~ll as yro~ided a pleasant place to eat on campus, especially smce It seems that such eating places are all too s~rce at Union. - .

Complamts that Union has too few such ~tlVIties should not be lodged against the administration Itself, bl;lt against the continuing trend of small audiences and agam.st the general lack of interest in extracurrieular events, with the possible .exc:eption of sports, such as foot- ball, (when we have a wmnmg season).

For these scenes not only detract from the sequence of movement which comprises a film, but often dis- rupt the smooth flow of merging action through the impression one receives of the flashing upon a screen of a number of individ- ual, framed, works of art. Thus the_ idea of a film displaying It- self as art in a moving pattern becomes lOst in the profusion of perfect still shots. The plot itself is a familiar one and the- actors perform as well as they visually impress. To Dreyer's credit he portrayed the j_udges' verdict as stemming from their misunderstanding of what Joan :represented, rather than personal reasons, which would make the story less a tragedy and more a mediocre tale. Le BaJlet MecHnlque, directed by Fernand Deger in 1924, Is one of the few great- abstract · films produced in that it· achieves its effect through a moving sequence rather than a number of still pic- tures. There are no ·definite char- acters or scenes; abstract visual images arranged in relation to on.e another through contrasting rhythm, movement, and placement of line ahd form., produce a defin- ite psychological reaction though the visual level of experience. The two films make an excel- lent contrast hi the effect the motion picture can have when treated as a whole and when treated in parts, for they both are outstanding works in their own province. Although they- botb seell). to depi-ct delicate and often beautiful art, the one is merely a photographed seri;s of paint- Ings, while tbe other is a paint- Ing in itself.
