The fall golf tournament has brought to light several new . • men, and they show signs of being able to step into the shoes of those who have graduated.

Though its specific purpose IS to portray public opmwn, which function it blandly assumes, a straw vote rarely includes half of the eligible voters. It is, as a rule, susceptible to all types of falsi- fying practices,-not only by the conductors, hut also by those apparently exxhibiting a legitimate interest.

The . total deffcit for all sports was about 9500 dollars. When we consider these facts it seems apparent that the athletic authori- · ties passed up an excellent chance of preventing a recurrence of such a loss again this year. We can not see how the playing of a game m Albany m an enclosed park with better seating cap;teity and better facilities would make the game any more commercial than playing m Troy, Schenectady, or elsewhere locally.

But in our mail this morning we found .a letter about the situation. from an alumnus and we are reprinting it. The opinions of alumni must .receive consid.era.tion. The author, who must be keenly interested in his alma ma.ter, w:iites :. \I've just read with amusement the results of the S]lOrts abolitiou ballo·t in Tuesday's Concordy and have been trying to decide which is the more ridiculous, the ballot itself as priD<ted, or the results of the vote recorded from the ballpts. If, as the editorid sta.tes, the ·reception· was typical, the situation :has two rather contrasting aspects. The ignoring of the ballot as printed is hopeful and shows signs of intelligence. The V()tes as compiled in the Co:ncordy a.re hopeless and gi-ve no indica-tion of intelligence. \Poor innocent golf headed. the list of sports to be g:ujllD- tined.. Perhaps it is because golf is a successful sport at Union, and like track is to be condemned for that l'ea.son. Gulf, as a sport involves small expense, little man power; furnished recreation for its participants, and contributes ·to the .g'()QQ name of the college, yet the vote would remove it from the list. Such a vote is an indication of the inanity of -undergraduate opinion. \As was expected track in its various forms wa.s sched11led according to the ballot for almost anihilation. Of cour1;e it must be recognized that it is impossible at Union College f.or track in any of its forms to receive a.n unprejudiced considera- tion for the students, yet its most malevoTe.i\t opponents do not bring openly a single indictment against the sport. WhisJlEr· ing campaigns are not confined to presidential electons. Per- haps the opponents of the sport are afflicted with bronchitis W\hen track officials or track men are a.round for on such occ!lls:ions they_ resemble the proverbial Sphinx, but it has nevel' been: l'e- corded that a Sphinx reso1·ted to back biting. The prineipal charge against track is success. \But after all what use are ballots on stich problems a.s abolition of sports, ex:cept as opportunities for irrational 'ex- pression of doltish opinions. The committee that has bee:n a,p- pointed by ·the Athletic Board for the consideration o:f the matter may have some l'e(\son for existing.\ Are there any comments?

Dear Sir: As a citizen of Schenectady and a supporter of all Union college activi-, ties for the past 25 years, I witnessed with much pleasure the triumphal entry of that joyous and happy band of undergraduates into Proctor's · theatre last Friday e¥ening. I also, noted with great dismay the ease and rapidity with which this same group': made an unwilling, but apparently willing, exodus from the theatre.

Evidently students of the ' '' present generation have not ·the so- called college spirit that used to be prevalent throughout all universities, for the apology was immediately forthcoming.

Many are pleased because a team from Johns Hopkins is ·. ·coming to Schenectady to engage with one from Union. Per- haps this will mark the beginning of general athletic relations with the famous Balt1more institution. Already we have on the Union faculty some sons of Hopkins and regular contests with. the Blue Jays would bring Union into the limelight enjoyed by the leading smaliJ. colleges of the country. Next to N. Y, U ., J ehns Hopkins is considered the strcmgest . s cross. country team that is facing the Garnet harriers. It will If you want a good fitting, up to the minute shoe try a pair of be the last dual meet of the season for Union and a victory over Nunn Bush Ankle FashionedB-'-the only sh.oe that can't slip the Blue Jays will give hope for a successful bid for the cham-·. fr.om your heel. pionship of the Middle Atlantics· that take place November 17. p H :I L I p G 0 U L D INTRAMURAL ATHLETICS Never before has Union gone in so deeply for jntramural athletics. The undergraduate manager, William Lehman, re- ports that over 175 are participating in the touch football games ; more than a hundred are taking part in the interfra ter- nity cross country runs.; about fifty entered the tennis tourna- ment and a slightly smaller number in the golf tpurnament; inter- class lacrosse has attracted about fifty men from the freshman. arid sophomore classes alone while the billiard tournament has nearly twenty-five contestants .seeking the championship ·of the campus~ The newspapers of the country are filled with the \athletics· for all\ policies of our leading colleges in the country. The teaching that a healthy body should house a healthy mind is - responsible :for this situation. Union can rightly claim a high place among the institutions of higher le-arning which are devel- oping the bodies as well as the minds of their undergraduates. \GREAT GOD FOOTBALL\ DEPOSED AT UNION There must be a strong influence somewhere on the campus that is numbing the primitive instinct to win that is usually found in youth. Athletic losses are viewed mor~ or less philo- sophically by the undergraduates at Union who have learned to substitute glibly \moral victory\ for the real thing. We hear a few defending a losing team with \ • . . . how the game is played .... \ and are almost convinced! by these remarks that our opponents must have some sinister method by which they are able to win from Garnet teams. Yet all of this does not explain why speeta tors left their seats in such a continuous stream as they have been doing at the football games oli Alexander field this fall. Can it be that \The Great God Football\ that John R. Tunis writes about in the current issue of Harpers has been deposed? One would hardly think that ·of all the undergraduates in the country when on.e scans the attendance records of the :football games. Yet few are enthusiastic abo'Q:t football at Union. A football game in college is a social event, according to M:r. McConn who is dean of students at Lehigh, and social events must be \successful\ if they are to cater to the socially promi- nent. Perhaps that is the explanation. The scorn or pity usually accorded a loser is not. conducive of social prominence and perhaps that is why so many Union men left the stands before the .final whistle. We do not commend their act which was disloyal to the team, but neither do we censure ~hem too 793 Albany St. ALWAYS RELIABLE Elhe WALLACE -d SCHEN·ECTAOV. N.Y ..

It is a sincere wish of many that the athletic relationship with Johns Hopkins inc:reases in scope in order that Union teams meet the Blue Jays all year round. Whatever the outcome of the meet tomorrow, Johns Hopkins will find that Union is wa,rm and hospitable to its guests. No better wi$h could be asked than that Union rivals should carry home a pleasant account of their stay on· the Union campus. ~UILDING UP TEAMS We hear the cry that the varsity! teams that are losing too often have no material from which to build winning combinations. Some there are that claim that Union, for example, does not draw the star husky athletes as·do some other colleges in Union.'s class. We will admit that Union may not enroll the human giants that are found in many other colleges because the admis- sion committee at Union judges candidates for admission not by their· physical hut by their intellectual stature. But are six footers the only kind of men that make good teams? We think not. We have seen'too often that the big heavy men are the ones who pull the most \boners; during the games. Big bodies (no offense to anyone) do not often house big brains. At Union there is an elaborate organization of freshmen, and intramural athletics to help build up future varsity teams. This organization is the means by which men can be taught to take part in the various sports. If not for this preliminary training in their freshman year the candidates for varsity posi- tions during the sophomore year would either be complete novices ot too rusty in the games they played in prep schools. Coach Hal Wittner has taken over the job of the prep schools and taught the first year men the fundamentals of football, bas- ketball, and wrestling. Coach Stevens is teaching the cubs how to run cross-country. The success of the Union freshman foot- ball team this season and in seasons past, and the success of freshman lettermen on varsity teams later on, speaks well for the :system. t ' .

Hall TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, lli2~ ANOTHER PIONEER The latest innovation in college administration has been ('Ontributed by a little institution in Arkansas, Commonwealth College. The government of this college is shared equally by faculty and students who have satisfactorily completed two years of schooling in the college,-satisfactory work being de- ·fined simply as \continuous wo1·k in these lines of study selected by the student and a certain 1·easonable efficiency m chopping wood, building houses, or washing overalls.\ Decisions :cen- dcred by the faculty and students are final. The1·e are no deans to· approve or reprove their actions. In the November issue of The New Stttdent, William Cunningham points out the salient features of the college as follows: \Commonwealth conducts no endowment drives, therefore it is under no obligations to millionaires; it holds no land gran.ts, therefore it has no military training; it asks for no appropria- tions, therefore it holds no compulsory chapel to please the country parsons; it is content to operate with half a hundred students! therefore it need not offer degrees or certificates, sponso1· athletics, or encourage Greek letter organizations. \The teachers receiYe no salaries, therefore they are not hoping for increases or fearing reductions. They are not re- quired to frighten adolescents into cultural pursuits nor keep them from wickedness and idleness, therefore they keep no at- tendance rec01·ds, no1· do they conduct final examinations. They are not inquisitors, disciplina1•ians, wardens, clerks, nor 'models for the young,' therefore they have opportunity to be teachers. \Students are not sentenced by parents to ser:ve four years in the college, therefore they are free to leave whenever they feel that they are not learning something worth knowing. T'hey are not given foal' years of idleness in which to complete their J>i'e-marital experimentations; they pay for their schooling by four hours of work daily, therefore they are the sole judges of the value of what they are getting. They are not working for a letter on a sweater, two letters on a diploma, or three letters on a fraternity pin, therefore they have time to learn.\ S. V. S. origin.ality m commercial propaganda 1s apparently the stand- ard by which the material IS selected.

Two weeks ago ~•I.,et the Grecian Dream\ carried a note on Victoria Woodhull, the first female candidate for the P1·esidency of the United States. This week we find one, Emanie Sachs, de- fending that historic politician by quoting from her (Victoria's) Social Freedom Speech. These are the words that stirred her listeners back in the early seventies : \Yes I am a free lover. I have an inalienable right to love whom I may, fo:~,· as long or as short a period as I wish, to change that love every day if I please • . . I trust I am fully undei'stood, for I mean just that and nothing less.\ Ah-ha !-just the kind of girl that men forget. Didn't she steal one of Patrick Henry's morsel?- the one that goes, \Give me liberty or give me death.\ Now IS the time to shout \Beat Hamilton\ and to back that shout with a real demonstration, The last Pep Meeting will be held Friday night at Proctor's theater.

U. early in the season, the Garnet is considered out of the running this year. Teams f;r,om the Violet, Alfred, Lafayette, Manhattan, and Lehigh are considered the ones that will lead the fight for the championship this fall. But Union has never been lower than second place in the title runs since 1924 when Coach Bruce came to Union and the great development of the tea~ this year leads us to believe that the Garnet will finish \in ,__w_· _or_k_s _Ph_o_n_e_6_1_l2_· _....:. Needs the money\ Saturday. TRAINING We did not go to Rochester last Saturday but went to see how football should be played according to the standards of Carnegie Tech and Georgetown. We certainly had a revela- tion.. We did not believe such football was possible in actual practice but that sports writers merely wrote about it. What impressed us particularly was the four man line inter- ference that both teams. used so effectively, the hard clean tack- ling and never-say-di~~spilit of both teams from the openin~ whistle to the last second of play. Georgetown lost but it was the kind of defeat that left even the Georgetown rooters satisfied that the team had played great ball but that the Carnegie eleven just played a bit better with a heavier group of men. Well, many would not ca1·e how often Pnion lost if it only play~d a brand of football that left us satistied that it was football. Union does not get the men that Carnegie gets fo1· its teams, hut surely enrolls men that are comparable to those of Williams, Amherst, and other such \small\ colleges. Personally we think it resolves itself finally into a matter of tr&.ini:ng. We would soon get new professors if the majority of the students :flunked regularly in their cou.rses and did at least average work in othe:r courses.

But the usual fight that was outstanding in the Union cub gridders was missing Saturday. And the rest~.lt brought about investigation of possible causes. We are inclined to believe that the regular scrimmaging against the varsity during the week before the con:test may have had something to do with it. The advantage of pia ying against a superior te,am is offset considerably when the underdog is a. team that is used as mere :fodder for the varsity.

Doc Bruce tetls an interesting 11tory of .how •he won the Boston , marathon by climbing. over a freight train while the (:ither contestants · · \'aited for it to go 'by. The funny • pa,rt is there is no railroad crossing on the whole course over which the marathon is run. Another one al- most as good is about the time ·he : was swimming in the Boston hal\bor · .and the tide carried him out. ''Uoc'' · did not lose his head, however, for. he tnade no attempt to swim against , the tide. He merely waited until it· carried ·him in a:gain ai1d tlms he : was in the water a mere matter of 17 hours. The interesting part her,. . is that the tide changes every sil(. hours. These incidents, however, are some- what overshadowed by an occurrenr.e which he experienced while coaching at Lafayette. B-ruce hacl arranged a dual track meet to be held at. Easton against the Carlisle Indians. After some time .of holding out for an agreement on the guarantee to be given the Indians, it was :finally settled. that they should receive 8450 for their expenses. In view of this amount, which was unusually high in those days, Bruce :figured ~!le Red- skins had an extremely large squad.· On the morning of the meet Bruce met a:U the trains, but it was after- · noon before a Warrior set foc•t on the station platform.

He spoke anywhere, at anr time, to any- one and had the same me-,sag-e for all atlll' ences, 'Seek ;.·e the kingdom of God'. We still listen to the words of the Carpenter of X azareth. World Fails To Meet Test ''How do we mea,ure up to the st.andards of Christ? As nations, do we seek the ldngdom of God? ·we seek only to make the world what we get out of it. The wa,y of J rsus, as recommend:d by the sermon on the mount, has never been tried. As per- sons, we think that we are living well if we are living decently. The time will come when we will think differently. This life is a campaign in which the kingdom of God is the standard and we the bearers. V.'e must wake up; and when we are thoroughly awake. we will see that we are doing nothing toward estab- lishing the kingdom of God. \.Mallory and Irwin, the two great explorers, were examples of men who died going toward the top in an attempt to climb Mt. Everest. The inscript:on on their tomb is: \They died going toward the top.\ ·we too have our mountains to climb, and they were pointed out by Jesus in such phrases as 'Love thy neighbor as thyself' and '.Judge not others'. To climb these mountains we need every quality that it takes to climb Mt. Everebt. ----0,---- Mountebanks Present One-Act Plays Twice The date of the :\Iountehanks pro- duction has been changed to Decem- ber 12 in the high school auditorium, and at St. Agnes' school, Albany, December 15.

In any case, these libraries are not merely ade- quately, but well, stocked with the books a,nd periodicals he needs.

Further, the student reading the honor school of philosophy, poli- tics, and economics, is at present sent to a number of men in various col- leges, and this is a real advantage; . he may have some bad tutors ; but he may also count on having some very good ones. The lecturers he hears are men of real eminence; some names -D. H. Macgregor, A. D. Lindsay . (Master of Balliol), G. D. H. Cole, W. G. S. Adams, E. M. Lipson-will affirm this.

The· letter was written three days before the Hamilton game:. 'lh the Sports Editor: \The editors of The Concordiensis have for the last few· weeks been engaged in .a profoundly serious dis~;:ussion of a ques- . tion which they evidently consider crucial in determining the· future welfare of Union CoUege. 'What is that question? Has;· it anything to do with the coming change in the administration, the inauguration of a new president and the possible ·effects of that on Union's educational system? No! Is it a p;rotest, such · ~s we have been getting in many colleges of the country in recent years, against the pap-feeding methods of instruction now. prevalent, and a demand. for more freedom and initiative for students? No! \No. It has nothing to do1 with educatien at all. The eause ·of all this editorial serious thought and worry is a losing football team, and lack of enthusiastic and vociferous support <>f that team by the Student Body. The editors seem to thin:k that everything else pales before that problem, and that Unio11 College is doomed unless the situation is speedily remedied. \Come now, isn't there somethi11g radically wreng, isn't there a total lack of perspective, when the w;el'fare of an institu- tion of higher education is made dependent upon a successful football team and upon a student body football-mad? Isn't · there something wrong when a college paper, which presumably expresses the thoughts and interests of the Student Body, de- votes itself almost exclusively to bewailing the football situation,. and not at all to an expression of student opinion on the vital :problems of educational and administrative policies that are now before us? \Let us have football, by all means, and a coach, too. And let us go to football games and grow hoarse yelling.

Harris FRIDAY, NOVEMBER. 23, 1928 UNFORCED SUCCESS The success and dura ti()lJ of a campus activity is usually defined in terms of studen-t support and commercial finance. The latter factor regulates i:he degree of success which, in tm·n, secures the coveted studen-t support necessary under normal . influences for continued existence of the activity. All undertak- ings lacking either or both of these props can trac~ their inspi- I·ation and continuance to the psychology of novelty or to the persistence of an cxceptiond personality,-that is, aU except one. There may have been a time wlH?n an entire Union College student body enthused over an intercollegiate debate. And :, .Special E.xt.ra Late Final' CAMPUS GOES DRY ~-F. K.

The a1·rival of police on the ca1npus is no good omen. In fact these visits s'liould be discouraged under any circumstances, not that they· would not have .a salutary effect, but the principle is wrop.g.: If this new edict of the interfraternity .council means anything,· why not enforce it or scrap it? Perhaps some of the offenders • were so called \old grads\ who decrie the present ds.y college :youth. May we sugges,t that a ne\v varsity letter he adopted in I~eeping with the suggestions made in last week's ''Sportlight.\ Our idea is the equivalent of a \U\ in some dead language, this will have a twofold advantage. In the first place it will look intellectuail and in the second it wiU in a small way, cover. t;he shame of people in any connected with Union. No one will know what it means. Thus will both parties be pleased. This •will not be enough .so let us add a couple of goal posts: on one side, through. which will be soaring, instead of a football, an ink bottle, or a: soap eraser or some other object of scholastic attainment. On the other side of the character we could have a couple of brief cases filled with books. In order not to offend any one, one of the volumes might be the \Decameron in this • way preserving the l1armony of the whole scheme. In the middle of the U will be the coUege seal with the inscription changed to \In Vino Veritas\. It is whispered about ·the campus that the Hamilton man, '1-Yho ran foul of the Union student body immediately following th.e game, is about to be discharged from the Ellis Hospital. It is said that he was a Union man in disguise who saw an enemy fist :fl.ying for the sacred posts and with an extreme sense of duty blocked it with his jaw.

The lette.r 'by F. M. in Tuesday's ConcQrdi-· ·CnBVS has raised the ire Ot a number •Of undergraduates who have; haste:ned to write us . that F. M. is the one who has the wrong perspective abocat sport~ and its relationship to the \welfare and. . '1' t' . f . ' t '' ' c1Vt 1za wn o our cou.n ry. Certainly we did not get the :tneaning of Elrew Ari got fr.om : the letter. We reprint .our client's {a la Heywood Broun) l:et- ter elsewhere. It will convince careful readers of iihis cohmm. that Ari has got F.~ .M. ''all wrong''. F. M. just pointed out that, for an institution ·of highe:r learning, we were spending too much of eur energies in seeking ways and means. of getting; winning football te~LlllS when the 1rel'lll problem for college men:. was more concerned with the contribution Union Cellege will· m.ake to the welfare of ·mu coqntry. It may sound like heresy if the Sports Editer indgrses; F. M.'s suggestio11 that the. :money fo1· the proposed stadium (to cost about $150,00()) be used instead for \ ..•. huil.ding and· endowing of an adequate library where live students would 'spend. their time among liive books year in and year out, hour after hour, ....•. \ But we do endorse this view. Not because a stadium would only be filled \. . • four afternoons a year . . .\ but because at t:he present time the facilities for a perfect insti- tution of higher learning ate not yet sufficient enough fo,r us to sidetrack our resources into something that is not absolutely essential. Our present football stadium is rarely, if ever, com- pletely filled for any athletic contes,t.. \When we have sufficient physical equipment and well trained faculty members to take care of the higher education of the Student Body in an ample. fashion, then we can turn towards increasing our modest but substantial facilities for a~thletics. The proposed stadium is a beautiful structure to grace eur already beautiful campus, but at present, we believe, there is greater need to build up structures to house institutions which would develop the cultural .side of the undergraduates. We need but mention a few to convince: library, building fo1~ the \mental sciences\ and their respective laboraties, little theatre, provisions for lectures by noted ex- perts ....... . But we must write abaut sports ..... . We really tl1ink that Elrew .1bi, ane of our most. faithful contributors, is almost hysterical in his enthusiasm for the defense of sports in the system of higher education. Has any- one asked that sports be eliminated? F. M. me1·ely suggested, forcibly, that athletics \be given their proper place in the col- lege life. . H. K. writes us also about the same subject. He too makes the mistake of Ari in believing that F. M. wanted to cut out football. H. K. is afraid that withoat football our edu.cational system would become \half-:way\. We reprint his letter with that of Ari's. Undergraduates, alumni, and faculty, what are your comments?

THE PEP MEETING The weekly pep meeting, long regarded the c1·adle of football spirit, has apparently outlived the need for jts existence. The wave of commercialism which IS steadily forcing the amateur from college football seems to have Tobbed the pep meeting of its former significance. The rallies held a.t Union during the pa.st football season failed even to match th()se which some of us attended four years ago. These failures might be attributed to local conditions. The following comment from the :Baltimore Sun, November 23, however, dispels this supposition: \The 'pep rally' at Yale in preparation ior tomorrow's game was so poorly attended as to bring tears h Tad Jone's eyes and sulphuric language to his lips, while at Harvard the cus- tomary pre-Yale game assemblage was omittEd altogether. Last year's rally, it seems, was a fizzle which they did not want to repeat. It is a pestilence of cynicism, like the gipsy moth and the English sparrow and the chestnut blight, entering through New England to invade the country? This IS tt direful possibility\ fol' the students of today are the alumni of a little later, and it's the alumni who fill the stadiums and bowls and athletic treas- uries when the big university games are played.\ S. V. S. Yesterday marked the opemng of the annqal Y. M. C. A. budget drive on the campus. The studen-ts of Union College are being asked to contribute generously in order that the \Y\ may reach the quota which has been set at $900. 'Ve hear .considerable comment from certain members oi the Student Body as to the direction· of funds collected every year-many com- plain that too large a portion of the budget is directed to .activities off campus. After a careful check of the budget prepared f~r the coming ~ear we find that more money than ever before is being spent fo1' social affairs on the campus and about 33 per cent of the appro- priations are directed off campus. This seems like an unusually large percentage to be given over to outside iiLterests. And the· question arises, \Is it necessary to ·contrihu:te such large sums· to organizations which do not have a direct bearing on Union College functions\? the aisles !

At the ·beginning of the second half the Lambda Chi's received the hall from the kick-oft' and marched down to within the Chi Psi 8 yard line, where they could not penetrate the defense of the champions. The splendid team-work of the Chi Psi's wa;; -p1·edominant, and the cool headed, clever working Miller, Chi Psi quarterback, was noticeable. Black was, perhaps, the greatest of the Chi Psi threats on the line, for time aft~r time he sprinted through the Lambda Chi defense to tag the man carrying the ball in his tracks. Van Hoeseu ran wild around end and contributt:d a great share of the Chi Psi gains. Lippitt threw the ball like 11- bullet, and his accurate casts paved the way to victory for the pur- ple and gold team. Kolehmainen, McDowell, and De Long played brilliantly for the losers.

EARLY BASKETBALL PRACTICE We did want to say something about the late start that our basketball team makes on account of the faculty ruling prohibit- ing practice from starting before December 1. Most colleges are playing their first game by that time. Since Union gives no fina1_1cial reward to athletes~ the sports a.ttract only those who love to play the games for their own sake. These men are not too anxious to play to forget their responsibilities to their studies because failure in their curricular work means the cessa- tion of all formal play besides the great possibility o£ all formal contact with the college. By all means let us have the practice prohibition clause removed from basketball. The late start of the Union court season has forced the manager to forego the usual Christmas trip to New York where the Garnet has always drawn a capacit)' crowd at the games. Alumni and undergraduates can give the Union team greatest. support during Christmas season in New York. The swimming team is permitted to start practice before . ~- .bal,n• r,atured ,,. ~ .:.Or•• Wlut•\• ·s~andetl.Nt, lntbe World''S 1Nost Luxurious Gri:U Mlliluloctured Waothor lle.otthfut, Pleuant ..,.. ... ,,. ....

FACULTY PLEASE NOTICE Does a football team affect the studies of the school as a whole, asks Knute Rockne. \Yes he answers, \a winning team helps the scholastic standing of the whole school. When the· team is winning, the student body moves along in its studies with zip and pep, but when the team is losing the students slump in their scholastic work.\ If what the main speaker at last year's Block U dinner says is b·ue, the faculty will have to interest itself in arranging > for a more successful football season next year.
