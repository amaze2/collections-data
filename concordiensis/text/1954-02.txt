CIRCl.'LATION S1'AFF Ba.rold Patterson·, Carl :'il:lndell, Richard Shaver, Roger Harvey, It W18.S not long ago, while ·stroll- ing across the cam}>us, that I lO'oked at. the ivied walls of Union and. began to ponder a question , that ~ too long been ignor.ed- that of the pr'Oper attitude of the student toward the kn6tw-ledge he Welcome Sub-Frosh As seniors in High School, you will probab.ly be ente~ng college next Autumn. This weekend we, at Umon, would hke to give you a preview of things to come. We bust that each of you will feel the atmosphere of 159 years of .scholarship ~nd s~uden~ life at Union College for these two days, and wlll enJOY with us the many sched- uled activities. . . We hope that each of yo~ will savor this bnef tas~e ~f college life and that the next tlme you enter through Umon s gates, it will be truly \Under the Laws of Minerva.\ seeks. ·In days l9ng since past,. college students sat at the ·feet of their instr.uctors and eagerly imbioed the gospel tha;t is ltl:lo-wledge, His- tory has since .glorified these men as seekers of truth and indi:vtduais who did Il.othing but. seek the truth. Alth,ough they may have been the erudite men e>f their day, however, they were not ln:tellectual recluses who pored day and night over massive volumes. Rather; they were men who ;benefited .im- measurably from ·what they were taught, and still had time t'O lead normal lives. Why\? The reason Dear Mr. Pr~illent: ®,--~----------~----~------ t,Jnion Qollege is an institu.tJon. However, her 11 tudeb.ts love her iike a ]lumail ;being. But when •it cqmes to writing a Jetter to Union we realize that it isn't the institution w.e like but the people cormected with -it. We cannot address our lm,re letters: to the \brook that .bounds,\ or to the old \seat of stone,'' or to the admirable library building. We addrese our letters to the people· who live among those things. And since you ar~ the re- presentative ot those people 1 ad- dress this leUe1· to you. It is a sentimenta;l letter. In 1950 and 1951 I stayed' as German HELP student at the Psi Upsilon House. When I left Union :t didn't feel like a \quarter altunnus\ on·lY.· r. felt like a Union graduate. Certainly foreign students acquire such a lot of ·knowledge during two terms that they may very well considEir those two terms the most valuable ones of their whole course of studies. .. Well, what ·do I wa!lt to tell you? First of all': I like to think of 'Union Colle-ge as tny Alma Mater. Since 1951 I have been studying at the Munich Utiiversity Law School. But as yol! .know European uni- versities d,on't pay rr.uch attention to-· social life, If Union is a big family ou.r universities are big de- partment stores. You will come to like Munich or :Eleidelberg, but . you will .feel indifferent ,towards the schools. Quite often I meet . Herrn Pickl (HELP student at Union 1949-19!i0) and ~~rrn Pohl (1951-1952), both of them are con- tinuing their studies at ]l[unich University. Usually we feel kind . of horne-sick for the Union Col~ lege atmosphere of family spirit and friendship. Probably we can muoh better .appreciate the value of Union than. many a Union boy. Every once hi a while I meet Am- erican students who are -wearing maroon .and grey colors. Always they are Harvard men. But I con- tinue to ask. Maybe I'll meet one from Union sometime. During Carnival time at Munich I wore my \Union dress\ last year (shirt, freshman cap, etc.). Twice former Union graduates addressed me at those occasoions, and this year 1 again shall try to find more this way. Rotundo· Memorial Fund which has''· )Jeen launched. For two terms l w·ent to Jo Ro's Labor class. I don't kno·w whlch has been more va!I,Jable~ his know'ledie. or . his sheer personality. But I gues:> you ca.n't se'parte them. I have been as• signed to give a talk on the d~­ velopment of labor unionism in the U;S. to tl;l.e i.abor law depaxtrne:ilt of M. U. Law School. I hope Mr. Rotundo will be satisfied with it. May .I remind you ~gain that this is a .personal letter to Union Col• · lege and no term pa,per <Jr. official letter. That's why I don~t bother with giving an. outline· or trying to follow a loglc!1;l line. I got good news fr.om Union, 'I'h!tt's why :t am obliged to answer. Isn't it? I still try to make the be!!t of my stay at U:rtlon. · (I'm not sentimentat only!). There ~a~ a. great cihanee duf!ng last year's electton . ca.mpa:ign. It would be oversimplificlltio!l to say that there were two pa.rties, ~nEt lilting America and. one not li·king her. But tile situation was a!I.\IloS!i like that. In this situation It was necessary to te)l peoPle what AI!!• erica really is like. To explain to them that we are n'ot American slaves a:s they also were told. Artd moreover peop·ie had to overcome any left over warlike feelings in order ta turn to th.e Wei!lieru Ai- lies freely an4 happily. i:lbr.tig · the last two weeks of the campa,ign I traveled around and gave speeches almost everY- day, and often twice a day. So the out- come of the election for me brought some persona~ sa.tisfaction, too . It is qulte la.te, and. I have to go to sleep. I'd Jlke to hear from you, Union. I' III glad. you are mak- ing out fine, and 1 hope yo1l'li ·be doing well J:J.ext year. 'again.

Liquor f·or ~the Kittens When the Trustees of Union College approved the spirit and substance of the recently submitted Student ~iquor Pro- posal, we won a great victory. The campus has. fmally been acknowledged responsible enou~h to work out 1ts o!~ ~olu­ tion to the Liquor problem without T~ustee prohib1tio!ls. We have been recognized as one step higher toward bemg lies in their attitude towards knowledge, plain and simply. It is of little use to describe the an- cient view of learning; it is valu- able to examine our O'Wrt, however, If we intend to impr()ve it. Now, hElre, at Union College, learning ~ become- for many solely an. efi:dless race Ej.round the perimeter of the circle of. knowl- edge. Few have the . strength to leave behind the w'-orkable but valueless habit of cramming and enter the circle itself. Within is found the true spirit of learning~ not of knowledge for its own sake, but knowledge for the Sll.ke of self-improvement. Cramming, merl\i· studying to make a good grade, is a temporary panacea~fine for the .present, but valueless two as 'this may or may not be de- generacy of the view toward edu- cation. It is beyond our power to change it in the immediate fUture; all we call' do is to opei•ate as efficiently as we can tinder it. I assert violently thatftlramtniilg and the ·related vice of' procrastination are the least efficient means of dealing with frequent tests an:d heavy study loads. My former room-mate, David Pal!'ner, 1952, sent me the \.State of Union'' address and the U. C. Alumni :Review o£ Oct. 1953, t was very sorry to hear of the death of quit~ a few people I knew.

We are only too glad to Jia.ve the oppo:rtuJ)ity to re- print it here. · Union Men. The campaign now becomes a matter of us designing a set of reasonable regulations that will allow the use, but eliminate the misuse of liquor at campus functions. Most of us want it this way. A few boys seem to forget that self government is, first of all, the government of one's self, and don't want to abide by any rules.· Let's hope they will grow up in time to help rather than handicap the student body in the next battle-writing-the rules we will agree to abide by. Study Abroad The single activity on the Union campus which probably offers the finest opportunity to the student, yet receives the least publicity, is the Chaplain's Committee. . Through the years this small group consisting of faculty and student members have been selecting Union men to travel to Europe and Mexico through ~he auspices of t.he World Council of Churches, and the American F1·1ends Serv1ce Committee. This year the Committee has enlarged its pro- gram to include The Experiment in International Living. It seems almost unbelievable to us that more students do not take advantage of the benefits of international work eamp experience and foreign tour. The situation is more puzzling because of the grants given to qualified applicants who cannot finance the entire trip by themselves. This week the Committee meets in order to <Jrient those students interested in the program. M.en who have traveled abroad will supplement colored slides and photo ... graphs with anecdotes and details of their journeys. . The rneetin~ will be held on Tuesday night, February 15 at 7:30 in Silliman Hall. If at all interested you should appear. YOU ought to know this activity and its opportunities. -I. G. Who's the Coordinator weeks later. · Unfortunately, we. are victims of a. wol'Mning situation. Gra:des are necessary, ·and so are examina- tions. In the eyes ()f educators, both are· becoming l!lore necessary w.ith each year. Such a principle The student population of UiliGn falls into two gl'oups. One num· bers thoee who are here to learn; the other, thosl\i w-ho deMare they a!,'e here to lear.n, but cannot oon- ceal the fact that thllY do the least in an effort to get the most. Sln~e some members of the latter group get A.'EI, they call themselves scholars. They abuse the word; they ar.e only passmen. If they wish to improve, they must :f.ir:;;t re$.lize these three truths: that they fool none but themselves, that grades are an Inadequate measure of learning, and that they are each wasting $700 a year by being in· excusably lazy.

Guest speaker for the occasion will be Dr. Henry Wriston, President of Brown Uni- versity, where Dr. Nott himself matriculated. In commemoration of the occa- sion, the College library has set up an exhibit dealing with the life of Dr. Nott. According to Professor Helmer Webb, College Librarian, the display represents a segment of the most complete collection uf material on Dr. Nott which exists in the country today. Among the items on exhibition is the original charter of Union Col- lege, granted by the New York State Board of Regents in 1795. Near this, the oldest document in the collection, can be found the newest one, a doctoral dissertaticm on the early formative years of Dr. Nott, written by Professor Codman Hislop. Among other items are a selection of patents awarded to Dr. Nott by several American Presi- dents, among whom were Andrew Jackson, James Madison, and James· Monroe. Writings Included in Display As further evidence of the great educator's genius, the library dis- play also contains a selection of his many writing·s, including dis- courses in a wide variety of fields and sermons which he preached while Minister of the Presbyterian Church of Albany and later .as President of Union. Another un- usual item in the collection is the original record of the trustees' minutes of 1804, when Nott was named -to .the presidency, and those recorded at the time of his death si:1~ty-two years later. Rounding out the exhibit are two portraits of the Doctor. A small one, by a prominent 19th century portrait artist, Joseph Alexander Ames; is to be found in the cases . A lifesize canvas by artist Henry Inman hangs on the wall facing the entrance to the library. ----·0---- The .newly elected officers for the spring term. are Edward O'Meally, of Beta Theta Pi, who will assume the position of presidPnt, formerly held by Harold Ols?n of Sigma Phi; and Robert Tighe, of Psi Upsilon. who will succeed William Barlow of Kappa Alph& as Secretary.

But when our interest centcrs only on mur- ders in Universities, we feel that an apology of some sort is due .... We beg to point out .that it is pure- ly academic; insane, c>ven useless, but academic. \The social life of a University, centered squarely on Beer Street and not in Gin Lane, is not, you might think, a hub of money, mur- ders, morons, and nymphomania. This is probably because you are a student. You -are forgetting that some percentage . , . of our aTumrii compromises professors, lecturers, fellows, readers and lesser breeds. You, sir, find no dead bodies in the library, or ·even in the reading room \Students don't get killed.

For A Job Well Done Sound and fm·y reverberated off the Senate floor this week as the controversial Bricker Amendment was debated. The proposed amendment makes executive aO'reements as well as treaties dependent upon the two-third~ vote of the Senate,. and makes such treaties and executive aO'reements meaningless as internal law unless they are further imple- mented· by acts of Congress, or in some cases state leD\is- latUl'es.

This space, which was formerly bemg used for no valuable purpose, is now filling a place that has long been vacant at Union College. If anyone has not yet seen ,the new ping pong tables, chairs and couches which adorn the mom, we would advise him t~ do so. The freshman dormitory has always badly needed a place where men could sit, relax, and \shoot the breeze\ without disturbing those who want to study. Art's latest project fits these requirements to a T. Now that we have these facilities, let's keep them in good shape and prove to those whose time went into prepar- ing them that their efforts are appreciated. Let's not abuse the furniture and equipment the way that West College lo-unge furniture was treated several years ago. By using- the game room the way it was meant t<:> be used, we can have high hopes that Union College's first Student Union has been started. This can be the first step in building a place where we can have dates and see visitors in quiet, relaxed circum- stances. Perhaps, we can even hope that a pool table, tele- vision set, and phonograph will be added to the equipment in the future. At any rate, Jet's not forget that this is more than we have ever had before in the line of recreation facil- ities, and that all the c.redit for a job goes to Art Lawrence. -pta Activities Cuts We constantly hear gripes around the quad concerning the atrocious condition of the activities on campus.

Residential colleges for obvious rea:>ons, are the most popular. shortly, we decided to sample the opinion of the professors in Bailey Hall. !Professor Campbell - believed that our effective conduct as world leader depends on the free scope of the executivr department to deal rapidly with any sudden change of events without fear of being countermanded by Congress. Be- ing opposed to the amendment for this reason, he nevertheles thought that the roll-call section of the Knowland amendment was desir- able, but added that this statutory change in the Senate could also be effected by simple majority vote. Professor Finkelstein - has a basic distrust in the motives be- hind the amendment. He felt that it would be unfortunate to limit the executive power in a world where quick and definite decisions must be made,-especially when we already have adequate constitu- tional safeguards. He thought that the passage of the amendment would seriously weaken our posi- tion abroad, especially in Europe, where it is so necessary for gov- ernments to have the faith that we will not suddenly leave them dangling alone. Professor Schmidt-- unalterably opposed to all the amendments, ad- mired the President's stand, for he felt it involved a degree of de- cision that Mr. Eisenhower had not Th!'l·e will be' a very import- ant met>ting of the ,Junior class in Memorial Chapp} on Monday, a.t 12:00 noon ...

He em- phasized the overall function of the President in the handling of foreign affairs and thought that the Knowland Amendment was slightly ridiculous and superfluous. He did not view the battle on the Senate floor as a party struggle, but regarded the political lineup as one of those ever-shifting coal- itions.

The precedent for a move such as this has already been set, since free cuts are allotted to men on athletic trips. If another ac- tivity besides athleti~s requires a man to put in time during the class day, we believe that it is only fair to allow him the same privileges as the athletes.

In fairness to Mr. and Mrs. South, who have served the college for eighteen years, I would like to point out some facts that were not brought before the public.

But, tf one were to look around West College, he would see new dining ci:airs, electric meat cutters, millr dispensers, steam jackets for vege- table~, a new deep freeze, and a new rce cream mix, to name a few innovations.

Lawrence to the position of ' Director of Intramural Athletics. AssociatE>d with the College since his graduation from Purdue in 1934, Professor Lawrence has been a full-time member of the Athletic _ Department staff since 1935. The announcement actually represents a formalization of a service which he has rendered since he came to the College. Athletic Dir·ector Ketz said of the appointment, which is effec- , tive immediately, \It is a fitting recognition for the behind the scenes worl1 which Art has Leen doing these past twenty years.\ _ Professm· La'.vrence has been an exceptionaHy versatile figure on ··the Union scene. In addition to guiding the year-round intramural aetivities, he has served as hockey coach, coach -of freshman football and baskctbull, line• coach of varsity football, and head baseball coach. He is a:l:;o proctor of the West College freshrean dormitories and acts as , head proctor of all of the College dorms. As an undergraduate at Purdue, Lawrence played varsity center on · the 1931-1933 football squads, teams which lost only three games throughout their careers. In addition to his line coaching duties at Union, he frequently officiates at college grid contests during the fall. Professor Lawrence's new position is -one of outstanding importance , , to the College, since intramtixal activities bring sports within the grasp of the entire student body. Union's program, featuring football,' basket- ,, ball, swimming, volleyball, track, and baseball, has enjoyed widespread student participation in past years. As an additional incentive, Law- rence has, in recent years, awar:dcd a trophy to the group which tallies · the largest number of points in all of the various competitions. In accepting his appointment, the new Director of Intramural Ath- letics retains his Assistant Professorship in the athletic department and will continue In his capacity as head baseball coach. At M.

The recreation area, which will be located in the base- ment of West College, consisting of previously unused space, will be furnished to provide Union men much needed recrea- tional space, which has been at a minimum at the college. A committee had been set up. ~ · headed by Wilford Ketz, to super- vise the plans for the installation of the equipment in the two pro - posed rooms. At the present time, most of the equipment has been re- ceived and the remainder has al- ready been ordered . The plans , as disclosed, called for ping pong tables in one of the t w o rooms , with couches , coffee tables, and other furniture to provide the stu - dents a place to meet, play, and talk about the occurences of the day without the possibility of dis- turbing other men at work . The lighting to be used will be of the fluorescent type, possibly some indirect, and is expected to provide suff i cient illumination in the area . The walls, as now envi- sioned by Mr. Ketz, will p r obably be decorated by full wall murals to be painted directly upon the pres - e nt plaster support . The game room is expected to be completed within the coming month. The only reason for its present incompletness has been the late arrival of much of the ordered furniture. q;;: Thirsty?

Oosing the gap between his campus experiences and the realities of earning a living is not easy. The complicated maze of modern industrial society has made this transition a tough task. While the craflom e n of former years grew up with the ~u:;ine:;:o, the colleg e grq.Juate of today steps into a strange organization at a relatively high level. He has had no opportunity to understand, through a long period; the methods and operations of the concern.

The talk among the Class of '50 switched to jobs. Ed had taken it for granted that everybody was happy with his work. Then he found that some of his class- mates had had two or three jobs since leaving school. Others had kept the same one hut weren't satisfied. By stick- in,g with his first job and intending to make it a lifetime career, Ed suddenly discovet·ed he had a head start. After being graduated with a B.A. in Economics, he went to work for Bell Telephone Companyof Pennsylvania in . 1950. He reports he chose the Telephone Company because it seemed to offer the best chance for a career. After a year of training in which he worked in each of the departments - installing telephones, handling business contact~ with customers - Ed felt he had a 'good look at the entire company. It took n class reunion to show Ed Mahler, '50, that all first jobs are not alike. H:e tells us why. (Reading time; . 33 seconds) He was assigned to the 'Traffic Depart· m.ent, which J:tas the respo~silility for seeing that\customers' C~Jlls are handled efficiently. The job included personnel work in addition to developing better operating methods and practices. He was quickly put on his own. Now Ed has been transferred to the job of estimating the amount and type of new . equipment which -will be needed in central offices as their customers increase. Ed points out that projecting himself into the future isn't anythiDg new. That's preciselY' what he attempted to do when he chose his first-and only-job. • Ed Mahler's job is with an opet•ating com. pany of the Belt System. But there are also jobs for engineers~ at\ts and science · and business administration, graduates with Western Electric~ Sandia Corporation, and Bell Telephone Labo.ratori:es.
