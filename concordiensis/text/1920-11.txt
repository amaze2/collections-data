While the rulings do appear at first glance to be ~ bit severe and possibly savor of pre- paratory schools, it is posible that the faculty does not intend to ove1l'look attendant circumstances in administrering the law.

A WiUiam Flin.n Detective Story There was a time in college history, not so very long .ago and evidently not forgotten by some of the faculty, when students were not disciplined to the present efficient point; when they were sup- posed to realize the purpose for which they came to college without the stimulus of artificial rules. Like the average man in the outside world they were allowed to be absent from business occasionally, without being in danger of dismissal or falling into disrepute. If[ the new system. will raise the college standing; if it will make of students men better qualified to sand four-square in the world; make them self-reliant, trustworthy men of initiative-then it is indeed a meritorious system and deserves support. If on the other had it dwarfs freedom, prevents individual effort and hinders orig- inality, it is not the best means of developing a real man. But come what may it is not for students to complain or ridicule-it is for them to accept the mandates of wiser and mor-e experienced men with the imp·licit faith that it is being done for their own welfare. Let the rnuftterings cease until there is just cause for complaint.

SCHENECTADY, N.Y. ~~ ... \_ow Large is an Atom? ATOMS are so infinitesimal that to be seen under the most power- .l\'1. ful microscope one hundred million must be grouped. The atom used to be the smallest indivisible unit of matter. When the X-Rays and radium were discovered physicists found that they were dealing with smaller things than atoms-with particles they call '\elect:rons~\ Atoms are built up of electrons, just as the solar system is built u.p of sun and planets. Magnify the hydrogen atom, says Sir Oliver Lodge, to the size of a cathedral, and an electron, in comparison, will be no bigger than a bird-shot. Not much substantial progress can be made in chemical and elec~ trical industries unless the action of electrons is studie<l~ For that reason the chemists and physicists in the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company are as much concerned with th.e very con- stitution of matter as they are with the development of new inven- tions. They use the X-Ray tube as if it were a macf!ine-gun; for by- its means electrons are shot at targets in new ways so as to reveal more about the structure of matter. ' As the result of such experiments, the X-Ray tube has been greatly- improved and the vacuum tube, now so indispensable in radio com- munication, has been developed into a kind of trigger device for guid- ing electrons by radio waves. Years may thus be spent in what seems to be merely a purely- \theoretical\ hwestigation. Yet nothing; is so practical as a good theory. The whole structure of modern mechanical engineering is reared on Newton's laws of gravitation and motion-the;Odes stated in the form of immutable propositions. In the past the theories that resulted from purely s<:ientific re- search usually came from the university laboratories, w:hereupon the industries applied them. The Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company conceive it as part of their task to ex:plore the un- known in the same spirit, even though there may be D() immediate commercial goal in view. Sooner or later the world profits by such. research in pure science. Wireless communication, for example, was accomplished largely as the result of Herz's brilliant series of purely- scientific e:lCp.eriments demonstrating the existence of wireless waves.

Last Tues- day the New Yorkers defeated Trinity College by a score of 31-21). The Hamilton eleven defeated them in a very close game and the team from Columbia defeated them earlier in the season. Captain Weinheimer, who is also a star performer on the basket- ball court, is the chief item of their ·offense and a valuable man on the de- fense. Weinheimer is one of the high- · est individual point-getters of any of the players on eastern college teams. The whole N. Y. U. attack is centered around him. The Union team left the Payne gate last night at 5 :30 a!ter a rousing send- off by the student body and atived in New York at about 10 o'clock. In ~ddition to Coach Perry E.

For years the students of these two aged instihttions have 1net on _gridiron, diarnond, track, court and stage, always with the feeling oi \ntense rivalry, but above all with dean spOl·,ttnanship and genial good will. Near neighbors, witl1 similar ideals and traditioas, and growing up through the ages side by side, it is v\'l·ell that the two col- leges should meet on equal gmund as true friencrfus. . Competition, the life o£ trade, is just as much the life of institu- tions. Hamilton never visits U n::i:on, nor Union Hamilton, but that -both profit.

SMOKER CLOSES FOOTBALL YEAR College Union Plays Host to Stu~ dent Body at Annual Affair In Alumni Gymnasium \Some Smoker!\ declared every man who ;;ttencled the affair in the gymnasium last night which dosed the football season. And from the noise and mirth and ~;>ep which the event produced, it was apparent to even the casttal guest, that every stu- dent enjoyed himself and went away imbued with a spirit of renewed loyal- ty to his college. The dark days of the football season, when defeat after after defeat caused depression in col- lege and despair for the team. were forgotton. Those present thought only of the glorious victory over Hamilton and the wonderfud fight which the team put up after a season of woeful slumps. George Dailey, sporting editor of the New York World, and a promi- nent alumus, was chairman. He open- ed the meeting by declaring that the students were gathered \to pronou11ce the footba.ll season of 1920 a success.\ This brought vociferous cheering, and when he a.dded that the event was also to \show gratitude to the man who made this success possible\ the skylights on the gym roof are said to have actuatly gone up two full inches. No ear trumpets were necessary for (Contit11ued on page 4.) spheroid was advanced by a pass from Goff to Meyers for 27 yards. Then Mosher, Jones and Brucker advanced it still farther and Goff put it over by a small margin. During the third quarter, Lawler of Hamilton made a placement kick ot a:bout thirty yards after the Ham- ilton men had blocked a punt and re- covered the ball. The Union line held and Hamilton was forced to kick. Goff, Mosher, Brucker, and Jones all deserve credit for their work Goff displayed good generalship and tackl- ed hard. Mosher was an invaluable man on defense, partically. Brucker fought like a demon and made many good gains. Jones showed all his speed and ran back punts in fine. shape. Johnnie Murray and Douw Beekman did well at tackle positions after stop- ping Hamilton backs for loses. Willets, Kruse, Meyers and Welling all played good games. Freel Klein was at right guard and played well untll Smimmo replaced him late in the sec- ond half. For the Buff and Blue eleven, Cap- tain Campbell and Lawler were the out standing stars. Seaver and Clark also were potent factors in Hamilton's gaining. First Quarter Lawler kicked off for Hamilton. Brucker received on Union's 20 vard lhi.e. Brucker was downed. Bru.cker gained 15 yards.

The general concensus of opinion was that the last play, \Suppressed· Desires\ was probably the most enjoy- . ~ble of the two presented by t'he Mountebanks. As usual, domestic. troubles played a large part in the plot, and the situations which were created between Stephen Brewster, played by Burdett Gibson, '22, and B. Dalton Divine, '21, as his wif.e were amusing to the last degree. The wife· was a strict follower of psycho-ana- lysis, while Mabel,. her sister, played by Charles G. Davis, Jr., '24 was an unwiHing victim of her influence. Davis proved one of .the b€st chotce:~ in the plays so far as voice went, for which his excellent make-up it was difficult to find anything to criticize in his femininity. The entire play was a worthy conclusion to the night's entertainment. :Meals 35 Cents U:3 Nott Terra,;Ce Go·od Printing Although the work of the actors was well done throughout, a great deal of praise is due the managers an( directors for their part. Edmund Tilly, instructor in French, coached the players in the French production, while the others were under the direc- tion of John A. Holland, assisted by Kenneth Loane.
