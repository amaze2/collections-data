Harris FRIDAY, MARCH 1,1929 .. REAL STUDENT BODY :l\IEETINGS The news that the recent abolition of the regular :Monday morning Student Body meetings is not a permanent measure bears with it a distinct relief to those who have endeavored to maintain. this vestige of Union's rapidly dwindling student gev- ernment as well as to those who have regarded two broken win- dows too slight an offense for the apparent penalty of an extra chapel period. And the early prospect of a type of meeting Will il1,novations. about this coHeg!';l . never cease? ··week's choice bit is tha·t we are to have ~ncila~r golf practice. · . This intb.rmation comes to us th.rot1,gh operator No. 1632 of the · P. R. Clark D~tectke Bure:au (confidential iRvest.igations a specialty. Have yau lost anything? This bure!t\1 has recently · become connected with the Dept. of Indian Affairs). Now that ·.this pubiidty is off' our chest we'll go on with the tale. ! . HA:Roi.D ANsON BRUCE,. Director, Dept. of Physical T:raining and. Athletics and Coach of Track,. Field, and C!oss Countpy, has, as we were told, purcha,sed a net into which the golfers may drive fn>ll1 the range .of about ten .feet. This sho·rt fairway may cut distance. from so:rne of the drives hut for 'the most part it is· expected very little da.;mage wiU be done to the net, so' that come'· · spring it may :be used either for fishing or catching stray dogs·· en the campus. Lee Heath ha:s applied for the position. Another advantage is that the target is to be erected in the. wrestlir1;g r.o<:>in where some qf L~w Friederich's victims wiU no .doubt droP: into it instead.of Upoh the floor. In anticipation of this service,. we hear tell, the budget for .medical attention to participants in intramural wresHirrg ·h~s heen cut in .half. The only disadvantage to this scheme as far as we can see is that the would-be \tu.sselers\ have little choice as to how they die, either by a dub wielded by J .. or R. Beale or at the hands of solne burly lUOl'On. Pays your money and takes yo1;1r . · choice . Also some of the faculty golfers m11y take this ~hance to·' · go on with the work so ably begun at mid years and decimate· · the student body again; It has been pointed out that practice with this lay-out will s·trengthen the golfers' wrists. If they really. want to .get pow- erful your scribe has a iord which he will allow them to crank at any and all times they so desire. In spite of all this bunk Bob Beale ur~s those who have any skill at. the \Royal ~nd Ancient Garr1e\ to get tiP to the :gym when the ·net arrives (if evei-) and get il)- a little \vork :before the snoiv melts (also if ever) . Some ·one must h·a-ve stolen· the original \Sabrina.\ as the · · Amherst Boys tried to steal, harrow, beg, or bl.ly a substitute in the form of a wooden Indian, the only one extant :in these parts.

The lacrosse team played hosts to the Oxford- . Cambridge team a few yeaTs ago, while t.he basketball team. l1as played Canadian colleges, as well as the University of Mexic0, several years ago: Osaka Mainichi is not inaugurating a new policy in going on a playing tour of· the United States.

Usually it has liot taken in other countries when it has been introduced there. Perhaps it is because Japan had no firmly established. sports of her own at Near Clt 7 Hnll the time of the introduction of baseball there. Or perhaps it rei. :-4s 3 s, scheneetad 7 , N.

Schedule Arranged For Baseb~ll Practice Golf T earn Practicing Regularly in New Cage According to an announcement by Captain Bob Beale, the Garnet golf team will start outdoor practice as soon as the snow has cleared suffi- dently to permit the use of the Mo- hawk Golf Clu:b course. At present the squad is practicing daily in the new cage in the gymnasium. Although the schedule for golf has not as yet been released 1 it is prob- · able that the Garnet w'ill meet prac- tically the same opposition as last year, including Army, Amherst, Col- gate, and Hamilton. The prospects for this season are not a,s bright as in the last few years, only Captain Bob Beale and Jack Beale remaining from last year's team. It is expected, however, that a fairly strong team can be selected from those who have signified their intention of coming out, including Frank Zierer, William McEwan, Roger and Eugene Conant, and S. W. Corbin. Hamilton Honors Union On AU~Opponents Six Two Union hockey stars, Captain Bob Beale and Jack Beale, were given places on all-opponents teams· compiled by the Hamilton hockey team recently.

The aim of the competition is not to bring forth learned treatises on the higher ·education, but to obtain rec- ords of personal experiences.

How many of the ]nstructors encountered seemed to have anything genuinely valuable to impartP Was life, in general, pleasant or not?

He applied novocaine, .and then, with the aid of · two assistants, performed the major part .of the operation including the suture of the incision. PROCTOR'S.

As an army post in the Revolution, West Point's fortifications were the works that Benedict Arnold attempted to deliver into the hands of tbe British. Later the United States Military Academy was established and is now composed of magnificent buildings, parade grounds and athletic fields. It is a source of pride to the Otis organization that most of the famous buildings of the world are equipped with Otis Elevators and West Point is no exception to this rule; five 06s Elevators are installed in various buildings of the Academy.

LACROSSEMAN TAKES EDITOR TO TASK The best friend lacrosse ever has had in the undergraduate . body at Union came back to the campus lasil week a11d sought out the sports editor to give him some well-warranted rebukes for the manner in which l1e had mentioned this sport when writing about cutting sports on the campus. 'Lacrosse must he looked at from another angle than that from wl1ich this col- umnist has viewed the situation. Lac1·osse is not a competitor to the other spring sports in the sense that it draws men pro- ficient in track and baseball. It is, rather, a spod which at- tracts those men who have not become experts in popular sports while in high· school or in prep school, and yet who are able- Fine Shoes 328 State Street i: bodied athletic tyres who seek some way of giving exp1·ession Gazette Duilding Extreme Styles Young Men's Shoes· All Sizes and Narrow or Wide Widths Agents Crawford Shoes The A.cme House Linen Supply Co. Rents linen for all occasions (You pay for laundry work only) 19 Romeyn St. Phone 2-1200 to the play instinct. Lacrosse, being a comparatively new spo1·t in this country, has few teams in the prep and high schools. Therefo1;e, the lacrosse teams in college must all be trained to play the game as if the men were complete novices, which many · of them are. Thus a college can stand out for its good lacrosse teams, not because it has experienced players from prep schools, but because its team has had a good coach to train new men. Another thing; this enthusiastic lacrosse player, now study- ing in New York, poi.nts out that lacrosse, like track, golf, and tennis, is a ~.port, proficiency in which can give the college an . intercollegiate reputation equal to that of any big college be- cause there is so little commerrin'ism in it that competition betw-een sma11 colleges and la1·ge colleges is quite possible and t.he results recognized. Still another thing: lacrosse pays for itself at such places as Syracuse and Rutgers, and if Union will ltdvertise its teams, which wou 1 d p 1 ay on Alexander field, crowds will be attracted to see the eontcsts and pay for the upkeep oi tl1e sport. Well, Coach Ha1·kness ha.s a reputation of having played with some of the best Canadian and American lacrosse teams. · He will take the team in hand this year for the first time. · He ~.hould carry on where the other coache-s of Union lacrosse teams · ha.ve left off --and retain Fnion's high place in inte1·collegiate _=::=:=:=::::;:=:~=::::;::::;::::;::::;:~ circles, I\L 1\L E.

The list of entries, which includes New York University, Colgate; Alfred, and R. P~ I., is bright for the inauguration of a new project and it is likely that within a few years the tour11ament will become as prominent and as important as tl1e board tmcl<: games which have been run for the last fo.tn· years. A furtherance of this policy of bringing colleges to Union should result in increased interest in the college, as well as wider publicity, with a corresponding increase in the number of men desiring admission. The last feature will undoubtedly bring the improvement in athletics so eal'hestly hoped for during the past few years and should, in every way, benefit the college. R. F. K. F 1:. d t t

Despite the fact that hut six gaines ate. J:isted', . the co1npetitors range from the small college to the largest in the • east. The lacrosse seaso;11 sh(:mld afford Union some: £avora.hle • publicity, especially if the Garnet byche 1•epcat.s its perfoi'll1'\ · nnces of the past few yeaJ.'S. - The only ;reason Rutgers was dropped was becallse the Scarlet is not permitted to come :north this season for its cus- . ·to mary games with Union, Syracuse, and lin bart. This nwvc made it possible to put U~1ion's old riva.~, Williams, on the schedule.. The, aim of the athletic department is to have Wil~ Iiams teams meet Union teams in evei·y sport 1·ecognized hy both institutions. l\fanager Granville Hills must be corrm1euded for Jljs .. flnc work ii1 arranging the schedule, acco1•ding- to Director Eruce. · . Hills, a junio:r, found himself manager when he returned to col~ lege last fall, because James )3. Little, '29, the manager, :had ·failed to retum to college. '\Vith most schediales for oth~r colleges practically released, Hills managed: to sigi1 up all but one of the teams played last year and aclded the Garnet's Bhl rival from Williamstown .. FACULTY OILS MACHINERY OF CAMPUS ACTIViTIES The new ruling of the college administration to ha,~e t:h~ managers of all sports and sueh campus activities ·sustained OJ the undergraduate tax make a financial report within 48 hou:es of such activity to the proper authority will insure l)~'ompt t•e]ease .of financial reports by these autheri-ties and aid\1il the intelligent examination o£ the reports befo1·e drawing up budg-ets for the following year. The Faculty Student Activities com- mittee is gradually systenwtizing the adminishation of the campus activities with the I'Cstdt that more €fncient organization should result. The committee iR also aiming to organize t.l!.:::;e activities in such a manner that responsibility will more easi)_v be fixed in the future. In other words, Dean. Garis's commit-te-e is trying to havr campus activities run on a business-like basis. Too frequently student managers have failed to make l'cp.OI'ts o'n time and as a result friction has resulted. This new I'ttling will probably oil the machinery a bit. M. M. E. FOREVER BLOWING BUBBLES Tired of seeing the Lions downtrodd.:n and overrun b:v their opponents, the alumni of Columbia demand abolishment of intercollegiate football at l\Iorningside Heights in a sym])Osiurn in their official publication. They point out that the sport l'las · not been a paying proposition since the Blue went in for big-titne football some years ago. But then, whoever heard that wi1mi1ig games and making money were anything hut incidental desid- . erata? Some shabby professor with large sections of the alpha- bet after his name may mumble in his s\nrp about a college paying football coaches several times what it pays him, hut deep in his heart he knows that a coach is not paid for his sus- pected knowledge of footbal1 or for transmitting it to othCTF;. He knows that a coach is, m~ should be, a character buildeT a11d an influence in the post-gra,duate life of the playe1's. Articles in Hamilton Life and The Amherst Student would ind·icates that the editors of these puhlica.tions were in sympatl1y with ideas simila.r to those of the Columbia alumni. Both tl1ese papers advocate the n.bolition of intei·colleg1ate sports or at least g1'eater promulgation o£ intramural sports. How though., are we to interpret the statements of the president of Not.re Dame University ·who says tl1at \football eminence is but a bubble. No one knows it better than the players themseh()s.\ In addition, he says that in spite of its. football fame No.bo · Dame really pays little attention to the sport and all th0 players · and college authorities ate primarily inteTes-ted in scholarship and studies. Then comes his announcement on top of this, that Notre Dame is spending $~15,000 on a U()W law school and $65,000 on a new football stadium. R. W. 13.

Charles H. Ken- dall, '30, opened the attacl' upon the faculty's action in ca.ncelling the Thursday dances with an argunit>nt hi which he carefully refuted the three points given as the l'rasons for the faculty's action. Rebutting the argument that other smalf colleges dance only two nights at. Prom -time, Kendall pointed to the · distinction which the Union Prom has ahvays held in this respeet and ar- gued against submergillg tl1e week- end into a class with those other col- leges. Following an attack upo.n the claim that Prom week o'l'iginally con- sisted of only two days, the spt-aker took up the problem Gf the financial drain caused by the ex:tra n.ight of dances, advancing· the arg·ument that tbe decisJon in this case sltould rest with the students, who are the ones U}Jon whom the expense rests. Athletes' Cause SupiJorted William H. Lehman, '31, president li'. of the .sophomore class, stressed two e:J points in his argument, the fact that athletes who must compete in Satur- day's games may attend Thursday's dances, while they may not dance at Prom, and that the longer weekend is an aid in rushing in that it gives Seated (left to Tight): Henry F.

Although the business manager and his assist- ants have been working but a short time, they have accomplished a gTeat , deal. They t\xpect to have the work finished by the middle of May. The editor and associate editors have very nearly completed all that <'an be done at the present time. By the end of the ·w·eek this will be fin- ished. Nothing then remains hut to · await the com}lletion of the seasons . of the various spring sports, at which time their records will be compiled. Resides these, electi-ons for most of the campus organizations have yet to take place. When these two items are finished, the book will be ready for the printer. Several of the present parts of the Handbook have been altered com- pletely, though none have been dis- carded. It is hoped that small pict- ures of the fraternity houses may he printed, but this may not be feasible due to cost and other factors. The editors are also working on several other new featu'!'eS; about which an· nouncements will be made later. ---o--~ Professor Mortimer F.
