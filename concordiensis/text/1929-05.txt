E VERY year thousands of college men and women seek jobs in New York City. Those whose New York has been gleaned from humorous magazines and history books, usually have a lot of fun until their money (or the family's patience) runs out. Those who have made it a habit to read a New York newspaper (at least every Sun- day) swing into the New York pattern of business and living much more easily- and profitably! But what newspaper to read? Several are very good, but there is one we believe you'll enjoy most-the New York Herald Tribune. It gives you all the news, without getting dusty or wordy about it; sports news (with men like Grantland Rice, W. 0. McGeehan and more of the same calibre): news of the theatres (with Percy Hammond, Arthur Ruhl and other skilled writers of the theatre): literature (BOOKS, a whole section of news and reviews of current writings, comes with the Herald Tribune every Sunday). There is a brilliant Magazine, sixteen pages of rotogravure; eight pages of real comics (including a page by Claire Briggs), pages of Society News and notes, complete financial and business news and forecasts, and a dozen more departments that make interesting and profitable reading for anyone who wants to know New York in all its moods. Try the New York Herald Tribune next Sunday and you'll understand why it is the favorite newspaper of so many college alumni living in and around New York. NEW YORK Mttalb at'tibunt

At the time of this writing we are not aware of the tennis results with Ham~· ilton hut from all predictions the racquet wielders were expected to triumph easily over Hamilton.

Without a doubt, if the spring teams can continu~ as they have started, Union will have one of the most successful sea- sons that it has ever enjoyed. KEEP SMILING Last fall there was an attitude of indifference toward the football te.am on the part of the undergraduates, the reason being (as we understand it) that the team was 11ot winning. This spring the teams are winning and the undergraduates are smiling. If the teams should start losing-and naturally we hope this doesn't occur-. but if they should we wonder if there would be as much smiling, as much cheering. If there isn't, to quote Anthony, \it were a gtievous fault\. We are showing that we can grin when the teams come through victorious\ but can we take a kick in the shins and still smile? Last fall it looked as though we couldn't, but it is up to the Union men this spring to stick with the teams no matter what happens and give them every bit of support, physi('al, vocal, mOl'al, and . otherwise, that they can.

J_ 'Clarkeson FRIDAY, MAY 10, 1929· ~ ENDOWMENTS THE senior class of Cornell universay recently brought to ~ successful conclusion its campaign for an endowment fund for the college with a total of $103,055 in subscriptions. .This sum, which is payable at the twenty~fifth anniversary of the class in · .,- 1954, will represent the class memorial. This idea, an old one at Cornell, is one which Union might well adopt in order to increase the college's endowment fund, which is much too small to meet Union's needs. At Cornell each member of the senior class duting the spring before Commence- ment pledges to contribute .a certain amount to the class fund, the total payments being ·due not later than the tweuty~tifth anniversary of the class. The amount asked of each man is. small in comparison with the benefits he has received from his Alma Mater and the money thus raised helps to. improve the college by increasing its endowment fund and thus putting the institution upon a firmer financial basis. 0 It is true that no amount comparable to Cornell's subscrip- tion total could be raised at Union, for the nmnbe1· of men in each class is much smaller, but the idea is at least wort.h trying. Each addition to the endowment fund, no matter how small, is · an aid to the college and this method, in addition, helps to keep alive each alumnus' interest in his college. Too often is it. said of Union that her alumni fail to show their appreciation of the college. The Cornell plan of endowment should erase this diffi- culty, for each alumnus, having, by contributing to the endow- ment fund, obtained a financial interest in the college, would undoubtedly feel a stronger interest :in her developrnnt 10tnd a greater willingness to aid any progressive improvements that might be planned.

T'hey will take place in the Memorial chapel at 10:00 o'clock. Preston Clark reported that the Terrace Council had met with Deans E.Ilery and Garis an<l that it was their opinion that the attendanct> would be improved by the change. Previ·ously the exercises had been held ,fh the Old chapel Saturday morning, but the attendance was sHm. The change to the Memorial cha.pel wHl make more room av.a:ilable for the studl'nts and spectators and will also add dignity to the ceremonies. Each class will move up a year in chapel seating. The ,juniors will occupy the seats of the seniors and Lhe sopho- mores will fill their pluces. The freshmen will occupy the places of the class of 1931 and their vacant pews will be taken by the seniors. Seven Terrace Councilmen wiH be tapved as the ,junior cl~tss marches arouml the chapel.

During the inter- mission these men will form in line in front of tht' kitchen and· will re- ceive their tables in the following order, which has been determined by lot: (1) Faculty, (2) Phi Delta Theta, (3) Key and :Blade club, (,t) Phi Gamma Delta, (5) Delta Pi Nu, (6) Theta Nu Eps.ilon, (7) Neutrals, (1:!)

Cumming TUESI!lA Y, MAY 14, 1929 CHEERING WHY c2onnot Union have some real cheering? The organ- ized rooting a.t Saturday's games was conspicuou·s by its absence, as it has been at every athletic .contest for the past .bvo years. Why must this condition exist? The reason given whenever this question has been asked in the past ·was the lack of spirit of the Student body, but is this the real cause or merely an excuse glven by those who have failed to properly fill their. positions? Certainly the Student body, if it ever did lack spirit, has overcome that. deficiency now. ·The willingness and whole~heart~ edness with which the undergraduates have worked on the new field and ha.ve supported all other movements for the benefit of the college during the past three months are indication enough of their interest in Union. Then why do they fail to give Union's teams the encouragement that proceeds from the rooting sections o:f other colleges? The answer, we believe, lies in the deficiency of tl1e cheer- leaders. This is not directly the fault of the present holdeJ;\s of these positions, for the system of competition for be1·ths on • • the cheering squads was handed down to them and has probably existed since the origin of organized cheeTing at Union. But why should this system remain in use? Why must men not particularly ·fitted for these positions be chosen t() fill them, merely for the lack of discovery of better men? Other colleges are able to obtain well-trained, capable cheerleaders. Union's Student body is a representative one and men just as capable. could be found here. A task now facing the heads of the cheer- leading squa<l, since they, through their positions, are particu- larly :fitted and in position for the work, is a study of the methods used by other colleges to obtain capable chee1·leaders and the origination of a similai· system £or use here.

COMPETITION NEEDED Although Union won the track 1neet Saturday afternoon running wild against Manhattan 97-28, we found the whole per- formance boring. Manhattan only took two first places during the entire afternoon and from the veTy beginning did not have half ~ cl1ance. We didn't see the Vermont meet, hut from reports the same situation prevailed up at Bui\lington. Of course it is a good feeting to win, but when two teams a1·e so unevenly matched as Union and Manhattan were, the feeling of exultation turns to something we can't quite explain. It has the same effect on us that it would have to see a 225 pound • heavyweight wiping the floor with a 135 pounder who is blind. · We hope that Lehigh will prove to be quite different next week. To see another slaughter like that would he disgusting. It is a good idea to open the season with an easy meet (this, . in the case of all teams), but a little real competition thrown in during tl1e season is not amiss. There must be some teams around which can cope with Union in track and field, without going to the otheT extreme. What if we did lose a couple of meets? It would be better to be beaten. in a. close, hard-fought meet, than to walk all ove1· weak, defenseless opponents. INTRAMURAL ELIGilULITY A new set of eligibili:ty rules fo1· intramul·al athletics. has· been put into force by the athletic board. It is well that some definite al'l'angement. satisfactory te all has been reached, and there should be no misunderstandings in the future as in the past concerning the eligibility of men for interf1·aternity compe- tition. There have been numerous instances from time to time \ihere there has been questioning about varsity men or men ' connected wi-th heshman sports taking part in the intramural. games. With the 1·ules as they are now, this should not happen any mo1·e. If the rules ai'e abided by to the letter t11ey should -but why write?

Replies to in vitiations extended to various high schools in the state to join the League have been com- ing in rapklly and favorably. The object of the League is to bring Union to the attention of the va- rious high schools throughout the state. The different schools will be divided into debating districts, and the winners in each district will come to Union at Commencement for the final debate of the scholastic debating tournam.ent. Due to the success of the. Cohun- bia- Union l'adio debate which was held in April, six radio debates have been arrang·ed for next year.

It would not 0nly be a . ~~--~-~-~~------~-~---~---­ thriller to watc:}l, bnt it would have considerable heating on which team should go at the top of the lacrosse list in the . n~:~.tional ratings this spring. NINE VETS IN LAST GAME As the team goee on the field in its last contest of the season nine players do'll. thei1• helmets and uniforms for their last repre-; sentation of Union. Six of the men have been playing regularly,; three have been used as subs in almost every game. Captain Gii: Potter heads the list as probably the snappiest and fastest stick· wielder that Union has ever had. He has been high scorer for • the season. and: has led a conquering team in a conquering manner. Potter deserves the plaudits of everyone. With him will go DeLong, Eagleson, Clark, Engel, Lauterbach, Simson, Cooley, Frosch, names that have been connected with lacrosse at Union f01· the past two and even three years, every one of them a veteran player, every 011e a star. Union will miss their · se1'Vices next year. The whole college should turn out today, not only to see the Garnet team dose its season with seven straight vict01·ies, but also to pay homage to the men who have helped make lacrosse history, and who will be missed next set~;son. Let'\s get out and push that team. STRONG COJ\IIPETITIO:t'f The Garnet track team has an outfit to meet tomorrow that 1s well worthy of its competition. 'Lehigh will bring a team that should give the Union bunch a close contest in every event. In :fact, Coach Bruce feels that I.e high will be a bit too much for the Gamet. At any rate the comparative times for the various running events show that the visitors have an edge. And yet, as 1v-e said the other day, we would much rather have to meet a team of Lehigh's strength and lose after a hard battle, than win hom little or no competition, such as Vermont and Manhattan offered. Perhaps one of the most interesting features of the after- noon will be the pole vault with George Van Wert, the freshman star, vaulting against Captain EUis Sadosky.

A, Glenn, ·~ AN old custom~ that of having the Student body .gathe1' o11ce each year for a night of song, will he revived Friday. Spring Night, as this ew:nt is called, is an old tradition .a.t Un.ion, grown into disuse by the fast pace of the present-day wllege man, to whom such quaint customs seem foolish. Its loss, however, has been felt. There have been no new Unio11 songs composed since the practice of student singing died out, a::nd the lack of these song-s has been noticed.

'V, Mitchell'-\'l'he P1.•ople'a C1•olee\ Our Ahna Mater, it is gencrall}' conceded, is ttOJo dead a tune. It la{?ks the pep necessary to inspire teams to fight faT Old Union, and a demand has grow11 up for a football song, oT some other snappy ballad that may be used in its place. But conditions on the ca1npus have not bePn conducivP to wng com- JHlsition. The Student body of late has never gathered togetltel~ to sing the college songs or to compl'te with individual class songs. As a result, there has been no incentive for the writing of new ballads. Spring Night should co-rrect tlriB. defect. It can do little t11is year to bring forth a new football song,· for there has b('ell Jto time since the completion of plm1s for the festival for the c-omposition of such a song. But the Student body can, hy ·g-iving the affair its full support, reestablish a custom that i11 t:be past has provided Union with a Taster of songs, and which \vlll do so in the future whe.n the event becomes an established eustom. BIGOTRY eyenmg. Er.MEit RicE, whose \Street Scene\ won the Pulib:C'r pnz~ · drama a'\\:srd, produced hi~ first play at the age of 21. Under the title \On Trial\ it was a sensational success during the 1914• . -;cason. Again, nine years lahn-, he s.eored another triumph in t.-xp1·essioni~tic drama with \The Adding Machine\ wherein were recor<'lecl th.:c experiencrs of the tragic Mr. Zero. Mr. Rice, or ra. ther l\h, Reizenstei11, claims, in l1is own words, that he has not read fi-ve books on the theater in fifteen years and, what . is moTe, l1e doubts that he could nn.me ten contemporary French, Germant or English dranJatist.R at randmn. In spite of this retieen<·e from literature 011 the drama; however, he has truly placed his name high in the annals of dra..1natic 'achievement.

The :nesult is that they either vote bJindly on the manager's endorse- ment or according to personal acquaintance motives. Often the competition is so keen that a manager will recommend two Ol' more men equally and ask the committee to choose from anw:r;+g them. Is it fair to any one of the ·candidates that the months of hard woi'k and sacrifice which l1e has undergonP he dismissed, .~s it were, by a toss of the coin? Or, in the event of a manager's designating one above the other, sl1ould the responsibility of electing the incoming manager be t'lms entirely given to the incumbent of that position? For it amounts to just that in such an event. And such a p1·ocedure is not necessarily devoid manager, and the captain of the sport involved, would represent an undergraduwte majority in control of an undergradqate activity. Fraternity politics could exert IIo more influence in such a body than it wields under the present system. Such a eommittee comprises four men. with whom the candidates have wQrked for at least four montbs, two with whom the successful nominee will wark for two yean;, amd one who has probably as . thoro1.1.,gh a knowl~dge qf the candidates' character and scholastic. tendencies as has any o:fflciaf of the college. And such a com- ~~~=~~~===~~~=: mittee is 100 per cent qualified, by virtue of its rnutual inte1~ests of fraternity politics. The assistant manager of the sport involved i~ much better wi 1 th the candidates in their· several capacities of prospective managers and of present students, to give each of them an intelligent consideration.

The danger of f:ra- ternity politics is present, .jlt is true, but this possibility is at . ,least no worse than what is ordiii~r:ily a blind. endot·s!'ltnent. We would add as fifth membel' of the committee the coach i of the sport.

Individual instruction in flying is offered to selected appii<;ants by the Buffa:lo Summerunitofthe National Flying Schools-May to November. Complete courses of instruction qualifying the student for various government commercial pilots' licenses are now open for your selection. The equipment of this school comes second only to the Army and Navy schools in reliability and completeness. The training plane used is manufactured by the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation, who have been exclusive primary plane manufacturers for the United S:ar::s Army Air Corps, and for four foreign governments for a number of years. Our instructors have been carefully selected from the Army Air Corps, and their classes are being limited to insure thoroughly indi- vidualized instruction. Parents whose sons or daughters are contemplating courses in flying this summer are invited to write us for details regarding our schools. It is our belief that many of the future executives of this new giaqt industry will be largely selected from our vatiol!ls school units of which Buffalo is the first. Where possible, we suggest a personal visit to our office or the Consolidated Airport, Military Rd., Buffalo~ Full details of the subjects taught, terms, etc., will be furnished upon applicadon. Write, phone, wire or ca:ll in person. 11 p R ivA T .E TUTORS IN FLVING\ INSTRUCTOR PERSONNEL Lt. Frederick C. Nelso11~ A. P;-Direttor in charge of Studet'lt Training. Formerly Dean of the U. S.
