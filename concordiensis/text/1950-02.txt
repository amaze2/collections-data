ClltCJ'LATIOS STAFF Benjamin Constant (1767-1830), French man of letters and liberal politician, is probably best known today' as the author of Adolphe, a novel in which the author's own intimate experiences are recounted in a highly personal manner. Con- stant's life might be said to have been dominated by two forces: women and work. In fact, his biog- raphy consists of an endless series of amorous liasons interrupted from time to time by intervals of scholarly work and political man- euverings. character in such a way that he reveals admirably the utter frustra- tion that it occasioned. Constant, as much as anyone of his time, was afflicted by the \maladie du siecle.'' BE1'WEEN his amours, Ben- jamiin found time to do a consider- able amount of serious writing, which included a seven volume work on the origins and develop- ment of religions, a work on Roman .polytheism, and numerous political pamphlets. Throughout his life he was a great gambler, and many have at- tributed his apparent political op- portunism to his love for taking chances (his motto was \vogue la gal ere\ - let's ·~chance it.l Mr. Nicolson, however, presents a very convincing case when he ascribes Constant's various politica,l> stands, which were almost on the side of the opp.osition, to egotism. Constant was an extremely egotistical per- son, and both his adoption of a liberal political philosophy and his stand as a political independent seem to have their origin in this trait of his character. Of especial interest in political the aspect_ of his life is his position during the Hundred Days, and Mr. Nicolson's interpretation is a completely satisfying one. ·foods of tcoday by over-refinement BUT \l.UE-TOOISM\ is not the and keep the girls healthier and biggest obstacle to Republican sue- happier. . cess.

Chapel Spectacle Last .;\londay's chapel progTam which consisted of a O'eneral student bodv meeting was indeed a sad spectacle. If this was an example of how a well organized and efficient council operate:;:, the program was certainly n~sleading: It would appear that a complete lack of preparatiOn combmed with a further lack of a clear cut procedural set-up for stu- dent bodv meetings resulted in a sloppy and boring presenta- tion which not only gave the council a black eye but also indicated the apathy of the entire student body. The hit or miss actions of the council officers seem to be a carrv over of the general feeling of unconcern with which l.'\r{ion College undergraduates view not only their local student o·ovemment but most campus activjties as well. Perhaps this ~ due to the example set by our elders in their attitudes towards government. \Ve do not wish to place unjustified criticism on the council or its officers who conducted the chapel program, but actions similar to this assembly sometimes speak for themselves. Student bod v meeting·s are, in our opinion at least, quite important and ~ecessary for the proper function of the student government. To this end we would like to suggest that the following points may help to avoid a recurrence of :\londa v':; fiasco. (i) Strict adherance to thl' stipulations of the sections of the constitution, which cover student body meetings, especially Article I\' part 3 \\·hich requires notice of the meeting· to be given in each daily assembly for one week and conspicuous posting of the announcement on the bulletin board. \\'e might mention al~o Article VI part 1 which re- quires parliamentary procedure, as well as part 2 which states that minute;; of tlw previous meeting be read only at the request of five memuers or at the request of the president. (2) FU!iher study of these portions of the constitu- tion with an eye to\vard not only simplification but also toward a clear cut procedure which harried student body executives might fullow. (3) Greater preparation of the summary of council acts woulrl help. In this problem time is an important factor during- noon-time chapel assemblies. We certainly hope that we are wrong in stating tliat the undergraduates at Union are not concemed with their gov- emment and that some council actions are lax. However the proof of the pudding· is in the eating and the next council meeting to be held this coming Tuesday should reveal what the situation actually is. Prom Success Promotion for the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund benefit dance, the Snowball, got off to a rather poor start last Wed~ nesday noon in :Memorial Chapel. Ordinarily such a demon- stration would have provided grist for our anti-chapel mill, however several considerations make this the exception. From all evidence this chapel program seems to have been an honest attempt to present publicity within the limits of good taste and good listening enjoyment. However last minute technical difficulties plus a poorly planned presenta- tion resulted in general pandimonium. We hope that the pandimonium which has been promised for next Monday will be a little more favorable when the prom committee once more takes to the stage. Even though some of us were opposed to this prom we feel that once the student body has committted itself to a course of action all of the members should help in the com- mon effort. Union has an opportunity to gain reco!nlition for itself and this chance should not be allowed t7> pass us by. A successful prom win not only aid the cancer fund but Union as well. HIS PASSIONATE affaii·s were by no means due to licentiousness, for if this were the case, they would present very little real in- terest. The chief interest in these amours lies in the traits of charac- ter which they reveal. Constant was a strange combination of in- tellectual vigor and moral weak- ness, and the story of his life is an account of the upheavals occas- ioned t>y the working of a keenly analytical mind upon an extremely sentimental heart. He felt great need for love but was at the same lime incapable of love. For him the striving for the possession of a woman, whether it be Mme. de Stael, Mme. de Charriere or Mme. Recamier, the most famous of his many conquests, always meant much more ot him than the actual possession. Once his goal had been attained, his pleasure was immedi- ately destroyed by his faculty for keen self-analysis. Because of his moral weakness, however, it was only after a long and bitter strug- gle that he was finaly able to extricate himself. Mr. Nicolson presents the dual nature of his THE AUTHOR has done an ex- cellent job in bringing some sort of order out of the very complex and often contradictory life of \Constant !'inconstant.\ His trans- lations are with very few excep- tions expertly done. The general reader should encounter no dif- ficulty in the worlr, since extensive notes (16 pages of thepl) are in- cluded at the end of the biography, and the scholar will be pleased to find an extensive bibliography and index, --~o--- Conference Set A conference on small business will be held at Union on Thurs- day and Friday, March 23 and 24, under the sponsorship of Union College in cooperation with the Schenectady Chamber of Commerce and the Empire State Association of Commerce. THE PURPOSE of the confer- ence ·will be to bring together rep- resentatives of small business to discuss common problems and to consider the place of the college man in small business.

THE LOT assigned to the fra- ternity by the college is at the corner of Nott street and Lenox road. Members of the fraternity surveyed the site recently. The plans for the house are being pre- pared by the college architects, Mc- Kim, Mead and White, and will be included in a br·O>Chure to be sent to the alumni in the spring, lt is hoped that construction can be begun this spring. The chapt.er house will be a memorial to the founders of the fraternity . THE ALPHA chapter of Theta Delta Chi was founded in 1847, the 11th social fraternity in the coun- try. The local chapter was inac- tive from shortly after the Civil wa:r; until it was reactivated in 1923. The chapter currently meets at the Dean's residence in North Col- lege, the pean being the faculty advisor to his fraternity.

To the Dutehman's Rathskeller: During the past :l·ear I have devoted much of m~· time and energy to the establishment and organization of the Dutchman's Rathskeller. It has become in· creasingly apparent, however, that there are diverse opinions concerning the management of the Rathskeller. ln view of the need for unity in the manage- ment of any business enterprise, I hereby resign from the Dutch- man's Rathskeller and the posi- tion of General Manager tlterof. I trust that the membership of the Rathskeller will consider the following thoughts in regard to . organizational management: L Consider the aims and purposes of the organization. 2. Strive for unity in direction. Sincerely yours, Thomas C. Elliott Other officers of the Rath- skeller include Charles Lindstrom, business manager and Clarence Simmons personnel man,ager. ELLIOTT who is planning to de- vote greater time to the Mounte- banks and his position of Student Council secretary, was not alone in tendering a resignation. Two other members also announced the intention to submit their resigna- tions at the next executive· meeting. Elections for the various offices of the Rathskeller will normally take place during A:i]ril of each year which means that Elliott's successor will serve only until that date on which regular electi{)ons will be held. A senior, Elliott would have had to leave the group this spring. THE RATHSKELLEU. will re- main on its present basis of oper- ations although some economy measures as to expenditures will be instituted, according to the ex- ecutive committee. Mr. Wilford Ketz coordinator of student activi- ties and advisor of the Rathslteller has noted that the financial con- dition of the organization would be 'greatly improved if greater eco· nomies were followed. Faced by the graduation of seven of the present thirteen members of the Rathskeller a move has been made to• institute a general pub- licity and membership campaign. A committee has been selected by the Rathskeller to organize the drive. George Orick heads this group which includes David Wal- rath and William McWhinney. Men who are interested have been urged to come out as soon as possible so that the experience required by the constitution may be gained to enable the individual to be eligible for the spring elections. ----.,~o,--- ASCEMeetS At the monthly meeting of the Union College student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engi- neers on Feb. 14, Rodney Gartner was elected editor of the associa· tion's newpaper, the C.

Orchids for Elliott We should be justly proud of our Dutchman's Rathskeller and of the man who made it possible. Thomas Elliott, the drive behind the efforts of Union students to secure the rathslwller, deserves the praise and commendation of the entire student body for his untiring efforts on behalf of this new student activity. When student support was lagging, it was Elliott who campaigned. When a constitution was to be written it 'Yas Elliott who began the work. ~lost of the early planmng which proved to be so adequate as time went on was due to Elliott's foresight. His, too, was the unstinting labor on construction and his know-how aided and guided the volun- tai·v work of others. · The story of the rathskeller is not entirely Thomas Elliott's story, for there was a loyal core of other students who helped t1·emendou~ly in this task and who deserve a g-reat deal ot applause. llO\\·ever it was Elliott, the crusader, who was in the public eye. We feel this was justly so, for it was Elliott who pleaded, urged, cajoled for the project, and worked on the construction. Org-anizing was Elliott's forte as the completion of the rath~·;J\t'llf'r inrliC'ntes. \\'e are glad that Tom Elliott came to Cnion. Squeeze Play The Cnion College Boa1·d of Trustees has gone on record as being opposed to the construction of a spur of the New York State th1·ough-way across the southwestern corner of the college pasture. Recently the board of trustees of the Schenectady County Pulliic Library made public an intention to request land fro1n the college for parking facilities following the lead of the Ameriqm Locomotive Company, whose parking lots, although moved southward, stil1 cover a large part of the pasture. · Here, then, are several indications of a pressure on the college, which like a buffer, lies between the industrial and business sections of the city and the so-called \better resi- dential\ section. The original vast acreage of the college lands has dwindled down to a mere 100 acres. The college naturally does not \ovant to see further inroads made that would diminish opportunity for future expansion. There is only one directio:p. in which the college can expand once available campus space has been used, and that is to the east into what has been called the General Electric Realty plot. Several extentions have been made tentatively in this direction. The Achilles house willed to the collge stands unused because the zoning board has refused to alter restrictions calling for one family residential structures. Two Cnion College fraternities have already moved into the area. Sewral members of the zoning board have been qu~ted IJ~· ar-ea papers as saying that many other violations ex1st and that there is a desire on the part of some to open the zone to apartment houses. The dilemma in which tl:e college finds itself, as pres- sure from the east and res1stance from the west grows seems however to have some bright spots in that this i~ larg~ly a problem for the. future and by then, perhaps, the barrier of Lenox Road will not be insurmountable. Compulsory Culture 1\:fond~y's chapel p~ogrn;m, as expected, turned into pand1moruum. Perhaps 1t might be stated mm·e clearly as \pr_om~iJ?onium.\ We do howeve1· hope that the means will be JUstified by the end ... that the Damon Runyon Cancer fund will benefit from this progTam. The , Weekly e BY NAVIAS , tion system of today is en- slaved by the '--------------.111 almighty Ga•d of the Grade, and THE QUESTION: Students at RPI who ma:intain an 85 average during the term hour tests anc during a concentrated two-week review period at the end of the term are. exempted frc•m final ex-· · aminations. Dr. Roy P. Baker, RPI .dean, feels that the exemp- tion from final examinations stimu- lates students to do work of higher qua·Iity. What do you thin)t a·bout the system-would you like to see it started at Union? inasmuch as I see no relief from this situ- ation, I am in favor of the use of an .. xpmption system as an added incentive.\ 7..{, J Me..fJ·~.J',, fj'rt?lt4b/l' .,.-'t: J<\,..«!J.r yerd~.,.,.~t.el.

Prom Plaudits We are fortunate once more to be able to extend a word o:f greeting to the many visitors who are gracing our campus for the Winter Weekend. In addition to the cooperation of the weatherman, who supplied the winter, the prom committee has exerted itself to provide a pleasant and w01thwhile weekend for all. The Damon Runyon Cancer Fund, which as the focus and theme of the program, will receive a donation of $3 from e~ch couple at the dance. We feel that the po!lege com~un:ty should be applauded for this attempt to a1d m the allev1at10n of the suffering of others. It is indeed also a fine gesture on the part of many groups on campus to donate money tG the fund regardless of attendance at the prom. This might well be applied further so that an opportunity could be made av~ilable for thc:se who are not attending the dance to contnbute voluntarily to the fund. The entire proceeds then, will be given as Union's contribution. Before we leave the subject of the winter weekend credit ought to be given where it is due. The promcommittee has done a great deal of commendable work. William Van- Ost and Harry Petrack, the co-chairmen, as well as Jack Fischel, William DeLorenzo, Arthur Kean, William Herrman, and Gerald Shapiro have put much thought and effort to the weekend. For Balance • • • It is interesting to note the various reactions\ that have arisen to the suggestion that Union College invite an avowed communist ex-professor to speak on campus. We will not attempt to analyze the general student body feeling on the matter with the sparse information we have on hand. How- ever the very reactions themselves seem to point out an- other situation. There appears to be a great deal of awareness on the part .of undergraduates as to the trends and events which occur outside of the class room. Could it possibly be that the present day student is no longer in the 'ivory tower' of scholarly seclusion and metaphysical absorption? Perhaps this extravagant statement was never really the case but it serves to emphasize a tendency too easily fallen into. We think that the concern of the college student should not be with either extreme but rather a balanced outlook that tries to weave together the practical and the scholarly approaches. The difficulty, of course, is found in defining terms such as balance, practical, etc., but the direc- tion of the concern is given. There can be no doubt however, that the traditional liberal arts training is rapidly giving way to increasing dellland for specialization. But even this specialization can be conducted high in the clouds above the actual situation. An indication that this type of thing might exist is the recent change in Corporation Finance course toward case studies as explained elsewhere in this paper. A direct but yet a studied approach to problems in and out of the classroom would appear to be a step in the direc- tion towards greater preparation for solving these and other problems. Suggestion A suggestion for those who will be taking prom dates around the campus Saturday morning is to be sure and at- t~nd Founders Day· exercises at 11 a.m. in Memorial Chapel. Formal attire will add to the color of the event. For the prom committee, we would like to express ,our gratitude .

NORMALLY the first, or the first two teams, in the Eastern and Western ISU meets are chosen for the senior division, but Paul Smith College, which finished second at . Syracuse University, was declared :ineligible for the seniors because it is a junior college. Union- will meet eleven other . colleges, the eight top teams re- . tained from last year's senior di- vision, plus Syracuse and the two 'to]} ·finishers in the Eastern ISU. This competition will include Dart- mouth, Middlel;mry, St. Lawrence, New Hampshire, McGill, Maine, Vermont, and MIT. COACH John McLaughry will use the same five men that he em- ployed in the 14-team Western meet. They are Hallvard Osborg, George Best, Heikki Immonen, Dick Jesser, and Floyd Snyder. Osborg, Best, and Jesser were en- tered in all four events last week. Osborg, whose native Jand is Nor- way, starred last week. He fin- , ished second in the cross country, close behind Farwell of Syracuse, the intercollegiate champion. He was also third in the downhill and he would have won the jump had his hand not touched the ground. His jump was the longest of the meet. BEST took fifth in the jump, eighth in the cross country and twelfth in the downhill. Union also did well in the combined events, where scores are computed on the basis of results in two previous events. • II • SLACKS • TROUSERS ~ 1,000 Pairs to Pick From • • • • • ROCHESTER PANTS STORE • W STATE ST.- Upstairs • • ••••••••••••• swimming and in interesting high school and, prep school boys in Union.
