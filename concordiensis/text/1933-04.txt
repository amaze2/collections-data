Garis, president of the board. He explained that the surplus in the fund each year will cover the cost of printhig this bflok, and that advertising will be :;t'bolished, thus making it easier .for the other publications to ob- tain advertisements.

Cory, Jr. Issue Manager .......... Ernest F. Painter FAREWELL We of the outgoing Senior Board turn over the responsibilities of The Concordiensis to the new board with a complete sense of confidence in its ,ability to continue to serve Union students in. the best way J.>Ossible. We have attempted to instruct these men in the fundamental arts of scholastic journalism that they might present t-o yo.u an even better paper under their director- s lti.p, The past year has seen many changes in The Concordiensis which we believe to have im- proved it. We have always strived to present to undergraduates the best type of news mat- ter, rather than attempting to increase student interest by the introduction of degrading stories. Our changes have been met with the cooper- ation of the student body and this has made additional changes less difficult to sponsor. The outstanding change of the year was the removal .of the publication office from Wash- bum hall to Silliman hall. A complete well equipped office now provides facilities for the j)roduction of a paper second to none in its class. We only regret that our term of office were just beginning in the :new offices, rathel.\ th;,~,n tel'minating. While in the new offices for only two issues, we have attempted to organize a more efficient method of coverage of the news sources of the campus. Working hours have heen reduced, so that it is no longer necessary to toil late into the night that the paper may go to press. This we believe, will in itself be in- strumental in getting many men out for the pa- !)er who previously could not spare the time. Dean Garis is deserving of great credit for his foresight in conceiving of the plan of estab- llshing the present office by the efficient man- agement of all .publications under the Publica- tion Board. Crcclit also goes to Mr. Enzer for his efforts in planning the new office, made only after he had personally inspected the leading college newspaper offices in the east. His many ideas and suggestions on organization will also aid to make The Concordiensis a better paper here. Before leaving office we have brought about a reorganization of the senior staff with a view toward more efficiency, better written material and the introduction of a new office, namely that of feature editor. The holder of this position will be in charge of interesting exchange matter found in other college papers as well as conduct- ing surveys among the leading college publica- tions to determine the sentiments of students of o tlrer colleges on various important topics or ·events. A better grade of paper was introduced this year at a greater cost to the paper, but we be- 1ieved that this was justified. Greater appropria- tions have been made for pictures throughout the year. All of this we felt would add to the improvement of the paper. Various stud'ents have been asked to coil- tribute feature article.s to the pap.er, though they were not members of the staff. This was done to introduce new material into the paper which pj•evious1y has been omitted from it. A mu.sic ·column was added this year. This has caused THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, APRIL 14, 1933 DEBUT lt is with a full realization of our weighty respoRsibilities that we, the new Senior Board, assnrn'e our duties. We feel that the retiring Board has improved The Concordiensis. vastly, ancl we arc grateful to them for the maRy im- portant journalistic lessons they have .taught us. Up to the pasf month, they were forced to work under most unfavorable . conditions in the ohl pablications of.fice; but in spite of this handica~p, they haye improved our paper decidedly duting the P,ast year. Now, thanks t0 Dean Garis and Mr. Enzer, Union College has a modern publica- dons ·office with facilities that can he equaled by few, if .any, small colleges. In accordance with the usual custom, we shall oudine our plans for the coming year. in the first place, our chief aim wi'll be t6 im- prove every department . of the paper as much as .poss,ible. The advantages of the new office and the n.e:w system inaugurated with it should aid us in this purpose. The remainder of this year will be devoted to experhnenting with and testing this, new arran.gement with the ultimate hope that we shall be able to produce a :J(llore efficient news-gathering organization. Reporters will be assig,ned definite \beats\ with the result that they will become thoroughly acq_uainted with the activities of the people about whom ·they write. The creation of the new pasition of feature editor, opens an entirely new field. There are many interesting traditions and people on our campus that the Student Body is not familiar with. The subject matter of the feature articles, which appear regularly, wii:l no,t, however, be re- stricted to items pertaining to Union College. It is the purpose of the ne\v department to se- cure articles concerning national affairs, special fields of knowledge, or any topic which is of in- terest to the undergraduate. It wiH be necessary to enlarge the staff of The Concordiensis to meet the needs of the new system. Consequently, a call for freshman re- porters will be issued in the near future. Previ- ous experience will not be necessary, but eve,:y effort will be made to secure the services of the best students and the outstanding personalities m the class of 1936. We wiU continue the impartial, unbiased and more or less conservative expression of student opinion which has been the editorial p.olicy of The Concordiensis in the past. We believe that the Student Council has done a great deal of good work, and as long as it continues its con- structive legislation, intend to stand .squarely behind it. While it is impossible to express the will of the entire Student Body; we will en· deavor to represent the opinion of the majority at all times. If criticism seems necessary, we will criticize impersonally, From time to time we will attempt to alleviate unfavorable existing conditi'ons by offering suggestions. More use by the undergraduates of the \In the Mail\ column would aid us in presenting truthful student opinion. While lack of space prohibits tne publishing of all the letters re- ceived, each one is considered carefully and filed. We believe in Union College aRd in the se- curity and glory of her future. It is our earnest hope that we can continue to publish a news- paper that will continue to reflect credit upon our Alma Mater. some comment and without doubt is read by only a small proportion of the student bo.dy. We feel, however that this column is worthy of its existence and should be continued for the bene- fit of those who are interested in tltis side of life. Our editorial policy has tended to r.eflect the best interests of Union College, in spite af much adverse critieism from some students. We have attempted iby the use of editorials to abolish deals and have dealt with this situation to the great discomfiture of men implicated in this un- fair method' .of elections. Personal feelings have been sacrinced for the attainment of an ideal I regardless of consequences. We feel that we were justified and that more has been done to- ward this attainment this year than ever before. Again we repeat that we turn over to the new board the many duties .of the paper with absolute confidence that the task, though it be a hard one, will be met squarely and will be done well b:y them.

Woolman Issue lllanager ------------- Arthur Katzberg '' LEAVE THINGS AS THEY ARE The ,rec<>mmendations of the •committee on Studeat Council nominations and elections cer- tainly :would result in the use of a yery compiex system if they were adopted. It 1s a. question whether th.e use of such a system would ?e 3:n 'improvement ever the present method whtch ts fairly .satisfactory and is not involved. The geaeral opinion of the committee seems to be tllii·at no change is necessary at present. In fulfiilhnen.t <>f its obligations to the 'Student Body, however, it was nece_ssary to present some plan. Tl1ese recommendatwns are the result of ·careful study of a number of plans. ·The cl1ief objection to the present system -seems to be the fear that one fraternity is liable to have too many representatives on the Stud~nt CounciL 'fhis feeling is just anothe~ way of m- dicating that at pr~sent one fr~termty ~as five men on· :the Counctl. Does thts .fratermty run the coHe~e? Does it control the Student Coun- cil? Of course the answer to these two q.ue~­ tions is emphatically no! We might add. that thts :fraternity is represented on the Connell as fol- lows: two seniors, one junior, one sophomore and ont freshman. When these men were chos· ert, the ma.jority of the voters knew their fra- ternity alfl'Liations. Since such a large majority of students are fraternity men, it is .quite natural that the Stu- dent Council should consist, .for the most part, of membel'S of fraternities. H several of the outstan<ling- men in a class happen to be in the same hottse there is absolutely no reason why they shmtld not all be elected, or at lea~t nom- inated for [)ositions on the Student Counctl. Why should meaesure:s be taken to keep a capable per- son off tlte Council simply because he is a mem- ber 'Of a. fr.aternity which has several other out- standin~r people in it? It is evident that a oer- tai·n faction which is not composed of students who are either active or ab'le in student affairs has stat:ted all this agitation concerning the changes in question. The changes recommend- ed will cmly serve to lower the calibre of the Student Council if they are adopted. The neutrals must accept a large share of the blame for being in the position which they now occupy. A large majority of this group has lit- tle or n·o in·krest in Union College, other than attending classes. If one man from this body would step forward, present their case to the students. and ·offer suggestions which they be- lieve WEJttltl lead to the betterment of present conditions, the neutrals would find a number of students who would listen to their troubles, The noll-fraternity men, because of lack of in- terest of great diversity of opinion, are in a thoroughly <lisorganized state. Until they or- ganize they cannot hope, nor have they any right to hop€, :to accomplish anything. ' Instc:1atl of turniag the entire nomination and election system upside down it would be better to leave thi·ngs as they are ttntil such a time as when tl1e Student Council gives indications that it cannot ha:ndle student affair-s efficiently. : ,! . ¥·:;~~'!;.~!., ~ ~~--<. THE C()NCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, APRIL 18; 1933 FRESHMAN, SOPHOMO~'ES, JUNIORS AND SENIORS Will this year's Prom be a success? This question is be.ir'11g pointed to eveFy one of y0u. It is. your responsibiHty and your dance. The Comrnittee is doing its utmost to provide the best in mus·ic, entertainment,. decorations and favors; but all of these preparations. are y·se.less .if yrm fai,l to support this function. Junior Prom, this year, i:s the only dance ever sponsored by the class ·of 1934. Last ~ear the Soiree was ahoHshed, and unl'ess Prom IS a financial success it may. meet the same fate as the :sophomore dance. The Committee. has low- E!red the price from se¥en dollars to stx do!llars in order that more students might he able to attend the dance. After May 6, the price will be raised to seven dollars. A large early ad- vance sale will ai@ the committee to estimate .the a:ttendance. On:e o.f the ilDest hands in America has been ena-aged' in order that the dance mig.L1t be Sec- ond to none .in the history of Uni-on.

FRESHMEN AGAIN In spite of a great deal of disturbance 'on the part of the freshmen in the balcony, during Stu- dent Body meeting yesterday, MR. CLARKE managed to gi\'e his speech yesterday morning. He might well have requested the oHenders in no uncertain tenns, to keep quiet. Last year, the Student Body gave the fresh· men voting powers beginning with the start oi the second semester. The class of 1936 is gross- ly abusin'-! this p!71vi'lege. If they prefer to spend the time devoted to Student Body meetings to conversation, there is no reason why they should have voting powers. The Sophomore Disciplinary Committee, in- stead of giving haircuts for walking on the grass and similar offenses, would do well to devote their energies to .trying to instill an intelligent interest in s.tudent affairs in the class of 1936. The Disciplinary Committee has not done any constructive work, nor has it announced any worthwhile program this year. In fact its ac- tions this year warrant its discontinuance. We shoul'd entrust the affairs of the freshmen to a committee which will take steps to interest the first year men in student affairs and Union Col- lege traditions. By BANKINE IDNMAN With Professor Tidmarsh's announcement Sunday that efforts are being made to continue the Commencement music festivals begun last year it became evident that the current mu- sical season will' not terminate until the close of college. Several events yet to occur include the lecal concert of the Glee Club Friday, at the Mohawk Golf Club, a recital Sunday by the Mendelssohn Trio, the appearance of Nelson Eddy next Thursday in Memorial chapel with the Thursday Club of Schenectady and the Mon- day Club of Albany under Professor Tidmarsh's direction, the Schubert Club's -final concert May fifth, and the performance of \Trial by Jury\ Junior Prom week-end. A capacity audience should certaiNTy be an- ticipated for the Glee Club concert Friday. For the past several years attendance has kept apace gf the development of the dub, notwithstanding the current depression; last year the capacity of the Van Curler was reached. This will be the first opportunity for the stu- dent :body to hear the club under its new stu- dent ·director, Edward Mates; his composition, \From the River,\ will be presented for the first time locally. The club is offering the same pro- gram which constituted the recent New York concert, considered one of the most successful concerts the club has given. Union students have learned by now .that they can expect from the Glee Club not only the customary enthusiasm and vitality of a well trained youthful chorus but the finish and depth of a mature group. An excellent program of chamber music will bE: offered by the Mendelssohn Trio Sunday eve- ning, April twenty-third, at eight o'clock in the Unitarian Church, Union street. The trio is composed of Giovanni Trombini, ceHist well known to Sunday afternoon chapel audiences, Anthony Stefan, violinist, and Joseph Derrick, pianist, two musicians of more than exceptional talent. It is hoped that this recital may be the .first of a series, for local music fare has been deficient in good chamber music. The program includes Beethoven's Trio in C minor, Parker's Stlite in A major, and Mendelssohn's Trio in D minor. Admission is fifty cents. At 10 o'clock this evening the WEAF net- work will broadcast the second of the Walter Damrosch spring concerts, a series in which two composers are compared on each program. Tonight the orchestra will play Mozart's \Jupi- ter\ ·symphony and Berlioz's \Queen Mab\ (Scherzo) and \Feast\ from \Romeo and Juliet.\ ::.1 II II II 1111'1 II II Ill Ill II llilllllll U111UI'U IIH 1111111.111111111 UIIUI Ill UU Ill Ill 11111111 U L~..; - .. ~ - ~ - ~ - - · ~ CON/CERT. and DANCE ~· I= - - -· '- : .... - '- = ·= '- For the Benefit .of a: Up.ion ColLege Scholarship to a Schenectady Boy By the ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ - ... - ::: § - - - ... - .... = - :UNION COLLE,GE ·GLEE :CLUB ~ - ·= ...

Stewart RUSHING LISTS 'the letter whi~h Professor WALDRON has sent to a-ll the fraternity houses asking them whether or not they prefer to have a rushing list issued. now, or not until June should result in a una.nimo11s response expressing the desire that the Secretary's. office supply such information at ·once. Many fraternities are willing to set aside week-erids in the spring for the purpose -of en- tertaining sub-freshmen. The absence this year of the first rushing list, which usually comes out early in the spring, makes it very difficult for fraternities to get in touch with candidates for admission. Such week-ends are not only very advantageous to the fraternities, but they are also an aid to the college because a week-end on the campus in congenial surroundings has often induced' desirable candidates to apply .for admission. It .seems tbat a list including not only the names of candidates already accepted by the col- lege, but also the names of those who are. inter- _.ested in Union, but have not yet signified their intention of coming here in the fall, be .released at once. INCONSISTENCY IN DAILY ASSEMBLY For the past month some of our Daily As- sembly speakers have run over their time with the result that they have been forced to cut tj1e~r addresses short. During this same period one o~ two have talked until after the bell an- nouncing the beginning of third period classes. We do not know the reason for this impartiality, but perhaps it is because Dean ELLERY is not always present to cut off those who talk too long. Those of u~ who have just another class or ha-ve no class at all after Assembly, do not, as a rule, care whether or not the speaker ov;er- stays his time. To a stude11t who has an hour exam immediately after Assembly, however, such a situation is most irritating, and i.s oft~ directly responsible for the lowering of his grades . . Daily Assembly should start promptly at teR o'clock, and should end promptly at ten rnirttites past ten. At present it never starts on time, and rarely does it end when it should. DEAD AT LAST The vote taken on Wednesday by the heads of all frate-rnities proves conclusively that :the majority of the Greek Letter societies have heard all ti:Jey want to about an Interfraternity Council. After a great deal of unnecessary wrangling, and was.te of time, the Student Council finally took steps to settle an issue which was of very little imp.ortanee .. When Union Co-llf.ge secures. more dormitory fadlities, thereby making a much needed change in our rushing system possible; then, .and not unti'l then, will we liav:e any use for an Inter- fraternity Council. THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, APRIL 21, 1'933 INFIRMARY ... The Committee (}fl. the reapportionment of student taxes. ha:s submitted a commendable re~ port. A great amount of work was done by the mentbe-rs, and taxes were carefally investigated. The findings of the Committee indicate that s.teps will he taken in the near future to provide a pl'ace for ·the accommoGla'tioti of students in case of iHness. · Very few coHeg.es do not have an infi.rmary of some sort.

Often the facil- ities are excellien.t., but .of course it is not possible to have the -equipment that W(mld be found in a -re-gular h-o-spital. Since the Ellis Hospital is. so near the camp- us, the present 1~lan to maiNtain a wing :there fo·r -the use of stude-nts seems to be the most advis- able way to meet the situation. When an emerg- ency arises the hospital has the equipment to meet it, while am infirmary on the campus could not be· depended .upon to be able to meet such a crisis. In the past there have been epidemics which have reached serious p·roportions.

Campus Chatter Wel'l, first of all we're going to spike a false -rumor that has been drifting about the campus. Some one told us that the new Concordy bo.ard was going to im-prove the pa-per by dispensing with those pernicious columnists (polemists to you, Henry) induding H. W. S., Jr., M. G., that old rascal Tee Pee, and Toby, himself. . iBut such is not the case; the new Senior Board has looked leniently upon the campus WincheHs and the bi- weekly gossip wil'l be dished out as usuaL Poor Don Walker is running himself ragged trying to get the names and measurements of all seniors who want caps and gowns. In fact, Don is so b.usy during chapel periods that he doesn't have time to find the hymns in the hym- nal. Wont all you seniors cooperate so the cap and gown part of Commencement will run off smoothly? (This is not an advertisement.) We wonder whether you all noticed the cute little write-up that TIME gave the college last week We think that Gerry Barnett, alias King Kong Jr., ought to take up with the editors the question of what the Keeper will put in the Jug. The public wants to know. Just to be different we thought we wouldn't say a word about the return of beer. We won't, but we have a little ballad that bears repetition.

Music By RANKINE IDNMAN Professor Tidmarsh's spring re- cital of nature music will be given Sunday afternoon in a program of relatively contemporary music. The spirit of the recital is ex- pressed in Schubert's \Am M:eer,\ avivid piece of imagery produced by a composer whom Liszt termed \the most poetic who ever lived.\ Never hesitating, rarely revising, often composing his best passages while conversing with a friend, Schubert wrote music with the spontaneitty with which we m~ght krite a letter. Devoid of aesthetic arti·fl.ces and novelty~ his volumin- ous production rarely attracts the listener's attention to technique. Freidrich Schorr sang this num- ber in Memorial Chapel last year and has also made a very beauti- ful recording of it., Paints,. Oils,.

There are few modern organ collections more widely esteemed than those of Karg-Elert, whose ingenuity in creating subtle tone I colour taxes both artist and instru- i==============dl ment In more dramatic numbers he has been accused of extrava- gance, but in \Landscape and Mist\ his mastery of contrapuntal devices, colouring, and technical structure are well controlled. His resourcefulness in harmonization frequently expresses itself in rich treatment of gro11nd bases. \Aux Etoiles\ by Du Pare was written as an orchestral nocturne. Du Pare, inspired and trained by Cesar Franck, has imparted .an un- surpassed power and impulse to native French melody-; his innate feeling for the dramatic, refined, • has . added to the strength of his · music. The music of Boisdeffre, com- pose·r of \By the :Brook\ which : Professor Tidmarsb will play, is. characterized by .elegance of style . although it is deficient in inven- tion. His eminence is primarily in the field of chamber music. The remainder of the pr<:>gram includes: \Nature.

Who is going : ·to check all these figures? · Some say the new system will eliminate deals ' while others are just as certain that a change ·wau:ld result in more deals. Since the organizaHon ·of th·e ·Student Council we feel that we can say i:hat there has been no deal within the Council. Such a statement is difficult to prove, but we 'have made every effort to ascertain this fa.ct. The new plan may and may not aid the neutrals and men from the smaller fraternities to secure a larger representation on the Coun- ·cil. The only way to find out is to try the sys- tem and see what happens. The Student Council could do a better job in making their nomina- tions. The fact that a man has been on the Council for a year or more, is no reason why he should be placed itt nomination again. Last year in addition to those who were carried over, the name of every other Councilman was placed on the top of the list containing the new nom-ina- tions.. It seems that some men might not do a very good job on the Council, and if they ate not fitted for these duties there is no reason why they should be renominated. •' THE CONCORDIENSIS, _FRIDAY, APRlL 25, 19·33 '· • NEWS FROM OTHER COLL£GES , .. ~ Bntrt 11au TGNSORIAL PARLOR Qiurler '' RINDFLEISCH rCLEANE;RS~DYERS ' ' \Q·Ilality First Since 1897'' AMHERST Gives Joint Recital with Mt ..

WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR Tlte fact that it is too late to put into effect the proposed changes concernin~ the nomination itnd election of :Student Councilmen this year niak~s it unnecessary and inadvisable tor the Stude'11t Body to approve the recommendations 01 the committee at the present time. Tne Student Council will have to pay atten- tion to the agih .. tion of the past few weeks, and wil1' undoubtedly use the greatest care in making nominations for. the coming ye:ar. It is qt):ite possible that a Council will be elected for next year that will meet· with the approval of the large majority o.f students. If s-uch is the case, there is absolutely no reason for a change in the present system, and those who now feel that the methods employ.ed are not democratic will be satisfied. If the new Council does not meet with the ap· proval df the majodty, the proposed system can be voted updn n.ext year. We can see no reason f<Jr the Student Body going on record as favor- ing a system ndW, which cannot he used for a. ' whole:! •year. Stud~nts are alway-s willing to make chang;es, but seldom do they think: of the conse- quences. Tile present Student Cound.l has tfot failed in any sense to perform its duties. It has -given ev~ry indication of having the interests of the college at heart .. and has done a real service to the Student Body. It must be admitted that our studettt government is not as democratic as it might be, but neither i.s it as political as it might be, and has bee11, until the present Council was htsfalll!d, There is alWay's a group of chronic complain- ers here who seem to feel that tney are not get- ting a s<J.Uare de:al. For this reason, they delight to tear down student organizatio11s. One of these dissenters ,proposed in Student Body meet· irtg oti Monday to do a.way witll, retaining mem- bers fr.om each class on the Student Council. The purpose of holding. over cer.tain men is ob- vious: the newly elected Council has men on it who already ha\''e a knowl~dge of their duties. One of the main reasons for taking legislative il)owen away £rom the Terrace Council was be- cause l.t was an entirely new' b.odv every year, and the Administration found it difficult to work with a group wli!ich was unfamiliar with campus affairs dul\ing tbe first few m<'lnths that it held .office. TWENTY-FIVE MINUTE ASSEMBLY Once again ha'Ve we been f<Jrced to sit in Daily- Assembly un'ti1 10:25 or thereabouts. There are two reasons. why, about twice a week, '\e have lo spend more than the allotted . tirne in the Cha:pel: the first is that. the entire Student Body is not seated pttornptly at ten . o'clock; the seMnd is that th~se who are in charge of ollr Daily Assembly do not take the n~ees'sary st~i)s to keep speakers Within their time limit of t~n minute$. It is not out\ purpose, at this. time, t9 discuss the mt!rits of those who deliver the Assembly addtesse·s, but '\il\e do object to. being for()ed to rem~1n in the CJiapel frotn live to li.fteen trilnutes ·overtime. IS· I?·AILY A.SSEM.BL v: POPULARl At least once a year atJ. ed:itoria'1 kppears in the columns of The Concord-iensis which diseus- ,ses smtre phas.e of our Assembly exer.cises. As 'long as we can remember s1,1ch' articles have not offere.d any; construcfive criticism, but it is ·al- ways admitted that the Daily Assembly could be imf:>roved decidedly, The.re has been 'c·onsiderab.Je comment re- cently about the campus, in fraternity houses and class rooms, ali>ou:t the present .situation, and very few students seem to care very muco:h for the type of e:x;ercises which b.ave been presented. Si,nce The Concordiensis is first of all an or- gan which expresses: student opinio.n, a .num,ber of stud-ents win be asked what they think of out Assembly as it is n-ow, and the resuhs wil·l be published on Tuesd<ay, THE 'TOOL OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL It has come to our ears lately tha:t The Con- cordi:ensis is nothing :more than the mouthpiece of the Student Coun dT in the eyes of some .stu- deflts. In view of .this cri:tiesm we feel .that we should repeat .th'e stand that we. propose to take in regard to the. student governing body. As long as the StU;dent Council continues to present the constructive legislation that it has irt the past, we will s'tand squarely behind it. If we <to not believe th~t it is doing what is best for ,t'he Student Body and the coHege, we will be the first to criticize it. · PEEPING THRD lHE \KEYHO.LE Good .evening; not that I cate, but I suppose that to be pleasant now and then is conducive ' to g-ood manners.

ABOUT A VAGR J\NT 'MHO CARRIES HIS BED WITH HIM- Those who were fortunate or unfortunate (take vonr choice) enou~?;h to pass by the chapel last Snndav morning- about ten o'clock would have ohserved a pathetic asoect of this oresent OPPrPc;sion. Just in front of the main door of the chauel was a bed with mattress and blankets. i'm sorry to state that the culprit had set the alarm for an early hour and those passing by at the above hour were deprived of seeing both hed and owner to-gether.

The new Teletypewriter Exchange Service-typing; by wire-is an example. For some years Private Wire Teletypewriter Ser- vice has speeded communication between separat~d units of many large organizations. Telephone men- anxious to make this service more widely useful- hav:e now established Teletypewriter central offices, through which any subscriber to the service may be connected directly with any other subscriber. Both can type back and forth- their messages being te· produced simultaneously at each. point. This new service provides fast, dependable com~ munication and does for the written word what tele .. phone service does for the spoken word.

Early .i:g the 17th century, t()bacco seed from America was taken to Turkey. Different soil, different climate, different temperatures night and day, and different farming methods produced an entirely new tobacco-small in size, but very rich and aromatic. Four certain spots are famous for the qualiry of-lheir Turkish tobaceo - Xanthi and Cavalla in Greece; Samsoun and Smyrna in Turkey. And it is principally from these places that our buyers get the Turkish for Chesterfield. These Turkish tobaccos are blended, in just the right amount, with Domestic tohac«Jos. It is this blending and cross-blending of just the right amount of Turkish and Domestic tobaccos which gives Chesterfield a flavor that neither p()ssesses alone. --tk ctfardh -that; Ni/ck. -/k etrardlc -#tat Tartu _Be&,.
