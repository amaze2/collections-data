Theile· a1·e points in f:avo-r of the ·columbia rna tch. The New York ·a.lumni are really en-: titled to a Union game in the Metropolitan a :rea. Then there is . 1 tll.e rnatter of guarantee. The guarantee given fD, Union by Columbia exceeds Union's entire ga..te receipts for .the re- mainder of the . season. Thus it pays to take a defeat from Columbia. And not to be omitted 1s the hope of the opftomists-. that someday Union ma.y come from :b-ehind, beat Columbia, and thel'eby gain prestige and renown for the not help feeling proud of the Iteam which rep- little e-leven from the 1\l()h.awk va:Ie.

Watching it intently is a man who has at his command instruments that measure to .oooos of an inch. The cylin.., der begins to yield ; he notes the weight. It snaps; he notes the weight. Disen- gaging it, he measures the stretch and diameter at the breaking point. These tests form a part of the l1J,OOO determi- hations Crane Co. makes on its own rna- . terials every year. 6 3 ,ooo of the tests are chemical; not one component from pig iron to limestone flux is charged in a Crane melting furnace whose suitability has not been determined by analysis. 6o,ooo a:re physical; not one hour's melt is drawn o:ff in a Crane foundry whose physical properties-. ten- sile, transverse, and torsional strengths, yield point, breaking point, elongation, and reduction ofarea are not known. By such exhaustive tests and by re- searches of scientists in Crane laboratories, a vasthodyofauthoritativedataon metals and their properties has been collected. It is embodied in a book, ''Pioneering in Science,\ which is an invaluable reference book for students.

They were most enthusiastically received by the English people. The spi-rit11als a•re the only fonn · of American folk songs. They con- stitute the negro's conception of the marvels of creation, and the stories of the Old and New Testa- ment. They grew out of the oppres- sion of the slaves before the Civ.iJ war. The negros have always been noted for their melody making and it wrus only natural that their brok- en spirits should find expression in song. Thus it was that a very beau- tiful and valuable addition was made to the world of American -.... music . The quartette is made up of Mr. Greekmur, first tenor; Mr. Bailey, second tenor; Mr. Thomas, baritone, and Mr. Wainwright, who will sing bass as he has in the past forty-four years for the Hampton quartette. The quartette sang last year for the Student body and was very well received. Their program included such song-s as \Daniel in the Lion's Den.,\ \Jonah and the Whale,\ \Noah and the Ark,\ and other tl:lnes which were mainly religious. -------01---- Hoosac Game With Freshmen Cancelled Slight Poss-ibility of Game With Utica Free Acad:emy For Saturday The Hoosac school cancelled its game scheduled for Saturday with the Garnet yearlings yesterday be- cause their first string line weighed on an average of one-hundred and thirty-five pounds. Manager Hagar is making every effort to arrange a game to re.place the cancelled one and there is a slight possibility that t'he Utica Free academy will accept the position on the frosh schedule. Coach Hyland has been putting the freshmen through stiff work- outs for several weeks and if no game is scheduled for Saturday they will be forced to wait another week until the R. P. I. frosh game to test their streQ.gth. The Utica Free Academy is s-upposed to have a much stronger team than the A non-partisan club of Union stu- Hoosac School has, and will pro· dents interested in the election of ·vide better opposition. To S«~c)l'e 'l'ouch!lown A scrappy Amherst eleven ripped through the Union li-ne Saturday and administered a 28:-0 defeat to the Garnet eleven. The Union team failed to show much of the power exhibited in last week's game against Columbia and the Lord Jeffs had little trouble in scoring two touchdowns in the firs:t period and one each in the second and .f;ourth periods. Union played real football only in the seeoncl ha.lf when the team threatened the Amherst goal twice, failing to .push the ball across by small margins each time. Early in the third quarter the Garnet made a drive that carried the ball from their own terri tory almost to Am- herst's .25-yard line when an at- tempted lateral pass from Lehman to Lippitt {)U the fourth down was grounded. Amherst kicked out of danger an<i Union's chance to score was gone. Again late in the third quarter a 'J)assing attack by Faulisi and Lippitt canied the ball to Amhe:l'st's 17-yard line. With only a few :minutes to play, Iverson attempted. a drop kick which, al- though weU placed, f€11 short of the mark. Amherst recovered the ball and the whistle blew before Union could regain possession of the ball. Tackling Ineffootive Union's tackling was slip-shod and ineff€ctive, the Amherst run- ners slipping throug·h the tackler's hands ancl gaining yardage even after being tackled. Fumbles were responsible -f,or the first touchdown . There were several bright spots, however, among the Union team's performance, the plaving of Cap- tain Foster, Adams, Cinella. Lippitt and Faulisi being outstanding. The punting of Lippitt was probably the best he has done this year. Cin- ella and Adams did sorne fine tack- ling and broke up a la-rge number of plays that were apparently head- ed for long- gains. Faulisi. entering (Continued on Page Three) -------<0------- Professor Smith of Geology Department Attends Convention :ple have always asked for proo·f of November 1-2:30 p.m.-(2) Delta God and the life beyond.

However, the production is of an ~ntirely different sort from \Spread• mg the News\ for it is one ·of the most famous one-act plays ever written. Play is a Drama In ·it Lady Gregory has forsaken the nearly boisterous gaiety of her pieces dealing with the distl'ict of CI9on, and has substituted a wist- ful, moonlit tenuousRess which transcends . the Irish b1·ogue and the full earth light of the peasants. And yet \The Rising. of the Moon\ isr not merely a drama of pretty po.esy; it ris·es to a s:implicity which 1s beyond the reach of most present day dramatic verse. !In fact one may divide the short plays of Lady Gregory, like those of other Irish dramatists, into two groups·; those that deal with close- ly observed Irish character and those which chime the greater soul of the folk spirit. \The Rising of the Moon\ drawn as it is in half- tone presents characters which e- vade ·definite individual anlysis. \The Rising of the Mooli\ was firs·t presented at the Abbey theatre· in 1907. For a while the play cre- ated much antagonism among the Irish. The fact that the policeman was represented as a coward and' a traitor caused the antagonism. But for a long time now it has been safely enshrined among the classics of modern Irish drama. · The cast will include only four characters. They are: Sat'geant, Carl C. Harbeck, '31; Ballad Singer, I. Willard Smith, jr., '33; Police- .1an X, Frederick A. Wyatt, '32; _>(}}iceman B,A. Jordan, '31. There will be no reserved seats for the production but since only a limited number of seats are avail.:. . J.ble to students, tickets should be r eS'erved by phoning Harry A.

BasketbaH Practice Will Start Monday . Team Will Be Built Around Cap- tain Livingston and Hota.liljl, of Las.t ¥ear's Quintet The first organized practice for the 1930-31 Varsity basketball team will be called next Monday, No- vember 3. The practice will be in charge of Coach William H, Hard- man and Assistant Coach \Looch\ ·Rinaldi. The .team this year will be built around Captain \Hack\ Livingston at center and Grover Hotaling and Douglas Brooks in the forward berths. These three are the only letter men remaining from last year's team. Others who are ex- pected to show good form al;'e Rosenthal, Cinella, and Norris, w·ho saw considerable service last season and also Hagar, Wallace and Alex- ander of last year's squad. Sophomm·e Material Go(tt;l In addition to these men, much, can be expected ftom the membet·s of last year's regular freshman team: Frank Hig-gins and Fr 1 ed Dill, forwards, Ackeley, center, and Harry Lillywhite and Bob Murray, Pi Delta Epsilon is sponsoring a new type of football program for .the Williams game, which will be .of a different type than the one published at the Vermont game. Jack Groet will manage the maga- zine. It will include more pictures and snapshots of the teams as well as line-ups and statistics of both football teams and the cross coun- ·try teams, and a summary of the important penalties and new rule3. ·guards. ·· The short story featured last week will be replaced by a humor- ous column. This tendency will be further exhibited in the Hamilton program, which appears November 15, at the last game of the season. This will be a special issue, and is expected to cover twenty-four pages. The program will be fea- tured by humor, and another Cod- man Hislop story. As a tribute to the men donning their football uni- forms the last time for Union, pic- tures of all the seniors on the team will be included. The price of the program has been raised to twenty cents in order to try to make up the loss of thirty dollars on the last program. -------0------- MI:NIATURE TEAM Lost by graduation were Captain Nitchman and Bob Bullard, guards. Bill Livingston, who completed the trio of stellar defense men of .Jast year's team has left Union. In commenting on the prospects for the coming season, Captain Living·ston said': \Although our schedule this year is an unusuaHy tough one, I believe that the team will enjoy a fairly successful sea- son.\ ------01---- NEW DUMMY INVENTED Bunny Oakes, head line coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers, has re- cently invented a new type tackling dummy. The new dummy, besides being portable and interchangeable, is capable of Jeturning to normal position after being knocked down. The important function of this novel dummy is that when it is hit hard, it has the natural reac- tion of a human being. ----·-o~------ STAMP COLLECTORS Coach Leonard Handicapped fu ; . plaY'ed thei.r second tie in touch ·Garnet Hill and Dale Team Winds Building Winning Team With footba:U Wednes.day.

M:iUer will probably be depended upon to do the diving for the Garnet this year. There have been no time trials ·thus far but Coach. Leonard ex- pects to hold some within the next few weeks. The results .of the in- terclass swims which wiU take place sometime in December will . determine to a large extent who will compose the varsity team. The tankmen from different classes have been practicing daily for these events during the past week. FI·eshmen Turn Out Since regular practice .started, a large number of freshmen have made their appearance at the pool. One of these, Angus Brown, a graduate of Morristown high school ·in New Jersey looks especiall;v promising in the 40 yard br~l:!,st­ stroke event. In high. school Brown was a star on tb.e swim- ming team of that institution.· Gordon Neese is another p.romising freshman. He was captain of the swimming team of James Madison high. school where he swam the 50 yard dash and the relay. Joe Maney is New Y <;rk state cham- pion in the 100 yard dash and Irv- ing Densmore has starred in sev- eral New York state long distance swims. Although the end of the football season is expected to add several candidates to the squad, Coach William Leonard would like to 13ee several more men out for the dashes. \There are good. oppor- tunities this year for any .ooan with an ability to swim,\ said Coach Leonard, \and J; wo11<Id IU!:e verv much to see more candidates in the pool.\ ---·0--- Many Opponents Successful During Saturday Contests .tape before any Dickinson harrier ·y 1 . w· . 11 M . comes in sight. . ear Ings .
