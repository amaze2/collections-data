Last ,vear, various campus agencies endeavored to find a suitable arrangement which would satisfy the demands of the greatest number of pet·- sons. Evidently, they all failed. There is l·ittle to be said for the present system. ;\lost of us realize the difficulties under which the administration i::; laboring. Most .of us agree that under the current class schedule there could hardly be a better time for the d<tib· asseml..Jlies. Hut most of us are Rot arguing· too strenuously over these aspects. Compulsory chapel has never been pop11lar \.vith the majorit.1: of students. Compulsory religious chapel is definitely unpopular. The largest part of the college is composed of veterans who reason that one of the thiRgs they fought for was the right to worship when, where, how, and IF they pleased. The present policy of the college seems to con- tradict these principles. When the matter was investigated last yem·, it was announced that an amicable agreement could be reached. It has been- for the authorities. Every day, more and more of the student body is showing a direct antipathy to the religious policy of the college. The resentment which now exists can never be allayed as long as the present system is enforced. At its reorganization meeting this week, the Student Council agreed to study the problem with an eye to making suggestions which might be acceptable both to the students and the administration. We feel, nevertheless, that there is little that can be done tmtil the element of force is removed. The vel'Y fact that we nmst attend a certain percentage of the religious chapels to satisfy the requirements for chapel attendance is utterly repugnant to the majority of the students. May I offer a solution which values. There is no doubt in the of negatioa is to :be useful, each should satisfy everyone.

Franklin St. BASKETBALL COACH With the football season barely opened, the campus tt·end of thought is already S\vinging towards the coming basketball campaign. J<'oremost in the minds of many Union men is the question of a coach. There is general dissatisfaction with the announce- ment that \Whitey\ Doehm will again mentor the Dutch courtmen. It seems to us that the complaint of the student body is not with the selection of J.\Ir. Boehm as a coach or as a man. The trouble stems from the realization that he will continue in the capacity of head coach for N ott Terrace High School's five as well as handling the assig-nment in Alumni Gym. Those of us who were here during the past year remember that it was necessar~· for :.\Ir. Boehm to absent himself from our games to preside at those of his high school team. It is our private opinion that this absence is directly connected to the fact that Union lost its last game to Trinity University after enjoying a half-time lead of ten points. It appears fairl~· obvious that Mr. Boehm could not have been receiving an adequate wag·e for his services. Had he been properly reimbursed, he probabl~- would have devoted more of his time to the Union team. Per- haps there was ample reason for not en- gaging a full-time coach last year, but why has the same arrangement been made for · the coming year? For a college of Union's prestige, there can be no excuse for not engaging a full-time coach. Other sports have been assigned their leaders. The college certainly is not so poverty-stricken as to necessitate this seem- ing budgeting. A good coach will mean much in determining the status of Union's team this yeal'. With the brand of opposi- tion which has been announced for the basketball team, there is a very real need for a coach who can and will devote his every effort to the task of training our athletes to meet Dal'tmouth and Colgate, to mention two of the outstanding opponents. They, cel'- tainly, have full-time coaches. In any case, it is onl:,~· fair to the students, io the team, and to the college that this situation be remedied. If Mr. Boehm is to be hired, let it be on a basis of complete participation in Union activity. If this can not be ananged the Athletic Department should find someone who can and will devote all his time to the college. Neither Union nor N ott Terrace will benefit from the present arrangement. CHEERS AND CHEERLEADING Last \veekend Union College's prestige dropped several points as the Dutchmen succumbed to the gl'idders of St. Lawrence. It was not the fact that we lost the game that lowered out· standing. Neither was it the fault of the team which was defeated. The blame for our degradation lies \vholly upon the heads of the crowd and the cheer- leaders. Never have we seen such an exhibition of school spirit as was given by Union College last Saturday afternoon. An irate alumnus wrote to us: \During the past weekend, I was present at this season's first football game and I am sorry to say that I failed to be impressed by the miserable cheerleading that went on. It was one thing to lead a crowd during the first quarter when there was no score, but another to lead when the chips were down in the second half. \I think that I might truthfully say that last Saturday was the first time that I ever saw cheerleaders lying down on the grass with no apparent interest in their duties. I might also add that when the crowd has to yell at the Leaders for a cheer, there is something radically wrong. \Besides this, the Cheerleaders persisted in using cheers which no one knew except a few Ft·eshmen. Even then, there weren't over two cheers that were worthy of repetition.'' Need we say more? Q. A.

Bill Howard, first tackle replace- ment on the Garnet squad, is in the hospital recovering from an emergency operation. We know that all of the students extend their b.est wishes for a speedy re- covery and appreciate the impor- tance of his loss to the team. Burnham Coaches Yellowjael{ets Outplay Larries Last week the situation was quite similar. We had 14 first downs to the Larries 4 when the statistics were tallied. Union was the better footbaH team fot· all but a few of the sixty minutes. But in these few min- utes St. Lawrence did a lot of damage. All-East halfback Jim Hefti scored a touchdown in the first and third periods. His first came on a lateral pass from Oscar Cochi, quarterback, when he romped 52 yards into pay dirt. The second came after he completed a forty yard pass to the Union 4. However, it took him two downs to make the four yards to the goal J.ine. Conversions were made by a pair of brothers, Jack and Bill Barron. Backs Carry Garnet Attaek Hal Enstice completed quite a few passes during the afternoon. Sometimes we wonder how he got so many passes off because the blocking was poor. It was nothing unusual to see as many as five scarlet jerseys tearing in on Hal. Ken Whalen gave a marvelous ex- hibition of plunging when he ripped the Larrie line to shreds in the second half. Ken hits like a bat- tering ram and spins like a top. Bob Bartlett was Union's leading runner with an average gain of four yards per try. LeRoy Siegel, speedboy of The Dutchmen's back- field gave a good account of him- self on several occasions. The Yellowjackets will be out to win this because this is their Alumni Homecoming weekend. Un- ion will be out to win this for two Rochester is coached by Elmer Burnham who is starting his third season at the school. Burnham coached at Purdue hefore receiving the Roehester assignment and turned out an undefeated team which took the Big Ten title. This year over 85 men came out for the initial footbail practice so Burn- ham is sure to have plenty of depth in his squad. The line is heavy but the backfield is very great guys, light. I-Ioward.

It seemed only fair that if the students of the college were required to conform to colleg-e rules of chapel attendance and if the series of concerts and lectures were to be included in the chapel program, there should he sufficient tickets set aside for the eBtire student body. When all stu- dents had had opportunity to receive their tickets, then and then only should the Facultr, the Freedom Forum, and friends of the college be allowed to apply for admission. These were om sentiments last week when the matter first came to our attention. We began to change slight!~· when we hectrd that there were a great number of empty seats because certain students had asked for and not used tickets. !\:ow, however, there has l.Jeen consider- ably more light shed on the subject. Figures from college authorities show that there were five hundred and eight:'-· tickets issued to students for the last concert. Of this Humber, slightly less than fou1· hundred were used. The obvious fact is that several hun- dred people who sincereb· wished to hear :.\larcel Dup1·e play were denied that privilege although there were sufficient vacant seats to provide for most of them. There can be no valid excuse fo1· those who drew tickets not retuming them or not using them. Perhaps the situation needs clarification.

I ber of students who mig-ht go far exceeds On N ovembet· 16th, Union College renews a rivalry which has become known as the \f<'l'iendliest Small College Rivall·y in New York State.\ That day, in Clinton, New York, the Garnet of Union will clash with the Hamiltonians in the closing football game of our 1946 season. For the occasion, the college authorities have declared a half- holida~· to enable all students who wish to attend to do so. In previous years, the friendly rivalry has been well publicized. It is customary to invade the opponent's campus in great strength. It has often been the case that the chee1·s of the visitors have exceeded in volume and spirit those of the home team. Usually, the home team holds its Fall Pt·om on the evening of the game and, customarily, lhe visitors me invited to attend. There is usually an Interf1·aternity Council contest for which the individual f1·aternities bedeck their chapter houses in many ways to in- dicate the spirit of \Beat Union! or Beat Hamilton!\ as the case may be. It is being planned that there will be a number of hired buses. Although the num- the capacity of the buses, there are many more private cars than at any time in the past. In 1941, near!~' J'om hundred Dutch- men made the eighty-mile journey to watch Union lose to a Hamilton team featuring ~lilt Janone, the \Hidden All-American\ and Forest Evashevshi, Michigan's great blocking back. In 1942, comparable numbers from the up-state college invaded Schenectady to watch their eleven hold a favored Union team to a tie in which Janone figured prominently. Since 1942, there has been no gridiron competition between Union and Hamilton. Now, howevee, the new era has dawned and Union again takes the field to meet her nearest rivals. In the coming ·weeks, thet·e ·will be more said on the subject. Of com·se, there will be the usualmllies to raise spirits to a fighting pitch. You, and You, and You, will be asked to join the Cl'Owd. Each of you owes it to himself and to the traditions which make up our small-college rivalry to get on the band- wagon and attend the game. Y ACHETY-Y ACHETY-KOFF-KOFF-KOFF No, that's not a new cheer soon to be heard on Alexander Field. Nor is it one of the more insignificant chemical formulae of the chemistry world. In plain words, that cryptic phrase is the prevalent sound at chapel each day. In other years, students have expressed thei1· displeasure at being· held over the allotted time for the daily lectures in exactly the same way. Others have made the same discourteous noises to the speakers of yester- year. Probably, despite what is said, stu- dents of tomorrow will misbehave in similar manner. The fact that others have done and will do the same things is no excuse for the actions of the students (who have been kicking about their rights as mature veterans and civilians) when they are inconvenienced for a few minutes because some misguided I talker has a bit too much wind. It is tn1ly a I t·evelation to stand at the rear of :\lemorial Chapel when the allotted twenty minutes have elapsed aml the speaker is appm·ently going to talk on foreve1·. First, there is a restless rustling as several hundred men peer anxiously at their watches. Next there arises a piercing whisper. Then, a volley of coughs which is astounding in its intensity. All in all, the situation is disconcerting. Why is it that alleg·edly mature men seem to grow younger and younger as they become displeased-when things are not going their way. Maybe the speakers are faulty, but there's no reason for the students of this institution to degrade themselves in the eyes of outsiders. How about a little courtesy in the future? 11 Wow!

A UNIT ·Of THE BELL - SYSTEM SINCE 1882 • FRIDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1946 Union Cheerleadi.ng Squad in re- gard to the St. Lawrence football game. Therein you state several main thoughts which are in .order of appearance: tal That the Cheer- leading Squrud was capable of lead- ing cheers 0nly in the first qua1·ter of the game when things were going well, and spent their time sitting down for the remainder of the game; lbJ that a crowd eager fDl' cheers shouted at the Cheer- leaders for them; ( c J that the Cheerleaders persi:;ted: in , using cheers known only t0 a few Fresh- men, and l:dJ that there weren't over two cheei s that were worthy of repetition. The first point mentioned is ob- viously d.one without thorough in- vestigation of aN pertinent fact,;. A thing which the Editor might tal1e heed of for .future notice as aH Editors are supposed•ly responsible for what is written in thek new~~ papers. The rema-inde!' of the story is mtt·ely the fact that Mel Heln requested the cheerleaders, who had given eight cheePs in the fil st qua·r- ter, to ·cut it down somewhat as the noise from the ·crowd, it was imposgible for the playtm to hea·r the signals. Therefore, in order to bl'ing this about, only three cheers , were given in the second quarter and six in the second ha<lf. If this is lettiFig down on tht job then I apologize. \The Cheerleading Squad used cheers known to only a few Fresh- men.\ To a great extent this is true, but WHY? Was it the fault of the Cheet·leading Squad? A copy of the cheers that were used at the game was reprinted in last Friday's CONCORDIENSIS, four hundred chee1' sheets were handed out at the Friday's pep rally, and 800 programs which contained the College Cheers we1 e sold at the game. I>S\ it then the fault of the Cheer- leading Squad that the cheers were not known? The only truth in the Editor's statement is that the Freshmen knew their cheers.

The meet wi.J! be a season opener for both teams, but Coach BiH Ketz hopes that his charges will ceme through in the form they have demonstrated in daily work-. outs and show their heels to the Vermonters. Ketz has worlied the Dutchmen hard this week. sending them over the regulation 4.7 mile course sev- era'l times. \Vednesday afternoon the team held additional time trials to determine the men who w0u!d run against Vermont tomorrow. Seven men have been selected to bear the Garnet colors in the race with the Green and Gold from the Green Mountains. Heading the roster is Newt Culver. Culver has paced the Un- ion S'!Uad since the initial practice some four weeks ago and gives pt·omise of rounding into an out- standing runner, He earned his Block 'U' with the 1944 harrier team and is likely to be one of the first men to hit the tape. Likely to fill the number two spot on the squad is Gil Hicks. This is Hiclts' ·first tryout in c·ross-country, but the experience he gained as number one miler 0n last year's track team has proven invaluable to him in the longer distance. Hicks is a steady plugging runner who relies more on sustained drive than erratic spurts to get him to the :finish line. Stan Coben, a freshman, seems destined to be among the first trio of Union runners to end the race. Cohen has been developing rapidly and may give Hicks a battle for second place honors. Another former Union long dis- tance man, Don Brightman, ap- pears to have a firm grip on the fourth spot. Brightman won a let- ter in 1944 and is back to continue his efforts in long distance run- ning-. George Middlemiss, also a former bearer of the Garnet in long dis- tance racing-, is fifth man on the Union roster. Middlemiss has been bothered with a bad foot and may not be up to par, but nevertheless, will be in there plugging. Rounding out the team are a pair of half-milers from last Spring's track team. Hal Larkin and F1'ed Steigert came through in the time trials to gain themselves positions on the team. Both these men have shown up well and look better at the longer distance than they did in the half mile. Pictured above are seven of the aspirants for starting positions on the 1946 Garnet Cross-cormtry squad. Coach Bill Ketz expects several of these men to pace the J>utchmen when they open against Vermont in Burlington tomorrow. In the usual order are Hal Larkin, Don Brightman, Bill Welsh, Strut Cohen, ,Jacque Cassidy, Gil Hicks and George Middlemiss. Other leading candidates who are not pictured are Newt Culver, Fred Steigm·t, Carl Byron and Bob Walker. _ -~Concordy Pho~o by Eva~n_R_ic_ha_r_d_s ----· Beta's Lead Intramural Football With Three Wins; In Semi-finals D Phi's or Psi U's To Meet Beta's After a little over a week of play,$-------------------------------- the intramural touch football sea- Results of games to date: Psi Upsilon (forfeit by Phi Delta son is almost completed, with Beta Delta Upsilon 24, Phi Sigma Delta 6 Theta) Th t P . a1 d d f 1 Chi Psi 2, Delta Upsilon 0 e a 1 rea y assure o P ay- Chi Psi 6, Sigma Chi 0 Beta Theta Pi 21, Kappa Nu 7 ing in the semi-final brackets.

Gridders Seek Win In Vermont Saturday The Garnet eleven wHl be seeking its fii·st win of the sea- son tomon·ow when it tackles the Yennont University grid- ders on the Catamounts home field in Burlington. The Dutch- men will be out to break the jinx which seemingly has dog- ged :.\le! Hein ::dFtce he began coaching here and hope to regis- tet· their first, and :\lei's first, win. L'nion dropped its sec- ond contest of the year to Tiochester last Saturday b.r a 30-14 tally. This wHl bC' the 17th conte:ot be-~ tween the two schools since the serie:' was originated in 1886. 01 the:ie Union has won nine, lost five, and tied two. From 193b until 1942 the Garnet won five, !0,;t one and tied one. This is an im- pressive record and Mel Hein will have the task of increasing the total of games won. The starting lineup for the Dutchmen wiJI probably be the same as 1t has been in the fi.rst two contests: Roy Westlund, left end; Tom Crone, left tackle; John Weis~. left guard; Brud Shaffet·, center; John DeBello, right guard; Bob Keane, right tackle; John Newton, right end; Bob Bartlett, left halfback; LeRoy Siegel, right halfback; and Ken W·hau•n, full- back. The blocking back po,;t wiH be a question mark right up until game time. Pete Spezzano, Charlie Dug- gan, and Pete King, are all nursing bad legs. If none of them is able to play, Rein will really have to dig down into his bag of tricks for a capable substitute. Both Spezzano and Duggan have played relief roles in the Garnet line this season, as well as playing in the backfield. Enstice Not Available Since Hal Enstice won't be avail- able for this game, Ken Whalen has been nominated to fill Hal's shoes. Last week Whalen had the same assignment and did a great job against Rochester. He played almost a full sixty minutes. During that time he threw close to thirty passes, one for the second touch- down, recovered a fumble, bloclted two attempted extra points, ran with the ball, and playe-d a fine de- fensive game. Undoubtedly he was the outstanding performer in the contest fm• either side. When he was taken out of the game, nearly 8,000 spectators rose to their feet and cheered in tribute to his fine Yellowjackets, operating from a well-timed \T\ formation, shook runne1·s away for long gains sev- eral time,;. In the second period, Don Diehl, the Yellowjacket scat- back went through our line for 64 yards and the initial touchdown of the aftemoon. Later in the same period a Yellcwjacket guard grabbed one of Bartlett's passes and romped to pay dirt from his own 40-yard line. At half time the score was 12-0. On the third play of the third period, Diehl again broke loose for a touchdown. This one was good for eighty yards. A few moments later another one of Bart- lett's passes was intercepted on the Union 30. Roch.ester half·back Bob Murphy took the ba!l through left tackle for the score. With the score 24-0 against them, the Dutchmen finally came to life. Whalen connected with three passes for a total of 51 yards. Bob Bartlett carried the ball over the goal line from the 2-yard marker for Union's first score of the year. Ba1tlett converted the extra point with Siegel holding the ball. After receiving the Union kick- off, Di.ehl and Garnish alternated in carrying the ball to the Union 31. On the next play Dragget caught a pass from Zimmer, In the end zone. That conc!uded the Rochester scoring for the day. Whalen Connects Again In the closing minutes of the game Whalen passed to Fucigna for a gain of nearly forty yards. Union moved the ball to the RochesteL· seven yard line but failed to score in four downs. Three plays later Whalen re- covered a Yel!owjack.et fumble on the Rochester 27. A pass from Whalen to Newton, who !ateralled to Layden, brought the ball to the game. four yard line. On the fourth Yellow Jackets Sting Dutchmen down Whalen connected with a Last Saturday Union invaded pass to Bartlett for the touch- the Rochester campus only t.o be I down.

The purpose of the dance is not pri- marily to make money, it was stated, but to gather fulnds for fur- ther like events later in the sea- son at which no admission will be charged. Therefore, the established price is being exacted of all who attend. No tickets will be issued. Instead, the cost will be collected at the door. Chairman Charles B. Grimes fur- ther announced that other week- end events will include Pep rallies today and tonight and Fraternity house dances at the same time as the main dance in the Gym. As a gesture of friendship, the students of R. P. I. have been invited to par- ticipate in the dancing. Band Rated High Music for the main dance will be furnished by Dick Cannon and his or·chestra. The Cannon group is a local or·ganization and has been very popular• with listeners in the past. During the past summer, the band furnished music for the grad- uation week-end dance held in Alumni Gym. Before the war, Can- non headed a band which was very much sought after for fratet•nity house parties. The Committee, therefore feels that complete satis- faction will be realized by all who attend. Decorations for the Gym are un- der the directio nof Wally Wiggins and will be very similar to those of the previous dance when fra- ternity banners were suspended about the balcony edge. Enstice Sppcial Feature A soda bar will be set up and soft drinks dispensed throughout the evening. As an added attrac- tion, Hal Enstice, Garnet star fu:l- back and all-around athlete will act as bartender. This noon, Jim Baar, captain of the cheerleading squad, and Pete BuUis led the students in cheers and college songs- in the hope that the complete unfamiliarity with these morale-builders, as evidenced by the cheering at Union's opening ,;arne with St. Lawr•ence, could be remedied. With the help of a student pianist, the cheer-leaders concentrated on Union's peppier songs in attempting to fire the spirit vital for te:1m morale and the obviously miesing student unity. Boufir!' Tonight Tonight, the entire campus is expected to turn out for the biggest rally of the year. A bonfire, pre- dicted to out-blaze its September pr edeeessor, will be the highlight of the evening's festivities. Ag&in the cheer-leading squad will have charge of the program. They plan to start the program with a. fight song and follow with all of the college cheers, Interspersed with more E·ongs. The speaker will be Bob Bartlett, star halfb\-ck of the powerful 1942 squad as wei las this year's eleven. Bartlett has acted as co-captain of the team in its games to date, along with Leroy Siegel. A returned veteran, Bartlett is one of the most popular £·tudents on campus and is ~xpected to arou£e the spirit of the student body to the necessary fever pitch. In contrast to the im- promptu mar·ch through State .Street to the headquarters of the invading Larries which followed the first rally, the students will travel by bus to the \Collar City\ campus immediately after this> bonfire. Fl'e.slunen Provide Kindling As might be expected, the Fresh- men, urged on by the Sophomore Disciplinary Committee, are pro- viding the crates for the fire. Newly organized, the Committee is de- termined to demonstrate its powet· by rewarding the frosh according to their individual participation in building the bonfire. There is every reason to hope that such a well-planned and well- attended rally will bring back the pre-war school spirit, missed by alumni and students- alike an.d sorely needed by the grid squad. The International Relations Club recently announced its officers for the year. They are Jack Tway, president; Eugene McMahon and John T. Hallahan, vice-presidents; Neil Hayes and Ralph Nestle, sec-~ retaries. Mr. Joseph Finkelstein,. instructor in History was named 1 assistant to the faculty adviser. Dr. 1 .T. D. Doty, professor of Histor;y· is 1 the faculty advise!'. The work of the club for the 1 term was inaugm·ated by a joint ! meeting with the recently formed i Society of Pr·e-Law Students. At 1 this meeting Dean Andrew V. 1 Clements of the Albany Law School1 of Union University was the guest 1 speaker and his address on the 1 legality of the Nuremberg Trial 1 was attended by a capacity audi- ence. The subsequent programs of the club, as announced by the officers, will follow the central theme. Foca-l Points in American Foreign Policy. In successive meetings the club will hear speakers deal with American policy in relation to Europe, the Near East, the Far East, and Latin America. A dis- tinguished specialist has been <'hosen for each topic and as a re- sult of the series a complete view may be obtained of American in- terests abroad. The climax of the term's work of the club will come in the par- ticipation of the club in the Mid- dle Atlantic Conference on U. S. Foreign Policy to be held at Vassar College at the end of November. Union College representatives to this conference have been an- nounced and they are Jack Tway, John T. Hallahan, and Mr. Joseph Finkelstein. These representatives will act as discussion leaders and members of panel discussions. The sponsor of the Middle At- lantic Conference at Vassar College is the Carnegie Endowment for In- ternational Peace with headquar- ters in New Yflrk. This endow- ment also acts as the general sponsor of the Union College Club. The sponsor advises the local club, furnishes literature and other aids and from time to time makes a speaker of national reputation available. The club generally meets every other Friday in the English Read- ing Room in Bailey Hall. ----0---- NOTICE There will be a meeting of all those interested in working on the Garnet (the college yearbool{) Mon- day evening, October 21, in the Student Activities office, at 7:30· P.M. ---~.

The regular meeting was held Monday evening with the tempo- rary officers succeeding themselves into office. School spirit and plans for this week-end were discussed. DamagE• Costly In past year,;, costly damage to college property was incurred as a result of over-enthusiasm in the rivalry with RPI. The Student Council made plans to avoid repeti- tion this year. A luncheon was held with three members of each college in attendance and it was decided that RPI is to paint the Unicn Idol while Union is to re- strict its activities to the score- aoard and goal posts at Troy. The most heated discussion was that on the subject of school spirit. It was the opinion of many that Unicn students lacked a sufficiency 0f this spirit although many other :olleges find themselves in the >arne condition at this time. Union Pride One of the reasons offered was that the Union students are ashamed of being Union men. Some appear to be ashamed be- cause Unicn hasn't the name and reputation that some of the larger colleges have. Others thought the staff lacked illustrious professors Still others felt that shame might stem from the football record and from athletics in general. Tbe point that Union doesn't rank in the top of the list of colleges scholastically was dispelled by the presentation of Union history and the fact that her new curriculum stands among the best in the country. This is the second in a series of after-game dances sponsored . by the Delphic Society, a leadmg group on the campus. The first dance, held after the St. Lawre'?-ce game, was attended by over f~ve hundred people desipte cancellatiOn of a Union-SkidmOI'e joint part~·· Chairman Grimes feels that this dance will be better than th~ last and hopes to see tomorrows at- tendance far exceed that of the St. Lawrence week-end.

The council agreed that such a con- dition is, in itself, damaging to school spirit. Sever·al committees were appoint- ed to look into the question. One of these committees met with President Davidson and reported excellent results. Saturday, Oct. 19 - FOOTBALL, f A I' t Union Vs.

'I'his year and for some Earlie1· thi:::; year, we proclaimed in loud voices that the new era at Cnion had beg-un. There were ample students to fill all the campus posts rising from the debris of a \\'ar-time college. Thei'e appeared to be a rebirth of the spirit which chamcterized the Dukhmen of old. In short, th<> future looked bright. ~ow, with the :::;emester but five weeks old, the coming year appears, at least to us. darker than has been the case in many a day. Student morale is at a dangerously Jo,,· ebb. An ill-cho:::;en word is often sufficient to set off a flow of vituperatives which a J:<'irst Sergeant would envy. ~otlting seems to go well. To begin with, the ::;emester opened with high pru:::;pects for the various activities. Fo1· the first week m· :;o, everyone ntshed about with the old \Joe College\ attitude. Student leaders were swamped with the responses to their pleas fm assistance. Everyone was engaged in some activity. Even those un- fortunates who commute from such points as Saratoga. Alb<m~'. and Troy gave ever:.· spare moment tu the pursuit of extra-cur- ricular employment. That was the first week. In the second seven-day period, things began to slacken off a bit. ~ot alarmingly-in fact, at the normal rate. There were the u:::;ual number of men out for the football team. Several late-starters were rewmded with enough personnel to warmnt extensive plans. The :::;ituation was still :::;eJ·ene enough. Friday night rolled around-the night before the first football game. There was a rally held on Council Field. The turnout wasn't bad I !lit !Jl'o\'l'd a di:-;appe~illtllll'llt to tho~l' \\'II<' expec.:ted a lllLH:h larger pen:entage of ou1· ~\\ollt•n student 1>11(1~·.

Perhaps the night before HAD been strenuous, but the crowd, which attenrled the g·ame. even in- eluding the many outsiders, far outnumbered that of the rally. Cheers which have been used at Union for many a year we1e severely mishandled. They may not have been good cheers, as we said in previous mention, but they were not even whole-hem-ted. If we see111 unjust to a few. let us say that there v.:ere the usual few who put every bit of energy they had into their cheering. But, the vast majority of the overflow crowd either did not know or did not care enoup;~, to exert themselves to encouraging a de- feated but not beatPn Garnet team. There is no need to keep up this dolorous account. All of us realize that there is some- thing lacking in the student body. What is it'? Obviouslr, the will to do or to help do for and with the college. It is eas:> but not pleasant to enumerate some of the growing tendencies. The foot- ball team, probably the outstanding· current f ea,ture of extra-curricular activity, is being upbraided on all sides by men who cannot or will not see the squad's side of the picture. The team, on the other hand is thoroughly disg-usted, to all reports, with the conduct and attitude of the Administration and the student body.

The Story of DICK PORTER LET THERE BE LIGHT JT is typic~! of Dick Porter's experience that his It's about time some appreciation of the new system of lighting in ~ott :\lemorial Library was expressed. The present semester is fiYe ·weeks old and, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no mention made of this very important factor in more com- fortable studying. To the new students, the innovation is ]()st. They haYe not had the rather dubious pleasme of pouring over musty hooks by the light of inadequate, antiquated incandescent globes. They have not felt the eyestrain which was an almost inescapable scourge of anyone who spent length~· periods of time in the library. Those of us who were here in past terms noticed or should have noticed the new lights. There is a distinct difference in the present system >vhich makes it more than better. It is incomparable with the old system. In previous aa~·s, the library was lighted mainly by the hanging globes which dangled high above the study desks shedding rathH dubious rays upon the books of students, faculty, and visitors. On the second float., there was not even the degree of light which was afforded the ground story. On the third floor and higher, there was no light to speak of. Now, the recently installed fluorescent lamps give ample light with a minimum of strain. Suspended immediately over the· study desk, their rays are disseminated without glare to the satisfaction of all who work there. The second floor has not, as yet, been modernized. Librarian Helmer Webb has wanted better lighting for some six years but it was not until this summer that his desires were realized. He feels that the improvement is doubly important in these days due to the increase of students which leads to very crowded quarters. In this light, the library is fast being utilized as a study hall. Althoug·h the library lighting is far from completed, there is little doubt in our minds that the new system will pay dividends in the fcrm of less reluctance of the student body to spend han evening at their books. I· \And light t ere was . \ latest asstgnment, that of experimenting with such \guided missiles\ as the V-2 rocket, is almost a complete engineering departure from his earlier fields of concentration. As a senior at the U. of Kansas in 1934, his in- terest was in radio. His doctor's thesis at Yale in 1937 was on frequency doublers. But at General Electric Dick found opportunity to learn other phases of engineering. In G-E engi- neering courses and \on Test\ he worked out prob- lems in transformers, induction motors, oil circuit breakers. His first major assignment with G.E. was in a field not only new to him but to the electrical in- dustry-he contributed to the pioneer research in amplidyne control. As the war progressed, flight engineers began to dream of the Superfortress, whose gun turrets would be turned electrically, whose heavy guns would be aimed electronically. Development of this gunnery system called for a supervisor whose en- gineering knowledge ranged through many fields It was Dick Porter, less than ten hard-workin~ years. out of Kansas U., who drew the assignment. Thts year he was presented with the Yale Engi- neering Association's award for the advancement of science. Next to schools and the U.S. Governmenl, General Electric is the foremost employer of college engineering graduates. For his campus radio station, Dick built studio end transmitter equipment. Today he is proiect engi11eer in the study of captured V-2 rockets.

Cunningham Early Call an Innovation The early call for cand·idates which was issued by Coach Whitey Boehm is be'lieved to be an innova- tion for Garnet teams. In former years practice was not begun until footbaU season had ended. which gave little time for dr.i\ls 'before the opening con test. Several of Union's oppcnents, RPI included, have made extensive plans for this season and have at least a week of intensive practice under their belts already. Thus, Union should be on a par with these squads when it meets them. A number of veterans of former Union fives are on hand and should make this yea·r's team the strong- est ever to represent Union on the court. At least nine lettermen are back and the presence of a large number of experienced players on the campus should bolster the cagers. Nin<\ J..etterm<\n Here Included among the lettet·men are Hal Enstice, Whitey Markes, \Harp\ O'Neil, Bob Webster, Bob Plunkett, Norm Schwarz, \Mule\ Haas, Bob Stegeman, Bob Bartlett. Jim Schultz and Jim Pemerick are another pair of candidates who have been driHing daily and have hopes of gaining varsity berths. Boehm will take over his second i season as coach of the Dutchmen. I Last year he started coaching three ·I days before the first game and ! managed to build a team which l won nine out of 17 contests.

May Join l'l\inceton RPI at Durham Rivalry Be-gan in '86 This contest will be a continua- tion of a football rivalry which comrr.enced back in 1886. That was in the middle of the era which featured the mustache cup and the flying wedge. Two Formations Mel Hein will be throwing his Giant \A\ formation and a single wing attack at the visitors. Mel is still trying w break through the jinx which has pursued him during his first eight games as coach. This may be the week. The entire stu- dent body is pulling for the :='quad in this game ·because it is the one game that really matters. The team, too, is out to win this one. They are going into the game with very high spirits which often spell the difference between victory and defeat. Every man .on the squad is going to do his bes-t to win for Union and Mel Hein. Mel is a great guy, and the team seems to think a lot of him. The best way they could possibly show him how they feel is to beat RPI. If we make up our minds to beat RPI we can do it. A victory over the Engineers would mean a lot towards having a successful season. It is true that the present Union r·ecord is not .one .of which the school c~n be proud. While we have been absorbing three setbacks, we have run up 36 first downs to our opponents' 27. In each of the three games we J.ost, our opponentS' scored on long explosive dashes and pass interceptions. Vermont capi- talized on our passing by making seven interceptions. Union haS' thrown 92 passes in the first few games so we can look for a wide open aerial a;ttack. So far all of the breaks have fallen against us. If our luck changes it wil be an enjoyable ball game . . . for Union student:='. Duke University has extended an invitation to the Dutchmen and to the Princeton and RPI tens to visit Durham during spring recess for a few conteste. Negotiations for a m1: tch with Duke in Schenec- tady in Apt•il are still pending. Two JV contests with RPI have been booked on a home and home basis. In addition, the varsities of the two scho.ols will meet. Since that first game, the out- come of which is still disputed, Union has· chrlked up 31 wins, 8 losses, and 4ties-. This is one .of the oldest rivalries in the history Same Line-up of football. Union beat RPI in Mel Heln will probably start the 1942 by a 38-6 score.

Ba.ar In its bigge.t postwar w.eekend to date, the Union campus ·rocked with the excitement cr·eated hy the innurr.erable acHvities in full swing from last Friday to the wee sma' hours of Sunday morning. Some· of the more questionable activities were even seen to be continuing und<.r the Northem Lights early Sunday evening. This, however, is· not of any particuLr news value, be it of any human iPterest va•!ue or nol. It all began last Friday noon when one of the rr.or e interesting activities to try to follow, a spry youth by the name of Jim Baar, appeared as the feature attraction of the daily assembly program .. For· want of a script, Mr. Baar ran through the college cheers and. songs with .the help .of Pete Bullis, a member of the cheerleading :oquad. Gesturing wildly, the pep- pushers were assisted by a member of the temporarily displaced Glee Club at the piano as they asked for a bit rr.ore at-ease quantity and less of the pr·eviously strained qual- ity in the melodic efforts of the student body. The p.oint-happy stu- dents shouted to the great satisfac- tion of both themselves and the hub and spoke revolving on the stage. Bonfir·t\ Snuffed Arising to all occasions Captain Baar had !l!lOO scheduled a pep-rally and bonfire for Friday night, but a monkey wrench in the person of several disillusioned pseudo-survey- ors from Troy lost their slide-rules and showed up near the Idol carry- ing buckets .of paint, brushes, and fine heads of hair. They dirtied their brushes with ugly cherry paint, sadly enough, so seve.ral of the more enterprising Dutchmen decided to make new brushes ~rom fine, soft human hair. Rejecting three boys with apparent scalp diseases, the amateur barbers hacked off several pushbrooms' worth and sent the boys to closets and rodent residences at various spots on the campus. At about this time, \Our Heroes\ returned fwm the \cliff they call a campus,\ where the prognos- ticating engineers had foreseen their colleagues' plight and had collected en.ough hair to provide wigs for their shining skulls upon their return. Seeing a possible monopoly in this particular natural resource, they also took enough to sell to any shaggy dogs who hap- pened to be wandering through the streets of Troy. And Still the Wonder Grew Arising the next morning greatly saddened by the cancelled pep rally, Captain Baar resolutely set out to gather together slx real Skidmore girls to provide background for the afternoon's performance at Ale;-- ander Field. Given this shot m the arm both the footba11 squad and the ~heerleaders gave their all. <Sex rears its ugly head) The day was becoming a success.

Early Saturday morning 6000 handbills were drop- ped from the air over ·RPI and Troy proper by a local fraterna~ group headed by Bob Reed of r:ln Delta Theta bearing terse predrc- tions on the afternoon's activities.

GARIS, Dean Management Labor Talk Interesting G.E.'s Pr:nce Opens UCCA Vocations Program; Blake, Sanitarian Director, Next General Electric Vice Pt eddent David C. Prince's talk on \Choos- ing Your Life's Work\ last Wednes- day evening in Old Chapel proved very interesting and enlightening to those who attended. After his formal lecture the affair bee\ me an Open Forum, and for over two hours he answered questions fired at him by an eager audience. Mr. Prince has held var·iou:? en- gineering and executive positions with General Electric since he joined the company in 1913, <tnc' wcs very well qualified to lecture and answer questions on manage- ment and industry. His •·aried career has included positions in the Railway Motor Divi!o\ion. Radio De- partment, Research Laboratory, .Switchgear Department, Commer- cial Engineering Section, the Ap- plication Engineering Section and the General Engineering and Con- sulting Laboratory of which he is now Vice President. In his formal address he dis- cussed the factors that influence and control prices in the electrical industry, relations between man- agement and labor·, and the scien- tific approach to management. In this last item he explained that prospective candidates for man- agerial positions are more li!{ely to be found in n:en that have a scien- tific or analytical approach to man- agement problems than those who are merely \pep-talkers\ or who have no other qualification th·n a pleasing pers-onality. He amplified on this by saying that industry is beginning to realize the value of aptitude tests to see that workers are placed in the jobs for which they are 'best suited, and that much more can be accom- plished by teaching foremen and s-upervisors how to get along with men than by strict forceful means. Mr. Prince also stl·essed the fact that a serious shortage of scientists ~nd engineers now exists, and that it will be fully five years before the supply meets the demand. The op- portunities for graduates during that time will be tremendous. At the completion of his talk Mr. Union College are going to have the first home coming ia four yea1·s on the weekend of Novemue1· 1, 2, and 3. All the Alumni and their families have been invited. From the re::~ervations a!l'eady placed this will be the gTeatest Home Coming in the History of the Graduation Council. There will be many features of attraction in this crowded v. eekend. Friday afternoon Alumni will be given opp01'lunity to visit recita- tions and laboratories that are being held that afternoon. Friday night there will be the important meeting on admissions in Hale House. Saturday is a very crowded day billed with big attractions. The Alumni in Education are inaugurat- ing a series of meetings. Their first meeting will be Saturday morning at 9:30. The college wlll be represented by Pre~ideont Davidson, Professors Chillrud and Axtel '34. of the Teacher Tt·aining Staff; Mr. Ripten '28, Director of Admissions; Mel Hein and Fred Wyatt '32. All the faculty have been invited to at- tend. The fall meeting of the Gracuate Council will be held at 10:00 in the Trophy Room in the Alumni Gym- nasium. Representatives of every class since 1885, representatives-at- large, and veterans are to attend. In the after·noon the Alumni will he honored by watching Union de- feat Williams. After last week's game with RPI, the chances seem high for this victory. The final big event of the week- E'nd will be the meeting of the Gift Fund Agents and Solicitors. Last year's Gift Fund Canvas, as great as it was, still is not high enough for satisfaction. All the Student Activities and Fraternities are expected to have open house during the weekend. Class projects are to be on display. The aim is to show the Alumni just what Union is doing in its first postwar year.

Dear Editor, It is indeed a sorry affai.r when people legally assigned to reserved seats in the stands on Alexander Field must stand in 0rder to see each play. This is exactly what happened at last Saturday's game with RPI; the first three rows could see practically nothing be· cause of the children, dogs and adults with no seats who lined the field ft•om the players' bench to the end zone. As the first three rows had to stand to see what was a:lso forced to rise te see ave!• those at least know when to cheer; I do in frent of them. Even complain-· not thi·n:k this an unreasonable ing to the policemen s1:1pposedly on request. How !!bout it? duty served only to get a few intermittent 'heads lowered.

LET'S TONE IT D·OWN Last week, Union met R.P.l. in the fortr- fourth gmne of a fifty-year-old series. Last week, Union annexed he1· thirty-second vic- tory against eig·ht for the Troy Tech boys. Last week, the iB.jmies to the Union squad were held to a minimuHl. All this is very fine. We're glad that the1·e has been the long rivalry between the two schools, that Union eme1·gecl victorious, that no one \Vas hurt in the game. But, the1·e is another side to the whole affair. In past years, the amount of pre-game damage has been considerable. The Troy campus, as well as our own, has been painted up by invaders who cared not how much damage was done. The issue came to such a stage that there was dmtger of the rela- tionship between the schools being cancelled. This year, the respective Student Councils met and agreed that painting should be re- stricted to certain designated points on the various campuses. To all r~ports, this re- stricti0ll W<LS observed. Several R. P .I. men were apprehended by alert !Dutchmen and the usual penalty (The block-U haircut) carl'ied out. Several Union men were caught b;v the R.P. I. guard and the corresponding- haircut was administered. There was a general good humor about the preparations and the stn1ggle. But, there was at least one incident which might have ended in tragedy to ~~n concerned. On some night last week, a Union student traveled to Troy to keep a date with a girl from Russell Sage. During the course of the evening, the man and his date were accosted by sevet·al men identified as R.P.I. students. Possible trouble was averted for the moment but later the same night, while the Union man was driving back to Schenec- tady, he was forced from the road after repeated efforts had failed. He states that the car which did the forcing drove without headlights and made no effort to remain on the scene when his car was forced out. It is but shee1· chance that no one was injured. Another incident which happened on the Union campus involved a car from R.P.I. which drove onto the college gTounds. When a number of Union men appeared to surround the car, tl~e driver threw it into reverse and backed rapidly away - obviously without proper precautions for anyone standing in the rear. Again, it was once chance which · kept someone from being injured. There have been other events in past years which might well have ended in tragedy. Last year, R.P.I. men came over to the campus and kidnapped a man from the Sigma Phi place in his pajamas and dropped him at a hospital in Troy. His room-mate was severely beaten when he attempted to resist. There are other like incidents-Union men were shot at when they attempted to paint the R.P.I. campus last year. That, to our best knowledge, has never been the case when Union was invaded. In the light of these mishaps, would it not be best that all relations with the Troy school be severed ? If this exhibition of violence is to continue, it would be far better to call a halt before someone is killed or severely injured in \harmless rivalry pranks.\ We feel that our rivalry with R.P.I. is secondary at best. If they, and we, cannot act with a minimum of common sense, let us end the root of the evil and break completely with them. After all, we believed that Hamilton was our closest and dearest rival Why bother with R.P.I.? STRIKE UP THE BAND It's about time that some c11edit was given to the group of musicians who gather several times weekl;y to rehearse and then appear at Alexander Field to pla~· for the home foot- ball games. For years, this OI~ganization has been the brunt of everyone's sour humor. For years, the efforts put forth by Prof. Charley Male and his son Charley, Jr., have been belittled. It has often been the custom to regard the band as a noisy evil which persists in appearing periodically to torture our ears with misplayed and ill-chosen num- bers. It is, however, easy to scoff at the efforts of others. Back in 1935, members of the CONCOR- DIENSIS evidently felt somewhat the same as we do. In the September 20th issue the editors printed an editorial entitled TREASON. We repdnt it in part because of the close parallel to the present situation. \Union College has a band. \Not all colleges have bands. Some hire professional bands at considerable expense to play for football games, parades, and such occasions. Some have no band at all. \But Union's band is made up of students. They play because they like to, and because in playing, they participate in the life of the college. At a football game, the band is a part of the college in the same way that the cheering section, or the team itself, is a part of the college. \We are not usually inclined to condemn the whole team when one player fumbles the ball. Why not give the band the same kind of loyalty? \We personally, like to whistle. Some- times we whistle off key, but there are som£ tunes we would rather whistle ourself than listen to them over the radio. Union's band playing the Dutchman Song sounds better to. us than Sousa's. Perhaps this is treason.\ What do you think? Most of the student body is now behind the football team after the win over R.P.I. last Saturday. The cheering-squad is riding high on the crest of enthusiasm waked by the girls from Skid- more. Only the band has been forgotten. Last week, the band sounded better to us than it has ever sounded in the past. Perhaps they are a bit slow on some of the college songs and perhaps there is a bit of discord from time to time. But, there is no denying the fact that Union has a band and there is no denying the fact that the band is eager to do its bit. Now, it's up to the student body to give this member of the college family of activities the eBcouragement that it deserves. Next time the band plays-for a rally, in chapel, at a game, or just in rehearsal, give it the credit you would want were you a member. How about it? U. C. R. S.
