In a two hour session before leaving for a ward meeting in Albany, McNamee clarified Senator McGovern's positions on such. topics as foreign aid, agrict\!lture and busing, which he said \is the price we have to pay for 200 years ofsegregation.\ McNamee feels that the 1972 Democratic convention will not be a repeat of the 1968 one, in which the delegates did not follow th.e anti-Humphrey sentiment of the primaries.

A year has passed since the preceding words were written, and College governance structures have been operating under the \substance and spirit\ of the Report's proposals for more than two terms. Perhaps now is the time to make a tentative evaluation of the effect of the Governance Report upon the College, indeed to examine the extent to which structural innovations have changed the basic situation here. In one sphere the framers of the Governance Report have seen their aspirations realized; structural change has occurred with a thoroughness and rapidity in sharp contrast to past College practices. The College Senate is the premier campus legislative body, students sit as associate members· on the Board of Trustees, committees have been added and rearranged, and there is now a much clearer definition - ~ -. -M-ohawk Indian Speaks On Campus by R. TREAT RINEAR, .JR. Last Wednesday night, a chief of the Mohawk nation spoke to members of Prof. Stinebeck'~ Comp. Ed. class. Chief Lawrence Lazore, a Mohawk by birth and a member of the Iroquois Confederacy, made the 200 mile trip from the St. Regis Reservation on the Canadian border, to talk about what it meant to be an Indian in today•s white America. He started his talk by telling how he, after 22 years in the 0 .S. Navy and 5 years as an electronics engineer, had returned to the reservation, the place of his childhood. He nad fought in the Navy, not to protect our land or our homes, but his own, for this was not our land in the first place. \Tbis land once belonged to the great Iroquois Confederacy. It was the Iroquois constitution that served as a model for your own government,\ he claimed and cited a speech by Benjamin Franklin as corroboration. , He went on to say how as an engineer he made $15,000 a year, had two cars in the garage and a comfortable home in Connecticut, \but something was misSing. I was feeling my roots.\ He gave up his job and returned to his people, \and now I am rich, although I have no money:• What do the Indians want'? Most of all they want autonomy. They are a nation and they want to be considered such. \We don't want the white man coming on to the reserve and telling us What is good for us.\ Moreover, he pointed out, the State of New York has no jurisdiction over the Indians within its borders. .He read from letters from the Attorney General of New York LAWRENCE LAZORE and from the federal government which said it was unconstitutional and illegal for the state to make treaties, and yet, this is precisely what is occurring. When he finished this talk, he answered some questions from the audience, one of which dealt with tl}e militant faction of traditionalists on his reserve. He responded that he disagreed with them, for, \this is not the Indian way.\ And, well aware of political realities, he feared that those whites who sincerely want · to help, \would be turned off by so much hate. I do not hate you ... you shouldn't feel bad for what your ancestors did to us.\ It is not the past that can be changed for \the Great Spirit has taken yesterday away.\ Nor is it the future for \we do not know if the Great Spirit will give us tomorrow.\ It is today, the Continued on Page 8 of the formalized role of students and faculty within the decision- making process than previously. Both one year ago and today, campus opinion concerning the Report seems generally favorable; though some would have been happier with more sweeping reforms, many in positions of power were reluctant to appPove meaningful reforms. Thus, the Governance Committee's accomplishment in creating a new model an<;! successfully pressing for its approval should not be downgraded. However, one must return to perhaps the most crucial question, that suggested in the quote which appeared at the beginning of this article: Have the changes succeeded in altering the formerly prevalent mood of \faculty and . student alienation?\ The answer at this stage is in the negative, for in translating the Governance Report into reality substantive structural transformations have .not been matched by psychological or spiritual adjustments, with the result that the present system seems at times to be a body without a head. ·Some activists within the ranks of .the .faculty have. chargm that the administration has been .guilty of at least one clear violation of the governance model's operating procedures. The case cited concerns the appointment of deans. In discussing the proposed role of the Liason and Governance Committee. the Report states that \On occasions when vacancies for major academic- administrative posts occur at the level of academic deans or above, the committee shall determine procedures (Report's emphasis) for review of the candidates by faculty and students.\ Several months after these words were written President Martin appointed Martin Lichterman and Charles Olton to dean positions. This may not be an actual violation of the governance model, for the Trustees have yet to approve constitutionally changes in the governance system. However, an action of this nature does appear to violate the Governance Report in spirit, and may undermine hopes for greater harmony between faculty and administration. In all fairness it must be-added that if the Report has been violated in spirit this has been caused as much by the acquiescence of students and faculty as by administrative aggressiveness. There are· occasions, for instance, when members of the College Senate seem unwilling to shoulder the new responsibilities and fulfill the new opportunities which have been created. Some representatives seem almost if by instinct to defer -to executive authority, perhaps because of a combined~ timidity and fatalism bred by past experience. It should be obvious that no parliamentary body can function effectively without assertions of its independence, but there are those... who, appear wjlling to let their statuatory powers attrophy rather than risk conflicts with administrative authority. One might argue that the problem of governance at Union simply serves to reflect a basic feature of the campus - apathy. Indeed, a high degree of student activism and interest in governance has been lacking, and there is an underlying suggestion that most students will never care enough to work diligently through structures. But the question remains open, and the fundamental success or failure of the Governance Report cannot yet be fully assessed. Rosenfeld Speaks Of Nixon Policies byTIM CAIN \Nixon on the Summit Trail\ was the name of Stephen S. Rosenfe!d's talk, and it was originally scheduled for the auditorium of the Social Sciences building. However, when it became apparent that a smaller room would be more appropriate for the a1:1dience of twenty people that were present last Tuesday night, the talk was moved to the Faculty Lounge, upstairs in the same building. Tuesday was only the second day of the spring, so the poor turnout could perhaps be attributed to the lack of opportunity for promotion and publicity for the talk Rosenfeld is a Harvard graduate with a masters in Russian history from Columbia University. He began his journalism career in 1955 with Pittsfield;s \Berkshire Eagle,\ and · is a former Moscow Correspondent for the Washington Post, He is now a foreign affairs columnist for the Post, and he also writes for the paper's editorial page. The beginning of Nixon's term in office marked \the end of the era of confrontation,\ Rosenfeld said, \and the beginning of an era of negotiation.\ This era of negotiation has not really been defined yet, he pointed out. \We realize now,\ he continued, \that the United States cannot enforce its will on the rest of the world. We are now aiming at achieving some kind of 'strategic parity,\' Rosenfeld said. He questioned whether ~ixon is attempting to arrive at a \true detente,\ or whether he is seeking the same old policy of containment \by means that are less risky, less expensive, and more acceptable to the American public.\ Rosenfeld said that Nixon has spoken of building a structure of peace, and of .. constructin~ a strategic relationship with the Soviet Union.\ Efforts haye been Continued on Page 8

CONCORDIENSIS, CONCORDIENSIS founded at Union Coliel!e in 1877 . . \Cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education\ ~Mark Twain ·MIKE MESEROLE-.. editor-in-chi~f PETER DICKERMAN, DAVID ENGEL- associate editors JOE ACHENBAUM -'business manager GEORGE ,tJAIN ..... managing editot MARK MINDEL- sports editor DAVE CONREY ...- photography editor MIKE HURLEY, MARK SHULMAN - advertising TOM CONLEY - subscriptions Martin Luther King When Martin Luther King was assassinated four years ago, Concordy tells that \few Union students participated in memorial services\ and \eight of Union's men joined marchers in downtown Schenectady ... a ha:lf- hour college ceremony honoring King was attended by about I 00 students.\ In retrospect it's easy to be cynical about the events of that spring. It's clear that Union in April, 1968, had little apparent interest in the death of a Black preacher from Georgia. Concordy ran no editorial about King's assassination; few students voiced concern on the crisis of that spring in Letters to the Editor. Concordy's con~ern about race problems in general and at Union was...nowhere to be found. In the spring of 1972, it is foolish to assume that Union has subst<;tntially committed itself to any real programs aimed at combatting ra!!is~ in the college or in the nation. We cannot say that we've come a long iay; we have not. As long as American society continues to be torn apart by racism at all levels, Union will have a commitment that re111ains unfullfilled. Even an ostrich brings its head out of the sand to breathe once in a while. D.E. Under New Management The palace revolution is over, and the inmates have taken over the ·asylum. The newspaper is now under the guidance and direction of former staff reporters and Center I majors who think that the Concordiensis should be fun to read. The big boys of the past two terms are out, and while their hearts and efforts were in the right place, unjler tht(ir .. leaiJership the paper deteriorated into littie better than a glorified community bulletin board. A college newspaper should be and must be more than an announcement sheet of coming events and Hillel meetings. it got to the point last te:rm where Blither was the most' impo1;tant and one of the most exciting columns in the paper. ln short, for the past seven months, as well as for the previous four years, this newspaper has generated a feeling of mediocrity that Roman Hruska would have been proud to embrace. What you see before you then, is an overhauled periodical. The earmarks of past Concordys have been jettisoned in favor of some fresh ideas. The changes in format are obvious, as is the Jact that the paper has doubled in size to eight pages every issue, twice a week. The primary change, however, will come in content; in the news articles, sports stories, features, and illustrations. If the editors have one overriding aim it is to supply Union with stories about people at Union. There are no great promises being made here; we are simply opening up the windows and giving the fresh air a chance to circulate. Whether the 'resh air wants t() come in or not remains to be seen. We welcome any and dl help and criticism from students, faculty, alumni, and administration, vhile at the same time reserving the right to utilize that assistance as we see fit. There is no reason why the Concordiensis cannot be an interesting and ·ntertaining newspaper. It is upon that assumption that we go to press. Out, Damned Spot! Springtime on campus used to be a time when you could kick off your · ,hoes and socks and feel the lush new lawn between your toes. Spring :neant warm, shorts and t-shirt weather that let you day-dream in class and walk around campus in a delightful daze after another terrific o;;chenectady winter. It used to be that the only sounds of the season came ·rom chirping birds, whirling Frisbees, the low hum of rotating lawnmower blades, the chatter of a nearby softball game, and Judy Collins singing on someone's record player. That's the way it used to be, back in the days when fall was a little more fragrant and winter was a lot whiter. But all that has changed in the past year or so with with skyrocketing dog population at Union. Now, if you venture around barefo.ot in the spring the odds are little better than 3 to I ·hat what you get between your 'toes is grass. The entire campl:,ls is a veritable mine field of goodies and with the escalating pedestrian vs. pooch hostilities, it has become a matter of survival of the feces. And the barking and whining of out furry friends is just as irritating. · All of which means what? There are too many damn dogs on campus. Where once a few dogs were cute, now, given the swelling ranks of the canine corps, they are simply a nuisance. And the dog owners (if, indeed, dogs can ever be owned) are not helping matters any. Owning a dog is now the groovy thing to do, so everybody seems to want one. But as' the . ovelty wears off, taking care of Spot becomes another story. Yet, the 'ogs keep coming artd until the owners give their neighbors some onsideration ~ watch your step. T~e dogs don't know any better, but ·heir owners shrmld. , ,_ f. 1 l! .J L ' Tuesday.

• t CONCORDIENSIS, Tuesday, Apri/4, 1972 3 • . . On . Campus: Tenure In the past eight years, Union Colleg«: has. undergone a period of improvement on many· fronts due, to a great extent, to a new breed of faculty member. These men and women have distinguished themselves and 'the learning process at this College by their commitment to all facets of our community. Among the major changes they have significantly contributed to are: the revitalization' of the academic atmosphere at Uni<>n; a more equitable stiJdent/faculty relationship; and the increased involvement of all segments .of the college community in the decision.:.making and policy formulating processess at the College. the new flexibility .of academic life at Union, marked by more interesting and relevant courses, innovative educational programs, 1,1nd interdisciplinary and thematic majors, has been largely due to the efforts of those new faculty members and concern~d students they have helped to motivate. A great deal of the dev:eloping equality between students and faculty members has been the result of the younger .faculty's. view that the best way for students a1.1d teachers to carry out the learning process, the old programs apd the new, is for them to ineet half way, with the understanding that much is to be gained on both sides in education. In the past eight years, many of the exciting and beneficial changes at Union have come from the hearts and minds of students, administrators, and faculty committed to a .better Union College. As has been the case at many colleges, the new faculty's participation il:) the, numerous regular and ad hoc · committees, their sponsorship of new and old extracurricular activites, and their all-around concern for the present and future of the College has made all the .difference in the course of events at Union. Clearly, in order to continue this improvement it is essential that Union be flexible enough to retain these invaluable young faculty members while maintaining- the flow of still newer committed and in·;oJved teacllers into the college community. Like most institutions of higher learning in this country, Union has been, and i~, facing a · time of financial stress in Which budgetary concerns take on added importance and require close scrutiny at all levels. In .keeping With this concern for the college's economic state and in order to continue aca.demic excellence at Union, the Board of Truste.es,. with the support of President Martin, instituted a 60 percent college-wide tenu.re ceiling in October, 1970. President Martin, in defense of this ceiling, has listed three concerns that motivated the Board's decision. The tenure ceiling, he has said, is designed to: mainta.in flexibility in the college's academic program; bring new blood into the faculty to continue the improvements listed earli~r; and hold a tight rein on added expenses that would· result from the salaries of numerous newly tenured faculty in the next ten years. Campus discord followed the Board's decision almost immediately and intensified this fall. The Union chapter of the American Association of .University Professors- made a counter-proposal and various other tenure plans have been discussed throughout the year. As a result of this mounting disagreement, the Board of Trustees appointed an Ad Hoc Committee on Tenure in October, · 1971. On April 21, the Board of Trustees will hear and discuss the Ad Hoc Committee's Report on tenure, if it · is completed. Prior to that meeting, the memb_ers of the Committee, which include trustees, students, and faculty, will engage in dialogue with members of the Administration as to the Committee's possible proposals. As the time for a decision on this imp<lttant issue nears, we, the undersigned students, feel it imperative to express our opposition to the 60 percent tenure ceiling. It is an unwarranted oversimplified solution to a crucial complex issue. It is inflexible in the face of a need for flexibility. What is Condnued on Pa1e 7 r Racism: the egg nobody laic;/ - Primary Night In Dairyland Can HUmphrey Fake It? by JOHN CALENDER Having been tolerated by the voters of New Hampshire, Florida and Illinois, the Democratic presidential aspirants are brawling for the votes of the Wisconsin residents. Wisconsin, because it is more of a microcosm of American society than the preceding primary states, is important to ali the candidates running. There will be no big winner in Wisconsin as in Florida, and the final outcome is still pretty unclear. Wisconsin, which has produced the likes of Jo.e McCarthy and William Proxmir.e, will probably go for either Hubert Humphrey or George McGovern with Edmund Muskie most likely finishing third. Humphrey, vainly trying to. promote the image of a 'new Humphrey' replete with hip jargon and resplendent in 'Easy Rider' glasses, is coming off a comparatively good second place finish in Florida. But the new Humphrey seems to have ·softened and weakened with age, and his strong civil rights stand was conspicuol!sly missing in · Florida, where he tried to promise something to almost everyo.n.e, including kosher lunches for Jewish school- . children. Humphrey, however, is the front-runner and the man to beat in Wisconsin. Senator Muskie is campaigning in Wisconsin after receiving a big moral boost in Illinois. He didn't do as well as he expected in New Hampshire, · where he asked for \trust\ and \confidence ·and he got simply wiped in Florida, where he took a definite stand against busin~. · · Muskie is looking more and more like a populist, concentrating on criticizing the more conservative Democratic candidates, while attempting to appear as a candidate with . no tie~ to bi$ business and political machines .. Muskie will pull an upset in Wisconsin if he finishes anything higher than third. George McGovern, however, is Senator Hubert Humphrey gets help from fellow comedian imd presidential contender Pat Paulsen in dislodging his snowmobile. Paulsen has since dropped out of the race. expected to finish second or maybe even first in Wisconsin·. McGovern possesses the most extensive political organization in the state, and he has poured much money and time into creating this organization. He made a surprising showing in New Hampshire but chose to virtually ignore the Florida contest. He has definitely become a formidable opponent, and his power and stature are sure to increase when lindsay and Chisholm decide either to quit or are relegated · to obscurity by their poor showings. · Alabama Governor Wallace, after capturing 42% of the vote in Florida, is adding his peculiar style of campaigning to the Wisconsin free-for-all. His carnival-like approach to politics and his simple, hard-hitting rhetoric appeal to that increasingly large portion of the populace which is unable and unwilling to face the complexities of 1972. To them, Wallace is not a .. politician,'' but rather a simple, common working man with a tie and speaking ability. His' total in Wisconsin will be artificially large because Wisconsin allows Republicans to cross-over and vote for Democrats in the primary. Watch for New York Mayor John Lindsay to drop out soon after the Wisconsin primary. After spending more than $300,000 in F\lorida and receiving only 7% of the vote, his resources, like those of New York City, are almost depleted. Although he is accustomed to operating with a deficit, his poor showing in Wisconsin and his lack of .popula,rity nationwide will probably prompt him to call it quits. 'Scoop' Jackson is also dancing around in the Dairy State, as in the rest of the nation. He sullied ·his strong civil rights record in florida and managed to finish third after Humphrey; Yet he is not known in Wisconsin and flis flaccid speeches are also hurting his chances. After Wisconsin, Lindsay, Chisholm, and Jackson will probably fade out of the race, to the benefit of the Democratic Party. With twenty more primaries after this one tonight, the Democrats can ill afford the type of cut-throat campaigning which they are currently experiencing.

·-- 4 CONCORDIENSJS,: Tuesday, Apri/4, 1972 For A While, It Wasn't TooeBad by KEN GILPIN Every spring since 1966 the Union College student has been engaged in a game the Administration likes tp call \pre- registration.\ If you believe their . propaganda, this relatively simple process is designed to put the worry about next year's not in September,\ One of the most important aspects . of the new scheduling system concerns classes with potentially ·large enrollments. Mr. Schmidt and his staff (as wdl as each individual department) will tty and anticipate student attraction to particular 1:ourses. A list of these courses will be handed out with the rest of the pre-regis·tvation materia[. Students wishing to · take such a course must sign up by a designated date with the department .which offers it. The :c·ourse instructor will then post a list of those enrolled in the 1 co1,trse and submit it to the Registrar. · courses behind you. Such a notion is purely illusory, however, as most of the student body will ruefully acknowledge. For the game they ask us to play is really Russian roulette, and unless you hit the jackpot, registration and all it entails is tbe unhappy result. You all know the story. Sit in lines. Scramble to see if you can work in PS 185 with Bio 64 .and Greek 10. End up taking anything you can get, just so it adds up 10 three and means you can escape with a little of your sanity. . Mrs. Betty DeGroff of the Registrar's Office on the job in the Gym last week.

But if you don't, by all means don't take it out on Calvin Schmidt. His joh is tough enough as it is. What is the reason for all this? Why must Field House paranoia in September be such a potentially real ex.perience in the lives of all Union students? Time conflicts. No one,. but no one,. knows what courses will be given when until nearly the l'ast mimne before each term begins. However, there is hope for the future. If most of you have kept abreast of late-breaking (like the last two months or so) campus hews, you know that beginning this spring a master time- schedule will be handed out with all the other printed matter that falls under the bureaucratic title of .. pre-registration material.\ The proposed changes prompts two questions. First, why wasn't a switch made before this? And second, will the new system really be any more effective than the old one? Calvin s-chmidt, the Registrar of Union College, the man with a job only an IBM 360 computer could love, is also the only man who really knows the answers. He is a friendly, articulate man, but when you see him at registration, which is probably the only time -you do .see him, ~ m? ~ ·m? ~ LOWEST ~.\ ;, ; ·JJET FARES · .\.

ICEIANBIC you have to wonder if masochism isn't really his bag. In a conversation ranging over everything from the evolution of the 3-3-3 calendar · to the surprising fact that Union has a surplus of classroom space, Schmidt made a number of interesting and informa-tive remarks. Before 1966, none of the present scheduling prol5lems existed. The semester system was being used, with students taking five courses (few of which were electives), and all the paper work was handled by people, not machines. Then Union got a computer, decided to institute the 3•3-3 as well as liberalize course selection, and the rat race began. The ~ature of the 3-3 hasn't made anyone's j0b any easier, particularly Mr. Schmidt's. He is forced to contend with too many variables: an increasing number of students, and an increasing number of courses they can take. A certain number of -classroems they can take them in, and only so many hours in a day. Professorial requests for particular days and times, as well as the rooms they want. With the help of · the computer, the Registrar is expected to coordinate it aU and get things going on time. \For a while, things weren't too bad,\ Schmidt recalls. But the problems inevitably began catching up with the system, and last fall Schmidt estimated there were between six and seven hundred course conflicts. In addition, around two hundred students, perhaps in reply to the hit-or-miss quality of the present system, did not pre-register at all last May. \We do manage to save a couple of hundred souls, but the burden in the first week has been a real one.\ .

A • lr by DAVID ENGEL Howard Kritzer's life is always one of constant excitement; the Union junior seeins to possess a special knack of becoming involved in unusual and very often exceedingly wild escapades. During his years at Union, Howard has achieved a well- deserved reputation as an international traveller and adventurer. The danger-defying Mr. K:. has withstood assaults of all varieties on his intestinal tract in some of the most exotic locales in the world. Luckily for his many friends, Howard's skills as a raconteur are a marvel; the Fox House community is privileged · to possess such an incredible teller of tales. Evenings are rarely dull when Ol'Howard is on hand to spin yarns about traversing the rugged Andes and the treaCherous jungles of the Amazon region or combatting the lethal wastes of the North African deserts. Now, Ol'Howard's life . has always been an incredibly colorful montage of excitement, adventure, and exotic experiences; yet he must contend with .a new challenge as fate seems to have dictated that he must be the son of celebrity parents. While Howard was battling various digestive onslaughts on the Iberian Peninsula last term, his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Allan Kritzer of Oceanside, Long Island, were achieving fame in the pages of the New York Times. Innocent Howard returned to America to discover that his family was ranked with the likes of Nina Van Pallardt and Dita Beard in the roles of the instantly famous. Mr. and Mrs. Kritzer have achieved notoriety. if not fortune, as the new Star poster- children of a high-cost, super- powered promotional campaign by FINN-AIR. FINN-AIR is the national airline of Finland and as the ads say. FINN-AIR is the \pride of Scandinavia.\ Last year. the Kritzers went on a FINN-AIR tour of The Kritzers of Oceanside,· Only in America. Scandinavia. Upon their return to the south-side of Long lsl&nd, the Kritzers col1tacted the airline and informed them of the immensity of their pleasure with the' high quality of the tour. FINN-AIR, cleverly seizing on the golden opportunity, responded by asking permission to quote the Long Island couple in their nromotions. Very quickly contracts were signed. The . Kritzers had bt>come a public property. During the winter, FINN-AIR contacted the Kritzers and advised them to watch for a series of ads to be appearing in the Sunday Times. ln the last several weeks, the Times has become crowded with pictures of the Krit~ers. Several photos depicting the honored couple in various places, positions and .postures have appeared; attached quotations tell of the Kritzer$' great happiness concerning their relationship with FlNN:AIR. The effects of the experience on the unassuming Long Islanders has been incredible. FINN-AIR paid each Kritzer one dollar; yet money cannot adequately measure the great rewards gained frorn the promotion. The Kritzers have been seeing and hearing from friends and relatives whom they have been out of contact with for many years. Of course, there have been negative aspects, as with other publid personalities, the Kritzers have suffered from their share ·of encounters with cranks and misfits who will not permit this usually normal family its rights to privacy. Unfortunately, perhaps, the trials of fame Will probably persist. ·Howard informs this reporter that FINN-AIR is making available a record featuring the Kritzers discussing their super-Scandinavian tour. It's about time that Ralph Nader look into the problem of Long Islanders blindly signing contracts for advertisements with small foreign airlines. If not, we'll all be laughing. at our parents in the Times before long. ) . .I l. ~,I .- ~ ! ,· ( I .._ ( I ~ I .. l- :'< -f- • 1

Several games have been invented during the twentieth century in whiCh it has been found that running is more advantageous than walking (such as baseball, football, etc.). In these games the players run toward a goal so that they might get there quicker than their opponents who, in .the early stages of these games, walked. Then carne running for running's sake. different races of different distances run by different means. Eventually, two tactions arose among racers. One faction claimed that the importance of racing was in the winning; the other claimed that racing should be done for the sake of running, and consequently invented races that ·became longer and longer in distance. And that is how the Boston Marathon was created. Several years back people decided to run~ as well as · walk. Running is very much like walking except that it is much quicker. The first running was done in Germany in 19 37, ltlthough the actual concept was conceived aiid recorded in ancient Greece by some obscure philosopher. Originally, people either tan from something or toward something. In Greek mythology, the gods ran after .beautiful Women, which was the Greeks way of saying to the people that the gods were corning. More recently, the term to run applied more to the pursued than to the pursuer. But in the past thirty-'five years of practical running people have not only found that it is good to run fFom ·· things and to things, but that \funning for the sake of running is . ,a~,o: good in itself. The Boston Marathon is a twenty-six mile 385 yard race run from Hopkinton to Boston and seems to be inevitably won by some Japanese runner. What The Race makes this race interesting is that The t~rm race was invented to this year, on April 17, at least describe what it is that people do . three people from Union College when they run a certain distance will participate in the Boston at the same time that someone Marathon.

Along with the new hopefuls, Coach Scanlon will welcome back four veterans including Gary DeLuca, Gary Friedman, Rober-t Gronauer and Paul Kabb. Hoping to improve on last yeafs 3-5 record, Coach Scanlon will rely quite heavily on these four men. Also, it has been rumored that a certain four-handicapper has chosen to ·play · golf over another spring sport, and this will undoubtedly enhance the team's future. · This year's schedule is made up of .eight matches, including four tri-meets, and will be teed off on April 17th at Utica versus Utica College. With the opening date fast approaching, none, as of now, of Coach Scanlon's charges have been able to get out on the local links due to the inclement Weather. As is evident by the many golfballs that were being chipped around campus this past Saturday, the golfers are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the spring season. Hopefully the linksmen will be ·able to display their hardware very soon. The golf team will play all its home matches at the plush Mohawk Country Club. With. only1:hre'e home dates, all duf(ers should try to make it out to. see how the game is properly played. saves per game. Consistent play from B-More, something which was lacking last season· could key a s.uccessful season. Surrounding B~Mpre are compatriots and fellow .seniors Garibaldi Drumondini, a hot-tempered and firey defender from Wantagh High, \the Gipper,\ Mike Peng, at 220 the heavyweight and tortoise of the squad, and Ed Young and Tom Reif. The main - mid-fielders are juniors Donny Kline and Stan White, along with soph Dave Hochschartner. Hopefuls are seniors Harry Garabedian, Rein Eichinger, and Tom Steckman and junior Pete Miller. The attack; which produced an anemic 52 goals last season should improve with the help of the big defense. Senior Mark Sanderson, Who adorns the cover of National Lacrosse Magazine, scored 48 points as a sophomore but was slowed with inJuries last season. Barry Gross, the sensation from Woodbridge, New Jersey, will team with Sanderson along with soph Denny Walker, and hot frosh Bob Grossman. Siena should provide an able opener Tuesday to test the unity of the squad. However, the team gets a good week off after that game to prepare for Wesleyan and Dartmouth. A big winning streak will be needed from this relatively easy . part of the schedule., as the squad must be healthy and confident for the big Cortlandt, Hobart, and Syracuse matches. If only Wayne Christi could still play. Moeckel won the honor of competing in this event by finishing lith in a field of 85 in the Genesee Tournament held in Utica on November 19 of last year, walking away from a 20 mjle run with a time of I hour, 56 minutes, and a case of Genesee beer. Wayne Roe finished the same race with a time of 2 hours, ten minutes and no obligation to drink any Genesee beer. So now, both Wayne and Bryant are planning to run the twenty-six mile Boston Marathon, training themselves by running twelve miles per day and lifting weights three times per week. Neither expect to come close to winning the race, although both are determined to finish with a respectable time. The record time in the Boston Marathon is 2 hours IO minutes, which figures out to an incredible five minutes per mile. One might ask himself why anyone would bother with the whole thing. I Enjoy It One can expect that after running 26 consecutive miles he will be very sore for at least a Week. This may be the reason that Jim Smith and Jim Johnson, both members of the Union track team with meets only a few days after the marathon, might not run. But why would Bryant Moeckel and Wayne Roe, both seniors with very little intention of going to the Olympics, and Prof. Bick, a brilliant teacher and scholar in mathematics, bother to · spend at least three hours per day, every day of the year, in order to run in a race that they didn't expect to win? Several psychologists have claimed that a child's first experience in running is when he or she is being held by the hand of a mother whose strides are so long that the child is forced to run to keep up with the mother. They cohclude that long distance runners have an unending desire ·to run (or walk quickly) toward some sort of mother figure. But when I asked Wayne Roe why he ran the marathon, he simply answered something to the effect of \1 enjoy it.\ The psychologists would have a real good time with him . Pezzie beats Jimmy: Bob Pezzano, pictur.ed scoring in the Hamilton game on a Tedisco assist; turned the tables on his roommate and former co-captain, by beating Jimmy coaching-wise, 116-115 last Saturday night. Mark Mindel Pezzano ''Modest'' About Victory 5 While most of their former teammates '-Vere down south recuperating from the big season in sunny Florida, Bob Pezzano and his roommate Jimmy Tedisco were busy stiH living basketball. The duo was invited to be assistant coaches for the annual high school Capital District All-Star Basketball Tournament. The strange thing about it was that Bob was to coach one team while Jimmy had the other. Pezzano was assigned the underdog role in the apprenticeship coaching affair, as the co-pilot of the area squad, while Jimmy got the big guns of the New York State team. Pezzie was the subordinate of Billy Kirvin, an ex-area player, while Jimmy worked with his former high schooJ coach. Larry Feldman. The first shock of the evening for Pezzano last Saturday night was when Kirvin failed to show up on time forthe match, and Bob thought he might have t_o go it ~lone. But Kirvin showed up, and the match went on as scheduled, with the frontline height of Jimmy's team, (6'7\ 6'8\ and 6'7\) battling the speed of Pezzie's. It turned out to be a real thriller as Pezzie's Capital District team pressed the taller State team to a see-saw standstill. It went into overtime, and with three seconds remaining, [)avie (the rave) Modest, who played for Pezzano's alma mater, Linton, threw in a 20-foot jumper to give Pezzie a I 16-115 victory over Jimmy. The tournament continues this weekend when teams from Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and possibly Connecticut invade Mont Pleasant High School to compete with the combined ten best players from both the area team and the New York State team. However Connecticut is considering not corning to the affair unless its All-American from Bridegeport High School decides to play. If Connecticut balks, then both the Capital [)istrict team and the New York State team will play, and the two Union would-be coaches can go at it again. * * * * A never ending barage of awards continue to flow towards Mr. Tedisco. Over the vactaion Jimmy received three more all-star selections. He was again picked as the player of the year of Division III of the ECAC, over the likes of Brockport's Norman Bounds, and players from highly touted Assumption and Bentley. He also was a repeater on the first string of the \\little all-american\ squad of ball players 5'10\ and under. This placed him ·with the likes of Florida's snazzy nationally televised 5'7'' Ott<l Petty. But the most rewarding selection was a brand new one. He was picked to the third team of the Small College All-American squad, the first player in area history since Albany State's Rich Margison accorded an ho~orable mention. And it continues. Next Tuesday, April II th, the Rotterdam Kiwanis Club will honor Jimmy with a gala banq uct. Tickets are priced slightly above student range at $7.50 a head. hut one fraternity got around this by raffling chance!> for Cl tidt:t at fifty cents a piece until they got enough to buy one.

Hockey: Standout Dutchman rearguards!t defenseman ·Dan Rapalje and goaltender Rick Ohler · of Union College's Club Hockey Team, take a breather during a recent practice. While almost every other· college hockey squad in the country has retired their skates for the season, Union plays on, cartying their highly underrated 1-1 record on to the ice .against Williams next week. Union Nine Begin With High Hopes by RILL KILLEN Union baseball fans are in for an exciting and successful season. So it ap.pears after talking with Coach Art Lawrence who, in his 37th year of coaching is once again optimistic about his team's outlook for the upcoming campaign. Just how optimistic he can be, however, rests on the performance of his pitching staff, stresses Lawrence. With many Veterans back fro·m last year's fine 9-4 squad and some good new talent appearing in early spring workouts, hitting and defense appear to be quite solid, especially around the infield. Lawrence is also excited about the dazzling speed he feels he will be unleashing at opposing teams. But pitching remains the key to an outstanding season. Leading the all right-handed staff is junior Bob Mitchell, who posted 3-1. 3.33 stats last year. Behind him, Lawrence has a whole group to pick from. Bucky Rulon-Miller and Steve Stockman are back for their second year. Coach Lawrence is looking for improvement in both in the areas of consistency from Miller and improved control from Stockman. Junior Hank Lambert and freshmen Jon Gould and Joe Urschel also figure prominently. The infield is particularly strong despite the los:-> of last year's leading hitter Dale Long. Frosh Ron Westbrook is looking like an excellent bet to fill Long's shoes at short~ and Rolf Wandel (.362 fast year) look~ strong (!gain at first. Bob Bernhardt (.368) is at third and will be playing second when Mitchell (.304) is on the mound. This leaves an occasional opening at third with frosh Steve Andrews among the possibles.· Catching shows Ski.p Lega back after a year out of school and also Rick Arons. last year's performer there (.3 19). A question mark remains in the outfield with fleet Gene Quirk (.259, seven stolen bases) ready in center but a host of others fighting for the positions left open by AI Westbrook no longer in school, and John Quirk. now playing golf. Among the candidates are Arons, Jerry C'uffey (.357), Scott Burns, Lou Miller, Gred Breedlove. Gary Lauver. and Randy Ruschak. Lawrence remains ·confident in his outfield despite its present uncertain nature saying that 'his problem there rests not in finding capable players but in deciding who will play. The next few days should help Lawrence answer some .of the 4 ue!>tions still in -his mind. He will be making final selection of his squad by tomorrow and then will begin. preparing for next Monday's opener at RPI. All in all. a successful season is on the hori7on. Just how successful depends on how well the pitching staff develops. BLITHER Track 4th In State Jaszczak Excels Union•s in<leor track team ended its season on a mixed note two weeks ago.

CONCORDIENSJS, Tuesday, Apri/4, 1972 Hockey: Standout Dutchman rearguards, defenseman Dan Rapalje and goaltender Rick Ohler of Union College's Club Hockey Team, take a breather during a recent practice. While almost every other college hockey squad in the country has retired their skates for the season, Union plays on, carrying their highly underrated 1-1 record on to the ice against Williams next week. Union Nine Begin With High Hopes by BILL KILLEN Union baseball fans are in for an exciting and successful season. So it appears after talking with Coach Art Lawrence who, in his 37th year of coaching is once again optimistic about his team's outlook for the upcoming campaign. Just how optimistic he can be, however, rests on the performance of his pitching staff, stresses Lawrence. With many veterans back from last vear's fine 9-4 squad and some good new talent appearing in early ;pring workouts, hitting and defense appear to be quite solid. especially around the infield. Lawrence is also excited about the danling speed he feels he will be unleashing at opposing teams. Hut pitching remains the key to an outstanding season. l.eading the all right-handed staff is junior Bob Mitchell, who posted 3-1 .. LB stats last year. Behind him. Lawrence has a whole group to pick from. Bucky Rulon-Miller and Steve Stockman are hack for their second year. Coach Lawrence is looking for improvement in both in the areas of consistency from Miller and improved cotttrol from Stockman. Junior Hank Lambert and freshmen Jon Gould and Joe Urschel also figure prominently. The infield is particularly strong despite the loss of last year's leading hitter Dale Long. Frosh Ron Westbrook is looking like an excellent bet to fill Long's shoes at short. and Rolf Wandel (.362 last year) looks strong again at first. Hob Bernhardt (.368) is at third and will he playing second when Mitchell (.304) is on the mound. This leaves an occasional opening at third with frosh Steve Andrews among the possibles.· Catching shows Skip Lega back after a year out of school and also Rick Arons. last year's performer there (.319). . A question mark remains in the outfield with fleet Gene Qmrk (.259. seven stolen bases) ready in center but a host of others fighting for the positions left open hy AI Westbrook no longer in school. and .Jnhn Quirk, now playing golf. Among the candidates an: Arons. Jerry Cuffey ( .357). Scott Burns. Lou Miller, Gred Hrcedlme. Ciarv Iauver. and Randv Ruschak. Lawrence remains confident in hi~ outfield despite its present uncertain nature saying that hi~ prohlem there n:,ts not in finding capable players but in deciding who will play. !he next lew davs should help Lawrence answer some of the questions still in ·his. mind. He will he making final selection of his st:juad hy tomorrow and then will begin preparing for next Mondav's opener at R Pl. All in all. a successful season is on the hori1oo\. Just hov. successful depends on how well the pitching staff develops. BLITHER Track 4th In State Jaszczak Excels Unio!'l's indoor track team ended its season on a mixed note two weeks ago. The Garnet captt!red fourth place out of the 18 teams in the New York State Indoor Champs. Coach Michelsen and his runners were slightly disappointed, since they had taken second in the Union Invitational the week before aRd had ambitions of taking it aU in the state meet. Howeve'r the team received excellent performances from several individuals, especially the psyched mile relay team, and fleet co-captain Rick \Carlos\ Jaszczak.

McCabe, who was student teaching in North Carolina over the winter, is the school record holder in the 880. Bryant Moeckel, fifth in the state in cross-country this fall, and record holder Seamas Johnson will give Union strength in the 3-mile. Once again the field events will be very strong, especially the pole vault, with Dave Ricks and Floater returning; and the weights, with Mowery and Bob Cable being joined by MikeRich and newcomers AI Gilewicz and Mark Chittim.

The key recommendation that the Cornmtsswn proposed 1s that on both the . Federal and state levels, the possession .of marijuana for personal use should no longer ?e . a ~rime. Furthermore, the Coll1mission felt that the casual _d1stnbut10n of marijuana for no profit should also no longer be a cnme. . . The recommendations, however, are not a call for legahzatwn of marijuana. There would still be a penalty for the pos~ession. of more than one o:Unce of the drug. Thus, an mterestmg contradiction develops; it is legal to use matijuan~ but it 'Yo~ld pr:obably still be illegal to sell it. The reason for th1s con~radtctwn and the failure to call for the .. legalization of pot,.\ accordmg to the report, was \because it would institutionalize availa_bility of a dr~g which has 1,10certain long--term effects.\ The Cornmtttee was afnu~ that the marijuana smoker of today will turn into tomorrow-s alcoholic or cancer-ridden cigarette smoker. Election Year Jitters However, the politics involved in this Commission's findings are significant. Essentially, the reason the report did not call. for legalization is that this is an election year and most o~ the Amencan public is opposed to legalization. It should be pomted out. that • legislation of these recommendations into law is given practically no chance of passing Congress. This is true, although four of the members of the Commission are also members of the House or Senate. Another more important reason for why no action will be taken is that President Nixon had said that he would ignore any recommendations that are different from his own feelings on the subject. He made this statement months before ~he committee released its findings and despite the fact that he appomted over half of the members of the Commission. It should be pointed out that there has not exactly been an outpouring of sentiment on th~s to~ic by the Democratic presidential candidates, either. In a presidential election year when George Wallace seems to have become a significant Democratic contender one can almost expect what that sentiment will be. There woula seem to be a case for the legalization of marijuana. The Commission's concern for long-term effects is an important one and should be taken into account. However. the fact that to obtain legal marijuana one must deal with crimin;:tls will only lea~ to subterfuges that will lessen respect for the law. Furthermore, tf marijuana were to be legalized, standards could be set so that those people who wished to use it could do so with some degree of assurance and safety. The legalization argument versus the Commission's ap.proach are both debatable. Either one would probably be preferable to the cumbersome and unworkable status quo. It can only be hoped that in this election year this situation will be discussed on its me:its with a minimum of emotionalism so that a proper course of actwn can be developed.

If it oan be said that the film industry is attempting to fill a cultural void left by television's wasteland, the movie-makers can very often be accused of borrowing a formula from the smaller screen medium. This formula assumes that the American audience will swallow anything and come running back to the same trough whi:le protected from aesthetic in.digestion by the lethargy that can accompany visual media. It is with this in mind that this reviewer finds cause for elation when the movie-makers do produce an exceptional motion picture. \The Last Picture Show., is such a motion picture. The film is set in a small Texas town in the early 1950's. Despite the sectional dialect, the .. effective use of canned Country-Western music and, of course, the symbol of the closing movie theater, the universal nature of the picture's message cannot be denied. From within the framework of the shifting post-war American cultu:re a humanistic statement emerges and · gives \The Last Picture Show\ its true power. Much::has b~n made of Cybill Shepll&rd's performance, and rightfully so, but it is Timothy Bottoms' portrayal of Sonny and the director's use of that character which form the core of the film, and ultimately establish it as successful.

This is not to say that the film is without flaw. Some of the characters, such as Sam the Lion - mentor and benefactor for the young Sonny, are underdeveloped and their potential is only scratched.

The key recommendation that the Commission prop?sed IS that on both the Federal and state levels. the possessiOn of marijuana for personal use should no longer ?e . a _crime. Furthermore, the Commission felt that the casual d1stnbuuon ot marijuana for no profit should also no longer be a crime. . . The recommendations, however, are not a call for legalizatiOn of marijuana. There would still be a penalty for the possession. of more than one ounce of the drug. Thus, an mterestmg contradiction develops; it is legal to use marijuan~ but it ~o~ld probably still be illegal to sell it T_he reason for .~hts con~rad1ct10n and the failure to call for the \legalization of pot, accordmg to the report, was \because it would institutionalize availa_bility of a ?r~g which has uncertain long-term effects.\ The Committee was afraid that the marijuana smoker of today will turn into tomorrow:s alcoholic or cancer-ridden cigarette smoker. Election Year Jitters However, the politics involved in this C'omm1ssion's findings are significant. Essentially, the reason the report did_ not call. for legalization is that this is an election year and most ot the Amencan public is opposed to legalization. It should be P'?mted out. that • legislation of these recommendations into law is g1ven yractlcally no chance of passing Congress. This is true, although lour of the members of the Commission are also members of the House or Senate. Another more important reason for why no action will he taken is that President Nixon had said that he would ignore any recommendations that are different from his own feelings on the subject. He made this statement months before ~he committee released its findings and despite the fact that he appomted 0\ er half of the members of the Commission. It should be pointed out that there has not exactly been an otttpouring of sentiment on th_is topic by the Democratic presidential candidates. either. In a pres1den11al election year when George Wallace seems to ha\e become a significant Democratic contender one can almost expect what that sentiment will be. There woulG seem to be a case for the legali1ation ot marijuana. The Commission's concern for long-term effects is an important one and should be taken into account. However. the tact that to obtain legal marijuana one must deal with criminals will only lead to subterfuges that will lessen respect for the law. Furthermore. 1t marijuana were to be legalized. standards could be set so that those_ people who wished to use it could do so with some degree ot assurance and safety . The legalization argument versus the Commission's approach are both debatable. Either one would probably be prelerable to the cumbersome and unworkable status quo. It can only he hoped that in this election year this situation will be discmsed nn its merits with a minimum of emotionalism so that a proper course of action can be developed. Too much cannot be said for the contribution Peter Bogdanovich has made to his craft. This film belongs to the director. His use of counterpoint Bogdanovich is to be excused for his shortcomings in the face of the film's achievements. If cinematic fiction is to ever have hope of relizing its potential as an art form it will be through the C£ntertainment Quide On Campus: Tenure Continued from Page 3 more, as students, we view the tenure limit as a serious detriment to Union's academic environment. The tenure ceiling 1s unwarranted because with the institution of proper guidelines, now under the consideration of the Salaries, Promotions. and Tenure Committee, a faculty strictly adhering to such guidelines would be able to regulate themselves. By maintaining a 60 percent limit, the Board is choosing an a;rbitrary, oversimplified method of granting or depriving tenure on the basis of statistics rather than merit. The inflexibility of the ceiling can only lead to the dismissal of many of the vital faculty members who have contributed so much to this institution. Most importantly, the reaffirmation of the ceiling at the Trustee meeting April 21 will inevitably precipitate the decline of the academic atmosphere so many faculty have worked so hard to develop. The tenure limit has already seriously affected the morale of many of Union's junior faculty. With little or no hope of receiving tenure, these teachers have suddenly found themselves out in a bleak educational job market. They have been forced to pursue the \publish or peris~\ dictum in order to enhance their marketability. · ' Faced with this additional burden, faculty membt;:rs in this position are forced to lessen or abandon some of their worthwhile actiVIties in the college community. The intimate student/faculty relationship, participation in college committees, sponsorship of e·xtr'}- curricular actiVIties, involvement in innovative, flexible academic programs all of the commitments to a progressive Union College must be sacrificed in increasing degrees to the search for a more secure academic position that promises a future. These faculty members will be lost at a tremendous cost to Union's morale and academic environment. In their place. the college will hire new teachers. the majority of which will have no possibility of receiving tenure. From the moment of th€ir arrival at Union, these faculty members, because of the transient nature of their employment, will hesitate to form long-term commitments to the campus community. Once again, this \revolving door\ policy will deprive the college of the intimate relationships and active involvement it has so long prized. In this case, new blood will not serve to revitalize and improve Union College. The financial savings that would result from the tenure ceiling must be evaluated in terms of the academic and social benefits that will be irretrievably lost to the community now and in the future. Surelv the retaining of those junior fa~ulty deserving of tenure and the advantages that accompany them outweigh the financial burdens that may be incurred. The highest form of economic responsibility is the financial commitment to academic excellence. We, the undersigned students, hereby join with all members of the college community in the desire to maintain and enhance the Union College environment. The best way to reach these desired ends is to allow Union's faculty to be judged on their merits as professionals. By eliminating the tenure ceiling, Union can continue to be financially responsible, flexible, vital, and just to its community and its ideals.

Both men related the events that led to the choice of Biology and Political Science, respectively as their chosen professions. . Sharlet said, in reference to the fortuitous chain of events that led to his choice of Political Science, \It's a miracle that I'm even here.\ He enrolled in Brandeis University, although he \ ... didn't have one good reason to go there.\ He originally wanted to be a novelist, but his enthusiasm for writing waned after he left college for the purpose of writing a novel. He spent an enjoyable hitch in the Army, where he learned to speak Czech, of all languages. Although he concentrated on American CiVilization as an undergraduate, Sharlet shifted to Soviet studies as a graduate student. He found the Soviet Union to be a very \challenging and interesting subject. Since the Soviet Union is one of the largest and most powerful nations in the world, Sharlet also said that he felt \socially\ justified because he was concentrating on a subject that was important ' and significant. Professor Sharlet explained that he focused his attention on Soviet law for several reasons. It is much easier to study the implementation of policies in Russia, Sharlet said, because there is. one central, national law- making body that widely publishes their laws. Studying the policy-making process in the Soviet Union gives us insight into I ' . Professors Roth and Sharlet. how a communist system develops, he pointed out. This in turn enables him to provide better and more accurate information to American policy makers. Greater knowledge and understanding of the Soviet Union will increase the likelihood of a more cooperative relationship between our two countries, Sharlet concluded. Sharlet emphasized that \the classroom is indispensable to his · research, and his research has also enriched his teaching.

Primarily for the second reason, James Taylor did not appear in the spring of 1970 and neither did Elton John in the winter of 1971. This year the Social Committee is operating on a budget of $18,000, a miniscule sum when Poco and .the Allman Brothers now ask $10,000 and Chicago commands $18,000 fnr an appearance. The SC encounters further problems, since Memorial Chapel seats only 1200, and at $3.00 a person, that means only $3600 gross at any sold-out concert. The availability of Proctors Theater, with a capacity of 2700, ameliorates this situation somewhat, but the downtown hJ.ll may not be available next fall after a change of managers.

And, in all, we haveprobably had less publicity than the Mountebanks have had for 0ne play. The present officers of Hillel and I believe that our organization lives for the present and the future and see no reason to call attention to mistakes that have been made by past leaders. In fact, I believe that Lou made very few mistakes in Hillel. l suggest that the management of Concordy follow our example and forget about the past.

GSB Purposes With the second issue of the spring term, the Concordiensis is continuing its attempt to liven things up around campus. Admittedly, a special Academy Awards edition, in itself, is of little importance, especially with Life Magazine coming out with a complete list of nominees this week; yet inCluded in our coverage are some unique twists that we think are of interest to the Union College community. First of all, one of the area~s premier oddsmakers, Union's own Tony Faga. has consented to draw up a thorot:gh analysis on Monday night's Oscar nominees and secondly, over twenty professors and students were asked to submit their \top ten greatest movies\ lists for publication and all readily agreed - from President Martin to the Athletic Department. The question arises, \so what?\ and the answe:r is a simple one: it's interesting. Making the Concordiensis an interesting newspaper is our primary goal and in order to achieve a high degree of reader interest, we intend to run stories tha:t all members of the college community will enjoy. With tonight's issue we think that the college might enjoy comparing the top ten movies lists of say President Martin and Petes Tarshis. Just the fact that many people on campus knew about the lists before tonight and have been looking forward to seeing them convinces us that the extra effort. on Coneordy's part to solicit these lists was worthwhile. As for .Faga's selections, we'll have to wait until Monday night to see how good they are. In the light of the livelier new format of the first Concordy of the semester and the reactions reflected in tonight's letters to the editor, it should .be clear that the editors are most interested in making Coneordiensis a complete and exciting college newspaper. Admittedly our . new style does not please everyone but we are trying our best (to please). The comment in last issue's policy editorial about Hillel meetings was in no way intended to be detrimental to that organization. We were merely pointing out that the paper had becorne little more than a four-page bulletin board. Announcements for Hillel or any other campus group are more than welcome in the paper. We also point out that our staff is open for all students who wish to add their expertise to our efforts of informing and possibly entertaining the college community.

Friday, Apri/7, 1972 CONCORDIENSIS founded at Union College in 1877 I wish I hadn't broke that dish, I wish I was a movie star, I wish a lot of things, I wish That life was like the movies are; -Alan Patrick Herbert \It May Be Life, But Ain't It Slow?\ LETTERs· MIKE MESEROLE- editor-in-chief PETER DICKERMAN, DAVID ENGEL- associate editors JOE ACHENBAUM - business ~anager Uncalled For GEORGE BAIN- managing editor MARK MINDEL- sports editor I was very upset with the <>light against Hillel in last issue's editorial \Under New Management.\ Could have been that the author of this work (Mike Meserole, I presume) thought it necessary to s-ingle out DAVE CONREY - photography editor MIKE_ HURLEY, MARK SHULMAN - advertising TOM CONLEY- subscriptions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- QiMcl becau~~wu a~umed to be a Social Life As it had to dismiss such acts as James Taylor and Elton John, the Social Committee is not considering John Prine as a performer for the May 19 Carnival Weekend, not only because his $1500 fee is too much for the budget, but also because it does not want to hire an unknown act, no matter how good its reviews. Primarily for the second reason, James Taylor did not appear in the spring of 1970 and neither did Elton John in the winter of 1971. This year the Social Committee is operating on a budget of $18,000, a miniscule sum when Poco and the Allman Brothers now ask $10,000 and Chicago commands $18,000 f()r an appearance. The SC encounters further problems, since Memorial Chapel seats only 1200, and at $3.00 a person, that means only $3600 gross at any sold-out concert. The availability of Proctors Theater, with a capacity of 2700, ameliorates this situation somewhat, but the downtown hJ.ll may not be available next fall after a change of managers. Faced with a discriminating student audience that will pay only to see such \established\ groups as Sha Na Na, the Social Committee still tries to hire up-and-coming, and therefore inexpensive, acts, such as Poco and Seatrain, who successfully performed here a year ago. But this year, in the words of Mark Shugoll, the SC \guessed wrong\ on groups such as Edgar Winter, Brewer and Shipley, and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, and they were not well received. Next year, the Social Committee plans to double the number of its members (to 20) and seek more student opinion and guidance on what groups to hire. But for Carnival Weekend, it may be forced to hire a singer who has already demonstrated her appeal here, Bonnie Raitt. Is that any way to have to run an organization? And who is John Prine anyway?

The Rosebud Awards, which take theit name from the sled of young John Foster Kane in Orson Welles' classic, \Citizen Kane\ are renowned for their astute allocation of accolades, not to mention a well- documented distaste for press agentry.

This year, the winner's names were made up by Clifford IrviAg and leaked to the Concordy through the good offices of Jack Anderson.

4 CASABLANCA: Claude, Paul, Bogie & Ingrid. Top Ten Picks PROF. FRANK GADO (English): Making lists of the ten best anything is amusing a.nd unsettling. It's like asking for the greatest kiss you've ever gotten or given; as soon as you've settled on one, another comes to mind to challenge it, and then mulling that one over, som~ qualification haunts the selection. Well, here goes .... relic of an innocent era when we went to the movies to shed a hidden tear and feel a tingle of pride in human possibilities ·Of heroism while we munched popcorn. Bad Day is probably the best of the Westerns (I've never seen High Noon or Shane). The KiUing is a \caper\ film. An early Kubrick, made before he started, mistakenly, thinking of himself as an artist. Night, like Killing, is a B film. h is Laughton's only direction and has an effective Agee script. I also have to include two films made from novels, a practice purists usually condemn, and usually rightly so. Treasure has Bogart and it is a seering picture of the human animal; Sons is a delicate rendition of Lawrence's novel and one of the very best of the Hollywood films in its use· of the camera as an interpretive instrument. 812 - The best Fellini and probably the greatest film ever made. Not only a great film, but one of the outstanding fictions of our time. Persona - Very close behind. Every tirne I see it, my admiration for Bergman grows. M - One of the first \talkies.\ Fritz Lang's manipulation of emotions is superb. Jules and Jim - The \New Wave\ has to be represented and this is the best by the best of that cenacle. Yojimbo- Kurosawa must be on any list such as this. My nod goes to Yojimbo over such films as Seven Samurai, Rashomon, and Throne of Blood because he takes a tired convention, the Western, and manages to make of it a highly affective work of art. Also, his camera work here is superior. The Grand Illusion - Jean Renoir's film is still probably the best indictment of war and he doesn't take the easy path of depicting garish slaughter and such. I must add that I've never seen Citizen Kane. While I;m at it, I might also append A lfst of the most over- rated films and directors: David and Lisa -~ Once heralded as an ava:nte~gar(Je American film,· it 1s now beginning to be seen as the kitch it was all along. Lawrence of Arabia - See the desert. OOOh, it's big! See Peter O'Toole use two expressions. Ooooh, how he emotes! Don't see the sodomy scene. Wow, the mystery of it all. Hiroshima, Mon Amour and Last Year at Marienbad Resnai!>'s afterbirth of the existentialism of the fifties. BIQw Up ~ \It's all about this tennis ball that isn't there.\ Pre~entious. The start of Antonioni's decline. The inside La Strada - Once again, the urge to be \representative\ leads me to think over the Italian nco- realists, and though Fellini was a later member of the brotherhood this film is very much within th~ lodge and a better example than the work of such giants as de Sica and Rossellini. i story on this film is that Ponti, the producer, got fed up with Antonioni's running over the budget and ordered him to make a film out of what he had - even though the film wasn't half shot yet. Signor A., in my view, did not rise to the challenge. (My apologies to Pat Kilburn.) Red Desert - While I'm thinking of I~aly, Antonioni's name nags at me. Red Desert may be the finest exploitation of color in the medium. It is also a magnificently cbmplex statement of the \nausea'' theme. · The General - I'm not one of those who love primitivism for its own sake, but at least one of the silents should be included. This is my nomination. It has devastating pat-hetic qualities and makes more effective use of the camera than the Chaplins which, th~u~h excellent, are in my opmwn over-rated. Elvira Madigan- Treacle. Dr. Strangelove - A cheap shot at the apocalypse. High quality situation comedy, but hardly a great film, for all of Dwight MacDonald's propa- ganda.

Persona -· Very close behind. Every time I see it, my admiration for Bergman grows. M - One of the first \talkies.\ Fritz Lang's :nanipulation of emotions is superb. Jules and Jim - The \New Wave\ has to be represented. and this is the best by the best of that cenacle. Yojhnbo - Kurosawa must be on any list such as this. My nod goes to Yojimbo over such films as Seven Samurai, Rashomon, and Throne of Blood because he takes a tired convention, the Western, and manages to make of it a highly affective work of art. Also, his camera work here is superior. The Grand IJJusion -· Jean Renoir's film is still probably the best indictment of war and he doesn't take the easy path of depicting garish slaughter and such. La Strada - Once again, the urge to be \representative\ leads me to think over the Italian nee- realists, and though Fellini was a later member of the brotherhood, this film is very much within the lodge and a better example than the work of such giants as de Sica and Rossellini. Red Desert While I'm thinking of Italy, Antonioni's name nags at me. Red Desert may be the finest exploitation of color in the medium. It is also a magnificently complex statement of the \nausea\ theme. I must add that I've never seen Citi:zen Kane. While I'm at it. I might also append a list of the most over- rated films and directors: [)avid and Lisa Once heralded as an avante-garde American film, it is now beginning to be seen as the kitch it was all along. Lawrence of Arabia - See the desert. OOOh, it's big! See Peter O'Toole use two expressions. Ooooh, how he emotes! Don't see the sodomy scene. Wow, the mystery of it all. Hiroshima, Mon Amour and Last Year at Marienbad Resnm:. 's afterbirth of the existentialism of the fifties. Blow Up - \It's all about this tennis ball that isn't there.\ Pretentious. The start of Antonioni's decline. The inside story on this film is that Ponti the producer, got fed up with Antonioni's running over the budget and ordered him to make a film out of what he had - even though the film wasn't half shot yet. Signor A., in my view, did not rise to the challenge. (My apolo.gies to Pat Kilburn.) Elvira Madigan -Treacle. Dr. Strangelove - A cheap shot at the apocalypse. High quality situation comedy, but hardly a great film, for all of Dwight MacDonald's propa- ganda. To this list, might add, The General - I'm not one of those who love primitivism for its own sake, but at least one of the silents should be included. This is my nomination. It has devastating pathetic qualities and makes more effective use of the camera than the Chaplins which, th~u~h excellent, are in my opmwn over-rated. I'll split my vote for Number Ten among Hard Day's Night, Goldfinger, Casablanca, The Killing, Bad Day at Black Rock Night of the Hunter, Treasure of Sierra Madre, and Sons and Lovers. Each is an outstanding example of ( ne facet of the ~ollywood tradition. Hard Day a~ything by Joseph Losey, VIrtually all the later Hitchcock (especially Marnie and The Birds), Sidney Lumet (who always goes for the safest way of presenting his materials), and Stan! ey Kramer, that anachronism from the Marxist school of the 'thirties. PROF. WILLIAM WOO (Chinese): Hi_story a~d Philosophy The character actor lives anonymously for the most part, so much so that if you can go beyond John McGiver or Slim Pickens as current representatives of the breed, you rate four stars. But where would the film industry be without these character actors whose faces you recognize immediately but whose names produce blank stares. Their only credits appear way down on the list marked \also starring\ but without them the character of the film would be lost. Occasionally, a character actor sneaks through to win an oscar in the supporting actor category such as Edmund Gwenn for his role as St. Nick in the The Miracle on 34th Street, or Hattie McDaniel, playing the servant to Scarlet O'Hara in Gone With the Wind or Hugh Griffith, later of Tom Jones fame, for Ben Hur or even Barry Fitzgerald in Going My Way. But mostly this supporting category is closed to character actors too, as it is won virtually every year by such bit players en route to stardom as Anthony Quinn (twice), Frank Sinatra, Jack Lemmon, Patty Duke, Walter Matheau and Shirley Jones of The Partridge Family who won one playing a fallen women in Elmer Gantry. Sara Allgood, the nurse in The Spiral Staircase and Beulah Bondi in Watch on the Rhine knew their place in films and you appreciated their sense of balance which is more than you can say for some of the more obnoxious kids in movies, led by the criminally cute Baby Sandy. Billy Hallop was the object of a tug of influence war between priest Pat O'Brian and criminal Humphrey Bogart in Angels With Dirty Faces, but you never doubted that Sergeant Y ol'k's younger brother, played by Dickie West would turn out okay. At the same time you hoped for the worst for Charles Smith, the insipid but irrepressible compatriot of Henry Aldrich. Horizons World War II opened new horizons for character actors as Keye Luke and Sen Yung graduated from the Charlie Chan flicks to playing heavies in mo_vies like Across the Pacific, whtch also featured Richard Loo Phillip Ahn and Benson Fong. ' Across the Atlantic, the likes of Kurt Katcb in Background to Danger, Conrad Veidt in A II Through the Night and Kurt Kruger in Paris Underground were the menacing equals of their oriental co-conspirators. Repugnant characters Character actors who easiiy identified with ethnic or racial ~r.oups were always busy. The Inimitable Turban Bey was keeper of The Mummy when he returned, while Willie Best and Butte~y McQueen, after having parts mtended as comic relief P,l.ayed for broader roles in High Sterra and Gone With the Wind. S.Z. Sakal as the waiter and Leonid Kinsky as the bartender in Casablanca illustrated the weren't national melting pot of that movie's location. Vladimir Sokolv was always the sage but somehow pathetic ancient in all his roles, as in Passage to Marseilles. Change was also not in the wind for the likes of Sabu, Marvin Kaplan, and the encouragable Chief Youlachie who has the unofficial Hollywood record for dying in films. Some actors played characters that are unforgettable such as Olga Baclanova, the devious beauty turned into a freak in the movie by the same name or William Bendix in \Wake Island\ Dwight Frye, the hunchbacked Once in a while, a charactor actor rose to stardom like William Bendix, the deranged heavy who kicked the ca-ca out the exclusive possession of the of Alan Ladd in This Gun For kids as tne groveling Elisah Cook Hire or Walter Brennan, the Jr. in Shane proved, or perhaps grizzled oldtimer in The the most mealy-mouthed actor dwarf who was the deranged laboratory assistant in Frankenstein. Gene Stutenroth played the science fiction villian in Captain Video but it was a cut-rate characterization in a role made famous by Charles Middleton later in Flash Gordon and earlier by Monte Blue in Undersea Kingdom.

Then there were the dummies epidomized by Edward s: Brophy as the dupe in All Through the Night and later The Last Hurrah, along with Barton MacLane, Torchy Blane's detective boyfriend, a cop in The Maltese Falcon but in 1948 the conniving boss ln The Treasure of Sierra Madre.

Forgive me for sounding a bit bitter hut it's getting dose to Oscar.time and venomo.us fumes are in the air. Besides, bitterness follows resignation and I have thoroughly accepted as inevitable, the inequities of the Academy. The· Motion Picture Academy has a penny-dreadful interpretation of entertainment and taste, and most certainly art. If Americans don't begin to reward and encourage g.ood art - by subsidy or intelligent criticism - even hy gwmg Oscars, it won't have very much left. Sme, Orson Welles got a special Oscar last year for his brilliant career but it was certainly too late for Hollywood to repair the damage it has done to his films and his life. And it bothers me that this is already happening to people like Robert Altman (M*A*S*H, Bre\\lster McCloud, McCabe and Mrs. Miller}, Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, The Ballad of Cable Hogue, Straw Dogs), and Ken Russell (Women in Love, The Music Lovers, The Devils, The Boyfriend) ~ men who are uncontestably America's greatest film artists.

Besides, bitterness follows resignation and I have thoroughly accepted as inevitable, the inequities of the Academy. The Motion Picture Academy has a penn)-dreadful interpretation of entertainment and taste, and most certainlv art. If Americans don't hegi~ I<' reward and encourage ~ood art by subsidy or ,,nel11gent criticism even h~ g1 nng Oscars, it won't have \cry much left. Sure, Orson Welles got a special Oscar last year for his brilliant career but it was certainly too late for Hollywo0d to repair the damage it has done to his films and his life. And it bothers me that this is already happening to people like Robert Altman (M*A*S*H. Brewster McCloud, McCabe and Mrs. Miller), Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, The Ballad of Cable Hogue, Straw Dogs). and Ken Russell (Women in Lo\·e, The Music Lovers, The Devils, The Boyfriend) · men who are uncontestably America's greatest film artists.

• •1: Friday, April?, 1972 . ' . Sno~ To Decide \Weather\ Or Not to Play LONG GONE: Coach Art \dgar 1 '. Lawrence_ ~~tches · · · last year's squad warm-up. With Dale Long departed Lawrence is looking for successful pitching .to take· ~he place of the former bat star. How-ever hit-tirig is not to _ be overlooked with Ron Westbrook looking good filling the vacated shortstop position. . - Star Dale departed, ·but ... Lawrence Wishes S ''L ,,-G . now· ong one by BI,LL KILLEN Baseball opening days around the country have all been cancelled, and it looks like Union's opener will be no exception. As of now it doesn't look like the Dutchmen will be playing Monday at RPI, not because of striking players, but rather because of inclement weather. Garnes against Capital District foes are easy to reschedule, so neither team will feel a compelling need to get the game in if conditions are bad. Should the weather suddenly improve and the game be played, right bander Bob Mitchell would get the opening day pitching honors. Mitchell closed out last season with a five hit, 3-2 win over the Engineers and would be hoping to pick up right where he left· off. That win gave Union a split in the series, as they had lost I 0-7 to the same club a day earlier. Coach Art Lawrence declined to give a possible batting order for the .game, saying it was still too early and several positions are still open A particularly interesting battle is occurring at catcher where frosh Greg Breedlove and soph Skip Lega are knocking heads. In -watching bunting drills yesterday, Breedlove displayed quite an ann in gunning down baserunners. So the least of Lawrence's problems is ca\ching talent. Rick Arons, last year's s~arter seems to be headed for duty in right field, and last year's number two man, Bob Todaro didn't even make the squad. Even if Monday's game is cancelled, next Friday's home opener, against Utica, looks like a good bet to be played. Considering the weather, the field is in fairly dry condition, and those tremendous box seat bleachers, actually the worst seats in the house because they are so far from the field_, have been set up in front of the gym. As an interesting sidenote, Coach Lawrence, upon questioning, revealed his feelings about the current major league players' strike, saying that the players are asking too much. ••Jt's gotten all out of proportion,\ stated Lawrence. ''In fact all sports have. Just look at the NBA~ABA battle.\ He also criticiiled -the owners \fot not sticking together;'' as in the case of the Yankees management saying that they'd be happy to pay Vida Blue $125,000. Lawrence feels· that ••No one ,player is worth $100,000, not even Mickey Mantle.\ .. ''~\.:\~~~.~~:;~ llison ReLAXes For Opener by MARK MINDEL Weather could be the biggest obstacle facing the Dutchmen LaX .players as they' orepare for their opening game against Siena, in Loudenville, Tuesday April llth. The team has had its share of problems due to the cold and the field conditions, and has been unable to practice yet on its home Daley Field, while the snow and mushy grounds of the · Nott Street field have limited practise there. Allison cites a healthy Mark Sanderson as the key to his potentially dangerous offense, while he looks for steady improvement ·from sophomore Dennis Walker, who was a mid- fielder last season. Allison says Walker is coming on like ·~gangbusters'' and if he keeps progressing he has a definite chance of becomin.g an \outstanding Iacross~! player.\ Allison is very pleased with the teams' morale. He says the players have shown great desire and a healthy attitude. . Allison hopes the team Will at least break .500, and is counting on easily out-doing last year's 2-7 record. However he is realistic about. the extremely outside cpance of h;;~:ving an undefea;tep Stl!l~Qll; and · sets an g;3. mark a~. tt ;top-_go.al to strive for. Allison -.expects · Cortland, Syracuse, and Ho-bart to be extremely tough matches. A good crowd out at Siena would be e~tremely helpful to get the LaX-men on their way to a winning season. . ,· '. ·.,' ;')•, ' Siena opened its season last Saturday being defeated at home by the Mohawk Lacrosse Club, 10 to 5. The Indians next match .is this Saturday against C.C.N.Y. so game experience could be : another important factQr.

Amherst, Williams, and Albany State have been contactecl l;lut can not scrimmage, so Coach Allison .may have·to rely on Cobleskill Ag ~.nd Te~q fqr tomorrow. The Garnet team is still yet to play. Coach Allison will be counting h~avily on· his '~solid\ defense 1 . made up entirely of seniors, . hQwever he looks for his attack to have a good day Tuesday against Siena's fairly weak .goal.

Well, Union CoU~ge tennis doesn't quite rate ~~.----b:ut it definitely deserves the former.- This year's Union College Tennis Team is bouncing back from a slightly sub.-.500 record last year. However all but one of the lettermen from last year's team is back, there are six in aU, and hopes for a winning season are high. J.V. Lacro~S'e takes its rightful position in the spring sport's spectrum April 18, when Coach Bob McMurry's squad meets Siena at home. Lacrosse, long a favorite a~ong the British ancl Canadiens, is catching on in the U.S. The game resembles hockey in some respects but has a differ.ent-shaped club in which the ball is carried to the goal. Cuts have .still to be made because .of the poor weather, but once they are, the team will have to settle down and start. to ~ contemplate its first opponent, Hobart, whic.h travels to Schenectady April 14th. The squad will be trimmed to eleven members, ·with six competing in singles matches and three sets competing jn doubles.

8 CONCORDIENSIS, Friday, April~~ 1972 Revived WRUC Begins New Term Sharlet Continued from Page 1 last night's lecture and discussion in Hale House Student Lounge. On April 17, Professor Calabria and Political Science Professor Byron Nichols are the faculty members who wiii be discussing their individual fields of research and their roles as ~·teachers~· in the second session of this ·lecture~ discussion series entitled \The Professor as a Scholar.\ Trustees to Meet On Campus by DAVID ENGEL This spring WRUC has begun one of its most ambitiom. terms in recent years. With seventy members the station has easily filled. all its air time, and, except for some transmitter trouble earlier this week, should be on the air at least during the usual 7 a.m. - 2 a.m. schedule. Special features highlight this term's programming, and of particular note is the 9~10 p.m. spot on Monday nights when a member of the faculty will take the air. This series~ originally slated to begin last Monday, will start Monday April 10, with Professor David Stineback of the English Department. The only requirement the station has placed on the guest faculty member is his appearance; the rest of the hour is his to fill. Other noteworthy features include Paul Delfin's 7~9 a.m. wake-up show (Monday~Friday), the return of Zeb and Lester on Tuesdays. 10 p.m.-Midnight, and the Thursday night Midnight~2 a.m. gold show. Sundays are loaded with specials, starting with Harry Tipton, who checks on the campus hangover from 9 a.m.-Noon, and then the Petition Continued from Page 1 ideals of Union College. We propose that the faculty self-regqlate the tenure system accotdlng to .rigorous guidelines \ In existence since Wednesday, the petition has_ already secured the signatures of over seven~ hundred students and approximately seventy faculty members. One member of the group of students circulating the petition, who asked not to be identified, said that \this petition represents the first unified effort of faculty and students toward the abolition of the limit and the institution of an equitable system, one that will be financially responsible and encourage an· improvement of academic and environment.\ ongoing Union's social When asked what chance the measure would have for adoption he commented, \l cannot be sure, perhaps no one can be. What we must hope is that those members of the Union community with whom the responsibility for this decision rests will recognize the unity of our appeal and the need to shift to the kind of system we seek.\ South Africa Continued from Page 1 There are approximately 300 American corporations in South Africa. These companies represent a total investment of $834 million, which is 15% of all foreign investment in that country. These corporations represent American know~how, openness to change, and creativity; most importantly, McKee said, they should represent the ideals of liberty and freedom. But, these companies are acquiescing in the systematic oppression .of 70% of the population of South Africa. In McKee's wotds, everyone should be asking himself: \Can 1 derive, without question, profits from an American company whose operations in South Africa result in the oppression of the non~ white members of that society? When does the conscience come in?\· Although he found conditions for the black South Africans to be \dismal McKee said that he has not lost hope. •'The minute you lose hope, you're dead,\ he concluded.

TilE NEW RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE will . . . A comni.:ittee of Union students consisting of Virginia, Lyle, Jill Manning, Mary Ann Kingham and Steve ·Cassella has recently completed an in-depth in'lestigation of Union College's involvement in the Academic Opportunities Consortium. The students' investigation reveals much about Union's ''commitment\ to providing special assistance to students from \low\ s·ocio-economic backgrounds. The original idea of the new program was to attract private and state funds to aid Union in developing the project. Skidmore and RPI expressed an •early interest in becoming involved in the new program. ln its early stages, the program was called Project Hope (Higher Opportunity through Education). During the winter of 1968-69, the Board of Trustees approved an effort by Union College to recruit students for the AOC program in the six-county area centered around Albany and Schenectady. The recruiting and subsequent admissions process -of AOC students was carried out separately from that of the rest of the class of '73 to be enrolled in September of 1969. The following year, admissions under the AOC program were turned over to the regular Admissions Office. be stampeding into Schenectady this week for a concert at the Proctor's Theatre.

Tickets arf! on sale at the Student Activities The Origins of AOC In the fall of 1968, John Terry - Director of Upward Bound - initiated actions aimed at setting up a. program to provide assistance to low-income students possessing high mental capabilities and potential to The colleges interested in the pr~gram set up a committee of individuals sympathetic to, and concerned with the goal of bringing greater numbers of low- income students into college. The First Year According to the investigating students, approximately sixty students were admitted in September 1969 under the AOC Program to Union, Skidmore and RPI; twenty-one of the sixty were enrolled at Union. For the newly admitted AOC students, several special services were available including free tutoring, counseling, a reduced course load, and remedial math and reading assistance. Office. A preliminary program was devised to be held as a six-week summer session at Skidmore's New Campus. The preliminary project was designed to expose students to the expectations of colleg~ level study. The summer sessions provided students with courses in remedial reading and math; those students who were to Tenure Committee: Outlook Uncertain Financial Assistance For support of the t\OC efforts at Union in 1969-70, money was receiyed from the State of New York, the Board of Trustees, the Ford Foundation, and the H\earst Foundation. Much of this aid went to the financing of the special summer sessions. The remainder of the funds were used for the full payment of tuition, room, board, remedial courses, tutors, counselors, medical and dental aid. books, general supplies, and incidental expenses. by PETER DICKERMAN A signi'fica'nr meeting- concerning the tenure situation was held here over the past weekend, but its long~term consequences are still uncertain, and differing views have been expressed as to just how much has been accomplished in the effort to end the present 60% tenure limitation.

Cunliffe has served as a police management consultant and as an advisor to a number of governmental agencies. He has degrees from the University of Michigan, the University of New Hampshire and the University of Maryland. His Ph.D., earned in 1954 from the University of Maryland, was in bio-chemistry. One of the two men who founded the College of Criminal Justice a.t Northeastern in 1967, he is looked upon as a pioneer in poiice higher education and as one ·of the foremost criminalists in the nation.

Zion Church and is Continued on Page 4 Zaleznick Tells Of Leadership byTIM CAIN Abraham Zaleznik, a professor at Harvard Business School, delivered a paper entitled \Charismatic and Consensual Leaders: A Psychological Comparison\ to an audience of eighty people in SS 016 last night. A charmismatic leader, according to Zalesznik's definition, depends on mass appeal; he has a calculating mind; he manipulates relationships so that rewards pass through him on the way to others. He is characterized by cleverness, adroitness, and flexibility. A charismatic leader, as a maximum man, is usually either a demonic, malevolent person,. such as Hitler, or a saintly leader, such as Ghandi. They are .. great men,\ who feel fortified with a sense of being favored or chosen. A minimum man often appears bland and opaque; his psychological posture is that of a \survivor Zaleznik said. A minimum man, according to Zaleznik, intellectually \lives out of a suitcase.\ He has many friends but few close relationships. In his work, he tends to be a dilletante feigning sincerity and interest. He might have many sexual affairs, but few with real involvement on his part. A mass audience would provide little warmth and support for a minimum man. Zaleznik made it clear that he feels personality is a crucial, determining factor affecting the performance of any leader. In response to a question from the audience, he said that the democratic process often provides \the leader we want,\ although this leader is not necessarily the leader we need. Lyndon Johnson was characterized by Zaleznik as kind of a \brother figure.\ This kind of personality is common in the Senate, where, in an ideal integration of role and personality, Johnson met the demands of consensus style in his role as Majority Leader. Truman's style was more that of a clever, manipulative, maximum man. Eisenhower, according to Zaleznik, gained wide accbptance and popularity because he bad sort of a \kindly grandfather\ image. Woodrow Wilson, in his efforts to get the world to accept his League of Nations idea, acted like \an angry father\ dealing with unruly sons; In a final question, Professor laleznik said that he could think of no one presently on the political scene who could fit his description of ••a charismatic man.''·

Many argue that Union's role should be to educate an elite corps of highly intelligent individuals. These people maintain that the College best serves humanity by supplying a well-educated minority which will serve as important managers and decision-makers m corporations and governments; from these key positions in society, Union graduates will be able to help guide men and machines in the best possible manner for the benefit of all. This perception of Union's role must be rejected. For 175 years, this college has helped educate the nation's elite and it seems that the time has come for that policy to be seriously reconsidered. Certainly no one would argue that Union should .. not educate those individuals who score well on conventional tests of intelligence and ability, but it must be recognized that the validity of conventional tests is highly doubtful in many instances. The end gqal of all educational institutions should be to benefit all of mankind. It would be of little consequence if Union had the \best\ faculty and student body in the country if the rest of the world is going to hell. Bad Peiformance ''Performance\ was the Film Haps feature this past weekend. It is kind of a strange movie. It would probably be a real challenge for a film editor to understand \Performance\ and discuss it intelligently in a review. Understanding and enjoying any movie shown by Film Haps has become increasingly difficult due to technical problems caused, in part, by equipment that is either obsolete or improperly .maintained, or lack of care and competence on the part of the people who are showing the film. The audio portion of ''Performance'' was filled with so much static, and was so gritty, it sounded like the film was left on the beach all summer. Film goers who went to see \Yellow Submarine\ last term had the rare pleasure of watching three or four reels of flickering, skipping, leaping film. It is understandable if these technical problems occur every now and then; it is intolerable when they occur with such regularity that watching a Film Haps movie means that you sit in a hot, smoke-filled room where you are subjected to all varieties of audio and visual distortions of the movie you paid a dollar to see.

I would suggest .that the Committee on Salary, Promotion and Tenure be charged with recommending salary increments that would be in line with the amou~t that the college <;an afford to expend without seriously crippling the academic program or other essential .services. The two ml!ior arguments ~gainst self- regulation that I have encountered center around our financial situation and the increase in salary that usually accompanies the .granting of tenure and the theory that a cy_cling of new blood is needed to strengthen the college. If we understand and accept the fact that promotion in some cases may not be accompanied by a large lump-sum increase in salary then we can effectively negate the first Portion of the argument against st::lf regulation.

Woody Gutherz West College \Bear's'' Plan The recent (last eighteen months) agitation over tenure has produced almost universal rejection of the 60% tenure 11 limitation by faculty and students. At this point we seem to be operating in a vacuum where we don't like what we have but are unsure about .proposing alternatives. For the sake of discussion I would like to propose an alternative that I feel would be compatible with the concept of self regulation as outlined in the petition currently being circulated around campus. The number of tenured and untenured slots in any department would be decided on an annual basis by a vote of all department members, the students elected to sit on deparfments by their peers and the Dean of the Faculty. In this way the faculty would have a central role in detet:mining the shape of the department and students and administrators would be able to make a substantial input. Due to the financial realities of our situation any plan involving self-regulation would have to include a proviso that tenure and promotion to the rank of associate professor would not necessarily include a large jump in salary for affected Betrayal As you know, members of the younger generation are often . acpus.~.4 ... of indifference to Noble Traditi«;>,IJ; i'Ul,~, the Great Men of Our Country's Pa,st ...

CONCORDIENSIS, Wednesday, Apri/12, 1972 3 More AOC History Is Union Racist? Continued from Page 1 First Year Results According to Ms. Manning and company, by the mid-point of the 1970~71 school year, four of the ' original twenty-ene AOC students at Union had Ie'rt school for various reasons and five were on Academic Warning. Apparently, thirteen of the original twenty-one were still maintaining a status of .. good standing.\ Union Cuts Back on AOC In 1970, Union admitted for the class of '74 only nine students' under the AOC Program. During the same period, Skidmore and RPI maintained their AOC Programs at a level almost equal to that of the. previous year; at the same time, Russell Sage and Siena Co,J!ege ·entered the Consortium and begl).li admitting qualified low-income students. For the class of 1975, no students were admitted to Union in the fall of •71 under the AOC Program. Those students in the classes of Y73 and 1 74 admitted under the AOC Brogram are continuing to receive aid. While Union was dramatically cutting back on A OC, the other colleges in the Consortium continued to admit students under the Program. The Original Commitment The students investigating AOC report that when the Program was original!)' conceived, the Committee formed· by the participating colleges stated that \the Consortium fully expects (and has co:tpmitments) to enroll up to sixty students per year leading to a total enrollment after five years of some two-hundred and forty to two-hundred and fifty students in all phases ... the Consortium has agreed to provide as feasible the necessary components enumerated above; however, in a time when deficits are cornmon it is apparent that the commitment is one of a felt need rather than an allocation of available resources.\ Obviously, the actions of the last two years indicate that Union feels incapable of maintaining its share of AOC. The student committee strongly questions the view that Union cannot afford to maintain AOC. The students cite Skidmore's smaller eodowment and higher deficit than that of Union as proof of Union's lack of any real commitment to the stated goals of a few years ago. Skidmore, unlike Union; has continued an active AOC Program despite serious economic difficulties at the Saratoga College. The Current Situation Last fall, interested faculty of Union went to officials in the State of New York to see if more money was available for support of AOC at Union. According to State officials, Union was not sufficiently committed to the goals of AOC and therefore did not merit the reception of additional State funds. State officials cited the reduction of new students enrolled at Union under AOC over the past few years as proof of the college's \lack of commitment.\ Our investigating team tells us that when AOC was initiated it was admitted by all participants to be a \high risk\ enterprise. No one was certain that the AOC students would be able to perform at the college level. At the time of AOC's formation, Union could define their own academic requirements for admissions under the program; Union only had to follow the financial guidelines set by the State. Since the first year of AOC's existence, the State has set restrictions on the academic entrance requirements to go along with financial guidelines. Urrion has objected to the State's guidelines on aid for· AOC. Apparently. the College claims that the imposed guidelines wo1:1ld severely limit the 'flexibility of the program for the participating institutions. Union is currently waiting for the State's response to the objections voiced by Union .and otqer colleges in the AOC Program. On March 28, \after study of the objectives, financing, and three-year history of the Academic Opportunity Program, the Budget a.nd Priorities Committee\ recommended to the All Qollege Senate the following resolution: Union College should continue the AOC Program, toward a future goal of 40 .students, by admitting as a portion of. next year's freshman class approximately ten students meeting state criteria for support to s1:1ch programs. Such state criteria shall be substantially in line with those enforced for similar programs administered by the State University of New York. Incoming AOC. students should be provided with: (1) a six- week summer program of compensatory education, (2) financial aid equal to their needs, and (3) improved support services in areas such as tutoring. Furthermore, the improved tutoring services should be available to aU students needing academic assistance. Expenditures ou the AOC program, . above and beyond costs . to the college of 30 \typical\ Union College students who would fill their places during the 1972-73 academic year, should not exceed $50,000 and this figure should be substantially reduced for subsequent years. Since Union is already financing about twenty AOC students, we are talking about an increase in the student aid budget of approximately $15,000 for the next year. It now seems doubtful that Union is planning to increase the number of AOC students to the relatively high levels originally enrolled in the class of '73. Three years ago, Union committed itself to twenty AOC students in a single class, now the College is hoping to raise the program to a level of forty AOC students in the entire institution. In 1968 the Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders was completed and stated that ··what white Americans have never fully understood ~ but what the Negro C$1 never forget- is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it and white society condones it.\ What we are concerned with is the manner in which Union College perpetuates racism in our .society. Insti- tutional racism is often a very subtle and covert type of racism, just as harmful ·as other forms but harder to recognize. It originated out of the ethnocentric attitude that white culture and norms are superior to all other types of life styles. This assumption has often made whites insensitive to people 9f different cultures. We refer to the Japanese as copyists, A~abs as nomads and the American· Indians are labelled \a primitive culture.\ The Black student at Union faces a similar problem.

Yet the Democrats will continue to escalate their internecine campaigning in the future months, and concentrate their verbiage on each other rather than on Dick Nixon. No single candidate has yet been able to emerge as the con sensus candidate for the Democratic Party, and the confusion among the Democrats is further compounded by the fact that none of the primaries so far ha¥e shown any conclusive results. New Hampshire and Florida were regional races, Illinois wasn't even a race, and the Republican cross-over Vote in Wisconsin scrambled the results there. There are about 300 delegate votes at stake in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania on April 25th, and hopefully these contests will help clarify apd define a front- runner and add a little more unity to the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party needs more inconclusive primaries like it needs Dick Nixon in the White House next year. culture is considered a diseased and worthless subculture. Foi: the most part, colleges have been .educating blacks according to the values, norms and meanings of the dominant white culture in an attempt to put them in the 1 mainstream of American life. For Blacks; integration has come to mean assimilation or ••Americanization\ an attempt to destroy their cultural and ethnic identity. How is Union a part of it? From the top on down Union is deeply embedded with institutionally racist attitudes and policies, many unintentional but all a product of white ethnocentrism. The Board of Trustees is a completely white decision~making body and has the final say on all budgetary priorities and college policies. Our administratjon is primarily white and has a similar effect on academic and social affairs. Students are admitted to Union by standards created and controlled by whites (CEEB, SAT, ACT examinations) which automatically eliminates a significant number of Black applicants. Many Black high school graduates come from schools which face similar institutionally racist problems. In the curriculum the number of Black related courses has decreased by 7 5% since 1969. Our faculty has only two Blacks on it each of whom has been here for six years. Two other professors presently at Union who teach Black related courses will be gone by the end of next year. Other courses seldom contain texts written by Black authors. In addition to these difficulties, the Black student faces problems in housing. White students as well as the administration are often insensitive to different life- styles. A recent N.Y. Times article (Tuesday April 4, p. 1) referred to the battle between soul and hard rock music in the dormitories. Only minimal efforts have been made to establish a Black cultural center on campus open to all students who choose that life style. Faced with these and other problems, if a Black student wants to talk about them, there is an all white counseling department to serve his needs. · Our budgetary priorities seem to ignore any responsibility of the college in fighting racism. We spend $880,000 in restoring North (to a Holiday Inn), $25,000 on building a new gate and find $100,000 for prize scholarships regardless of need but money for Black scholarships and programs is very scar~e. The enrollment in each class has decreased since 1969 not only because of lack of scholarships but because Blacks do not recommend Union to their friends. Union is rapidly turning into an institution serving an academic elite, as indicated by the concern that Board scores were lower in this year's freshmen class, as well as the creation of prize scholarships. With rising tuition, Union's student body yearly consists of more students from higher socio~ economic backgrounds. To prevent this trend towards an elitist institution, we suggest that a commission be formed immediately to -study racism in curriculum, budgetary priorities, administration, admission, housing and all other aspects of the college community. We must reorder and redefine Union's responsibility to the rest of the American society. Steve Cassella Jill Manning· Mary Ann Kingham V. Lyle

Ruggers Looking To Lose \Rag Tag\ -\Laugher\ Image by BILL HOLLERAN An ever..:hopeful Garnet rugby club opens its 1972 spring season on Saturday, traveling to Hamilt<e~n; N.Y. to face a talented Colgate fifteen. Union's fortunes can only be on the upswing after last fall's performance, in which the Dutchmen dropped all four of their games - i,ncluding a 45-3 laughex at the hands of Williams. In the last eigbt seasons, a total of about 30 games, the Garilet boast but one win and ·one tie; The Dutchmen are looking to overhaul last fall's ragtag team, a squad which often was forced to play without many of its best pl~yets due · to injuries or absenteeism. Several seasoned veterans, returning to action after missing the fall season for various reasons, should bolster play significantly both in Union's serum and along the offensive line. Dan Rapalje, a big. and experienced scruhlmer who saw action in only one fall contest, is expected to return to full-time duty this spring. His beefy presence can only strengthen one of the smallest group of forwards in the Northeast. Cbip Perry and John McCall, two more seasoned scrummers, also have been out for spring prac*e after an autumn sabbatical. Union's remaining. first-string scrummers, co-captain Garry Lynch, Pat Wardell, Bill Kuchta, Bin Holleran, Bruce Ba~chelder, are all veterans but whatever guts and hustle they are able to exhibit in a game are usually overshadowed by the opposition's bulk. As a result, in past games the Garnet lightweights have had an exceedingly tough time in keeping or regaining possession of the ball in lineouts, rucks, or formal serums. Another glaring problem spot for the Dutchmen last fall was the wing position. However, that problem could be solved this season by a couple more returnees from last spring's 1-3 unit, the only UniQn team to win a rugby game in 'nearly four years. - SANDY SCORES: Mark Sanderson had a hot hand Tuesday scoring ~en points on six assists and four goals to lead the way for the LaX men. disappointing record, (2-7), the win, although over a weak Siena squad, is hopefully a good sign.

Saturday, the Dutchmen will travel to Stevens. Although Coach Gary Walters has a young squad to work with, the team has a good deal of experience. Walters is optimistic that the team will improve on last year's dismal 3~5 season. Soph co- captain Marty Cukierman said that the team has showed marked improvement, and he is confident that they will do well. Union's · netmen are looking for their first winning season in the last ten years. This year, the netters are scheduled to face twelve opponents in the short, four-week season, including two very tough clubs, Vermont and Rochester. Both of those matches will be at home. Friday's match against Hobart will probably see Marty Cukierman in the first slot. Marty was Union's number one man for the second half of last year, after fighting off a bout of mononucleosis. He is in good health this year, and figures to help the Garnet cause considerably. A very promising freshman, Kevin Crawford, seems to he a good bet to play in the second position. Junior Stu Fishier, Cukierman's doubles partner from last year, is not yet in top form, but will capably fill one of the remaining singles spots, along with Junior co- captain Jim Skiff, and Freddie Kaplan. Hobart defeated the Dutchmen 7-2 last year, while Stevens feU to the Gamet by the same score. The Hobart match will begin at 2:00 p.m. Friday at Union's tennis courts.

Barry Gross got the Garnet hopes off to a good start as he scored the first of his three goals at the four minute mark in the first period. After that it was all Mark Sanderson, as the shifty senior accounted for lO Union scores. Mark who adorns this year's cover of a National lacrosse magazine, was all over the field scoring four goals and assisting on six others. This year's attack shapes up very well with Mark, Barry, Dennis Walker and Bob Grossman all playing well.

Union's fortunes can only be on the upswing after last fall's performance, in which the Dutchmen dropped all four of their games - including a 45-3 Iaugher at the hands of Williams. In the last eight seasons, a total of about 30 games, the Garnet boast but one win and one tie. The Dutchmen are looking to overhaul last fall's ragtag team, a squad which often was forced to play without many of its best players due to injuries or absenteeism. Several seasoned veterans, returning to action after missing the fall season for various reasons, should bolster play significantly both in Union's serum and along the offensive line. Dan Rapalje, a big and experienced scrummer who saw action in only one fall contest, is expected to return to full-time duty this spring.

As a matter of , fact, his first words at the podium were, \I feel like President Nixon up here.\ During the speech, he got around to thanking everyone who had something to do with his success. He praised his parents and all his coaches and proclaimed a deep respect for their honesty. While talking about his relationship with Coach Walters, he spoke of their first meeting.

Recently, Union College grid veteran Tom Ana~ker the hard-nosed middle and outside linebacker on the 1971 football team, was named for the second straight year to the NCAA college division Academic All-American Football Team. Anacker was a standout as both the strongside linebacker and as the middle linebacker when forced to replace the injured Ken Gray. As a junior last grid season he led the team in tackles and was selected to the weekly ECAC Defensive squat of the week for an amazing 38 tackles in the Hobart game. Anacker's style of play is ideal for a linebacker. Says roommate M. K. Kumpf, '72, \He's tough as nails ... he tackles with his head.\ Anacker should be at wide linebacker next season with Gray returning to the center spot; both should be the nucleus to a defense which could key the success of the squad. Anacker was one of only three repeaters on the twenty member Tom Anacker as quarterback for Parker High School in Janesville, Wisconsin first team. Tom was selected on the basis of his 3.2 cumulative average to go with his standout defensive performances. Anacker also received several statewide honors for his 1971 performances. Tom was named to the All-New York ..State Team and was picked for the Eastern College Athletic, Division IU, All~Star squad. described as · frustrated Alumni Gym hoopers, or men who'd be able to say that they once saw so and so in '72, (after all Julius Erving, Ernie DeGregorio, Marvin Barnes, etc. had all been participants in past years) or just plain U. Col. zooers who'd had too much juice at Zebo's Bar and Grill's opening the same evening and had landed at Pleasant because they were too intoxicated to think of any better way to blow three bills. Regardless, the games we saw that night could be best described as a game of faces and hands and a King. As the New York State team warmed up one could easily notice the astonished looks on the countenance of the crowd as Mount Vernon's 6-5 Bill Tatum arched the ball consistently through the hoop from a distance Patton's artillery would have been proud to hit fifty per-cent from. Or to notice the · bending necks that tried to catch a glimpse of the bottoms of 6-4 Gary Johnson's shoes as he often skyed high enough to seemingly precede. the ball through th.e hoop, feet first. A Face in the Crowd The most interesting of all was the face of the assistant coach of the state all-stars, a diminuative Italian once known as Jim Tedisco, now Coac;h Tedisco, remember him? The face was optimistic (why not, he had BUI Tatum who had torn apart Dave Modest, John DiBiase, and Nate Bland for close to forty points the week before?). The face was attentive for he was learning tricks to be used in his future - hopefully as a coach. The face was also happy, why not, with the three-an-hour announcements of his Tuesday testimonial and the overwhelming reception of the crowd it was almost like he was being canonized in the Cathedral of the Mont Pleasant.

8 CONCORDIENSIS, .Wednesdt~y, Apri/12, 1972 by SCOTT FEUER Union College appears to be populated by a majority of narrow-minded people, who not only dominate the life .style of the college community, but also, by their very nature, impart a certain aura to the college which tends to attract similar types of individuals, thus serving only to perpetuate the situation. Campus Slumbers researchers and ·publishers, w.hich is a ftirthev outgrowth of the administration's disregard for the students' interest. Another possibility could be the wideni,ng of college eating facilities, bringing more people together more often. This should· all 'be in addition to the much needed conve~sion of Carnagie .HaJI into And What Else Is New? And this can be observed at all levels. The social committee is in a continual bind to find groups which will attract a great number of students to its concerts. One consequence has been that interesting and different performers, who should have helped broaden the horizons 9f the Union student, have instead played to half empty houses with resulting monetary losses. Social conscience at Union can be likened to the following of a basketball team during a losing season. Putting aside regional and national politics (both of which seem little to enter the Union student's mind), a possible gauge of social responsibility may be the number of students working in the community, or who are involved with such school affiliated programs as Big Brother. That number is perturbingly low, and gives cause to wonder whether most Union st11dents think much beyond themselves. The Student Senate is another case in point. Attendance at meetings only pa!\ailels the effectiveness of college-wide surveys. Other college organizations also suffer attendance problems, and some of them deal with this quite interestingly. A method used to attract attention to P. Y. E. meetings during the latter part of last term was to put at the top ·of posters, in large letters, NCAA, which captured most everyone's attention during the basketball tournament controversy. Are sports related issues the only ones to receive attention at Union? Is the college apathetic? The answer seems to lie in another question - Is the Pope Catholic? I used the term ·~college com- munity\ previously, and consider it misused. I feel it is a grave mistake· to consider Union hav·ing any sense of community, where the onlv demonstration by a sizeable number of students and faculty of such a community was attendance at basketball games, This in itself is not bad,. but if it is the only example of \community\ Union has to show, then something must be wrong. Furthermore, the dog.matism of the present college administration certainly doesn't give a student a sense of oneness with the college, and a flagrant example of this can be observed in the present controversy over tenure. This problem did bring some students and faculty together, but a question of this magnitude Should have attracted the participation of more than just 15~20% of the student population. Perhaps this situation is only the result of what a student must go through to achieve his goals. In a college were approximately 25% of the present freshman class is Pre-med, a minimum of 20% of every freshman class are engineers by \college law'', together with those who are concerned with going into other highly competitive fields such as pyschology and law, the student's exc11se seems to be that he or she must spend a great majority of time working. And any free time appears to degenerate into \Camp Union\ atmosphere. Fraternities also come into question here, for any college- wide· or community event (eg. clam bake) sponsored by fraternities is more than offset by their fragmenting the student body, decreasing the chances of ever forming any ty.pe. of college community, and continuing a I exhibition andsale . origiilal graphics purchases may be charged UNION COLLEGE Davidson House Lounge Thursday, Aprill3 12 noon to 8 p.m. CHAGAlL, BASKfN, ROUAUlt, DAUMIER AND MANY OTHERS ARRANGED BY FERDINAND ROTEN ~AUERIES BAL TIMOR£, MARYLAND way of life that only ingrains the status quo and all its ensuing inequities.

Solutions? Perhaps the Admissions Department should actively search out those with such qualities as to be able to handle other things besides their own personal. goal aspirations, and keep to a minimum the mediocracv we have now.

In a meeting Monday afternoon, the concerned faculty members passed the following resolution: \The Union College Chapter of the AAUP finds the present sixty percent limitation on faculty tenure completely unacceptable. The Chapter views any arbitrary limitation on tenure as artificial and not in the best interests of the College as an educational institution. \The Chapter strongly endorses the current petition being · circulated in the community that calls for a system of self-· regulation on the part of the faculty with respect to the granting of tenure. \We therefore, strongly urge that the sixty percent rule be rescinded without further delay.\ The resohttion was passed unanimously after considerable discussion. There was some discussion over whether the wording should be changed; some present at the meeting expressed sentiments that the faculty should \demand\ rather than simply \urge\ that the sixty percent rule be rescinded. The AAUP chapter expects to complete a full detailed statement on the tenure issue within a few weeks. The faculty attending the meeting devoted considerable time to discussing possible strategies for future actions if or when the Board of Trustees rejects their appeal on tenure. It is apparent that many on the faculty are willing to take drastic measures in order to combat the undesired tenure rule.

The understatement of the hour is that Vietnamization has failed and President Nixon has obviously not extricated America from the rice paddies, jungles, waters or skies of war-torn Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Having never expected Nixon to really bring peace to Southeast Asia, the current events should come as no real surprise. If the war is to be ended, for Americans and Asians, then it is the people who must eRd it; Nixon will not. It is time, once again, to tell the bomber boys on the Potomac that their policies are unwanted and unsupported. Hopefully, this spring we will all act intelligently in our attempts to say NO to the President and his pals. We can begin by registering to vote; in the Democratic primaries, maBy of us will have an opportunity to voice our strong opposition to Nixon's polici~s by voting for a real alternative and anti-war candidate. We can also· voice opposition to current events through public airing of our positions. Whatever opponents of Nixon and the war do this year, it is vital that we do not alienate potential allies such as blue-collar workers. The blue-collar is angry at Nixon because of inflation; he may be ready to desert his President. We do not want to chase potential friends into the arms of George C. Wallace. =-ooccooc::::-o=c===~==-=====~ Letter~ Gravel- Airs War Views On March 23, 1972, I introduced in the Senate legislation to halt immediately further U.S. bombing in Indochina and to require the total withdrawal of all U.S. military and paramilitary (e.g. CIA) personnel from Vietnam. Cambodia, and Laos within 30 days after enactment. This bill, S. 3409, is explained fully in the enclosed remarks reprinted from the Congressional Record. and a copy of the bill itself is included on page two. The U.S. air war over Indochina has· escalated steadily during the past several months. in direct contradiction of President Nixon's public assertions that the war continues to wind down. Due to public pressure American ground troops ate slowly coming home, but they are leaving an automated war behind. -computer technology and a small number of troops manning aircraft and artillery are creating a U.S. destructive presence that may literally hover over Southeast Asia for years to come. The President's troop cuts in South Vietnam do not affect U.S. firepower in Southeast Asia at all because the planes are based in Thailand and on aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin. At the same time that the President is stepping up the bombing. he is imposing ever more serious strictures on the release of information about the air war. Newsmen have never been allowed to go out on bombing raids outside 0f Vietnam, and all information about the air war except gross tonnages and sorties has been kept from the public by classifying it secret. Official statistics released on the air war are now more bare-bones than ever, and press briefings are designed to accentuate the positive rather than provide hard facts on the continuing U.S. role in the war. Most recently, for the first time since bombing of North Vietnam began eight years ago, the U.S. Command in Saigon refused to give out figures on the number of planes flying missions in the North. In the face of this news blackout on the air war I want to encourage you, as the editor of your school's newspaper, to provide your readers with candid information on this issue, and thus to join me in this election year to force an end to the war. Students have been leaders in pointing out the tragedy a·nd mistake of Vietnam, and their help will now be vital in turning out of office those politicians who will not join us in ending the war. I hope that those Americans throughout the country who are concerned about the immorality of the war will attend political meetings wherever there is a candidate, and ask him this very simple question: \How do you stand on ending the war?\ If the candidate does not stand for ending the war as provided in my simple and clear proposal, then I hope the American people will not vote for him, for he does not deserve to occupy a high position in the government of this country. S. 3409 now has fifteen cosponsor'\ in the Senate, and identical legislation introduced m the House of Representatives is supported by 44 members of that body. l am enclosing a list of fhe names of those individuals so that students may see if their own senators and representatives are included. If you need further information on the legislation, please contact my office or the National Student Lobby, which is coordinating efforts on behalf of this bill within the student community. Sincerely, Mike Grave~ United States Senate Washington, D.C. LETTERS Tenure Still Issue Offense to College Community ln the past week, several events have transpired that have demonstrated the College community's oYerwhelming opposition to the 60% tenure ceiling. The petition in favor of faculty self regulation was signed by over 1000 students and 80 faculty members. The position expressed in this petition has been endorsed by the Student Senate, the All College Senate, and the Union ·Chapter of the American Association of University Professors. Letters have gone out to the parents of all Union students and the initial replies have also shown considerable support for our stance. These statements of concern for the future of Union indicate the necessity for an immediate resolution of this intolerable situation. At this juncture, it appears that a decision will not be reached at Friday's meeting of the Board of Trustees. We view this possibility as a breach of faith by the Board and an offense to the College community. The faculty, students, and reputation of Union College only stand to suffer from any further delay. Students and faculty are already feeling the detrimental effects of the ceiling. Certainly, there has been ample time spent and consideration given to arrive at an equitable solution to the tenure issue. The formation of rigorous, reasonable guidelines for faculty self regulation is more than possible at this time. Whether guidelines are proposed at Friday's meeting or not, it is clearly time for the Board to make a statement of principle on the tenure limit. A considerable number of the Board's constituents have spoken in opposition. We strongly urge the Board to rescind the 60% tenure ceiling at once. To postpone any action now, until June or perhaps later, will prevent a majority of the campus from being present at or having any meaningful say in any resolution of this important problem.

April 22nd is a day of international protest against the war as other demonstrations are to be held in Los Angeles, France, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium, Canada, England, Ireland, Lebanon, Luxembourg, New Zealand, and Scotland. In this country April 22nd is being sponsored by the National Peace Action Coalition. Although there was not much sentiment for national demonstrati-ons when the National Peace Action Coalition planned the actions early in December of 1971, thdr feeling was that when the truth about Nixon's war plans became apparent the people would respond. The overwhelming majority of the Americaa people oppose the war, and 65% actually believe that the war is morally wrong. It is clear now that \Vietnamization\ means the continuation and intensification of the air war, th~;: remaining presence of tens of thousands of U.S. \support\ troops in South Vietnam, thousands more on carriers off the coast of Vietnam, tens of thousands more in Thailand, and the indefinite bankrolling of unpopular governments and mercenary armies throughout Southeast Asia.

What was demanded however was an end to the war not a change in tactics and a continuation of the slaughter. A massive,,.active antiwar movement must be built to bring about the termination of U.S. involvement in an immoral and unjust war. The April 22nd demonstration could prove to be a great step in building such a movement.

CONCORDIENSIS, Tuesday, Apri/18, 1972 3 At The Helm, Are We On? By JOHN HARRIGAN Spring on a New England campus not only means the termination of the endless tundra conditions, but also the beginning of the baseball and softball seasons. ·This Spring, of course, has seen the first major league players strike in. baseball history, in protest of their slave labor conditions which pays the average man about $22,000 per 'se.ason.

Add the eased taxes on buo.iness, not on wage freeze in Phase I and the wage itattons m Phase U and a significant part of the 'economic issue' McGovern and Wallace have been benefitting from begins to emerge. Finally, we're paying too much this year. The current IRS tax withholding schedules will result in about $8 billion being over withheld in 1972. While their bureaucracy is trying to get it together, taxpayers will have to wait until next April to get their $8 billion back. The economy is $80 billion below its full-employment potential right now. These extra tax collections will limit the growth of purchasing power a~d further prolong economic recovery efforts. more equitable tax structure in the future? Not very likely. If Nixon is re-elected, it is plausible to speculate that his top tax · priority will be to introduce the value-add.ed tax (VAT) in January, 1973. The VAT is in effect a national sales tax, to be collected at every level of production right up to ultimate consumption. VAT has two advantages. Its incidence is largely disguised from eonsumers, who will ultimately pay most of it. VAT will be hidden irt the posted price of an item, rather than added on. It can also raise an ·incredible amount of money. Every 1% in the VAT rate would result in about $6 billion in tax collections being raised. Even in today's slowed economy; a 4% Y AT 'would raise nearly $25 billion. VAT would be strongly regressive. The potential for giving 'special' hidden rebates to corporations and special interest groups would be enormous. For raising revenue or for promoting equity, tax reform is a far supenor alternative to the VAT. Thomas Kershner is an instructor in Economics at Union answers within ourselves rather than in others. And yes, I know that that is an easy-to-say generalized proposition. That's why I don't want to talk about it. l?articularly since I'm not very good at it myself. I would like to discuss the change, the incredible change that occurs, at least within me (do you feel it too?), from winter to spling here; how the sunshine has the uncanny ability to make me smile; how just to be able to walk around without a jacket sets me free in a special way; to see the barren forms of the tallest trees against the dark, dark night sky lit only by the fleeting figure of Orion (faithful friend) and the rise of the Dipper, and the Summer triangle staring me in the face; the smell of the earth, the green (well, not always green) of the grass, the company of some much-loved, dear friends; and how much I want my love with me and how much I want her to be free and how I want to be free and how I want us to be free together (is it unfair'?). Spring is a renewal and a beginning sometimes, in some ways. It's hard to discuss. I could talk about music, about the Beatles (academic question) but they talk well enough for themselves, or used to. And what about the New Beats, Johnny Mathis (do you remember Chances Are or Wonderful! Wonderfu I!?), Wayne Newton. And what about Rocky and Bullwinkle? (But that trick NEVER works! This time for sure! PRESTO! (No doubt about it, I gotta get another hat)). And what about it? Perhaps it's time for a few baritone solos in the key of E. Which brings me to what I want least to talk about: dogs on campus, and space and athletics and love and change. • And though I sit here typing these last lines, I wonder if I have typed any at all. How hard it is to realize that I have mentioned only a few of the things on the mind, things I don't want to discuss anyway, things that most everyone already knows, things that I have presented so poorly with too few Words to represent them and no clearness of mind to understand them. (And so much more unsaid, though felt.) I remember Ed Sullivan's last words on the air after his 25th year on his weekly show that had just been cancelled. Appropriate parting words. I remember him staring at the camera, his shoulders in the usual haunch, his hands as aimless as always; only this time with the slightest of tears in the corner of his eye. I remember him look to the left, then to the right, them forward and then speak 7 last words to close a quarter century of history. As the tear rolled down his cheek, he said, \Are we on? ... Are the microphones on?\ \Topo Gigio\ is the likely nom de plume of Coach Art Lawrence's favorite mustachioed third baseman, Bob Bernhardt, '72, whose' affection for Ed Sullivan is well-documented.

' I 4 CONCORDIENSIS, Tuesday. April 18,.1972 Cosmie,Cowhoys, ByTOM HUDAK The social committee took a big step forward by staging the New Riders of the Purple Sage concert in Schenectady's Proctors Theater last Saturday night, or was it a step backward? The feeling of togetherness always generated in Memorial Chapel was drowned in the huge crowd at Proctors, composed largely of teeny-bopper freaks who were more coneerned with eating popcorn than listening to music. Fortunately, what was lost in ·togetherness was gained in acoustics. The warm-up group. Tranquility, showed potential but the audience didn't care to hear it, The first song \Time and Space\ got most people's attention with good harmony and easily followed melody, but that attention was soon lost in song~ with trite lyrics reminiscent of '65 Beatles songs. I could have sworn many of the melodies were written by Graham Nash, but it wasn't enough to pull them through.· I was ready to write Tranquility off to a career of mediocrity on American AM radio when they broke into their second to last song, \Saying Good-bye,\ which contained the best instrumental jatn of the night. The precision was superb and the volume shook the old chandeliers of Proctors. Everyone suddenly woke up and realized that they weren't watching the cartoons before the main feature, but that there were some musicians on stage. The last number \Where I Belong\ contained lyrics that expressed emotion rather than '/he Eaty The Proverbial Tubesteak By MARTIN T. MICHAELSON \Every dog is entitled to one bite\- Anonymous Besides giving us a massive case of acid indigestion, our travels across the face of the globe in search of the supreme gastronomic experience have made one fact clearly apparent: we have discovered that the true culinary capitals of the world have almost without variance built their reputations on a single dish. Peking for instance has its famous duck, Paris its incomparable crepes suzette, and Tijuana its tacos (water please!). Even Schenectady, though not widely regarded as one of the foremost dining centers of the world, has a specialty all its own with which no known imitation can compete. At this point it has probably become apparent to many of you that we are referring to the infamous chili dog. A good many of you may have already tried these remarkable taste delights and an equal number have probably suffered many an agonizing hour of indigestion and/ or halitosis as a direct result of your consumption. Chili dog eating is, in fact, somewhat of a classic pastime here at dear old Union. This is especially true among the fraternity-bred upperclassmen who, not so coincidentally, also consume Rolaids at an equally greater rate than their underclass counterparts. The Big Three Although there is a rather extensive list of establishments of varying cuisine that specialize in these proverbial chili dogs, there are perhaps only three, who, because of their high quality ingredients, raunchy homelike atmosphere, and above all dirt cheap prices, ar-e worthy of mention in this column. There are the real biggies, the Rolls- Royces of the chili dog world. In \I don't believe I ate the whole thing!\ their awesome presence all others seem scrawny and stale. Topping the list is the one and only Newest Lunch on Albany St. Not far behind however are Mike's and Cavalier's, both on Erie Blvd. and in the view of some every bit as good as Newest. While most chili dogs are similar there are differences between them which are strong enough to dictate a preference for one particular variety. Before exploring these differences, let's first examine the \typical\ dog .. The standard equipment for any dog that makes a pretense of beil}.g a genuine one is a Freihofer's roll (anybody who makes chocolate chip cookies that good has to make a great roll) and a Tobin's First Prize, not necessarily all meat, hot dog. This of course is garnished with chopped onions, mustard, and great globs of chili sauce. The Sauce is Boss From our perspective, it's the sauce that makes the difference. Newest, for instance, specializes in a sauce that uses only the finest quality drippings from their hamburg grill. There are many who have a weakness for the delicate grease flavor found in these dogs. Of all the other dog establishments, Mike's provides . probably the greatest contrast to Newest, Mike's sauce is decidedly more spicy. As is the case with the chefs of outstanding restaurants, the chef at Mike's refuses to divulge his recipe and we can, therefore, only assume that he is using the same type of quality ingredients that are found at Newest. The best way to describe the sauce at Cavalier's is to say that it falls somewhere between Mike's and Newest in terms of hotness. This would seem ideally suited to the middle of the road dog eater unable to make a firm commitment on his choice in sauces.

Jaszczak Set For Super Season by MARK MINDEL The track meet Saturd'ay against Wesleyan was cancelled because the track was a \quagmire'' according to Coach Michelsen and star performer Rick Jaszczak. Michelsen expects Jaszczak to put it all together this spring ·in this .his last competitive spring season as a Union College runner. Jaszczak, who will be at college next year in his fifth year as ail intet:departmental major, should compete in foot~all in the fall where he has one more year of eligibility, and run mdoor and outdoor track as an independent, not affiliated with the school. · . Michelsen, still looking for his debut as outdoor track coach, is very optimistic about the chances for the team this year. He plans to use Jaszczak in the 440, his specialty, along with the anchor spot in the mile and 440 relays, and possibly a few 220's or 880's to keep ·the musclebound sprinter razor-sharp. But there's plenty more to this year's squad than Rick. As Michelsen admits, \not only are we strong in almost every event, we're almost 'too deep'.\ Perhaps the strongest point on the team will not be Jas~czak and his middle-distance team, but the sprint unit, and if this is the case, watch out. Heading the 'sprint~quinf are Skip Jamieson, Tracey Rich, Mark Chittim, Dave White, and the probabl~ anchor man of the sprint relay, if Jaszczak is not used, Jerry Cuffey. Cuffey offers a unique case. Last season he was touted as the premier sprinter along with ace Bruce Mathias. Then he threw a curve and went out for baseball. Jerry surprised everyone by batting .357, ftfth on the squad, and belting one of the seven circuit clouts for Coach Lawrence's squad. Jerry continued to show versatility this fall by starring as the split-end, wide receiver for the team, and then this sprin~, he was not only unexpectedly, but astonishingly, cut from the baseball squad. And now it's track again for the never-say-die athlete. Competing with the sprinters for top unit on the deep squad will of course be the middle-distance and the distance crew. Where the sprinters ha:ve five men hovering slightly below 10 flat, but not anyone challenging the recdrd books, the distance boys have the guns to shatter several marks. Besides nationally-advertised Jaszczak, there's gutty little Tim McCabe. McCabe holds the 880 mark for Union, 1:52.6, although more a sprinter than a marathoner, he led the cross-country team for the past two seasons.

But it could have been worse. They lost last year by a 7-2 score to the same squad, so there has been some improvement. Coach Walter's was visibly upset with his team's showing during the match. In an interview with him yesterday, he said that the team \hadn't reached its competitive edge yet.\ Co-captain Jim Skiff expressed almost the same feelings as his coach. \I think we could have beaten Hobart. If we had {Jetter weather and. more practice time or if we could have faced them later in the season, we could .have done the job. Coach is right about us· not having gained our competitive edge yet\. The squad, greatly missing the services of Ernie Guillet, last year's #3 man who apparently has c;iecided to sit out the season, was clobbered 5-1 in the singles matches but came back with a 2- 1 edge in the doubles play. Stu Fishier, who was #2 man for the team on Friday, was the only singles victor for U Coil, knocking off his opponent in 3 sets. #I Marty Cukierman went down to defeat, 2-6, 6-3, 0-6. Kevin Crawford (#3) and Steve Wayne {#6) lost three-set matches while Freddy Kaplan (#4) and Skiff (#5) lost 3-6, 2-6 and 4-6, 5- 7 respeCtively. Fishier and Cukierman led the doubles charge with straight set victories while Kaplan and Crawford teamed for a three-set win to give our netters their third and last point. Walters was especially pleased with the play of Fred Kaplan who has returned to top form after a one year layoff. But he said his hopes for an undefeated season were now down the drain and that it was up to him to try to get his squad to play them one at a time. ~·we hope to rebound (what sport is he coaching) from our Hobart match when we face the ever tough Panthers of Middlebury at their indoor facility\ chirped the second yeat tennis mentor.

The event which drew a record number of entrants, reported to be 1220 strong, included for the first time nine \official\ girl entries. As you remember in the past girls would sneak into the lineup. With the results just in, Seamus Johnson turned in the best performance for the U Col contingent. Johnson toured the 26 mile 385 yard event which began at Hopkinton High School in under three hours (2 hours 55 minutes) to finish 220th out of 1090 finishers. Moeckel was next, limping in with a bruised ankle and pulled thigh. but very pleased with his 3 hour even and 300th position finish. Right behind Bryant. came Nina Kuscik, the first girl to finish.

Michelsen expects Jaszczak to put it all together this spring in this his last competitive spring season as a Union College runner. Jaszczak, who will be at college next year in his fifth year as an interdepartmental major, should compete in football in the fall where he has one more year of eligibility, and run indoor and outdoor track as an independent, not affiliated with the school. Michelsen, still looking for his debut as outdoor track coach, is very optimistic about the chances for the team this year. He plans to use Jaszczak in the 440, his specialty, along with the anchor spot in the mile and 440 relays, and possibly a few 220's or 880's to keep the musclebound sprinter razor-sharp. But there's plenty more to this year's squad than Rick. As Michelsen admits, \not only are we strong in almost every event, we're almost 'too deep'.\ Perhaps the strongest point on the team will not be Jaszczak and his middle-distance team, but the sprint unit, and if this is the case, watch out. Heading the 'sprint-quint' are Skip Jamieson, Tracey Rich, Mark Chittim, Dave White, and the probabl~ anchor man of the sprint relay, if Jaszczak is not used, Jerry Cuffey. Cuffey offers a unique case. Last season he was touted as the premier sprinter along with ace Bruce Mathias. Then he threw a curve and went out for baseball. Jerry surprised everyone by batting .357, fifth on the squad, and belting one of the seven circuit clouts for Coach Lawrence's squad. Jerry continued to show versatility this fall by starring as the split-end, wide receiver for the team, and then this spring, he was not only unexpectedly, but astonishingly, cut from the baseball squad. And now it's track again for the never-say-die athlete. Competing with the sprinters for top unit on the deep squad will of course be the middle-distance and the distance crew. Where the sprinters have five men hovering slightly below 10 flat, but not anyone challenging the record books, the distance boys have the guns to shatter several marks. Besides nationally-advertised Jaszczak, there's gutty little Tirn McCabe. McCabe holds the 880 mark for Union, 1:52.6, although more a sprinter than a marathoner, he led the cross-country tearn for the past two seasons. This winter he took a respite from the U Col scene, running and teaching, as part of an independent study project, down south. The returning prodigal will be the second man in the mile relay along with running the 440, 880, and the mile. Backing up these two is Greg Hamlin, back from a winter term trip to Israel, who will compete in the mile and half-mile primarily. King of the distance crew is freshman phenom Jim Johnson.

In the sprir~;g opener for both teams, Colgate's rugby club soundly trounced Union's ruggets. on Saturday in Hamilton, N.Y., 24-0. The Red Raiders were in complete command throughout the contest, jumping off to an 18- 0 halftime lead on the strength of excellent pursuit and a fierce tackling game. The Raiders were big, mobile, and they tackled ferqCiousiy. Union was on the defensive throughout the match, thanks to the ha.rd-hit:ting coverage by the Colgate sctummers and linemen. Union's attackers, John Walker, Howie Goldberg, Brad Hastings, and Dave Benko, were well contained by the dogged Colgate pursuit. On the other hand, the Garnet's sloppy tackling and· comparatively poor pursuit led to three of the five Colgate tries. The fact that Dutchmen were also missing three of their best players, scrummers Gary Lynch and Pat Wardell, and wingman Paul Martini, did not help matters either. Play in the serums and lineouts . was surprisingly even throughout most of the contest, thanks to a gritty performance by the outmanned Union forwards. The Raider scrummers enjoyed a weight advantage of about twenty pounds per man, but on only one occasion were they able to totally overpower the Dutchmen. Midway through the first half, with Colgate on top 10-0, , co- captain Goldberg fielded a loose baH near the Union goal-and was immediately smothered by a swarm. of Colgate tacklers. In the resulting five yard serum, Union's forwards were unceremoniously pushed into the end zone, and the Raiders fell on the ball for the try. After Colgate's first half outburst, the Garnet defense stiffened thanks to some harder hitting by the Dutchmen. The Raiders were unable to mount an effective attack during the second stapza, except for one or two cracks at the Union goal, until a Colgate lineman broke loose on a long run down the sideline in the final seconds of the gatlle. The resulting try and conversion made the final score 24-0. The ruggers ·are idle next weekend, but return to action the following week at home.

One of these was the awesome debut of the Independent contingent, which manhandled Sigma Phi by a score of 19-2.

This is a very important meeting and all members and interested students are urged to attend. One of the primary purposes of this meeting will be to elect two new co-chairmen since the present co- chairmen will not be able to serve next year. Also, since Prof. Larry Weitz, faculty advisor to the program, will not be available next year, a new faculty advisor must be designated. The Big Brother and Big Sister Prugram has been active this year and has sponsored movies and picnics. Membership in the program has also increased considerably with many students showing interest in the program and many students participating actively. However, with a greater influx of little brothers and si:.ters on campus, several problems have arisen because some kids. claiming to be little brothers and sisters have been running around unattended at the gym, the field house and in dorms, causing trouble. Although an attempt has been made to control this situation by, handling out ID cards to little brothers and sisters, many of . little hrothers and sisters lose the cards, For spring term, the Big Brother and Big Sister Program is currently planning a picnic at Girling Center on Saturday, April 29.

The rest of the workshop sessions were concerned mainly with finding ways to change the structures and institutions at Union that reinforce \the passive racism\ that Union is accused of. Any attempt to significantly alter the racial situation at Union, it was explained, would have to be directed at the sources of power, the channels of access to resources, and the establishment of standards. In the fi-nal session of the workshop, the partiCipants proposed specific methods of changing all relevant aspects of Union College life so that power, access to resources, and standards would be more in conformity with the ideal non- racist institution. Secondly, efforts should be made to contact graduate schools and professional associations in order to recruit more black faculty members. Thirdly, tentative plans were discussed to inform alumni and Trustees of the purpose and activities of the workshop. The necessity of curriculum changes that would retlect black contributions to many disciplines was also discussed. Th.ere were occa s io na I disagreements throughout the course of the two-day, twc. •• e hour workshop. The personal motivations of the participants were questioned, as were the proper steps to be taken to correct racism in any institution.

But at the end of the second set everyone was still awake, anticipating and waiting for \The Legend of the USS Titanic,\ Brockett's famous talking blues song. At the conclusion of the second set, which was accorded a much warranted standing ovation, Jamie obliged and did the \Titanic which was received with a wild jumping ovation. That is, at the conclusion of the fifteen minutes of the \Titanic including a totally ad-libbed verse when he dropped his pick, the built up exhilaration, appreciation, exhuberation, and joy made everyone not just stand up, but jump into the air from their seats as Bro.ckett, exhausted, walked off the stage. There's not much one can say about something too good for words. Perhaps it was because the atmosphere was conducive to Jaime Brockett's style, or Jaime Brockett was conducive to everyone's feelings, or a little of both, but for those of you who missed it last Saturday night, you missed one of those beautiful, spontaneous things which only happen every so often. I hope it happens again soon, so those of you who missed it can experience it also. Senate Mee~ing Continued from Page 1 rewording and will be considered at the next meeting. None of the courses approved by the Curricular Affairs Committee were challenged, and the Senate turned to discussion of the pass-fail option. Two recommendations of the CAC were considered separately. The first required a student to obtain permission to take a course from his own Division on a pass-fail basis, and the second, to obtain his advisor's permission to take any course pass-fail. The first was soundly defeated on the grounds that Division lines are not accurate measures of the venturesome nature of the studenfs choice of courses. The second proposal was modified to insure that a student discuss alternatives with his adviser when considering the pass-fail option, and a means of distributing information about consequences of such a decision was devised. The proposal concerning transdisciplinary studies programs (including an Urban Studies program, which was cited as an example of such a curriculum) were passed by a large majority of the Senate.

Thl' first required a student to obtain permission to take a course from his own Division on a pa~s-fail basis, and the second, to obtain his advisor's permission to Ia h any course pass-fail. The first was soundly defeated on the grounds that Division lines are not accurate measun:1 of the venturesome nature of the student's choice of courses.

The main thrl!st of the editorial was that Film Haps, because they charge one dollar admission, is· responsible for providing a decent screening of each film. However, as the following article will point out, the blame for the -problems that all-too-often accompany films shown in SS 016 does not rest exclusively on Film Haps' shoulders. Film Haps makes at least :biUuu to $1500 per year although it varies. Responsibility Film Haps procedure in the past several years has been something like this: the members would select a film which they would order from a film distributor. They would then hire a student projectionist, advertise the film, and then show it in SS 016, charging up to one dollar admission.

Calabria, who is a Professor of Psychology, began by telling those present that \You are professors'and you are scholars,\ meaning that the roles of teacher and student are largely interchangeable and com- plimentary. He spoke of the \basic need'' for human bemgs to create something which helps to make us \more alive.\ Calabria related this belief to the topic in stating that \Teaching enables me to learn.'' The professor discussed his personal research in two fields:. psychology in literature and psycho-history. Speaking of his current research involving dance marathons dur~ng the 1930's, Continued on Page 3 In American society~ \Blacks are not the problem,\ according to Dr. C. Eric Lincoln . in a speech delivered Wednesday night in Social Sciences 016. Speaking before a large audience, Dr. Lincoln stated that fot most White Americans, '\Black Americans do not exist as people - only as a collective situation - only as a problem.\ In Dr. Lincoln's view, Black Americans do have problems, problems of identity stemming from a history of having been arbitrarily excluded from the American mainstream. Dr. Lincoln, Professor of Sociology .an.d Religion at Union Theological Seminary and Adjunct Professor of Religion at Columbia University, expressed the idea that for first._ time since being stolen from Africa, Blacks in America are developing a new awareness, sensitivity and pride about being Black. This new pride stems from a new acceptance of self among Blacks. Dr. Lincoln stated that he felt Blacks were achieving a new self appraisal of worth because they have rejected the labels and models ·presented to them by White America. Central to the new Black self- image is, in Dr. Lincoln's view, the concept of soul. The noted author stated that \soul is the . reaffirmation of the Black man's most pos1t1ve estimate of himself;\ it is an important link among Blacks which helps support individuals with a sense DR. C. ERIC LINCOLN photlJ hy SteW! f:nll' of common \kinship empathy, and understanding.\ Dr. Lincoln pointed to the new emphasis by Blacks on their own history and culture as good \signs of mental health that the Black ego is still alive\ despite the centuries of White efforts to destroy Black self-pride. During a period of audience questions, the issue of admittance of Blacks to Union and other colleges came up. An uni den tifi ed questioner, presutnably a professor, stated that college instructors are faced with a serious problem because Blacks are admitted to college with lower qualifications than Whites. Dr. Lincoln responded by stating that it was natural that many Blacks would come to college with lower proficiencies because they come from inferior public schools which implicitly discriminate against Blacks. Dr. Lincoln continued to say that Union and other colleges had to accept Blacks and begin to ••accept responsibility for undoing what's been done'' in a racist society. He concluded by expressing the position that Union and other coljeges could n~ longer continue to operate in \splendid isolation\ from society's needs turning out \splendidly isolated White Americans.'' At the same time, other groups were also using the equipment and facilities in SS 016. Film Series, films for courses, and the Bergman film series are some of the other groups recently using SS 016. When equipment was either damaged. poorly maintained, or broken due to inept projectionists, ·Film Haps generally took care of repairs. Says Mark Urman: \Previously Film Haps was responsible. We paid for repairs ourselves, or we paid the school for repairs ... when anything went wrong with the projectors, we put them in our car:s and quted them off to have them repaired.\ Dean Charles Olton, in a memo concerning the use of SS 016 facilities, touched upon the subject of Film Haps responsibility when he stated, in reference to future policy: \Film Haps uses the equipment much more than all the other users combined, and therefore ought to bear a substantial share of the liability.\ Film Haps does use the facilities more than the other groups, about 270 screenings. per year as opposed to approximately I 00 screenings for the other campus groups. All varieties of people served as projectionists for the films shown in SS 016. As a result of either \inept or uninformed use\ of the equipment, things were hroken or were allowed to fall into a· state of disrepair. In reference to the probkm of broken equipment in the projection room, Jane Aibel said, \We would go up there and find that mayhe a projector was hroken: nobody would tell us .... \ The poor screening that naturally would re,ult from broken equipment was unavoidabk under the old system in which no single person was responsible for the use and maintenance of the projection facilities. Film Haps. Mark Urman pointed out, \would make an attempt to correct what was wrong.\ Another factor that accounts for some of the poor screening~ should be mentioned at this point. Sometimes, as in the case of \Performance\ this term, him Haps would receive a damaged print or an inadequate film from the film distributor. The resultant poor screening is unavoidable, and, as Urman asserts, it is not the fault of Film Haps: 'There will always be the problem of get-ting a damaged print, which is a universal problem so it must be discounted.\ Continued on Page 3

Whnt''s Happen.ing? Important issues occasionally become obscured when a reader has to pick his or her way through a long gray mass of newspaper print. In the I.T.T. case, for example, after months of testimony the real issues have been overshaowed by tangential disputes such as whether or not Dita Beard is really sick. With respect to Film Haps, there are several issues and unanswered questions that need to be kept in mind: .. Although we acknowledge the fact that they now pay a fee for the use of SS 016, Film Haps stilJ uses College facilities and publicity outlets for the personal profit of a select few members. Jane Aibel said she became a member of Film Haps through \a friend~' If a few people are going to use the college to make a profit, perhaps there should be a more o.pen method of determining who_ becpmes a member of Film Haps. ' \ , The respoJi}sibility for the technical quality of films shown in SS. 016 is . essentially in the hands of Joe Schwartz and Dean Olton. If for various reasons discussed in the article, poor screenings continue this spring, are patrons of the films supposed to pay their dollar and patiently endure perhaps until \a year or a year and a half' from now when Dean Olton estimates there will be enough money to. buy professional equipment? . It would be unfair and it is .not our intention to blame Film Haps for all the problems connected with SS 016. We believe that the persons connected with Film Haps sincerely want to provide decent screenings of the films. We also believe that this goal is not unreachable. The people who are responsible must realize their obligation to provide the service that they are being paid for;. • FoUl'lTAIN oFYoU1+!

Letters - Schwartz In Election time is here again and I would like to anno·unce my\ candidacy for the\ Divisionii All College Senate Student Seat. I feel that the Senate must take an active, vigorous role in decision-making. Only in this manner can students and faculty enjoy the new privileges bestowed upon them. The way must be c1eared to change the Senate's current self-made role of constantly debating procedures and organization to that of the policy-making governing body it was meant to be. Not only must the representatives to the Senate have a sincere desire to do the job and have a knowledge of the .organization of the Senate, they must also be in constant touch with their constituencies so that their votes· show student opinion and not merely their own opinion. I will be having a meeting of all Division II students before each Senate meeting just for that purpose. And, at these meetings, 1 hope to make students more aware of what the Senate is doing. Every means open for pcomoting a more meaningful dialogue between the elected representatives and the people they represent must be made. Some specific things that 1 believe that should be done are the passing of a resolution by the Senate denouncing the 60% tenure limit, the offering of courses on a credit, no-credit basis, and the reporting to the Board of Trustees all Senate votes on those subjects not under · its authority as a means for the Trustees to gauge College sentiment on important issues. Anyone interested in talking more to me can stop by at 352 Fox or call me at 370- 0663, Sincerely, Joseph Schwartz '73 Mi-ller Too. I'm writing to announce my candida,cy for the position of Junior Member of the Board of Trustees and to explain my · · position on a number of is,sues. · 1 c_ompletely sapport the purpose and substance of the petition to repeal the 60% tenure limit. The rule is terribiy arbitrary and detrimental to the interests of all U. Coll. stUdents. It should be r;epealed imme<i~ately and replaced · by a self- regulating set of ·guidelines from the Salaries, Promotion and Tenure Cotrunittee. AU Board of Trustee meeting agendas shQuld be ·made public BEFORE the meeting actually takes place. this seems like a very simple, sensible suggestion which would enable all students to be informed of upcoming and soon-to-be- decided issues. It would make more sense to solicit student opinion before ~aking a decision which affects them. lF THE Administration refused to send a copy of the agenda to Concordy, I would publish my copy of the agenda irt the Letters to the Editor column. The B-oard of Trustees agenda has been priv.jleged information too long .. The trustees should be . present on campus to discuss college policy more often. Hopefully, a little more direct contact .and discussion mig)lt begiJ:J. to close the gap between what the trustees do and what the students think, There are other issues of concern which I will happily discuss with any student, living unit, or fraternity. Unfortunately, 1 don't have the space to discuss them here. Please contact me if you're interested in talking more about the future of Union College.

Page4 by ALISON SLOAT This Wednesday marked the delayed opening of th·e Dutchmen's outdoor track season. Union's thinclads travelled to Hartford to defeat Trinity 82-72. Tri-captains Rich Jaszczak, Tim McCabe, and Mike Rich led the way, bringing Coach Michelsen victory in his first outdoor track appearance. Nine firsts went to each team, Union winning on superior depth. Mike Rich. and his high jumping crew stole the ·show as they swept the final event. Rich won at 6'4\ on misses, l.>ettering co teammates Stan Jackson and Mmm Wilber, who soared to personal bests of 6'4\ and 6'2\ respectively. John DeStefano was right behind the leaders with a 6'0\ leap. Overall Rich brought home 13 points, winning the javelin with a ' toss of 177' 3%\ only 9 feet short of · the school record, and grabbing second in th·e high hurdles. \Chunky\ Rick Jaszczak took top honors with a time of 50.2 in the 440 yd. dash, closely followed by Dave White at 60.9. Jaszczak and White teamed with Dave Mitchell's Heroics Down Albany State by BILL KILLEN Bob Mitchell seems to have a habit for opening day heroics. Who can forget his performance at the football home opener in the fall when he came on for injured quarterback Dave Rearic and led the team to victory over St. Lawrence? This time Mitch's eighth inning 3 run homer provided the winning margin in the baseball team's 8~5 season opener victory at Albany State on Tuesday. Mitchell's blast drove in Bob Bernhardt and Gene Quirk ahead of him who each got on with RBI singles tying the game at 5-5. It gave the victory to frosh Joe Urschel who had come on in relief in the 7th inning. lhe sidearming Mitchell, whose delivery is very similar to that of National League relief ace Joe Hoerner, had started the game and pitched stongly until the middle innings when he was jolted for 5 runs. But his home run blast gave Union its eighth consecutive win over the Great Danes since the series began. . Urschellmpressive The teams performance was a heartening one and pleased Coach Art Lawrence who felt they \played very well for the first game of the year.\ Lawrence was unhappy however over the continuing bad weather which postponed yesterday's second attempted home opener against ·Siena and which was threatening today's game against Rochester. With up to 4 games postponed and stacked up Iater in the season, pitching depth becomes more crucial to the teams success. Urschel's fine perfor-mance gave him the starting nod for today's R()chester game if played. Frosh· Jon Gould looks strong and Steve Stockman. who is working on control, could be keys in later games. Coach l.awrence's batting order at Albany found Bernhardt leading off with Quirk in the seconcf spot. This may have surprised some .who expected Gino to be tlie leadoff mim. Lawrence explained that with Bernhardt's ability to get on. Quirk is even more of a threat with his ability to bunt to move up a runner and beat it out for a hase hit himself. Furthermore this gives an alternating right-left-right hitting combination for the first three batters rather than 1-r-r setup. As an added note, Gino would be less likely to hit into a double play, and if Bernhardt is on first with the first baseman holding him on. this gives Gino a bigger opening to hit thru on the left side. * SES810NS: .June 5th June 26th July 3nl July lOth July 24·th Social SdemT Fin1• Arts Radio-TV Urnma \atuml Sdence J<ihn llum :w i 1 it•;.

Jim and Jim ran 10: 15.9 to outclass the rest of the · fipJrf by JOEL ROSLYN What started out as a .warin, $Unny aftetnoon for the Garnet LaXmen, ended up as a cloudy, dismal day. A large partisan croWd lined Daley Field with the hope of witnessing the extension of the Laco's winning ways .. Unfortunately, the Great Cosmos did not have this in mind, as the Dutchmen fell to Wesleyan, a team which should have been beaten, 13-8. Several things can be salvaged from this disappointing loss. Barry Gross and Mark Sanderson seem to have re- discovered the ability to score, something which proved elusive last year. Sandy continued to set up and control the Garnet offense, assisting on three goals. The day, however, belonged to the senior from Woodbri9ge, New Jersey, as Barry scored 5 goals (bringing his two game total to 8). Wesleyan Grabs Lead Union, led 4-3 at the end of the first quarter. Jim Akin, the burly · Wesleyan hoopster accounted for two goals in this period, but he left the field with some bruises. Tom Reif, Ed Young, and \Moishe\ Peng, the Garnet defensemen did a fine job of keeping Akin in check the whole afternoon. The defense, however, made a critical error as the gun sounded to close the first half leading to the seventh Wesleyan. goal, a very crucial one. In the third period, Wesleyan Jumped off to a l0-5 lead, but then Bany went t<r work, scoring 3 goals in less than 3 minutes. The fans and the team seemed to come to life, but the tide changed as the Cardinals scored after a scramble in front .of the Garnet cage~ making it 11-8. This was the crushing blow and the Dutchmen were not heard from the rest ofthe day. Rein ••Kraut\ Eichinger seemed to be dodging grenades as he raced down the field and then ·flipped a perfect pass to Barry Gross for the third Garnet goal of the afternoon. In order for the Garnet to have a successful year, the Middies must start to contribute offensively. To date, the. three lines ·have accounted for 7 points, they've got to produce more. For those loyal lacrosse fans and those who ate curious to see how the \civilized'' men of Hanover live, why not make the trip up to Dartmouth Saturday afternoon? After a pre-season scrimmage against the Indians, the feeling is that they can be . heat~n.

One such alternative is the faculty self-regulation proposal, and Pach fears that another one may consist of the trustees deciding the number of tenured positions for each specific department. by GEORGE BAIN The Board of Trustees is leaning towards elimination of the 60 percent limit on tenure ,jf the Ad Hoc Committee of Trustees, Faculty, ami students can come up with a suitable, alternative plan . . That is the conclusion of Peter Pach, Junior Class Representative to the Board of Trustees, wh() attended last Friday's special meeting of the Trustees. Although the Board also dealt with other parochial matters, Pach feels that its discussion of the tenure issue would be of most interest to the students.

This dispute . is students as well as administrators efficiency. Instead,. I want to Vice Vice-President (vote for one): What should be the function of the Student Senate? Donald E. Foley, '73 (Economics): Due to the inconveniences of student life, not all students have been able to actively participate in the governance of the college. Instead, the Student Senate, in its claim to represent student interests, has been empowered to act on aH matters that would affect student life at Union College, and, subsequently, has developed into the f(v)ocal point for student sentiment. But mere consideration of student opinion may not be enough. The Senate finds itself on the periphery of the college's legislative process, a position where it can only react to the policies of the school. Part of the difficulty may be a result of the Senate's own actions. The Senate has repeatedly concerned itself with academic matters, possibly at the expense of pressing student problems. Housing, food service, sports facilities, cultural affairs, the sociiil life, and such matters are all questions that beg for attention. The Senate may find it more fruitful to address itself to these \trivial\ matters. The Senate shc:mld opt, as well, for stricter control (to the extent of the exercise of the recall power) among those students that represent it and the student body at-large on administration, faculty, and student committees. A better system of checking the· performance of student members on committees could be very informative as to what is actually happening in administrative matters. It is my belief that the Senate can play a more active role in legislation and policy formulation, providing. the student body with a greater role in the decisions of the college. The Senate should be a forum from which the student voice is not only heard, but enacted upon by the administration. Nick Karambelas, '75 (English): The Student Senate should serve as a coordinating body of all student opinion. It should be a place where any and all student opinions can be expressed. Also, the Senate should be able to pass these opmwns on to the college administration. This puts the Senate in the position of a liaison and therefore, the Senate must know as much about student opinion as possible. It has be~n argued in the past that, in reality, the Student Senate has no power. The real source ot power m we ~enate IS tnat lt IS an ettective pressure group because it is, or sh()tild be, the coordinating body of student opinion. With greater interest and participation, the Senate would have \to be reckoaed with by other governing bodies on campus. However, as with any organi~ation, it is the people involved who make it go and tir~ peo pie in the Senate will ultimately determine how influential and involved the Senate will be. It is not enough to brood over the failure of a Sen:ate and complain that student apathy made it fail. Tom Burbank, '75 (Pol. Scie11ce): Since the peak of sentiment against the Indochinese war in the late 1960's and early 1970's, and since the Kent State incident in 1970, college campuses across the nation have become \hotbeds of political apathy.\ At Union, the fault lies either partially or totally with the organization of the Student Senate. The Senate has failed in its efforts to solve the problems of today's Union student, simply because many of its ruembers are chosen without consideration as to their ability and willingness to do the jo.b properly. How can a governmental body be ex,pected to function to the best of its ability when a great many of. its members not only are unwilling or unable to carry out · their duties, but fail to even attend its meetings? Obviously, the answer is, it can't. So, what should be the function of our Student Senate? Before one . can answer that question, it is imperative to answer the question I have posed above: how to make the Senate more responsive to the student body. I believe that the report of the Sherman Committee, which investigated the weaknesses of the present student government and recommended a drastic change in its format, should be formally adopted, providing Union with a more workable form of representative government. To quote the report, I believe that the Senate must \effectively serve its membership\ it \must be efficient so as to adequately serve those it represents, yet it must also be flexible enough to protect each mrfacing minority. It must be sufficiently strong to solicit the attention and respect of those with whom it must necessarily interat:t, yet it must also be · susceptible to the changing needs and desires of the electorate.\ Concordiensis is published every Tuesday and Friday during the college year, except during examination and vacation periods, by the student body of Union College.

I feel that if a student senator misses two consecutive meetings he should be replaced, and if a committee does not to plan their education. Students need better social facilities. This includes a student center as well as improved athletic facilities. A student center will provide a sodal life for students on campus. Better athletic facilities are also needed to raise the level of student life. The fieldhouse is an area of major need. If this facility is improved it will provide recreational space, athletic space and a place for College-spon.sored concerts, dances and parties. Housing is increasingly being distributed unfairly between the two sexes now attending Uhion. An equitable formula must be found. In response to the questions concerning apathy I can say that it does extend into student government. I can quote a trustee, Mr. Greenough, as saying that while at Union he The Electorqte incredulity that today's college youth are capable of any responsibility whatsoever. In fact, dogs on campus have risen to one of Union's primary issues while \little\ things like the exploitation of Union College students reqiain i•n the background. After all, who cares if we, the students who pay over $4000 a year ·to come to this great institution, have to pay exorbitant prices for books at the bookstore, supposedly run for our benefit. And who cares if we, the students, have to pay prices at our own Rathskellar which would lead us to believe that we are dining on some of the finest culinary_ delights that Modern America has to offer. And who cares that if we, the students, decide to carry only two courses for a term (regardless of the reason), have to set up field For Secretary.

It's purpose is the identification and promotion of those needs and aims and it should continu'llly investigate new means thro'1[h which it may carry out itS' st 1ted purpose.

Students need better social facilities. This includes a student center as well as improved athletic facilities. A student center will provide a soctal life for students on campus. Better athletic facilities are also needed to raise the level of student life. The fieldhouse is an area of major need. If this facility is improved it will provide recreational space, athletic space and a place for College-sponsored concerts, dances and parties. Housing is increasingly being distributed unfairly between the two sexes now attending Uhion. An equitable formula must be found. In response to the questions concerning apathy I can say that it does extend into student government. I can quote a trustee. Mr. Greenough. as saying that while at Union he government cares about them. To this I say grumble, grumble, grumble. These questions, just like student go\crnment ~t l 1 nion College as it stands now, mean absolutely nothing. They are, as is the student government, another feeble attempt at a democratic situation at Union College. The fate of Union College has and will rest in the hands of those certain godlike individuals who, from the world of Business, Finance, and the National Review, have appeared to possess feelings of mistrust for, and an The Electorate incredulity that today's college youth are capable of any responsibility whatsoever. In fact, dogs on campus have risen to one of Union's primary issues while \little\ things like the exploitation of Union College students remain in the background. After alL who cares if we, the students who pay over $4000 a year to come to this great institution, have to pay exorbitant prices for books at the bookstore, supposedly run for our benefit. And who cares if we, the students, have to pay prices at our own Rathskcllar which would lead us to believe that we are dining on some of the finest culinary delights that Modern America has to offer.

Bucky Rulon-Miller, '74 (Economics): In response to a challenge of improving communication between the students of Union College and the Board of Trustees, there are two accessible and acceptable courses of action open. They are 1) direct dialogue between students and the trustees, such as that which occurred Friday, 21 April, and, 2) the best possible expression of student opm10n through representation, whether this be through class representatives or Student Senate resolution. ' At presept both avenues are being pursued to a limited extent, but not, obviously to their full potential. To this end, therefore, I would direct rrtost effort, that is,. improving existing channels of communication. I would ask the Trustees in an honest fashion to open as much of their meetings as possible and that they endeavor to communicate to the students much as the students attempt to communicate with Continued on Page 4 from sight. The College Senate must ·~ollow through\ with its proposals and resolutions, to see that they do not become lost at · the highest levels of the governance system. If the Senate is to be an effective legislative body,. it must -keep track of its legislation, to see that its ''adviCe\ is taken with the same force that led to its original passage. Division II Joseph W. Schwartz, '73 (Economics): The All College Senate has definitely not lived up to its potentialities! The Senate is supposed to be the highest decision-making body on campus in all non-budgetary matters. If it really were this, President Martin would not have been able ·to decide that next year Union will have a provost. This decision should have been made by the Senate. Even if this matter were to be interpreted l 1 the Senate as an economic qr !Stion, a vote should still have been taken to indicate to the Trustees the sentiment on campus for such a move. The President should wait for Senate approval before announcing new policy. To do anything but this is to make a mockery of the system. Hand-in-hand with this lack of acting when it should, the Senate is also guilty of one of the worst communications gaps imagin- able. Not only are the students and faculty poorly informed as to Senate actions, the Senate is not aware of campus sentiment about any particular issue. The Senate must take the initiative to make certain that it exercises. its correct role in College Government. The President must be curbed in his unilateral decisions and the college community should be If the student members of the All College Senate are willing and able to speak to their convictions, without succumbing to the more dominating opinions of the Faculty and Administrators, then the Senate will begin to live up to the responsibility it has to the college. Division Ill Stephen R. Cassella, '73 (Psychology): The All College Senate is theoretically powerless until th.e Board of Trustees approves the Governance Report. Even, then, the Senate's authority is questionabl~: because any decision can be reversed by the Trustees. Our lack of true governance is demonstrated in that we have little influence over budgeting priorities. We recommend where money should be spent or programs cut, but the actual amounts are out of our controL Through control of funds, the administration determines the direction and responsibilities of the college. The College Senate has not fulfilled its PQtentialities. We will not lie a true governing body until we have power over the budget and until our decisions are ·final on- all college affairs. Possibly this could be accomplished by_ .expanding the Senate to include T ru:stee representatives. Division IV Robin L.. Waring, '75 (Computer Sci.): The AU-College Senate, the highest governing body on campus, has not yet fulfilled its potential. To reach this state of ''maxim urn effectiveness,\ every student must at least be familiar with the · workings of the Senate, and know who his or her senator is. The Board of Trustees has not yet approved the Governance Report, which is the document that originally set up the All- College Senate. The Trustees' sluggishness has caused such decisions as open meetings to sit idly by. Open meetings are essential to an informed student body, but the decisior.1 cannot be made until the Board passes the Report. The All-College Senate has a tremendous potential if the College can be united behind it. Such topics as: the proposed calendar change, acceptance of transfer 'D' grades, master scheduling, and the petttlon against the 60% tenure ceiling have come up to the Senate this year. At Large Harry Lessin, '75 (i~iology): My answer is no, it has not. This is the first year that the A CS has been operating. As a result, the first half of the year was spent on little more than approving the by- laws. It was during the latter half Continued on Page 4

With 239 delegate votes on the line in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, all three candidates are looking for victories and .strongfinishes. The Massachusetts race has generally been conceded to McGovern, even though Muskie also campai,gned there. McGovern will definitely win a large percentage of the popular vote, but M uskie is pn.tting his money on the delegate races in the Bay State. Muskie has some very popular delegates running in the primary who are pledged to support the M uskie candidacy at the Democratic Convention. But these delegates, like the rest of the Muskie campaign, have been stea<!iily eroding and playing down their commitment to Big Ed. Muskie, who at first hoped to capture a good portion of Massachusetts' 102 delegates, is really struggling to insure that at least 50 of his delegates will win and he thus hapes to salvage his badly faltering campaign.

Shuffling Off To Saratoga by Steve Manus To scale Everest... to swim the . channel... to walk to the Hub from Union, bar by bar. Ridiculous'? No, merely a logical extension of that force which persuades man to give closer examination to that scenery which he has ingloriously ignored for so long. However, such philosophizing cannot disguise the true purpose of the five self-styled Charles Kuralts who headed for Saratoga in pursuit of a good drunk and a memorable start to the belated spring. This article does not intend to glorify alcoholism, but rather hopes to encourage others to investigate the small taverns on this or any other route. Departing from Chi Psi at I :00 by the chimes in the Chapel, the five walkers - Mike Sciacca '74, David Mixer '74, Mark Brickley '74, Calvin Grout '73, and the author headed northeast, bound for their first pit stop. This first bar of many was the notorious College Inn, that den of sin and grease which is usually seen only when one is doing his laundry. However, those who frequent this establishment and the other hangouts of the Wildroot generation realize that there is a good time to be had by all. A pleasant surprise was the Craig Hotel, a hangout for elderly folks who were probably classified as \hot shits.. or \the eat's pajamas\ in their day. Among the useful information gathered from these local sages was the fact that one cannot travel from the old Alco building to the corner of State Street and Nott Terrace without passing under or over a railroad crossing. After an hour's walk, we reached the Burnt Hills Lanes, where we were joined for a beer by three Union students and one burly graduate who answers to numerous names beginning with the last letter of the alphabet. (It appeared that no one in Burnt Hills bowls in the afternoon.) Our next bar was not reached until the infamous Village of Ballston Spa, where we passed many of the cars which observed the speed limits.

The week of schoolwork is Just beginning and the recuperative process from the long weekend is really taking its toll. A week ago Monday was no exception for U Coli's Golf Team, as they man~ged in their first match of the season to compile an 0-2 record. Why an 0- 2 record after only one match? Simply because we lost to both Utica College and Oswego. The tri-team match was held at the relatively easy, short (6,200 yards) Utica College Golf Course, But due to a combination of rain, hail, snow and strong winds, the course played as tough as Augusta. As is the case in these matches with three schools competing, only your four best scores (out of the six golfers participating) are taken into consideration for each team. With, scores of 86 by Paul K.abb, Tony Faga and Gary Friedman and an 87 by ex ... baseball player John Quirk, our linksrn:en lost to Utica by 7 strokes and to Oswego by 32. Fortunately it rained on Thursday cancelling our tri- match with Albany State and New Paltz, but unfortunately the sun was shining on Friday, so we took on Albany State single- handedly. On the same day as the prestigious Tournament of Champions second round was being held at LaCosta Country Club in California, our golf team had enough nerve to travel all the way to beautiful Tall Timber Country Club to do battle with Continued on Page 6 · QUIRK OF FATE: Geno Quirk dive$ home ajier belting inside-the-park homer against Rochester, and is glad-handed by the troops.

Saturday afternoon. Dartmouth beat Union 9-1 in the first contest and the Dutchmen stor:med back to beat the Indians 7-0 in the second. _Unfottunately, for the Union 4Xmen all that counts is the combined score Dartmouth 9, Union 8. The day was indeed frustrating as Dartmouth could do no wrong in the first half, and then the Garnet came back strong, only to have their rally .... fall one goal short. A win over Dartmouth would have made this Wednesday's trip to Canton, N.Y., a lot easier, however, there need not be any shame with regard to this defeat. The Garnet In the f'trst half, B-Mote Erlandson was shell-shocked and Coach Allison responded by putting Mike Peng in the nets for the first time this year. \Moishe\ allowed· 3 goals and the Indians had their nine goals. The lone Union tally came as a result of a fine pass from Bobby Grossman to Barry Gross. Barty finished the day with the 3-goal hat trick giving him ll for the young campaign. It is alleged that Coach Allison whipped up a very potent witch's brew during halftime. The Garnet ·changed their defensive alignment t.o a zone which the Indians fou\nd it virtually impossible to penetrate. The brief rest which 8-More enjoyed in the first h:alf proved to be the answer. as he was flawless in the final stanzas. He made an incredible 19 saves in the second half, including two unbelievable stops on one on one situations. His job was made a little bit easier by the fine defensive play of Tom Reif. After a pair of mediocre games, Harry Garabedian finally played in the manner which he is capable. Harry handled his stick well and showed some scoring power by rocketing in a 20- footer. Freshman Mike Deshler scored the first goal of his varsity career. The rookie from Winchester should certainly help the Garnet in the future. The Lacos, now 1 and 2, are optimistic and looking forward to evening their record this Wednes<fay, when they make the long trip North to meet the Larries of St. Lawrence.

The squad is now 1-2 and its next match is April 29th, at 1:30. by BILL KILLEN Union College baseball experts are busy this week pondering the new found spryness of Coach Art Lawrence. Lawrence spent most of yesterday's game on his feet around his team's bench forsaking his fungo bat-holding sitting position he has been seen in for the past few years. Lawrence's behavior can be explained in one of two ways. Either l) he is excited about his two most recent wins, 17-7 over Rochester last Friday and 5-4 over'Williams yesterday, or 2) he is worrying about the status of his beleagured pitching staff. Yesterday's victory came on Bob Bernhardt's ninth inning two out single which scored pinch runner Greg Breedlove. ' Breedlove was running for the singling Skip Lega and advanced mi a walk and a ground out. The Dutchmen had previously lost a 4-1 lead going into the ninth when the pitching woes finally showed through. Steve Stockman had started and left in the 6th for Jon Gould. Gould had his problems in the ninth and Joe Urschel came on to retire the side after 3 run~ were in and the score tied. Joe Urschel won two more games Friday and Monday lifting -his ,perfect record to 3-0. has been a problem and\ with Bucky Miller having left the staff, Lawrence finds himself somewhat shorthanded. He declined to name a starter for Wednesday's game at Siena. Nevertheless, the Garnet are now 3-0 on the year and early season optimism is becoming a reality. After the game when Lawrence was asked if he was happy with his pitching he said, \No. Why should I be?\ He shouldn't. Against any more worthy -bats than Williams the Dutchmen would have fallen. Inconsistency Last Friday's game was a slugfest for the Union bats .• however, as they banged out 15 hits.

. ' 5 Tuesday, Apri/25, 1972 Consistent As The Caveliers Artful Nine Sweeps Home Stand; Bernhardt, Geno Quirk Deliver by PAUL RIESCHICK Monday's are usually bad days. The week of schoolwork is just beginning and the recuperative process from the long weekend is really taking its toll. A week ago Monday was no exception for U Coli's Golf T earn, as they managed in their first match of the season to compile an 0-2 record. Why an 0- 2 record after only one match? Simply because we lost to both Utica College and Oswego. The tri-team match was held at the relatively easy, short (6,200 yards) Utica College Golf Course. But due to a combination of rain, hail, snow and strong winds, the course played as tough as Augusta. As is the case in these matches with three schools competing, only your four best scores (out of the six golfers participating) are taken into consideration for each team. With scores of 86 by Paul Kabb, Tony Faga and Gary Friedman and an 87 by ex- baseball player John Quirk, our linksmen lost to Utica by 7 strokes and to Oswego by 32. Fortunately it rained on Thursday cancelling our tri- match with Albany State and New Paltz, but unfortunately the sun was shining on Friday, so we took on Albany State single- handedly. On the same day as the prestigious Tournament of Champions second round was being held at LaCosta Country Club in California, our golf team had enough nerve to travel all the way to beautiful Tall Timber Country Club to do battle with Continued on Page 6 QUIRK OF FATE: Gena Quirk dives home ajter belting inside-the-park homer against Rochester, and is glad-handed by the troops. Gena's defense also excelled as his throws kept extra base hits to a minimum. Big Second Half Surge Falls Short By One Goal by Joel Roslyn Hanover was the scene of two lacrosse games Saturday afternoon. Dartmouth beat Union 9-1 in the first contest and the Dutchmen stormed back to beat the Indians 7-0 in the second. Unfortunately, for the Union 4Xmen all that counts is the combined score Dartmouth 9, Union 8. The day was indeed frustrating as Dartmouth could do no wrong in the first half, and then the Garnet came back strong, only to have their rally fall one goal short. A win over Dartmouth would have made this Wednesday's trip to Canton, N.Y., a lot easier, however, there need not be any shame with regard to this defeat. The Garnet performance in the second half says alot for their athletic ability, but says more for the character of the members of this Bruce Allison-inspired ball club. In the first half, B-More Erlandson was shell-shocked and Coach Allison responded by putting Mike Peng in the nets for the first time this year ... Moishe\ allowed 3 goals and the Indians had their nine goals. The lone Union tally came as a result of a fine pass from Bobby Grossman to Barry Gross. Barry finished the day with the 3-goal hat trick giving him I l for the young campaign. It is alleged that Coach Allison whipped up a very potent witch's brew during halftime. The Garnet changed their defensive alignment to a zone which the Leading Scorer: Barry Gross pictured shooting on nets in Wesleyan game has scored 11 goals this season. Indians fou.nd it virtually impossible to penetrate. The brief rest which B-More enjoyed in the first half proved to be the answer, as he was flawless in the final stanzas. He made an incredible 19 saves in the second half, including two unbelievable stops on one on one situations. His job was made a little bit easier by the fine defensive play ofTom Reif. After a pair of mediocre games, Harry Garabedian finally played in the manner which he is capable. Harry handled his stick well and showed some scoring power by rocketing in a 20- footer. Freshman Mike Deshler scored the first goal of his varsity career. The rookie from Winchester should certainly help the Garnet in the future. The Lacos, now I and 2, are optimistic and looking forward to evening their record this Wednesday, when they make the long trip \orth to meet thr Larries of St. Lawrence. Middlebury, who nipped the LaXmen last Spring, will be here Saturday · in what promise> to be an excellent prelim to the Sigma Chi Clambake. Bert Dingley scored the first goal in the J. V. lacrosse match against R.P.I., but the Engineers came on strong to take an I I -3 win. Russ Weiner and Jerry Dwyer had the other two Garnet goals. The squad is now l-2 and its next match is April 29th, at 1:30. by BILL KILLEN Union College baseball experts are busy this week pondering the new found spryness of Coach Art Lawrence. Lawrence spent most of yesterday's game on his feet around his team's bench forsaking his fungo bat-holding sitting position he has been seen in for the past few years. Lawrence's behavior can be explained in one of two ways. Either I) he is excited about his two most recent wins. 17-7 over Rochester last Friday and 5-4 over Williams yesterday, or 2) he is worrying about the status of his beleagured pitching staff. Yesterday's victory came on Bob Bernhardt's ninth inning two out single which scored pinch runner Greg Breedlove. Breedlove was running for the singling Skip Lega and advanced on a walk and a ground out. The Dutchmen had previously lost a 4-1 lead going into the ninth when the pitching woes finally showed through. Steve Stockman had started and left in the 6th for Jon Gould. Gould had his problems in the ninth and Joe Urschel came on to retire the side after 3 runs were in and the score tied.

6 CONCORDIENSIS, Tuesday, April25, 1972 Jerry HandcUffs Panth.er Dashers by ALLISON SLOAT Mother Nature is not a track fan! Proof of this was seen on Saturday when Union trounced Middlebury's track team in a dual meet, winning 96-48, despite the cold and rain. Times, distances, and heights were hindered by the inclement weather. Middlebury was totally outclassed in the four jumping events as Union jumpers. outsco-red them 33-2. Stavhoppers, (Swedish for pole vaulters) Dave Ricks and Floater Clayton, merely went through the motions and earned 8 team points for the Garnet, tying for first place. Tri-captain Mike Rich took one jump at 6'0\ to win the high jump, while Jim Wilber fosburied 5'10\ to place second. After last week's disappointment, the Union long and triple jumpers rebounded by sweeping the long jump and taking first and second in the triple jump. Brad Patterson leaped 21'3W' in the long for first, and 43'6W' for second in the triple. The triple jump was won by frosh Pete Walrath at 44'5W'. Jerry Cuffey and John DeStefano took second and third in the long jump. In the weights, freshman Bill Mowrey once again walked away with top honors. Mowrey put the shot 48'7\ and threw the d.isc l33'W' for two firsts. Another freshman, Bob Cable, grabbed third in the shot. Mike Rich placed third in both the discus and javelin with throws of 117'10\ and 176'4\ respectively. Middlebury, with two of the top javelin throwers in the conference, took the event with a toss of 191 '4\. In the running events, Rich Jaszczak set the pace. The .. chunky\ tri-captain clenched firsts in both the 220 and 440 yd. dashes and anchored both winning relay teams. Sophomore Jerry Cuffey also helped the sprintt':rs after their disappointing by JIM SMITH Union's, netmen played host to the University of Vermont Saturday, and gracious hosts they were. The Garnet yielded to their guests in all six of the contested matches, with three of the Union netters holdillg on for thr.ee sets, Marty Cukierman led off for the D.utchmen, against Vermont's formidable Chuck Taylor. Marty went down in straight sets, but his effort was better than the 6-2, 6-3 score indicates. Stu Fishier was able to do-no better, ~o his opponent, 6-1 and 6-4. Co=captain Jim Skiff showed nice form in taking the first set, but went on to lose, 7-5, 6-4, and 6-l. The frosh flash, Kevin Crawford, came the closest of any of the Garnet netmen to scoring a victory. Kevin took the first set 7-5, and lost the second, 6-4. He was trailing 4-2 in the third set, When-eold rain and a loose string forced a temporary delay of the match. Wl;Jsn play resumed, Kevin began a comeback struggle, forcing the match into a sudden death tie breaker before yielding, 7-6. Another freshman, Steve Wayne put up stubborn resistance, but could not overpower his Vermont foe. Looking like a brilliant strategist, Steve had his opponent running all over the court. Unfortunately, Steve had quite a bit of chasing to do himself, and he finally succumbed: 6,..7, 7-5, and 6-3. Freddie Kaplan also capitulated, ending Union's last hopes of scoring against the Catamounts. By mutual consent, the doubles matches were cancelled, out of respect for Mother Nature, who had provided less than perfect conditions for an outdoor tennis match. The final score: Vermont. 6-Q. \Chunky Bob~' Continued from Page 5 the Great Danes. Chunky Bob Gronauer's (our answer to the tour's Miller Barber) 81 gave Union the best score of the day and Friedman's 84 gave us our second point, but 88's by Quirk, Faga, Kabb and Scott Palmer gave us nothing and we lost by a 5-2 score. With three 86's ort Monday and four 88's on Friday, we have shown remarkable consistency, but it's the kind of consistency that has characterized such teams as the 1962 Mets and the '70-'71 Cleveland Cavaliers. Coach Scanlon attributes the slow start to a lack of practice caused by the bad weather. Unlike his players though, the coach had no trouble his first time out. When asked for his score Scanlon's reply was \a 94 for 27 holes.\ The guess here is that he scored somewhere between 65 and 165. I hope the golfers don't get too teed off at me, but things are looking up for the:n. After all, they've gone from two losses on Monday, to one loss on Friday, t.o today's postponement. If only the weather keeps up! Bic(k) Runs Every· Time The Marathon INTRODUCTION: Professor Theodore Bick, department of mathematics, ,recently ran in the Boston Marathon along with four students from Union College, finishing 499th out of 1081 runners in 3 hours and 16 minutes. He revealed his feelings of the race in an exclusive interview with the Union Star and Concordi~nsis. by MARK MINDEL \Someone said that there are only a dozen racers in the Boston Marathon and the rest of the field are just runn~rs.\ Professor Bick emphasized that as a runner in the classic event he had quite an experience, one he's likely never to forget. It all started last summer when he ran into a couple of friends of his who were training fot a marathon. Professor Bick had read a book on \Aerobics\ and was interested in running to keep in shape. He started training with these men, one a friend of his from G.E., and was amazed that he could. keep up with them for the first few miles. Gradually after much work he was running fifteen miles with his companions and at that point the thought struck him, \Why not the Marathon for me?'' · With nine months of gruelling roadwork behind him, and two marathons under his belt (the Atlantic Coast race, where he ran the 26 miles in 3 hours, 31 minutes, and the New York City contest, which he logged the score and six in 3:12.--); he headed for Boston with sights set on breaking the three hour mark. But the weather was extremely wann last Monday as Professor Bick and 1100 other runners crowded the Hopinkton High School starting line at noon. \It was a real mob scene, luckily we were only about 25 feet from the starting line at the gym. Incidentally, afterwards my wife told me that the high school band had been playing, but all I heard was the gun ... You have to sort of keep up with people at the beginning to keep from getting trampled, but in a surprisingly short time things begin to thin out and you have room to maneuver.\ For the first twenty .. one miles he ran side by side with his friend Gage Hotchkiss until he hit Heartbreak Hill. This monster hill is actually only about a half mile long 'but it climaxes a s.eries of smaller hills which all told tend to destroy the marathoner. Heartbreak Hill is not eVen too steep, but it comes \at the wrong time in the i:ace.\ Here is where the heat, the hill and the mileage took its toll on Professor Bick. He bad hit the halfway mark at WeUsley where his wife clocked him in one hour and 31 minutes, just a hare over a perfect· three hour pace. But when he hit the top of Heartbreak where the Boston College campus is located a little boy came up to him with a glass of water. Instead of drinking it he ' poured it over his head. Perhaps this little break and slice of comfort -had a reverse psychological effect on him, perhaps . it was jus.t the combination of factors but · his whole body cramped · up. It started in one leg then moved to the other when he tried to favor . the first; Then his stomach muscles cramped due to his change in running form. This hampered his breathing. \After that I never got it back together, my neck muscles started to cramp and everyone passed me by. \The last six miles were kind of hazy, . kind of we:ird. I. kept watching· the Prudential Building where the race ends anci tried to guess how far it was. \Someone in tlle c:rowd yelled that I had just a mile: an£. a half to .go and I thought, \'I can· rnalce it.' Then a little furtherdown the road someone else y-elled; 'keep going, just a mile and 3 /.1 to.go',\ At the finis}). the crowd is so huge you almost ha\Ve to push your way through. Profess<Jr Bick said he was disa _:ppointed in his time until after tbe race was over. He took a sllower and casually dressed the:n reported back to the finis.h for his official time and .place only to find people still pouring across the finish line in droves. · His overall view o:f ,the event was that it was not all athletic contest, full of cornp~tition (the only · enemy being (he course itself), but Was an event of cameraderie. When Wayne Roe, Bryant Moeckel, a11d Jim Johnson passed Mr. H:()tchkiss and the professor, til~ older runners shouted wottds of true encouragement to the Schenectady cohorts, ~tnd this was the general feeling ()fall the runners to each other.. Even the people of Boston who turned out in dr<>ves fQr the traditional event \deserv.e three cheers.\ \They gave us oranges, and gatorade as we passeed by and, checking our numbe:rs in the daily papers, shouted otit words of encouragement IJsing our names.\ In conclusion Prof-essor Bick smiled as he said,. \I tmin.k if's an experience that ahn<ll~t anyone who wants to work .at it hard enough can do; and aln:l<Jst feel like saying, ought to d o, ••. that's how I feel now anyway.:!\ Nusbaum's 447~.51 $TATE ST.

8 CONCORDIENSIS, Tuesday, April:J5, 1972 ' ' LawYone's ·Bach On Saturday Continued/rom Page 1 interested in certain strategic points on the Burmese border. He came away from these border negotiations with the belief that his country must always be firm in its dealings with th.e government of Communist China. LawYone added an interesting personal note to this discussion.

Wallace Village. the international project of Sigma Chi, is located in Bloomfield, Colorado. The center provides education and rehabilitation for children with minimal brain damage. Treatment consists of academic, social and external therapies on an individual basis, according to the needs as shown in medical, psychological, and educational diagooses of the children. The Union College chapter of Sigma Chi, through the combined efforts of its brotherhood and the college community, has already donated over $1,000 to the center as a result of the last three clambakes. The $3 admission to the clambake, where steamed clams, hot dogs, beer and potato salad will be served, also includes a band party beginning at 9 p.m. at the House. Sigma Chi is urging the entire campus to take advantage of this opportunity to support a worthy project and also demonstrate its ability to act as a single unit. Ti.ckets for the clambake are $3.00 in advance or $3.50 at the door and may be obtained from any brother. for information call 346-9582.

Mr. ·Moore, a ·graduate of Wesleyan - a college which has expended much on instituting a program to attract members of minority groups - felt that it was necessary that Union hire the needed personnel so that minority group students wauld not feel alienated from tbe remainder of the college community. Professor Norman Walbek of the Political Science Department questioned whether or not the sentiments expressed by many of the students at the session had by PHYLLIS R. EDELMAN A modern language survey, conducted in the Fall of 1971 to measure student interest in further or future language study, particularly Russian, has been released by Associate Professor Robert Sharlet, Director of the Program in Comparative Communist Studies. The survey, prepared and conducted by Wayne T. Senegal, '72; was distributed to i 91 language students, 58 majoring in Modern Languages and the n~mainder in other fields. The problem with Russian, according to Associate Professor Paul Le Clerc, Acting Chairman of t-he Department of Modern Languages and . Literature, has been that few students continue their studies above the elementary level. This has permitted the administration to cut back on a full-time position. Prof. Le Clerc reinforced Prof. Sharlet's statement that \an increase in staff depends upon a dramatic increase in enrollment in upper level courses.\ Israel Term Success As Students were asked to indicate their interest in -German, Russian, French, Spanish, Chinese, Hebrew, Italian, Arabic, and any other language even if not alrea9y offered at Union. The languages were rated on a scale of zero to five, five representing greatest interest in Prof. Sharlet also indicated that the Executive\'Committee of the Program in Comparative Communist Studies has reduced the language requirement to one Russian or Chinese language course above the 12 level. The Russian requirement will now be consistent with the maximum number of courses that will be offered by Mrs. Jeni.akoff on campus in the future. CAC .Endorses Hebrew by GEORGE BAIN As History Profess9t·. Stephen Berk says he is \very·p1iaseq ~a:n~ extremely satisfied\ .. -\\{itlr ~\·:tn~ results of the 1972 Tettir· in Isr~~f program, the All C:t6)1ege Sen~te will soon receive tfii: pr-oposals of the Curricular Affairs Committee concerning the Judaic Studies program at Union. Following recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on Judaic Studies, the CAC wants the Hebrew Language offerings continued for 'three more years and Hebrew l 0 made a prerequisite to the Term in Israel. The future of the Term in Israel Comp Ed project, first offered this year, is assured. In the program, students lived and worked on kibbutzim, the Israeli collective farms. Prof. Berk, advisor to the Term in Israel, is \ecstatic\ over the reactions of the 25 students who participated in the program this past winter tertn. From talking with some of them at great length and reading some of the journals which were ·required. for course credit, he feels that not only did the students gain great insights into Israel society and life on the kibbutz but that their journals also ,showed an impressive form of personal introspection. \I don't think they thought they were capable of this introspection,'' says Berk. \They learned a lot about themselves and their wants, likes, and dislikes,\ and he feels that this fortunate by-product of the term abroad was a response to the unique society in which the students lived. . That society was the kibbutz, th.e voluntary, rural, collective societies that comprise four percent of Isra~l's population. A kibbutz is based on the collective . philosophy, with all land and property belonging to the .community; but for a few exceptions, personal property does not exist. The kibbutz is a community of direct self-government in which all members can participate in all decision-making, including admitting and dismissing members. It provides for all the needs (including medical and educational) of its members, and Berk sums up, \it is not an ideal community but a community motivated by ideals.\ All members work for their kibbutz, and the diversity of work includes heavy agriculture, factory management, citrus crops, dairy and turkey farming, education, and service jobs for the community. Continued on Page- 3 further or future study. According to the results of the survey, for the entire sample Russian ranked third (2.45) in preference, below only French (3.03) and Spanish (2.59). All men ranked Russian as third (2.44) behind French (2.82) and Spanish (2.52). All women Mrs. Jernakoff has been hired as a part-time instructor for Russian 10, II, 12, and an independent study. There ts, however, a larger variety of courses offered in Chinese by Assoc. Prof. William Woo. ranked Russian as fourth (2.47), -------------\--~ tailing French (3.33), Spanish (2.69), and German (2.61). Non-majors indicated interest in Russian (2.38) above all other languages except French (2.81 ). For: modern language majors Russian was their fourth preference (2.62). Prof. Sharlet noted that there is obviously considerable support for Russian language studies among non-majors. His hope is that interest in Russian as shown in the survey \will manifest in enrollments.\ Increased interest as expressed through enrollments could in the future reinstate a full time Russian professor. Elections for the major College offices will be held Tuesday, May 2 between 7:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.; in cases when no candidate has achieved a majority vote runoff elections will occur the following night. The Elections Commission requests that all floor and fraternity senators pick up the ballots at Student Activities on May 2 either at 4:30 p.m. or after 7:30 p.m. BaUots must be returned by 11:40. · Students living off campus may vote all day in Student Activities.

To the College Community: recruitment is stalled. At the same time. minority and women faculty recruitment is at a minimum. Ya GtJtta·Have Heart I would like tQ announce my candidacy for the office of Division 4 Representative to tb.e College Senate. I would also like to answer the question put forth in the preceding issue of Concordiensis. I do not feel that the College Senate has fulfilled its potentialities. This is due to many reasons. The blame is not the Trustees. the Senate could act without the approval of the Governance Report by the Trustees. this at least woUld indicate the opinion of the campus on the issues. In the case of the Hoop Pebate, the Senate expressed its dismay at the ruling made- by the NESCAC. It did not determine the relative value of Union's membership in the conference and the tournament. Th~ Senate should have made this decislon anq not pass an ineffective resolution as it did. The Senate must act on all issues that come before it if only to provide its advice. Student apathy and a lack of communication seems also to hinder the Senate. The representatives are there, hut how tnany know who they are, or haVe ever ~ttemptecl to see them: To counteract the lack of contact betWeen students and their representatives. I feel·is up ~o the representative. The representative must seek out .his cQnstituents and determine what they thin!(. With this interaction between the rep,resenta ti ve atl'd constituents and a w.illingness on the part of the Senate to accept its responsibilities, I fed the Senate will fulfill its potentialities. Anyone interested in contacting me may call346-9973. Sincerely, W . .John Hartrnan(Math) ·accomplish this.· First, we should consider the possibility of publishing some type of information sheet which would set forth our opinion~ on some of the issues . the board pla11s to discuss at its Up~oming meetings. This .. newsletter\ would be prepared by a student committep and sent to all the members of the board so that they might have· the · opportunity to properly absorb and understand our feelings before attending any given meeting. I would also like to suggest that we attempt to take aqvantage of the proximity of some of our trustees by inviting them •tO discuss With students opinions on issues of mutUI;ll concern. I would hope that such meetings would assume an. informal character so that all those wanting to ce:mld personally present their views and get a. first-hand reaction to them. There are numerous policies which I feel must be carefully reassessed· in light ·of the changing complexion of the student population. The manner in which bu<:lget allocations are ''made should be reviewed with an eye toward achieving a distribution of resources which is more commensurate With .student interest and concerns. Certainly~ the fine arts department, which has undergone an unprecedented ~owth in tb~ri:f:!flliti~d'_ew years, ~s one ar~a .. ;in. ·vvhic_!l, ~e •ll~!eq··to reexamme our flnailctal pn:o.nttes. There, of course,are ll!any·otherareasin a -similar predicament. As your representative, I would attempt to keep abreast of these situa.tion8 so that tog~ther, we wQuld· initiate the changes we felt were necessary. Included on the Student Election Ballot of May 2 will be a referendum question asking the student body to allocate 10% of its tax money for the recruitment of minority group faculty and students, We, the undersigned, believe it is imperative that this referendum be passed in order to .continue and further the progressive nature of this i'lstitution. The failure ·of the student and faculty recruitment is due in great part to the College's financial burdens. However, it is also due to a distinct lack of commitment on the part of the administration. Recently, members of the Board of Trustees stated that they desired evidence of student interest in socio-economic diversity at the College. A positive vote on the May 2 referendum would be· the most substantial evidence possible. · Faga F9r Godfather It is difficult, in this limited space, to present completely what my total approach to this office would be, I realize that it's easier to point out~problerns than to solve them. There is a lot we all must do to improve our community. I ask for your support and assure you that I will make every effort to work with you for the changes we desire ... On several i. mes of significance to the College in the recent past, students, with help from the faculty, have led the way in shaping the direction of change at Union. It was only through the explicit actions of the students that the ·tdministration was induced to adopt certai'l policies that have often fundamentally improved Union College. It should be noted that certain of these policies were initially opposed by a majority of the administration and the Board of Trustees. through the concerted efforts of Union students in 1969 parietal rules (remember those?) and the maintenance (physical education) requirements were substantially modified. In 1970, the Pass-Fail option and coeducation were instituted following active student leadership in both areas. In 1971, the Mountebanks lighting board was secured and a new governance plan was adopted after considerable student effort. So far in 1972 students have led a strong push for the abolition of the 60% tenure ceiling. Now we have the opportunity to lead the College towards progressive social change by ratifying the student tax recruitment referendum. It is well known that Union is unfortunately not noted for its socio- economic diversity. It took many years for Union to admit even token numbers of black and women students. Now as the numbers of women students moves towards the maximum number planned, it 1s evident that minority student A commitment of 10% of the student tax money to minority recruitment would indeed represent a sacrifice on *e part .of the student. Ten percent of the student tax fund is approximately $10,000. Currently the Tax Committee is maintaining a ·$16,000 reserve and hopes to add $3,000 more to that reserve this Year. $10,000 is certainly a large amount of money, however, in our view it is a minimal sacrifice in comparison to the benefits that · would be accrued to the Union College community by a more socio-economically diverse institution. An affirmative vote on May 2 will once again commit the student body to a policy that should be supported by the administration and the Board. The student body must point in the direction it desires to go. A more diverse socio-economic campus is to everybody's benefit. David Castteman, '73 Mark S. Coven, '72 Steven CasseDa, '73 Philip E.

Letters WOlf It Down This past year I have effectively served as the student representative of Division (2) to the All-College Senate, as well as student delegation representative on the Agenda Committee of the A.C.S. I have gained experience in dealing with faculty and administrators in order to gain their needed support in implementing student proposals. I have actively sought student opinion as the primary input to policy decision-making. Although I will be absent for three meetings, due to study in France next fall, an interim representative will be appointed to represent Division (2) students in the A.C.S. I feel it is_ my ethical responsibility to inform you of. this situation. I feel as great a responsibility to ensure effective, forward change in the system of governance at Union. I have come to the frightening and angering realization that the A.C.S. has, indeed, fulfilled its potentialities as defined in the Governance Report. I believe the real problem is that the Governance Report's definition has emasculated the potential role of the A.C.S. as a strong and representative community decision-making body. I feel that experience is a necessary ingredient of effectiveness. My experiences at Union and my desire to improve our community compel me to seek a change in a system which stifles student autonomy and community action. RespectfUlly seeking your support, Dan Wolfe, A.C.S., Div.

Last A breast Of Issues Friday we liste~ed to the ~r~~te~s explain The Board of Trustees is basically responsible for governing the coitege community. As a result of recent policy changes, students have become voting meii1bers ofthe Board. The significance of this position is obvious, as is the necessity for concerned, enlightened, and informed student representation. I believe that one nf the most important functions of a representative is the development and articulation of student opinions. In order to accomplish this; it is necessary that we establish a system for more direct and open communication. At the very least, we have failed to take advantage of both Concordy and WRUC to encourage Student interest in activities of the boar& These are both natural and accessible forums and, as your representative, I would attempt to harness their potential. One of the primary goals of a representative should be the education of the other trustees concerning student attitudes and' opinions.

4 ORTS CONCORDIENSJS, Friday, April 28, 1972 Continentals Tracked, Fieldmen Throw Weight The sun was shining on Hamilton at the beginning of the meet. Then the sun went down and Union took over. The air cooled off and so did Hamilton. After the first few eve~ts the future did not look bright for the Garnet. Hamilton began its attack by winning the 440 relay and then coming right back to sweep the mi'Ie. However, when all the results came in Union had defeated Hamilton's .thinclads 90- 55. The field event accounted for more than half of Union's team points. The Dutchmen swept the shet put, long jump, triple jump, high jump, and took first and second in the pole vault. First, secend, and third place honor in the shot put went to three first year men, Bill Mowrey, Bob Cable, and AI Gilewicz. Mowrey won the event with a pot of 49'2\ then he came hack to win the discus with a throw of 137'1 !;5. Brad Patterson grabbed first in the long jump and second in the triple jump with distances of 22;1 W' and 44'1 W' respectively. Patterson was complemented in both jumps by freshman Pete Walrath. Walrath leaped 19'3\ for second in the long jump and 44'2\ for first in the triple. . · M-m-m Cood '(J Coli high jumpers also brought in a full nine team points.

After overcoming the shock of Hamilton sweeping the first two running events, Rich Jaszczak and Steve Wood sped to finish first and second in the 440 yd. dash with times of 50.6 and 51. I. Jaszczak then came hack to win the 220 yd. dash in· 22.5. Frosh Chris Doulides was only .2 seconds behind Jaszczak taking second. Union picked up two more firsts in the 180 yd. high hurdles and 440 yd. intermediate hurdles. Mike Rich captured the win in the highs followed closely by Dick Kern and Holley Carnright to sweep the event. Later Tim McCabe ran a 59.5 to clinch the intermediates. McCabe teamed up with Jaszczak, Wood and Greg Hamlin to run the mile (photo by Les Kernan) ONE-TWO PUNCH: Rich Jaszczak and Chris Doulides sweep to first and second place in the 200 in 22.5 and 22.7.

Hamilton's Ken Judson ran two excellent races winning both the mile and the three mUe run. Jim Johnson added three points ttl the Garnet total by finishing second in the three mile run with a time of 15:11.7. 2nd lhlf Coflnpse Plagues L{Rrnen by JOEL ROSLYN No more excuses. Yesterday was a disappointing afternoon up in Canton, N.Y. The Larries of St. Lawrence whipped the LaXI!len 10- 8. Anyone who has been to this academic haven in the North Country, knows. it's a long trip from beautiful, sunny Downtown Schenectady - especially after losing to a team that should have been beaten. The Garnet came out looking ragged but managed to walk off the field at half-time with a 6-3 lead. Unfortunately for the Garnet there was a second half to be played. A fired up St. Lawrence squad scored 5 unanswered goals in the second half and the Dutchmen had to play catch up - not an easy task. It could be that the Garnet suffered a mental letdown after that tough loss up in Hanover - but Wednesday they showed none of the talent, hustle and desin: which has so far characterized this year's team. In the fourth quarter, St. Lawrence played with 2 mid-field lines, yet they still out-hustled the Garnet defense. Del!apitated B-More lost his head, and almost·t:ook off someone else's, and the Garnet were without their goalie. Coach Allison brought in freshman Mike Deshler to try and mind the cage. Unlike the days of Ed Green, the Garnet now have no understudy for B-More, and when he's out they're in trouble. Several of the Dutchmen managed to score. Harry Garabedian, the \Golden Jet,\ Barry Gross, and co- captain Mark Sanderson, all scored and assisted on other goals. The Panthers from Middlebury will be here on Saturday. Hopefully, the Garnet will remember that there are two halves to each game. Sunshine is guaranteed, and rumor has it that the most famous guarantor in sport, Joe \Willie has promised a WIN.
