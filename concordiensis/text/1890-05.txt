The proper solution of this delicate · question is the entire abolishment of a·. system which, to say the least, is doubtful· in its influence. * * -t(- TBE CoNCORDIENSIS' had aTranged to · publish an article this month by Dr. A. W. Uowles, '45, e.x-president of the Elmira· Female College. 0\ving to pressuve of· work, however, Dr. Cowles 'vas unable to · furnish. his copy in time. While regret- . ting sincerely the loss of Dr. Cowles'relni- niscences, we think that the articles found in this number ';vill please not only the • alumni, who have not seen then1 in the Unive~-sity, but will be of value to all if in a file of the CONCORDIENSIS. We have procured, at so1ne extra expense, electro- types of the University cuts; and aTe sure that the illustrations, this n1onth, are the most COil1 plete tpis paper has ever held. -3{- -x- * WE refer our readers to our colurnn of necrologies for the accounts of the death of a nu1nber of very prominent alumni. When the list of necrologies fot·the present year is ,made out at comn1ence1nent it will be staetling in its length and the pro1ni- nence of the Inen who have died. * * * THE audiences that have regularly p;ath- ered twice a week to listen to the lectures upon ''Modern France\ by Prof. Wells have as regularly departed charmed with the pleasant entertain1nent and the feeling of newly-gathered information. Especi- ally to the n1embers of the senior class have the lectures been enjoyable and bene- ficial. · 'O~NE hears no little protest from alumni concerning the abolishment of grove ex- ercises. There is no more beautiful spot on A1neTican college grounds than our natural amphitheatre in the garden ; and the afternoon exercises and n1usic in this place have always been rernarked by visi\tors as charming. Why can we not have a grove concert. FATRONIZE THOSE WHO PATRONIZEUS. The Union CoUege Grounds.

THE CONOORDIEN8IS. 109 SOUTH COLLEGE. for the comfort and convenience of both students and professors. No description of the Union College . grounds would be cotnplete without a ref- erence to the Chinese idol, fascinating in THE IDOL. its hideousness, w hjch is 1nounted on a pedestal in the edge of the grove behind · the Powers building. This stone mon- strosity was sent to the college by one of her: missionaries to ·Ohina, t\\ 7 enty years ·· or so ~go, and was at once inaugurated as the tutelary deity of the coUege students. Around it were held the Inidr}ight eeremonies whose n1ystie rites no freshman ever revealed, .and the an11ual crerna:tions which marked the eornpletion of some detested study. Nor does any freshn1an class regard its duty fully performed until it has deco- rated the god in .some new and st,art- ling eon1binatiou of colors.. Our final illustea tion presents him in all his n1ajestic beauty. A,mong the Oar1nina Concordice \vhich n1ake up the goodly volun1e of Union College songs, there is none which is so universally sung and universally loved; none which so stirs the loyal blood of the Union student or alumnus, as the glorio11s •' Song to Old U nio11. '' The song writers of Union have been such men as John Boward Payne, Alfred B. Street and Homer'\ Greene, but none has so touched the popular college heart as did Fitzhugh Ludlow ('56) w·hen he wrote this song. It is the song which enlivens e-very alu:mni g~:dheTing, \vhich is pi~inted 011 every Oon1- 1nencen1ent progran1me and sung by every Oon1 rr1encernent audience, the inspiring n1elody which at once wakes the pride and quickens the hopes of every son of ''Old Union.'' ''Then here's to thee, tbe brave and free, Old Union smiling o'er us ; And for many a day. as .tby walls grow gray, May they ring with thy children's.chorus.\ ROBERT C. ALEXANDER. The foHowfng consists of extracts taken from a long and able artiele upon. the life of President Webster, by Samuel Marsh, LLD., '6'i'. These extracts contain items of Union history per- haps not familiar to all-En. In September, 1866, I first n1et the sub- ject of this sketch as a fellow-student at Union College.

Inasmuch as the lliife o:ff Pt·esident Web- · ster since 1860, a space of thirty years, ·· has been so closely connec~ed with Union College, a brief consideration. of the con-- • dition of the college at the tin1e of the · commencement of my intimate relations • with him, and the I'elatioils of the college , to t.he country, may not he inappropriate .. In the year 1866 President Eliphalet N ott died, after s1xty-two years of service to · the college, and seventy -fi.-ve years' devo- tion to the welfa]}e of the: people of the United States. any exigency, was William H. ;Seward (Union, '20), Minister of State. Jefferson Davis, in his desperate strug- gle to maintain a new :Commonwealth, selected as his first adviser a man of wonderful alertness, great versatility, extraordinary fertilit,y of resource, and undaunted personal caur~ge,. Robert Toombs (Union, '28), Oonredera.te Minis- ter of State. In 186'2,. President I..incoln, under the advice of Secretary Stanton, placed a graduate of Union in the supreme com- rnand of the armies of the United States. I refer to Genera] Henry Wager Hallock; of the class of '37. In the Senate of the United States- 1861 to 1867-·chief among the great war leaders and great in council was Ira Har- ris (Union, '24 ). The democratic minority was led by a 1nan who knew no fear, matchless in debate, unterrified by the preponderance of iniinical n limbers, whose physical endurance was unprecedented in the annals of history-James A. Bayard, Union again, class of '19. Dr. Laurens P. Hiclcok (Union, '20), . from the acting became actual president, · and began his first ac.aden1ic term as such, in Septernber, 1806. He was ably sus- tained in his woTk by Tayler Lewis (Union, '20), a gr•eat and good man, beloved, as was the :new pTesident, by all . who knew him. Professors Jackson and Gillespie were me:n of high repute, and · had done much to aid Dr. Nott in placing Union in the vanguard of An1erican col- leges. By death and by resignatio11 the terms of these diSJtinguished educators terininated and their relations to the col- lege ceased at or about the tin1e of Web- ster's graduation in 1868. I may not, perhaps, be accused of digression if I present briefly a statement of the relations of Union O'ollege at this period to the country, and I shall en- deavor to show that at a time of great . public tribulation in all sections, it was to the sons of Union that the people looked for guidance n1ore than to the graduates of any other institution oflearning, save, possibly, the MilitaTy Academy at West Point. I shall not atten1pt to adduce cumula- tive exan1ples of other graduates of Union, distinguished in battle, in the arts and sciences, to prove that Union College at the time I have na1ned stood first among our colleges in the high character and distinguished services of her gradu- ates. It would seem to be unnecessary. Neither shall I attempt to disguise the fact that although a high standard of scholarship has always been maintained at Union, her relative position has been During the time of the Civil War, the strong man upon whom Abraham Lincoln chiefly leaned, who never failed him in · lowered by reason of the enoremous sun1s of money donated to state and denomina- tional colleges not two hundred miles dis- tant fron1 Schenectady.

I have dwelt upon the glory of Union, and the peripd of dep!Dession which, with her as with many other colleges, North and South, followed the close of the war .. I do not hesitate, however, to make the confident prediction tha.t should the pres- · en,t control of the coHege be maintained for another twenty -four years, the fore- most rank among American coUeges will bg regained and Inaintained, and I shall proceed to give '' the reasons £or the faith tht . ~ \ .. a , IS n1 me : - First) because the trustees of Union College are men of unusual intelligence and zeal, working in accord for one defi- nite object, the advancement of the best interests of the college. Second, because the faculty, as now constituted, is made up of capable, pro- gressive and enthusiastic instructors, each peculiarly fitted and trained for the spec- ial work of his department. rrhird, because the president is a man preeminent an1ong college presidents, who is in full accord with the trustees and faculty, and enjoys the confidence of both, as well as the hearty good will of the alumni, and the love and respect of the students.

Up to the time the CONCORDIENSIS went to press but one of the le~gue gan1es in vvhich Union was a party baa been played. It resulted happily as the heading shows. The game was an interesting one to watch, very few costly errors being 1nade and the work of the batteries being excellent on both sides. The feature of the game, perhaps, vvas the cool, calculating pitching ...

Although Union was blanked. in two innings, the . outcotne of the gan1e was never :in doubt. The visitors got :a man to third base only , once in the cotu~se of the game. Our · team, as it now stands, is, ahnost with- , out exception, entirely satisfactory and : trustworthy; and it only needs such . work as this continued to place the pen- nant on our campus.

Albany a few days before; as it was full of exciten1ent from the first to the last inning~ and .· every one was kept in an anxious state, as regaTded the outcotne of the ga1ne, until the very last 111an WFtS put out. The '~Varsity '' played a .sp~endid gan1e in every way. They out hatted their op- ponents and indeed played the better field- ·· ing garne, having fe-vver errors credited · to them than did Ridgefield. The base ·· hits of ~he Ridgefield team·, however, can1e in at more opportune tirnes and their errors w·flre not so cos.tly. Union came · very near tieing the game in the ninth : inning, when by heavy batting they scored • three runs, only one score more was needed ' to tie the game, but with their best, efforts · the men could not succeed in getting that one run, and the game -vvas lost. The base running of the Varsity was a . great improvement on that in other gaines, and the team batted splendidly. Ginebra in centre field played a great game and batted in fine for1n. Babcock, although · credited with two errors, fielded his posi- ·. tion splendidly, accepting n1any difficult : chances. McQueen and Pickford did the best .• batting for Union. JYIGDonald, the Ridge- · field short-stop, made two or three difficult catches and played vvell, and Batcheller • as usual played first base fo1· ''all it was : worth.\ The official score follows : RIDGEFIELD.

The gatne yesterday afternoon between the Union and Han:ilton co liege tea1ns was better attended than any previous gan-:te this season. The day was bright and favorable for the sport and the pretti- ness of the scene was enhanced by a sprinkling of the fair sex, arrayed in brightly colored gowns. StYveral close decisions were n1ade by the umpire which aroused considerable dissatisfaction, but with this exception and a clever trick played on ·the visitors by Gi11ebra, who, by the way, pitched fine ball, the game was without incident which ·would require special con1n1ent.

On Saturday, May 24th, Union had the . pleasure of defeating the Colgate nine . which is said to be the strongest team i~ the league. 'rhis we doubt. The largest crowd of the season was in attendance and went away satisfied when the game · ended with the score 3-1 to our favor .. Colgate 1nade her one run on an error in the first inning, and after that was sue- · cessively retired without score. Union also made her entire score in one inning- the second. rrhe game was close, exciting and a remarkably good exhibition of the National game. The battery work and difficult catches by Mosher and Pickford, were the features of the ga1ne.

She is acting as legally as the base-ball constitution requires. There isn't a professional player on her team, If the men who claim that MJt. Ginebra is a professional kne-w anything about athletics, they would know that a man who belongs to the New York: Athletic Club cannot be a professional. If they knew anything aLout the Ridgefield club,. they would know that our battery is not or never was the Ridgefield battery. If they knew anytlling about Union College they would know that her authorities would not allow a man, otherwise -than a legitimate student to sail under her colors. v 1 \Te hope we have heard the end of this nonsense. Because Union thus far is the only college that has won every league game, is not sufficient cause to trump up excuses for protesting games.-EDITOR.
