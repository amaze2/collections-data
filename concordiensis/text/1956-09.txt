Gathering at the flagpole at 7 p.m., 300 members of the class Df '60 plan to wreak havoc with the Schenectady traffic system by camping at main intersections fo-r songs and cheers. An attempt to organize the noise and excess ex.- huberance will be made by the cheerleaders under captain Mich- ael Pincus. From there the !rosh, garbed in their m(}st outlandish sieeping attire and accompanied by a. large number of upperclassmen, will proceed down Nott Terrace. After several stops on the way; the parade will turn down State Street tD Erie Boulevard and then go north to Union .Avenue.

Retreat at Lake George This fall and last, through the generosity of the Van de Cars, the Union faculty and administration have met in a two-day \retreat\ at Lake George to discuss the problems of the coming year. These informal bull-sessions have proved excellent introductions to the college for new membet·s of the staff, and have helped to strengthen the morale of the entire faculty. The main topic of discussion this year was the \Self- Study\ which the college has prepared for submission to the l\Iiddle States Association of Colleges for their \evaluation\ visit of next l\Iarch 3-6. One of the import- ant goals of 1956-57 is a good showing as a result of this inspection. I believe Union is in top shape for this test. Alumni Director Henry Swanker presented at this meeting the results of a questionnaire study ()f the classes of 1936, 1941, and 1951. Our graduates have done very well in graduate study and in worldly success, but the best part of the suney was the oven•.'helming endorsement fi!f Union and its program by our recent alumni. This should be encouraging to the students now enrolled. There was long and useful discussion by the faculty of the ways by which engineers and liberal arts students may profit from working together on the same campus. This is a continuing objective at Union, and one which shall probably never be satisfied. The faculty agreed that joint participation in extra-curricular activities and fra- ternities was perhaps the best fonn of student integration. The counseling program and the grading system occu- pied much of our time, but the chief faculty C()ncern was that we must do even more for the superior student through \56\ courses and other opportunities for advanced study and research. The new program of the Concert and Lecture commit- tee was widely approved, and it was hoped that student attendance at evening affairs would rise to new highs. The faculty were encouraged by the news that the Kresge Foundation of Detroit has pledged $50,000 toward our new library building on condition we raise the balance by the end of 1957. We are now half way to our goal, and I feel confident that 1957 will bring us victory in this campaign. Best wishes for a good year. Carter Davidson We Wonder • • • ,• Raymond M.

Hoffman, who gi•ad- uated in 1944; returned to the colw lege in Scptembet· of 1954 after several years with the Bell Tele- phone Laboratories. He had previously taught here from 1946 to 1950 and before leaving earned his M.S. degree in Engineering. Professor Clare W. Graves re- ceived his A.B. at Union in 1940, joining the faculty in 1948 as an Associate Professor of Psychol- ogy.

Advanced this year from As- sociate Professor to Professor of Economics was Dr. Lawrence Abbott. A Harvard graduate, Professor Abbott holds .M.A. and Ph.D. d£>grees from Columbia University. Before coming to Union in 1953 from the faculty of Mt. Holyoke College, he had served as contributing editor of Time Magazine and as Senior Musical Writer and Director of Musical Rc>search for the Na· tional Broadcasting Company. Dr Norman B. Johnson, Chair- man· of the Committ<'e on Relig- ious Life at Union, has been pro- moted to Professor of Religion.
