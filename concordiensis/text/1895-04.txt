r. , .. THE CONC,ORDIENSIS. 5 Verges. BY FITZHUGH LUDLOW. fWdtten before he wrote the \Hashish-Eater.\] 1. .. rrhere was a jolly fellow who lived :about the town, He disa.pproved of toddy, and so he put it down; He attended public dinners for fun and freedom's sa.ke., And Uke a seeond Polycarp went .smiling to the stectk. 2. His vests were irreproachable, his trousers of the kind, Adown whose steep declivities hound rushes after bind; They were a speaking pattern, every tailor would agree,- But oh ! alas, they were too tight to speak co- herently. 3. Up baJf a dozen pairs of stairs our hero went to bed, With nothing but the angels and the rafters o'er his kead; And so, a,lthough he loved to be where brandy va- po~· ~~urled, The1~e never was a man who lived so much above tke WOTld. 4. No board of all the roof was known a meeting e'er to bold. And so the roof was nothing but a trap for catch- ing cold. 'There was a door; the carpenter had left the lock behind, It runst have slipped him, as he had no ''Locke upon the n1ind.\ 5. No dome was there; no window stained with Peter and his keys, 7. Our hero's uncle used to dye to keep himseU alive, He kept a shop in Hemstead Row at n.u1nber thirty-five; But when, as every dyer must, he felt his eolors fail, Before he kicked the bucket. he turned a Httle pale. 8. He called his nephew to his side. and, -with a mournful mien, Said ''I feel blue to leave you; you mustn',t think it green; · I've not gained much by dying, but I leave you all my pelf, It may assist you, if you ever want to dye your- self.\ 9. , His spirit fled and left the youth to woe and roll- ing collars, As dolorous as any man who has a heap of dollars; But, ··Oh!\ said be, \let others dye; there're fools enough, I trow, For though the colors may be fast, the trade is very slow. 10. \I'll cut the man who cuts my hair, and then the thing is plain That I shall be beyond a doubt a lion in the .mane. I'll buy Inyself a pair of bays as early as I can, For l've often heard my uncle say that life is but a span.\ 11. But oh! how vain to try to change the color of his days, For he could not conceal himself behind his screen of bays; No yarn of all that he might spin cou!d hide his uncle's line, But every winter brought a vast redundancy of· jr.ieze; For that worthy was not one of those who dye and give no sign. 12. Eaeh entptysash groaned dolefuUyas if it thought the przne By some unearthly gram1nerie was coming back again. 6. Well ceiled were all the rooms below (though that's another story), But now our hero's fate was sealed, and not his d()rmitory; When IDidnight played upon his bone$ airs far from operatic, What -wonder that an attic room should make a ma.n rheumatic ? -And many who had been his uncle's custonH~rs of yore, Thought perehanee the youth was not behind what he had been before- Daily stopped his gay barouche to promise pat- ronage enough, And thought their fancy fabricated when be mut- tered \stuff.\ 13. His dandy friends grew fewer, and alas! he found between Their lea1Jing and their falling off no summer intervene;

8 THE OONO:ORDIENSIS. TIJ~ ~o I]Gert. Friday evening, March 22, was a:n. eventful one in the history of student or- ganizations at Union, as it proved beyo1i:l.d the question of a doubt the ability of the • co1lege to put forth a creditable musical . organization, and the possibility of stnl · greater things in the future. A large and representative Schenectady, audience assetnbled in the Van Curler and .. greeted the clubs enthusiastically; an:d nea~r~y every number upon the programme received an encore. The audience -vvas anything but ci~itical, and its good natuTe, which was at all times in evidence, n1ade the singing and playing so easy that the· collegians were surprised at their own success. It was the Glee Club which created such an agreeable surprise, and won for its€1f the hearty praise of students and friends. Organized in the short time that it was, it is remarkable that it could attain such a degr-ee of excellence, and rival the instrn- mental clubs, which are older organiza- tions. The regular programme was as follows: PART I. I. We Meet Again To-Night, - GLEE CLUB. II. El Turia, MANDOLIN CLUB. III. When Birds Will Steal, GLEE CLUB. IV. La Belle Chicago, BANJO CL1J13.

Ainongthe pleasant events that JJrlarked the close of the ]ast term was the 75th anniversary of Dr. Wells' birth, Marek 28. Dr. Wells, has been professor of modern languages and literature at Unjon for thirty ye~r.s, and is honoDed and respected by the many Union men who have come under h·is instruction during that time. Many beautiful floral gifts from faculty and friends bore evidence of the es-teem in which the DoctoT is held. At a n1eet- ing of the student body a :committee was appointed to draft a suitable letter of con- gratulation in honor of the event. D()ctor and Mrs. Wells received their friends on college hill between the hours of four and six, and many availed themselves of this opportunity for tendering their personal congratla tions. The following letter was presented by the students: UNION COLLEGE~ SCHENECT.A.DY, N. Y , March 27, 1895. The students of Union College, learning with pleasure of the approaeh of the seventy-fifth birth- day of their honored instructor, Dr. Willian.1 Wells, wish to tender him their heartfelt congratulations upon this happy occasion; and to express their appreciation of his long and faithful service.st() the College, and their personal regard for him. as a man and as a teacher. They wish him continued years of happiness and prosperity, and renewed strength to pursue the college duties which the past has proved hirn so eminently fitted to perform.

Everything has been said that. can be said in iheir praise, and so it only remains for us to add our congratulations and to encourage them to continue win- ning the lauJ?els which were so easily their's on March 22. It is always more or less ·difficult to place new orga,11izations upon firm found- ations. Ther€ is so much enthusiasm to be aroused, an{l so much prejudice, formed from past failures, to be overcome. The recent concert :proved that th~se difficult- ies have been surmounted, and that music will in the future be as much a feature of student life at Union as athletics. A CRI'riCISM of Manager Allen's action in scheduling a game of base ball with Hamilton was offered at the last college meeting, upon the ground that Hamilton is included in tbe two leagues from which Union voted f;o withdraw. Let it 'be known that the relations be- tween Hamilton and Union are entirely friendly; that Hamilton had no part in the ·disgraceful action of the football REOENT events have again forced us into a discussion as -to what should be Union's attitude toward the colleges com- posing the New York: State Inter-Collegi- ate Base-ball League. It seems that Syra- cuse, acting under the erroneous concep- tion that she has made sufficient amends for her part in the exJrnlsion of Union from the League on. :f!alse charges, asks that a game of football be arranged be- tween the teams of the two colleges to be played on our campus. Syracuse recalls to us the excellent showing made by her team when last it lined up against the garnet, and bases the challenge upon the ground that she is a rival well worthy of our steel. It will be remembered that at a recent college meeting it ·was the unanimous sentiment of the student-body that we withdraw from all leagues with which the colleges of the baseball league were associated, and that Union refuse to enter into any athletic contests with said col- leges until their accusat~ons be proved or an apology tendered. Thus far neither has been done. And while it is true that the attitude of Syra- cuse toward us has been less hostile than that of the other league colleges, never- theless we cannot take, the expression of a few individuals as the authorized senti- ment of that institution. The action of

The annual convention of the American College Republican League was held in Grand Rapids, Mich., on April 5, 6 and 7~ W. G. Brown, Union,' 95, acted as secre- tary of the convention. Mr. Brown is cllair1nan of the third or New York de- partment, president of the local Republi- can club, and a member of the national sub-executive committee. TheN ew York department would have run him for Pres- ident of the League but for his absolute refusal to accept a nomination. ~ The Grand Rapids Herald of April. 7, said: ' ' W. G. Brown, of Union College, N.Y., made a very s.tirring speech on the patriotism of young men to-day. Mr. Brown is a young man of about 25 years of age. He has just graduated from Union College, and is the man who won the two prizes of $50 each given by the l€ague for the best department work, and for the best local college club. FIRST STORY. '' Way back i:n the eighties I played on the 'Varsity, and we had as congenial a crowd as you could find in a day's traveling. Every man could sing a little, and something was decidedly out of gear when the entire crowd. was not ready for a frolic. I remember we took one trip of nine days and played only two gaines, rain preventing the others. There was, of course, lots of thne to be killed, and we had no trouble in doing it. One of the substitutes could squeeze fun out of a board fence: 'Pick's' favorite pastinu' was to get up what he called a 'mash pot.' He would, just before the tean1 boarded a train, .get seven o:r: eight fellows to put in a half dollar apiece and the first man to secure a bona fide 'mash' would capture the pot. lt was a more or less bunco game, as the origina_ tor's dash and cheek gene1·ally won the money; but it was worth a half dollar to see him do it.\ SECOND STORY. Continuing, he said: ''In '84: there was a bitter rivalry between Union and Cornell. One night we struck Ithaca rather late and were met at the station by quite a delegation of Cornellians, who gave us avery warm g·reeting. It quite astonished us, but their 1notive soon.. became apparent,-they were not going to do anything but try and get us all 'full.' Going down to the hotel it was agreed that our dashing substitute should pose as the 'Varsity pitcher; the manager as the' captain, and the scorer as the catcher. In the hotel office they were announced as such, and it was not long before they were among the missing. Along about daylight they rolled in, having feasted all night on the most delicate lunches. Itwaswithdifficulty that we restrained the night porter frorn throwing them out. Between throbs in their heads the next day the trio reported that there had been nothing in the town too goo~ for them, and that it would have been worth their lives to have allowed their entertainers to know that they were not what they represented tl1emselves to be.
