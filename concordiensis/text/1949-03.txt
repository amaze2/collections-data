The Matte~: Is Closed Yesterday afternoon we 1·eceived a four- page manuscript from some members of the Jewish Community Council who had just been to ~ee l\Ir. Davidson. .It was, they said, a statement of their position in the controversy over \The Mer- chant of Venice.\ But it is not included in this week's paper, for it is simply a rehash of a previous statement (The Goncordiensis, Feb. 11, 1949-page 1) , and as such has little news value. If you would care to 1·ead the statement. stop in at the office next week. Zoning Laws Outmoded Once again the residents of l\Iortgage Hill have raised their hands (not their voices- they're too well bred) in protest of encroach- ment by Union College. Last year their objections concemed the Delta Chi fraternit,y, which purchased and occupied one of the monstmsities of Wendell Avenue. Their plea then, as now, was based on outmoded zoning laws which restricted dwetrings in the Wendell Avenue section to single famlies. There was some confusion, naturally, when the Delta Chis discovered that the neighborhood was by no means living up to the letter of the law. For example, there was, and still is, an apartment house dixectly across the st1:eet from the Delta Chi man- sion. At any rate, the Delta Chi case has subsided, and there is every indication that the Mortgage Hillers are willing to back out gracefully. But now the old zoning laws have been dragged out again, this time to prevent Tex Ligon from using the Achilles home on Avon Road for his character research operations. The house was given to the college, and now it appears that Union will be unable to use it for anything connected even vaguely·with education. • The zoning laws applying to the Mortgage Hill area have been outmoded for several years. The wealthy of Schenectady have migrated to the outskirts of the city, leaving Mo1tgage Hill to those who feel that sink- ing their first few thousand dollats m a second-hand, decaying hulk which once be- longed to an old Dorp family somehow ele- vates them from their brethren. One of the Mortgage Hil1ers said at Tues- day's hearing in City Hall that the Avon Road neighborhood is one of the few \high- grade\ neighborhoods left in Schenectady. Now, we ask you, just what the hell does that mean? Another resident of the threatened area professed extreme admiration for college professors, but admitted that he preferred not to have them close to him in large num- bers. Some of his best friends are college pro- fessors, too, presumably. An Exception? Since last September one or two friends have made weekly trips to the office to ask some sort Of editorial rec<>gnition for the Sunday chapel programs. The reasoning has been something like this : The Con- cordiensis was in part responsible for the abolition of chapel points for Sunday ser- vices ; consequently it is up. to The Con- cordiensis to urge students to attend Sun- day chapel regardless of the loss of ppint credit under the Union College Compulsory Culture System.

It Is Rumored By It. A. NAVIAS Summer School Possibilities Checlt 3, oct out tilis form and return it to the registrar's office. Some time ago a report reached us from off cam- pus sources. The effect of the report was that of- ficials of the Ellis Hospital School of Nursing were seriously concerned with the number of student nurses who were failing courses given by Union Col- lege in cooperation with the school of nursing. The report implied that the number of failures was far. above what is normally expected and that the level of instruction in courses given by the colleglEl to stu- dent nurses was not a.II that should be desired. IN SEVERAL interviews with officials of the Ellis Hospital School of Nursing, it was learned that at the time of the report, no one knew the number c·f student nurses taking courses at the college who· would fail. No dissatisfaction over the level of in- struction In college courses taught to the student· nurses was expresse<l. It was felt that the in- structors concerned had done excellent work, and in more than one Instance had devoted much more time outside of class than could reasonably be ex:- . pected. Although the hospital school of nursing is always concerned with student nurse failures, it was in- dicated that the number of failures this year have generally not exceeded those of previous years, Stu- dent nurses, it was pointed out, may fail for reasons other than marks In courses given at the ooUege. Also, standards of acceptance in the school of nurs- ing are quite different from those used by the col- lege, due to the many differences in emphasis of program. HERE, SIMPLY, is another chapter in the old story of what someone told someone else, who in turn told a third . . . And finally after how many repititions no one ltn()WS, the report trickled down to us. No other comment. Ain't It the Truth? If he's brand new at teaching, he lacks experience. If he's been teaching a.II llis life, he's in a rut. If he dresses decently, he's trying to be a fashion plate. If he thinks about something besides clothes, he's a bum.

Note-The following article was written by an off-campus observer who is familiat· with zoning laws and has a wide knowl- t'dge of city planning.) Avon Road and its big-lawned, tree-lined counterparts is typical of a thousand A von Roads extending the length and breadth of the USA. THEY ARE the Fifth Avenues.~~--- the Commonwealth Avenues and all the lesser known boulevards. What is happening to them is only one manifestation of what has .been happening to thP world'!> richest nation. Union College, its 1 neighbors on the periphery of the east campus. and the city's zoning board of ap- peals, last week were caught up in an embarrassing web of circum- stances that must have puzzled many a newspaper reader. The college found on its hands an imposing 20-room house that it could n<lt use, had been unable to sell, but still had to pay taxes on. NEIGHBORS saw the door to their exclusive section open a tiny crack and rushed to slam it shut. They did what almost any other group would have done. and other· influential persons who are searching for the· right answer to a question that will arise again and again as places like the Achilles house are vacated. Some started· thinking about it when Delta Chi Fraternity called the city's hand by moving Into the house on Wendell Avenue. The Avon Road case has only added impetus to the search. PROPERTY OWNERS of the secti<Jn are no doubt perplexed. Their neighborhood is one of two in the city which cost the city the least in services and produce the most in tax revPnUPs. Some own houses much smaller than the Achilles house-houses for which there Is still a very real market so long as the character of the neigh- borhood does not deteriorate. In its revised application, the col- lege sought permission to set up research headquarters for its char- acter research project. This would have resulted in the entry and exit of about 16 persons a day and the parking of -a few cars. SUCH USE is outside the law and the zoning board of appeals had no power to circumvent the law. But at the same time the law permits several uses which would be even more objectionable to near- by residents. Right now the college has a pros- pective buyer in the Greek Ortho- dox Church. This would mean the parking of many cars, an influx of many more people to both ser- vices and church social functions. Still it's legal. Suppose the college sold to a doc- tor or a dentist. Every afternoon would bz ing a steady stream of pa- tients on foot and in automobiles. Stili it's legal. Suppose the college sold to a well-to-do gentleman with eleven children and a hobby of truck gar- dening. It would be legal. THE CITY could build an ele- rrentary school, a high school or a library and it would be within the regulations for single family zon- ing districts.

Letter to the Editor- Youl.' editorial in the March 4th Concordlensis- which sounds as thoug'Q it might have ·been written .by an ill-informed professor~leads a member of tbe Realty Plot Association to challenge you. PRIMARILY, our neighbor Union College sHould be informed of the fact that we of the Realty .Plot Association feel privileged to have the college as our neighbor. Howe-v:er, we also stand firmly on the ground that we do not want our zoning laws changed at this time. If Union College can find a use for the property In question in this area so that it does· not violate the present zoning ordinance, the Realty Plot Association would welcome them. For instance, you protest the action of the board of zoning appeals on the Achilles property recently given to 'C'nion College. As a counter proposal, why not turn over the president's house for the character research operations by Dr. Ligon and have your president live in the Achilles house? This would please everybody, IN YOUR EDITORIAL you have seemingly over- looked the fact that the Delta Chi Fraternity situ- ation is still in the hands of' the court and not some- thing that -has been forgotten or conceded to the fraternity-which incidentally took over a piece of property in defiance of present zoning ordinances. \ You also mention that there Is an apartment house directly across the street from this proposed new location of the fraternity house. Did it .ever occur to you that this apartment house was in operation as such before the zoning law was put into effect and consequently is why this apartment house is situated in its present location? Stated very simply, it is the purpose of the Realty Plot Association to prevent any violations in the future of the zoning ordinance In order to assure that this residential area does not become commer- cial, which it would appear the college is now trying to promote. IN TIDS DAY when taxes enter into everyday · conversation, it might be well to remember that the reason people are going to the outskirts of town is because the resale price even in todays favorable resale. market of properties in this area In excess of assessed valuation-thereby causing excessively high taxes. If through this .,proposed action by the college, values in the Realty Plot were depl'essed, then an additional tax burden would be thrown ·on the City. Since the residents In the Realty Plot are doing more than their share to pay the taxes of the city which the tax free ·college uses, it would seem that the problem is much larger than the Achilles house.

That something is a change in American economy so subtle and so gradual that too many people have allowed the change to go unnoticed. Preventing this deterioration is the single aim of all concerned, in- cluding the city government. The only difference of opinion is in how to .achieve the same purpose. Were residents right in slamming the door shut? the zoning board interpreted the ir~~;;;;;;~;;;;~~~;i~;iij zoning law to mean that the col- . lege cannot use the Achilles house Every year there are fewer fam- ilies who want or can afford the luxury of a 20 or 30 room house. Automobiles now malte it possible for the few who can afford it to retreat to suburban and rural lo- cations. High taxes are cutting deeply into onc!\-big incomes: Do- mestic help is hard to get and costs triple what it used to cost. THE FACT that the city has re- ceived many applications from GE Realty plot residents who would .Jike to turn their houses into apart- ments is an indication that some can no longer afford to live there and maintain single family resi- dences. These applications had to be refused because apa,rtments are not permitted in single fam!iy dis- tricts. ' . ff! . 1 There are some pubhc o c1a s Forget about the zoning law for a moment. Slamming the door is one of two alternatives, and· it rr.eans taking a chance on one of the worst kinds of neighborhood blight: neglected, vacant houses that have no market value and whose unsightliness is a blot visible to the most casual ob- server. IT IS TIDS KIND of blight that planning experts try hard'est to pre- vent. The other alternative is a modi- fication of the zoning law to permit limited use aside from single family occupancr throughout the section. In this way present owners or pur- chasers wouia be given a means of maintaining respectable buildings and grounds by deriving income from their properties. Permission to convert to high-type apartments is one example of limited use. as an adjunct to its library because it is a private. institution. This was a verbal opinion made upon a verbal request by the col- lege at the recent public hearing. The zoning law, however, specific- ally states that public parks and playgrounds are permitted in a single-family zoning district. The same paragraph of the law does not specify that libraries, also per- mitt·ed, must be public. The chairman's verbal opinion, therefore, is subject to seriow; question. It is believed. the college can legally use he Achilles house as an adjunct to its library. A rental library which would ·be, in effect, a business, would be pro- hibited, however. Any law can be changed, and a zoning ordinance should have the greatest possible elruitlcity to keep pace with changing conditions.· SERVING UNION'S .MEN FOR YEARS See Your Own Agint on the Campus for Complete Head to Foot Service UNITED CLEANERS TAILORS Phone 4-5676 114 STATE Near FERRY (Continued on Page 4) IJ::===-=========ar;ll WE KNOW YOU WILL .ALWAYS REMEMBER THE JAY JEWELRY CO.

Bursting f.orth with every ounce $> of its latent ability, the scrappy : 1----~~--~~-----. , I Union College basketball squad closed out its \48-49\ season last Saturday by edging out strong Trinity College by a 72-71 score in the last ten seconds of play at Hartford to bring their record for the season to 9-8. A Fitting Farewell Unic·n Co-Captalr.s Jim Pemrick and Bill Grant, putting in their last appearance for the Garnet, wrote a brilliant end to their bas- ketball careers. Grant was the hero· of the night, as he sank a long shot from mid-court in the last r·ernaining seconds to sew up the game. Pemric.k, one of the best basketballers ever to represent the Dutchmen, took scoring hon-o•rs for the night along with Trinity's Bill Pitkin, by dropping 23 points through the hoop, and played his renown·ed fine defensive game, as he has done all season. This final scoring burst gave Pe,!Ilrick an average of 16 points per game for the season, and in the last four games he has averag.ed 20. Pemrick Lead$ Scoring The Union squad displayed a tremendous power in their last four games of the season, downing four of the strongest teams on their schedule: Stevens, Hamilton, RPI, and Trinity. Lacking height in all their games, the Garnet made up in this department by their scrappiness. Brilliant Jim Pemrick led the Dutchmen in scoring for the sea- son by dropping in 272 points, a 16 point per game average, and was followed closely by Dick Speidel, who scored 202 points fo1· a 11.9 point per game average. For the season, the Garnet was outscored by their opponents by one pc•int, 955 to 954. From the foul line the hoopsters converted 250 out of 349 trys for a 71.6% mark. Union had 390 fouls called against them for. the 17 game slate. 352 field goals were converted. Trinity Game The first half of the Trinity game was hotly contested, with Pemrick and Curtin of Trinity fighting an individual \pivot-shot\ battle between themselves. The lead changed hands six t~mes be- fore the half eft'ded in a 34-34: deadlock. The Hilltopper's high-scoring combination of Pitkin and Curtin opened up at the beginning of the second half, and after 5 minutes Trinity led by 12 points. With three minutes of the game left, Grant, Speidel, and Davis hit tl:ie hoop • II SLACKS TROUSERS • • Ill • 1,000 Pairs to Pick From • • • • • ROCHESTER. .r PANTS STORE • 412 STATE ST. - Upstairs • •••••••••••••• SEASON RECORD Union. 39 Union 56 Union 55 Union 55 Union 53 Union 45 Union 62 Union 45 Union 70 Union 61 Union 47 Union 47 Union 66 Union 63 Union M Union 64 Union 72 Vermont Wesleyan B.P.I .

Dick Rob- erts, then recc·vered the ball off the backboard and dropped it through the nets to give Union a 70-69 lead as the 1500 spectators were brought to their feet.

Waldron, sem·etary emeritus of the Graduate Counc'il, spoke in Memorial Chapel Tuesday, March 22,. on the subject \Athletics at Union.\ THE FIRST INTERCOLLEGI- ATE SPORT e11gaged in by Union. said Mr. Waldron, was rowing, which in the 1870's was as popular as football today. In those days, big and small colleges as classed today were practically on an equal footing in the field of sports. It v. as following one of these rowing meets that Union adopted garnet as one of its colors. Before that 'tiJ::te, both Union an!J Harvard were identified at their athletic meets by magenta. As this led to confusion when the two happened to appear together, Harvard complained and Union agreed to change to garnet. :Harvard, however, also changed to their famous crimson. TRACK .

PRICE 10 CENTS Elections for Class Presidents, Council Members Scheduled Elections for three class presidents and fifteen student council membei·s will be held during the last two weeks in April, John De Bello, chairman of the student council elec- tions committee has a1mounced. Nominating petitions for these offices will be accepted in the Student Activities Olfice from Wednesday, March .30, to Wednesday, April 6. Gift Fund Jumps to $160,000 The Alumni Gift Fund has reached the $160,000 mark, accord- ing to Mr. Harold M. Van de Carr, Union College director of financial ·development. Of this amount, Mr. Van de Carr said, approximately $130,000 is earmarked for construc- tion .of the War Memorial Field House. It is 'hoped that the cam- paign will reach the $200,000 before commencement this year. Contri- butions to date have come from 1919 donors, including 1229 alumni, 600 students, and 33 friends. THE $500,000 DRIVE, Van de Carr said, has led to personal con- tacts with about 1600 alumni, or about 20% of all living alumni. This is an average contribution of about $84. Mr. Van de Carr said that if contributions continue at the P!'esent rate, the three-year fund raising drive will more than top the goal set for'\ it. Van de Carr said that he is very favorably impt essed by the results of the campaign .so far, and that it is the largest fund raising drive ever undertaken by Union alumni. The top class contributi<Jns are, first, the Class of 1912, 17 . out of 84 members contributing a total of $4,902; second, the Class of 1942, out of 160 mei:nbets contributing $4,215; and third, the Class of 1901, with four out of 24 members (!on- tributing $3,925. IFC Hears Reports At the Interfraternity Council meeting held Tuesday, March 22, several fraternities expressed ap- proval of the $2.25 assessment of each fraternity member for the rathsl1eller fund. In the majority of instances however, contributior.s will be up to the individuals. I'r lS AJ.,.SO ~EPORTED that an agrffement has been reached by members of the council with the comptroller's office concerning the renting of d01 mitory roorr s and payment for them when not needed. In the future, men will sign up for rooms before December 17 and will be notified of their assignments prior to January 8. If a reserva- tion is cancelled before January 8 there will be no charg~, but after that date and until January 14, cancellation will cost $10. After January 14, full room rent will be due. The proposed new rules for rush- ing in the fall of 1949 were adopted at the meeting. Under the new system, rushing of new students will' commence September 15 and continue throug·h October 14. The final figures on the net pro- fit from the Fire Dance were pre- sented. The members of Phi Delta Theta were thii beneficiaries of $732.12. --~o--- Bd. of Managers At the meeting of the board of managers on Monday, March 21, a committee was· appointed to con- sider the problem of facility ad- vis<Jrs and to fot•mulate a general policy concerning their relation- ships with student activities. Henry ·Ferguson was appointed chairman of a group to publicize the various college activities, with the object of interesting the Incoming freshmen. P R E S I D E N T S OF the classes of 1950, 1951, and 1952 will be elected by sec1·et ballot Wednesday noon, April 20, during a student body meeting to be held in Mem- orial Chapel. Voting for stu- dent council members will take place in Silliman Hall Tuesday, April 26, and Wed- nesday, April 27, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Each student will vote for five student council repre- sentatives of his own class. A student will be eligible to vote after presenting suitable iden- tification and signing a vot- ing list. - REPEATING IN GENERAL the plan first used last year, the elec- tions comrr.ittee has announced that campagining will again be featured in regular chapel pro· grams during the week of April 18. Last year the electioneering, which ran from the sedate to the ridiculous, helped to focus much at- tention on the elections, De Bello noted. ·Seventy percent of the stu- dent body voted last April, as com- pared to small interest in election pt•oceeding in previous years. Nominaj:ing petitkns require the name of the candidate, the office he seeks, information about his college activities, and the signatures of fifteen members of his class. These petitions ate to be submitted to the Student Activities Office in Wash- burn Hall, the mail slot to be used if the door ls locked. The dead- line is April 6 at 4:30. A student rray run for both president and councilman simultaneously, but a petition must be presented for each office. Election to a class presi- dency will automatically remove the student's name from the list of council candidates. THE EI.EOTION s c h e d u I e designates the week following spring recess for c am p a i g n speeches during daily chapel. These chapel programs will give the usual credits. Mo-nday, Tuesday, and Thursday have been alloted to the Classes of 1952, 1951, and 1950, re- spectively. Friday will be used f.Qr those candidates who were unabie to appear the preceding days. · De Bello also stated that poll- tical parties will again be allowed. Last year, the Telahpile party polled 24':} of the votes and the Representative party 12%. The Action party, which also nominated candidates for last year's election, was recentlr dissolved. Dormitory Maid Robbed The Union College sneak thief has struck again. The latest vic- tim of this phantom looter is Mrs. Martha Dueslar. a maid in Beaver Lodge. Mrs. Dueslar reported the theft of twenty dollars in bills from her purse during the morning of .Saturday, March 19. THE MONEY was talten from Mrs. Dueslar's purse when it was left in the maids' room in Beaver Lodge sorretime during the morn- ing. Mrs. Dueslar said she returned to the maids' room around eleven o'clock and found het• purse o-pen and the money missing. Campus policeman Clarence Willette said that no clues have been found. This theft is the latest in a long set•ies of sneak thefts, and has peen called \the meanest sort of crime.\ The Chi Psi fraternity ho\Jse wa.s looted of fifty dollars during th.e night of December 17, 1948.

For the warm weather we suggest cold beer. \Ve throw up to you the shoddy condition of the campus and suggest spring· cleaning. It is a pitty that the RPI bruises left upon Payne Gate last fall should still be marring the campus, It is a pity that men find it neces- sary to trod across young grass to save several seconds time and thereby make blots upon the appearance of our lawns. Our campus is none too attractive anyway with the pasture being used for a parking lot, with the temporm·y housing facilities sticking out like a sore thumb, with the need for large amounts of space for student and faculty cars, and the signs which finger toward the areas where you may park. Before the war our campus had quite a reputation for its looks. We cannot have that reputation again while the emergency creates an overflow on campus, but we do not have to let the campus deteriorate. By not walking across the lawns, by removing all remnants of past battles, by being careful about tossing paper around, we can at least feel that we've done everything we could to improve the appearance of the campus. Know Your Leaders We are interested in seeing that the mem- bers of the present student council who have proven themselves to be dead weight during the past year are not re-elected in the April elections. \Ve also want to see the men who have done a good job back on tlie council next year. At present, several reporters on the staff are examining the record of each in- dividual member of the council during the past year. We will come out with the facts at election time. Meanwhile, we hope that you will also check the activities of your representatives during the year and sign petitions only for men who are capable. Let's get out of the habit of signing petitions for friends unless they really have the ability and the interest to do a good job. If we can raise the caliber of the men nominated for council jobs, it will make the job of voting for the proper men easier. The Reader Writes Dear Editor: I was one of many people greatly impressed by seeing \The Red Shoes,\ and when it was an. nounced that the Ballet Russe was coming to town, my joy knew no bounds. I dashed downtown and bought a ticket. For a week I could hardly contain myself with expectancy and last night, with a lusty \Hot Damn!\ I literally skipped downtown and sat with bated breath, waiting for the curtain. ALAS, I am an embittered and disillusioned man. The three dances would have been delightful to watch, had they been performed by a cQompetent company, but the dancers were woefully lacking in skill. I don't believe the Ballet Russe played fair with Schenectady, Returning after a few years' absence, they might at least have given us a decent company. Quite obviously, the people of the city were very anxious to see a ballet, and having been given a second-rate performance, they will prove extremely balky at paying $2.40 and $3.00 next year unless guaranteed a much better troupe. I certainly shall. WALTER A.

Hamilton stecrted playing la- crosse two years ago, and although Union has never scheduled them in an official game, Union has gone to Clinton and trounced the Con- tinentals in exhibition games both years. With two seasons under their belt, the Blue and White don't figure to be as easy a push- over as they previously were.
