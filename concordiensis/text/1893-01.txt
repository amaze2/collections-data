If you take a proper stand, assun1e the di-gnified sentiments and deportn1ent which becon1c you, search your own rninds, and shape out for vourselves a laudable course of conduct, you .. \vill proba~bly go through life \Vith the san1.c dignity, achieve success, and cxcr):ise ai1 influence over your fello\v-n1en. But if you spend this year in i ndolencc, or stoop to lo\\\ n1ean and dirty conduct, it is probable you will continue dirty, n1can and Jo\v \vhilc you live. The class which last graduated fron1 this college \Vas rcn1arkablc for the dignity and excellent character which its n1c1nbcrs n1aintain-ed · through their college course. Although they \Verc in no 'vise rernarkable for their talents, yet n1en have gone out ~nto the world fron1 that class who ·will he great and successful and reno\vncd, and exert no s1nall influence upon their fellows, and this in consequence of the tnanner in which they spent their Senior year at lJnion College.\ Atnong the 1nen1bers of that class of 1828 ' of \vhich Dr. Nott uttered this con1plin1ent Gtnd prediction, \Vere FiotL l-Iorace Dresser, LL.D.; J udgc Elijah Ford and Judge David II.

In one of his early lectures of the terrn the President gives his boys son1c good advice as to how to read : \ 'l'hc one grand object of all reading is cto 111akc n1en think. And this is best accon1p- lishcd by going frcq ucn tly over the san1e \Vork. It is better to choose sotne favorite author, to keep in your study constantly, and 1~cad hin1 over and over again. \Vhcther you choose I-I on1cr or Virgi 1 or J)ctnosthenes, or son1c English author, it 1natters not.
