Each of the teams made a double play, both from the shortst.Jp to <;!:le iirst base- man. The Scarlet and Black had difficulty in the box, three men behig succes- sively tried, but to no avail. The first pitcher was quickly hammered out of the box. In the first inning he gave three hits, walked ope and allowed four runs with but 011e out, a sacrifice fly. Kelly was brought in from the .field and Duffy taken off the bench to take his place. Kelly lasted a little longer than the one he succeeded, fin- ishing up the third inning, when the score had reached 12 to 4. In the rest of the game Rutgers used Whee- lock in pitch and Kelly in the field and each team scored but one more run. Union lost one of its mns when B'artley failed to touch third in mak- ing a fast round of the bases and the third baseman called for the ball. The last pitcher for Rutgers. Wheelock, seemed to be a jinx for Jack Reynolds, fanning him both times he was up, the only two times he fanned this seasop.

They were followed by the sophomores, who marched out with military precision, and gave their S};lec- ial class and college song. The jun- ior song br<Jught down the unanimous decision of the judges of the Fitzhugh Ludlow contest cup. The individual Ludlow cup was awarded to Edgar William Snell, the author of the song.

Prohibition seemed to take first place for furnishing material for the vari- ous tableaux. When the sophomore stunt took place, a line of white hoeads was seen far away at the opposite side of the field.

G n General Office Schenectady.NX: Utilizing Nature's Power E LECTRICAL energy generated by water power has grown to be one of our greatest natural resources- and we have only begun to reach its possibilities. It mines and refines our ores, turns the wheels of industry, drives our street cars and lights our cities and towns. The power obtained from Nature saves many million tons of coal every year. At first the field of its utilization was limited by the dis .. tance electricity could be transported. But soon research and engineering skill pointed the way to larger and better electrical apparatus necessary for high-voltage trans- mission. Then ingenious devices were invented to insure protection against lightning! short-circuits, etc., which cause damage and interrupt the service. And now all over the country a network of wires begins to appear, carry- ing the magic power. The General Electric Company, with its many years' ex- perience, has played a great part in hydro-electric develop- ment. By successfully co-ordinating the inventive genius of the company and its engineering and manufacturing abilities, it has accomplished some of the greatest achieve- ments in the production and applicanon of electrical energy. The old mill wheel of yesterday has gone. Today the forces of immense volumes of water are harnessed and sent miles away to supply the needs of industry and business and the comforts of the home. tric Sales Offices in all large cities. so-1asu

Utilizing Nature's Power E I,.ECTRICAL energy generated by water power has grown to be one of our greatest natural resources- and we have only begun to reach its possibilities. It mines and refines our ores, turns the wheels of industry, drives our street cars and lights our cities and towns. The power obtained from Nature saves many million tons of coal every year. At first the field of its utilization was limited by the dis.- tance electricity could be transported. But soon resear~b and engineering skill pointed the way to larger and better electrical apparatus necessary for high-voltage trans- mission. Then ingenious devices were invented to insure protection against lightning, short-circuits, etc., which cause damage. and interrupt the service. And now all Qver the country a network of wires begins to appear, carry- ing the magic power. The General Electric Company, with its many years' ex- perience, has played a great part in hydro-electric develop~ ment. By successfully co-ordinating the inventive genius of the company and its engineering and manufacturing abilities, it has accomplished some of the greatest achieve- ments in the production and application of electricl¥ energy.
