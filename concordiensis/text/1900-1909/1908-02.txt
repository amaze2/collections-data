~--------------------------~------------------------------------------~----~----+N-~------w=---=--~ CoNcoRDIENSIS V'OL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 4, 1908 1\. T 12· L YO. Jt WHY STUDY GREEI{? Prof. John L Bennett \W·hat is the use of .studying Greek?\ This h::i. 3 question that every professor of G-reek i:s asked ntore t'han on·ce in the eourse of a lHetilne. At lt::1st OJ;:te ·n.~em·ber of the guHd alwa vs ~UlclWe~'s, ''Non·e;\ .fo1:~ tifl.e question tfi.us put is not fo1· in- forination; it is rhetorical and n1eans, ''There i;::> no use in studying- Greek.\ And what ia the use of arguing with a n1an who has nutdG up his 1nind past budging befo-re the argn·ment begins<) N·one. But an apter reply, perha,)s, would 1)(~ the retort inteTro:gative. What i3 the use of taking a bath? Con1paratively few, take the race by and lar.;;e, ever do. What is the use .of con11Jing your hair? Many do not and, in the last analysiB, it is a vain and ornate affectation. What is the use of wearing clothes? Ada-n1 ·didn't. What is the use Qf k:ntves and .forks? FingeTs were 1nacle before both. vVhat is the use of ·building honse.;;? Holes in the ground would serve, an.d h1ve seTv~d. V\.:hat iB the use of p·oety? \¥\lords wor·1.s, .words.\ W:hat is the use of 1nusic? ::.V1ere sound. Vv'hat is the use of staueB and paiatings? Fig- ·m.e·nts ·of the ilnagination expressed in ptgn1ents and 1narble. W\hat is the use of religion? You can't eat it, you can't .drink it, you can't buy it, you ean't sell it, you -can't wear it--except in- Bide. In brief, what is the use {)f anything that h; very ·much wo-rth while? Why, if you will have it so, none. But neveT since the prim.al adoTning in Para- dise has n1an ,been willing to lead the unadorned life. He has come to prefer the life beautiful il1 t'he very wid·est sense of the tern1. He has g1 own into his -clothes and nouses, aud up to his knives and forks and .bath.:; and poetry and music and statues and ·Dictures and religion; and, to ten the tru ~h,. he rather likes then1 all. He finds t:D.at they n1ake life not 'Inerely tolerable, but a very fine thing-·quite the finest that he h:nows a;tyt'hing about; so fine, .in fact. tha: he f,Olldl.\T ho)les it .will last forever. He tbetsforc likes ·everything that mal\es life fuller a:1d. richer and, having found any such thing, he can.not wiUingly let it go. ''VVhy study Greek? vVhy not? The G~l'eek~ we.re bey.o~ld question the 1nost gif. ed race the world has ever seen, the greatest adorners and e.1 ric'hers of life, artists in all the aTts and a.rtists i~~ living. They were the first to look fearlessly straight out at ~he world and ask what it was, \>vhat it ha·d to say for itself. They were the first tn Ioo1\ straight into 1nan and a.sk him what he was, what account he could give of hin1self. They arriv·ed at a fundan1e~1tal conclusion :hat the world ls a cos,n1os, an orderly creation; and that man is a. ·eosmos, too, or as their proverb 11ut it, \a little COS'il10S in the great COS1110S.\ They therefore believed that whatever exists, eitl1er in ·.he great co.sn1os or in the little one, must be accounted for. ~o partial views of the universe would have contented then1-n1uch less of n1an; man was an aggregate of n1any l)arts; none of ~hen:1 ·could he: iginored; right life v'{as the r-ight blending and expression of all these 'parts. This was sane. Arriving at thiB .pren1ise, the GI·eeks grappled ·with every problen1 of hun1an life- many of the .specific problen1s of science and many of tfiose incident to an industrial civiliza- tion had not as yet co·nle to their first s tate1nent -and they 1nogressed far toward a so-lution of most of then1. 'T'heir solutions were often too concrete but always intelligible, ·seldmn s·upe·r- ficial, and usually surprisingly brilliant. They asked and answered, as best they cou}d in the light of what knowledge they had ga.t1lt;Jred, the great questions of the he<re a.nd the hereafter. They stated and answered the problems of poli· tics and govern1nent and the answe-rs were -pro- found enough to interest n1en of all ·.::lnbsequent times. They stated a11'd answered with equal bril- liancy the problen1s ·Of ethics, and thPir answers, though tentative, were in the right direction;

'i I '. ! l i 6 THE CONCORDIENSIS they were based upon .aa analysis of nature and for the G·reeks, in .a greater d~gree 1pemaps th:an hu·man nature. And tbe:y gave beautiful expres- any other ra:ce, had a. disti·nct and vigorous racial si:on to their view of ri:fie, not 0nly in their insti- genius; they were a ''.pecuUar pe.ople.\ Tile ap- tutions but also in thei'·r works of art. Without n1odels-at least without any that .perrnanently or even ·considerably i:nfluen .. ced the.m-· t'hey .cre- ated an archite·eture flJ.e, ·most perfect that the world has seen in ~chaste an.d tem1perate beauty; this architecture as a wih.ole and in its ·details L~ a final contributi-on io the rich in'heritance of mankind, \a posseBsioll f·o:reve.r.\ With no mod- ·els to which they long adhered they created a sculrpture whi·ch is s Ull the synony•ln of perfe-c- tion in the sculptor's ar-t. Who tilat has gone throug 1 h any o·f the grea:t 1nuseums of Europe has not felt the sweet repose of ,coming fron1 the whin1sica1 or ·often brin:ia~lt individualitie·s of the 1n·odern s:culptor into N1e ·calm and masterful self- possession of the Greek ro·om, where e·ccentricity i::; ca.st aside f.or the .pe:rfe:ct typ·e. \These 1 men,\ the .traveler says, \kne~ ·wiftat they wanted; and they fo·und it.\ Quite wiH1out ·models-and this no other race ever did_,th.ey created a great lit- eTature, eo.m,plete in alil itB forms, in many of them unsurpassed, in sone ·of the1n still un- equalled. Beyond all quesUon no race can ex- hibit so co-mplete a caJaJo,gue of writers of the first rank in poetry anCI ilelles-lettres as the Greeks; and the great :Greek hooks are still as dire·ct and .freBh and vigorous as t·hey ever we·re; they ·came from life and. they ib.ave life eternal. 1~·0 turn f'rO'm the ingenuities and vapidities of a great part .of m,odern V€r:se and the femininity of the bulk of rmodern :ficti(i)n tto the virile, elemental narratives of HorneT ts like stepping from a hot- house int·o the. fresh air. A hothouse is a pretty pla.ce, but not to live in, and the ·cyclamen flower is 'better ·On a Greek 'illO·untainside than it is in an eart·hen 1pot. As a :final ·co:unt in a hrief and inadequate swm,m.ary, it is worth remenl.bering that the ChriBUan reHglon was diffused la-rgely through the Greek world, the Greek ·mind a-nd the Greek Ian.2:uage. \Why study Greek?\ J3ecause it is eminently wo-rth while, and for uo !()the·r reas,on. G:re.ek like· ·music and .art and S'hal\;espeare and the Bible, .is one of th·ose useless th1n.gs that are more useful than anything that is u;se.ful because they give life and give it •more aJ.)undantly. And G-reek ranks high a:mo·ng these treasures incorruptible, plicaUons of this ·r.a.cial genius are especially Ulurninating because the genius ·was a.ppUed to a simpler world taan ours. In consequence, the best work of the ·Greeks, whether in their insti- tutions o'r in the arts., has a rmnarkable ·clear- ness of outline; in fts sum total it is a very distinct and affirmati¥e contribution to the pro- gressive search for truth. And by virtue of its silnplicity and its ·elea rness o·f outline it 1nakes a strong appeal to ·our intelligence. For the Greeks ;were on the right road. Their n1ethod was inquiry, their ain.IJ. to understand and ex- •Press. In a ;marked ·degree they were skillful in t:hek 1nethod; thei... :ai·ID, in the art~ at least, was true and they hJt the tm:ark. Furthe:rmore, the solutions of the f:uture will ·be worked out along the lines laid dorwn ~.Y the Greeks and not 1by departing from then. We have strayed too long and too ·far. 'T·be world is turning back in its modes of thoug'ht a1td i:s nearer the view of the Greeks than it ev€r has been since their U.me. vVith fa1· greater kno·wledge than they posse::r.sed, es·pecially in science, we have taken up their .n1ethod, inquiry, and their ain1, to understand and express; and we shall succeed in ·both far better than they did. We are no longer, as Newton thought he ·Was, like children gathering pe.bbles on the beach while the g·reat ocean of truth lies before us; we are actually sail'ing that ocean with chart and con111~aB.s and we are beginning- to know our ports. Wlh.en ·we get the wh·ole ocean n1apped out we S·llall still reverence the Greeks a.:; the pioneer voyagers. \But ·can I not,\ you ·Will ask, \learn to under- stand the Greeks through 'histories and treatises .and translations?\ To a considerable extent. T·he his•tories and treatises are g·ood; but a goO'd translation is ahout as rare as t·he Phoenix. Translation is an exa.cting art and few attain to great ex,cellence :in H. Most translations are bald and unidio·matic, leaving t'he i•m.pression that tbe Greeks wrote very bad G-reek or at least pro- voked very ba:d E'ngU.sb; ·othe'rs are artificial and ~cholastic like the Lang translations ·of Hon1er; tbese are re1nark~ble .as tours de fo-rce of S·Ch·olars and literary men, but they are not Hom:er and they are not .~nglish. Only now a.nd then does

THE ·CONCORDIENSIS a translation come t·o be counted among EngUsh ·classics, like Jo.wett'.s translation of Plato; for \n1any bear the fennel-rod, ·but few are real vo- taries.\ \But in any case,\ you will ::;ay, \are not the transla~ions ·better than I can make?'' Very likely, but anybody that 1 has ever ·seriously studied any ·Othe·r language than his o-wn knows that he begins to be on better ter1ns with a people as s·oon as he learns thei'r alpha. \bet; at all events., the language of any race i'hat has achieved .great things will continue to be studied so long as the achievements of that raee are valued. \:Shall I not forget all 1ny Greek if I do it?\ Y.ou will foTget your n1other if you do not get well en·ough acquainted with her to re·member \h;:-r. Few stude11ts get a strong enough grip on any study to hold ·fast to a very considerable resi- duum ·of exa.ct knowledge; few that do get a fair g1ip keep it. A constant .quantity of knowledge in G1·eek or any thing e1se means a frequent re- newal of study or Fractice. But 1110s~. ·persons that have forgotten their Greek never really kllew any. Show ~me the .n1an who says that ·he has forgotten his Greek mo:re completely than I have n1y analytical geornetry and I will show l.1i1n that he has no~. I never· knew any; I just took it. I suspect, however, that no student, having once becon1e n1oderately wen acquainted with Hon1er, :has quite forgotten what Homer's poetry i.3 like; and I am further ·Of the opiniDn that this k.:-towledge is w•orth acquiring and retaining. As regards the somewhat extrane·ous n1oti ves for studying Greek-such as :the training of the mind, the enrich .. n1ent of our Tesources in the use of our own language, and so forth-I ~have little to say. Greek will or will not do the.se things ac-c·ording to the way in ·whieh it is taught and .studied; for it is a nice instrument and 1nust be n .. cely handled. Besides, the plaintiff-or as I si1 ould pTe fer to call him, the defendant-can n1ake otlt a good case here. Ot11er studies afford a cmn}Jlete training foT the 1nind. The proper s':udy of English is English; if we ·becan1e falnil- iar in our youth with smne ·Of the great books of o·u-r language as the Greeks did with smne of the great books of theirs, our English would very well take care of itself; nor have I ever noticed L1at a knowledge of Greek necessarily implies a peculiar feUcity in the tise .of English. But if the plaintiff pTopoBes to bring forward any study that uas the precise virtues of Greek and all of them, he can no ·more do that than he can bring for- , ·ward any one p·oet that shall take the plRce o~ Shakespeare. Greek is Greek; there is no Greek ·but Greek and Greek is its prow.het. I am not, however, in fav-or of anybody's being co1npelled to study it. I think it regrettable that some study it. who have no aptitude fm~ it. I think it more regre~table that .many who 1 have an aptitud·e for it and would profit by it do no't .study it. If you do not care for it, gentle reader, that is your affair; .1Jut you are .pTobably no better qualified to call my vocation usel!ess than I yours. ''In brief, sir, study what y·ou 1nost a:t\Eect.\ But ren1ember: \The best is the best, though a hundred judges have declared it so.\ n·R. CADY'S FIFTH LECTURE Last Friday Rev. Putnaru. Cady gg,ve the fifth o[ his popular lectures ·On archaeological di~cov­ eries. His therne was \Portrait Sculpture and Tomb Decoration.\ Aa iten1 tha•t was of particular interest was the f~1et that Dr. Cady had rwith him an embalmed crow wfiich he had ·found in sotne Egyptian ruins. It was a good example of the wonderful skill in embalming, which the early Egy·ptians posessed. The lectuTe was ·so impres.sive and portrayed the marvels of Egy·pt ·SO well that the whole audience was inclined •to believe with Dr. Cady the saying of Hero·dotus, \Egypt possesses more wonders than all the rest of the world together.\ Ti1e large attend·ance both of students and ·Of ontsi·de friends wa·::; encouraging. T·he whole series of lectur€s is proving to be vel'y helpful and interesting, and ·one which the student body ·can ill afford to 111iss . Fifty .per cent. o.f Harvard's students are Massachusetts, .a decrease of one-half 'Per from last year. The representati-on fron1 fl~0111 cent. New York Sta~e is fourteen per cent. of the total Teg- istration. The nun1ber of foreign students at ·Columbia l&Bt year was 4.27 per .cent. of the whole regis- tration, as eom·:pared with 1:56 per .cent. in 1901- 02.

But a fe·w days since and. in these halla .. his voice was wont to ec·ho and reverberate; within our gloriou8 library it was wont to create an uproar and Hsturb the reade\rs; bnt now it is gone. N·o longer S'~1all we beholr1 bin1 tenderly receiving ou1~ grateful ·offerings at registraUon day. ~ 0 longer will he .out of the fullness of his heart .benevolently assimilate a two doHar bill for the privilege of flunking a c·ondiU.onal exa1n.

No longer will we see hi'ln strutting ov·er the can 1 pus ·with a Pittsb-urg stogey thruRt between his :patient lips. Alas! who nnw will see that the steam p-ipes do not Je,ak?

Verily, we are not sure but that he would :i.la,ve ta~pped us fo.r the air we breathed and made us pay ve·w rent for cha:pei attendance had he re1nained. For S\uch was his dev·otion to his ideal -oi swelling the treasury t'hat no one C·ould attend the college and yet be burdened with ca'S,h. But though he is with us no ~more in body, he is ever with us tn spirt. H·e includes ·us in his prayeTs a.t night. Ever his 1p:ious heart is pray- ing for the ·college, the burden of W 1 hose affairs rested so heavily on hi1n, and whose love wa·s 1nanifested in a certain yellow house. We will n-ot dwell too long upon the virtues o·f this man. :\Ien of his stan1p require the des.cri>ptive powers o: a Vergil or a Dante. Eno·ug'h it is to say that 'his kindly, quiet, unassu1ning, \taking'' ways have left a ·deep inl'PI'ession iupon -our minds and pocketbooks, and a.n1ong the costliest me·n1ories o: our college life, will :be treasured those sacre-d ·moments wu1en we were permitted to live and learn ·o·.f him.

Albany, on the evening of Wednesday, January 28, th~s being the date of •the anniversary of his birth. The celebration wa.s observed under the aus- pices of th.e Law Department o·f Union Unversity, fr·oln whic'h Mr. M·cKinley graduated in 1867. No effort was 'S•pa.red to 1nake t·he oceasion a great success. A p·ressing invitati-on was extf:nd8d to tbe college •to attend, and three special car·s were chartered to provide free trans•portation.. Over a hundTed fr01n1 the acaden1ic depa.rtment -attended, •but the num•ber was not as la·rge as expected or as the affair deserved .. Hon. Amasa J. Parker, LL. D., pTesident of the Board o.f 'Trus•tees of the Law .s.cbool, presided over the n1ee~ing. 'On the 1p.Jatform were seated 1nany Gf fhe faculty •of the La.w Departlnent and ·of the college. Our fa.culty w.as ·represented by Dean Ripton and Pra.fess.ors BaTne:s, Hoffman, Hale and M·cKean. All the ushers and tho·se ·Who occupied seats on the :s,bage wore ·carnations, President M:cKinley's favorite flo-wer. The exercises .opened ·with !prayer ·by Rev. Ed.gar H. Brown, D. D., Beecher C. Burton, Al- 'bany Law School, class '09, ·sang two 'Solos, \Lead Kindly Light\ and \Nea1·er My God to Thee,\ the n1artyr President's favorite hy.mns. Dr. Parker introduced H·on. Andrew S. Draper, Com.n1issione·r of Educ.ation .of New York State, as the ·or.a·tar of the evening. Dr. Draper deliv- e:red a splendid and for.ceful ·C01n1nen1-or.ative address. He gave a 'I'eview o·f President McKin- ley's life and .paid fitting tribute to his great per- s-onality, s~peaking ·feelingly of the ilrstitution which had :sent so ·m.any n.oble n1en into life's battle, and ·referring :to Mr. M·cKinley as the :great- est son of Albany Law S:chool. In spea.king of the bel:ove-d President Dr. Dra- per said: \The higD.est res!ponsibility and •the seveTes t trial proved the n1ettle -of which the •man was n1ade. There w·a:s no taint of uncleanness in hi:m. He :was a 1nember of the Methodist Epis- copal Church and lhis administration never di·s- eredited ihis pr,ofession. He had no faults which did not .melt .away in the sunshine of his ·manly life. And in closing: \It is rwell .for us to pon- der over such a life, and fitting that the law school of McKinley, on the anniversary of his birth, should ~call 1 the attention ·of its me~m·bers and of the f'riends ·of tifie University to his e•mi- nent ca:reer.\ :Great entihusias·m was dis1played thToughout the 1neeting. The name of M·cKinl.ey ·was g-reeted with :hearty cheers, ·and Dr. Dra;per'.s speech wa·.:; followed by pr·olonged ap:plause. LE~CTURE BY PROF. GIDDINGS Last Tuesday evening Pro:f. Franklin H. Gid- dings le•ctlued to a large .audience in the Y. M. C. A. Dr. Giddings is a Union gradttate, class of '76, and is now head of the de.partnient of s-ocio~­ ogy at Go1u·n1·bia College. His topic was \Q .So~ci·ology,\ .and during t'he discussion he showe•d the methods used in qHantitative so·ciolog·y and how they are of practical use to people in everyday Ufe. The three pTincipal n1ethod·s that he deseri-bed were: Probability curve, index numbers and index of c.:h-oice, and he gave .. practi-cal ·results of the e·m- ployment of the.:le three methods. In the course of the lecture he made a state- n1ent ~o tlhe effe·ct that the only way that ·we csn have and retain a republican form of g·overnment i::; to restrict i·m·ln·igration, and that if we try to assimilate all the people that are con1ing to our shores, we will in a sho-rt time, ~1av-e a gov- ernn1ent that •may be rightly termed a Ro·man E·mlpire. In regard to the recent finanial distre.ss he said that the ;men •who studied scientifically the money systen1 were not .caught unawareB, but instead were able to see it long ~beforehand. In closing he desired to ·e·mphasize the .point that many of t:1e. evils in social life could be ·changed through the scientific study of 'SDcial proble1ns by these different .me:thods.

If it would be a.ctively represented in civic 'Politics and impress itself upon the co•mm!.uni ty as the national parties do, it m!llst have its own agency of expres.sion. It is because ·of thoroug-h organization and discipline that the national party can afford to ignore the coniScience of the ·com'm11nity and to ride rough- shod over its supplkati0ns ·and ·protests.

THE CONCORDIENSIS :7 OUR TRACK 'SITUATION Union's Prospects Summarized by an Athlete- ·Hard Work Is Necessary !vV)ith the basket 'hall season finally brightening up a little, it is tim~2 to .begin to turn attention to the tra,ck situation. To start with, Union is sched- uled to participate in a one-mile relay race in Troy on the 26th of this month. From all ·appe::tr- ances however 'but little work toward successfu:l1y ' ' com:peting at that time has been done. Captain Parsons has several times issued calls in chav~l meeting for fandirlates f01' the team, but as yet none of the harcl, gruelling work that must 11reced0 the running ·Of the quarter mile has been done. part in .a sort of a secondary meet with Hamilton., 1 o gather up the odds and ends left over by the first two team,s. The .spirit of Old Union, that formerly sent so many winning team1s into the field seems to be I.ack- ing entirely in track work at present, and its re- Yival is the only thing that can save us from an overwhelming defeat at Rochester this year. If this SIJirit is only dormant, it can only be awak- E'ned by every 1nan con,s-tituting himself int{) a ll~rsonal alarn1 clock and waking Hp his share of it. The reg-istered candidates for the team are nf personal ability, but more because they have Parson.s, '0'8, ,Streibel't, 'drl, :\1icConnick, '09 and Tobin, '11, from the rollege, ancl w:heeler and Ayer from the lVf/,~c1ic-. The two latter are supposed to be doing individual training. This is an exceedingly small nurn,ber of candidates, ctnd shows a deplor· able lack of spirit on the part of the college 1 n general. It is well known that practically every <>ne has at least a slight ability to participate in track work. Every ordinary man, equipped with a sound hocly and 1a good pair of legs can run. :Some men ea n run ,better than others. Wihy ? Pa.rtly because It seen1s n1ore than vrobable that, if a teun1 is likely to go to Troy far below the averages set by Old Union in t.he vast few year, Dr. Mac will withdraw the entry, for his past record shows him as far fromt willing to have nndertrained men compete in athletic events-especially in such a hanl race as the quarter mile. As to the general track situation, the usual call (> for. winter tra.ining in the gym. has resulted in drawing out a few npperelassm.en anc1 a few more freshmen. Under Dr. M;ac's supervision, these men arf' undergoing such prelim.inary training as the olcl gym. will permH. This WOl'k includes dnm·b-hell exercises, work at the weights and 11ractices of the starts for sprints ,and hurdles. Union is now in the New York State Intercol- legiate Association, and consequently will send a team to participate in the rn,eet at Rochester this year. But the prospects of getting anything bet- ter than third place in the meet seems slight. Co~­ gate, with a strong entering class, besides her o1d track men, has c1ou.bt less the .strongest .a.ggreg.ation of athletes in the association. Ro,chester stands second; while Union's part see1ns destined to tal{e vrarticed and learned how. 8-o, to save Olcl Union from1 that shadow of im- vending defeat every 1nan should eom1e out and clo his share. Freshmen especially should take up the work .and stick to it, for it depends u_pon their ability as to what the college shall stand for in the future years of track competition. CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. Last Tues,da~T evening, in ·Silliman H-all, the usual prayer meeting period was devoted to the Bible class, led by Dean Ripton, and a very use- fnl hour was spent tihns by those •present. Sunday nl'ternoon Dr. H1offman gave his second lecture on the Old Testa1nent. Hie began by giving a s·hort, hut full acconn t) of the review of his lecture of the previous week. Continuing his talk Dr. H·off1nan declared that the Old Testament has been redis- covered, and scientists now concur in the fa.ct that its truths do not collide with scientific principles. Touching- upon the story of Ada1n and Eve, he saicl th·at if they are looked upon from an ethical standpoint they become invaluable to manldnd. He concluded ·by saying that we now look upon the Old Testam~ent as the greatest hook that the Old \VIorld ,could give us on the subjects ,of ethics .and relig-ion. In it we have the cream of all the civilizations of the ancient woTld, and in it we have set forth the principles ·and foundation of the Kingdo.m of God. It ·clearly points out that rig-hteousness and love are the two great princi- ples of the eternal kingdom.

SOCRATES EULOGIZED Professor Bennett Tells of the Philos- opher's Life Prof. .John I. Bennett spoke before the People8' Fon1n1 ~sunday afternoon, taking as his subject \Socrates.\ He gave a ~l>rief account of the life of SocNttes and read several passages from the dh~­ logues of Plato t8 illustrate traits in the charact2::· of the famous. Greek ·philosopher. Summing up tlli3 results o·f hi.s teachings, Prof. Bennett said in part : \The sul)jec~t mratter of Socrates' teaching w~s not calculated to m·eet with universal favor; m,urh less were his n1ethocl. In the course of long years, prejudice and even qatred accumulated against hin1. N·o wonder. It was not pleasant to be ar.- cusecl of essential ignorance; less so to be convicted of it. By miany he was thought an intolerable l>ore and a nuisance. \Finally when he was seventy years old, he was brought to trial upon the cha.rge of corrupting the youth and of not believing in the gods that the city believed in. Perhaps they had no thought of 1d1ling Socrates, but they believed th1t he woulrl \fold his tent and move on\ at the suggestion of his friends. He faced the tri·al however, conduct- ing his own clefense and was convicted and eon- cleinnecl to death. ~surrounded .by his friends he drank the hemlock and died.

I2 THE CONC'ORDIENSIS ROCHESTER VIC'T'ORIOUS Union Basket Ball Team Defeated by Score of 24 to 1·6 Saturday night the Union basketball team met defeat at the hands of the crack Rochester five, iJY a score of 24-1'6. Inasm·uch as Rochester, by vir- tue of her victories over Yale, Co1~nell and Wil- liams, i's practically champion of the eastern col- leges, Union did reJ:narkably well to hold her to thh;; close score. In the first half the Hoehester vlayer.s went into 1 he g-ame with the idea that they would have an easy time, but at the. finish they admitted that a was one of the hardest games that they had yet played. S tarhuck scored the first point of the g:une on a foul, ·hut Union soon lost the lead, and, for a few minutes, it seemed :as if the Garnet would be swamped. Union, however, soon •:picked up and played a fast, steady game. R1oche.ster was un- a:ble to make another point during the half, while Star.buck caged a .basket and two more fouls for Union thus bringing the score at the close of the first half 9-5, in favor of the visitors. Rochester's inEtbility to throw hasl{ets and Leon's guarding were the features of the first half. The second half opened with som'e fast playing on both s.ides. Owing principally to Cassidy's dribbling Rochester quiddy scored several points. Then Union started playing real basketball aiH1 fron1 this time on fairly outplayed Rochester. ·Mi·cks opened the scoring for Union by a pretty over-hand throw and aided ·a.bly by Starbuck and Buck, ran up the s.core to eleven points.

The game throughout was close and without doubt Union would have won but for the fact that there were nn screens to the baskets; moreover the floor was waxed, and on this acco.unt the vla~·ers were un- a.lJle to keep their feet.

• THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 18, 1908 No: 14 T.HE CALL TO THE COLLE~GE MA.N By Charles Spr.agu:e; Smith, Managing Director, The P·eople's Institute, New York City. . Third of t~e C.ivic Club Series. There has never been a time when the call t0 the college 1nan was m~:>re imperative than to-day. TheTe Ls a new spirit abroad. Tb.e plain p·eople are ·a-waldng to a cons.ciousness of their power and a determination to· make use of it. Sometimes this c-onsciousness expresses itself in widespread unrest; a.t others in the· forestalling by govern- J ment. tbrongh remedial measurues, of danger ht- li€·ved to be impen.cling to the commnnity from the r::-:e of gl'Otll} power or tte deepening of dis- content. The manifestations differ according to conn- Perhaps one of the mo.st inter~estiRg expressi.ont') of this 1novement is to be found in. Japan. Modern Nippon is the creation of the last .generation. It would seem that we could hanlly Sl:!leak here of real democracy, and yet gov.ernm.ent, foreseeing the danger of monopoly in individual hands, has taken over the railroads, and w1rerever there ex- hibits itself a tendency to concentrate industrial activity in the hands of a small group, it appears ready to supplant by its own State monopoly the emerging private monopoly. When we turn to our own country and te:s t itR llcsiticn by L1at attained by other reading nations, we find it a laggard. The reasons are obvious. It is a land of bolnldless resources. Tbere has been a faith c1 rep-rootecl in :the p opnl ar n1incl that here all problems would solve the1nsehres. This. laisse~ faire policy has run its course. The resources of the country have sustained the lavish waste be- tries. In Great Briitain we have the co-operativt cause of their very abundance, bHt now there is movement, beginning with a small group of im- an end in sight and an abrupt awal\.ening. W•\'J. lJOverished weavers some sixty years ago, who pooled their scanty savings .so as to purchase prime necessities and sell at cost. This move- ment nas grown so that in Great Britain it numbers rnore than two milli-on memhers, has a capital of over one hundred and forty millions, carries on a vast and increasing business of a 1: kinds, has spread to the continent and even crossed the seas to America. In Germany we have on the one hand socialism, recognized as the strongest single f.orce in the land, and on the other·, a government perceiving the need of meeting the demands of which .social- ism is but the radical expression, and taking· over the railroads, ordaining compulsory life insurance for tbe workers, establishing old age pensions, etc. Similarly, Swit:~.;erlancl and Italy are taking over the railroads and extending otherwise communal activity; and France has the railroad system in such control as to be tantamount to ownersh:p. In country after country the story is analogous. perceive that our forests, i11steacl of being exhaust- less, are on the verge of utter extinction; that DUr coal, o!l, mines, transportation, cereals, fruits, various industries, are either wholly or almost entirel~- under limited private c01:1trol. With the establishment of monopoly have come widespread political corruption, graft and in· efficiency. Simultaneously the masses haY'3 awakened, and scclal unrest stalks abroad. Vv~(~ fa.ee a re·volution; democratic in its dem.and for contY.ol of government in the interest of all; ethical in its insistence that righteousness and justice shall nbtain. A few leaders comprehen·i the situation-Roosevelt, Bryan, LaFollette, Ton1 Johnson and others. .A1s to Charles E. Hugh€s, his phen01nenal rise to influence and popularity i.s due to the manly, sincere and rapidly progressiye way in which he i.s coming to a full perception of this truth and directing his conduct accorrl- ingly. At such an epoch-making stage in national hi::>- tory, it is supremely important to form a correct

I I estimate o,f the forces that will dHterrnine the morrow. What is the :cllaracter of the ma..ss es of oHr people? Will their advance be to-ward revo- l utio·n or evolution? It wHl be toward €VOl ution-- since their judgment i.ts fundamentaHy sane and their purpose righteous-. provided that i11npassable obstacles a.re not placed in the- path. 'The mult:- tude h.as not the power of self direction. No· folk- mass ever had. It neecls leadership. H should have consecrated and informed, not demagogic, leadership. Here, then, comes tke call to the ·college man. Our country should be the great proviRg place for de·mocracy, the land where, in a large v.ray, for all humanity and future .social development ,some of the great problems of self-g.overnm.eRt are worked out. There has never been such opportunity there- for, n.o land so vast, deb, fertile; n() people so free from the trammels of the past; n.0 standard set up at the beginning o,f a nation's life so truo and .adapte-d to the farthest futur;e, as that con- taiRe:d in our bill of rights, the Deelara.tion of Independence. To be a. college bred rna11 in the prime of life at so. pregnant .a moment, not nerely in the history of this country, but in that of the world, in the place where, with the farthest- reaching consequences for all, great secial prob~ lems ca.n be worked out, is a suprene privilege. The mass.es will accept the brotherly comradeship and leadership o.f the ed11cated man, provided such men come to them with entirety of consecration and intelligent sympathy. Upon SHCll union be- tween the masses and the educated and conse- crated young men of our country the issue of the - movement depends. We shall emerge llpon a broad, high plane of humanity and have n.o occa~ sion to envy the inhabitants of any other region,_ or we shall fail lamentaly and somew~ere else in the world the g-reat problems pcf democracy that we have been unable to .solve will have to b8 w·r<>ugh t out. I cannot recall any other moment in history when a strong, true man, who has enjoyed the privilege of culture and ·heen perrn.i tt~Hl tln1s to discern the· higher value of the spiritual, can servo his God and his fellow man to better }JUrpose than here and now; and, from many years <Jf exp.er- ience in constant touch with the mass 1u.ovement, I appeal to my college b-ro-thers to d<J their part as twentieth century AmerJ.cans. 1908.

:l '. i 8 trHE ·CONCORDIENSIS SNOWBALL SCRAP. Classic Fight Awarded to the Fresh- men ·- Sophs 'Outnumbered. 1'he two under c1.a.sses met in battle for the 1ast tirne for the pre.sent college year, When on Friday afternoon, imn1ediately following the chapel exer- c:ises, the Freshn1en class defeated the Sopho- mores in the annual snowball scr.ap. 'l''he conditions, from the s·pectators' standpoint were mo·st ideal. The snow was of a semi-liquid cor1.sistency, and the road above the Terrace Wall was knee deep with m. nd. 'The Freshm~en, as usual, \bolted\ chapel, and stayed out-of-doors to prepare icy missiles with W'hich to bombard the 1nem bers of the Sophomore class. When chapel was dismissed, the Sopho- mores, instead of coming out of the front door to be :pelted with snow balls, made a sortie from th8 back:. windows and turned the \frosh'' flank. Th·e scdn1mage started at once, and the usual in- dividual wrestling- matches took place. In the absence of th€ Sophomore president fron1 the scrap, the upper classm·en deeignated Vice Pr€.sident Irish as president pro tern. The two under classes t11en adjourned to the Terrace Wall and started to throw each other over. 'The Sopho- llores were outnumbered and in about ten minutes no .contestants of the class of 1910 were left on the up:per side of the wall, J.)r·esident pro tern. and all having been tossed over the brink into the snow drifts below. The Freshmen class was declared vi.ctorim}S, and ail adJourned to luncheon. President Tucker .of Dartmouth College has is- sued a manifesto against baseball, declaring that it has proved harmful on account of the commer- cial element that accompanies it; and unless some very radi-cal reform can be effe·cted, must be for- bid. den.

P~·o:fe:s.sor John Foster told his classes that science rests on a classified body of facts. And Bea~·d, i:n his \Hi:story of the Reformation,\ ag·ree- ing with .an older and a better man, says authen- tica:Hy: \To reasnn upon assurnpti·on ends in s.chclasticism; to reason UlJOn ascertained facts, issues in science.\ BHt we have Nndoubted sciences founded upon assumptions, s-ciences based, a.s Mill says, not on direct experience, but that \All true political science is in one sense of the _phrase, a priori, being deduced from the tendencies of things. \And Jevcns seems to agree with Mill. .A.t least on this point, however Innc:h they may have differed as to value; for he says: \Instead of converting our present science of economics into an historical scie1~ce, utterly destroying it in the process,\ arlcl- ing, however, as a saving clause, \Doubtless it ]s c1ifficnlt to help feeUng that opinions adopted antl contlrmed by such ancient men have much weight of probabi:lity in their favoJ·. Yet in other sciences this weight of auth·ority has not been allowed to restrict the free examination of new 01Jinions allil theorie·s; and it has often been ultimately pro-ved that authority was on the wrong side.\ The Duke of Argyle, though he says, \Never were such broken victuals pas.se·d off on hungry mortals as Jevons passes off ·On us,\ agrees with the two last cited authorities, by stating \The ulti- mate truths of eco·nomic science are seated in the constitution of our own mental nature.\ And fur- ther agreeing with Jevons in \The very fact of an over-wide acceptance bas the effect of daunting new inquirers, through the ever powerful influence of Authority.\ Possibly tile difference between the tw-o 1nodes o.f scientific thought has not been more felicitously set f0rth than by Lord Salisbury, who as president of the BritLsh Association, at Oxford in 1894, after referrjng to the indignation of the Dons of some sixty years before, that the degree of D. C. L. had been conferred upon Brown, Brewster, Faraday :-tnd Dalton, said: \One potent cause of it was that both parties were teachers of science, but dirt not then in any degree attach the .~arne mean:ng to tl1at word. Science with the University for many generations bore a signification different from that which belongs to it in this assembly. It re})resented the knowledge which alone in the

This was finally determined by placing an ex- tre,Inely severe penalty upon the illegal touching oif :the ball by a player of the passing side, coupled with the restriction that none of the passer's side other than the man who first legally touched the ball should recover it if he faile·d to catch it. This. with a severe penalty for impr·operly attempting to recover the ball was the extent of the res trir- ti ons b eyong those cf last year.

r2 THE CONCORDIENSIS VERMONT WINS A :CLOSE GAME. LAND OF GO:SHEN. Union Loses at Burlington By a Score of 25 to 15 ...... Charges o:f Ut1fairness Made. Playing a desperate game from. the start, against odds that could not be overcome by fair means., the Garnet five went down to a defeat that should have been a victory, at the ]'lands of Vermont Uni- V·er.sity on Saturday night, the .score at the end of the game being 25-15 in fav<Jr of the New Englancl 1 aggregation. According to all accounts of the gmne, even taking into account the testimony of the Vermont players, the game was run in anything but a fair 1namner, and the r.eferee tillle after time failed to call fouls. on the Vermont team, when the playing verged on that of a. football -order. Running with the hall was condoned on Vermont'.s side, and there were always two p]ayers on the ball to Union's one, without eliciting any penalty. Union played a plucky game against the odds, and at the end of the first half_, in consideration of the unfair treatment they w·ere receiving., the play- ers were ready to leave the floor and forfeit the game. The lo.ss of the guarantee to the Athl·eUc Asso-ciation, however, held them back and they played to a finish, without any hopes. of winning. All of the Garnet players were in the best of shape and showed the·mselves capable of putting up a first grade article of basketball. They went into every play with a, snap and vim that would have resulted in victories in the earlier games of the .season, and with a spirit that augurs. well fo! .. the outcome of the Hamilton game to ... morrow night. 'The playing after the first :half became merely mechanical, and none of the players wer.e up to the form set during the first part of the game. Union's line-up was as follows: Starbuck, right forward; Buck, left forward; Micks, center; Brown, left guard; Leon, right guard; Micl\s, substitute left guard. At a recent me-eting of the Junior Class., McCor- mick was elected captain of the basketball team. The .Juniors. have challenged the Freshmen to a series of games, and later they will play the Sophomores for the championship of the college. Dr. Cady's Sixth Lecture. Rev. Putnam ·Cady gave the sixth of his series of lectures in the chapel Friday afternoon. The subject was \Land of Goshen and the Lower Stnai Peninsular.'' Mr Cady, in .sta.rting his lecture, showed by a chart the probahle route that the children of Israel took when leaving the land of bondage and gning to Canaan. Fir.st, in describing the land ·Of Goshen, he showed how the Ieand is made fert:le by the agency of canals carry1ng water fro1n the Nile. Following a route south from the Land of Goshen he took his audience to the Mountain ·of Sinai. Speaking of the crossing of the children of Israel of the Red Sea he showed that this can lje accounted for by natural agencies, in fact as 11e explained it, there are many case.s -on re·cord where a strong wind has separated the waters o( lal{es and rivers in such a way as to make a con- siderable dry space. In describing the mountains ·of Sinai he ex- plained that there are as many different colors found in the rocks composing the sides of the mountains as one may find in the autumn sunset. The mines in this section have been worked for many centuries and we have one cas.e on record where the king of Assyria sent an army here 3,800 years before Christ to mine copper for him.

I f i '. l ' THE CONCORDIENSIS 13 INTER--CLASS GAM:E. Freshmen Lose the Game and the Series ....... Score Close. 1910 won the final game and the Sophono-re- Fresh.lnan series by a Hco.re of 19-14 on Saturday afternoon in the gymnasium. There was a gre~t display of class spirit, ancl the playing at an times was exciting. The Sopho- mores felt the loss of Heque·mbourg at center, al- though Anderson, who filled his place, wa.s a ver- itabie whirlwind, and played the best game for the second -year class. Th.e Freshmen play.ed .together better than in any o.f the previous games of the season, and O'Connell and Wallace were remarkably quick in all -of their plays. During the first half the Freshmen could not find the basket for g.oals, while the .Sophomores managed to run up a number of points, so that at tl1e end of the half the score .stood 13-3 in favor of 1910. The Freshmen started the second half with a rush that fairly swept the Sophomo·res from their fe.et, and for a time it looked as if the palms of victory would grace the escutcheon of 1911. But the Sophomores, by hard playing during the last few moments of play, managed to }{eep the balance turned in their favor and won the ga.me, the final score being 19-14. The line-up: 1910. 1911.

The death rate from typhoid fever in that city is higher than in any city in the State. The advisallilHy of tapp.ing the river on the Niagara side has been talked of, but Mr. Mason thinks that it w;oukl not improve conditions as that side of the river would also be poluted. Mr. Ma.son also spoke of hard water and stated that some chemists held that hard water is more free Df typhoid germs than .soft water, and some held to the other side of the question. He quoted fro1n E.nglish authoriti-es supporting both sides. He also gave fignres to .show cases that fever con- tracted from well water in rural districts is more frequent than fever cases contra.cted from river water in cities.

L.#Ql & ;:ua:cWii&LJ§UZw_ & C. . 5 THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE:! FEBRUARY 25, 1908 No. 15 HAMILTON DEB.ATE . Pr.eliminary Details Settled~Speak­ ·ers Chosen All o.f the preliminary ch:tails of the coming Hamilton-Union debate have been settled, and all that remains to be done is the final selection of . judges for the contest. The debate, as announced, will tal\e place in the college chapel Wednescla~· evening March 11 The subject to be debated is: \Resolved That Dur general currency ancl ban!\- ing systems were the domi n:1nt caL:.se of our re- cent financial panic.\ Hamilton will defend the affirmative and Union t11e nr·gative of this ques- tion. Hamilton selected her speakers last week and they will appear in the fo 1lo wing order on the evening of the debate: ~A~nibal, '08; Watson, '08. and Williams, '0·8, with Rifenbarl{, '0'9, as alter- nate. The Union Debating Council at its recent meet- ing selected the team to cl efc:nd ti1e Garnet side of the argument. The speakers will lJe LaCrosse, 'OS; King, '08, ancl Weyrauch, '08. with R. Ury, '09, as alternate. Daily debates are being held in c~apel by the mernbers of the Union team to perfect them in the lines of argument lil\:ely to be followed up in the debate. At the meeting a list of ten judges was prepared to be sent to Hamilton during the week. · From these ten Hamilton will eliminate snch names a~ she desires, when the judge.s will be chosen from. the remainder. Names on the list as it stands at present include prominent judges and lawyers of Albany, Schenectady, Troy and Amsterdam. LaCrosse, the corresponding secrEtary for the cottncil, has written several times to Rutgers Col- lege relative to the annual debate with that in- stitution. Thus far no answer- has been received, h()wever. RELAY TEAM TO COMPETE . . Union Will Meet Hamilton and R. P. I. at Troy To-morrow Night Union will take a prominent part in the big athletic carnival to be h.elcl in Troy to-morrow evening. The relay team, composed nf Streibert, Parsons, Dwyer and Ayres, will represent us at that tilne. The 111eet is given added intere.st owing to the fact that Hamilton has recently decided to send a team to particir:ate in the same relay race. Hitherto in the T'roy carnivals Union has met only R. P. I. and has thus far successfully helll her own in the contest. Hamilton's addition to the list will give added impettls to the runners to win the event, and to the .students in general to support the meet. Dr. MacComber 1nade the annuuncement in chapel yesterday concerning seating arrange- n~ents for the students, and it is expected that a large number will attend the meet. The carnival annually attracts athletes from all of the big Eastern colleges and athletic associa- tions. Among the prominent events this year will be a relay race between Cornell and Pennsylvania. Each of the runners will cover a half-mile stretch, maldng the race two miles in length. Taylor, Pennsy's great runner, and holder of the inter- collegiate record in the quarter, will varticipate. \tVilliarns and Brown will meet in a one mile re- lay race, and besides this in the open events there will be contestants fr·om an over the country. The meet is one of the foremost held during the winter season, and attracts hundreds of visitors annually. A vlan is now under way for the presentati-on of a representative college minstrel, to he given at some time during the coming spring months, at Nebraska.

Henry Yates 'Satterlee, for twelve years Pr-otestant Hpiscopal Bishop of Wash-ington, died Saturday <:rf pneumonia. He was 615 years o}d. Bishop Satterlee is believed to have caught the fatal illness two weeks ago when a transfer boat, on whieh he was a passenger on his return trip from Provid,ence to Washington, was detained in a fog in New York Harbor for seven hours. A!- thougb threatened with the grip, Bishop Satterlee off;tciate-d at servic.es the following Sunday. A f·e·w hours later his condition became acute ancll plrysicians were summoned. Although seem- ing to recover for a time, penumonia developed and he grew worse rapidly. He died shortly 1Je· fore 8 o'clock Saturday morning . P:te:Side·nt Roosevelt, Car.d(inal Gibbons and all the Catholic and Protestant clergy of Washington sent mess:ages of sympathy to his family. Bti·sbop Satterlee was born i~ New York city on January 11, 1843. He was the son of E~dward Sat- terlee aRd Jane ·A!nna Yates Satterlee. His rna· tern-al grandfather was Governor Joseph Yates of New York. In 1863 Bishop Satterlee was graduated from C-olumbia University with the d·egree of B. A. and rec.eived his master's degree three years later. From Columbia he went to Princeton 'Theological College and was graduated fro-m there in 1872. The Bishop was ordained a deacon of the E;pis- copal Church in l8165 and a priest two years later by Bishop Potter. H·is first charge was Zion C:hut·ch, Wappinger's Falls, N. Y., where he served until 1882. In the same y·ear he was given the degte:e of D. D. by the trustees of Union Oollege. He tllert becam·e rector of Calvary ·Church, New Yor·k city, where he officiat·ed until 189·6. As rector of Calvary Church Bishop Satterlee became widely known in New York city. He founded Ollive ·Tree Inn, in E!ast T'wenty-third Street, a lodging hous·e for men; the Galilee M·!s- sion and a boys' club. His work required seven assistants. While in N·ew Y.ork he declined two prominent ID:Piscoi})~I posts, tho·se of Bishop Coadjutor of Ohio and Bishop of Michigan. When the new bishb·pric '{)f Washing.to nwas crea.ted, in 18'9•6, :Bishop Sat- terlee consented to tal{e charge of it. He was eon- s:ecrated on March 2·5, l8i9·6. A short time later he left fo-r Russia, as a dele- gate of the entire American Erpiscopal body, to carry to the Tsar a protest against the Armenian massacres. In London he was delegated by the Archbishop of Canterb1uy to repres·.en:t also the E'uropea1:1 Episcopal bod:i:es in Sl!lbmittil1g a similar protest. Bishop Satterlee was received by the Tsar on August ·5, 1896. The Bishop was the author o.f sev.eral books. He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter. The s·on eRtered the ministry in North Carolina. €ollt!Jt ,®etttng .. J At the regular college m .. ee.ting Monday, Captain Starbuck of the basketball team gave an account of the gam·es at Potsdam and at St. Lawrence ' particularly contrasting the fair and courteous treatment which the team met with at the former place with the rough rece-ption received at the latter college, and concluded by strongly re-com- mending that athletic re1ations with St. Lawrence be severed. Dr. MacComber mad€ an appeal to the students for more interest in tra.ck work, calling their es- pecial attention to the meet at Troy Wednesday, in Which Hamilton, R. P.

Law- rence Played Leon~ Charest ................ Fortell, R. Calder -· ·----- On Friday and Saturday of last week the basket- hall team took a trip that included a game with Potsdmn Normal School and with St. Lawrence College, winning the former and losing the latter of the two games. Marked contrast is affonled in the treatment accorded to the team by the two places, Potsdam putting up one of th·e cleanest games of basketball that has been Dlayed against the Union team this year. St. Lawrence, on her home floor, resorted to rough football tacti~s, and the game was a most unsatisfactory one fr·om every view point. The St. Lawrence Game Saturday evening the Garn·et five rnet St. Law- rence in basketball on the home court of the lat- ter team and were defeated by a score of 47-5. The game was more of a football exl1ibition than a game of college basl{etball, ancl the referee, after a few minutes' of playing, seemed to become dazed, allowing foul after foul to be peqJetrated by the home team without calling a penalty. The Union five, besides being out of place on the strange court, refused to resort lo the bruiser tactics en1ployed by the· St. Lawrence aggrega- tion, deeming it better for the good name of Union to put up as clean a game a.s was possible under the extraordinary circumstances. Union's five points were all made by Starbuck from fouls. Starbuck, in com·menting on the game in chapel 1neeting Monday morning, made the statement that the treatment accorded to Union College by the St. Lawrence players and the insti- tution in general was so decidedly off color that he advised the cancelling of all future athletic relations with that place. In this he was seconded by Dr. MacComber, who .said ·that the lo·ng trip and. the ill-usage at the end of it were not worth tbe trouble taken to win a doubtful contest. Guards.

A. rules governed the contest instead of the intercollegiate code gener- ally followed. The game was a fine, well played c·ont<:;)st, and the Normal School men ha.d a truly worthy basket- ball team on the floor. Union held her own every minute of the time, however, and in the latter part of the game, by wearing out their opponents with swift tactics, swept ahead with a winning score that left no doubt as to the superiority of the team representing the Garnet. The score during the entire first part of the game was very close, being tied at frequent in- tervals. Union's passing was a feature o.f the gam·e. The fine treatment accorded the Union tear.o. was a subject that all of the 'Varsity :players agreed upon unanimously. The referee was par- ticularly just in his decisions, and there was no question from either side as to the fairness of the contest. The line~up was: Union. Potsdam.

The occasion was the game with Hamilton, which, resulted in a score of 28 to 1 (:) in favor of HamiTton. The score however does ' ' not tell the real story of the game, and only onA who witnessed it can appreciate the excellent playing of our tem11 during the second half. The wearers of the Buff and Blue started in at the blow.ing of the whistle to play basketball and displayed such ability in locating the basl{ets that the first half ended with 20 points to their cre(Ht, while the Garnet team managed to score but four points. The team worl{ of the H!amilton men was wonderful, both in pa~.sing and field sho·oting, while our men seemed bewildered at the speed of their opponents and at n·o time during this half did it seem as thcmgh they had any show of win- ning. Smith, a Hamilton forward, was knoc~ed over by Referee Dorticos during- one of the scrim- mages and in the second half he was put out on account of injuries received by coming in contact with Brown. During the intermis.sion something must have happened to put \ginger\ in to our men. Certainly they did not seem the same men who had played such a loose game during the first half. ,) The de- fenders of the Garnet seemed to know just where they wanted to pass the ball and usually had a man there to get it. On the whole it may be saicl that our temn work of the second half excelled that of the visitors. The score of 8 to 6 in this half in favor of Hamilton indicates the great \brace\ that Union's team took. Charest, who was put into the game for the second half to replace Buck, who was taken out on account of injuries, played a fast and consist- ent game. Brown and Leon played their usual good game. Captain Starbuck had an \off day\ in throwing fouls and only netted five throws out of a possible twelve. The line-up was as follows: Union. Hamilton.

INDOOR MEE'T SUCCE.SSFUL The 'C;ompetition Was Keen In All the Events As a try-out for~ Freshman 'Varsity tracl-\: ma- terial, the indoor track meet he1d last Wednesday afternoon in the gym nasi urn was an unqualified success. The meet showed that there was m nch goo.d material in the entering class, that with training can be developed into future points in Union's track meets. There was not very ~much opportunity to judge distance runners, but the men were remarkably quick in getting off for the fifteen-yard dash, and the high jumping of Allyn., an untried Freshman, proved somewhat of a sensation. Allyn, who has not had any previous track experience, cleared the bar at five feet two inches, winning the event from Huthsteiner, on account of his handicap of four inches. The events run off included the fifteen-yard dash, a potato race, shot put, running high jump and standing broad jump.

A NEW COACH FOR UNION --· -· --·-··- Murray, 9£ Williams,. a Likely Candi- date-Negotiations Opened ------ ;; William H. Murray, the star tackle of the Wil- liams football team during the season o.f 1904, will probably be engaged as co·ach by the Union Col- lege Football .A(ssociation. Definite arrangements between the contracting parties have not ib·een. made, 'but since Murray has expreEsecl his desire to con1e and since the Athletic Board, in meeting Thursday night, gave their .approval of h~m for coach of the team next year, it seems probable that the details will s.ettle themselves. Murray was graduated from Williams CoBegc with the class of 1905. During his entire stay in that institution he was recognized as one of the most consistent players on any of the teams of the s1naller colleges in the East. His playing on the Williams team was strong throughout the entire tePm of years he was idenUfied with it. Last year he applied for the position of coach on the Union eleven, but arrange1nents had been closed with \Hal\ Tenney, and the negotiations between Murray and the Uni-on management fell through. Murray was retained by th-e Hobart College Football Association, and he took their team in hand, with the result that the coHege turned out the best football eleven ot has ever known in its history. ·with a very small number of men to draw up-on for the squad, Murray worked the ma- terial at his command into such shape that games were won from teams 1n uch superior in weight, : Picture Framing=== Did she give you her Photograph for Christmas ? Frame it I THE GLEASON BOOI< @. and with facilities supposedly much better than thGse possessed by Ho·bart. Manager Roosa, '09, will open correspondence tmmediately and will try to come to d e:finite terms with Murray, so that the team will b:e with a head to open the fall football season of 1908. It is lU{ely that a week's spring practice will be taken to get the n1:embers of th·e squad interested in the work, provided that a coach is retained in time. By action of the council, Dr. MacComber and La Roche, '08, were delegated to attend the conven- tion of the New York State· IntercoUegiate Ath- letic Association, to be held at Utica on the seventh of March next. The .colleges in the ass o- ciation will all send cle·1egates to that conven- tion. At that time they will probably ratify the winner of the basketball pennant. ---------- First steps were taken at the H.otel W-orthy in Springfield last Tuesday evening for the forma- tion of an athletic association which will include in its ;membership all of the colleges of New Eng- land. The meeting was attended by representa- tives from ·A1mherst, Dartmouth, Tufts, Vermont, Wesleyan and Williams. CHARTERED 1834 THE SCHENECTADY SAVINGS BANK Cor.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS JOURNALISM A CAREER by Arthur Brisbane Civic Club's Fourth Article I .am asked to answer this question: \Sho-u~d a yoltng man on leaving college go into politics ? If so, how?\ The ll\l:OSt important works of man are: Government,. or politics. Original sdentific research. Creative lab{)r, in art, literature or music. He who does not giv-e his thought to one of these three 'branches of human effort must neces~ sarily do inferior work in life. The man -who ignores politics because he lacks interest in humanity and in the probJems of leg-is- lation, is no l>ess contemptible than the man whos8 political .activity is based upon desire for the profit it 1nay yield him. The siln1~lest, narrowest field of political ac- tivity is discussion with your neighbor. The wide,st field at present, with the possible excep- tion of W{)rk in a few high {)ffices difficult to reach is offered by newspaper writing or management. If the college graduate realizes that he has thus far o-nly learned to study; if he combines a desire t·o learn with a capacity for receiving strong im- pressions and a real sympathy with the people; if he is willing to wait a long while, and perhaps in- definitely, for wealth, I should advise him to seeh: p-olitical and other useful activity in newspaper work:. Journalism is in its babyhood. It needs new men, new energy, enthusiasm and earnest convic- tion above alL I saw in one young gr-oup of Columbia law stu- dents three or four men at least out of a dozen that would :mal{e useful newspaper workers. I believe that in devoting· their live.s to the fights of the peopJe tJ1rough journalism, these young students could find greater happiness than in sell- ing their energies to c-orporation fights in the court room .. Already it is possible for one newspaper writer in this country to talk to ten millions of Amer- icans in a day. If the youn.g graduate were ta'ken back to old Ath-ens he would not miss a chance to have his say in the public square. 1:,he editorial column of .a great newspaper is the public .square of to-day. The ·man who talks in that column has the opportunity of the orator that ad-dressed the .ancient Athenian crowd. Politics· offer innumerable opportunities for tAimerican ability of all kinds. Our governm·ent has become an industrial organizati-on largely-a syfttem of industrial feudalis.m better ·organized already than old military feudalism. Concentra- tion of industrial wealth and power means added government responsibility for the prntection of citizens dealing with monopolies. The government will need hereafter especially capable business iminds in p-olitics, as well as mental leaders and political thinkers of the· old ldnd. Newspaper work brings a n1an in contact with politics and politicians. It 1nakes it easy for him to engage actually in politics if he wishe.s. It should convince hin1 that the· effort to influenco politics for the benefit of pe-ople outside of office is more satisfactory than any work that can be done in office. N ews.paper work of to-day is largely anonymous, and that fact is discouraging to those that would delight in the sound of their own na1nes. But let a man select for his guiding thought the half cynical t0ast of old Teufelsdroch: \Die Sache der Armen in Gottes und Teufels Namen.\ Let him work as hard as he can for the millions of human atoms unknown to him, as he is un- known to them. Let him find satisfaction in good work and be content to say with the old philoso- pher of Weissnich: \Two writings of mine, not indeed known as mine (for what am I), have faHen, perhaps not altogether void, into the mighty seed field of Opinion; fruits of my unseen sowing gratifyingly meet me here and there. I thank the Heavens that I have now found fny Gal'ling; wh-erein, with or without perceptible result, I am minded dili- gently to persevere.\ ART·HUR BRISBANE. . In the Intercollegiate Hockey League, Harvard and Yale are unbeaten, and the teams of the other universities seem to be out of the race.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 13 HAMILTON TO WITHDRAW? --·---· --- Announcement Made of Cancellation of N. Y. S. I. A. A. Meet ---·-·-··- According to a staten1ent made h1 Hamilton \Life\ of the past ':Veek, flamBton and Colgate Co\tleges have definitely decided to wHhdraw their support from the New York State Intercolle- g·iate Association's track meet schedul:ed to· occur nn the thirti:eth of May. According to Hamilton's plans, UID.ion and Hamilton will instead engage in a dual tr2ck meet in Utica on that d:ate. Repres.entatives of our local AthLetic Board, when interviewed regarding the matter, refused to give out any statement regarding the reasons these two teams withdrew their support at this tilne, thinking that erroneous impressions regard- ing the matter might be given out. It was ad- mitted, however, that Hamilton and C·olgate had taken actioR as .stated by ''Life.'' It is understood that an adjustment of the dif- ficulties of the situation will be one of the main topics of discussion to be brought up at the meet- ing of representatives of the association, to· be held next month. Dr. MacComber and LaRochP., '08, will represent Union at the meeting. --------- MIRTH IN GEOLO,GY Comical Answers In Geology Exami- nations Professor Barbo-ur of Nebraska University spent a part of one period in reading to one· of his classes a few of the ridiculous answers which ap- peared in the recent final examinations in Geology.
