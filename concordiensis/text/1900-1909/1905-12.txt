Coming here last year as a freshman, he first endeared himseH to the hearts of aH Union men by his brilliant work on the football field. In action, he played a hard, clean, and most genUe- mp.nly ga1ne, al\yays consistent. As g.raduaHy he hecam1e knowr1 for what he was as a man, his charming personality made over his warm, ad- mirers into firm friends. AhYays the same, good natured, of the best character, 111odest and most unassuming, he soon became one of the most popular men in college. As a student, in spite of the time he gave to athletics, his work was most remarkable, making him one of th2 leaders of his class. His teachers have nothing but words of praise for hhn. * * * * RESOLUTIONS By the College: \\\TJ1ereas God in His infinite wisdom has re- moved fro·m our m'idst Harold Ranson1 1\foore. and, Whereas, His family has there by been de- prived of on2 m.ost dear to them, and, Wbereas, the student body of Union CoU.egp has lost in him a true and loyal comrade, and his Alma M\ater st1iffered an inestimable loss, be it therefore Resolve(\.

'-L'HE CO . .'\CORDillEKSlS I quest·ton, \\Vhe·re Art Thou.\ After reading frorn Genesis the story of the faB of Adam and Eye Dr. Talmage said in part: \Do not think that the Lord chased up th<::se peop'le in m~der to con- dem.n them but to find the1n that he 111ight save the1n. 1 The s~tory is one of salvation, of the search to find and bring back. Those ·who had hidden themselves were in sin and guilt. 'l..,here are t\'o quesUons to he brought out in the chapter read. First, is there any revelatio·n to us in the story? and second. the personal question, \Where art thou?\' In taking up the first question Dr. Talrnage said St. John's Church stood for years incomplete be- cause of the infirmity of the land on \Yhich it was started. Quick sands were found to be the cause, piles and posts were driven in, and the work of erecting the church completed. To make a foundation we must recognize the quick- sand-a man rnust recognize the sin in his life. God gave us. life in the w·orld to enjoy and to have the chance to do something good and noble. Do- ing these things is the good; not doing the1n is sin. \As ·we grow· away from the grosser sins the devil becom·es more and more subtle. It is the fashion to say that if a n1an is sincere he is all right, but sincerity is not all that is necessary. H(' 1nust have judgn1ent. \Ve cannot take sincerit;' for honesty. Error in judg.m·ent is sin and wo who have the n1.ost adyantages are responsible fo;· errors of judgn1ent where people of no oppor- tunity are not. vVe 1nu~t recognize that the root of sin is in Relf-estilnation. \\Ve \·ant a man to have conceit but we want him to put that conceit into harneR~. '' \The second question: '\.Vhere Art Thou?' In hiding? Hiding fro1n God. A man cannot do it. Go~will find hin1 out. :'\or can you hid(' from your~elf-hide frmn repentance. The 1nan who tries to hide from repentance is the n1an 'Yho did not 1nean to do it. Mean not to do it. \Vhere art thou ?' \ Alumni '60.-E.

II.AltOLD RA~SO~I ~IOORE The tragedy of two weeks ago rob heel his fan1ily of an oniy son, the college of one of its tnost 1oyaill and true students, ancl his friends of {)ne beloved by then1 for all that goes to rnake Hp a tnan. To say that Harold Ran.som Moore was one of the n1ost popular tnen in college seen1s to us to fall short of what we should say of hin1. His qualities were such as to endear hin1 to all: his nature so lovable that he n1ust 1nake friends of all with whon1 he can1e into con- tact. His death left a sense of irretrievable loss in the n1i11d of each and every one of us. The college has tried, in every -vvay, to show its heartfelt syrnpathy with the be- reaved ones, a11cl there is little left that we can say,. exce1Jt to try to express to his fan1- ily and also to his fraternity, our great grief ancl sorrO\l\T _ TI-I!E EUH:Xri~G QUESTIOX A.t the present titne the feeling at L.,.nion against foot hal1 is intense. Doubtless a can- ~ vass of the students -vvoulcl show the n1ajor- ity opposecl to it.

It was decided that Presi- dent Raymond and Dr. Towne should represent the coUege in the conference that ''ras held in Ne\v York last night. After the meeting the fol- lowing state1nent was given out by Prof. Opdyke, chairman of the Executive Comnlittee of the Board, the last two sentences of which giYe the general opinion of the meeting: \The accident of a ·week ago last Saturday, ·while not due to those features of football that have produced the m~ost criticism, has yet called sharp attention to the undeniable fact that the gam•e as played at present is a very rough one. If the game is retained. it ought to be 1nade much less dangerous than it is. Whether the danger can be eliminated short of such fundarnental changes as ·would take out of the game the ele- ln:ents of physical strength and endurance' that have rendered it attractive to college men is a question that cannot be decided off-hand. I hope that the que8tion n1ay, after proper conference, be answered aUirn1.atively.

THE CoNCORDIENSIS No. II .v: ,o· · ·L'· v v1··x I ., 'I' .. '1 Ll . U/\1101\T COLLEGE, DE:C. ro, 1905. It Prof. E. A. M. Corbin, A. M. '71 Ek·n,est Alb-ert MoTisml C0rbin was born on a ·farm rie-a.r Wlfl:rre:a Oe·n·tre, Bradford County, Penn·sy:lv;ania, March 4, 1847. H.e was the eldest son G>:E N·els:on D. and sa.rah (Jveson} ·Corhin. His materna.l grandfather was an E·nglish Co~n.greg.a­ tio:nal .clergyman sent over by the London M.i-s- s.i-onary Boar·d as a missi·onary to th·e Indians of Long I:S·land. He settled at Moriches and labor- ed W•ith zeal and. a gratifying m·easure of suc- cess among the Aborigin•es whose tribes pitched their wigwams. and had their hunting and fishin.g grounds along the ocean shor~. Mr. Iveson also served as pastor of the Moriches Co·ngregational Ch:urch from 1825 till June, 1830. Mr. Corbin, probably, inherited much of his talent for teach- ing from, his ancestors, for he sprung from a fam- ily of teachers. His grandfather Iveson attract- ed some notic~ by being able to manage his school without recourse to corporal punishment, such pun.ishm,ent being very co1nmonly inflicted by pedagogues during the first half of the nine- teenth century. Young Corbin, being a strong, sturdy boy, and possessing high intell~ctual a1nbition, could not be content with the c01nmon dull life of drudgery in which weary round the majority of the farm:.. ers passed their days in the time of his boyhood. He, therefore, left the old home in the country among the Pennsylvania hills and coming to Owego, ~- Y., entered the Academy there in 186 3 and. spent four years of assiduous study under Professor Joseph A. Prindle, '54. Mr. Corbin's parents were unable to pay all the ·expenses of his education and on this account he foul'ld it neces- sary to husband his slender resources and add to them as opportunity afforded. He learned the dignity of honest labor by his O\vn practical ex- J!e.r·ience. He learned the wurth of a dollar by earning it. Like a tr-tte sen of Adam he often ate bread i.i1 :the sweat o'.f his face. WhHe preparing for college, our subject helped himself by work..: ing nights and mornings for his board. And in vacaHons he bent all his energi,es to earn money for tuition, books, and clothing. In 1865 wheil half 'vay through his preparatory course he united with the Owego PrE.·sbyterian Church on confess- ion of faith. In the fall of 1867 under the guidance of Pro- fessor Pr·indle, the Principal of the Academy, Mr. Corbin with three other students, C. E. Hollen- back, '71, W·. W. Jenks, '71 and E. C. Lawrence. '69, journeyed to Schenectady and entered the classical course of Union College. All the Owego boys secured rooms in the 1niddle section of South Colege. They chose the top floor on the south side, La'-vrence and Corbin taking the front room, facing the west and commanding a beauti- ful view of the Moha,vk Valley. '\\Vhile in college Mr. Corbin was never noted as a brilliant scholar but he won and kept the respect an.d confidence of the Faculty and h's fellow students by painstaking and conscientious attention to prescribe-d duties. How can my poor pen. picture his c'haracter or describe his traits and habits? Honest and upright in his ctealings, tactful industl~ious. endo,ved with common sense, that heavenly gift more to be desired than great riches. affable and friendly, ahvays gentle, pleasant and patient in his manners.-how can a young man like that fail to win friends and keep them? l\fr. Corbin \Vas a man of solid \Vorth, he had no showy attain1nents. .His acquaintance with Eng- lish history \Yas deep and thorough. Besides be- ing 11\'ell versed in the general history of the world he took special pains to trace the course of events in his o1vn country. There are two rival literary societies in college, the Philomathean and the Adelphic. Mr. Cor- bin joined the latter and possessing a retentive 1nemory and a ready flow of language he soon be- came one o.f the leading- spirits i'n that organiza-

6 :tion, always proving himself to be a foTmi.dlible ;an intelligent and patriotic ciUz·en, to vote for debater, able to look on all sides of a question and to construct an argument \Yith the skill of a workman that needs not to be ashamed. For recreation, Mr. Corbin preferred walking to other forms of exercise. In those dear old times while he was a student at Schenectady he and some friend for company, usually his college chum, would walk off to Troy or Albany or so1ne other town. Thus he visited Saratoga and drank of all the springs, an imprudence which pr<:~sumahly he never repeated. H'e climbed the Catskill moun- tains and explored Ho\Ye's Cave. Mr. Corbin graduated from the college in 18 71 and later received the degree of A. M. in cou1'se. Afterwards he studied medicine at the Albany Medical College and in the office of Dr. E. A. Vander Veer of Albany. Immediately after fin- ishing his course at Union he worked for a tin1e at civil engineering; then taught the graded school at Stillwater, ~. Y .. for a year; from this position he was prom.oted to Greenbush, ·which has since developed into the City of Rensselaer, where he served as principal of the public school for nine years; after which he was placed in charge of School ~o. 7 in Canal Street, Albany. Again we recognize the hand of the Lord in leading this child of the covenant to a new post of trust and responsibility. \Seest thou a man dili- gent in his business he shall stand before Kings; he shall not stand before mean men.\ In Janu- ary, 1884 MT. Corbin was transferred to the Al- bany High School as Professor of Xatural Sciences, where for the next t\\~o and one half years he labored with success and won many friends among the teachers and scholars of that institution. But the chair in the High School not proving altogether congenial, by his own request he was made principal of School Xo. 20, and con- tinued to occupy this position to the end of his days. Thus we have rapidly traced from start to finish Mr. Corbin's career as student and teacher. It remains to speak brifl.y of him as a citizen and a Christian. Constructive and conservative in his principles Mr. Corbin, as a rule, supported the Repu bli~an party, always, however, aimi.ng, as the best men and 1neasures. Soon after taking up his residence in Albany Professo-r Corbin brought his letter to the Con- gregational Church in the Capital City, and dur- ing the remainder of his life in response to the call of duty he assumed and bo:::·e a. leading and honorable :part in the activities and councils of that church, serving the Lord with fidelity and ever increasi11g usefulness as Trustee, D·eacon and Bible-class 'T:eacher and in all these offices bear- ing faithful \'\ritness to the fact that he was a true and deyoted fol'lo\,·er of Jesus Christ. Ey na- ture Mr. Cor:bin was exceedingly kindhearted. It was his delight to help some poor distressed body over a harcl place or deliver him out of some painful trouble. He \vas gentle, slow to anger, benevolent in disposition and found pleasure in doing an act of kindness even though it cost him personal sacrifice. Hence early in his manhood he \vas sought out as a ,,·orthy member for brotherhood and his name enrolled in the Lodges of Masons and Odd Fellows. And in these frater- nal orders no one could show a more unsullied record. To the extent of his means and ability, after providing for the wants and comfort of his fam- ily he opened his heart and hand to the aid of his relatives and friends sending many a gift to the old home in Pennsylvania. It is· said ''a man is known by the company he keeps.\ Certainly the motto ·which a person chooses is an index to his c·haracter. .As a collegian Mr. Corbin adopted the Latin motto: \Perseverantia omnia vincit\ (Perseverance conquers all things) and verified it with untiring force and patience all the rest of his life. Outside of Mr. Corbin's family, the \vriter of this sketch, havin.g been his most intimate friend and colniPanion for years, has set down the fore- going without embellishment, actuated by a sin- cere desire to pay a just and loving tribute to the merits of a right royal man who belonged to the American nobility. \An honest man's the noblest work of God.\ At best this is a naughty world

THE C.QN:CQRDIENSIS 7 to live in, and Mr. Corbin, though coming in daily contact with the selfish cruelty and in!i:quity .of a city, \vas enabled by God's graee to keep his heart pure and true. In the spring of 1'899 our friend was seized• with typhoid fever and after a long battle, succumbed to the disease August 26th. Three days later he was b:1,1ried with Masonic honors from his home on Myrtle A veTlue and from the First Congregational Church. His chtun and life-long friend, the R.ev. Dr. E. C. Lawre.nce, who had officiated at his wedding j1:1st twenty-three years before, aiso co11,ducted the funeral se.rvices preaching from the text: \I have fought a good figh.t, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day, and not to me only but unto all them. also that love his appear- ing.\ 2 Tim. 4:7-8. l\1any former pupils of Professor Corbin's schols ·were present and the principals of the various city schools attended in a body. 1Ten1.ple Co1nmandery ~o. 2, K.

Dr. Raymond declared no ·duty is plainer than that of keeping the college free from the taint of the c0mmercial spkit. He asserted that this was the taint to be feared rather than which some think adheres to money itself. It may be a wise dis- pensation of providence, said Dr. Raymond that keeps professors on meagre salaries; at all events they are the least worldly of men and .so long as the faculty dominates the life of an institution there is little danger of corruption. \But in recent years, 0 he continued, \their supremacy has ben challenged by the abnormally developed athletic interests of the college, and it is from that direction that we have the most to fear, because the spirit of modern athletic con- tests essentially is the commercial spirit.\ By this the speaker n:tade it plain he did not refer to professionalism or gate receipts, but to that spirit of modern business, at least in its higher reaches, which seeks victory at any cost. The root of the football evil, he declared, is the inordinate desire for spectacular success. Presi- dent R.ayrnond referred to the death of Harold Moore, the Un:on student, after a football game last month and declared it was an awful price to pay for a football game. \But his death \Yill not estimable lady, a gifted musician and organist for have been ·in vain,\ he concludE-d, \if it results in many years of the F'irst Congregational~ Church the reform of athletics.\ at AI bany (over which Dr. Ray Palmer was an The college quartette furnished several selec- early pastor); also by his son, Mr. John Iveson tions during the course of the evening.

Pharmacy Notes A meeting of the senior class was called for Wednesday evening. The object of the meeting was to decide on class pins, a question which had been pending for son1e time. A good deal of opposition was anticipated as at least two mem- bers of the pin committee were each desirious of placing the class' order with different firms. Mr. Christopher, being somewhat of a diplomat, brought the m·anager of the emblem department of Quayle & Sons of Albany, into the meeting. He presented a desig-n which he had originated and secured the vote of the class to place the order with Quayle & Son. How to Do It The \Student\ of Edinburgh University de- scribes one of the feats which may be performed by means of the wonderful science of jui-jitsu in the following way: \How to overpower two soldiers with drawn swords sitting at a table playing cards:- \Quietly walk up behind one of them and sud- 9 denly give a 1loud yell (this helps the inte.rco.stals). He wiU leap to his feet, \Vhen you will kick him behind the kn~·e with one foot, and 'hit him be- hind the head. with the otl:ler foot. He Will fall across the tablie. You now j.ump on his back, resth1:g your knees on his shoulders, and as the other soldier rises in amazement, grip his throat with both hands, so that he will fall back ov~r :his chair, dragg,ing you with him. As you are being ·dragged across the first soldier lunge. out with hoth feet at his head, which leaves you with one man, whose face should now be of a dark bluey-pUrp'le eoler, that is, of course, if you have done the trick properly. It is best to try this triek first on two persons dining, as a friend of mkne tried to clo it for the first time on two cav- alry swordsmen.. He was a kind friend and I miss him greatly.'' Engineering Changes A change iil the General Engineering Course in the Junior and Senior years is under consid- eration by the Committee on Education. The Board of Trustees has approved the change and as soon as an important question on the consid- eration can be decided on the committee will make public the full nature of the change. It is proposed to offer an optional course in the Junior and Sentor years of the general course leading to the degree of B. E. to enable students to tit themselves for administration positions. More engineers are being employed in this class of positions each year and the Trustees and Edu- cational Committee, realizing this have decided to offer the new course. It will substitute for some of the more technical engineering subjects. studies of a nrore general character. Surveying in the Junior year will be cut down to two or t'lil'ee hours pe·r week. Highways and pavements will be compressed into one term. Machine drawing and stereotomy will be omitted alto- gether. In place of these will be taught sociol- ogy, economics, elementary law and finance. It has not yet been decided whether or not the optional course will be open to the present Junior class. If it is decided to give them the option the new course will begin next term.

It is not the place of the college, nor of th~ Concordy. to teach spelling and \vriting, but we son1etin1es wish that it \ve~re.
