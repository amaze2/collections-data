THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL .. XXVI. UNION COLLEGE, MARCH 11, 1902. No. 19. CHARLES PROTEUS STEINMETZ. Inasmuch as Mr Steinmetz has recently been added to the faculty of Union College, doubt- less the following article from the March num- ber of \Success\ will prove interesting. It gives one a glimpse into the life and character of one of the greatest electrical authorities in An1erica. '' Hour after hour Mr Steinmetz talked and made plain the puzzles of electricity, the prob- lems of engtneers, and the methods of their labor, and, gradually, along with the showing of the fairyland of science, his own story came out. \I was born April 9, 1865, in Breslau, Germany,\ he said ; \ I did not go to school until I was s~ven years old, when my father sent me to the best one available. lie was al- ways interested in scientific subjects, and I think it tnust have been from him that I ac- quired tny interest along those lines. For twelve years I attended the gymnasium, as the school is called there. Then I went to the university, in the same city. As a boy at home I had a small chemical laboratory, and used to spend a good deal of time in it, but I joined in all the sports and amusements of the time. In the gy1nnasium I was always inter- ested in mathematics. It happened, during the last year there, that the professor gave ad- ditional lectures, which I attended. 1,hese lectures helped me a great deal, and, when I entered the university, I was in advance of the regular class. I want to say that absolutely all the success I have had has been due to my thorough study of mathematics. \I went to the university to study mathe- matics and astronqmy. It was somewhat be- fore the time of electrical engineering. The arc and incandescent lamps did not. exist, ex- cept perhaps as curiosities. Then I became interested in physical science, and studied physics, and later on, natural history. It was some time before I began the study of electri- cal engineering, and then, strangely enough, it was chiefly because of my friendship for a fellow student who was pursuing that subject. When I con1menced, I had no thought of mak- ing practical application of it ; I merely want- ed to know sotnetbing about the subject. \ My father had a fairly good government position, but he wa.s not able to supply me with an unlimited amount of money.. He had suf- ficient income so that I knew I could always live at home. The result was that I. did not hurry through the university, but studied for five years there. I wanted to be independent, however, and so I undertook tutoring in mathematics. I had a practical rnonoply of the business of preparing deficient gymna- sium students for graduation, due to my know- ledge of the needs of the university courses, and the peculiarities of the professors, and so . I could pick the men I wanted to tutor. The work gave me a small income, enough to carry tne along. ''I was twenty years old when I tnet my elec- trical engineer friend. It . was through him, also, that I became connected with the Social Democratic party. We used to meet in differ- ent rooms and discuss Social Democracy. We talked of revolutionizing the world without any consideration of feasibility, just as young men are likely to do ; but, for all that, it is very interesting. It really did me a great deal of good, though now, you see, I have reformed. I began to learn more about men, and studied workingmen, their ways of living, etc. I want- ed to know how they looked at things. Of course all this socialistic business was secret. It happened that the editor of the Socialist

6 THE :OONCORDIENSIS. paper there was suspected and imprisoned, and, \Vithout the knowledge of my father,.I became editor of the paper. There was quite a band of us, and, to divert the police, we got a Polish fish-vender to be recorded as the responsible editor. The fish-ven .. 1 cr could not read or wr'i te, but we arranged to give 4im, as cotnpen- sation, the left-over copies of the paper. \For several tnonths, while I was. a student, · I was the editor of three publications-the weekly Socialist paper, a weekly issue of 'Pop- ular Science Leaflets,' and the 'Popular Sci .. ence Fortnightly.' Part of the time, however, the latter two papers did not appear, because of difficulties with the printer and the paper dealer. None of the writers for any of the publications was paid for his work, and I never received a cent for mine. It was done for the good of the cause and for atnuseme nt. \ Finally, the police confiscated the Social- ist paper. 1\hey arrested the supposed editor, the Polish herring man, and wrote out a state- ment for him to sign, but he could not write his own nan1e. He and several others, among them my electrical engineer friend, were thrown into prision, and the government offi- cials were sure they had aii:the leaders, and that the movement had been effectually broken up. Shortly aftetwards, we reorganized the paper and :went on as before .. Fe\v of the real lead- ers had been discovered. '' \Vefound a very ingenious way to communi- cate with the prisoners. A friend of n1ine, who 'vas imprisoned with the rest, was, at the time, preparing his grad nation thesis. He \Vas allowed to send out for some literature on the subject. An1ong other things he asked for 'vas matter about a certain electrical constant. Instead of the custon1ary denotation of the constant, (the Greek letter K,) he wrote the chen1ical fonnula, NaCl. I at once noticed this, and guessed that he had written some .. thing on the paper in salt; so I dipped the paper in a silver solution, and was enabled to read his letter to me. \Ve were then allow- ed to send him some sol uti on to use in clean- ing his teeth. I also managed to send him in some blotting paper which had previously been dipped ln some che·mical. I ·would then write him a letter in this chemical and he would dip it in the tooth wash and develop it. In this manner we corresponded regularly, and by this m·eans my friend was enabled to send and re- ceive love letters to and fron1 his fiancee. 1'he correspondence was absolutely reliable, and \Vas never detected. We were kept inform.ed of what was going on in the prison, and, 'vhen the police examined outside witnesses, we were enabled so to coach them that the same evi- dence was brougl1t out as had been produced by examination within the prison. \ Then came an important turning-point in my career. We had gro\~n bolder, and had sent a delegate to the Socialistic Congress in Switzerland. 1,he police began to suspect and to watch n1y movements. They first tried to drive me out of the university by preferring charges against me to the president. They failed in this, and then I learned that they were about to arrest n1e. I decided to visit\ a theo- logical friend who lived on th~ Austrian bor- der, and wrote him a postal card so that the police might see it. As soon as I arrived at my friend's horne, I slipped across the Austrian border. I hurried to Vienna, and I then n1ade my way into S\vitzerland. The proceed- ings against me \Vere continued on the court records for several years, but nothing was ever done, and the action was finally dropped for lack of evidence. The name of tny friend is still seen frequently in foreign scientific publi- cations. \At the tin1e of my flight from Ger1nany, I was engaged in \Vriting n1y thesis, a n1a.thematical subject-very con1plex-afterwards published in Gennany. I had saved some n1oney for the publication of the thesis, but most of this went for traveling expenses. I didn't have much when I arrived at Zurich, but I rented a rootn, paid the rent for a n1onth in advance, and ga- thered my friends there for .. dinner to celebrate my es~ape. 'The next day I found I had just enough supplies to last me two days. I had .,

., ,.THE ·c·oN~CORDIENSIS. '1 pr·eviously written a book on 'Astronomy,' and had arranged to put it into the hands of a sn1all but responsible publishing house. So I wrote to the publishers for n10ney, and they agreed to give n1e thirty-seven francs (about seven dollars and thirty cents) a month. That \vas quite a lot of money for a student. Then I happened to meet one of the big lights in the democratic party, a senator. He was one of the owners of a political paper, and through him,I secured a con1n1ission to \Vrite a series of articles on popular astronotny for the paper. and a commission to write a series of letters from America for that paper. ~'hrough one of the letters I succeeded, finally, in getting a I received two dollars for each article, and one was used every t\YO or three weeks. \Before I left Germany, I had intended to become a chemist. Because I was a Socialist, I could not bring n1yself to accept a govern- ment position, and I could not have earned a living at 1nathen1atics except in a government pos1t1on. Electrical engineering really did not then amount to anything in Germany, and chen1istry seen1ed the only field in which I could tnake a good living. \Vhen I reached Switzer- land, however, I decided to take up mechanic- al engineering. I knew n1uch about a good 1nany things, but nothing by \vhich I could tnake a living. Obviously, tny political career was ended. \I had arrived in Zurich in june, 1888. I studied privately during the summer, and in the fall entered the Polytechnic School with an el- ective course made up of n1echanical engineer- ing, turbine, steam engine, bridge construction, designing, etc. A friend and I lived together, and cooked our own rneals. T'he following yeat~, n1y friend's guardian directed him to go to Atnerica, and I decided to go with him. '' \Ve sailed in the ste.erage on a French liner, paying seventy-five francs from Zurich to New York. I have crossed the ocean since, in the first cabin, but I have not had so pleasant a voyage since as was that one in the steerage. position. \\Vh.en we landed in thisc·ountry, my friend and I went to Brooklyn, New York, to live. Day after day we tramped about the great city, looking for work. One of my letters of in- troduction was addressed to Mr. Eichemeyer, who had a s:rnall electrical plant in Yonkers. I went to see him, and be promised to write to me later, about a place, but he probably for;. got about me, and I did not hear from him. 'l'hen I went to see him again and he told me to report the following Monday, and begin as draughtsman, at a salary of twelve dollars a week. l\1y friend also succeeded in getting a place, and we took up our forn1er housekeeping plan together, in a room in New York City. I had to get up very early'\ prepare breakfast, and go to Yonkers. ''Our plan worked very ·well, with but one drawback. We could n-ever ag'ree as to who should wash the dishes. We were both good cooks, and tnanaged to live cheaply and well, , but, after a year of this life, n1y friend had his fiancee cotne from Germany, and they were married. 'l'hen I tnoved to Yonkers, to be nearer my \vork.\ From a draughtsman at twelve dollars a week, able to speak English very imperfectly, ~ir. Steinn1etz has become, as I have already stated, one of the greatest of electrical engin- eers, a consulting expert to whon1 other engin- .eers are accuston1ed to go for solutions of dif- ficult problen1s. ''I could read Latin and Greek readily, and started to learn English on the ship. I carried with me two letters of introduction from the ''How did I con1e to be graduated from dra.ughting?\ he asked, i11 reply to a question. \Well it -was a very simple thing. One day Mr. Eichemeyer happened to come into the room where we were \vorking, and he was in a great rage because he had stained his fingers ,vith analine ink and could not get it off. I told hin1 to use a certain acid, diluted, and the ink would come off at once. 1~he result was as I said, all<l he was so ~lea~ed tha:t ~f~~rwarq . ~gitor of thv '}jjleqtro·t~chnische Zeitschrift,'

·a . THE CONCORDIENSIS. he invited me into his office., and we gradually became acquainted. I was able to be of some assistance to him, so he raised my salary and kept me working more with him. H·e put me in charge of all new and experimental work, and I had to look after the men, make patent drawings, and see that everything was proper- ly done at the factory. I studied every night until after midnight, and, during the first two or three years there, I wrote a number of scien- tific papers. '' It was not long before the leaders in elect- trical manufactures saw the advantagesqf com- bination, and scores of such factories as the Eichemeyer plant joined to n1ake one of the greatest electrical compani~s in the world. Each one of these smaller plants had, of neces- sity, its expert man, and, naturally enough, the combined concern needed a chief of experts. The man was ready, a man who knew, and thus the hard-working, hard-studying engineer and inventor, Steinmetz, came into his o·wn. BASEBALL BULLETIK For the past two weeks baseball practice has been fast and continual. The work has been very satisfactory and a fair number of men have turned out to it. The presence of '' Danny\ Coogan every day has proved of vast benefit to the men, and captain Griswold is especially pleased with the efficiency of Mr. Coogan's methods of coaching. Mr. Coogan is an old-timer on the diamond. He is a graduate of the University of Penn- sylvania, '95, where he played on the nine and since then has devoted most of his time to base- . ball, having coached the Wesleyan team in '98 and '99· In 1900 he assisted coach Jennings at Cornell and coached his aln1a mater's team in 1901. We welcome him tnost cordially at Old Union. As yet it is too early to attempt to give any outline as to the niake-u p of the nine,. but Cap· tain Griswold voices optimistic opinions as to the outlook. The weather was such that for three days the nine were able to get out on the can1pus where good batting practice was in- dulged in. Of last year's nine, Griswold, Heath, Brad- ley and Ellenwood have come out. O'Brien from the Law School will probably pitch again. In addition the following men came out for practice: of 1903J .A.nderson, Staeber, Van Loon; of 1904, McCombs, l{auftman, Lawsing ; of 1905, Holmes, Losee ; of 1906, In1rie, Rider, Dwight, Zim1ner, Sherman, Mooney, Harris, Chad wick, Hagar. From the Medical Department, Sweet, Cole and Schuy- ler are out practicing: Several changes have been made in the schedule, so we print it infull as it now is: April r Ith-'\Vest Point at West Point. \ I sth-Open. \ r8th-R.

He spoke of the healing of the impotent n1an at the pool, and treated his subject in a three fold manner. First as to Christ. l'hough he did not in so many words claim to be divine, yet he proved beyond all question his divinity by his acts and his mir- acles. The Jews recognized that he had made himself equal with God. Secondly as to the Jews. The man had been healed. Christ told hin1 to take up his bed and walk. 'The Jews looked at the mir- acle through a microscope rather than through a telescope. They began tq quibble about the bed or mat for that was what it was. Then the speaker referred to several books on the Jews and to work among that people. Then as to Christ's observance of the Sabbath. His argument was that the Sabbatll was made for man and not for God-and Christ was God. Some n1ay interpret the passage \And he rest- L. 1\llinkin of Union. ' The active chapter of Union was represent- ed by :Pearce, Bolles, VanLoon, Finch, l:Zider, Putnam, Smith, Ellenwood, Clark. Reed Hitt ' ' ' and Lamont. R.

On :Friday evening, March 6th, the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity entertained a small number of its friends at the Chapter House. The ~ffair was informal. Dancing was enjoy- ed ttll twelve o:Jclock. 'fhose present were: Mrs. E. E. Hall, Jr., Mrs. Hubbell Robinson and the Misses Robinson, Palmer, Howe: Smith, Green, Gates, Ostron1, VanVoast, Ful- ler, and the active chapter. ed the seventh day, etc\ that on that day God rested fron1 his labor. Not so, God never rests. If he did the entire population of the 'vorld would be sent off flying into the sun. Man needs rest. Not necessarily physical rest, but rest for the soul, rest for his spiritual being. 'J:'he subject of Sunday base ball ,vas touched upon. We should not sneer at superstitions that may bring good to any man. There may be something in it after- all and then the laugh will be on us. An inter-class track meet has been arranged to take place in the college gymnasium March 17. The events to be given are running high and broad jumps; 2o-yard high hurdle; three broad jumps; standing high jump; shot put; pole and fence vault. An entertaintnent will take place immediately after the meet.

Address all communications to THE CoNCORDIENSIS, Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. . , Rutgers- Union Debate. The a.nnual debate between Union and Rutgers is now at hand. Last year the Union team ·went down to New Brunswick and was defeated by Rutgers. This year Rutgers rneets us here in Schenectady. Every student should consider it his duty to add to the success of the debate, both by his attendance and by doing anything and everything he can to tnake the visit of the Rutgers team one to be re1ne1nbered with pleasure. The men who represented us last ye.tr were high in their praise of the treatment· and the royal en- tertainment they received at Rutgers. Let it be shown that Union knows how to entertain-that it is a college of gentlemen, and of students only too glad to do anything to support and maintain the high standard of Old Union . The Coming Track Meet. The Captain and l.Yianager of the track team have announced tb.a t au interclass track meet will be held in the gyn1nasium, on March 17th, at 7.45 p. m. This is an opportu- nity for every tnan with class and college spirit to proye his appreciation by coming out-whether he has any ability or not-· and doing all in his, power to roake the occasion a success. 'Vhile this ap- plies to every man in College, it has special re- ference to the members of the Freshman Class. In the Fall track meet some very promising mu.- terial from that class turned out. Here is an- other chance to test your ability. Let every one enter the tneet-· whether Senior, Junio1·, .Sopho- moi·e or Freshman-and help the captain and manager in their efforts to bring out the desirable material, so that when the time comes for the dual meets in the spring, Union may be repre- sented by a winning team. The following is taken in toto from the Lauren- tian, a monthly publication of St. Lawrence Uni- versity. It is particularly applicable to expres- sions of opinion not infrequently heard right here at Union. \Over a certain hotel at a certain fan1ous sum • mer resort last sun1mer was placed a large pla- card bearing the n1otto: \If you can't boost, don't knock.' It isn't very good English, but it con- tains the elen1ents of a sermon, and one which ·might profitably be scattered broadcast along wit11 that classic bit of modern prose, 'A mes- sage to Garcia.' Here at St. Lawrence 'knock- ing' has become the fad-the ruling passion. 'Vhether it proceeds from local causes, we do not know. However, it's here. We 'knock' the ath- letic teams, the council, the faculty, the life at St. Lawrence, and each other, with a disregard of mercy and, sometimes, of justice, which would do credit to a tyrant. Do we offer anything better as a substitute? Do we ' boost' when \Ye 'knock? ' Not noticeably. Our football team

I-Iow many .of those who th.us effectually tell how it should be done, can be counted on the football field the next afternoon? How many of those who criticize so~ne college institution, as for in· stance, The Laurentian, have ever contributed or att~1npted to contribute a single thing to make it better? This may be a ' knock, ' too, but we are willing to ' boost' anything that is in our line 'vith progress.'' CAMPUS NOTES.

Griswold, grand marshal; A. E. Bishop, prophet; .A .. H. Kess- ler, historian. The n1atter of a class song was left to open cotnpetition. After adjournn1ent the seniors f<>rmed a parade, led by the grand marshal, carry-ing a banner in1pressed into s-er- vicefron1 a convenient Sunday school, and bear- ing the legend '':Banner Class. \ 'I'he college office and various recitation roon1s \vere visited and the under-classes, tutors and professors serenaded. In some ca£es the freshmen were given a partial ''bolt '' at the suggestion of the visiting seniors. Class yells and other courte- sies were exchanged between the paraders and the other classes. The red building, round building and north and south college \vere in- spected by the seniors. \ Prexy,'' \ Pond,'' \Ashy ''Hoffy,\ ''Spike'' _and other \profs\ and '' tntes\ were given ovations at various points on the can1pus along the line of n1arch, all of whom responded with speeches, which were received with a great deal of en- thusiastn. After a few tnore campus manoeuvers the class filed into the philosophical laboratory and took up their al\duous tasks. The glee and instrumental clubs will give a concert in Albany on the evening of 1-farch 18. The Ri.ttcrers- Union de bate will occur in . ~ Schenectady next :Friday evening. The ques- tion to be debated is: \Resolved That it is for the public interest that every man should be able to do any lawful work at any rate of wages which nuty be agreed upon between hin1- self and his employer.\ The Union debaters, who will support the negative, are H. A. Pearce, E. T. Ruli;;on and E. V. Mulleneaux. The announcement was n1ade in Chapel Thursday n1orning, by President Ray1nond, that at last Union College is to have an athletic field that will be a credit to it in every way. The field will contain grounds for baseball and football and a running track. The site selec- ted is the open space j~tst west of Lenox Road on the north side of North Co 11 ege Lane. The consent of the board of trustees n1ust be secur- ed befor~ work can be begnn, but in the mean- tin1e con1plete plans and specifications will he made and placed in the hands of contractors for their bids. rresident Raytnond added that the gentle- man responsible for this announcement, is a graduate of the college, but that he objected to the mention of his natne in this connection. I-Ie undertook this work with a desire to en· courage the students in all their athletic en- terprises. MEDICAL COLLEGE. On Tuesday night, February 24th, the Sophomores banqueted at the Globe Hotel, the Juniors and Freslunennotwithstanding, though the last nan1ed classes did their best to render the function a fizzle. The trouble began early in the afternoon. 1'he Freshrnen laid violent hands on Williatn Dwyer, president of tbe Sophomore class, and

12 THE OONCORDIENSIS. took hin1 to a house on Jefferson street, where one of their nu tnber roomed. As soon as it was possible, the Freshmen secured a hack and started to convey Dwyer to __ a safer place of confinement. lYle an while, news of his plight reached sotne of his classn1ates, and a number of them appeared on the scene who succeeded, after a lively scrap, in releasing Dwyer, who attended the banquet. Deeming it safer to attend the dinner in a body, the Sophomores gathered at the Phi Sigtna l{appa House, the Freshn1en and their associates, a few Juniors, assembling· on the outside. vVhen the Sophon1ores started down town, very naturally another fracas occurred, and sotne fear-stricken citizen telephoned for the police, who dispersed the crowd. 'The Sopho·mores reached the hotel without further trouble. A few of the Sopho1nores, however, did not con1e with the main· squad', and had considerable difficulty in getti11g through the cordon the Freshmen had drawn about the hotel. 'fhese isoloated Sophomores were easily rescued by their classmates, who sallied forth from the hotel to their relitf. 'fhe Freshmen must certainly be congratulat- ed for displaying more nerve than they have here- tofore exhibited, even though they had moral and physical backing of sotne husky Juniors. rrhe Sophomores are hoping that some tin1e before May, the lower class n1ay get together enough rnen and ducats to also hold a banquet. Charles \V. Stratton acted as toast-master and proved a good man for the place. 1'he following students responded to toasts:-- ''Class of rg o 5,, president, \Villi am M. Dwyer; ''\Vhy\ or \It Georg.e vV. Pap en; ''The l~ate of a Bachelor,'' Charles W. Hack- er; \Reminiscence \Villiam G. Romtnel; \Physicians' Relation to the Laity,\ J. W. White; \Temptation of a 'Medic','' Oscar F. Larson; \Double Educati-on,\ George 'Val- rath. Those present at the banquet were Messrs Blackfan, Bushnell, Chappelle, Coffin, Comth- waite, Coughlin, Cowell, Crane, Croissan-t, Curtis, Donahoe, Dwyer, Flanagan, Flynn, Garlock, Hacker, 1-Iays, Hemstreet, Hull, Hurlbut, Hurley, Larson, Maloney, Papen,- Reece, Rommel', Rulison, Schaible, Schermer- horn, Schirck,Schuyler, Stratton, Sweet, Vines, Warner, \\Taterbury, vValrath, \Vhite, and \Vii- son.

Kentucky and the Cumberl~nd Moun- tains The dawn of a bright Spring day in those~ ~lorious perfumed regions of rhododendrons \ and sweet ·birches, came glowing frotn the East. The birds awoke ; the sky changed from gray to saffron ; from saffron to the rose- ate color of rich wine. The ·wind rocked the tall spruce trees softly ; they n1oaning as in some untold anguish. The surface of the lit-' tle stream that ran gurgling over the rocks down the side of the n1ountain was dotted with sweet-seen ted. bl osson1s of the mountain laurel. The sun, which had topped the trees, cast wavering shadows across the brook, the while painting it with gl.o·wing colors. By the streatn ran a little path. Down the path walked a man. He was limping.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 13 The citizens of that county in l{entucky knew well that there was a feud, and a dead- \ly one, between the Perry and Covert famil- ies. They ·were ordinary mountain people ; only their blood had been raised. Ned Con- vert used to run an illicit still and one of the Perry boys had guided the reve1~ue offi- cers to it. That was the cause of the feud, and at the time of this incident it was two years old. Already three lives had been sacrificed and still the deadly hatred between the two families continued. But there was one excep- tion. Eliza, only daughter of Ned Covert, loved and was loved by Gabriel Perry. he dusk; with tlv~ cows cotning h.otne \vith their tinkling bells ; how she used to lean her arms on the bars to the gap and look fax across the purpling mountains with a sublin1e light in her eyes, and how he stood at such n1oments look- ing at her, lost i.1 r·tpture. But he can1e to hitns elf with a start, then trudged on down the mountain with a fearful uacertainty in his 'I'he springs of affection between·these young.· people had begun to flow longbefore the feud. Many a time in the years gone before had they replighted their troth ; often in the twilight on the mountains, when the soft sweet sound of cattle bells came from the valley far below. Often in the evenrng when the work for the day was over, would Gabriel visit her at her home, and there they would sit by the fire, after the lights were lit and talk of the future. All seetned bright and full of con1fort within, but the screech-owl wailed from a: rotten limb near by and the wolves howled on the distant mountains, seeming to tell of a time when alL this happiness would be no more. The time, as 1ve know, did come. The feud was in exis- tence. Gabriel Perry went down the mountain that morning by the rhododendron path. He had been wounded ; moreover, a Covert had done it. He limped on painfully, leaving a tiny red trail on the moss. He- had decided ; the f~ud n1ust stop and this must be accomplished by the annihilation of the Covert family. Noth- ing short of this would suffice. He thought with a sickening heart that Eliza n1ust be warn- ed when they intended to attack ; but would she take it? Wo-uld she not stand by her family? Yes he knew she would not desert them. A ' wave of feeling swept over him as he thought of the old days when h~ used to stand by her in heart. A week later and the old ravines and n1oun- tains of the Cutnberland resounded with rifle shots. The Perrys h1.d attacked the Coverts, and now it was to be a fi.:;;ht to the death. Al- ready Ned Covert was shot ; the bullet struck him fair in the breast, anJ throwing up his hands convulsively with a startled questioning look on his face, he fell back with a groan on the moss. Rifles seen1ed to speak fro1.n be- hind every rock and tree. Fred, the youngest of the Perry boys, who was reloading his rifle behlnd a tree, sudden1y gave a sharp cry and turning half vvay around sank down with a line of red staining his shirt. Gabriel swore ven- geance. He stooped to pick up a cartridge which had fallen from his belt and in doing so, exposed hin1self for an instant from the rock behind which he was hiding. As he bent over he heard a sharp report an~ he felt a twinge of pain, now hot, then cold, and he knew he had been shot. The sky grew black ; the sound of running water came to his ears and he seemed to be falling, down, down. Perry regained consciousness with a start and there, kneeling by him, was Eliza Covert. She was weeping. When she saw his eyes open she sank down lower and pressed his hot brow with her hands. There was agony in her face and in her voice as she moaned- \ Oh Gabriel, it was I, I shot you ; but I could not help it, you shot tny father. But Gabriel, Oh my poor boy ! this will kill me ! I love you as never before. Everyone else is gone and now you are leaving me! \ She faltered ; Perry tried to rise but a sharp pain shot under his heart, and, glancing at his

14 THE OONCORDIENSIS. breast he saw a dull red stain. He raised his arm a11d passed it across his mouth; there also was the crin1son sign; he knew he was a dead n1~tn. \Eliza he tnurmured, ''Good bye tny love; Ah, God, it is hard to die now !'' '!'the girl hen t ]ow and kissed hin1 on the brow, and Perry, closing his eyes with a sigh of happiness, passed within the .gates. Y. M. C. A. ELECTION. On 'Tuesday evening, l\iarch 3, theY. 1\L C.

D., President of the State Nor- tnal College, Albany; Hon. George Adding- ton, District Attorney of Albany County. \\Velcoming Address By President l{ay- mond: -We are very glad to greet this evening the representatives of Rutgers for this debate between the undergraduates of the two in- stitutions. This debate is one expression of the friendly interest 'vhich these· institutions have maintained for a great many years. 'fo us who are familiar with the history of Union College, it is significant that a graduate of Rutgers, Dr. Van Dirch Romeyn, formerly pastor of the First Reformed Church of this city, was more responsible than any other man for the origin of Union College and its charter, and Union repaid her debt of gratitude to Rutgers to a very great degree, when year after year she sent her students for instruction , in the theological sen1inary which was connect- .. ed with Rutgers in those days, and had for a great many years a professorship (?) in Rut- gers, so that the relationship between these tvvo institutions has been very intimate for more than a hundred years. The subject which is to be discussed to-night is one of special interest, '' Resolved, that it is for the public interest that ev-ery man should be able to do any 1 awful work at any rate of wages which may be agreed upon between him- se'tf and his employer.\ The representativ-es of Rutgers have the affirn1ative, the represent- aHves of Union the negative. You will notice that the opening arguetnent of each speaker is to be limited to ten minutes. Notice will be given at the end of nine rninutes, so that the speaker will know when he is approaching the end of his argument. The closing arguments are limited to five minutes. It gives me great pleasure to present the first speaker, Mr Bert- ram J. Hotaling. Hotaling.- We have come here to debate up- on labor organizations only so far as they re- strain individual freedom. This subject can be divided into four heads: first, economical; second, legal ; third, 1noral ; and fourth, socL al. The first is the one allotted to me for con- sideration. The restriction of individua 1 freedotn in the contract of wages impedes the growth of Amer· ican interests. It is for the benefit of the A- n1er~ican people that every n1an should receive good wages. A low rate of 'vages to all em- ployees is unfair to the employees, and a uni- form high rate is unfair to the employer. The restriction of bargaining for wages is inl- pairing American prosperity. Raising the rate of wages to all en1ployees compels the manu- facturer to raise the price of his product, and the result is deplorable. In the last twenty

TilE CONCORDIENSIS. years, by the attempt to restrict individual freedom of wages, there have been lost to this country m,ore than four million dollars. You know well that it is a fundamental economical principle that the prosperity of a country depends upon the wide distribution of its wealth. These strikes tie up large quantities of material in warehouses and factor- ies, and as a consequence the nation suffers. In the recent coal strike the distribution of coal almost ceased, so that many factories had to shut down and untold misery was caused to the poorer class. The restriction of individual freedom of con- tract of ,wages is not for the public interest be- cause it destroys our agriculture and because it impedes the growth of American industry,· because it has diminished our productions, be- cause it has hindered distribution. Elbert V. Mulleneaux. --In this question we find three points which must be emphasized: public interest ; every man ; any rate of wages. We shall endeavor to prove that some men should not have the right to work for any rate of wages agreed upon between themselves and their employers, and in so proving, we shall have shown that it is not true that every man should have it. In our large cities we find an institution which is very dangerous to the American con1monwealth, the sweat-·shop system, where employees are huddled together like sheep in a pen. In these sweat shops men work for any rate of · wages they can get, but that rate is almost too small to enable thetn to purchase even the dire necessities of life, and as a result a large amount of sickness and suffering is caused, and this is surely not for the public interest. You remember how formerly the Chinaman vvas allowed to con1pete with American labor, but that he worked for so little as to almost shut the American laboring class out of employ- ment altogether, and the government was com- . pelled th take measures restricting Chinese la- bor. Doctors and lawyers have often standard fees below which they may not go, and this is cer- tainly a benefit to the community. Christianity teaches us self-sacrifice for the benefit of the community. Thus a man should give up certain rights for the benefit of the community, and the doctrine which allows a man to pay starvation wages does not comply with this principle. Emil E. Fischer,-In considering the legal side of this question there is no room for doubt .. While the constitution of the United States and the laws of the different states support the affirmative, they do not contain a single clause which supports the negative. No organization should be allowed to interfere with the rights of the individual, with the rights of the employ- er. The laws which are passed in favor of la- bor unions are often passed by legislators be- cause their remaining in office depends upon it. But no organization should control the wages of a n1an in opposition to the government. Jn considering the moral side, control of wages is not for the public interest. A man is held in check by a uniform rate of wages. It is unfair· to the poor workman, and to the skillful. Their moral as well as their social individuality is lost. Strikes are caused by uni- form rate of wages, and when m,en take the law into their own hands, it has a demoralizing iufluence upon the people. Elbert 1\'. Rulison, J r.-Before the ne- gative can prove that every man should be al- lowed to work for any rate of wages agreed upon, they must show that organizations are directly opposed to public interest, and should therefore be swept away and entirely eliminat- ed. But these labor unions cannot be swept away. Untold n1isery would be broughtabout if they were. There is; no doubt, a certain amount of harm in them, but there is also a vast amount of good being done in securing legislature against evil measures. such as child labor and the sweat shop. The result of individual COJ11petion is demor- alizing to the cotnmunity, and therefore not be II

II THE OONOORDIENSIS. allowed. Two men coming from the country to work in the city, one with a family, the other without, teceive the same wages. This is mani- festly unfa-ir to the man with a family, and labor unions are formed to prevent such un- justness. Nothihg would cause public opinion to drop away from their side more quickly than disregard for the law, but in any case violence done on the principles for which labor unions stand is morally right. Martin L. Schenck.-1\'he social side of the question is the one I have chosen to arg:ue. The strength of a nation depends upon the strength of its members, upon the individual. Labor unions destroy this individuality. The union fixes the individual's wages, decides how long he shall work, and in fact almost lives for him. Thus the right which every man pos- esses to make the best of himself is lost. Loss of individuality means loss to the public, be- cause strikes are the result. During the past twenty years there has been a thousand strikes a year. Labor and capital in hostile camps. This is certainly not for the public interest because loyalty to government is therefore destroyed. These unions breed socialism, for they teach their 1nembers that the wealth of the capitalists belong to them. Again men of superior skill are not reward- ed for excellence, but receive the same wages as a poorer workn1an. The labor unions de- nland the same wages and same hours and same every thing for all men, as if no one ·were better than his neighbor. The Lord would undoubtedly have made all men alike, if he had intended them to enter labor unions. Less than twenty per cent of the laboring men in this country belong to labor unions. Is it for the public interest that these twenty per cent try to take away the liberty of the other eighty per cent? In a recent srike a street railway company discharged two thoroughly incompetent men. The .. interest of the public demands the dis- charge of such men, but the unions demand their re~titq.tion. 7 and go on a strike if their de,mands are not granted. Is this for the pub- lic interest ? In this case the company hired non-union men to run their cars. Whereupon the union men blocked the tracks, attack the employees, and prevented the cars from run~ ning. Hovv is this. for the public intereit? What right has the union man to say that the non-union man shall not work ? There is no law of God or man to support the negative side of the question. Henry A. Pearce.-My colleagues have shown that the doctrine of the affirmative is contrary to public interest. Let every man talk as he pleases, conditions will finally right themselves. It is evident that the principles upheld by the affirmative are the same as those supported by the ''Laissez faire '' doctrine, which led to the French Revolution. Individuals, by foregoing their rights and 1naking common cause with the whole body of workers, may receive thereby a lasting bene- fit. The sacrifice of individual rights is some- times for the general good. Thus it is evi- dent that it cannot be for the public interest if men are allowed to work at any rate of wages agreed upon between their employe~ and themselves. Closing Address by Hon. D. Cady Herrick.- We desire to congratulate both speakers upon the varied interest and scholarly exhibition that they have given us this evening. The de- bate shows pretty thorough consideration of the subject, and shows, too, upon the part of the participants not only labor, but a very excel- lent English style of address. It is not an easy matter for young men, and even for those who are not young, to go upon the stage and e~press themselves in good, clear, distinct English style, and these young gentlemen are to be coi1gratulated that they have been able to do so. Without making any further remarks about either team, we would say that we have taken into consideration the arguments, attitudes, the style of the speaker, and the manner of g~livery, ancl combinin~ ~H th~5e to~eth~r

8 THE '00NCORDIENSIS. have formed our judgment as to which team the debate should be awarded, and we have de- cided it should be awarded to Rutgers. About a hundred students and five hundred friends and alumni were present and general good feeling prevailed. Pres. Raymond and Dr. Hale occupied the stage with the contes- tants. 1,he glee club led the singing of Union songs and while the judges were preparing their decision a couple of Rutgers songs were sung by the glee club and were heartily ap- pla~ded by the Rutgers men. FRESHMEN WIN INDOOR MEET EASILY. Held in the Gym on March 17. The in-door inter-class athletic meet, held in the gymnasium, on Tuesday evening, was won easily by the freshmen, who scored more points than the three other classes together. The total number of points was 99, of which 52 went to the Freshmen, I 8 to the Seniors, . 17 to~ the Sophomores, and 12 to the Juniors. Ray Reeder did the best work for I9o6, obtaining \~points, though he was closely followed by Waldron with 12. '· Altogether the tneet was a Sl!lccess. A charge of twenty-five cents was made for admission, and the management was very well pleased with the manner in which the students turned out. The Glee Club furnished a little music between the acts, and those. who could smoke Turkish Trophies were allowed to have one apiece by the smoker committee after the meet. Hodgson, 'oi, Mr. Wheeler, from the faculty, and Dr. L. Faust, of Schenectady, acted as judges; \Bid Paige and Dr. Towne as start- ers. Golden, 'o1, was the time-keeper, Fenster, 'o3, official scorer, and Guardinier, 'o4, clerk of the course. The events and winners were as follows: 20 yard dash.-vVon by Ray Reeder, 'o6, tin1e 3 1-5 sec; Pearce, 'o3, znd place; Clark, '04, 31\d.

Advantage has been taken of the unusually fine weather to keep the men out on the cam- pus, and the practice of the last week has been of a very lively nature. Six men have con1e up from the Albany Departments, Sweet, Schuy- ler and Flynn from the Medic, and Cheney, Bennett and Bingham from the I.~aw. It is • thought that there is good .material in these men, and we note with pleasur~, .. that Sweet and Bingham are both strong candidates for

As yet the practice has been con- fined largely to batting, as the ability to handle the stick is a very important one to cultivate. Several suit measuren1ents were taken during the week. We regret that ''Danny '' Coogan has to leave us for a couple of weeks while he is down at University of Pennsylvania. 'fwo important changes have been made in the schedule. Instead of Rochester at Roches- ter on May 2nd, the management has arranged a game with Columbia for that date on the campus. Also the game with Colgate on May 5th will take place in Albany instead of Hamilton. rfhis gives us two games at Ridgefield in Albany, the other being that with R. P. I., on June 6th. At ptesent Mgr. Donnan has arranged for seven games on the cam pus and there are still two open dates on the schedule. Considerable interest can be awakened in town by talking about the ·team, the various men, the schedule, etc. Advertisement of this kind will have a good effect and will bring the townspeople up to the games. 1,here is a very interesting article on Ameri- can Undergraduate J ournalistn, by L. G. Price, in this tnonth's Bookman. It deals with the various kinds of College publications, mention- ing the first as the Gazette, which Daniel Webster started at Dartmouth College in 18oo. Since that time J ournalisn1 has been very active so that now every college has various publications. 1,here are twelve dailies, the Havard Crimson, the Yale News, the Cornell Daiiy Sun and the Daily Princetonian, being the oldest of these. Among college comic papers, t~e Harvard Lampoon is mentioned as the oldest and probably the best known. The article says, ''In all respects except the drawings, several of these comic papers con1e dangerously near the high standard of the best professional humorous papers. The Cornell Widow, owing _partly to the influence of Cornell's excellent school of architecture, stands especially high in its iU ustration~. ,., lVIention is made of the literary magazines, usually.monthlies, especial· ly the Harvard 1\tionthly, which is considered by son1e the best college paper published. Among the weeklies, published by the small- er colleges the Union 'Concordiensis is spoken of as a very creditable weekly. The Williams \Veekly and the Amherst Student are also very well spoken of. Annuals are published at every college, usually by editors elected from the Junior clasi. The Union Garnet is mentioned among others. Altogether the article is well worth reading. Prof. S. G. Ashmore lectured at Syracuse University, on Tuesday evening, Mar. 1oth. His subject, which he illustrated with the lantern slide, was '' l''he Remains of Ancient Rome. \ 1\'he Chi Psis will give a college dance at their Lodge on Apr. 17th. ----- The following men have passed entrance English: Beers, Broderick, Cantwell, Dwight, Haight, Hitt l(auf:inan, Peebles, Sherman, Stoney, 'Vebb. The Schenectady Chapter of A. I. E. E., held an important meeting irt Silliman Hall, Tuesday evening, March 17th. The follow- ing papers were presented and discussed ; Axle Lighting, Elmer A. Sparry; An Electric- al Car Lighting System, W. L. Bliss ; An Axle-Car Lighting System, w: I. Schlichter. Ass't. Treas. Pond has notified all students, who room in middle or North Section, North College, to remove their effects from the rooms on or before March z8th, in order that the necessary changes may be begun.

Address all communications to THE CoNCORDIENSIS, Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. A Sophomore was heard to remark not long ago · that since he had been in college he had never been '' struck '' by a class collector to pay up a single sub· scription, and he added that he wasn't going to pay up his baseball dues until the collector came around for the money. Now this may argue a certain incapacity on the part of the collector to fulfill the duties of his office ; but does the laxity of a collector release a man from his obligation to college activities ?-that is, if he is a man? It's a rather lame excuse and a rather feeble argument to say that your class collector is to blame for your not having paid your subscription. Why is it necessary, when the manager is working, when the coach is working, when the captain is work· iag,. when each m~m individually is working totturn out a good , team-when the chances are exceptionally bright for a good team.;:..why is it always necessary eternally to hound .a man and threaten to publish his name in the C<>ncor:diensis if he doesn't pay up? Why don't Union nun pay their subscriptions? How can we make them Fealize that the schedule can't be ratified until the cash is in? What excuse has a man who takes in Julia Marlowe and '' A Chinese Honeymoon \ in one week ? Why, for once, don't Union men hunt up the collector or manager and pay up? Why? It is to be hoped that steps will be taken in the near future to perfect some arrangement whereby the inter· collegiate debates may become a permanent feature of Union college life. No little enthusiasm was shown by the ·students at the debate with Rutgers, last Friday evening, and st,tch enthusiasm augurs well far the per· manency of the institution which called it forth. It seems as necessary for Union to fall into line with ether colleges in debating as it has been in the matter ef athletics . While we by no means underestimate the immense value ·of athletics as a factor which stimulates whole- some growth in student life, in our estimation the stu- dent's devotion to his athletics at times may cause him to lose sight of that summum bonum of a college course -a broad and well trained mind. Mens sana in cor- p<>re sano, too often is translated, \A sound body as• sures a sound mind.\ Why all this talk ! It is for the simple reason that at Union there is a considerable number of men who possess some ability in the debating line and who should have the opportunity to develop their powers in frequent matched debates before the public, and a series of intercollegiate debates each year would afford them such an opportunity. Rutgers has long recognized this principle and the ex· cellent showing made by her representatives last week proves its efficiency in practice. The management of the Track team should have every reason to expect an unusually successful season, judging from the work done at the indoor meet Tues· day evening. The freshmen showed up in good form but should remember that it is always the duty of the newcomer to do his best and say the least. The less

COLLEGE MEETING Meeting called to order with president Bolles in the chair. Mr Fenster gives a report of the class collections for the Rutgers-Union de- bate. Mr Fenster also reports the expenses of the debate. Hunt asks Fenster if the sub- scriptions would pay all the expenses of the de bate and is answered in the affirmative by the committee. Gulnac speaks about subscriptions and urges prompt payment. Staeber proposes a committee to have the trustees put the campus tax in the catalogue. Staeber puts this in the fonn of a motion which is seconded by Hunt after some discussion on his part. He thinks that the catalogue should state that all students are to pay a campus tax of ten dollars. Captain Pearce of the track team speaks of the track meet in the gyn1nasium and about the necessity of prompt payment of subscrip- tions. President Bolles calls on the treasurers of every class for reports. Landreth 11-1akes a report for the c_lass of I 905. Griswold speaks on the necessity of having the subscriptions paid and Hunt moves that the Fraternities as- sutne the obligations of their members for baseball and track subscription. Mulineaux amends the motion by moving that some one report for neutrals. Staeber and Gulnac make remarks on the motion. Parker says that Fraternities should co-operate with the class collectors. Tillott agrees with Parker. Griswold speaks. Howe amends Hunt's _motion that Fraterni- \\ ties should co-operate with the collectors. Seconded. Fenster speaks. Howe amendment carried.

From the Ithaca viewpoint Cornell's foot_ ball, schedule next year is likely to be decided- ly unsatisfactory, says an Ithaca dispatch to the Syracuse Post-Standard. As yet not a single big game has been arranged for Ithaca and it is probable no team will be met on the home gridiron of enough consequence to war- rant an alumnus in traveling very many miles to witness the game. The big disappointing feature of the schedule will be the absence of the Princeton game at Ithaca. Ever since r894 Cornell and the tigers have met annually, the contest alternating between Ithaca and Princeton. N O\V, however, Princeton has taken the same stand. that Harvard did. 'fhe two year agreement expired last year, when Cornell played at Tigertown, and the management there refuses to tnake an agreement which will require that they come to Ithaca every year. In effect, the Princeton authorities assert that Cornell must either play the con- test in Princeton or New York city. It is certain that Cornell would not listea to a proposition which would require that the game be played in Princeton every year.

THE OONOOBDIENSIS. 13 ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. I 904 held its Junior banquet at the N·ew Kenmore, on Thursday evening, the 12th. inst., where covers 'vere laid for forty, and a jolly good tin1e was enjoyed by all. The :excellent n1enu provided by proprietor Murphy was as follows: Rockaway Oysters, Chicken Okra a la Creole, Radishes, Olives, 1\tfedallion of Saln1on Genoise, Potatoes Pers- si:lade, Cutlets of Sweetbreads, Mushroo.ms, Green peas, 1\'inlbales of Rice Milanais, Sor- bet au Kuch, Philadelphia Capon au cresson, Sa lade de Saison, N esselrode Ice Cream, Fan- cy ·cakes, ~facaroons, Lady Fingers, Den1i 1~asse. William C. Roche of Troy n1ade an excellent Toastmaster, and provoked .much merriment ' by his witty introductions of the various speak- ers. \The Class\ was toasted by President Louis :B. Shay, of Morton, N. Y. The lights and shadows of \Daily Routine\ were por- trayed by Mark B. Bennitt, of Han1mondsport, N. Y., while M. B. McKelvey, of Waterford, N~ Y., spoke on \The Strenuous Life.\ These \Vere foliowed by Maurice B. Flinn, of Albany, who delivered a hutnerous recitation. Lee F. Frisbee, of Elmira, N. Y., delivered himself on the subject of \ Legislation,\ and Daniel A. Dugan, of Fishkill, N. Y.. discours- ed on'' The Lawyer in Politics.\ ''He tnust be Guilty '' was the subJect as- signed to Edward Easton, Jr., of Loudonville, N. Y., and \How the h 1 can he? \ the title of the response of '\Villi am 1~. Byrne, of Albany, N. Y. What the real subject of these last two toasts was., no one but the Juniors thetnselves will ever know-and they are not telling. Those who attended the feast were Bahler, 13ou ton, Bootey, Brown, Byrne, Biggan, :Bennitt, Cahill, Cooper, Cramer, Con way, Diefendorf, Devoe, Drummond, Dugan, Easton, Flinn, Frisbee, Hatt, Jamieson, La~iarche, McCar- thy, McFarren, Morse, 11cElvey, O,Reilly, Roberts, Roche, Roos, Salyerds, Shay, Smith, Sutton, 1.,obin, Throop, J. \ 7 an Allen, Henry W. Van Allen, Harold \'Vilson, and Robert N. 'Vilson. Judge Chester, of the Appellate Division, recently conducted a n1ost interesting course of special lectures to the Seniors upon ''the Federal Judicial System.\ ------ The subject for the E(h:rard 1\hotnpson Con1pany prize tl~esis, as announced March roth, is \ Procedure.\ The thesis must con- tain not less than 4500 nor more than sooo words, and must be submitted by Iviay 1st. The prize is a set of the American and English Encyclopedia of Law or the Encyclopedia of Pleading andpractice, at the winner's option. Only candidates for a degree are allowed to compete. Secretary Davidson is preparing the annual catalog, which \viH go to press in a few days. It 1nay be here remarked that the catalog of the Albany Law School, amply illustrated and finely printed as it is, is without question the most attractive book let issued by any of the An1erican Law Schools, and reflects great.£redit upon its compiler. John P. Badger, Jr., I 903 is confined to the Albany Hospital. Mr. Eadger has been n1ost unfortunate in the matter of illness since com .. mencing his course at the school, and his class- mates are most solicitous for his recovery. The Senior banquet, which was scheduled to occur within a few weeks, will probably be de- ferred until commencement week. l~awless, 'o3, received a box of candy by mail recently. Ask his classmates about it. Judge Landon takes up \Evidence\ with the Seniors on March 16th.

:\ 14 THE CONOORDIENSIS. THE M.ANAGEM.ENT SPEAKS. The baseball management desires to an- nounce to the student body that the names of Thompson, 'os, and Patton, 'os, have be~n registered as candidates for Asst. baseball manager. These men will assist the regular class collectors in collecting the regular base- ball subscription. The recommendation given by the manage- ment just previous to election will be based upon the work done by these men, and as their principal work will be collecting, ~ach student can best support his candidate by paying hin1 his subscription at once. H. s. OLMSTED, , 04, Asst. J\1ngr. OLYMPIAN GAMES. Friday night, after the Rutgers-Union de- bate, nearly the entire Freshman classgather- ed in a body around l\1emorial Hall, and built a huge bonfire out of the woodwork recently taken from the don1e gf that building. After giving class and college yells, they entered the building and removed many of the statues to the base ball diamond. Nearly every position in the in and out field was occu- pied by a plaster of Paris statue. Minerva was at the bat, while Pallas support- ed first base. The Discobolus was very prop- erly put in the pitchers box; Socrates umpired, while Cupid coached fron1 the side lines. The dia:mond early Saturday ·morning pres- ented a very striking appearance, and until Superintendant Clute removed the sno\v_.white players back to to their pedistals in the Round building, the campus wore a truly Olympian aspect. Hickok, 'o2, Keogh, 'oz, and Fitzpatrick, ex 'o3, who were amo~g those who passed the January Bar Examinations, were sworn in at the term of the Appellate Division held March 1oth. The registration days for the work of nex tenn are as follows: Wednesday, March 2sth 9 to I 2; Thursday, !vi arch 26th 8 :3o to 12 and 2 :30 to 4 :3o ; Friday, March 27th, 8:30 to I 2 and 2 :30 to 4 :3o; Saturday, March 28th, 8 :3o to r I. Professor Frank B. \Villiams recently visited several of the neighboring colleges for the pur- pose of obtaining facts and information relative to running tracks. His trip was made in view of securing· sufficient data to enable the college authorties to forn1 plans for the prospective athletic oval.
