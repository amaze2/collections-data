Although such a large number exception to this rule, f0r the harmonies of the occas:on were altogether complete. The best spirit pervaded the mezzanine; the music, con- sisting of Rubens and six pieces, was all that could be desired; the .f\)freshments were dainty artd admirably .served, and e:xcellent manage- m.ent was evident in every detail. The attend- an.ce was most gratifying. Prominent among the guests was Mrs. Charles E. Hughes, the wife of Governor Hughes. The patronesses ot the affair were Mrs. Charles E. Hughes, Mrs. M.

.THE ·CONCORDTENSIS The· 'Tapestry W eav.ers The poetn we print be1ow was written by a \\Nell-known [inion rnan, Anson G. Cheste.r of Buffa.lo. Mr. Chester wrote the poem about twenty--fl. Ve yea:cs a.go and: s~ince then it bas been translated into In.any diffe'l!ent ianguages and is known in an parts of the world.-Eds. * * .:j: I Let ue take to our hearts a lesson---no lesson can braver be- ~rom the ways of the ta..pestry weavers on Uu.e other side of the sea. Above their heads the pattern hangs, they study it with care, The while their fingers deftly move, their eyes are fastened there. They tell this curious thin~ beside of the patient, plodding weaver: He works on the wrong side evermore, but works for the right side ever. It is only when the weaving stops, and the web is loosed and turned, 'rhat he sees his real handiwork, that his mar- velous skill has learned. Ah, the sight of its delicate beauty, how it pays him for an his cost! No rarer, daintier work than his was ever done lJy the frost. 'Then the 1na.ster bringeth him golden hire, and giveth him praise as well, ,\nd how happy the heart of the weaver is no tongue but his ovvn can tell. II. The years of men are· the looms of God, let down frorn the place of the sun, Wherein we a.re weaving ever, till the mystic web is done. vVeaving hlindiy, hut weaving sureiJ:y,, ea.ch.. :for himself h.is fa:te- \\Ve rrray not see how the ri~lrt side looiks·, we can only- weave and wait. ' . i- I Bu:t, look:ing above for the pattern, no wea.ver Pattern i:s there. hath need to ]ear, • )nly let him look clear i:nto· Heaven, the Perfect if he keeps the face of THEI S.A VI OUR forever and always in sight, His ton shall be sweeter than honey, his weaving is sure to be right. And whe1a the work is ended, and ihe Web is turned and shown, He shaH hear the voice of The Master,. it shall say unto him \Well done!\ And the white-winged angels of Heaven, to bear him thence shall come down; Ancl God shall give hinr his hi.re-not coin, but a glowing crown! -Anso11 G.

Publication Office, ScHENECTADY GAZETTE. JUNIOI-=t WEEK Faculty and students alike unite in wel- colning the round of festivity. The F'ac- ulty, in accord with the necessity of main- taining a cabn cornposure and a digni:fied den1·eanor, clicl not recognize the fact that the joyful honr had con1e until yesterday- that is, it did not officially. However, one of the gravest of this serious body was hearcl to agree to the suggestion that the recognition began long ago. N otwithstancl- i·:lg assertions to the contra~ry, we believe that such was the feeling 1nanifested by all. In very trnth the pleasant anticipation began ages ago and continues even to the present hour. Were it not for an occa- sional in vas ion of our sacred precincts by the fair sex, our life here would 1nost as- sureclly fail to he colored with any hue, -except possibly the greenish-yellow of fhat fruit which son1e 1nodern pliocenes insist was given to Father Adam by a fair one in no way con1parable to those who are now sheltered in these old grey confines. And so we are joyful that the n1erry round is still continuing and will not cease even after we shall have returned to earth and to the cold reality of tnaking \firsts\ every clay in the week. A.lumni Notes On the evening of Feb. 4th, the ·wiashington Alumni Assodation of Union University held a b£tnquet at the Shoreham Hotel in. Washing- ton, D. C.

Sargen.t, director of the Hen~enway gymnasium at Harvard, has been at work dur- ing the fall on a new game which resembles basketbalL This new ga·me can be played by either 12 or 16 men, on a field 10 0 feet square. There are four goals on the sides of the field, the two opposite goals being defended by the same team. The field is marked out with a 25-foot square in each corner and a .50 -foot square in the center, the remaining space in front of the goals being occupied by two goal-keepers and two opponents. In the eenter square there are eight men, four of eaefi team, and in eaeh .smaH square, two men \)il opposing sides. The men are not allowed ,to leave · their assigned territory. The rules of the game are very much like those of basketball except that the kind of goals and tne method '(}f scoring is essentially different,. and intended to develop a more in- teresting game. 'The ban, which is the same as the one used in basketball, must be thrown or kicked through a g-ual six feet high ant.l defended by two goal-keepers. A goal thrown from the center square counts three, thrown from the side squares two, and kicked from the side squares one. As. other colleges have already adopted the game, i.t:s permane:acy is no longer a matter o{ conjecture.

I, THE CoNcoRD IEN:SIS VOL. XXX. UNION COLLE,GE, FEB. 16, 1907 No. 16 PR.:OF. WILLIAMS RESIGNS rro Go to Clal'li: Universi~y Next Year The news was published last week that Frank B. vVilHams, Assistant Professor of Eng.ineer- ing and Mathematics, will resign his position here to accept a similar one at Clark Univer- ::;ity, Worcester, .Mass. Prof. vV.Uliams took a course in post-graduate work at this university pdor to becoming allied with Union. Prof. Williams will re:rnain here until June, his resignation not going into effect until that tilne. Student Life at the University of Madrid The foUo'\ving article appeared in the \Miami Student\ for January and is from the pen of Om.en T.Z. Boring .-Ed. * * * The Universidad Central (Central University) is probably the best of the Spanish Universities. There are the Faculties of L,itera ture and of Science, of Law, of Pharmacy, and of E.ngineering. About three thousand students attend, and not one co-ed to be found. Young ladies who' desire more than a common school education, go either to pri- vate schools, where they g'et a smattering of music, French, and dressmaking, or to a convent. The universities of Spain are controlled by the central government. Students who enter are re- quired to have the. bachelor's degree from some Instituto. A student enters the Instituto a:dter completing his c01nmon school education. The work here covers six years and is. practically equal to 0 1 Jr high school course and two years in college. 1..,hey are controlled either by the state, the church, or private individuals. The -same is true also of the comrn•on schools. E·ducation in Spain is not con1.pulsory and many people are too poor to· ~eep their ·children in school, but are compeUed to send the1n out on the streets to sell pa.pers, or to· do anything by which a penny n1.a.y be made. Spain, hackward in this as in ·many things, ·is slowly be- ginning to rec,1gnize the hnportance of training the youth and the day will come when education· will be cmnpulsory. 'I\here is a great deal of spirit and life a.mong the students; not loyalty to a particular institu- tion or faction, but a general student spirit. There are no inter-university games or contests, no liter- ary societies or fra ternUies. A commendable fea- ture is the sticking together as a unit on any ques- tion affecting the student body as a whole. There are no factions, but all unite in the· co-mmon cause without friction or jealousy. There is a Union Escolar (Scholastic Union) o·r- ganized by the students, not secret in character, but corresponding somewhat to our fraternities. They have a pleasant well furnished suite of rooms near the center of tow'n, with a large lounging room, game romn, lihra!ry, and cafe. Students of a.ny department are eligible to mem.b·ership. A Catholic Young Men's Society in Madrid to which many students belong takes the place of our Y. M. C. A. This society has also a debating club and students of law find a chance here t·o exercise· th~ir powers. outside of the class room. The only thing like athletics is an mnateur bull fight given in the spring, the proceeds of which are devoted to charity. I was urged to take part in this, being assured tha.t if w'ould be a great at- traction to have a yanqui in the ring, and would draw a great crowd. My friends among the stu- denb::; described in the exaggerated Spanish way how fine ITIY name w'ould look in big letters on the hill-hon.rds. But I felt that ·fame could b€ achieved in othf'r ways and so dec1in€d the honor.

' ·'i': h ~ lj ',1 6 The $pani;sh student is a happy-go-~ueky so1't oct: fellow, e·~-sy to g.et acquainted wUh:, kind hearted and gene~~ous to a fault. He is intensely patriotic, and well informed in Spanish history. He is a great ladies' m.an, very proud of his conquistas (conquests), and his ability to keep· UiP· his lessons and court two or three novias at the sam:e time. The cP:own;ing ambition :of the law ;student js to become a dir>.IC>mat. A .great majority- of the stu- dents are freoe th.inkers or agnostics-·. s·ome, 1low- eve:t:\ being strict orthod.ox CathoHes. Many eo·m,e to Madrid from pre'Vineial towns and fall victims, unfertu.R .. ately, to thee tem:t')tations and vices .of the ca:pital, chief of which is gambling. The different faculties are located in different parts of the city. The buildings' ~re1 old brick structures· ·with no campus whate--:v:er.. On the neigh boring streets are m.any small~ wine-.shops and cake-stores where the students go to refresh themselves between classes. Many of these a:re on the verge of hankruptcy from haviJ:Jg trusted too implicitly in the word of the stcul.ents to pay their little cuenta when they rece:ived a eheck fr(j)m }lwmre. The university is not a place to stad:y for general culture, but a place whHre the stu~en.t pTepares llim·self for son1e distinct career. F1ive years are us·ualiy spent, after which the studen.t is a lic·en- ciado (licentiate) in law, medicine or- philosophy, acording to the carrerra (career) he has stu. died. One year more is usually required for the doctor's detgree. There are two classes of students: ofi- ciales (official), and estudiantes de e1:1senanza libre (fre.e-students). The first named are required to pay a matriculation fee, attend class regularly, re- Si[iH>!Jild to cla..ss :roH and p,a-y the ex:anl ination fee. The fre .. e stu.o,e:n.t pays no .entra-nce fee,. goes t.o class oy net as 'he pleases, is not called on and pays only the ·examination fee. This plar.t enables stud· e!Nts to ,Q(i) other work and study a career be- sides. Mar:t'Y' take advantage of tne system and are .emp1<6yed in some office in the ,(lay time and stiU.dY at night. Such students usttally take two yea.::r:S to p:repare for the examination in one year's course of study. T'he class-ro-om w1ork is nearly all lectures. r:L.,be avera;g·e size of classes :i!s larg.er than in American uni-versities. A student is- quizzed on an average of oncE' a terN:T. The :first few minutes of the hour are given up to the quiz, only one' or tw'o students bei11g called on, and then the professor proceeds ·with his lecture. It irs the custom· of many pro- fessors· to announce several days ahead the stu- dents who are to be q uiz.zed. This: puts a premium on .erarnming.. One exa.mination is held at the end of the year. It is alwa:ys oral, and a student faU- ing to pass, fails on the entire year's work in that study. The year is eight m,onths' long. There is a. vaca- tion of four week.s1 at Christlnas, one w·eek at Eas- ter,. hesides many saints' days and legal holddays. T 1 he professors are distinguished by wearing high ~ilk plug hats and c.a:rryi:r:.tg s'ilv.ef headed canes .. W'he-n they pass in the halls, students are s-qp·posed to take off their hats a:n.GI. how very respeoctfully. When tho roli is called the student rises, bows and says servidor {se·rvant.) Strikes of the students arH very common. The 'vriter recalls that there were three during the year that he w:as a student. One of these strikes lasi:ed three days, another, one da.y, a.nd the third, two weeks. The latter was a general strike affect- ing· all students of all the Spanish unive·rsities. So:!lle new Jaw·s regarding examinations and credits were passed which .displeased the students and a .general strike was called. Cnmmitte·e's were ap- pointed to confer with the Minister of PUblic In- struction and after ·much discussion matters w:ere E! djnsted satisfactorily. One .day a student in the history class ansWie.red fo·r an ahsent student when his nam.e wa:.s called. He was discoveTed by the professor and told to leave the class at once. AfteT the lecture was a;ver t11e stud-ents gathered in the hallway and.' re·solved not to enter Glass until the expelled m•etmiber was re-instated. We all left the building shouting, \Vivan. los estudiantes!\ (Long-live the students!) A committee w:as a.:p.po-inted to confer w'ith the pr<>fessor and next daY the ,student was re .. instate~a.

Tl£E CONCORDIENSIS 1 This ·~strike spirit'' is-cons~stent with the itnpulslve nature of the Latin races. A J!Htper rs published devoted to the interest of Spanish students in general. There is a gaitar and rnandolin. clu.b :known as the Elstudiantina. There are sorne two or three hundred in thts, an good yylayers. T'heh· custom is to march through the streets :playing, then to sto·:p in some pubUc square an:d give a concert. A collection is taken from the large crowd a.lways p:Pesent and after exp-ense.s are deducted the balance is given to charity. The Spanish: student is after all as keenly a.p:preciative .of the advantages of col1eg.e life and associations as vve are. OME;N' K. BORING.

After the war General Rogers practised law in' New York and .spent the remainder of his life at Sandy Hill. In Yale's football schedule for next .season, Brown has been taken on and the game with Pennsylvania State dropped.

STUDENT LIFE IN GERMANY. An ArtiC'-le b:v a La-w Student. o11:al ma:r1 and, if poss·ib!te, a eolleg.e professor, is the nighest aim of the ambiUous German youth. Educat:on and .lea.ring, the chief qualifi- (~atinn for a pro.f<?sslonal career, not only carry wtih them a .certain arnount of social and intellectual distinction blilt give their possessor also a daim to the esteem of his fellow citizens. A man who ac(~uires riches is given credit for his business abi'lity, but real admira- tion is reserved for tbe \Ritter von Geiste\ K • ht f t h L\ • • t \ or to the \ n1g s O· . e opHI . It is there- fore not to be wonderer a.t that the German parents are ready to make every conceivable sacrifice, and the young German is willing to make his best effort, in order that he may become a member of U1e University. It must be remembered that t'h e German University has nothing to do with politics, whatever. The professor is impartial t() ward the socialist as well as toward the con.servatist; t()ward the rich as well as toward the poor. The posi- tions for professional life are within the reach of every duly cultivated min d. The qualifications for entrance to the Uni- versity are by no means as easy as the entrance to our Union College.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS perfect republican organization in the world; organization rs some kind ·of a variegated cap. there is absoiute liberty in teaching and in The rnatn object of the members -of these studying, attendance at lectures being a matter of choice to a very large degree. There is no system of monition and you will never hear the phrase, ''I will can the roll.\ But one will always find a large attendance in the c·rasses, although it is optional with the stu- organizath\i>ns is to have a good time; to drink beer; to fight duels;. and to pla:y jokes on the poHce m· farmers. The members meet as a rule before dinner for an appeUzer, and after dinner for .a, cup of coffee, or take a wa)J:k, or a drive. On Saturday evening all meet at dent. some speei:Fied place and drink beer together. T'he final examinations are not conducted as This is known as \Knipe.\ T\11.e \Knipe''' is a.re ours. There they rely .solely upon the honor of the students and do not watch them at all after having posted the examinations. The student in most cases after completing six semesters at the University, makes appli- cation to take the final examinations. He is allowed the privilege, and if he is suc- cessful, he is given the degree of doctor of philosophy, which is announced by large pla- cards on the University bulletin board. If the examination passed was exceedingly sat- isfactory, the student may become ducant.\ As such, 'he receives no only lecture students to the faculty fees, if he is able his lectures. After a may recommend his a \privat- salary, but to attract few years appointment as \extraordinary professor,\ which is a more honored but still unpaid position. After a further lapse of time, by working at his special branch of science or philosophy, he may be called by some University to fill the chair of an ordinary :professor, drawing a fixed salary aside from_ 'his lecture fees. At the preparatory srhool the student is subject to the discipline of his teachers, but at the University the student enjoys for the first time absolute freedom; he can live where he desires and can do anything he des,ires. The social life of a German student finds more expression in smaller towns like Gottin- gen, F're-iberg, and In these cities students run things to suit themselves. but in a city like Berlin they are held in check. Almost every student belongs to some social organization, and the mark of each conducted accordingly to what is known as the \beer comment.'' The chairman calls the meeting to order, and the first order .of busi- ness is that each one present must ddnk a schooner of beer. After this fo:llows th€ real business j,nterspersed with songs and beer. The \Kni]>e\ always lasts until 12 o'doelt but in the majority of cases the students .Cf.o not adjourn until morning. Next to the \Kn.ipe the art of duelling is the most prominen .. t fea- ture in the life of the student. It is t() the German student what football or bas€bcvll is to the American youth. In such a duel the actors only try to scratch their opponents' faces, the one w'ho has the least nurnber of scratches upon his face at the completion of the duel is called the victor.
