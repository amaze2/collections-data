The Comn1encen1ent exercises were formally opened last Sunday evening, when President l{aymond delivered the Baccalaureate sern1on in State street ~1ethodist church. A very large audience was present, and thoroughly appreciated the President's address. Dr. Raymond took his text from John xviii, 37 : \Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.\ lYy Exercises. , The Ivy Exercises were held in College Chapel, on 1v1onday, June 8, 3 :oo p. m. Guy Brown Griswold, Grand Marshall.

On Friday evening, June sth, a delightful dance was given by the '' Alpha Delts,,. in their chapter house. The lower floor and staircase were tastefully ·decorated with ever- greens. Dancing commenced at 9· 30 and '' Home Sweet Home ~' was not played before, 3 a. m. A most enjoyable time was had bj all. Zita of Albany furnished the music, Those present were :

Akin, '7 7, in the absence of President William H. McElroy. The secretary, Dr. William T. Clute, was also absent and Dr. Henry Young was secretary pro-tem. Prof. Franklin P. Giddings of Columbia Col- lege was re-elected trustee. The following officers of the Alumni associa- tion were elected. President, D:r. Daniel M. Stimson, '63; vice .. president, Clarence E. Akin; secretary, Dr. William T. Clute; treasurer, lttiarvin H. Strong. Executive comtnittee: J. Newton Fiero, the Rev. E. C. Lawrence, James Heatly, Douglas Campbell and Frank Cooper. Bulletin committee: Edwin C. Hoyt, A. L. Bennett and Andrew MacFarlane. · One· member of athletic board for three years: Robert J. Landon. The Alumni dinner was served in Memorial Hall. 'fhe dinner was furnished by the ladies of the city. Gioscia's orchestra played selec- tions, among them being the ''Song of Old Union\ and the \Good Old Summer Time,'' in the first of which all the graduates joined, while nearly all joined in singing the second. The upper portion of the building was open and workmen were busy on the dome, but they did not disturb the enjoyment of the banquet· ers below. When President Raymond finally rBpped for order at the end of the dinner he said: ''vVe are keeping open house today as you probably noticed when you approached the building., Prof. Steinmetz also spoke. One of the features of alumni day is the re- union of the class of '63. This was one of the largest classes which ever graduated from Old Union, over 100 men receiving diplomas, 'fhere are twelve representatives of that class on the hill, which is quite a remarkable number, after having been out of college for forty years. 1,here was a meeting of the class in the Registrar's office and the old boys visited their class tree planted four decades ago. Afterward they called upon the president and faculty of the college and upon Mrs Peissner. They attended the alumni dinner and joined

THE CONOORDIENSIS. the class of 190 3 in class day exercises and in smoking the pipe of peace. They went to Albany on the trolley line and were enter- tained by Gen. Amasa J. Parker. The alumni and 'varsity teams played a game of baseball on the can1pus. A good many substitutes for each teatn had to be made, and exhibition base running was the consequence. SIGMA PHI DANCE. One of the most brilliant social events of the season was the Sigma Phi Dance held in Yates' Boat House on Monday night. A very large number of the alumni of the different chapters and the friends of the fraternity were pres- ent. The hall was very tastefully decorated with evergreens and blue and white fixtures. Dancing was enjoyed until the early hours after daylight. A delightful tin1e was had by all present. DELTA UPSILON DANCE. On Thursday evening, June 4th, the fratern- lty of Delta Upsilon gave its annual dance in Yate's Boat House. vVith the floor in perfect condition and Gioscia 's orchestra at its best, the affair was one to be enjoyed and remembered by all pres- ent. Besides the active chapter, n1any altnnni and friends on the hill ·were there. Among those present were the Misses F. Moss, Nellie Barton, Elizabeth Gersel, Craig, Laura Jennings, Eva Ballin, Effie Watson, Minnie Watson, Edith 'Vatson, B. Linneman, Marion ~Fitzpatrick, of Albany ; Miss Violet Telger of New York city; Miss Mills and the !\~~Iisses Rawdon, of Gloversville; Mrs. Allen of Danbury, Conn. ; Miss Tate, of Bloomville, and the following from this city. Prof. and Mrs. Marvin, Mr. and Mrs. R. Landon, Miss Fanny Paige and the Misses Amy Craig, Debo- rah Hoppman, Carrie· Watson, Nellie Horst- meyer, Anna Hubbs, Bessie Thornton, Jessie LeRoy, Stebbins, Mattie Dunham, Jessie Wright, Hardin, Myers, Marion Watson, Clara Gallop, Sadie Taylor, Prof. Hoffman, Prof. Edwards, Dr Betts, and the Messrs.

Putman and C. Heath. The patronesses were Mrs. Marvin, Mrs. Landon and Miss Fanny Paige. IVY DAY. Although Dr. Jackson's garden with its old eln1, flowers, shrubbery, pleasant walks, and more pleasant men1ories may have derived much good from the rain which came and went steadily on Monday last, the students and others know that it missed so1nethin.g which it could not well afford to lose. The Ivy Exercises of the class of 1903 were held in the chapel \owing as President J3ol- les said, ''to the inclemency of the weather.\ That the class upheld its reputation of being able to adapt itself to all occasions will be ful- ly vouched for by all present. Mr. Parker's oration, in spite of his announcetnent that it was prepared ·with different associations in mind, was very tactfully spoken and well re- ceived. Mr. Donnan in his ivy oration so eloquently appealed to the imagination of those present that the mere planting of the ivy was not nec- essary at all, w·hile it was the universal opinion that the ivy poem by Mr. Howe would not have received its due appreciation if it had been giv- en in the open air where the hearing of it would have necessarily been indistinct. Gioscia 's orchestra furnished the music. Regular rules of the chape 1 were dispensed

I I 'i I ! I I . ! 8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. with, and the Seniors were aUowed to smoke in peace. Contrary to the usual custo1n the chapel was crowded to the doors. Many alumni were present as well as friends of tne class. The rain did :n_.ot affect the at- tendance of pretty girls or th. e appearance of pretty dresses in the least. One thing is cer- tain. If chapel during the ter1n could have some of the features which it had lVIonday, and if some of the people present JVIonday ~ould be present regularly, it would not be so hard to get the fellows to com.e around. IVY POEM. When first we entered Union all was dark. No stalwart Towne upon our campus stood, No Boulevard had crossed 0ur college park, '¥ e leave these to the coltege as we should. In sylvan shade we wandered to the East Where tiny lakes lapped idly quarry wall, And on the mossy floor our sorrows ceased While list'ning to kind ::Mother Nature's call. Old college woods and Wendell's pond, no more Will your delights refresh a freshman's heart, The city grows, they tell us, trolleys roar Along the streets once forest and apart. Yet one dear spot is still untouched by change, This garden and its oval plot of green, This ancient tree, both elm a.nd Nott Elm (strange) The bushes with their interlacing screen. What brighter vision can enchant the sight Than clustered beauty ra11ged in smiling tiers, \Vho nod th~ir friendly wishes and delight Our hearts with heartfelt and ungrudging cheers. Now as we bid farewell t0 each dear friend, 'Ve thank them for thek kindliness, for all The little courtesies without an end, Which will for aye our grateful hearts enthrall. This tribute then to such good friends we bring, That judging from the standpoint of four years, Where'er we go their praises we must sing The ladies of Old Dorp possess no peers. We stand upon the threshcld of the years And gaze into the future; hopes and fears Lie mistily surrounded there. The past Our early life, our college days will last \'\IVith' vital impress in the future. Deeds Here done or left undotl.e, each breeds A train of consequence to make or mar \Vhat paltry eminence we gain afar. *\~**** We must ding to the subject of ivy, \we must :pipe in an ivy leaf,\ And as ivy is clinging by nature, and by nature our stay is brief, So we claim as a logical sequence, in accord with a very sure rule vVe may treat of the ivy by none of the methods of college or school. So we treat not of H.elix l:Iedera nor of other botan· ical name But the old fashioned ivy of England we praise in hexameters lame. Old ivy, we greet thee right gladly, as plant of th.e day, thou art queen, With thy beauty and graceful adornment with gar· ments of shimmering green, So to-day as we lay thee in state by the side of· Me· morial Hall \Vhere the old terraced campus borders the base of the time worn wall, \Ve symbolize in thy growth, the growth of our life to come, For we cling to the halls of ot!r college long after we leave our home. Our college is truly a home, four years have we lived here our life, And we bring in our hearts the memories dear that vie with the friendliest strife. We cherish these happy moments, we cherish these pleasure filled days, As we fondly turn to the years gone by our eyes are dimmed by a haze. 0 friends who have gathered to meet us, 0 friends who have come from afar, Our hearts beat high at ambition's cry and we stride to the nearest star. For youth is a king among men, he ruleth the world to-day. And 'tis learning's page, not wisdom's sage, that worldly men dare not gainsay. 0 college, 0 Alma Mater, may our love for thee aye be true, \Ve look through the vista so near-so far 'neath heaven's high archway of blue. With our leafy ceiling above us, at the roots of the old elm tree, As we meet to render thee homage and love, these classmates of 1903. You smile at the youth's assurance, you doubtingly shake your head. Up, classmates, rise and gain the prize, for lo, life's dawn is red. And over the hills\before us the scenes of our vic- ~ri~lk. . We win no race by begging each pace; with confident mind we tr~. - · ·

. THE CONOORDIENSIS. 9 Old Union, thou fostering mother, we tender this ivy vine As a votive gift, and lovingly lift our praises to thee and thine; Old Union, to thee all the honor, may thy splendor never grow dim, And 1903, forever to thee will offer this Union Hymn. * * * * * ~ Calmly there beside the 1\1ohawk:, thronged with hopes and doubts and fears, She has sat in state 1y splendor, smiling through a hundred years. She, the mother of our learning, maker of .a stalwart race, Union, Union, Alma l\Ltter, may she hold her hon- ored place. In the dim aisles of her forests we have wandered undismayed, Singing in the summer breezes underneath the elm tree's shade. \Ve have seen the purple shadows gather 'round her laughing rills, Watched the crimson sunsets fading on the distant \Vestern hills. Often on some balmy evening in a muffled undertone Came the voices of her singers seated on the grand old stone, And the flames have burnecl and sparkled 'neath the heaven's starry blue, To commemorate the glory of some battle won for you. Clothed in garments gray atld ancient, heart unchan- ged by time's decay, lvlay your sons uphold your honor, till at last there comes a day, \Vhen, like Phoenix, reinvested with a better, strong- er youth, You, 0 mother, noble hearted shall Le prosperous in truth. SA~1UEL B. HovYE, JR.

CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, TERMS: $2.oo per Year, in Advance ro Cents Publication Office: Oneonta, N. Y. Address all communications to THE CoNCORTIIENSIS, Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. To 1903. \ Here's to you, 1903 ! \ Yrou are leaving us for other parts-many of them unknown as yet. J1ut they can scarcely welcome you as cordially as Union in sadness bids you farewell. Whatever you have left the remaining classes and the college shall test your true worth. That your after in- fluence will be for the good of us all, we do not doubt. We are sure that your legacy will stand the test. Whatever we have gained in College has been to a large extent derived from you and we shall lose much in losing you. Althoagh you pass out from our sight, your lives shall 1'i ve on in ours and the memory of the days we spent in college with you shall never fade in our remembrance. As a poet once sang of. sHmmer so we rnay say of your college life. '' The last song is end~d ; The last laugh is done ; The last chorus blended ; Summer is gone. The last word is spoken ; The dream has fled-- The spell is broken-- Summer is dead.\ Yet the summer must die before Autumn fulfills. its promises. So, drinking a stirrup cup to you, 1903, we say ;-1( May many years of happy days befall.\ Thanks To Mr. Pond. Owing to the personal attention giv.en to the work of remodeling Memorial Hall by Mr. Pond, the building was put in readiness for use during Commencement week. The students extend their thanks to the Assistant Treasurer for using every effort to bring the work to at least a partial completion. The Senior Ball committee especially was generously assisted by the efforts· of Mr. Pond. The Base Ball The base ball season was successfttlly and Track Seasons. closed last Saturday afternoon, when Union defeated R. P. I. in Troy in a ten inning game. A review of the season proves it has been .a very successful one. Thir- teen games were played and the Garnet got the last of eight of them. Captain Griswold, :1\ianager Donnan, together with each man on the team have worked faith- fully and their efforts to make the season a victorous one have been crowned with reward. They deserve praise. The track season was not unsuccessful, as an inves· tigation of the results of the meets, might go to show. The meet with Rutgers was a handicap one to a certain extent. The New Jersey College was fortunate in hav- ing good men where Union was weak. Even tho' we did lose, when a man does his best, his college should be proud of him. The R. P. I. meet, we should have won. As it was, the margin was narrow by which the Trojans won out. Captain Pearce merits the sincere thanks of the entire college for his consistent efforts to turn out a winning team. ffit th p, T ' lll st t' p· ti 1\ tl 1 r

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 ALL-C·OLLEGIA TE vs UNION. The All-Collegiate tea1n was made up of men representing diffierent colleges and atnong them were two of Unions old Varsity men, Paige and Grout, captain of last year's team. The All-collegiates were confident and started out to swamp Union. One side of the bleach- ers was occupied by General Electric men whose efforts to cheer their tean1 to victory never relaxed. The score was tied in the ninth inning, but Bingham who had pitched a star game striking out eleven men, brought in two winning runs in the tenth inning by a pretty three bagger. Heath fielded his posi- tion brilliantly and handled the stick well. Morgan Hawks and Trumbo played well for the General Electric team.

Saturday, June 6th, Union defeated R. P. I. at Troy for the second time this season. It was last game of the season and the loss of the rrrack Meet but a week before n1ade it impera- tive that Union should not again loose. 1,he game looked doubtful for Union when the very first inning Archer, Hagar and Griswold struck out in quick succession. For R. P. I. a few hits coupled with some errors netted 5 runs R. P. I. soon made the score 6-o. Union now braced up and gradually overhauled Rens- selaers lead. After the first inning 0' Brien pitched asplendid game striking out seventeen 1nen. \Vhen the bases were occupied and only one out two more would go down before his delivery. Heath with the bat and his fine running greatly assisted the team. It took ten innings to finish the ga.rne and for the second time this year Union pulled out of the gan1e in the te11th inning victorious.

I-Ioffrnan, entitled \Psychology and Cotnmon Life,\ has just been issued by Messrs. G. P. Putnam Sons. No very extended reviews of it have appeared as yet, but those which have come out are of the same tenor of opinion. 1,he author's pur- pose is partially expressed in the review from ''Public Opinion'' which is quoted below. A wider discussion and fuller mentiDn will be made in the \ Concordiensis \ next fall, when the book bas been thoroughly reviewed by com- petent critics. 1 .. wo quotations from leading periodicals are given here. The ''Outlook\ says : \Professor Hoff- man has here popularized with remarkable clearness a recondite subject, concerning some particulars of which there is an increasing and unsatisfied curiosity as well as no small amount of misconception and delusion. He is familiar with the \Proceedings'' of the Society for Psychical Research, and with other literature dealing with the subject, both scientific and and charlatan. His book will not only inter- est the curious but will be found to illuminate ' the educational, ethical and hygienic bearings of sound psychology. \Vhile critical, it is fair, and holds in general a just balance of appreci- ation for both sides of a model question.'' Frotn \Public Opinion:'' \ In view of the uni- versal interest in (and ignorance of) the mod- ern ratnification of psychology 7 Professor Ho~f­ man's survey of the latest results of psychical research, with special reference to their bearings upon the bearings of every day life, is partic- ularly timely. To the popular but misled in- . . terest in this subject is mainly due the spread of all sorts of quackery; from this book it is possible to get a correct understanding of what psychical research has accotnplished, what it has not proved, and to what uses the slight snm of your knowledg-e n1ay be put. The chapters dealing with the relation of mind to disease are particularly good. Sanity, con- servatistn, no less than open-mindedness, mark every page of the book.'' COLLEGE CONCERT.

' ' THE ;OONCORDIENSIS. 15 VERMON:T vs UN.ION. Union defeated the University of v,ermont on the college diamond Thursday afternoon, May 21st, for the third successive time. 'rhe game was exciting, as it was close. The Ver- mont team, although defeated by several •larger college teams, undoubtedly expected to start a winning scheme on the campus here. Union not sure of victory, played a good and steady game. l'he features of the game were the hard hitting by J\1ahar and Capt. Griswol:d., the former opening the game with a slashing home run and following that during the game with two three base hits, while the latte-r with three men on bases drove out a three base hit to left field netting three runs and giving Union the lead. Again when a run was needed and Mahar won on third Griswold got a clean hit and Mahar came in. Bingham pitched a very steady game and with men on bases he was ap- parently the coolest man on the field. Ver- mont made three runs in the first inning the ball going over the terrace while three tnen were on bases. In the fourth inning Wood- ward's three and Peck's two base hits gave Vermont three runs. Heath wielded the stick to good advantage.· The score: UNION. AB R rB SH P.O.

Now speaks the fury of the storm which stays Only to leave pale desolation in its wake. Death comes to life and life is death All in one moment. The world is darkened And the relentless sky, outpouring fire, Strikes with llntempered hand the dwellers On this earth. The mighty deep (a boiling caldron~ now} Sends up its dead in countless numbers, Old church yards-once so quiet-are transformed And now become the scenes of wild spirit routs. The graves are opened and the dead rush out and cry In tearful sobs for water 1 blessed balm, to cool The fire on their burning tongues. Eut Death sweeps on like a majestic messenger And gathers to himself all life both old and young.

rf'H·E ·coNOON'DTENSiS. 17' THE POSS_IBILITIES OF' ELEC- TRICITY. 'Vhen ·Morse flashed his first message froin · Baltimore to 'Vashington over a tiny wire in an incredibly short space of time, the world won- dered. '\Then Edison, with infinite n1ental ca- pacity first evinced his remarkable genius in connection with electricity, the world was startled, and even the prosaic ones were brought face to face witl~ the fact that there was a gigantic force in nature, hitherto p~ac. tically t~tnknown. Edison lives to-day and \yith him others just as brilliant who surprise us nearly every hour with new discoveries in the realm of this marvellous power. What is it ? 'Ve do not kno'v. It cannot be defined. Nor do we begin to know the limit of its force. The great cataract of Niaraga has been har- nessed and now the surrounding cities are lighted by the electricity generated by the Falls and transmitted by cables over miles of intervening country. The stnall electric loco- motive is more powerful than the huge frieght engines with six driving wheels. A tiny elec- tric motor will &end a yacht flying through the water. Aside from the present practical uses of electricity, there are infinite possibilities in such a field. Since a message can be sent across the ocean, either above or beneath its waters in scarcely more than a mon1ent of titne, who can say how long it will be before we are in electrical touch with all the planets and even possibly with the nearest stars ? 'I'he minds o£ m.ost men are limited, but who. can say what a Tesla, a I{elvin, a Steinmetz or an Edison will reveal to us? 'The range of the subject is , so vast that even the most co·rnpetent elec- tricians specialize in some branch. So far as its utility is concerned, there is no limit to its possibilities. The theory has re- cently been advanced that electricity is neces- sary to the life of plants and the announcer holds that an electric current introduced into· a flower .pot will cause infinite improvement. Another e·xperi~en:ter brings forward the idea will kill all the genns in it. rrhe thought that that a current brought in contact with water. electricity is life itself is very prevalent, this is of course disputed, but the idea that el·ectric- ity in some form or other is necess-ary to all organic fo.rms of 1natter is not denied. It seen1s from the present outlook, that time is the only thing needfultn tnake electricity-the most potent industrial and conuuerci~l factor of our life. In time, electricity ·will _probably be found to be the tnost .efficient ren1edy and the most deadly force in :t11c n1.edical world. And then, perhaps son1e day,. when the science of it has been completely n1a.stered, n1an will har- ness it to life so that 'vhi le one exists the other shall live. ALBANY LAW SCl-IOOL. The s·chool year has drawn to a close. Lectures \Yere suspended on Thursday· the 2 I st. inst, and Friday was devoted to final ex· aminations, or at least the balance of them, several subjects having been <;oncluded by ex- amination during the pr.evious two weeks. The Class picture has been finally complet- ed, and is on exhibition at the Albany Art Union. The final jury-trial in the }vloot-court series was held on Saturday the 23d. inst. at 1.30 p. m. The case was that of Richard Roe against the Albany & Greenbush Bridge Company, and it was an action for damages by reason of an assault. Nimmo & Burnside for Plaintiff, Mills & DeYoung for defendant. 'T'he jury failed to agree, but it is understood that. the vote was seven for non-suit, one for judgment for plaintiff. ~\he candidates for the Moot- C<?urt prize, which will be awarded on Com· mencement evening, are Messrs. DeYoung, Minkin, McCann, Mills, Burnside, and Nimmo. Messrs. ;Frank ·M. Hickok, LL. B., 'o2, and John T. Fitzpatrrick, ex-o3, have formed at

The Fiftyothird annual Circular of Infor- mation has come frotn the press, and the ge- nial Secretary, 1\1r. Davidson, deserves great credit for its fine appearance. l'he Union Chapter of Delta Chi held a banquet at the Hotel Ten Eyck on Friday evening, at which a goodly number of the alumni, faculty, graduates, and undergradu- ates, were present. The Bar Examinations are scheduled for June 9th., after which time (we hope) all of the seniors will be full-fledged lawyers. CORNELL UNIVERSIT'Y MEDICAL C.OLLEGE-~ NEW YORK CITY.
