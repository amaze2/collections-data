THE CoNcoRDIENSIS l 7 0L. X..,;¥VIII. ·UN!Oi\1 COLLEGE, SEPT. 24, 1901-. No. I UNION'S GREAT CENTENNIAL. Noted Educators to Speak-- Many Alumni ExpeCted --The Entire University to be Prese·nt. What prmnises to be one of the greatest events in the history of Union College, will take place next Thursday wh:en the rooth anniversary of the accession of Dr. Eliphalet Nott to the presidency, \vill be celebra- ted. This centennial wiill not only be a most notable one for the ·College, which has never before had the opportunity nor shown the desire to hold such an affair, but it will be compelled by its own peculi:lr significance to take rank among the foremost of all such celebrations of every university and institution of learning through- out the country. Dr. Nott ruled Union College for sixty-two years. Taking the president's (hair in r8o4, when there was nothing to distinguish the college from any other, nor any evidences of coming historic greatness except the fact that it was one of a very few, he caused Union to blaze the way through a wilderness of old world tradi- tion to the plane of the broad democratic universities of today Union has never slowed up from the impetuous given it by Dr. Nott. It was non-sectarian when, ac- cording to the highest educational authorities, that meant ruin; it is non-sectarian now. It stood for a broad well-rounded education, suitable and fitted for the demands of any branch in life at a time when people looked at such an idea as well nigh sacriligious; every- thing about it from the blue gate to the idol, stands for that now more than ever. These are thumb marks of Union's first g:reat president which have deepened in impression. These are some of the burning topics of 1804 and 1904 which wm be painted with colors true to life and illustrated with stories of experience by men who have seen and kno\vn Dr. Nott as the educator ' the preacher and the man. If elaboratt preparations and tireless painstaking effort count nor anythi Hg Union will surely do itself proud next week. Since early bst winter over a hundred alumni have been appointed among several committees to plan and prepare for the minutest details of the celebration. Regular meetings of these various committees have been held in New York and other cities, to discuss the outlook and the result of the work and make suggestions for any improvements in the program. They have .gone to all points of the United States to secure speakers, representatives of the largest universities, for the great occasion. Indications point to the gathering of a most interesting and powerful body of scholars and factors in modern educational development. Alumni of the old school, that is of Dr. Nott's class-room, will be there to rebte their personal reminiscences and experiences. It will be a Union day, a Union of the past, present and future. The men who have worked so hard to mo.ke a successful day are depending almost entirely on the attendance of the alumni to indicate and prove the success of the undertaking. Appeals have been and are being sent directly and indirectly nnd enough responses have been received to eclipse all Commence., ment gatl1erings. But more alumni are wanted. The Glmpus, Dr. Jackson's garden, the pasture, the entire grounds should be thronged with Union men. It is the one day in a hundred years that Union can, with justice to her- self and vvith all looking on, strut about and cro\\·. Among many distinguished guests whose names could not be secured there will be President Wilson of Princeton, and President Thwing of V\' esterr. Reserve. Hamilton W. Mo.bie will make the principal address of the day. Every student of the university is going to be present. Special cars in the early morning will bring over from

\ I I l 6 Tl-IE CONCORDIE.tVSIS. Albany the students of the law, medical and pharmacy departments, accompanied by the entire faculties wi1th their wi:ves and guests. On arriving at the college the faculty and trustees of the universHy will retire to Wash burn Ho.ll, where rooms h~ve been reserved for the professors of the dep3rtments, in which preparations may be tnade for the processiGm. In the meantime the students will have the w,hole campus to themselves, where they will also arrange themselves according to their respecbve department, and await the start of the procession. The line of march will begin shortly before Io o'clock at the north end of Wash burn Hall and extend across to the west end of the south colonnade. Fol:lowing the m ~rshal will come the students of the law~ medical, pharmacy and academic departments in the order named. Aher these will march the different faculties of the university, followed by the trustees, alumni and invited guests, and then the speakers. As the proces- sion marches toward Memorial Hall where the openi:ng exercises of the day are to be held, the student body will halt, forming two parallel lines through which the rest of the procession will march into the Hall. Within, the unveiling of the memorial tabiet win take place, conducted by President Raymond. Ad dresses by Hon. Frederick W. Seward, Rev. Henry C. Potter and Bon. Judson S. Landon, are' also on the program at this time. The collation at 1:30 p. m. will be given in the State Armory at the head of State street. The ladies of Schenectady have provided this and it is expected that at least Iooo people wilt be present. The tickets for this affair are to be distributed among the students on Wednesday. A number of the students are being de- pended on io serve as waiters, as is the custom at the alumni dinner during commencement. In order to pro- vide ticketsfor the alumni and guests they must register in Silliman Hall on their arrival. The gallery in the armory wii I be reserved for the ladies who may wish to attend. Immediately after the collation, brief addresses wHl be made by the Governor of New York and the Mayor of Schenectady. These will be followed by reminis- cences of Dr. Nott by: William H. H. Moore, Esq., '44· The Hon. Charles C. Nott, '48. The Hon. David Murray, '52. The Rev. Dr. Nelson MiHard, ':53·· The Rev. Dr. Sheldon Jackson,. '55· The Hon. N. Lansing Zabriskie, '57. William H. McElroy, Esq., '6o. The Hon. Warner Miller, '6o. The Hon. Samuel R. Thayer,. '6o. The Hon. Charles Emory Smith, '61. At five o'clock there will be a lieception at the Presi- dent's house. This reception is intended only for the alumni, invited guests and ladies. The musk forth is and all other events of the day will be furnished by Gioscia. Hamilton W. Mabie, LL. D., will give the principal address of the celebration, in the evening at the First ~ Presbyterian church. There will also be brief addresses by representatives from other institutions. This will form one of the most aoteworthy and interesting part of the day's program. THE CANE RUSH. Nine Sophs. Handle Sixteen Frosh Hands. The annual cane rush took place on the campus Mon- day afternoon. The scrap was a very even one so far as numbers were concerned; the Frosh lined up only fifty men out of ninety, while the Sophomore class numbering about that brought out nearly every man. The usual exchange of tomatoes for the little bags of salt was carried on as vigorously as ever but the ''rough and tumble'' lasted only three minutes. But when the club was thrown up by Captain Patton of the football team, the crash came and a high stack of squirming bodies was quite visible, as well as some of last year's participants, either mixed in or running around the outside looking for freshmen that needed to be withdrawn. When time was called and Dr. Towne and Captain Patton counted the hands there were recorded 16 fresh- men and 9 sophomores. How it is possible to get 25 hands on a baseball bat is a problem the under-class- men may figure on while they are waiting for the next scrap. The Archbishop of Cante1 bury one of whose prede- cessors was the ftrst ''ex-officio'' trustee named in the Charter of ICing's ·College will be present at the open- ing exercises of the 15 Ist academic year of Colutnbia University.

Cap- tain Raymond divulged the startling news that Dr. Towne now intends to have regular gymnasium classes. Although the baseball season is a thing of the future, Manager Thompson had a few words to say concerning it. With few exceptions every position on the nine is open to competition. Practice will be conducted through the winter in the gym in order to get an early start. The season opens with the West Point game on April 8th. Hart, 'o5, as Business Manager of the Concordiensis, repre£ented that publication. The staff intend to make it better than ever, and the fact that it is to be printed in town, will enable news to be inserted up to the time of going to press. It is needless to say that this paper should be supported by the student body. There being no Musical Club last year, Manager FACULTY CHANGES. Dr. Edward Ellery, who is to take charge of the Department of Chemistry, is a graduate of Colgate College. After his graduation he became an instructor in his alma mater.

While the students have been enjoyin~ '!:heir vaca- tion in various ways at work and in pleasure, the Faculty have also bee:1 taking a needed and deserved rest. President Raymond remained in Sch enectady,as usual, during the summer with short outings of two or three days on which occasions he joined his family who vvere in the Adirondacks the first part of the vacation, and later in the Catskills. Dr. Ripton spent part of his summer in Schenectady, but the greater portion m Oswego, N.Y.

Professor Wright, after a pleasant outing in the Catskills all summer has been given a leave of absence for a year. England he visited the principal boys' schools such as Rugby, Eton, Harrow and Winchester, in order to acquaint himself with educational problems in England. Prof.essor Landreth was in Schenectady during the first part -of his vacation and later engaged in the northern part of the state on engineering problems; The larger part of his time was spent in a complete and thorough investigation of take levels on Seneca Lake and of certain conditions resulting in a variation of pressure in the W3ter supply of the City of Auburn, N.Y. Pr()fessor Stoller spent his summer quietly at home with his family in this city. D·r. Hale ·was engaged in teaching English Literature in the summer school of the University of Chicago where his work was weli appreciated. Professor Steinmetz was in St. Louis during part of the summer, where he was chairman of one of the ~ections of the International Congress of Electrical Engineers. He read some papers on important electri- cal engineering matters and took a prominent part in the electrical engineering topics discussed there. Pro· fessor Steinmetz and Asst. Professor R. Neil Williams were both on the reception committee entertaining a party of ladies of the International Congress who took a trip through Schenectady, visiting its principal sights of interest, including Union College. Professor Williams remained in the city during most of the summer. Professor Bennett spent his vacation in visits with friends in Ogdensburg, East Orange and Ithaca. Professor Opdyke remained in the city, with the ex- ception of tvvo pleasant weeks in Plainfield, N. J. Professor Frank B. Williams was engaged in state engineering work on the New York-Vermont State Line Survey, having charge of the setting up of the monu- ments from the Massachusetts corner to Poultney river. Dr. Hoffman also spent his vacation abroad. Fer several weeks he was at Oxford University, England, working up some subjects,. the material for which he could not find in this country. While there the new Chancellor of the University, Lord Gosch en was inaugurated. This service had not been held before since r86g, when the Marquis of Sailsbury was inaugurated as chancellor. Many famous men in England were present and received degrees. It was one of the most imposing and stately university festivi- ties that has been held anywhere in the last half century. After three weeks spent in the mountains of Switzerland, Dr. Hoffman returned to Cambridge, England~ and attended the meeting of the British Scientific Association, which lasted for a week and called together many of the principal scientists of Europe. The Prime Minister of England, Lord Balfour, was president of the association, and not only delivered one of the pducipal addresses, but took part daily in the proceedings. Prof. Hoffman was principally interested in the ecomonic and educational sections and was con- stantly in attendance at their meetings. While in Dr. R.

CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, TERMS. $z.oo Per Year, in Advance 10 Cents Address all communications to THE CONCORDIENSIS, Union College, Schenectady, N. Y. -----------------~-------· --~- ~- WHAT WILL IT DO'? In Leslie's \Veekly for Thursday of this week there is an article ·by Willian1 H. Mc- Elroy of the class of I 86o. Union College is the subject of the article which was occasioned by the coming celebration. Various illustra- tions of buildings and scenes about the can1pus, with a splendid cut of Dr. l~aymond, enhance the value of the article to Union rnen. The author breathes true spirit frorn first to last and epeciaUy to the students, a care fu I read i n g of \ v hat he says w o ul d be we 11 worth while. One staten1ent he n1akes which in relation to the Centenial is rnost apt and striking: ''A College is as a College does.\ Brilliant speakers frorn other univer::;ities, a large attendance of noted rnen who are nut Union rnen and of syn1pathizing friends and visitors are not going to make this celebration successful. They are coming as guests to be entertained. The good resulting frorn this celebration means nothing to thern frorn a U n ion stand poi n t. The presence of the com- 111 it tee that has \Vorked so hard for the centenial and a smooth running of the ex- ercises are not going to make the occasion successful. The protnoters of the plan do not consider these as indications of success at all· \Nhat do they look for? If every train and trolley that con'les in to the city vVednesday night and early Thurs- day morning bears a load of alun1ni so that they \vill fill the avenue fron1 the station to the Blue Gate, if every student in the univer- sity, la\v, n1ed ical, pharmacy and acaden1ic, is on hand with the uncontrolable desire to r11ake hi tnself seen and heard, the comrnittee on arrangernents and every body else ought to be fairly well satisfied. After ail the college and university itself will deter.mine by its actions the success of the undertaking. And good results will follow if all goes as is planned. The Col1ege will be as the College does.

Ninety-three studer.ts from various parts of the country have placed their starnp of approval on the value of the university degree in preference to \working up\ correspondence schools, specia 1 technical schools, and other lights of the educational world. We presun1e that their decision to come to Union was n1ade after careful reflection and a judicious weeding--out process. Perhaps they gave it little thought and just came because circun1stances peculiar to then1selves forced thern to. Perhaps somebody sent then1 here. With whatever brand they are rnarked, they all came with one don1inating purpose, and it is but natural to infer that that purpose is to get what they can of an education. Now that they are here it is going- to be interesting, as with all entering· classes, to those who are in a position to look down and survey th~ 1908 contingent as they file past during the next four years, to see \Vhat methods they will individually choose to acquire the biggest hunk of what President Rayn1ond is kind enough and frank enough to call a means of making n1oney and assur- ing a good livelihood. Are they going to concentrate their tninds ------ ·-- - and energies on their studies alone and throw aside as chaff associations \vith their fellows and diversions of the college? Or will they be \one of the boys'' once, n O\V, and for all tirne, only stopping now and then to handle books as they would handle heavily charged electric wires ? Not that they must necessarily do either. But these are the t'vo paths widest open for them to follovv. 'rhe others are harder. Ad vice to I 908 \Vou ld be superfluous. Enough is offered in theY. M. C. A. Hand- book to provide for several g·ood hearty tneals and extra dishes will probably be served up to thern during the year. Let them take all. But their ain1 in coming-· here should be coincident with the aim of the college, and how they are to grasp 1nost successfully the latter is the problern which, while here, each n1an of then1 must solve for hin1self.

There remains after a lapse of three months, with as keen an etnphasis as when the last ga n1 e \Vas over in June, several legacies of the 1904 season \vhich may be accepted as valu- able assets for the tean1 of rgos. The notion prowls around that with the abundant and able n1aterial that presented itself as early as March I 5 tb, sotnething bett~r might have been done.

This always hurts Union's winning chances. Can· didates can gain little g-ood by long practice in quarters where they shiver and chatter if they stop working for a n1oment, and where they are unable to take a con1fortable ba.tb, accompanied with a change of clothing before going out into the chill air of early sprh1g. Then again, it is like bettings one''s luck against a broken nose, or a black eye, or a split thumb, or something else as equally desirable, to practice catching or batting- a swift ball in a gymnasiun1 where t\vilight holds sway nearly all the tirne. This consti- tutes the handicap with which every tea1n starts out at Union in the spring. Frorn the standpoint of results the profes- sional coaching departn1ent was a disappoint- ment and a nonenity. \Nhat it accomplished for the good of the tean1 and college \Vas not visible, at least to the side lines, in a sing-Ie game throughout the season. Let the coach be a professional, if need be, but unless he knows ·what are the \vays and needs of a college baseball tearn he can not be long successful. Coaching, and good coaching, too, was not lacking. When Dr. Towne carne to tl1e res- cue things moved. Every afternoon he gave his services to the developing process and whatever advancement or good showing the team rnade, can be put do\vn as the result of his efforts. To one other n1en1ber of the faculty thanks are especially due. That is Prof. Opdyke. How he labored for the good of the colleo-e b ' through his interest in the baseball situation . ' ts appreciated by all \vho kne\v how emba.rass- ing- and disheartening that situation at tinTes was. The furrow which Jack Mahar, as captain of the tean1 had to follow, was anything but srnooth. I-Iis election can:1e as a surprise to him and at a tin11e when he had little leisure to reflect or n1ake any plans. Throughout the season he took his position well in the face of n1any disconragen1ents. There are son1 e chapters in the history which next season n1ust be ornitted. It n1ight pay in tl:1 e future to investigate a player's standing and his right to play on the 'varisity tean1 before he becomes such a necessitv to the tean1's success that his with- \' dra wal causes it to actually stagger for a tirne for lack of his support. It is to be regretted that the reason for the sudden departure of two of Union's ball palyers fron1 the squad could never be glea:ned fron1 official sources even by a Con cordi ens is rc:presen tative. T'he practice on the campus was not all it could and should be. Many tin1es players reported for work without their uniforms. It is unnecessary to argue how irnpossible it is to have a winning tean1 of any kind without a regular and strict system to control the practice of tht'! team.

Fall Meet May be Held in Scotia. Although neither of the meets last springs were won, we can safely say that the season showed marked improvement ove:r the one of the previous year and for this reason we may call the season successful. If we improve .as much this year, we shall have not .only a successful but a victorious record, The greatest drawback last spring was 'lack of men willing to try hard for the team. Instead of 14 we shou!d have had a team of 25 men. As it happened, it fell to the lot of some men to do more than their share and a team not well balanced is of necessity handi- capped. This is a handicap that can be easily overcome by good college spirit and more competition for the team. Losing but one man from last year's team and having an entering class of a hundred, the college should have hopes of a great deal of activity in track athletics through the whole year. Now the first opportunity for activity in this line is in connection with the Fall meet. This is scheduled for Friday afternoon, October 14th. To insure the success of this meet, training beforehand for it is absolutely necessary; it will not do to wait to train till a day or two before the meet. Such training is worthless. If training for this meet is to count it must begin atonce and be consistent. It is the duty of every m~n in college to help make the meet a success, and a man with any ability whatever who fails to get out and train for the events is shirking his duty. Manager Hunt is trying to secure the track in Scotb for October 14th, if this cannot be had the meet will be held on the college oval. Besides awarding class medals, the management will give ribbons to winners o.f first, second and third places. The follo~vving will be the events:-roo yards dash; zoo yards dash; 440 yards dash; half mile run; one mile run: 120 yards hurdle; 220 yards hurdle; shot put; hammer throw; high jump; broad jump; pole vault and one mile relay race. Forty-eight American beneficiaries of the Rhodes' Scholarships will sail for England this month. Every State and Territory except Alaska is represented. It is said that the qualifications were compat'atively easy to the graduates of either our large or small colleges.

Mr. Hagar prepared for college at the Plattsburg:h State Normal and played on his school team. He made the 'varsity in his Freshman year and has played in center field ever s~ince. He led the team in batting last season by a safe majority and can be counted on to be one of the most efficient Captains Union has ever had. He is a member of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity. skating rink committee. ~·------------------------------------------------------------------------------~ :-v; Fearey? s is the place to buy new styles in fall shoes NOW. }os.

L t' ·. r . I r. I. I. I THE ·COJ.VCORDJE_lvSJS. I7 FOOTBALL. 'Training Table at Redmond' s-· The Game Today. It is with pleasure that Union rpen \yatch the daily practice of the 'Varsity eleven, big, strapping players that they are, and the likewise husky scrub battling hard for places on the team. Captain Patton is proving himself to be a hard work- ing leader, for he is deeply interested in his men and his college. Bill Smith is the coach par excellence for Union be- cause she is his alma mater and because he is aiming to train the present team to follow in the footsteps of those former teams which made Union's name familiar to every college and city in the state. The men who played on last year's team, with a few exceptions, are back this fall and far from being posi- tive of a place on the 'Varsity. are being rushed hard by men from the class of 1908. The squad is being in- creased daily by new men and from 15 the first day has grown to 25 and 30 each day. Ther~ is abundant material from which to select suitable men, and there is every prospect of a scrub which will equal the 'Varsity team of the past two vears. Scrimmage this week was snappy, sharp and re- markably free from careless mistakes. The men are getting used to tackling low and are clever in line buck- ing. Today the men are doing battle with the repre- sentatives of Columbia, and, while their chance to win is not large, yet the score will show what the men can do. The season is just beginning around the country and there is a place for Union on the honor list of splendid teams. There are the traditions of past prowess, a good captain, an able coach, the men, the ambition and with the aid of every man in the college on the side- lines, a successful 'Varsity eleven which can be pointed .out with pride. Captain Patton says: \The team this fall will be the same as last with some exceptions, Von Dennen- burg, 'o6, will be out and will try for back. Franchot, 'o7, is doing good work and has good chances. Of ·Course there are dark horses among the freshmpn The training table, which is a new feature of football at Union, will be established in the Lorraine block on State street and will be supplied by Redmond. The regular team and four or five subtsitutes will be seated at it.\ All are rejoi·cing to see a training table established and to feel that it is to play an important part in caus- ing the men to work hard for a place at it. In view of the fact that only 15 wiU be seated, it is a distinct honor to mqke it. Bill Smith whe.n questioned as to the team's pros- pects said ' 'first -rate. '' The schedule now calls for a game with the Edison club in place of the Laureate Boat club. Then comes Rochester and Hamilton. A rumor has sprung forth full-grown, that there is soon to be an addition of some kind to the athletic field. Just what it is is open to speculation. To a Concord· iensis reporter, Capt. Patton would only say that it would be brought before the student body later. In today's game, Columbia will put in the field the best team it has had for years. The Union line-up for today 's game will be: Left End-Davis. Left Tackle-Patton Left Guard-Von Donnenburgh. Center-N utt. Right Guard-Kluge or Gilmour. Right Tackle-Dann. Right End-Wright. Quarter Back-Robinson and MacNab. Left Half Back-Harvey. Right Half Back-Moore. Full Back-Raymond and Cook. ----------------·--. H. S. BARNEY & CO.
