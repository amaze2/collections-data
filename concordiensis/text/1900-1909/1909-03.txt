He. first Aristotle thought that every body had at least ·de.ftned an element. as sa~meth:$U.g with properties .of one of the foHowiilg properties: It should be its own, which can ·eoll)bine with. other eleirrents to eithe.r cold· or hot, auc;f ·either dry or wet; and form· compounds. . Tb..e .point is that an- element from these he obt~1ned his elements. S'ix com-hi- .was no longe-r a property d.f ,matter, but .a kind of nati-<),1s ate pos~dbl-e, but two of them have to be mattet. . t~-rown out, as contradictory. Properties, Cold-wet, wet-hot, dry-hoc, col4-dry, cold:..hot, wet-dTy. Corres. elements, Water, air, fire, earth. Chem-istry, like all se-ience, has developed mostly from pra.ctica:l que~tions, as d·ye, U}eta.l an.d chem- ical manufacturing, ~nd. ~fter a,.~i;rne a new scheme was required to be~ter fit· exp€ri~nce. So substan- ces were arranged in class·es, \dth a type f.o·r each class, thus: Class, G9mbustibility, metallic properties, ~oll!bility and ta~te, nolle of above properties. Type, Sulphur, mercury, com.t:pon salt, earths. The latt~r ele:ment alqt}e was tet;:tined frorn ' I A.dstotle.

R.,,ev- ,' olutio~ary ch.a.~g~·s ai·e impu:ssible on accottnt of the inertia. of the ~cl~ntiflc world. ·Atn old view is correct~d in Jts w:orst pa.rts, as much as possibie of it bein~ retain·ed. The ancients had· assumed that properties ·could be changed fpom one piece of matter to another, which is true only to a cer- - . . tain exterit. It wa.s loglcal for them to try to tul'n lead into gola, because they could turn cinnabai' into me·rcury .. It took a long time to learn that th·a possibilities are distinctly limited in this direc- tion. Robert Boyle pointed out that it was useless lt was assumed that compounds collld vary a .little, just ~s dogs, ang.els and ·students do. T'hus weB water, river water and sea water ba..ve differ- ent tastes, etc. B:ut as .elements and co·mpounds .coJne to. be better purUled, it. was found that a ·pure che·mlcal species or che-mical in·dividual is always identical, *h~ti1ver itg ·slource. . At the. end· of the eigbteent.}.l c·e~tury the rapid- ity. of th.e d.evelopmei~t of ·chemistry increased, and a chang.e ot. views W.~u·k pl~ce,. au·~ to the discovery of oxygen. The phenomena of oxidation anet re- duction. were known dqthig the 'elghteenth century - .. a.s the heating of eho:rcoal aud litharge (Pb 0) alone and tog~ther. T'he thelQry of phlogiston wa~ invented to explai;11 the facts. Phlogiston was suppos·ed to be an eleme11t, which escaped· during combustion, and could he re~tored, thereby .re- storing the original prop·erties to the substance. F'la.me w~s th'Ought to be the esctt,ping phlogh;toil. Those s'ubs'tances whtcb. .,lsft little r:esidue on com- bustion were considered to .be alm·bst pure phlo!gis- ton, as charcoal. ThiS genel'alizadon was corr~cteJ by the mea.sutementd ma,de po~sible by the ftuther development of ~hemistry, that ls, the m'elishre- m.ent of weight. Jl()W c<>uld ~.nything, ·aven phlogiston, escape, when th·e ptoducts o.f combus- tion were heavier than the s·ubstance burned? As .soon as oxygen was discovered, the present th'~ory o.f combustion was put forward by Lavoisier. An Euglish tra.nsla.tion of his q~k,. published··ln 1806, is in th·e library. The theory Qf La.voisier wa.s su- . J perior to the older tb~ry, !P tl'lJtl oxygen could be bottled up afid ·experirnebted witb, while. phlo·gia- ton w'as hypothetical.

On the ba.sis.,orf..tlle. l~w o.f the conservaUon of weight, we~ c.a:n. d·efine an :element a.s any ~ubstance' which can be changed into another ·substa.nce only by increasing in weight. This is an expe-rimental definition, free .from. hypotpetical atoms and such a d~fimtion is most desirable .in thes·e days of ele·c- . trons and matl;lematica.I vortices. An ele:men1 must b~· a c:hemiea.l individual, but not all homD.g,eneous .. bodies are chemical inJivid- tutls, for s•ea wa.te.r is a solution, We hav€ then ,the following cases.

The difference between a so·lution and a chemical indtvidu.al is. that the ~atte·r (as water) will boil or fr;eeze down to the last. drop at con- .stant temperature,. while the former {as sea water) will not.. To .explain this ln sci-entific terms, we turn to the. w:ork of Jos1a.h W'illa.rd :Gibbs, late pro- fessor of .matherp.atical physics at Yale University,, and his d·efi~ition of a phase .. Each part of a, .mechanical mixture is a pha.se. A solution, a vap.or or a . so.Jid may constitute a phase. OnJy .by forming new phases can sub- stances be purified. If, J uri:qg the formation of a new phase, tbe. proper,ties of the remainder change, then we are dealing, with a solution; if not, it is a pure sub&.t~:nce or cpe:mical ind'ividual. F'I~om this w·e can get a new .definition of an element, as -~ substance. or ehe1nicaL indiviJ.t:..ll, which never bepomes, a solution, or a m.ixtcre under .any con.d:it1o~s of temperature or pressure, or stress. of .other .circumstances. In ·order to be- C>O·me a solution or a mixture the substance must . c1ecompose. At a te.mperature suffie.iently high,. water becomes a solution of oxygen and hydrogen, thi'·Ough dissociation.

Before that tim·e sod'ium hydToxid• ~nd· pqta:ss,ium hyd.roxid were regarded as eleiifi'onts, The \Ch·em.- ic.al Philosophy\ by Sir Hlwmphry Da,vy, publisihed in 181'2, in wh1ch he reeounts .his discovery of the above mentioned alkalies, is in the lib~ary. The iHSe of. the spcctros,cope resulted in tb;e· dis·covery 1 of rubidium and ·calsium in some. German mineral ' ' water. This work wa:s ·carried out pa.rqy by Bun- sen, with who:Se '·burner\ some of us are acquaint- ed. So from the point of view of the experii~ental­ ·ist, tha.Te is no actual boundary betwee:J?: ele·ments \\and compounds, for whether a substance be an elemen. t or a compound to us, depends upon the efficiency of our' apparatus. The law of the co~­ serva.tion (unchangeability) of elements should be derived from experiment, and n()t from the atomic hypothe·Si.$. Sir William Ra.ms.ay of E:ngland has d~iseovered the p·ossibility that helium is formed from rad·ium bromid. Such exeeptions nee.ct closer stud;y to bring the quantitative side und·er some new law. ... We have here an entirely new set of facts, The eno·rmous amount of energy developed i·s quite in- c.omp.arable with the m~ost c·oncentrated form of ' energy hitherto known, that is' a mixture o·f oxygel), .n. and hydrogen, for the amount of he·at de·veloped by the transmHta!tion o·f one mUigram of radium is ' ., 5,000,000 tim·€s greater than that fr:om one mHi- gram of detonating gas. a truly d'iffe·rent order of ....... energy relations.

Dr. Wright w:a:s born in. 1 1 840.. H'e never attended ·college; but ha.<i fi.nis·hedJ h.is preliminary studies and had begun the stud·y ·O•f 1aw when the C'ivil \Var b'agan. H·e enlisted. with the Fo'tlrteenth N'e·w H.a;mp.s·h:ire Voluntee·rs: in 18.6~2 and ·bec,arne colonel of his regiment in 1864. At ·the close of the war h'e resum·ed the .study of law and co·m- mence.d practice in Bos~ton in 18'67. H'B specializeJ in patent laW aDd SO·On fi.ad a lucrative pra:ctice. His activity in social ana industrial .. affairs com- menced with his ele·c1tioa to the ' Mlass:.3Jchusett~ Sta.te Senate in 1871. His ·effi·ciency as a legislator caus~d him to b'e appointed h.ea:d of the M:assa- c·. usetts L.a.bor Bureau, whieh pos:i.tion he held for twelve years. Later he wai3 appointHd the first Federal Commissioner. of Labor and 1 held that pDst alsq fGr twelve years. T'h'a ·statistical work of these bureaus was managed w.ith. such S·kill that • Dr. Wri.ght was pla.ce.d in charge of th€ FeJeral Census of Mass1achus.etts in 18'80 and' 'Of the State Censu·s five years later, and· in 1890 pe was made director of the Federal Cens:U.s. While carrying on thes.e various governmental functions, Dr. W·righ t' wa..s also w.:innin.g diHtinc- tion as an educator and aatho·r. From 18·91 to 19·0'1 be was un.iver·si ty l'e·cturer in Harvard and from . 1895 to 19{)4 Honorary ProfesiSor of Social Elco- nomics in the Catholic University of America. In 190>0 he aecepted the cha.ir of Statistics and .Social Economi·cs in G·eorge· Washington University and in 190~2 became President of Clark College. Dr. Wright ha,s left a large amount of .sta.tist.tcal. work and several noteworthy books and· magaz.ine articles on s·oc.ial and industrial questions. Among these may be mentioned' HThe F·actory S'y·stem as an Ele-ment in CjvilizaUon,\ \Marriage and Di- vorce,\ 'DHistorical Sketch. o,f tthe Knights' o! L8.1bor,\ and \Ind.ustrial E~olution of th·e~ Unlite-d States.\ l . THE PR.ESS ·CLUB. With characteristic energy, the Press :Club is preparing for a vig·orous spring ·ca~paign. An agreeinent has been secured with Leslie's Weekly whereby _that paper is to ptiblish Ji>·ho.tographs of Union's athletic teams, games, track C'Ontests and ntembars of the various teams. T'his. alone will be. t.h.e means of keeping the name of Old Union well before the public ey·e. T'he club is also p;reparing to send its bulletins and college rrews items over a rnuch larger territory than here~tof.ore. Baston, Ncrtl:ern and Eastern New mngland. al)~ :·to . be more thoroughly covered, .and also the S·outh, es- pecially Virginia, Georgia and the Carolina-s. It will be remembered that the South once contrib- uted a large number of Union's students. Let us hope that the Press Club propaganda will be the means of regaining some of the pr·~stige of the college in tha.t section. A new c.ommittee has been added to the Press Club list. One whose purpose it shall be to ·con- duct a personal campaign in Alba:ny to turn sub- freshm·an toward Union. At a meeting of the committee a .plan of procedure was .out1ined. The club ts getting out a circular l.etter to be sent to a large number of newspapers not receiv- ing th·e club's bulletin, with a view to obta.ining a promise fro·m them to print Union news. The bulletins are .sent out weekly to about s·eveuty-five newspapers. THE PHILOMATHEAN SOCIETY. At the regular weekly n1eeting of thB Phlloma-' thean Society Wednesday, A. Mann, '12, chairm<l..n of the Freshman. Debate Committee, reported that · the 8ch·enectady High School had deemed i:t exp~­ dient to reject the society's prop·osition for a joint debate. Dr. Wright was a man <>f deep religio·us ·convic- An interesting .di.scussion was held on the .su~- tions, but was broad-minded and ·entirely frHe from ject: Resolved, That the u: S. government should dogmatis·m.

The poor condition of ' the walks around the .A Sttggestion. Campus causes a great deal of annoyance at thi~ time of year. The· cin- ders are frozen, thus keeping the water on the walks and making a very disagree- able place to· walk upon \vithout giving an~r thought . to the risks of taking cold encountered. This is a matter of import- ance and should be thoroughly considered by tho·se in authority. We are allowed so 1nany absences per tern1, but it hardly seen1s fair that a. Ihan should he co1npe1led to 'vade through mud and \Vater to those C'lasses \Yhen he has a cold .. Of course it 1nay be brought forward that . t.~e men ~hould \Y·ear rubbers, but that_ \rill not help 1nake our college walks anything but 1nudholes a?d fit \vallo,vi~g pla.~es for animals, altho-ugh during the Spring and Fall days these s·ame walks are quite at- tractive and add to the beauty of the Cam- pus. As a. solution of this problem we 'vould suggest the use of movable board 'valks 'vhich are raised so1ne distance ' . abov~ the cinder walks to keep the water a 'yay fro In the pedestrians' feet. It seetns that 'vith our increasing spirit for the bet- ter, our health should not be put in the harkground nor the co1nfort of the stu- dents negleeted for any n1ercenary rea- souR. In all our studies \Ye have been a~lvised to look out for our health, yet here 've are every day breaking those rules, and are really compelled to because of rules in the college governn1~ent and the p·oor condition of the paths on our 0an1pns.

The result is a s.chedule worthy of the cc·Tdial sup].Jort nf every Union n1an. In addition to the two local games,. 1natches are being ar- ranged with Amherst, Williams, Cornell and probably in the near' future a 1natch with either Syra.cus·e or Rochester will be booked.

12 THE. CON·CO·RDIENSIS FRENCH CONVERSATION IN THE 17TH c·ENTURY. BY F. W. SMJiTH. (Continued from last week.) Cleoni·ce.-· You are so accustomed to flatter them that you :flatter even your lady ,friends with- out thinking of what yoa are doing, but,. Arte- linde, know that I do not wtsh to sup·plant you in that wa.y, so while you are :putting your mind at rest, I declare that I never will make us,e of' your secret. Th.a t is why you need not fear to tell me your reasons, if you have any, which can n:ake me .see the great pleas11r.e there is in being forever obeyed by a hundred persons whom you do not in the least esteem and whom you c-an not love. For it surpasses belief that you are able at the ~ame instant to [:ave blonde men, dark men; tall, short, grac·eful, wearisom•e, awkward, to- gether with agreeable and intelligent men, it not being even po.ssible that so n\lany persons can be together in your heart. · Artelinde {smiling).-· You are right. But I can assure you they do not crowd one another in my heart, for I do not permit fhem to enter it. Cleonice.-But why, then, if you do not love them at all, do you act as though you did? Artelinde.-In order to have the pleasure of be- ing loved, for really, Cleoni-ce, of what good is beauty if it is not to make the eonquel:lt of hearts and estabiish an empire, where without either sceptor, throne or crown one has eve·rywhere suh jects and slave;:;? Cleonice.-But slaves who .. serve only to reign, and, moreover, slaves wb.ose fetters· you take pains to f-orge. For my part, if I were to give them anv. I should take pleasure in giving therr1 sach heavy and harsh ones that I could not doubt the fidelitv of those who should wear them. Artelinde.-lf I wished one day to recompense them, I would einploy such fetters as you sug- gest, but wishing only to amuse myself with these Jovers, it is not right that I sho·uld so humble them. Cleonice.-However, Artellnde, you do a hnn· dred very dangerous things. Artelinde.-· And what d.o I do that is so wrong? Cleonice.-You rece·ive and write letter::; and thus you deceive. You w:ant to be observed and you. look at others.. You .ma.ke appointn1ents which you do not fail to. k.eep., .and although I wen know it all ends in saying three .or four words in secret and in making a great mystery of a trifle, after all it is an app.ointmen:t; it is :a se-cret; it h~ a Iny.stery, and consequently it is wrong, one is not deeeptive about an innocent matter. M·ore than that, you receive and make little gifts, you allow your portrait to be stolen and you give it away, and a,s for ribbons, you have given some of every shade from white to bla.ck. You tell little secrets to one, you jest wit:O. a second about other people, and although you make fun or then1 all, I find, however, that you have reason to fear th.at in the end all those people will not indulge in like pl.easantries about you. For bye and bye, i~ a fancy should ta,ke all your lovers to tell one another what y.ou have done for them, wher~ would you be on account of it? Artelinde.-I should not be so bad off as you think, since after all, there is not a man who c3.n ever boast that I have ever granted ~1im the slightest favor that can rightly be called wrong. _t\.s for all that you have just said, I do not con- ~ider it in that light, and I see no more wrong tn that than in adorning myself and curling n1y hair, since one adorns one.self only to be loved, and also since I do all that you a·ccuse me of only . . to keep certain fickle l1earts that beauty alone will not keep. Cl€onice.-But what do you wish to gain by it? Artelinde.-I do it because I wish to tronble al1 the galanterie of other people, to make women jealous, to be loved by all who see rrte, to besto\v fear and hope when I please, to have a hundred amusements from which to choose, to nave verses n1ade in :tny ·praise, that people n1ay ::,peak onlv of my conquests, that I be followed everywhere. that nothing escape my power, and besides ail that, I wish never to exercise my heart any more than it is necessary in order to hear sorr1e sweet . sentiment breathed out concerning me, and bst- I:v, I wish to love galanterie and not t.o love :=t gal ant.

Cleonice.-That if, slightly ·dangerous, for may it not happen that at last s·ome one wHl be found who will embarrass your heatt a little in spite of you? Artelinde.-You who are cold and austere are more exposed to that vexatious event than I :u~, I who am so aocustomed to tears and sighs that At the banquet and annual meeting of the Hamilton College Alumni of Brooklyn, February 5, th'ere were present a large number of young m:en who are U(}W students in the Brooklyn P~·ly­ techn.ic or in the Brooklyn High 8'chools.

But you irn· purpose of impres.sing upon them the de·s'irabil:ity perious women, who you have been left a~one for some time and ~ou have become haughty and cruel, if some lover comes who obstinateiiy binds himself to serve you, and at last c-01npels you to hear his suit, two or three tears will soften your hearts, or better said, a spark will set them on fire, and thus finally you will love hin ... at .. least as much as be loves you, and perhaps a little more. . 1 Cleonice.-Your temperament is so different from those haughty ones of whom you s,peak, that it is indeed difficult for you to know wh.at they are capable ()f doing. Do you not think that yout:1 cannot always last and that ,old age and galan- terie have an antipathy so decided that nothing IS more op_posit:e? What will you do bye and bye when your galants have all left you? Artelinde.-Let us not be so far-f,igh:ted. As for me I consider myself so well off in not think- ing of so many things, that I do not wish to be of your opinion, nor to become too prudent for fear of be\ing unhappy. It suffices for m.€ in the season of roses to look into my mirror, to see if what little beauty I have will last until the fir~t vi-olets, and when I am sure it will, I put my mind at rest. ('1'0.

THE CoNCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXII. UNION COLLEGE, MARCH 13, 1909 No. 16 UNION WltNtS iF ROM HAMIL TON.. Union's De,bating ream Wins Another Victory. The second annual debate between Union and Harr.lilton was he]d Fdday evening, March. 3, in the chapel at Han1ilt()n. College. The subject of the debate was: \R.€solved That Canadian lun!- ber ::,hould be admitted to the United States :fr(?e of duty.\ Union's. tea:m, whicfi upheld the neg[1· tive of the question wa.s composed of Bartlett, '1(}; Wilson~ '09, and Mou~Cl, 09, with .S. M. ·Cavert, '10, as altern.ate. Harnnton..''s team, which waB .corn· posed entirely of sen:iors, was Truax, Rifenbark and Wallace, with Dounc.e as alternate. The debate was opened at 7: 3:0 o'clock, at whieh time the college cha)>el wa~ well filled with st 1 l- clents and visitors. President .Stryker was unah~e to preside on a-cccn1nt of illness and his place was taken by Prof. Calvin. .A. Lewis. In the opening speeches, which occ-upied eight rr~inutes each, the two teams waged an. almost evenly pitched con- test. All of the speakeTs made strong, convincing s·peeches in their ·ope1il.ing but on the rebutta1 t_rnio;n t'howed marked. superiority. The relative merits of tile two teams were impartially shown by ~ statement in tll.,e Utica Daily Press, wh!r.h says that in the rebuttal the Union team picked cut the arguments of their opponents and &n · swered them clearly an_d to the point; while fiam- ilton was largely sattsfied to repeat 'her for 1 nr.r arguments and floulnd er about in rather an aimless fashion. The debate wa.s opened by Truax, '09, nf llam- ilton, who showed th€ importance of tb.e quec;;. Uon and emphasized tbe condition::, of the limited lumber supply of the United States. He outlined the affirmative side of t'he contentiQn fron1 the standpoint of labo1·, bile ultimate consume~· and tl1e conservation of t1le forests. Union's first sp-ea,ker was Bartlett, 'lOs who, after thanking Hamnton for their cordial hospita1 ity, showed that the affirmative had failed to de· ID.ne the term \lumber and so had not rnade the essential distinction between lumber on the one hand, and timber and logs on the other. After showing that free lumber would affect the \Vest and the East in different ways, he outlhted the n.egative'& objections to free hn11ber from tho three-fold aspect of injury to t'he general businef!s ~tnterests 'of the Northwest, injury to conditions in the East, and menace to forest conservation. lle sl:owed conclusively that free lu1nber could n1ean only disa&ter to the lumber interests of the N·ort~I­ west, general business and financial depressi~n, and jeopardy to populous Western cities. Rifenbark, '09, was easily the star debater ·on Hamilton's team. After portraying the tremen- dous increase in the price of lumber during the past few years, 'he argued that free lumber would guarantee lower and more stable prices, and t:1at ' the lumber IT\\t·onopolies are the only class benP· fited by the tariff. Wilson, '09, sec·ond speaker for Union, showed that under free lumber the 1Jnited St~tes WOl!ld bt~ made a dumping ground for the low grades o~ Canadian lumber, and on accouu.t of the!r cheaper transportation facilities and lower taxa- tion would drive the Ameri-can low grade manu- fr.,cturers out of the rnarket. For this reason VH~ American lumber1nan de1nan.ds protection in. the Ea.st as well as in the markets of the West. Wallace~ '09, took up the -contention of the affir- mative that free lumber would prove a benefit to the lumber resources of our ·country, arguing that the removal of the tariff wa::, the only rr.·ean8 of saving our forests. :Vlould, '09, closed the' direct argument, sh-O\V· ing that free lumber would prove a menace rather than a benefit to forest\ conservation, because thA disastrous con1petition in low grades would rf'- sul t in the l·ow grades being left in the woods to deeay and furnish fuel for forest fires.

So1utious of KlNO 3, Na Cl~ K 01 and Na No 3 a.re all neutral to litmus, fl,nd on mixing in pair~, t'he re!:,ulting solutions are also neutral, whieb is the simple fact to be expected. Now, in some of these mixtures there must be a mutual decorr~­ position, for the :first two on mixing give a solu- tion identical with that obta,ined on mixing the last two, KjNQ 3 and Na 01 de·compose ·one another, and add to so.me NaCl just enough KNO 3 so that the E,Odium of the NaCI gets exactly saturated with the nitric acid of the KNo 3. Then a certain amount of hydrochloric acid will be liberated fro:rr. the NaCl and another am·ount of potassium from K'No 3, and since the solution remains neutral, just as much hydrochloric acid Inust have been liber- ated, as was necessary to comb~ne with the potas- sium. The perrnanence of neutrality provef:l fhat definite numerical ratios exist between the 8n1oilnts of acids and b:lses f-orming neutral salts. 1 If by ·Chance the reader feels impelled to perus~ this a second time, I woHld · .strongly advif:,e Atoms of different elements must differ in. .shape, size, weight, etc. Then if a eompound is formed ty combining different atoms, the weight of each eiement in the compound rnust be proporti::tnal to the we,ight5 of t 1 he corresponding atoms. This follows only if the atoms of ·a. ,given element are equal an1ong themselves. Dalton found this to be true, :Uor the water or sulphur boiling away first, is no lighter· than ·that :remaining. This extended t:h.e experiiRe'Iltal law of Richter by startin3 fro~ a hypothetical assum.]!)tion and drawing bnportant but unpro-ven conclusions. Be.rzeliub in 1809 began to, base Dalton's law on experiment and spent his whole life develop ing analyti·cal chemistry, and determining atomic weights. To~day the law c!lf con:ibining weights rests on quantitative investigation wahout any r~ference to the atomic 'h.yp()tbesis. The law of c-ombining wHigb.ts may also be de- duced from an empirical fact, in .a way similar to that in which Ri·chter found his law.

If the ratio between the barium and the sulfur in the sulfite ib different from that in ·the sulf~te, .and! excess of sulfYric acid or of barium wouia be formed . Berzelius found n:o such excess.

Tbe weight of B UEled h1 the combining weight of B, and the sum of the weig 1 h.ts of A and B, the com])ining weight of the compound A B. Combine this weight of A B with C to form A B C; the amount of C used is the combining weight of C. ~ow forrr1 the e.om·pound A B C in another way. Combine A with C to form AC, and then A·C with B to form A C B. As t!he properties of a sub- stance are independent of tile way in which we get it, A C B is identical with ABC. We have ·.:now found the combinin~ weight of C with A B, an·a\ also with A. These must be equal, for other- wise A C B and A B C wotl.ld not be the same.

Thus we have the law of .combining weights as t 1 he result of experiment w.ithout the help of the .atomic hypothesis. Richter a.rranged the combining weights in the order of their magnitude and said that there were certain numerical relations netween the numbers.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS FRENCH 'CONVERSATION IN THE 17TH CENT'U:RY. BY F. W. Sl\UTH. (Continued from last week.) In Mlle. ScU:dery'oS writteN. \Conversations of whieh. there are twelve, some exceedingly perti- nent thought in regard to the art of conversation are set forth. To quote from her: But to return to Madame de Rambouillet. When she was about 3.5 years of •age she was attacke.d by a strange malady. S11:e found that fire strangely heated her bl,ood, and· this P-Ven in winter, so th.at sh·e was obliged to be s-creened from its influence. As sh·e was extremely f.ond of society she int~o~ duced the Spanish alcove into her house. Her guests would often gather about her bed' in this alcove for the purpos·c of hold:ing conversation and when Madame held receptions she could hear all tllat was sajd in the roo1n adj-oining the al- cove. The space hetw~en the :bed aiE.td the wall was known as the l':lrt'®late, a-1r:d r;ucl:l·e and the wall was known -as the ruelle, and ruelle and alco·ve cam·e to be synonytmous. T 1 he al·cove was more properly used for informal calls, but when the Precieus·e moven1ent had widely ·spread, the ruelle was much us:ed and an etiquette pecu- liar to the. ruelle s.p.rang up, Subjects for (~onver­ saUon were p·roposcd in advance and· were looked np as carefully as though for .d·a·bate. \Conversat:on ous-ht r..ot to be Umited too muc:J to don1estic subj.e·cts, nor turned exclusively upon the Jubjec;: of dre~s. as often happens when women are alone, If one should write all that fifteen or twenty '\vomen should say when they are together, it would make the w-or3t sort of hook Lnaglnable, and th~t, too, if those wo1nen should be very intelligent. But let a man, not necessarily distinguished, enter the roon1 and the conversation will become at once unconstrained and regular, wittier and more agreeable. I con- ceive that it ·ought :more often to be about ordi· nary and galant II':atters than about great sub- jectb. I believe, tho:.1gh, that there is nothing wilich cannot enter therein; that it ·ought to be free and diversified accordlng to the timf~, place and persons with whom it is earried on, and that the .secret lies in speaking a~ways nobly of low matters, simply of elevated ones aud very gallantly of galant things., without either haste or affectatio11. Further on, the \Queen of the Hamedis'' (lV.l]le. Soudery) lay:s down the principle fhat an asBem- bly o;f both sexes is ne·ces·sary for true conver- sation. She .says : \There is a .certain some- th·ing that enable a clever .gentleman to brighten and amuse an assembJage of ladies, which is not possessed by the cleverest lady.\ As time went on, the conversation peculiar to the period becam:e extremely coru.plimentary in character and tile law was laid down in order to !prevent dryness or wearisomenes& in conversa- tion, that the comJ>liment should. not be ara wn forcibly but born H.aturally from the discourse. ·One mi:ght easily judge that the Precieus8 m·ovement wou1d be pro<luctive of exaggeration. We find an author writing thus: ''The revolution of the earth is clearly seen in the ruelle. Three or :Eour Preci,euses wHl discuss in one afternoon all that the sun can have seen in his journey through the seasons. There is nothing hidden from their minds or eyes; they have means of penetrating even to the thoughts and secrets of hearts~ Their principal object ·is the \Seat~ch for bon rr1ots.\ And La Bruyere 'in writing of the I•recieuses relates: \Not long since there was a circle of persons composed of both sexes, bound together by conversation and by the intercilang~ of wit. They left to the vulgar the art of speak· ing intelligibly. If some one said something blindly, another person made it more obscure and then some one else outdid that by making it ' truly enigmatical. This they called senthnent, delicacy, turn, a subtlety of expression. Th~n finally came to be no longer understood bv t:P.emselves. To eontribute to these ·conversR- tions, judgment, mem·ory nor talent was neces- sary. Wit was necessary, not the best, but t11at which is false, and in which the imagination pla:'rs a great part.\ Doubtless La Bruyere is slightly more severe than i£le is warranted in being .. It is well known, however, that there were con.ve,:r~1ational excessf~s

Al- thHugh not an alumnus of the college, he ha.s for several yea.rs paBt, a.s one of her tru,stees,, been honored an.d respected by a.Il Uni>On men. Mr. Starin was horn in 1825, and the greater part of his successful life has been s:pent in N•ew York city. He twice was sent t·o GongTes's as th·~ repre·se.ntative of his district. As a permanent memorial of his · congres~sional service, we have the monument at Schuylerville commemorating the victory of the Battle of S 1 aratoga.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 10A TRACK PROSPECTS. Promising Mater·ial in the Freshman Class. A careful consideration of the material available for this season's track activities indicates that in all probability Old Unio11' will be strongly repre- sented on the oval. The team will not suffer to any extEnt from loss of members occasioned by U:.e gra.duatinn of the class of 1908. It is, however, true, that of thi..s class Pars·ons, Dwyer, Flowers, Bell and Fullerton did excellent work, but their places will, from present indicatio-ns, be satisfac- torily filled by studen-ts of the Freshman class. Cavtain Ranldn has been doing excellent work in the weight events during the wintEr and will, no cloubt, be of great value in these events this sea- son. In fact it will not be ~:mrprising if he estab- lishEs a new college record in the shot put. Strei- bert. in the broa.cl jump and pole vault, will doubt- less acquit himself with credit this season, while Ii'inch is expected to show up well in the distanc·e runs. Among tl~e membErs of the class of 1910 who are expected to aJcl materially to the strength of th·c team are Dennis, in the low hurdle8 and broad jmnp, Hequemhourg in the 220, 440 and high jump and vValser in the high hurdl'e!S. The S•Ophomore class will doubtless be represented by Bentley in tl~e .s:nints. Travis in the distance runs, H. Ruth- steiner in the high jump. The freshman class contains some v~ry promis- ing 1n.aterial. Case has accomplished excellent results in the pole vault this winter, and in all probability he will establish a new college record in thi.s ·event. Both Hand and Smith appear to be likely point winners in the weights. Riley is expected to do good work in the pole vault and sprints, while Goward will prove a source of strength in the 440 and 880·. Marsh can b'e de- pended upon to do good w·ork in the pole vault, W. T. Mann in tte middle distances a.nd MeDer- Dr. McComber, in sp·eaking a.bout the probable success of the team this seas()n, said: ''In general the degree of success of the tracl\ tean1 this year will be in propoTtion t::> the amount of practice which the men composing· the team receives. Consequently it is the duty of every s·tudent who expects to partidpate in track ac- tivities this spring, to start training immediately, a ~1d to continually and consistelil tly train up to tl~e c1~se :Jf the track season.\ Dr. McComber inaugurated spring work on Mon- day, when he held a short crQsS-cGuntry run. It i.s hoped that all the candidates f·or this y·-2ar' s track team will follow Dr. \.Mac'~\ advice and place themselves under his directions, starting training im1ne~.1iately and continuing training up to the close -of tl:e track season. WHY NOT REVIVE AN OLD TRADITION? In times pa.st it was the custom to give the An~ nunl Commencement Concert oif the Musical Clubs on the Mo~-::awk River. The clubs assembled in beats or canoes and paddled to a central position in tt e river: and the audience surrounded them in ether canoes. It was tl;.e custom for parti-es to g·ive \RivEr-Teas\ on that night previous .to the ccncert, w:1ich occurred at about 8 o'clo'Clc The strains of music coming- across tl: e water ll{)t only souiH1ed very well, but the concert itself wa..s a r:.nique idea. among colleges. Ttere is no reason why the idea can not l.Je n'- vh-ecl. It woulct be comparatively easy to atran~e some means by which the clubs r;on1rl be floated- a raft could be nutcle and strung \vith Japanese lantt'rns or some-thing of the so~t. If this IHOVP(l too muc~1 cf a ti:lsk. -ordinary TOv,rlJoats could b? lashetl together and serve the lHll\DOSe. The M o- ha wl\ is at its best at that time of the ~'ear and a concert of this 1\incl wonlrl provide an excellent cp portunity for the Commencernent visitors to see matt and O'Laughlin in the sprints, with Ruprect it under the most .favorable circumstances. The in the distance runs. In addition there are numer- ous other possibilities among the other candidates, among which may be mentioned Thorn, Grey, Law- sing, T. Dunn and Kelley. chief advantage of the whole t11ing would be that at no other college in the countt·y coulcl a silnilar entertainment be found. Think. it over and talk it np. C. L. M., '0!-1.

The ba.seball team at the University of Minnesota has been practicing on a diamond covered with three inches of snow. John D. Rockefeller recently gave $1,UOO,O·OO to Chicago University. This Jllakes the endowment fund of the university $15,00·0.,0@{}, w.hile Mr. Rocke- feller's total contributi-ons for ·endowment and other purposes a.mount to nearly $25,·0·00·,000. According to a faculty announcement at Colum- bia, students. may cut all of their lectures and recitations until the end of the term, and if they are bright enough to pass a g·ood examination they will receive credit without regard to percent- age of attendance. All abseaces since F'ebruary 1 have been wiped off the records. At th.is same place the boa.rd of student representatives has promulgated a d:ecree which states that hereafter the only hazing which ca11 be indulge.d in by the second year men is to give a. tea party on the opening day of the college year. Tln~ intercla.s.s rush was also confined to organized yelling and the annual \Sophomore'' smoker has as well been relegated to past times.
