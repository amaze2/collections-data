THE C ·o·- N: - ·C ~oR·: o·. I·· E.· . : .. ~ : ~ ' ·, ' : . . ' ' ·' . - ' \ NSIS DR. WELLS IS EIGHTY -SIX BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION WEDNESDAY Union's \grand old man,\ Professor William W-ells, Ph. D., LL. D., one of the most remark- able men Union College has ever had on its faculty, celebrated his eighty-sixth birthday Wednesday. During the course of the day he was visited by many members of the faculty re- ceiving many congratulations on the day and on his remarkably good health. Dr. Wells was born in New York City in the year 1820. His boyhood and youth were spent in Philadelphia, where he gained his academic education and be- gan the study of foreign tongues. This study was carried on throughout his whole life, mak- ing him a linguist, of no small fame. Prof. Wells not only knows, as professors should know, but is perfectly conversant in seven differ- l'vro 22. a representative of the New York Hera,ld. He then went to Paris, where he studied at the Sor- bonne and the College de France. Afterwards he travelled over a large part of Europe, re- turning to this country in 18 51. The year following was spent in Cincinnati, where Dr. VV!ells was chosen to deliver the ad- dress of welcome to Louis Kossuth, when the Hungarian patriot visited that city. In 185 2 he was elected Professor of Modern Languages in Genesee College, Lima, N. Y. He remained there twelve years, at the same time acting as principal of Genesee Wesleyan Seminary. In 1865 Union called Dr. Wells to the chair of modern languages and literature, which posi- tion he filled from that time until 1902, when his advancing years forced him to give up active work and become an emeritus professor. In ent languages. 1872 Indiana Ashbury University, now known as In 1846 Dr. Wells made his first trip to De Paw University, conferred upon Prof. Wells Europe, spending a year in Vienna as an un- official attache of the American legation, while at the same time he pursued studies at he uni- versity. From Vienna he went to Berlin, where he entered the university and in due time gradu- ated with the degree of Ph. D. It was at that time in the world's history that all Europe was thrown into revolt and it is scarcely necessary to say that Prof. Wells was intensely interested in the great events of pro- gress about him. The story of his personal par- ticipation in the history of the day is a very interesting one, and among other things con- tains \'an experience in the German riots which convinced him that he could not cope with the German cavalry. After this he went to the Ger- man parliament at Frankfort-on-the-Main as secretary to the special American embassy. While there he became the first foreign corre- spondent of an American newspaper, acting as his degree o.f LL. D., and in the same year he . ' was elected a lay delegate to the first general conference of the Met'hodist Episcopal Church that admitted laymen to its meml;>ership. He was re-elected to the next conference in 1876, of which conference he served as secretary. In 1887 the duties of Professor Wells were added to by his being made lecturer on current history at Union. In the interest of that work he travelled through nearly all the countries of the world. On his return from his fourth visit from the Old Wlorld he was welcomed home by the alumni of Union with a. magnificent demon- stration in New York harbor,. which attested the deep respect and affection with which he is. re- garded by Union men. Professor Wells was one of the founders of the Drew Theological Seminary and has ever since its founding been one of the trustees of the. sen1.inary.

At ~ighty-six years, however, he is still a man of 'Wt>hderful and diverse knowledge.

White, '7.9: College Lawlessness (From. the ~ew York Evening Post.) A folly of the American college, for \Yhi:ch its faculties are primarily responsible, is the ~r-eten­ tion in this enlightened day .of the medi~eval idea that the college community is not a men- able to the law. An ordinary citizen could not kick in another citizen's door without se-ri0us danger of being shot, under the legal right of • self-defence, or arrested and punished in the courts. As between . students in American c~l­ lege buildings, such action may be indulged in with almost complete impunity. The student is not encouraged by the faculty to mainta·in its own right, and it is rare that the college a uthot:- ities in such a case will go any further than to demand repair of the damage to property. The offence against the laws of the State is abso- lutely ignored. It is only in colleges situated in the larger cities, where outside presure is heavier, that college authorities have shown the slightest tendency to invoke the aid of the authorities against student lawlessness. '[':J.:tere is no need or argument to prove that this is no such tra.ining for law-abiding citizens'hip as the American college is under moral obligation to furnish. No one asks that the life of the col- lege student should be one of unrelieved .rn€ntal drudgery. Such a. regime would defeat its ()Wn end as fully as that end is defeated under pres- ent conditions. It is a reasonable demand, bow- ever, that the play of the college should be subordinate to its work, that it should be kept on a level of dignity and respectability C()ln- mensurate with the serious place in life which ' ',• ' . ] I I t l t i E \ a ] t e v f :E c il

Dr. Wright's Book The Adjustment of Observations-By the Method of Least Squares, with Applications to Geodetic Work.\ By Thomas Wallace Wright, Professor Emeritus, Union College, with the co- operation of John Filhnore Hayford. \For nearly a quarter century Wright's Ad- justment of Observat:ons has held the chief place among American \\Vorks deaUng with the theory and the application of the method of Least Squares, and the appearance of a modified second edition shows that however limited the public to which the book appeals, it has found within its sphere a raison d•etre. As originally published, the work represented, primarily, al- though not exclusively, the practice is followed in the adjustment of the ·geodetic \\Vork of the U. S. Lake Survey. But the new edition stands upon a somewhat different footing, bearing upon its title page the name o.f one of the chief offic- ers of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, whose co-operation breaks the work as an authorative exposition of the methods of numer- ical adjustment at present used in that bureau. From this standpoint the treatise must command the attention and interest of every American engineer and astronomer engaged in geodetic work, and may well serve as a. reference volume for higher instruction in schools of engineering.\ Engi11eering ~ews, March 15, 190 6. (A copy of this book has been placed in the College Library.) Chapel Choir Owing to the fact that it seemed hardly fair for the choir leader to give choir seats to an indefinite number of men, picked out indiscrim- inately, in some cases regardless of vocal ability, when there are a hundred other men in college just well fitted for the places, It was deem.ed made the club in former years, and ce1 tain of the Instrum·enta'l Club, together with the assist);.. ant pianists, take the choir seats. Accordingly the list \\Vas revised and placed upon. the bulle- tin: board. The notice was defaced, dou btlE'::;s by a Freshmen vvho hasn't learned college cu·~­ toms, and sera wled across it we·re these word3, ''v\Tho in h runs the choir?'' It might be \Y,eH to suggest that it has always been the cus- t<;>m for the choir leader to pick the choir. How- ever, if one or two men who have never done any Glee Club work while in college wish to in- sist in butting in, whether or not they are on the list, they merely make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of the rest of the stl!ldent body, any man of w'hom should have a like privilege. The list as posted was as follows: Second tenors-Corbin, Watson, Cantwell, Sno·w, Manghan, Perry, White, Pianist; Shelley, Basses-Bell, Kline, Osborne, O'Donnell, Faust, W'eyranch, pianist; King, '06. Richardson, '07, Reeder. In Memory of Dr. Nott Bishop Henry C. Potter has had placed on the I . wa.ll of the Presbyterian Church at Cherry Val- ley, Otsego County', a costly ta\tllet in memory of his grandfather, Rev. Dr. EJliphalet Nott, who assumed charge of the Cherry Valley Cb. urch some years after the Indian massacre in 1778, in which the family of his predecessor, Rev. Mr. Dunlap, was slain. The inscription on tbe tablet reads. as follows: \Clarum .et Venerable Nomen. This stone is placed here to commem- orate the Rev. Eliphalet Nott, D. D., LL. D., for sixty-one years president of Union college; from 1796 to 1798 pastor of this church and princi- pal of the academy.\ At the base of the tablet, tbe words alternating with the bishop's crozier, mare and the coat of arms of the Potter family, isthe added inscription: \N epotis ex Voto, 1904.\ The tablet will be dedicated with appro- priate exercises on Bishop Potter's return from Eu.rope.-Daily Union.

On Tuesday, March 2 6, a fire broke out in the basement of Washburn Hall, originating in a closet in the southern end of the building, from a box of matches. This closet is quite near the 50 0 volt switch-board that supplys the light for the campus. The fire followed along a bea,m until it reac·hed this switch-board which it de- stroyed. Thus short circuiting the lighting line of the remainder of the basement. The steam- fitter at work at a pipe that was broken in the boiler room went over to see the cause for the lights going out and on arriving there he found the fire and at once summoned the fire depart- ment.

Making calls can be summa'l'ized ir1to t'vo great classes-viz: Business and social. There is no mixture of the two, and any call which is attempted on double lines ends in a frost.

You might hang around until the last minute, to enjoy as long as possible the pleasures of caressing· father's country runs to harden· the fellows.

VVith these pleasant spring days, our thoughts naturally turn toward the rapidly approaching end of the college year and :for the seniors, of the college course. \Vith these con1e other thoughts of that cap of the whole. year, co1niT1encen1ent ti111e, with its exercises aid farewell good tin1es. To many of us the ti1ne of the week is the Senio1- Ball, tovvarcls the tnaking of which the best of its kind every Senior class bends all its energies. It is of the Ball that we wish to speak particularly here. \1\Thile given by the Seniors, it is as n1uch a general college function as are the Hops and the Soiree. It reflects n1ore or less directly upon the colege itself if this affair is not one of t'he n1ost brilliant social events that the city af- fords. This can only be accon1plished by the active co-operation of all in college, ir- respective of class. For so1ne tin1e the con1n1ittee has been activelv at work to \' n1ake this year's Ball successful, as far as their work is concerned. they pron1ise the best ever. The 11111sic will be the best that can be secured about here. The catering will be of the best. For the decorations those who can re1ne1nbet are referred to the 'o6 Soiree, which they hope to surpass. In the line of dance orders, a noveltv is pron1ised. But the best news of all is the absolute assnrance that the dance can be held on the can1p11s, for the first tin1e since the 'o6 Soiree. The con1n1ittee has secured the · new electrical laboratory, vvhich will be forn1ally opened at fhat ti1ne. Fron1 this it will be seen that the con1n1ittee is doing its best. The rest is up to the 1nen in col- lege, 111ost particularly, of course, to the Seniors, whose annnal tax helps carry the affair through financiaHy. Let's get to- gether and welcon1e the college dances back on the Hill. It is not too earlv to be- . gin to n1ake plans and to laY aside the penn1es. BASKETBALL Juniors 22-Freslunen 31. The Juniors met the Freshmen for the fk st time in the High School gymnasium on \Vednes- day night, April 1 Hh. The Freshmen played excellent ball dueing the first half, the score at its end being 16 to 4 in their favor. At the beginning of the secon.d half the Juniors got together, and it looked as if they \Vere determined to win, but owing to bad passes and numerous fumbles they only brought their score up to 22. AI though the Freshmen seemed to lose spirit they succeeded in gaining 15 more points. Osborne threw 1nost' of the baskets for th .. e Juniors; Perry and Brown for the Freshmen.

Wiilliams has l([)st several stars fro1n 'her last year's team and is not h1 the best condition, so though Union is H()it too hopeful, yet she ex- pects at least to give \t\Villiams a hard game. If some of the men can go over and help the tean1 on with rooting, we baye a very good chance. :Baseball The first baseball game of the year \Yas played on the campus, Wed11·esday afternoon, \vhen the VaTsity lined up aga.i,nst a strong scrub for a five inning battle. The tea:ms were pretty evenly 1na tclled as the score, three to two, ind.icates. Davis pitched well for tlre regulars allowing but two hits, one of which was the scratch order and would have bee11. captured by anything but \ ice-wagon\ work. ~on.vood did well and while not see1ning to exet~t hhnself, held the hard hitters down tto four safeties. one a two-sacker by H'ilclreth. The field work <Jf the regulars \-vas far fr01n encouraging. Both scrub runs were due to rank Varsity errors. Tllere was a general looseness about the play whicll. will probably be remedied by 1nore outdoor work. It is necessary, if we are win today's game. · Ldn.e-up: Va1·s:ity. Scrub.

Snme-- one sent n1e a catalogue a week ago and by the same n1aH I had a n1ighty cordial Letter from :l senior do\vn there. It seems that he knows a fel- \ low whose mother is acquainted ·with mine. Yes, and he said ni.y father's great-uncle had a cousi·t who went to Union. He thinks the me1nbers of the fmnily ought to keep in line. It n1.ust be a great place. There is a gy1nnasiun1 ''equipped with new apparatus and adapted to the purposes of providing excellent oportunities for :physical training.\ They say there is a very interestin<; n1useu1n of natural history. Best of all the carnpuR itself is especially beautiful in the spring. The grass wiH be frEsh and green and the trees an!l foliage \YiH be adorned -vvith all the beauty of budd·· ing leaves. I guess I'll go dovvn to Schenectady and see the place. Such kind of things appeal to me. * * * * Yes, \Vnthrop met n1e at Ballston and \Ye took the trolley in to Schenectady. We got off at the back gate and started to walk across the campus. I twisted rny ankle on the way. You see they use ashes and cobble-stones to 1nake the paths with. Winth1·op pointed out the famous garden and brook. I looked and saw a ragged old fence and a gully with about three quarts of water in tbe bot·- tom. Ho·wever, it was gaily. decorated with old newspapers and letters. I tore my coat on the barb-\vire fence but that didn't rn:=tke any differ- ence. Of course I wanted to see the gyrn right a\vay so \Ye started out for it. Before we got there we walked around the grounds. It doesn't make any difference where you walk-there's more dirt than grass. Teams as well as students seem to prefer the grass to the road. W:e walked by tha power house and saw more scenery-dirt, wagon- ruts, a tall black chimney belching forth clouds of heavy smoke and trees-dead ones. Well, we

I J I , THE CONCORDIENSIS got to the bulletin board and one of the first thing;::; that struck my eye was thi.s: \Every senior rnust register their names.\ I asked about the tennis-court nearby. \No that's not a a tennis-court-it's our skating r.ink,\ said \Vinthrop. \Oh! Do you skate 1nuch on it?'' \W'ell you see we would,\ replied W.intluo.p, ''only it doesn't hold water. We don't ·want to gro,,· any grass on it because then people \vouldn'::. know it was a skating rink.\ Just then a fresl1man came up and \Ve had to go to dinner. We went by the gym in such a hurry that I only had tin1e to see the broken windows. I had such a good tilne in the eYening that I fOI'got about the gym and the Natural History Museum. I'll \\\Hit until next fall to see them. ? ? ? Last vVednEsday noon as I sat all alone in th~ chapel waiting for one of the students, I became conscious of a slight noise behind me. I looked back but saw nothing out of the ordinary and so returned to 1ny Book of Marks and Attendance Then the rustling noise was repeated, this time so 1nuch louder and more distil1ctly that I was able to locate it as con1ing fr01n the corner of the gallery. So up to the gallery I went, all eyes and ears, to find out ·what might be going on., for I knew tha. t there shou.ld be no one in the chapel at that tirne. As I reached the top of the stair I saw the statut:-: of Pheobus Apollo slowly turning the corner. The figure moved slowly and careful'y as if half afraid to rely upon his shapely limbs. His back wag to\vard 1ne and I concealed rnyself behind one of the cases, but I Inust confess, not without som3 fear and a we. The ''Far Darter\ finally l~eached the statue of Pallas Athena, 1nade a graceful bow and addressed her in classic language. I will give you as close q_ translation as I can remember. \Hail Bl'ight Elyed Goddess. The seasons have rolled around once since last I left ITIY base of clay. Jove's thunde1 bolt on the sculptor who al- lowed me but scant area to exercise in! Had it not been for him, long since would I have left these Classic Halls to wander forth. For the honor of th~ old Gods has been forgotten, and the little me11. has sto:Len all our po,ve,ress. Dost thou remember that day when on the shore nea,r Troy I sfew the Greeks when thou assisted ·when the Son of Atreus ' dishonored my priest? Ah, those \·ere glorious days. But hO\\' the greedy n1en have taken m.v boco and covered quiver and will not give then1 back. Even here at the College of Concord, wher·~ form,erly I ~1a ve bE· en forgotten and clishonm:ed.

'The College-\ He was cut short by a great roaring laugh and a cyclopean voice said: \We'll soak the Freshmen $45 for those keyholes; -n1y rent falls due next Monday.\ Apollo with a look of deep disgust on his classi~ features slunk back to his pedestal. But Herrnes on hearing the glad news, shook his snake stick, turned a back sumn1ersa ult and stood on his hand . ..; then righted hin1self, and all was quiet again in the chapel. Very quietly and in deep '\'onder I went do\n1 the stairs and out of the chapel, that great laugh f'till l'inging in n1y ears. But I deten11ined tJ watch those old students.

·THE ~CO~CORD£ENSTS ~ I Union in the ComptroHer's Office In the libra,ry there is a volu1n,e entitled \A Hun- dred Y~ears in the Cotnptroller' s Office,\ being an interesting account of 1nore than a century's in- cmnibents of that posUion in this State. An inter- esting point to L'\nien m~en is ·the compa!l·atively large nun1ber of Union Alumni -who have held this . office, with honor to then.1sel ves and thei:r Aln1a ' Mater. The total nurnber has been thirty, among whom your reporter discovered five Uni~on ~nen. The first graduate in the office was John Savag~ of the class of 1799, vvho \Vas New York's fiHh co1nptroHer. It is said of hirn, \He exhibited can- dor industry, caution and ex:ce:llent judgment.\ • He was later offered the office of ChanceHor and Treasurer of the United States but declined. The next Union man to occupy the position, the fourteenth in order, 1vas John C. Wright, 1820, a la ·wyer and Den1ocrat of Schenectady. He held office fron1 1852 to 1854. The eighteenth cornptroller ,,~as Robert Dennis- ton, also of the class of 1820, holding office from '60 to '62. He 1vas a Republican, frnm Salisbury Mills. \His ad1ninistration \vas 1vise and conservative. especially in vie·w of the fact that he served during- the first year of the War.\ W. F. Allen, '26, a distinguished lawyer and Democrat of Os1vego took office in 1868, having al- ready served as U. S. District Attorney. He was the twenty-first in office. He was re-elected in 1869 but resigned in 1870 to a.ccept appointment as Judge of the Court of Appeals. In 1869, he had as his opponent Horace Greeley. Tlle last U'nion man to hold the office was N'el- son K. Hopkins, '42, who twice defeated the former incumbent A. P. Nichols. He was a lawyer and ' . a Republican. \Though this was the beginning and end of his career in State politics yet in those four wears ('72 to '76) he left a record of splendid and faithful work.''

Greek letter fraternities have become such settleJ institutions in the North that vi·e seldon'l think of the precarious existence of those in the South. Though the disapproval of state legislatures is not general still there is a decided avei·sion to the in- stitution. Four years ago the anti-Greek letter fraternity agitation in Arkansas led to a statute forbidding them, a statute subsequently pronounced unconstitutional. This year the feeling of hos- tHity passed over to Mississippi and the legisla- ]

T'HE CON,CORDIENSIS 9 ture voted ~ot the elhnina tion of fraternities in the State Cnivetsity. This action led to violent oppo- sition on the part of the students so that the trouble was only intenslfied. 1n order to correct the diif:ficulty the o bj.ectionable biU was revoked and a cmnn1ission \vas appoii1teQ. to visit the in- stitution. After a study of the conditions, this comn1issiGn recommended certain restrictions.

14 rfHE C'ONCORDIENSlS Track Notes Again this year the \York on tih.e track has been smnewha t harnpered by the inclemency .of the weather. The track has been very soggy up to Ure present tim.e, but by a good deal of work it has been \Y·orked ~nto somewhat better shape. Fel thausen w:ith the assistance of othe~r men has been working on_ the track for two weeks. A new·· take-off for the broad ju1np has been made anJ every-thing that can be done to 1nake the field bet- ter for the n1en is being attended to. Captain Waldron has been laid up with a. sprained ankle for over a ·week. Whether he will be able to run very soon or not is a ql::lestion. How-- ever he is on the field daily with the n1en, and has every rnan directly under his care. There are quite_ a number of freshmen out and If steady work is done all the men n1.ay n1.akie thenl- selves of a great deal of use to the team. This fact ought to be held in mind: -The trach lTI:anageinent has done all it can to make this year's track t~am sucessful, ~nd the rest remains with the men who make up the team. Don't think that you kno\v better what you can do than the captai11 or coach, co1ne out and show what you can do and let them. judge. Tb,e rubbing tables also have been set up down- stairs in the gym. Felthausen is there to rub every one that has been out for a run, and to avoid taking advantage of this is to avoid your duty to the track team. Last year Triuity administered a defeat to us: that we do not like to think about; if we are for· tunate eno~gh to get another chanoe let's try to make a better showing. ---,- Tennis Notes The entries for the tennis tournament have· come .in slowly.
