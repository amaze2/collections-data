Sterling Miorton was recent:ly unveiled in ::\'\ebraska City, Neb ''The most eloquent tifibute to the memory of Mr. Morton was that paid by Ex-President Cleveland, in whose cabinet Mr. J.Yiorton se;rved. Mr. Cleveland said in part: I have not com~ to the surviving farnily of J. Sterling Morton and to those who were his inti- mate friends and nei'gh bors for the puTpose of bringing from afar superfluous redtal of his vir- tues and mental endowments. You ·who, within the sacred precincts of his home knC)W of the warmth of his love, you \Vho daily found cheer and delight in the sunlight of his steady constant friendship, and you, his immediate fellow-citizens, who have been stirred to admiration and attach- ment to his unselfish and effective labor in be- half of those with whont his lot \vas cast, need no words of mine to arouse in your m.inds the sentim.ents which befit this commorative occa- sion. Even though all ·were silent, the beautiful monument here erected would itself eloquently signify the love and friendship and admiration which are today revived by the recollection of an affectionate, dutiful and useful life. But I am not here ·without a mission. I would fain interpr~t this monument's message to me, as it recalls my close companionshi-p and co-opera- tion in the discharge of the highest public duty, w'ith the man we honor. I am here to give evid- ence concerning the things he revealed to me in the light of that comJ)anionship and co-operation. This is but to testify to his lofty civic righteous- ness, his simple and sure standards of public morality, his stern insistence on official honesty, his sturdy adherence to opinions d~liberately and conscientiously adopted, his generous concession to others of every result of their efforts, and his passionate desire to serve the best interest of his fello\v country1nen. l am not required, for the sake of exaggerated tribute, to insist that in the mere possession of these virtues our friend was distinguished above all others. Eut it 1nust be said that he stood out from amidst a vast congregation of others ·who believed and kne\Y the right, because in defence of the right, as he believed and knew it, he was \Villing to fight and suffer not only in a small arena of private and social existence, but in the fiercer, deadlier amphitheat1'e of public life. He believed that the same care and good faith ex- acted by a trust undertaken by an individual were due to the people fr01n those who assumed of- ficial responsibilities and he beli.eved that waste in public expenditure was sin. These beliefs were not, in his mind, mere comfortable senti- ments, mildly stimulating to self-righteousness~ but were active incentives to battle. The noxious atmosphere of governmental extravagance could not blind his eyes, nor could the ridicule of those who had learned to scoff at official economy, or the threats of those who perfidiously contrive to appropriate pubLc funds, to private gain. drive him to compromise \Vith wrong. Bold and de- fiant in the midst of it all he took brave counsel of conscience. As did the dauntless Father of the Reformation who cried out to his tormentors: \I cannot and will not retract anything; for to act against con- science is unsafe and unholy.\ Thus it was that our friend's fine moral per- ception and his love of rectitud~ shed a, bright and un\vavering light on the path of official obli- gation, and thus did his clear discoursement of duty lend impressions to his efforts toward the highest usefulness in public office It was, how- ever, his keen intelligence and his worldly wis- dom that taught him that an effective equipment for the best public survice needed a large admix- ture of sterner stuff; and there was never a ser-

John Calvin Knox of Luzerne gave the add:ress, the subject of which was \What Christ H'as Done.\ Mr. Knox spoke of the two pictures of Israel given by the prophet Israel, the fallen Israel an.d Israel redeemed and as a text took the twenty-second verse of Isiah 44, \I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions, and, as a thtck cloud thy sins; return unto m.e; for I have redeem:ed thee.\ Mr. Knox said in part: \The purpose of God's love is to redeem m·en from their own passions and to make them free to walk in the world choosing for themselves. We have all done wrong and many times do and the law -which we break is the schoolmaster bringing us to Cl1rist.

Gilbert, author of Gilbert on Do1nestic Relations, and several other legal works, take up Real, Property, with the Seniors. The Trustees are to congratulated on having secured a man, so well known in the profession, as an author and scholar of high standing. An excellent course in this very im;portant branch of ~he law is assured. George Lawyer, a member of the firm of Buch- anan, Lawyer and Whalen and an alumnus of the school has taken the work with the Juniors on 9 school the assu:rance of a course of instruction that would be hard to improve. T;ennis The u,nfinished tennis matches in the fall tou~r- nament resulted as follows: Colburn beat Rowe, Schaupp defaulted to Meeker, Bayless de: faulted. to La Crosse; Colburn beat Snow, King beat Meeker, Vincent beat La Crosse; Fuller beat Colburn and Vincent beat King. Fuller and Vin- cent will meet in the finals. The doubles have also been drawn and it is hoped that these may be played off in a some- ·what shorter tin'le than the singles. The drawings of the first round follow: D·wight and Hoffman vs. Miller and Merrill; Fuller and Yates vs. Colburn and Brooks; Vincent and Brown vs. McCormick and Snow; Curtis and Potter vs. Cabot and King.

It i:s fllrther to be noted that there is a his- tori~ca~ value to some of :Mr. Chamberlin's lnater·- ial; for example, he is the first to publish a com- plete account of the Midway Islands, the strange~t land belonging to our country, and he is the fir . ..;t American author to print a true account of Liliu·· -ok.alani. As one of her counse'l for yE\ars the writer has gained a knowledge oif her that in thc:- nature of things can be shared by but few. an:l I>robab1ly by no other white man. This chaptc·r is profusely illus\trated with many different ph;- tures of Her Majesty and of her estates A chapter containing a long intervie\Y wl ·11 Aguinaldo, is of much interest to any wb.o des~rc> a true picture of that celebrated man.

The crowning event nf all is the account of Vesuvius while in eruption. and a number of pictures taken in the midst ~~f flying lava. The book promises to be very handsome. \[f one desires to read or present to another at Christmas, a book of travel, the publishers assert that \Around the vVorld in Xinety Days\ is far more attractive, instructive and interesting to the average reader than any other in the 1narket. Certainly that a man could see so much in a mere summer-time is most remarkable. Wesleyan 26, Union 5 ---- ------.- a:r;J:c~. Again and again did Moore get aorund hi::; end for long runs and in turn the Wesleyan men retaliated with equally good playing. The entire team played together and too much credit cannot be given to Unio1:1's good \VOrk. Harldicapped as we \\Vere in facing a team much heavier than ouTs, Moore \vho, \Vith Davis played brilliantlly, started the playing with a 5 yard run and [n less than 5 minutes the ball was pushed over Wesleyan's line for a touchdo\vn. So is th.ere little wonder that Union's rooteTS gave rent to their joy in a :manner, only appreciable> to those who were there. That squad of big Wes- leyan men, appeared dumfounded and were coln- pletely taken. off their feet. However here vYes- leyan displayed great power and only ,,·ent into the next play with a still firn1er determination to accomplish greater ,,~onders. Much can be said in favor of both teams for the clean playing and when Wesleyan mad2 her sensational plays the Union boys stood up and applauded with a will. This little touch of cour- tesy created a general good feeling and is some- th:ng that should never be forgotten especially on our own campus. The outburst of enthusias1n and good will \Vhich prevailed between the halves gave to us an E\xarqple which \Ve -vyould do well to en1.ulate in the futur2. The game last Saturday against Wesleyan was undoubtedly the most clever exhibition of good football that has been the good f·ortune for Urtion students to witness this season and although end-· 1 The game \vas called at 2:3 0. \Cnion won the toss and chose to defend the north goal. Here Wesleyan made a good kick-off, scoring for them two points. The ball was kicked oYer the goal line and do\vned for a safety. Moore then punt- ed off from the 2 5 yard line and soon obtained the ball on a fumble. Union 1vas then given a chance with the ball and improv2d the oppor- tunity as \vas seen when Moore went around his end for a sensational 55 yard run. This carried the ball close to the goal line and a few line plunges rushed it over for a touchdown. The goal was missed and score was 5-2. ing in a victory for the visitors, it has proved that the Union men are still in the game and that no superiority of weight tends to discourage them. Throughout the entire game play after play was made which fairly m,ade the spectators rise from their seats, so s'ensational was its appear- At the next kick-off, Wesleyan proved herself worthy of her reputation and with the aid of Van Surdan's 4 5 yard run, they succeed2d in making a touchdown.. They missed the goal and the score was 7-5. With the exception of one more i.

Union, however, lost it on downs and again Wesleyan tried for her yards. She did not gain the required distance so th2 ball agai11 went to Union. Here Moore punted to Wesleyan's 40 yard line and Van Sur dan advanced it 2 0 yards. Steady gains were then made by Wesleyan and she soon had the ball over our line for another touchdown. This time Wesleyan kicked the goal. Score 18-5. Wesleyan again kicked off to Union and the ball was advanced to the 4 0 yard mark and there lost on downs. Van Surdan again proved him- self equal to the occasion and by clean maneuver- ing rushed the ball down. the field, and was dow·ned on our 6 yard line. In t\vo more rushes the ball was over. Score 24-5 At the next kick-off W\esleyan obtained the ball through a fumble on our 5 yard line. But one more rush was needed to send the ball over when it was fumbled and the Union man was forced over the line for the second safety of the game.

-. THE 'CONCORDIEN.SIS T 7 0L . .,.'(_){/X. SHAKESPEARE CLUB I>rof. Bennett Speaks on Shy lock Last Monday evening Prof. Bennett delivered a m-ost interesting paper on \Shylock.\ By way of introduction he spoke of the character and treatment of Barabas in Marlowe's \Jew of Malta.\ He showed how different Shylock was from Barabas, who was a mechanical monster, utterly devoid of all the finer traits of chara.cter. Even though Shylock is cruel and vindictive, we caniTot help entertaining some sympathy for hiln at the time of his downfall, for the man is a real being subject to all of a man's passions and not at all the mere machine of malignity that so1ne people \vould have us believe. However, Prof. Bennett did not make it appear that Shy- lock is pi'e-eminently a character deserving of pity and syn1pathy. I-Iis aim w·as to show that Shylock is a character essentially human in every detail. In speaking of the story of \The Merchant of Venice'' Prof. Bennett read a very old ballad called \Gernutus\ \Yhich contains entire, the main story of Shakespeare's play. It was most inter- esting to observe that even Shakespeare used nothing new for the foundation of his play and yet by his master's touch he made an obscure and almost forgotten character one of the most inter- esting in dramatic history. After the reading a short business meeting was held at which a constitution was adopted. Next Monday evening at seven o'clock Prof. McKean will give a reading from \Julius Caesar.\ All members of the faculty, students and their friends are cordially invited to be present. COLUMBIA'S DEPARTURE Radical Change in Curriculum Some recent extensive changes in Columbia's curriculum are the cause of the following edi- torial comment in the Schenectady Gazette: i'lo. 7 Columbia has made a great departure from col- lege traditions in the rfew regulations that her authorities have made in the matter of the tim·e necessa1y for the student to devote to his course in order to receive his degree. It has been de- creed that work, not hours, .shall be the require- ment demanded for the desired reward. By this new scheme, it will be possible for the young man who is physically able to do the work and who is in college for work to graduate in two years. One hundred and twenty-four points are required for a diploma, and it matters not to the college whether the student takes two or four years to secure it. This is putting the matter on the right basis. and while it will break up classes and sound the death knell of many college traditions and cus- tom.s, it is in line with the development of the modern university, ·which has been creeping steadily and consistently away from the old classi- cal college idea of a srnattering of languages and the sciences, toward the ideal of a training school for practical \Yorkers. The p'assing of that intangible yet very real thing called \college spirit\ which will naturally result is to be deplored; taken all in all. is to be regretted. The training that caine from the old tilne college was not confin.ed to textbooks, but owed its strength to the fellowship that came from the shoulder to shoulder touch of the under- graduates as they were bound in the ties of class and college affiliations and fellowship. The spirit of American haste and enterprise has invaded the campus and the curriculum, and the step taken by Columbia will doubtless be followed soon by other institutions that have already sho·wed a tendency to adopt the same plan. College Meeting Meeting was called to order by Pre-sident Chap- man. Dr. Towne spoke on football, thanking the ' ti

11 I' \ j THE CONCORDIENSIS college for its support of the tea1n and expressing hopes for better success later. He also spoke on. paying up dues for the skating rink, whkh is very near completion and is a c.redit to those mana..g~ ing it. Reed announced the usual nreetings of the Musical Clubs for that evening. He praised \\vannly the good cheerin°g of Saturday and m:en-- tioned the benefits of well-combined work. Xutt spoke on Harnilton games of the future. VPdder spoke on the need of a stronger scrub to help the team out. The meeting then adjourned.

Fred Win- slow Adams of the State Street Methodist Episco- pal Church spoke on \The Challenge of the 'Cross.'' In part Mr. Adams saiGl: \We must form a picture of Jesus upon the cross, his hands and feet nailed to the great beams, the idle, jeer- ing multitude standing about, the groups of Scribes and Pharisees, and the crosses with the two malfactors, one on either side. \If thou art the son of God, come down from the cross,\ was the challenge of the multitude; the Scribes and Pharisees challenged, \Come down from the cross and we will believe,\ and the mal- ·factor, ''Thou art th~ Christ, save thyself and us.\ ~ould Jesus have answered these challenges? It ·\vas ir:n.possi:b le. In the garden he had had the 'St:r.ugg,le and the decision. was reached. It would then have been morally impossible and if mercily, ~) hysically i In.J_;Jossible. Who \Yere the men that Ina de the challenge? His ene·mies. And ever since that day people have uttered the same. It has been sa:~d that if '\Ye- take the blood and the cToss out o;f Christianity and let it stand alone hl pon its rnQral and ethical basis, that all India \VOUld beHeve. In these days there is inclined to be taught a .new humanitarianism that takes out of religious duty, but Christ taught, 'leave your w'ealth, leave your position. of tax collector for me.' It \\vas the way of suffering that taught discipline. There is a sting that men do not iike in being asked to ask for forg,iveness but the man who \Vould have <tife must humble himself. A fourth challenge can1e to Jesus from the other side of the cross. The thief said 'Rem.em- h€'r me wheB. thou comest into thy kingdom' and the answer 'vas, 'This day shalt thou be with Me in paradise.' There is yet another challenge, the challenge from the cross. He was there that sin might be 'viped from the '\Vorld. The challenge is to us.'' CHBJSTIA:N ASSOCIA\-1_1ION SUNDAY VESPERS: Dr. Stevenson of the P1•esbyterian Cl1urch \\ill speak on the subject, \Shall I ig'no:~•e the death of Jesus?\ rreESDAY !EVE!NING: The subject will be \A Christian Advantage.\-McClellan '07, leader. T'he Vesper services are not revival meetings, nor are they amateur productions. The com- mittee tries to secure the best speakers in town and these men have som.ething to say to us. This makes it worth our while \to get the habit\ of dropping in at the Hall at five o'clock Sunday afternoons. MUSICAL CLUBS. In spite o-:11 the fact that other college activities have interrupted rehearsals and taken men away fr-o1n them, the M!usical Clubs are getting into shape satisfactorily. The method of aHowing memhers a certain num1ber of bolts per term is

a \ t, is is THE CONCORDIBNSIS 9 being tried and it isn't possible yet to be certain of its success or failure. r_rne m.ost .encouraging feature or mttsical work at present is the snowing of the Instrumental Club. Probably never before in college history has the Instrumental C1u b numbered in its membership so many really ex- ceptional players. .Special mentioll might he made of the two Freshmen violinists. The 'l:Ylan- dolin part is strong, too, with seven men, three of which eould make any club in the country. One new pastime will be the formation of a str1n.g quartette, which Shelley '0 8, lVIu.ighan '0 8, Manghan '0 9 and Burley '0 9 will wo:rk up. This year the c1 ub boasts of a good flute, also, and with Kline '0 8 at cello and the leader at the piano, .ought to spread themselves in good shape. The best part of it is that they are working hard and rehearsals are excellent. The college quartette is practicing faithfully. F1:1Her, '08 a recruit from Cornell, who has already stepped into pro1ninence by winn i.ng the college tennis championship, has been picked to take the · place filled so admirably by Speir, last year's first tenor, and has shown excellent quality and extraordinary willingness to grind, me,mo.rize and practice. T'he first concert will take pla.ce in about three weeks, and it was voted at a joint m8Jeting of the clubs to take a five days' trip at Christmas time. Theatre Party at Mohawk Last Saturday evening about 10 0 of the fellows attended a theatre party at t}le Mloha wk where Della Fox had been filling a week's engagement. The management of the theatre had saved the front row for the college and Della as well as the rest of the house, was decorated with the Garnet, the boxes being draped with Union pen- nants. When D~lla Fox appeared wearing the Garnet she was greeted with a burst of enthusiasm in the way of a long yell. There was a good numbe.r of Hamilton men who exchanged yells with the Union m·.en, good spirit and fellowship prevailing. The gall~ry was well filled with \well wishers\ of the college who expected to see some \rough- honse'' tac:t.ics, but who were sadly disappointed. ~ot even th€ customary enthusiasm was shown. College Pharmacy Notes Earl Hoyt who has been ill with yellow jaundice for son1.e tilne is again able to be with us. and to · ~·esurne his studies. * * * * Examinations w\ill be given to students condi- tioned in any of their first year subjects, next \'i'eek. President Strong called a business meeting of the senior class last Wednesday night, after Dr. Heusted's lecture, at which the committee on class colors reported. Orange and a dark blue \V·ere the colors selected. A committee consist- ing of .Mr. Beavan, M.r. Barton, and Mr. Wears, was appointed to select from La tin or Greek, some suitable motto for the class of '06. Aii inv·esti- gating committee consisting of Messrs. Wray, Everleth and Mudge, was also appointed. To this committee must he referred, for approval, all bills against the class. Foreign Correspondence :Many of the Freshmen in one of the large uni- versities of the east, make it their business during the first term. to visit as many of their own class- men as they are able. Of course, owing to great numbers, it is next to impossible to see every man, but the idea is good and worthy to be taken up at Lafayette. Small as the class of ''09 is. the fellows are not acquainted wtth each other as they should be. Fo.r instance, the classicals may know the men of their own course, but when it comes to the \Techs they don't know even the names of some of them~ Let each Freshman take a little time and go to the room of each of his class- mates and give him a good hand-shake, and we are sure that the unity and usefulness of the class will be strengthened.-The Lafayette. * * * * The truste·es of the College of the City of ~ ew York are endeavoring to acquire the grounds south of the College at One Hundred and ThiV\ty- eigh t Street and Amsterdam Ave., for use· Rs an athletic field. .;;,,;/.~' ; !' ,i

Rather than being an exception to the rule, the Noven1ber nutnber is doubly interesting. At this tin1e of the year, the n1.inds of the large 1najority of college n1en are directed to football, as played in their own college or in others. For that reason, several articles by Casper \i\Thitn ey and one by Dennie P. l\1 yers catne \in the nick of ti1ne.\ l\1r. \iVhitney's articles are particularly pertinent in that they deal with the \an1- ateur question\ and the rules, subjects vvl1ich are the storn1 centers of the football criticisn1 of the fan.

On Saturday last, Union. met Hamnton in the annual ga:tne of football on the ca,mpus. The day \Vas clear and cold, very snappy weather for foot- ball, but the ground had not thoroughly dried out fro1n the rains of th€ night previous. men are in pretty good shape for a hard game with Rochester today. Rochester's strength is rather of an unknown quantity, their play having been rather erratic throughout the season. They were badly beaten by Ham-ilton and by Colgate, although scoring twice on the latter's strong team. Later they trounced St. La\vrence prop- -erly, .which team has been playing a strong game. The showing against Hobart was fair, three touchdowns being scored.

Union's cheering section vvas full to overflo\ving and Doc Moore and Ey Reed kept every one busy ,v,ith his voice. The Hamilton students had their own section in the west bleachers, which. was· reserved for them and they rooted for their team \Vith true college scores this year. The practice throughout the week \vas stiff. The team went back to the rudiments on Mon- day's sloppy field. Particular attention has been paid to the weaker points of play in Saturday's game.

Eleven 1nen had been to Ha·Inilton's fifteen yard line. We again ob- tained possessi'On of the ball by a fumb~e, and ·were thrown back for a loss on an attempt to cir- picked for the game ·who \'\Yere thought ablt to ·cle the end; we were then penalized for holding uphold Uni·on's honor. They ·were, while they lasted. But all \Vere not in the best physical shape, and some couldn't stand the strain. As il- lustrated by Saturday's game our cry:ng need is for substitutes. The regular tea1n outplayed Hamn ton in the first half. In the second, with several substitutes playing in strange positions, the gam.e \vas Ha1nBton's. The Garnet team came on the field about 2:30, follo'ived by the \Vhole squad. Among the famil- iar faces was that of ''Bill'' Smith, who was up from New York to see the gam·e, and who was given a rousing reception. The team lined up as before except that Shutler \vas at quarter. He played weU, when it is con- sidered that it was his first experience in that positi-on. Though penalties w·ere frequent for offside., the gam:e was cleanly played. As has been Captain Dann's good fortune most of the season he won the toss choosing to defend the south goal. ·Hamilton kicked to Union's ten yard line, where M'oore obtained possession of the ball and forced it back for a good gain. Shutler then signalled for Moore to try the left end, which worked admirably, bringing Union's team fifteen yards nearer Hamilton's goal. We were then penalized for off side and shortly lost the ball on a fumble. Ham1lton's first tries to advance the baH through our line were not altogether successful. We took the ball and punted, after a few plays, ·EXTRA ' ,· . . in the 1ine. Moore again punt·ed, sending the leather to Hamilton's five yard line, from which point a 'long end run was made by .Sicard. Throughout the first half the ball kept changing hands, being, however, for the greater part of the time in Hamilton's territory. HamHton had more long runs to her credit, but Union out- punted Hamilton by several yards. The whole first half kept every one guessing, and Union's reputation of taking a good brace in the second half gave the Hamilton men some uneasy moments. After the ball had travelled considerable distance, back and forth over the field, not threatening either goal seriously, it stopped on Hamilton's thirty yard line at the call of time. At the beginning of the second half, the gen- eral feeli;ng was that Union would hold Hamilton down at least, and many were anxious to see our team take the \second-half brace.\ In this half, the same Union team kicked to Ham.ilton defend- ing the south goal. An additional snappiness and :determ'ination characterized Hamilton's playing throughout the who,Je of the second half. Not for an instant did they hesitata to take any ad- vantage offered them, nor could our team seem to successfully stop their backs when they hit our line or tried the ends. On the kick-off Hamilton started the ball to- wards union's goal. Through the line she seemed to open up good sized pathways.

SOIREE AT ALBANY COitllnLttt>(\ Br(.,aks l>t·ec-<'dent The Soiree committee is making histo.ry and taking a bold stand, for \Vhich it doubtl,:ss will be seYerely criticised by some. At its last meeting, it decided t·o hold the Sopho1nore Soiree in Al- bany. at the H.otel Ten Eyck, ear1Iy in February. At first glance, this ::;trikes one as being a most peculiar arTangement. It has alwayR been the custom here to hold the Soiree in town. All other colleges do this. Why not continue? T'he experiences o~ last year answer well e11ough to this question. As formerly, it 1va.s thought that the dance would be held in the Round Euilding. This, ho1vever, was vetoed by the 'li'brary con1mit- tee and a ne\Y place had to be found. Th<?re was found to be only one eligible place, the newly completed Red Man's Hall. While out of th€' ·way, this 1vas sufficient for the dances of last year, which were attended with remarkably small cro-wds. T'he record breaking attendance of the '06 Soiree would have s-wamped the Hall. This was the situation faced by the present com.mittee. Schenectady, a city of 60,000 inhabi- tants. not containing a single hall of sufficient capacity for a large dance; Union Go liege itself not even possessing a hall that might be used for so universal a function as a college dance. There was but one alternate for the committee, that of going else\vhere for accommodations. The sub- sequent search showed the T'en Eyck to be the most suitable place. The hotel has a large ball- room and Albany is extrem~ely easy of access from Schenectady. 'The ~:xpenses entailed by this :Plan will be much greater. For this reason the tickets are $4.00 in- stead of $3.50. But with that increase, the indi- vidual expenses need not total as much as former- ly for the fellows will be forced to use the trolley instead .of cabs. There will probably be special cars for those attending. i'{o. 8 The whole a affair but i:\l111Jhasizes the mor,• the need of the college for a new and larger gym- nasiu n. f0r it is in such a place that a college us- ually .h0ld.s its dances. V\l~th the growing proH- perHy of the college, it hardly sel n1~ too much to hope ,fol' the speedy remedy of that want.

Russell Stevenson, D. D.,· of the First Presbyterian Church. The subject of the address \vas, \Shall I Ignm·e the Death of Jesus?\ Dr. Stevens0n most clearly presented the idea of the motives which we bring to bear upon our lives by hvo Hlustrations, first by telling of the solution of the problem of supplying the City of Hchenectady wHh water by making evaporation, rainfall, gravitation and electricity, nature's great forces. do the work, and then of the hopeless task of the EgyptiaTJ. laborer on the Xile, perpetualy raising his bueket of \\Yater from the river to the level of the ever-thirsting plains. · \What motive po\\ver are we bringing to bear upon ourselves to take sin from our lives?\ said Dr. Stevenson. \vVe are making a great 1nistake \\\'hen Wt> try to use hurnan force to do it. In this \Vorld we find ourselves with a lot of appetites. \iVe want the things that mon~y can buy. Can we check ourselves from stealing? We want suc- cess. Can 'i'i'e refrain from telling the lie that wiH bring it? \Ve gratify our appetite once and it is twice as hard to check, twice and it is four times as hard and so they go on rolling up their force according to the square. If they are not checked near the beginning we are lost. Where are we going to get the motive to stop?\ \We som.etilnes bring in the bodily 1notive, tE'll- ing ourselves that \\'e cannot indulge in certain sins and be an athlete or that indulgence in them will bring to UB the loss of our faculties. But we have a great'C'l~; we have the devine motive, the crucifiction. T'he question con1.es. 'Shall I ignore the death of Jesus?' If I do I lose the greatest force for the che('kfng of sin. A 1nan who says 'I shall employ the bodily motives.' throws away the greatest motiYe of all. Kappa Alpha Entertains The first large fraternity dance of the ye>ar occurred on the hill last Friday night when the Kappa Alpha Society gave its annual fall dance and reception. The lodge was very prettily decorated with evergreens and scarlet, and the large veranda was inclosed by garnet doth, Tnak- ing a fine promen:ade during dances.

Sotne one here in college recently queried . \Is Union's can1pns a pn blic s:hort-·cut, or a private grounds?'' If the sa1ne question were put to the peopl-e of Schet1-ectady, vve doubt not that a big 1najority of then1 vvoulcl answer that they deen1ed it a public short- cut. And they evidetnly do. ~ow, it is far fro1n our intention to as- sun1e the \'dog in the nranger\ position. ()ur grounds, which challenge cotnparison vvith the best, have always been ope11 to the pub- . lie. VVe wish that they ever 1nay be. In late years, since Scllenectacly, in its phenon1- · enal growth, has surrounded us, it has been a great convenience to the people to be al- lowed to cut across the grounds and particu- larly the ca1npus, unn1olested. \V e do not protest against this, but we do \vish fair treatn1ent and, failing that to warn all to be careful of their property, on this account. When so n1any cross, it is in1possible that all should be scrupulously honest. It is a proven fact th?t all are not so. Various things have been lost fron1 the can1pus but the rnost open piece of work occurred last l\Tonday. At noon, when the football 1nen were returning fron1 the train- ing table, they n1et a young n1.an con1ing out of the .college grounds., bearing in triun1ph one of the track hurdles, which had been left on the ovaL where we rnight expect then1 to be safe. \!Vhen one of the fellovvs unkindly asked hirn to hand back the hurdle, he first becan1e insulted and then belligerent . The idea that any of ''then1 college guys\ should try to keep hin1 fron1 taking what he wanted fron1 the college grounds! He coulcln 't understand it. Finally, after n1uch persuasion, he was convinced that he would confer a great favor upon all concerned if he would let the college use the hurdle until after the spring n1eets were run off. The self-sacrificing heroisn1 of the young- 1nan was truly adrnirable. Again, if you would have your property, watch it.

V\r e .beg of you, one and all com·e out and show the tean1 that even now, there is no la~k of appreciation for the fel- lows who have sacrificed their personal con- venience for devotion to Ahna 2.\!Iater.

As for [ast Saturday's gatne perhaps the less said, the better. At first we all felt pretty n1uch like knocking. In fact, we do feel that way yet. If the reports of the game are true, all was not as it should be. But what is to be gained by con1plaining? 1'he gan1e has gone down in historv as a good sound defeat, as it was. All there is for us is to take our 1neclicine like 1nen and try again. \\Ve will surely have another chance. V\r e have clone the trick before~ we can do it again. Don't let the world say that Dnion n1en are quitters! Last year there was son1e talk of having a basketball tean1 playing under the na1ne of the college.

ROCHESTER 16-UNION o Rocheste1.· Wii1s Loose Game In a game characterized by unusually heavy unfairly distributed, Rochester easily defeated Union at Rochester last Saturday. Union at times made remarkable gains but in all cases was dis- covered infringing the rules and was, accordingly, .severely punished. If Rochester's fault, it was m·ost unsports1nanlike; if Union's fault care should be taken to avoid a repetition of actions which proved so di.sasterous to our chances of scoring. ·The total of our penalties was 13 0 yards, more than equal to a touchdown. R;ochester' s strong point was her great line bucking, each of the three touchdovvns coming as a direct result of this. In like manner she scored twtc.:: on Colgate. For Union Moore punted well, two of his kicks going over 6 5 yards. Mc~ab played ·well, making several runs. Captain Dann w·on the toss and chose to de- fend the west goal. M.oore returned the kick-off 15 yards. He mad.:: 4 yards on a mass on tackle and Mulrooney made first down. Davis failed to gain and Moore made 3 yards throug·h right tackle. Moore punted. On the catch, Rochester returned 15 yards. Penalized 15 yards for holding but made up the loss on a fake punt. Union held for downs and punted on first down. By line- bucking, Roches- ter brought the ball to our 20-yard line. They failed to gain and formed for a fake place-kick. :Here the quarter-back received the ball and plunged through the line. The play vvas pro- tested but it vvas allowed. Union then held for downs. Mc?\ab made a pretty quarter-back run of 3 0 yards, but th.:: ball was brought back and Union penalized 15 yards for holding. Moore punted. From that point, by line plunges, Rochester brought the ball back to the 15-yard line. The remaining distance to the touchdown was made on a tandem play through our right side. No goal. Score, Roch- ester 5, Union 0. On the kick-off Davis carried the ball back 20 yards. McNab got 15 yards. Again Union vvas penalized 15 yards for holding. Moore punted. Rochester could not gain and was forced to punt. McNab was downed in his tracks. The ball was down when the Rochester quarterback got in un er c a and, in som.e manner, probably not penalties, which seem to us to have been rather d M N b

' ,. 12 THE CONCQ:RDIENSIS moral suasion, obtained possession of it. Mr. ·vvard permitted Rochestei· t0 retain possessta:n in center of field. From this point, by a se~des of powerful line bucks, R0chc:ster scored. ~o goal. Score, Rochester 10, Ulllion 0. Shortly after, tin1:e was caned for the first half. The second half opened, the officials changing places and M.lf'. VV\ard becomi 1l1g umpi·re. At this point he brought out a new method of umpirin.g. Usually, the umpire stands on a line with the two lines of for\\vards. M\r. Ward: took up his position., hovvever, behind the half ba:cks. Moore kicked off for UHi011. Rochester was forced to punt, Union getUng the ball near the center of the field. By short end runs and line bucks the ball was carried to Rochester's 3 0-yard line where it was fumbled and recovered by Rochester. After carrying the ball to Union's 40-yard line, Rochestel' ·was 11el'd for downs. Un- ion's ball. Hildreth ran 15 yan:ls but was brought back as Union was holding. Penalized 15 yards. Moore punted. Rochester \,:yorked the baH, by the same steady line pound·ing, up for another touchdown. 'The goal was ktcked. Score, Roch- ester 16, Union 0. Rochester kicked off to Union. Runs by Mc- ~ab and good gains by oth€r backs carried the ball to Rochester's 15-yard l:ine. Moore went 4 yards but the inevitable holding was discovered, resulting in another 15-yard penalty by Mr. VVard. On next dovYn Wright gained 10 yards on the delayed pass, but again tllere was holding and again Union lost 15 yards. Tllis forced Moore to punt. The Rochester quarterback returned the ball 15 yards. Union held a.nd Rochester punted. Hlldreth caught the ball and returned it 6 5 yards,. getting through the vrhole Rochesteil.· team, but being tackled f.rom behind 011: the 10-yard line. But Mr. Ward ruled that he ra:.n out of bounds and brought hhn back to the 50-yard line. At this point Armstrong \\'3iS substituted for Hildreth. On the next play Union vvas again penalized 15 yards. Shortly after Merrill was discovered slugging and ·was taken out, Nutt be- ing substituted. The rest of the half alternated wtth short gains by Union a11d penalties by Mr. Ward.

Let Us Smile A local daily di$gorged the fo1lowing bit of editorial h u1nor over Saturday's game: Union, more radical than the supporters of the free silver doctrines of 16 to 1, has returned from Rochester ~nowing that 16 to 0 is not merely a theory, but a fact.

THE CoN CO RDIENS IS VOL. ~'f\ .<'\:.,./X. UNIOJ\T COLLEGE, NOJ7. 25, I905. No. 9 PORTO RICO X ewton L. Reed, '7 9 is now in Porto Rko and in his letters to his son, B. W. Reed, '06. \\Yr:tEs enthusiastically of our beautiful new possession. We print one of his letters below. For the bene- fit of those of our readers who may have read the same article in a recent issue of the Gazette. we will state that the letter \vas intended for th0 COl .. lCordy but in some mysterious fashiGn lost its \vay. Mr. Reed writes as follo\vs: San Juan, Porto Rico, Xov. 13, 1905. My Dear Boy: :2'\ot a fe\v of the students and some of th.e older fellows may be a bit hazy as to loca1tty of this youngest son_ of the flag, Porto Rico. The \Rich Port.\ is the point of that island curve which once joined Florida and separated the Atlantic from the Carribean. It's a block about 90 miles by 40, .. with hills and mountains enough to cover t\vice that area. Straight aw.ay fron1 Sandy Hook it's 1,380 miles to San Juan harbor. Its marvelous climate may be told in a sen- tence: Perfect tem_perature in the tropics. Xine- ty is practically the upper limit and a daily sea. breeze subtracts 10 from that; 70 is unusual, and 60 would rnake us shiver. A day in which the sun did not shine part of the time \VOuld provoke m10re comment than 20 below zero in Westen1. Xev:.' York. The seasons are yesterday, today and tomorrow. There's more rain from September to January and less from January to September than the rest of the year, and not so very n1uch either. Some trees shed their foliage in the fall or --winter, I think. It may be in the spring; I'm not cer- tain. '·? Back from the shore line to the distance of three to five miles the land is rolling and accords more with our northern ideas elf agricultural fit- ness, though the hills and mountains farther in are green to the top and cultivated all the way up, though see 1njngly better suited to graz.ing. But it ·ts the comn1ercial aspect of Porto Rico that w~ .. r1 most interest students and alumni. Few of us are NEre for purely hygienic reasons. The returns f:rom invest:rn,ent are larger and surer here than in 1tbc States. We are or1 home territory, within fn'e days of ~ew York-it will be three in a short ti:nae-we are Oil tropic soil with freights a quarte•r or at most a third of our other selni- tropic regtons, and we can raise the fruits for wh:ch there is higher markEt north. The grea.t staples of the island, coffee, tobacco, and sugar, interest the ne\\r American less than the fruits; the sugar at presrnt priees is making the plant-e:l~ happy. 'rhere was a fair profit when the refi11l€d product sold for 4% to 5 cents per pound. :X ow it sells for 71h cents and planters n1ade as liligh as $10,000 on a crop last y-ear, and some, I am told, very much higher·. But take the fruits, G·ranges are at ho1ne here, and no better . The bu~l<l:ed stocl{_ requires care and pati-ence for four or ftve years with srnall returns. But then an acre should net $100 and double until the net is ten ti1nes that and more annually. And this based o:t1.· a careful study of results in California and Fl0rida, one too far from our seaboard cities and the ()ther not free from frost. which is never known llere. And while the young orange grove 1nay n~ t be negl-ected \\Vithou t speedy deteriora- tion, in-telligent energy is all that is needed. I have tr€es out 15 months that I can walk under, that are eight and nine inches around the boll and seven feet across the top. Many of these have two to a dozen oranges on now. In less than four years e-ven they'll be paying their way. TurFl next to pineapples: The largest pine grown is native to Porto Rico. The fruit som,e- times grows to 20 and 25 pounds. Ten thousand are plan ted to the acre and produce the first crop at the e11d of 15 to 18 months when 80 per cent. may he expected. After this the yield is annual 'i ,, I!

I 'I'HE CONCORDlliENSTS for five to seven years without replanting. The returns at present prices shoU:ld be $500 an ac.te and better. Why, then, have not all available :lands been taken for these purposes? Because of ta:riff be- for·e our occupation and slo\\v appreciation since. Now Americans are \Yaking up. A million. pine- apples will be planted '''itihin 10 miles of me this season. I shall have 50,0 00 ou.t \\'\rhen this is read. And these are but two. I could name a half dozen other industries, relatively new, with al- most as good promise of large returns. The soil is here, the cli:nTate and the labor. Few such openings for investment eith.e·r of self or -capital, fe\v places where a few hundred or a few thous- and dollars can be placed to as good advantage as in this northeast belt of Porto Rico-prGvided ahrays that the investor puts hiinself in charge of his development or puts his capital in charge of some reliable man or company. And northern men are appreciating this. v\Tithin three years land in this neighborhood has ad- vanced from $10 to $50 and $60 an acre. Land adjoining this place, set to trees and carried a year, sold recently for $200 an acre. XE\VTOX L. REED. Class of 1878. Members of the Pioneer Board of EC!itors of the ConcordienRi~.

Vesper Service ~~unday's Vesper service -vvas addressed by Prof. John T. F'reeman, Superintendent of the Schenec- tady Public Scnools on the subje-ct of \The Power of Prayer.\ Taking as his text Jam.es V: 16, \The effectual :fervent prayer of the righteous man availeth much.\ Prof. Freeman said: \The power of prayer can be considered in two ways. The first is the wish that it will acc01nplish. In Matthe'\v it is said, \Ask and it shall be given, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened,\ there being no limitation for anyone. We notice in this the kind of application needed. The de- sire must be in our hearts and that 1nust find ex- pression. It is useless, we sec in the Lord's Prayer, to ask for forgiveness unless we are will- ing to forgive. In all our petitions it is useless to ask unless we are in hannony with the1n. \We 1nust know the dynan1ics of prayer. (But then when thou prayest enter into thy chamber.) There is necessity of withdrawing f1·mn the world. \\V:e are known by o:the1·s; we know ourselYes hest, yet we do not know our own deapths and have n·ot tested ourselves to our capacity. This is why we must withdraw to ourselves, be alone, and dosing the doors turn to the Father 'who shall reward you openly.' ''This concerns only the asking. The power m.ust also be considered in the belief. \If \re be- lieYe we shall receive.\ •God will hear but there 1nust be faith. Knowing· that the Father wiH give what is best, approach him with faith. 'i\\hat is the power. \Our petitions should be for others as well as fm· ourselv·es. Only a small portion of the 'Typical Prayer is for ourselves. It takes in the \.Vho le world.\ College Briefs The flag pole in up and the stars and stripes are floating to the breeze within the campus gates.

Freshman Banquet The Freshman Banquet was held last Monday night in the Hotel Worden, Saratoga Springs. Unusual precautions had been taken to dude the sophomores but nevertheless at the appointed hour a large delegation of them was on hand. However, the freshmen, fearful of relying upon their 0\\\11 physical prowess, had called in a num- ber of policem-en who \Yere under orders to arrest any disturber of the peace among the ranks of 1908. Of course under such reinarkable circum- stances the freshmen had little difficulty in keep- ing the banquet hall in a peaceable and agreeable order. We regret the fact n1ost keenly that the fresh1nen could not su1nn1arily subdue the auven- turous sophon1m·es. !The best representation was that of the Ropho- rnore class. which showed good spirit by going almost to a man, though its celebration was des- tined to be held elsewhere than in the banquet hall. The upperclasses were well represented, through the kindness of 19 0 9. but the freshman delegation ·was not what it should have been. I-Io\\·ever, the \f1·osh\ proved excellent hosts when in the hall. The dinner was good and the toasts were I istened to with a fair degree of attention. Those present besides C. B.

Some so:phomores managed to get to the roof, though the ''frosh\ had securely fastened the 'hatches, and captured the coveted banner. The sophomores smarting over the results of the night before, w·ere anxious for trouble and felt that this was the. best time in the world for it. Not so \With the fresh1nen, however. Perhaps the ban- quet \\vas too 1nuch for them. At any rate the few who \'ivere on the spot when the flag came do\vn put up a very la1ne arguntent, not even finding the flag.

Discussed by Residents It has been announced that the question be- lo\V \Vere discussed at great length at the recent meeting of the association of colleges in Xew England, held at \Nilliams. 1. Fraternity houses: are they increasing in number? Do they become more and more luxur- ious and expensive? Are they on the whole ad- vantageous to the college? 2. The educational value of the small division. 3. Does the experience of most X ew England colleges with their requirement for A. B. of from 120 to 23 0 \term hours,\ and the constant distri- bution of the student's time over a variety of sub- jects, suggest the advisability of concentrating the work fo.r the degree upon a smaller number of subjects? 4. What is the result of the erection of frater- nity chapter houses and how should such houses be controlled? 5. Is there such a decline in the study of Greek h1 the secondary schools as to call for pro- nir1g, the following officers were elected: Presi- dent, Mr. Schu1nacker; Vice Pres·ident, L. C.

Princeton has chosen the aifirn1ative. Followers of football will a\vait with in- terest to have the logical argtu11ents that -vvill be offered for and against this unusual question. Our hopes and best wishes to to-clay with the teant to X e\v York. For the past two years we have won easily there and we tnust repeat it today. \Tictory there n1eans as n1uch, if not n1ore. to us as anywhere else. for there the tean1 is al·ways subjected to the critical eyes of a large nurnber of alutnni. who are n1ost anxious to see their Ahna ::\later successful. \Ve want 1nuch fron1 our alutnni. Let us hope that we can give then1 what little we have to offer. \A/ e can win if the tean1 plays football as it is able. \Ve regret exceedingly that pugilisn1 has been allowed to enter into the college scraps. l\[ore than this 1t is deplorable that a just decision of the Seniors should be sud- denly clone away with by the violent action of one of the undergraduates. At the flag scrap the other n1orning there were several exhibitions of slugging-an eletnent that hitherto has been n1ost scrupulously guard- eel against. V\y e cannot ancl we will not , have such practices continued on the can1- pns. The Seniors 1nust assert their right of censorship over college actiyities ai1cl pre- vent such exhibitions of childishness. \The Harvard Bulletin,\ the organ of the grad- uate body of Haryard, puts itself on record as being an enemy of football. lt says that the famous game is in decadence. =

T'HE CONCORDIE~SIS II UNtON 12, HOBART 5 Union \\Vins Fo(i)rly Phl~·ed Gan1e. In a game disappointing in every respect, Union defeated Ho hart on the campus Satut~day by a score of 12 to 5. After the scoring of the first touchdown, the stai\ldard of play was as low as has been seen this fall. With, a slight advantage of weight, at least equa:l speed and the usual type of play, Union shou'ld have swept the field. But the sweeping wasn't visible. On the .other hand, Hobart had courage, science, and an everlasting \stick-to-itivness\ which bore them through the game. They didn't know they were beaten and wouldn't be told so, wi.th the result that they played a pretty, up-hill game. A little more of :Hobart's admirable spirit would have helped our , score .im,mensely. The day was cold and raw and, as a result, the crowd was smaller than usual. though the weather V\ras ideal for the players. The showing on the rooters' bleacher in the second half vras poor, ~any fellows going in doors. Consequently tne yelling', as tersely expressed Monday m·orning by \Doc\ Moon, was \rotten.\ As usual, Capt. Dann won the toss. choosing to defend the south goal. At 2:4 5, Rippey kicked off for Hobart and the struggle \'\vas on. Moore ran back the kick, and McNab turned loose his ground gainers, this time with good success. By a series of steady gains on mass plays the ball was carried to H:obart's goal and Hildreth was shoved over the first touchdo,vn in four rninutes of play. Moore kicked goal. Score, Hobart 0, Union 6t Owing to off-side play the Union team was pen- alized and Moore was obliged to kick off frorn an added distance of 5 yards. The kick-off was re- ceived on Hobart's 15-yard line and brought back 10 yards. Hobart was penalized 5 yards ?~nd lost the ball on downs. Union \\Yas penalized 15 yards and after recovering part of this Mc=\Jab tried a drop kick. The play was spectacular in that the ball landed squarely on thA top of the goal post but after apparent hesitation, it bounced back into the field and was secured by Hobart close to the line. At this point the Hobart team did its best at ground gaining of the day. Wegner and - - -\-=======-:==- Han\ey in quick succession, made runs that amounted to 25 yards each. :Here the Garn\~t li11e held for two downs an.c1 1-foLart ·was forced to pur1t. The ball was furnhle1 iJut Union suc- ceeded in securing it. Hildreth was tHken out ·,)f the gan\le \Yith an injured knb_=> af~er gaining 15 yards, \\\hich however; did not count c\\;ying to a penalty. Armstrong took his pl::l:et~ s.t left haif. After gaining 8 yards Moore punted to the center of the field. Hobart tried to return the punt but the bail -went outside and UnioH, scoring it near the center of the field, started for the second touchdo\Yn. Moore and Arn'lstrong succeeded in making 1 0-yard gains and then Moore made a run which netted 30 yards. Mulrooney made first down through center. Here Union \'\Yas penalized 10 yards and shortly after Hobart 5 yards. Again Mulrooney was sent through center for a good gain but this time he came out with a dislocated elbow. Shutler took his p1ace at full and Dann was sent through for a touchdown. l\'Ioore again kicked the goal. Score. Hobart 0, \Cnion 12. Moore kicked off to Hobart's 5-yard line. Hobart punted to the center of the field and g-ot the ball on a fum'ble. Union held for downs and Moore m . .ade a good g-ain. The first half ended with the ball in Union's possession near the cen- ter. Score, Hobart 0, ·union 12. Sec6n<l Half. In the second half M.oore kicked to Hobart's 15-yard line and Hobart ran back 10 yards. Ho- bart was pei1alized 10 yard::;. Union receiYed the ball on do-wns on Hobartjs 45-yard line. Tiippey was replaced by Johnson at this tilne. Hobart got the ball on do\Yns on their O\\\n 3 5-yarcl. line and carried it to the center of the field ,,·here they also lost it on do\\~ns. Armstrong gained 8 yards and Moore punted. Hobart got the ball but iln- m.ediately lost it on downs. McXab tried anoth~r drop kick which did not score. Hobart got the ball and punted to their own 45-yard line. Rh ut- ler gained 20 yards and JY.I1oore tried a place kick which was blocked. At this time Xutt took 1\/fer- rill's position, Robinson took :Moore's and Knight succeeded Lent. DV\'\'inelle punted, the ball going over Shutler's head and rolling to \Cnion's 15-yard line. Fro1n. here Shutler atte1npted to punt but,

12 THE ·CONCORDIENSIS through haste and a pont· pass,. the try was a failure. The kick went about 15 yards and was veered far to one side by the wind. A Hobart man secured the ball and had an open field orE 2 5 yards to the goal. As he crossed the line, Shutler tacked him, but was hurt and had to be replaced by Mead. Hobart failed mi:serably at the goat Score, Hobart 5, Union 12. Hobart kicked off to VVjright, who ran the ball pack 3 0 yards.
