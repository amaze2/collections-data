THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, JUNE 12, 1908 1\,.T L\ Q, 28 COMMENCE:M,ENT DAY. The 112th commeftcement exercises nf Union CL)llege were held in the First Refonned Church vVednesday morning, when another large ,class ·was added to the large number that have left Old l!Hion in the past. The auditori·um of t:he c·hurch was pacl{ed to tile dc1ors, while the chapel roon1 and the galleries were filled and 1nany sat on the stair8 or stood In the rear. The exercises were ope11ed by singing the 117tll P;:;alm, after which for1ner President Dr. A. V. v .... Raymond led in prayer. President Alexander then introduced the first o~ the Senior orators, Arthur Edgar Davies, of Schenectady, who spoke on \Conscience in Poli- tics.·· He brought forward the .que.stion, \Does conscience hold its rightful place in politics,\ and said that the United States was facing through political dishonesty one of the most serious .prob- lems in her history. He declared that .we 1nust puri-fy our body politics and n1ake conscience a do1ninant issue for the sake of our democratic institutions. Thomas E. Hanigan, of Schenectady, then spoke \ on \The Nature and Mission of the State,\ declar- i11g that the ultimate end of the State is to pPr- f8ct the brotherhood of man and to bring about the highest degree of civilization in the world. of whict it is capable. He said that problems which the .State 1nust solve are its relations to criminals, the poor, the church, and to other States. Arthur B. King, of Troy, was the next speal\Gr, taking for his the-me \John Locke and the French Revolution.\ He regarded the French Revolution a~ one of the greatest ep-och marking events in history. T'he attempt to -deprive the people of their rat.ional rights, the ·speaker declared, was the ren <2ause of the revolution. He spoke of John Ln:_ Ke as the real leader of the revolution and sh,J\t\ Jd how his ideas were the ideas of the masses oi t'he French nation. Edwin L. La Crosse;. of Sche111ectady, was ex- cu8ed from the delivery of his oration, \Central- ization in the United States.\ The next s:pe.aker was Hern1an L. lVI8yer, of Green Island, on the subject \The AcbwJ Self.'' He stated that there were two views of self; the view of tne Gennan philosophers and the view of Christ, a11d_ that there are two kinds of seH: The selfi;:;h self and the actual self, which is ac- quired only by self abnegation and self suppres- sion for the purpose of self realization. Mark 8. Watson of Plattsburgh took up the sub- ject \The Prob~en'l of the ::.vt:ob.\ He declared that anarchy is essentially of foreign origin, but i.::; easily trans pian ted and has taken deep root here, growing rapidJy in extent and in intensity. He said that the leaders in commerce and finance are not a wake to the danger, but are in igi:wrance of the evil. He then declared that every dishonest politician, every bit of watered stock and every evil in corp()rations aid anarchy n1ore than a whole 1nob of shouting anarchi;:;ts. Martin H. Weyrauch, of Liberty, then spoke on \Our Country and the World Proble1n,\ declaring that the reaction against social conditions which i.3 sweeping ove,r the world is the greatest that has ever existed and is engulfing our country. He agreed with Senator La Follette that the trouble is that instead of being rep res en ted we are luis- represented. Leland Silas Hoffn1an the~1 delivered the vale- dictory, being excused fron1 his oration, \Lord Kelvin; His L!ife and Work.\ During a 'Selection by the orchestra Governor Hughes, the honorary cllancellor, entered and was greeted with a burst of applause. He was then introduced .by Pre8ident Alexander, Governor Hughes said ill part: \I come brin:ging words of g·ood cheer and ell- couragement. Despite the evils we deplore and with due regard to regrettable exhibitions of meanness aJ1.d .gree,d we may still say that the natural resources of our country and our den1CJ- cratic institutions have been pre.:;erved.

I I : I l , I I I I I ! I THE CONCORDIENSlS \We are not likely to suffer from lack of atten- tion to education. It is true that our population is being enlarged by the ignorant, but also true that all .or allnost all who brea t'he American air seen1 to have a desire to know and to becon1:e effec- tive f.or some purpo13e. The average American young n1a~1 is determined to make an instru1nent of himself for doing ';Something well. But how snon is it learned that he who is riC'h only in. in~ formation. is poor indeed. We may be effective along particular lines, but we must be .m·e·n en- riched by ·cultivation of the best thoug'ht of all time and we must form a trHe perspective, living as in the twentieth century aRd not in the thir- tf'enth or fourteenth.\ Keefe, 98; D.

The university does ·not turn out men to take thei.r place~ as so many isolated units. We 1nust have nle.:.l who can be trusted, but we must also have Porter Meinorial Sc'holarship·;:;-A. E.

You have had a great oppor- tunity, but not the only one. The great school of lffe is an opportunity. T'he man who goes forth exceptiDnally well })rovided must render excep- tional service, and he cannot do it unless he look~ upon his fellow 1nen as 1nen to whon1 he owes a special duty. \This message is for all. A man, particularly an educated man, can never go forth .carrying the sign 'For Sale.' Too many men filled with a1nbition, have gone forth, but for what? To conquer? Would that it were always to conquer instead of to sell.\ \In all these matter/3 it must be understood that if educated men really love our demDcratic institutions they can dominate public opinion.\ The diplomas were then awarded by Dr. Ray- n1ond and the following degrees ·conferred: Mas- ter of Electrical Engineering, John T. Appleton; Master of Arts, Rev. Harvey Clements, '95, and Meade La Fayette Zimmer, '06; L. L. D., to .J. Franklin FDrt, Governor of New Jersey; Doctor of Commercial Science to Joseph E. Johnson; Doctor of Science to Charles G. Peck, '59; Doctor of Arts to Frank Bailey, '85; 'D. D. to Rev. Putnam Cady; Bachellor of Science to Edward B. Me~ The audience then arose and the exercises were closed by singing \Alma lVIater.\ ---------- GLEE CLUB GAVE FINAL CONCERT. The storm la~ t Tuesday evening ].)revented many who otherwise would have l!Jeen present fron1 attending the eommencemen t concert given by the College Musical Clubs at the Emmanuel Baptist Ch ur·ch. But the·re was a fairly large audience and the excellent work of the clubs was greeted with enthusiasm. The men sang and played their best, whic'h ts very well indeed. The selections give~1 were chosen from the ·prettiest and funniest of their repertoire. They seemed to enjoy the singing and playing toget'her and a:n. added touch of enthusiasn1 was given the per- fonnances by the fact that it was their last con- cert together. The Glee Club, Mandolin Club Or- chestra and quartet all did splendid work. The soloists, Mr. Fuller and Mr. Bell, gave 'Several very beautiful numbers.

An en- tertaining pTogram was listened to by the •.rn.eim- bers of the senior claBs and many of their friends. Class President M. H. Weyrauch presided and in- troduced the speakers. The class 'hi.stDrY was given by Thoma.s E. Haniga~l, who spoke in a humorouB way of events connected with class' college career. The ·class wa.s 100 strong entering. Hits on members o-:fl the class were brought in and the his tory, as a whole was very clever. The ·class poen1 was read by Andrew V. V. Ray- rnon.d, Jr., of Buffalo. The poem was partly hum- orous and partly prettily expressed sentiment. Arthur E. Davies, the class .prophet, told the me1nbers of the senior class what they would be doing fifteen years from their commencement time. ONe was to be a physical trainer for \King Taft.\ Two .of the me1n.bers -of the class were go- ing to construct an elevator from Schenectady to China, the only stop being Hades, where two others would be found shoveling ashes. T'he nrophet described a fu~1ny scene in whieh several membe•rB of the class who had gained control of national polities were holding n n-omination con- vention. But nobody was nominated be-cause each one of the group would vote for nobody but him- ·self. Henry W. Bell was then introduced. He gave a very able oration on \T'he True Aim of a Col- lege Ed. ucatlon/' He discussed the popular idea of a college education as a training in books and scholarship, .and proposed instead of thi::l the ideal character development. He said the college should make of youth, men; of men good citizens, and of good eitizens servants of the best interests of the State. McGill recently inaugurated a military course, which has been approved by the British War Of- fice, and the McGill Unive-rsity Corps is now on the list of those to which commissions in the British army are alloted. Graduates are elegible for rank in any branch of the service except in the artillery, which requires speciq,l training. This privilege is accorded to only one other educa- tional institution in Canada, the Royal M~litary College at Kingston. 0

I; IO THE CONCORDIENSIS BACCALAUREATE 'SERMON. Last Sunday evening began Union's 112th con'l- rnencHment, when Dr. Alexander, O:tlT president ad interim, delivered the baccala 11reate sermon in the Fi r.s t Reforn1ed Chutcn. .. Dr. George R. Lunn presided at the service, aud he first called upon Dr. B. \N. R .. Tayler to reafl the S.crrpture ies·son of the evening. Followtng this til€ IDixed quartet of t'he Reformed Church re11dere~ \The Earth Is the IJord;s. and the Full- ness Thereof.'~ Dr. F·r:ed Winslow Adams of the First Metho- di.st ·Ch.uTeh ted in ·p-rayer. Dr. Lunn then made an earne.st appeal to the me1n bers of the cong l\~· g-at.ion tG contri,bute geneTously for t'he purpo:3B oi ·Bending a number of delegates from the con os€ student body to the Northfield Conference tb1~ sumrn:e1'. Mrs. Boardman sang a soprano solo as a·n offe~· tory. Dr. Lunn then intro·duced Dr. Alexandero to the congregaUon as \a man .so well known to al'l of us in this city that he needs no introductio\l.\ Dr. A1~exander took as his text LHke x: 23-24. Galilee were s;eeing things that stirred the.ir souls. They were receiving a spiritual education that n1ade them the teach·ers and guides of Christetl· dom.\ In speaking of wider Christian philanthropy, Dr. AlexandeT also said: \Looking back upon these days when they walked with Jesus one of the disciples said, 'The Life was manifest and W'~ have seen it.' It is one of the things to rejoice in that all men are getting back to the 'Primal !l..TJd simpl:e t'heoillogy, to acknowledge that Jesus Chrbt is living here, now. Never wa·s He in His maje::;ty and beauty depicted so dearly to the childre\J. <)f men since the days of those who walked with Him in Galilee. \We cannot keep away the thought that whe•1 Jesus uttered these woTds He was thinking of t'he opportunities ope-n to His disciples. l'f it wa:s a blessed thing to live in such a time, what sh~ll ,... we say of those to-day whose ears and eyes a1·e open and are willing to serve? The choice·st of our youth have been going into far lands to plant what .Secretary Taft called th~ ot'her -day 'the \And ·he turned him unto his disciples and said nucleii of civilization.' Some of them have come out of Union. The Lord is standing to-day point- ing to these lands and saying 'Blessed are the privately 'Blessed are the eyes that see the things that ye see.

.. ALUMNI DINNER, It was perhaps a record-breaking attendance at the alumni dinneT held in the State Armory Tue~­ day afternoon, and some of the alumni dated their graduation back as far as '48. Young and old were grouped. about tables in the big drill shed, and together they sang the songs of Union and gave the college yells. The women. who suppHed the dinner occupied seats il1 the 'balcony and to the rear of the speak- ers' table. Rev. John R. HaT ding, D. D., ]])re.~ident of the General Alumni Association, was toastmaster and first introduced Rev. George Alexander, D. D., president ad interim of the college. Dr. Alexan- der delivered a short address in which he spoke of the progress bei11g made by the college and the bright future ahead of it. He did not say any- tl:Jjng about the presidency, but paid a high com- pliment to Dean Benjamin H. Ripton. He was greeted by the alumni with a college yell. He was followed by Dr. Raymond. \I am in a position where I can say just what I wa~1t to now,,, said Dr. Raymond, 'his eyes twink- lii:g, \and I an1 going to tell you what I thinl\ Union College needs the most. It is an athletic field and gy1nnasium. I don't think that there is anything which could work more good for the college, finai1cially, morally or intellectually. I would like to have n1ade this ·::;tatement last ·com- nJence-ment, i11 1906, '05 or '03 for that matter, but I wasn't in a position to do so t'hen.\ Dr. Raymo:..1d then spoke briefly of his thirteen years as the head of Union College. \But now I'm one of the boys,'' he said, ''and I can do as I please. I can stand around with a group of the alumni and criticize and tell how I think the col- lege ought to be run. I wouldn't be surpri$ed if I knew a lot rnore about 'how things ought to be done now than I did when I was president.\ Frank Bailey, treasurer of the college, spoke of the finances of the college, asserting that they are in bette:r condition than in many years. \If we can raise th€ $1@0,000 which will enable us to secure the $100,000 from the General Education Fund,\ he said, \the financial condition will ne better than ever before. \That the college has been progressing is evi- dent, as $50,0 00 has been spent on the library, the dormitories have been repaired at a cost of $12,~ \ TIFFANY & co.

N ott of Princeton, N. J., a }lleinber o.f the class of '48, was the next speaker. Judge Nott has attended fifty-eight of t'he sixty commencements which have occurred ·since he was graduated. He spoke of the times when, he said, \Uni-on was a quiet little college, and Sche- nectady a quiet little town.\ The other speakers who represented their classes, follow: Rev. John K. M·cLean, D.

Wright, who was the next speaker, took up the negative side. He said that for its own good the Republican party ought to be de- feated. Arthur E. Davies then endeavored to show that IVlr. Taft would not promote the best interests of the country because Mr. Hughes was a more ac- ·ceptable candidate. Arthur B.

Of this .number there we.re ten vlctories and one that was really a victory but which couts as a defeat. In two games our opponents scored no runs 1-:. or did they 1nake any hits. The total score t'f our opponents was 30 and that our team 67. ' . The first game of the season was with West Point at West Point. This game was lost but it was not a disgrace to the team. At this time, Dunn '11, was put in the box for the first time and si~~ce has pitc'hed six games, snowing up well In all. The only t'hing that kept u·p the interest in the Ham.iltoa game on the campus was the thought that perhaps the Buff a.nd Blue might get a hit. It was the same with the Rutgers gan1e on the ..... ca:rn·pus. ''\J:''his was the SHcond game in which our opponents sc-ored no runs and .also the second in which Hildreth, with excellent fielding 'Support, p:revented any hits. 'fhe game with Colgate was the most impor- ta:l t one, as on the result of the game hung our eha.l1Ce of getting the pennant. But the team was equal to it and closed the season with a vic- tory, thereby winning the N. Y. S. I .. A. U. pen·· nant.
