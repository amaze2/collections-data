By Edwan;t Everett Hale, Jr. 'There were eerta.in pe.culiariHes about the me- di€val universities that ·seem to· us wise modern people very strange. One was that at first, at least, th·e students- managed the university, in~een were the univeQ'Sity. They made the rules and reg- ulations thelnselves, and themselves guided the university work. Thus they decreed that profes- .sors should nDt a.bsent themselves from lectures. that they should not stop lectures till the close o:f the hour, that they should n·ot omit any part -of the subject in hand, and s-o on. The rector of thE tnliversity, the representative figure ancl ac1min- i,strative of,fices, was at first a student. Thi..s was student government to an extent that we can hardly imagine. It see1ns to us absurd. I rem\e1m1ber a po·eml of m1y early days called \LiUi- p1lt Levee,\ in which \'The children had the upper hand: That was the way in Lilliput Land.\ The poem tells what strange things the cl1ildren clid in managing affairs. I remember only one, \They sawed off the legs of the p&rlor ehair·s.\ This I have always considered an act of vancla~­ L~m. but as I now think of it, the th]ng wa.s prob- ably clone be·cause the children did not like to s: t with their feet sticking str:aight out, ,or hanging down six inches from the floor. It was a good thing to do. ,. Of course we think that if the students man- ::: 1 aged the co·lleges they would do foolish things. .. 'The Seniors, for instance, would extend Senior vn- catloR and have moving up last a week instead of an hour. The Juniors would have a Junior month. The Sephnmores would arrange to have their worl~ optionaL The Freshmen, naturally, would not be allowed any more freedom than at present. In to such modern absurdities we easily turn the medieva.l usage. Yet that usage was not in itself absurd. It had its clear reason, very natural and very ea.sy to understand. The early universi tieR were not institutions like our own, founded by the State or by private beneficence, as a. part of a def- inite educational system. They were originally gatherings of students at one or another city, to attend the teaching· of some professor wh·o under- stood certain matter·s so well that it was worth wl1ile to make a jo·urney to learn of hi'm. Thus In1erius taught Civil L1aw at Hologna, and he un- derstood the matter so well that people flocked to JJearH of hhn from all over Italy. Bologna was full of strangers, studying Civil Law. Now the me- cHeval n1ind conceived of strangers or outside thf; rights ancl privileges of a ~Jlace. The citi7iens of a ,city were fre.e of its privileges, but .strangers were not. The result was that these strangers tn Bo- logna, and later in the other university towns. bad IilO especial relation to the law and no protectif1ll H nder it. But as they were a valtutble a:::set in a town's pro.sperity they naturally began soon to ask and receive privileges, grants, charters, legal status. The professor asked for no 1 e,?;al status, bt:carse as a citiz;en of the city he already be- longed to the· municipality. In the 1nedieval mind a. man had to belong so1newhere. The .students in a strange city wanted to belong somewhere. wanted definite rights. 8? they associated to- gether and asked for charters. The word univer- S\ities in those d:a.ys had nothing to do with the idea of teaching every man everything he could learn. It meant no more than corporation. You rulight have a university of artisans or tradesmen . as well as of students. Indeed, the early univer- sities were not unlike the guilds, and still preserve rnany guild albsurditie.s, which the more practical tradespeople have given up. Not to be too long over the matter, the .students constituted the university and managed it, because they were the perso·ns directly interested. The~· wante·d to learn and they came to a place for that purpose, and they wen~ therefore likely to knovv what they wanted to learn and to devise fairly good rules for getting what they wanted. 'They were the responsible p8rsons. If they made poor la.ws, they were the losers. If they d:d not obey the la.ws they made, they were again the losers. Of course this Golden Age did not last very long. The plan was good so long as the students were penple wh-o gathered at a given place to learn so!nething. But soon an institution arose and with the institution, of course, arose (with various better things) convent:onality an.d pretence. It then beca.me possible for a student by being at the \\\' ......... \\\\ 0 t:'~.;.\? C\': ., 0:1 :.x:; :t> \\\\'f'-\''1 ~...j

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS institution to gah1 s·ome of the\ advantages that hall previon sly co·n:le from studying there. 1At first he lu1ew Civil Law; afterward he had been at Bo- logna and haul reeeived a degree th·ere. It then became posHi ble for a man who could never have got a s.ingle student to ·co1ne across the street to hear hhn to get a title at the university and so to be an ·official ·representative of learning-. These evils arJse very soon, but they were never more apparent than in the E'nglish universities in tht::~ eighteenth ceHtury. Gibbon went to Oxford and found that the only important thing was that he .. should be there. \I spent fourteen months at Mag- dalen College,\ says he, \They proved the four- teen mo·nths th.e most idle and unprofitable of my whole life.\ Gray for a long time desired to be Professor ·of History at Cambridge. He was finally e1ected, but never delivered a s:ngle lecture nor made the slightest pretence of teaching. Gib- bon ancl Gray were men 0f individuality of char- acter. They n.~ight not at best have fitted into any general plan of education. But for all that their experiences s1HlW the way an institution tencl.s to uecome an encl to itself. There hav€ 'been many changes since that day. But we have not got back to the orig~nal sim- plicity of the old medieval university. Perhaps we cannot expe·ct to do so. But until students come expressly to learn and professors are such uecat1se· they can teach, we are likely to have the immense mu~:rdle of conflicting interests and ideas that characterizes the educational world to-day. ProfeHs-ors are apt to be dissatisfied with their teach!.ng to-diay and students with their studies. Sincerity dears things up. It silnplifies matters. When a man really wants something) he is apt to work to get it. But when he da.es not know what. he wants, ·or when he really wants one thing and affects to want another, or when he does not want anything, 1Jut ·s·omebody else wants him to want something, then nobody knows just where he stands, and all is in confusion. Wh:at is a student to do to-day? He cannot seize the reins of governm·ent and manage his col- lege or Ull'~versity, although many seem to think it well to try to· do so. I believe his best course is to forget the institution, as such, as much as he can. Suppose he should resolve to learn solne- thing, to ed ueate himself, to develop his powers, and to be and to be known to be himself rather than a member of any university, c-ollege, class, fr:aternity, association or anything else. Then we might see whether our ·colleges or universit:es ·could give hi'm what he wants. Then they would really be tested, and so would he. AN ALUMNUS A'f QX:FQRD. --- The Rev. Ha1·vey G. Clements Writes of His Ex- peri'ences at This Fam.ous Institution. --\ _,_____.; Through the courtesy of DT. Jmnes B. Trux of this city, we are a lJle to pHbHsh a. 1nost interesting letter written by the Rev. Harvey C. C1etnellts, a recent graduate, and prmninent alumnus of the college who i.s at present persuing a special course of instruction at Balliol College, Oxford. The letter, in part, is as. f()Uo\\\rs: My Dear Dr. Truax: As soon as I aeri ved, a:l!ter a. 1nost tempestuous voyage, I was 1nade a res·ident member of Balliol, and was assigne:d a suite of room.s, the windows o{ which lo·ok out on the gardens of Trinity, a.nd as the foliage here has been particularly fin\e this fall, every time I 1oo1{ out IDY ·eyes meet the per~ fectly gorgeous colorjng on Trinity's lovely chapel. Yo-u are fa1nHiar with the social customs of col- lege life in Oxford, and so will unde·rstand how greatly I ha.ve enjoyed the unique way of living, and as both tutors and students have been ·ex- tramely kind to me, I find that my social life has ·been no small part of my experiences. Adding to my social life has been tbe r()wing experience I am having. Soon aJter co1ning I was asked and urged to \go in\ for rowing a.nd my reluctance was finally overc,ome and I launched on a rowing career. You know how much is n1ade of that sport here, and I have succeeded iH acquiring sufficient ability to be one of sixteen out of fo,rty-five who have stand th·e tests, and now we four \f.ours'' are trying for first place in order to represent Balliol in the races known as \Morrison.s.\ I do not men- tion this through any sense of glory attaching thereby to n1e, but simply that you may under- stand ha:w th·oro·ughly I have been able to find a plaee for my.self on the inside of things. You will probably be most interested in what I have lJeen able to do intellectua.lly, and. especially . along your line. I am having a delightful tim<~ with Prof. Raleigh. I hope you may know him some time, for he is splendid in every way. He is lecturing three time.s a week. on '\The Augustan ' Age,\ and he is most instructive a.ncl interesting. Then he ha.s a se1ninan, whi.ch n1eets ()nee a weel{ in his rooms at Magdalen. There are only twelve of us in this. At the first meeting he read a list

THE CONCORDT£NSTS 7 of forty subjects and asked each of us to choose one for a papet. When this was done he ap- pointed times f·or thPnl to be reacl. For the fi·rsc two weeks he ga.ve papers himseLf. 'The subjects were all among the lesser writers of the 1 Augustan age, or about that time. I am wl'iting on Richard Savage. Besides this worl\ with Raleigh, I am attending Prof. Napier's lectures, three per week, on Eng- li-sh Historical Gram1nar. He is very thorough and I fike him, but I can't say that I enjoy hts subject. Then I am reading Old English with Ml'. Belfour twice a weelc This you see is simply a brushing up of which I clid with you in college. Prof. cle Selincourt is lecturing once a week on Shakespeare, but it is· not nearly as interesting as our olcl class used to be in Union. Prof. Macl\ai1 is giving a. coarse of three lectures on Sp·enser. and a Mr. Carlyle is lecturing on the EngTish novel. I mn hearing all of these, a ncl I thinl\ that is the surn of t11e cours-e here this term. Besides tlle.se lectures in the clepartlnent of English I am going to som·e of the theological lectures. ProL San clay, at Christ Ch nrch, is lecturing on tll.H Lynoptic problem. At the same place Drives is lecturing on Jeremiah. Then old Dr. Cheyne· 11as a class at his home on Messianic prophecy, and I have g~me into that. He is very feeble·, but his mind i.s clear, anrl I enjoy l\nowing him. Besicl~·s an these there are occasional lectures on Arts and Mnsic, so there is quite enough to occupy one's tim.e. · I feel well satisfied with things, ancl I l\now I am getting some invaluable ~xperiences.

Dean Ripton was present and spol\e upon the present condition of the college. Among the other speakers were William H. Burr, General Timothy E. Wilcox, Dr. Thoma.s R. Featherston- haugh, Co-ngressman Ransdell, Rev. J. Van Scho:ck, jr., Congressman W. S. Bennet and James H. Davidson. A noticea.ble feature of the banquet was the as- sociation's hearty endorsement of De:an Ripton for the presidency of the college. THE PARKER-ADELPHIC D:EBATE. lhe AQ:e,liphic Excel, in the Presentation of Fac.ts and Wln the Debate. ...----- In .a skillfully co11:tested dl~bate, replete at tim€s with b l··Htiant repartee :and eloquence the. Adelph tc Liter.a:t'Y Bociety of the c.o'llege defeated the Parl~:~:l~ Debating 1Society of the Albany Law School in 1. joint cl·eba;te, held in J erma in Hall, Albany, on FI·i- day ·evening. The Adelphk Soctety clearly ont- l::oiB.ted their .opp,onents in the logical presentation of the1r argument, ancl the co-onlination of e3'dl ind ividua:l argument to U1e question at issue. In. the citations from .authority and in the presents:- tion of facts the Aclel_phics were exce·ptionallr strong. The p,arker Debating· Society, on the otl~ sr· hand, was decidedly superio-r in the elegance of their expression anel in their style of delivery. The subject of debate was: H.esotved. Thg.t mnnicipal ownership anfl O}:enl- tion of locaJ public utili ties is for the best inter- ests .o.f the public. The Parker Debating Society, represeu. ted by n:. ~. Nellis, '08. H. D. Brockett, '09, and J. 0. Bates, '09, wtth F·. :vr. vv1ilcox as alter- n::tte, upheld the affirm·ative side of the pro·positi()n, while the Adelphics, consisting of E. L. LaCros.::::e, '08, A. E. Davies, '08, and :vr. WI~}Tanch, '08, w~i th E. K. Mlould, as alternate, upheld the negative. D,a vies wa.s substittlted for A. B. King·, '08, wllo was una.ble to appear. Nell i:s, the first speaker for the affi.rrnative, argued, th-at the private 1nonopoly of public uti H- Ues has resulted in a .maximum of profit to fhe owner with a minhroqum of benefits to the pub! ic, anc1 th .. at in exacting excessive rates, the owner of a pn hi ic utility is virtually exercising the .power of taxation. LaCrosse, for the neg-ative, in definh1g the question, placed particular eJ.rl})hasis on tne fa·ct that it was limited to past and present ex- perien ees and this lJO in t waR strongly reiterated l.Jy his e()-lleagues throughout the deb.ate proving a fohndd.able argument in exclud·ing many of their opponents' argtnnents from the debate. He th€n .s.howed the economi-c clisadvan tages of mmnicipa 1 ownership, and slrbstantiatecl his argunnen ts oy frequent citations from .authority, skillfully t nrn- ing many of his OlJ·lJOnents' argu1ruents in his favor. Brockett, who followed for the negative, pointed

THE: CONCORDIENSIS ==~~========~======== out that private ,m\onopoly jeopardizes the inteFest of the ~people in disregarcling their rights, a.nd de- stroys free governmei1t. Davies_, for the affHnna.- ti ve, declared that 1~unicipal ownership is ethically disadvantageous inasmuc:h as it checks invention, destroys individuality, a.nd results in ~a.tr inequal- ity .of taxation. 'Bates, the third speal\er of the affia:m.ative, in a vigoro11.s and forceful manner, a.tte1nlpted t& prove that municipal owner.s-.hip does away with Ute anta,gonism of inte~rests 1a.nd thus eradicates m:any of the evils of private ownersb~p. Weyrauch, for the neg-ative, strongly contended that 1nunid1Jal ownership is ,politically disadvanta.geous inasmuch as it is a strong incentive to graft, and he coTrobm~­ ated his argument .by .citing the experience of cities- in va.rious ·parts of the w·orld where corrup- ti0n and mlunicipal owners.hip ha.s been ins.epar- able. The Adelphics were especially strong in rebuttal, and skillfully took advantage of a.ll the weak points in the arguments of their op}Jonen ts. The ju·dges, consisting of Verpl,ank Co·lvin, Al- bert J. Danaher and Dr. John H. Skilleorn, ren- de-red a unanimous decision in favor of the Ade1- p·hic SociG>ty. The Hion. W·illiam, P.

Speake!': You who have tears, prepare to .shed then1 now. You all do l\:now this examination paper. I 1·em:em ber the first time ever the student upon it wr·ote: 'Twas on a December's afternoon in Wash bern HaH, That day he .struggled with the profs and tutes. Lool-\:, in this place ran Ashey's blue pencil th ro1.1gh. See what a 11l:larl\: the envious Garry made. Thrcngh this the· wellwheloved Johnny B. his pencil cll·ew And as he :plHckecl the pen a way, lVIarl{ how tb~e flow of curses followed it. Now Ashey., as you know, was the student's angel. Judge, 0 y:e Freshman's god, how dearly the .stn- dent lovecl hiln! This was tliJ.€ n1ost unkinclest mark of all. For when t1te no·ble student saw him draw the marl~. IngratitLHle, 1nore strong than prof's blue pencils. Quite vanquished hiln. Then burst his mighty braiu And, in his coat sleeve muffling up hi.s face E:ven at the· foot of Ashey's de-sk, the mighty stu· dent fell. First Student: 0, piteous spectacle! Second Sttident: 0, noble classmate! F·ourtb Student: 0, most horrid sight! Speaker: Good students, sweet students, let me not stir you np To such a s udclen flood ·of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable, For all the faculty are honorable rp.en. \Vhat private griefs they have, alas! I l-\now not, That made them do it; they are wise and honor- able, And will, no doubt, with rea.sons answer ynu. I come not, friends, to steal away your hear~s. I am nc} orator, as Micky Ann is. But ,as yoH all ln1ow me, a plain, blnnt; .student, That loves n1y classn1ate, and that the faculty ln1ow full well. EXEUNT.

Inglis and· Wise easily excelled. For the fir.st five minutes the phr was close a11n exciting, each side· scoring a basket, although Union hacl many tries, but on account of the very strange style of basket was una.ble to .connect.

Dr. Cady Supplements His Interesting Lecture on This Subject by Many Fine Views of Egypt. Last Frid:a.y afternoon the thi·rcl lecture of the ~eries on archaeology was given by Rev. Pntm:311 Cady. The specific topic of the lecture bein.~ \Egyptian Art and Architecture.\ Dr. Cady Ulc~­ trated his re1narks with m,any fine views of Eg;n: L He clealt princi1~ally with the pyra..mdcls, .and point- eel· out the relation of these mi·1.ssive stone struc- tures to art .and architecture, decl:~.ring that they plainly show the wonderful engineering abilitie3 of the ancient Egyr~tians, being built not f8l' ;beauty's sake, but for eternity. Dr. Cact\T also gave a graphic description of the temples of Luxor and Karmak and of m1any of the old Egypti111 ocelisks. These lectures are lJecom·ing very populal', as s~1own .by the fact that mo·re come e~ach y;c;\:. They ·certainly are very interesting and in3trn2- tive, and they inspire in one a g-re::tt desire to visit this land of past ·richness and power. This same topic will be the stl'hject of Dr. C3 dy's lecture next Friday afternoon, at 4: 30 o 'elock. To increase the good fellowship between the underclassmen, the So-phomores of L.ehigh re- cently gave a srnol<er to the· Freshmen.

J That the field of en<lea vor of the Intercollegiate Civic Lea.gue, ·a branch o.f which has heen recently established at Union, is large, and that the natun~ of the work which it uJ.ildertakes is ~both pleasing and instructive, is well evidenced by the article written by William H. Allen, secretary of the Bu- reau of Municipal Research of N·ew York City, and recently received by President LaCrosse of the local Civic League. The article is, written under the caption \L.eader.ship by Intelligence,\ and is, in part, as follo·ws: \The following Am.erican colleges and univer- sities hav-e contribute-d to the preparation of the present staff o.f the Bureau of Municipal Research of New York city: An1.11erst, Carleton, ·Chicag·o, Clarl{, Columbia, Cornell. DePauw, Harvard, Io-wa~ New York, Union, N-orth western, Pennsylva.nia: Smith, rrufts. Berlin, Hall·e, Leips-ic and the Sor- bonne have added touches here ancl there. Just what part did colleges have in fitting- tl:te college graduates on our staff for municipal research? During the ,college days, neither their instructo-rs nor themselves had ever contemplated a work such as that in which they are now engaged. Some of them prepared for the law, others for teach}ng, and one or two for accountancy. Yet to-day it is doubtful if one of them would exchange the prob- lems. with which he i:s now dealing for a more re- munerative post as lawyer, teacher or accountant. \The attraction offered by municipal res·earch. is due to the fact that it seems to promise a. real- ization. of the gteat American dream. that usually grows dimmer and dimmer after .college walls are .l-eft behind, viz: Self-government \for the benefit of all the governed. This dream will Rever come true simply because college m,en go into polities. Unless college training has radically changed within the last twelve months, it would he a civic tragedy to turn over the government o:f 1Atmerican ,cities to men chosen simply bec::1nse they were college n1e11. In talking· to ou1· professors, to o·ur students, or to the outside world Lhat is denied tl1e· n1on-op-oly we· enjoy as college men, it 1nay be excusa-ble ta keep np C1e tradition that there is t:on1e .special n1erit in a lHlChelor's degree. But between ourselves in the Intercollegiate Civic League,. what, pray, is tl~ere al.Jout our college training, our four years o.f fraternity life, athletics and electives to enable us to guess within gunshot of the amount necessary to run a Board of Health; whether asphalt pavement is an incb or a foot tl1ick; whether a tenement hou.se (te·partm.ent i.s spending too little or too much money; whether i:t city budget should be $143.0·00,000 or $100,000,- 0·00, or just where economy is pes sible? \The Bureau of Municipal Research believes that one reason why so few. college men g-o into politics and the chief reason why the college man in politi.cs has so often compromi.serl with corrup- tion when he started out to annihilate it, is that the colleg-e man has failed to see that the partic- ular kind of intelligence that is neec!ecl in g-ov- ernment and not intelligence about Rameses, Hobbs, ~ristotle, Nepolean, or Spherical Trig·., or English Lit. ''In municipal government, as in fo-otball, the rule ·of the ga1ne should be: Watch tbe ball. This is the one thing that has not hitherto been done. It is the thing that is not generally conte1nplated when ·college men are urged to go into p-olitics, but just as sure as watching the quart-er-back or left-end will lose the football championship, so watching the :Mayor -or Comptroller or Alderman will continue the evils of American municipal

Just as in football, too, the te.st of the ])llaye-r is what he is able to d9 with the 'ball and with his tea.m, s·o the test of the c-ollege man in politics is the extent to which he can advance the interests of his constituents; their interests, like the ball, are objective, countable, vi.s:ible, • watchable things, not birthmarks or character. needs. When colleg:e men O•nee have this feeling, their pride· as citizens and as men of general in- telligence will lead them to ask the questions and to head the mov·ements ne·cessary to secure ef- ficiency in the government of American cities.\ -------- COLLEGE MEETING Wheadon, '08, Voted a Football \ U \ by the Student Body Tllie ·C·o11ege n1·eeting last 1week ·was presided over by Vice~Pres-ident L . .S. Hoff·man, '08. A mo- Non .was ma:de •to the effe·ct that Ra-ybon F. Whea- don, '08, should be recom1Jn'ended by the :student body to the athleti.c hoa.rd as posses•sing ·sach qualities as sih .. ould 1nake him eUgible to .a foot- ball \U.\ Wheado·n ll·as ser:ved .fai•tlhJu11y on the second team fo•r four yeaTs and this year he playe·d in the :first three regular grumes besides parta. of \Last year President Roosevelt urged the mem- bers of the Interc.ollegiate Civic League 'to take an intelligent, disinterested and pra.ctical part in the every-day duties of the ave.ragG citizen.' At present, it is in1possible for intelligent m·en to take :an intelligent part in the dut.i es of citizen- ship, because city records are so kept that they eitheT tell falsehoods or tell only a small part of the truth necessary to intelligent ju-dgment. If the presidents of the colleges above mentioned were to be sent to Boston to serve as the .small co-mrnis.sion which President Eliot urges to re.f.nrm municipal goven1ment in the United States, they could not possibly be intelligent about the needs of B.tJston or do the intelligent thing f.or Hos·ton -other g.ame!S. This reeord was C•ons.f.de'fed as justifica:tion .f·or the a·cti·on to ·award him a \U.\ wiU1out first insuring re·cords that will describe wo-rk done when done and account for money spent when spent, in such a way that the average citizen. in Boston would understand what he was getting for his money and what was not being done that he wanted done. \It is with governrn.ent as with morals, the in .. telligence that does. us the m·ost good is not the intelligence that we ours-elves possess about our .. selves, but the intelligence that others possess a;bout us. You are, of course, good in spots, because of what we l\now, but we ar·e also go-odl often times, because other p-eople know exactly what we are doing. Intelligence is most useful to the gov-erned when it is in their possession to tel1 them what gov·erning officials are about. \The Bureau O·f Municipal Research aims so to mass th·e facts of government as to produce arti- ficially the light and the neighbor's eye whlch will inhi·bit the desire to rnisgo·vern. For the execution of t11is program, college men are needed. When they do not sincerely love to be intelligent, they at least like to· s·eem to he intelligent. I can c·on- ceive of no greater service that can be rendered by the Intercollegiate Civic Leagu·e than to spread among its 1nem bership the idea that no intel- ligence is negotiable in matters politic, but intel- ligence as to governm·ent encls and community T'his sentim·ent has been growing steatd.Uy ;since the football season, wfhen the awards were made, and at las•t ca:m.e to a e:ri.sis on Monday in tih.e ;a.c ..

CADY'S FOURTH LECTURE Egyptian Art and Architecture De- scribed On Friday laBt the Rev. Putnam Cady gave the fGurth of his series of lectures in tl:le College Chwpel. The subject was \Egyptian Architecture an.d Art,\ but it treated :particularly ·of the subj8ct of colu1nns, their inscripti·ons and tbeir forn1s . 'The lect.ure was illustrated as usual and a large number ·of beautiful view.s of ancient Thebes and varton.s ·o:t.her ruins of tem 1 ples were shown. In des·cribing Thebes Dr. Cady n1entioned a fact kn·own to few, t'hat the ruins of that city -were oaly discovered in the latter part of the eigh- t·eenth eentury. Particular attention was given to a •description of the Colossi of Memnon and their history. This was followed by a detailed a·ccount of the prog- ·ress ·of art in the Inaking ·of the old Egyptian col- l1m1ns as used in ·their teinples and colonnade'.s. Dr. Cady also went on -to· show that the· Greeks ·have only eo,pied Egyptia.ns in fheir Doric and Ionic architechrre. :The larg·e attendance a11·d t•ile o· t · ~ orea apprema- Uon shown by the aud·ience give evidence that the s ~wden.t body are awakening t.o the fact that Dr. Cady is perforn1i-ng a great service in ,delive•ring these lectures.

THE CONC'ORDIENSIS 13 RUTGERS SWAMPED Union Five Overwhelms Scarlet by a Scort of 33 to 6 Ia a ga;me marked by m!any fouls, Union's basketball tea1n badly defe.ated Rutgers Saturday night by a score of 33 to 6. The features of t:ile gam,e were Union's pasB1ng and .Starbuck's ability to .throw f·ouls.. Rutgers lhad m·any chances to throw but could not find the basket, a.n;J' in the second half, was no~ abl!e to n1ake a single point. For the first five ininutes of play ·neither side had any advantage . until Starbuck caged the ball .for the first score O'f the gan1e. At this time Hovey was inJured and time called. Almost iln- mediate·ly afte-r Starbuck tluew two foul::; and made another basket fr.mn the field. Although many eha.n·ces arose, Rutgers eould not score, and f at the end of .the first half the score stood 14 to 6 in favor ·D-f Union. The se·coad half w:as entirely in Union's fa.vor, for although the Rutgers players by clever pass- ing could bring the ball to within s.il:ooting dis- tan·ce of the, hasket, t~hey ~coul-d n·o:t n1ake a point. Then Union, getting a start, piled up the score until at the end ·nf the game it stood 33 to 6. The line-up was as follows: Un,ion. Ru;tgers.
