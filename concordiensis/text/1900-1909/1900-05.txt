THE ~NG®RDIENSlS. VoL. XXIII. · UNION COLLEGE, MAY 2, 1900. No. 24. 4 ' THE SCIEN'TIFIC METHOD IN THEOLOGY.'' (By PROF. FRANKS. HOFFMAN.) Great interest, especially for Union students, attaches to the April number of the North American Review. The reason for this is that it contains a timely atticle by one of our pro- fessors, D1·. Hoffman, of the departtnent of :Philosophy. The article in question is one bearing directly upon the present animated dis- cussion in theological circles as to the formation ()[ theologies and creeds. Dr. Hoffman holds that any theology, in order to receive any degree of universal acceptance, must be constructed in a scientific manner; and that none can \ serve the cause of true religion by ignoring the facts of modern science.\ In llis exposition of this scientific method which must be applied to theology in order to effect- ively influence the thought of the day, he brings <>ut clearly tl1e place of induction and deduction. ]nduction may be used to designate the old Socratic way of attaining definitions. This is merely arithmetical addition to our store of l<now }edge. Again it may mean any process of adding to our knowledge. This is too broad, just as the first is too narrow, The proper sig- nificance of the term \represents it as the process of thought by which we pass fron'l particulars to generals, or from causes to effects.\ Induction and deduction are not wholly inde- pendent but are frequently blended or employed alternately. From the gathering of knowledge from all available qttarters the mind passes to the hypothe- sis or the supposition as to what the general is which includes these particulars, or what the cause is which produces these effects. The hypothesis is the '' great and distinctive element in all induction.\ It is purely a product of the constructive imagination. The next step is to verify it. To do this we make the hypothesis the major premise of a deductive syllogism and if our conclusion coincides with the facts of our previous know ledge we infer that our hypothesis is correct. Hence ·it follows that the truth of every induc- tion necessarily rests upon the theory of proba- bilities. Since it is possible to examine only a few of the particulars, the conclusion which is drawn is only probably true. We have no abso- lute knowledge except that of our consciousness and a few simple intuitions. These latter are not arrived at by any process of reasonining but are immediately beheld. There is no gathering of facts to substantiate them as in the scientific method. Every natural scientist believes in the law of gravitation but he has examined only a few of the particles of matter. There is a high degree of probability that his hypothesis is cor- rect but he can never substantiate it beyond doubt. Probability is asserted to be \the very guide of life.\ We eat our food with the proba- bility that it will nourish us and do a thousand and one things on the probability that we will receive benefit from them. So it is when we enter the realm of theology. The same powers of mind are used in its con- struction as in the construction of any other science. In looking about for the facts for the construction of it, we get them not merely from a supposed revelation, although that revelation may supply part of the data, but from every source where it is possible to obtain truth. . These facts are of two kinds, external and inter- nal. By internal, \we mean the facts of ones own consciousness, and by external, all else that can be mentioned.\ The former are certain to one, the latter only probable. And it is from the latter mainly that the hypotheses of theology are made up. An examination of the Apostie's

THE CONCORDIENSIS. Creed will establish the fact of its resting upon the theo·ry of probability. It begins with a stateme.nt of belief in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth. Now the existenc·e .of an Absolute back of nature is a certainty, but every statement concerning the nature of that Absolute as Father Altnighty, maker of heaven and earth, is a matter of n1ere probability. So with the stat~tnents concerning Jesus. Whether he ever existed as a human being is a matter of historical evidence and should be treated as such. All evidence is more or less probable. We can never be certain that the writer was accurately acquainted with the facts of his life, whether he honestly reported them, or whether they have not been so frequently altered as to lessen their value. If we regard it as veritable history, yet the doctrine of his divinity, whether or not he was in reality the Son of God, is an induction from certain alleged facts. All we can conclude from them as well as the other positions of the creed is that the degree of probability in their favor is very high. The author of the creed, with the data which he had before hin1, was able to say ''I believe,\ not \ I am absolutely certain.\ And there would be little difference as to the source of his information. Even assuming that his source is the Scriptures and that every word in the Scriptures catne from the lips of God, the person who heard it would never be absolutely certain that he had heard it correctly, or had written it down correctly, or understood it cor- rectly after he had written it. All that can be said is that the argutnents in favor of it are much stronger than those against it. This applies to all creeds as well as to the Apostle's Creed. All that we can do is to establish their probable truthfulness and not be content with mere assertion but verify them by reason. Man has been given such powers and he is to use them in constructing not only his sciences but also his theology. He should take up his theology in the same way in which he takes up every other science. He should begin with doubt; not with doubt as an end but as a tneans to knowl- edge. To continue to doubt forever would be as foolish as to refuse to eat when hungry. The m.an who would wait to act until he was abso- lutely certain of success would never accomplish anything. H\is doubt shotlld be his fi.rst step toward knowledge. He should thoroughly test everything, accepting or rejecting it according as the probabilities are for or against it. The teachings of Jesus should be viewed in this way on the ground of their inherent Teasonableness. But while holding this position, \we also firmly believe that the probabilities that he spoke the truth are so high that they can never be made higher; that, when his doctrine concerning God and tnan and nature are correctly apprehended, it will be clearly seen that they fully satisfy the detnands of the intellect and the cravings of the heart. And we do not regard it at all likely that any theology of the future will have much influence over the minds of the thoughtful, that does not draw its chief and n1ost itnportant data fron1 that source.\ The age has been criticized as one of novel reading and devotion to trifles, but there surely has never been a n1ore earnest one. It is not ready to acknowledge the supernatural, is more inquiring than asserting, more doubting than believing. But spiritual questions have never been 1nore widely discussed or more unspar- ingly criticized. The great need is a truly scientific theology; not one of any particular sect or person but one \ so cautiously construc- ted as to exclude all fiction, and so profound and cotnprehensive in its teachings as to include all facts.\ W.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. THB. BASEBALL TEAM. Qecord of Games Played During the Past Week. VERMONT, 18; UNION, 12. Wretched fumbling and errati:c tln·owing to bases gave the game to Vermont last Tuesday by a score of r8 to 12. The Union men put up a sorry exhibition of baseball and, in conse- quence, their old titne rivals, the Vern1onters, won hv a comfortable margin. The contest on both sides became a procession, in which the infielders, by careless work, and the pitchers, by numerous bases on balls, took prominent posi- tions. BY INNINGS. l 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 i!

Sir Lew Whistler's Schenectady State League ~ nine defeated the Garnet on Thursday by the free silver score of 16 to 1. The professionals had their own way from the very start and kept gradually increasing their margin. They played a batting game, hitting Edwards freely. The Union infield, with the exception of · Cook, played a very ordinary game. Both Grout and Lawton threw poorly to first while Edwards, at that base, rnuffed several easy catches. The Vermont infield was son1ewhat The fielding of Union was considerably better than in the Vennont game. Paige was put in at first and accepted thirteen out of fou,rteen chances. Witbeck at second and Grisw<>ld at the plate wet·e reliable throughout. But Schroeder in right field put up a very listless game, failing to get near several excellent chances. Union scored her only run, an earned one, in the last inning. The sutnmary: superior. . . . Oakley and W ttbeck, constdenng their sup- port, both pitched good gam~s, b~t seven hits apiece being secured off thetr dehvery. E?th were rather erratic, however, Oakley betng particularly generous with bases on balls. Wit- beck proved a puzzle, and eight VennoEters had three strikes called. In the outfield, Parker played an ex:cellent game. He tnade one very difficult catch. Behind the bat Griswold caught particularly well. The sumn'lary : VERMONT. Wasson, c ................. .

TIIE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 UNION, 7; COLUMBIA, 3· Witbeck was the central figure in the victory at Albany last Friday over Columbia. R e struck out ten men, put out four nJ.ore, tnade two assists and ot;te error, besides hitting safely and scoring one run. The beRt support of the season was given by the Union men and, as a result, but three tnen frotn the big New York university crossed the plate. The victory ca1ne as a tnost pleasant surprise to the college world after the discouraging work during the early part of the week. Columbia was ~upposed to have a much stronger nine and the result was therefore scarcely anticipated. Her tnen, however, played well together .and were only beaten out by reason of the superior , pitching of the Garnet twirler. The Union infield showed decided hupl·ove- ment. Paige, who again played first, was the only weak n1an. His errors are still excusable for he was suffering at the tirne fron1 a severe cold in the eyes. The game was tied until the seventh inning when Union by three base hits, a base on balls, a wild throw, a sacrifice and a base on balls sent three men around the bases. Colutnbia was unable to solve Witbeck's curves and could make no more scores. The stnnmary: COLUMBIA. A.B. R. lB. S.H. P • 0. A .. E.

The sixth annual New York State inter- collegiate oratorical contest was held at Syra- cuse, April 24, and first place was won by Willian.1 John Henry of Syracuse University. The hall was well filled with college and city people and President Francis E. Bacon, of the Chamber of Commerce presided. Music was furnished by the mandolin club and by two soloists, so that the program was plea&antly varied. Clayton Johnson Potter of Union was the first speaker and tnade an excellent impression both by his oration, entitled ''A True States- tnan,\ and by his easy delivery. Mr. Henry of Syracuse followed him with an oration on Henry Clay. He pictured him as the most versatile and active of American statesmen and showed what great services he rendered his country in those troubleson1e titues. The last speaker was Satnuel Fraser Langford of Rochester. The subject of his oration was \Assimilation in American Progress.\ He discussed the character of the Atnerican people and attributed its progress particularly to the power of assimilating whatever is good in other nations. At a tneeting of the Executive Committee of the League it was decided to hold the contest at Union next yeat·, and the following officers for I900-J90I were elected: President, Charles P. Wagoner; secretary, James ,V. Cheesbo- rough ; chairman of the executive cotnmittee, ArthurS. Golden, Union; and 0. D. Esten and G. M. VanSlyke representatives of Rochester and Syracuse respectively.

Y., as second- class matter. Cl1as. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THE SUCCESS which came to the baseball team on Friday in the shape of a victory over Columbia is only another example of how by ''keeping ever- lastingly at it\ our efforts are bound to be re- warded. Though· defeated twice. the baseball team did not lose confidence in itself nor has the students' faith in it been shaken. Everyone recog-- nizes that it is only after several \shake-ups\ that the ability of players in the different positions can be tested,. Every game thus far has had its lessons, and by getting the benefit of then1, those in control of the team will, we are confident, give us the ideal Union college baseball team. THE CONCORDIENSIS is glad to give in this num- ber an account of the n1e1nbers of the class of 1850. Satisfactory news has been obtained of an unusu- ally large proportion of the class, and a copy of this issue is being sent to every 1i ving metnber whose address is known. This task completed, the editors feel that theit share of the worir, in so far as the class of '50 is concerned, is finished. rt now remains for the general alumni association and the various members of the class to work up a setni-centennial reunion for next June. As an- nounced a week ago, news of the class of '60 will be printed in next week's paper. The class is a large and hnportant one and it is desired that all information ,concerning its nembers be handed in at the earliest possible opportunity. THOUGH Union did not come off triumphant in the oratorical contest of last week, still we have 11one the less cause to feel proud of our representa- tive and of his effort. That it was one which reflected credit upon Union is proved by the follow- ing editorial from the Syracuse \Forum.\ \The intercollegiate contest in oratory last Tues- day evening between Union, Rochester and Syra- cuse was an occasion when worthy n1en met in close and intense rivalry for the honor of the insti- tutions they represented. Seldom has there been a contest held here in which the result was so doubtful. Every speaker seemed to possess some qualities in which the others were lacking. We rejoice in the victory won by Mr. Henry. At the same time his opponents deserve hearty words of praise and conunendatiou for the magnificent way in which they acquitted themselves.\ THE TRACK managen1ent is to be congratulated over the success of the meet held with the local military orgat1izatton, and it is to be hoped that it will be found possible to arrange for a return out- door meet on our own grounds. Contests of this nature are a powerful incentive to more faithful training and it is only by meeting strong opposing teams that the weak points in our own team can be brought to light. There were plenty of weak points shown on Wednesday night. In the first place more men should come out and try for the team; and in the second place; some of the men already on the team should be tnore strict in their training. The hiri11g of an experienced coach is a step in the right direction. We are glad to see Mr. Weaver on the track and we congratulate the college in

• THE CONCORD IENSIS. i1 being able to obtain his services. What is needed now above all is a crowd of forty or fifty 1nen on the track every afternoon ready to try their skill in the various events. May 30 is not a great way off, and if we expect to turn out a winning team we . must get to work and stick to it. NEW YORK TRIP OF THE MUSICAL CLUBS LAST WEEK. The musical association left last Thursday for Satigerties where the first concert was given at the Maxwell Opera I-Iouse in the evening. Mr. Fred. N. Moulton, had charge of the arrange- tnents for this concert. The next day the clubs left for ICingston and gave their second concert before an enthusiastic audience at Y. M. C. A. Hall. This was the best concert of the trip fron1 an artistic standpoint. The news of Union':::; baseball victory over Columbia that afternoon was duly celebrated after the concert. At 8 : 16 Saturday rnorning the 111usicians left for New York and on arrival there, at once pro- ceeded to the Hotel Savoy, the clubs' head- quarters while in New York. The afternoon was largely given up to sight seeing and amuse- ments of yarious kinds, and at 8 :30 the concert began with the Song to Old Union by the Glee club. Every selection was encored again and again and responded to with equal vigor. The house was cotnpletely filled, every seat having been sold beforehand. Among the audience were seen a number of Schenectady people. Much credit for the success of the concet·t is du~ to the hard and earnest work of Trustee E. S. Barney who took altnost entire charge of the arrangements for the concert. A large nun1ber of alutnni \vere present and were in-vited on the stage to join in the Song to Old Union which was given with a will, and was followed by the college yells. As a whole the trip was a success and the n1anage1nent is to be congratulated on its result. The New York alumni association under whose auspices the concert was held also deserves great praise for its loyal support of this branch of undergraduate life.

THB ®NG®RDIBNSIS. VoL. XXIII. UNION COLLEGE, MAY 9, 1900. No. 25. JERUSALEM AS SEEN BY THREE UNION MEN. 'lilt More than a year ago the undersigned prom- ised to tell how three Union n1en went to Jerusa- le·m. All of you ate familiar, more or less, directly or indirectly, with some things that improve with age. This improvement is often true with the tales of travelers, for they forget in time all the unpleasant and disagreeable fea- tures, and retnernber only the delights and beauties of the scenes. Sotnetimes, too, an account, t·olling over and over in the author's tnind, gathers etnbellishments and decorations not found in the original but nevertheless ituprovements. Be that as it tnay, I an1 sure that the three subjects of my sketch would gladly forget son1e of their experiences and pass over with a few words various trials and would dwe11 long upon the golden memories. For example, Young would like to leave untold how peculiarly he felt on the steatner when sailing down the coast, or how many times he went to the rail to look at the pretty fishes in the bright, blue sea; he would also leave unexplained why he persisted in sitting flat in the bottotn of the boat that landed us at Jaffa, dancing about as it did on the restless waves. Wood, too, I ven- ture to guess, would rather not dwell upon the fact of having packed soft boiled eggs in the the same saddlebag with his clean duck trousers. Nor would the writer have cared to have a pic- ture of himself as he appeared iR the streets of Haifa aftet· his four days' ride frotn Jerusalem. But all of these are ghosts of the past and had better rest in their graves,-we will not disturb their slumbers. Our party, as already intitnated, consisted of George Young, '96; Dann Wood, '97, George Dieley, Williams '97, and the writer. It is sufficient to say that we landed at Jaffa, after a day and a night on the deep, and a good portion of us in the deep, and after a lunch at ·Mr. Hardegg's hotel, proceeded by rail to J erusa- lem, where we put up at Hotel Henstnann's. I have noticed that many writers, in describ- ing historic places, are inclined to recount their feelings as they stand on some tower or mountain overlooking the scene, and invariably those feel- ings assun1e an authorized fonn ; .swe1Iing floods of ernotion, and tears of sympathy for the glorious past, and prophetic visions of the brightening future always arise. Whereas, if the truth were really toJd and :the writer were not trying to feel as he thought he ought to under those circutnstances, he would find that the swelling floods and tears and visions all catne after reaching his own private study in his own native land. Things are not what they see1n when one stands atnidst the realities. But aren't we to hear about Jerusalem? Certainly, only when dealing with Oriental sub- jects it is best to deal in an Oriental tnanner, and not be too hasty. An Arab has all the tin1e there is, and it isn't money, either ; so no tnatter if he does waste a little in idle talk. But Jerusaletn,-when shall we begin to describe it? J erusalen1-how the name lingers on one's tongue! It is hard to go right at the modern city and see it as it is. We would much rather dream a titne over what it has been ; to picture to ourselyes the Holy City; to review its historic greatness and its fancied glory. And, as we sit on this hotel balcony, the tuoonlight giving us gli1n pses here and tbe1·e of graceful tninarets or rounded do1nes, ·we try to picture it to ourselves and realize that it is indeed true. J erusalern,-can it be that we are in its ·very tnidst? Are we indeed where all those great events have taken place? Is this that we are looking upon the very site of the city of David and Solomon and Herod? Is this the city of Saracen and the crusades? And in these very streets did Jesus walk? Yes, it is in very truth the place,- Jerusalem, ''the place of peace.\ It is well that one arrives late in the afternoon, too late to see the city that day, and can have the first evening to sit on the balcony and dream, while still in ignorance of what is really about him. The second night's dreatns would hardly be so sweet and satisfying. Jerusalern, as it is today, is not noted for gilded palaces or cleanly swept pavetnents. It is divided into two tna in portions, the old city and the new city. The fonner lies within tl1e walls and has a population of about twenty thousand ; the lat- ter is north of the old city and of about the same size. Of course it is the old city that attracts one's attention, though the new is inter..-

T'HE CONCORDIENSfS. FlQST LEAGUE GAME A VICTORY. Hobart Defeated Through Witbeck's :Remarkable Work. The 'Varsity defeated Hobart on the ca1npus last Saturday in .a closely contested game by a score of 13 to 9· This was the first league gatne. Witbeck pitched a brilliant game, which, but for· poor support in a critical inning, should have resulted in a victory by a 1nore coanfortable margin. Hobart put up a rock bottom fielding ga1ne, much superior to that of her opponents; but Folger's curves were easily solved by the local 1nen. The contest started in a chilly ahnosphere, the unpleasantness of which was greatly increased by a blustering breeze that, had it continued, would have caused manv errors and a large score. In the third inning ~it increased to a fury and as suddenly gave way to a light breeze and sunshine. The fortunes of the two nines varied frotn the very beginning. I-Iobart scored an earned run in the first trial at bat, while Union received three goose eggs. In the fourth, however, Witbeck crossed the plate on his own hit, two sacrifices and a short fly by Parker. Bunting started the fun in the following inning by a nice one in short right. Lawton followed with a safe one, Grout struck out, Robinson got to first on Stettenbenz's futnble, and the bases were full. Witbeck, who was next up, waited for a good ball and smashed it over the round build- ing terrace for a hon1e run. Needless to say, there was a little exuberance of spirit on the benches. In the next inning, after Bunting had scored, forced by a base on balls, the Union pitcher nailed another one over the center fielder for two bases, which brought in three 1nore. Eight Hobart men retired on three strikes up to the end of the fifth, and conse- quently the others had but stnall opportunity to run the bases. They tnanaged to tally once in the sixth and then bad a little circus in the sev- enth. Two hits, a base on balls and three wild infield throws resulted in five runs. Hobart then secured two more in the eighth, and brought the score to a tie. Union then did a little base running on her own account. Three hits and a forced hit filled the bases, when the hero of the day stepped to the plate. Sufficient to say, the ball landed in the vicinity of Wash- burn Hall. The Garnet was four rLtns to the good. For the visitors, Blanchard, Folger and Brook played a brilliant fielding game, while Wilcox proved himself a reliable hitter. The work of Witbeck fot Union was remarkable. A badly twisted ankle incurred in the first part of the eighth did not n~nder hirn the less efficient. Griswold was good behind the plate. Grout continued his customary eratic throwing fro.tn third. Edwards did rather poorly at second. Bunting w.a.s tried at first, but had few reasonable ~chances. Lawton and he batted well. Parker tnade one very pretty throw from center to the plate. The sumrnary : HOBA.R'T. A. :B. R. lB. S.H. P.O. A. E.

The two alcoves in the northeast corner of the library and two sections of a third alcove are now devoted to the books of the late Hon. Henry James Cullen, '6o, which V\Tere given to the college last week by Mrs. Cullen in accord- ance with her husband's wishes. The collection, which numbers about 2500 volumes, will prove a valuable addition to the Iib_rary, as it includes ?1any rare and highly pnzed works. It consists altnost entirely of historical and other prose literature, Byron and Shadespeare being the only poets repre- sented, and Darwin's \Origin of Species,\ and \Descent of Man.,\ the only scientific works. The collection is especially strong in New York State history, there being 12r volumes of infor- mation concerning the counties and principal cities of the State. It includes also a fine assort- ,men~ of works on general An1erican history, particularly that of the Southern States and the Revolutionary period. There are tnany bio- graphtes, atnong which are several of Jackson and Jefferson, showing that Judge Cullen took an especial interest in these characters. English history is well represented by sets of such works as Hume, Smollett, Hughes, and 14 volumes of Lingard. There is also BuTton's \ History of Scotland\ in seven volumes. Another special feature of the library is the number of works relating criminology; Burke's \Celebrated Trials;\ four volumes of the ''Newgate Calendar,\ and many others.. A few more of the tnost noteworthy sets are the ''Gallerie du Palais Pitti ; \ 19 volumes of Jonathan Swift's works; 32 volumes of Cooper; 34 vohunes of Voltaire ; Froissart's '' Chron- icles;\ 22 volutne's of De Foe; Ho1me's writings in 14 volut11es ; \The Narrative and Cri tial History of the United States ; Edition de Duxe in eight volumes; two volumes of the ''Letters of Junius,\ and Burton's \ Anatomy of Melancholy.\

Peter McPartlon, ex- 1900, has been appointed house physician for the Ellis Hospital for the corning year. Together with five other fellow members of this year's graduating class of the medical·department, he recently tried the com- petitive examination for the position and handed in the tnost creditable paper. The annual spring track subscription was taken at the college meeting Monday morning. In all, something over $250 was pledged.

As ADVOCATED in a forn1er issue, the plan of 'varsity control of class base ball contests has been adopted by the managers of the respective classes. Two games have already been played, and the remaining contests are scheduled for the month. The scheme is comtnendable, and the students should turn out at the contests and give them active support. THE PRELIMINARY CONTEST for the ju11ior and sophomore oratorical prizes to be held in the chapel 11ext Tuesday evening should bring out a large uumber of contestants. The benefits to be derived from public speaking are too well known to be €numerated. Students should show their a]_)precia- tion of the ki11dness of the college in pToviding these contests. The prizes awarded at the final trial should be the point least considered. Men should try for the practice to be derived, and for the honor of the college, laying aside mercenary motives. UNION'S ATHLETES will meet the 36th and 37th Separate Companies on the college oval on Satur- day afternoon in a return contest. Every man on the team .should not only turn out every d\ay that remains but obey strictly the new training rules. Coach Weaver is doing his best to turn out a finished product)' and the team is improving rapidly • · under his guidance. The soldiers won the former n1eet by a very narrow margin, and it is to be hoped that close application to business on the part of the team, and hearty support from tbe student body will enable the boys in garnet to turn the tables and score a double defeat. The meet will at least accomplish one excellent result-the n1en will have had so~e actual experience in fight- ing for the lead when they arrive at Geneva on Decoration Day. THE CoNCOR.DIENSIS takes pleasure in present- ing to its readers in this issue brief but comprehen- sive information regarding the class of 1860, which will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of its gradu- ation next June. Of all of the classes which Old Union has sent forth, none, perhaps, has included n1ore promin€nt and loyal alumni than '60. In spite of the unusually large size of the class, the editors have succeeded in obtaining information concerning every man, and a copy of this issue is sent to every living member. In behalf of the undergraduates we take pleasure in extendi11g to all '60 tnen a cordial invitation to revisit the old college and participate in the festivities of com- mencement week. In our next issue we hope to be able to present a resume of the alumni of '70 and '7.5, and to that end request information concerning members of those classes. INTE~COLLEGIATE. The U niver£ity of Chicago has closed a con- tract with the University of Pennsylvania under which the Quakers will play a return football game in I 901.

CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, TERMS: $2.00 per Year, in Ad vance 10 C€nts Address all cotnmunications to THE CONCO:RDI- ENSIS, Box 213, Schenectady, N. Y. Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 4:14: State Street, Schenectady, N. Y. As ADVOCATED in a forn1er issue, the plan of 'varsity control of class base ball contests has been adopted by the managers of the respective classes. Two games have already been played, and the remaining contests are scheduled for the month. The scheme is cotnn1endable, and the students should turn out at the contests and give them active support. THE PRELIMINARY CONTEST for the junior and sophomore oratorical prizes to be held in the chapel next Tuesday evening should bring out a large number of contestants. The benefits to be derived from public s-peaking are too well known t() be enumerated. Students should show their appreda- tion of the kindness of the college in providing these contests. The prizes awarded at the final trial should be the point least considered. Men should try for the practice to be derived, and for the honor of the college, 1 ay ing- aside mercenary motives. UNION'S ATHLETES will meet the 36th and 37th Separate Companies on the college oval on Satur- day afternoon it1 a return contest. Every man on the team sh()uld not only turn out every day that remains but obey strictly the new training rules. Coach Weaver is doing his best to turn out a finished product, and the team is improving rapidly I · under his guidance. The soldiers won the former · meet by a very narrow margin, and it is to be hoped that close application to business on the part of the team, and hearty support from the student body will enable the boys in garnet to turn the tables and score a double defeat. The meet will at least accomplish one excellent result-the n1en will have had so~e actual experience in fight- ing for the lead when they arrive at Geneva on Decoration Day. THE CONCORDIENSIS takes pleasure in present- ing to its readers in this issue brief but comprehen- sive information regarding the class of 1860, which will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of its gradu- ation next June. Of all of the classes which Old Union has sent forth, none, perhaps, has included n1ore prominent and loyal alumni than '60. In spite of the unusually large size of the class, the editors have succeeded in obtaining information concerning every man, and a copy of this issue is sent to every living member. In behalf of the undergraduates we take pleasure in extending to all '60 1nen a cordial invitation to revisit the old college and participate in the festivities of com- mencement week. In our next issue we hope to be able to pres€nt a resume of the alumni of '70 and '7 5, and to that end request information concerning members of those classes. INTE~COLLEGIATE. The University of Chicago has closed a con- tract with the University of Pennsylvania under which the Quakers will play a return football game in 1901. The Maroons will meet the Pennsylvania eleven this year on October 27 at Philadelphia.

Last Saturday afternoon occurred the triangu- lar athletic tt.teet on the college oval, in which Union's athletes m.et the track teams of the two local military companies, \E\ and ''F.,\ N. G. N.Y. No .college records were broken, hut very good time was made in some of the events, considering the condition of the track. As in the indoor meet, Felthousen and Abell proved themselves to be excellent all-around men. Between thetn thirty-eight points were rolled up for Co. E. Aside frorn this there vvere many other interesting features. 'rhe hundred yard dash looked doubtful for Union \vhen Abell beat Davis in his heat, hut in the finals Kline ran a pretty race and won frotn Abell by fully four feet. The 120 yard hurdles was one of the best races of the day. Griffith and 0. B. Wells were neck and neck until the last hurdle, when the Union man was slightly in the lead. At this point Wells unintentionally fouled him, and the judges awarded Griffith first place. Boorn showed up well in the dashes for a new man. He took third in the hundred and gave Felt- housen a close rub for first place in the 220. The weight events went to Union, as there was no one to enter from either of the companies. Following is a summary of the events and points: 100 yard dasb-Fitst, Kline, (Union) ; sec- ond, Abell, (Co. E) ; third, Boorn, (Union.) Tin1e, 10 2-5 seconds.

THE C'ONCORDIENSIS. 190'0 CLASS SONG. AIR : Church in the Wildwood. There's a college in the valley of the Mohawk, Where our thoughts will turn for many years to come; Where we studied, lived, and forn1ed the closest friendships; The college which to us has been a home. CHORUS. Then come my classmates, Sing of the college that we honor, Your tribute of love to her bring; And in praise of our dear Alma Mater Let 1900's voices ever ring. Laurels plenty there have been to crown our foreheads, Honors rich are our reward at this day. Yet fr01n these we now must turn to life's stern duties, Each from here must take his own chosen way. \On the whole,\ \:Have you read the full assignment?\ \We know nothing that is absolutely true.\ ''Th-a-t wi-11 d-o,'' ''This day week, '' '' 0 rna conscience, '' \In the words of the booke\ we say adieu. Stately pine, looking down on Idol ghastly, College brook, woods, and garden, now farewell, May our lives declare the love we bear our mother, And her glories to all coming ages tell. CAMPUS NOTES.

IN THIS ISSUE we take pleasure in presenting a list, as complete as possible, of the metnbers of the classes of '70 and '75, and copies have been sent to all those whose names are included in the same. It is our hope in publishing these lists to arouse such interest on the part of the tnembers of these several classes as to inspire thetn with the desire to be present, or, rather, to secure their ' of a successful meet. Cornm·ittees have been ap- pointed to provide for the entertainment of the ath- letes while at Union, and we trust that the student body will take an unusual interest in the meet. The Concordiensis voices the sentiment of the undergraduates and college when it extends tothe teams of the preparatory schools a most cordial welcome to Old Union's .classic grounds. THOUGH UNION was victorious in last Saturday's athletic meet and the work of the team was in gen- eral satisfactory, still it must be apparent to all that if we expect to make a creditable showing at Geneva. on May 30, there must be a great deal of improvement. In more than one event a lack of training was evident, and some of the men were not nearly up to their form of a year ago. Now this should not be the case. The track athletes of the college never had better opportunities for train- ing than are afforded this spring, and the students in subscribing liberally toward that branch of athletics at least have a right to expect faithful training on the part of the track men. The with- drawal of Colgate from the Hobart meet leaves only Union and Rochester to compete with the Genevans, and as Rochester expects to send only a small team, Union is left as Hobart's tnain rival. Now we are perfectly C()nfident of our ability on the track. but no victory was ever yet won without training, and therein lies the only means of im- proving our chances of victory in the league contest on Decoration Day. It seems to us that this mat- ' presence at our commencement reunion in June. captain of the track team, but by every tnan in col- In our next issue we shall publish a list of the class lege who is trying for the team. ter is worthy of s01ne attention, not only by the of '80, and infonnation is earnestly desired from all who may be in possession of any facts of inter- est concerning any metnbers of this important class. DuRING the present week Union will entertain preparatory school athletes from various points in this and adjoining states. Union students should welcome the men heartily and entertain thetn in the best possible n1an1ier. A large number of schools have entered and there is every indication And now the gladsome spring is here, With budding leaves and wind and rain. Thick fleecy clouds of dust appear, And the spring poet strives in vain To tell us of the ''month of May, When nature dons her garb so gay.\ 'Tis false, 0 bard, for don't you know Last week we had a fall of snow?

THB ®NG<!JRDIBNSIS. VoL. XXIII. UNION COLLEGE, MAY 23, 1900. No. 27. THE PREPARATORY SCHOOL MEE~ In a Pouring :Qain Utica Free Academy Carries Off the Honors. The third annual invitation inter-scholastic meet held Saturday under the auspices of the Union College A. A., though pulled off under tnost unfavorable conditions, was a success. A drizzling rain that started the night before, poured down the entire 111orning and put a thick layer of n1ud over the entire track by half- past two, the appointed time for the assembling of the young athletes. It was deemed in1 prac- ticable to call off the contest for tnanv of the teams had come from a long distance. Drenched and chilled by the cold, unceasing drops ; plastered by the clinging tnud, that flew right and left with ever.Y footstep ; neither un- nerved or disheartened ; the some-day collegians, splashed through it all, fighting for the lead as becomingly as did ever men who fougl1t for laurel wreaths. Retnarkabl y fast titne was made, under the existing circutnstances; while in the field events, despite the soggy turf and cinders, three records of fonner meets were broken. Pluck and endurance carried the tnen through the day while pron1pt systematic man- agetnent hastened the happy time for doffing the light track uniform. Not a few of the men showed thernsel ves to be cotning stars. Sherman, of the Utica Free Academy, deserves a great deal of credit for his perfonnances in the two long runs. His tin1e, 2 :r6, in the half, is particularly good. Fran-- chot, of Wesbninster School, proved hin1self a high jutnper of no tnean ability. Rogers, of Trinity School, is no doubt a coming tnan in the weights. Horace Mann School has a plucky litth: sprintery in Mills, who should do tnuch better in the future. Thomas, of l3lake School, is a clever tnan in the high hurdles and may sotne day equal his brother's perfonnances at Yale this year.. Freeman, of St. John's School, has a very pretty forn1 in :the pole vault. rfhe I-Iudson High School representative in the bicycle races, J\1ont Ross, had little difficulty in tnaintaining a good lead in both his races. He certainly outwitted his opponents by riding a low-geared wheel with half-filled tires. The races throughout were exciting and closely fought. The finish in the quarter was very pretty. It was any man's race right up the stretch. 1~he bicycle races afforded the n1ost atnusement of the afternoon, many a rider finding himself without warning on his back in the n1ud.

COLLEGE MEETING. At the college tneeting, Monday, a scheme was proposed and adopted to place the musical association under an advisory board similar to that of the athletic board. The board will be composed of three alutnni n1embers, who shall hold office for one, two and three years respec- tively, and a new member, to be elected each year. Frederick W. Hild, '98, addressed the meet- ing on the alun1ni coach comtnittee's work, and announced that a football coach would be pro- cured next fall. He suggested a scheme, which was adopted, that a new member to the coach committee be added each year frpm the gradu- ating class. Edwin J. Speh, Hamilton, 1901, was a guest at the Alpha Deltha Phi House last week.

THE CONO;ORDIENSIS. 7 UNION, 6 ; ~OCHESTEQ, S. Second League Victory for the Garnet. The we~trers of the Garnet played a pretty game last Friday, when they defeated t~e aggre- gation from Rochester University. Witbeck pitched another star gatne, and considering his disability fielded his position well. Parker did n()t play in his usual form. He tnissed two flies, and has two errors put down to his account. Cook played a very good game. The Rochester men evidently came to Schenectady confident of victory and it looked as if their confidence was justified, for up to the fourth inning,..._ Union did not score. In the sixth inning, the visitors went up in the air, and Union took a lead that Rochester could not overcon1e. The sununary follows: ROCHESTER UNIV. A. B.

8 THE OONOORDIENSIS. ENTE~TAINMENT OP THE VISITING . trip with a great deal of delight. The Union alumni of Atnsterdatn were untiring in their efl:orts to make the affair a success and deserve tnuch praise for their work in that direction. ATHLETES. A reception vvas given the schoolboy guests the evening of the 1neet at Memorial I-Iall, which was handsornely decorated with ban- ners, Hags and bunting. Short- addresses of welcome to the visitors were tnade by President Raytnond, Dr. Ashtnore, Prof. Bennett and President Loucks of the senior class. 1.,he gold, silver and bronze tnedals were pt~esented by Prof. Pollard, and the banner to the tean1 scor- ing the tnost points-the Utica Free Academy- by Dr. Ashtnore. Announcetnent was also made that special tnedals \Vould be sent those men breaking U. C .. I. S. A. A. records in the pole vault, shot-put and running high jump. Light refreshtn·ents were served at the conclu- sion of the awards. rrhe tnen, while in Sche- nectady, were provided for by the several fra- ternities. Fraternity reception comtnittees n1et the visitors at all trains and took care of thetn, so far as possible, throughout the day. Despite the unpleasantness of the weather, Union's guests appeared to have thoroughly enjoyed their visit to Schenectady. THE MUSICAL CLUBS AT AMSTEQDAM The college Glee, Mandolin and Banjo clubs , gave a successful concert at Atnsterdatn last Friday evening, under the auspices of the Alun1ni Association of -that city. The audience was sn1all but enthusiastic and every nun1ber was vigorously applauded. One of the leading feature5 was '~ ]\ 1ac' s \ trick banjo solo which provoked unrestrainable 111 irth. After the con- cert the clubs adjourned to the Fort Johnstone Club, where dinne1· was served and dancing enjoyed until the last minute before the train left for hotne. Although the aqdience was not as large as tnight be expected, the concert vvas one of the best given this year. The leaders of the clubs certainly deserve great credit for their efforts to perfect the men in their various lines. Every one was greatly pleased with the reception given the clubs and will look forward to next year's CHANGES IN THE FOOTBALL QULES. The intercollegiate rules cotntnittee on foot- ball, con1posed of Robert D. \Vrenn of Hatv- ard, vValter Camp of Yale, Alexandor Moffatt of Princeton, Paul Dashiel of Annapolis, J. M. Dennis of Cornell and John C. Bell of Penn- sylvania, has completed the work of revising the rules which will govern football contests. The changes made are final. The two tnain changes tnade were the pro- hibiting of side-line coaching and attaching a new penalty for off-side play. In regard to the former, the con1mittee legislated \that in case of side-line coaching, not only shall the side coached be penalized at the discretion of the utnpire, but the nun1ber of men who tnay walk along the lines shall be litnited.\ As a further preventative of side-line coach- ing, it was decided, at the suggestion of Mr. Bell, to penalize the tean1 so ofiending by the loss of ten yards, so that under the new rules the teatn will retain the ball and lose ten yards, the down remaining the satne as it was at the time the foul was cotntnitted. If the tean1 guilty of side-coaching is playing on the de- fense, then the other side will be given ten yards and a first down. The ruling on off-side play was altered, so that the side guilty of ofl:side play shall be pen- alized ten yards instead of as fonnerly, losing the ball to their opponents. A penalty of ten yards was decided upon for interfering with tbe suc- cess of a play as in kicking a goal. The rule pennitting a teatn to lose twenty yards and retain the ball was revised so as to read \that in cases where this shall be done more than once during the gatne, the tean1 so doing shall lose possession of the ball.\ '97.-Louis O'Neil of Auburn was visiting friends on the hill last week.

President Raymond recently attended a meet- ing of educators, held at Columbia University, for the purpose of formulating plans regarding entrance exatninations for the colleges of the Middle States and· Maryland. The scheme for holding uniform entrance examinations by a central examining board was proposed last De- cember, but was referred to a sub-committee to draft a constitution and prepare rules. The re- port of the sub-committee, which provides for a Central Examining Board, with a Chairman, Vice-Chainnan, Secretary and Treasurer was adopted. 1.,he presidents of each college having an en- tering class of more than fifty metnbers shall be entitled to tnen1bership in the board. The studies shall include botany, chemistry, Eng- lish, Greek, Latin, French, mathematics, phys- ics and zoology. The report was somewhat tnodified at last week's conference but not es- sentially changed. THETA SIGMA DANCE.

CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, TERMS: $2.00 per Year, in Advance 10 Cents Address all communications to THE CONCORDI- ENSIS, Box 213, Schenectady, N. Y. Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Ohas. Burrows, Printer, 4:14: State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THE ANNOUNCEMENT that the Hon. Whitlaw Reid has consented to deliver the honorary chan- cellor's address at commencement this year should be a cause of grati :fication to everyone connected with the institution. The presence of the distin- guished editor of the New York Tribune at the closing exercises can not fail making them of unusual interest. A SUGGESTION was made at the college meeting one week ago that, in view of the fact that the pole on the Round Building dome was destroyed in a recent sophomore-freshman fight, those two classes should unite in replacing it. A small band of bold and daring sophomores accordingly lost no time in meeting the suggestion-not in its spirit but in its letter. The joke was a good one but has now grown old. Commencement is almost here, and it can not be fancied that any alumnus or vis- itor would much a<;lmire the sapling which 11ow sways to and fro over \Potter's Folly.'' 'f'he under classmen will, of course, do their duty in this matter. THE INDIVIDUAL record of every member of the class of '80 is given in this issue Gf the college weekly. Every available source of information has been drawn upon in an earnest effort to make these brief histories as up-to-date as possible. On publishing a sirnilar record of '60, two weeks ago, ' it was stated that that class is perhaps as distin- guished a group of men as has ever grad11ated from Union. It may be as truthfully said of '80 that no more loyal class has ever passed out through the old Blue Gate. Aided greatly by the earnest efforts of the late Robert Carter AleKander, class ties have been cl(')sely kept and class reunions re- markably weH attended. The college sends its most cordial greeting to every loyal member of the loyal class of '80, and feels that to assure them a hearty welcome in June on the twentieth anniver- sary of their graduation would be more than need- less. THE UNFORTUNATE conditions attending the pre- paratory school meet were more than counterbal- anced by the good spirit shown throughout the contest by the visiting men. Union's guests cer- tainly appreciated the discouragement which every Union man felt and did their best to lend zest to the occasion by true sportsmanlike conduct. The meet, at least, was a success. Professor Pollard, who engineered the affair, and Assistant Manager Stiles, who served as :fireman, both deserve the hearty thanks of the undergraduate body. The question has been raised as to whether the meet will bring a single mat1 to Union who would other- wise enter some other institution. Possibly it will not, but very possibly it will, if it is followed up in the proper manner. What is needed, and what can be had, at Union, is an athletic comtnittee which will search out promising freshmen. An opportunity like the present one Union can not afford to miss. The scheme is accomplishing good results at other college·s. Why should it not do as tnuch here?

THE CONCORDIEN:SIS. 11 THE PASSING of another intercollegiate orator- ical contest brings sharply to mind our need of a department of oratory. Union has no such depart- ment, and in this respect. most of the smaller American colleges are her superiors. The estab- lishment of a chair of oratory would satisfy a long-felt want. When we think of the attention paid, for instance, to the training of a man's body so that he may be capable of every exertion, it seems that the culti vati()ll of the intellect and voice in such harmony that the tongue could respond to a call at a mornent's notice is at leCl.st as much, if not more essel!ltial. The beneficial results of a thorough course of training in public speaking cannot be ex agger a ted. To be sure, it does not necessarily follow that all who take such a course of study become or.ators; but it does fol- low that practically all of thetn do acquire the ability to face an audience without undue embar- rassment, and to put with a certa~n directness whatever they have to say. Such a course would, we believe, appeal to Union College students. There is no reason why it would not. There are many reasons why it would-reasons too obvious to be mentioned here. Let us hope, then, that those who are interested in the work of the college may be brought to a consideration of this question. Individual Histories of Her Loyal Members. Robert C.

T -·. ·:. HE ®NG®RDIBNSIS. -VoL. XXIII. UNION COLLEGE, MAY 31, 1900. No. 28. A CURIOUS COLLEGE PUBLICATION. \The Shanghai Echo.'' Among the many exchanges received by The Concordiensis there is none which arouses greater interest than the St. John's Echo. This is a· bi-rno-r1thly published in Shanghai by the students of the college whose natne the paper bears. Yet not only is our interest aroused, for that is natural with a paper which cmnes thou- sands of tniles . and is published under such unusual conditions, but our adtniration as well, for we receive few neater and better edited exchanges. When the board of editors is examined and it is found to be made up of men who bear such names as Yuen, Tsur, Chang Woo and Dzurg, it is hard to realize that such an excellent pub- lication in English can be their work. And, from the an1ount of news published, they must be as efficient reporters as editors, for little seems to escape their notice, either in the col- lege at large or atnong their societies and alutnni. Their literary articles are given considerable prominence, and they certainly deserve it, judg- ing. both from· the subjects dealt with and the quality of the treatment given. National topics seem to be the favorites, and such subjects as \ The Alliance Between China and Japan,\ \ Are the European Nations Justified in Parti- titioning China,\ \Chinese Folklore,\ and \ Should the Municipal Authorities Establish a School for the Education of Chinese Children,\ are dealt with in a thorough and interesting tnanner. Religious and n1oral questions are also considered and in one of the issues, an excel- lent comparison is drawn between Confucianism and C1u·istianity. While carefully showing . the points of harmony between the two doc- trines, this article, by quiet suggestions, indi- cates. the superiority of Christianity over its opponent. An article headed the '' Value of Education\ is worthy of special mention for its thoughtful treatn1ent of the subject. The writer first deals with the theoretical side of the ques- tion and shows that the failures of Chinese edu- cators have been due to their inability to grasp the true character of education, that it is much more than the mere training of the memory. He then discusses the practical side and illus- trates and proves its value by experiences fro1n every day life. Another shows the evils of foot- binding and offers suggestions as to the most practical way of retnedying the evil. We may take these as illustrations of the spirit of the Echo, which seetns to be striving to raise both the moral and mental standards of the people. The literary department, however, is not given up entirely to dif;cussions of serious topics, for we find stories that one might think were copied from the magazines of our land but for their oriental flavor. Even the serial has found its way to that distant editorial room, and ex- pectation n1ust be .as pleasant to the Chinese as to Americans, iudging from the number of times \ to be continued\ appears in the few issues at hand. Later the best exatnple of fiction is a story on \ Spooks and Wonders in China.\ It defines them and tells of their haunts, their ap- pearings, their quarrels and the mediums through which they act, and gives many vivid illustra- tions of their power to create mischief. 1\he Echo has a well managed news depart- ment also, and is to be congratulated on its efficiency, although the items appear rather strange to an American college student. It is mentioned that as the proprietor and n1anager of a circus wished the students to visit their show, \the whole college, except a few, after receiving pennission from the President, went and enjoyed a cotnfortable look at the various parts of the exhibition.\ It is hard to imagine how a whole college could go to a circus and

THE· CONCORDIENSIS. 7 Un:ion.·Wins·Out in a Pitcher's Battle. A gilto-edge~ ~rticle in the way.of base ball wasjpqt·by both the Colgate and Union teams on the ca.m pus last Wednesday. Though the botne·· team scored more runs, yet the visitors phtyed an almost .errorles_s game. Colgate's aggr.ega.tion had great team work. Very few hits ·were. made off either pitcher. Arnold for Colgate, pitched an excellent gatne, though in pitching abilities he fell somewhat below Wit- beck, who.bas six men struck out to his credit. The .. game kept the spectators on edge from its. very start. Both nines got two men on bases several titnes only to see the next batter up fan out or send an easy infield grounder. Colgate executed a snappy double play in the middle of the gan1e.. The score: COLGATE. A.B. R. lB. S. H. P.O. A. E . .

Union defeated Middlebury in an interesting ga tne on the campus Saturday afternoon. The score was a decided change frotn the first game with the Vennonters. Neither side scored until the last of the third inning when Union chalked down five runs. In the fouith Middlebury sent two men across the plate; in tbe sixth, one tnore ; in the seventh Middlebury again scored two and Union wound up the eighth with two, making her total eight to Middlebury's four. Drake, the out of town twirler, pitched fairly good ball though he was hit hard at times. Witbeck put up another stellar performance, striking out eight men. Griswold held his own behind the plate and did some phenomenal base running. Parker in centre field, and Paige on first base, played good ball. The hom.e nine, on the whole, exhibited the best fielding game of the season. The summary : MIDDLEBURY. A.B. R. l:B. S. B. S.H. P.O. A. E.

8 THE CONOORDIENSIS. CLOSING CENTU:QY SONG. Air: \Juanita.\ Bright is the gleaming Of the sunset's golden glow, Its splendor streaming Where the zephyrs blow. 'Tis the vesper fading Of the century's last year, With grand fame pervading This old college dear. CHORUS. Union, old Union, Thy ,true sons we'll ever be. Union, old Union, Fare it well with thee. I11 fading glory Soft grows bright the scene so grand. Walls old and hoary In true splendour stand. See, it paints in golden Aln1a 111ater's glorious fame; Fame so bright and olden Speaks old Union's name. Soft night is .creeping O'er this scene so fair and bright; All earth seetns sleeping In the falling night. Is the night that's falling Night that ne'er shall greet the day? But in gloom appalling Reign eternally. No, gloom ne'er can veil Ahna mater's glorious fame, Nor time e'er fail To revere her name. See, the morn is breaking, Soft it tints the eastern sky, See, new life is waking, Life that ne'er shall die. Soft is the glowing Of the morning's gentle blush, In beauty g,rowing .By Aurora's brush. See, &he wreaths in glory All the earth and sky above, And these walls so hoary Brighter grovv in love. 'Tis the future's light Streaming from a cloudless sky; 'Tis the morning bright Of the day that's nigh. Day that means to Union Brightness more than tongue can tell. Though grand fa1ne she's won, Ages ~Shall it swell. Lp N. BROUGHTON, 19009 THE 1901 GAQNET. The announcement of the approach of this long awaited volume no doubt causes a wave of satisfaction to sweep over the cam:?'lltS. The regular titne of publication has invariably been in March, but this year, through vario-us appar- ent reasons, the editors have thought fit t() herald its forthcoming at a much later date. However, this does not in the least degree decrease the merits of the book, as many new features have been introduced, and the usual high standard has been maintained. In considering the contents of the present Garnet, it is safe to say that only favor.able crit- icism will be passed upon it. As in preceding years, there is much that has not changed, as in the matter of the faculty, fraternities, et<:., but in the display of originality there is a mal'ked de- parture frotn the rules set down by former Gar- nets. The cuts are an especial feature in this line. The r9or board has gone to the trouble and expense of securing new ~~nd better ones to substitute the old stand-boys that have graced the pages of Garnet for the past ten years. Among the many beautiful designs, there is a full-page picture of the Undergraduate Council that demands special attention. · Although the tnaterial for this picture came in at a late day, the editors in securing Austin's best efl'orts feel sure that it is a valuable addition. In regard to the literary\ m~tter, the. aim has been to touch on subjects dealing especially with the student in his leisure moments. Col- lege scraps, the undergr~duate banquet, and the witty discourse of Eli Perkins, find a place here. And then in the matter of '' grinds,\ the de·serv- ing alone, are taken note of; and the results truly show that the editors have not failed in their efforts to reach these \ deserving\ ()nes. On placing this volume in the hands of friends and fellow students, the editors believe that their work will meet with approval. There have been n1any obstacles in the way, and no doubt the board has been slow in removing- them ; but however that may be, the work is accom- plished, and passes into the hands of those capa- ble of judging of its merits and demerits.

THE OONCORDIENSIS. . . . - - . - ~ ' ' , . . . ' - . 9 INTER•CLASS MEET. Sophomores Victorious by a Comfortable Margin. The spring inter-class games held Thursday afternoon on the college oval resulted in a victory for the sophomore_s,. who scored forty points. The freshtnen and juniors tied for second place with twenty-eight points each. Aside from class interests the purpose of this meet was to determine which athletes should compose· the team to represent Union at the inter-col1egiate ' meet at Geneva on Me1norial Day. In the distance runs Broughton, I goo, ··and Hawkes, 1902, showed up in excellent form, and can doubtless hold their own with any run- ner in the league. Finnegan threw the hamme1· very well and ought to figure in that event on Decoration Day. Griffith ran a ver_y pretty race in the high hurdles. Captain Davis, owing. to a djsability, failed to compete in any events. Weed turned his ankle badly in the high hurdles and was cotnpelled to desist for the rest of the afte1·noon. The field events, especially the two jutn ps, appear to be the weak spots among the garnet clad athletes. This weakness is due more to lack of training than <?f 1naterial. The sumn1ary: 100 yard dash-Won by Kline, 'or; second, We11s, '03 ; third, Boorn, 1900. Tirne, 10 4-5 seconds. 120 yard hurdle-Won by Griffith, '02; sec- ond, Dunning, 'o2; third, Weed, 'or.

DECORATION DAY and difficulties arising from taking charge of the paper by the new manage- ment, have delayed this issue almost two days. Number 29 will be out, as usual, Wednesday morning. THREE DEFEATS for Union teams on one day is not a~ poor a record on reflection as at first sight. Second place in the Geneva meet, and two trounc- ings by Dartmouth at Albany is, in short, the Gar- net's athletic history of Memorial Day, 1900.\ · The men put up a plucky struggle in the state inter- collegiates, scoring forty .. eight points to Rochester's sixty-one and Hobart's eighteen. But two-men·out of the fourteen failed to earn their· U ~ The'J)layers at .Albany unquestionably gave a poor·exhibitiott of the national game, yet · the strength of their opponents and the time-honored ''oft· day '' ·story must command~ some ·att~ntion.

Make. the men feel we are behind them on the coming trips and. no one need feel the possi bllity of a toboggan· seas.on 's close. L.ack of spa:ce prevents further accounts .this week. THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY of '90's commencement will be celebrated in June. In accordance with this paper-'s attempt to sti-mulate interest in class reunions this. year, a brief account of the lives, since graduation, of the members of the youngest decennial class; is given in this issu.e. Much diffi- culty bas been met ·in securing these records .. Prof. John Ita Bennett has given the editors the majoF• part of· the information. In collaboration with Frederick E. Hawke-s, '90, he has been engaged,·in an efiort to locate all his fellow-class- mates, and· secure, 'if possible, their attendance at the· coming reunion. Tbe attempt has met with but little success as yet, though it is hoped that the' account in this paper, reaching as it does every '90 man's holne that is known, will be of some service. Correction of any mistake that may have crept into the histories or new information will be gladly received by either member of the committee. The college hopes to greet in June every '90 =man who can possibly· :find time to visit her. TliE 1901 GARNET :BoARD, after a year of mis- management and lack of unity and interest, announce the· appearance of their volume. The query, \When is the Garnet coming out?\ has justly developed into a jest, and no one ought to understand it more than the editors of that board. The appearance of the book at so late a day is unprecedented, and can only be accounted for by placing it to the failure·of certain members of the board to do their share of the work. This need not be em-phasised, as it is known to the students that the majority of the editors have done nothing. Tbis ,course .. of action is. sufficient to warn future Ga:-rnet.·boar~~s- in the ·carrying on of their work. The editors ought to undetstand the duties devolv-

THE OONC'ORDIENSIS. 11 ing upon them and ac£omplish them assiduously. The 1901 Garnet board did nothing of the sort, and, in fact, the book grew as by a natural pro- cess. This, however, does not reflect upon the me·rits of the book, yet it is necessary to und.er- stand that unless there is proper management, there cannot be the success that would otherwise be expected. A SJ;NCERE FEELING of regret must fall upon every undergraduate when he learns of the coming departure from Union of John W. H. Pollard, to prosecute his studies in his chosen profession. To those who have known him during the past three years, who have witnessed his efforts toward the upbuilding of student athletics and have felt his ' kindly, cheerful sympathy, his absence will create a void which cannot soon be filled. In his first two years on the hill, Instructor Pollard, besides carrying on his regular work, coached two track teams and two victorious elevens, managed a suc- cessful minstrel show, inaugurated the inter- scholastic meet at Union and. had entire super- vision of two such contests. In this, his third year, through pursuing and creditably passing up the freshman year at the Medical Department, conducting his classroom and gymnasium work, he has again coached the football team and taken charge of another interscholastic meet. Every bit of Instructor Pollard's outside work for the col:- lege has been- given gratuitously and in a true self- sacrificing, sportsmanlike spirit. Nothing but the sincerest good wishes of Union men for their coming life go with oQ.r athletic instructor and his young wife on their leave-taking from ''Old Union.'' OBITUAQY. 1 ~\ Lansing T. Vedder, M.D., died on May 13. Dr. Vedder received his college training at Old Union and in 1881 took his degree from the Albany Medical college. His classmates were the ·-Hon. Charles C. Duryea, M. D., and the late Dr. E. P. VanEpps. The funeral services were held from the Masonic Temple and later from the Reformed church at Niskayuna, Dr. Vedder'·s native village. CHI PSI· .DANCE.: The members- of the Chi Psi fraternity gave their annual dance last Friday e-vening at Yates' Boat House. A most enjoyable time was had by all present. The hall was attractively decorated with the fraternity colors, purple and gold, and the spacious balcony made a pleasant retreat after the dances. Everybody seemed to enter into the spirit of the occasion and dancing was continued until the early hours of the .morning. Among those present from out of town- were~ Misses McClellan, Cam bridge; Payn, Leggett, Carnell, Burlingame, Golden, Albany; Rog~rs, Sandy Hill; Stover, An1sterdam; Maybery, Stnith College.
