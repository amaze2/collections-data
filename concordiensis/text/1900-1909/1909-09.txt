:.: THE CONCOR:DJE·NSIS VOL. 'XXXIII. UNION COLLEGE, SEPTEMBER 25, 1909 No. 1 NORTHFIELD. Union's Delegati·on. During the last spring term several articles and notifications appeared in the CONOORDIEN- S'IS concerning Northfield~, a place wlhd·ch to the minds of most of the students of Union ·could have been a state of mind, an atmosphere, a' place, an :lray field, a pink tea-party, or a .prize fight. At least this deduction of their conception of it could easily have been drawn from what they said about it. And so now in the fall term after a vacation of three months we print an account of a ten da:·s· vacation at Northfield so that the fellows may have something tangible from whiclh to draw id~as of Northfield. The past summer, from July 2d to 11th, the Union delegation from our College Christian As- sociation spent at East Northfield, Mass. There was one from 1909 and there were three from 1910, two from 1911 and six from 1912. Then, too, Orrin T. Cocks, Union, '98, was with us and greatly helped in all ways. So tJhere were thirteen of us living in [our tentst wUh four cots apiece, on a bluff overlooking tile beautiful Connecticut valley. We \got in wrong\ right away as far as ath- leti-cs was concerned. At Northfield they have a baseball tournament made up of the teams from the several college delegations. Well, the Union delegation w1as all ri,ghrt as far as quantity went. but woefu~y deficient as far as quality·. But we all knew the rules anyway {or thought tJhat we did) and so entered the tournament. Saturday after- noon, after the morning's addresses, at last aF- rived, and, the doug1hty Union tea~m went down te defeat at the hands of- Haverford College to the tune of --. Well Td like to tell you but you would not believe that so big a score could be rolled up against any team in the United States in three innings. Well, of course, with all our fun th1ere were tht_j Bible and Missionary Study classes and auditor- ium addresses in the mornings and the \Round Top\ meetings and auditorium addresses in the eyening. And they were wonderfuly good and some of .us have had an experience that we will never forget. And what did it all mean to each pne of us? For ten days we were associated with about 600 college men from all ove-r the world. Wlhat a broadening effect it had upon each one of us! What a new :wealth and depth of ideas and prin- ciples we absorbed! And this is only one side of our College Asso- ciation work. Great things are being planned for the winter and tt.ey are for all gratis. Let every fellow get into all the college activi- ties that he can ;:tnd s'how his appreciation of be- ing a Un~on man. Let us all remember that the more we -put into life the more we will get out , •t 0 .. l . THE F.RESHMAN CLASS. 108 Mem·bers Reg.istered. The freshman class registration :has not as VE;lt been ·completed. At •pre-s,ent t:htere are 109 men 1n the class but i! is expected that the 1 -final number will be about 115. This year the entrance require- ments were very much more severe than previous., ly, which accounts for the rather small numb€r.. '. - ' There were in the beginning over 140 applica~ Hons but some of tllese were not admitted bPcause of their certifi.cates bein insufficient. As a re- sult of the examinations there 1 have been more than twenty men dropped. But this fact makes the class one that is perhaps strong·.er than pre· vious· years. Following is tt.e list of students in the class of 1913: Clifford Arnold, Peru. Horace F. B~~hea, Dillon, -S, C. · George W. Blodgett,\· Jr., R,ushvilJ.e. Raymond H. Bond, Washington, D. C.

C., 1 had made a gift of $75,000 to the college for the endowment of the department of philosophy. To this amount was added $25,000, which was subscribed by the alumni, and the <>onditions of the gift of $100,000 from the General Educational Board were fulfilled. Mrs. Leavitt made the gift in memory of her father, tlbe late Rev. Mr. Spencer of Brooklyn, who was a member of the class of 1824. He was the author of \A Pastor's Sketches\ and other well-known works. Coming on the heels of the Carnegie gift of $100,000 and at the beginning of the administra- tion of Dr. Richmond, a most successful future for the college is forecasted. The endowment of the college is now over $4·00,000 and in addition to tJhis an active campaign for funds for the erec- tion of a new gymnasium is in progress. The gift will doubtless do much to strengthen the academic side of the college and will totally destroy the fears of many that the engineering department would eventually triumph at the ex- pense of the older branch. It is understood that about $35,000 of Mrs. L'~avitt's gift has already been paid in. No changes in tJhe department of philosophy are ex- pected before ne~t year, but at that time the tEaching force will probably be enlarged and sev- eral additions made to the curriculum of the de- JUNIOR CLAS1S O·F'FICERS. partment.

I 12 THE CONCORDIENSIS THE FACUL TV .ABROAD. During the past summer five memb~ws of Union's faculty spent the vacation abroad. They are .Dean Ripton, Professor Hoffman, Professor Ashmore, Professor McKean and Dr. Ellery. Dean and Mrs. Ripton sailed for Antwerp June 26 aboard the Vaderland. From Antwerp they as- cend3d the Schelt River for fifty miles and made a short stop at Brussels. Dean Ripton is entf.tu- sias ~ic over the trip up the Rlhine. He says that to ascend the Rhine is preferable to sailing down, for in that way the scenery is increasingly beau- tiful as Switzerland is approached. The la!3t tlme the Dean was broad he descended the R·hine. On the way llP the R!hine the Dean and his wife stopped at St. Goar, where is one of the largest ruins on the river. In .Switzerland they visited L3.ke Lucerne and .as,cended Jungrau. In England they visited Stratford, Oxford, War- wick among other places and spent somB time in London before sailing for- home. Professor ·Hoffman, with his family s9.iled the rr:iddle of June for Geneva, wh~re he represented \Cnion University at the 350th anniversary i! t'he founding of the University of Geneva, which was held July 1-14. At the same time took place tte commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the b:rth of John Calvin. Both of these were memor- able events and attracted world-wide attention. Attend\ing the :anniversary of the founding of L:niversity of Geneva were delegates from all parts of the world, including repr~sentatives of \Fnion along with many other American univer- sities. The higher educational institutions of Asia, Japan and China were represent~d and three delegates from the University of Cairo, Egypt, ?..t- tended. President Schurman of Cornell spoke for Amer- ican universities and Professor Walker of YPJe gave one of the principal addresses on .John c~l­ vin. It was generally admitted at one of the s~ssions that Professor Walker's book on John Calvin, publis'hed some four years ago, is th~ b<~st ever written on the subject. Ex-Governor Gu~Jd of Massachusetts represented U..:e Unitarians of America and also gave an extended address. In speaking .of Geneva and the University, Pro- fessor Hoffman said: \Geneva is one of the most attractive cities in the world and abounds in edu- ca-tional institutions. The University draws its students from all over the world, half of them, at least, coming from foreign lands, especially from Russia and Bulgaria. It is an institution open to yohng women· as well as to young men and has between 11400 and 1,50'0 students in attendancEl,\ Followig the Geneva activities Professor Hoff- nlan spent some time at the University of Heidel- · burg, w:here he was formerly a student. He states t!hat the University has ct.~.anged greatly i:n the past ten years, having increased in gen- eral equipment and number of students. A new library has been completed recently and is con- sidered one of the finest in Europe. Later in his travels Professor Hoffman revisited Oxford University, another of the foreign institutions at which he has studied. He found here a large summer school in session, with: . an attendance of a bout 2,000 students. In speaking of )Oxford Professor Hoffman said: \In many particulars U1e University, although still very conservative, is endeavoring to adapt itself to modern needs.\ When in London, Professor Hoffman took grf:lat intnrest in the almost violent dis,cussion that wa.s going on in Parliament, concerning the annual buclget and he became very hopeful that the views of Lord Asquith ·concerning the method {)f levy- Ing the taxes for the support of t'!le governmPnt, v·ould finally prevail. During t~he trip, which lasted three months, .... Professor Hoffman and his family visited the principal cities of Italy and spent some time in Germany and France before going to England, from which country they took passage for ,A.1nerica. Professor Ashmore spent most of his time in England and Germany. He lef:t New York in the \Adriatic\ on the 24t'h of June and went straight to London to see his ·brother and other relatives. He then went to Bad-Nauheim, in G-ermany, by w.ay of Paris and Frankfort. After a month or more at ·Nauhei~m he returned to England by ·way of the Rhine and Belgium. I . I

I . f T'HE. CONCORD·IENSIS 13 At Frankfort· he saw the Parsifal dirigible bal- loon Jn acti:ori, but was not so fortunate as to see an .aeroplane in fllght. But the greatest man in Eu:rope this summer was not Herr Zeppelin, but Monsieur Ble:dot, the Frenchman, who first sue_ ceed€d in cross-ing the English Channel in an aeroplane. .Even the Wright brothers :Lad to take second place in the eyes of Europeans. Professor Ashmore went to the American A.m- bassad~r's reception given in London on the Fourth of July to all Americans who are in the metropolis on that date. He went also to the d.inn€r w~hich was given by the American Em- bassy Association for the · purpose of enlisting syrnpatl~y and co-operation in the matter of our very poorly equipped embassies at the various Eu11opean courts, the embassy which is situated in Victoria Street being unusually ·conspicuous for its dingy apartments and general inadequacy. At this dinner the best speech was made by Mr. Sanuel Gompers, the well-known labor leader, whose eloquence on this occasion quite entraneed the four hundred A:merioans present. Prof. Ashmore says t~hat he saw evidence in England of a decided fear of Germany and Amer- ica. wherever trade was concerned. He. found it among business men of all grades, es·pe.cially in what is known as the \City''' of London~w·hich is analogous to our \Wall Street.\ But nowhere could he find any indication of a fear -o1. invasion. The Englishman is as sure of tlf~, effica-cy of his :fleet to-day as ever he was, but he insists that the two-power standard must be maintained. Prof€ssor Ashmore- was told by a prominent mem- ber of Parliament and of the British cabinet, tliat the possibility of an invasion of En-gland by Germany had no real ·foundation in the minds of the :British public_, and was not- seriously enter- tai-ned by anyone connected with either o'f the two :political parties in the government. Dr. Ashmore also m·ade some inquiries on tile subject of the sale of liquor in Great Britain and was informed by business men ·1n the \City\ tlhat .. the revenue derived by the governm·ent from this source was decreasing at the rate or tt.ree mil- lions sterling per annum. \ Dr. Ashmore was unable to, see, so he said, that Germany was over-governed, as some Amer- icans appear to think. On the contrary, tne regu- larity and order which is ·character1suc or Ger- man institutions in general suggest at onc.e a combination of .freedom with prote-ction of which many other countries on both sides of the At- lanti-c may well be envious. During the sum·m(lr Professor and Mrs. Mc- Kean made a tour of the ·capitals, taking in IDDllY of the smaller place~ of interest enroute. They visited Berlin, Dresden, Nuremburg, l\1unic~l, IrJ.usbruck, Tyrol, Venice_, Florence, Genev!l and places of lesser importance. React_ing Switzer- l~tnd they sailed down the Rhine, visited Paris ~nd London and took passage from Liverpool. At Brixle~, Austrian Tyrol, Professor an j M:·s. :M·cKean witnessed a ·production of the historiPa.l play \Andreas Hofer,\ w:hich was being given in rnen1ory <?f the death of Hofer, one hundred ye~us ago. It is a peasant play and was ~iven in a lftrge paviliqn . built wi~h barn-li~e. architectUl'e .. The Brixlegg plays are famous throughout Ec.rope and attract many American as wPU · ns European tourists. Dr. and 1\Irs. Ellery returned thi'3 fall from a six months' stay abroad. Most of the tim~. they were at the Universi.ty of Berlin, where Dl'. F1l- kry took up a course of study. While at th~ 1Jni; vfrsity 'he --was closely associated with Profes~or Nernst. During his stay at Berlin Dr. Ellery investigated . . the work of the Jg,rge technical school at Char- lo~teburg, a vicinity, where tee:1.nical chemistry is E-xtensively· taught.

s ' ·~ ; THE CoNCORDIENSIS ( vot. XXXIII. UNION COLLEGE, SEPTEMBER 29, 1909 No.2 NEWS· A.BOUT THE GYMNASIU·.M The following is a letter recently received from c. L. Mead, '09, •to let the students know what is actually being done in the ~·ork for the new gym. This letter is an encouraging one and will be read with interest by .all. Sault Ste. Mlarie, Mich., Sept. 17, 1909. Editor Goncordiensis, .Schenectady, N. Y. Dear Sir-It has occurred to me that the follow_ ing facts in ·connection with the progress of the gymnasium project will be of interest to the stu- dent body. You may publish them as you see fit. Since ·college closed in ·June, Potter and I have been able to see personally between two and three hundred Alumni. Of this number but three have refused to do sof!1ething to help ·the project along. It has happened that the larger num·ber of men seen have been members of the more recent classes. These subscriptions have averaged some- thing over $50 per man, in many c::tses entailing great sacrifice on the part of the subscribers, thus duplicating to a large extent the spirit shown in the college meeting of last December. The encouragement met with on all sides seems to point to the certain success of the project. The Alumni in the Western cities are at the present time being seen personally by enthusia•stic gradu- ates of their locality who have kindly volunteered for the work. The Alumni. of the more isolated towns have been, to a very large extent, written to personally, and there is every reason to believe that the. res_ponses fr·om these will be most satis- factory. I am planning to leave for Duluth the end of this week and see the Alumni there and in Minne_ apolis, St. Paul andMilwaukee, meeting Potter in Chicago about the 26th of this month. In the meantime he is seeing the Alumni in Nebraska, the eastern part of K!ansa•s, St. Louis and Illinois. After Chicago has been gone thru we are planning to gradually work back East, covering southern Michigan, northerN Indiana and Ohio. From there we .e.xpect to com:e to Schenectady and make at- rangem·ents to receive the first payments on sub- S•criptions which are due the first of N·ovember. Hon. W. T. Foote, '85, has shown much interest and enth us.iasm in the project, and as he is a man of considerable mreans, this is a source of much encouragement. Too much credit cannot be given to the untiring energy of Professor Opdyke and Dr. MacComber, who have been behind us every minute. Pre,sident Richmond, too, has given us every possible aid, as has ·ur. Barnes and several other members of the faculty. We are meeting with enthusiasm from the Alumni on every hand, and I believe that June, 1912, will ·see the new Gym completed, or at least well tinder way. It might be well, for the. benefit of the present Freshman class, to publish the printed matter contained inside this letter. Sincerely yours, C. L. MEAD, '09. As suggested by the last sentence in the above letter, we take the op·portunity to print the matter which is printed on the letter paper as sent to all the Alumni in request for aid in this movement. \ A GREAT GYMNASIUM FOR UNION.\ The Gymnasium Project in a Nutshell. vViHY-Union's present gymnasium was one of the :first college gymnasiums built in America. It was constructed when modern ideas of physical training and development were practically un- known, and was intended to accommodate per- h9.ps one hundred students. At the present time it is not only far inferior to the gymnasiums of other colleges of Union's size and standing, but it is also inferior to the gymnasiums of most :first_ class preparatory schools. ILis a s·ource of shan1e to every Union man and to every friend of the

\ I I l I \ \: \: I 'I ; ~ ' l' ' 1 ! ' ~ I : ' ' ' I . I ' I ! ' G THE CONCORDIEN8IS college. It is one of the greatest handicaps to be · Room are to be lined wi tli bricks which are to overcome in securing new students. The development of the body as well as the mind has come· to be recognized as of vital im- portance in a college education. The opportunity for systematic physi·cal exercise is at the present time very inadequately provided for at Union. This is a se.ri·ous condition, and it is due entirely to ·the lack of proper facilities-which only a mod- ern gymnasium would ·secure. A college should by no means ·be advertised by its opportunities for physical development or its athletic prowess, but at the same time a college, nowadays, can ill-afford to ignore these things. Men who are choosing colleges prefer those where all sides of their lives are going to find the best expression. HOWI~The Union College Gymnasium Associa- tion has been organized for the purpose of provid_ ing for Union's greatest present need-a new Gymnasium. It is the result of a student move- ment in which the undergraduates started a Gym- nasium fund by subs·cribing the sum of nearly nine thousand dollars. This is an average of about $30.00 per man. M~any of these subscrip- tions mean much real sacrifice and hard work. Two members of the Class of '09 have been ar;- pointed to make a systen1atic canvass of all the Alumni of the college to secure additional sub_ scriptions to the fund, until it reaches the sun1 of $100,000-the necessary am·ount to complete the project. As far as practical the Alumni will be seen personally and the remainder will be asked to subscribe through the mail. The organization was completed and the can- vass begun in June, 1909. There are about 2,300 Alumni-·more than half of whom will te seen personal1y. In order that ·the r;roject may suc- ceed, the average subscription rer Alumnus must reach $50.00. There are many, perhaps, who cannot afford to meet this average, but there are also many more who can well afford to give considerably more than this amount. Each Alumnus is urged to do all that he possibly can, in order to make up for those who fall short. The walls of the Trophy bear the nam.es and classes of the ·Contributors. These bricks are to be soJ.d .at $5 p-er brick. A systematic canvass of the Alumni of Union College has never been m·ade. Heretofore, contri- butions for the li:PbuHding of the College have been made by the few rather than the many. Uni,on's new Gymnast um is to be built by all of her sons, working togeth,er. WHERE---1Action bas been taken looking toward the landscaping of the campus as a whole by corn_ petent architects. Consequently the exact location of the Gymnasium building is at present unde- termined. It is pro·bable that the College Pasture will te chosen as the site·. ·wherever the new Gymnasium may be situated, however, provision will be made for the later ·COnstruction of a thor- oughly modern Athletic Field \\ ithin a convenient distance. WHEN-If the plans of the Association mate- rialize, as there is every reason to believe they will, the new Gym nasi urn will be completed by September, 1912. It will be a thoroughly modern building, amply able to accommodate five hun dred students. It will contain a large exercise hall, running track, plunge, etc., and will provide room for Alumni dinners and other social functions. In short, it will be a building of whi-ch Union may be justly proud and will be a fitting example of Union's progress.

In the article on the present endowment of the College, as printed last week, the statement was made that the fund is $400,000, which is incorrect. The endowment is $400,000 more than it was four years ago, and ahout $800,000 in all at present. ,'' ~ ..

Monday's coUege meeting was probably onP of the most important of the fall term. Prof. Opdyke reported for tlie \gym\ committee; the announc-e- ment of the ''lJ\ track awards was made; and the freshnl~n rules committe gave its report. Pr::>f. Opdyke gave a short sketch .of the worl{ done by Messrs. Mead and Potter during the sum- n1er. Immediately after the -close of .coll0g:e the Alumni in this city were canvassed and only one c,r two refused to contribute. Also at commence- ment cards were sent out to Alumni reminding them of the plans for the \gym\ and asl~ing for their support. The middle of August, the cnm- mittee started out again. Mead w·ent throug-h ;viichigan and Minnesota and so around. to Chi- cago. Potter canvassed from Omaha to St. Lo 1 T}S, S'\\·inging around to Chicago from the south. F 10111 Chic::tgo the two will c<:>me East, reaching Schenectady some time next month and then can- \ ass Troy, Albany and t'he remaindo:r of ·~ew York Et::tte. Thus f:n, abJut two hundred Alumni have been seen personally. From tl:(;\se, subscrip- tions have been received av0raging about fifty dollars each so that the amount at prPSPnt p:edged by Alumni tota~s about $10,000. Su·bscrip- tion blanks have been sent out to Alumni who cannot be seen personally and the future of tl1e whole proposition looks bri~ht. The trustees have given permission to 'have the tuilding located in the pasture and ttLe p13.ns pom- n1ittee, of which Dr. \Mac\ is chairn1an, is con- stantly trying to improve the specifications of tlle building. Prof Opdyke also gave notices ~s to the p8.Y- ment of notes due on October 1. rr. D. Walser urged every man in college to ?.nb- scribe for the Concordiensis. Particulars as to the parade were announced by A. C. Potter, who also urged the fellows to support the Press Club as the club 'had done much to advertise Union last year, and should tave the su])port of the students. He also urged the freshmen to co:::ne out and try for the club. For the Glee Club, Smith stated that the sur- cess of the elu b depended upon the men being prompt and faithful at rehearsals. Slutter spoke for the Mandolin Club along the same line. President Cavert announced a campus meeting for Friday evening and urged it upon every man as a duty to get out and be ready for the game on :saturday. Fergu~on gave the report of tf..e AL .. ~etic Board on the \U\ awards for tracks work last year as follows: Track U-'09: Rankin, Finch; '10, Dennis, Paul, Walser, Lee (Law) ; '11, H.

It first appe::tred u1::on the cam- rus in 1874. The plare assigned to it was in tl·~e rear of the President's 'house, in the. cent(?r of an avenue- leading to the Nott Memori2l H~t1l, now used as the college library. It becan1e at once an object of great interest, and for a tin1e was trPat- ed with respect as a heathen god. One morning-, however, as the President was hurrying to c'oapel, he glanced at this foreign deity, stopped snd- denly raised his h::tnds and ex~laimed (so it is said), \Oh my God 1 \ During the night the ''g0d\ l1ad been painted white, or perhaps had only bPen whitewashed. At all events it had C'hanged color, but by whose hands was a mystery. \The Vand:-J· ism of College Students\ was tte subject of a 1Pc- ture delivered soon after in the collegP cha)1el. 'f'he offence was not repeated im~nediately, but a precedent had been established, and many yeqrs did not pass before midnight decorators were again at work. After that all attemnts to pro teet thB \grJven image\ were in vain, and in time it became as certain as sunrise that some morn- ing each year would find a freshly painted ''id0l\ back of the President's house. It might have been for tl:..e purpose of re.:noving fro1n the sight of every passer-by suc'h evidence of student 1~ w- lessness that, after the Powers--Washburn Memo- . rial Hall (the Red Building) was built, the Idol's sl1rine was changed to a hidden and nnfreq·.-e.1ted spot back of the hall.\ The foregoing appears in the fir:::.·. ~-·J\'\dme of ··union University,\ a history of Union publis'ned Slutter, Stewart, Ve·dder. 1911--~Micks, Atkin, Dowman, Honk, Robinson, some years ago by Dr. Rayn1ond. Tl:e undergrad· uates need no furt'her information in regard to the present use of this painted deity. The exact date, when the Idol and vicinity were made the scenes .of underclass contention, is not known, but the fact remains that this is one of the many distinctive customs of \Old Union.\ Brown, O'Connell. 1912-Fairbairn, Hardenbergh, Mann, W.

Notwithstanding the fact that thE;\ parade on Monday night was heil.d in the rnidst of a ste9.dY -Schenectady's J[reatest dru~ s-tore drizzle of rain, the spirit of the students was not fpaterially dampened. They had been plB.nning on Colle:ge F·ellows a very interesting and pleasant time and were aot to be easily done out of it. The.re wer~ about Dne :hundred and fifty or more of the students in line, attired in all s-orts of \evening dres-s\ mar-ching four abreast with the float of the \Idol\ leading t1le line. 'The worst part of the parade was the waiting beforE;\ the line started but dur~ ing that time they amused the.:nselves with song-s and cheers so that th.e rain was scarc~ly l_eeded. And all thP. way fro~n Jay Street to the par'1~ th~ We Want You to Know Quinn's- It's the leading drug store of Schenectady-a place where the best is offered at all times.

When t'he line reached the park, the students wer~ very glad to get the hot coffee ·and sandwitch0s which were provided through the \kindness\ of Caterer Goodman. Although the weather was very unfavorable and the students were in t'he rear of the line, it is ad- mitted that they made the hit of the whole ua- rade. W 1 EE 1 KLY CALE·ND·AR.

A lad there was, and he went to school (Even as me and you), But he called it a \college by rote and rule, So he started right in to play the fool, And he never took in t:hat dunce's stool Was waiting. to find a crew! A kid he was, but he led the van (Even a:s kidlets do), He whooped and he yelled like a bleacher fan, As brash: and as coid as an empty can; But he thought he was really a great big man, And leading the bunch,- a few! A dream he was, in his roaring socks (Even as all must see), · A dream that awakes and alarms and shocks, With sweaters tb.at howl for a block of blocks~ And charming the creatures of frills and frocks With swagger of deviltry. }. drone he was, like a lazy Turk (Even as one migiht guess), . He work'E'-d at hi·s play and played at his work, He settled his books with a slam and a jerk:o And lit on a thousand ways to shirk, A little bit less and less! A chump he was, with a cigarette (Even as flows the tide), \iVHh a cuss word ready and cash to hPt, But waitin<s a lesson he won't forget, vVl\en the wind is colrt and t 1 he rain is wet And the world will tan his hide!

It was written by tiuence the charaeter of tlile inhabitants or their George H. Daley, who is a Union man of the class mode of living? Contrast, with that in vi:ew, of 1892: Russia anl Switzerland. \The importance of a baseball team· or a foot- t.all team making a natty appearance on the field was called to my attention in a rather forcible way at a college baseball game last week. The team in () question played fast,\ snappy baseball, but the ef- fe-ctiveness and cleanness of the work were El- n'lost lost sight of be,c.a.use orf vh·e slovenJy appear- ance of the men on the field. Grace and free- dom in action are heightened to a large extent by the neatness with which a player is dressed, and there is absolutely no more excuse for sloppiness and carelessness in appearance than for sloppi- ness or carelessness in the execution of plays. lf a lot of men or boys offend the sight or any of the otfier senses of the onlookers they cannot ex- pect to have tte proper support and good feeling that are so essential to success. It matters not that the suits are soiled or old or slhow the marks of hard usage; there could still be neatness and a general natty appearance. This pleasing effect is lost, how·ever, wh1eu the trousers hang half wa/ bE=\tween knee and ankle, wfiile one man wears a jersey cut low in the neck, another one high and a third perlhaps a baseball shirt of a sweater. There are some, perhaps,. who may think that all this is much ado about nothing, but it is deserv- ing of the close· consideration of the manager and ·CaJptain of every football, basehall or v.ny other athletic team, whether in amateur or pro1ess10nal ranks. All the senses must be appealed to, and 'harmony and good taste on the field are quite as important as in the drawing room.\ Brilliant (?)-The forms of expression in con- versation might be eqected. To explain-The re- marks of a native of the plains of Russia would, perhaps, be rather flat, while the conversation of the inhabitants of peaked Switzerland might be pointed. A number of students from other ·colleges have eutered advanced classes at Union this fall. Reserved Reserved ' I l : ' . .'; :, ,, I. f. ! ·.: r
