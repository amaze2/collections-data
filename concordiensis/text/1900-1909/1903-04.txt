FOUR DAYS. ·1 First, Spring ·evolved a shimmering dream-Uke day, Like to an opal thro' low mists of rose, \Vith tints like plumage of a wood <love gray, When finally the warm sun melts the snows. And bordered it with violets that grew And ever deepened till at last were .seen The robes of Emperor of royal hue, And strewed it here and there with touch of green. Like grass up-springing by loosed waterways And blossoms like the snow, when glad sunshine Breaks thro' upon the tender clinging sprays That start from every new-born tree or vine~ She gave it voice and lo it softly spake Like note of wood thrush in the iwilight hour, And o'er it drew a veil of silver lake, And rainbow interspersing silvery shower. II The Summer brought a day of golden calm Above whose languid brow were cornflowers blue, All steeped in sunshine and the poppy's balm, And nature wore a drowsy golden hue. A veil like to the haze on far off hills Enveloped it. Its voice, the noonday drum Of Cushat dove hid deep that eats its fill In fields of snowy buckwheat, and the hum Of drowsy bees was like the lullaby That weary mother sings to 'Weary child, While cloudless heaven spreads its peace on high Like butterfly by yellow rose beguiled. III Red Autumn poured a crystal goblet high With wine and placed it in the hands .of day That laughed like to a woman joyously, And wore about its throat a jewelled ray Of amethyst. aad'. topaz and a glint Of shining rubies. And the earth was glad To see it drink the ,grape of fire kissed tint And see it g law -with life no longer sad. It's slightest breath. marshalled the heavenly winds, And summoned them to smite their harps for joy, Its mind the tltought embodied of all minds A golden hannony without alloy. Its voice was like the silver bugles' voice, When brave men march to war, or mellow tone. Of trumpets when the conquerors rejoice To come a~ain unscathed to land and own. IV And Winter u.shereth in a fair dead day vVhose loveliness was like to that of one, A lovely bride whom Death hath snatched away. Its shroud was \White and cold as burial stone, vVhite like the inner heart of milk-weed when Yon rosy fingered children fi.rst unfold It. Round h.er brows was wrapped gauze, then, A finer lace than cobwebs, 'neath the cold And wan old moon. Upon her peaceful breast A single diamond blazed and from her cu-rls Down to her pale and quiet hands at rest Was loosely wreathed a strand of priceless pearls• SAMUEL B. HowE, JR. THE. ROUND BUILDING. Of all the buildings of Union College, there. is not one which has clustered about its history. so many facts of peculiar interest as the old. Round Building. For over a quarter of a cent· ury it has stood the chill blasts of winter and the heat of summer, looming up gray and un- certain in the mists of the morning, or- sleeping in silent grandeur beneath the moon's silver rays.

The offer was accepted and work on the i building began. College buildings at the request of Dr. Nott. The foundation for the building was not laid until long after North and South College were built. \About r8o 5,\ according to the Union College Magazine of November, 187 2, Pr()f. Foster '' took a level of the College grounds to see in which direction they could drain off the water. The architect who made the plans of the College was very sure that the water should run northeast, but the results of Dr. 'Foster's calculations opposed any such idea. However, the arc hi teet was stubborn and un- fdertook to make it go his way whether it would ~or no by raising a long embankment in front ~between North and South College. T'his had the effect of setting th~ water back, and .it On Wednesday, October r8th, r87r, the first load of stone for the new chapel was delivered. The trustees, through the energy of the two young Presidents, Dr .. Aiken and Dr. Potter, were awakened from their long sleep. On the following Friday night a grand celebration was held by the students in honor of the event. , A procession was formed of ghastly ligures, each carrying a flambeau or a banner wrought with some strange device, such as, '' Eliphalet N ott,\ u Eliphalet N ott Potter,\ \ Resur- g am .1:• \ All Hail our Chapel \ \ In Union ' , . there is yet Strength,\ ''$Ioo,ooo.\ In the~ procession was a hearse bearing a coffin and a transparency informing all that the hearse

THE··-coNCORDIENSIS. '1 carried the '' First Stone on the Ground,\ and that the ·chapel had been begun. A march was made through the streets of the city, the chapel bell was rung, and the night was made lumi- nous with fireworks. At the resurrection cete- monies the following song was sung, adapted by C. E. Rounds to the air of ''Landlord fill the Flowing Bowl :\ Here we stand a j:olly crowd, In our exultation; Glad to see our Prex is going To build up this foundation. Chorus. :For to-night we'll merry merry be,. For to-night we'll merry merry be, For to-night we'll merry merry be, And celebrate our Chapel, When we see our Chapel rise, We'll often gather here, And as each stone is giv' n a place, . We'll greet it with a cheer. Chorus. For to-night etc. 1\'Iay ·each new class that enters' here Ne'er know care or sorrow ; But let each one assembled here, Think well of the morrow. Chorus. For to-night etc. And after ~u have got their \ dips,'' And with life's cares do grapple ; l\1ay we all come back again To celebrate our chapel. Chorus. For to-night etc. On :rviay 3oth, 1872, the work on the Chapel reached the stage when the masons were ready to erect the granite pillars between the win- dows. In order that the first pillar might be placed with appropriate exercises a holiday was given the student body. It will be well perhaps to state here a few facts concerning the building which are not generally known. It was built under the di- rection of Mr T. W. Rollins. The main part of the masonry is built of Ohio sandstone, which is easily shaped when first quarried but which hardens when exposed to the elements. The polished pillars between the windows were imported from Aberdeen, Scotland. The building is 84 feet in diameter and I 20 feet from the floor to the top of the dome. There is a Hebrew inscription laid in a band of red slates surroundihg the dome, the translation of which is : ''Life is short, the work is vast, the reward is great, the Master is urgent.\ A Mrs Brown of Liverpool, Eng., a relative of Clark- son N. Potter, gave the beautiful mosaic floor which cost $x 2,ooo. The plaster cast repro- ductions of some of the world's most famous statuary were given by Miss Catharine Loril- lard Wolfe. On the 2 2nd of June, 187 6, the building was dedicated. The following account of the dedi- cation is taken from \The Daily Union\ of that date : '' This morning at 8 o'clock occurred the .first or dedicatory services in the Memorial Hall at the College. At 7 :45 the faculty and students formed at the college cllapel, and under the head of Capt. vVard, marched in procession to Memorial Hall, where they were greeted by a score of ladies and gentlemen who had already assembled in the galleries awaiting the proces~ sion. The college choir with the organ acco.m- paniment led in a hymn of praise to God. Rev. Mr. Dar ling read appropriate selections of Scriptuer. After the singing of another hymn prayer was offered by Prof. \Velch. The dedi- catory address ·was made by Dr. Van Rensselaer ex-president of I-Iobart College. After this, Dr. Potter made a few remarks especially addressed to the graduating class and the undergraduates of the college. These addresses were happily adapted to the occasion and were received with rounds of applause. Another hymn was sung; and the benediction was pronounced by Rev. Mr Brown. The morning was beautiful, the exercises ·were admirably arranged and per- formed, and the occasion was most gratifying and auspicious. It will be noted that th~ Round Building is referred to in the Union College Magazine as a

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. chapel. It was generq.lly understood that it was to be used for this purpose but it never was. Shortly after its completion it was used as a library. The difficulty of heating it, how- ever, and the dim light rendered it unfit for a library, and the books were moved to their present home. Since that time the Round Building has been used only for banquets, con- ventions and balls. It is now, however, through the generosity of Mr Andrew Carnegie, to be remodeled into a library, and so enter up- on a new and useful stage of its existence. We will not attempt to give an account of the improvements that are at present under way as they were given in detail in a former issue of \ The Concordiensis.\ In this brief sketch we have been concerned only with the past history of the Round Building, not its glorious, useful future. MISCHIEVOUS PRANKS at UNION and PRINCETON UNIVERSITIES. Under the above headline, the New York Tri- bune of March 29th, prints an amusing account of the classical baseball game which occurred on the campus recently, and of another student escapade which occurred at Princeton. The cut of the campus which heads the article is w.ell worth seeing. We take pleasure in ac- crediting the following account to the Tribune and we thank its editors for giving Union the honor of a victory over Rutgers. '' When the Greeks defeated the Romans, v.rhat was the score ? \ Digby Bell once asked in the tuneful life of the comic opera '' ] upi- ter.\ Had he been on the baseball diamond of the Union University campus a few nights ago he could have worked out the answer. Excited by the victory of the Union University debate team over that of Rutgers College, a score of faculty fearless st':ldents transferred the tnost striking plaster figures of the college museum of casts from their dignified pedestals to places QI! th~ P.~H fte}ql ~pq ~~1 night long they play- \. ~ ; ed, or s.eemed to play, the great American ga1ne. It was a Greco-Ron1an team, and there were spectators from both nations. For son1e of then1 it was their first outing in their plaster lives, and they surely made the tnost of it. The students declare that they never witness- ed a more exciting game, and the only ones displeased are the attendants, who had to carry the casts back into the museun1 when the morning light discloses to Faculty Hill the cleverest trick over which Union has ever laughed. No sooner had the last orator in the joint debate finished his argun1ent than there \-vas a mad rush for the campus, where they gather- ed at the celebrated \Round Building.\ It was erected years ago by Dr. Potter, fonnerly president of the college, only to earn from thankless students the opprobrious title of ''Potters Folly.'' It is now being repaired at the expense of Andrew Carnegie, who con- tributed $4o,ooo for the purpose. These re- pairs n1ade entrance easy for several daring spirits who had conceived the plan of a ghost team. \ Who'll be the first one out?\ wondered the waiting crowd of students who knew of the plans. ''It's Minerva,\ was the shouted answer as a student came out staggering under an im- mer1se statue. In quick succession the other statues which had been settled upon by the projectors of this decided novelty in the sport- ing line were brought out and arranged in the places called for by the batting order. Miner- va apparently had won the toss-up and chosen \first licks,\ for her combination harpoon and backhair supporter shortly was p1 aced in a position where it would sweep the rubber plate of the college diamond. Pallas Athene occupied the initial sack, and ~ from the energetic manner in which she appar- ently -vvas signallh1g to Mars, who played short field, it was evident that she was dissatisfied wi~h the rna;nner in which that redoubtable par- . . .. .. ' (

. I THE OONCORDIENSIS. 9 agon of Donnybrook virtues was whirling the sphere over to her, and had be~~Hne a-wearied of f 'chasing the ball'' among the 2 5 cent seats. 0ne of the more facetious students had brought along one of the masks worn by the catcher of the 'varsity nine, and this was plac- e9 about the stern features of Esculapius. The second baseman was fair 1'halia, and it is related that a feature of the gatne was the per- fect manner in which she '' backed up '' Mars when there was a runner on third and a passed grounder meant a tally. Third base was in charge of Apollo, and the official score, which was kept by Ceres in good old rye straw Sche- nectady fashion, each spear of cornbrush in the right hand counting for a run for the Ro- mans, while a similar understanding was had regarding the tallies of, the Greeks and her left hand shows that he made no errors. His fielding average was r,ooo, being represented by three \ fielder's choices\ and an assist. The outfield consisted of .iEgis, in right garden; Diana centre, and Vesta left. The only objection noted was that lEgis's shield prevented her :figuring in the misplay colutnn, as the ball rolled off in each instance and was deftly caught ere it had fallen to the ground. The'figures of Euterpe, Dancing Faun, Terp- sichore and Siren were placed protninently in front of the grandstand, where they were in a posi~ion to furnish \the tnusic of the spheres \ in the approved 1nanner of a band of the \ mud- gutter'' variety. rrhe rotund outlines of Bac- chus and Faun suggested to the college humor- ist the possibilities of an ancient version of the genius who caters to the '' lemonade and car- rymel ,., wants of the sporting fraternity, while yet another of the assembled young men lug- ged out honest old Vulcan, and suggested that his was a rnost appropriate occupation, as he could ''knock ,., to his heart's content as the game went on.

Address all communications to THE CoNCORDIENSIS Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. Base Ball. So far a good deal has been said about paying subscriptions promptly. There Is no doubt that this is of primary importance and the realization of this necessity is one of the first duties which a college man must learn. The athletic teams, to a very large extent, owe their financial exis. tence to the student body, and they realize it. If only the student's could and would ! It is discouraging, to say the least, to the captain and manager of the base· ball team, when they have such bright prospeets as are evident this year, to see the men in college failing in their support of the nine. Aside from the financial consideration, there is an- other form of college spirit for the lack of which there can be no possible excuse. It is to come out on the campus and encourage the team during practice. Not to stand on the side lines and make disparaglng re- marks about the players. Remember that every candi- date is working not only for himself, selfishly, but .is trying to do his best also, for his college. Help the manager and team with your subscriptions; help the captain and players with your encouragement. In recognition of their excellent services the Concor- diensis Board takes pleasure in welcoming to its num- ber Walter E. Beadle of the class of 1904 and Frank R. Andrews of the class of rgo5. There is always room on the staff for hard workers who are ready at all times to- sacrifice their personal convenience to their re- portorial duties and who are always to be depended upon for painstaking and prompt services. We learn that the Board of Trustees at the recent meeting for the purpose of appropriating the sums of mQney required for the various departments and for necessary improvements took no action upon the matter of the employment of an officer for the college ,grounds. It is to be regretted that the wishes of the student body cannot be fulfilled for some time to come in this mat- ter. That the need of an officer is apparent cannot be questioned. The Concordiensis endeavored to voice the opinion of the students once before and wiU not be so rash as to offer further suggestions in view of the fact that its motives were called in question. The only way th~t a reform can be accomplished is by well-mean· ing and respectful critical suggestions. If there are those who desire to correct any tendencies of the stu· dents toward breaches of deportment or discipline, we shall be glad and willing to print their views. On the other hand permit us honest freedom of speecb.. ALUMNI NOTES. The Rev. Rayn1ond Augustus Lansing die\d Saturday at Lishas Kill.

CAlVIPUS NOTES. The senior class at a recent tneeting selected the design for class canes and the committee appointed for the purpose by Pres. Bolles expect to deliver the canes to their classmates in a few days. I\1ason vVadsworth of Binghatn ton has re-en- tered college in the class of 1906. Pay up your subscriptions. \\Villiam \Vaddell of the class of ~8z gave a very interesting talk on his work in Brazil at the Vesper service Sunday afternoon. He was largely instrumental in the founding of McK.enzie college in that country which was 1nodelled after Old Union in its general curricul un1. The annual convention of the Psi Upsilon fraternity will be held in Schenectady, May I 3 to rs, both inclusive, and the members of the rrheta chapter of Union college are making ar- range.ments for the proper reception of the , large number of delegates to the convention who are expected. A nun1ber of committees have been named by the chapter to have in charge the reception and entertainment of the guests, who are ex- pected to number about 200. The convention is to conclude with a banquet 2~t the hotel TenEyck, Albany on Friday even-\ .ing, Niay 15, and the con1mittee in charge of this phase of the gathering promises an un- usually brilliant toast list. Applications have been received from several Cornell students who, in view of the present state of affairs at that university, wish to enter Union college next term, The n1atter was under consideration by the college authorities for some time and finally Dr. Raymond wrote to President Schurman, stating that out of courtesy to that institution, Union would re- ceive those who wished to enter, but only as irregular students. It is not known at present how many will enter, but probably not more than two or three. Plans for the new athletic field have been drawn up by Professor Williams of the engine- ering department. 1'he field is to be fenced in and inside there will be a <football gridiron, baseball diamond and a running track surround- ing the whole. A grand stand and dressing rooms for players and contestants are also pro- yided for in the plans. No contracts have as yet been made. for the work. It is not definitely decided just where the field will be located. It is understood that some opposition is being 1net with frotn property owners and residents near Lennox road, who do not care to have the field near their homes. A~sistant Treasurer Pond said that it is not at all likely that the field will be ready for use short of a year, as the intention is to proceed slowly vvith the 1natter in order that everything connected with it 1nay be gone over carefully.

'fhe schedule for the sprtng term has been posted. There seems to be no change in the hour for college meeting, although a change was desired and looked for by the student body. The alun1ni association of the Kappa Alpha society of Troy, Albany, Schenectady and neighboring places will give a banquet at the Troy club, in Troy, on Saturday night, March 28th. The committee of arrangements is conl- posed of the following men: James S. l{nowl- ton, \Villian1s, '43; Allan H, Jackson, Union, '85; George M.

Shoeless am I and torn are my feet, Following the.e through the fields and the wood, The frost, the ice, the rain and the snow Are no hindrance$ to the passion of love. My. love is as young as I, Not yet twenty years old is she ; The love-light burns in her eyes ; She is happy and pure and fair ; Her voice is soft and caressing ; A beautiful prison is _she In which I have locked my heart. With what shall I compare her, My lovely Rose-Marie? Shall it be to the little white rose ? A little pearl among the maidens? Fleur-de-lis among the flowers ? In paying you court my sweet, I am like the nightingale, Perched on the hawthorn bough ; When he wishes to sleep He is stung by its thorns, Then upward he flies And from its high summit Begins his sad plaint. My planet is fatal, My state against nature Only pain have I known In this dreary world. I am like a soul In the flames of hell, No pitying saint Sheds her blessing on me. No one has suffered as I, Thy subject since my birth, On bended knees I inplore thee, In the name of the m.erc.iful God, Have pity upon thy poor priest. W. E. B. 'o4 ..

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS,. AN INCIDENT. rfhree hours to da\\Vll and the great ship forged over the restless waves. rrhe Hghts hung aloft, they sho\ved pale in the rising fog ; the sea was rolling in gn··tt long billows \\vhich did not break ; the sky was overcast witk leaden-colored clouds and the moon could be seen as a faint misty light, too feeble to mak:e objects discernable. Two hours to dawn and the wind began to rise. The night was black with a darkness like that of the fabled Ere bus. rrhe sea ·was moaning faintly, as one overcome \vith a great grief. The ship began to toss more and n1ore, and the convulsive throbbings of her mighty engines tningled with the rising wind wandering and gathering force over the ·waste of waters. One hour to dawn and the fury of the ele- nlents burst forth. \Vild was the hurricane :i the storm swept the ship on and on in the dark- ness. With masts and rudder gone ; with en- gines pounding aimlessly, she drove on like a sheeted ghost in the track of the tornado. A sudden brilliant flash of lightning lit up the sur- rounding waters. Straight ahead were seen low snow-capped hills, which assumed fantas- tic shapes-breakers ! Dawn, and the sky was clear. The roseate hue from the east painted the surface of the still restless ocean. vVhen · the sun set his golden lances at rest over the glittering waves,, he discloses the ship-the wreck of the ship. She lay a mile off shoreJ with her ri~ging gone, her hull dismantled ; while every wave which struck her, covered her with frothing foam. She lies there still ; with her stet-n sunk deep in the shifting sands, and her bo'v high above the ever-restless breakers, as if de- fying thetn for another struggle. OPEl~ING THEIR EYES. From the \ Union.\ tfhe Union has always contended that the most satisfactory and accurate education could be obtained at a small college rather than at the large universities where the instruction is given by young tutors rather than by the rna .. ture tninds of the professors or heads of de- partments. vVe have been very much interest- ed, therefore, in reading the following extract from the Harvard University correspondence in the New York Tribune of recent date : ''In 'Oxford and Cambridge, England, stu- dents are taught by tutors, and rarely con1e in contact with the professors over then1, 1\'his used to be the case at Harvard, but of late years a strong movement has been setting in in just the. opposite direction. Harvard doesn't believe in working her professors too hard, and for that reason the n1ain work in each of the big courses is carried on by young instruct- ors, some of ·whom perhaps just finished the course the year before, and others. as is fre- quently the case, studying and instructing at the san1e tin1e. '' rrhese young instructors are a great an1use- ment as well as an object of dislike to Harvard men, who in this case ·would much prefer to come back to plain American methods of teach .. ing. rfhis, however, is a case where the facul- ty has all the say, and whereas 1nost students come to Harvard for the express· ptlrpose of con1ing in contact with some of her 'grand old men,' they find themselves being taught by soft cheeked youngsters who apparently are no older or wiser thnn themselves. Of late the feeling against these young instructors has been so strong that even the college authori- ties have thought that some changes ought to be made. It is at last becoming apparent that Harvard must at least command the respect of her students in the classroom, and to that end a moven1ent is to be made soon lessening tbe nutnber of young instructors and placing n1ore mature men in their pi aces.\ No such criticism is provoked in the small college where practically all the faculty are men of age and experience in their specialty and who are able to give their classes the bene- fit of not only a trained and mature mind but

~THE CONC'ORDIENSIS. 7 of long and <:areful research as well. It is a strange anomaly that people will demand in the professions the services of an experienced physician or !lawyer, will be better satisfied with a sermcn preached by a minister of long time service in the pulpit and will prefer in business the judgment of older men, but yet will be cont~nt to send their sons to institutions where they win sit at the feet of men scarcely older or with minds but little more matured than they. The small college should not be discouraged. 1\'he time wiH come wheu colleges of the type of Dartmouth and Ul)ion will be appreciated as fully as in Hte days gone by, ·when they sent out into life the m.en who have contributed like Webster and Seward, so much toward the na. tion 's renown. A~LUMNI SMOKER. The following letter is being sent to all Union alum11i in the vicinity of New York. New York, April 2d, 1903. Dear Sir : A number of the Alum11i of Union College, residing in this city and vicinity, have repeat- edly suggested that something in the line of a \Smoker\ be given for the purpose of bring- ing together various graduates and friends of the college, who have the best interests of their Alma 1\fater at heart. At the annual dinners of the Alumni Association of New York, the absence of the younger graduates has been very noticeable. At the last meeting of the Executive Co,tnmittee of this Association, a comrnittee kll(),Vn as The Young Men's Com- mittee, was appointed, consisting of C. L. Bar .. stow, '89, Clarke W. Crannell, 'os, and Fred- erick Klein, \95 \vith the privilege of said committee to add new rnembers. In view of the small number of persons at- tending the College Dinner, this committee is determined if possible, to get the fellows to- gether and hopes for this purpose to arrange fgr 'l '' SmQ~;~ ~· '' ~~ l?~ ~iven at some ~nit~ole place, some evening during the latter part of this month.. The idea is to have music and to serve light refreshments, etc., and to limit the expense to $I.oo a person. This letter will he sent to graduates and friends of Union College living in this vicini- ty, with the view of getting their expression of approval or disapproval of the proposed plan. If sufficient numbers respond favorably, the committee will proceed at once to complete ar- rangem,ents and inform you in due time when and where the \ Smoker \ will take place. Other colleges hold such affairs two or three times a year with considerable success, and there is no reason why \ Union College\ can- not do likewise. Kindly send your answer to Mr Frederick I{lein, 237 Broadway, who has volunteered to attend to the correspondence. A favorable reply at your earliest convenience is requested. Yours for old Union C. L. Barstow, '8 9, J. 0. Reynolds, '94, Clarke W. Crannell, '95· Frederick l{.lein, '95, Please bring this matter to the attention of your friends personally, and send to the com- mittee the names of any that you think n1ay have failed to receive this letter. MEDICAL COLLEGE. Gatnn1a chapter of the Omega Upsilon Phi Medical fraternity at the Albany Medical Col- lege was chartered on March 12, 1903. The installation of the chapter, following the initiation of the charter members, ·was con- ducted in the lodge rootn of the Humane So- ciety in their building on Eagle Street. The members who took charge of the initiatory and other ceremonies of the evening were from the New York University and Cornell chapters of the fraternity and included Drs.G.A.

Omega Upsilon Phi was founded at the Univ,ersity of Buffalo, in the medicai depart- ment, in 1894, and is a strictly professional society. The fraternity numbers chapters at the University of Buffalo, University of Cin- cinnati, Denver College of Medicine, New York University, 1\'rinity Univ~ersity in Toron .. to, University of Colorado, Cornell Medical College in New York, San Francisco Medical College, Johns Hopkins University. Chapters at two or three other institutions will shortly be announced. . This is the third fraternity that has thus far been established at Union's medical depart- ment, Phi Sigma Kappa, and Nu Sigma Nu be- ing the others. Omega Upsilon Phi stands fifteenth in the roll of Union's fraternities. The sixteen men comprising the charter members of the new ·chapter are Frederick Mac Donald, 'o3, of Watervliet; P. R. Bow- dish, 'o4, of Cornwall ; Silas L. Filkins, 'o4, of Albany; J. Bennett Garlick, 'o4, of Albany; William E. Garlick, 'o4, of FaU River, Mass; E~ C. Haviland, 'o4, of Wolcott ; Trevor C.

On Saturday evening, April 4th, the members of the :Glee an.d instrumental clubs were very hospitably 'entertained by the Mohawk club in its large club house on Liberty street. After a short pr()gramn1e by the clubs all joined in singing th.e latest popular songs. Light re- freshments were served at eleven, and soon after the g-athering broke up, all the college men a:greein g that the Mohawk Club n1embers are genial :hosts. The Rev. M:r. Hamilton, pastorof the Union Presbyterian. churches' mission in this city, ad- dressed the students at Vespers Sunday. Allen S. Feck, 'o3, recently took a business and pleasure trip to \Vashington and Philadel- phia. He was the guest of John D. Guthrie, 'o2, in the former city and in Philadelphia of Walter E. Jlrensi, 'o3, who is co1npleting his course at V. F. Thirty yo1.1ng men etnployed in the General Electric '\vorks have formed a lacrosse club, and they intend to make the coming season one of the ut:most enjoyment and athletic pro- fit. Many of the members of the club have played on lacrosse tean1s with their respective colleges, an <1 they are expected to give a good account of themselves. It is believed that the grounds adjoining the cricket fi.e 1d in McClellan street will be leased. Prof. Coley has issued a call to all lacrosse players in college and hopes soon to organize a club to represent Union. The Union chapter of Delta 1Jpsilon enter• tained a number of alumni at an informal smoker last Wednesday evening. . George \Vashington Tuttle, one of seven students of Union College, Schenectady, who in November, 1833, founded tb·e Psi Upsilon Fraternity, died April 3, at his home in :Eath. The only survivor now of the seven founders of the Psi Upsilon Society is General Edward Martindale of San Diego, Cal. Mr Tuttle was a merchant in New York from 1848 to r878 and retired from business life in r879. Invitations have been received to a dance to be given by Chi Psi at their lodge on College Hill on April 17. On Friday evening the students,made use of a quantity of boards and other timber that had been left outside of the'· Round Building\ by the workmen who are engaged in the work of making repairs on that structure. An im- mense bonfire ·was made and the boys danced about it in approved sky-larking style, singing the songs of Old Union and calling upon the shades of night to witness and attest their de- votion--or otherwise-to various persons who figure tnore or less in the life of the institution. • I --Schenectady Datly Union.

One of the city papers recently misquoted ~fr. Pond in stating that in the near future he would exclude the public from the college grounds. 'Vhat he did say was to the effect that if the public in the future shows no more resped for the privacy of the grounds than in some cases it llas shown in the past it may become necessary to exclude it. The grounds are private, and belong to the college and are for the use of those connected with the college. It is not right that the college should be compelled to bear all the expense of maintenance if it cannot also have the final say in regard to who shall enjoy its advantages. It seems time to again remind all reporters that ac- curacy of information is as necessary as variety of de- tail.

Physical education today more than ever before is acknowledged to be as necessary as a purely mental culture, and the best physical culture is promoted by College athletics.

There will be no issue of the Concordiensis next week on account of the Easter recess. Schenectady, N.Y., April 6th, 1903. 'fo the Editor of The Concordiensis. Dear Sir: There was a certain amount of injustice in the President's Friday morning remarks which deserves a little attention. \Vithout calling in question the estimate of the Round Building statues which places there value in the thou- sands of dollars, and admitting the regrettable fact that some damage was undoubtedly done to them at the time of the well-advertised clas- .., sic base-ball game, there yet remain some facts, the ignoring of which is unjust to the students. For the past four years at least these thou-

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 sand-dollar statues have received no attention whatever from the college authorities. 1\'hey have been left to the mercy of the dirt until they would have been filthy even without the lead-pencil decorations added in some cases. ·More than this, they have been buffeted around by various Sophomore Soiree and Senior Ball com·mi ttees, and needless to say, they have not escaped entirely unscathed. These facts have given rise to a wail of regret on the part of at least one member of the faculty. When the extensive repairs, now in progress on the Round Building, \Vere begun, no meas- ures for the protection of the statuary were taken, as far as could be seen, and, waiving the question of the high probabilty of damage be- ing done by the workmen, it is a fact that one figure was blown over by the wind. Lastly-and the ignoring of this fact is the cruelest cut of all-the neglect of the college authorities to provide a policeman for the grounds, in spite of the often-expressed wish of the student body, is responsible for some of the damage. U nawed by the '' college cop,\ city youngsters roam around the campus, go in the Round Building, make targets of the statues and otherwise abuse them. vVe like fun, but we endeavor to do the right thing as far as possible, and even the hint that vandalism is rife an1ong us is distasteful. We hardly see why we should be in the mental condition to appreciate the works of art under discussion, when so little appreciation of them has been exhibited in the acts of the college authorities. Resp 'y yours, A. E. B. 'o3. BASEBALL PRACTICE. Up till last week the practice has been, in a general way, for all candidates alike, but is no'\v narrowing down to the twelve or so regu- lar men. This does not tnean that there will be no changes but that from the candidates now out the 'Varsity have been. practically picked. Union has better pitchers and n1ore of them than she has had in a long time. 0' Brien, Sweet and Bingham are all excellent twirlers and \Vest Point win h.av·e an exceedingly hard time to hit any one of then1, and with Capt. Griswold or Easton behind the bat our bat- teries are more than satisfactory. The infield is composed of fast men with good throwing arms as practice will show. Under the coaching of Coogan and Capt. Griswold it is by far the best infield that has worn the \ Garnet\ for years. Either Cheney or Rider are good first basemen and batters. 'Vith Griswold or Staeber on second we may be sure of few errors there. At shortstop every one knows of Mahar's ability hoth as fielder and an accurate thro\ver. Ellen wood is also a promis- ing \cotner.\ Third is being almost perfectly played by O'Brien who also has an accurate throw. Bradley is also a crack third basetnan and heavy hitter. The outfield is also very strong. 'Vith Heath in left, Bradley in center and Hagar,a promising freshman in right, the outfield seems well taken care of. Cheney is also a fast and sure outfielder. As a batting tean1 Union should rank among the first. 1'o name the heavy hitters would be to name again the whole team as all are hitting well. The substitutes and \scrubs\ are giving the 'Varsity the best practice possible. Zim- mer n1akes a good pitcher with Imrie as a running catcher. 'Vith this battery and Sher- man at first, Staeber at second, McCombs at third, Ellenwood at short, the infield will be seen to be con1posed of first class tnen. Dwight is also a good shortstop \vith Losee as a good catcher. For outfielders '\Ve have Haines, Chad- wick, Dwight, Losee and several others. If second team continues to con1e out regularly . the Assistant Manager will schedule some good games for them.

12 THE CONOORDIENSIS. l'he probable line up at the 'Vest Point gatne win be: Easton or Griswold, catcher. Bingham, Sweet, O'Brien, pitcher. Rider or Cheney, first base. 'Griswold or Staeber, second.

Dear Sir; I would feel greatly obliged if you could send me. a copy of your article on the new electrical course in your College, which I learn from the Electrical World & Engineer has been published in '' Concordiensis.\ I a·m at pres- ent organizing a course in Electdcal Engineer- ing in our new laboratories and as I have found in your text books an ideal course for my senior students, I feel greatly interested in a cours.e designed by such an authority in Elect- rical matters as yourself. If the details of your lecture and laboratory courses are not yet con1pleted I shou_ld feel greatly obliged if you would send me a copy as soon as they are published, and I hope also that a description of your laboratory equipment will be published soon. Yours faithfully, l. B. Henderson. BRAZIL. Speech made in Union College Y. M. C. A.. ~ ~~-­ by an old graduate of Union, Mr. Wardell, '82: /j .:~. ,, \Vhen I went to Brazil, I found a pecurar - condition of affairs. The whole country is deficient in educational institutions. Jt has a number of common schools, and they are most astonishingly cotnmon schools. In Pernambu- co sotne time ago the government deprived thirteen school teachers of their certificates because they could neither read nor write .. All parents who really care to have their chil- dren educated must e1nploy private instructors. 'The professional schools really try to give a good course, but it takes only eight years of previous study to get into thetn, and then but four more, so that after twelve years of school life, students are turned out full-fledged law- yers, doctors, etc. It is useless to introduce culture courses in their schools. We tried to model our mission school after Union College as much .as possible, and our courses proved very attractive, but it was eight years before we succeeded in graduating a class. The courses had to be made a si:x years course, beginning with the midd1e of high school work, and was divided into thre\ parts; the first two years were high school work, the third year called gymnasium course, and three years college work. Success was

THE CONOORDIENSIS. 13 slow, bu:t it gradually gained ground, and in r898, at the end of eight years, we had the privilege of seeing the first group graduate. '!'hen I came to the United States, and have .not since returned to my work. Between 1898 and rgoo the number of students was increas- ed to 6o, and have about doubled that nutnber . s1nce. I speak of this c'Jllege work, because this college is really a child of U nio1i. College. For the first eight years, we had very fevv teachers and I was compelled to teach at times in every subject but French and Portuguese .. The or- ganization of the school, and let me add I hope the spirit ofthe institution, are very much like that of Union. Bahia,. in the central part of Brazil where our tnission is located, is really in a barbarous country,, no better than Africa. The first set- tlers carne to :Bahia a hundred years before Manhattan Island was purchased frotn the Indi- ans. The town hall, begun in I 530, and fin- ished in 157 o is really not such a bad looking place, even to\day. * The native population, unlike that of North America, did not retain its national characteristics, bnt sotne amalgam- ated with the new settlers to such a degree that at present there is hardly a fnll-blooded native in the land. This intermingling pro- duced two classes of people; the wild, fierce inhabitants of the country, iiving by means of preying on their richer neighbors, and the more wealthy class, too indolent to do any work themselves. As of course under these conditions, the country could not be opened up or -worked to any degree, the governn1ent of Brazil granted a certain company the right to import ten thousand negro slaves from Africa every year, to do the work for the settlers. This opened up a very prosperous tra?e, and by the tin1 e slavery was abolished, over three million slaves had been brought over. Num- bers of these slaves were after a time enabled to earn enough to buy their freedom, and it *Theremainder is from memory, so I can't guarantee its correctness. was characteristic of them that they would first take careof their priests and princes who were s.till in bonds. In fact, at one titne one of their princes had beco1ne established in the town, and \VaS so ass,isted by the great nun1ber of freed slaves who gathered around hin1, that he was enabled to assun1e control of the whole town. . There are two n1osques in the to\;vn. One ts attended by only the nrost orthodox and strict 1\fohammedctns,.-the other bysorne of the ortho- dox, but by a much greater n utn her of those of looser faith. Of the first kind, there was once a certain nun1ber who sailed fron1 Brazil to Africa in a small schooner, and journeyed across that continent to J\.1ecca on foot, and then can1e back by the san1:e route, so that it would indeed be a difficult matter to induce any of them to believe that all this sacrifice had been made for nothing. Still there are son1e times so·me retnarkable conversions. A certain very savage chieftain, who had killed over twenty n1.en at different times, became converted, and went about trying to spread the Gospel among his former con1panions. He was of course most grossly insulted by many of those wlil:o formerly feared him, though even then some were afraid to provoke hin1, lest he should turn on then1 and kill thetn. But this chieftain,vvho had once killeda man for silnply passing out of his house in front of hirn, 'vas not to be ~moved by their threats and insults, and would only say that if. they knew more about this new religion they wonld soon cease their mocking words. This is a country of tnagni:ficent distance. My own parish extended over a district about as large as New York, and my companions had several not n1 uch s1naller. There is still one vacant of only about a hundred thousand square miles which is yet -waiting for some one to take charge of it. The more intelligent of the population easi- ly perceive the truth and value of the Protes- tant doctrine, and agree with all the main points, but it is hard to produce a like impres- sion on the minds of the less educated.

14 THE OONCORDIENSIS. You hear a great deal of talk about the rev- olutions of South America, but there in Bahia a revolution with them is nothing more than is an ordinary election with us here. There is only this difference, -the governtnental party nearly always \\vins. The votes are so mana- ged by the parties in power that the great ma- Jority are given in favor of the government can- didate. If it happens that the party opposed to the government wins, by virtue of having a stronger force at their command, then the pres- ident writes out a long resignation, announcing the fact that he had become somewhat tired of the cares and troubles of public life, and would fain retire into the quiet and oblivion of pri- vate affairs; that he has remained in office thus long only at the insistent entreaties of his friends, and because he felt he owed his coun- try all the service he was able to render. COLLEGE MENTION. Harvard undergraduates are greatly agitated by the announcement that the Crimson faculty is seriously considering the abolition of foot- ball at the university. There bas been only one topic of conversation among Harvard men and that was the proposed plan of the faculty, and its connection with the article written by Prof. Hollis in which he advocated giving up the Yale game. It is now learned on good authority that Prof. Hollis's article had a double importance. In the first place, it was written to e::xpress the attitude of the n1ajority of the facult:y nembers on football, and secondly, it was intended to frighten Yale into accepting certain :eligibility rules that the Crimson has desired t<> be adopt- ·ed. The latter object was accomplished to the full satisfaction of the Crimson n1en a,t the con- ference in Springfield Saturday. 'The great point that Harvard had been hanging out for a four years' limit to a man's athletic career, while Yale has been equally anxious to have a man participate four years in each department of sport, which might make sixteen years ·of athletic life. It is said that Yale <~greed to Harvard's view. Every student is loud in expressing his dis- approval of Prof. Hollis's article.

THE CONCORDIENSIS No. 23. VoL. XXVI. UNION COLLEGE, APRIL ~2, 1903. THE TRAVELLER'S VISION. I. The night was wild, the lone wind howled ; The wan moon hid her silver face; The pine trees moaned, the cedars groaned And ghouls crept out into their place Of meeting ; while the traveller lost His path in the gloomy forest host. II. As midnight shades the darksome glades And wood-ghosts steal o'er fallen trees ; When witch-light shines o'er hidden signs, The lonely traveller starts and sees The vision of a staring skull and bones ; Bleached ; cold and silent there among the stones. 111. The wanderer fears, when there appears Before his startled trembling eyes- The bones arise as one who dies Before his time and mournful cries To Heaven for another taste of life, E'en tho' 'tis mingled with all bitter strife. IV. The traveller speaks as one who seeks Surcease from sorrow's weary chain; '' Tell me, oh Ghost, art thou too lost, !fast thou then in the cold grave lain, Is it well, oh spirit, witl1 thy soul ; Or art thou but a twilight ghoul ?\ v. Thus spoke the shade whose speech then made The hollow echoes sound more wierd ; '' 1 am not dead as thou hast said; Fear now no longer as thou feared, A few short moments since, my face Possessed what foolish men call grace ; VI. But now 'tis past as when the blast Of Autumn strips the fairest flower Of bloom and life--as when a knife Doth end some lover's happiest hour. l\1y Hfe was joyous then, and now There is no pain to make me bow.\ VII. Again It spoke.; '' I know you look To find the secret of man's death, I will not show, thou shalt not know Until thy ;latest passing breath. 13e not the Tempter, not the Snake, For only once you die-and wake. VIII. Fear not the grave, be not the slave Of inward dread that killeth faith; But live thy life in peace, not strife, In waiting patiently for death.\ The shade ceased speaking and sank down Once more to skull and bones,--life's ·crown. IX. The wanderer wept, then sighed and slept, As rests a tired, weary child. At down he rose, as one who knows Of some one waiting undefiled. In peace of soul he went his way: Content to die, content to live his day. A. II. Rutledge. CHI PSIS ENTERTAIN. Their Ne\V Home Opened to the College. The Chi Psi Lodge was a scene of great brilliancy Friday evening, when over a hun- dred guests graced the occasion of the open- ing of the Chi Psis' new home on the campus- to the college.

The first baseball game on the campus this season was played with Rensselaer Polyt~chnic Institute last Saturday. The day was a very disagreeable one, the prevailing high winds rendering perfect or even good playing for either side almost impossible. The game was without any particular features and was characterized by loose playing. Wirt, the R. P. I. catcher, was a very competent and steady player behind the bat. O'Brien played a good game for Union. The loss of Heath was bad- ly felt, although Staeber played well for his first game '' on the mound.'' Only seven inn- ings were played. The final score was :1:9-9 in favor of Union. Grout, captain of last year's team, umpired the game. THE WEST POINT GAME. On Saturday, April I Ith, the Garnet nine lined up against the strong West Point contin- gent. After the first few innings, the soldiers were forced to place their best pitcher, consid- ered one of the best amateurs in the country, in the box, for Union had begun to knock the fir~t pitcher all over the diamond. Bingham ·was in the box for Union and he held the sol- dier's down to a very few hits. The individu- al playing was consistently good. The score was 1-o in Union's favor up to the seventh inning, when West Point, on a long fly, with three men on bases, brought the score up to 3--.-1. No more runs wete made by either side, and the game ended 3-1 in favor of West Point. Mr. R. W.

II The Inter. class Track Meet. The captain and manager of the track team have arranged for an inter·class track meet this Saturday. It occurs just two weeks before the meet with Rutgers and is a last chance, or, if not the last, a very good chance, for anyone to show his athletic ability. The coach has been on the oval this week and seems to think that Union has prospects of a good team. Let everyone come out to this meet, and let those who do enter do their best and those who do not enter encour- age th?se who do. It has been several years since Union won a track meet but if the Garnet's representa- tives turn out in good style, there is no reason why the m<!et cannot be captured from the New Jersey college this year. This is probably the best inter-class meet this year and it is an ,e~cellent opportunity for men to mali:e their numerals, even though they think they stand no chance of making the team. One can never tell just how much he is good for until he tests his abilities to their greatest e~ten t. The New Catalogue. There is at least one feature in the new catalogue which is essentiaHy new and argues great things in the future for the financial support of Union's Athletic teams, and . that is the introductien of the campus tax clause under the head of regular ·expenses. There is no doubt that this is the only fair way of assessment. Heretofore the ' entering classes were somewhat taken aback when it came to the question of subscriptions for athletics, but now every man knows before he en te~s College that he is expected to pay a regular tax for the support of his College's athletics and no one can now offer the excuse of ignorance. In almost all other respects, except in the gratifying change in the electrical engineering de partment, the catalogue is essential:ly the same as last years. It is true that the paragraph relating to lectures might be purged of facts which, to the unknowing, would convey a false impression, but otherwise the prospectus is a good one. ON RESOLUTION. When sore beset with myriad cares,- With disappointment,--trouble,--strife,-- The sense that all ambition's vain, That naught is pleasure, all is pain ; That one's a fool who calm,Jy bears The vVorld's derisive scorns and flouts ; vVhat must one do ? THIS should one do. Stand firm, be brave, cheer up, fight on ! Feel sure that Might can ne'er make Right, Just shape your course, .and keep it straight. Be honest,-though temptation's great. Keep a strong guiding hand upon Yourself, and your's will be the fight ! . E. H. M. (Law, 'o3).

THE CONOORDIENSIS. ll A LETTER FROM TEXAS. Editor of the Concordiensis : It may be of interest to the readers of the Coneordiensis to know sa:me facts concerning this part of the state of Texas and the work that is being done here by the U. S. Bureau -of Forestry, of the Department of Agricul- ture. It would be :well, fi.rst of all, to explain, in a general way what Forestry is, and what the Bureau is atten1pting to accomplish. The Division of Forestry has been in existence some eight years as one of the divisions under the Departtnent of Agriculture. rfhis was the first and only real interest shown in forest- . ry in this country, with the exception .of some private individuals, as Mr George Vanderbilt at Biltmore, 1~. C., who had been putting into -practice methods used by German foresters, which were modified to suit American condi- . tions. The Division of Forestry was made in- to a l3ureau in July, 1901, and at the same time greatly enlarged. It is steadily increas- ing year by year in size and usefulness and ac- complishing the ahns of its founders, namely, to bring to the people of the United States a realization of the imtnense wealth they possess in their forests and, which is n1ore in1portant, how to care for these forests so that they n1ay produce an annual yield for all time. The science of Forestry in this country is as yet very young. The owners of forests, both public and private. are just beginning to real- ize 'the importance of preserving the timber- supply, both because of the material itself and the forest's influence on clin1ate and waterflow. The countries of the old world were brought face to face many years ago with the satne problem of caring for the forests that were left to then1, and are far ahead of us in scien- tific methods of forestry, Gennany probably heading the list. Forestry has been defined as scientific lumbering. It is more than that. A better definition is that it is '' The art of . managing forests and utilizing them for the benefit of their owners. It is not the science or natural history of woodlands; nor is it the art of planting tr·ees; nor that of preserving \voodlands. It etnbraces all these things, or at least special phases of them are required in its practice.\ The Bureau, in order to bring to the public tnind its 1D.ethods, offered a few years ago to make what is known as a ''working-plan'' for any lutnber company or private corporation owning over a certain nurnber of acres. This offer was accepted by a nutnber of companies and individuals. Atnong the number for which working plans have been tnade and which have been put into actual operation are the follow· ing: for a tract in Polk and JVIonroe counties, Tenn., on the western slope of the Smoky Mountains, of 1 1o,ooo acres ; for a tract of 6o, ooo acres belonging to the Okeetee Club, in Hampton and Beaufort oounties, S. C.,; for the 1\t~oose River Lumber Company in N. Y., a tract of 1s,ooo acres; a tract of 15o,ooo acres -of the Great Northern Pape1· Company in the Northwestern part of Maine ; for the Sawyer and Austin Lumber Con1pany, of Pine Bluff, Ark., for the University of the South, at Sewanee, Tenn., on a tract of 6,ooo acres, and the t\VO large tracts upon which ·work is now being carried on, on the E. P. l3 urton tract of 72,ooo acres of longleaf and yellow pineland in Berkley county, S.C. and 1,2so,ooo acres of yellow pine land in south -east T'exas belonging to the Kirby Lumber Company .. Upon the Kirby tract there are fifty n1en en- gaged, divided into four camps. The person- nel of the parties is interesting. 1'here are college graduates from a large number of colleges and 1nany states are represented. The entire work is in charge of an expert for- ester frotn New Jersey, a Yale graduate, who has had practic~l work in the most diverse of North American forests,-the Adirondacks, in the Carolinas, ~Iaine and the Northwest, be- sides having had training abroad. '1'here is an expert lumberman from Niaine, a forest engin- eer of twenty years experience in surveying and mapping. There are college n1en from Yale, Princeton, llarvard, Union, Sewanee,

12 THE OONOORDIENSIS. Butler, Cornell, Lafayette, Manhattan, Lehigh, Roanoke, Dartmouth, Amherst, Charleston, Colby, Universities of Texas and Illinois, and the following agricultural colleges ; North _Ca.rolina, Iowa. and l\1ichigan. 1~here is also a Russian, a graduate of Russian and German universities and a Belgian prince, who, not- withstanding his pedigree and length of name is a fine fellow and charming camp-mate. The actual work consists of stem-analysis., sample-plots and valuation survey. Stem- : analysis is taken upon felled trees in the follow- . ing manner. ·Upon the level, sawn surface of the stump an average radiLts is drawn from the centre to the circutnference. The rings, which show the age, one ring for each year, are count- ed, beginning at the circumference, and each decade or tenth year marked. The total age is tallied with the age of the sapwood. The distance from the center to each decade-mark is measured, to hundreths, showing the growth in diameter for each ten years. 'This is tallied, , also the width of the sapwood and width of the bark. The tree is sawed at intervals of ten feet, and analyses taken upon each one of the sections. From this is obtained the rate of ·growth of the tree not only for different heights and diameters but for every ten years of its life. 'fhe total height, the actual mer- chantable length, the possible merchantable length and the clear length are also found. From all these fig!lres, rate of growth and yield or volutne, tables are prepared. Valuation survey is simply a method used to ascertain the number of board feet per acre on a certain tract. Regular survey lines are run, one-half mile apart, and all trees on a strip sixty-six feet wide, the length of a surveyor's chain, are measured with a pair of calipers at four and a half feet from the ground to find the diameter. Four men ordinarily compose a crew, compass-man, tally-man and two cali- per-men, one on each side, each with a space thirty-three feet wide to cover. Each measure- ment is tallied with the species of the tree. · 1~his method, known as the \ Strip Method,'' is considered to be the best for obtaining an ac- curate know ledge of the stand of timber upon a tract. The tallyman is also required toob ... serve and record directions of all stre~ms, and other topographical notes, besides a descrip- tion of the soil, ground-cover, any herbs, plants or undergrowth; and other silvacultural notes. 1~he principal timber here in this work is longleaf and yellow pine, fanning 8o per cent of the stand. The working plan will be made with special reference to this, although other pines, loblolly and shortleaf, will be consid- ered along with hardwoods. There is a large variety of trees found throughout this part of the State. In hardwoods are found white, cow, chestnut and black oaks, on the slopes, with laurel, live, willow, pin, and water oak in the fiats. There are also hollies, two kinds, mag- nolia, bay, black and sweet gum, ash, white and blue beech, and on the river bottoms and bayous fine cypress. The climate of Texas is unique, both as to its variability and range, owing in a great measure to the size of the state. No one can foretell what the weather will he two hours hence. The sun may rise in a cloudless sky, the air warm and pleasant, almost tropical, be· fore noon a \ Norther\ may be raging, while by night it may be warm and pleasant as May. Strange to say, notwithstanding the variety of tetnperatures, the vegetation is largely that of semi-tropical climate. Palms .grow luxuri· ously in evet:y swamp, or \ bay-gall \ Span· ish ~oss swings in long, graceful festoons -from the trees, magnolias and live-oaks are every- where. rrropical insects and reptiles abound, on the warm days. Chameleons, tarantulas, cen tipede.s, scorpions, moccasins, and rattle- snakes can be seen without looking very dili- gently. 'Tis a common occurrence while sit- ting around the camp-fire at night to see a centipede some six or eight inches in length, crawling slowly toward the fire. Tarantulas and scorpions may be found by· simply turning over any·decayed log, and chameleons·· can- be seen sunning thexnselves on every other stump.

THE CONOO~DIENSIS. 13 Mosquitoes, it is needless to say, are quite plentifnl and of prodigious size and ferocity, even rivalling the noted Jersey species, the malarial fever variety being numerous. Dr A. D. Hopkins, of the U. S. Division of Entotnol- ogy was here for a few weeks in November , collecting specimens of the Tex.as mosquito. He obtained an ample supply. broom--but this is wandering. It was early fall, just after recitations had begun. I had batted chapel one morning and was lazily un~ packing some pictures 1 had brought from home for my room. Among them was one of myselt, taken in a Scotch llighlander's cos tume, which I had worn in an amateur play at horne. I was quite a broad-chested fellow in The game in this part of the State is quite good ; white~tailed deer, black bear, and bob- cat are found; while smaller game, turkey, hares, .quail and wood-cock are very plentifuL those days and didn't n1ake a half bad Scotch- man. I had spread the pictures out on my study table and was looking around the roon1 '· to \\select a good place for them when I heard a rap at my door. I knew itnm.ediately, who it was, it was ' Aumie.' She had come to 'rid ' up my room as she called it. It had been her duty for years to look after the students' rooms. She was a dear old Scotch lady with a bent form and lagging step ; but her pleasant smile and kind ' guid mornin,' \vas a genuine pleasure to many a fellow who was inclined to the blues on a dull gray morning. Autnie had begun to The people with whom we come in contact are of the humbler walks of life, lumbermen, ranchers, farmers, most of them descendants of the original settlers in the state. 'Their sur- roundings, mean and lowly, yet we have al- ways found them kindly, friendly, very hospi- table and good-natured. They are proud of their state, in their w2:y, and well they may be, for Texas is the largest and one of the ric best states, only waiting to be developed and open-.· ed up, which is being done rapidly. John D. Guthrie ; 'o2. Kirbyville, Texas. March, 1903. A STORY OF \ AUMIE., lt was a beautiful night in the latter part of June during commencement week, while sitting with my uncle on the '' jolly old seat of stone\ in front of North College, that my uncle told me the following story. We had refilled our pipes, and after he had puffed a few minutes in silence he began, more as if thinking aloud the old memories recalled by the gray walls in front of us, now _softened in their ruggedness by the silver moonlight, than actually telling me a story. \ •Twas during my senior year-how well I remember it ! Yes, there are the stone steps, hollowed and worn smooth by the tread oJ generations of students. How often I have s~-en. her toil up. those~ sam.e steps with. pail an.d. sweep up the scraps of paper which I had packed between my pictures, and I ·was tacking up some of them with my back turned toward her, when I heard her utter an exclatnation of mingled joy and pain. Turning around I saw her looking intently at my picture in the Scotch costume, her knotted hands working convul- sively. as they grasped the broom handle. 'What's the matter Aumie'? I asked, think- ing perhaps she was ill. She sat down before she spol{e, trembling violently. ' It gae me sic a start. I thocht it wur my Charlie. But nae, nae, it canna be. I ken well noo, 'tis ther Maister Culloden. It look it as he did before he went awa'. He was a bonu ie laddie my Charlie. The last time I saw heem he wur dressit like that,' she said, pointing with a trembling finger to the picture on the table. 'I ken werl the time he cam to bid me guid bye. 'Twas in the gloamin' an' I wur glad for he couldna see the tears that would come in my een. For a long time we hearkit to the creekit's chirrup, an' I cude bear. the tap, tap of the honeysuckle agin the

14 THE CON'CORDIENSIS. lattice as the night-wind cam s.ighin' over the brae.· At last Charlie took me in his arms an' slippit this ring on my finger, and as she spoke she turned back and forth on her finger a plain gold band, worn thin and dull with years of toil. - 'An' then I knew he wur greetin ', for his cheeks wur clamp like mine. An' then be went awa'. Her voice had sunk almost to a whisper, and she was rocking gen tiy to and fro. 'He ne'er cam back, n1y Charlie. Over an' over again hae I stuid by the lattice, wi' the honey suckle tappin' my face, waitin' for him, him, listenin' for him as of auld when he nsed to come sin gin' over the brae'. She leaned forward and spoke in a low, mysterious whisp- er, as if she was telling me sotne awful secret. 'Then they to\vd me he wur daid, an' that he wouldna come back again, but I couldna be- lieve that, nae, nae. An' I listened an' lis- tened in the gloamiu,' but he ne'er cam back, nae, nae he ne'er cam back.' Just then the bells began to ring for reci ta- tions, but Aumie did not hear them. Her dim, faded eyes did not see the room in which she sat, nor me ; they saw the scenes of her youth, the fading gold of the twilight and the beloved form of her bonnie Charlie. Her ears did not hear the clang of th.e chapel bell, but were listening to the tap, tap of the honeysuckle against the lattice, the far away calls of night- birds, and to the voice of her laddie as he came singing over the brae through the purple twi- light.. Taking up a book from the table I started for the classroo,m, closing the door carefully, reverently behind me leaving Aumie in her fond, sad dream of her youth and love.\ Our pipes had gone out, and as we arose to go to our rooms for the night I thought I saw a gleam of unwonted moisture in my uncle's eyes. \L-S 'o4. RED POTTAGE. I He who has tasted of the Pottage Red Knows peace of mind no more, He who from rest of soul has fled Is heart sick of sin's lore. II He who has eaten of that sweetest fruit, Which seeming sweet is bitterness withal, Soon finds the rift of discord in his lute Nor can he check his blinded downward fall. III Oh the anguish of the spirit soul when caught Fast in the snare of sweet seducing's train, II e sold his heart of hearts and with it bought Fierce bitterness and tears and mortal pain.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 15 SONG, Tune, '' Come, Sister Come.\ I Roses white and red I bring thee Memories of another clime, Thoughts are sad and speech is low, \Vhen I dream of the olden time. II Friendship true and love I bring thee Tokens of a love divine Say goodbye before I leave thee For I am forever thine. III Say, dear, that you will remember, When to other lands I go, Say that you will ever love me E'en when death's waters o'er me flow ! s. c. '04.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XXVI. UNION .COLLEGE, APRIL 29, 1903. No. 24. THE PRESIDENTS OF UNION COLLEGE. 1~he first president of Union College, at its organization in 1795, was the Rev. John Blai~ Smith, D. D. He was graduated at Princeton in 1773, and succeeded his brother in the pres- idency of Sydney College, Virginia in I 779· He was president of Union from I 79 5 to I 799· At the latter date he returned to the pastorate of the First Presbyterian church of Philadelphia, and died very shortly afterward. The second president was Jonathan Edwards, the second son of the great New England di- vine of the same name. After his graduation in I 765 he was tutor in that college for two years, and after that pastor in Connecticut for over twenty-nine years. He was elected pres- ident of Union College to take the place of Rev. John Blair Smifh in I799, and took upon himself the duties of president in July of that year. He died of fever in .August, 18oi, and was buried in the churchyard of the First :Pres- byterian church of Schenectady. Union's third president was Rev. Jonathan Maxcy, D. D. He was graduated at Rhode Island University, in 17 87, with high honors. He was a student of great literary and orator- ical ability. For four years he was tutor at his alma mater. In 1792 he was elected presi- dent of Rhode Island University, in which ca- pacity he served for ten years. He was elect- ed president of Union College in x8o2, but was obliged to resign in 1 8o4 on account of ill health. He became president of South Caro- lina, where he remained until his death in 182o. It is worthy of note that Union's next presi- dent, Rev. Eliphalet Nott, D. D., L. L. D., was not a college graduate, only having had a few months at Brown University. He cove;red, however, the work required for grad- uation and was granted the degree of M. A. by the same university. He was licensed to preach in x 7 94, and shortly afterward became pastor of the Presbyterian church and princi- pal of the Academy at Cherry Vatley, N.Y. In 1798 he became pastor of the First Presby- terian church of Albany, and there preached to, and became an intimate friend of, many great men of both state and nation, among them such men as Alexander Hamilton and· Aaron Burr. He delivered the funeral service of the former, which is one of the most brilliant· specimens of pulpit eloquence. Dr. N ott was elected to the presidency of Union College in 18o4, and remained in this capacity for a period of nearly sixty-two years. He was most Justly termed the ''Nestor of college presidents.\ Dr. N ott was a man of great executive ability and had a remarkable know ledge of men. He believed in govern- . ing, not· by rule followed by punishment, but by a sympathy and understanding between the master and the governed. When he became preside11t of Union College he found an elab- orate code of rules in force, rules that were constantly broken. Disorder rather than or- der had res~lted from this system and as· a consequence expulsions and suspensions were frequent. He took up his residence in the' college building in spite of the trustees' pro- test, and 1naintained discipline not by the fear of punishment, but by a unity of spirit and a mutual confidence between the president, the . faculty and the students. Dr. N ott was a man of many talents. He was not only an educator and orator, but also an inventor. He invented the self-feeding anthracite coal-stove and many other applian- ces for utilizing heat. His published writings are few. He Jives

I . l I I : I . I 6 'THE ,CONCORDIENSIS. more through his deeds than his. published works. · Rev. Laurens Perseus Hickok was Union's next president. He was vice-president of Union from 1852 to 1861, and acted as presi- dent from 1861 to 1866 during the declining years of Dr. Nott. At the latter's death he became president in name as weU as in his duties. Dr. Hickok graduated at Union in 182o, and was a classmate of vVilliam; H. Sew- ard and Taylor Lewis. 1~he active work of a college president was not to his taste, he pre- ferred to study men rather than govern them. He acted as president from 1866 to 1868 when he resigned and moved to Amherst, Mass., where he lived the life of a student and author until his death in 1888. Dr. Hickok was one of Atnerica's greatest philosophers. His influence has been felt by many great thinkers since his time. Union may well be proud of such a son. He was a man of the highest intellectual gifts, a man who adhered uncompromisingly to the right at all times, and one who possessed a pure and simple Christian faith. Uni_on's next president, Rev. .Charles Augustus Aiken, D. D., L. L. D., graduated at Dartmouth in 1846 at the head of his class. Before he was ordained in 1854 he had stud- ied abroad at Halle, Leipsic and Berlin. He was pastor at Yarmouth, Me., for five years, ~ duty which he filled faithfully and success- fully. His special gifts and training, ho,vever, had prepared him for the career of a scholar and teacher, and when he was invited by Dart- mouth College to the chair of Latin language and literature, he accepted. He filled this position for twenty-seven years when he re- ceived a call to the s•tme professorship at Princeton, which he filled for three years. He 'vas elected president of Union in 1869 where he remained for two years. In 187 r he ac- cepted the invitation to the chair of Christian ethics and apologetics in Princeton 'rheological Se.minary, resigning from his presidency at Union. Dr. Aiken's published works are many. He was a member of the American commit tee on the revision of the translation of the Old Testament. 1\'he Rev. Eliphalet Nott Potter may be said to have become president of Union by in- heritance. He was the grandson of Dr. Nott, his mother being· the only daughter o.f the famous president. He graduated at Union in I 861 and was elected to the presidency of his alma mater in 187 I, but was not inaugurated until 1872. His administration was marked by a great increase in the number of students, the formation of Union University, and the erection of the N ott l\fen1orial Hall and the Powers- Washburn Building. In the erection of these buildings he was following out the plans approved by his grandfather, Dr. Nott. In 1884 he was elected Episcopal bishop of Nebraska but declined the office. He was afterwards elected to the presidency of Hobart College and resigned his presidency at Union to accept the call. He filled this position un- til his death. The eighth president of Union is the only one who was not a clergyman. He was grad- uated at Union in 1869 and began his work of teaching at Union. In 188 3 he became pro- fessor of natural history at Rochester Univer- sity, and in 1888 was elected president of Union. Under his leadership Union pros- pered, and much was .hoped for under such a capable president. His health, however, was not equal to the strain of so much care and responsibility, and in January, 1893, he offered his resignation which was received reluctantly by the trustees a year later. We take the liberty to give here this history of our present president taken verbatim from an article entitled \ Unions' Nine Presidents,'' published 1n the \Centennial Souvenir\ by JL H. Ripton, '8o, our present Dean. We wish also to acknowledge that many of the facts in this article were taken from the same- source. '' 1,he present pre.siden t of Union College

STUDENT CONFERENCE AT NORTHFIELD.

This Conference was started through the invitation of Mr. D. L. men. Each morning a Missionary Institute is held to consider the promotion of missionary life and activity in college, while a normal class in mission study will train leaders of mission study classes in college. The various other phases of Christian activity in the insti- tutions of higher learning· will be carefully discussed by representati\VY? from th~ 9ifferent

THE CONCORDIENSIS. institutions who have gained ,experience in this fmportant work. Normal Bible classes to help leaders of stu- dent classes or groups will be conducted each day under the leadership of Henry B. Wright and Dr. Frank K. Sanders of Yale, Prof. R. A. Falconer of Halifax, N. S., Prof. Edward I. Bosworth of Oberlin, and W. D. Murray and C. C. Michener of New York City. One of the most important features of the Conference is the social and athletic life. The afternoons are devoted to recreation and are characterized by baseball games between dif- ferent colleges, tennis, bicycle runs and an athletic meet. Much good-natured rivalry be- tween the institutions is developed. The in- fluence of this Conference upon the lives of hundreds of Christian students is far-reaching and has done much to increase the religious atmosphere of the Eastern colleges. The ar- rangements for the Conference are under the direction of the St~dent Department of the In- ternational Committee, 3 West Twenty-ninth Street, New York City. .. THE HONORARY CHANCELLOR. President Raymond had endeavored to in- duce Governor Odell to act as I-Ionorary Chancellor at the coming commencetnent ex- ercises, and had received a promise to that ef- fect. The following letter explains itself. We regret very much that Mr. Odell's son is -Dot a Union man, for in that case we shoqld have His Excellency with us on commence- ment day. However, Dr. Raytnond is fortu- nate in securing the presence of so well known a man as the Reverend Dr. Huntington, rector of Grace Church, N. Y.

The Wil- liams men started off with a ·~vengence and hit O'Brien hard, scoring four runs in the first in- ning. In the tllird and fourth in11ing they added five more. This lead was too .1nuch to overcome. Union scored its first run in the fourth, wh.en ·Griswold was hit by pitcher, Rider hit for two bases, and Easton singled. Union added two more in the sixth. After Griswold ·went out from sh<>l-t to first, Rider made a single, Easton got to first ()n a fielder's choice, and both scored on a hit by Staeber. O'Brien retired in the fourth inning in favor of Bingham, who was in poor condition, being sick. He held Williams well for two in- nings, but was touched up for three consecu- tive hits in the seventh. These, with a base on balls and an error, nettecl them six runs ..

The trials for the int~r-collegiate oratorical contest were held in the chapel last Thur,sday evening. The contest itself is held annually, one representative and an alternate being sent from each college in the league, composed of Syracuse, Rochester and Union. Last year the contest was held at .Rochester, and was won by A. H. Hinman, 'oz. This year it will be held in Syracuse, on or about May 2oth. 1'he candidates for the trials were : S. B. Howe, Jr. 'o3 ; R. C. Donnan, 'o3 ; J. L. Donhauser, 'o4; and 1\'. M. Holmes, 'os. All of the orations were well delivered and the b subjects timely ones. R. C. Donnan, 'o3, was the first speaker. His subject was \Hannibal.\ In a well de- livered and finely emphasized oration he traced the destiny which followed the great Hannibal, son of Hamilcar, and the true type of tnan- hood he exhibited by his attitude when his brother, Hasdrubal, his highest joy in life, was slain. S. B. Ho\ve, Jr., also from the Senior class, ~poke next on \ The Power. of the Ideal.\ · He pointed out, in a decidedly forensic speech, man's transcendency over the brute by the power of the conception of the ideal. ''Reason,'' he said, \furnishes the data for the ideal, and the ideal determines all of man's higher existence.'' The next speaker, T. ~I. Holmes of the Sophotnore .class, delivered a very forceful ora- tion on the '' Battle of Omdurman.\ He spoke of the former ,misery of the Soudan and how the healing touch of a European hand has_ been laid on the feverish pulse of Africa. He touched on the death of Gen. Gordon and the British revenge. '' The battle of Omdurman, '' he said, ''was_ the prophecy of Africa's future. What the battle of Saratoga has been to America, Om- durman shall be to Africa.\ J. L. Donhauser, '04, the last speaker,. chose '' The 1\1onroe Doctrine\ for his subject. He said that there are three controlling influ-· ences in the political and diplomatic United States, which are second only to the Federal Constitution. They are the Declaration of Independence, \\Vashington' s farewell address, and the Monroe Doctrine. He traced very vividly the political history and the foreign relations of the United Stateg, preceding the advent of the great conservative document. After a lengthy deliberation, the judges chose S. B. Howe, Jr., to represent Union, with J. L. Donhauser as alternate. The judges were Dr. E. E. Hale, Jr., Prof. Sidney G. A.shmore and Prof. John L. March. Next M ooday morning has been set as the date on which the classes will move U•P in college meeting. The usual customs will be observed. Arrangements are in charge of Pres. Bolles of the Senior Class and of Pres, Olmsted of the Junior Class.

Address all communications to THE CoNCORDIENSIS U ni()n College, Schenectady, N. Y. bany, altho playiJ?-g other co11ewges at Albany ? We are merely asking this out of idle curiosity. Perhaps somct Williams man can afford the clue to the mystery • Friends of the students were treated to an am\].sing spectacle last Saturday afternoon. The campus was in great demand. At one end the local lacrosse players were engaged in practise ; at about the middle, base- ball enthusiasts of tender years from the '' t'ird ward'' were unmolested in their pleasant1experience of turning the campus into a public park; while on the diamond two \prep school'' teams were playing a championship game of baseball. But where was the humor in the situation, you may well ask. The humor lies in the fact that along the sidelines some I 8 college students were fotced to wait a :couple of hours. before they could play off the class game scheduled for that afternoon, because the youngsters had been given permission to use the diamond. The 1904 Garnet. It is always gratifying to hear that the Garnet has appeared and it is some- times gratifying to see it. The 1904 annual combines both these pleasures. The business manager and the board of editors have worked faithful- ly to put forward a good book and their efforts have in- deed been awarded with great success. The new features add in~erest and the publishers seem to have used a very satisfactory grade of paper and their bind- ings are strong and serviceable. There is more literary matter than usual and some of the classroom jokes and quids are very happy in their bearing. It is a pleasure to see the individual pictures of the Reverses. Union is having a hard lesson of ad· Juniors from the Medical for it shows the increasing versity to learn this year in the mat· ter of athletics. The redeeming feature of defeat is the ability to honestly say that we have by no means lost our confidence in the men who ate representing us this year. All who saw the game on the campus with New York University realize that the severe defeat which we received last Saturday at the hands of the Williams ag· gregation by no means argues inefficiency on the part of our Captain and his men. As a result of Saturday's game the wonder grows upon us why we go to vVilliamstown for every game which we play Williams ? Why will not Williams consent to a game with us on our own campus or at least at AI- University spirit and brings the several departments closer together in feelings and mutual interests. The 1904 Garnet board is certainly to be congratula· ted on \the results of their work for it is a book well worthy to represent the higher ph-.s~s of Union Col· lege life. At a meeting of the senior class, Monday morning, the class voted to adopt the class song submitted by IIowe, published in a re- cent issue of the Concordiensis.

·'rHE CONOORDIENSIS. 11 N. Y. U. 4-·· UNION 2. Old Union's Nine went down in defeat last Wednesday, before the strong contingent sent u:p the.river to represent New York University. 'Ihe game began at 4 p. m. It was a good one from start to finish, and very few errors ·were made by either team. Bingham proved his stamina as a pitcher and more than once he pulled the Garnet out of a tight 'place by his excellent ''twirling.'' The two principal features of the garne \vere Tuthill's running catch of a long fly between centre and right, and. Bingham's sensational catch of a bunted ball and double play to Rider. The game was close all the way through, and New York only won out by her timely stick work in the fifth inning. The line up was ;- Union N. Y. U.

A multitude are present-all are n1en, old, n1iddle-aged, and young. All are clad in white robes, ex· cept the young ; all flit about with snowy wings except the young. The last named are dressed in long black govn1s with square black caps. Like young eaglets their wings are too weak to venture the storms and trials of the universe. But all have run the human race of life. The judge of this court is stern, uncon1pro- 1nising and merciless. \The law, the law,\ he thunders, \we want the law.\ Seldon1 are his decisions reversed. His name is '' Busi- ness.'' No awful crime has been committed-the man is only hun1an. Yet he knows how terri- ble may be his punishment and he trembles with the fear of n1ortal, for he alone of all this company can, at this n1o1nent, feel the varying ernotions of joy and grief, can know the cares and pleasures of the hun1an heart, can shed the tears of rejoicing and of anguish. He stands alone. Is he qualified to appear with other n1ortals before that higher Court to whose decision there is no appeal to stand, a man an1ong men, and plead with human and eternal hope for mercy? Or must he, without one sin <;on- fessed, be consigned to torture of the soul and body for everlasting time-to thae'place where even the punishments of Hell are blessed ? 'T'hat is the question, and the 1nan stands appalled-horror stricken on the very thresh- old of his fate. His iron jaw is relaxed, his tall once-haughty form is bent as is a straw before a breeze. He kneels, subtnissive to the dictates of a power higher than himself. That power which he on earth called God is now his judge. ''Business\ rules supreme. Is there any hope ? Yes, If but one statement can be found with-

President Raymond announced in chapel Tuesday morning that a letter had been re- ceived fron1 'Vashh1gton, offering govern- ment work to students in the engineering de- partment of the college. This applies to seniors. The- work is of a temporary nature and only for the sun11ner, it is believed. 'fhe letter also stated that the departn1ent at vVash- ington had employed several Union men and their work had been so satisfactory that the government wished to secure some more men frotn the engineering department. President Raytnond stated further that in a conversation with State Engineer Bond the latter said he wished he had places for a lar~e number of Union college engineers as they were always reliable n1en. A list of the men in the senior class who have received stage appointments for the col- leae comn1encetnent exercises in June have b been posted and is given below, The first seven are as follows: John Albert Bolles, l(ortrignt, N.

The music for the play was composed by Dr. Hugh A. Clarke, and 'Yill be rendered under his leadership by a fine chorus and orchestra. 'rhe time, labor and expense necessary to the production of a Greek play make this a rare event. Already letters have been re- ceived from various parts of the country, stating the intention of the writers to be present, and the local demand will undoubted- ly be great. A choice of seats is therefore de- sirable. Each person accepting this invitation will have an opportunity for such choice before the public sale. An early answer is requested.
