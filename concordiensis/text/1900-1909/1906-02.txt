Or is't hut ''the w'ilcl irnaginings of a disordered hrain '' that causes us to see light in the distan'oe. \;\T e refer to the letter which appe.ars in another colun1n and which is self-explanatory. In defense of the Garnet rnanagen1ent \¥e would re1nark thusly. First. Just because Harper and Bros. publish Harper's =.\'Iaga- zine does it hold that they should contribute all the articles it contains? Second, 1'he whole tenor of the letter is based upon a technicality. T'he writer says :-''The stu- dents see the little inscription in tll e front declaring it to be issued by the Greek letter fraternities.\ The true inscription reads: Published annually by the junior n1en1bers of the Greek letter fraternities. The fraternities si1nply superintend the publication of the book as any publisher superintends his · magazine. They desire the book to be representative of the student body and try to 1nake it so. In aiding the board with contributions you do not aid the fraternities bnt your college. In refus- ing to contribute you not only tend to vveaken fhe spirit of the college but you narrow your own abilities and hi.de your literary worth under a bushel all on account \ of a n1isunderstancling in regard to the pub- lishing board. .\;ow that football has been abolished at l)nion it is ti1ne to think of what we are go- ing to do next fall to keep fro1n getting stale.

'Brooks, Capt.) the practice games with the Moha\vk team, the Union College Hockey 'Team ':iv-a!S defeated last Friday night by the Albany H~ek:ey Club. The match was held in Albany at tlre :Empire Curling Club Rink. Though it \.vas s<J!>Jr seen how the game would result, Union pla..yed a remarkably fast game, especi·ally in the s~co'lad half. ']~he size of the score ( 7-1) is due te the total 1ack of practice on the part of Union. 'J:'he.re is excel- lent material but of course this can not be de- veloped without proper trainin-g_ ·The men con- sidered the very poor lighting .s::ystem also partly responsible for the defeat. T1Le rillk was smaller than the usual rink but the ic~ W>ELS very good. A sum.mary of the game f0J!Jows: For twelve minutes the puck '\vas driven up and doyn the rink without a score 1though the play was in favor of Albany. \1111en Burlingame pushed the puck through for a, g@.al. Almost im- mediately afterward Gould macle another. Then Union braced up and kept the 1l}la;y near Albany's goal till near the end when Eas~on made a long shot and scored just before the beH rang. First half-Albany, 3; Union, :0. Early in the secol!ld 'half Gou.l:d brought the puck near Union's goal and sb(!);t, Fuller pushed it out but Gould reshot -immediately and scored. Lydorn shot a goal but it was Clisallowed because of a forward pass. Curtis (1Jn1on) did the same, but this was also disallowed. EJ. Brooks' try for goal was blocked but on the s-eeond attempt he made it. Union again took a brace and Langley shot Union's first and only go-al from the middle of the rink. Eastan carried the puck almost the whole length of the rink and shot a successful goal. Near the end of the g!L1ne during a hot scrimmage, Burlingame shot the last goal and the ga·1ne closed soon after. Score-7-1. The line-up: Union. Albany. Fuller .................... ~ .

I dubbed the new arrival the Pu.rp. He followed us a block or two, and then assumed a proprietory ownership, 'varding off others of his kind \Vho would fain have investigated us. In less time than it takes to tell of it, no amount o! persuasion could convince the Purp that his com- pany was undesirable to us. He treat€d our preemptory orders of \Go hon1e!\ \Scat!\ and so on, as a huge jest, and smiled in a knowing way \vhen \Ve enforced our remarks with a threaten- ing display of missiles, as if 'he would assure us that he too knew a practical joke when he saw one. \Darn it, we'll have to adopt the Purp ,\ said Bront. I ventured no opposition as Bront was an upperclassman. So the Purp entered into our household, an active ally of Bont's; recogniz- After the quarrel Bront \valked incessantly, al- ways, since his arrival, accompanied by the Purp. The Purp seemed. to understand Bront's mood, and soberiy refrained from ostentatious hilarity on their tramps. * * * * I \Yas calling on Her one nigh. t as was my more than occasior1al habit. When I say \Her\ I don't mean Bront's GirL The Girl I called on \Vas The One in m:y estimation. His Girl and The One were the firmest of friends. so in rny talk that evening \Vith The One our conve~rsaHon naturally drifted to Bront, His Girl and the Quarrel. I knew little about it at first, but I sat quiet-(\Yho doesn't when a Girl has the floor?) and imbibed facts. I learned that after the quarrel Hi.s Girl had become possessed of a dog, upon \Vhich she had lavished all her affection. Soon afterwards she fell sick; then one night the dog disappeared, and in spite of rewards could not be found. I asked for a description of the dog, and then be- gan to sit up and take notice. Our conversation now grew very confidential, and what we planned there, is irreleYent now, though it developes later. * * * * Bront knew as well as I did When His Girl re- ing no master but him.,.

I turned in, giving Bront an invitation

His Girl was seated on a bench at a turn of the path. She nodded and expressed her \vBHngness that I should take The One into th.e garden to gather .hesitation, good pl:oof that he \\\vas born in Albany. In his characteristk l!flannEr he did aU sorts o: ' things to poets, picking to pieces rnany instance_, of ''poetic license.\ He d\·elt at length on news-- paper in accuracies, Inistakes due to n1isfit ·word::-; some roses. So The One and I str<>lled down the and to over and under statements. path. We had just rounded a turn, when we heard an eager whine, a rush up the .gravel .and through a rift in the bushes saw the Pur-p hurl himself into the lap of Hls Girl. 'Then, not sus- pecting a trap, Bront 'himself, cussing a broken leash under breath, swung open the gate and strode swiftly down the path. At the bench he stopped short. The Purp left the Girl's lap and ran up to Bront, in a pathetically earnest way try- ing to draw him to Her. Bront hesitated, made lVIr. McElr-oy exploded the old theory of Jeffer- sonian simplicity clain1ing that Jeff. was very ' much an aristrocrat. He rode ho-rseback to his inauguration because it ·was too n1.uddy for a coach. The popular idea of Henry VIII was also dealt with rather severely. Mr. lVIcE:lroy said that he haLl been brought up to believe Henry had but t\YO fads, murder and n1.atrilnony, and \Vas not, on the whole a very reputable citizen, which he had later found \vas not entirely true. His reference to Davy an impulsive step forward and --- I swear I'll Crockett's farnous saying, ''Be sure you are right. never forgive that cloud. then go ahead,\ created a laugh an1ong those in • • * • When in my capacity of Dest Man, I was fixing Bront up for The Wedding, for the t\hirtiet'h time he expressed his regret that The One and I were not the second couple for a double ·wedding. I thought first to tell him about The Other One, but decided to let him remain in ign<>rance for the pres.ent. The remem.berance of the half cut leash caused me to look at the Purp and wink. The Purp smiled, and as he is happy I'm sure he'll say noth- ing of the conspiracy to Bront. Paul Pringle, '08. Are you going- to the dances? · Mr. McElroy Lectures Wm. H. M•cE1roy, '60, delivered a very interesting talk in chapel last Friday afternoo=n. His subject was \Some Interesting Inaccuracies\ and he treated it in his O\\'n inimital5le manner. He started with the beginnig of things and showed the· inaccuracy of the Adam. and Eve \apple theory''\ by .saying that the apple ''VRS an outgro\\'th of the crab appl·?, which is too sour to tem.pt anyone. In relation to orato-rical \breaks\ he spoke of Sheridan being clailned as an Ohio product, al- .. whose 1ninds the men1ory of that pleasing dramd is still green. The talk was thoroughly enjoyecl by all who \ver.~ present and any further opportunity to hear hiln again ·will be welcomed by all.

Yet, being one of a. fairly numerous body of stu- dents, holding some\vhat similar views concerning the \Garnet\ and its publication, to those set forth by \A Student\ in last week's C'oncordiensis I wisJ:J. to make just this On€ plea for our sanity. \Ve feel safe in stating that -vve have these two facts: First, the neutrals ha Ye no representative on the Garnet Board; second, on the title page ot the Garnet there is this statement: \Published an- nually by the Greek letter fraternities of linion College.'' It seems evident that apparently and in fact, so far as n1anagement is concerned, the Garnet is a Greek lette·r fraternity publication. Then is the conclusion unreasonable that, eithe-r the terms \Greek letter fraternity of Union College' and 'Un- ion College' are equivalent, in which case the neu- trals are zero, or the Garnet is not truly a Colleg~~ publication? In either case I respectfully leave it to your fairness, kind reader, to deter1nine the amount of support we ought to be expected to give. \Ve 1nake no claim .. to a natural right to officially take part in the publication of the Garnet. It was founded by the Greek letter fraternities. It is \Vithin their power to withold it or to give it to thr~ College. It has seemed, however, to need the cor- dial support of a united student body. Because of this fact, but probably more because of the growth of true college spirit, fraternity men have come to think of the Garnet as pre-eminently a college pub- lication. If it is to be· thi:s in fact, it seems clear to us that it must be published not by the junior::; of the Greek 1letter ftaterniti€s but by the· juntor class oif Union CoHege. If it i:s not so pub'l.ished it has no clahn on H::te coHege spirit of neutrals. It is still true tba t \a hoq.se divided again:st itself cannot stand.\ F'0r our own sakes, but, rn0re than that, for the good of Old Uniron., we hope that in this field, if it is a colle·ge ·field, Union's sons will h·~ brothers, that I:J:O body of her sG>ns shall deny to any one of the rest of her sons the right to serve her so far as he has ability and is wHling. We believe, ho\.vever, that these ends should be attained not by a controversy, nor by boycott, but by peace. War among the students and among alun1ni \YOrks ruin to the College. Because of this belief we have supported the Garnet in the past, and though there can be no romn for doubt that ou1~ support would naturally be more enthusiastic if we \vere not officially ignored, we will support it nO\\r. W'e are willing to leave it to the fairness of Greek letter fraternity men to judge of the spirit we ha V'! shown in supporting the Garnet under these condi- tions, and we believe that their loyalty to the Col- lege '\Vill before long lead them to settle the matter rightly.

No tnore ex·cuses for be- ing late to chapel and rec~tations because the fa.culty watches and ours don't agree. Peculiar instn.nnents, too, those faculty watches are. vvhen you cotn·e to consider it. They are ahvays fast at the beginning o£ the hour and invariably slow at the end. Strange, isn't it, when yon to stop to chew t'he reflective chewing gtun'? , But this isn't a treatise on watches. \V e don't feel qualified to give expert testitnony thereupon. The burden of our song is the chapel bell, or bells, which are supposed to regu- late the titne of professor and student alike. That they failed for several days this week is our cue. So1ne one, actuated bv so1ne .I youth fnl in1pulse, perpetrated that ancient and honorable ( ?) child's trick of doctoring the bells. The why and the wherefor. vve do not profess to know. 1he caper itself is so old here at L,. nion that it vvas covered with n1oss years ago. It should have he en pensioned in the days of Dr. N ott. It is the chapel bells that all of us con1e to depend upon to n1ake classes and chape.l. If they do not ring, the whole 1nechinisn1 of the college is thrown out of gear. It isn't a particularly inspiring job. to get to a class roo111 with the th~rn1o1neter doing the l1igh dive. and then to hover around the door vvaiting for another class to get out. Nor is it a pleasure to rush in to a class roorn sev- eral 1ninutes after roll-call. In view of the fanner, at any rate, we vvould respectfully request our little playn1ate-s, in the na1ne of a frost-bitten student body, to desist frotn their exercises until son1e of these baltnv ,./ clays when it is about \So in the shade.\ Then we can afford to wait for classes, a11d probably will, if we follow a strong preced- ent.

The baseball tean1 has exceUent prospects of a \skin\ dian1ond for its spring gan1bols. :VVhy not go a step n1ore in this policy of in~provetnent and furnish the tea111, when it begins to play, with an official score- keeper. This idea is by no n1eans as use- less as sotne would believe. The system that has been in vogue has lead to endless confusion. Hardly has the record of any two games been kept by the sa1ne 1nan, and son1etimes, not at all. Two years ago vve had to wait well into the fall to n1ake out the tean1 averages, because there was no score kept of the Han1ilton gatne and it -vvas through the kindness of the Han1ilton nJan- agetnent that we obtained the records, at all. An official score-keeper~ with one sys- tem, would not only be an advance in the n1anagen1ent of the tean1, but would also be of great assistance to the college publi- cations in giving to the student bodv the records of the tean1. The 1909 basket ball tean1 has heen suc- cessful in getting ga n1es and in a con ple of instances, have played in our \gyn1.\ This proves that basket ball can be played there but the general effect -was to ren1ind one of a gan1e of tennis on a ping pong table, if w~ may be pardoned for going to ancient history for our figures. .A .. s long as we arc in such cratnped quarters, just so long- n1ust the college fail to be represented in a sport which all other co lieg-es have so 'heartilv L ~ taken up. ...

Fron1 all indications the second of these affairs is going to be even more of a success than the first. It is to be hoped so. at any rate. fot the various co1nn1ittees hav·e worked hard. and deserve the best that the college can do by thetn. The Soiree, especially, is in. the nature of a yenture as regards the place of holding it. LAW SCHOOL NOTES. ~ew ~Ien-X ew Building in Prospect The second sernester of the department of law began.

Special cars left fro1n the college grounds at nine o'clock and the students pleasure bent, sing- ing college songs, \Vt>re soon conveyed to the Club House. The dance was s1nall but very enjoyable, and the advantage of the Golf Club House over former places of holding Junior ::E-Iops cannot be overestimated. About forty couples, representing· every branch of college activity were present. The music \Vas furnished by Gioscia's orchestra of six pieces, and it was, if anything, above the usual excellent standard.

The Lecture. F'riday morning at 10 o'clock Hon. Hamilton Wright Mabie delivered, .in his happiest vein, a lecture on Abra'.t1a1n Lincoln entitled \The Educa- tion of a hero.\ He spoke feelingly about Lincoln's qualities as a hero. How he steered the ship of state in a time fraught with the greatest peril to the Union. He told stories \\'.hic'h illustrated Lincoln's kind- ness and good nature under the most extenuating circumstances.

The Philoma- thean team consisting of Putnam, '06, W'right, '07. and Hanigan, '08, led off the attack by Putnam's summarizing the President's policy and decrying the evils of the present system.

Mr. Crosby threatened to crack his only joke at this point, and in part he kept his \\Vord. He Herbs were found which were succulent to a cer- tain extent, ancl a fire was made at evening over which tea could be cooked . Trouble was experienced with mirages, and cracked the joke; but he was too modest, as his many valuable miles lost on this account. Final- lecture bristled throughout with witticisms. H·e ly, after the caravan had proceeded up a river said: \Like the old English lecturer I might say, valley about twenty days march, the stream took 'Before such a cultured audience I d·o not think a turn in the wrong direction.

T·wo of the men were the old cities. former seats of great empires- sent down the river for aid, and at a critical time cities like Bokhara and Kashgar. The border tribes on the Thibetan frontier were kundis, not prepossessing in appearance, but well disposed to- ward strangers, so Mr. Crosby stated. Access to sacred Lassa has in former times been tried by adv€n turesome spirits in native disguise, but this has in most cases proved fatal, so the lec- turer decided the best thing '\\\'as to \butt in\ un- der proper colors. He met with a Frenchman. Captain Ajuenier. with whom he made the entire journey. They started out with five men and a donkey and horse they rctu·rned with a relief party of natives. A yak caravan was organized and the expedi- tion again started out. The plateau was safely crossed and the descent made into Thibetan ter- ritory. The Thibetans are an extremely religious peo- ple and prayer wheels and statutes to saints abound everywhere. The journey hnpressed :Mr. Crosby especially with three things. The first concerned an irri- gated country. Civilization in a -country made fertile by systems of irrigation is different In be- ------·--------------------------------------- -------- ------------

This civilization dlevel'ops rapidly, but it is very weak against outsid .. e attack character changes because of the deadly ·l·egularity of certain plenty and the inhabitants become slack in every way. The card holll.se fate of certain empires was due to this fact, of the hardy 1volf type coming and overthrow-ing the po\\ver of the sheep type. Secondly, ,the monastic system is very similar to that of anei;ent Europe, and is a product of ex- trem poverty; a poverty which holds no hope except the qu.i•et retreat of rnoHasUe life. It has survived lon.g:e.r in Thibet because of the continu- ance of poverty. Another s~stem, produced by this extreme pov- erty is the ;p olygam system of marriage. For only certain sections of Thibet are arable. These sections 'have descended from father to son for generations. If there are several sons their liv- ing must an come from. the same patdn~ony, so they take among them but one wife. It is thus a system of necessity not of preference. M.r. Crosby said that the longer he staid in Thibet and sa,,. ho1v matters stood, the more he was impressed \Vith the fact that a traveller should be charitable first, last and all the time. P.

Fairchild of Albany will deliver an il- lustrated lecture on the True Sportsman or the Eight Great Laws of Sport. The lecture is given EXTRA under the ausptces of the Athletic Board and will be welil worth the time spent in hearing a. Many slides will :be shown including several of Unien's last fall's f,ootball games which, however, will have no bearing on the su:Qject rnatter of the lecture. T'he material of the lecture is based on the fol- lowing great laws Qf sport: Law 1. Follow sport for spores .sake, and be a sportsman. Get skill, and· sharpen up your wits. Get strength but 1\.eep within your strength. Law 2. ·Play the game within the rules, and lose or win with honor. Law 3. True Sportsmen are courteous and friendly in their .s:port. Law 4. A sportsman must have courage, a coward is not wo~·thy of the name. Law. 5. The umpire shall decide the play. Law 6. Honor for the victors, but no derision for the vanquished. Law 7. The trl!l.e sportsman is a good loser in 'his games. Law 8. The sportsman may have pride in his success but not conceit. Mr. Fairchild has invented a special camera for this photograph, and bas lectured on \photo- graphic observation of human life\ in Fogg Museum, Harvard, before the Economic Club, and in Yale, Brown~ Tuts, Columbia, Colgate and University of Pennsylvania. The camera carries three dozen glass plates which can be all exposed inside of one minute. Duffey's 100 yards in 9 3-5 seconds will be shown, and his loss of the world's record discussed.

After the concert, wldch was very ~uccessful, the 1ne1n- l.Jer8 of several of the house parties were given af- t.:rrJ0on teas.

Law 5-The umpire shall decide the play. Law 6-Honor for the victors, but no derision for the vanquished. Law 7--Tke true sportsman is a good loser in his game. Law 8-The sportsman m:ay have pride in his success, but not conceit. In discussing the first law occasion was taken to sco-re Duffy of Georgetown, whose record of 9 3-5 seconds for the hundred yards does not stand Hl amateur records, since Duffy had already enteded the ranks of profess.ionais. Excellent pictures covering every phase of the race were shown. Mr. Fairchild spoke of the tendency to win merely for the sake of winning. He showen by specific exam•ples how one contestant in a race may injure his competitor so as to pffectually debar from first place. Another subject taken up was the matter of losing a race so that another runner might w·in his letter. One slide gave a view of two men from the same college holding first and second places. The man with the letter on 'his jersey could have won with ease, hut he deliberately slowed up to allow his fellow-student to win first place. Though the act may be highly courteous to the winner, it is not a fulfilment of the wish of the spectator to see the best sport. In speaking of courtesy among true sportsmen, Mr. Fairchild paid a deserved tribute to the Eng- lishmlan, vvho loves sport for the pleasure there is in it. GREAT LA\VS OF SPOitT!'

The views were of such a character as to prove e:l ear- ly that the decision of the judges was correct in a warding second ·place to Moulton and third to Snick.

In a short time the Seniors ordered that once over the te1.;.race, the combatant must stay there. It took almut a qua,rter of an hour's fighting to put nearly all the Sophonmres over, with many of the Freslnner~ still saf.e, and on these grounds the fight ·was awr.rded to the Frosh.

HONORABLE TRADITIONS The following was recently given as a class oration by a Senior. On request of the class he has consented to publish it: What prompted Ghancellor Day, on looking around our campus, to remark, \I would g.ive a million dollars to have one of these old buildings at Syracuse\ ?

Pharmacy Notes Probably no feature in our coUege life is so sadly lacking as that of fraternal intercourse or sociability. While a gen.eral feeling of brother- liness and good fellowship seems always to exist among all of our fel1lows yet it certainly would be a great benefit to an concerned if our course were such that fraternities, debating societies, etc., might be formed. Of course, the acquiring of a pha:~:Inaceu tic~tl education. is the primary object and purpose for which we are here, but at the same time it could do no harm to develope a bit charnpions'hip at ERnsas City last week in three of literary ability as well.

Union Loses Belay Race. At the b~g athletic meet he1d in Troy, Wednes- day ni.ght under the auspices ·of the Troy Y. M. C. A., Union lost her relay race to the four runners sent d:ovv'n by Colgate. The race was a hard one to lose, but Col'gate seemed to have slightly the ' better of it all the way through. By the time that eur race was announced, there were quite a number Gf Union men at the Armory, although not nearly as many as there should have been. The distance was one mile, each man of the tea1n running a {]:uarter, or three times around the track. Waldron -was the first relay for the Garnet aiJ.d ran a pretty race. H'e held his man well until just at the finish, when he lost a little ground. Parsons took the· second and held the sa.me posi- tion with his man throughout, this relay being, perhaps, the prettiest of all, as the 1nen were shoulder to shoulder during the three laps. Streibert was the third runner but was unable· to hold his man so successfully, and lost considerable ground. On the last relay, Wait ran a beautiful race but killed hhnself early in the run.At the start he was several :yards behind but! by hard spurt- ing passed his man before the end of the first lap anJ. held hiln safe for some time. On the third round, however, he tired from his ex;tra work, and fell behind, finishing nearly twenty yards in the QUALITY Shoes bearing tbis trade-:rmtrk hav-e all the elements that go to make up the \bigh-grade shoe.\ Sold only at QlJIRI'S SHOE STORE. 311 S'lATE, COR.
