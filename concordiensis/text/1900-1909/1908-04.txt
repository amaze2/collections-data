THE CoNcORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, APRIL 7, 1908 .1\.. \T L~O. 21 SHOULD UNION HAVE A CREW? ' This question has ~een discussed quite widely on the hill since .the announcement that S.chenec- tady was to have a boat club which would own a shell. It see:rns, on ihe first consideration of the question, that to su,[)port a crew here would be all but in1p·us si ble., b\llt considering all the advan- tages accruing .fronJ: it tD the college, the impos- sibility slowly is lost sight of. 0 f course the rovii:ng· nmchines and other ap- paratus incident to the training would cost quite a sum of n10N.ey aH.cl besides, the support of the crew would cost even n1ore than son1e of our other branches of .athletics. The training table wouh1 count as the n1ost important item·, but how is it that Union has put J1er best football teams in the field when n-o sueh thing as a training table had even been con s&dere d here. The apparatus could be gradually acquired and the expens2 account l\ept within reasona lJl e bounds by a little juc1 icial management. We vvould most assuredly need a coach, but the fellows are nnt found wanting when asl<ed to sulls cribe for anything that is ad- vantageous to their O\\'n and the college's wel- fare. We are considering this matter from the stand- point that the college \\Vi1l be able to get the use of the ue\v shel'l and boathouse in so far as the crew is concerned, and surely the club wi 11 tal\e great interest in such a thin.g. The advantages to the college xvonlc1 be numerous. In addition to increasing the ren()wn {)f our already famous in- stitution, fellows wh·o are desirous of attending a small college vvoH1c1 be influenced to come to that place where they have something out of the ordinary, som.eth in~; that other similar in stitu- Uons are una 1Jle to offer and which is one of the n1ost popular sports in tne world. Nothing nee\1 be said as to the p}lysical and psychical advan- tages that are attendant upon rowing. Not only con1c1 the college enter inter-collegiate boat races bnt class crews organized in time and after the first experiment, if successful, we need not doubt but that with the aid of our ahnnni there w.oulcl appear on the banl\s of the Mohawk a college boathouse \Yith all moclerR fix- tures. We are surely wen fittPtl to UIHlertake this by our situation on the 1\ioh a wlz. T lle river is v;ell fitted to train on ancl when such things as flotillas are undertal\en \Ye have Saratoga Lake quite handy where, in June, the fellows and their friends 1night beta1\.e themselves to watch an annual aquatic carnivaL The argument n1ay be advanced that \Ye have too many sports as it is. Onr past basketball sea- son wa;s not very successful and \Ye cou1cl do no bet- ter than the larger colleges in dropping that sport and at least atte1npting to vut' a successful crew into operation. \W 7 e shou Ttl not get on r hop.2.s raised for a speedy success. for rowing is a sport that IDUSt develop and, too, rather slowly. On the whole, it seems best to give this idea a trial whether successful or not as it can do 110 harm and possibly may overcome many of our preseJ!.t disacl vantages.-'09. THE SENIOR BALL. Chainnan Shelley of the Senior Ball Committee has finally gained perntission of the trustees to hold the Senior Ball in the library building. For several sea..son.s past this privilege bas been re- fused and this step indicates that those in power realize that at least one dance should be given in some college building as a wholly college dance. Certain conditions are attached but which wili give distinction to the function rather than de- tract from it. The fraternities and neutral organ- izations must have each a booth. 'These booths will be in the recesses between the b()okcases and will give a clelig-htful e.ffect to the who:c' scheme. Besides the honorary patronesses each fraternity will be represented by four patronesses. In all probaq·ility, the dance \\Yill be one of the most suc- cessful of its kind ever given here. The con1mit- tee in charge is Shelley, chairman; Parsons and Fullerton.

Judg~ Samuel W . .Tackson, aged 87 ye.us, the oldest member of the Schenectady Cour.ty Bar, and ·one of the best known men in the city, d:ed at his residence, 27 Washington Avenue, Friday n1orning at 11 o'clock, after an iliness of over three months. His condition was not con.sidered serious until about ten clays ago, when he was confined to his bed. Mr. Jackson was born in the town of Palatine. Montgomery county, June 28, 1821. His father, Allan H. Jacl\:son, a native of the same county, \Vas graduated from West Po:n t, and was by l}TO- fession a civil engineer, having at one time been chief of the corps of engineers of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad, and subsequently of the Central Railroad cf New Jersey. After he had received l~is academic education, Samuel W. Jacks·on entered the Sophomore class of Union College in 1840, ancl was graduated with honors in 1842. He began his legal ·career :n the ,office of Alex- ander Sheldon, previ·ous to entering college, and after graduating completed his legal course in the office of Paige & Potter in Schenectady. In 1843 he was licen.secl as an attorney, under the old regime, and as a counsellor in 1846. He first practiced his profession at Gilhoa, Scho- harie county, and continued his legal business there until 1850, when he retired because of ill health. He resumed his profe~s ion in 1856, having recovered his health, and opened an office in New York. He returned to Schenectady in 1858, where he had since remained. He became one of the best l\:nown men in Schenectady and had been the local legai representative of the New Yol'k Central for the past forty years. In 1867 he was appointed by Judge Jackson is survived by his widow and five children; M.rs. H. V. N. Phillips, Mrs. Nelson W. Wait and John T. Jackso-n of Schenectady; Mrs. Harry W. Preston of Elmira, and Lieuten- ant Frank P. Jackson, U. S. A. The funeral will be held fron1 hi.s late residence on Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock. Rev. B. W. R. Tayler will officiate. lntennen t w !.ll be in St. George's Cen1etery. WITH THE DEBATERS. During the past weel{ debating work has been at the zenith of exciten1ent in preparation for the Allison-Foote debate which is to take place dur- ing the last part of the we2k beginning April 13. The :fi;nal date tas not been decided upon as yet. Both societies l:ave been holding try-out de- bates almost daily. The Ac1elphics held their :final try-out on last Thursday with Dr. Hoffman and Dr. March as jtulges, to select the debaters who will represent their scciety in the annual inter-society debate. The tea1n chosen by the judges at that tin1e consists of Weyreuch '08, La Crosse '08, Mould '09 and Davie.s '08 as alternate. The Philomatheans held their final try-out on Friday afternoon at 3 o'clock. The judges were Dr. Hoffman and Prof. Bennett, who selected as the three men to present the case for the PhHo- matheans, Hanigan '08, S. lVI. Cavert '10 and Cohen '11. The question for the c~e1J2.te as submitted by the Adelphic S-ociety is: Resolved, That the exclusion of the Chinese un- der the present system. is detrilnental to the best interests of the country. The Philomatheans have decided to uphold the negative side of the ques- tion. Gov.~rnor Hoffman to fill the unexpired term of Interest is also being aroused in the inter-eel- Justice Rosecrans of the Supreme Court. He was legiate debate with Rutgers to be held in New appointed a me1nber of the Constitutional Con- Brunswick on May 13. The Garnet team will be vention in 1872, , On April 10, 1860, he was elected vestryman of St. George's Church and served in this office until April 7, 1874, when he wa.s elected warden. He remained in that capacity until his death. On .April 23, 1862, he married Miss Louisa Pot- ter, niece of Judge Platt Potter. pdcl{ed shortly after the Allison-Foote debate. Among small colleges, Rutgers puts up one of the very best debating teams in the country. She has an unparelleled record never having been beaten in recent years. However, our recent vic- tory over Hamilton augurs \vell for breaking Rut- gers' enviable record.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 9 KlNGS ALONG THE EUPHRATES. -·-··------- On Friday afternoon Rev. G. Putnam Cady gave his last of a series of lectures on ancient history, choosing for his topic, \Kings Along the Eu- phrates.'' He gave us a vivid description of their deeds, their influence· on L1e history of Judea and lsrael and briefly related how the politics of these early nations became so closely intermingled. A very interesting feature of Mr. Cady's lecture wa:.s his descriptio::.1 of the power of t:~ese ancient Assyrian n1onarcls, telling of tl:dr cJnqnests, tributes taken from the conquered, and placing special stre3s on the h·ideous and repulsive meth- ods used by these lTIOnarchs in C1e treatment or their captive.s. Sargon II, however, was an exc2p- tion to this rule. He scattered the conquered. peo- P Ie over his domains and placed his O\Vn pe~)ple in the t2rritory conquered. In telling ·Of the prac- tices cf these ancient As~.yrians lV~r. Cacly s:1y.s that ninety per cent. of ttese m(uarc'1s were • cruel and harsh to the very extreme. life cunnti.ng hut little in their desire for glory. In connection with the de.scription of these Mr. Cady tells of their repeated attempt3 to conqL:er the Hittites, and in whom they found a foeman worthy of their steel. Little is known of the Hitt- ites, although several tablets have been fmlnd relating to their history, but up to t!-.e preseat tim.e no one has been able to decipher them. The history of Assyria is in 1nany ways clo.sely connected with that of Judea and Israel. The Assyrians made repeated marches into their ter- ritory destroying and conquering, until finally in SKULL AND SH l.ELD DANCE. -·-· ~-- Last Friday evening, April 3d, the SkHH aiHl .Shield Society held its regular annual dance in Yates's Boathouse The dance was well attenclecl by the members of the society and the foHowing guests were present: The MLsses F·eat1ilerston- l~aug.h, E.

They suffered terribly at the hands of these monarcl:s and few can imagine the joy of the people in Israel and Judea at the down- fall .of these ldngs along the Euphrates.. They compared their power to- that of the Cedars of Lebanon and their destruction to the destruction ·of the trees. At the close of the lecture the students gavr~ Mr. Cady a good hearty cheer in keen apprec~a- tion of his lectures. -------- COLLEGE MEETING. College meeting was held as usual after chapel on lad Monday morning. Motion was· made, sec- onded and carried unanimously that resolutions be sent to the Director of R. P.

=Io==========~T~H~· E~;. CONCORDIEN SIS 1881.-Writing in a Charleston, S. C., special to the Chicago Record-Herald, William. E. Curtis says of United States Senator-elect Frank B. Gary, who was a member of the class of 188£ Union Col- ' lege: \Frank B. Gary, the new Senator from South Carolina, who has just been elected to :complete the term of the late Mr .. Latimer, whirch expires March 4, 1909, .comes from a very large and in:tiu- ential family and claims descent from Robert Druce, John Knox and John Withersponn. Senator Gary's father was a physician in .Abbeville coun- ty in the northwestern :part of the State, and he is a nephew of the late General l\i.ark Gary, a picturesque character of the secession and recon- struction periods, who wa.s a m.ajor general of cav- alry in Wade Hampton's Legion, a brilliant sol- dier, a recldess leader and a hard fighte1·. He was famous for his profanity and his ungovernable temper. There was no fiercer fire-eater in all the South, and he was mixed up in a dozen duels. After the overthrow of the Republicans in t11is State and the establishment of what was known as the Hampton oligarchy, General Gary quarreled with his former commander because he did not receive the political recognition that he thought he was entitled to, and, although the family belonged to the old slave-holding aristocracy, General Gary and all his relatives joined Tillman and the '\wool hats\ in the overthrow of Hampton. Under Gen- eral Hampton's \oligarchy'' none but the aristoc- racy of the State and th()se who had distinguished themselves in the Confederate Army were recog- nized by appointments to office. The ordinary farmers were ignored, although ther were in a very large majority. Tillman ·organized them through the· Farmers' Alliance; he aroused them to a sense of their rights, and he swept Hampton, Butler and all the rest of the aristocrats out of power. Since then the Gary family have enjoyed unusual political prosperity, and it is declared that they have held more offices than any other family in the State. John Gary Evans, a cousin of the new Senator, has been Tillman's first lieutenant. He has been Governor and a member of the Legislature con- tinuously for years and is now one of the leading -·~-~~ ------~~- ·-- - ~-,..,. • -.-........c ......... --.W_.._ ~ ..... \'\'¥-~- -- ---------- ,._ __ -'-~- '-• -- - candidates f.or the fulili term in the United States Serrate. Two brothers of Senator Gary are on the State bench. En~est Ga.ry i:s a judge o:f the Supreme Court and Eug:ene G~uy ts a judge ·Of the Superior Court and it was his vote that eonflrmed what is called th.2 Tillrnan constitution of South Carolina. vVhen the question WB.S first brought before it the court ·decided agah1st the constitu- ti-on two to one. Judge McGowan's terp:l expired shortly afterward and Ertgene Gary was appointed to his place. By son1e technicality the question wa.s revivec1 and the court reversed itself, confirm- ing the constitution by Gary's ·vote, which has earned the evLTlasting gratitude and .support ot · Senator Tillman.\ STUDENTS GO ON STRIKE. The entire stn~1ent 1Jor1y of N·e w York University went on strike and rcfusell to a tt e llll their recita- tions to voice a pretest against tlle 3uspension of Alfred Young, president of the Jnntor Cl ass. Young's suspension was the result of the D.azing of Henry Bloch, a freshman, who was clucked in the campus fountain yesterday. Bloch has been un- popular and it is said that s01ne of the students have asked his father to tal~e him out of tl~e nniversity.-Ex. WITH THE CHILDREN. La.st week Judge Ohnstead of New Yorl{ used an original method in dealing with certain dis- orderly college Freshmen who had acted E 1\e fools and ruffians in a public vlace. He consigned them to the care of the Children's Society, \along with lost babies and runaway girls and b-oys who haven't any parents to spank them,\ as t'he Trib· une expresses it.

' '· ' .. ' ! . THE CONC·ORDIENSLS 11 THE IDOL P:ROFANE:D. TRACK. Vandals Paint Idol and W.reck Bullet,in Boards. ----~·--- Last Saturday night son1e vandals, who are as Y·~ t unknown, visiterl. the eam,pus, and, after giv- ing the ''Idol\ a coat of paint and daubing R. P. I. on it in .several places, ].Jroeeeded to the colleg\~ bulletin board, where they tore off aH the n:)- tices anrl sera wled \R.enssela( r\ on it, broke the glass front to the F'acnlty bulletin boa1·d and des- troyed all the noticeS' it contained. After com- rruitting these acts of van.dalis.m., they departed, leaving· scarcely any trace of th·dr identity, thougll all evidences po-int to students of R. P. I. as the guilty parties, especiaDy .so, as several were seen in town Satur'day evening .and later R. P. l. yd}s were heard near the college grounds. Responding to a caH from Captain Parsons for men for outdoor track work, which consists now chiefly in cross-country runs, about a dozen fel- lows came out the first day, but they must have lost courage, for most of them \stayed in\ the next few days. That is not the way to produce a good track team. To do that, work must be comn1enced early and practicing done continually :=tnd persistently. Everyone who has any ability at all in that way needs to come out and help along Indeed, so deep is the feeling that R. P. I. n1en were cone= rned, that, at chapel meeting M,onday 1norning, a m.otion was passed to send a resolu- tion to R. P. I. student body demanding a thorough investigation aB.d declal'ing a severance of athletic relations nn til the m·atter is satisfac- torily adjusted. It is, however, by no m,eans C·= rtain that t11e outrage was not COHlilritted either by local hood- lums or lJy parties wishing to create 8~ bad feeling between the two institn tions, and, acting on this theory, a committee has be.~n appointed by Presi- dent Weyrauch to f'uUy investigate the facts. --· ----1-.-- LAW SCHOOL NOTES. -------- June 3 has been s-et as the day for the fiftY· eighth annual commencement. Judge Irving J. Vann of the Court of Appeals and lecturer at Syracuse University Law S·chool is delivering his ann ua1 course of lectures on In- surance Law. The elusive examination on Neg:Jtiable Instnla 1nents is again a creature ·of the uncertain future. A nu1nber of the Law School men attended the concert given by the Hmnilton Glee and Instru- mental Clubs at Centennial Hall last Tuesday evening, which was under the direction of Ben- nett '08, and Nellis '08, both of the class of 1906 of Hamilton.

I spent four very happy years in 'Old Dorp' and took my B. A. in 'R5. \Prof. Stephen B. Griswold of the Albany Law School must be a distant relative.

K. l\1ould of Schenectady was ad- j:n dged the best individual de~:>!l:cer of the six con- tc·stants in the ann u:al Allison Fo-ote debate held ·w·ectnesday evening tn the College chapel, and the P1tilomathean S oci:ety, defending the negative, of 1Llf:: question under debate, w·1.3 gr-anted the decis- lc.llA for having l)resented the strongest argument as a tean1. The Plrlilo-n1atll0·::nr speakers are an rr.'sidents of Sellen ectady a:1d gradttates of the local High SchooL The debate was upon the question: \Resolved T 1 1at the exclusion of the Chinese from the United S i a tes, under the present sy::)tnn, is detrin1entaJ tu the best interests of the conn try.\ The affir- native was upheld by the Ade!phic speakers, and -the· Philomathean.:; cont'ended for the Hegative. Eid win L. La Crosse opened t!1e de bate for the []_).:;] rmative, after having be2n introduced by A. V. V. Rayn1ond, Jr., '08. La C1 osse outlined e1e P')Sition to be followed by the~ affinnative, viz: tl:rtt the exclusio-n of Chinese fro1n this country, u11der the present systen1, is d.E•trimental to ottr econon1ic, ethical aad social, ana })Olitical inLer- ~f:lts. He said that our econon1lr interest·; \VonlJ be best suhserved by :i.la ving Ch inan1en con1e into c-ur country to till the land wr.~ch is at present lllicnltivated, in which sphel'e they would n1eet no o ]'position fron1 white laborers. R.nd would not, Uierefore, enter into con1petitio11 with t1Hnn. He fm~ther said 1hat the Chinese c0111 d not possibly swamp out our civilization, bee ::mBe the in1migra- tion into this country would come only fron1 a 1\-'w districts of the Chinese 01npire. Harry A. Cohen, in opening the d0'bate for tllt~ rH'gative, carefully uutlined thE' ca-;se as it would l:P presented by that side-that the question c~n:­ C!'l'lled Chinese laborers only, &D d that in1n1igra- tit•ll of these was undesirable, 8S it would debase A n1erican labor. E. W. K. :vrould, '09, in rontinning the debate fu1 the affirn1ativ.e s:howed how it would be ethic· ally and .soda1ly advantageous to ad1nit the China- l!ltll to this country, and especially that -class 8 :)ove the laborer, containing sa lesrnen, the clergy, Lankers, etc. S. M. Cavert, '10, then took up the undesirability of the Chinament as a citizen. He said that 'he was n1oral'ly debased, that he gan1bled, s1noked opiun1, and pronrulgated vice nn1ong all of tl1e f!{:\oplie with: whom he can1e into contact. lVL H. \Ver-raucl1, '08, then closed the direct argu- n:ten t for the affirmative. He said that the poor ... ~,ay in which exiBting laws had been admit1istered against the ''exempt\ class had aroused a spirit nf antagonis1n in China tl1at had culn1inated in a boycott upon An1erlcan goods. He declared that tlds -occasi,oRed an annual loss of $31,000,000 to tb e United .States, or 60 per cent. of the trade ru rrner~y had with China. The direct argun1Emt was closed by T. E. Hani- gan, '08. He made a plea for C1e l)reser- \'.'ation of the integrity of the American race, and c~eclared that the enormous influx of Chinan1en, lmde:r less restriction would result in obliterating the A1ne1dcans as a race fron1 thP earth. Rebuttal speeches followed a-nd at the close of tl;.e debate the decision was rendered by Hon. Danforth E. Ainsworth, acting for the board -of jP dges, the other two n1e1nbers being Dr. CI1ar1es F. Wheelock and W. C. Andrews. The College Glee Club filled in the intern1ission w:th s.everal selections.

Only th()se who have actually gone among an- other P'eople and have tried to .master their language can have an adequate idea of the difficulties that the bright, attractiv·e Porto Rican youngster meets with in getting a practica1l knowl· edge of English. After a year spent in the weli- equ.ipped Ponce High School and several months as director of music and ~eacher of the first year English at the Insular Nonnal School, I can only wonder at the amazing rapidity with which these new Americans learn and use English. After • reading aloud in class \The Courtship of Miles Standish,\ \H·ia wa~ha,\ \The Wonder Book,\ 'Rip Van ·winkle\ and the lives of Longfellow, Haw- thorne and Irving-, we have just finished the mid- year examinations at the Normal .School, and when I firs·t l-ooked at the pile of sixty-odd ten- page papers in English I was by no means elated at the prospect of correcting them, but as almost every paper contained several sn1iles and perhaps at least one laugh, I carefully copied artd saved the various sentences and .send them unaltered. Only those cullled fr·Oln the best papers are in- clude-d, for, of course, a mere jargon <Jf gram- matical blunders would tend rather to .mal{e a teacher weep, and it is only fair to say that the mistakes are often logical translati<Jns of Spanish into Engli.sh. \Miles Standish didn't dare to ask another Pur- itan maiden to marry him and she didn't.\ \King Midas gave his daughter a sweet kiss in her face and turned her into a golden statute.\ ''Hawthorne wrote 'The House of Seven Gabbles.' \ \Then he died, leaving his memory.\ Wasn·t that thought- ful of him? But Longfellow also had hard luck and ''died, fuld of sentiment.\ \Rip Van Winlde was a g-ood naturalist\ in place of \good-natured fellow.\ ''He took his gum and ·carry hi.s dog to the woods,\ for the Span.ish word \to carry\ means also \to lead\ or 'to conduct.\ Perhaps the following statement oug-ht to be true: \When he a woke he found his dog hungry 'after twenty w1'itten hy Irving, LongfeUow, Hawthorne, Van.

The following is a more extended sentence, in whi:ch the idea :n the writer's mind is not very well conveyed, hut we 1nust b€ar in mind that the Spanish word for ''misfortune'' is \disgrace and that the worcl \dress\ is u.sed for· both 1ne·n and women '·Lono·- • b fell·ow was a disgraceful man.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, APRIL 28, 1908 No. 23 THE HISTORY OF UNION'S. COLORS. (DevVitt Clinton.) Search in the literature of colleges, in books re- lating to college customs, and in general periodi- cal literature, reveals but little of value in the history of college colors. The .earliest printed record of college colors found, is in the \\Villhn1s College Quarterly,\ Angus t, 1865. Therein the announcement is made of the choi·ce of ''Royal Purple as our college co lor.\ In \Qui Vier,\ the organ of 8hurtleff Gollege, 11nde:r elate of April, 1868, the colors ·Of eleven A1nerican colleges are g1ven, among t1.1e1n Union is assigned n1agenta, \Vhile Harvard's color is given a.s red. In the same year ··carmina Golle- ginesia\ assigns red to Harvard, and magenta to Union. The \Harvard Advocate,\ April, 1875, gives an account of the first use -o.f a color by a Harvard crew in 1858, and the color was \very near to a true crilnson.\ The \Yale Courant\ of same date gives crim- son as Harvard's color, but adds, .. no formal adop- tion was 1nade until 1867. The above staterne11ts are preliminary to the re- labon of facts. incident to the formal adoption of garnet as Union's color. In 187 4 Union hact a capable crew, fine boats and boathouse, and a goocl practice course. Pre- parations for a regatta among college crews, to be held on the Connecticut at Sp.ringfield, Mass., were in progress, and Union registered her crew and color fbr the event. Harvard had registered the same color, 1na· genta, and immediateh~ protested Union's right to t11e use thereof A serious disagreement was avoided at the time, as Union soon decided to withdraw from the event. Early in 1875 thirteen colleges were entered to row on Saratoga Lake in July,of that year. In order to be eligible to enter the race Union applied for membership in the Rowing Association of A1nerican Colleges and it became nece.ssa17 to register the color under which Union's .crew wonlcl row. Many years previous n1agenta hacl, informally, been adopted as Union's color therefore it was so registered. Harvard at once presented a claim to priority in use of the color, and a contr-oversy began which for a time waxed strenuous. Out- side friends -of both crews advised a compromise and a committee fron1 each college \Yas appointed to meet and amicably arrange the matter in dis- pute. After discussion of the rival claims, it was finally decided to request both colleges to aban- don magenta and chose another color. This rec- ommendation was followed and in February, 1875, Union College forn1ally ad-opted o·arnet as the . b college color and Harvard adopted criln.son. That all Harvard men were nDt pleased at the outcon1e is evidenced by the following excerpts: The \Harvard Magenta.,\ under elate of Feb- ruary 12, 1875, had the following: ''It becomes our painful duty to inform the H. U. B. C.!> the .ct. U. B. B. C., the H. U. F. B. C. and others that the magenta which. has graced so many victories, which was first disp~ayed on Lake Winnipiseoga, in 1859, and now adorns our comn1ons crockery must be renounced. Union College has signified her willingness to enter the next regatta. Union College bears a magna standard and Union Col- lege desires us to change our color. Union claimed the color in 1860, she states. Before what tri- bunal? Where was it widely displayed? The ,color was probably worn by some Union student, but the color of a college is established when it is worn in a race with other colleges.\ It is a matter of some interest that Union's ap- plication for membership in the Rowing Associa- tion having been rejected in the morning session of the convention and while the 1natter in dis- pute between 1-Iarvard and Uni-on was yet rife, it was on Harvard's motion that the action of the n1orning was reconsidered and Union admitted to membership in the Association. This was a

8 THE CONC'O'RDIENSIS gracious and courteous act by Harvard, greatly appreciated by the buys of '75. In July, 1875, the crews met on Saratoga Lal{e and g.arnet was established for Union, as was crimson. for Harvard. Thirteen college crews met in that regatta and all but .four displayed the colors now borne. Cornell then displ'ayed carnel- ian, it is now carnelian and white; Brown Univer~ sity displayed brown only it is now brown and white; Wesleyan showed red, white and blue, now cardinal a11d black; Princeton :earried orange, now orange and black.

Coach 'Grout .spoke on Saturday's gam:e wi~h Rutgers. He said that the varsity played :an ex- cellent fielding game and predicted a winning nut- look for the res·t of the s·eason. Captain Parsons :arged the men ~..o come nut fol' track in order to compete in the several track n1eets. Steven.s, '08 brought up the following amencl- n1ents to the athletic eonstitution, wl1ich were ratified by the student body. Article XI. Section 2. Class numerals shall be a warded to anyone who shall have played one game on a varsity tea1n, or who has been a warded a second. Article III, Section 6. The Athletic Board shall annually elect at its October meeting- an assistant manager for the tennis tea1n from the list of Juniors who have registered as candidates with the manager, who shall n1ake recommendation~J concerning said emTdidates. Also these resolutions, adopted by the Athletic Board, March 29th, 1908, were accepted. I. Athletic teams are classified as of three kin d's-{ a) college or university teams; (b) S2C- ond tearns, when duly authorized by the Athletic Board; (c) class teams. II. To avoid mis11nderstandings and consequent har1n to the colleg€, it i.s the pol:.cy of Union to allow no other teams from Union College than those j11st spe,cified, to play with outside teams. Included a1ncng teavn.s not thus allowed would be any team composed 1Jart1y of Union students and partly of outsiders, unless the outsiders were 111 tbe majority. III. The manager of each college or university team is required to report to the chairman of the Faculty Gommittee on .Athletics the names of all other team managers in h:s branch of .sport.

Oh, no; we don't own the ·canpus. It belongs to the kids who must have a :plae€ to play, to the 1adies who must go shopping, anGt to the workmen who must have a short cut to the factory. Yes!' the diamond belongs to the:tn, teo.

It is only the steam pipes of our heating plant. When C. B. was here, yo1:t know, he tried to heat all outdoors.\ \Oh yes, the Gl.ee Club is going on an extended Western trip. When? Oh, I don't know, some tilne in 1912, I guess.\ \No there isn't any wil:d monster inside the chapel. The rea.son the fellows peek so caut-iou.sly inside the door is to find out whether their mon· itor is there or not.\ \Oh yes, by all means laugh at Ashe) 's jokes. It's a good plan, we upper class·men havt found. It may be tiresome work, but he will stick you if you don't.\ \Yes you can bolt JDhnnie Bennett twenty times if you want to. Johnnie doesn't care. He Ukes bolts just as well as you do.\ \Oh yes, the fellows always pay their Concordy subscriptions. But then they needn't, you know; for the Concorcly- is a charitable enterprise. Tbe editors are noble philanthropists and are expected to run the paper on wind, and without the support of the student body.\ \No that is not Schenectady's new garbage dis- posal plant.

The r11les passed by the committee of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association at .its meeting are generally conceded to be a step in advance of those last Y'ear. Not a measure adopted but is h.ailed as a no:table improvement. As was thought before the meeting, the ch.ief portion of the ses siDns was occupied with the f{)r- ward pass. The result of many hours of deliber- ation and discussio·n was the adoption of the fol- lowing rule.s, which wiH be drafted by a commit- tee consisting of Walter Camp, L. M. Denni:S and E'. K. Hall. A forward pass illegally touched goes to the op- ponents on the spot from which t11e pass is made. Of t11e passers' side ouly the man who first 1 t:gally touches the ball may thereafter recover it until it has been touched by an opp·onent. If the forward pass is legally touched and then free upon the ~round and touh. eed by another play- er on the passtrs' side, tb e ball goes to the oppo- nents on the spot where he improperly touches it. There was another restriction passed bearing upon the forward pass, treating with the rtgh ts of players while the ball is in the air. This pro- hibits the defending players from holding the players on the side trying to 1nake the paES, as was done by Princeton to break up the Carlisle In- clians' passes. It also decides the rights of the passing side in u.sing their hands. These restrictions placed on the game are con- sidered opportune, since they will prevent the gen- eral use· of the style employed by the In:lians. It was doubted by few that with the forward pass left unreformed most teams would have adopted the Carlisle method of manipulati.ng the pass, as it was most effective. It also· left room for ques- tionable tactics in the way of receiving the pass. But under the present c·ode the officials will be better able to watch the plays than heretofore. The dra.stic penalties opposed where forward passes are illegally touched or are touched after being ftunbled by another of the same team will have the effect of doing away with recl<les s pass- ing and scrambling, as is thought. The practice of holding opponents on the s,ide making the pass, million hue. That was caused. by some children from Rensselaer who can1e over here to amuse themselves one night. Children must be hum·nred, thus preventing them from g'etting down the field to form protection for the man receiving tt, has been prohibited. It was pra.cticed on several oc- casions in Bastern games during the 1907 season. you know.\

Int€rest in the annual Union-Rutgers debate to ' be held in Ne-w Brunswick, N. J., on lVlay 13th has crystall'ized int-o steady, consistent work and a definite }Jl an f.o·r the contest. Preliminary trials have been held during the past vveek in the college chapel under the direc- ti-on of Professors Hoffman and McKean. There has b€en considerable enthusiasm shown and there :have been a goodly number of contestants for uositions on the team. The men who have been chosen to represent Union on the negative side of the contention are Weyrauch, '08; La Crosse, '08; Mnuld, '09, and Davies, '08, alternate. The debate with Rutgers will unquestionably be the hardest con test of the year. For fourteen con- .secHtive years 'Rutgers has carried off the laurels fron us, but our previous victories this season give good rea son for hoping that this year we will destroy the continuity of her unbrolcen record.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS atl)letitG VARSITY \N INS AGAH4. ---· --·- Defeats Rutg1ers I .n a Well Played Game. Last Saturday the -Garnet journeyed to New Brunswick · and added another victory to her credit. Dunn pitched a ·fine game at all po~nts and his support was excel:lent. In the first inning, with Union at bat first, Perry started things going with a single, went to second on Vogt'.s sacrifiee to Rowland, ancl stole third, coming home on. King's single. With two men out, Rowland circled the bases on a hit over the center fi-elder's h€ad for Rntger's only run. The second :nning o })ened auspiciously for the Var.sity. Hayward sh1gled, stole second, went to third on an error and. stole home. Dunn made a single with two on t ancl went to second on an error. Perry drew a pass, but the side was re- tired without any more soaring. In the fourth H·o:flfrnan made a ·single, stole second, went to third on Mackey's sacrifice and came home Dn Dtun1' s single. '1 his ended the .scoring in the game. In the sixth, Rutgers's prospects looked brighter when, with two out, Ro0wland gained third and Steinke made first. But Dunn pulled out of the hole by .striking out Seg:oine. What was the uniucky seventh in the We3t Point and Pratt games changed to the lucky s-eventh for Dunn. li€ struck out the three men who faced him. In the ninth Ladue made a .single, but was ad- vanced no further because of good fielding on the part of the opposing players. 'The features of 'the game were R·owe's home run ancl Dunn's pitching.

With Defeat Stari tag It in the Face the Garnet Pulls 0 ttt with Victory. • The game with. P.ratt on the eleventh reads like a story' in a noveL With a score of five to noth- ing, Pratt finally went down to defeat in the last inning in one of tl1e games that will be handed down to posterity. 'The game appeared to be an easy one for Pratt, f{)r with h.er phenominal, smil- ing pitcher in the box::, the Union batters seemed. unable to locate tb~e ball. While Pratt, although_ held down ti1l the seventh by two err-o-rs and a, single, brought thr.ee 1nen across the plate. The outcome from tbis ]Oint never seemed in doubt and ag.ain in the ninth two men were sent home for the visitors, giving a hard lead to overc-o.me. One runner, wh·ose .score was counted was evi- dently put out at home by Ca.pta.in Vogt, as the u·mpire. was busy in a.n alterC'ation at first and did not see the p·u t, th.e score was tallied.

From this time run• 1aer after runner crossed the plate, until the score stood six to five when the game closed. Ladue seems to be getting in his old batting form, for with two men on bases, he met the ·ball for a three-bagger. No one has seen such wild enthus- iasm. as attacked the Union bleachers in the ninth inning, and it is not to be doubted that our yelling atded the winning. of the game materially.

Helm, '08 attended the eighty-first annual con- vention of the De]ta Phi Fraternity, held at the St. Elmo Club, N·ew York city, April 11 and 12. Hagar, '06, witnessed the Pratt game on the campus. He seems as great a baseball enthusiast as ever. Moving up day ought soon to make its appear- ance. Again the scraper 1s making its rounds and it seems to enjoy th.e work, as it takes its own time. The skating rink •is of some use after all. It is com.ing in handy now as a place in which to throw the weights. Learner: I think you might do as well by us as Prof. A-m-e did. He gave us a bolt. Teacher B-e: Well, the Lord only knows what he'll do. But he's all r:ght, they're all all right, all right, a11 right, aU right. The following SO·])ho.mores have registered with Manager Fuller as candidates for assistant man~ ager of the track: tea.m: Newton W. E)lutter, Har- lan H. Grover, Harold E. Seamans and Ralph S. Merrill. --·-- Prof. Ellery has been invited to deliver the graduating address at the Glens Falls High School. --- Dr. Barnes has been made an honorary member of the Pyramid Club. Recently the ofHcers of the Pyramid Club for the ensuing year were elected. They are as fol- lows: President-Herbert D. Scutt. Vlce President-Ed1nond B. Whitcomb. Treasurer-George A. Diiiing.er. Corresponding Secretary-Raymond J. Finch. Recording Secretary-S. Vernon Travis. Last Thursda.y evening a banquet was given for the new officers at Cry11e's Restaurant. Following is the toast list: Toastmaster, John ~.Nash. Speech of retiring president, Vandegrift, '08. Response- of president elect, Whitcomb, '10. Our Club, Penrose, '08. Our Debators, Motdd, '09.

The committee which had the arrangements in charge was composed. of Covey, '08; Finch, '09, and Travis, '11. --.------.- Last Wednesday, for the first tilne, eight-oared crews representing E.arvard and the Navy met in a race on the Severn River. Harvard wa.s vic- torious, winning by n<>t a full boat length. Her time for the two miles was lO minutes and 30 sec- onds; Navy's, 10 rni:nutes and 32 secol\dS.

THE CONCO·RDIENSIS HE.ARD ON THE CAMPUS. Upper Classman: Hey, Frosll, get off the grass. What do you think the gravel wan{s are made for, if not to walk on? I have just bc·oted two sub- Freshmen .off the grass .. Frosh: Well, that's a great way to• treat the .sub-Freshmen. Pretty soon you will have a sub- Freshman Day to get them to co1ne here, and now you keep them a way by kicking them ·off. Upper ·Classm~n: Let sub-Freshmen like those stay away. We don't want them. We want men, not cattle. Moral: Don't 1nake an ass of yourself. Keep off the gra.ss. Next Commencement marks the completion o.f forty years of Cornell's history, and plans are being considered by a committee of alumni to have a reunion of all classes. On April 14, New York Univers'ty defeated Rut- gers in a debate. This is the first time in many years that Rutgers has been defeated.
