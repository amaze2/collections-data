Political Econo~my has been called the dls,mal science, the gospel of selfishness. Man, it is said, is running into a iower plane than formerly ;. the lofty aims, the high ambitions, the unselfish purposes and the honest regard for the public welfare are giving place to the greed for wealth and to a corresponding decadence of character,. public and private. Malthus and Ricardo,, blighting with theh· touches of pessi 1nism, the throbbing aspirations of the idealist, have painted for us a gloomy picture of nature at war with humanity. Indeed, so great does the struggle seem, that in a casual glance at the world at large, society sometimes seems a bewildering mass of possibilities and failures, born of accident and sweeping along the track of time with a dash as irresistable as the falling avalanche and its control ahnost as hopeless and impossible. But the problem is by no means a despairing one. - One hundred and fifty years ago tt·ade and commerce were strangled by a huge mass of fiscal anomalies known as the mercantile system. Against this, liberalism waged relent- less war under the leadership of Adam Smith. Smith was inspired by the idea of natural liberty in the economic world, of an inherent beneficence and harmony of interests in nature which can only be attained by allowing the great competitive forces freedom to operate, calling upon the State to secure liberty and justice to all. Under these conditions, the industrial world would gradually develop into an harn1onious and organic whole. But he would no more make a fetish of unrestri~cted individualism than he would fold his arms in hopeless fatalism or call upon the State to endeavor offhand and radically to reconstruct society. But his ideas were in advance of his time. During his life they were received because of the power of his own personality. After his death, they became so discredited and so completely lost in the cloud of \Pessimistic

Economy,\ that it is not till the present time i that t:he world has arrived at any realization of • their true value. The great industrial transformations of the world for the past century, are bringing about a return to the ideas of Adam Smith. The aspects and real conditions of civilization have been marvelously changed. Great advances have been made in sc.ientific discovery, opening the secret places of nature and r,evealing her powers. Wherever science has lighted the way, art has followed with her industry. By means of this, the whole sphere of occupations has been raised and amplified; all enterprise has taken on grander and broader proportions ; wealth has been created and diffused; and com- forts beyond the dreams of the most sanguine have been made available to all classes of people. The intellectual element has become the prime and dominant factor in wealth production. So1nething has been found to be more necessary than material possibility ; something suggestive, jnsp1nng, creative; something superior to nature and master over it ; and that something is knowledge and mental force. Everything todav bears a more distinctively intellectual type; everything bears the impress of thought. Each and every one of the occupations of life involves, detnands, is a tnental effort putting forth a physical effort. The result is that the increasing demand of today is for workmen of the highest type, men of industry, honesty and intelligence, men of ability. This demand can only be satisfied and progress industrially can only be brought about by increasing the ability of the worker and by giving that ability free play along the lines of just competition. The Irish were once a proverb over Europe for indolence and shiftlessness. But they were indolent because they were crushed by such insidious legislation as the English \Corn Laws.\ Since 185o, every country on the globe has witnessed the indotnitable pluck and energy of the Irish at work under equal laws and a fair chance. By undervaluing human ability and just competition~ Political Economy will fail as the interpreter and guide of the future world of industry. Ancient civilization 7 feU because it failed to recognize the value of man, the worker. Modern civilization wiU endure if it will help man the worker to increfil;$~ with ~every advance in intelligence and morality~> Economic forces are today gradually and silentty · elevating, refining and inspiring our working classes above those of any other nation in the world. Their superiority is due to greater educational advantages and :greater freedom to operate along natural lines. They are being led along the path of true progress by the invisibl:e hand of ability and enlightened self- interest. The task before Political Economy is to discourage Trade Unioni:sn1. which artificially rnakes goods dear and to foster all agencies tending to increase the economic value of ~man, giving him a higher inteBigence, a · purer morality and a greater refinement of tastes. Economics insensibly blending with ethics must realize that money-getting should be but a means to an end, that culture and all that goes to widening and deepening of 1nan's personality is the true ideal of humanity. There is no more auspicious sign of the world's progress today than the increasing tendency toward universal peace and arbih·ation. It is no empty sound which is being wafted from that bell, struck by one of the most powerful n1onarchs of the world, to sound out in the name of Russia-\ Peace and the Brotherhood of the Nations.\ The Utopia of yesterday is in the way of becoming the actuality of tomorrow. The groans of a peasantry ground down by taxa- tion for standing armies will yet be answered. 1\'his new departure in human evolution means a passage of society out of .a military into an industrial state. Political economy, the least developed of all the sciences, will perha p~ be heralded as the science of the twentieth century, the century of co1n1nercial and industrial prosperity. Under the new order, patriotism will no longer be a martial sentiment. As the flag looses its former significance as an emblem of outward defiance, it will gain a new meaning as the supreme symbol of internal concord; it will beco1ne the visible sign of economic harmony, in which the welfare of all is justly and inpregnably secured.

~THE CONOORDIENSIS. As :the close of the 18tl'l century found Europe struggling furiously :for the bala nee 0f power, so ' the dose of the r9th century finds the com- mercial nations of th.e· world contending for the balance of trade. Eac'h looks with invidious ·eyes on the prosperity of all about it, consider- ing the :gain of one to mean i:Oss to another. The struggle for the ba1ance of power proved as futile as it was sickening. It reached its climax in. the meddlesom:e interference of England in affairs of Russia and 1'·urkey. Russia prevented from expanding in Europe, expanded in Asia where she has alruost cotnplete control. The struggle for the balance of trade will cease with the recognition of that economic principle, that that country is going to hold the balance of trade which best supplies the markets of the world as regards cheapRess, quantity and quality. Moreover, with the dawn of universal peace, perhaps free trade vvil~l becotne tl1e great eco- nomic law of nations resting not on national independence but on international inter-depen- dence, the progress of on.e making for the prog- ress of all. England attributes l1er wealth to the establish- ment of free trade principles. The U. S. as yet maintains a fisca1 system in direct and avowed antagonism to those principles. The present conditions seem to demand such a policy. The great problem bef()t·e us today is that of expansion. The pt·oblem is a political one and it is also an economic one. The U. S. is as yet in her infancy as a co1oni zing power and the annexation of Hawaii and the Pb.ili ppines have been -viewed, and perhaps justly, frotn the stand- point of financial expediency. But the demands of civilization upon econon1ics are and ought to be the demands ()f Cl1Tistian ethics. Let us hope that the time is not far off when we shall mo longer be lead by the selfish principle of immediate utility, but by the combined economic principle of self-in t~1·est and sy.mpathy which, taking root, ultimately blossoms into all that is best and noblest in civilization. Utility is thus re£.ned into n:Jorali ty and selfishness into the highest phase ()f rnoral conduct. This is the idea which originated with Adam Smith. When this is conceived, there .flashes on the mind a vision of the time when all the nations of the earth shall he bound together by the silken .cord enlightened self-interest, a self-interest which of recognizes that,. given the conditions of liberty and justice., the gain of one .means. the gain of all. Nations, instead of lying in wait for each other, armed to the teeth, are seen to be mem\' hers of a great confedet·ation, each ·developing its resources to the utmost and exchanging its products in harmony and with mutual profit. HAROLD J. HINMAN, '99· ' THE FUTURE OF AME~lCA. Trustee Starin on the Vitality of Ameri- can Heroism. A granite monument, erected at a cost of $6,ooo by Hon. John H. Starin, of New York, above the remains of his uncle, the late Col. Simeon Satnmons, of the One Hundred and Fifteenth Regilnent, New Yorl{ State Volunteers, was unveiled at Fonda Saturday. Mr. Starin delivered the dedicatory address, closing with the following ringing words of patriotism : \lam not one of those who believe in the degeneracy of our time. On the contrary, I hold that the world grows better as it grows older, and I am firm in the belief that as the years go on every trial, every danger which may come to this beloved land of ours will call to the front new n1en, strong .. high-hearted and fresh for the fight. It was so in the war with Spain just closed. It will be so for all time. From my point of view it were as well to try to stop the tides of the sea as to retard or impede the progress of the American Republic, and with this faith strong within me, I dedicate this monument of granite and of bronze to the memory of the heroes who have gone, steadfast in the faith that when my country calls there will be loud and q_ uick response from countless heroes yet to come.\

~THE CONOOlRDIENSIS. 9 DEWBY DAY ON THE HILL .. The Occasioli ()bserv·ed ·with Appropriate Exercises. hasn't helped to raise his name to the skies ? Why, it's Dewey every morning, it's Dewey all day, and then it's Dewey all night 'till morning again.''' The professor said that in regard to Manila, he knew no m,ore than that they make poor cigars there and hemp to hang traitors. In .i regard to the herO's ,conduct since the victory he gave hin1 great credit. Dewey has proved him- self .a solid serious ,man, and wise in that he refused the nomination for the presidency, Although a l 1 ~rge number of students were present at the celebration in New York City, the majority ~eJM~ained on the hill to join in the ex:ercises he}d last Friday ~morning. The meet;. ing was uaeter the direction of W. Dewey Loucks, I90D., and notwithstanding the lateness , when it was ~'ecided to celebrate, the meeting . was spirited a~m.~d :enthusiastic. The various pro- fessors were pl-esent, and took an active part in the prograrnn1e. In the line of decoration a portrait of th~ ~t-eat admiral encircled by a large American flag f~ced the audience and gave the finishing touches to the patriotic meeting. At i offered by unscrupulous men. The other nations :showed wise diplo1nacy in not taking part in the celebration, in that they were at peace with ~ Spain. The professor then turned his attention I ten o'clock ci:Ht.i•nnan Loucks opened the exer- · cises with a (e~ preliminary remarks. Follow- ing, '' The Star Spangled Banner '' was sung with much fe~·~o-r, after which a prolonged col- ' lege yell sup],>ltenented with \Dewey\ was given. President Ra..yn<>nd wa.s the first speaker, and said that the reception given to the great naval commander vas !like .a revival of old Roman days, whelil -victorious generals returned in triumph. It vva:.s inevitable after the battle of Manila to ha..vethis celebration, yet instead of bringing bacl captives in his train, it gave an inspiration to mew and larger national life. The . battle of Ma~nila was a stroke of boldness calling . forth the admi\J·~tion of the world. It is a fact that few nations have a hero with so many quali- ties combined io his character. As a result of Manila, in one llour, America took its place as . one of the W()rld's foremost powers, with great responsibilitlef:l fi·om which it is impossible to turn back. ra-e people cannot think of it, nor would the vvorld approve of it. The lesson teaches a gt-eater outburst of patriotic fervor, that Union must be loyal to the nation by put- ting forth rn.~rn. .fitted for larger national demands. The Union. Narching Song was then sung with enthusiastn, after which Dr. Wells spoke in a happy vein. '''Young gentlemen,\ sa1d he, \it is needless f<>r r:ne to say anything about Dewey, for who d()esa't known all about him, and who toward Mexico, and dwelt on the attitude of that nation toward oi:tr own, closing with a few remarks on the worth of the president of that nation. Dean Ripton was the next speaker, and he dwelt on the historical in1portance of the battle of Manila. Heretofore the Atlantic has borne the commerce of the world. Dewey's victory, while it did not bring the Pacific into equal prominence, has steered the United States tow- ard .a realization of its importance. In closing, the dean said : \In the world as it is to be, we occupying the centre, will stand as the first great democracy to cotnbine governmental order with civil liberty, and with tremendous moral inffuence that should make the world better. In future year's the people will think of George as one of those great Americans, who in his country's crisis was equal to the emergency.\ Following this, \ Old Union Beside the Mohawk Vale\ was sung with a will. Dr. Ashmore, the last speaker, spoke on England's rule in India, as a lesson for the United States. England took charge of a people, the civiliza- tion of whom is almost beyond conception. In time, England's colonies will either become independent nations, or part of the home nation. England's rule is what it should be. If we rule as we ought, the time will come when the Philippines will form states or become part of the sovereign state. The exercises closed with the singing of \My Country, 'Tis of Thee,\ and a rousing \George Washington.\

THE FINANCIAL statement of the annual spring meet of the New York State Intercollegiate Ath- letic Union is published in another column, and is certainly very encouraging. The meet, it will be remembered, was held under Union's auspices, ap.d, the bq.la1.1.ce in the treasury to be divided between Hamilton and Union speaks well for the management. for regular essays and orations, together with a list of the dates on which the latter fall due tb.i~ term. This system is now placed before the stud.ents for the :first time, and it is entirely depen- dent for its success on the earnestness with which they e:nter into it. Of course the general aim of the plan is to arouse a deeper interest among the undergradu.ates in literary work, and at the same time by this very process to improve The Concordi- ensis. That it should be improved everyone has been ready to remark. But in the past, few, beside the editors themselves have shown any disposition to work for its betterment. Now· an opportunity is given to every man in college to aid in making The Concordiensis more representative of under- graduate life at Union; and i~ is to be hoped that many men will take advantage of this opportunity. A literary editor is to be appointed before Decem- ber 1, 1899, and the selection .will be made upon a basis of work submitted previous to that date. Competition is open to all members of the senior \i (I

\i (I TitE· CONCORb!ENSiS. 11 and junior classes. The editor-in-chief would like to confer with any men desiring to try for this position and will also be giad to meet any fresh- men desirous of trying a .hand at literary work. AT THE opening of another college year it is perhaps apropos to urge that the students keep files of The Concordiensis-· for we assume that every undergraduate is a .subscriber. The in\lport- anc.e of this practice cannot be overestimated, and it can be carried out with a little care. When you ha,:ve read the paper through, don't let it lie about your room to be torn or lost. Just put the copy away for safe keeping, and at the end of the year you will have the history of the coHege year's doings in one compact volume and invaluable for referen.ce, not to mention the satisfaction with which you can turn to those pages when, in future years, the recollections of college years begin to grow dim. This matter is mentioned now and will be brought to your attention from time to time, because students are apt to forget it to their own regret. During commencement week last June several '99 men came to the business manager and asked for back numbers at any price to complete their very incomplete files. But only in a few instances were we able to supply the missing num- bers, and this year whatever copies remain over will be sent from week to week to preparatory schools and alumni. So now is the time to begin. Keep your file up to date. ~ FOOTBALL SCOI(ES. SATURDAy' SEP. 30· At New Haven, Yale, 23 ; Amherst, o. At Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 20; Lehigh, o.

12 MAGAZINE REVIEW. Outing for October. With a wealth of beautiful iUustrations and with all the experts have to say concern:ing the great International Yacht Race, Outing for October is as fresh and wholesome as is the ocean breeze, which drove the w bite-winged fliers in their race fot~ the America's storied cup. Long and vainly has Great Britain striven to regain possession of the trophy which signifies the yachting supremacy of the seas, and this time, if :ever, is the opportunity for Sir Thomas Lipton's stately Shamrock. Designer Fife, sail-maker Ratsey, and all concerned have done theh best, and the two swiftest yachts the wol'ld has ever seen will race upon tbeir merits to a finish. Outing for October tells al:t about Shamrock and Columbia, their designers, owners and crews, for this is a yachting number of the popular magazine of sport, travel and recreation. Other sports, however, a.1.1e not neglected ; Outing never fails in this respect. General athletics, football, golf, tennis, the horse, gun. and rod, kennel, and every depart- ment of sport in which a lady or gentleman can be interested receives the .careful attention of writers wh() have become fam'Otts authorities in their chose,n. fields. In text and illustrations the number is one of the best that ever left the presses. BASEBALL ELECTION. The members of last spring's baseball team held a meeting last week and elected John D. Edwards, r 900, captain for next season. Edwards is an effective twirler and is a good man for the place. The new captain spoke of the baseball prospects for the coming spring as particularly favorable. There is no baseball material developed from 1902 but the freshtnan class this year has a number of n1en with base- ball ability, some of whom have played on the teams of the preparatory schools from which they have come. Manager Tuggey is at work on the schedule for the spring, and a good series of games will be offered. ALUMNI .NOTES. News of Union's Sll'ns in Many Classes. '4o.-Ex- Judge George F. Danforth, at one time on ,the New York state Court of Appeals bench, dropped dead in court at Rochester, September 25. He had just argued a case and taken his seat when stt·i,cken with apoplexy and expired two minutes later in an adJoining room. George F. Danforth was born in Boston, Mass., July 5, r819. He was graduated at Union college in r84o, and after studying law began practice in R.\Ochester where he was eminently successful and soon rose to the front rank of the profession. In 1876 he was the Republican candidate for Judge of the Court of Appeals, of the state of New York, but was defeated by Robert Earl, Union, '45· Two years later he was again nominated for a similar office, and after being elected took his seat on the bench Jan. I, 1879. Save during the period between Jan. I, 1879, and r88r, when he was an associate judge of the Court of Appeals, his practice has been uninter- rupted. Judge Danforth was a Republican and was a member of the judiciary commission of 1892, but had held no other office. On the 27th of April, 1846, he married Miss Frances J. Wright, daughter of Orrin and Frances Gould Wright of Pittsfield, Mass. '54.-Intelligence l1as been received of the death of John D.

Mr. Thom·son spoke for The Concordiensis, explaining the new arrangetnent where by work done for the college paper is credited to the writer in the English Departmelilt, in place of . essays and orations. He said he hoped n1any . would take advantage of this new syster:n as by such a course they can help the paper which represents the college, and at the sarne time do their English work. An appeal was made for a better scrub this week as there is a hard game to play Saturday · when we meet Columbia at Albany. Jvfanager MacCulloch reminded all of their duty to go to Ridgefield Saturday and encourage the wearers of the garnet from the side lines. PERSONALS. Prof. Bennett spent Sunday at Altamont.

It will be rem:embered that at the last college meeting in June the student body decided that for the college year of r8g9-I900 the fonn of the undergraduate publicstion be changed so as to provide for a combining of the monthly literary 1nagazine, the Parthenon and the news weekly, the Concordiensis, into one publication, a weekly to be known as the Concordiensis, to cot)tain both literary and news matter, and to be under the control of one board of editors. Now in order that there be no lack of literary material submitted by the students it was suggested that the faculty might be willing to make such matter if accepted for publication, an equivalent of equal work in the departlnent of rhetoric, i. e., of required essays and orations. This plan was taken up, a petition was drawn and presented to the faculty and granted by that body. The petition provides that: \During the college year of I 899- I goo liter- ary contributions submitted by the students for the Concordiensis, and duly accepted therefor, shall be accepted by the faculty as a substitute in kind for regular work in the department of rhetoric.\ Now the thne has arrived for the carrying into execution this plan, and accordingly the following rules have been drawn up : I. All literary work, in order to be accepted, must be satisfactory to the head of the depart- ment of rhetoric (or to any one whom he; may name) and to the editorial board of the paper; and if duly accepted, such work is to be an exact equivalent, so far as college requirements are concerned, to a required essay or orat.ion. IL Every student desiring to take advantage of such ofler shall register during the first week of the tenn with the head of the department of rhetoric, and shall hand in his contributions to the editor ot the Concordiensis at least two weeks before the date upon which is due the regular essay or oration of which it is to take the place. In case the manuscript is rejected, J ' ,,

J ' ,, THE CONCORDIENSIS. 15 the contributot· shall be given notice at the · earliest possible date after it is submitted, and not less than eight days before the said essay or oration is due .. III. No 1ndividual student shall be allowed to substitute newspaper work for more than one exercise during any college term .. IV. This substitute work tnay be taken by any students in any of the four regular classes, except the first term sophotnore and third fresh- man. Rule II requires that all persons who are to substitute this Concordiensis work for regular essays must register with Prof. Hale during the first week of the term. This arrangement will . not go into force until the winter term because of the unavoidable delay in publishing these rules. So if aU of those who are going to take advantage of the change will hand their names at once to Prof. Hale, this registration will answer the purpose. As stated above tl1ese contributions to the paper must be handed in at least two weeks before the date on which are due the essays or orations of which they are to take the place. In accord with this, students in the classes eligible, will notice the dates below on which regular work is due at the department of Rhetoric. Freshman essays, 8oo words-Oct. 13, Oct. 27, Nov. Io, Nov. 24. Junior orations, about I ooo words-Oct. 27. Junior essays, \ \ \ Nov. 24. Senior orations, \ \ \ Oct. 30. Senior essays, \ \ \ Nov. 27. CHANGES IN THE FACULTY. Through some mistake last week, the list of additions to the faculty did not appear in the :first number of The Concordiensis. Today we publish the names of the new men who are to be with us as instructors, and whose connection with the college, we trust, may not be short. In the brief time they have been with us they have already proved themselves excellent teachers. The department of Latin is to have a new teacher, and the man selected to fill the position is Curtis C. BushneH, J>h. D., a graduate of Yale in the class of '92 with. the {:Iegree of A. B. Mr. Bushnell is well fitted for the place having had two years' experience in secondaty school work and two years of teaching in college. He will take Instructor Bennett's place, who has been raised to the assistant professorship in Greek. As instructor in mathernatics, surveying and draughting, the trustees have engaged Mr. Lindsay Duncan, a graduate from the ~university of Maine in both the scientific and engineering courses. He was engaged for a time in practical work at the Bath Iron Works, and afterward entered Clark universitv at Worcester from I w which institution he received high },etters of recommendation as did he also from Maine. The new instructor in Modern Languages is Mr. John L. Marsh, A. B., Lafayette, '93· He is a son of Prof. Marsh of Lafayette, the well known educator, and he was graduated with high honors, delivering the honorary oration with the valedictory. Instructor JY1arsh has had two years' experience in teaching and has spent the past three years in study in Germany, France and Italy. INTE~COLLEGIATE. University of Vermont. As the outco·me of the troubles in the medi- cal department of the University of Vennont at Burlington, the entire faculty has resigned. The department has l1eretofore been only nominally under the supervision of the trustees of the university, and it is now expected that a reorganization will be f'ffected and the depart- ment put under the direct control of the trustees, as are the other departments of the university. It is probable that nearly all the members of the faculty will resume tl1eir positions. WILLI.AMS. Captain Louis Drapel- and Coach \Joe\ Hazen of Williams Colleg;e, are working hatd to put a strong eleven on the gridiron this year. The candidates for positions on the team num- ber thirty, ten of w·hom played on the 'Varsity· last year. Captain Drapei will play right half. ! '

1'6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ~. P. 1., 6; UNION, ·s. Polytechnics Win Opening ·Game on a Fumble. The first football gatne of the season was played on the can.1pus, Saturday, Sept. 30, with the team representing Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute of Troy. The game was the first for • both teams and: each had been training hard in anticipation of it. So, when at three o'clock the two elevens trotted out to the :Held for a ' preliminary ''' warn1ing up\ each realized that · only hard work could get the game, and accord- ingly played with a detennination to win. From the first line-up one could see that the teams were quite evenly matched, and when, after the second down, Aldrich got the ball on a fumble and ran 45 yards for a touchdown, even R. P. I's .supporters were surprised. But this setback was only tetnporary and shortly after, Paige was sent across R. P. I.'s line after · a series of steady gains. The home teatn was greatly handicapped by the inability of Carver and Finnegan to play ; but even then, it should have won. While both teams fumbled badly, the playing was nearly all in R. P. I's territory and in the first half Union's backs had no trouble to find holes in their opponents' line. Twice during the game Union ~umbled at critical mo1nents when touchdowns seetned not far off, and then the ball would be kicked out of danger. Union excelled R. P. I. in team work and offensive work but was lamentably weak on the defense. In the second half there was something . decidedly wrong, but Captain Fenton lays it to no one individual. He says that while he was disappointed at the result of the game still he does not feel discouraged as to the future success of the team. The gatne in detail follows : Kick off by R.. P. I. Weed catches ball and advances it IO yards. Union futnbles and Aldrich runs 45 yards for a touchdown. Goal kicked by Judd. Paige kicks off, but ball soon goes to Union on downs. Gordon and Clark by end and line plays advance the ball to R. P. I I's 5 yard line, and Paige goes through center for a touchdown. Paige fails at trial for goal. Score, R. P. I., 6; Union, 5· During the rest of this half the ball remains near the center of the field. Second half. Paige kicks to Polytechnic's 30 yard line. R. P. I. forced to kick:. Slack makes 5 yards and the baH goes toR. P. I. on downs. No gain, Union's ball. Th~ee 5 yard gains by Gordon and Slack. Gordon encircles the right end for 30 yards. R. P. I's ball on downs. Ward makes 35 yards around Thebo. Union takes ball on a forward pass but looses it on a fumble after IO yards is made. Doty fumbles and Union advances ball to R. P. I's 20 yard line. Another fumble and R. P. I. kicks. Union returns kick and on fumble kicks again. Time is called with the ball in R. P. I's hands. The line-up : UNION. R. P. I.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XXIV. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 11, 1900. o· ' UNION, o. The Me11 in Garnet Put Up a Desperate Strug~gle Against the Heavy . New Hampshire Eleven. Union's eleven did itself proud on Dart- mouth's campus last Saturday afternoon. It held the strong N e\v I-Ian1pshire eleven titne and again 011 do\vns, surprising the New Eng- landers by its ren1arkable grit. Not a Jnetn- ber of tlte eleven before the contest expected even a tie. but every 1nan \vent into the strug- gle determined to :fight to the finish. \Vhen time \vas called at the end of the second tvJen- ty minute half, Union held the ball on her own ten yard line, and neither side had scored. The game \vas, for Union, a victory, for she fought against a heavier and more experienced eleven. The contest \Vas gamely fought on both sides from start to finish. The play of the two tean1s was very even throughout, though Dartmouth did more of the advancing. The lines were evenly matched, for both sides fre- quently broke through the defence. The tackling \r-vas fierce and hard. Every man smashed in with a certain fearless abandon, playing the game to the lhuit. At titnes Dart- mouth played fast offensive football but often she fun1bled at critical points, and nearly as often could not make the necessary distance. Intense ex:citetnent prevailed throughout. The Dart1nouth undergraduates, though tu1i- fornlly cou.rteous in their treatn1e11t of the Union men; cheered their favorites to the echo and vainly cried ''Touchdown.'' Their hopes \Vere freqttently upset by a furnble or by a Union player's tackle of a Dartn1outh back before he had fairly started ·with the ball. In the first half, Darhnouth funtbled on Union's ten yard line; in the first part of the second, lvlarquette twice failed at an attetnpt for goal ·when :Union had the ball on Darttnouth'seight ya~d ltae; and at the end of the half Union held the IIanover 1nen for downs \vithin t'vo feet of the fatal goal line. Union played a clean gan12 in regard to holding the ball, b'Cing 111 uch superior to Dart- mouth in this respect. ;fhe elevens have a totally different style of play. Dartn1outh plays her backs close to the line and massed. ·She uses tile close interference. Her mass plays outside of the tackles are very effective. In the line, she outweighs Union. Still, her lin.e n1e11 had considerable difficulty in lland- ling those opposite them. Griswold is easily s~periot to the· Dartn1outh centre, Riley. Cap- tanl Lo\ve, at left guard, is a player of no mean ability. Foster and Brown, the two backs put in at the beginning of the second half, proved good tnen both on the offensive and defensive. In regard to the U niou line- up, it vvould be hard to pick the best tnan. Not a vvord of censure could be brought against a single player. The eleven played together with a vim and snap that was surprising. A feature of the game that 'vas pleasing to every Union man ·was the choice of referee. John ,V. H. Pollard, Dartmouth, '93, and 110\V a student at the Dartn1ot1 th l\1edical College, acted in that capacity. ~Ir. Pollard's intituate connection ·with Union's athletics during the past three :years endeared hint to every nleln- ber of the institution. The ga111e in detail : FIRST HALF. Dartmouth kicks off.

Carver makes ten yards around left end and the half ends \rith Union in possession on her tvventy-five yard line. Paige is hurt badly in this half on an at- tenlpted block of one of his punts, but gamely refuses to give up. SECOND HALF. It is seen that the contest is developing into a kicking ga1ne and 1\Iarquettc is accordingly substituted for \\Teed at quarter. Dartmouth vlaces four new backs 011 h€r eleven in this half. Marquette kicks to \Vhelau who ad- vances ten yards.

H._.:_Union put up a remark- . ably strong game against Dartmouth to-day, and by holding for downs at important stages, kept · the team from scoring, \V hich showed, in the . main, general superiority. Union gained her distance but once or twice in the entire game, while Dartmouth made repeated gains, but she could not keep the ball long enough to get a · touchdown, though she herself was partly to . blame on account of fumbling. Dartmouth's : line is tl1e best in years, but her backs are ' lamentably weak.-The Su1z. · HANoVER, N. !I.-Union kept Dartmouth from scoring to-day in the first game ever · played bet\veen the two colleges and one of the , best ever seen here. Dartmouth shovved great- · er strength in the tnain, but Union's defence served her sufficiently to recover the ball at critical points, several times inside her ten · yard line and once on the five yard line. · Dartmouth's defence \vas impregnable, and Union gained her distance only once or t\vice. · It \VaS a desperate defence, assisted by Dart- . mouth's fumbling, that kept Union from de- feat.-The T1ibune. Cornell, 6; Rochester, o. In connection \Vith this week's contest, the following clipping from the Co1nell Daily Sun of October fourth will be of interest : ''Y esteTday' s game, in which Cornell defeated Rochester by the score of 6-o, was poorly at- tended, marked by little enthusiasm and unin- terestjvg. ''It was not, however, a game primarily for spectat~s. Its purpose was to enable the coaches to test their ne\v material, and this purpose vvas well served. The \vork of the tean1, composed as it was of underclassmen, proved fairly~ good, and the coaches expressed themselves afterward as satisfied, on the \vhole; · with the results of the game. \Cornell's score was made early in the first half. Twice after that score did there seem a fair probability of another touchdown being made, but each time the attempt was unsuc- cessful. Rochester's eleven showed at various points of the game fairly creditable team play, but many fumbles were made, and not once \Vas Cornell's goal seriously threatened.\ Football Scores. ivtleclnesda;', October 3: Pennsylvania, 47; Franklin and lVIarshall, o.

TnE CHEERING in the Rochester game should be vigorous and enthusiastic. Now that cbeer leaders have been selected, the underg1·aduates should vie -with one another to support those leaders at every le- gi tin1ate opportunity. If the eleven knows the stu- dent body is supporting it, there need be no fear but that there will be a creditable showing on its part. 1\f El\IEETIS OF TRE FHESH1IAN CLASS Who Wish to COn1- pete for positions on the CoNconDIENsrs board should hand their names at once to one of the senior editors. It is hoped that a large· nun1ber o:f candidates will an- nounce themselves as such immediately. Instruc- tions will be given any freshn1a11 in regard to the The gan1e is a rightful cause of much rejoicing among Union n1en, both graduate and nndergraduatCl. Still, '·There is n1uch danger in over-confidence,\ as Re- publican newspapers are wont to say. The younger alumni have done their share of duty towJ.rd the col- lege by providing its eleven with a capable coach. The undergraduates have perforn1ed a share of their duty by liberally subscribing toward the legitimate expenses of the eleven, but there is yet another share unperforn1ed. l\fany n1en, fully rapable of doing actual field service for the success of the eleven, daily watch the practice fron1 the side lines. With such an eleven doing honor to Union, snch a state of affairs is not oul.v unfortunate but needless. No one will or can deny that a strong football eleven is a splendid advertisement to the institution it represents. It not only draws good athletic material, but also a greater number of students to the institution. Any nuder- gTaduate who feels he n1ay in any way strengthen the eleven by app~aring on the gridiron as a candidate for the scrub, should apply at the earliest opportunity for football clothes at the roo1n in south college. ~ ., .

THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XXIV. UNION ·COLLEGE, OCTOBER 18, 1900. No. 4. RO·CHESTER DEFEATED. In A Snappy Game Union Scores Eleven Po:i nts. After a hard, plucky struggle, Rochester was beaten on the campus last Saturday afternoon by a score of eleven to nothing. Brisk, though rather careless play was occasonally noticed on both sides.· Rochester played a dashing gatne throughout that \Vas net \vith a hard resis- tance. Union gave a snappy exhibition though she grew rqther over: confident after the first touchdown. It was a splendid day for football though the air \vas a trifle close. Despite the fact that the Continentals-Amsterdatn game dre\-v a large crowd at the driving park, the attendance \Vas large. The cheering \vas enthusiastic and vigorous. Rochester can1e to Schenectady rather confi· dent in her stre11gth. She had held Cornell do,vn to six points but ten days before. Louis Hinkey, Yale '97, f.ornter ly left end and full- back on the New Hav·en eleven, is coaching the team. He has put considerable dash into his men. The Rochester fullback, 1\forse, is one of the prettiest line hurdlers ever seen on the campus. His hurdling resulted in a number of good gains until the Union line finally solved the difficulty by upsetting hin1. Law- ton, at right half, follo·wed his interference 'vell. His defensive \York \vas oft-titues brilliant. Cooper and Baker both did good \Vork at left half. Kelly, the little end, tackled and \Vas down on the Jnlllts \veil. The eleven, as a \vhole, \vas evidently not in the best physical condition. Tin1e had to be frequently called. Carver did the most ground gaining for Union. Olmsted played a brilliant game at end. Rochester could gain little about either end.· Paige did. good \vork on the defensive as also did Mallery \Vho broke through t[ae opposing line several times. Finnegan ex- hibited his usual dashing play. Gris~.vold did well at centre. \Veed hurt his ankle duri11g the first half and· Marquette \vas substituted. He handled the ball poorly at times, though his punting was tnuch superior to that of either Cooper or Baker. Poor judgment 'vas shown by not kicking several times when there \vere five or more yards to gain on the third do\-vn. The elevens are about evenly matched in regard to weight though Rochester n1ay be a trifle the lighter. The fierceness of the con- test resulted in several mishaps. Kelly and Cooper of Rochester both turned their ankles badly. Weed retired early in the gan1e with a strained ankle. He may be out of the gan1e for a week or tnore. Union's first touchdown \vas n1acle in eight tninutes. Rochester's goal \vas threatened again in this half, but Union could not hold the ball. The second tottchdo\vn \vas tnade in the latter part of the second half: after several brilliant runs by Carver and Olmsted. Roch- ester made a nttn1ber of good gains in his half but she was forced to kick, or held for dovvns at critical points. The summary. FIRST HALF. Rochester, \vho defended the north goal, kicked off to Mallery vvho advanced the ball to the forty-five yard line, ·where he \\Vas downed by Pattison. Carver then \vent around the end for seven yards. ~1:allery \vas given the ball and funtbled. Pattison fell on it. Rochester failed to gain and Cooper punted to Weed, vvho ran to the forty-five

Mallery was given the ball and added eight yards to Union's advance. This '\vas followed by Paige for five yards, and shortly afterward Mallery ·went over the Hue for a touchdown, after five 111inutes of play. 1vfallery lost the ball on the play but Weed fell on it. Paige failed in the trial for a goal. Baker kicked to Mallery who was do\vned on the thirty-five yard line by Lawton. Olmsted made five yards, and was followed by Carver, who advanced the ball twenty-five yards. He '\vas ahead of the field but tripped over Cooper. Rochester, shortly _after, was given the ball for holding. La'\vton, Tolbert and Pattison made small gains. Cooper lost five yards on Mallery's tackle. Baker punted after the third down to Weed, '\vho fumbled and Kelly secured the ball. Morse bucked for seven yards and Union then held for downs. Union lost five yards on the double pass trick play. Weed was tal{en out no\v. Carver made five yards. Rochester then held for do\vns. Rochester, in turn, made no material gains and punted, the ball falling outside the lint. on the Garnet's twenty yard line. Union gained three yards by Mallery. Carver ad- vanced the ball three yards, but · the ball remained still for the next t\vo do'\vns, \vhen 1viarquette punted to Rochester's fifty yard line. Morse ·went throuch the center for . eighteen yards, and then n1ade t'\vo successive gains of four and three yards. Rochester advanced to Union's eighteen yard line. Then · Union held for dovvns. Paige kicked and time \vas called ·with the ball in the center of the field. Score-s-o, in Union's favor. S!CCOND HALF. In the second half, Union had the north goal to defend. Marquette kicked off to Cooper, who was downed after a short run. La \Vton secured six yards on two downs. Morse bucked for gains. Cooper made a slight advance, when Baker punted to Mallery . Union's ball. MaUery advanced the ball, three yards, when Union lost the ball on downs. Kelly and La \vton made three yards each, but, as no gains 'vere n1ade in two downs, Baker again kicked to Mallery. Finnegan lost three yards on a fumble. N (J gains were made in the next two do\vns and Marquette punted. The referee, however, brought the ball back, and penalized Rochester by the loss of ten yards for holding in the line. Union was then held for downs and Rochester secured the ball. Rochester failed to gain, and punted to Marquette, who was downed on Union's twenty-five ·yard line. 'rhebo n1ade five yards, followed by Paige for a run of thirteen yards more. Mallery gained three yards, \vhen Rochester obtained possession of the ball on dovvns. Rochester made no essential gains and kicl{ed to Paige, who was downed on Union's thirty yard line. Carver, at this juncture,, made the star run of the game, by covering fifty-five yards before he bit the turf. De Calesta took Kelly's place. Thebo gained five yards, and fifteen yards \Vere obtained by Oln1sted. The ball \vas then three yards from · Rochester's goal. It was only the work of a motnent to send Paige over the line for a touch- down. Marquette kicked a goal. Rochester kicked off to Olmsted \V ho fumbled and '\vas dovvned at the t·wenty-five yard line. 'I'hebo gained five yards, '\vhich was followed by losses by Oln1sted and Carver. Marquette punted to Cook. Rochester was unable to gain ancl kicked to Union's twenty yard line. Thebo tnake five yards. Successive losses again gave Rochester the ball. Morse made gains of four and two yards respectively. Baker then attetnpted a drop-kick from the field, which was very cleverly blocked. Time vvas called \vith the ball in Union's territory.

Let us suppose many.\ that a general election is to be held in a col- lege of say three hundred students. Among other officers to be elected is a base-ball man- ager to be chosen from the senior class. After three years in college it ought to be pretty clear just ·what members of the senior class are possessed of the qualities that should fit them for the position of base-ball manager. There will be son1ething less than half a dozen such men in a class of seventy-five. Are these men or any two of them put up in open competition to be voted for according to individual prefer- ences? Not at all. The Comanches, Apaches and Pawnees have previously got together and divided the spoils. The Comanches are to . have the base-ball manager. .A.ny Comanche will do. The Apaches are to have the foot-ball manager. Any Apache will do. 'rhe Pawnees are to have th.e n1anager of the track team. Any Pawnee will do. All votes are to be de- livered in blocks of five. The Crows, Black- feet and Oudens have got together meantime and made a like agreement upon like terms. Election comes. There is no real choice of candidates according to fitness, no individual · preference in casting ballots. It is slate against slate. Slate one wins. If chance will have a good man base-ball manager, why chance may have him a Comanche without his stir. Here's · Tammany out-Tammanined.

At the fall concert of the m uslcal association, the management expects to present a farce similar in character to the one given at the commencement concert last June, \The Bicyclers,\ or, to the ''Proposal under Diffi- culties,'' which was given the .)',.ear before. The character of the farce selected will depend largely on the number of men who are willing to undertake the female parts, as indeed the difficulty of presenting any farce consists in finding men for these parts. All those who desire to attempt anything of this kind and especially those \vho will take the female parts are requested to notify H. L. Crain, at the Alpha Delta Phi house. This should be attended to at once in order that work may be· begun on the lines. This notice is especially intended to discover any material in the class of 1904. H. J. BROWN, Manager. Alpha Delta Phi Initiation. The initiation ceremonies of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity were held at the chapter house Friday evening, October twelfth. The follow- ing are the initiates: Herbert Dod Allter of St. Johnsville, Robert Wilson Clark of Ames- bury, Mass., and Samuel Dimock Palmer of Ogdensburg, al11nembers of the class of 1904. A large number of alumni from the city and out of town, beside several fron: other chapters, were present.

STUDE~T :PARTICIPATION\ I~ CoLLEGEG·OYER~MEXT, an address by P1~of. Bennett })rinted in another column, bl'ings sharply to mind the urgent need for l'efonn in cDllege politics at Union. For 1nany years past, un- Jergradnate electious have been carrie(l through by means of traclee, deals and selfish co1nbinations. Class elections hnse co1ne to be n1erel y tt clash of slate against slatf\, fraternity con1bine agaii1st ft·aternity eon1bine. General college elections, tl1ough o~casion- . ·~ '\: .. , ; . .. . ally fair fights in the open between good n1en:, have for the most part been hut repetitions of the rlass elections. Snccessfnl candidates who are now the free choice of a 111ajority of the electors are the ex A ception rather than the rule. Eefore the dass elec- tion in sophon1ore year, se-reral fraternity delegations con1hine and agree upon the spoils £or that ancl en- suing yearB. The non~fraternity eimnent usually · votes as a unit. In the larger election, the same general plan of can1 pa.ign is the san1e. Union 111en are fully conv,ersant with the evil effects of this 'vorth· less system. The poorer man often secures the better man's rightfLll position; inter-fraternity hostility in- creaecs while college spidt decreases; .student organi- zntions suffer through the apathy of disgruntled sup- porters of the losing tieket. Pointed substantiation of these statements is not necessary nor politic; the . facts are plainly evident on the surface. The ren1edy? There is one-an inter-fratet·nity agremnent, stwlent !'(:solutions and 1~egulations, -coupled with a cheerful obedience to the will of the n1ajority and a more general desire for co-operation in all stu <lent affairs. The inter-fraternity agreen1ent? A pledge of honor by every fraternity to abstain frmu every con1bine or deal and that its n1embers will vote as individuals and not as a unit. It is not to be ex- pected that fraternity men vvill vote against a candi- date of their own band,but furthertl1an this, the plan ought easily to stand a practieal test. The student resolutions'? On the san1e idea as the inter·fraternity agremnent. They would simply 111ake the idea 1nore popular. The regulations? Any fair system of non1· inations and clean elections. The Australian ballot is used at son1e of the universities. It is inexpensive and would certail1ly prove satisfactory. An object of the undergraduate council is ''to foster bealt.l1y col- lege spirit, and to keep college politics clean.'' The 1900 council did n1any excellent things but it did not have the tilne to fully discuss this 1natter. The 11ew couneil can and should 1nake an earnest effort to solve the difficulty. The Co~coRDIE~srs will gladly pub- lish any con1munication in rPgal'd to the subject. J , . . , . • 'i 4 'l ' 1 ;

TH~E SEC.RET OF ·THE HIGHEST ART.\ ,Rev. Mr. Brown•s Add .. ess at the 'Sunday Vespe·r Service. The Rev Mr. Brovvi1 of the State St. Methodist church filled the place of Charles M. Sl1eldon who was expected to talk to the students in the chapel Sunday afternoon. Mr. Bro\vn took for his subject, \The Secret of the Highest Art.'' He said the secret of the highest art is an ' 'adequate expression of the ideal'' and then substantiated the statetnent by tnany \vell-chosen thoughts and comparisons. \It is easy to think and dreatn of ideals, but it is another thing to put them into concrete forn1. Yet \Ve treasure those men. w l1o do give some adequate expression of the ideal. In this art of adequate expression of ideals there is no option for us. 'there is a higher art \Ve must all follow ,-the one acknowledged Master to whom more than human nature and kind- ness were ascribed. \Vl1en great ...men die a darkness does fall upon us. I do not wonder that men felt the loss of Jesus Christ. With the advent of Christ n1en began to think and we find them addressing them set ves to this higher art. Paul took him as a teacher.\ ' 'You cannot tell vv hat a man is \vhen you have exhausted all the forces that lie around him. You must look on into the future. You never can tell what a man is unless you know \vhat he is ain1ing at. No man has the right to live a day without choosing the manhood of Jesus. Cleave to Him. He is conscience in- carnate. lie is the one to whom -we can all turn.'' ''But mere example will not make us good. Paul found his feelings controlled because Jesus Christ came to live in him. We need this indwelling of the Divine. I beg you to make choice of this ideal and follow it. I would advise you to adopt the program of this wonderful Galilean and you \vill have a divine consciousness of the good and true.'' ' ,.~-- ' / ••• •·

Union put up a gritty exhibition of the col'lege gan1e against Cornell at Ithaca last Saturd~ty. Aggressive play was the rule on both sides though fut11bling by Marquette caused Utaion to lose several good chances to get the ba 11 further down in Cornell's territory. Cornell's play was also rather loose in this respect. Union's line held firn1 throughout the ga tne and Cornell could n1ake little advances in tl1at direction. The majority of the httters ga.ins were made by Purcell, the left half bac]{~ in straight or cross bucks about the tackles. Utdon made a nutnber of good advances through Cor- nell but, for the n1ost part played a kicking gatne in which Marquette easily out pun ted Coffin. The game abounded in exciting plays. Cor- nell got the ball several times down to the five yard line only to be held for downs. During the second half, she fumbled when within the ten yard line. Thebo seized the ball and went down the field yards ahead of anyone. It looked like a touchdown but little Taussig vvas after him with a dash and caught him on the forty yard line. Cornell was not represented by an eleven of largely substitute players, as has been stated in some despatches. Eight regular 'varsity tnen were on the team. Captain Starbuck was away witnessing the Princeton-Lafayette gan.1e and t~ro others were on the \laid-off\ list. Every other man who played is at present the best choice for his respective position. Cornell easily outplayed Union on the offensive but, all things considered, wasatbestUnion'sequalon the defensive. Ohnsted had little difficulty with Taussig, the much talked-of left end. He got around a number of titnes for tackles that resulted in considerable losses. The Cornell ends were, however, down the field on punts in quicl{er time. Thebo proved a match for Cross. Natnack, the Cornell centre, proved a strong tnan in his position. Griswold played an excellent game against hitn. Coffin, a fresh- tnan, in the absence of Captain Starbuck, was placed at fullback. Warner, at left guard, is a very strong tnan. Purcell, at left half, put up the best exhibition for the Ithacans. The Union eleven played together with a dash and vitn that was ready for every attack of the opposing line. The two tackles, Fenton and Finnegan, did good \vork in stopping the advance. Shaw and Collier fairly held their own at left and right guard. Mallery, Paige and Carver went in every scri 111m age with effect. Mallery's knee troubled hin1 considerably during the gatne and Slack vvas finally substituted for him. The men were up against a stronger and much heavier eleven so that the stnall score is certainly a credit to thetn. Several unfortunate fun1bles lost a good chance to keep the score tnuch lower than it really was. Cornell's first touchdown was rna de early in the first half, and her second late in the second half. Union, on all other occasions, tnanaged to hold for downs when the Red and White was in dangerous proxitnity to the goal line. The game in detail:. FIRST HALF.

THE OONOORDIENSIS. AMHERST ABOLISHES CANE RUSH. Undergraduates Vote It Down By a Large Majority. Arnherst has foUowed close after Rutgers in the abolition of the annual sophotuore-freshn1an cane rush. At a recent college tneeting, 296 out of 329 votes were cast in favor of the reso- lution abolishing the custom. A cotnn1ittee was appointed to consider the adoption of some other contest which. would equally invigorate class and college spirit. An editorial frotn the \Atnherst Student\ of the preceding week is clipped for this issue. \The opening of another college year again brings up the rnuch debated question of the cane rush. Whether it shall continue to exist as a tin1e-honored custon1 or whether it shall be abolished in the future. The fact that it is a time-honored custorn is about the only excuse for its contiHuance. But like many other tra- ditional customs has it not outlived its useful- ness ? The cane rush was established years ago when the conditions of college life were far different than tl1ey are at present. The conduct of college students has been revolutionized within the last few years, so that public senti- nlent no longer countenances wilful destruction of property and injury to person by college students. Unwarranted violence is no longer shielded nor does it deserve to be shielded by the veil of tole1·ation for college pranks, when these pranks are of such a nature as to irnperil the physical welfare of any person. Fortunately the cane rush held last Saturday night was not attended with any serious results, yet the charac- ter of the cane rush is certainly unusually dan- gerous. The expet·ience of other colleges in cane rushes this year has not been so happy as our own. Were the rush last Saturday night attended with set·ious results there is no doubt that the college sentiment would condemn the custorn without further question. Why then should we postpone this condetnnation until s,erious results do happen, which aln1ost by miracle have se far been avoided ? No one will deny that the position of some of the men in any cane rush is a hazardous one, yet the custom is supported and even encouraged by the tnajority of students-· a position which seen1s hard~y consistent with that regard for our fellow students' welfare which should inspire every true and upright college man. After sufficient investigation and consideration solne contest to take the place of the cane rush can be decided upon which will be satisfactory to the college and at the same time will be free from all ele- tnents of serious danger to the participants.\ UNION WINS SUIT. Valuable Piece of Property Recovered From the Borough of Queens. Justice vVilliatn J. Gaynor has decided in favor of the plaintiff in the case of the Trustees of Union College of the City of Schenectady against the City of New Yorl{, in which Union College sought to recover a tract of land con1- prising half a block given to Long Island City in r873, for the site of a City Hall. T'he Justice allows $3,300 damages for loss sustained in withholding the land frorn the claitnants for hvo and one-half years, the period elapsing since the beginning of the suit. The Justice holds that the twenty-seven years which ha\·e elapsed since the date of the gift, have been a reasonable allowance of ti1ne in which to ha\·e cotnplied with the conditions, and that, as Long Island City has been absorbed by New York, and now has no corporate existence, it no longer has the power to cotnply with the conditions nmned in the deed. The land in question is a triangular piece near St. J oht1's Hospital, with a frontage of 345 feet in Jackson street, 265 feet in Twelfth street, and zoo feet in Ely avenue. It is said to be worth frotn $zo,ooo to $3o,ooo. President Bowley of the Borough of Queens, in his testi- mony at the recent trial, said that it was worth at least $5o,ooo to the city for the site of a bot·ough hall.

8 THE CONOORDIEN,SIS. TQACK ATHLETIC MEET. Freshmen Win Out By Margin of 29 P·oints. Seniors Take Second Place. The annual fall track athletic meet was held last Wednesday at the Driving Park and resulted in a victory for the freshn1·en. In spite of the raw and chilly weather, considerable interest was taken in the event and although the attend- ance was not so large as 1night have been expected the results -vvere 1nost satisfactory. The principal features of the meet were the excellent work of Kline, 1901, Griffith, 1902, and Langlois, 1904. All three of these men showed unusual speed and endurance. Lang- lois, I 904, will prove a great addition to the track teatn in the bicycle events.

I . I i ! I \ THE CONCORDTENSlS. 9 PROSPECTS FOR THE WILLIAMS GAME. How is Union cotning out in the Williatns gan1e? No one can tell. Her chances for suc- cess are excellent. Sorne co1nparative scores indicate a tie gatne; others, a Union victory. Yet these scores, especially during the early part of the season, are no sufficient criterion upon which to base a prophecy. Williatns, according to every showing to date, has a weaker eleven than when the Garnet n1.et her one year ago. Union, everyone knows, is stronger to-day than at any tirne during the past three or four years. Last fall the score resulted twelve to five in the Purple's favor. Last Saturday ILunilton ploughed through \Villiams' line at every point. )'.,.et the Purple sho\\. 7 ed during the second half rernarkably strong recovering powers. Hatnilton scored twelve points to her opponents' blank yet once she was in itnrnediate danger of being scored upon. Union's defence in the Cornell gan1e was brilliant, to say the least. She could make little in offensive play for the Ithacans have a line composed of n1uch heavier and n1ore experienced n1.en. Tbe average weight of the Willian1s line is not authoritatively known but it is supposed to be somewhat heavier than that of the Garnet. Last year Cornell was weak while Colun1bia was strong at the season's opening. Cornell V\ras beaten in a preliminary game while Colutn- bia defeated Yale at about the sarne titne. Before the season closed, Gornell defeated Princeton and literally s·wept the ground with Colutnbia. Over-confidence and over-training were the causes. Union should be in danger of neither. Shaw's exhibition in the Cornell gatne shovvs that his collar-bone is fairly strong. He certainly showed fe'\lv signs of having any- thing the tnatter with him. vVeed's ankle is fast getting strong and he is out on the field again. Mallery has a bad knee but he is play- ing with a d&sh that has seldotn been seen on the Union campus. Coach Srnith is not over- taxing his 111en but is giving tbetn plenty of fast, light practice. Several defects in the eleven are being rem.edied and the R. P. I. game ought to show the improvement. AU in all, Un,ron ought to 1nake an excellent showing on theca rnpus at Williatnstown next Wednesday. A TIE GAME. Both Juniors and Freshmen Fail To Score. 1904- as an aggregation played her first gan'le on the carnpus in the inter-class series Monday afternoon. The nun1ber of enthusiastic students that occupied the side-lines was unusually large. As a class g-ame, it was a very pretty exhibition of skHl, spirit and pluck. Neither side was able t<> score though the freshn1en \vere inside the five yard line during the first half. The fres:htnen kicked ofr and, securing the ball on a fun1ble, showed good forrn in bucking I 902 's center until held for downs on the £ve yard line. 1\'he features of the half were long runs by Raytnond and Small. Cronkhite made a pretty try for goal. 1\'he second half displayed generally even play, vvitb a nun1ber of punts by Cronkhite and end n~ns by Raytnond. Sherrill and Watson always gave r 904's ends timely assistance. rrhe line-up follows : 1904. POSITIONS. 1902, Lansing ............. left end .............

Y., as second- class matter. Ctas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. HARRY ALVIN BARRETT, 1901, has been elected to the business managership of The Concordiensis for the retnainder of the college year. Mr. Bar- rett assutnes entire control of the business end of the paper during his term of office. The paper is to be printed in Schenectady, at the same estab- lishment which has published it in former years. THE UNDERGRADUATE COUNCIL is considering means for the installation of purity in Union college politics and earnestly desires suggestions and pla11s in regard to the tnatter from students and faculty. Open communications will be gladly received by this paper. WITH PROPER SUPPORT Union can beat Williams next Wednesday. Without that support, the Purple may repeat her victory of last year. Everyone who can afford the fare to Williamstown and return and can secure bolts in l1is day's work, should go over with the tean1 prepared to give the best kind of encouragement from the side.-lines. The management desires one hundred men to accompany the eleven. The number should be easily secured. THE CLASS of '81 is the first among the decen- nial ,classes to take active steps toward a reunion at the coming commencement. This paper wUl do all in its power to assist the class committee in its efforts. Last year, during the spring tenn, a short history of each. member of the decennial classes was published. A sinila.r effort will again be made this year. Assistance is asked from members of '41, '51, '61, '71, '76, '81, '91, '96 and '98, and cordial cooperation with every class committee is promised in return. All communi- cations and letters of information in regard to the '81 reunion should be addressed to Dr. William M. White at Amsterdam, N. Y. A MATTER that presents itself at this time is that of repTesentativeship on The Concordiensis board. There is always open competition, not for the freshtnen alone, but also for members of the other classes, so that strict attention to work is necessary for maintaining positions. However, this should appeal especially to freshtnen, as a large number is chosen frotn that class at the end of the spring term, to serve on the board during the sophomore year. As is customary, all those desiring to compete, should register their names before the first of December. There are at present several good men who are doing first-class work. But, on consider- ing the place that this publication holds in the activity and life of old Union, it seems strange that more do not express their willingness to do so. There is still time left in which the students tnay enroll themselves. Let all who have a tendency for newspaper work, come forward and enjoy the advantages to be derived fro111 embracing this opportunity. . .:.t 1 •'t . \.t

1 •'t . \.t THE CONO·ORDIENSIS. 11 THE IMPORTANCE of a s,trong scrub to the suc- cess .of the football team cannot be overestimated. This year we have a successful eleven, and its ·efficiency is in a great measure due to the strong scrub that has lined up against it from day to day. But the enthusiasm that pervades the earlier part of the season, is apt to die out after a time and leave the 'varsity without an effective scrub the latter part of the season. In order to guard against this and at the same time to reward the members of the second eleven for their faithfulness in co1ning out every day, the manage1nent has decided to use the receipts, above actual expenses, of the Election day game with the Washington Continentals to send eleven men of the scrub to New Brunswick when the 'varsity plays Rutgers at that place. It is hoped that this scheme can be carried out as it will in some degree repay the scru lJ players for their hard and consistent work during the entire season. AMONG THE MANY ADVANTAGES offered at Union, that of the literary societies seems to be doomed to eternal neglect. Year by year interest has fallen off, until now there is rarely sufficient attendance at the meetings to make a quorum. Attet-:ttion to other branches of work, the rapid growth of athletics, and fraternity interest, have been the causes of this condition. Yet despite all this, it seems reasonable that, as it takes but one hour a week, the students should be able to devote this amount of time to the debating societies. It is needless to give any particulars; but for the infor- nlation of the freshn1en, the two societies are the Adelphic and the Philomathean. Debates are held once a week, and the notices of such are posted at a sufficient time previous to allow study upon the subject. In regard to the prizes offered yearly, the college catalogue gives full informa- tion. The plea now presented is that the student body arouse some interest in this work. The past history of these organizations shows their value, and the reasons for their preservation. The societies must maintain their important position, and this requires some show of interest on the part of the students. VESPE~ SE~VlCE. The Rev. Joseph W. Miller of the Park Place Chapel addressed the students at the vesper service Sunday afternoon. He took for his text the words of Paul: \But this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before.\ ''It was Paul's motto all through life to forget the things that were past. All college students know that in a foot race tl~e tn,en first are on the alert for the signal ' get set,' and then with the signal to start they spring into the race forgetting everything but pressing toward the coveted goal. This is the picture of Paul's spiritual life. There are some things in the starting of every life that we \\Vant to forget and it is right. The man who constantly holds in his tnind the picture of his past sin is going to recorntnit that sin, but the n1an who forgets his past sins will not repeat thetn. As with Paul so it is safe for many other men in our titne to forget their past sins and ignore tbetn cotnpletely so long as they put their trust and faith in Christ. ''Having once started in the race the path may not always be stnooth. Thera n1ay be many ups and downs ; tnany obstacles in the way. All of us, no doubt, have tried to do Christian work and failed. Forget this failure of the past and, ever keeping an eye on Christ and remembering how he overcame obstacles in the way, try again to win the race. \Looking over the life of Paul we find that his life was not free frotn hardships. We find him driven from one place to another in a \vay which would have discouraged many of us. Yet he bore these hardships courageously and went on doing Christian work without allowing himself to be influenced by his past failures. He is even stoned frotn one town yet he goes right on and preaches at the next town trusting that the truth of his own convictions will in time be brought to the light. \Let us take for example, two business tnen who have both failed. The one profits by bis failures and n1akes the1n stepping stones to higher things. The other is discouraged and

12 TliE CONCORDIEl~SIS. lays aside all thoughts of resurni ng busi:tuess on a better scale. As a result the blow is to(:) rnuch for hitn and his life becom:es a failure. \But it is no tnore important to fo1·g-et faHHres than to forget successes. Yon tnen ;}~ere in college know that in every class there will ' always be two or three men who will :carry ofr all the p1·izes. But that should not discourage you at all. Dr. Palton of Princeton says, 'It is the rnediocre man who wins success in the world. And why? Because the rna:n oif suc- cess lool<s back and not for·ward.' So i;t is in1portant if we do ·win anything in this world to look forward and not backwa1·d or vv:e wiH forget the goal towards Clu·,ist. \And then it is i1nportant that we should exercise our will power if we are going- to win the race towards Christ. God can't use ~ tnan that looks back on his success. It I~equires a great deal of will-power to keep you:netf frotn looking back on past successes. But :Jet us choo~e the path which Paul took, n<>t the crooked path, but the straight one. Then let us keep ()Ur eyes fixed constantly on tl1e goal, on Christ. If vve look aside we are sure t() lose the race. The crown in this life ~in fade away but the crown which Paul vv<>n by choosing Christ as his goal and pressing stead- fastly onward ib eternal. My tnotto is~ 'Press for\vard, forgetting things that are past.' If you run faithfully you1· 1·eward will be rich, b.e1·e in college and hereafter.\ FOOTBA.LL SCORES. WEDNESDAY, OcTOBER I 7 ..

Tb.e First Part of the Tennis Tourna- Professor Opdyke has been unable to 1neet ment ·Concluded. his classes recently because of illness. In one of the best matches ever seen on the college courts, John H. Cook, 1901, defeated ArthurS. Raymond, 1902, in the final round of the annual fall tennis tournament. The tnatch was for the best three out of five and the full number of sets had to he played. The last one was especially exciting, for the games alternated between the two tnen until \nine all'' was reached. Then Cook, by dint of hard driving, won out in the two next games. T'he other tnatches in the singles were between Merriman, 19or, G. W. Donnan, 1903; Ray- tTIOild, 1902, and Merrin1an, 1901. Merriman won the former, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1, while Raymond was the victor in the latter contest by the score -6-4, s-·7' 6-o. The championship doubles are being played off very slowly. The matches have constantly to be postponed by reason of football practice by 'varsity, sct·ub, or class team n1en. The tnanagetnent expects to conclude the tourna- ment before tl1e end of Indian summer. The results of contests to date follow. Cook, 1901, and Metzger, 1902, vs. Wagoner, 1901, and Raymond, 1902.

Manager Miller has fixed upon Election Day afternoon as the titne for the game with the local Washington Continentals. Paige, 1900, and Cook, 1901, played exhi- bition tennis on Wednesday last. The sets resulted, 6-4, 6-z, in Paige's favor. Professor Olin H. Landreth has been making an investigation for the Public Itnprovement Cotn mission of Cohoes, to settle a controversy.

14 THE OONCORDIENSIS. ONLY !Fl~A TEQNITY OF ITS KIND. Seattle <ireek Letter Alumni Organize Under the Name of Pi Epsilon. G. V. P'. Lansing, '83, a resident of Seattle, WasbingtoJJ, sends a clipping frotn the Seattle ''rfitnes\ teHing of the organization of a curious fraternity in that city. It will be of interest to college 1nen in generaL \Seattle now has a club which is absolutely unique. Saturday night Pi Ep5ilon Fraternity was organi2ed. This is a secret society whose n1embers are alun1ui of Atnerican National Greek letter fraternities whose chapters exist only in the colleges of liberal arts in universities of recognized standing. Pi EpsHon Fraternity is the only alu1nni inter-fraternity in the world. \Since tl1e beginning of the present century Greek letter fraternities have existed in the 1 uajority of the larger American colleges. These o-rew and :tJ1rived untB the civil war when there h • • was a great loss of interest in such organizations. Interest q tdckly revived after the war and today they seen\l to be in the hey-day of their prosper- ity. vVhat the objects of the Greek letter fr~ternities are, probably everyone knows- tnutual assistance, b1·otherbood and the like. The n1ystet·ies of each order serve to bind the n1en togeth:er. There are existing in American colleges about twenty large national fraternities of tnany diapters each, and several stnaller ones. Besides tl1 ese there are several \inter-frats ''class-frats\ and '~professional-frats,\ the latter being frate1:nities whose chapters exist only in profession~! schools. '~In rnan .. y cities alumni associations or clubs have been fonned atnong those Greek letter tnen, who, in their college days, were metnbers of son1e one fraternity. So far as The Times is informed, an inter-fraternity among Greek letter 1nen has Ilever even been proposed before. Certain! v ~i Epsilon is the only one whose .. organizati()n has been cotnpleted. \The tfl()Vement was begun not quite two weeks ago. A week ago Saturday night a pre- liminary meeting ~ras held. Fourteen Greek letter tn etl- were present and discussed the fonnation .of an association. It was the unani- :mous senthnent of those present that the organi- zation should take the form of a fraternity. Committees were appointed .and letters read from those who wished to be counted in, but who could not be present. Forty-four charter n1ernbers will shortly forrnally organize. Fifteen fraternities will be repl-esented.\ QEPUBLlCAN CLUB OI{GANIZES. Its First Demonstration Shown at Bryan's Expense. The Republican Club of Union was organized last Thursday and the following officers were elected : President, J 0ohn MeN ab, r 901 ; sec- retary, D. C. Griffith, 1902; treasurer, D. V. Clute, 1902; executive co1ntnittee, McNab, Griffith, Clute, Parsons, 1902; J(reusi, 1903. The object of the club is to promote and P romulo-ate the doctrines of the Republican b • party and contribute in every way poss1 ble to the success of that party in the coming election. The first act of loyalty was done last Thurs- day morning when Mr. Bryan, the Democratic candidate, spoke in this city. Hardly had Mr. Bryan descended fro1n the platform when the club, aided by a number of others, rushed in and raising the structure bodily frotn the ground proceeded to n1arch ·up Union street to the college where the p]atf()rtn was used at night to illuminate the Republican club demonstration.
