The Law Department of the University held its forty-ninth cotnmencement exercises at Odd Fellow's hall in Albany Thursday evening. A111asa J. Parker, president of the board of trustees, presided. On the stage were seated Postlnaster-General Charles Etnory Smith, '6r ; the Hon. J. Newton Fiet:o, college, '67, dean of the I a w school ; President A. V. V. Ray- mond; the Hon. D. Cady Herrick, C. J. Buch- anan, Marcus T. Hun, college, '67, C. E. Arger- singer, Fletcher Battershall, and other tnetnbers of the board of trustees and of the faculty. In accordance with a new ctJstom, orations by the graduates were entirely dispensed with and, in their place, an address of ti tnely inter- est was delivered by the Hon. Charles Emory Smith, Postn1aster-General of the United States. His speech follows in part: ''' Gentletnen of the Graduating Class: I can- not welcome you as a lawyer to the lawyers' ranks. It is not tny good fortune to speak as a tnember of the honorable guild. But as a dis- interested layn-utn; fully appreciating its great position and its glorious opportunities, I can bid you God-speed as you enter upon a noble profession, which has been so closely identified with the intellectual, social and moral progress of the race, and with the steady advance of civil liberty. \ One most agreeable duty falls to n1e at the outset. I bring you the filial and fraternal greet- ings of the President of the United States. Like you, he is a graduate of the Albany Law School. Like you from this hour, he is enrolled among the alun1ni of this honored h1stitution. Here he cul~ivated those lofty attributes of mind and character and nurtured those just principles of action which, in a:n admini,stration of great deeds and world-wide leadership, have sb .. ed new luster on the republic. With grateful m~em­ ories of his early association rb•et~e, he sends loyal and loving sentiments of g()od will and best wishes to all who, like him, honor and revere this cherished alma rnater. '' Though not a lawyer, the:t-e is perhaps less incongruity in tny presence on this occasion than might first appear. For several years a trustee of Union University, 1 had an indirect official, ]f not a direct professional, connection with its departn1ent of law. Returning, as I arn, to rny old and beloved horue, looking again upon familiar and precious scenes, clasping once 111ore the hands of treasut·ed friends of my youth and early 1nanhood-· alas, how many have joined the n1ajority !-teerr:1ing recollections of the past cotne thronging upon ·me, and I am carried back to the bright and eager days around which clustered the h<>pes and joys of the springtime of life. '\If titne pennitted, I might speak of many who extended and perpetuated tl1at early group of legal guides. Standing on ,the rolls of this institution, you go forth with the best tt·aditions into the ranks of your chosen profession. The lawyer's sphere of action and field of usefulness and range of influence are steadily expanding. The open pathways of success are more varied if not n1ore alluring than ever before. The court roon1 was forn1erly the .chief arena of the !awyer's activity; but now his talents are la1·gely en1ployed in creating the instrutnentalities of business and con1tnerce. His object is not to excite, but to avoid litigation, and his best, tnost honorable and 1nost lucrative service is often rendered, not in the puhlic forutn, but in the private council chatnber where his trained know ledge and wise guidance point out the pathways of safety, security attd peace. \The tendency and the inevitable necessity

6 THE CONOORDIENSIS. of modern conditions is the division of labor and the development of specialties. In the wide range of law the:!:e are the tendencies and the rewards of speeialistn, and while the general practice must always offer its attraction, the de- n1ands and the inducetnents of exceptional equiptnent in special fields will pre:sent their appeal. But underlying all are the Senne ele- mental prir1cipl,es which are the foundation of the broad te,mp[e of law with all its courts and corridors, and those principles, based on right and justice and equity, are the 1nunitnents and the safeguards of the social and political fabric. '' It is an auspicious time to enter on your pt·ofession. Devoted as you may be to its ex- acting demands, you cannot fail to take a lively interest in the current discussions of the day. The alert and intelligent lawyer, with an open and eager n1ind,, Iuust naturally be attracted by the new problen1s of national policy and gov- ernmental authority which now present thetn- selves for solution. Whatever may be your view, whatever differences of opinion tnay be aroused, these probletns of national destiny and world magnitude are calculated to uplift the whole level of public thought and discussion. \The decisive leadership and tnoulding de- termination of these questions, subject to the final approval of the people, fall within the ex- ecutive and legislative authority. But the de- termination of tbe fundatnental questions of national power and constitutional right must pass under judicial review for conclusive adju- dication. Whatever tnay be our differences in the preliminary contests, whatever n1ay be our party struggles, it is the exetnplary habit of the American people to accept the judgment of the courts. Public opinion does not always accept the infallibility of judicial proceedings. But there is a universal recognition of the truth that there must be tribunals of last resort, to whose judgment all tnust bow. '' The standard of the bench should be the standard of the hal'. So far as your influence extends, it is placed in your keeping. It is for you to maintain the best traditions and the highest honor of the great cotnpany whose names have illuminated the annals of the state and nation. You go forth upon your career with the training of a gt·and institution, with the precepts of leat·ned and faithful instructors, with the exatnple and the inspiration of illustri- ous leaders of the p1·ofession, whose wise guid- ance and noble achievements in council and in court have emphasized the possibilities open before you ; and it is for you to prove yourselves wodhy of the glorious record which is now con- fidently committed to your hands.'' At the conclusiou of the address, General Parker awarded the several prizes as follows: J. Ralph Hilton, the Edward Thomson Cotn- pany prize, a set of the ''American and Eng- lish Cyclopaedia of Laws,\ for the best thesis on sotne legal subject assigned by the dean ; William R. Whitfield, the Amasa J. Parker prize of the value of $5o to the tnetnher of the graduating class l1aving the highest standing in deportment and in the per:fo rmance of general duties; Charles D. Phillips, the faculty prize of $2 5 to the student next in n1erit ; Henry R. DeW itt, the '' Dean~' prize given by J. Newton Piero, a set of '' Special Actions\ and '' Spec- ial Proceedings\ from his own pen ; S. G. Hatl1eway Turner, college '98, the Matthew Bender prize, a set of the \Atnerican Electri- cal Cases,'' to the student gaining the higbest mark in the exatninations on the subject \Cor- porations.\ The president of the university, Dr. Ray- mond, after a short speech full of advice, awarded the diplomas and certificates of one year's legal study. The class nutnbered thirty- three, one of whom is a young wotnan, Miss Frances A. Van Santford. Miss Van Santford received :first honorable tnention for the Edward Thotnson Company prize. M~S. ~AYMO:ND'S QECEPTION. 1\{rs. Raymond gave her annual reception to the n1e1nbers of the senior class last Saturday afternoon. Aside from the tnem bers of the fac- ulty and seniors a number of out of town people were present. A vet-y 'pleasant time was had by all present.

Union's playing was below the average, whiJe the Dartmouth men gave an excellent exhibition of ball. Union's outfield was kept busy in the morning's gan1e and did very pretty work.

This was the second game of the western trip and was very encouraging after the defeat at Syracuse the day before. The victory was the result of the fine work of our battery and their excellent support by the infield. On her part Hobart put up a most ragged exhibition. of baseball, and her defeat was largely due to the poor work of Wills at short. Folger was put in at the end of the fifth inning. The score: UNION.

The track tean1left for Syracuse on Tues- day afternoon, going on to Geneva on the morn- , ingof Decoration Day. A fire within a block of the hoteltn Syracuse prevented the substitute tnen from o-etting in their usual amount of sleep, and some ~f them felt the eflect of the loss of it the next day. It dt·izzled all the morning in Geneva, but about noon the skies brightened and the assetn- bled athletes got a glirnpse of old ''Sol.\ A beautiful afternoon followed, with a slight breeze, not enough, however, to interfere with the running on the track. DeCalesta and :Brown, both of Rochester, proved to be the stat· athletes of the meet, the former winning eighteen and the latter fifteen points. Griffith followed a close third with thirteen points to his credit. Aside from DeCalesta and Brown, none of the Rochester men especially distinguished themselves, except Holmquis, who took one and one-third firsts and one second, and Glass, who out-threw Finegan by over twelve feet, and took third in the shot put. Wa1·ner, Palmer and Shepard showed them- selves the only point-winners for Hobert. Palmer took the mile bicycle, the only £rst to Hobert's credit.

Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- ela.ss matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THE DEATH by drowning, of S. Leon Bahny, 1902, comes as a bitter blow to everyone who knew him and felt his kindly, generous nature. The college deeply mourns its loss and extends its heart-felt sytnpathy to the bereaved family. THE CLASS OF '95 will hold a reunion this year in eel ebration of the fifth anniversary of its gradu ation. This paper has endeavored to secure as complet-e a history as possible of the doings of its member-s since graduation and publishes the result it in tbis issue. The fraternities have been the main source of information. The list is not complete but is as accurate as could be made under the cir- cumstauces. A copy of this issue will be sent to every living '95 man in the hope that it may increase the attendance commencement week. ! ' '· THE RESULTS of the prest:!l~t baseball season show the effects of good managetnent. From the start Manager Tuggey has. shown the deepest interest in his team, and has. :carried out his pro'\ posed schedule of games to :tlle letter. With the hearty support of the. athletic board, he has per- formed his duties in such a w.ay as reflect credit upon the institution and demand the thanks of every student and alumnus of (} 1d Union. AT THE college meeting held last Monday the question of a campus-tax was broug-ht up for dis- cussion. When we consider the ·difficulties attached to the customary methods of eollecting n1oney to defray athletic expenses, the benefits of the tax now being agitated readily show themselves. Every term it has been the peq>etu al cry of ''pay your subscriptions,'' and the :martyred collectors with wan and weary looks, draw out their thank- less existence. Viewing the question from all sides, the surest and most impavtial method seems to be,-to place the matter ir1to the hands of the trustees, and have the studenJs meet the athletic expenses with stated payments, set down as college fees. This is not original with Union, as it has met with success in various h1stitutions. The adoption of this scheme would pl!ace athletics on a firmer basis, financially and otnerwise. EVERY YEAR about this time there is expressed a sentiment among many of the sindents advocating an earlier commencement. It 1s argued that com- mencement week at Union comes later than at almost any other institution, and. the many students who obtain positions during the summer vacation are obliged to leave college before the close of the term and miss the entire commencement week. We understand that the only trJ.eans of bringing the graduating exercises at an earlier date in June lies in shortening the various -vacations which come during the course of the college year, .and also, perhaps, in beginning work sooner in the fall. Now there are many wh·o protest against any such action, and the question so becomes one involving no little difference <>f opinion. The Concordiensis recognizes this, aud desires to

The usual comtnence·tnent exercises will be held this yet1tr and protnise to be n1ore largely attended than usual. In addition to the reunions of the classes of '40, '50, '6o, '7o, '75, 'So, '85, '90, '95, and '97, the fact that 1900 is the last class in the century and that this year is the 105th anniversary will contrib_ute largely to the interest. The order of exercises will be as follows: SUNDAY, JUNE 24. 7:30 P. M. -· Baccalaureate Sermon by President Raymond. MONDAY, JUNE 25. 3 P.

The feeling of anticipation, among the mem- bers of the senior class especially, and in a less degree, among the rest of the college n1en, in regard to the class book, has at last been dis- pelled by the appearance of the book. The I goo book is similar in appearance to that of last year. The binding is morocco of a gar- net colot·, stamped in gold, with the natne of the owner and Union, Igoo, in gold letters. It is a book of one hundred and sixty pages. The title page and class officers occupy the first two pages. Then follow the \Song to Old The members of the Senior class enjoyed their last banquet as undergraduates Friday evening. Only three n1e1nbers of the class were missing at the roll-call.

After justice had been fully done to Caterer Dobermann's atnple provision, several toasts fitting to the occasion were announced by 'foasttnaster Clinton Jones. The feast broke up at an early hour.

The Rev. Dr. F. V. Van Vranken, '58, opened tlre meet- ing \vith prayer. The tnarked feature of the tneeting was the presentaion to'~tl1e College by the Class of 'So of a bronze tablet in honor o . the late Robert C. Alexaader;- a member of} that class. Matters of m·uch interest were liberally discussed. Letters· of regret from Elisha Taylor, '3 7, L. G. Parker, '38, and John D. Mills '38, were read. A tnotion that they be spread on .M1e minutes and that the secretary send fraternal • greetings to them \Vas unanimously carried. The following motion, after much discussion, was finally carried: Resolved, that the General . Alumni Associ- ation respectfully represents to the Board of Trustees of Union College that the Alumni \vould be greatly pleased by a restoration of the salaries of the 1v1embers of the Faculty to the rate formerly prevailing, as soon as such action can consistently be taken, and that they look to tl1e 'trustees with con.fidence to move in this lnatter at the earliest possible moment. Resolver!, that the Association appeals to its members to co-operate vvith the Trustees in their earnest efforts to advance the varied in- terests of the College by co11tributing to its general funds as generously as their ability will permit. Resolved, that the Secretary transmit a copy of these resolutions to the Board of Trustees. A con11nittee consisting of the President, E. P. White, '79, and A. L. :Bennett, '8o, was appointed to put the resolution into effect. Lee W. Eeattie, '79, offered to restore for t\.vo years one $r 7 so salary to $2ooo and was ac- cepted. The last alun1ni tnen1orial paper was pub- lished in the sutnmer of '97. It l1as been felt that this annual document should be contin- ued. ;rhe association voiced the co1nn1on sentiment by appointing Professors Truax and Latuoroux a committee to carry out the design. The entire meeting was saddened by the terrible misfortune which had the evening be- ,

fore attended Dr.. Fred T. Rogers, '8o, and it \vas felt that resolutions of sytnpathy would at least express the affection in -...v hi ell Dr. Rogers is held by n1any Union n1en. They. follow: .. Resolved, that the Alumni of Union College extend their heartfelt syn1pathy to their brother alutnnus, Fred T. Izogers of the Class of 'So, in the startling bereavement that has befallen' him in tl~e tragic death of l1is beloved wife. while attttnding the exercises of this con1- : mencemen t and the re· union of his class and · that they tender to him the support of their affection and enco.uragetnent in this hour of bitter trial. Resolved, that the secretary transn1it to him a copy of these resolutions. The election of .officers for the coming year resulted in the election of Neil Gihnour, '6o, · as president; Willian1 H.

At a meeting of tl1e class of I 88o held Tues- day evening, June .26, the following resolutions were adopted in n1etnory of two tnembers of the class who have died during the year, Rob- . ert C. Alexander and E. ~:riles Gadsden. At our twentieth anniversary meeting the class of r 88o recalls \Vith sadness the great loss that \Ve have suffered during the past year in the death of Robert C. Alexander. In his passing all our college is bereaved, and ·wider circles still have n1ourned the man of strength and wisdom, but he \vas peculiarly our ovvn. As we 1neet together again, our thoughts turn to days gone by intnemories of student life, of his manifold activities on behalf of the college and the class, of former reunions and of de- 13 lightful days spent with .l-\lexahder at Lake George, and the 111e111ories are· alt of the same true friend, devoloping from boyhood tomah::. hood the qualities of a great life, vigorous in lJteUect, strong and pure in character, earnest in purpose and great in achieven1ent, and a- bove aU, giving to his friends the unbounded riches of unselfish affection, which was return- ed to hin1 in uuparalled n1easure. · We can never tell ho\'v much our class o\ves to hh:n, nor properly express· the loving pride \'Vi th ,;vhich ·we cherish his n1en1ory. To Mrs. Alexander, \V hom so many of us have 1\:no\'vn as t.,he friend of her husband's friends, and to Dr. Alexander, our teacher of other days, we express our heartfelt sympathy. As the class of I 88o meets at Union College to celebrate the twentieth ·ant1iversary of our graduation, the pleasure .of r~uniou is n1ingled \Vi th sadness because of the absence of some , \vhon1 at our last meeting we confidently ex- pected to tneet again at this tin1e, and who vvill never meet \vith us again. . · .. One ot these is E. !viiles Gadsden, who has passed away during the year. The formal re- cord which \Ve make here is but a poor ex- pression of the sorro\v \Vhich each one of us felt in learning of his death. Gadsden \Von our respect and affection in student days, and tl1e years that have passed since then have on- ly added to our appreciation of his fine and true spirit, his sincere and upright life. To J\frs. Gadsden we tender this expression of our deep and sincere sympathy, and the as- surance that \'Ve too shall ever cherish the memory of our departed classn1ate. ~rhe cl~ss of '8o had tnore members pressent on alumn1 day than any other class. This was mainly due to the zeal and energy of Dr. F. T. Rogers, who has been class president for the decade since r8go. The class passed a hearty vote of thanks to Dr. Rogers in recognition of his 1nany services to the class during the ten years, and also a resolution in expression of their sympathy \Vith hint in the terrible affic- tion \i\rhich has so suddenly befallen him. The class of 'So elected Robert J. Landon, Esq., of Schenectady, president for the ensu .. ing J?eriod of ten years.
