TO PERF'EC'f THE HEATING APPARATUS At a meeting of the budget Con1mittee of the Trustees held in New York City on Fri- day, February z6, plans for perfecting the heating app 1iances of the college recitation roon1s and laboratories were presented and approved. Assistant Treasurer Pond brought the mat- ter up and urged the necessity of such a ~tep. It was decided to begin work at once. l'he recitafion rooms in North Colona de and the Physical and Chetni cal laboratories are to be heated from the boiler-furnace in the Red Building. 'I'he heatin·g arrangernc11ts of the Red building, itself, are to be thoroughly overhauled and ren1odelcd. The classrooms in South Colonacle are to be heated from the furnace under South College. Such a system will, in a way, cnlrninate the recent marked improvements on the grounds and thanks are due Mr. Pond and the Trustees for their time• ly efforts in supporting the n1atter.

As the fore.most metaphysical au- thority of his age he has taken sides with the ancient philosophical theories of the nineteenth century and has held to his ideas with a tenac- ity which is laudable if indeed, a trifle, self- assertive. T'o him, there is no question but that the earth, together with every planet on which the sun shines wiH, sooner or later, be- come a tnere frozen mass of 1natter, ploughing through unknown space and surrounded by a mighty darkness. There is, he predicted, a chance of approach to alcyon, in which case the solar planets might again become inhabita- ble. True that men are able to prolong the life principle indefinitely since the .discovery of the properties of the element Viriu1n, yet it had been found that, after all, men do not care to live much longer than did their semi-barbarous ancestors in untold ages in the past. And even the wonderful Viriun1 has its life-giving limitations. By its power men can survive the natural shocks which ordinarily cause death, but it can not make the body withstand a nerve-destroying dissolution. Professor Brocton has discovered in the ruins of the ancient city of New Orleans a treatise which deals in part with the limits of the uni- verse. It is called \Eureka\ and its author bore the name of o_ne Edgar Poe. How strange it is to think of the ancients having thought on such subjects! He read the aged MS with great interest, :finding it printed on a substance .called \paper much akin to the papyrus of. the Egyptians whose civilization reached its climax even before the Western '\Vorkl was _discove~ed. The somewhat .erudite arguments of this old poet-philosopher proved enlighten- ins to a certain extent to the great metaphy- THE CONOORDIEN8IS. 'i sician, Alton Brocton. He also found some passages amusing. But to proceed.· It has been discovered ages before our clay that the central luminous mass contracted every year yet none but he haf:l discerned that this contraction increased as the bulk of the sun diminished. What is n1ore, men beHeve his theory. They hold his word almost as a criterion of truth for he is a genius of the :first dimension. Was it not he, this same AHon :Brocton, who had discovered the terrible con1- et which bore his natne. The cotnet which thirty years before thundered so close the earth that its very foundations were shaken and so near that the co1net's dust hung like a glowing pall in the upper atmosphere for months ? The san1e comet which after a revo- lution around the sun came in contact with the planet J\1ercury, and with a shock that made the universe tremble, they had sunk together in a glorious but awful burning n1ass into the oblivion of in1measurable space ? The contraction of the sun has increased at a startling rate and greatest effect is the ren- dering the two forn1erly tenned temperate zones uninhabitable. The popu 1a tion of the earth has not increased, as was prophesied by the ancients for perfected 1norali ty had put a prohibitive check upon the race so that no family ever has n1ore than two children. True that the belt of the equator is densely popu- lated; in fact it forn1s the site of a world city, yet the people are comfortable enough. Wars and rumors of wars have ceased since the union of the races of mankind. Aerial trans- portation has become so cotnmon as never to be ren1arked upon as out of the ordinary but the idea of planetary settlements has long been abandoned as impossible. The creatures living in Mars are not in sympathy or mental accord with human beings as has been attested by electrical communication. T'he earth is inexorably bounded by the limits of its attnos· ph ere. It was during the rainy season of this year, 4901, that strange phenomena with regard to

Count de. Wigne was frequently seen there Professor Erocton, in a recent lecture ad· vised drastic measures for the preservation of life. He even went so far as to say :that should the sun contract its customary atnount this year, the heat generated would prove insufficient for the preservation of human life and the earth would certainly freeze to death. Few doubted his words, and they caused a panic among the weak minded. i; and we all knew and liked him. l-Ie was sup- ;posed to be wealthy, and after I had been ·in ;practice a few years in New York I was much surprised to find the Count accept~ng a modest ·c1erical position in Brooklyn. I knew him ·quite intimately fron1 the time he came to Brooklyn till his death. He was highly edu- ·cated, weH bred, and a man of tireless activi- ty. He was an enthusiastic Republican and was at all tin1es straight and reliable. He never bolted a ticket or forsook a friend. 'There we·re times when the tide was against him and he was very poor, but there never \Vas an hour in his life when his warm hearted geniality failed him, and at all times to all persons he was a gentleman. He had the manners of a Chesterfield. To some of us -who had known him in his better days in Sche- nectady, he was at times confidential and he 1·evealed to us traits of which his average ac- quaintance knew nothing. There are hun- dreds of the sons of old Union still living to whom the name of Count de Wigne awakens very pleasant memories.

I notice in last issue of your paper a reference to the late Count de Wigne. Many of the alumni of earlier years re- member him well. He was in r 86o and prior thereto, engaged in brewing lager beer at Schenectady. I am unable to state whether he owned a brewery but most of us supposed he did. His beer was retailed at a little :frame building on Union street near the rairroad, and it was a very popular resort for students. 1\'he place was well filled by students every evening, in fact, comparatively few peo:ple came there e\-euings, except students.

Several years ago I was on a prospecting tour in Colorado. I had been tramping all day, digging up a pan of dirt now and then, until just at evening, when I happened to come across a rude cabin. As I approached the door I was hailed by an old miner and asked my business. I said I vvas a miner look- ing around .to se_e what I could find. I was invited inside and introduced to the occupants -two in number-one a venerable chap called Sioux, from the fact of his having lived with that tribe of Indians ; the other was the ugli- est piece of hun1anity I ever saw. He said his natne was Si1n. After the usual questions had been asked, Siln proceeded to get supper which in due time was served and heartily en: joyed. At the close of the meal I began to ask for information in regard to the country when Sioux remarked : ' \ I reckon yer a stranger in these here parts and don't suppose you ever hearn of the warm springs down by the Hogback ? \ I said that I had not. \Them springs,\ he continued, \will pet- rify anything that gets in to thetn. \Vhy sir ' ' there was a fellow come out here from New York and was hunting around them 'ere springs. vVell, he got tired and sot down to wash his feet, and when he took them out they was solid stone.\ I made the remark that it must be a very peculiar spring. '' Yes '' s· '' . ' h , says an, ~t s t e go 1-darnest spring in the world, I reckon. 1'here is a tree close to that spring, it's about five feet through an.d tnaybe a hundred feet high. It's about forty feet to the first limb, and the whole thing is solid stone, even the leaves are petrified. On the first litnb there is a bird's nest, with two eggs in it petrified solid. On the second lin1b sits the old bird, and she is petrified, and stranger, she is singing a petri- fied song. ''-N. Y. Weekly. •

Mrs. Mar- garet L. Peissner. In the death of Mrs. J\1argaret L. Peiss- ner which occurred on Sunday, February the twenty-eighth, the college has lost a long, faithful and highly-esteemed friend. A daughter of Tayler Lewis, who was Professor of Ancient Languages, and the widow of Elias Peissner·, a former Professor of Modern Languages, her whole life was i:ntiimately connected with Union 'vvhich she ].{new only to love and whose interests were ever near and dear to her. To every one of Union's sons :she was a sin:cere friend and to the college itgelf even more than a friend. The sympathy of the Faculty, Alumni ancl Students is extended to the family in their bereavement. The Other That a man who is i!Q, his fourth year '\!-....... . . at college ought to have just a few more Side. privileges and a Httle more attention than those who have been students for a less time will hardly be denied by even the greenest and freshest :fresh· man. It's a small privilege to speak in chapel when you come to think about it 1 Why, ''some Seniors don't thinK enough about it to come around on Mo11day morning. But it's a mark of distinction just the same which three years of college life justifies-a mark, trivial though it may~ be, which' constantly reminds the 'underclassman that there's something else in the Senior year besides a new seat in chapel. It was asked in the editoria 1, ''Speak· ing in Chapel,'' if it was fair. Why nnfair? Every Senior has been a Sophomore at one time in his course. He has known what it is to sit and l1ear '' the old reliable Senior babblers'' and he probably secretly longed to be one himself. An underclassman has plenty of opp{)rtuni- ties for'. presenting his ideas and showiag his spirit. Few Colleges grantlitas little class distinction on the campus and in the classroom as Union. It is per- haps necessary for the welfare of ~:a small College. Eut in chapel meeting, at least, the Senior is entitled to a respect and recognition which a Sophomore or a Fresh- man does not deserve. Q. E. D. 'os. TheY. M. C. A. \ The officers of the Y. M. C. A. have had printed very neat little notices of the Vesper and Tuesday night services. The speakers for these occasions have been well chosen and a certain benefit is to be derived from attendance on them. It is, moreover, the duty of students to attend., especially the Vesper Services, Sunday afternoon for when a minister gives up the leisure of, practically, his busiest day it is only right that the student body should

While the C'oncordieasfs approves highly of the steps taken by the V. M. C. A. to awaken more interest in its work, we believe, however, that a m'ilder form of an- nouncing the meetings rnight be used with equal effect. The posters ,rece·atly seen . on the bulletin board· and be· fore the Ass()ciation's building are just a little incongruou~ and somewhat spectacular. Baseball Captain. vVe regret that. no earlier mention has been made of the election of John A. Mahar, 'o4, captain of the 'varsity base- ball team. It is not too late, however, to say that the election meets the hearty ·approval of· the entire student body. Mahar has played in practically every game the last three years and is well fitted to fill the captaincy. The responsibility and honor conferred on him are in keeping with his ability. He should have the co-operation of every student. A NEW SONG ·TO OLD UNION. T.une, chorus of '' Cocoanut tree.'' Where ·is't we spend our happiest days? At Union, old Union.

The annual snowbal'l scrap between the two underdasses came as a disappoint,ment to all on Thursday n1orning last. 1'o the sopho- mores and freshmen because therie are so few good mornings for this purpose and one or two had already escaped, and to the upper classmen as a dissapointment because the two classes seemed so friendly that they hated to. hurt one another. But nevertheless there were some good points to it. The snowballing por- tion of it was good, the liveliest while it lasted in several years, as will ·be testified by the soph- otnores and the two freshn1en who strayed into chapel and followed the sophomores out too closely. For a while the air was full of snow and the snow was full of hu1nan forn1s rolling, pulling, twisting in the style of warfare of prehistoric man. Then came the cry of \ 0 ver the Ter- race.'' On the terrace the scrap went fast and fu- rious for about five tninutes. ~-Jeither side be- ing able to put a n1ajority of the other oYer or keep those who had been thrown over there, the scrap was pretty near being called a draw but at this point the Freshman President (?) collapsed and had to be taken from the field, giving the sophomores a decided advantage. After this there was a gooc.l deal of parading and breaking up of parades which drew the time out to the required thirty minutes. In the absence of the senior president, the football captain called the scrap off. After time was called the contestants limped homeward to perforrn the service of abolution. It is said that they also were massaged and son1e even go so far as to say that liberal li- bations were imbibed. But there the curtain falls. THE BATTLE OF SAL.AMIS. 1,he last rays of the setting sun had already Hfted from the blue waters of the Saronic Gulf, and were slowly retreating up the bee-haunt- ed forests of l\1oun t I-Iymettus when a Greek messenger arrived hastily at J>haluum and made his way to the Persian fleet which lay swinging lazily at anchor near the port. Soon a sharp con1mand rang fron1 ship to ship, and when night had fallen there was commotion in every ship. l'he capstans creak as they strain at the anchors, . and, propelled by rythmic strokes, each ship takes its place in one of the three divisions of the mighty fleet. Under cover of the darkness they move off, and in one vast line hem in the G!·ecian fleet which lay at anchor off the island of Salamis. Mov- ing stealthily to and fro lest the Greeks es- cape, they await the coming day. Dawn breaks in the east and is ushered in by the blare of trumpets fro111 the Grecian fleet. The rocky isle gives back the echo, and every Grecian heart is thriHed and fired by the :r;uartial strain. In good array the ships dart forth to meet the foe. The sea is lashed into foam by the churning oars, and as the ships speed on their course, a cry arises. fron1 ten thousand throats : '' 0 sons of Greeks go, set your country free, Free your wives, free your children, free the fanes Of the Gods your fathers founded-sepul~ chers They sleep in ! or save all or all be lost.'' An· echoing cry fron1 the barbaric ships rolled over the vvaters. The Persian fleet stsod tnotion1ess awaiting the onset. The bronze prows clash and grate together or bury themselves in the sides of the enemy's ships. Above the crash and· splintering of

THE CONCORDIENSIS. timbers is :beard the:·sharp command, the:br~z­ en. chrng of trumpet'S, the hoarse cries: 6f vic.;. tor and vatt qui shed, and the shrieks of the wounded and dying. Many ships are. over- turned by t[l e violent shocks and :float helpless- ly about trai:ting their tangled oars. So great is the ·destr1.:1'ction that the sea is c-overed with wrekage bearing its human, dying freight. At fkst the Persian fleet stands :firm through force of nUOIDers, but soon their foremost ranks atteD:pt to turn in flight, and like a mighty herCI of cattle struggling through a narrow pass tb.ey strike and crush one another as they stri-ve to pass through the narrow strait which ~.epaxates the isle of Salamis from the. Grecian CO[I.St. . All day long beneath the s.corching st1:rt. the battle raged, and as the fisherman sooi tes the tunny captured in his net so the Greeks struck the Persians en- ' tangled in t!Ie wreckage. At last night settles over the scene of car- nage, conc~aling the dire ruin. The shrieks an.d moans of the wounded and dying grow fainter and fainter, for their life's blood flows away. Silently .they release their hold of the broken spars and oars and sink into the depths of the ocea.tL All night long the heaving ocean bears the dead along upon its blood- stained bosQ)tn, rolls them upon the sandy beach or d.ash es them in savage glee against the rocky C()ast. Such is the curse of human passiQn, su<:b the curse of war. So fared the dead, for ccnCJ.uered and conquerors had sailed away, the Persians in wretched flight, and the Greeks to spr~ad the glad news of their de- liverance fr-oEn the barbaric host and to tell the stirring tale of the battle of Salamis. L.-S. North western University is about to estab- li-sh an Am et\ican Institute of Germanics as a part of its College of Liberal Arts. The idea is to develop interest in this country in Ger· man scholars bip. A special building will be entirely dev-oi,ed to this department. MEllTING OF BlBL,E STUDY IN- S,TITUTE. Representatives from Union,. Colgate, R. P. I., Hamilton, Cornel-l,. Syraeus'e, and. Caseno- via Seminnry, met in the Bible Institute, held · on February 27th and 28th, at the~-Syracuse University gymnasium, to discuss Blble Study ; among students.· At the first session, led by Clayton Cooper, of New York City, short. pa- pers were read on Bible Study and Evangeh~m, · The Importance and Benefit of Personal B1ble · Study, The Morning Watch, Bible Study and Theological Unrest, and The Reai Aim of · Bible Study. In the discussion following, Mr. Cooper dwelt especially on the average college man's ignorance of the Bibl·e, and stated that last year sixteen thousand students were en- rolled in Bible classes. He told of the great increase in Bible study ·at Vale, Princeton, West Point, Harvard, and especially Michigan, where the captains of football, baseball and track teams all lead Bible classes. The insti- tute declared itself in favor .of the following points: personal, practical, daily, systematic and scholarly Bible study. Dr. Ismar J. Peritz, of Syracuse, addressed the institute on Saturday evening. His sub- ject was: The Aim of the Leader. 1\'h!s aitn he gave as \The aiding and encouragtng of the students to daily systematic study in order to reflect Christ in their Ii ves.\ He called this the Christo-centric age. Some believe in the Church as the real authority ; some Reason ; so111-e the Bible ; but the tendency is growing towards the taking of Christ himself as the true basis. In speaking of the h~rd arid knotty problems met with in Bible study, Dr. Peritz en1phasized the necessity of getting really into the spirit of Christ, saying that in just so far as anything in the old or new l'esta· ments fails to coincide with this spirit, we need not accept it. The institute closed with a Bible study rally on Sunday afternoon.

GLOBE HOTEL, ALBANY.-Adv. THE OON'00RDIENSIS. 7 SOM.E OLD EPITAPHS What a feeling of deep reverence must be awakened as one finds ones self surrounded by the tombs of t.he n1ighty dead-the great men of past ages-as, for instance, in the Poets' Corner of Westminister Abbey. vVith what interest one notes the inscriptions on the heroes; Mantua gave me life. Brundusium death, Naples a grave.'' In his ,., Sepulchral Monuments,'' Goltgh gives the following curious and early specimens of inscriptions.. It is dated 1420 in · · St. Peter's church at St. A!lbans : ~ monuments and yet, strange to say, even here we find that vY ith the exception of Shakespeare and Addison, scarcely any of the memorials of the founders of our native literature exceed the simple records of their names and age. Yet such n1e1nentos in their simplicity appeal more eloquently to the heart than any other, and truly awaken the· sympathy between the living and the dead. Much has been, and more tnight be, written about the to1nbs clustered so thickly within the vaulted aisles of Westminister Abbey, and beneath the vast dotne of the great Metro- politan Cathedral of London. No one of them is perhaps more interesting than the monument to the n1emory of Spencer, which, having fallea, was restored in 1768 with its inscription i11 exactly its old form : \ He are lyes (expecting the second cominge of our Saviour Christ Jesus) the body of Edmond Spencer, The Prince of Poets in his tyme, Whose devine spirit needs noe Other witness than the works Which he left behind him. He was borne in London, in the yeare 1553, And died in year I 598.\ A man rarely writes his own epitpaph, but that of the o:ld classic poet, Virgil, is said to have been written by himself, and is as fol- lows : \ JVIantua me gen uit : Calabri rapurere ; tenet nunc. Parthenope ; cecini, pascua, rura, duces.'' For its brevity, this epitaph may be regard- ed as a fair specimen of the Grecian standard of excellence in this species of writing. It may be tra~slated : '·'I sang fl<;>cks, tillage, ~ -1 • \ In ye yere of Christ on thousand and fo u hundryd fuH trew with four and sixtene I, Richard Skipwiths, gentlyman in birthe, late fellow of New !nne, In tny age twenti ; on my soui partyed from the bodee in August an r 6th day, And now I ly her abyding God's n1ercy under. · this stone in clay,. Desyring you that this sal see unto the meyden pray for me, Like as you would that others for ye shold. '' Prior and itntnediatly subsequent to the Reforn1ation many of the epitaphs, in attempts . at the facetious, are worse than contemptible ; for instance, the following : ''Here lies one More, and no more than he, One More, and no More ! how can that be ?

The number of students that make use of the periodicals and rare books of interest is comparatively. few.

It will tend to keep the Association moTte in touch with the college at large and with the student body. The Reading Room is supplied with papers and :1~ower to make Men1orial Hall useful in the highest sense of the term and now that it is in first class shape why not ' take advantage of the opportunities that it presents? Subscriptions The management of the Concordy -wishes to urge all those who have out- standing subscriptions to make an effort to pay soon as possible. Nineteen issues out of the twenty-eight to ap· pear have been published and yet only a regrettably small :fraction of the student body has paid their indebtedness. ; It is hardly fair to elude a payment of this kind. The Editors try to give satisfaction and it is only just that subscribers should meet their obligation. Someone has ! expressed the situation truthfully, if tersely, as follows; \ The wind bloweth, The water floweth, The time goetl1, And the Lord knoweth, The Subscriber oweth. ' 1

OUR GRO·WTI-I AND THE LIBRARY To the Editor of The Concordy: Does it not seem a necessity, in view of increasing importance of our engineering de- partments, that the College library should be bett~r supplied with engineering books of re- ference and magazines ? We are growing in importance, we are getting the best of class- room instruction,. our laboratories are being improved and n1odernized, and our library should keep pace with these. It is a source of qni·et satisfaction to us all that the library in its 11ew quarters is more popular than formerly. Students are to be seen there often, reading for instruction and for pleasure; but we feel that the library would have a greater usefulness to us if it were bet- ter equipped with contemporary scientific lite- rature. Many books of reference are needed, and periodicals like the Scientific American and the Engineering News are indispensable to the library of any engineering school. \ ENGINEER.\ (?) ALUMNI.

An interesting figure passed away a few days ago at Oshkosh, Wis., in the person of Col. Gabe Bouck. He was of a type nearly extinct. If he had lived in the South hi·s man- net: and peculiar ideas would have made hitn a foremost figure. He had the physique of an Indian model and the dignity of a whole bench of the judiciary. He was descended from early settlers in New York State. 1'he Bouck estate consists of about five hundred acres in Schoharie county. Col. Bouck's brother Charles lives upon the property still. Apropos of the Lenten season the followiug story is recalled of Col. Bouck: He was trying an important case in the Ci,r- cuit Court at Milwaukee. 1,he Jtldge was. not· ed for his arbitrary :rulings. Growing weary. .of the case, he broke in upon Col. Bouck by ordering an adjournment. \Until what day?'' inquired the Colonel, not in the least perturbed by the abru·ptness of the Court. \ Make it next Friday.\ replied the Judge, addressing the remark to the clerk. Col. Bouck was always a strict churchn1an an<l had the Church calendar days at his fin· gers' ends . \Next Friday is Good Friday,\ said Col. Brouck in a voice that was heard throughout the court rootn. '' That makes no difference to this Court,' said the Judge. '' We shall hear the case on that day.\ . \ If you do,\ quickly retorted Col. Bouck in a solemn and measured tone, \you will break a record that has stood during the Christian era. Pontius Pilate is the only other Judge who held court on Good Friday.'' It is recalled that the Judge wilted, and although he did not order the change from the bench the record was changed before court adjourned. Col. Bouck was. as interesting in the camp as he was at the bar and in society. He \!vas in comn1and of the Eighteenth Wisconsin In- fantry during the Civil war. One day a mem- ber of his staff announced that a certain New Jersey regiment was putting on airs over the Wisconsin boys. '·What for ? ,,,. asked Col. Bouck.

I am not going to have any blank New Jersey regiment get ahead of the Eighteenth Wiscon- In 1848 he .married Lucy Ann Allen, a daughter of Orlando Allen, one of Buffalo's well-known earHer Mayors. In 185 5 he was married a second time to Louise Ann Pratt; daughter of Hiram. Pratt. From [862 to 1866 he was a roen1ber of the Board of Aldermen. In r866 he was appointed Collector of Internal Revenue under President Johnson. sin.\ Mr. Hopkins served two terms. in the office of State Comptroller. In later years he was a \#\\'42--Ndson K. Hopkins, the dean of the bar of Erie County, both in age and in length of practice, died at Buffalo on \Vednesday, March 2. He was 88 years old, dying upon his birthday. Ivir. Hopkins was born on his father's farm at Willia.msvill~ in 1816. His father was Gen. Timothy S. Hopkins, who was appointed a captain by Gov. George Clinton fire co1nn1issioner. Mr. Hopkins is survived by Mrs. Edmund in r8o3, a n1aj or by Gov. Lewis in 1 8o6, a lieutenant colonel by Gov. Tompkins in r8r x, and served as a brigadier general under Gen. Hall during the War of 1812, but resigned his com·mission when peace was declared. 1\'he son, Nelson IZ. Hopkins, began his ac- tive career with active service. Young Hop- kins was placed in charge of a gang of 400 men, building the vVilliamsville Road, when he was only I 7 years old. By doing this thor- oughly he demonstrated to his father that he was worth educating, and he was sent to school at Fredonia for two terms. He organized a company of militia from the roadbuilders dur- ing vacation, and then wt>nt to the Genesee Wesleyan Institute at Lima. While there the Patriot vVar broke out. Capt. Hopkins hurried back from the insti- tute and with his cornpany \vas sworn into the United States service, being stationed at the foot of Ferry street to resist a threatened in .. vasion of the Canadians in revenge for An1eri- ican assistance to the rebels. After the war, he cont~inued his studies, completing his co1le- giate course at Union College, Schenectady. In r846 he was admitted to the Erie county bar, being then a clerk in the office of Potter & Spaulding. For years he was a well-known lawyer here~ T.

The annual dinner of the Union University Alumni Association of Northeastern New York, was helcl at the Hotel IZenn1ore, Albany, Thursday evening. The banquet ·was attend- ed by many alun1ni anc1 \vas notable for the prominent n1en who responded to toasts. Toastmaster F. \V. Can1eron, '8r, intro- duced as the first speaker to follow hin1self, Presiden. t Andrew V. V. Rayn1.oncl, and he responded in an earnest and thoughtful speech to the toast of \Old Union.'' Dr. Raymond spoke in part as follows : 1?residen t and Fell ow-A lurn ni I atn not a little perplcxe(1 to know \'I hat to say to you. I\iost of you Eve near, and are already so fatniliar \vith' \vhat \Ve have done and are trying to do in Sche~1ectac.ly, that any- thing in. the nature of a report woulcl prove flat, sta.le, an(l unprofitable. You know a11 about our improved financial condition, and if you do not, you have only to write for a copy of the treasurer's report. \'\ ou know all about the recent develuprnent of our engineering work, and if you do not, you have only to write for a catalogue, or li~..;t.en to Pruf. Stein- metz, ·who will speak to-ni~ht. Yon know all abo1.1t the renovation of N ur~b and South Colleges. If you do not, yon have bn t to visit them. \Where you ·used to s \Vel ter and freeze alternately in the co1npanionship of the good old box stove, the student now luxuriates in the equable tetnperature created by a steam radiator. Instead of spending tilne, as you did, in borrowing wood fron1 the college pile, or raiding the sections for coal, he spends time, of course, in borrowing ideas and feed~ ing the fires of his brain. Instead of breaking the ice in the pitcher or going clown in undress unifonn to the pump for water with the ther- tnorneter at zero, your successor steps out of his sleeping-room into a bath-room, and turns on the shower, getting it hot or cold, as he likes it. \ For the midnight oil which you said yo.u burned, he basks in the brightness of electric light. ~rhe old carpets laid one upon another, filled with dust and microbes, have given place to hardwood floors. Even the paper on the wall, which you inherited from your fath- er's time, is gone, and tinted plaster now rests the eyes wearied with study. The change is complete, but the q nestion will be raised whether or not the new environtnent wi'll pro- duce such a type of seasoned n1anhood as you represent. \Ve shall let that pass, as the dis- cussion might le2.d us far astray. ''As you know about the renovation of the dormitories, sD you know about the completion of the central building, and the final answer to the question. ' Of what use is it ?' Enter it today, and you vvill see how achnirably it has been adapted to the uses of a library and the lib:ary itself will reward inspection. \ It is steadily growing, and it is now my privilege to announce for the first time as the latest in1portant addition, the entire library of 'I'ayler Lewis, containing tnany rare and most valuable books. This has con1e through the generosity of his son, Charles F. Lewis, and of his daughter, the late Mrs. 1\fargaret Lewis Peissner. '' I cannot mention Mrs. Peissner' s natne without pausing a n1oment. She was known

6 THE CONOORDIENSIS. . to you all. For twenty years she was con- nected with the college officially as registrar, but her whole life was devoted to the interests of Union College, and she is ren1en1bered toM day gratefully and affectionately by Union men all over the world. She inherited her spirit of loyalty, and gloried in ali our wortlli- .. est traditions.. Her death, but a little more than a week ago, has severecl one more of the ·links binding us to the past. We can nev·er be unn1indful of this past, and the temptation is strong to dwell upon it whenever we come together as we do to-night. ''I-I ow wide-spread and far-reaching has been the work of Union College appears in much that is passing in the world today. In some way the college has touched all lands and peoples. vVf? hear much just now of the historic relations of friendliness between l{.ussia and America, relations which, apart from all other considerations, would bind our count,ry to neutrality in the present struggle' despite the evident sympathy of our people for Russia's antagonist. '' It is for us, the 1nen of Union, to rememM ber that the frien(1ship of Russia, with all that it meant in our national crisis, was fostered and strengthened, if not originally secured, by the \visdom and astuteness of vVilliatn I-I. Sew- ard, through whom also A1nerica gait\1ed from Russia her present Alaskan possessions. ''.But more significant still is the part which Union College has played in the development of the nation which is today matching her strength with Russia. The world wonders at the revelation which Japan is n1aking-a na- tion which fifty years ago was unknown, and w.hich, when opened to the world, \vas thought to lack all the essentials of n1odern greatness. 'l'here must be a reason for the progress which she has n1ade, for the n1arvelous ability which she has displayed in the arts both of peace and war. •' Back of it all was an intellectual n1ovement led at the very beginning by a famous philosopher, Tuku Zama, who has been called the Fichte of Japan. President Andrews, fonnerly of Brown University, speaking at our Centennial, said that that great man in the darkest time his native land ever saw, gathered about hi:n1., Just as Fichte did, young men who had hope and power, and taught them of their possi hilities and the possibilities of the land in which they lived ! and the text book which he was wont to use from which he brought tnoral inspiration, fire and ambition to these young n1en was ·'The Elements of Moral Science,' by :Fran cis Wayland, a graduate of Union College. '' But this is not all. When some one said to the famous Frenchman Renan that it was the Gern1an needle-gun that cost France the victory in the Franco-Prussian war, he replied, ' No, it was not the German needle.gun, nor the German soldier that held the needle-gun, nor was it the German schoolmaster that n1ade the German soldier, but it was the Gern1an University that made the German school- master.' So, back of all the success of Japan, back of all of the wonderful progress of these recent years has been the eel uca tional system of Japan, with the Imperfal University at its head ; and for that con1prehensive system J a- pan owes a lasting debt of gratitude to two sons of Union College,-David ~1urray who organ izcd it, and Dr. V er bee]{, t be missionary and scholar who for a long period helped to direct its policies. '' These are son1e of the facts \\? hich help us to appreciate the wide range and the benefi- cence of the influence which our Alma Mater exerted in the world, and a college that has wrought thus pervasively and enduringly need never apologize for her existence. In an age that puts great emphasis upon wealth and the material creations of wealth, upon n un1erical strength and its in1pressive appeal to the youthful il11agination, let us stand and con· tinue to stand undisn1ayed for the personal influence that develops the rea;l power that is back of all great achievement ; the power not always recognized and not always praised, but : .. ~ .I -- ( wit the act enc de~ ·tht: pe'J rde1 do rig wa ktl ·de· Fit Gc: Ba R< D< El A tl\ P1 cc Pt WI .f.G .. ta tr :h~ tr Ct at b: lc Ci aJ . r( ···~11 \''~~¥•

She :h~s to walt ev~ery year until the kindly rays of \ the summer sun bas penetrated the walls and creTices of the building back of South College and diffused heat and light enough to allow baseball candidates to toss a ball back and lort:b without becoming frost bitten.

'' Jack\ Mahar issued his first call for candidates :Monday, IV[arch 7th, and over twen- ty men responded. 'fhe fresman class seems fertile in good m·aterial for nearly every posi- tion. Four players have already reported for practice wh i.ch strengthens the squad consider- ably.· E. aston and O'Brien played catcher aJ?:d thir,d base respectively last season, and Odwell and Devoe held down first and second base in the season of 1902. It goes witho,ut saying that there is going to be a vacancy in left field hard to fill. That mound will be a particular cause for worry until after the first two or three games, but if present indications count for anything there will be someone there on wliom the rest of the team and the side lines can depend. It is hard to say now just what post ttons are vacant. Practically every posi- tion is open for competition and Capt. Mahar is giving every man a chance. The coaching will again be of the best. Ben Ellis, captain of the Schenectady State League team will train and bring up the candidates in the way they should go until at least the middle of the season. He has begun his work, assist- ed by Dr. Towne ·whose aid i.s about as neces- sary to form our tea.m as a base ball is in a game. To use an oft quoted statement with mote truth than is sotnetirues attached to it, the prospect.:; of a good team this year are de:cid- ly bright. The schedule has already heen publis-hed and a)though hard, it is- satitsfactory. Some more games are yet to be added to it. The following men form the squad at present : Capt.

On Saturday evening, March 12, the faculty tendered a reception to the undergraduate body in Sillirnon Hall. The affair was one of tnarked success, bringing many students to- gether and aside from the temporary enjoy .. ment of the occasion naturally is strengthen- ing the general college spirit, which is in need of such stimuli. After the customary greetings, everyone withdrew to the upper roon1s where Prof. Op- dyke related some of his experiences while ' abroad. He first spoke of the fact that looking at the Gern1an cities superficially, they are not very different from our own. The larger ones like ·Berlin are very n1uch like our metropolises, except that the buildings are lower, the streets more beautiful and uniforn1, while the danger- ous swinging and overhead wires are not in evidence. However, when one settles down in a city and views the life aud other countries in this new perspective, one's impress ions change. continues until eight o'clock at night. The cafes. then open up and everybody enjpys·· a cup of \ schwartzer kaffee '' or sonlething else that might appeal more forcibly. The work at the University began at eig~t o'clock in winter and seven in summer. The ·University life was particularly interesting be· cause of the different nationalities represented among which were Germans, French, Italians, Poles, Russians, Spaniards, English and Americans. Lectures are the chief means of imparting instruction. For this reason the ;Germans have a ren1arkable facility for taking down notes and copying formulae in a short time. In laboratory work, the ciasses are di- vided into sections whlch make a tour of a building. Assistant professors give the in· struction, using text books but simply refer- ring to previous lectures. The laboratory periods are long because the desire is to ob- tain accurate results. Afte:r graduation it is ex.tremely difficult to obtain employment as most of the professional positions are occupied by more experienced men. It is for this rea- son that so many young educated foreigners are found in this country. Prof. Opdyke went first to Berlin but found that he did not know enough of the German language. He therefore went to live with a German friend and his family in a little town on the Elbe. This being an historical spot, he and his friend used to take long walks in the afternoon among the ruins of many old castles. In the evening they would converse about the legends in which those places rev- elled and in this way, he obtained considerable knowledge of the language.

CONFERENCE OF COLL·EGE MEN. March 2 5-27 there will be held at Union Seminary, New York City, a conference to consider the opportunities and work of the ministry. Last year a similar gathering of men from the colleges and universities of the ·East proved so helpful that a second confer- ence has seemed advisable. As was the case last year, the purpose is .distinctly not to ex- ploit any religious denomination or course of training, but to give those college men who desire it definite and reliable information. As the following outline of the programme indi- cates, the speakers are especially fitted to pre- sent their particular topics. ' .. Friday afternoon, March 25th, Dr. Josiah Strong, President of the American Institute of Social Service, will speak on '' Existhi.g social conditions and the opportunities they present ., ·the ministry,'' and Professor George A.

Faculty Reception~ The reception in Silliman H~ll last Sat~. urday evening under the auspi.ces of th~ F acuity was most ·enjoyable.. Tbe gathering was congenial and aside from the usu.al ple.asur.es of such an occasion, college spirit, what we need mQst .at Union just at present, was aroused. The students con:- gratulate the Faculty (pardon· the presumption ) not only on. their complete success as hosts but for fostering for us a spirit which holds the true interests of Union above all selfish compe-nsation that college politics may offer. Un~ecognized Athletic Teams. There cannot be the least doubt that the members of the '' Union College Basket Ball '' team di~tinguished them- selves and brought credit to . Uni01)3 when they played in Glens Falls on March 7th. Th~ men on the Union team seem modest in referring to the event and were rather diffident in disclosing the score. It happened to be 50-o in favor of Glens Falls. Note what a compliment to the College this paragraph, taken from a Glens Falls paper is: \ Just what indu~ed the visitors to come to Glens Falls in the guise of basket ball players is not known. If anyone ever told them tl;lat tb~y could play the game it wa·s intended· only for a joke, .and if Union ever placed any stock in what was told them they are to be pitied.'' That is a striking advertisement fQr the College and it simply shows what unrecognized athlet .. ic team.s are capable .of doing. The Athletic Board., after . due deliberation last year, decided that it was best not t<i> recognize Basket Ball as a regular bra-nch of athh:tics at Union. That should have been sufficient to end any question about the matter. There can certainly be no ob .. jection to youthful enthusiasts playing this game but it 1nust be remembered that they do not represent Union. If such a team is in search of a name we would suggest the '' Invincibies '' or the \ Holy Terrors '' or something €qua11y appropriate, THE NARROW PATH.

On Friday eveoing, Ma.r.ch 11, the annual THE CONCORDIENSIS. ll oratorical contest between Syracuse Univer .. sity, Rochester University and Union College was held in the Emmanuel Baptist Church on Nott Terrace. rfhe audience was not large but seemed appreciative. The stndent body sung a few college songs in the intermissions between the orations. The subjects of the orations, the order in which they were deliver- ed and the speakers were : \General John B. GordQn,\ A. II. Rutledge, Union, 1904; '' 1\he Russian Awakening, Joseph A. Mosher, Syracuse, 1905; and \Robert E. Lee,\ Solo- mon J. Applebaum, Rochester, I 904. T'he first speaker paid Gordon a tribute as a soldier, statesn1an and patriot. Mr. Mosher, who represented Syracuse gave a very graphic description of present political and economic conditions in Russia and pointed out the necessity of social and governmental reform. His oration was delivered in a very earnest and forceful manner. Mr. Applebaum, who spoke for Rochester, defended General Lee's title to 1mn1ortal fame, both as a man and as a military leader. His delivery was strong and determined. After the third oration the judges of deli very retired for about fifteen minutes. Their chair- man, the Rev. G. E. T'aln1age then announced that Mr. J\fosher of Syracuse was awarded the medal. The winner was heartily cheered. The officials for the occasion were : Professor Edward E. Hale jr., chairman of arrangements for the contest : Professor Archibald L. Bouton, of 1~. Y. University, judge of thought and style ; and Rev. George E. 1\alrnage Principal Arthur J\farvin and Rev.

Severson, one of Seneca Falls' most prominent physicians, in tl1e prime of life, and success fully within his grasp, is unspeakably sad and the event has cast a gloon1 over the whole cotnmunity in :which his life's work had been so well done. He died March 1, I904. Dr. Severson was the son of Mr and ]\irs Wm. H. Severson, of Cohoes, N. Y., and wa~ born May 12, 1863 and catne with his parents to Seneca Falls in childhood. After gradua· tion fro1n Union College he studied medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in N. Y. City and upon his graduation here served some time in the Bellevue hospital, re- turning from there to Seneca Falls to practice his profession. For a time he was associated with the late Dr. F. L. Severson and upon Dr. Seaman's death he succeeded to a large part of l1is e:l(tensive practice. Then for a time Dr. J. S. Purdy occupied with him the office in the Gould block. Dr Severson was a man of strong character, . pure in thought and deed, an untiring student and devoted to the study and practice of his chosen profession. About three years ago Dr. Severson was united in n1arriage to Miss Evelyn Mead of Cuba, N. Y., who with a daughter two years of age, is left to mourn his loss. He is also survived by his parents and one brother Fred Severson of Fredonia, Kansas. t '54-. ·Rev. o~aniel Nlarvin died, at his dence 43 Hancock ave., Brooklyn, of plexy, May x6, 1903. . rest· apo· .

THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XX\ 7 11. UNION COLLEGE, MARCH 23, 1904. No. 22. ALLISON--FO,OTE PRIZE DE.BATE· Won by the Adelphic Society and C. Lansing Hays, '04. The annual Allison-Foote Pdze Debate be- tween the Adelphic and Philomathean Liter- ary societies took place last Saturday evening in State street Methodist Church. The ques- tion debated was \ Resolved, that Universal Suffrage does not apply to aliens, paupers, criminals or the insane, nor will the debate involve the question of woman Suffrage.\ After a very spirited and even contest the question was decided in favor of the Adelphics who upheld the negative. C. Lansing Hays, 'o4, won the individual prize for the best single speech of the evening. The speaking began at 8. 30. President Raymond, after a few explanatory remarks to the audience concerning the debate, introduced A. ,V. Lent, 'o4, as President of the Philoma- thean society and E. T. Rulison, j r., 'o4, as President of the Adelphic ; they introduced the several speakers of their sides in turn. The Fhilomathean tea1n consisting of Luke F. Lovelock, 'o4, George I\1. Elmendorf, 'os, and C. Lansing Hays, 'o4, supported the affirma- tive side of the argun1ent and the Adelphics the negative. Their team was Charl~s G. Stiles, '04, Stephen C. Fiero, '04, and Elbert V. Mulleneaux, 'o4. 'l'he Alternates were Harry H. Sylvester, 'o6, and Herrick Mc- Clenthen, 'o6. The first speaker for the affirmative, Luke F. Lovelock presented a very interesting ac- count of present political conditions in the United States and their causes. He touched on the question of Negro Suffrage and showed th~t restrictions in that direction especially were necessary and expedient. He said that he object of suffrage was to continne and perfec.t government and that the present vote of the country was not tending in that direc- tion. 'Charles G. Stiles, the first speaker for the negative presented an entirely historical argu- ment,. showiag that since the tin1e of Adam, Universal Suffrage has been the watchword of progress. George M. Elmendorf spoke next for the affirmative. He first restated the question, showing that it dealt with present conditions only. He then went on to prove that restric- tion of negro snffrage was necessary in the highest degree. He said that if a man was ignorant and degraded as the negro is he has no right to have a share in the government. Stephen C. Fiero presented the next argu- ment for the negative. He also dealt main I y with the historical side of the question and presented the theory of Universal Suffrage as the ideal condition of a country. He showed that in the case of several states the restric- tions ·on suffrage had not bettered political conditions. His speech was deiivered effec- tively. The next speaker for the affirmative, C. Lansing Hays, treated the Negro Question exhaustively. His style was simple and con- vincing. He sa.id that the negro was in his intellectual infancy and that politics were not only harmful but absolutely dangerous to him. Elbert V. Mulleneaux closed the direct ar- gument for the negative. He treated of the ethical side of the question. He held that there is no doubt that present political con- ditions are deplorable and that they should be righted on the ground of man's duty to rnan. He said that Maahood Suffrage has ·made· the United States the world power that it is and that it should be continued. The rebuttal followed ; each speaker refu t

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ing, denying or attempting to deny what his opponents had said. Son1e of the points were well taken but there was more rambling talk than was necessary to fill up time and trivial matters were magnified to no effect.. Some of the individual speeches in the di- rect presentations were extremely good but neither society seemed overcharged with con- vincing arguments. After the rebuttal:, the ·Judges retired for ~ about twenty minutes. On their return Judge ·Cullen announced that the Negative had won the debate and that the individual prize was awarded ~to C. L. I-Iays of the Philornathean Society. The winners were heartily cheered. The Judges were : Judge B:dgar M. Cullen of the Court of Appeals ; Hon. Charles Tra- cey of Albany, and Mr. A. G. Davis of the General Electric Co. INTER-CLASS TRACK MEET. The sophomores easily won the inter-class meet held in the Armory last Friday evening. Waldron, 'o6, made the largest number of points, leaving I 7 to his credit while Raymond, 'os, Hagar, 'o6, VonDannenberg, ~o6, and Reeder, 'o6, follow with ten points each. The 300 yard run was closely con te5ted be .. tween vValdron and Harvey, the latter win- ning by a narrow tnargin.

A geological society has recently been foun- ded entitled ''The Order of the Eshai \ whose membership, it is stated, consists of those who earnestly and seriously have been and are par- ticipating in the study of the paleontology of the seditnentary formations of New York state. The Order is divided into three sections, one of which is composed of the \Immor- tales,\ or those who have toiled and who now have ceased from their labors. In this section appears the name of Richard B. Rowe, Union '96, whose early death was a serious loss to Geology in this country. In the section of the '' Mortales,'' or living geologists, appear the names of Edgar It. - - 1Cu Cih ~Ch Ut w~ . 1a1 be st: th th N OJ o: it fc s 1 ( ( 1

All of the Union Alumni 1nen1bers of the above order : were students of Professor l)rosser. The work of Dr. R. B. Rowe on the Devon- ian geology and paleontology of Maryland will be pubEshed by the Geological Survey of that state ~daring the present year. Dr. E. R. Cumings has published papers in the A.1:nerican Journal of Science describing the evolution of certain Brachiopods and de- veloprn·ent of Bryozoa. Dr. J. M. Clarke, State Paleontologist of New York wrote in very complimentary terms of the former paper and Mr. Charles Schuchert , of the U. S. National Museum, in speaking of it said, \it is the best study ever made of a fossil Brachiopod.'' Dr. Cutnings is now as- sistant professor of geology at Indiana State University and acting head of the department. The last report of the State Paleontologist of New York contains a lengthy paper by Mr C. A. Hartnagel on the Cobleskill or Coralli~e limestone of New York. He demonstrates the age ()f this limestone and the paper is said by Pro:f~ssor Prosser to be one of high order in the combination of paleontology and strati- graphical geology. FRESHMAN BANQUET Held in Albany on March IS, a Great Success. In accord with an ancient and honorable custom the Freshman class gave a banquet. Moreover it was a most enjoyable affair in every particular and to nearly everyone in particular; the exceptions referring to certain Sop hon1ores who tneandered disconsolately about the respectable City of Albany with hearts burning and pulses flittering, for the dies irae had arrived and lo, found them un- prepared. The festivity took place at Stanwix Ha~l, \· THE CONOORDIENSIS. 7 · Albany, on Tuesday evening, March 15. There was not the usual expression of exuber- ant camarade between the Freshmen and the Sophomores, most of the members of the ;lat- ter class having previous engagements or oth- er urgent business to detain them at home. The Class of 1907 is to be congratulated on the way in which the banquet was managed and on the complete success which crowned their efforts. The following account is from the Albany ''Argus'' for March 16th. ''Four Union college sophomores, with the traditional rashness of their class, made an attempt last night to break up a dinner at Stanwix Hall attended by 98 .men1bers of the san1e institution. The attempt failed after one of the sophomores had lost a good pint of blood and enough assafoetida had been wasted to equip an ordinary retail drug store. As everybody who lives within near radius of a college knows both freshman and sopho- more classes are in honor bound to interfere with any attempt the other may n1ake to holJ a class dinner. 1\'his year the Union freshmen were unexpectedly successful in keeping their plans a profound secret. The second-year men did not know they even in tended to dine when they slipped a\-vay from Schenectady yesterday afternoon and evening, singly or in small groups to avoid suspicion and traveled to this city. About eight o'clock they met at the Stanwix, where everythtng was ready for the dinner, and not a sophon1ore in sight or a freshtnan n1issing. :But just as the oysters made their appearance four sophomores did happen around, and the fact that they brought assafoetida showed that they expected to jar the smoothness of the freshmen's arrangements. Undaunted by superior nutnbers, they made frequent sallies into the corridor of the hotel and succeeded in dumping handfuls of the vile-smelling drug up- on the freshmen's nice l'uxedos. This con- tinued until the freshmen made a bold sortie \and, after a merry fight cap tared two of the 1 I

8 THE CONOORDIENSIS. second-year tnen and brought them into the dining room bound hand and foot. The other two escaped. According- to the custom of all Indian tribes, the captives were reserved for torture and amusetnent during the Ia tter part of the feast. The dinner was most enjoyable and the din- ing room walls trembled until a late hour with the volume of tuneful melody. Following was the toast list : E. W. Goff, \r 907 ;\ E. V. Mullenaux, \Union Old and New;'' A. H. Rutledge, \Concordy;\ H. 's. Olmstead, \ Sons of Dix- ie at Union;'' C. E. McCotnbes, \ Prospects for 1904 on the 'Track;'' F. C. Patton, ''Foot- ball;\ E. S.

One knocked at the beloved's door, and a voice answered from within, \vVh.o is there?\ Then he answered, '' It is I.\ Then the voice said, \This house will not hold thee and me.''

Tweaking The Femur. This is a polite synonym for leg·pulling. It is as old as the sycophant and finds new birth in many a college student. Professors know ~the characteristics of the leg-puller. He is primarily a parasite ; one who tries to be what he is r.ot and mouths behind your back. Often he assumes an afliectionate mien toward a Professor a.rtd sometimes the latter is deceived. A student who is an adept in such matters often passes for a hard and-sincere worker. Often when a Professor has made the m.eaning of a certain point as plain as day you will hear a meek angelic voice from the first row query : '' Aw Ptofessow ,-ahem\-so and so etc, until it makes you sick to listen. H'e will ask the most inane questions and show always an ultra-interest in class-room. Often he lingers after class to whisper honeyed secrets. Such is he and such he will be always and so should be pitied. A student who is not man enough to depend on himself for what grades he gets is not fit to be sent to College. Some men go through life \tweaking femurs\ and we are sure no one envies them. There is a difference, however, a great difference, be- tween deliberate deceptio!l for the sake of a mark and an active healthy interest in a subject. A man is often mis- judged, however, when. he seems to show special interest in any topic. When it is natural, it is right ; but when it is artificial, it is unfair both to the man himself and to his fellow students. The Track The Athletic Board .is to be congratulat· ed on the success of the Inter·class Track Meet held last Friday. They Meet. spared no efforts to make the event an enjoyable one for both contestants and spectators. To Manager McCombs of the Track Team the grati· tude of the student body is especia11y due. He worked hard to perfect the details of the meet and he was certain- ly successful. He was instrumental in rousing College and Class spirit and nothing further need be said. \ The Battle It should have been mentioned at the of Salamis.\ time that the article en titled '' The Battle of Salamis,\ which appeared in the Concordy of March g, was, in part, a paraphrase from a description of the fight in the ''Persians \·of Aeschylus.

LEBANON. By MICHEL I. ATIYA.H, Ex-'04, of Beirut. Syria. Lebanon stands in many respects unrival- led among the mou nt::tins of the world. On account of its majestic fonn, of the great numbers of old trees that crown its summit and fill its recesses, on account of the beau- ty of its scenery, and the glorious appearance of its peaks from tbe rays of the setting SUll. There is no na tne that has a mor'e ven- erable sound to the ear, that i1npresses the mlnd more deeply, than that of Lebanon. The Eastern wav;es of the Mediterranean have beaten for many centuries on its west- THE CONOORDIENSIS. 11 ern boundaries, which, worn by the successive blows, and disabl:ed by old age, could not resist the advancing dominion of the sea ; in this w_ay its bar was bounded with a broad strip of sand. The western foot of the mountain, freeing itself of every sign of defeat starts abruptly from the sand and rises slowly and gracefully, well-fitted to begin the noble hills beyond. .1\'lle remembrance of old things is often ac- companied with the idea of weakness and decline, of a bent head and a curved back, but the reality of this idea is destroyed in the case of Lebanon. Its peaks that spread their white flags in the upper region·s of the sky, and the huge rocks that jut from its slopes, bear the emhlen1s of vigor and youth. 1\'hat which embellishes this mountain and makes its name more holy, and which testifies in plain words to its venerable age, is a forest of cedars whose majestic looking and wide-spread branches cause the botanist to stand struck with wonder. They bring to the care of the historian the echo of the Tyrian axe, and reveal to the mind of the religious what the Psalmist 1neant when he said that ,. The righteous shall grow like a ceda.r in Lebanon.\ Even nature, the mother of every being, looked upon that region in its childhood as perfect, and when the years dragged a train of digits after the date of its birth, she highly respected Its hoary age. As a kind mother watches over her babe at night, salutes him when he awakes with the tenderest smile, caresses him all day long, delights to see him frolic, and embraces him that he may sleep with tranquility 'vhen darkness again pre- vails, so tnother nature has cared always through past ag-es for Lebanon and has beautified it with all her powers. The rays o.f the tnorning sun reflected by the drops of de\V that hang on the leaves of the vines and fig- trees show many a rainbow, the blessed remembrance of God's Covenant. As the day breaks every trace of a clou_d disappears,

THE CONCORD:EENl9'IS. a11d those beautiful hills are left to enjoy the heat of the sun under the aztke of the sky. After his day's work the sun goes to rest, but does not part easily with the for.e·sts of !Jines and the groves of olive trees that clothe the western slopes of the n1ot1ntain. He tries to hold their branches with his lingering rays, but ·these are broken when the gentle breeze shakes the branche~, bidding hin1 a last fare· well. Many times he succeeds and peeps back from the horizon to gain one glimpse tnore of the purple hued hills, and then sinks into the depths of the sea. The chime of bells, echoing in the deep valleys, ring out the call for prayer in the Christian villages at the twilight hour. It is night. 'rhe moon is brightly shining. Myriads of stars are sparkling in the sky. 'fhere is no sign of life, stillness pervades everywhere. Nature ls asleep. But there is a gray headed tnan who has been on many a glorious field and has carried the noblest sc~rs that ever rested on the face of a soldier that does not sleep. At this silent hour he plunges into the m·etnories of his past. T'he ruined foundations on the tops of the hills, the un- earthed subterranean tunnels, the burnt villa- ges, the great stony sepulchres, the n1assive lead coffins, are all but words scattere·d on this page of the ages, and if they were collected and read by a historian they would give the story of the nations which have prospered under the shade of. the ~edars. Peace now reigns. In the favored resorts the appearance of rural life attracts attention. A set of strong, healthy people are continually digging the ground and looking for the hidden treasures. Springs of fresh water that gush forth fron1 the rocks return thetn the best re- wards. In short, fragrance and fruitfulness, happi- ness and exalted life, are inseparably connect- ed with the name of Lebanon. ALUMNI. '96- John B.
