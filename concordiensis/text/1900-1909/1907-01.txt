bolical rep·resentati ve of t:he great god Rhuda and placed a,,t the gateway to the tom \b. I swellied with pride and soon cast stony and haugblty glances upon the groveHrl'g mortals at 1ny 13eet for what is life ibut a fitful dream w·hi1e I am. - unchanged after centuries'?. I have seen many genera Uons and yet my Y'0uth is as -of old and passing years do burt strengthen my body. For centHries I ha.ve .mRrked the hurnble g•rave and then there we:ee mol',(~ gra. ves and more· and soon the place becan1e kn@vtn as the Graves of the Mandarins and my ;j!)(i)Siti.on was even 1nore powerful than ·before. In my cool deliberation 1 heh.eld ma.ny eha·n.ges among mo.rtals, there wer.e rumors of new dis- coveries be·yond the seas, but in Chi·na we do not change. It is not fitting that the son follow in the footstep·s of the father? One day I beheld a 11ew face in the throng before me and it was not of accustomed yellow. Wihence this foreigner? He is not of Japan for I know the Japa.nese; neither is he of Bur.mah for with the greasy nat·iv:es of that smaJ:l and benighted land have i also· an acquaintance. I could not forget that face and I was soon to know that it boded me no good, for in a sh.ort space of time it a.ppea.red before me again and in wnrds of even more decision than the great Vizier l;lSed, he commanded my removal fro·m the spot. I, the great god Rhuda, had to leave 111y accustnmed spot under the banyans and wa..s packed in a huge black covering aad sent a way. Oh, how I suffered in the torturing confines of that cover; how the winds buffeted the thing which carried me. I know not how long I remained in that place but the ne:xt distinct memory is that the light o'f blessed day poured in upon me and I was taken forth amid howl:::, of fiendish laughter. I beheld nc almond eyes, no banyan trees, no simple life, but saw hordes of men in clothes of the same design a.s those of my purchaser and men who resembled hirn in countenance. I have since learned th.'lt I was in Union Col- lege in the far away land beyond the se·~t. I was 7 then anchored in front of a building called the Chapel and wns treated with great disrespect by these n1en who do not unden:rtand what I repre- sent. I \Vas draggeu from place· to placo and made sport of by all classes of people. I was next plie:tced in the rear of the residence of a being caHed the President, but m.y treatment w.as no bettc:r here. There secn1s to be no one· 1n authority for this President did not cut off heads and secure the abject reverence -of his subjects. That dreaded word Faculty came into my exist- ance and behold the ;:e.sult! I am securely anchor<:d behind the Red BuHding where my only trials are fm· a few days at · ... he beginning of the coUege year. Have you seen. that queer obj~ct which I hold in my arms? It is all that r~ma.ins of a brazen F'reshn1an who tried n1.y patience too far. But no\\T must I seal n1y lips agrdn i.il'l the god W(u San again pernTits n1e to say tll.at which may at sorne future Lln1e be 0f iB. to:rest to those peculiar yet interesting Americans. With this I leave you but not with feelings of remorse for the old home ·with the Mandarians, because 'wtth all your faults I love you still.' Briefs.

THE PROPOSALS OF THE ATHLETIC BOARD rfhe recon1n1endations of the Athletic Hoard involve four interesting points. .l\s to three of the n1atters· brought up there can be roon1 for but little doubt. Unques- tionably these will not co1ne up for de- bate. But there promises to be son1e ar- gunlent for and against the proposition that the athletic tax for the Spring tenn be raised fron1 two to three dollars. We venture to say that the argun1ent will not concern itself so n1uch with the an1ount as with the principle involved. vVe very naturally ask what has becorne of the Fall tern1 football tax. \;\1 e understand fro1n co1npetent authorities that this football tax was disposed of in purchasing the basket ball accessories. Everything legiti- n1ate was done to insure the success of the new tean1. The tnoney -vvas spent judiciously and can be accounted for, every penny. It necessarily takes a large an1ount properly to ina11gnrate a new branch of athletics. We may consider otlr- selves fortunate that we clicl not have to resort to an additional subscription. So far as the present season is concerned we believe that the n1anage1nent will be able to present a satisfactory report at th~ an tet ye lh stc: wl co fot aff t'h~ a W( up nr se~ no th; no pl< ou na pr~ ne th: thl .

rrHE CONCORDIENSIS II the end of the ter1n without relying upon any additional subscription in the Spring tern1 to cover the deficit. And so, for this year, affairs seern to be in good condition. Hut what of othe1· yea(s? Assun1e, for in- stance, that we have no sui table place in which to play basketball. Under such conditions the gate cannot Le counted on for a source of revenue. Such a state of affairs would argue strongly in favor of t'he proposed change. On the other hand, were we assured of a place in which to play· the gan1e that would hold a large crowd we could rely upon the gate receipts in very great n~eas­ nre. 1~;h,en the coBection of an extra as- sessn1ent n1ight well be obj ectecl to. But the prospects for a good court are ·not bright and we think it safe to predict that the tnanagen1ent for next season will not be successful in its quest for a proper place. \N onlcl t'hat son1e divinity con1e to our rescue with the long-looked-for gytn- nasium! In view of the fact that we shall, in all probability, have to pay the extra an1ount next year, why not n1eet the obligation this year and do all in our power to give the tean1 a substantial boost? As to football there can be no question regarding what action the student body will take. The loss of the ga1ne was so keenly felt last Fall that we think there are few tnen in College who will oppose it. We congratulate the Athletic Board upon the sound judgn1ent and good taste of 111aking it possible for Dr. Towne to becon1 e a n1en1ber of the B.oard. His ser- vices to the College were especially note- worthy and even now that his official con- nection has been severed his interest and enthusiasn1 shows no sign of abaten1ent. BASKETBALL It. P. 1., 32-Union, 25. Our first game of basketball was played with :H. P. I., Dec. 15, '06, on the latter's floor at T,roy. It \Vas a very loose game from start to fi11i.sh, but at times both teams showed that they could play good basketball. Our boys \Vere at a disadvantage, both because of the small floor Rpace and also because of theh· opponents being hPavier at least five pounds to a man. In. the first part of the first half it seemed as if the R. P. I. players \vould easily defeat the Union men, but the Garnet soon started to show what it could do in passing and the con- test grew very exciting. At the end of the first half the score was 11 to 10 in our favor. In the first part of the last half our men seemed to be very much confused and then passing and. team work was very weak. But -finally Union showed her spirit again and grad- ually checked R. P. I., but time was called before she Vi'as able to make up what had been lost. The }ast five minutes of playing \Vas fast by reason of several substitutes entering the game. At the beginning of the second half R. P. I. put in a fresh set of players, but on our team the only change was Potter for Captain Shutler, Later Starbuck took the place of Bro\vn and almost instantly Ina de a goal from the field.

THE CoNC'ORDIENsts VOL. XXX. UNI:ON COLLEGE, JAN. :19, 1907 No. :rz BASKETBALL. :n. 1). I. 12-Union 26. A large crowd of students witnessed the fast game of basketbaH in the gymr1asiurn last Sat- urday night -when Union beat R. P. I. ·by th_e score of 26-12. Though the team confi.d:e-Y:l tly expected to -win, the victory was encou·raging after the bad defeat at Williamstown of the preceding week. As Rensselaer won the :first game of the series in Troy last month ,the deciding game i:s yet to be played-probab:ly :in Albany during February. The first goal in Sat- urday's game was scored by Shutler afte1· sev- eral minutes of play. During the remainder of the half Starbuck made one basket and Brown two for Union, Wise throwing two and Walters one for Rensselaer, the half ending with the score 8-6 in favor of Union. The play was even faster in the second half, and severa1 very pretty and sensational baskets were made, ,tJit,t.~ game ending 2()-12 in Union's favor. The whole game was reinarkab1y clean and free from fouls ,and this together with tlle scientific work done made it an especially good game from the observers' point of vie1\r. Every· 1nan on the team played a fine gan1.e and aU five show the e·ffects of good systematic coae\h- in.g and leading. For Rensselaer Wise player] the best game. The score follows: UNION. R. P. I.

Editor Conco.rdiensis, Dear Sir :-A few days ago, 11.a vi ng som·P- spare time, I wandered into the library and upstairs. Having explored the first landing I ascencded the next flight of stairs and .found myself in \vhat appeared to be a storehouse of curiosi-ties. Later on I learned that the museum of the Co H ege was tbere or stored up there. I spent nearly two heurs in the room and was sur- prised at the variety and number of rare ex- hibits I found. But such disorder! such .I'Jirt! such decay! Gaily plumed birds were lying- in piles by the s!de of stuffed animals, much the W()rse for neglect. Beautiful s·hells lay ilil'<lh3- cri minately pi led up in corners with dust and refuse scattered over them. Hundreds of bot- tles and jars containing exceedingly interesting Right Forward. speci,mens of countless animals, reptiles, and Starbuck ..................... Hinman, Searl€s the l;ke, were piled together on the floor. Relics Left Forward. and specimens alike lay in hopeless confusion.

6 And o.-n everything was dust, di.rt,. and rnor·e dust. When I left I felt very strongly that some Law School Notes The S:tuCI.enis;. Club has been duly installed tn its new quat.·t<ers. Under th.e auspices of the steP' sh~>uld be taken at once, to preserve the8e local Y. M. C~ A. the movement promis€s to be valua.lil'1e and interesting curi'osities. It seerrtecl a great suee e ss and it wiU doubtless offer large a c~yiJ.1g shame that so many rare specimens should be let go to rack and ruin, like cast of,E clo0r€E;. And in truth what need is t'here or any such condition? A few hundred doUar.s wisel:v €xpended would work wond~ers. Eveu. if n~ :repairs were made, the ex:pencliiture of a, rela.ti V€'ly small sum would be su.fficient to at least d€an the place out and put the :eollec- opportunit:Les flor helpfuilil:ess.

The exist- ence c.f a museum such as is there, ts certainly a tllililg to be proud of and a thing to be pre- serveod. In fhe present condition of things few people, eve11 the men in College, know of the existence of a.n:y such vast storehouse of il':l!terest and infornation.

The Skating Rink There has lately been much question r~dsed in CoJlege in regard to the skating rink and the Hockey Clu.b. It i'S evident that the latter depends . almost entirely upon the former. Last year, as all :know, the rink was 11·ot a success. This was not due, however, to any lack of effort or work on the part of the com- mittee, for ~much time,. work and thought was expended upon it. T'he failure was due ahnost entirely to the poor weather of last winter. There was little real skating weather, frosts as one of the College organizations formally recognlzed by the Athletic Board. This, 'how- ever, does not mean that everyone in College should not try to make hockey very suceessful here. For this reason every man in College who has any abili:ty or thinks he ·would like to try, is urged to hand his name to Captain Franchot at once. The support of the whole student bQdy is u~ged. This support can be given, both phys- ically and financially. Unless you are i ending support i-n one of these ways, don't knock.

But the editor trespasses upon our good hutnor in casting off so lightly a tnatter of deei[)est concen1 to all who are inter.ested in the College and its welfare. vVe refer to t:he recent disturbances connected with the Senior exan1inations. We are inclined to think that the editor failed to realize the full in1port of the n1atter. He treated it flippantly and without regard for the feel- i H gs of those vitally concerned. \V e con- sirder it ill-advised to tear open a partiaHy healed wound. Far better, were the mat- ter reviewed with at least an attetnpt at fairness. President Rayn1ond's address of Nov. 24 is by no 111eans self-explanatory, nor can we say that it n1akes a proper .al- lowance for the students' point of view. But we will not enter into a second dis- cussion of this question, for we realize full well that such a discussion would only arouse further and deeper thought upon a n1atter that already rankles deep. Son1e idea of this depth 111ay be ascertained froq1 the fact that the Senior Class, in a recent 1111eeting, n1oved to adjourn rather than t<tke the first step toward tnaking another bargain by tneans of which the privilege of holding College 111eetings in the Chapel could he regained. CONGRATULATION The student body acted wisely and ex- peditiously in unhesitatingly adopting the proposals of the Athletic Board.

~J :. I '·.-1 . ·I'' ; i 6 ·THE COt\CORDIENSlS Junior Week PreJJarations have been completed; the va:d- ous committees have finished their work, and. according to all signs, Junior Week will funy- equal any of its predecessors in O:]d Union. 's 'history. Consent has 'been obtained from t:tle Facu~ty to have a two days' vacation, the 8th and 9tlh of February. The lunior Hop on Thursday evening will start the festivities. Th<i:s function. wHl be held in Yates' Boat House. Parsons and Reubens will furnish the music, and t1be committee have placed the price of tickets ~tt $1.50, so as not to overstrain the tried re- sources of a week's gayeties. Friday wil'l probably be given up to inte 1- lectua'l recreation, as has hitherto been th.'e custom. If the Faculty decide to earry this out as usual, a speaker will lecture in the Chapel in the morning and the annual Allison- Foote debate will occupy the afternoon. Thi:s matter has not been fully settled, and there is considerable talk of holding the debate the following week, so as to leave the speakers time to recuperate before the contest. In U1e evening the Soiree will be held. The comm'i t- tee, following out the idea institute.d last yea..r, have secured the ball room of the Ten Eyck Hotel, Albany, for the occasion. Without doubt this is the most appropriate place that could be found for the event, and there is every rea- son to believe that last year's banner Soiree will be eclipsed. The committee have taXjed their ingenuity to the utmost, and there is every reason to believe that those vrho attend will have the most enjoyable social time of their lives. Zita's full orchestra will provide the music. The price of the tickets has been placed at $4. The various fraternities have already secured private cars, in anticipation of the rush. Saturday evening dances at the fraternity houses will end the week. Concerning the usual Junior Week concert, the management will not give a definite report. The sam.e ob- j.ections that apply to the debate enter Ln to the question of this event, namely, that the perform·ers. would be so tired oat by the \Vee:k.'s round of il.nerrymaking that the affair WOI:U ~d not possess the vim necessary to make a g<ilod impressio.n. The quesUon will probably be !Jil ut to the vote .of the members of the mus ieal organrzations, and .a report wrU he made la.,te~r. However) H i·s high!ly probable that a COI'lee.rt will be given on Friday afternoon. M a rta..'g e r Parsons has not yet been able to make :s-un- able a1>:rangements wHh the Van Curler au- thoriUes.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 7 dirty-faced children in her yards; but this has Portsmouth newspapers or Portsm.outh peo:p lie; gone :by. She retired from buslness long ago, and for y.ears she has tolerated nothing that but he had a presentiment that ther·e would be troubl·e Lf he acted directly upon this id~a, looked Hke :a vulgar scramble for morley within and he accordingly attempted to foo~l the an- her borders. Her last factory, which had been looked u:pon as a nuisance by her best peopl.e, cients by getting up in a meeting of the boar·d and saying that he knew of a man who was was burned down soon after the wat>, and the sick and who was annoyed by this bell busine-ss, one ~man who \Vas r.eckless enough to propose and because of this he moved that the mayor that it be rebuilt was driven a\Yay by the in.,. d.ignant citi2ens. She has far1ned· OHt h:..\r poli- tks to several discreet dealers who manage th.em without making a noise, and she has her blacksmithing done at Kittery, where the sound of the anvH wiU not disturb her reveries. Her side\valks are of good, old-fashio.ned brick, and her houses are all suppHE\d with brass knockers and . andirons. Her ·citizens live on their in- comes and venerate kneebreeches. 'l'o such :::t people old customs are. of course, inexpressibly dear, and any attempt to set thern aside, or modify them, after the fashion. of the jostling world outside, is looked upon as little better than robbing a family tomb of your grand- father's bones. One of these customs sets all the bells in town to tolling when a resident dies, and another one rings the one on the town house for fifteen minutes every evening, begin- ning at nine o'clock, at vvhich tirne all respect- able candles go out, and all the first families go to bed. It is needless to say that these were instituted before the oldest newspaper in Amer- ica was published, or the first clock or watch was invented, but they have been. sacredly kept up ever since. At least they \vere religiously observed until about a 1nonth ago, when Alder- man William Martyn, a carpet- bag sort of a scoffer at graveyard mould and your great- grandfather'.s snuff-box, got into his head the notion that if a man died his neighbors would find it out from the newspaperR and bury hiln. and that when folks began to grow sleepy, they be instructed to have the tolling and the ri4~g- ing dispensed with. The motion passed, and the next night there was no nine-o'clock beU. The hundred and twenty-seven matrons w:ho for eighty-nine years hav.e warmed their night- gowns from fifteen minutes hefore nine un.Jil the bell struck stood through the livelong nig-ht holding them up to the grates, and were fouEd there benumbed and stiff the next morning-, by the milkm·en from Rye. Six first settlers, in wigs and gold-headed canes, who have al- ways taken an evening walk, leaving their houses at 8: 40 and traveling sot~.th by the cemetery until the bell warned them to returit, kept on and on their weary way, until th12y were taken up a week later by the police -ef Boston. Sixteen sets of phHosophers, who have met and played whist and drunk punch un:tll the curfew, every evening since Washington \Vas inaugurated, kept at it until they fell under the tables. No stores wer€ closed, no houses were locked, no shutters were put up that night. In short, from the time when the bell should have rung until morning) Portsmouth. yawned and stretched and waited and sai!(l, \What a long evening this is!\ and so it sat and yawnE\d and waited night after night and day after day until last week, when a stra..y copy of the Boston Herald was picked up in the street, and found to contain the horrible . intelligence that the aldermen had stopped th:e curfe'\Y. Then there was such an outburst of indignation as has not been seen since con- would consult their timepieceR and ascertain gress proposed to abolish the navy yard; not a whether it was bedtime without wearing out the bells and the bellman in furnishing the in- formation. Little that alderman knows about noisy outbreak, of course, but a deep, emi- nently respectable; solemn sort of a protesi. Meantime the aldermen, having come to tJ::Le

MUSICAL OLUB FINANCES It is a fortunate thing for our p~~es.ent needs at least, that the finances of the lVIusical Clubs are in a condition th:tt ac1- n1its of no word of con1n1ent other ·than that of the highest praise. The ·n,~n~g~t~­ rnent has worked faithfully ancl vvell to support the business end of this achnirable organization. and there is no roorn for doubt as to its sincerity of purpose and willingness to perfonn the necessary work. ~Tore than this the efforts put forth have not been without clue appreciation fron1 those interested in the Clubs. \\' e preface our rernarks with the~e vvords of deserved praise for the reason that were they on1itted, sotne of our n.:cHl- ers would tniscpnstrue what we hav(~~ to say. Ancl so we begin the discussion \vith an en1phatic affirn1ation of the question \.-\re the finances of the Clubs in goocl condition at the present n1on1ent ?'' \V e speak not of present or even past condi- tions, but we n1erely put forward an idea that has long appealed to -us as offe~ ing one tneans, if not the only 1neans, of placing the finances of the Clubs in a position that n1ight he considered nn- pregnable. 'rhe present systen1 is far fron1 satis- factory on account of the indisputable fact that a better systen1 can be perfected. \vVe clo not say that the present system 1s vvrong - we only say that it is not satis- factory. It is not fair to the manager and the 111en belonging to the organization. It _,.,... itnposes a vast an1ount of needless labor upon the 111anager and keeps hitn in a con- tinuously unsettled state of n1ind. J.t 1s no 111ore than natural that this state of affairs should bear directly upon the mer: in the Clubs. The constant feeling that this trip or that concert n1ay be called off at an hour's notice does not condttce to the clevelop111ent of real enthusiasm for

The best artistic re- sults are al:w.aJs to be o1I>tained wh.ere the tai11t of financ,ral distress fs not found. rt is not fair fo the student body, for v:e aU recognize ihe futility of n1aking a tninute explanalion of reasons attendant upon the tnanag~rnent for the abanclon·- nlen t of sotne J»]:an t~a.t was well worked out in theory, but which fafl:ed in prac- tice. The av€1·age studen~t body in the Atnerican college is ·as critical as is a hungry epicure when he sits down to order a twelve course dinner. And so. following the inrpulses of o11r nature, vve are inclined to have little or nothing b) do with any tlll<rven1ent that does not suit our own good pleasure. Does the Musical Club n1oven1ent suit our own good pleas- ure? Ask the 1nanage1· when he calls upon you for th.at dollar tax that vvas levied upon the nndergradt11ates last faH! .Ask hin1 how n:tany nice, new gold dol- lars are jingling in his lea·n purse. Then, if you clare, t€U hitn frankly just exacthr why you do 111ot purpose to pnt in a dollar to keep company with his ovvn. \!Vhen, perhaps,. you helped to elect hi111: can you say the word \Graft even as a joke? Right here is one of the g1·eat rea- sons for this proposed change-not to re- n1ove the possibility of re-vvard frotn a tnan whotn you rnay know to be square. but rather to avoid the turn your thoughts ·n1ay take. Tl1e purer and cleaner your thoughts are with reference t() the n1anage- 111en t of your organization, just so 1nuch tnore refined and spirited will be your re- gard for Aln1a Mater. But if you <:annot help feeling the way you do when the titne co1nes for your subscription, try to in1agine how the tnanager feels when he reads your thoughts and 6nds then1 fa1~ frorn kinclly disposed. But we wotdd not he clweilling npon th~s phase of the qttestion, particularly its rather disa.~reeab1e aspects, were it not for the fact that we finnly believe th• __ re is a reasonable solution of the prohle,Jn. 'rhe solution invot-ves nothing rnore than a plain and sirnpte n1ethod that has been used tnost successhtlly in recent years ior the n1anagen1 ent of other regularly c~H1 .. stitnted 'CoUege ot-ganizations. \V e refer to the :tnethocl en1ployed in the raising olf the annual at:h.letic tax. vVe n1o:st stron~d '.J <.-, • urge that dile stttclent body dete·nnin'~ upon son1e reaso1table arnount and ~he11 take in1n1ecliate steps toward having tl~i~ anlOUnt coUected each year at the i\S:-;lSt· ant Treasur~er's of:fi-ce. This done. we iur- ther recon11n·end that an aucliting- conl- tnittee be appointe{l, whose duty it shaH be to control all expenditures pertaining to the Mbsical Cht bs. By suc'h a systen} we feel confident that a new spirit will a:t once :tnanifest itself. The student bodY and the n1eH on the Clubs will be released fron1 all anxiety as to the disfJOsition o:f the hard-earned shekels, and the lnanag('r, too, will not be s:ttbjected to the difficulty and hun1.iliation of raising the nece;;,sary funds in th~e present awkward and cn111- berson1e n1anner. 'rilE 1IONO,RARY CHANCEJ.JJ,OR All friends of the College cannot fail to he gratifiecl at th€ welcotne news that 111 all probability our next Honorary Chan- cellor will l)e the Hon. Joseph H. Choate. The selection is o11e that comn1ends itself to alu,lnnns as well as undergraduate. By his wonderful legal talents, and by hiR distinguished dip:l0n1atic serv1ces, l\l r.
