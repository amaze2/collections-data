• A E THE C.ONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXII. UNI:ON COLLEGE, MAY l, 1.909 No. 22 'B-AS E.BAL L. S·ECOND GAME ENDS IN A :LOSS. Rut.ge:rs, 11; Union, 7, Union played its second .gam·e -of ttr~ ·season at New Brunswick, N. J., with Rutgers, be-ing -de- feated by the score of 11 :to 7. Rutgers has the fastest te.a;m it has. ·bad in yea.rs, but there is. no doubt that we wi:ll win the gam.e to- ·be played with them June 5, <}n the Campus. The game w·a.s narked by poor playing on each sid·e, but the error3 by lJnton ·came at m.clore critical pnin-ts than those ·Of Rutgers. To quote one of the play.ers, Union, with tJ.!e luck even, reould have won. Union started off well. s·coring three runs in the fir~t inning. Perry,. the first man up, go·t a two- bagger, Bergan and King singled, bringing in Perry. Then Latiue ·ma.de a tbree-ba..se hit, scor- ing Bergan and King-. Ladue was eaught off third by a throw from the pitcher. Davern and Grant hit to the infield, and were caugh_t out at first base. Rutgers wa·s easy in their half. going out one, two. three. S·cnre: Union 3, Rutgers 0. Union wa.s quickly retired in th·€ se-cond inning. Rutger-s, on a tw·o-bagger, two siagles and· an <:rro-r by Grant, got three runs., tying the soore. In the thi.rd, P'€rry hit s-afely, but was out trying to steal. Be-rgan alld King did not reach first base. FIOr R.utgers, with two out, P rez single-d and Bowen brought him home with a three-bagger. Van Ness was e.asily out. S.core: Union a, Rutgers 4. Ladue started· off the four.th inning for Union by a three-base hit, but was again caught off the ba~e. No runs were scored for either side in this inning. In the fifth, though Dunn hit safely, Union did not sco-re. Rutgers, on the .strength of a three- bagger, two singles and two. errors by Shaw, got fo-ur runs. Score: Union 3, Rutge-rs 8. In the sixth, Perry made hi.s second two-base hit, but was ·caught off second. Bergan got a ~in­ gle, and King ·a base on balls, but each of them was out trying to get home. Rutgers made another run in L:eir half nn a single and an error by Perry. Dunn then strucl{ out the next two men. A d·ouble play was made by Rutgers in the seventh, Green catching Dunn's fly, and tagging Stewart, who had ta-ken Grant's place. 'fl1e sco-re fer Rutgers. was c,o.mpleted in this inning with two more runs, making eleven in all. Van Nes3 got to third on a long hit, Cooper sin- gle.d an.d both g-ot home on Perry's error. In the eight:1, after Bergan had been put out, Perry reachEd first on an. error. Mackey made a two-bagger, King a single and Ladue, with bases full, hit the ball out of the gro·unds for a home run, scoring four runs. Rt:tg€ls waa ea-sily retired in their half of the inning. Union could do nothing in the ninth. Score: Union 7, Rutge-rs 11. The batting of Ladue and· Perry was features, Ladue making two three-base hits and a tome run, wtile Perry ma.de two two-baggers. The str·ong wind helped to bring about many of the. errors <>f each team. Bergan repla.ce.d· Peckham as catcher in the seventh, M:ackey taldng Bergan's ]_)la·ce at second base. · Ste-w~trt was s.ent o-ut into left field instea.d of Grant in the seventh. I.! '' ,.

THE CONco·RD.IENSIS 7 The first a.ppear,a.nce of the MNaical Clubs in th.e city of Albany was m·ade on Thursda.y ·even- ing, when a concert was given in the First Uni- ta-rian Chur·ch. In every way tbe concHrt was m·ost successful and the appreciati.on shown by the audience W3!S espe·cially wa1·1n. It is confident- ly expected that many return enga.game-nts will be made in Albany as a resnilt of the concert. A .s:olo, \Where Ute Lindens Bloom,\ sung by Stott, '12, Medic,. was the on'l:y change in the pro- gram that was given in Glove-rsville. On ·rrue.s.day night a concert will be given in. Amsterd·am and on F:riday tb.e clubs will journey to Newburg, for the longest tri.p o-f the season. ---~----- ORATORI:CA.LS.

MANY VALUAB 1 LE SPECIMENS. 1,he:re is som·ething of which we· are possessed here in Union that will s;oon rr: ake us prouder of the f-act that we are Union m·eH ttan we are even now-if such a thing is possil31e. Tha.t \son1e- thing\ is the museum of antiques on the third floqr o;f the Rountl Building. We don't realize around co.llege wha.t a fine 1nuseum this really i.s and how proud we shoul·d be of it. The reason t3or this is tha.t very few of the feJ:lows now in col- lege haveJ ever beeR in the musel!lrn and .so know very little about it. But all p0ssible ·efforts are being made by Curator Stolle·r to have the mu- seum in a presentable shape by eo,mmencement. Am~on:g the innumerable object, of interest and value in the. library are: Shells .of all descrip- tions, m·inerals, corals, star-fish, bgyptian mould- ings, ·hundreds of stuffed pirds. and the price~ess Wheatley collection of minerals. There is also a shell \:fired from the U. S. ship \Saratoga\ at the battle of Plattsburg, Septem- ber 11, 1814, and presented· to Union OoUege by Gilb'ert Harroun as a rem-inder to the cnllege stu· dents of Americ-an lo·yalty, skill and intrepidity.\ Dr. N ott's carriage is also th·ere with (curiously enough) a Union label under the cushion.

The faculty has made its sele:ction o-f ten Sen- iors for the Commencement stage a.nd the list is as follows. Willia.m W. Brown, Brooklyn, N. Y.; Robert L. Brunet, Petersb-urg, Va.; R. P. Clarke, Kingston, N.Y.; Raymond J. Finch, A1pine, 1 N. Y.; Roy H. McCormack, Delmar, N. Y.; Cromwell M·c- Into:sh, Buffalo, N. Y.; Ellmer W. K. Mould, Green Island, N. Y.; H·erbert D. Sch·utt, Schenecta.dy; Otto J. Walrath, G1oversv.iHe, N. Y., and James B. WeUe.s, Oenes.eo, N. Y. These men a:re to be con- gratulated: upon the hon·or w hicb ha.s come to them as a reward of good a.nd· consistent work. in the ahape of the first bas~ btlrning stove ever made a.nd near it hangs the patent Dr. N·ott pro- cured for it. Besides all these things there are many ether objects o.f value which we ali hope· to see this Commencement. The freshman baseball tea.m was defeated Wednesda.y by the Albany High School at Albany by a score of 10 to 1. As this. was the- Freshmen's fi:rst game, a.nd as Albany has ()lle of the fastest high s-chool teams in the S;tate, the g,core may be accounted for. The battery for th'e F'reshmen was Gray and Biche and M'cDermott. T'o-day the Freshmen go to Glens F'a.lls, wher.e they pla.y the High School team of that place.

Brubaclter, superintend.ent of· schools of Schene•ctady, gave an excepUona1:ly interesting talk to the .students at the ves·per service last Sunday afternoon. He .said tha. t while we are at college we are magnetizing our lhres, 'trying to put into them forces. that shall make us men of cha·rac- ter and influence in the world. On the other ha.nd ' there are fo.rces that are tendin.g to de-.ma.gnetize our lives, to take away the strength of character and of influence. Such de-magnetizing forces are self-seeking; vices, both small and gre:at, of what- ever nature; and a spirit of provincialis-m, whieh keeps men from getting a worltl-wld·e perspective of life. He urged college men to realize that upon them must fall the respons.ibilities of leadership, and with this in view to- follow the exa.mple of the apostle Paul in having a fixed determination in life· and a spirit of burning enthusiasm. At the Tuesday evening praye1 .meeting, Gillies, '12, spoke on \Temperance.\ This was followed by Dr. Hale's mission study dass in \The Un- finished Tas.k.\ The subje-ct ,for the evening was Africa, and the international p-olitical situaUon in events.

The occa·s.ton will long be .remembered \by those who attende·d. as marking a renewal of strong friendship and the pledges of such will doubtless. go far to make the future relations between tbe .city and the college the II'.OSt r1easant. There -is no· dtoubt that th·t members of the Mo~ hawk Club would have gladly extended invitations to t~e entire student bo·dy,. but this being impos- sible the Musical Club was chosen as a representa- tive nrganization. 'The l.ll 1 embers of the Moh.awk Club surely outdid themselv·es in the welcome they gave the visito-rs who were p.re·sent and the oo,m- mittee d·ese-rves grea.t pra:ise for their efforts. The early part of the evening was s:pent in mak- ing everyone acquainted and when thi.s was ac- complished, festivities were adjourned to th·e pa- goda, which wa.s a.ppropriately ·aecorated with Union pe-nnants and hanner·s. While refr·eshments were being s.erved the Musica.l ChillS rendered sev- eral selections, which were w·ell received. As the TENNIS. Plans for the tennis season are rapidly being form·ed. R.egistraUons have been ma.de for an open tournament whi.ch will probably be held dur- ing next week. It is intended to choose the team from the men who show up best in th,is tourna- ment. That the. contest for positions o·n the· team will be cl·ose, is assured from the fact tha.t nearly all of la.st year's team are out, besiJe·s many other stro-ng men. The schedule will b'e co.mpleted shortly and the· management promises that it will be first cl-ass in every way.

The adoption of the system was the result of over a year's work by those intere.;:;ted in the sc~1erne and of sev·.;ral weeks' active consideration by the stu- dent body as a whole. When the scheme was first presented by the Terrace Council some weeks ago, tt.~.ere was considerable opposition to some of the provision.s, principally to t'he on2 compelling a student to report a fraud when detected. After a spirited discussion of the various provisions, it was decided to turn the matter over to a new comrnittee composed of two members from each class. On April 27, W. ,V. Brown, as chair1nan of the revision committee raported that the objection- able arti·cle in the co~.1stitution ;lad been changed t(' read: \That a .student .detecting fraud shall in1mediately give warning to the student who has cribbed, not to hand in his examination. Shall tl::.e detected student fail to 'heed the warning, he shall be reported to the president ·of the court of honor.\ Mr. Brown also reported that the faculty had agreed to count not more than forty per cent. on final examinations, thereby re:rrioving one of the temptations fpr cribbing. The report of the committee was favorably re- the committee be accepted and after being sec- onded, the motion was carried. Faust then r.:1oved that the honor system, as amended, be ad opted, to take effect .September, 1909. It was the cause of a s.pirited discussion. Mould raised the question as to what s'hould be considered suf- ficient evidence of a student'.s guilt if tl...e matter was ·brought befora tbe court ·of honor. Brown, L1 reply, said that no definite rule could be laid down to determine a student's guilt and that if a student swore that he· did not crib the court would probably not convict him. The matter was Lath·Jr discussed by Stewart, Hutchens and Co- hen and then after the amended constitution had been read, a vote by ballot was taken. The re- sult was 146 in favor of adoption and 60 against. On motion by C'hapman '09, the vote wa.;:; made u::anin1ous. SEN lOR MEMORIAL. During ttc past week there has been son~e talk by the seniors of re:rr1oving what remains of the old window panes in the c·bemi·~al laboratory upon vvhich are etched the names of some of Union's most pron1inent alun1ni. Succe-ssive years have b1 ought with them more or less destruction of these windows until at the present time very few p::tnes are lBft. Altbough nothing definite has been decided upon as yet it is very likely that tte re- maining panes will be ren'.1oved and framed at the exp.erse .of the senior class, later to be presented ct:ived, although it was deemed best to defer l\Y them to t'he college as a memorial. d(·finite action so that the· students could have ample tin1e for a discussion of the proposed step. On Tuesday Chainnan Brown again n1ade a re- port for t'he revision committee and a.dvocated fav- orable action on th.a constitution as amended. Un- der the revised scheme, he said, a fellow's crib- ing would be known only to the person who warned him, the professor and himself. J. William Faust, '09 n1oved that the report of SIGMA XI ELECTIONS. Last Tuesday evening Sigma XI held a meeting il· Silliman Hall.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS MEETING OF COMMITTEE ON GROUND.S AND BUI L.DI N G'S. Last Tuesday there was held at President Rich- n1ond's house a meetiug of the Committee on Grounds and Buildings. An inspection of tile grounds was made by the committee and Dr. Rtch- mond presented to them certain id~as which be desires them to carry out in the maintaining Pf the groundb. Dr. Richmond expresRed hims8lf to the effect that ''the best advertisement we can have is to devel-op and beautify our ·campus . .., He said: \We as students, should take more prJ de in our cam.pus and do all we can toward enhancing the natural beauty of tbe grounds.\ Tliis commit- decided upon a site w:O.ich they are to recomm~nd to the Board of Trustees for tlle new Gym. This is to be .in the pasture, preferably down on Sewcnd Place. They yet a.re to procure a land~cape a rchi- tect, who will look over the whole situation as to the future development of the college and to out- line irr1provements that may be made, so that there may be a cJmprehensive S·Ch.eme upon which t) work w'hen the further development i'3 bPg'llD. MUSICAL CLUBS. The Mandolin and Glee Clubs gave an unusually s·-~ ::!cessful -c-oncert at Amste.rdam Wednesday evening. The large audience wa.,s enthusiastic in it~ applause necessitating encores for every nun~­ ber. Following the concert the Phi Delta sorol·ity of Amsterdam entertained the clubs with a recep- tion and dance. Last night the clubs gave a concert in New- burgh. The advance sale of tickets for the p~r­ formance has been extremely heavy and an en- tirely srrccessful trip is practi-cally as-.3ured. PRESS CLUB. The Pre~s ·Club is dev-oting all its energy to the tasks whicli the last few weeks of the college year are bringing to it. The bulletins are being ~ent out to the ninety pa1)ers, to whose colun1ns the club ha.s access. Special articles have been written on the doings of fhe seniors telling of the college honors they have gained. These articles have been sent to the papers in their home towns for publication. Also the club has secured. faciliti0s whereby spe.cia.l, messages are sent out by wire after each game to ten of the pron1inent paper·S 0 1 : the .State giving the score and the n1ain ,f0at- ures of the ga.me. Another important line of work is the sending out of advance bulletins to the towns in which any out of town. contest, whether in the line of athletics or d.eibating, is to take place. These bulletins contain the n::- mes of the team members aiid any additional in;ormation that may be of interest. The folder comn';~.ittee, consisting of Grover and Fisher is preparing a. folder to be given to the fellow.s for distribution during the summer. This folder will be a decidedly noved f2ature so far as Union js concerned. It will con- tain statements regarding the traditions Df Old Union and . the main features and prospects of ~ew Union and should prove a highly successful method of advertising the college. NORTHFIELD. This .summer from .Tuly 2-11, inclusive, there is to be held at ·~:orthfield, Mass., a student c~n­ fErence. About two hundred universiti~s and co1- leges of tt.Le United States and Canada will be represented by the strongest men from thair CD.ristian Associations. The location of North- ftt-·ld on the banks of the Connecticut River is all that could be wished for in the way of beautiful country. It is hoped that Union will have at least twenty-five fellows to represent her this sun1mer and if the fellows can only learn what a \grea..t\ p~ ace it is, there will be a great many 1nore. Tr ... ere are two of the many phases of life which will re- ceive special emphasis at the conference, namely, the religious and the p'bysieal. Many of the finest speakers and Christian workers in the United States attend the conference and twiee -daily rr.tass .. meetings are held at which magnificent address~s are delivered. Beside these meetings special Bible classes are held w·here the fellows can come jnto clos')r contact with the strong men who at- tend. Then for the physical, a tennis tournaln(~nt is lleld and a track meet. Then beside t'hese a baseball tournam,ent is conducted between the dif- ft- rent c-olleges and much pleasure derived tller~­ from.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 7 TENNIS. After a journey in which figHred, as one mem- ber .of the team put it, nearly every form of land conveyanc-e known to New York .State, the ten- nis team ba.s returned from the Cornell Hamilton trip. At lfhaca the n~atch. was IJreve:nted by a hE-avy rain. The team then went to CTinton and played H::unilton with the following resHlt: Capt. Potter '09 {U) defeated Day (H). 'I l L \ I Getn1an. (H} defeated Streibert (U). Osborne :(H) defeated C·oykendall (U). Potter \ill()) (U) defeated Capt. Conklin {H). Getman and Day (H) defeated Str'eibert 3nd Potter '10 {U). Osborn€ and Conklin (H) defeated Coykend2ll rt.nd Pott€;r '09 (U). The team as a whole p1R..yed very well for the first matca of the season. Streibert was somewhat nervous in the singles bat shm.v€ d up well in the doubles. It WR3 Coy- kendall's fir.st intercDllegiate match and consider- ing that fact he played a good game. Capt. Pot- ter was bandicapped somewhat by his ankle w'hich was injured a few days previous. Thus the out- luok for tbe rest of th·~ season. is far fro:n gloon1y. On May 24, Hatr.t.ilton plays· a return match here, and the team should be able to 1nake an excelleat showing against them wit11 tl:::.E' addition of Fairbstirn '12, who )_)lays a steady game ard wi\ \ pr()ve a hard man to neat.

He was ·educated in the distl·ict S·Ch()ols of !his native town and the Troy Gonfer- enc(l Academy at Poultney. In September·, 1852, !' he ~ntered Union College and graduated in 1854. He was ele·cte.d a membe,r of Phi Beta l<:appa and retaiued active interest in the organization hls en- tire life. Leaving Union be stadied law with Wil- liam Barne~ r of Albany and was adn1itted to P! .. 1C- tice in. 1856. He was one of the oldest mernb.er& of tli.a Rutland County Bar, uniting with thE=¥ or- gan b:~ation in the fifties. Mr. Abell was eler.te•:l tv the H()USe of Representativ~es no less than a d.oz€n. tim€s between and including t!he years 1859 and 1900 and in one of the \·off\ years he was ele<~ted Senator from Rutland Conni.y. Probably in rec~nt yeaTs no man has equallecl this record of ''Father', Abell as he was know-n about the State House in Venr:tent. No one o:£ his day and generation has been rnore greatly esteemed by his fellowm~n~ and Ut€ ·community in whiei:l he lived, and in far:!t~ the entire State of Vermont suffers an irreparable lo2s in his death. 1855-. Rev. Sheldon Ja.ckson, who for more than a !half century was a member of the noble hand of pioneers, who carried the gospel into the ·w-il- derness of the west and into Ahska, died l\'Iay 2nd, at Ash. ville, N.

He entered Princeton Theological Seminary in 185:5 and graduated 1858. The sa!L:e year he was ordained by tlie Presbytery of Albany, Dr. Nott presiding. From 1859 to 1869 he did mis- sionary work in the west. Dr. Jackson accom- pUshed much in re1!ig.ious infl:uence·s in thoE~e re- glons, esta'bHshing m1ission schoo~s and self-sup- . porting clhurches at numerotts places in the Rock- ies. In 1877, while planting ehurches in Ore·g·on and Washington he visUed .Alaska-the first or- clained missionary in that region-and at once iocated .a teacher, Mrs. A. R. M·cFarland, at Fort Wrangell. Another very important thing wt~ich Dr. Jackson did for Alaska was ~the bringing in from Russia oJ many reindeer. Thelr n urn ber was f.nst dHcreasing in A:Iaska and in d<ling this he was the means of saving the lives of the natiY<~b te a great extent. His Ir\1lssion work continued in the West until 1 k85 wlhen he wa.s: a.ppointed United States Gen- eral Agent of illdueation in Alaska, which posiUon he held HntH b:is last Hlnesti. D:r.

lOB· UNION DEFEATS COLGATE. Wins La~t lntercolleg.iat.e.~ Debate of Year. Union -w:as victorious i-n the fir.st intercollegiate de-ba;te with 'Colgate, whtch was •held ·in. the college chapel last evening. Th.is ·com·pletes a. straight rec-ord of v:ictories for union in her intercoHegiate ·de,bating during the .past two yea·rs. ''fhe subject as .s.ubm'itted by Colgate_ was: \!Resolved That :the United States Government should own and control the coal ·m-ines of the ·country,\ Golgate defending the affirm:ativ·e .and Uni·on the negative. T·he spe'akers for U'nion were: Bartlett, '10; Wil- son, '09; ·Mould, '019, and iS:chutt, ''09, :as alternate. T;he debaters for Colgate were: Rim:po, '10; Ne-w- com1b, '10; L·evy, '1•0, and 1Burrows, '12, .as alternate. T'he debate' was opened by ·Rimpo, .of ·Colgate. In his opening s·peech li·e sho.wed that t'he coal problem is !one of the gre·ate.st problems confront- ing the country to-day, but failed to define the question and clearly outline the position of the ·affirmative. The nume-rous evils ·connected with the coal question-1child labor, strikes, waste and exorbitant p·rices-. 1were reviewe-d, and the s.pe·aker ended hy sho-wing that the very existence of ·the present evils i.s one ·of the greatest arguments against priV'ate ownership. Bartlett opened the debate for Union. In the first part of his speech he called the •affirm3.tive's .attention· to the fact that they had failed to define t \ d control\ iH 1 e then s·howed the erms own .an · . tlhe difficulty ·confronting the government in at- tempting . to get control of :the mines and asked, \'By what authority Oong-ress could purchase the mines?\ Newcomb, the next speaker for the affi:.rmative, showed that it is alm'Ost an utter impossibility to destroy the coal m1onopo ly, and asked the question, \If so drastic ,a measure 'as destruction has failed to do away with the trust, wh·a-t could mild means Ji ke regulati-on ac,com·plis.h ?\ Wiilson, Union's se·con.d sp·eaker, ·took up the con- ditions in the antlh:ra.c.i te regions, showing that the evils in mining have heen due to past m.ethods, .and . that these evils .are to-day 'being . re·m.edied. Hie quoted. the reports. ·Of the Anthracite ·Ooal Gom.- ,rnis.sioli to show th.at t·he· alleged evils are exag- gerated and that eonditions are g·rowing better ~au the ·Ume. Levy, in .continuing the argument for the affirm.- a:ti ve, showed that they were arguin.g f0r a princi- ple, and tJh.at a co:!llmodity affecting s·o •m,any peo- ple should not be contr Jlled ·by eight or nine per- sons. Hie defined the terms ''own and. control,'' and said that t·he .affirm.ative were in favor o·f having the mines not ·only o-wned, but also leased, .by the government. M\ould, in closing the direct argameH t, brought fe>rth definite objections :to the .poHcy of .govern- ment control, as. follo.w.s: 1, the p:oHcy is so~cialis­ ·Uc; 2, it would give rise to unwarrantable evils; 3, und.er our constitution the governnent has n-o right to op.erate the mines for .the benefit of the general publi-c; 4, a constitutional amend,ment would be necessary; 5, the ·POlicy is revoluUona·ry, an.d, lastly, that go·vernment regulati-on is better than control. In rebuttal, Union destroyed many of the- argu- ·ments of the affir:mati ve, :showing that the condi- tions under the lease of the mine'S would be no better than under p·rivate operaUon, ·and that Con- gress now has the row:e·r to destroy· the :trusts. In closing tlhe re·buttal, Mould s·how·ed that the affirmative wBre arguing a universal pro-position, and that, by the principles of Jogic, one specific instance ·overthrows a univer.sal .proposition. 'Colgate did well in 1 ebutbtl. The affi-rm.:ltiv e strengthened many of its previous arguments and sh·owed that tbe government c.ould .:pl.ace cJndi- tions in the le·ase- pr-oviding for the bettering of the present evils, and said they W'ere defending a principle; th.erefore i.t was unreasonab·le for :the negative to claim that their wh·ole argument wa.s ov-erthrown by one instance. Tihe board o.f judges, eons.isting o·f Ju.dge Alde·n Chester,· Jud,ge Ml. A. Tierney and Dr. Oscar ,S. Rlobinson, retired :for a .short time, a·f.ter .whieh Judge Chester, ch.airm:an' ·of •the board, reported .a unanimious d·eeisiorr in favor •of U·nion. HAMILTON GAME.

THE CoNcoRDIENSIS VOL .. XXXII. UNION COLLEGE, MAY 15, 1909 No. 24 I FITZ HUGH ·1-UD'LOW, '56. \So·n.g to· Old Union~\ Original Manuscript S.ecured. Some time a.go DeWitt Cl·inton, eollege libflarian, began a s.ea.r·c.h for items of interest and of g·GO d authority concerning Fitz Hug·h L.udlow, a g·ra.d- u:a.te of the class o.f 1856. T:o secure· such informa- tion he wrote to s-eve.ral of L;udlow's .college m.ates and. also to hi.s siste-r, Mtss Helen W. Lu-d- is a teacher at Hamp 1 ton Institute, Va. In one of her replies to M~r. CHn:ton she st.a.ted that s1l1e ha.d the original o-f the \Song to Ol.d Union,\ and intend- ed to give it to the college at her death. Immediate- ly Mr. Clinton began w·rit- ing her with a view :to having her give the m·anu- s·cript to the co·llege at once, SoC} that it might be on exhibition at Col]l- meneemenc S!he finally cons·en.ted to do so and it is at present in the pos,sess· ion of the librarian, who is ha,ving .a frame made foT it, ,s.o as to pres.erve the oopy. The a.ccomp.anying photngra.ph was· t!a:ken from a.n ·Gold daguerre·otype, · w~,ich was taken som·e time during· Ludlow's e.arlyt -c-ollege d:aY'S. H'iS· sis.ter s·ays: \It .is a very ioriJ. lil{eness:, I think.\ The nam.e is a ·copy of hi,s ·hantc1 w·riting a:s he us.ed it on his car.d.s, being 'engraved from his· own au:to- grap'h, written for the purpos·e.'\ Writing in regard to F'itz H'ugh Ludlow, Retired Re.a,r Adm.iral ·.], R. T'ryon, clas;s of 185:8, s,a,ys he \was conspicuous. ;f.or his un.iform good nature, af- fectionate disposition, brilliant talent, unbound·ecl enthu~ia:sm, marked generosity,. congen].al com.pa.n- h:Jnship, keen S<en..se of humor, simplicity a.nd cour- age.'' Also, \My as·s.o·ciatio·ns. with him . .as roo·m- ma.te for a term in. C·O:Uege, and afterwa.rd.s· in New York city, tw.o yea.rs after his· gradua,tion, are the cho·icest me·mories. of my Uf'e. H'is ind·iv1duality made an impression upon me I have never fo-rg·ot- ten, an.d a thought O·f hin1 now is a renewal of youth and sa:creJ mem- ories.\ Mr. Frank W. L.ittle, a te-acher in Rochester, N. Y., and nf the elas:s of 1858, also \ovrote a letter c·on.taining college re,co1- lection.s. of Ludlow. He wrote: \F1itz H:ugh Lud- low, when in college, was· intens·ely homely, with a very large mouth and he wore spectacles, which was an unusual thing at that time. He \Vas one of the brightest m-en I ever knew, a remarkable con- vers.ationalist, f111l of wit and humor, with. a vron- derful flow of l an.guage. It w.a·s our habit to sit on the terrace in front of the .college and s:ing after supper. He wrote the 'rrerrace Song,' which \\Ya·s very popular. He also wrote a 'S·ong to Ol<L Union.,' whieh was .sung on Commen.eemen:t d.ay wh'en he wa.s graduated, and I think tt has . .been sung at each. Commencement since.\ In regard to his• writing:s M:r. L.ittle wrote: \'The sheets were sent to :his p·rinter with harodly an erasure or ·a correction.\ H·e said further: \He

6 'fHE CONCORDIENSlS W!a:s genia.l and generous:, but had no. sense of 'n~:cu:n anJ tuum.' He did not hes,itate to appro- priate .anyone's clothes, y·et he would ha.ve will- ingly loaned hi·s own c1iothes, but he never haJ: a.ny to loan. He was. mod·est, yet self~confident and with h:is bu·oyant tetm:perament and· br:illiant wit n1n.de ma.rly friends and, I th.inh:, no. enem,ie.s-.\ This gives· us a very good idea o.f the man a.s he appeared to his fellows a.nd of hi·s remarkab:le genius .a.nd wit. The for:l·owing is an. ex-aet copy of tbe song .a.s it appears .on the original in Ludlow'!s hand wr,iting: \Un-ion College Bong written· to be .sung· at the Co1nmencen1ent of My ·Clas.s, 1856. ·Aiir, \Spn and Bright.\ \Let the Grecian J.ream of his sacred· s.tream, And sing ~of the $;IJ.ZB;., adorning That Ph.oebus weaves from his laurel leaves, At t:he golden ga:tes O·f morning; But the brook that bounds th·rough Union's grO·UUd'S Gleam,s bright .a,s the· Delphic wate-r, And a priz·e as. fair as a god may wear Is a 'dip' from tOur Alma Mater. Chorus- Then here's to thHe, th..e hr:ave ·and fr·e·e, Old Union smHing o'er us; And ior many a day a_:s, thy walls grow gray, M.a.y they ring with thy child·ren's. chorus.

THE CONCOROIENSIS 7 ROCHESTER, 7; UNION, 3. On Tl1.ursday ·afternoon Roch'8ster de·fe.ated Union on the· coampus: by the· score of 7 to 3. ~He the batti·n..g honors were al:mos:t even, R1ochester's men were fa.r superior in the fiehl, their infi:eld being very go•o,EJ.. Roeheslter started things right a.way, geHing two runs ht the first, while Union wa.s· ·shut out in th.a.t inning. Roches:ter cou1 d ~lo nothing in the seeond. La- due led off fo,r Union in that inning, w-as· advanced by King, ·and slid home on. Slha.w's bunt. In the thjrd and fourth, neither sicl·e scrored .. Uni·on -was teu1por.a.rily \in the air\ in the. :fi~th, when R·o·ehes.t'er, with three hits anLl' several e·r- r·ors, got five runs. Union ea.me back in their half, hovvever, when, after Sha.w wa.s· o.u.t, Dunn hit safely, Mackey follow€td, and both ca1ne home 0'1 Perry'•s single. Stewart was s.ent int~o th 1 e box fo·r Dunn -in the six'i:h, and, alth.ough hit fre:quently, with g,oood :fi.eld- ing and stead·y w·ork at critical points, he pre- vented f•1rther scoring. Harringt•on was perfectly cool throughout t!l.G g·ame, a.n<l Roche:Ster baeked' hin~ up· w·ell. A regr-€tta.ble incident .of the game occurre;d in the se!(~ond inn.ing, when Grant was sliding tQ fi.rst ou a bullt. Cass·idy was recei-ving the throw, and· wa.s spil~ed just b·e1o-w the kne·e.

At the first half of tl1e inter-class -crack meet held lalSt Tuesda.y, the Fresllm•an and Sopho- m·ores came off with equal honors, each clas·s win- ning· twenty points.

W!hile the batting honors were al:mosrt even, R1oche.ster's men were fa.r supe-r-ior in the fielJ, their infield being ve-ry g:ood.

VOL. XXXII. UNION COLLEGE, MAY 22, 1909 SUB-FRESHMAN DAY. MOVING UP DAY EXERCISES. ELEVEN SCHOOLS PARTICI·PATED. By chapel tin1e. last Saturday morning many prospective fr:eH'hinen had already reacJ..ed here and were given a good glimpse of colle~e life here at the Moving Up Exercises.. Before the ex- ercises began t'he members of tte Faculty were invited to be witnesses) a proceeding new on the part .of the students but one very satisfa·cto.r:y to all. After short speeches by Prexy and the Dean, the Seniors took up the regular order of events and an interesting program was carried out, ending at 10 o'clock with Prexy pajnting the nose of the I·dol. In chapel the five :members of the Terrace Council w·ere chosen and ini:iated, after w'hi-ch the fa·mHi,ar .song, \Alouette was sung, including the names of all the SeniDrs. The Terrace Council consists of th.e following men: T. B. Bergan, S. M. Ca vert, H. K. Hutchens, A. C. Potter and W. Ferguson. After the c.hapel exer·cises were completed all marched to the Idol, w'hicn was given i:s annual coat -of white, s-ig·nifying that 3.11 'ho·stile rel,atio.ns between the two under-classes were abanJoned. A very pleasant half-.hour was spent here, each class cheering and all singing the old songs. With a little game of leap-frog the crowd adjourn- ed to the oval to witness the morning events of the inter-scholastic meet. In this 1neet there were elev-en different schools entered and very good records were made in most of the events. The remainin:g events of the meet were run off in the afternoon. T'he meet was won by_ Sc.hene<?ta~y High S·chool with 38 1-3 points, while Troy High Sc'hool came second with 27 2.-3. The 1arg:e cup, given by t:1e college to the school, which won the meet two years out of three, was therefore won by Sche- nectady High School. The cup, giv·en by the \Star\ for tne Relay Race, was won by Troy High School. Next year the college will present another cu!p, but the ·terms ·on: whi·ch it is 'to be won, have not yet been stated.

The track meet was over about f o'clock and then the crowd went to witness the baseball gam·e with Hobart, which resulted in a vi·ctory for UJJion, the score being 6-·5. THE GAME. Union, 6; Hobart,. 5. Before the largest -crowd of the season, Union defeated Hobart Saturday in an eleven-inning game. It was by far t'he most. exciting and th·e he·st game that 'has been played on the campus this year. Each team started off rather loosely, btrt soon settled down, and played such steady- ball that it . was necessary to prolong the gam€ to eleven innings. The pitching was very good. Stewart, for Union, allowed but five hits, walked four men, and struck out fifteen. Wood, who was in the box for Hobart, allowed five 'hits., gave three bases on balls, and struck out slxteen. This is remarkable in view of the fact that Wood had pitched another eleven inning game against Hamilton the day be for e. Bohart started out we1l. In the first inning, Wo@ d and l3 1 arm.ore walked) Blair anJ Houg.·hton sin._gled, three runs resulting. B'\~r Union, Davern hit safely, Bergan and King :rea.·ched :first on errors; Dave.rn and Bergan -cross- ing: the plate. Score-Hobart, 3; Union, :2. H~ bart increase-d their lead in the second, ,get- ting two more runs on a 'base on balls, a safe hit and an error by Perry. 'S'haw walked in Union's h·alf and crossed the plate. Score-Union,. 3; Hobart, 5. Neither side S:cored thereafter until the :fift1l, when_ Union got two runs. Mackey mad:e a two- bag-~ger, Davern hit safely, Perry reached :first, Be1gan made a hit_. and King got on base on a fielder's choice. Ma.ckey tried to stretch his hit into a t'hree-bagge, and was caug·ht at t'ilird, but Davern and P.erry s·cored. I T·ne game then continued without further scol'· ing, until the e ~. \venth \vhen .Stewart walked. Bunts by Shaw allJ Ma·ckey filled th·e bases, and Davern brought Stewart 'homt on the squeeze ·play. na:vern and Bergan did t'he best battlng, eac-h .getting two hits.

A large bon-fire was lit, several shor. but interes:ting speec'hes were made and e1en President Ric-hmond awarded tile cup a!.1d medal to the winnin.g scl1ool and individuals. Then everyone went to Lilliman Hall where a pleasant hour was sp,ent as guests of the Y. M. C. A. The musical clubs rendEred a few selec- tions and light refreshments were served. The entire day was a de.ci'd·ed success· as well fina11-cially as· in other ways. Tile different event~ were run off especially well and the entertain- ment of t'h·e men was very satisfactory. T~is day, when these High S.chool students were the guests of the ~college and enjoyed the many privi- leges coming from such a relation, undoubtedly did the college a vast amount of good and will be the means of influencing many men to become sntdents at Old Union. Elme-r W.allace K. Mould 'has been chosen by the Faculty as valedi,ctorian of the .class of 1909. T'his l;lonor has come to Mould as a result of hard work and great credit is due him. or the appearance of an honorary chancellor or the prm;ninence of the Ron. Joseph H. c:ll:oafe would ordinarily be sufficient to make the event a mast notable one, but this,. year both \Vill occu1 and in ccnju.nction with them th.B largest gather- ing of alumni is expected. Union College has at present the largest Fresh- lnen elass in i:s history and one of the largest Senior ·classes of later years will be graduated. i.n die a tions show t:1at next year's entering class will be even larger than the one which entered .last fall. A new $100,000 engineering building is nearing con1pletion and plans for the erection of a new gyn1nasiun1 are already well unde.r way. By means of the Press Club the college is bet- ter lznown throu~hout the country than it has been for n1any years and throug·h th.is same medit~m the ah:mni have been drawn closer to- gether. It is the corti.bination of all these things that will make this year's Commencement an epocl1. Former President Andrew V. V.

I.Jast :Sa turda:v \'\as \' held the annual Sub- Su,lJ- F,re8htnan Rresh1nan Day, this year Day. being entirely under the supervision of the colleg·e. 'fhe entire day proved to hP a 1narked sureess in rve·ry w·ay, and it is certain that as the years c~o1ue, this day \Vi ll be one to he looked for-trard to and also to he re1nen1hered after it is past, he- cause of the pleasures attending it and also because of the benefit \vhich it brings to thP college. This plan of bringing the different schools into friendly athletic contests, and that on our o\vn ran1pns, is an exrPllent 1net.hod of 1naking our rol- lPge kno,vn in those srhools and of bring- ing 1nen to this college in preference to son1-e othe-r. It is one of thP hPst things under·taken by the college for a long thne and \Ve are sure its ns·efulness \vill increase. In a 1-..eeent issue of \Les- lie's 'Veekly\ there appeared an H az,in.g. article entitled, \The Ciood and Harn1 of Hazing,\ which in every respect presented a cor- rect view of the 1natter. The harm con- sists, as stated in the article, in \broken heads and 1naimed bodies,'' and which is sufficient to taboo this very co1nm·on prac- tire of hazing in c~ollege. But there is a vast a1nount of g·ood resulting fro1n this very sa1ne practice. That does. not mean that hazing, in which physical injuries are received, is countenanced, but it 1night he called that hazing in \T·hich jar.s to self-existence are sustainefl. The arti- cle, in speaking of the 1nan who goes to eollege, says: \He has gotten a false start in life, in that the personal p1~onoun h1ocks too 1nany of his brain paths. One of the best things that can happen to such a hoy in a college or boarding-school ex- pPri.ence, a little hazing included.\ It ~ays that ''the seeond-year lad believes it his dutv to seek out those \vho have t/ \s heads,\ and to rectify that con- dition at once, and it is the best thing· that can happen to the possessor of the \lte-ads !'\ Right here it e1nphasizes the idea that \unlicensed brutality ~nn the part of thoughtless, half- baked 'cubs'' is not to be tolerated for a 1noment, and also that a great tunount of the responsibility rfss upon the college president and profes- s~ci~s in this 1natt~er. '\P .ar•e of the opinion thnt thPrP is a great deal of truth anrl <·<nn1non sPnsP in the artirle.
