The first football ga.ne of the year resulted in a tie Saturday on the Campus. Our op:p():n:Ants were the Amherst \Aggies a very worthy op~ ponents they were, greatly outweigt.Jng our team. The college is represented by a very fast ~team this year, and it deserves thfl strongest lcin:J ~f support. The new men played well, Fairaarin's work at quarterback being very good. VVi th \Bumble\ Brown back on the line, the te~rn win dcu btless play a better game. The grea te\!' 19art of Union's gains were made by Shutler, St-ecwart and Captain Hequembourg, while Roberts was A:nherst's star _player. For the most part 1Jnif1n played straight football, the forward pass lr~ing attempted but once, and that unsuc-cessfnllv. Am- tl.erst played a kicking game, bPing forced tc 11unt continually. The Game-First Half. Stewart kicked off for Union, and the ba.11 was returned a short distance. Amherst wa~ then forced to punt. Fairbairn received the ball, aDd made a long run. Union then lost the ~an on ClC'wns, but Amherst did no better, Roberts ::~:.gain punting. Union did b~tter this time, Shut1eT re- peatedly gaining around right end, until tll.e fiye- yard line was reachPd. There Amherst r,t}gained the ball, and im:nediately punted. Union again advanced the ball by straight football and seemed about to score when the whistle blew. Second Half. Tlh e second half opened with Miller at ri~'ht e't).d in place of Irish. Roberts kicked off to Heq_1lRm.- bourg, who carried ~he b;tll to the thirty-yard line. Shutler went around ri~ht end again and. again for large gains, until the one-yard Hne w:u; reached. Amhert fought hard but \Heckie!W' 11t\lc1e the touchdown. .Shutler then kicked the goal, making the score six to nothing in Union's favc~1·. Smith had already replaced \Hank\ SteV''11't, who was ·compelled to drop out, his knee 'being ,~:renched. Kriegsman took St.utler's place at left halfback, and Riley was substituted at qtnrtP-rb':lck for Fairbairn. Dunbar and Kittson were glven chances at either end, and later Atkin ,..ep 1 act~d Micks. Thus, with six new men playing, A:nllerst had an advantage in the latter part of thi£ hvlf. Roberts kicked off over the goal, and the bnll wgs given to. Union on the twenty-five yard line. Here a forward pass was attempted but failed, giving Amherst tile ball. Union fougt..t hard, but Anl- herst's weight told, though their gains werfl b:Jre- l:y sufficient to retain possession of tte b:1.ll. After making a touchdown, they tied the score bv kick- ing the goal Smith kicked off to Amherst, w'ho made a larg-e gain on a fake punt. They then carried thf' bali to Union's five-yard line, and it iR probable that they would have crossed the goal had n0t the whistle blown. Although Amherst had the advantage at the close of the gamA, sti11 the honors see:n to be Union's when one considers that they had pos- session of the ball almost all the first h <:tlf, Am- t~erst not once making down during th:1t U1~1e. Amlherst showed a superiority in ki<>king and punting; while Union surpassed in defence vrn,..,r especially secondary defence. There is no drn1ht that Union would have been victorious coulil ~~e have retained the regular players throughout tJ.e game. The line-up follows: Amherst. Union.

Hequembourg was called upon to speak for the football team. He ~xpressed gratification for tile excellent s'howing of the eleven in Saturday's game against Amherst Aggies, but criticised the lr .. ck of spirit shown by the students in not hav- ing more men out for the daily practice .. He also called attention to the fact that the local papers' reports are not what they should be and suggested that some plan for getting accurate and com- plete accounts of future games be formulated. Potter, '10 took the floor and explained the ex- isiting conditions in regard to getting reports of college events in t'he local papers and said that tile Press Club had done its best to adjust these matters but without result.

The artistic ~r possibilities of the spot first appealed to Dr. Thomas Macauly, Professor of Mathem3.tics from 1811 to 1822, who began the work wt.ich \\vas taken up in 1831 by Professor Isaac W. Jackson. For forty-five years or until his death ln 1877, the \Garden\ was Dr. Jackson's special care and pride, and became one of the noteworthy places of interest on the \HilL\ During the later years of his life, he spent most of his time when aw~y fro1n the classroom, in the quiet of ttJ~ retreat, and, when he died, his funeral services were held in the \Garden\ beneath the spreading brqnches of the ''Old Nott Elm,' where in life he had so of- shrubbery and blooming flowers, and take their places beneath the old tree, while on the grassy banks close by sit groups of relatives and friends. At t:hese exercises a certain ch.arm ancl inspfra· tion is present, which is seldom experienced at similar gatherings, and is due not so :nuc'h t.o the words that are spoken, as in a large meas- ure to the enchanting effects of the sylvan scenery. I PRESS CLUB, Committee Appointed. The Press Club's first meeting was held last Wednesday. Although there was a good attend- ance the men present were chiefly from the three upper classes. The freshmen did not turn out aR well as was expected. Faust and A. C. Potter spoke on the accomplishments of the club last year and its prospects for tl:e coming year. The only business transacted was the ap11oint- ment of committees as follows: Bulletin Committe~-Trumbull, '12; J. H. Pot- ter, '12, Butler, '12. Post Carjs-Bates, '12, Case, '12.

Unusual interest is being manifested over the fall track prospects. A nevice and an inter-class meet will be held this fall, beside the cross-coun· try run with Hamilton on October 30. The run this year will be 'held in this city. Four .men from each college will participate in the meet, and ac· cording to the method of scoring, the first one to fililish wins eight points; the second, seven, and so on to the last who wins but one point. The run which· was held at Hamilton last yea.r was a tie, but this year t'be prospects are much brighter, and Union hopes for an easy victory. A large cross-country squad is practicing daily, and frequently competitive runs._ are held. The fellows who are trying for the team are: Coward, La Barron, Westcott, Fishley, Slade, Rogers, Streever, Randerson, Scott, Wallace, Travis, Ru· precht, Bentley, Braman, Davis, Daly, Vedder, Gardner and Kim'berly. The novice meet which is run off is a handicap meet and equal chances are given to all.

With the opening of the schools ana coueges the National Rifle Association of America from tts offices in Washington, D. C., has begu!I a.•t ucn ve campaig;n: to organize rifle clubs in institutions of learning throughout the country. During the 11ast year it has been the recipient of several tro-p'b ies for stud·ent competition which during the wintf\r will be put in competition: Circular letters have been addressed to all col- leges and universities urging the organization ..... f rifle clubs ·so as to be in ··position to train and select teams later for the infer-'collegiate matches. The practice of these eollege clups, when no range is available in the institi1tiori, -is; in most cases being carried on at the local National Guard range where facilities are· always gladly offered. In some cases the rifles also- are loaned to t'he col· lege riflemen. Although rifle shooting is a nPW departure of college sport it is neverthelflss grow· ing in. popularity as is shown by tbe fact that sevente@n colleges now have actiYf\ and flouri<3h· ing clubs.

Cocks, Union, '98, now pastor of the Church of Sea and Land in New York city, will speak. Mr. Cocks, who is a member of the Kap!)a AJpha fraternity and was in the Union deleg~tion at Northneld last July, is already well known to . many of the fellows and a fine meeting is ex- pected. W,hile at ·Nort'hfi.eld Mr. Cocks was the leading spirit in the delegation, not only in religious mat- ters ·but also in the athletic affairs and in prepar- ing for the Fourth of July celebration. Mr. Cocks, who will take as his subject, \Problems of the City,\ is well qualified to speak on this theme, having had extensive exJ.)erience in slum work in New York city while pastor of the Church of Sea and Land. At the Sunday afternoon vespers, Rev. B. W. R. Tayler, rector of St. George's church in this city, will speak. At the vesper service last Sunday Dr. Hoffman. gave an unusually interesting talk on the celebra- tion held at Geneva last summer to com:tnemo- rate the 400th anniversary of the birth of John Calvin, and the 350t'h anniversary of the founding of the University of Geneva. In his talk Dr. Hoff:;nari. described what he saw and heard while present at the conference as the representative 01 Union College. He said that in his opinion it was the greatest celebration ever held, for there at Geneva assembled delegates from all parts of the world, including Asia and Africa, to do honor to tbe memory of a man w!ho was not only a great religious teacher but, alsofi a person who was very influential in civilizing the world and in bet- tering humanity. One of the principal features of this celebrn- tion was the laying of the cornerstone of ·the Reformation Monument. This monument when completed will be about as long as North College Lane. On it are to be placed four pedestals on which will stand statues of Calvin, Beze, Farel and John Knox, four of the great reformer~. Be- low f'n:ese will .be smaller statues rbpresent!ng :rnen fro~n all ·countries who were in:tluential in propogating the movement. Anong these will be statue of Roger WiUiarns, the found~r of Rhode Island, who will represent on the monument the person that more than any other, furthered the movement in America. · The talk was unusually interesting and 1t rs hoped t~:aat t'he students will have another op- portunity to hear more about this unique -cele- bration held in Geneva. FIRST CAMPUS MEETING OF THE YEAR. The first campus meeting af the year was hl?ld on Friday night before the Amherst \AggiP-s'\ game. In spite of the coolness of the evening a. large representation o[ men bundled up in sweat- ers and overcoats and tl1rned out to the nleet- ing. Considerable enthusiasm was aroused nmong the students as they listened to the speak- ers and each fellow determined in his heart thHt he- would be present on t'he following day to sup- port the team in every way possible. President Richmond, the first speaker, spoke on the prospects of the coming game in a hlliD- orous manner and said that he expected that all members of the team would ~ome out to the field like Kentucky thoroughbreds, full of spirit, and that every student should be out to support them. Dr. :McComber, who rame next, encouraged the students to stand by the team, and said that in- asmuch as each me\nber of tte team was the best person in college for the position, no knoC'k- ing should be allowed on the field. \Bill\ Murray, who for almost the first time, addressed the students, had nothing ·to say ab0ut the coming game. He merely expressed his heart- felt thanks at the kind treatment he t.as received during his stay at the college, and encouraged the fellows to get out in the air, and take nart in football or some other form of manly, healthful athletics. \Johnny\ Bennett, as usual ~reatly pleased tbe students with his humorous speech'.

Both societies have already held meetings and plans have been tq,tked over for the Allison-Foote debate, and for t;l:e triangular debate whic'h will probably be arrangad soon. A committee of three men, one prof(\ssor fro·u each college, has been appointed to attend to the inter-collegiate debatin~ between the thrPe col- leges. If present plans mature. a triangular de- ~_ate will be held during the latter part of tl,e v;inter. This will mean that each colleg-e is to prepare two tea.:ns, one to debate on the affirma- tive side of the question and the other on the negative. Each college will kee-p one tPam at ho 2n·2, and one will go to one of the other C'Ol- l€ges, thus makin~ two deb::tt~s for each college on the same night. This will increase the oppor·· t11nity for making the team as it will be neces- sf!ry to have eight men.

The second gam:e of the season was played h.ere Sat11rday with the strong Worcester Poly- technic eleven, and ended in Union's· defeat by the s.core of six to nothing. As the score indi- cates, the game was very close and hard-fought, although the chances favored Worcestar, mcstly due to tbeir heavy line, and to the splendid work of the full-back, Powers. Most of Union's gains cam·e about through the forward pass. Fair- bairn's end runs, and Captain Hequambourg's forty-yard run at the kick-off of the second half were very gra~ifying to the spectators. The Game--First Half. Worcester chose the south goal. Brown kick~d off for Union. The Worcester runner had cov- ered about fifteen yards when Sellnow tackled .. him. Worcester then began th·eir continuous hammering of Union's left line, and gained five yards. Failing to gain by hitting th~ rigtt .side, they were fo-rced to punt. \Heckie\ receiV't}d tt e ball, and returned it ten yards. · Micks th~n went through the line for two successive gains·, but Union was doubtful of the rasult of the third down, and co-nsequently Shutler punted to Wor- cester's fifteen-ya.rd line. By repeate.dly at- tacking the left side of Union's line, Worcester mfJ,d~ their downs twice. Shutler was then in- ju,red, but after five minutes ·resumed playing. Through continuous line bucks the ball was placed on Union's thirty-yard line. Worcester then attempted a forward pass around Union's right end, but the ball went out ·of bounds, im- posing a fifteen yards penalty on Worcester. They punted to Shutler, who returned the ball ten yards. Shutler and Hequembourg each gained on end runs. Shutler made a forward pass to· \Heckie\ for a gain of tw·enty yards. Micks th•en went through the line for a slight advance. Another play, in the shape of a for- ward pass, Fairbairn to Heckie, succeeded, in netting five more yar-ds, thus bringing the ball to Worcester'.s thirty-yard line. Here it was lost on downs, and Worcester returned the ball ten yards. Again they attempted the forward I pass, and again failed, the quarter-back neglect- ing to run five yards out before passing the ball. For this, they were penaliz-ed fifteen yards but, notwithstanding their penalties, they once m9re trie-d a forward pa.ss. The end failed to catch the ball, and they again lost fifteen yards. On their fifteen-yard line they punted. Fairbairn ran the ball back a s·hort distance. Fairbairn then ran around Worcester's left end for ten yards, was tackled, and lost the ball. Shutler was on the job, however, and securing it, gain_ed five yards more. After Shutler and Hequem- - . ' bourg had made m.aterial gains, \Bumble.\ Brown was d-rawn back for a place-kick, but the ball went slightly to the left of the· posts, thus giv- ing Wbreester the ball on. their·, twenty-five-yard line. For some tim-e they gained s·teadily on line bucks, but ·were finally forced to punt. An- derson blocked the ball, and was downed on Un- ion's fif•teen-yard line. Shutler havi'ng gain~d around the end, Union punted, and WOrcester ba_,Q. just returned the ball, ·when th~ wb,is.tle ·ble:w ..

Worcester took the ball ·and, by long plunges through the line, recovered about .thirty yards. Atkin was s-ent in to take Vedder's place at cen- ter. Worcester was then for.ced 1 tO ··purit, or try a forward pass. They chose the latter; but Fair- bairn managed to receive the ball on the pass, and was tackled on Union's twenty-live-yard line. Smith immediately ·punted, thu~ bringing the ball into play a't the center of the field. Sellnow was then taken out, to be replaced by Mann. After ' making a gain through th·e line,' W!orcester once more attempted the forward pass i~ ·w~ich they .. . showed very little skill throughout the game. O'Connell broke through the line and blocked the tall, with the result that Wforcester retained pos- session of the ball wtth a small loss. They were forced to punt, Smith getting the ball on Union's t.b irty-yard line. S.mith in turn made a long punt Union sho·wed up ve.ry well on open work, for- ward pass-es, and end runs; and it is alm·ost cer- tain that Wiorcester would have been defeated had it not been ·for the s_plendid work of Power, their fullback. The line was as follows: Vedder, Atkin Ce-nter O'Connell, Honk, Trapp iRght Guard Houk, O'Connell Left Guard Right Tackle Sherman Gillette Frissell Clough Sellnow, Mann Brown Left Tackle Gleason Miner, Irish Rig.h t End WRtring (Capt.) - .

Smith then at- tem·pted a forward pass, but fa-iled, his throw be- ing too short. At this point of the ga.me, Shutler was changed to quarter-back, ·while Dewey fille:l \Hap:py's\ place at left half. Irish was also sub- stituted for Mliller. A punt by Smith failed, ow- ing to \iVlorGe.ster's line breaking through and blocking. lVIIann got th:e ball on Union's fifteen- yard line. Through a misunderstan-ding, there was no ·one to receive Shutler's forward pass, and the ball went to Wlorcester. By hard bucking they barely 1nade a: touchdown. Cloug'h followed this by kicking the goal. S·core, W. P. I., 6; Union, 0. Brown kicked off to Wlorcester.

D., Consulting Engineer of General Electric Company; Professor of Electrical Engi,neering, Union University; Past President A. I. E. E. This book i.s edited by Joseph Le Roy Hayden, who is Dr. Steinmetz's first assistant and who deserves a special amount of commenda- tion for .his labors, and is published by Robson & Adee, Schenectady, N. Y. Already over three thousand copies have. been. sold and the third edition has been put on sale. The price is $2:00 per copy, The book itself has been gotten out in a very neat and artistic manner and shows a great deal of expense and labor. ity of brown cloth Itis bound in a good qual- with · gold ·stamping. On the inside cover and first page of the end sheet-···1s a very neat. design; there is ·a· picture of the Col- lege Library on the inside of the cover and on the first page of the end sheet is an excellent repro- duction of the Idol. Beneath these two pictures colored. There hav-e been four thousand of them made and they were colored by· a \'lady in the firm of Woodbury and Hunt, Concord, N. H. 'l'he text is printed upon a good quality of paper and is in a very clear and distinct· type and style. This book has been purchased by the leading men all over the U. S. and has been sent to nearly all of the foreign countries of the globe. It has been in great demand fro~ the time of its pub- lication in June 1909. It contains 284 pages with 48 illustrative diagrams. The .following is a brief general surv.ey of the book: This book contains a series of lectures delivered ·by Professor Oh.arles Proteus Steinmetz, under the auspices of Union University, in the winter of 1907-8, to a class of younger engineers, consisting mainly of college graduates. The subjects were treated in such a sim:ple and intelligible manner~ that when editing the lectures, it -was found possi- ble to avoid the use o,f mathematics altogether,. and so make the lectures equally avaHable to that large class of engineers who do not care fot~ mathematics or are not familiar wi•th them, with- out in any way decre1sing their value for the college trained engineer. The lectures. give a broad review of the entire are the words \Union University.\ The word field of electrical power generation, transmission. University was purposely used because of the fact that in fo.:reign countries, where many copies of this book have been sent, tte word \College\ does not command much attention, while the word \University\ does. These two pages were aesf!?;n- . ed especially_ for this book by Wlalter Reagles, who is the expert designer of all the G. E. work of thi8 nature. In the back are two pages with the same ·design upon them. distribution, control and use, showing the close relation and dependence upon e'lch other of all the factors of the problem. The first lecture contains a discussion of gen- eral fe-atures: the fields of application of direct and al·ternating current, the question of fre- quency, the different uses of electrical power and their effects on. the choice of the system, etc. Opposite the title page is a photogravure of direct current and secondary alternating current Steinmetz. The p,hoto, from which this was made, was taken at the s·pecial request of the present officers of the A. I. E. E. by the son of Rudolf Eickemeyer, the first man for whom Stein;n0tz worked after he came to the United States.

The following criticism of the book'. appeared in the Mining and Scientific Press for August 28, 1909:- \ Any utterance by the wizard electrician of Schenectady must command world.:wide atte·n- . . tion. Mr. Steinmetz was well named Proteus; he has rapidly taken every part in the shifting play of electrical progress. Like all great men, he dis- plays the characteristic of extreme simplicity, which is the same as saying that his view is s·traight and clear, so that his account of what he •' sees is lucid, plain, direct and logical. H is a delight to read these lectures. Criticism is super- fluous in connectiOJ;l with a book by a past-master of an art. Errors, and ·personal convictions there ' tt ~ -~. may be, but the suggestiveness of the volume is the reason for reading it; the dull practical de- t::tils can be had in a hundred books, but the pregnant hints come only from such as this. \ \ I The following is the opinion of Frank N. Water- man, Mechanical and Electrical Engineer, in re- gard to the work: \In this book an addition has been :nade to the literature of electrical engineering which will be welcomed not only by students and young engi- peers, to wh·om it is, perhaps, particularly ad- dressed, but by all connected ·witth or interested in electrical engineering work, because it admirably fills the. long felt want for a re:iable descriptive work, connecting toge·ther theory and practice, relating to the distribution of electricity for light and pow,er purr:oses. Tha groatest value of the book, to the avera.?;e student or engineer, will, perhaps, be found in the purely des·criptive or non-mathematical treatment JUST ACROSS FROM GREEN GATE FINK'S PHARMACY THE COLLEGE SMOKE AND,DRUG SHOP ~:. ·,\

12 ~rHE C-ONCORDIENSTS of such subjects as high voltage disturbances in transmission lines and high frequency tions,. ·whic1h ·puts 'Witlhin easy grasp the ple.s of su bject:s ordinarily so buried in oscill.a- princi- mathe- matics as to ·be inaccessible to the enginee·r, whose time is limited, or the reader whose lack of mruth- ematical training or pr-actice makes the process of re.adi.ng impossible. The simplieity of treat- ment of these subjects is unique, and such chap- ters in particular cannot but be of great interest to all readers. There are probably few students of eleotrical engineering who are not ·acquainted with Dr. Steinmetz's valuable little book, \Theoretical Elements of Eleetrioal Engineering.\ In t:he rela- tion it bears to this older book, the new work might aptly have been called \Praotical Elements of Electrical Engineering,\ and, supplementing the study of theoretical principles, as it does, with a clear S'tatement of how they are ap·plied, it can- not but prove most helpful, alike to students and practicing engineers. It is obvious that any ·work treating such a sub- ject is informing and v-aluable or m.isleading and harmful according to the breadth of experience, the accuracy of observation and the balance or judgment of Hs author. It is a matter of con- gratulation to all interested, therefore, that this most needed work is giyen to engineering litera- ture by one so peculiarly qualified in all of these resrects as is Dr. Steinmetz.

At the regular meeting of the Press Club, last W'ednes.day evening several imp.~rtant matters, aside from the usual routine business, were brought up and discussed. The 'he·ads -of the several com·mittees reported progress in :the general booming work and many suggestions for increas~ ing the scope of the organization were m.ade and favorably acte-d .upon. A number of the upperclassmen spoke at length upon the work of the Press Club in gen- eral and expressed opinions that will aid mater- ially in getting results. A better .showing was made by the freshman class at this meeting and much interest is manifested by all the members. A very complete and systematic outline for the year's work has been mapped out by the executive committee and a most successful season is antici- pated. The appointing of a Photngr~ph committee in addition to the other committees is a ne·w venture that is more or less of an experiment, but great results are anticipated. The work of this com- mittee will be to get snapshots of several plays of the football games on the campus and h.a ve them developed a.nd printed upon postcards or other- wise and place these on sale immediately after the games. The pictures will not be confined mere- ly to football games, but track events, etc., will be tre1ted in the sa~1e ID·::tnner. Case has been rlaced at the head of the committee that wi11 have this work in charge and, as he has had no little e:qer ience in photogra·p.by, this work could not have been better assigned. It is ex1:ected that a University calendar will be gotten out by the Press Club and other plans for establishing an income for the organization are being considered. The outlook for the Club was never brighter and if funds are forthcoming and there i.s no interruption of plans the work of the organization will be unlimited and the re- sults of consistent work will be in the future, as in the past, seen by not only the undergraduates but by many of the alumni, who have the welfare of Union at he.ar•t.

14 THE COXC'ORDIEN~l,S COLLEGE MEEl'ING, OCT. 11, 1909. Monday's college :n.eeting was agaiR prefa{'ed by remarks from President Richmond, but this time they did not announce a holiday. He stated that the Japanese Trade Commission, which is touri11g the United States would be ~nests of tt.._e college in the afternoon and that a special foot- ball game had been arranged between tb~ Va r- sity and t:he scrub as entertainment for the ror- L ign guests. He urged that the studen.t oouy at- tend the game and give the J aps an ide~- nf the Union spirit. The ~eeting was formally openPd by Presid~nt Cavert, after singing Alma Mater. t11e background are ~engraved- tt_._e words \Terrace Council,\ and on tae base of the \Idol the num- erals of the class. The eoundl decided that they should begin at once to agitate the matt€r of getting praeti!2ally the entire student body to accom])any the foot- ball team to tllle Halllilton game on November 13. It was also decided to initiate at Union, the custom frequent in other eolle.ges, of liaving a student parade downto-wn after victories in im- portant football games in order to show the peo- ple in the city that the fellows on the ''hill\ are wide-awake. The president reported t:hat the Terrace Conn- Hequembourg spoke for the eleven. He eo'D- cil had had 500 copies of the honor system print- mended the students upon the spirit shown in ed for distribution among- tl1e students. the yelling and singing and expressed th~ opinion of the entire tea:n that the Worcest~r elPven was the most gentlemanly and sportsmanlik:B team t'bat we have played against in some tilne. T. D. Walser spoke briefly upon the honor system. Hutchens cricitised the students for knocking and said in short that if the fellows had nofting good to say not to say anything. Bergan took the chair at this point anfl Cavert made announcements for Y. M. C. A. Grover spoke on the Intercollegiate Union meeting recently 'held in Utica. Faust made Glee Club announcPn1ents, after which tt..e meeting -was ad.iourned. 1'ERRACE COUNCIL MEET!NG. Several Important Matters Discussed A meeting of th_e Terrace Council \\,..as he lrl Wednesday afternoon; at which H. H. C-roYer was elected secretary of the body for the ~on1ing year. A design for a watch fob to be th~ pel'H'1anent insignia of membership in the council was sub mitted by Newman & Company, and adopted as the permanent em.blPm of the body. Tb e fo\\l is to be of sterling silver, having 'in the foreground q most excellent representa:tion of the \IdoL'' Cln The president brought up for discussion the matter of putting in the trophy room the foot- balls and baseballs of the garnes that Union wins, with -Dhe game, th€ date and th~ score printed upon it. It was unaniroously decided that this plan ought to be adopted at Union. N. Y. S. I. A.. U. MEETING. No decision as to the award of the baseball pennant was made at the meeting of th~ board of the New York State Intercollegi::tte \t' Jetic Union held at Utica last Saturday. AI~ though Rochester and Colgate head t'he list, owing to charges of .. pro{essionalism made against them, they are liable to lose the pen rant through disqualification. The charges hav0 heen turned over to the standing committee whi-J', has charge of that matter. A report to the board will be made at its next meeting in March, 1910 In case Rochester and Colgate. are disqualified, Union, whi-ch stands third on the list, wil! re· ceive the pennant. Prof. M. E. King and H. H. Grover, '10, were the Union College representa- tiyos. Pennants for basketball and track were award- ed, Rochester winning the former and C .ilgctte the latter. At the me€ting next March th~ foot- ball- pennant for the season of 1909 wiE be awarded. \ k I I

The 'F\res:t~men were scored upon twice in their second half, by a fluke touchdown and a place:nent . goal. Although both teams were defeated, the games 0-·ere c'lean and gentlemanly throughout, and the Albanian sp€ctators were shown that the Union underdassmen excelled in courtesy and game- ness, if not in football science.

After a noisy trol1ey ride and a cross-ocuntry walk, the tean1s reached the Ridge- field grounds at 2 o'clock. It was decided to \sandwich\ the halves, the Sophomores ].)laying first. The twelve hastily collected Sophs must have been dismayed at the size of the High School R[!nad, for in the next twenty minutes the Albany players rolled up a score of twenty-one!

Although noth!:lib' cr2rtnite can be given out as to the personnel of the team, it is probable that Travis and Coward of last year's team will run. Rogers of the Freshmen will un· donbtedly run. Wallace, '13, has been showing up well and should make a good roan. There are also several other men who have been worktng per ~istently so that there will be plenty or gooct material from which to chose. Track prospects in general are €xcellent. There is a large amount of good material in the Fresh· man class. With Wallace and Rogers in the dis· tance runs and Rose and Klein in the weights, in addition to the men in the other classes, the track pennant s'hould come to Union next year.

Free transportation will be given the Albany depart- Inents, who will arrive in this city about 10 o'·clock in the n1orning. At 11 o'clock there will be addresses in the college chapel by Dr. Rir'il- rnond as chancellor of the University; Dean Smalley of Syracuse University; Ron. Simon W. Rosendale, president o.f t'he Board of Governors of the University; Dr. Samuel B. Ward, dean of tion into a University. But little need prob::tbly be said about the be- gir..ning of Union College itself. Every student should already know of its past history,-of tbe awtives which inspired the old Dutch burghers of Dorp to desire for their city an institution of higher learning; that it was incorporated by t!1e Regents of the University of the State of New ~, ork on February 25, 1795, thus making it the second oldest colleye in the State, and the first north of New York rity and west of the Hudson, and fi.nally that it received its name from the cir- cumstance tbat several religious denomjn 'tious co-operated in its organization, making it the first college in th€ United States not strictly denom- inational. Although Union College acquired by its charter full un: versity privileges, the creation of grad u- ate institltU(}ns at Schenectady was not found 1~racticable. Such institutions, however, soon were found€d at Albany and in 1873, during tne adn1inistrati0n of Dr. Potter, these schools were

At that time there were but three departments at Al- bany-the Medical College, the Law Seho0l .and Dudley Observatory. It was not until 1881 that the College of Phar1nacy was founded and lil ~de a part of the University. Dr. Alden March, a gradt~ate of the Brown Medi- cal School, who settled in Albany in 1820 v.ras the moving spirit in the founding of; the Medical' Col- lege. As early as 1821, he began a course oif lec- tures, which were attended by many of the young practitioners of Albany, and continued wifh this fork for :nany years. In 1831, Dr. James H. Armsby, one of Dr. March's most earne sr. co- taborers, carne to Albany, and these two meu soon bent their energies toward establislling in their city an institution where young men. could receive instruction along medical lines. 111 1838 several meetings were field at which the Tnends of the project took active steps to-:-;arcrs ()rgan- ization and on Jannar 3, 1839, the first co1tlrse of public lectures by the Albany Medical ·Colleg·e vvas begun with a class of fifty-seven stucle:nts. =--~ 4c:::oy ... _,_ 4 _,q.,. -Schenectady's Kreatest drug store College Fellows W·e Want You to Know Quinn's- It's the leading drug store of Schenectady-a place where the hest is offc:red at all times.

This school, which is famous in the annals of An1eri(;an edu- catio .. , is the fourth oldest ·law school in the United States, being antedated only by 1Iarvard, Yale and Cincinnati. The immediate impulse that resulteCI in th0 establishment of Dudley Observator:v is -supposed tr: have been received from a course of fi.strouo:n- ical lectures delivered in Albany by Prof. Orms- bv :vritchell, then in charge of the Cincinnati Oo- servat ory.. Large contributions were in1r:nediately raised for tb.e new enterprise. The larg:es t donor to the original institution was Mrs. Blandina Dud· ley, in honor of the memory of whose bnsband the institution was named. The ne~t largest single contri-butor was Thomas w·. Olortt, an AI- ized in 1851, and io the following year was incor- rorated by the Leg-islature. However, the task of J:,roviding buildings and necessary equipment pro- cfeded slowly and it was not until several years later t'hat active astronomical work could be begun.

It was then decided that a better plan than the one :vreviously proposed would be to establish a De- partn1ent of Pharmacy under Union University. This idea was carried out and on June 21, 1881, the Albany Colles·e of Phar::nacv was founded to fr:rm the pharmacy department of Union Univer- sity, thus giving to the University the last of the present departments. By the combination of t11P~ ::> several departments the enrollment of ULJ.ion Uni- versity reaches nearly 8 00 students.

Ashford, Conn., the native town of Dr. Eliphalet Nott, for sixty-two years Union's president, is to espe-cially honor his memory at its two hundredth anniversary next year. The -general facts of Dr. Nott's adn1inistration are famHiar to all Union College students, but few realize the long years of hard work he spent in building up this C'ollege tl:e Hobart game. He said that the team came tintil it was recognized as the equal of Harvard \SKE-DADDLE TO HAMILTON.\ back fro1n Geneva downhearted and discouraged and that the best team dM not win the game. He also urged the students to cheer on tl1e team and that a good scrnb be out working hard every day. He made the announcement that 'cStub\ Potter is to be here this week to help coach the team. Leon, '1 0, announced a song and cheer prac- tice Wednesday and Thursday on the west bl.eac::ers and especially uq:ted the Freshmen to be present. President Cavert said that 300 studeats from the Albany departments are expected next Sat- urday. They are going to have a band and the whole University will par3de tbe streets. He urged all to come out for the campus meeting Friday ni<sbt. Ferguson, '1 0, asked for a short song practice during college meeting. Faust, '11, led fh.e sing- ing.

Added to his farsightedness was a Rtrong perEonality that commanded the resp~ct of every man who knew him and was one of the fActors of his great success in the classroo·m. In recog·nition of Dr. Nott's valuable services to the college, it is probable t'hat Unioi! will be repre- !?fmted at the anniversary bv one or more mem- l.ers of the faculty. ATHLETICS AT R P. J.

UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 27, 1909 No.6 UNIVE:RSITY DAY CELEBHATED IN CHAPEL. alumni, who have gone out from our varicus schools, and instead of a vague interest in bnt Degree Conferred on 'Dean S;malley. The University Day celebration last Saturday was tlie occasion for one of the largest and most notable gatherings that has e-ver ·been 'hela in the college chapel. The affair was a great success from every standpoint and it is felt that ~t will have important effects in the later life of the University by binding the different departn1ents n1ore closely together. .Shortly before 11 o'clock five special cars, which were run directly to tl:ie \Blue Gate\ brought from Albany over t'hree hundred students besides tbe faculties and trustees of all the departments. Thev were immediately escorted to the chapel, where, as the guests of t'he ·~o1Jr-ge they were given fhe seats of honor. At 11 o'clock the exercises were be~un with the chapel well filled and its seating capacity taxed as never before. A.fter the singing of \A1nerica prayer was offered by Dr. A. Russell Stevenson, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church. Then in a bappy and hopeful vein Pre~i­ {lent Richmond welcomed the Albanv viqitors in beh·alf of the college and of the University-. Aft0r his welcoming remarks be said in part· \To-day we realize more than ever that this is one institution. We should 'be proud of thP fact fhat Union is one of the most ancient a.nd honor- able institutions in the land; it is tenth in order of founding in the country, a11d the second in :\Jew 'York State. A gre~t university in this part of the State will be the neeil of the future and Un i0n University holds the- key- to the situation. Stimula- tion of interest, larg·eness of vision and s01id'lrity of purpose will bind the University ·closer to- gether. \If we who are here have this .spirit of union, i1 will soon spread itself to our fine body of one department, there will grow up among them a sentiment of loyalty and gratitude toward thei1 old educational ho,me from which they have re- ceived thetr noblest impulses and the finest in- spirations. Union University will then be to t'hen1 a real Alma Mater and they will cherish hr~r toward his motherhrdl wnhrdl wnhrdlu strdlu with all the loyalty that a true son boars toward his mother.\ At the conclusion of his remarks Dr. Rjchmond regretfully announced that the Hon. Simon W. .ttosendale, Presid€nt of the Board of Governors of the college, was unable to be present a.nct take part in the exercises. f'he program was then continued by a sel('C- Uon by the Glee Club and a solo by Ferguson, '1 0 The Glee Club gave a medley of \As Tiley Bound the Laurel,\ \Come Now to the Campus\ and \Sons of Old Union.\ Dr. Samuel B. Ward, Dean of the Albany lVfedi- cal College, then spoke. Dr. Ward expressed great enthusiasm over the plans for the unification of the University, and then spoke to some flxtent on the ~onditions governing the preliminary educR- tion needed by a 'Person planning to enter the m ~die al profess·ion. Mr. George Lawyer, one of the professors in the llbany Law School, was the next speaker. In OI:ening his address he said: \Any mov0ment tending to bring the departments of the l}nivflr- sity iTtto closer and more friendly relations will have !he unqualified and earnest support of every student and member of t'he faculty of t.h~ Law School.' After a solo by B. C. Race of th·e Albany Law o·chool, Dr. Lewis Boss, director of the Dudley Observatory, was introduced as the re:presflntative of that department. Dr. Boss, in closing, said: \SKE-DADDLE TO HAMILTON.\ j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j j ·' ,, ,:j : 'i :·j '> I. ;l :j j j

1·, ' '1 ). ·'I, ::1 .. 6 THE O:ONCORDIENSIS \We may feel sure that the influence of our new chancellor will always be exerted ill the right direction, to the ·cure of any evils that rnay exist and that may be capable of improvement. In this, and in all of his efforts to improve the character and standing of Union University, he is entitled to our loyalty, co-opt\;ration and firm support.\ Dr. Willis G. Tucker, in speaking in behalf of the College of Pharmacy, said: \I hope that this department will always re- member its parentage, and sincerely respect it, and give in the future as 'in the past, its hearty and loyal support.\ Then, after a solo by R. C. Whitney, '13, oc- curred the most interesting feature of the pro- gram, the conferring of t'he degree of Doctor of Laws on Frank Smalley, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts of Syracuse University. Dean Sm=tl- ley was voted a degree last June, but owing to the fa·ct that he was unable to be present at the Commencement exercises, the degree was con- ferre·d at this time. Dean Ripton presented Dean Smalley for the degree and Dr. Richmond, after conferring it, or- dered that his name be enrolled as an honorarv alumnus of t'he college. Dean Smalley was then introduced and made tl).e principal address of the morning. In thanking the college for the honor, before delivering his address, he said: \I am -delighted t0 be an honorary alumnus of Union ·College, and I promise to do my best as an alumnus of the college which has been so kinif as to confer this degree. \I am especially glad because it is expres<:;ive of the good feeling that exists between Union and Syra·cuse, and also on aecount of the antiqnitv of t'his grand old institution.\ Then, in delivering his regular addres~ fie said in part: \That industrial training will more and more find a place 'in the school work is not for a mo· ment to be doubted. And more than that, it is our duty to provide a place for it. Yet some of the school men are firmly convinced that it is their attitude. Mr. A. M. !Scripture writes: 'It is not the aim of education to produce artisans or profes-sional men; it should be its aim to turn out men Wiflro can be in telligeut with regard to the problems of living, and .solve them with independ- ence of spirit. Edu·cation should be practical, aestheti-c .and cultural, all the aspects being de- veloped to make for efficiency.' \That is finely stated and witb most of it we can fully agree, but the first sentenee betrays an attitude :toward industrial training that voices the sentiment of many teachers, :but which will change as time goes on and investigation and ex- perience justify the new teac'hing. A still more bitter attack by another writer, Dr. Squires, is. the following satire condensed i:nto almost snite- iul senten·ces: 'lVIodern educati.o:n mal{es not for culture but for grub. Greek and Latin and the humanities have been superseded by practical studies. The pedagogy of to-day is soft, making small demand upon the pupil.. He must h::tve everything vis·ualized so that he need think less; the kindergarten must be taken up in the l:..igh school. This is a kodak pedogog·y, nicklette peda- gogy, a gas-tank :pedagogy, a mongoloid peda- gogy.' On the other hand, Corunissioner Draper has shown conclusively from English and Ger- man practice and €XJ)erien·ce that a place must be made in the school system for studies of this character and the future will see them estab- lished more and more in America. \An incidentaL plea may be entered just r1.ere for the classics. A conservative college man, re· joice :t'hough lle may and does at the splendid de- velopment of other subjects in the currieuhllll, as the sciences for example, and though he appre- ciates the unquestioned value of such subjects from a pedagogi·cal standpoint in a scheme of education, still justly maintains that forn1er sub- jects of standard character and of proved effi- ciency are in no wise thereby- invalid'ated-that tt1.ey are needed as much as ever. A member of a college faculty once exclaimed in horror to bis ,colleagues that any student could enter t'hat arts all wrong and that such subjects havEl no place in college and take a degree without knowing any- a school syste1n. A quotation or two will show thing whatever about physics. Whereupon the \SKE-DADDLE TO HAMIL TON.\

But, as \Prexy\ said, it was no defeat to be as'fu.a;ned of; and, since every man did his best, :it was almost as good as a victory; not only \Prexy but also the entire student body is proud of the team, and probably few persons who saw tbe game doubted that Union had th8 better tea1n. Witt.L th.e team working as it did Saturday, it . ------ faeulty hastily remedied that defect and very r;roperly. But no one pointed out that a student eould enter and graduate from that college with· out ever having heard that there was such a coun~ trY as Greece or such a nation as Rome, (vigor· 0 us applause by Ashey) and without the slightest intimation that the high 'civilization which was theirs constitutes a very considerable part of our own. And yet that is just what a student can do in any of our colleges. What a pity t'hat the hori- zon of that student is not wi-dened, as it might well 1)e, and his intelligence enlightened ·by the 'i.i hould take every remaining game. It would be useless to mention anyone's playing, ,·eq ui rement that is now lacking! \·Tb.e decadence of classical study in our schools and colleges cannot be justified by reason or ex- perience. The best testimony establishes its su- periority in a scheme of education.\ At the conclusion of tl'1e ceremonies the stu· dents were eseorted to the various fraternity !louses for lun·cheon, while Dr. Riehmond invitf'C1 the members of the Albany faculties and trustees 'and the hon1eless of the college faculty' to lunch for the whole tea:::n played well. Union's ends showed great improvement, and the line held bet- ter than ever .before this year. Rochest~r played c;;t good ga.me on the offensive, but were clearlY weak on the defensive. Early in the game, the l\nion backs found that Rochester's left line was weak, and, bY continual haminering, made .c~on~ist­ eJtt gains through it. Tt1e forward pass was u-secl frequently, successfully on the right side of the line, ·and unsuccessfully on the left. The onsidq kick worked well. \Hank\ Stewart's injury in the first part of the game greatlY i:nproved Roches· at the President's house. After 1ur-cheon at 2:15 o'clock, the studPnts from all of the departments assembled on the \Terrace where they formed in line for a stu- dent parade, preparatory to the football game with Rochester. Four abreast they marched through the \Blue Gate,\ down Union Street, across Wall to State and up State to Nott Terrace, where they crossed over and returned to the ·Cam- -pus. The parade was aceon1panied by two bands and was undoubtedly tbe biggest student parade E.~ver seen in the city. Complimentary tickets for the football game were given to the visitors at .Silliman H~all and they all attended the game, assisting the eol1ege students to a great extent in the cheering and sing1ng. FOOTBALL. Rochester, 6; Union, 3. ter's chances of victory. Rochester ·came on the field first, and r:;~n through some light practice, under the su11ervis- ion of Coacil Glaze. TlJ.eir squad ·was eig·hteen strong. Soon after, \Bill\ Murray led the Union squad upon the field amid the greatest cheering that the campus has heard in years. Union chose the south goal, and at the blowing of the whistle, Stewart kicked off. Rochester re· turned the ball a good distance. Failing to cover the required distance on downs, tt1ey punt~d to s:hutler. The forward pass was tben tried, bnt failed, because the ball was caught by Rochester. After gains around the ends, Rnchester tried 8n onside kick, but Dewey got the ball for Union. S'hntler and Stewat't made large gains, but the ball was lost on a fumble. Rochester thPn ;nade g~Jns also. They made a clever play around Union's 1eft end, which Dewey broke up bY a fine tackle. Rochester tried a run around tlie other end, fum- bled and recovered the ball. On a line buck, Stewart broke throug'h, and tackled the runner: but was injured, resun1ing play, however. Rather than lose the ball.,on downs, Rochester tried a place kick from the twenty-five yard line. T'he Though cheered on by the shouts o~ fu1lv se-ven hundred students of Union University, the ·V~tr-sity football team suffered its third defeat of the sPa- \SKE-DADDLE TO HAMILTON.\

R L T'I\iE C()XCOI-llJIEXSIS kick failed, giving Union the baH on the twenty- . five yard line. \Heckie\ then tore through t'!:t~ line for a gain of ten yards. On a fake rig:bt end run ,Shutler :nade a long forward p·ass to Houc>k, whi-ch he caught, but dr()pped. At this point of t'he game, J. Stewart took Houck'P p1ace and Smith was substituted for H. Stewart, whose knee was injured. After a gain around the end, Roches- ter made a forward pass, but the quarterback did not run five yards before the pass, for which they had to give the ball to Union. Hequernbourg tl.1en made two fine p11Jnges for seven and five yards, respectively. Smith went through .for four more, while \Heckie\ again gained seven yards through t'he line. Shutler then gained nine yards aronnd end on a fake forward pass. Upon the failure of ''- forward pass, Union was penalized :fifte~n yards, which was regained when \He.ckie\ m 'ide fifte(~n yards around Rochester's right end. Brown thPn made a long drop-kick which brought the brrll to Rochester's twenty-yard line. Rocl1ester then gained sever a] times. On an end. run, lVIiller n1ade n fine tackle which brought t'be students to th~ir feet. Rochester tried an onside kick but SJP~tler got the ball on a fum.ble. Six yards were gained around right end by Shutler. Brown th0n ki -:ked to the Rochester quarterback, whose fnmble gava t11e ball to \Heckie.\ With the ball on RochesteJ·'s forty-five-yard line, Rochester was penalized fif- During the intermission a monster block U was formed. 'The students sang and ·che~red for sotn.e time, barely reaching the bleachers whPn the teams ·came on the field. Rochester ki·cked off to \He·ckie\ who was tackled on Union's fifteen-yard line. Brown im~ mediately kicked to Rochester. With remarkable interference th.e runner passed the whole Union team with the exception of .Shutler, who was play- ing back and would undoubtedly have made a touchdown had 'he not be tackled by Shutlflr 0n Union's fifteen-yard line. On three downs Rochester eould gain only four yards, which fact shows the great defensive work of the Garnet team. Union thus recovered the hall on h~r one- Jard line and immediately Brown kicked, giving the ball to Rochester on the thirtv-yard Une. . Atkin was sent into the game to replace J. StPw- art. On a fumble Vedder got the ball. Bro·wn again kicked. Smit'h got the ball and c3rriPd it hventy ya:rds. The referee, however, rlaimed that 'the Rochester man had signalled for a free r·atch and had been interfered with, thus giving Smith the b~ll. For this, he ilnposed upon Union a heav:v . penalty, bringing the ball to Union's twenty-yard line. Nowllere in the game did t'he Garnet eleven fight harder or play better than at this no in t; but by steady plunging, Rochester barely gnined the goal in six downs. The goal was kiC'ked, IT13k- teen yards. Brown then 1nade a drop kiP-k w~1ich ing the score Rochester, 6: Union 3. passed straight between the posts, making the s~ore Union, 3; Hochester, 0. Rochester kicked off to Dewey. ''Hrcki~'' n!ad3 his usual gain. Brown then kicked to the tb~rt~·­ five-yard line, where Miller tackled Joy the mo- ment he received thP ball. Rochester lost sevPn yards on slow work and the next play cost them two yards more, owing to a poor pa~s. They then punted out of bounds. It being Union's ball a forward pass was attempted, but failed, the ball going to Rochester. ·On an end rnn l\Ii1ler made another fine tackle, getting the runned for a loss. Union recovered the ball a 1noment later 0n a fumble. Brown made a punt to Roct.estAr's forty-yard line where the ball was in plav wh~n the whistle blew. Brown kicked off to Rochester'R twenty-five- yard line. Rochester then attempted a pnnt which was blocked by Sellnow, Union e·etting the ball. After slight gains by S1nit'h and \Heckie Brown tried a d!·op-kick, which failed to go be- tween the posts. Ro·chester then kicked from their twenty-five- yard line and on a fumble, got the ball in the middle of the field. Rochester fumbled in tllrn and gave Union the ·ball. Rochester having again se-cured the ball on a forward pass, tried to punt, but 0' Connell blocked it and fell upon the ball. A forward pass, Shutler to Hequembourg, worked well.

Last week Tuesday afternoon, George Cl11tP, who has for over thirty years !leen superintendent of the college grounds, fell from. a stepladder while hanging shades in the electrical engineer- ing laboratory. I-Ie was tmind un-conscious on the floor and was ta1{.en to the Ellis Hospital wherP he died on t'he following afternoon. In the death of Mr. Clute the college feels that it has lost one of its best friends and most loyal supporters. When a young man, he began work- ing about the college grounds and sir1ce that time he has performed his daily task':! in a manner which has won for him not only the honor and re- spect of the students and faculty, but of our \Vbole body of alumni as well. In a n1eeting of the student body to tg,ke some action to fittingly express their sorrow at his death, it was decided that each class should send flowers to his funeral.

The Association plans to give several of them during the year for the ].)urpose of making its work of a natm~e that will appeal to the students and to get then1 to realize the true position of the Y. M. C. A. in college life. The reeeption Saturday will be in honor of Dr. Alexander, who, for over a year,. was acting- Chan- cellor of our University. Dr. Alexander is a man . who has won 'honor and fame for his Alma 1VIater tt: many ways during the past years, especially while he was ~resident, at which time he did n1any good and helpful things for Old Union. He has always been a loyal supporter of thA college, and his interest is shown by the fact that he is coming here for t'he express purpose of being once more with the boys. So it is the dutv, as well as the privilege of each man in college, to show bis appreciation of this man's work by bP.ing present at the reception. At that time, refreRhment~ wHI be served and an opportunity will be afforded 2.J1 of talking personally wah Dr. Alexander, and in that way will many a one gain an inspiration ti.1at will 'help him. more and more to love his Alma Mater. Anot'her \University D1y\ has UNIVERSITY passed and with its passing has DA V come afresh to many the realiut- tion that Union University- is in- deed a University of which any of its undergraJn· ates or Alumni may well be proud. The celebra- tion of University Day this year was one that will long be remem·bered by all, both be·cause of the true, loyal spirit that was shown and because of the greater feeling whjch it aroused for a far greater degree of solidarity and unity among the different departn1ents. We feel that our college has indeed started out with renewed vigor upon a great era of prosperity and we are certah1 that, with the interest that is shown by all for the -welfare of the University, it will be of far greater influence in the educational world in the futHre years that it :has been in the past.

Y. M. C. A. SECURES TWO NOTED SPEAKERS. Rev. George Alexander, D. D., of New York and Dr. Vander Veer to Speak. The Christian Association 'has succeeded in securing two noted speakers for the vesper serv- ices on October 31 and :'-Jovember 7. On the first of these dates Rev. George Alexander, D. D., pas- tor of the Presbyterian Church at University F:lace will be the speaker. Dr. Alexander is one of the most noted of Union's living Alumni, and should be held in high respect .by all Union men. During the interval between the resignation of Pres. Raymond and the calling of Dr. Ric'hmond, Dr. Alexander was the acting head of the University, and Union's growth during these two years was Ia.rgely due to his earnest efforts. He is ·corning from •New York for the sole purpose of once more being with the students and of speaking to them next winter and latter part of the fall, four classes in Bible study will be held, one for eaeh class. Dr. Hoffman is to take c'barge of the senior class and 1 'Prexy\ Richmond will lead the class for the freshmen. At the vesper service last Sunday, Dr. Conant, one of Union's old graduates, addressed the meetM ing taking as his subject, \Elements of Manhood.\ The three chief elements that he considered were-religion, manly deportment and scholar- ship.

.. , ' I ' ,1,, ' 14 THE CONCORDIENSIS PRESS CLUB. Efficient advertising is a strong c.omponent with any college and although scarcely a year old one of Unton's youngest organizations bids fair to become one of her strongest augments in pros- verity. To-day the Union College Pr~ss Club fs an organization after which other colleges are modeling similar advertising mediums. So far this year a large amount of work has been done. However, plans are at present under ·contempla- tion for asRuming a still greater amount of worl{ and increas.\ng various fields. To fully a ccomplis'h its purposes more 1nen are needed to facilitate a greater range and cap3.city for accomplinhing plans which have been adnptPd for the ·co ... ning college year. Now a word in re- gard to how the Press Club works; directly after a game or any other form of intercollegiate com- petition the wire ·committee telegraphs the \A~­ sociated Prefls\ full partieulars. By this means Union news is distributed broadcast over the country, directly after an important event ~1as taken place. This form of distributing news is, in the opinion :cof the club, -inadequate to meet the needs of t'he college. Every week therefore bnlle- tjns are sent out to nearly a hundred of the most important dailies in the ·country. There is also another committee which plays an importa~t part in the advertising done by the Press Club i. e., the advance news committee. It is this commit· tee which sends photograph publications and papers such as for instance appeared last year in \'Leslie's Weekly.\ There is a number of other co1nmittees all of which are busily at work. It might be well to Inention t'he sub-freshn1an committee which is at present eng-aged in writing prospective sub-frosh; the post -card committee which sends postals to the Alumni with college notes printed thereon; the -calendar committee; the poster committee and the photographic post card committee. At the meeting last Wednesday evening reports from these various committees were read. The post card committee reported sending out post cards to the Alumni with notices of University Day on them. The advance work committee re- ported having sent photographs to \Leslie's Week- ly.\ The ·calendar ·committee reported having made investigations concerning picture ·calendars. Should the demand warrant it th.e club will pub- lish a picture calendar to sell for about one dol- lar apiece. The wire committee and bulletin com- mittee reported having sent out telegrams and bulletins and the photo post card committee re- ported having sold a large number of post cards. They have pictures of the Hobart game and also pi·ctures taken during University Day. At the close of the meeting Dr. Barnes congrat- ulated the club on its success so far this season and said that he thought although it was not offi· cial, the Press Club would soon be given a room of its own in which the :files of the club could be kept and its business transacted. Any men desiring to join the club should report at 7:30 p. m. on Wednesday evening at Silliman Hall. COLLEGE MEETING, OCT. ~5, 1909. President Richn1ond said a few words before tte opening of the meeting, thanking the students for their spirit and conduct at last Saturday's game. The game, he said, was a :fine exhibition from every standpoint and he said. that the stn- dent body had the right kind of sporHng blood. He E~nded by telling us how proud he was to be Presi- dent of such a college where such enthusiasm pre- vailed. After singing Alma Mater the meeting was formally opened by President Ca-vert. Hutchens called for a long clieer for Prexy, Reeky and Shutler. Shutler responded and thanked the students,. for the entire tea1n, upon the spirit s'hown in the cheering and singing at last Saturday's game. Dennis read the resolutions drawn up on ac- count of the death of George ·Clut€, whirh reso- lutions were adopted.

The following was clipped from a paper in one There is an easier way than a loud voice and a giant megaphone to inject a person.al touch to a contest on the gridiron and thus make the game far more a-ttractive and popular than it is now, writes Herbert in the New York Tribune. A year ago I made a ·strong plea that the players should be numbered, as is the eas-e at athletic games and bicycle races. For some reas-on hard to explain there appears to be an aversion to doing this, and in all prob-a- bility ·this paragraph will be scoffed at. The fact remains bhat there is a crying need of pro- perly identifying the players in a sport which hold·s such a~ high place in -popul-ar esteem. There is so much close formation work, and the play- ers are dressed so much alike that even those who know the men personally find it difficult to rec- ognize them on the field. Coy wore a white bandage around his head in the Princeton game and thereby e,arned the good will of all newspaper men, for the reason that he could ·be followed in every play. Men with some distinguishing mark like a heavy pad, a bandage or possibly red ·hair, get credit for doing more than rnen who are deserving perhaps of greater consid- eration, for the reas.on that they can be identified readily. This w-orks a -hardship ofte-ntimes tl1at could be easily avoided. The football rules com- mittee would do well to give this question some consideration at its next meeting·. of our nearby cities:- Here is a pretty good one with just enough truth in it to be worth laughing at: A Chinese scholar, asked to render an educational report on a certain An1erican co11ege, wrote to Pekin: \They t.~.ave an athletic club here which they call a \Uni- versity.'

It is probable that within a few weeks a -wire- less station will be established at the University of Pennsylvania and communication will be opened with three otlher colleges-Columbia, Cornell and Princeton.
