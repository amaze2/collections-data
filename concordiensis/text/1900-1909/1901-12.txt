The Con_cordicll• sis VoL. XXV. UNION COLLEGE, DECEMBER 12, 1901. No. 9. TRANSPORTATION. Interesting Lecture Given by George H. Daniels. The second lecture of the year was given on Friday afternoon at 3 :30 in the chapel to a large and appreciative audience by Mr. George H .. Daniels,. General Passenger Agent of the New York Central Railroad. The large number of undergraduates present was an encouraging sign. The lecture was most interesting and instructing, and one with which the lecturer was thoroughly familiar. The speaker was introduced by President Raymond, who said that the two principal factors in the development of the Empire state have been Union College and the New York Central Railroad. Mr. Daniels then spoke in- formally: '\My talk this afternoon for the few minutes which yod have been kind enongh to afford me will be largely infon11al, and so I will make no attempt at a finished lecture. This is the :first time that I have ever addressed a college, and I feel somewhat diffident, although you would not expect diffidence in a general passenger agent. \Transportation is absolutely necess~ry to commerce and the most enlightened and prosperous nations are those which have the best methods of transportation. Some obsolete methods were fully as important in their day as the railroads are now. I was born in the west and have spent many years there and I -learned to respect the patient, hard working burro, which is the only possible means in some sections, of transportation to and from the rich mines. And yet if they were to be adopted as the means by which students traveled. to Union College, the class would graduate before any of the members had arrived. \In Siberia, sledges dr~wn by hardy little horses, from 30 to 200 of them in ~· e.aravan, have been the means of transportation. But the Trans-Siberian 1·ailway, 6,ooo miles long, will supercede them as I 2 cars can cary as much as 200 sledes and in less tin1e. \ To illush·ate the magnitude of rail way systems, the New York Central operates on its lines 10,453 1-niles of road. It en1ploys 90,000 nlen ; its gross earnings this year will be $r so,- ooo,ooo; it will have carried 1 ro,ooo,ooo tons of freight and 6o,ooo,ooo passengers ; and paid in 1900 $54,ooo,ooo to its employes over $414,ooo,ooo to its stockholders, $5,6zs,ooo in taxes. For every $roo of capital, it paid $18.58 to the etnployes, $5 to the stockholders and $2.05 to the state. \All industries .are dependent upon railroads; the fanner to carry his wheat, the merchant to bring him the goods which he must sell; the public to travel from place to place. In the west the school and church followed the rail- road and the materials were carried free by the railroads. Thus they are the forerunners of civilization and prosperity. \When we wanted to publish a map of China not long ago there was none obtainable that was satisfactory. In conjunction with the governments of Germany, Japan, France and the United States, and by the aid of our friend, vV u Ting Fang, we were at last able to prepare one that, we believe, is the most accurate and cotnplete ever produced. In its preparation we found that in. the interior of China there is a city of over a rnillion inhabitants, of which not so tnuch as the name had ever before been printed. There are three cities, whose population num- bers three millions, entirely unknown before. Two of them are on the opposite sides of a river, across which there is not and never has been a bridge, nor is there any ferry connection. \1'he young man who wrote the descriptive part of the publication, has lived in China for 20 years. He went there in childhood and has come to look like a Chinaman. This is merely

6 THE CONCORDTENSIS. an instance of their power of absorption. Armies of western nations have gone into China to conquer it and have been completely absorbed. We expect that the empire will be opened by means of railroads, but this will give some idea of the enonnity of the problem. \ The United States stands at the head of the nations today because of its superior transporta- tion system. The great locomotives made with- in a stone's throw of where I stand go all over the world. The pictures of the Empire State Express, drawn by 999, hang on the walls of the club houses in Cape Town and Johannes- burg alongside of the Dewitt Clinton running its first trip between Schenectady and Albany. The English would not believe in the Etnpire State Express until they saw the biographs in the London concert halls display the pictures of it in tnotion. American locoa1otives have given the whole world faith in American machinery. '' Every train that conveyed guests to the coronation of the Czar was drawn by a:n engine built in America. The Japanese minister of railroads wrote n1e that he hopes soon to have a Japanese Etnpire Express, drawn by a locomo- tive tnade in Schenectady. The greatest Eng- lish railroad sent its highest officials to this country for a month last sutnmer to study American methods of transportation. '' Every one who talks to young tnen gives them some advice, that being very cheap. Everybody advises me about time tables and other matters, and so I am going to give you young tnen a little, taken from the Bible: 'Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.' It it is a little thing, do it as if it were a great; if the position is a stnall one, fill it so that you will be called upon to fill a greater. Tirnes wer~ never better than they are today, when a single individual counts for more than he ever did before. The man who know how and has the will to do things is more im- portant to the world now than ever.\ By a new equaliz~tion of the State tax, the University of Michigan will receive an increase of $r ro,ooo in annual income. \SELECTIONS FQOM WALTBQ P ATEQ.'' ~eviewed by Charles E. Qussell in the Literary Department of New York Journal for Saturday, Dec. 7. \To think clearly, to thick b.eautiful thoughts, to express beautiful thoughts with such faultless precision that each shall he a polished and radi- ating gem, to write with such masterful skill that the phrases shall he an unfolding delight, shall have the married harmony of thought and sound, shall seem like the final expression of sotnething that since time began has been \vait- ing to he said, to be calm, unswayed, judicial, clear-sighted, above all to be the tireless advo- cate and patient servant of beauty. Wherever beauty may be, these were aitns ofWalter Pater's works ; these were the aims that made hitn great. \It is for the sake of these thing that men hang over the least thing he· wrote and lament he wrote no more. ~'As a prose stylist in critical work he seems to a certain fol.lowing incornparable among writers of English, for his strength and his beauty, his wonderful exactness of phrasing, the infinite care and skill of his tnosaics, where the words are like colors wrought into a massive design and yet each by itself full of beauty and light. \No one that cotnes under the spell of this magic ever escapes again. One tnay not accept always his conclusions, as about Wordsworth and Shakespeare sotnetitnes ; even about Rossetti. The thing said may not in its purport be appToved by the individual temperarnent; in its fonn it is irresistable, in its form it could not be better said. \ In trying to detennine why Pater lives and grows and seems to be increasingly sure of a permanent and very high place atnong English classics, this also should not be neglected that with all his restraint, with all his Doric and perfect purity of speech, his constant attitude id of an engaging candor and friendliness, so that tnen shall never feel instructed from a height but addressed leYel-eyed, in the way of in- tellectual dernocracy. i i I ,( i ,, .,

f i• TltE CONCORDIENSIS. '' Hence men feel at once on friendly terms with a teacher at once so able and so little of the pedant. \It seen1s a late day to be saying these things about this man so far beyond praise or blame, but the appearance of a new American: selection frotn his writings, put forth in popular fonn, tnakes it excusable to reflect upon the vitality of work at once so didactic and so enduring and significant. ''We have here in one volume nine of the essays that are so dear to all the ad1nirers of Pater-the 'vVordsworth,' ' The Child in the House,' 'Eupheuistn,' 'Divine Set·vice,' 'Denys 1' Auxerrois,' 'Style,' \T'he Genius of Plato,' ' The Age of Athletic Prizetnen,' 'Notre Dan1e d'Amiens .. ' vVith these are the Preface to 'The Renaissance,' the treatise on Sandro Botticelli and the conclusion fro1n the san1e voltnne. These with an appreci~tive and helpful intro- duction by Professor Edward Everett Hale, Jr., a chronology and bibilography make up a book that should do much to spread the knowledge and love of a man whose works add to the profit of living. \There is, of course, this danger in compil- ing any such volutne of selections from the works of one so fervently admired by a part of the public, that what is ornitted is likely to cause more of regret than what is printed causes of joy. Thus there will be those that will think no volume of Pater cotnplete without the Coleridge, the Rossetti or the Shakespeare essays. Yet it tnust needs be admitted that what is here is typical, representative and in the true n1anner. \ The breadth of the view, the catholicity, the s·wift, sure truth on the nerve of the tnatter, the athletic joy in the reasoning, the cornpulsive force of the 1nassed deductions, the things that denotes Pafer and make hitn the companion of the discerning are shown in these essays as well as in any that could have been chosen. \ ' The Renaissance,' for instance, contains the whole heart of the Pater creed of art, and · the criticistn of art, as in that closing passage, so full of restrained eloquence, where he dwells for a moment on the brevity of life, and then savs: tl \ '·Some spend this interval in listlessness, some in high passions, the wisest, at least ' among the children of the world,' in art and song. For our chance lies in expanding that interval, in getting as many pulsations as possi- ble. into the given time. Great passions may give us this quickened sense of life, ecstacy and sorrow of love, the various forms of enthusiastic activity, disinterested or otherwise, which come naturally to many of us. Only be sure it is passion-that it does yield you this fruit of a quickened, tnultiplied consciousness. Of this wisdom, the poetic passion, the desire of beauty, the love of art for art's sake, has most, for art comes to you professing frankly to give nothing but the highest quality to your motnents as they pass, and simply for those n1on1ents' sake.' ''It was to interpret art, therefore, that he bent his best efforts; to what result may be seen in this volume where of painting in 'Sandro Botticelf\i of poetry in ' Wordsworth,' aGd of architecture in 'Notre Dan1e d' Ami ens' he has said such apt and illl:lminating words as we shall hardly find elsewhere. To bring art and the lesson of art home to many people, to \en- hance its significance so that henceforth they shall not view it with indifference or unin- structed eye-a noble work ! ''It was Pater's life work. He died in his fifty-fifth year, after thirty years of unrentitting labor. The collected volun1es of his writing are few to show for all this labor. But after reading any one of the essays in this volume we can understand why he spent months and some- times years in writing aLd rewriting his papers. It was to fit, polish, perfect so that each might be the exact echo of his thought, and endure as a light.\ H SELEOTIONS :BlROM WALTER PATER.'' Edited wi.th in- troduction and notes by Edward Everett Hale, Jr., Pro- fessor of Rhotoric and Logic in Union College. New York: Henry Holt & Co.

8 THE CONCO·RDIENSIS. LITE~A~Y NOTES. In an article contributed to the December Review of Reviews under the title, \ From Peking to St· Petersburg by Rail,\ Mr. Alfred Stead gives an interesting account of practically the first railway journey across Asia and Europe made by a non-Russian traveler. He describes in sotne detail the new Manchurian connection of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The arti·cle is accotnpanied by a map and photographic views along tbe route. 1\here is also a brief account of the famous Bagdad railway project of the Germans, with map and other illustrations. These two articles in the same magazine serve to e1nphasize the recent rernarkable developments in Asia tic railroad building. The Saturday Evening Post announces two departtnents which will challenge the interest of young r:nen and women throughout the country. \ A Horne College Course,\ as on(} of them is called, has been designed to ·meet the wants of ambitious young people who have not had the advantages of a university training. This course will be conducted by a special faculty, composed of p1·ofessors in the leading colleges. \ To the Young Man Beginning Business\ is the second of the new departments. In it the most successful men in a dozen occupations will write about what helped them to the front in their own business, and give a list of books and magazines bearing upon it. These new depart- ments wi 11 begin early in January. The editors have receied a book entitled, \New Pieces Tl1at Will Take Prizes in Speak- ing Contests\ fron1 the publishers Hinds and Noble, New York city. The book is neatly bound and contains pieces that are absolutely new, containing a1nong others, such articles as, \ President McKinley's Last Address, Delivered at the Pan-American Exposition~\ Alice's Flag from \ Alice of Old Vincennes\ by Maurice Thorn pson, The King of Bayville from \ The Court of Boyville \ by Williatn Allen White. There are forty-eight other selections equally as new and equally as good. The book may safely be recornmended to any one wishing to find a new subject for speaking. The book is cotn- piled by Harriet Blackstone, instructor in the Art of Speaking and Dramatic Art in the Gales- burg High School, Galesburg, Ill.

A previous volume by the same author, \The Bible Veri- fied,\ has gone into a fourth edition, besides hav- ing been translated into Spanibh and Japanese) This new work is in a sitnilar vein, aiming to show that God is not only in the Word but also in the world.

Important epi- sodes and personages, from Jeremiah· to the present, are &eized upon for rapid, vigorous delineation. The volume is a series of snap- shots at the more important events of Christian history. The discourses must have been stimu- lating to their hearers, and will prove helpful to many· readers.
