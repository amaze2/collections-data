---THE> CONCORDIENSIS . UNION COLLEGE, DECEMBER 10, 1~02,. No. 10~ . ROBERT EARL. '• Robert Earl, ex~ Judge of the court of ap- peals, died at his home in Herkimer, N. Y., T4-esday morning, December 2nd, having been il( for over a week froln a 'severe stroke of paralysis. Judge Earl was born in Herkitner, Septem- ber ro, r824. He graduated from Union Col- lege inq 1845 and latter received the degree of L.L. D. from both Union and,Colutnbia. He was admitted to the bar in 1848, was elected county Judge in r855 and served two terms. In :I 869 he was elected to the court of appeals bench, where he re1nained un.ti l co1npelled to retire bee a use of the age limit in 1894. Though a den1ocrat he had received the non1- ination from both parties at the time of his last election. Judge Earl was for a long titne presiding just-\ce of the court of appeals and he is ·universally considered one of the greatest jurists of the last half century. 'l'he career of Robert Earl 'WaS one of dis- tinction :n every respect. Several times he was seriously considered for the notnination of governor on the den1ocratic ticket and had he. been younger would have received the non1~nation. A few years ago he founded the Herkitner Free library by giving his n1agnifi- cent hotne for that purpose. He 'vas .a n1an of great ability, of broad tnind, deep religious convictions and vrith fine literary tastes. He wrote n1any articles of n1uch value and was considered one of the best authorities on the ·.history of the 1\!Iohawk Valley. He a1so wrote hymn·s and poerns of merit. He was a n1an who was an honor to his college and his country. . . ' *'' J L;' ;. . ':' .\ 0 ~. .. • • • ' .,.. • f :· .,1 \ ••. CAMPUS N-OTES . 1.,he question as to whether the city owns absolutely the U. C. I. property has been set- tled. About 18 months ago Union College signed a release of its claims and the city can sell it without having to consult the college or without taking any chances on its reverting to the college if its uses for acade1nic purposes is abandoned. Asst. Treas. Pond has had two lights placed in the lower hallways of the sections of North College for the convenience of the students who room in the dormitories. T'his is done as an experiment and much will depend upon the manner in which the students use this privilege. J\IIr. R. T. 1vicCord, Sec. to the President, is in New York on business.

Ai1othe.r long silence when one of the Eng- lishmen said: \ I guess I'll go and get ready for the ball to-night; it's getting late, you know.\ 'rhis was a hint. Lieutenant Shandon rose ' excused himself, and rode away. ''Well, I'll be-; say, did you .ever see such a blomtning idiot ? \ said one officer. They all agreed that they had not. Lieu ten .. ant Melrose picked up something from ·the chair which Shandon had occupied. It was .a pipe case which that offioer had dropped . Throwing it carelessly on the table, he exclaim- ed : \The l{illarney forgot something, I guess. It's too bad they didn't send us a gentleman; he's not fit for the company of officers.\ There was a mo1nent's silence. :L\{elrose turned around to learn the cause. The Irish- man had come back for his case, and a ino- ment later Melrose lay flat on the piazza.: \Vithout a word Lieutenant Shandon turned on his heel, n1ounted his horse, and rod~ back to the parade grounds. It was several mom- ents before Lieutenant Melrose was able to re- gain his feet, and much to his chagrin he was, obliged to tniss the ball that ni,ght. T'rouble now began for the young Irishman~ He was snubbed by the n1en and slighted by. the ladies. He was invited to the social func- tions as a matter of form, but he always. re-. fused. But if he was disliked by many, there was one who had a secret admiration for him •. It was the daughter of General Sinclair, pro~ visional governor. ,She had watched the. bat .. tery at drill and had admired the easy way in . which he managed his men, as well as the fine appearance he made in the saddle. Helen Sinclair was the belle of Calcutta~ The young subalterns vied with one another -in· doing her favors, but she had eyes for but one man, Lieutenant Shandon of the sixth. Several of the officers noticed this, and sud- denly remembered that a duel was in order for the insult offered Lieutenant Melrose by Lieu- tenant Shandon. 1\his is what they antici- pated. If either participant of the duel wer.e .· .. wounded then the other would be dismissed . from the service. This was a sure way of get-·. ting rid of a man who was winning the heart of the governor's daughter. Lieutenant JVI:elrose was neither a coward nor a bravado, but when the plan was made known to him he insisted upon having a sec I. I I i .· ! ! :

8 THE ·CONCO~DIENS.IS. <?nd. This was _a point not thought of by the ~r.~edy offic~rs. Army regulat·ion:s fix the ·saine punishment for the seconds as for . the principals. This was fixed, however, by the council which decided :that in this affair of . . E'nglish honor no second would be n·eeded, but that one of their number \vould be in ,;eadiness if occasion required. Ne::xt morning Lieutenant Melrose knocked at the door of the Irishman's apartment, a verbal chaUenge on his lips. \C . '' \d . H . orne 1n, sat. · a votce. e entered 111 to . . a plainly furnished room, and saw seated at a bamboo table in the center of the room the obJect ~f his visit. Shandon did not look up at first, giving the Englishman p[enty of time to take in the fittings of the roon1. Ov.er the mantle ·hung an officer·s helmet, a cartridge belt and an army revolver, while suspended from the mantel drapery was a small bronze medal. It excited the visitor's cudosity, and upon examining it he read these words : \Awarded for highest pistol score in British army, to be retained until higher score is made. Record, 497 points.'' And to think that this man had the choice of weapons ! A cold sweat broke out on the Englislunan's brow. He began to assure him.self that be had not been wronged at all. He ·was about ready to believe that Shandon had not touched him on that eventful day, when he was startled by·some one saying in a low, pleasant tone : \Well lieutenant, what is it to-day ? \ He could at first think of no answer, but at last he said in a faltering voice : ''I have come, sir, to beg your pardon for my conduct the day you stopped the runaway gun carriage.\ \Why I have forgotten all abon:t that and I hoped your had. Vv on 't you stay ? No ? \Vell come again when you are not so busy,\ and Shandon slowly opened the door for his visitor. The officers parted, one to find a secluded spot where he could kick himself for trying to challenge the best shot in the British army, the other to go back to h!§ RQ?~P~ The outcome of the affair did not d:is~o!1r.~gJe: the officers in their atten1pt to riq them1:~el~~~ of the new con1rade in arms. A new aiu!t ·eve·n more effectual plan soon presented i;tself. It was the con1ing of 1V1ajor Pierce, a veteran officer of the Indian campaign. . -Certain pe.tty outbreaks among the natives '~ad necessita_te,p_ the maintenance of a company oif mounted men at a place several miles frotn the town. This was known as the .outpost, and.f.t·om here scouts were sent out in all directions to learn .~ 1 • • • the attitude of the natrves. Post spult ·pre- vailed upon l\1ajor Pierce to send ··thither Lieutenant Shandon. * * * : * ~ Now things went on as usual. Dances, din-. ners and boat rides, the English quarter. ever seetned in gala dress. Helen Sinclair .. never looked as charming as now. .And the govern-. or would soon give a great ball in hoi1or ·.of his·· daughter. The few rumors of .In-dian .·.out-·. breaks were laughed at by the gay yo1u1g offi- cers, and thus the season ·went ·on with a con.- .. tinous whirl of social gaiety. At a table in an army tent sat an. officer:ex~ .. amining a map of Calcutta and the.near vicin~ .. ity. 1~his was the outpost. A worried. l.ook catne over the officer's face, as he traced. ·a.n imaginary line around the .English. q:uarter> The fly of the tent was suddenly tln-own open·. an-d a trooper entered, and-saluting, saia: · \Sir. I tnust report that the natives are out·;, .. ~ four men of the Sixth. wer~ murdered . this· morning, and the English quarter is sur- rounded. 'They are not aware that they are surrounded. 1\he orders are to ·wait for the battery ; it will be here in ab6ut t1~re e 'i1otus. The spy we captured said the natives would attack at midnight.\ The lieutenanCs face became ashen and he motioned the trooper to leave. A:-. n10!11.e~1t later Colonel Carter entered and said : ''Lieutenant Shandon, some one in . your -: - !o • 't con1n1and must carry word to the .Engli?h garrison and let then1 know that they are sur~ .. , rounded.

While it is stiU too early to make atiy valuable predictions as to next year's football prospects, a word may be said as tq the conditions at the close of th-is.· season. A series of defeats is not a pleasant retrospect',' yet as President Raymond suggested at a recent chapei meeting there are many brig-ht features.· The loyalty of the student body to the team in spite of constant reverses · and the stick·to-it-ive quaHties of the men on the team are worthy of highest praise. No college need be ashamed of defeat if the conduct of the men in· the games has been consistently manly and distinguished ·by those qualities which go to make up fair sportsmanship. Defeat is the · best of disciplinarians, and the Union College· football team of rgo2 has profited by such instruction • In the selection of Olmsted as Captain for. next year the team has acted wisely. His intense interest· i:n football, and his practical knowledge of the game, has been equalled only by his faithfulness on the gridiron and by. an entire absence of self-seeking. He has wol) this new ·honor fairly and the college can feel sure of the same fidelity in the future that he has manifested in the past. The Long Ago. Oh fair are the flowers that blossom for aye By the banks of those living streams, · And fairer the visions, wafted away A special meeting of the Board of Trustees 'vill be held Thursday, Dec. nth, in New York City, to consider a proposition made by the General Elec- tric Company of this city to aid in the development of our el~ctrical engineering course. vVe are informed authorita- tively that this .proposition includes adequate equipment of th.e laboratory and an annual appropriation for the work of instruction on condition that the college raise a. certain atl1ount ammally for the same purpose.

Am- .tnunition low, food and water scarce, with no chance of ge:tting more. More than this there . ' ' were many women and children in the building alnon,g, whom the suffering was awful. ~t was at this cnsts that the old Spanish pnest.volunteered to go out and speak to the Indians. He had been a friend of the Indians .for years. He taught their children Christian ideas, a.qd at one. time held the respect of the whole tribe. As he stepped out of the door, he raised his hand, and cried to the Utes hiding in the chap- parel, '' \Vhy are my children so angry ? The Gre~t Spirit ·will punish them if they are not good. · ·Go back to .your teppes.\ r or answer a yell of derision came from the lpdians, and the old padre, his crucifix pressed to his lips; plunged forward on his face his body riddled with bullets. Two of the br~vest troopers· dragged the mangled form into the adobe, where the last sad tribute was paid to the one who gave his life trying to save others. Captain Donalson, who was. in. command of the garrison, stared gloomily around the smoke filled roon1, when his eyes fell on a little Indian lad of about fourteen years, who had been found by a trooper wandering out on the prairie alone and half starved. ''There is our ill on1e11, '' said the captain, ''we have had t~e Q:evil 's own·luck eve~ sinc.e w~ bro~ght him . rl •• 1 • As if in answer to these words a burly soldier sei~ed the little fel.low .by the arn1, and, drag- ging him to,,the top of the wall was about to . . . ' ' cast him down, wh~n Captain Donalson's little son \Jock'' .rushed out and begged for the ! ' Indians life.·· \Jock \ was a favorite with th~ · soldiers and his pleadings wer.e heard .. · . The firing had ceased that night and every one prepared for the encl. 1'he Indians. had advanced under cover of the darkness until very near the besieged building. Any moment .. -~ a wild rush might be made and the Indians .. would swarm over the walls. Suddenly, far out in the darkness, can1e the blast of a bugle, followed by a cheer, arui · .' ·.· a few moments later a troop of cavalry thundered up and the Indians fled 111 dis- ·.:' may. \Vhen the garnson was once n1ore at ease \Jock\ Dona.lson was astonished by having· ... the Indian, whose life he had saved, slip a thin bone ring on his finger. He looked for the Indian, but he had vanished in the darkness,. and although he looked through the deserted· . village he found no trace of him, and after a time \Jock\ drifted into the ann y. It was eight or nine years after the episode ·' in southern 'fexas, that \Jock\ Donalson and · twenty other troopers, from the -th cavalry, were standing off a horde of .Apaches. They were occupying a corral of an abandoned cattle ranch on the parched plain of Arizon~. Desperate had been 'the fighting and the soldiers had lost nearly half their nuinber. Crouching behind the low stone fence, they were exposed to the burning rays of a tropical sun for five long days, and many had been driven almost insane by the frightful heat. \. l l\1ajor Young asked for son1e one to volun- teer to try and steal through the enenly's lines at night, and carry word to the fort. ''] ock\ Donalson and his old school friend ''Billy\ ' .~ .,-. Edwards stepped forward. _ , ''Donalson may try, but he knows the risk '' said the ·major; ''he spoke first.\ ' \But I am the lighter, and a horse can carry me faster,\ faltered Edwards. But the tnajor shook his head and Donalson was allowed to go. In the dead of the night an unshod Indian ~. ., 1\ ' ~

12 pony :was ·led' outsid·e. the gate, arid '·~Jock, l)onalson with his dispatches buttoned in his shirt, ro.cle ot.1t into the darkness. For twenty minutes, the soldiers waited breathlessly and were beginning to think the boy had passed the lines in safety when flash after flash '\as seen far .out on the prairie~ lVIen whose eyes had been strangers to tears for a long tin1e, wept that night, for they had seen a young n1an in the p r i 1n e of 1 i fe ride to t1 is death~ ''Jock \ had passed the Indians when Stld- denly he rode straight into a small scouting party. He S\rung his horse to the right, but it \vas too late. .c\.. dozen rifles flashed, and the horse, shot through the heart, stun1bled and fe 11, while its rider, badly wounded, was 1nade prisoner by the Indians. He \vas carried before the chief next n1orn- ing, where he was to know his fate. The chief sat on a blanket \Yith a rifle bullet in his shoulder, a souvenir of yesterday'·s engage- ment, ·when the Indians had atten1pted to stonn the corral. A pipe was sent around the council and each Indian took a long puff; \Vhen it can1e to the chief, he took three puffs, paused and took t\VO 1110re. rl'his was a sign of death, and, arnid the frightful yells of his captors, the prisoner was bound to· a stake \vhich was erected for the occasion. rrhe chief supported by a brave on either side, advanced, knife in hand. 'l'here was a sickening thud and the heart of a true man and a brave soldier \vas rent asunder. As the chief stepped back to view his victim, his eyes fell upon a bone ring, thin from constant wearing, on the dead man's finger. 'Vithout · a word he turned, and, calling his braves together, bade then1 ride a way and leave the white n1en in peace.-. As he rode out on the plains at the head of that Indian band, he did not hear their war chant, for his thoughts were of a little boy· who saved his life 1nany years before in Texas down by the Rio Grande.

In 1nodcrn 'feetball the full back is the 1nurderer of last resort. \Vhen all others have failed in their efforts to tnutilate or kill the runner, it is the duty of the full back to put hin1 hors de con1bat. In stopping a runner the full back should plant hi 1ns e 1 f square 1 y in front of h i 111 and dive through hin1, trying to rnake his head tneet the runner so as to produce both stomachache ac d lumbago. In defense the full back n1ust solve all prob- len1s of direct contact. Beginners should practice breaking legs. Even an amateur will find that by dropping his knee on a pr.ostrate foe and at the san1e ti1ne jerking his leg sharply holding the n1an by the ankle, he can either br.e.ak or dislocate a leg. In attack the full back n1ust do a big share of the line plunging. The be~t full backs have V -shaped heads; capable of penetrating an opponent. Our next lesson wi11 be on the half backs who are not so decollette as their narues in1ply. LESSON V.-THE HALF BACK. 'fhe duties of the half back include homi- cide and suicide. Those unfatniliar with the game n1ay easily recognize the half hack He is the 1nan you cannot see when the ball is down and the last one to be dug out of the mud after a scrin11nage. 'fhe half back has no vital spots, but he can be disabled by a kick directly over the knee. In offence he stands seven yards back of the line in a crouching position, and \Vhen he gets the ball he falls in behind the behemoth dele- ga ted to interfere for h_in1, while another behe- nloth con1es behind him to shove. 1'he next he knows is the behetnoth in front stops and the one behind keeps on telescoping the front

The half back then falls with the ball under his stom.ach, while nineteen men, aU heavier than he is, sit on hinl. rrhe whistle blows and the half back extracts his face from the 55 yard line, which is made of wet white\\·ash. He has gained one yard two and one-half feet. If he keeps up this perfonnance with the same result thirty-one times without getting frayed out, he will score a touchdown, which counts 5 points. Some persons may think this is a waste of energy, but any man with a college education can correct this error of ignorance. Our next lesson will be on the quarter back, whose life is even n1ore strenuous than that of the half. LESSON VI.-THE QUARTER BACK •. The quarter back must be born a disturber and a hater of peace. It is he who starts everything in a feetball game. He must be the accessory before the fact in every case of homicide or mayhem. The quarter back usu- ally is the smallest tnan on the team, and he must be fast. If he is not he will be a corpse. In the game the quarter crawls in under the center rush, speaks a sentence that sounds as an Egyptian obelisk looks, gets the ball from the center, and passes it to the runner. As he does this four opponents, aggregating 837 pounds, light on him fron1 various directions. Meanti1ne other mastodons with cleated shoes tread on hin1.

'l THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XXv'I. UNION COLLEGE, DEOEThfBER 17, 1902. No. 11. UNION'S NEW ERA. Electrical Laboratory Equipn1ent and Salaries Assured. Prof. Steinmetz to Take Chanre of \\' the N evv Department. A 1nost important announcement was n1ade at the fifteenth annual banquet and reunion of the Union College Alumni association of New York, at the Hotel Ivlanhattan, in that city, Thursday ev.ening, Dec. r rth, in the state1nent made by the l~ev. A~ V. V. Ray- mond, D. D., LL. D., the president of Union college and the chancellor of Union ·universi- ty, that the General Electric company had n1ade an offer that assures the con1plete suc- cess of the electrical laboratory of the college and its place at the head of sitniliar institu- tions throughout the world. The state1nent contains several items of the greatest signifi- cance. In the first place, Dr. Raymond stated that the General Electric cornpany has offered ''an im1nediate gift for the ~quipment of our elec- trical laboratory sufficient to tneet present needs and the annual pay1nent for five years of a certain sun1 for salaries, provided the friends of the college contribute another sun1 for the satne purpose.\ It is also declared that 11r. C. P. Stein- tnetz, the special electrical expert of the company, characterized by President Eliot of Harvard as \the foren1ost representative of electrical science in A.merica, and therefore in the world,\ is penn it ted by the con1pany to take the co1nplete oversight of the course of instruction in electricity and that, at the tneet- ing of the board of trustees of Union college, held Thursday afternoon, at which the offer had been discussed and later accepted grate- fully, Mr. Steinmetz had been appointed pro- fessor of electrical engineering in the institu- tion. The banquet was attended by many pro,mi- nent men, and it was a remarkable, as well as a memorable event, in more ways than one. In his address, Dr. Raymond was interrupt- ed many times by the enthusiastic plaudits of his hearers. After a general in traduction, in which refer- ence was made to the men and incidents familiar to all the graduates of the college. President Raymond spoke of the new impetus that had been given to the life of the college by the action of the trustees that afternoon, an impetus in the direction detern1ined by early traditions no less than by present oppor- tunity. He said that: \It has long- been our boast that Unibn was the first among the American colleges to recog- nize the importance of scientific and technical training, while ~n no sense depreciating the . value of that broader education founded upon the study of classics and the hun1anities. '' \Vith prophetic vision, Dr. N ott intro- duced early in the last century a scientific course running parallel for four years with the classical course. For this he received the reward of all prophets, the abuse of his own generation. \Other colleges ·were shocked at the heresy of Union, but as has been so often, the heresy of one age bas become the orthodoxy of the next and today the colleges are few indeed that offer no alternative courses. ''But the energy and enterprise of Dr. N ott did not stop with one innovation. In 1845 he introduced a purely technical course, the course in civil engineering. Tbis, also, in the eyes of others was a scandalous departure from the traditions of the Atnerican college.

6 TI-IE '00NCORDIENSIS. Eut again his prophetic soul did not err, he only anticipated by a quarter of a century or more the demand for technical training which is one of the n1ost pronounced features of modern education. \For nearly sixty years, Union college has been graduating engineers, many of whom have become leaders in the profession; and what is, I think, worthy of note and alto- gether distinctive, these n1en have been re- garded from the first as Union college men, not by sufferapce, but by right. No line of separation has ever been drawn between them and the other sons of our alma mater. As students they shared the common life of the college and as alumni no difference has ever been known. We have not needed the title of university to render their relationship legiti- mate. They have always been recognized as college men on an equal footing with men of classical training, a member of the educated class that Union has given to the nation. \\Vhen not tnany years ago, the public began to appreciate the importance of sani- tary science, a cour,se in sanitary engineering was added in that of civil engineering, and with the still more recent developn1en t of electrical science, a course in electrical engi- neering was insti tn ted. \Eight years ago we began instruction in this departn1en t of applied science under con- ditions which seemed to us peculiarly favorable, because of the presence in Schenectady of 'the principal shops of the General Electric Com- pany. From the beginning the number of students in this course has steadily increased. But, despite our great advantages of location, our work has been limited by our utterly .inade- quate facilities both as to equipment and teaching force. Tiricks cannot be 111ade with- OUt straw, even with the aid of electricity. It seen1ed inconceivable that such an oppor- tunity as Union college presents for training in electrical science should fail to be appreciat- ed. \Naturally a1nong those who recognized our opportunity were the officers of the General Electric company, who have uniformly sought to encourage and aid us, and now their interest has expressed its,elf in an offer which was presented to a special meeting of the board of trustees and accepted. \ In general tenns, this offer includes an im- mediate gift(for the equipment of our electri- cal laboratory sufiicien t to meet present needs and the annual payment for five years of a certain sum for salaries, provided the friends of the college contribute another sun1 for the same purpose. '~But, important as this is, it is to n1y mind the least inportant part of the offer which has co1ne to us. In addition, the special electrical expert of the con1pany, whose position at the head of his profession is, unchallenged, the man to whom President · Eliot referred last June, when conferring upon him an honorary degree, as 'the foremost representative of electrical science in America, and therefore, in the ·world,' Mr. C. P. Steinmetz, is per- mitted to take charge of our course of instruo- tion and has already been appointed professor of electrical engineering in Union college. \It is needless to say anything further. What I have said already means that Union is to have the best electrical engineering course in the country, a course that will n1eet the ideas and the practical support of the General Electric company. The name of Mr. Stein- metz as its responsible head is sufficient alone to draw universal interest to it. ''And yet, only a beginning has been made. vVhen students come in greater nutnbers, as they will, they n1ust be provided for. This is your opportunity and the opportunity general- ly for the friends of education. 'fhe sma11 sum to be raised, as stipulated by the General Electric company, has already been subscribed, but more is needed. vVe want further contri- butions to these special purposes. More lab- oratory space will soon be required ; more buildings n1ust be provided ; a new chemical laboratory to meet the requirements of the im- portant department of electro-chemistry; a · larger physical laboratory ; better living ac·

I ', ) . I ,, :! ' . \ \ '\ \~ \\ \' ~ THE ·OON·OORDIENSIS. 7 commodations and more of then1. All these are in the line of progress made imperatiYe by the action taken today and they will con1e. Americans are not in the habit of lettinp- such 0 opportunities go by unirnproved. ''Our financial condition is such that we in- vite investigation. \Ve have no debts and under l\1r. :Bailey's managen1ent as treasurer we shall never have any. \Ve are building now on the rock and every stone that is added will stay. ''One word more. Some of you are don bt- less asking if the college is to become simply an engineering school. By no Dleans. rrhe college is a unit; lift one part an.d you lift all. Money brings money, students bring stu~lents. The man who comes for the engineering course will have a friend who will con1e for the classi~ cal_course. There need be no fear that Union college will be false to the traditions that ern· phasize the in1portance of general culture, as distinguished from technical training. \And in this connection I may add that -v·ve are not carried away with the idea that the cl e- gree is the great thing and that the sooner it can be obtained the better. Something is to be said in favor of shorter courses for those who are to go fron1 college to professional schools, but in addition. it is well to recognize that tin1e is the in1portant factor in norn1al de- velopment. :Forced growths are never barely and the year that is worth 1nost to the average college student is the senior year. It is not till then, as a rule, that he finds bimself. \I shall not enter, however, upon a discus- sion of this vexed question. I only wish to define our pos1t1on. 'Vhile \\Ve recognize changed conditions we also recognize great underlying principles, and while we shall do what we can to tneet the legiti1nate detnands of the age, there is no danger that we shall forget or deny the essential principles es- tablished both by reason and by experience. '' 1\1r. C. P. Steintnetz, answering to the toast on \Lightning Progress, \ briefly outlined the intended course in electrical engineering. He stated that he was in con1plete agreement with the educational principles which hades~'· tablished and maintain eel the reputation of Union university in not making the college a mere training school of engineers, but aiming to give the student a broad and general scien- tific education in all the knowledge required by the educated man in :tbis twentieth century, laying special stress, however, on en1pirical sc1cnce, as physics, n'J,echanics, chetnistry, natural science and n1atbetnatics. Such in~ structions, he said, wil1 consu1ne the best part of the :first t\vo years and vdll then be fol- lowed by an instruction in the general princi- ples of n1echanical and electrical engineering, and their application \'with special attention given to a thorough understanding of the fund a~ meatal principles of engineering science. Prof. Steinn1etz also dwelt on the inu11ediate establishrnen t of a post graduate course, and stated. that the facilities offered at Union col- lege for such a course, by the close proximity of the largest electrical rnanufacturing com- pany and the loco1notive works and their favor- able attitude towards tb.e college, are equaled nowhere in the world. ·He said that he felt confident that such a coul-se will result in great benefit not only to the post graduate students, but produce results of investigation of lasting value to the enginee1·iug world at large and greatly enhance in t11e world of science the f:.une of old Union. Charles E1nory Sni i.tl1, devoted the greater part of his remarks t() national issue. He said, in part : \The National union has taken a new position in the last five years. 'fhe say- ing that \Ve have becon1e a world power in the last five years is aln1ost trite, yet it is literally true. Two years ago, when the civilized na- tions were struggling w·ith the sen1i-civilized giant of the east, the United States appeared at the council table of tbe nations, and appear- ed c..s a detennining factor. Had it been five years before, the United States would have been an i1npassive spectator, and it is to the credit of t,he United States that at that 1no- n1ent its power was llsed for the maintenance

Addres!!l all communications to THE CoNCORDIENSIS Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. Sundry Pertinent Remarks. One lap in the year's co1,1rse well nigh finished, the Board of Editors gives· you all good speed in the next. l\1ay no examination flaunt you, may no con- ditions haunt you, may no ingratitude taunt you ! \Ve are about to enter upon a strenuous term. For the benefit of those whose connection with the student body is recent, permit us to emphasize the need of continued activity. Each term of the college year has its own pursuits to dis- tract one from the more serious purposes of his college life. In the fall and spring the college shmvs pre·emin· ently in athletics. In these phases the college is above all things manly, energetic, honorable. In the winter term an entirely different phase is shown. Cultivate your tal- ents. Do not allow them to sink into disuse because of ridicule or apathy of your fellows. .A mistaken code pre- vails ·here as in all colleges. The man entering eollege with ability in any line not athletic must forget it and start --· .... .;.- -·- ~ ... -~ afresh. This is not so evident at Union as at other -col\ leges, and although in the main unjust, can :be changed only by a change in the ideals of the college student. Cultivate class and college spiri~. Do not shirk responsi· bi:lities. Do not make the collectors hunt you up. ,Do not put them off. Set a date on which you will pay them and pay them promptly and willingly on that date though the heavens fall. If you are on a committee don't wait for the next man to make a move, get yourself in motion and you'll find the whole machine in fine running condition. Don't ''knock.\ Any fool can find fault. There is nothing perfect in college, nor in the world for that matter. Look at the leaders in college activities. Do they knock? Possibly, But all the same they do less of it than the man who never gets out and hustles for his class and college. These are good New Year Resolutions to make. Think them over, and while you do we wish you a Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year. The next issue of the Concordiensis will be published Jan. 14th, 1903. SONGS OF YULETIDE. I Over the valleys and over the hills, Freezing the runlets and stopping the rills, Binding the wheels of a myriad mills, \tVinter, chill winter, comes creeping. Sing ho for the snow and the North \vind's blow! Sing hey for the year that totters! Hark lads for the cling as the runners ring Over the frozen waters. Deep in the chimney the North wind's roar Rises in fury more and more, Scattering sparks on the sanded floor. \Vare ye ! 0 you that are sleeping ! So ring out the chime for the glad Yule time, And let the bells swing pealing. Let your laughter and mirth at th~ world's new birth The joy in your hearts be revealing •. As the years have com:e so the years will go Like the great sea's tide with its ebb and flow I

· -·TIIE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 · The ocean of life is· changing. . B:ut let not·this tide sweep by, scorned aside, To go o'er the ocean wide ra11ging. So laugh while ye may in your blithsome way At the sport of the winter weather. • And pray that ye may £or aye and a day Be happy as now together. So ho for snow, and the North wind's blow! No fear for the year that totters. See lad how she cHngs as the runner rings Over the frozen waters ! S. :B. Howe, Jr., 'o3 II. The icicle hangs to the maple-tree bough, I-lo ! Hey! Ho ! for the glad Yule·time ! The creek in the meadow is frozen, I trow. Ho ! IIey! Ho ! for the frost sprite's bride ! Fo she's comin2' bedecked all with diamonds so fair, And snowflakes are glittering in her white hair, She's as light as the thistle bloom blown in the air. IIo ! Hey ! Ho ! for the glad Yule-tide ! See, woodmen are working in forest and field, Ho ! Hey ! Ho ! for the glad Yule-tide ! See, forest firs falling as axes they wield. Ho ! Hey ! Ho ! for the warm hearth· side ! The bells in the belfry are pealing the hour, And telling mankind of the Cl1rist-child's power. Now Carol, ye Waits, from cottage to tower- llo! I-Iey ! Ho ! for the glad Yule-tide! S. B.

At the beginning of the winter term the club will prepare , a series of lectures for that terrn The fall tenn exarr1inations will begin Thurs- day and will last until Tuesday, Decernber 23rd. The vacation will last from December 23rd to I January sth. The editorial board of the 1904 Garnet al- ready has work on that annual well under way. The photographs of all the men1bers of the junior class will all be in by the end of the term and the histories of the n1ern bers of the two upper classes have all been handed in. The 1904 Garnet will retain all the good features in- troduced by 1902 and 1903, and will also in- troduce new ones, and every effort will be , made to rnake the Garnet of the present junior class one of the best annuals published at U ~ion. One new feature, and one that will tend rnore to strengthen the University spirit, will be the insertion of individual pictures of the members of the junior classes of the Law and Medical departments, the san1e as those of the college juniors. There are other in1proven1ents under consideration at present. 1.,he Garnet will, as usual, contain the college and fraterniny direct- ories, athletic records and tean1s, pictures of in- cidents of college life and views about the col- lege grounds, directors of the college organi- zations and the usual amount of literary n1atter.

The graJuatcs of the Albany I-Iigh School now in college met, Monday afternoon; and or- ganized themselves into a club which they have named the Albany High School Club. T'he, object of this organization is to increase the in- terest of A. H. S. tnen in college towards that institution and to endeavor to secure a corres- ponding interest for ''Old Union\ fro1n the • present rnen1bers of the A. H. S. It is thought that in this way, through the efforts of the A. I-I. S. alumni, Union will secure a great n1any more students from Albany. The number of graduates of A. H. S. now attending Union is fourteen. 1'he rnernbers of this organization expect to have social gatherings, with an occasional ban .. quet and thus renew social relations. 1'he officers of the Club as elected at the first meeting are- Pres.-Edward D. Greenn1an. Vice Pres.-.\Villiam C. Treder. Treas.-George M. Elmendorf. Sec.-Philip L. Classen. 1'he n1embers are- 1904. rr. G. Cowell. J. L. Donnhauser. E. D. Greenn1an. L. C. Hayes. E. V.

The foot-ball tean1 was entertained by Presi- dent and Mrs Rayrnond at their house, Friday ev:ening, Decernber I 2th. rrhe following men were present; Coach \Vhitney, Captain Gulnac, Griswold, Staeber, 'o3; Captain-elect Ohnsted, Hays, \Vatson, 'o4; Patto::.1, Raymond, 'os; Cook, Cantvvell, J)ann, Clark, Parker and \Vright, 'o6. Pres. Bolles of the Senior clas~ has appoint- ted as a committee, to arrange for an inter- cole_giate debate with Rutgers this winter, the following: Fenster, 'o3, Parker 'o3, Beadle, 'o4. The Senior class has organized a choral society which is hard at work practicing each morning in chapel. Delbridge is acting choris- ter, and a pleasing series of concerts is pro- n1ised. On one of the cold tnornings last week the genial Professor of n1odern languages held are- citation when the temperature in the room was so low that as the liquid VO\Yel sounds of the Gern1an rolled from his lips, they formed tiny icicles vvhich n1ade a pleasant tintinnabula- tion as they fell upon the frozen floor. He bade his long suffering class gather ar?und the ice-encased radiator exclamin~. ''It will be \Yann here in about five 1ninutes.\ \Vhen ten 1ninutes had passed with no percep- tible change in the tetnperature he notice'd a window was open, but this never phased the re- presentative of the teutonic phlegn1atic temper- atnent for he continued the recitation as usual until two n1inutes after the bell had sounded. , 0. G. Cox, '98, has been visiting friends in town for a few days. 0-vving to the severity of the \veather last week several recitation rootns were ten1 porarily abandO'led. But under the efficient super\·isi- i on of G ~ o ~· g e Clute all have b ~ ,~ n heated properly and exan1inations will be held in the scheduled places. At a rneeting of the Sophomore class, IZauf- nlan vvas elected manager of tbe class basket- ball tearn. A captain will be chosen later frotn those candi~lates who present then1selves for practice. The manager has received a chal- lenge frorn H.. P. I. sophornores whom r 905 defeated last year as Fresh1nen. If enough n1en come out for the teatn, it bids fair to g1ve all colnpetitors a hustle for the laurel. ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. T'he first Senior smoker of I 90 3 Yvi 11 be held at the New l(enmore, on the evening of Friday, Dece1nber, 19th. The Executive Committee of the class has charge of the affair, and as practically every men1 ber of the class has signified b,is intention of attending, the sn1oker is sure to be a great success. It is the intention of the class to give several of these infonnal sn1okers during the \~linter, in addition to the regular Senior banquet which is usually held con1mencen1ent week. Among the appointn1ents recently announc- ed by the Ron. John Cunneen, Attorney-Gen- eral-Elect, is that of George B. M cCartee, Jr., of Salem, N. Y. Mr. 1vicCartee was a n1en1-. ber of the class of I 902, and the present Senior Class are rnuch pleased with his success. Porter Lee ~·ferrilnan, 'o3, and Ray L.

MODERN FEETBALL. Hovv to Play It. Jl}om the Chicago TTibune. LESSON VII.-THE CHEERMAS'l'ER.. The cheermaster is the fellow who causes the old grads to look at each other and say, '' vVere \Ve ever like that ? \ In appearance the cheennaster resetnbles the front of a box at the horse show. As to hair, he 111ust look like an Anarchist deprived of beer. The uninitiated n1ay recognize the cheer- master at a glance. He is the chap that helps the captain peel off his sweater, pats hin1 on the shoulder and says. ''For the love of dear old ahna n1ater, do your best.

Fearey & SonJ less of the fact that that captain has forgotten his two flunks . and three conditions, and is thinking only how he can gouge the eyeball out of the 1nan who jun1ped on his stomach the season before. After he has encouraged the team the cheer- master takes his stand on the front rail of the grand stand, anned with a flag tied to a cane.· He then gives an imitation of a Plymouth Rock rooster flapping its wings, anti as his arms move up and down the Kankakee chorus in the seats in front of him yelps. 'rhis is repeated until the hun1an beings mov.e away from the freshn1an. Meanwhile the rival cheermaster has been conducting a rival asylum. T'he cheermaster is supposed to make his bug-house orchestra drown out the other. This is difficult when the score is o to 38. and most of the members of the chorus are wondering whether the governor will stand for another touch to replace the $8 bet lost. The cheerrnaster who can keep the noise going under these circumstances deserves better than to hear the remarks that are made about him by non- collegians as they are leavipg the grounds. After a ga!ne the cheermaster is allo.wed to rub down the half back aud carry the tackle's grip. The rest of the night he tn ust steady himself against the bar and try, in a horse voice, to explain to twenty-nine howl- ing dervishes of the opposition ho\V his team really was the better, but had tough luck. $ J.5 0 a pa{r. ~-------------------2_3_a_n_a_25_Nc~o_._R_~_r_lS_r_.~ ___________ A_L_B_~_N_Y._~_~_·~~-
