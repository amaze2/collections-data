The mayor summed up most forcefully in the last paragraph by say-

I I, 8 '.A.'HE :CONCORDIENSIS ing \There are certain essentials to success .in politics, without which no man should under- take its proftession, and these essentials a1'e four -·a sense of honor, common sense, a so2nse of proportion, and last, but not least, a sense of hum·or. If you have not these, leave politics alone. Both you and the eountry \Viii be better off. If you h.ave these essentials, hO\Yever, and feel the call of the profession, then: the ·whole world is open to you, and there is no office, no matter how high, to which you may not aspire. Furthermore, it is your duty to devote your lives to the sen·ice of the state, not so much for your own advance1nent as for th,e good of youu' fel- lo\v,men.
