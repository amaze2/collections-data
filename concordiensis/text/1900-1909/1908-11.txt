.THE CoNCORDIENSIS VO·L. XXXII. UNION COLLEGE, NOVEMBER 6, 1908 No.4 Some Official I nfermatio·ri Abo.ut lt. Probably. only a very small ]lereentage of the student ho·dy' has any definite ide.a about the new e11gineering building to be ·erected on the Campus this year ... In order to give Unfon. men fuller in- f.crm ation about it, Dr. La·nct:eeth talked freely on tl1e subj.ect in an interview with. a .member of ''Tne CcncoTdiensis\ staff. The building will be about 13.6 feet front by 170 feet deep, and will he situated directly east of the che1nica1 laboratory anti abott t :five feet back from the line of the N·orth Collage C()lonnade. In ar- ch~ cectural design it will be .similar to the twv Gi iginal college buildings, N ortb .. and South Col- h.:ges. There are to be two gables, one at each e1H\ connected by a higher ro<>t:. The building material will be brick with stone trimming, fireproof floors and :fireproof slate roof. The interior walls will be mostly of selected ex- , posed.\ brick, tastefully ·tinted. It. will be heated by direct and indirect radi- ation, mainly by .direct radiation, but with 'enough indirect to ensure good ventila.tion. It will be lighted throughout by electri-city, and. will also have supplementary g·as fixtures. The building will consist of four stories. The l '.:nv er one will he occupied by the laboratories for te-sting heavy materials, such as bea.ms, columns a111l building material,· and will a1s() have a cement t2st and laboratory, a room for paying out instru- lllt'nts for the students' use, toilet rooms and a fan roo·m for heating and circ:ulation purposes. The next floor will contait1 tha surveying labo- rat9ry, the engineering mHseurn and libra.ry, and reeitatio·n roo·ms. The third :floor will be cl.€voted to sanitary en- ginE-ering and will have the mechanics al1d ap- li lied m·echanics Ta bora tory-, Glra.wing and recita- drawing T·ooms and to photographic and blue print rooms. The plans for the building hav-e been ·entirely r:n•pared, bids have been received anGl have re. cerved the con.side.ra.tion of architects and tll'a con1mittee of the trustees. An award will be m:xde very soon, perhaps in a few days.. 'The cost when complete and fitted with furnitur2, to which \ special attention is to be paid, will be $100,000. Tlds figure does not, of course, include any elec- tncal equipment or aparatus. The present equip- n_·,~nt .will be moved into the new building, and this will be substantially increased by further sub· ·~criptions. It is expected that the building will be ready for occupancy next fall at the opening ()if the cal- l( ge year. It will, of course, ·not be the larg-est bn·:lding c.f its kind in the country, but it will un- questionably be one of the best arranged and best equipped, and will supply a long felt need in the cc.Uage. The greatest credit is due those wh.o have la- bored so untiringly to make possible for eld Union such a valuable improve1nent to its already fa- nrous engi'neering department. ---·------- President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of th·c Univ.er- r;'ty of California has been nominated by the trus- te-es of Columbia University and appointed by the Prnssian Ministry of E:Jucat:on as Theodore R.oosevE,lt profe.ssor i:n the University -of Berlin f·Jr the year 1909-1910.

6 THE CONCORDlENSIS 1 .. . jfootball UNION IS A~GAIN BEATEN JN A HA.RD FIGHT. Colgate, 24; Umion, 4. Union: suffe1~ed her second bad defeat at the h:1~1ds of the Colgate eleven last Saturday at Ham- iH0n. The Garnet team went into the game scrr'ewhat crippled, due to the los:s of several gcHJcl men, and was more so before the game was over. The Colgate line weighed nearly 30 pounds tn n mall heavier, and the:ir whole team c-onsisted of good strong football players. Union, however, nu·de the first score in th·e game after about ten nlinutes of play. In the first half, when Union obtained the ball, shu advanced it to Colgate's 30-yard line .. Here Doran Brown fell back to the 35-yard line and ldcl\ed a nice clean goal from placement, whicn vvas the only score made by Union during the game. Doran, however, attempted to kick goal Lcn1 placement twice more, once in each half, but failed both times. ll'. the next fine minutes Colgate rapidly carried thG ball down the field and sent it over for a touchdown. During the remai'nder of the half there was no more scoring by eith'er side and the ball was l{ept i11 Colgate's territory tlr~ who.Je time. Twice Union used the forward pass fo·r gains of 40 yards amd 20 yards, and can1e very near c~}lgaite's, goal. Here a place kick by DQran failed. On the for- wc..rd pass Doran took the ball an-d passed it to Anders-on, who made 40 yards. Again, when Col- gi1te had the ball, th'ey attempted a forward pass, hut the ma-n was tackled before he passed the ball and lost it. Hurlburt recovered the ball and started down a clear field, bnt was caught on Col- gate's 5-yard line. This was the only time Colgate tried the forward pass. Score at end of first half: Colgate, 5; Union, 4. In the .second half Wa11a:ce substituted for Star- buck at quarter; Walton for Ve.dder; lVIcCvrmaclr for Sellnow, who was talren out because of a ldck in tlre head; Dudley for Hequeinbourg; H. Stew- art for Robinson. and H. Lewis for H. Stewart. When the half started Union worked hard and fa~,t, but had to give way before Colgate's heavy line. ·waite of Colgate kicked a TI:eld goal from ~0- yard line, then Loeber, after making a fiine 6·0-yar.d rr:.n, scored a touchdown. This was carried on t 1 H:; whole half and the game ended with the score: Colgate, 24; Union, 4. Summary: Touchdown-Colgate, 3. Field goals-Union, 1; Colgate, 2. Goals f~om touchdown-· Oolgate, 1.

' THE CONCORDIENSIS : . :::: CROS~COUNTRY RUN. Union, 14; Ham i I ton, 14. .. The cross-country run with Hamilton last Satur- day resulted in a tie. Travis, however,. carried off the laurels, b.eing the first to cross tne seed choked by th·orns,.

At the mid-week meeting which w.as held t .coward finished f·ourth and Finch fifth. ape. Rt~ precht ran a plucky race, his feet, owing to U 1 eir soreness resulting fron'l prev:ous practice runs, being .swathed in bandages. The race was started from the Utica Golf Club at 3 o'clock, the signal being givGn by Mr. Sher- ril Sherman, tlTa son of the Vice President-elect wbo acted in the capacity of referee of the con- tE:fl The officia.ls followed the runners in Mr. Sl1<:::rn1an's automobile and the various Union and H[lm:Iton rooters were able to witness the run fn,nl a trolley ear. Professors Butler and Joh·n for Hamilton and Chester Ranl<in, '09, for Union acted as judges of fiLish, which was at Clinton, approximately four an·~. a half miles from the starting p·otnt. T-ravis vras the first runner to come into view, followecl clcfely by a Hamilton runner. When near the filtish the Hamil ton rurine1~ pass.ed Travis, but the latter with a w·onderful ·burst of speed, consider- in,~ the distance he ha.d run, passed his opponent n.111~ crossed the line first. Co...,-..-ard in the ·aarly stage of the race was apparently hopelessly in the r~a-r. \¥hen near the finish he recovered and p~E:sing two Hamilton runners, finlshed in fourth place. 'Cnfavorable weather conditions made a speed record impossible. Snow fell during part of the eontest and a co·ld wind blew .cont:nually in the f3.ce of the runners.

THE !C:ONCORDIENSIS FINE TRIBUTE TO c. P. STEINMIETZ. --.o- (Account in New York Times of .SunJ.ay, Noveln- ber 1, 1908.) In last Sunday's issue of the New York. Times tlle.~r'€ was nearly a whole page taken up by an art!ele o·TI: the life and ·work of Prof. Ste;inlll'otz. A rf:-tJ·(prter for the 'rimes -came to Schenectady ·one da y 1ast week to hold a personal intervrew with JJr·. Stetlilmetz, and as a result th·cre ap:p·eared a fi:JfiC' well-written article concerning this remark- a:l)o1:0- man, who is fan1iliar to nearly every one on t~h ... ~ Hi11, and who has been connected with Union a~;. :Professor in Electrical Engineering f-o<r over 1!:·\\E: years. The1·e appeared als·o a large :p;hoto- 6l\'ap1l of Stei'nmetz seated at a table. T1re Times attempted \to tell the storyt of' Steinmetz's greatest achievement-an achieve- 11-t ent which every one can appreciate-the story of wh.at Steinmetz has made of himself.\ T l1e article says: \Nineteen years ago Charles p.-:ro.teus Steinmetz, a newly arrived imnigra.nt, w ~~~ tramping the streets of Bro·oklyn loo·king for H job. By perseverance he secured a t-welve dol- J:!.r a week position as draughtsman in a small .0leetrical plant. To-day he can tack an ,A\. M. aiJ<l a Ph. D. behind his name, and as cons1lllting ·eil:~ineer of the ·General Electric Company draws a salary which cuts- an immense slice out of :$100,- :Q.()O. A1s·o, he is p.rofe.ssor of electrical engineer- Ju:g- at Union College, author of text ·nooks and rlf~e-ognized as o·JIJ:e ·of the world's greatest mathe- ,tua ticians.'' Further, \Dr. Steinmetz was born in Br~slau, ;(;eriDany, April 9, 1865. He did not go to scho-ol ~tL ntH he was 7 years old. He attended the school :f~·-- 12 years. Even as a young boy he began to H l'OW his mental predilections, inherited ·no doubt .f TC .. ·ln his fattier, who wa.s always interested in .s.ei entitle subjects. Young Steinmetz had a small e:hcmical laboratory at his home and used to spend ·::~. good deal of tim·e in it. Mathematics also· had ea.t.~g;ht his interest. Steinmetz ascr:b'as all his :s:Hccess in life to his tho.rough knowledge ·O·f rnath- en\Jatics. \'At the age of 19 he went to the University of Br-'€slau. He c·ontinued his study of mathe1natics ·C~h d becam·e interested in astronomy, p.J1y.sics and o:a t 11 ral history. It was not until the following ye~r that Steinmetz, with no idea of ma.king any pra.cUcal application O·f the subject, began the study of electrical engineering·. He had formed a f1·iendship for a fellow student who was pursuing that subject and Steinmetz· merely wanted to 1\.:rJow something ahout it.\ The Times further tens 1NJW Steinmetz became c01n1ected with the Soci~al Democratic Party th roug1l this friend. ho·w they met in clifferen t rooms to talk over methods. of ra-volutio·nizing the -vvurld, and how later he became the e-ditor of a Sccialist paper, in place of a rn.an who had been in1pr.is-oned, and how he managed to edit the paper urlln1own to the goverrunent off-icials. He and his friends got a Poli.s1h :fis1ll vender w:ho could neithe:r read nor write, to be reco·rded as the responsible eci~tor. Soon, ho-wever, the seh'eme was found out ~n:d the fish seller, together with Steinm·etz's fric.'nd and several others were put into prison. T:!.1e paper was soon reorganiz-<2d and went on as b<: ~ore. Later on, Steinmetz began to be sus- pected, the police watehed his movemonts, and he learned that th'ey were about to arrest him. He slJpped across the Austria11 borde·r to Vienna, and tnen went to Switzerland. When he arrived there he had very little money~ but was able to· obtain sunJ'e from a book on astr·ono1ny, which he had pn-'viously written. He also was able to write a.r- t:._:Jes on popular astronomy for a political paper, O!le of the owners of whic1} he became acquainted with. He a little later entered the Polytechnic scl·ool in Zurich, living the while with a friend. Tn 1889 he and his friend came to America in the st ( erage on a French liner. Dr. Steinm·~tz says atnut this trip< \I have crossed the ocean since, i1J. the first cabin, but I have not had so pleasant a voyage sine~ as was that one in the steerage.\ He b-rought with him two letters of introduction, tbrough one of which h·c finally obtained a po- Picture Framing--- Did she give yon her Photograph ?

Ei-ckemever, who had a small electrical plant in Yonker,s,. ancl was as clra. Ttgh tsman at a salary of $12 a vv·eek. Mr. E.ic1ce- lneyer be-came better acquainted with Ste'i\nm.etz ' and realized that there was a man vvho knew, and cerr'lcl do things, so he rais·ed his salary and put ' hi:rn in charge of aU new and experimental worl{. Then very .soon the illickemeyer factory united v:ith a score or more similar plants, forming the GE-lleral Electric Company, and in 1894: Mr. Stein- metz was put in -charge of the designing and cal- cnlrting department of the co1n:~any. The>n in ahcut four years 1:n{)re he was adva..nced to the po- siUon which he now holds, that of c-onsulting en- fnUy adapted itself to its suroundings and is the 1:·e~t illustration of the theory of evolution in plant life.\ H'e explained that about his only hobby was his greerlhouse, which i.s full of cacti. He also showed lUs one pet, about which he said, \That's 1ny gila monster. Its bite· is supposed to be as ·dchdly as that of a rattlesnake. A friend of mine s•2ni it to- me about six y-ears ago for experimental pltl poses, but I haven't yet foun·c1 any one with enough scientific enthusiasm to submit to a bite. So I have just kept it. It's so well acquainted Fitll me now that it no longer hisses when I pass by.\ Wte n a.skul if lYe eared for books, he answered, gim::er to the company. The Times here adds: \At the back of hiu hc·rr.le in Sehenectady he has a ceinplete labora- tc ?'Y, and there, with an assistant and a deputy 8S\ shtant, he quietly works out U1e theories that rncan better light. better heat, be.tter transporta- Eo'.l and better communication for the world.\ When asl{ed by the reporter if he found Sn;J.Ok· tn~: his cigars injurious, he replied:. \Why I've had tl'E se cigars especially made fov 1ne-very long 1 vtry tllin, and very mild. So, you see, I get a Inii!in1lnn amount -of nicotine with a maximun1 amcunt of .smoking. T·obacco has never made me s~c: 1·, ev?·n when I was learning t0 smoke. I didn't bc6in until I went to college·. Tlrcn I started by SBt(:ldng a quarter of a cigar, then a half, and fi:l: ally working up to a whole cigar.\ The reporter's version of this was, \Scientific- a~1y methodical, even in the acquiring of his vices.\ The Professor ad cled, \As f.or 1ny m·crn.-ory, I have a particulaTlJ goo·d ·one. I never ke'cP any n cord of my investigatio·ns or experiments. My InfcJory files all these things a way conveniently and .reliably.

BASKETBALL. Se.a,son's PTospects .Sright-Col·gate Forfe·its Tw'o Union Gam·es. With every player on last year's basketball team back in college and a nu1nber of Fre<shmen, with goo.cl basketball reputations, to draw fr'Om, there is every reason tl} believe that the .c·oming season will be the most successful since the sport was introdttced at Old Union. A fact which will contribute largely to the suc- cess of the season and b\3 of great interest to the student body is that the home games will be played ·on the ·ATmvry court instead of in the gym- nasium, where it was il:nposs.ible to acc·ommodate a large audience. The Armory ·court is om3 of the finest in this part of the State, and for the Union team to ha.ve the use of it will undoubtedly be the 1nean.s of bringing better teams h·ere and placing the sp·ort on a paying basis. Manager (dark has arranged seven games, which are still to be ratified by :the athletic coun- cil, and three or four additional ones are under consideration. The schedule to date is: Hobart at Hobart, January 8; Rochester at Rochester, January 9; Hamilton at ·Clinton, January 15; Cor- ~ nell at Ithaca, Ja·nuary 16; Rochester at Schenec- tady, January 23; Hobart at Schenectady, Febru- ary 6, and Hamilton at Schenectady, February 17. It is possible that Tufts and Brown will be added to the· sehed ule. Colgate ·has forfeited its two games for reasons unknown. Captain W. Brown will issue a call for candi- dates on Monday, ancl practice will be held reg- ularly every we·elc NOTI,CE TO FRESHMEN.

IO jfootball UNION EASILY ROLLS UP A BIG SCORE AGA,INST THE HOBART TEAM,. -·--- H oba.rt, 5; U 11 ion, 38. Last Saturday the last home game of the sea- so:n was played on the Campus with Hobart. 'Th.e day was i.deal for football, but rather e·oo~ for those who occupied the bleachers, and yet th.erB were abou.t 1,0·00 pres.ent to witness the ga.1ne. The team, alth0ugh somewhat cripple·cl :yet, showed that it has b'een working hard the past week, and that ·it will go to New Yorl{ ·st·rong enough to gain a victory over N. Y. U ., antl thus close the season with a victory. The game with Hobart was not a very hard one, because the Hobart team was not :very str·ong, only a few times holding tire Gar·net team. There were no especially good individNal players on their team, with the exception of Wood, a.t quarter, who put up a fine gan1e, nak· ing good gains several tim·es on quarterbacJ~ runs. Although he injure.d his k11ee in the last half he stayed in and played the entire game. They should have had no score, but one man: got through the line on an attempted forward pass by Union, ·caught up the fum,bled pass and caTr-i~.:-d it 20 yards for a touchdown, their only scor-e. For Union, every mau played .a good game and each deserves much credit. The game sh·():W'cd that there are n1any go·od substitutes, for in the last half a tea.m co·rn·posed principally of st.rb·sti- tute.s was put in, and yet was ahle to rip ulp the Hobart line for good gains. The gam·e was clean and there were only one or two men taken out because ·o·f injuries and none of these were at all serious. In the first half Hobart kicked o.ff to Dora11 Brown on the 20-yard line, and he returned it 30 yards. Then using straight line bucks Union l~ap­ idly advanced the ball the remainder of the ,field and in less than five rni\nntes of play Heq_neiD- bourg carried the ball over for a touclldown. Doran mi\sed the goal. Score-Hobart, 0; Union, 5. Union then kicked off to Hobart, and the ball was returned 15 yards. I-Iohart was. heJ:d. for clowns and pu1ilted to Star1nrck ,Wl'lo returne:d it 15 yards and tl~eH. i'n a few n1inutes more, by straight line bucks, Hequembourg was put over for a touchdown. Doran kicked the goal. S·core-H~b-a~rt, 0; Union, 11. Hobart kicked off to Stewart, who. carried the baH to Union's 25-yard line. Here a forwa.rd pass was attempted.,. l;mt before the ban was passed· a H·obart man went through the Hne, obtained it and carrie.ct it 20 yards .for a toTlch,down. Goal was missed. Score-liolJart, 5; Uni'o11, 11. Hobart kicked Qff to W. Brown, who returned th2 ball 20 yarcL.s. Here Union was held ancl Stewart punted, the ball going out of bounds, and Hurlburt recovering it. Then the ball was rapidly advanced clown the field an.d W. Brown carried it ·over for a touch.down. Doran missed goal. Bcore-Hoha:}'t, 5; Unio11, 16. Hobart kicked :off and the ball was returned 30 Y'ards. 'H·er,e two forward passes -were tded hy Union, but both failed and Union was penalized 30 yar.ds. Stewart puntecl to center of field, where Hobart was held, and punteJ to Union. Then Kriegs1nan made a 25-yard run, D. Br:own one of 2·0 yards a·nc1 then \Buster\ w·2nt over the line for a touchdown. Doran kicked the goaL Score at end of half--Hobart, 5; Union, 22. The second 11 alf was practically a repetition of the first, with tbe exception that a sub team was put in and yet made goocl gains on every clown. There were 16 paints ma.de by Union in this half anJ the ga.me ended with the score 38 to 5 in Union's favor.

THE ·CONCORDIENSIS 13 AWAKENEND INTEREST IN THE Y. Nt. C .. A. .• Enthusiastic Meeting. Tuesday Evening. The new .spirit at u·nion this year seems to have found full expression in the Christian Asso- ciation. Probably never before in the lilistory of the college has there been such a Y. M. C. A. meeting as was held in Silliman Hal[ last Tues- day evening. Fr.om every point of view the rally was a success. The attendance was ·Nnprece- clented, and throughout the me·eting a spirit of unusual enthusiasn1 and earnestness nrark.ed the discussion. Tte first speal\er was Dr. Frank C. Barnes, the sc.cretary of the faculty, who present~d a faculty viewpoint of tne Y. M. C. A. and suggested that the Y. M. C. A. could be a great help to the col- lGge by bringing about 1nore social interq_ourse and fellowship in the student body. Lewis, '0'9, president of the stude·nt body, said t:1at the fellow.s were beg·inning to realize as never before the importance of the Y. M .. C. A. in college life, anJ entered an urge11t plea for lcyal 'Support of its work. Hutchens, '10, assistant football manager, spol{e as the representative of the junior class. He said that ma·ny of the fellows ares guilty {)f spiritual inllifference, and that no student could b'ccome a well educated, well rounded man, unless he de- velops the religious side of his life. He then went on to say that the speakers at the meetings: of the Christian Association were all men whom the fel- lows ought to hear. T1 avis, '11, Union's best long-distance runner, was introduced as the next speaker. He said that the reputation of our college i'f'\. the ·eyes of the outside world is form.ed in very large measure by the moral standard of the college ancl that this standard is determined by the influence vf the Christian Association. He .showed hy concrete example that the ·college in which .the Y. M. C. :A:. i.s weak and receives poor support is the oll'e that receives unfavorable comment on its moral life. Potter, '12, spoke for the Freshman clas.s, urg- ing all Freshmen to join the Y. M. C. A. and to support its work, saying that not all can help the college through athletics, but that everyone can help raise the tone of the college by supporting the association. After the regular progra1n there was an in· -ijit's from f?2_.uinn's, it's best Quinn is out for Co1lege business DowN oN STATE :STREET-· IN THE VENDOME HoTEL Building is a Drug Store that's going hard after your business, fellows.

Potter, '09, captain of the foot- hall team, spol\e for a few moments, and Dr. Mc- Cmnber mad~ an especially urgent appeal in be- half of the Gh ristian Association. At the vesper service last Sunday Dr. George R. Lunn gave an excellent tallz on \The Value of Prayer.\ Next Sunday Dr. Stevenson of the Pr'-:.sbyterian Church will spealc AHfl~ the meeting ·next Tuesday evening the first rPgular meeting o-f the Dean's Bible Glass \Yill be held. It is hoped that the fellows will ap- lH·-)ciate Dean Ripton's course, as he is a remarl\- abiy good leader and never fails to bring up help- ful ancl interesting thoughts. Daniel M. Van Anken, a prmninent citizen anll many years a leading men1ber of the bar of Pi1u~ County, Pa., d.ied in his h01ne near Milford on Friday of debility. He W8S 82 years old. He was graclua te.c1 fro1n Union College in 1852 and was adn1itted to the bar in 1855. He was electe·d to Congress in 186G and re-elected two year.s later.

Friday and Satarday of last week were spent b_y t1ra stu-dents of the E1ectricai E·ngineering De- partm-ent in an inswection trip to New York city. A-bout twenty-two men went on the trip, which turned out to he a suceess in every respect. Be- fore the trip .Mr. E. J. Berg v.f the General Elec- tric Company gave u.s a talk, p~inting out the im- portant things to look for a-nd to ask questions ' about. T'he success of the trip was largely Jue to the valua:b1e information and SJ.:lggestions given by Mr. Berg. On Friday afternoon we insp:c·cted the N\')W York Edison SY'Stem. The party :met at the 44 West 27th Street sub-station of the company, where Mr. Torchir, tl!eir chief en:ginee:r, read a paper which he had prepared for u.s -on the Edison system. C'opies of this paper -were give·n u-s with a map 0f the city showing the location of the coln- pa:ny;s ·mains, power stations, sub-stations, etc. After the lecture we were cDnductad by Mr. Torchir and several o-f his assistants, through the sub-stations. Here we saw the rotary converters and storage batteries which arc common to all of these sub-stations. The switching arrangements were of particula.r intere.st, because of their COi11- pact form. The system -of multiple busses by which the feeder voltage could be regulated for a·ny desire-d. load, could be regulated, was ex- plained to us. We were also shown ho-w the volt- age on any part of the system could be read at the station -by means of a system of potential wires reaching from all parts of the city. A1fter leaving the .sub-station we descended into a manhole, where the method of leading cables abnut the city underground was 1:nade clear. We two in number, the party w.as divided into groups, each group being furnished with competent guid- ance. We first inspected station No. 1. This sta- tion is mo·stly engine driven, its total capacity b2tng 67,500 ldlowats, consisting 0f eleven West- inghouse con1pound three-cylinder engh1e-driven sets and five General Electric turbilr2s. All this apparatus, located as it is on one floor, is very im- pressive. After being shown everything of interest in sta- tion No. 1 we visited station Nv. 2. T111.s station is o-f more recent design, consisting of turbine driven sets. Its total capacity is 72,0·00 kilowats, consisting of six General Electric and tw-o West- inghouse turbines. One of the striking features of this station was the switci1board arrangement. The boards are of marble and form a hemisph·2r- ical room, from any part ,of which all the meters and apparatus contr-olling the station can be seen. We were at the station just as the peakload was coming en, about 5 o'clock. This L.s the bus- iest time and ·averything about was in operation. The boilers were a.ll being fired up and one ma- chine after another was brought up to speed atll1 phased in, while others were slowly turning over, waiting to take their share of the load when needed. Amongst all this activity, however, there was no confus-io11. Up in the gallery of the statio-n sat a man, the l-oad despatcher they called him, who had the whole system under his controL By means of a board before him he could tell the exact con- dition of the lo-ad in any part of the system and it was his business to distribute it properly amongst the various sub-stations. On Friday evening tho.se who desired to do so attended the meeting of the American Institute then entered a FHth A ve·Rue buss, which was of El'ectrical Engineers. At this meeting a paper waiting for us, and were quickly transported tv the waterside stations ·of the N·ew Y.ork Ehlison Com·pan:r. These stations are located -on the East River and ara thus enable to receive their co,a,l by boat and have plenty of condenser water o·n electric heating was read and discussed. We met Saturday morning at the Madison Ave- nue office of the New York Central Railroad Cnrn- pany. Here we found Mr. Katte, chief engineer of electric traction, wh-o by means of 1nap.s and at a minimum cost. In inspecting these stations, diagrams described in a brief and interesting way ''·

Mr. Katte then conducte·d us over the 45th Street bridge, from which we obtained a very coinpre· henstve view of the Grand Central Station termi- nal, yards, tracks, etc., as well as the construction work. From here we walked up L·exington A1ve- nue, which paraUells the terminal yard, to the fiftieth sub-station, where we w·0re shown the bat- tery rooms, rotary sub-station, signal sub~station, etc. E1nergtng from the signal station w-e en- tered the north end of the storage yard, where we had an opportunity of inspecting an ·electric loco- motive and some of the multiple unit cars. This took all the morning and we were gl!ad to hurry away for lunch and get ready for the ball game in the afternoon. STUNG!

Last Saturday Dean Ripton and Prof. H. G. Mc- Ke.an were in Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania i'n attendance at a meeting of dele- gates from the Middle States and Maryland., h·cld for the purpose of organizing an college entrance certificate hoard within that territory. The ·id·ea is to obtain unifo·rmity in regard to the entr·a:nce certificate in these colleges, along the same lines as in the New E·ngl.and colleges. Last week the Yale football management sent to the Brown management the football which. was used at New Haven ·in the Yale-Brown gane on November 7. This was a very appropriate act of courtesy on the part of the Blue. Following is a letter received by Dr. McGomber from the physical directo-r at Brown, to who~n Dr. Mac s·cmt a copy of the Athletic Board constitu- tion: Brown University, Providence, No. 12, 1908. S.

Despite the fact that so mapy fellows were i'n New York, the meeting last Sun- Jay afternoon was well attended. The speaker was Dr. A. Rus.s:ell Stevenson, who has just re- turned from a surnm·<er in Europe. He :Spoke on \The Way in Which ·Christ Can Help the Young Man.'' Mr. John H. Safford; who was for .several years one of the State secretaries of College Christian As.sociations, was on \the Hiil\ Tue•sday after- noo·n. He met with th'e Y. M. C. AI. cabinet in the afternoon and made suggestions for the :re.ar's work. At the prayer rneeting Mr. Safford gave a very interesting talk on. the work of the international move1nent of the Christian Associations. The fir.st Y. M. C. A. was organized .jn 1858, while to- day there are 57,000 students, who are members of the college Y _ M. C. A. Last year there were over 48,00'0 tn:en enroiled in Bible Study. Mr. Saf- ford went on to say that never before have so n1any leading men -in athletics and all college ac- tivities been active workers in the Christian Asso- ciations. After Mr. Saiiford's tall{, Dean Ripton b'egan his course in Bible Study. He ga.ve an introductory talk that was fHll of i'nterest. With the Dean a.s a normal class leader, an excellent course is as- sured.

THB CONCORDIENSIS ' : ~ = WITH THlt: DEBATERS. Interest is beginning to be aroused in the aninTa1 Allison-Foote debate, which \Vill probably b'e he1c1 on January 15th. This year the Pl1ilomatheans submit the qnes- ticn and the Aidelphics have the choice of sides. The executive committee of tll'e Philomathean Society has been considering the question f.or the debate and it will probably be submitted to the Adelphies some tim'e next -week The freshmen of the Adelphic S.cclety decided: that on account of the pressure of other debating Vi.'Crl~ they would he unable to accept the cha1le11ge d' U.e Philomathean fresh roen. Both societies have held t11eir regular weekly meetings. The subj'ect for debate with the Philo'\' matheans was: Resolved, That a high protective tqriff would be detrimental to the best interests of t1: 2 United State.s. The affirmative was d'efencled by w·. L. Cavert, '10; Gillies, '12, and Payne, '12. The negative was upheld by Chaffee, '10; Traynor, '12, and Potter, '12. The following subject was cliscuss·ed in the Ac1 el ph ic s.ociety: Resolved, That reciprocity vviC1 Canada would serve the best interests of the United States. The affir.mative was represe·nted l>Y Coplon,. '1 0, and Fink '11. The negative by Moulc1, '09, anc1 McGill, '11. --------- A TOAST.

On the other hand if he don bts these, there is small chance o·f his being able to do so. He should l{now that there is but one college in COLLEGE SPI Rli,. ---------- There is· no doubt hut that a coUage rn.an 's first duty is to himself and his classes, b1:1t .second the san1e way as there is but o11e mother .an.d one . cnly to these is his duty to his fel:Jow stuclents and country.

The cultivation of love for his Alma Ma teT, or in other words, getting into the spidt of his college, Ls one of the n1ost in1portant thtngs tn be derived from his course there. College sptrit in general is ma 11ifested in a n um- ber .of different ways. It is shown to a greater or less degree on the athletic Fi:~ld, in the class roon1s, at the college m·eetings ancl in inn umer- able other plac.es. A student's .spirit is partic- ularly shown in his ho1ne town, both during his course there and after he has .completed it. He shoulcl lose. no opportunity to indu·ce other stu- dents, students that would mal<e the college the better for there being there to come to his college in.stead of to some other place that they ~may have ations, because it is near his bom·e, because his relatives have been the'lre before him or because of other reasons, but the idea is not how he hap- pened to be the-re. He is there. It is his Alina Mater and he should ttse every means within his power to mal\e it the better/ for his having been there, to raise it, if ever so slightly in the eyes of the world. C. L.

How many fellows are there that d@ not think that their mothers are the very best in th·e world? How many who would grant for one instant that there is a better country than the-ir own? It should be precisely the .same way with their col- lege. They should never admit, not even to them- selves, that there is a single college bett€r than theirs. In this lies the foundan1ental principle oi co:llege spirit. Golleges are judged to a greater or less degree among men and wo1nen in t11e outsi:de world bY the spirit wh·ich is, or at least ha.s, tlra revutation of being prevalent at that institution. ?he a.m·ount of knowledge to be derived from b{)oks depends entirely on the student. One college ·ean giv~ him as much as another if he goes after it rightly. But in college life and collegB spirit eacll college dif· fers most widely from every other.

This was kept up during the entire ga1ne and was reflected in the good work done by the team. There have been rumors around to the effect that the decisions during the game were preju- dked and gave the advantage to N. Y. U. several times. These rumors are without caus;e. Taking ... the word of one of the men, we finLl that the pe·n- alties were deserved, with the possible ·exception of one or two. It is stated by one of the players that Starbuck, in his long run, did step -on the line, thus causing the ball to be br-ought back. Union was penalized rrearly the length of the field and yet she carried the ball farther tha·n N. Y. U. did. N. Y. U. used a short forward pass, but Union made good use of a very long· one, fail- ing in the attempt once or twice. During the latter half of the gam\~ there were a great many substitutes put in anJ their work showed the strength of the squad in general The Game: First half- Doran Brown kicked off to N. Y. U. and SeUnow downed the man in his tracks. N. Y. U. was held on her 30-yard Jin·.e and kiclced to Streibert; who was downed in the center of the field. Here He- quembourg made two 10-ya-rd gains, s.tewart three and Streibert five more. At this point Union was penaliz·eJ 1·0 yards for holding. Then Streibert punted, and again N. Y. U. ·being held for clowns, punted to Starbuck, wh._o made a splended 60-yard run, but was forced to take the ball back, because of g,aing out ()f bound·s. Starbuck kicked to New York and they again kicked to Walton, who re- turned. the ball ten yards. Streib·ert ma:de ten yards a·nd Stewart five l!nore. Here Union at- te.mpted the forward pass, but the baH was lost to N. Y. U. on a fumble. New Y.ork kicked to Starbuck, who retttrned th:e baH twenty yards .. Stewart made 15 yards, taking the ball to N. Y. U's three-yard line, but here was held. New York kicked out to Starbuck, who heeled the ball on the 45-yard line. Doran: made a pretty kick for goal, but .the bail missed, going unJ,er the bar by a few inches. The hall was brought out by N. Y. U. to the middle of the ft·eld and tl1en by cle-ver trick plays and a fine 20-yard run, c.arried the baH over for a touchdown. Goal was missed. Score: N. Y. U., 5; Union, 0. The half closed in a few moments. Secnnd half: New York kicked off to Hurlbut on the fiv-e- yard line and he returned the ball ten yards. In a few minutes N. Y. U. carried the ball to Union's five-yard line, but could get no further, thus los- ing the ball. Starbuck pun ted 30 yards and the ball was recovered by the Garnet on the 35-yard line. Statbuck gai'm~d ten yards on a quarterback run, and then Streibert carried the ball to center of field. Here N. Y. U. heLl and received the ball on downs. An attempted fnrward pass lost the ball to Union A forward :pass was used by Union for twenty yards, Kreig.sman made five and Strei- bert ten. Penalty of ten yards for hurdling. D. Brown received a thirty-yard forward pass from Starbuck on the twenty-yard line. Hequembourg ga·ined ten yarJs. Another forward pass here failed and N. Y. U. punted to center of field.

Garn2y --··-- Altl1ough the foot.ball season is over, it ~may not be am.iss to· consider for a mom·ent what has been accomplished the past season. Several men were lost by graJuation and much of the new material was inexperienced; thus, at the opening of colleg2, prospects for a first-class team were not very bright. However, Coach Murray started to get the men into shape. The first two ganres resulted in a tie, t:h e score in the Stevens Institute ga1ne being 0-0, and in the St. Lawrence ga.me 5-5. Then the squad, under the efficient gni:dance of the coach, worked with a will and tll'c result was a team which was fully the equal of Wesleyan, and which defeated Hamilton, for the first tilne in several years, by the cleci.sive score of 6-18. Although the score was 0-0, the game with \Veslcyan had all the effects of a vic- tory, for it showed. beyond a doubt that Union had a team worthy of the best f:jUpport.

The Hobart team was Union's opponent in the last hom·e ga.n1e of the Heason and proved to be an easy vicNm, Union scoring 39 points to Hobart's 5. 'The last game of the season, and what prove~r to be the fourth tie game of tlTe season, was played with .N. Y. U. at New York. Score, 5-5. During the season a total of eight games were played; four were tie game.s, two games were lost and two were won. Consid~ring the fact that the team was cripple·d by the loss of Captain Pot- ter early in the season, and Walser a little later, this is a 1nost satisfactory record and speaks well .fnr the efforts of Coach Murray.

THE CONCORDIENSIS I3 The Press Club held an important m·eeting last week. Considerable bus-iness was transacted. and valuable suggestions were made. President Potter appointed as 'the new buUetin committee Hill, '12, and. Trumbull, '12., whn had been serving in the capacity of head reporters. The .suggestion was· made that the Un·ion men from cliff'erent preparatory schools in the country should secure at the secretary's office pictures of the college campus, ha.ve them framed and pre- s·-'nt U1ese pictures to their resp·cctive scho~ols. In this way at a very small expense, Union College would be hrought constantly to the atten.tiO'n of men who are preparing to enter som:c college. There was also a discussion of the :plan of send- ing OHt news bulletins to variou.s preparatory school publications. President Potte.r reported that the club had had postal cards containing an·nounc·ements of the N. Y. U. game sent out to Union alumni living in New York city and in that vicinity. A committee wa.s appointed to see if arrange- men'ts could be made to h.ave '\The Concord:iensis\ sent regularly to the largest pre·pa.ratory and High Schools in this part of th'e country. Faust, '11, treasurer of the club, ma-de the monthly financial report.· Dr. Barnes urged all the members of the club to do personal work during vacations a.nd college recesses in getting fellows who are preparing for a co1lege course interested in Union.
