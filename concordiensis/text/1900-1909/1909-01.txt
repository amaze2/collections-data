M·oses Viney, who for nearly .seventy years has been a familiar figure about Union College, died at the Viney homestead on Lafayette St.reet 11 .o'cloc1{ .sun·day night. There is no .one a:bout whom more memories of bygone college days cUn.g than about this faithful and devoted negro. It is with sorrow that the Alu.mni will read of the death of 0~1e who has seemed to them to he a part of old Union herself. l\_~Jses, as he has been affe·ctionately known, rep- reEented the now nearly extinct type of :ol.d school c~lored man, w·ho as slaves had received their .. training du:ring the ante-bellum days-~a ty:p.e that w1 Hera such as F'. H·opkinson Smith recall in re- btLlg the quaint stories of their affection fer and devotion to the old families of the South. On March 10, 1817, Moses was born a s1•ave in a cabin in Tal-bot County, Maryland. He was the o de:~t of a fam.ily of twenty-one children. His early life as a slave was not unhappy, 1Jut being o,. an ambitious tem~perament and possessed of n1o1 e than ordinary native intelligence, he longed fJr freedom. His owner was a kind master, so 11·oses resolved th·at he would not endeavor to o'Jt 1.in his Ji.berty as long as cond·itions ren1ained Hnchanged. However, in antici-pation of es-cape from bondag-e, he took it upon himself to feed the Muses as their keeper, the dogs rushed up to him with an affecti-ona·te greeting, and at his command returne·d :to the p-lantation. After many and varied experiences the fugitive I ' slaves reached New York. F~rom there they sail·ed up the Hudson to Troy. W!hen they arrived at Scheneotady, :of the tnoney furnished them by friends but twenty-five eents remained. Moses was employed .at severa:1 different thfngs for a short tiine, and finally was engaged by Dr. Eliphalet Nott, Pre.siden t of Uni.on College, as a co:1~hman and messenger. His two com·panions also 0btained employment in the V·ieinity. It was in the services of Dr. Nlott that Moses became so popular. He came in contact with all the men, and his remarkable memory of their faces and n:1mes, years after, has always been a source of surprise to many Alumni. Moses often related incidents of college life in which the prominent sons of old Union figured conspicuously. Among them are President ·Chester A. Arthur and Fred- erick W'illiam Seward, son of ·Secretary of State Seward. A short time after entering the employ of Dr. Nott, when ·M(oses was driving past Given's Hotel (situated where the Edison Hotel is to-day), he saw his old master sifting within. Going imme- diately to Dr. Nott, ·he told him the .circumstances, bloodhounds and to win their affecUon }?Y kind- le·ttin.g him know for the first time that he was ness, thinking that in this way he m·ight be able a fugitive slave. Dr. Nott, as ev.er his friend and to elude the most dreaded of pursuers wh·en the benefactor, agreed to pay the purchase price' ·de- time for flight came. It was in the cap·acity of ·tutler that l\f.oses one day overheard his master n1aking arrangements to sell ·him, togeth·er with several of the other slaves. Final plans for es.ca,pe were imn1ediately made. With two companions, Mbses set out on Easter morning, 1840, for the N•orth. The alarm of \runaways\ was inevitable. Blood- hounds were s~et upon the trail. They pursued the fugit~ves and finally ran them down. Re-cognizing manded by the slave owner and gave M·oses the opportunity of refunding the amount in laboy. In th ~s way the sl·av·e earned his O'Wn freedom. Moses ren1ained a faithful and devoted servant of Dr. Nott uRtil the death of the famous educator in 1866. During the last few y.ears. of Pres'id-ent Nott's life 1he becam·e so dependent upon his serv- ~ant th:at Moses was in constant attendance, ann even prepared :his m·eals.

For many years his business flour- iS:hed, but owing to his advanced ~ge he was forced to retire about six years' ago. ·The personai inter-est shown .in him by the late 1\~rs. A. V. V. Raymond, and her desire that he .should still be identified with college tradition, were much .appreciated by M:oses. Great was hi's pleq,sure in looking forward to his .part at the President's reception at Commencement. He pre- sented a picturesque ap-pearance as, with a cour- teous bow, he opened the door to the arriving · guests. and repeated to the newcomers, \Ladies to th' Ieft, gen'lemen to th' right.\ It was a picture that will long be remembered by tho.se who have wa:tched for him fro·m year to year. Wlth the exception of last year, Moses has b~en seen upon the campus each Commencem-ent day for the past hai·f century. To shake him by the hand an.ct to have a word or two of conversation with him has been as. much a •pleasure for the Alumni as it has been to meet their classn1ates at the reunion. La.st year, although Moses did not get to the campus, he spent a few moments ~t the Alumni dinner that was held in the Armory. His absence from future Oommencem.ent days will indeed be felt 1by -the hundreds of Alumni who have known ·him personally and reminiscences of his li-fe in connection with the CoUege will be hande·d down for years to come. In the latter Y·ears of his life -Moses has been faithfully cared for by his sister, ·Mliss Lela Viney. The other surviving m·embers of his family are <:I to secure a. new gymnasium.

10 THE CONCORDIENSIS A FAULT. Editor of Con·cordiensis: I desire to e:x:press some thoug11ts that were called forth by the reading of an article in the i.:;sue of Decemr\ber 4, entitled \!At FaHlt.'' I think it iB· to be regretted that su•ch ideas a.s that article .contains ever found expression in a college publicati-on. It a.ppealed to me as the plea o.f the demagogure for the atbolition of our stand- ard of scho1arshjp; as an abusive attack upon those men in Union College who know the real purpose of attenJing college and who attend for that purpose. If I can gather any m~eaning fr.om wcrds, I get the irnpre~sion frDm that article that the man whose busine·ss is .study is a persona non o-rata in Union College. b Union College exists for the purpose of educa- tion. You cannot deny that. You 1nay treat the fact to all the sneering you like, ·but the fact re- mains. And the go.od of the college is the suc- cess it achieves in carrying out its pur:pose. The article in question states-: \No·w it Ls. evi- dent that there are some fellows that never think of the good of the eollege.\ I dare say it is. But I rather think the writer had in 1nind those stn- dents whose· business at Union is to acquire edu- cation. I should .say that they who never think of the good of the college are the one~ who are not making education their serious purpose. The article clairns that \they .are here just r.o get all they can ont of the place without re11Llering any- thing in return that is of any a.d. an~age.\ I deny it. Those men on whom this article casts a slur are the very ones who make tl:e retu1•n to the college, both now and later in the world, that is of ntmost ad·vantage to -pnion. The article say.s: \They are here to get all they can out of the course·S· ·offered.\ I am glad of it. What rea::;onable 1notive can a man have for tak- ing a course if not to get all he can out of it? W ~1y do you snp:pose courses are ever given in college? E.very man should get ·everything there is to be had in every course he tal{es, or else make a business ·Of staying away. One of the symptoms of the disease we h·ear of, called Am.erieanitis, is satisfacti.on wRh things· half .done, with half truths, with ha:If lig:hts or side lights. I fancy -it .is Rot ha.rd to point out s·ome chronie cases. It is :)Detter for such J.ne:n to go to sleeiP. Psy·chology teaches that sl,eep· is the original and normal enn- ·ill:Uion. 0 tha~t fNtch ·men were normal! Truly their last state is wors-e than the first. \Their main ambition is to graduate with a::; 1i.igh honors a.s .posg,fble.\ Why not? What oth.er ambition should The the main am:lJ.fti<ln? :f I gather the meaning. fro·m this quotation, it is that ihe culprits under condemnation are striving for honor merdy for the sa.ke of honor. I elu.arge that thi:s· is false. I wolilder if the author of the article :has really taken the trouble to •become acquainted with the men wen ev1ough to know their real pur- pose? T'heir purpose is to work; and to do worl\ well. If honor.s come, they come :a:B· a reward. J3ut I say that these men, and I know intimately a majority of the·m, are guided 1by t1le sense of .<Juty, and a deep reaHzation of the vahre o.f oppor~ tunity. There are men ·in lJnion College who have never 1\nown the experience of writing home to fatl~er :for m·on-ey. There a.re men who 'know not what it is to receive an allowance. There are men in Union College ·he·cause of the self-denial of a :m·other at home, thr-ough the vision of whose toil- ing hands and ach.ing heart, and through tlTe power of whose l)ra·yers they are applying· them·· selves diligently to their worl{, that they may show by their deeds their appreciati.on of what it all rnean.s· to them. .Are they to be condemned for it? There are men here who have no 1esources but themselves. They know what it costs them Picture Fra~ming--- Did she give you her Photograph ? Frame It/ THE GLEASON BOOK CO.

THE CONCORD1ENSIS 11 to b ~· here. Are they to he blamed for striving to get full value? \Th.ey never indulge in any of th.e c.ollege ac- tivities.''' I .say that this charge ·ca.Nnot be sup~ ported. Maylbe they do not take p.a.rt in every- thing, bout do you n·Dt sup1pose the-re i1s• a rea.son? They \are unsually .f.ound glue·d to their books.\ Better so, than to be :blown by the winds of folly and caprice down town to the ''''Crown\ or across Nott Terrace to the \E:mpire.\ '~When every man should 1be up and· doing fir his Alma M 1 ater,\ if the writer should take the trouble to lo.ok around he will find out that the poor -criminals are gen- erally on hand. \Snch 1nen have no Alma Mater, however much and loudly they may claim h'er after they have graduated.\ They who talk the loudest are not the ones who Jeliver the goods. The men whnm this article kno·cks generally do no boasting about their college in after lif'e in the w-orld. By the quietness of their conduct, by the fatthfulness ·Nith which their lives are lived, by their work done n.nbly and well, they bring everlasting honor to their Alma Mater, Old Union. \Attend the Y. M. C. :A1. meetings, the debating chubs.\ Tbey must be worth while attending or the article would not urge attendance. I have taken the pains to observe who attends such func- tions. You will generally fin.d these same \self- ish.'' \egotists\ there, and those who eriticitze con- s:picuous by their ahsence. The fault found with men crossing the football fi~ld is just, but the connection between this and the rest of the article seem:s• pretty clearly to 1be an atta·ck on some particular indi-vidual. I con- sider thiS' unfortunate. T'he whole article is illogi- cal and a discredit to the college. It is high time that matters -of scholadship were considered first. In an article by Dr. Hale in the Concordy published January 21, 19·08, we find th·ese words: \Wlhat is a student ·to do to-day? * * * Supp·ose he should reso-lve to learn S'Oinething, to educate himself, to develop his :powers and to be and to be known to be himself rather than a member .of any uni-versity, college, class, fraternity, association o-r anything ·else. Then we might see whether our colleges or uni- versities could give him what he wants. Then they would really be tested, and so would_ he.\ To he diligent in the pursuit ·Of studies is charged with heing ''a fault.\ Then. there are some of us in Union Co11e~·e who are glad t-o be at faNlt.

In addition .tG th.e body called the .Senate, whteh was described in these pages some timo ago, th.ere existed another organization amo·ng the members of the coHege, which was called the \H.ouse of Representatives of lJnion CoBe.ge.\ This asso:)ia- tron did not las·t. for as long a Hm;e as the Senate, being in existence only a·bnut seven years, ac- cording to the records. The rnember.s of this body wet·e m·~mbers of the junior class of the coUege. At the last meeti'ng of the third term in the year, the mernbers of the sophomore class were initiated as mem.bers of the House, and the members of the faculty and constituted a quorum f.or the transa·ctton of bus:i- ness. The chair had powor to appoint all cornnitte 3S, and from the first there were aThoHt twenty standing .committees, c-ons1sting of three mernb ers each. These committees wero caHed c<>m 1 mittees on fore-ign affairs, finance, commerce, suffrage, patents, pensions, m.anufactures, ngrlculture, and many other branches of governmentaJ topics. It was thair duty to prepare reports orr these differ- ent subject;::;, and bring them before the H!ouse, and also to bring forward bills in reg;ar:d to these and other matters for adoption by the House. These bills were given thrae reading;s before the House and in all meetings the bush1ess was car- ried on as nearly as posstble to the method fol- all graduates were honorary members of bne lowed in the national· House.

They were electod at the first regular meeting of each te1·m a.nd held <>ffice during one 'term. The election was by ballot, and a majority of votes cast was ne·cessary for a choice in all cases. At the fifth regular meeting of the s·aco!H1 term a valedi·ctorian was elected, and at the in- i-tiation of th·a sophomol e class the valedictorian delivered his address. Amendments to the constitution could be made by a two-thirds vote of the members prese.nt at a meeting, bu:t they had to be lai.d on th·a ta;ble for two weeks before any aetion could be taken co :1- cerning them. A majority of atte'nding mem·bers ten cents per man was levied on the me.mbers for buying the necessary books and stationery to be used by the House. At th·o close of the college year the members of the House were initiated as members of the S·en- ate for the next year and at this time a .senior editor of the Union College Magazin·~ was elected. During commencement week or about that time the House held an anniversary. The exercises were p·ublic and a pr{)gram was r€ndered. The Senate was invited to join in these exercises. During the whole tim·e that the House was in existence. Prof. R. B. Welch, D. D. LL. D.. was Speaker. Such an organization would undoubtedly be a great benefit to the members of the college, a~ I

i\ I 'THE CON:CORDIENSIS 7 THE ALLISON ... fOQT,E DE:B.ATE. Won by the Adel]>'lilics. In ·one of the Jn~os~t interes·ting Allison-Foo·te debates ever held on the ''Hiill\ the Adelphic So- ciety was awarded the prize over ~the Philomathe- ans on ~M~onday eve·ni·ng. Tll .. e ]lrize for the best individual speech was a w·ard,e:d to J·ames M. suc,h an abstruse subject dealt with in sucb an inte·llig)ent. man-ner before -a mixed audience. Hie also said that forty years ago, w·hen he was a ~'dldent in Union College and a member of the Philomathean Society, it would have been n~ext :to hnp·os.sible for the two ·societi·es to give such a·n inter-esting debate. Dunn, '12. The que;3tion for debate was, \Res-o1ved That the p·olicy of tariff for revenue on.'ly would serve the interests of the United Sltates better than the p.olicy of proteetion.'~ The Pbllom·a.thean team, com~:pos~ed of Bartlett; '10, R. J. Ory, '0'9 a;nd Cohen, '11, upheld the :affitrmative sH.-.e of the question. .. The Adelp·hic team, defending :the negative, ero-n- sisted of Wlachter ~ '<():9, Dunn, '12 and Mould, '09. Bartlett, in op,ening the de·bate, analyzed the question and stated the 1nain argume'n. ts for 1be affirmative, •which were: 'That a careful ·analysis ·of the ,question shows that the policy .of tariff f·or revenue o:n'ly i.s better than the policy ·of p·rotec.tion, That the result of a proteeUve p·olicy is of great benefit to the capitalist and of harm to the great laboring class·. That ·the .general we·lfare of the United S.tates is better pro·vided for under .a. policy o.f tariff for revenue only. Wj.ichter, in tbe opening stJe·ech for the nega- tive, laid the burde·n of p.r•oei on the affirmative and showed how much more ()Hr co-untry has been 1: enefited in times of protecti·on than in times when the prevailing •poUcy was that of tariff for revenu·e only. The affirmative· proved that while the avet~age wage per capita has increaseCI., the average cost of living has proportio~nately in.crea.sed, while the negative showed that ·a reduction of the tariff would throw out of e·m·ploy:rnent over 3,0·0·0,00•0 persons, engaged in the m.anufaotures. .

10 THE CON'CORDIENSIS DR. CADY'S LECTURE. On last Friday afternoon Dr. Cady delivered an~ other of 'nis series of po-pular lectures. There wa:s a l~arge num·ber of students and ·outside frie1:rts present. 1 The first two slides thrown on the screen were pictures of ancient portraits drawn by Gred;: colonists in Egypt. Dr. Cady stated that although there are very few Greek paintin;s wlhJ.ch are nDv.T in existence, those W'Dich have survived show that the Greeks were as skilled in the art of paintiRg as in the .art of sculpture. He then described tlh.e dis,eoveries 3.nd cxca va- tions of Dr. Pietri and lVIr. Theodore M. Dav:s. Several interesting slides were .shown of the arti- cles excavated by Mr. Davis in the Valley of L1e To:r::b3 of the Kings. One cf thG latest di.:: ~O'~-\ ?P- ies in this valley is that of the to:..nb of Quec~ TlhJy, one of the n:.:ost iDJI}Jortant queens in .:·ll F.lgyptian history. In her tornb were ale·o f01~:·.e1 many articles of furniture and much v.aluable j:~-x elry, for as Dr. Cady said, the Egyptians believ•C:. that the S'pirit would have need of all the articles which the 'hody ihad used during its lifetime. The LIBRABY NOTES. . During the past few weeks a large number of new books llilas been added to our libr.ary. The~0 'llave ~been ,catalogued and are now ready to b0 vlaced on the shelves. The additions whi·ch /have been :n1ade belong chiefly to the following d.epartmen ts: Biology and Geology, Philosophy, Cterrlistry, ·Civil and Elec- trical Engineering ~Vl:athemat.ics, ·Greek :and His- tory. The addition to !t':he P1~1iloso,phy Departrnent ~n v1hieh we are most interested is undoubtedly \A Theory of the Mlind,'' ·by Dr. ·Miarch. In the History Department the most valua.bie additions are two works on English history by Edw,a.rd Jenks, and two works 'bY Henry George ·hearing on United States /history, \Progress and I :Poverty\ and \PoliUcal Economy.\ ·T(he annual report o.f the Public Service Con1· n1issfon and the 28th annual report o: the :StatA Department o;f PubUc Health have alE,o iately been received. A few volumes of fiction and works of silr ... il1r ch.araeter have ·been added. ,Chief .among· these iR ''Tihe lVIystery of the Pickney Draught,\ by 'Ch1rles ornmnents and gold chains fJund in the ton1bs arE=- C.

Tl-IE CONCORDIE.NSIS 11 A MlDN,IGHT MEDITATION. There are two general ·classes of College Stu dents·; those who do the thing::; they \want\ to ,_:l.o nnd i~hG:s·e w·ho d.o the things they \ought\ tG do. Of eourse in doing the things they ''want''' to do. Lhe fc-rn;.er frequently do a gootl m.any things the.Y \ought\ to -do but they also frequently do a good many things they ought ''not\ to do. Likewise in doing tihe things they \ought'' to do, the latter freq_•uentily do a good many things they \want\ to do, nut they also frEquently do a good many things they do \not\ want to do. When the things a ·man \wants\ to do and those Lhat be \.ougjht\ to do are identie:al, he deserveb no c:redit f.or doing them; when a man does not \want'' to do the things he \·ought'~ not to do, he des€rVeB no ~credit for \not\ doing then1. It's. where a man \does\ the things he \doesn't want~' to do 'because he \·oug1lt\ to do therr;, and wller€ he \doesn't\ do the n:1ings he ''.wants\ to do because he ought \not\ to do them, that he WI::-.JS -hoth in college and out. Think it over. THE PRESS CLUB. A feature of the work of the club this term wil; be the writing of letters by th~ members with :-t vi·ew to getting men interested in \New Union.\ The club expects also to work in co-operation with the gymnasium C011\1mittee hel,ping the C0ID· l'Iii ttee in every way poss'ible. 1 Anotlher important feature of the work will be 1.1:J.e sending out of articles to 'be 1published in the 1-'a}Jers in an editorial way. Trilese articles are fo de.al with such subjects as the new gy1nnasiun1. tOIJics ·connected with the college.

THE CONCORDIENSlS 13 FRENCH CONVERSATION ·JN THE 17TI J CENTURY. BY F. W. SMITH. Prior to the year 15010 FreNchmen may be said to have showed largely that untamed northern tem.perament so notably exhibited by their fore- fathers. Their ni.anners wer·e uncouth and their morals· were upon a very low plane. More~over, the sexes were f~r from being ·on an equal footing: for wom,en were regarded as but little better than :the slaves of n1en. During the first half of the Seventeenth century, however, France enjoyed a con1parative respite from warfare, and thus an opportunity was given the peo·ple to indulge in. ,s,Qcial intercours·e and build up a polit~e soc.iety. This th·ey did with a rapidity and to an extent seldom- equaled. But peace alone could not 'have produced such a rap-id social transformation in a country. Two other i nflnen:ces in the character .of waves swept over France, le::tvin.g their imprint upon society and literature. The first of these waves came fro·m Italy, and n1.ay be called the classic. In contradi-s- tinction from thi.s migratory intellectual element was the influence exerted by S:panish literature and society, which were full of hig-h gallantry, which were ls.ngorous and platonic, studded with rom.antic ·heroes, pervaded by a lively sense of the beauty of na-ture, besides manifesting a fondness for mu·sic and elegant conversations. These clas.sic and romantic influences, acting simultaneously upon uncultured F'r.ench society,. produced side by si~e the serious and the Inirth- ful the gay and the sublime. The society and ' literature of FraU'Ce became in an almost incredi'bly city of Parts. It is conceded that for a num·ber of years one 'house in Pari-s was the center and .one coterie Ute source of what was ~considered par excellence in both speech and m.anner. The Hotel de Ram.;bouiHet, whose host·ess was La Marquise de RambouHlet, a lady of rank and refinement, beca:11 e fan1ous for its illustrious gatherings, tlile avowed purpose of which was to. inculcate polite- .ne.ss, to put a poiish on society and perfect ;it. Good manners and literary aspirations were .prirn.e requisites for· .admHtance to the select assemblages at the hotel. An aristocratic tone was easilJ establi.shed, since the majority of the guests were lords and high-torn ladies and were, therefore, frequenters of the court. Here were to be found the gre::tt lUerary lights of the century, Gorneill€, .Balzac, Micna.ge, Bossuet, Vorture, Vaugelas, Chap€- lain, together with rlVI\lle. S·cudery, Mttdame de Sevigne, M;adame de Lafayette and .Jul le D' Angennes. It was at the H'otel de Ram.bouillet that conver- sation re3ched its hi.ghest point as an art. Par- ticular attention wa.s given to the principles under- lying an in..teresting and profitable conversation, and when once agreed upon they were adhered to as strictly as might be consistent. Mlle. Scudery has ·concisely stated in what l'air-· galant of con ver- sation consists. She says: \I think l'air galant of conversation consists 1-:;rincipally in thinking about things in a Cl.elica te, free and natural manner; in leaning toward .gen- tleness and enjoyment rather than ·toward the serious and abrupt, and, finally, in speaking easily and unaffectedly, withal· in· suitable terms of every- thing. There must even be in the mind a eer~~i n inEinuatioR and flattery in order to charn1 the minds of other peo·ple, and if I would well express short :space of time classi-c and pastoral. Ladies and gen tle.men chose mythological names for them- selves, played the r·oles ·Of shepherds and con- versed like ,gods and goddes·ses. The spirit of chivalry wa·s likewise apparent. S.o·cial etiquette and the laws ·Of courtship and marriage were strongly marked by som.ething like the knight errantry that Cervantes is sa.id to have \laughed what I n1:ean, I would .aver that no one ean be wholly amiable without having l'air galant.\ L 'air galant may 'be c.alled an idiosyncrasy of French society of the :Seventeenth century, and no- where was it more prom.inent than among the habituees of the Hotel de R.ambouillet. There \Was l'ctir gctla1tt for everything. Its development 'WaS br·ought about chiefly by the ladies, under the lea;d- ership of ·Mme. de Rambouillet. out o.f 8pain.\ Society received its highest ·cultivation in the (TO BE C'ONTI~PED.)
