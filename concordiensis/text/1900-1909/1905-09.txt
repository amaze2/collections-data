I NEW ENGINEERING BUILDING. ·' Fine Structure . 1n Course of Erection Proud and staid Old Union! For a century sht> has .instructed the youth of our land to become good and useful citizens and has gloried in the massive gray walls in which she began hf'r bril- liant career. It has seemed sacriligious to disturb the ~ymm~totiy of her out'line, to crowd the beau- t\ful campus with grim unsightly buildings, but time has rna de it necessary for those 1vho have control of her destiny to begin the ei~eC'tion of a handsome ne\v building to accommodate her ever increasing .. classes of electrical engineers. In order not to make the present scheme inharmon- ious it was decided to begin building just above the Rappa Alpha house in the pretty lane leadjng to Lenox Road. Assistant Treasurer C. B. Pond was given full po\ver to oversee the work and with his accus- tom·ed energy has put a large force of men at work. The excavation for the foundation is now practically completed and the walls 'viii be bPgun at once. The urgent need of a suitable building for the laboratories has long been felt and it \Vas hailed with joy when the President announced that the Trustees had decided to set aside the amount re- quired for the building. For a long time Union College has been giving excellent instruction in Electrical Engineering courses in a very confined and insufficient space. She is now prepared to .offer to prospective stu- dents a course which will be without exception the finest given by any college or technical school in the land. The details and specifications of the new hall follow: The material used wiH be face brick of

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS g1ay with white trimmings Hne d with com1non brick selected for uniformity of color and light- ness of shade. The lintels are to be of iron and the floor in the south vestibu1e will be of white mar:bl'e chips with a 6-inch garnet border and in the other rooms of concrete except in the labora- tories, coat room, instructors T00In and draught- ing room whJ.ch will be of maple. guson. is a graduate of N ebra:ska University. In Chen'li,stry Dr. Ellery will have Mr. David Charles Caldwell of Middlebury College as an assistant in the laboratory work. The work in English has been changed and hereafter Mr.' Horace Grant McKean will act as assistant professo1.· in Public Speaking and Rhetoric. 'The ail.'rangement of rooms is as foUows: First iloor on the right as one enters is ~the East Labora- tory in which the transformers are to be placed. On the left the West Laboratory is located and there the Electro-Chemical Stati@n will be. One enters directly from the vestibule into the South Laboratory and just beyond is the ~iddle Labora- tory off of whtch are the coat and toilet rooms. The ell, 35x74 feet, contains the North Laboratory. 'The second floor contains the large well-lighted Draughting Room 73x27 feet, and the store and Instructors rooms. Only the best obtainable material will be used and it is confidently expected that the new build- ing will be gladly received by all the students and by the other old walls which have known and loved the tread of many distinguished m:en, and Ol which hallow the traditions of the past. Changes of Faculty A Noteworthy Election There ·Occurred, last Tuesday afternoon, a class election which should have a :place .of its own in our college history; so unusual was its en-tire course. The election which so moves us was that held for senior president. The election of senior president is usually attended with politics enough to make a Tammany henchman open his eyes in wonder. With but one candidate, politics are of necessity a minus quantity. That was the case this year. But one candidate was put forward, resulting, of course, in a unanimous election. It was the sam:e in respect to the other offices. Th.e officers elected were: President, A. C. Chapman; vice-president, E. M. Dann; secretary, J. G. Webb; treasurer, R. D. Sherman. On taking the chair, Mr. Chapman appointed B. W. Reed anq. J. L. Moon as cltJ.eer leaders for the fall games. Repai;rs to Laboratories Professor Ellery is very enthusiastic about his laboratory. \The best place this side of Heaven,'' he says. He has every reason to be proud. The lecture room has been greatly changed. The old benches have been replaced by eighty new chairs. Paint has added greatly to the appearance of the room. The space under the raised seats, where last year there vvas a junk heap, has been :fitted up for a stock room. The large middle room has undergone a still greater change. The old hood has disappeared and in its place is a new one uniform with the others, New desks for experiments have been Th€ new year finds a number of changes in the faculty. Dr. Wright has retired; Prof. Neil Wil- liams has again entered the empl0y of the Gen- eral Electric Company. Prof Ed,vards will re- turn as soon as his health allows. We also notice the absence of Instructors Van LooH and Cunning- haiTI, and Messrs. Young and Mansfield. There are, however, seven new men, three of whom will act as instructors in Civil Engineering: Mr. R. La,vrence Spiller, a graduate of the Columbia School of Mines; Mr. J. W. Hughes, a graduate of West Virginia University; Mr. S. E. Weber, a graduate of the Pennsylvania State College. Mr. Walter M.. Curtis of the Massachusetts Institute of T€chnology will act as instructor in the depart- ment of Mechanical Engineering, while Mr. Olin J. Ferguson, late of the General Electric Company will assist in Electrical Engineering. Mr. Fer- . added and at ea.ch end of these is a sink, thus doing away ·with the sink which stood in the cen- ter of the room last year. The new desks give a space of four square feet for each man; last year

THE CONCORDIENSIS a space of only two square feet was allowed each man. New apparatus has been added for experi- ments. The inner room is to be used entirely, for quali- tative analysis and it has locker room fo.r 46 men. The new reagent bottles are the best that could be obtained. Professor Opdyke says that he is very much pleased with the changes in the Physical labora- tory. The seats have been raised and are very rnuch the same as those in the Chemical labora- tory except that they hav.e a back stairway which will do·u btless be appreciated by the fellows when the room is darkened. There has been but little change in the other rooms, except that new instruments have been purchased for experimental purposes. Library Repairs During the early suminer some very welcome additions were made to the 1ibrary equipment. New table lights were .installed last June. The small tables are provided with one, and the big tables with two standards, each bearing two lights, while the center reading table has a standard bearing four lights. Each light has a thick green shade, the arrangement thro·wing more light on the table than could be obtained before. The second addition was a large clock of the Seth Tho:tnas make. The new timepiece hangs directly over the entrance, where it may be seen easily from all parts of the library. Y. M. C. A. Reception On Friday Evening last the College Christian Association gave the customary reception to the Faculty, students and ministers of the town to meet the Freshmen class. The reception was well attended and was a very enjoyable affair. Those present were entertained during the early part of the evening by a concert on Mr. Pond's phonograph. Following this college songs were sung, with \By\ Reed as leader. President Raymond introduced the speakers with a few appropriate remarks for each. Dean R:ipton was the first on the list, and he welcomed. those present, and the new students in particular,. on behalf of the Faculty. Dr. Lunn of the First Reformed church followed with a few 1vords of welcome from the clergy of the city. Capta-in Davi:s spoke of the work to be done in football, of ' the victories to be \Von, and the way to win them. Captain Rider spoke of the coming baseball sea- son and what Old Union is going to acco'm!plish in that line. Captain Wald,ron presented the sub- ject of track athletics and the necessity of trah1- ing now. \Doc\ Towne talked on athletics in general and track athletics in particular. Leader Reed represented the Glee and Instrumental Clubs and urged the men to come out. President Waldron concluded the speaking with some re- marks on the work which the Christian Associa- tion is trying to do and asked the support of the students in this worthy cause. After light re- freshments the guests departed. Musical Clubs Seldom if ever in the history of the Musical As- sociation has there been brighter promise of a successful season. Only one man is lost to the clubs through graduation and the Freshman class has already brought in me11 of ability, including at least two good high tenors. The Instrurnen tal Club ought to make a record for itself, for at present, five mandolins, four violins and a flute are registered from the Freshman class alone,. and no one is lost ot last year's club. R1egular rehearsals will begin at once, the first coming on Monday evening at 7 P. M., for the Glee Club alone. Manager Newbury promises a bunch of trips, and is already corresponding con- cerning them. The College Quartette loses Spier, '07, the first tenor, and will have to fill his· place from the en- tering class. If the right man can be fotU1d, the quartette will give several concerts by itself as it did last year. The leader of the clubs is confident that the sea~ son ahead will outstrip all previous ones, both in success and in enjoyment.

8 THE ~CONCORDIENSIS College Opening College was form\erly opened Thursday, the twenty-first, when the :first chapel e:xerci:ses were held and the three upper classes made thei.r first recitations. The chapel services 1ve:re conducted, as usual, by Dr. Raympnd, assisted by Dean Ripton. There was a large attendance, th4·s year's student body filling up the chapel :better than it has been for several years. The facul~y was also wel!l repre- sented. After the opening hymrr'l,. Dr. Raymond gave a very able talk on \Aggressive Honesty,\ in which he cordially welcomed the old students an dthe new, and giving the latter some excellent and well- timed advice as to their ·conduct in relation to the college life. He said that the man who holds the deepest respect of other eo:llege men is not the best student, nor the best athlete, nor even the man who is good throlil.gh having no vices, but is the man who is right aU through and is willing to stand up for his prindples. The man who be- lieves in fair play for all and who, when he con- ceives a thing to be right, supports that at every cost. This is the man who is not merely honest having been given, both sides advanced. rrhe usual missles were thrown from each. side; from the Sophomores ba3.rs of salt, from the Freshmen decayed tomatoes, ancient eggs and other soft matter. After the preliminary battle the cane was thrown by Captain Dann of the footbail:l team. Both sides rushed again but the struggle was of- . short duration. The sweet perfume arising from the mass almost stifled even the judges, who, to p:rotect themselves, ~called an early halt. After the count, there was great rejoicing in the camp of l908, for the score was 1'908-16 hands, 1909- 10 hands. Thus ended the cane rush. Law School Notes The opening exercises of the Albany Law School were held Wednesday morning. Prayer was offer- ed by the Rt. Rev. Bishop D-oane, and addresses were delivered by J. Newton Fiero, dean of the faculty, Chancellor Raymond of Union University and General Amasa J. Parker. Judge James F. Tracey was also present and spoke a few words of farewell to the students and faculty. Owing to the death of Judge Judson S. Landon enough not to cheat himself, but \aggressively and the resignation of Judge Tracey two changeb honest\ enough to con.deiDn cheating in others. will be mlade in the faculty. Judge Tracey has The Cane Rush. Friday last was an ideal day for that annual scrap, the cane rush, which usually takes place during the first college week. Early in the morn- ing the Sophs began to rally and lay plans for successfully carrying the day. Chapel over. reci- tations began for some of the Fresh1nen, for others a quiet request to pack salt, a struggle, and then the cold interior of the gas house. The Freshmen, heardng of the captivity of their com- rades rushed to the rescue. Half an hour was devoted to a good old time scrap and then a truce until four-thirty in the afternoon was decided upon. At that hour, the Sophomores, accompanied by .a mob of boys, alike admirin.g and condoling, re- been a lecturer on corporation law at the school for a number of years and will be succeeded b~r Frank White. Judge Tracey leaves soon for the Philippines where he has been appointed a Judge of th.e Supreme Court. For many years Mr. White was at the head of the corporation la-vv di- vision in the office of the secretary of state and is well fitted to hold the position to which he has been appointed. The successor to Judge Landon, lecturer on evidence and constitutional la·w has ' not as yet been appointed and will not be for som._~ time. It is impossible to give the exact numbp ~ of men in the two classes yet, as all of the Seniocs are not back and there will be further additions to the Junior class, which up to date nun1heri::l about fifty men. Sixteen new members have ·n- ]paired to the Elms in the '~Cow Pasture.\ The tered the Senior class. A full list will be given Freshmen appeared in due season and, the signal next week.

THE 'CONCORDIEl\SIS II about to spend at Union will be as pleasant and fruitful to you as they have been to n1any who have gone before yon. But that depends npon you; your college course, as well as its results, wiH be [argely what you make of it. Fro1n the heginning, :get into college affairs as if you were a part .of thern, as you sureiy are. Don't stand one sidle and . gaze upon the doings of the other classes as if you were having a strange glimpse of life upon another planet. Learn the college custo1ns and be the first to perpetuate the1n. Learn the college yells and songs and lend your voices to the work of cheering for ancl pra'ising our college. Get into all the college activities that you can: you probably are not all athletes, but athletics are not the whole aitn of the col- lege life. Some of you n1ay already covet college honors. This is well enough, but do not let that be your aim. Let your ability to obtain such honors be n1easurecl by the activity with which you enter into your col- lege career. But above all things, in relation to your college life, ren1ember that you are now sons of Old Union. Re1ne1nber that tnanv . ~ illustrious and successful men have be- longed to that san1e class; re1nen1ber that it is up to you to do your share towards keep- ing up the standard, and that, in so doing, you have a mighty hard row to hoe. There has been considerable zeal shown by the under classes in the recent scraps, mostly con1rnendable. If a class gets into a scrap well at the start, it has the promise of a future. It shows that the men have good class spirit, which requires but Httle labor to turn into excellent college spirit. doubt if we ever encountered a n1ore cheer- ful and pleasant diversion than was present- eel by the ancient and time-worn eggs and incubator supplies which were served bv the freshn1en along with their custo1nary diet of rotten ton1atoes. The effect produced was most disagree- able, to spectators and participants alike. We saw one frosh who caught an egg by accident, re1noving portions of the san1e fron1 his n1:outh, eyes and hair and trying t'J look pleasant withal. The co1nbined effect was startling. Such actions do not mark college men. They are n1ore the work of children. Fortunately this year was the first experien,ce. We pray that it may Le the last.

First Vesper Service As has been his custom in the past President Raymond spoke to the incoming class at the first Vesper service. Dr. Raymond spoke on the opportunities for struggle offered by college life and brought out the facts that it is only by con- tinual strife that an individual keeps his level or makes any advance in his physical, mental and moral life. \The moral life,\ he said, \Is develop- ed only by keeping Christ and the life he led al- ways in mind.\ But sometimes this zeal over-carries and becomes annoyance and even worse, which never can be turned into college spirit. This was the case with the freshmen in the late cane rush. They doubtless meant well; let us give them that credit. They meant to create a diversion-and thev did. For -vve \' Cornell has raised its tuition rates in the en- gineering course from $125 to $150.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS HON. J\tJDSON S. LANDON. Union lost a true and loyal friend in the death of the Hon. Judson S. Lamdon, which occurred at his home in this city, September 7. Death came as a result of a serious operation., !from which he failed to rally. It seems fitting that m·ention be made of the life which, for so many years, has been insepar-- a hly linked with our college, which he loved with the love of a son and to \Vhich he gave some of the best years of his life. Judge Landon was born in Salesbury, Conn., December 16, 1831. Receiving a eornmon school education, he entered Yale in 1854, studying law there for one year. In 1855, while principaJ of the Princeto''Tn Academy, of this county, he re- ceived the degree of master of arts from Union. In 1856 he was admitted to the J:>a,r and [n the same year he was elected district attorney of this county. In 18 65 he was appointed -county judge to fill a vaeancy. Judicial honors still followed him, and in 18 7 3 he was elected justice of the Suprem•,e Court. In 1887 he was re-elected with- out opposition. In 18 91, Gov. Hill appointed him a judge of the Court of Appeals. In 1899, Gov. Roosevelt appointed him again to this position. --·============= Remarks at this time of the year about the Christian Association -can at best be little more than one hopes :fo{' the future. The success O·f this future depends som·ewhat on the officers hut chJefly 011 the support the fellows give us. Let this support be strong and may good college spirit be the keynote to all our work this yea.r. Alumni '3@.-'The death of Samuel N.

Kanouse died at the home of his son-in-law, Dr. John L. Taylor, at Boonton, N. J., Aug. 5, 1905. He had been in poor health for some time and it is thought that the news of the death of his son-in-law, John T. Post, hastened his end. Mr. Kanouse was born at Boonton, N. .J., Feb. 11, 1811 and was the son of Abraham and .Elizabeth Low Kanouse. He received his pre- liminary education in the public schools of his native town and in the private school of Ezra Fairchild and the Bloomfield Academty. After teaching some years he entered the Junior class of Union CoHege and graduated in 1832. The fol- lowing year he was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Mr. Kanouse was engaged in mercan- tile pursuits for thirty-eight years after gradua- tion. In 18 4 9 and again in 18 51 he was elected For years, Judge Landon had been a trustee of the college and from 1884 to 1888, he stepped into the breach and was its acting president. He was also a teacher and trustee of the Albany Law School. Fte received the degree of LL.D. from Rutgers in 1865. His was a noble life, reflecting honor upon him- self and the institution with which he was so closely associated. His services to the college were great and words are insufficient to express the gratitude and esteem held for _him by all sons of Union. Christian Association a member of the state legislature and there lab- ored to secure larger appropriations for the sup- port of the public schools and prepare the way to make them free. He was elected superintendent of public schools in Pequannock township in 1847. For three years he was a director of the Morris County Board of Freeholders and in 1872 was elected Associate Judge of Morris County, which offi.ce he held for five years. Mr. Kanouse was a Whig and cast his first vote for Henry Clay in 18 32. Upon the organization of the Republican party he became a warm advocate of its princi- ples. His published works consist of a history of the public schools of the townships of Pequan- nock, MontvHle and Boonton and a history of the VESPER SERVICE: Dr. Lm1n of the First Refoi'Ined Chut~ch will speak Sunday.

Foreign Correspondence With efficient coaching and the very best of discipline, the nine was one of which all sons of Union should justly be proud. Last season the coaching was a new departure. The custom of engaging a professional player as a .coach has given rise to much unfavorable comment for many years past and the new system which was tried last spring had a decided advantage over the old :mjethod. Under the able training of Dr . Towne and Mr. Cunningham, the team developed rapidly and played a steady, consistent game from the start. Great credit is due Captain Paul . .f. Hagar for . his unselfish and tireless efforts in the interest of the team and the college itself. He ,is to be cor- dially congratulated on the fine showing which both he himself a.nd his fellow players made.

Both alumni and undergraduates are highly pleased at the creditably showing made by . the Garnet baseball team last spring, which proved to be one of our most successful seasons in that line of athletics. and every man acquitted himself in a manner highly cmnmendable.
