A song let us sing as we leave the old Hill And together we go on our way, For ·the }Jfe that is passing so merrily still Vv e cannot be leading for aye. To Comrades we'll give what may be the last word. And to Union we'll bid sad adieu, Dut no farewells we'll make for in spirit we'll take Alma ~later and Classmates too. ·Chorus For in Nineteen Three we are all of us Union's sons, And a Naughty Three man can't forget Alma Mater while life's course runs. No matter where struggles may lead us at last \Ve'll think of the days that belong to the past And whatever we'll be, It will be Naughty Three- Union, Naught Thrae urging on. A. H. K. '03. JAMES YOUNG SPEAKS IN SILLIMAN HALL. James Young, the well known and popular actor, who appeared in the role of Joabin ~irs. Fiske's \Mary of Magdala,\ last Thursday evening at the Van Curler, delivered an in- teresting and instructive lecture before an ap- preciative audience at Sillin1an hall in the ··or\ afternoon on '' A Defence of Shylock.\ 1'Ir. Young is well known as a student and critic of Shakespeare. He has acted several characters of Shakespeare, notably ''Hamlet\ and ''Shy- lock!' Mr. Young in his lecture did not talk about \The Merchant of Venice\ as a play, but about the characters-the emotional qualities of the leading actors. He spoke in brief as follows : what Shakespeare has made him. Shylock is the most honest and sincere of an the charac- ters of the play. He has been looked upon as a monster, but he is exact and honest in his dealings. vVhen the play is studied very close- ly, it will be seen that Shylock is not nearly as bad as he is thought to be, nor is Antonio as good and generous as he is believed to be. '' The ~.fer chant of Venice is one of the most finished of Shakespeare.'s plays. It is I pre-eminent among plays .. -_ The time that the play represents is the most prosperous epoch in the history of Venice, and bankers were necessary. T'he scene is at noon, the busiest time of the day. All venturers want to lend money frorn the bankers. Antonio insulted and spit upon Shylock when he first met the aged Hebrew. Jews, at that time, according to the laws of Venice, were forbidden to en- gage in any business except that of a money lender. SllyloGk felt as though he was an outcast fro1n society. 1-lis great hopes in his daugh- ter were shattered and he was a crushed man. The 3,ooo ducats were given to Antonio \Vith- out interest and bond, because Shylock wanted to get the good will of the influential Antonio~ 'Vas the bargain as to the_ pound of flesh made in the spirit of vindictiveness or that of a jest? In whatever way Shylock tnade the bond, there is no doubt but that Antonio and his friends took it in the fonn of a joke. Antonio invited Shylock to supper, not as a n1atter of friendship, but to lure the aged Jew away from his home, so that Antonio's friends might rob him and spirit away his daughter. 'Ihe tim-e · for the return of the 3,ooo ducats catne around and it assumed a serious aspect. Portia came to the court room disguised as a lawyer and· ''The true conception of Shylock is not coached by the best legal talent. Shylock did not get justice ; the forfeiture of his property

They tried unworthily and cowardly to make Shylock a Christian. 1'he aged Jew had nothing to sustain h:tn, since all his property had been taken from him. He had left his religion only. Antonio had robbed Shylock not only of his 3, ooo ducats and all of his property, but also of his daughter. Were not Antonio and Portia the guilty ones ? Shylock was an ill used man, a member of a despised race.. He was called a dog and re- peatedly insulted. Should he not take ven- geance on his tormentor? He was not harsh ; he was the product of age. He was hated by Antonio because the aged Jew worshipped J e- hovah in the ancient way. Shylock was a tender father and devoted husband. He was a religious and upright man. disturber and destroyer of tic peace and happiness.\ Antonio was the Sh vlock 's domes- \ SEVENTIETH ANNUAL CONVEN- TION IN THIS CITY OF PSI UPSILON. • · Delegates representing the Psi Upsilon fra- ternity will gather in this city on May 13, 14 and 15, to attend the seventieth annual conven- tion of that organization, which was founded in this .college. After the registration of the delegates, on their arrival Wednesday evening, May 13, there will be an informal ''smoker\ at the house of the local chapter, and business sessions will take place in the morning and afternoon of the succeeding day. In the evening, a theatre party at the Van- Curler opera house has been arranged for, to be followed by a reception and dance at the chap- ter house. rrhe last executive session is to be ' held on Friday morning, when the convention photograph will be taken and the usual collation served. The delegates are to visit the works of the General Electric company in the afternoon of this day, spending their time going through the wonderland embraced in the great plant of that concern . The delegates to the conven\tion ~pl join with the members of the Psi Upsilon Alumni association of Northeastern New York in a banquet at the Ten Eyck, Albany, when the toastmaster will be Hon. Timothy L. Wood- ruff and the list of speakers will include Gover- nor Benjamin 13. Odell, Jr., Senator Chauncey M. Depew, Herbert L. Brid~eman of the ex,e- cutive council, the Hon. John Clinton Gray of the state court of appeals, the Hon. Frede- rick 'V. Seward, the Hon. John B. Stanchfield and John Kendrick Bangs. The delegates to the convention will doubt- less have· an enjoyable time during their stay in this city, and every effort will be made to make their visit a memorable one. 'I' he co~r­ tesies of the University club have been extend- ed to them. .. EGYPTIAN ENGINEERING. When the ''laudator temporis acti\ wants to silence the engineer, he says : ''After all, Egypt can show the biggest engineering works in the world, and they are all 4,ooo years o~d. When you can surpass them, you will have something to boast of.\ It is undoubt'ediy true that Egypt contains the largest structures in the world, and probably will for all time. It is not likely that we shall again see a build- ing with 7, ooo, ooo tons of stone in it, as has the pyramid of Gizeh, and it will be long be- fore we have an irrigation reservoir of greater capacity than Lake Moeris, which, accepting the figures of Major Brown, R. E., held in I I, 8oo, ooo, ooo cubic meters (tons) of water between high and low water marks. What the Labyi·inth was like we do not really know, but Herodotus classed it as a greater wonder than the Pyramids, although lesser than Lake Moeris. •

THE OONO'ORDIENSIS. 7 THE GARNET. Further, there is a tradition that in the dim : past the Nile flowed at the foot of the Libyan hills, and that it was diverted from that course into its present bed and, if the account be true, the work was of enormous magnitude. The ,engineers of the past directed the forces of nature on a large scale, but, continues En- gineering, to compare their work with ours to onr advantage shows a complete ignorance of the science of engineering. The matter in which they excelled was the transportation and n1ani pulation of heavy weights, a feat that appeals strongly to the law of in1agi11ation. Among the chief exan1ples of such work are the columns of the Temple of l(arnak. To cut a block of stone in a distant quarry, to work it to a cylinder 12 feet in diameter, float it do\vn the Nile, land it and place it on the top of a column of similar stones, making a total height of 6o feet, was no small enter- The 1904 Garnet, the 49th in the series, n1.ade its appearance last week, and is a credit to the editors who have worked hard and earnestly to bring it to completion. 'fhe fol- lowing is a list of the men composing the 1904 Garnet board : J. T. Putnatn, editor-in-chief ; S. C. Fiero, business manager ; E. V. Mul- Ieneaux, secretary ; R. W. Clar~, literary edi- tor ; T. G. Cowell, art editor ; \V. C. 'Treder, athletic editor; \V. B. Watson and E. Green.- nlan, assistant editors; L. W. Irish, assistant art editor. The following men represent the Albany Law and ~1edlcal fraternities, and acted as assistant editors : P. L. ~1erri­ n1an, A. 'f. Davis, R. E. Ni1nmo, H. L. Loop. A metnorial page has been inserted in memory of Gulian Lansing and .A.rthur Lee Benning. This year's Garnet is handsornely bound in cloth, garnet and black, with gold lettering . The volume is dedicated to Benjamin H. Rip- ton, Ph. D., LL. D., dean of the college : \ To one whose quiet hutnor, kindly interest and loyal devotion to our Alma Mater have endeared him to all the sons of old Union.\ 'l\'his issue of the Garnet differs fron1 former ones in respect to the large an1ount of space devoted to the departments of the university located in Albany, Law, 1viedicine, Pharmacy and Dudley Observatory. Photographs of members of the junior classes of the college and the law school are reproduced. Consider- able space is deYoted to literature and there are several clever sketches and rhytnes. . prtse. A still· more difficult undertaking was the great obelisk now standing beside the Church of St. John Lateran, in Rome, with a height of ro8 feet, and a weight of 450 tons. But the crowning exatnple of Egyptian engineering was the- colossal statue of Rameses II., at Thebes. Before it was broken it was a single block of red granite 6o feet in height, and it has been cotnputed to weigh 887 tons. These were notable examples of engineering work, and a modern engineer might be proud of ex- ecuting them. :But it must be remembered that they were done very leisurely, and that labor was abundant, With the simple appli- ances that we may assume the Egyptians pos- sessed, such as wedges, levers, ropes, and pulleys, great weights may be handled if we suppose that the time was no object. The City of Thebes was in course of building 2, ooo years, and in such a place it would excite little comment if a year was spent in putting an obelisk in position. If a weight can be moved at all, no tnatter how little, it can be transported any distance, provided the same conditions persist for the whole ro11te. COLUMBIA~ UNION. Union n1et defeat at the hands of Columbia last Saturday. To be defeated, however, by such a team as Columbia sends out is by no means a disgrace. At the end of the second inning it looked as if the visiting tean1 might be held down to a close score, but at the beginning of the third the boys in blue began \h~tting it out~\

8 THE OONC'ORDIENSIS. Hagar's home run a11d a score by Rider on a hit by Mahar ia the third inning raised the hopes of the h. orne team which were doomed to be crushed in the fourth inning by Columbia's score of twelve runs. In the fifth inning the ''blue stockings'' were again held, scoring but one run, while Union pounded out three runs to her credit. Columbia then made another spurt and ran up six more runs_ in the sixth in- ning, one being a home run by Frambach, while the \Garnet '' faBed to score. In the seventh and last inning- Columbia's career was again checked, only scoring one run, while Rider and Griswold tnade flying trips around the diamond, adding two n1ore runs to Union's score.

THE SLIP. ' The relations of the doctor to the patient were known to none. The former, a middle- aged n1an, with kindly eyes, iron-gray hair and tapering fingers of steel, was consulting sur- geon in the great Sans Souci hospital. His position had been won after years of earnest research and the successful performance of delicate operations. He was well known;- that is, in so far as his profession led him, on the dark side of life as well as the bright;-he was recognized as a man of wonderful energy, great daring and success in surgery and a kind man personally. Beyond this however little could be ascertained of his inner life.. He was unmarried. Those who knew hirn best could never account for his n1anner at times and seek as they would to read his past, not a line of it could they decipher. Sometimes in mo- ments of inaction, a sadness, mingled with a look of resignation seemed to come over him and then his face would. be drawn into hard lines of determination and his thin straight rips would tighten with sternness. Such was the doctor. The patient, who had been b,r.ought i1;1 that day, lay on the white cot in the ... : ~ • f !

His case was critical. A great tumor of the left breast had eaten its way inward and was gradually ·mould- ering its way into his lungs and heart. In it- self, the growth was beautiful; a 1narble hen1i ... sphere interlaced. with a tneshwork of blue veins, but its contrast with the pallid hue of the patient's breast was sickening. An opera- tion was necessary and that itnmediately. 'fhe diagnosis being tnade, the consulting surgeon ordered the patient to be prepared at once for an operation. An hour later the sick man lay on the table, surrounded by white-cap- ped nurses, white aproned attendants and young doctors. To one side stood a table on which were strewn various instruments; tro- cars, scapulas and amputating knives. '·fhe patient, who had been refused chloroform, lay moaning gently. The air was saturated with the odor of disenfectants. There was a 1 ull in the whispered conversation in the room when the surgeon came for·ward. It was no new task for him. Years of such work had harden- ed his nerves and steeled his hands. He walk- ed to the instrutnent table and selected a long, delicate knife, he dipped it in an antiseptic solution and stepped briskly towards the opera- tion table. \Vithout hesitation he drew down the sheet frotn the man's breast and disclosed the tumor. After determining his course he proceeded with the operation. \Vhen nearly through, he looked closely at the patient to see how he was standing it; he seetned to be quiet enough but the surgeon gasped and his hand tre1nbled. l-Ie saw in the patient -the sick man lying before him-the 1nan who had ruined his hopes; who, years be- fore, without provocation had blasted his life by turning traitor to his friend and seducing the woman he loved. The surgeon had never forgiven him and had long waited for vengance. Now he 4_ad his enemy before him,-at his me~cy.......-but, -ah, the though~ flashed through his brain--his· enemy was down and sick unto death. 'Vith fiercely surging emotions and a hand not too steady, but with a determination in his eye the greatsHrgeon cut deeper until he grazed the very life springs of the patient. Suddenly, however, his nerves gave way; he saw the woman he loved, far in the past; a mist came to his eyes, he struggled inwardly with himself; his knife clasped in his trembling hand slipped from its course and in a moment was driven deep in the patient's heart. Those who saw it said it was an accident. Perhaps it was. KAPS ENTERTAIN. The K.appa Alpha society entertained a small party of friends in their lodge on the evening of May rst. Dancing was enjoyed until the \ wee sn1all hours \ of the morning. Light refreshments were served at miqnight. Those present \vere : Dr. and Mrs. H. L. To\vne ; the Misses Linn, Lawrence, vVhi tlock, Mary Button, Gates, Helena l(riegstnann, Anna IC.riegsmann, Bates, Miss R.o barts of Glens Falls, Miss Griffith of Albany and the Messrs \V. C.

One of the interesting features of alun1ni day, June 9, will be the reunion of the mem- bers of the class of '63. This class, n1any n1embers of which have become well known in their various professions and business careers, was the last of the larger classes for years. 1'he Hon. Amasa J. Parker of Albany, and Charles L. Easton of New York, are the com- mittee in charge to bring that well known class together on that day.

Address all communications to THE CoNCORDIENSIS Union College, :Schenectady, N.Y. The Financial Ca1ls for money are becoming so fre- Situation. quent that the students pay little or no attention to them. Now this is a seri- ous question. It is all very well for those who are back in their subscriptions to smile cynically if their eyes chance upon this artide, but if they are men they must acknowledge tbat it does not in the least overstate the case. Much critkism is heard on the way in which certain departments 0f athletics are being conducted but the prompt and spontaneous pledge to. pay at an early date is too infrequent. Let every man in college treat this matter with the seri<msness which it deserves. Rally . to the support of your college ! If you are unwilling to do that you do n~t be'long here. Let there be less expenditure of energy in lobbying for favorite candidates for college honors and more straightforward and man· ly co-operation.

Now that the burden of authority in college matters is rapidly being transferred to your shoulders, we of the class of 1903 wish you god·speed and good success. Only a few short weeks and you will be seniors, while we alas will go out from the dear old haunts which we have loved so well never to return to them again in the role of undergraduates. This is no valedictory, yet we bid you to profit by our mistakes, where you can discover them, and learn from our suc- cesses. Altho' small in numbers, you have a strong roster of men. With mingled regret and comfort, then, we leave the future to you: regret that we are so soon to join the ranks of graduates and comfort that so capa· ble a class succeeds to our cares and duties. COLLEGE- MEETING The meeting opened with class yells for 1903 from all the classes. After a short titne the Seniors rose and with Grand Marshal Griswold leading, marched and counter marched, sing- ing the class song, while each of the other clas- ses moved to the seats occupied by the next higher class. Next followed another round of cheers from the other classes, which was heartily answered by yells for r 904, r 905 and 1 go6 on the part of the seniors, and also by a class yell for Olnl- sted, President of the Junior class. Led by Delbridge, the Seniors then followed the usual custom by singing \allowit inter- spersed with College cheers and songs and .then in single file tnarched from the chapel again singing the Senior song. Pres. Olmsted took the chair and entertain- ed the usual motion to adjourn. After adjournment the entire student body assembled on the bleachers and Mgr. Tillott of

'fhen forming in single file with locked step the line of march was taken up across the cam- pus to various recitation rooms and on the way Dr. Hoffman, Mr. Edwards, Mr. March, Dr. Hale, Dr. Ripton, Dr. Curtiss, Mr. \Vheeler, Prof. Ashmore, and other members of the faculty were greeted with cheers and calls for speeches. Several classes were given \bolts \ by their respective professors. The morning was largely occupied with simi- lar expressions of good feeling between the classes, the students marching down town in line about 9 o'clock. The enmity between freshmen and sophomores was finally ended. The significant custom of painting the idol white being performed about 11 o'clock. The letters 'o7 were left on the pedestal of the idol to be effaced next fall by the first coat of green paint to be laid on by hapless members of the incoming freshman class. The celebration of this old college custon1, while largely impromptu, was by far the most successful of any of recent years, and will be one of the n1ost potent factors, in the cultiva- tion of a more hannonious class feeling and a more loyal college spirit. CAMPUS NOTES. Prof. B. H. Ripton, LL. D., dean of Union college, and a graduate of Syracuse University, responed to the toast \ The Other Fellows\ at the third annual reunion of the Albany alun1ni of Syracuse university in the chape·l of the First M. E. church in Albany, last week. Chancellor Day addressed the members of the association and during his address said that he was glad to 1neet the representative of Union (Dr. Ripton), a college that gave Syracuse Dean French. He said also that he had wanted Dr. Ripton for dean but could not get him, so he tied him up in a double knot by educating his daughter and making him an LL. D., in 1896. Miss ~1aud Ripton, 'o2, was elected 2nd vice president of the associa· tion. The inter-collegiate oratorical contest be· tween Syracuse, Rochester and Union Uni- versities will be held tomorrow evening, May 7th, at Syracuse, not on the evening of May zoth as stated in the last issue of the Concord- iensis. An important 1neeting of the 1.,ennis Associ- ation was held last week to make preliminary ._ arrangements for the spring tournament and A regular tneeting of the Schenectady branch of the Atnerican Institute of Electrical En- gineers was held Tuesday evening, JVIay 5, at 8 o'clock in Sillitnan hall.

No final action in regard to the challenge was taken but there is some probability that a team of four men will be sent to com pete -with Vermont. -----

12 THE CONCORDIEN.SIS. In pursuanc-e of a motion carried at coUege m·eeting, April 27th, a chess tournament is in progress. The three best players will consti- tute the tean1 to represent Union at Amherst. Assistant 1\'reasurer Pond of Union ·college has announced that the college trustees will not allow the grounds to be used for athletic purposes by the city high school boys. 'fhe baseball tean1 is practicing daily for its games with Colgate and Cornell. 1'he forn1er will be played Thursday afternoon at Albany and the latter at Ithaca on Saturday. It is unfortunate that \Charley\ Heath will be unable to play at Cornell because of the fact · that the track meet with Rutgers at New Bruns- wick is held the satne day, in which he is en- tered. Dr. Towne gives valuable assistance each day on the diamond, and if conscientious and faithful work are worth anything, Captain Griswold's men will n1ake a creditable showing for the retnainder of the season. 'The next game on the campus wil I be played with our old rival, Han1ilton, \\rednesday, l\1ay 13th. President Bolles of the Senior Class has appointed Mulleneaux and Rulison, both of 1904, as the representatives of the student body on the permanent intercollegiate debate committee, which, it is intended, will have en- tire charge of all future oratorical con tests and debates between Union and other colleges. 1\Ir. Roy C .. Finch, formerly of the class of r 903, visited friends on the campus last week. It has been decided to hold the eiection for leaders of the two musical clubs after the June concert,. thus following the precedent set by the various athletic teams of electing the cap- tains for the next ·year after the last gan1e of the season. The election of the Conoordiensis board will be held in Silliman Hall, Monday, May 18th, at 5 P. M. The new board will take charge first for the con1mence1nent number. Tha local senior society, Idol's I-Iead, has initiated into its nun1ber ~Iessrs. Guardenier, l\1 ulleneaux, Olmsted and Palmer, of the class of 1904. The members from the class of 1903 are : Barrett, Bishop, Griswold, Gulnac, Howe, Parker, Peck and Pearce. ., ALPHA DEL T '' INFORMAL.

About the only way it can be done by the average busy man and wornan is to read a magazine like •' The Review of Reviews,'' and, as it is the only magazine of the sort, it is a good thing to send $2.50 for a year's subscription. PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT says: \I know that through its columns views have been pre- sented to me that I could not otherwise have had access to; because all earnest and thoughtful men, no matter how widely their ideas diverge, are given free utterance in its columns.\ EX-PRESIDENT GHOVER CLEVELAND says: \I consider it a very valuable addition to my library.\ The Review of Reviews Co. 13 Astor ·Place, New York Read The Review of Reviews

THE CONCORDIENSIS _:.--==---===.----~----- -- ---~-­ ----------·. ---- --------- VoL. XXVI. UNION 0'0LLEGE, MAY 13, 1903. No. 26. UNION 6-COLGA TE o. After holding Union's nine down to the score of r too for seven innings, the Colgate team went up in the air in the seventh at }~idge­ field Park, Albany, yesterday afternoon, and a single hit was n1agnified by the latter's six errors in to five runs, settling the question of superiority, which up till then had been a close question. The poor business n1anagetnent re- sulted in but a hundred persons seeing what was, with the exception of this one innin(} one of 0' the best college baseball games ever played in this city. 1'he day was raw, with a stiff wind blowing across the diamond, but both tean1s fielded well considering the adverse conditions. The magnificent catch by Easton of a foul in the sixth fully 5o feet back of the plate was the feature of the gan1e, although another sin1ilar play in the eighth was alrnost as thrilling. O'Brien showed his 1nettle in the second by striking out three Colgate players, but in the fifth he was wild and it looked like Colo-ate for <::> a minute. \Vith two out and t\VO bases on balls ' Rider's error filled the sacks, Collister, one of the Colgate heavy hitters, can1e to the bat and lifted one what looked like a stood one but . 0 ' Bingham made a splendid catch and there vvas nothing doing in the scoring line for the Col- gate players after that, tbe 1nen going out in practically one, two, three order for the last half of the gan1e, O'Brien and Easton doing fine battery work. Union took the lead in the last of the sixth. 1-Iagar, Griswold and Rider touching up \rVhit- taker for hits, the last being a two-bagger. Griswold was thrown out at second and Rider got nipped trying to come hon1e. \Vhittaker was so anxious to get Easton out at first that he slipped and fell and a fine chance to retire the side without a score was lost for Ha o-ar ' ~ . can1e galloping in with the first run of the game. I-Ieath's out at first prevented further tallies. Union started scoring in earnest in. the last half of the eighth, her final time at bat, but it was Colgate that sent the Garnet \--vearers around the bases, for the Dorpians only got one hit. Larkin dropped 1-Iahar's high fly, his first chance of the gan1e, and the Union short stop was safe on first. Hagar's base hit came in now just right, and on Captain Collister's rank n1uff of Griswo1d's slow grounder, the sacks were all covered with Garnet stockings. Lark in now got his second chance and made his second error, letting in a run and filling 'em up again. ·Easton's tin1ely sacrifice brought in a couple 1nore, the Colgate team going 'way up in G. Castlen1an, the star half back of last fall, n1uffed the ball and Rider crossed the final base. Heath got to first on the same error, stole second, got on third when Stringer let the ball sail into the backstop, and brought in the :fifth and last run of a weird inning '\vhen Stringer threw wild to first to get O'Brien out. Runge had to fall in line and Bingha1n got to first on the opposing third basen1an's error. Staeber having struck out, when Vvhittaker threw Ivfahar out at first, the inning at length catne to an end. The score: UNIO~. AB R Ill P.Oc A. E . -.

ROCHESTER WINS INTER- COLLEGIATE. Frank Singi2er Takes Key From Rep- resentatives of Syracuse and Union. The Rochester representative, Frank Singi- zer, carried off the honors of the intercollegi- ate oratorical contest held last Thursday night in the chapel of the John Crouse College be- tween the speakers from Union, Rochester and Syracuse 1J niversities. The audience was essentially a college crowd and altogether did not number over 200. Rev. Courtland Robinson, pastor of the Park Presbyterian Church, presided at the exercises. The judges were Rev. Samuel R. Calthrop, Rev. Reuben Burton and Hon. lvl. E. Driscoll of Syracuse. 1\'he contest was interesting and in the de- cision of the judges the three orators were highly con1plimented. Singizer took 'for his topic, \ A National Outrage,'' or the wrong done to Finland by the rule of the Russians, and presented the cause of the down-trodden people in an eloquent ,manner. The descrip- tions were especially forceful and their vivid- ness made the audience see the Fins in a new and clearer light. The oration of the Syracuse orator, Arthur M. Townsend, 'o3, was more of a scholarly effect, and while it did not affect the sympa- thies of the audience ia the same manner as the oration of the man from Rochester, it was an excellent effort, clear in thought, logical in conclusions and forceful in character. Town- send spoke of Franklin, America's first diplo- mat. For Union Samuel :B. Howe, Jr., spoke on \Ruling Motives in History,\ and his work dealt with the psychological side of the ques- tion. 'There were several musical numbers on the programn1e given by the students of tne Fine Arts College. These numbers varied the exer· cises and were '\tvell received by the audience. Another year there win be an effort made to place the contest on a larger and firmer basis. An organization will be perfected and a num ... ber of other colleges in the state will be asked to compete for the key.

THln CONCORDIENSIS. RUTGERS WINS TRACK .MEET. The second annual track meet with Rutgers College was held in New Brunswick, N. J., last Saturday. Rutgers was again victorious, winning by a score of 58-38. 1,he day was an ideal one for a meet and the track was cotnparatively fast. Rutgers had a strong rep- resentation and the foHowing of their records were broken : 440 yard dash, won by Van Nuis, time 53 3-4; former record, 54 r-.5, held by Van Nuis. High Jump, won by l\1oon' height 5 ft. 4 3-4 inches ; former record sft 4 1-4 inches, held by C. A. Ranney. \Vright ran a pretty mile for Union and won out, breaking the R.utgers record for that distance by eight seconds. Closson broke the Union college record in the l1amn1er throw by 2ft r 1-2 inches. It was a goo-d meet from start to finish, and the Union team was most hospitably enter- tained by the representatives of the New Jersey College. The final score of points was 58---38 in favor of Rutgers. Only first and second places counted. The results were as follows : 100 yard dash-Pearce, U, and Van Nuis, R. tied for first place ; time I o 4-5 seconds. 2 20 yard dash-Won by Brinkerhoff, R., Van Nuis, R., second ; time 24 seconds. 440 yard dash-Won by Van Nuis, R., Kirk, R., second ; time 53 3-5 sec. 88o yard run-,Von by Wyckoff, R., Falls, R., second ; time 2 rn. 4 I- 5 sec.

CORNELL-UNI 0 N. The \Garnet'' meets defeat at lthaca. Capt. Griswold and his men left Friday noon for Ithaca where, on Saturday afternoon, before a large crowd of ·Cornellians on Percy F1elcl, Union's representatives struggled bravely for victory. Cornell has a very strong nine this year, so that the defeat, while decided, was not without its.merits. Bingham pitched a cool- hea~ed, steady game and was given general good support by the in-field. The absence of Heath in the out-field, as he was entered in the track meet at Rutg-ers, proved somewhat of a handicap for Cornell. Hagar was shifted to left and Lawsing ma<le his first appearance this season in centre field.

He has been a mission- ary doctor to Africa for several years past and his address was thoroughly enjoyed by all present. His general subject was \Missions.\ l-Ie chose for his text ; '' \Vhosoever calleth on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\ He said in brief : '' There is a clearer understanding to-day as to what faith means, for it is now more or less widely recognized that faith without works is dead. rrhe fact of the Christian bible's being a saving gospel constitutes more than anything else what a n1issionary's life is, for Christ means infinitely more than the mere church . can gtve. \A missionary takes to the heathen all that the Christian church means, and it rneans as much for them as for us. There is a great deal too much of the {eeling to-day that what we get out of Christ is for our own personal benefit : we must impart our benefits to others. ''The African, as a typical heathen is far

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 n1.·ore religious, in the broad sense of the term, lhan are the majority of Americans or English- .vnen. They do not want religion in the ab- stract but God, and man cannot teach God ex- cept by revealing him through Christ. '' rfhere are many nten in the world to-day 'vho in their darkness have a little light which is only sufficient to lead then1 \Vrong. 1'hey sin with a high hand, deliberately and turn to :tl1e creature instead of the creator. Mission \Vork means that we take sufficient Hght to these ; we take to thetn a sa vi or-· sotneone strong-son1eone sufficient and a gos- pel which makes thetn live their lives not for t hetnselves but for God. '' If any n1an has an honest heart he will never feel himself truly worthy to be fit to be an ambassador to God, but if men were as de- tennined to be missionaries as they are to suc- ceed in life they would gradually grow in fit- ness to serve the Creator. There are generally but two reasons why there are so few men at \rVOrk in the mission field: :First, because they lack a fundamental knowledge of the English Ei ble. The other reason is that life is not be- ing lived as it should be and tnen are letting n1aterial interests destroy the spiritual side of their natures. So far as ]earning a new lan- guage is concerned, if that objection be raised, any man who can graduate from a college can certainly learn a language. \If men could only see that to be a mission -worker is tnore a question of determination than of fitness they would not hesitate in the attetnpt to bring God into heathen hearts, for truly, fitness lies in a man's hand entirely when backed by detern1ination. ''There is nothing n1ore pitiful to look upon, such sights as I have often seen in Africa, than intelligent human beings grovelling in the dust of ignorance and mental neglect, who, if they were but raised above their environment could stand side by side with their enlightened fel- low men.\ SOPHOMORE-FRE.SHMAN GAME. The long expected base ball game between the underclassmen was played off Wednesday afternoon on the campus. It was somewhat startling in some of its revel~tions, 'The fresh- man '' went up in the air\ and several pitchers had to be substituted. It was not an exciting game to watch for the ,,, Sophs\ had a compara- tiveiy easy time of it, but the freshmen were plucky to the finish.

Again The ceremony was accompanied with We Have yells and songs and followed by a jol.- \Moved Up.\ lification, just as it should be. The custom has, however, a deeper signifi- cance. It is symbolic of the ceaseless motion of life. The seniors move out into the pulsing, throbbing world and make room for another class which moves up, and up, and up-then out as those before them. So on it goes until the final moving ep which is not celebrated with cheers and songs but by the hushed voice and tnoist eye. Moving up is a custom which we hope will always be observed at Union with its proper cere- monies. They are times that will live long in the memory of college days, and while joyous in them- selves, suggest a deeper, sadder meaning . Staying \Vhen the result of the recent Colgate- Qualities. Union game was known it appeared, for a while at least, that Union had at last begun to come to her own in athletics. 'I'his pleas• ant prospect however was short lived, for only two days later the wearers of the Garnet met with two decisive defeats, by Rutgers in the dual track meet and by Cor· nell in baseball.. The pessimists in college have begun to draw themselves iato their shells of self-interest and to make disparaging remarks about the several teams. The optimists, although naturally dissapointed, are giving the encouragement due to athletic teams, whether vic- torious or defeated. If it seems hard for the student body to bear a defeat in athletics, what about the feel· ings of the team ? They not only bear the material de· feat but must stand the criticism of some of those who should be their supporters and for whom they have been putting forward their best efforts. Do not let us be discouraged, for the teams are faithful and it is cer- tainly true that the night of loss often brings out the stars of reward and victory. SONNET.

The fortunate men are Dickinson, Pickens and \Villis. \Jim the copper,'· was on the hill last 'Ved- nesday evening-. DR. HOFFMAN SPEAKS AT VESPER SERVICE. Prof. Hoffman, last Sunday afternoon, spoke on \considering as shown in the verse \con- sider the lilies of the field, how they grow.\ He said in brief, that, while the word consider is hardly found in the ICoran or the Veda, yet in the bible it is found, along with its synonym \ think,\ over two hundred times. The Christian religion is peculiar in its use of this word. \Vhy does the Bible want us to con- sider? Do other religions ask us to reflect up- on then1, to ponder on them? No. They ask us to 1nemorize; to take for granted. The Bible is peculiar in this respect. In this pas- sage the word is used three or four times and all through Proverbs we are appealed to, to \think upon these things.\ \Ve are to \give a reason for the faith that is in us.'' Vve are enjoined especially to reason, being men capable of thinking. We must use our po,vers to get so1nething to think about. Other re- ligions n1erely give us something to take to ourselves without any reasoning or reflecting. They do not want to discuss things in their religion because discussioa awakens the mind, and that is 'vhat they do not want. Several new religions illustrate this. 'I'hey consider religion above or below discussion. There- fore it is ruled out.\ Prof. I-loffman gave incidents fron1 several of these new religions. People who do not want to think, reason or consider, flock to then1. 'fhese cannot . exist long because man is a reasoning, reflecting be- ing. He must satisfy his nature. ''It is the business of everyone to be able to give a rea- son for his beliefs.\ No other religion uses nature to give its illustrations as does Christ~ ianity. Even Socrates said that he could learn nothing from nature. Christianity looks upon nature as being prominent as the Bible. Even if we had no Bible, we would find it in nature. Consider the lilies, the birds, the n1ountains, the trees, and everything. \Vhy consider? Because these are the revelations of the thoughts of God; that is their true intention.

12 Panl says that the things around us lead us to God; and no other religion has taken these I things in to consideration. The truly religious I man will study these things as examples of gro,vth and clevelop1nent. Buddhism says that we must not grow, but ditninish. Christ- ianity teaches the opposite; to rnake life more worth living, to put more into life and to get n1ore out of it. To ''consider\ our religion is our cl uty and we will d eve1op in proportion as 've perforrn it. ADDRESS OF WM. McHARG. Class of '42, at the Alun1ni Dinner, June 1902. lVlr. President and Gentlemen of the Alumni : lt is a pleasure to ahnost every man to visit the place of his birth, or where his boyish days were spent ; pleasant to visit, even in imagin- ation, ''The orchard, the meadow, the deep tangled wild wood, and every loved spot which our infancy knew.\ A similar emotion is experienced by the collegian, who after several decades returns to the old academic halls, and is privileged to rneet with classmates and other sons of his alma n1ater, who have passed through sin1ilar experiences and are united by a common bond of love and gratitude to a con1n1on benefactor. It is pleasant and profitable for a n1an to forget for a season the cares and burdens of present being, and to revive the 1nernory of his youthful days, when ambitions were pure and lofty, hopes ardent, and the future land- scape glowed with golden pron1ises. It will not be disputed by any alumnus that son1e of the happiest years of his life were those spent in his coUegiate course. \Vhatever cares and discomforts he then ex- perienced are forgotten, and memory retains only impressions of the pleasant incidents of · that life. \Ve remernber and recall the characteristics I of profess<?rs and tutors, incidents of the class room and the study chamber, of· the· literary :and social clubs, the idiosyncrasies of teachers and students, and many scenes of mirth and ~mischief. We recall the forms and faces of c;lassmates and loved companions and can g:veet them, ~'With hands as warm and hearts as gay As we had parted yesterday .. \\ \Vaiving all controversy respecting the ad- vantages of a collegiate training-, it must still be adm~itted that a college course presents many opportunities for, and incentives to n1ental culture, c_>utside of the prescribed cur~. riculutn. There is a stimulating influence pervading a college, which rouses the energies and ambi- tions of the student and prompts !him to many tentative excursions into the dornains of poet- ry, eloquence, and general litet~ature. How many of these essays have undergraduates often contributed in their hours oJ leisure or exciten1ent, bright and sparkliag with youth- ful fire. I recall many of these in. my college days, one especially brilliant, glowing with the fire of genius and with the finish of the scholar. It was a satiric poem upon the college and its surroundings. It spared neither professor nor student. It painted Dr. N ott with a master hand, his foibles, his inventions in cathedral stoves, his experi- ments in novelty· steamboats floundering in darkness and tempest in the waters of the l-Ind- son, the inartistic architecture of the college buildings, and the glories of that long pron1ised ,chapel, which in so1ne future day was to rise on the college campus like an exh.ilaration, and eclipse the splendors of the AJhan1bra. At this dist?nt day 1 can recaH one stanza, in which the writer, after paintiug the crude accommodations of the room in ·which the poem was penned., thus apostropbise(l it- \ And yet to say as Cowper would have said . Old roon1 with all thy faults 11ove thee still And all thou boldest; venerab:le bed Oft have I lain upon thy lap and often will Until thy master sleep~. where grin1 death shall have laid him,

'. THE OONOORDIENSIS. 13 And I'll bequeath thee in my last sad wiH To him who made thee, for I never paid hitn. '' How variant often is the full grown man from the pro.mise of his youth. rl'he author of this essay, in which he gave promise of rival- ing Byron and Halleck in keenness of satire and felicity of versification, early turned fton1 poet- ry to theology abandoned the muses for masses and for n1any years was the revered and he~ loved pastor of St. Mary's church in the staid old city of Albany ; the Rev. Father 'iValworth. I said it was pleasant to dwell upon these scenes and incidents of college days, but the trail of the serpent is over. all human pleasures. If we visit the hotne of our childhood our en· joyment is not untningled with sadness. The landscape is changed, the patriarchs of the hamlet are no tnore, our early sweethearts have been carried off bv modern Sabines and . are now staid mothers or grandmothers, and if perchance we should meet one of our old schoolmates lingering around the ancestral home and should inquire of hiln '' 'Vhere are the rest?'' the answer would be- \ Some are in the church yard laid Son1e sleep beneath the sea And of all the boys who were playmates here There are left but vou and me.'' .. And so when we meet here to-day and recall tnemories of happy college days, we are also retninded of the ravages of death in the ranks of professors and pupils. Of the faculty of learned and able n1en of fifty years ago, not one is in the land of living. The Venerable Dr. Nott, whose genius and virtues I need not refer to in this presence, is no more. Gone too the austere and able Dr. Alonzo Potter, the venerabie ]Jr. Proudfit, the genial and eloquent Professor John Austin Yates, with Professors Jackson l~eid, Pierson, Nichols, and John Foster, rrhey rest in hon- erecl graves. I shall attetnpt no eulogy of then1 on this occasion \nor storied urn nor animated bust\ are needed to commemorate their virtues ; the record of these is graven on the hearts of their many pupils, And what changes have taken place in the ranks of a class graduating sixty years ago. Of the dozen classn1ates who entered college with ,me, coining fro1n tbe satue county, but two are living, and when I look oyer the class roll or over the land for the balance of that band I am reminded of \Tergil's Shipwrecked Mariners, \Apparent rares in gurgite nautes.\ Only here and there is one to b.e seen, buffet- ing on the billows of 1ife, destined soon to pass awav. ol But we are not here to·clay to invoke thoughts of sadness. 'Ve are here to revive pleasant 1nen1ories of the days of our youth and early manhood, to renew our love for our ahna 1nater, to testify our gratitude for her loving care and guidance during the moulding years of our college life, to encourage her faculty and officers in their noble work, and to rejoice with them in the brightening prospects which cheer them in the1r labors. And have we not cause to rejoice with them ? rfhe old college is awakening and putting on her beautiful gar- m,ents. \Vith a faculty not inferior to that of her palmiest days, with her sons all over the land cherishing her fame and contributing to her success, and with students flocking to her portals like doves to their windows, may ,~..-e not reasonably hope and belieYe that the glory of the old Union will soon be lost in that of the new? Have we not, sons of old Union, reason to anticipate, to confidently predict a brilliant future for our beloved aln1a mater and that each succeeding class will be better trained and developed than its predecessor, and that old Union will continue to send forth fr0n1 its halls men destined for pre-en1inence in .every department in life : statesmen, sage as Hainil- ton, and Jefferson ; divines as logical as Ed- wards, as n1agnetic as Beecher and Brooks ; orators as eloquent as Webster or Clay ; jurists as profound as Marshall or l(.ent ; historians as erudite as Prescott or Bancroft, and even college presidents ·worthy to fill the t place of a vVayland 1 an Elliot or a N ott ?

I am dead ; o'er my head Are the trees and the breeze And the flowers, happy bowers And the strife of my life I went away one quiet day To a hill above a rill \Vhere lay soft mosses, fral?:rant glosses Gleamed. their sides, as ocean tides vVash with waves the silent graves Of those who sleep in the deep And are quiet from the riot Of each day's battle ways. And from the hill above the rill I saw the vale and mossy dale And then a fire as a pyre Starts uplighted ; I was frighted N angl1t I J.cnew what to do For the fire, leaping higher Curling, hissing, hotly kissing Fast approached me : I could see Ghouls in the flame, then a name \Vas whispered clear ( oh so dear !) To hear again that holy name. '' Eulalie min~ '' sang the vine As the flame went and came Scorched its ·heart, every part. Nearer drew 'till it slew Flowers here, fragrance there, And at last when the blast Of the smoke made me choke And I saw all was lost And that I must soon die On the hill above the rill In the fire on the pyre. Then I dreamed that it seemed But the tale of a wail Of a child in the wild Lost to life and the strife Of the world, to be hurled In the flame, purging shame. Then I cried ere I died, '' I believe. God receive Now my soul.'' All was dark ; not a spark Showed the fire or the pyre And the voice of my choice Of my love from above \Vhispered low, speaking slow : Again I cried ere I died, '' Eulalie mine, I repine, I am dying, hear me crying. Help me rise to the skies, Give me rest with the blest.'' Then my love, born above, Bent below, speaking low ; '' Sleep dear friend, soon shall end Every sorrow 'till tomorrow Of sweet peace and release From the pain of life's chain.\ Then I knew all was true When she said that the dead Rise again, released from pain. Then my sleep became deep, No more I cried for I died. ; ~ '' Eulalie dear \ sobbed the rose And the fire, burning higher, S, U. '04. rv- ------- ·---------- r I ~.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 15 RINGLING BROS.' EX.CURSIONS. Special excursion rates on all lines .of travel have been arranged for by the management of Ringling Brothers' World's Greatest Shows, and those who wish to go to Albany where this great cireus exhibits Saturday, May 30, can do so at very little expense. This will be the only point in this vicinity where the show will exhibit this season, and no one should tniss the opportunity to witness it. Ringling Brothers' circus has been the lead- ing arenic exhibition for years, but the show has never been permitted to rest upon its reputation. Although it long ago passed the point of competition, every season sees a greater and grander show. This year's perform- ance is entirely new, and entails the combined efforts of 375 wonderful artists in the equestrian, gymnastic, equilibristic, acrobatic and aerial line, together with forty famous clowns and hundreds of lesser lights. Six hundred and fifty horses are used and a marvelous trained animal department is presented. The circus this season is greatly enlarged by the spectacular production of Jerusalem and the Crusades, a pantomimic presenta- tion of the well known and beaatiful historical narrative of the Crusaders. The vast menagerie has among hun- dreds of features the only living pair of giraffes, the first baby elephant successfully bred and reared in America, and the only Fhinoceros in captivity. There is a gorgeous revival of the Roman hippodrome races, and many other stupendous features in this great circus. Circus day opens with a brilliant street parade, three miles in length. Don't fail to see it.

THE CONCORDIENSIS ======= =========================. ·-·-- -- _______ -:-::_ ::-:::::-=-================== VoL. XXv 7 I. UNION COLLEGE, MAY 20, 1903. No. 27. PSI UPSILON CONVENTION. On \Vednesday, May 13th, Union opened her doors to the representatives of the various chapters of the Psi Upsilon fraternity and from that time until Friday evening, when the visitors and their hosts adjourned to Albany for the convention banquet, the college prac- tically belonged to them. 1'he Psi Upsilon fraternity was organized at Union college seventy years ago, and its exist- ence has been most successful. To-day it is recognized as one of the leading college fra- ternities in the United States. Its semi-cen- tennial was duly celebrated in Albany, with the rfheta in that City, in 1883, the busineSS SeS- sions being held in the old State house. T'his convention, strangely enough, was the last deliberative 1Jody to meet in the historic old capitol. The chapters represented were : Union, New York University, Yale, Brown, Amherst, Darttnouth, Colurnbia, Bowdoin, Hamilton, \Vesleyan, Rochester, l(enyon, University of 1\1ichigan, Syracuse, Cornell, 'l'rinity, Lehigh, University of Pennsylvania, University of Minnesota, University of Wis- consin, University of Chicago and University of California. 'l'he opening event after the registration of the delegates was an informal \ smoker,\ held in the chapter house, whete all the sessions were conducted. This was most enjoyable and was attended not only by the delegates but also by n1any local friends of the chapter. 'The house was beautifully decorated by Lim- mer & Evans with pahns, holly and ferns. Red geraniums filled the fire places and knots of the fraternity colors, garnet and gold ribbon, ap- peared here and there amid the flowing greens. Japanese lanterns lighted up the exterior of the house, greatly adding to its gay appear- ance. The resident members of the frat~rnity whose names are here given lent generous as- sistance to the undergraduates in whose charge the convention was so successfully held. The Hon. Samuel W. Jackson, Prof. Wendell Lam- oreaux, Col. Allan H. Jackson, J. Alexander Lyon, the Rev. Junius G. Fallon, Prof. James R. 'fruax, Prof. l'homas W. Wright, Prof. Benjamin H. Ripton, Horatio G. Glen, Irv· ing P. Estcourt, William A. \Vyatt, Frapk Smith, Charles H. Mac Culloch, John T. Jack- son, George Detz Greene, Albert_ B. Va~ Voast, Horace S. Van Voast, Henry Glen, Charles W. Trumbull. Thursday n1orning was devoted ·to the dis- cussion of the business that is on the schedule of the fraternity, and in the afternoon the busi- ness sessions were resumed. In the evening a theatre party for the delegates and many friends in the city and vicinity was given at the Van Curler. 'fhe attraction was \The Bos- tonians \ who sang \Robin Hood\ by special request of the fraternity. 'I'he patronesses of the theatre party were : Mrs SamueL\V. Jack- son, l\1rs Allan H. Jackson, Mrs Wen dell Lam- oreaux, Mrs. Alonzo P. Strong, Mrs. Isaiah B. Price, Mrs. B. vV. Wright, Mrs. James R. rrruax, lVIrs. B. H. Ripton, Mrs. Horatio G. Glen, 11rs. G. S. Veeder, Mrs. Horace S.

After the opera was ended the party reas- sembled at the house where a fonnal reception was tendered the delegates. Mrs. L. W .. \Vright, Mrs. B. H. Ripton, 1\tlrs I. B. Price, ~1rs. James R.

THE c:ONCORDIENSIS. of the fraternity among graduates and under- graduates of Union were invited guests on this ·occasion. 'fhe business. sessions were resumed Friday morning, after which the delegates and mem_ bers of the 1oca1 chapter assembled for the convention photograph. In the afternoon they paid a visit to the General Electric works, a committee of arrangen1ents having been designated for the purpose of doing everything possible to add to the enjoyment of those com- prising the party. The various points of special interest to visitors in the works were dis played and the visit proved to be one of the most pleasurable events arranged for the gathering of the delegates here. In the evening the visitors took special cars for Albany, where the banquet was held at the Ten Eyck. The banquet hall was beautifully decorated and songs were sung and a merry time was had. 'I'he Hon. Timothy L. vVood- ruff acted as toastmaster and toasts were given by Herbert L. Bridgman of Albany, James F. Me Elroy of Albany, A. L. Andrews of Albany, George Coleman of New York city and Prof. B. H. Ripton of u·nion college. E. A. Bart- lett of Amherst, spoke for the undergraduates. 1\'here were 140 banqueters. The next annual convention 'vill be held next May at Madison, \Vis., with the chapter at the University of Wisconsin. Among those who were in attendance upon the seventieth annual convention were : A. B. Farrer, Dartmouth ; B. B. Lamborn, Dart- mouth ; Charles F. Bridge, Union, '87, Al- bany ; George M.

THE GREEK PLAY. ~· At the University of Pennsylvania. Notwithstanding the recent decision of the New York University to .award the degree of A. B. in courses of stu:dy from which Greek is excluded, . and in spite oif the indications of failing interest in the study of Greek in this country, yet there are sig-ns, of which it is per- tinent here to take note, looking positively in the opposite direction. One of them is the growing strength and inportance of the Ar- chaeological Institute of Atnerica, whose pro- ceedings reflect the general interest taken by universities and our citizens everywhere in Greek art, life and literature. President John \Villian1s \Vhite, of I{arvard University, reports the recent meeting in New York to have been ''pervaded by a spirit of hopefulness that au- gers well for the future of the Institute,\ and the work in progress :at the American School of Archaeology in Athens is declared by its promoters to be satisfactory and fully justi_fied by its results. But not the least significant sign of interest in Gr,eek studies,-and one pointing beyond the con:~.paratively narrow lim- its of the college or university,-is the support which the people of Philadelphia have given on two separate occasions to the presentation of a Greek dratna on the stage of their Academy of 1\!Iusic. The name of the play selected on either occasion is of relatively slight impor- tance. But the fact that it was a Greek play, and not a French or German or even a Latin play, is a matter of some moment. 1\'o us who live in the State of New York, where there is scant respect felt for age in any form,-not to speak o:f antiquity, and the an- cients,-the laborious undertaking, which reached its fruition on. tl1e 28th day of April just passed, may seetn to have been a work of supererogation. All the same, it is so n1uch tangible evidence that Greek is held in no light esteem in one, at least, of our great education- al centres. The bringing out of '' Iphigenia

8 THE OONO:ORDIENSIS. among the Taurians,\ one of Euripides' best, suggests that in PlHla~elp:hia there is convic- tion touching the value of Greek as a source of culture and as an aid to education. ~'hat this conviction is not ,confined to the city's univer- sity is proved by the number and character of the spectators who oontdbuted their money to the venture and :fille~ the theatre. 1\'he in- itiative, it is true, was taken by the uni versi- ty,-that is, by its trustees,-and the enter- prise was ca,rried throu,gh by the head profes- sor of Greek, who tra:rned certain select stu- dents of the university to enact the characters. Preparation for the event was in progress for six months immediately prior to its accom- plishment. During this time the undergradu- ates referred to were trained to speak the Greek text, and to embeHish the delivery of their lines with appropriate :~intonation and gesture .. ,.fhe lyric odes of the p~ece were set to music by Professor Clark, of the Department of Mu- sic in the university, and were rendered by fif- teen voices and as many musical instruments. The voices were those of the chorus, which constituted an integral part of every Greek tragedy, but the musical accompaniment was wholly modern. 'fhe instrumental music as- sociated with the drama of ancient G-reece ·was either of too simple a nature to· be effective in the theatre of to-day, or else it is a matter about which we have yet to be enlightened. But the fifteen young ,tn,en who represented the tnaidens in the Euripidean play proved to be excellent songsters, and delivered their odes in a manner worthy of tl1e faithful training they had· received at the hands of Prof. Clark and Prof. Lamberton. A libretto or translation of the play was to be had in the theatre, and the fact that Prof. Lamberton was its author was a guarantee of genuine quality. Must of the spectators f ol- lowed the speakers wi:th the assistance of the libretto; a few had the Greek text in hand. All appeared to be deeply interested. The light thrown upon ·Greek tragedy by this everit, at1d the: new interest it must have awakened in ~Greek Literature is, as it were, a contr~i but ion to culture. The same tnay be re- n1ark,ed of the attetnpt by the University of Pennsylvania in a similar direction about seven- teen years ago. 'l'his earlier effort also was, warmly seconded and supported by the peop~e at large. The play was a com·edy of Aristophanes and the parts were taken by the undergradutes. Such practical attempts at revival of the Greek drama, from tin1e to tin1e, by our unive:rslttes and colleges, may be nothing more than the result of a local whim or fancy; yet tl•ey are among the straws that show which way the current· is flowing, and point to the genuh1e and well-grounded belief in the va1ue to the higher education of the language and literature of ancient Hellas. SIDNEY G. ASHMORE. HAMILTON 6-UNION 7· In one of the most exciting games played on catn~us for a long while, the Hatnilton nine was defeated by the Union team, last \Ved- nesday afternoon. The game was cleanly play- ed atld the two teams were very evenly match- ed. Up to the last half of the ninth inning the game was Hamilton's by the score of 6-5, but when the Garnet braced up at their last cha11ce the Blue and Bluff went to pieces. \Vith oae man ()Ut and Bingham on second, Mahar lined the 1 eather out for two bases, which brought Bingham over the hotne plate, tying the score.

THE OONOORDIENSIS. 11 track~ the hurdles, the runners, the jumpers, the crowds and even heard the cheering- .and the pistol of the start- er. In order to make th.e scene more thrilling, the ,meter of the poem trips, almost falls, like a hurdler or a tired runner when he is finishing his last quarter. In his rhyme the poet is no less skillful. The words at the end of the lines remind us of runners tearing down the home stretch to\Yard the tape. In the rhymes •' Dodge,\ \ budge,\ and \ lodge \ we can picture three men finishing. '' Dodge '' and ''lodge \ tying and I ''budge'' a little in the rea..r, or perhaps ahead-which? In '' trick,\ ''slick \ and 'c brick'' there is a neck and neck finish ; but in the words \ quarter, \ Alma Mater\ and \ought to\ we trust \Alma :!\Tater\ won out. (\Ve would suggest that if the poet wished to make the rhyme imitate a close race he mignt write '' oughteT\ instead of ''ought to.'') In the rhyme ''details,\ '' incomplete\ and \ Fales '' we conjecture that '' incomplete'' must have fallen out of the race al- together. Taken as a whole we consider the method is far superior to the ordinary prosey one which is usu- ally employed in writing up the report of a track meet. \Ve would like to see this method employed in writing up a ball game. How vivid it could be made !

In order to make the scene more thrilling, the meter .of the poem trips, almost falls, like a hurdler or a tired runner when he is finishing his last quarter. In his rhyme the poet is no less skillful. The words at the end of the lines remind us of runners tearing down the home stretch to\Yard the tape.

Reportorial Staff-V.O. Lundgren,'o6; G.F. Luke F. Lovelock spoke first I-lis subject \Va5, ''America as a world power.\ In a very glowing oration he paid a high tribute to the past of the U11ited States and prophesied an equally if not 1no1·e brilliant future. S. C. Fiero, t ll e next speaker, delivered an oration on \'l'be president's policy.\ }le showed that Roosevelt's action in the settle- ment of the recent coal strike was indisputably the best policy which could have been pursued. The next speaker, A. IL R.utledge, spoke on \ rl'he principles of Secession,\ and atte1npted to prove that the South had a right to with- draw from the Union. C Lansing Hays gave an oration on '''The restriction of e1nigration.\ l-Ie held that the United States is being over-rU!1 with a class of emigrants who are hannful to the nation, and that unless they be restricted this country will ultimately lose its liberty. The last speaker, T. G. Cowell, chose as his subject \ Toussaint I /Ouverture.\ He painted out the nobility of the black patriot of San Domingo and drew a .. striking contrast be- tween him and his captor, Napoleon. After consultation, the judges appointed Cowell, Hays, JJovelock and Rutledge as rep- resentatives in the contest. The judges were : Dr Hale, l)r Stoller and ~1 r. l'vf arch. CONCOR.DIENSIS ELECTION.

Rider, Union, 'o3, acted as judge; Pearce, '03, acted as prosecuting attor- ney, and Cool, 'o4, acted as defendant's attor- ney. The jury was con1posed of twelve boys, and the defendants were three boys accused of stealing a watern1elon. 1,he jury found the ringleader guilty and acquitted the other two. The ringleader was sentenced to stay in Scotia for an indefinite length of time. The chapel was crowded and there was a good sum raised for the fix:ing up of the chapel yard. The discussion between Prof. \V. S. Frank- lin and Mr. Charles P. Steintnetz on \Some Points in Alternating Current rfheory,'' took place ~1onday, ~1ay 18, at 8:15 p. 1n., in the chapel of Union college. On \Vednesday night, after the victory over I-Ian1ilton, about seventy-five students gathered on the campus, where a rousing bonfire was started by the able efforts of 1 go6. For over an hour a spirited campus meeting was held.

THE CONCORDIENSIS .. 13 Class cheers and college songs and speeches by pron1inent undcrgradutes served to testify to the rejoicing over a hard fought victory. Afterwards a party of the students set out for distant parts of the city where they proceeded to give vent to their hilarity. The fresh1nan baseball tea1n defeated the Juniors, Monday afternoon, by a score of r8-11. Lawsing, Greenman a~nd Sherrill were the battery for 1904, and Von Dannenburg and Itnrie for 1906. Heath acted as umpire. Prof. vVilliatn \,Yells will leave next Tuesday for Drew Theological seminary to attend the graduating exercises to be held \Vednesday, May 27. Prof \Vells is the only living charter member. If the strike conditions on the New York subway continue to improve, the New York trip will be taken by the engineers of the three upper classes, beginning on \Vednesday night via Albany-New York steamer, leaving Albany 8 p. m. for New York. Special rates have been secured. The party will stop at the Grand Union hotel, corner Park avenue and :Forty-second street, near the Grand Central railroad station. The return will be n1ade on Saturday afternoon, leaving New York at 6 o'clock. The enginee1·s 'vill inspect the sub- way, bridges and other engineering works of interest. 1'he men will be under the direction of Prof. Landreth and Assistant Professor Ed- wards. 1'he n1en elected and initiated into the Phi Beta l(appa society ~1onday afternoon are : T.

Franklin, professor of electrical en- gineering and physics at Lehigh, delivered a lecture in the college chapel l\fonday afternoon at 4 o'clock on ''Mechanical Representation of Magnetic and Electrical Pheno1n.ena.\ l\ feature of the gan1e Saturday was the ap- pearance of a balloon which sailed n1ajestical1y across the catnpns at a considerable height. It was taken as a portent signifying perhaps the state of the test players. The regular recitation and lecture \vork of the seniors will be concluded on Friday. Next week senior examinations will be held ancl thereafter the seniors will enj0y their long- looked·forward-to vacation. 'The musical clubs will g1ve a concert at vVhitel1all on the evening of the 29th of thi!-1 tnonth.

RINGLING BROS.' EXCURSIONS. Special excursion rates on all lines of travel have been arranged for by the management of Ringling Brothers' World's Greatest Shows, and those who wish to go to Albany where this great cireus exhibits Saturday, 1.\fay 30, can do so at very little expe11se. This will be the only point in this vicinity where the show will exhibit this season, and no one should miss the opportunity to witness it. Ringling Brothers' circus has been the lead· ing arenic exhibition for years, but the show has never been permitted to rest upon its reputation. Although it long ago passed the point of com]>etition, every season sees a greater and grander show. This year's perform· ance is entirely new, and entails the combined efforts of 375 wonderful artists in the equestrian, gymnastic, equilibristic, acrobatic and aerial line, together with forty famous clowns and hundreds of lesser lights. Six hundred and fifty horses are used and a marvelous trained animal department is presented. The circus this season is greatly enlarged by the spectacular production of Jerusalem and the Crusades, a pantomimic presenta- tion of the well known and beaatiflll historical narrative of the Crusaders. The vast menag€rie has among hun- dreds of features the only living .pair of giraffes, the first baby elephant successfully bred and reared in America, and the only rhinoceros in captivity. There is a gorgeous revival of th.e Roman hippodrome races, and many other stupendous features in this great circus. Circus day opens with a brilliant street parade, three miles in length. Doa't fail to see it. I can place a Union College man in a good business position on graduation. Address for particulars, R. S. Mighill I Union Square, New Vorl~ City. .
