State Legislature. Charles Emory Smith delivered the oration upon the occasion of the McKinley Memorial Exercises in the N. Y. Legislature. Mr. Sn1ith said in part : ''No one who did not see the Pr~sident at close hand during those stormy .and trying days, could measure the greatness of his spirit or the courage of his purpose. Of all men in the land he was the coolest, the calmest and most clear sighted. Profoundly moved, anxious beyond all expres- sion he was, with his waking hours and his sleepless couch filled with brooding care, but tranquil, self-contained, sure of his own heart and sure of his lofty and unselfish aim. In his purpose of rescuing Cuba he never faltered. In more sober understanding and aim he shared the hot domination of the country that the in- tolerable wrongs in the unhappy isle must cease ; he had reiterated the protest of other presidents and as the offenses grew, had gone farther in action ; but he still hoped and believed that the redemption could be effected without the dread necessity of war. With this conviction he judi- ciously moderated and restrained the impetuous ardor of Cougress and, man of the people as he was, stood unda'..lnted while the storm of popular clamor raged about hin1. WoNDERF.aL MoRAL HEROISM. ·' The country does not yet know the full ex- tent of the effort he made to save Cuba and at the same time avert war. For sixty days he he~d back an excited and impatient country. W1th one hand he curbed his own inpulsiveness and with the other he sought to lead a proud spirited power up to such concessions as alone would render peace possible. The conscience, courage and the ·steadfastness of that joint under- taking cannot be easily overstated. It must ever rank with the great acts of n1oral heroism among the rulers of men. But it was not met with the same ingenuous spirit ; events outran every plan ; ; ' '

; ' . _,. 'THE'. ·CONC,ORDIENSIS. 9 the mighty issues hastened to their deadly grapple, and the war was on.'~ Of the close of the late President's career, Mr. Smith said: \At last it seerned for the President a thne ot tranq uiUtyand n1easurablerepose and w:ell earned enjoym.ent of his great honors had ·c.on1e. He had solved and clatified the intricacies of the Cuban rnaze with a chaTt and chat~ter which determined the future. With a sincere and pro- found devotion to A1nerican traditions and with a directness which admitted of no question, he had stilled the rising sentin1ent for a third term. He had with his noble magnatnity and wisdom assuaged the strife of sections. and brought north and south together in such fraternal concord as they had not felt since they had shed theix blood side by side at Bunker I-Iill and Yorktown.\ A FIT LEGACY TO AMERICAN PKOPLE. '' He went to Buffalo, and amid the brilliant ~urroundings of its beautiful exposition he made the itnpressive speech which, in its elevation of spirit, in its clearness of vision and its breadth of statesmanship is his fit legacy to tlr1e A·merican people. He had renounced no article of his life- long creed. He only saw the cotnmemorati:on of the policy he had sustained, only the expected results he had done his part in bringing .a bout. His review on reciprocity was but t be ripened fruitage of the harvest of protection and when his unfaltering faith and patient labor ·were re- warded by seeing bis country in full command of her boundless resources, his hopes and aspira- tions naturalty reached out to the extension of her sceptre in the exchanges of the world. SERENE PATIENCE AND SuPREME TRusT. \ His fate on the day following this final speech gave it a sanctity commensurate with its significance. If he was great in life he was su- blime in death. rrhe cruel shot rang with hor- ror around the world. His country and all tnankind followed the changing aspects with alterations ofhigh hope and of deepest gloom. But through all the fluctuations of that anguish- ing week, whether encouraged by the highest hutnan skill or looking through the open portal to the eternal morn, he and he alone waited with unquitting spirit, with serene patience and with supreme trust.'' THE Y ALB TEACHING. Yale has been remarkably successful in developing ::-~nd tnaintaining an individual type of college life wh icb has itnpressed its students. What is known fatniliarl y as the \ Yale spirit \ is a cotnbination of the endeaver to co-operate with others and the determination to contribute the very best that is in one's best to the comtnon purpose. Students who catch this spit·it have learned a lesson that is quite as valuable as any to be derived fro1n books. But Yale has not been behind the foremost in her devotion to exact scholarship, and the utilities of learning have not been suffered to crowd out those truly liberal studies which give breadth of view and refinement of taste. The list of Yale graduates who have rendered the nation conspicious ser- vice in the administration of high office is an imposing one, hut it is not more impressive than the number of graduates who in private life have illustrated and perpetuated the best traditions of this. anc1ent seat of learning.-The Watchman.

Captain Grout made a strong- appeal at college meeting on Monday last for can- didates and as a result there have been not less than twenty-five •Candidates to report in the ''gym'' every afternoon for practice. A very· en- couraging fact is that of these twenty-four men eighteen have been fron the freshman class. A splendid lot of base ball material is to be found am<>ng the student body and if the men will only report regularly and train consistantly there ls no doubt that a fine team will be envolved. Caps and Gowns. Apropos of the question of Caps and Gowns the Harvard Crimson contains some good advice: ''Every mem:ber of the senior class ought to consider rather .carefully the argument for and against the wearing of caps. and gowns next May, before the vote on this question is taken in the coming class elections. The arguments against wearing caps and gowns seem to come down to the question of inconvenience. The gowns are said to be a nuisance, especially in rainy weather and in hot weather. It could be considered a rule, however, not to wear the cap and gown on rainy days, and it was found last year that by being able to go without coat and waistcoat, the gown proved an exceptionally cool costume in hot weather. From the experience of last year's class, we should judge that the gowns are not the nuisance in reality that they are sup- posed to be. Add to this that the gowns are to be wora only in the mortting, and the element of in- convenience is still more minimized . The principal argument in favor of caps and gowns is that the wearing of a common dress dur- ing the ·.last month in which the members are to- gether at College, is likely to cement together ihe men in the class more firmly. It will be noticed that the arguments against caps and gowns are, in the main, based on per- sonal considerations, while the arguments in favor of the plan seem to be in accordance with a definite purpose. Every man, however,. must use his own judgement in the matter. However the class votes, there must be absolute unanimity, either in acquiescing to a negative vote, or in carrying out the plan, if it is adopted by the class.''

TltE CONCORDIJTINSIS. 11 THE SPIRIT OP SHAKESPEARE. Prof. John. L. March delivered the third lec- ture before the Shakespeare Club on February 25. He said: The difficulties in education aris~ ultimately from this, that, there is an immense chastn be- tween words and what words represent. Words are like the a and b the x and r of algebra. They are abstract, artificial representations of lively states of mind. Children learn the simpler words one by one, but soon get the knack of using them even in very complex ways, and far beyond any possible expet·iences of theirs. They will speak of San Francisco and think. possibly, of nothing more than a black dot on the map. So we grow up with our mouths full of words for which we have no adequate thoughts. This state of things, well enough in the case children, becomes weak and dishonest, when we pretend to be tnen. Nothing is more de- teriorating in a man's intelletucal and ·moral life than his position in this matter. Nothing more subtle and deceptive than the various tetnptations to mental dishonee,ty that meet him here. In the case of facts the matter is comparatively simple: the mental state represented by tree, dog and house is easily acqt1ired; hut judgment is quite a different thing. It tnay sound simple but it is often the fruit of many years and much experience. Such ~ judgement, opinion, con- viction, 1 epresents a state of mind that cannot be gained from the words, yet every Tom, Dick and Harry thinks he understands. Opinions become a sort of small change in the pocket, to be jingled carel~ssly while one speaks. This tnust not be so with you. You must have convjctions of your own. You must try current beliefs. Patience is the indispensable virtue. Get the facts, as many as possible ; sort and sift tl1em; turn them over in your mind; attempt solutions and give them up; return to them again and again ; at last, perhaps like a flash of light, pe1•haps slowly, the truth will con1e. It is yours. It is not a matter of words any longer. It is more like a rich feeling. It is a &ort of conscience in the matter it concerns. Keep your mind full of problems to hope to solve. Do not yield an inch of compromise to dishnoetsy. It will take years and your con- clusions,, if good will se,enl com mt>n-place to those who do not understand; but it is the only way to strength and massiveness .of character ; and certainly the joy of this way o:f living pays well. But there is a higher point to be reached. It is not enough to understand the various convic- tions and views of a great n1an or a great system of thought; we next grasp the spirit of the man or the system; and this spirit is q_t1ite another thing from a surnning up of the parts that seem to compose it. It is a single .state of mind. Comparatively few persons reach this spirit; no one does it without patience and inspiration and and a special talent of spiritual grasp. But the true greatness of a great man is first evident to us, when we perserve this part of his nature. In Christianity the spiritual understanding is raised to an eminent position; and its attain- ment planned and recognized under the name of conversion; but there is equally a spiritual life in philosophy, in art, in history, in business, in every sphere of human power. Ther is no human greatness without it. The spiritual understanding of Christianity is an experience that every m.an ought to have if it is at all possible for him. This does not of necessity in1ply an acceptance of the faith but a strong grasp of what that faith is and what it seeks to do for mankind. Try to get this under- standing. Measure your power there for it will take all you have. If you win, whether you accept the faith or not, you will l1ave learned by experience what is meant by \worthy liv- ing.\ It will set your life upon a plane you may not dream of now. Nextto the Bible comes Shakespeare. These two books hold a unique position, as there is no third one with them. They a.re of profound importance to every n1an; and this is not from any superficial virtue, but because of the big and noble spirits that produced them as their .ex- pressions. Recognize this from the heginni ng. Y ouT goal must be the discovery of the spit-it of Shakespeare ; in the end you must feel as he felt when he wrote ; it must seem as if the words

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS. are proceeding from your heart, not any one else's. ) UNION A'T THE PQINCE HENRY DINNER To this end--- read and reread the plays. Read commenta1·ies. Comtnit passages if you like then11nuch. Think over the plays for your .. self. Discuss thern with congenial persons, but keep your words simple, honest and reverent. Understanding is not a matter of words. Don't '· take it too soberly, have your pleasure out of it. Be patient, and if you are able (for this tnust come frotn within you) sotne day Shakespeare himself will take form in the tnass of thoughts you have. You wiU know it if it happens. It will be like an awakening frotn sleep-, a surpris- ed awakening as to a new world- Some such ex- perience is at the bottom of all the highest cul- ture. No u1an who has felt what Shakespeare is can be a power for any thing that is not gentle and honest and rnanly. I trust that some of you are doing work that shall bear this fruit. Charles Emory Smith, '6r, editor of the Ph Ha- del phi a Press responded to the toast ·'Saxon Blood-What We Owe to Germany in Liter- ature, Art, Science and Music\ at the dinner given Wednesday evening, Februt:ry 26, at the Waldorf Astoria, New York City, in honor of Prince Henry of Prussia by the \' New York Staats-Zeitu ng.\ The toastmaster in introducing Mr. Smith said that Mr. Smith had been a tninisterofstate, a great editor and is known as the silver tongued orator of the press of America. Mr. Smith then said: ''The German literary revolution was con- temperaneous with the American political revolution. The dawn of high Gernutn aspira- tions for freedorn from the don1inion of fordgn thought and influence came with the dawn of true American aspirations for freedom from the dominion of foreign sovereignty and repression, and the two peoples who had within themselves so much of the promise and potency of progress marched forward side by side toward greater in- dividuality and impress in the world. Through that joint liberation came the feeling of the inde- pendent American that in the freedom of Ger- man intellectual life he found the true atmosphere of growth, and Gennan training and the German degree have been prized and required beyond all others for American academic advancement. COLLEGE TALK. John McNab, 'or, now a student at Auburn Theological Seminary, visited friends on college hill this week. Herman C. Kluge, 'o5, h~s been elected cap- tain of the Freshmen basket ball team. A game is to be arranged vYith the freshmen of Renssa- laer Polytechnic institute of Troy in the near future. The Union representatives who attended the Student Voluntee1· Convention held at Toronto, Feb. 28- Mar. 5, report a large gathering of students fron1 all over the world. About two hundred and sixty colleges and twenty-two countries were represented. LECTURE BY Pl{OF. BENNETT. Prof. John Ira Bennett will lecture before the Shakespeare Club on Tuesday evening, March r r, at 7 :30. on '' Shylock.\ This is probably the last lecture in the course. The debt we owe to Germany requires a pass- ing word on the philosophical speculation which bas been in such large degree the domi- nant note of her intellectual life. Germany has led the world in this field of inquiry, and it is only necessary to name I{ant and Liebnitz and Hegel and Schopenhauer to ern phasize her supremacy. Kindred to this realm is that of nutterial science, and the achievements of Hum- boldt, Liebig, Virchow and Helmholtz illustrate her tritnnphs. In art Germany points to the great names of Durer and Holbien, which glorified the renaiss- ance and of whom there are tnore significant examples in one or two pt'ivate American galeries than can be found anywhere else save in the greatest national collections.

To German music our obligations are im- measurable. 'The glow of German .genius falls on all scores and its light shines on all cotnposi- tions that .men call great. If all m11sic other than that of the chief German masters were lost we should still have all of the essentials and rnost of the work that the critical vvorld recog- nizes as possessing immortal beauty. Our debt is not alone or chiefly to individual achievetnents. It is to the character and con- · science ofthe Gertnan people. We are indebted to thetn for the honesty of their work, whether in literature, in science, in art or in tnusic. We are indebted to them for their probity, their good faith, their sincerity and earnestness, their spirit of truth and their fidelity of expression. Through their veins and through ours, refined through the centuries, flows the :s~me original strain of Saxon blood, always frank, 1nanly and true; and in the greetings of this hour and of this whole welcome visit of his 1~oyal highness · as the chosen and worthy representative of the . German etn peror and people we seal a new bond of friendship and join hands in the fellow- ship of nations.\ \THE CHQISTIAN MAN IN BUSINESS.\ Mr. Henry W. Darling, treasurer of the General Electric company spoke at the Vesper service in Silliman hall last Sunday, on, \The Christian Man in Business.\ The speaket· defined business as, \The process by which the pt·oducts and comn1odities of the world are marketed and exchanged.\ He then spoke at length of the characteristics essential to the successful business man and said that the best definition that he had ever heard of a successful business man was the following phrase, used by a reporter in describing a business man, \ He is a 1nat·vel of methodical industry.\ The cardinal virtues of the business rnan are all Christian characteristics and chief among them is integrity. The whole fabric of comtnerce, of credit and of international transactions is found- ded on this quality so essential to the business man. The transactions of the Stock Exchange 18 and of banks are based on this. Honesty is the best policy. The business tnan puts his character into his transactions whatever he happens to deal in and it bears fruit ~tccordingly. Hugh Miller said that the mason with whom he served his apprenticeship, \ put his Conscience into every 1 1 \l\ stone 1e • a1c. In closing the speaker decried the mad rush for riches that is constantly going on and said : \·God can put into a 1nan's heart new motives that will make him more diligent than the love of riches can- that will make hin1 full of use- fulness and helpfulness.-\ PHI GAMMA DELTA AT WHIST.

I ( '· The ConcordiGJlsis VoL. XXV. UNION COLLEGE, MARCH 13, 1902. No. 19. SHYLOCK. .[Text of a lectnre delivered by Prof. Jehn I. Bennett before the Shakespeare Club on March 11.] On the occasion of Sir Henry Irving's recent visit to Albany it was my privilege to see him as Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant o.f Venz'ce. I thought at the time that his rendering of the part., wonderful as it was in som,e respects, \Vas as a whole little better better than a caricature. · But on re-reading the play I came to the con- clusion that Irving's characterization is sub- stantially correct. My own conception of Shylock wa~ something like this: Shylock is a Jew. He is therefore persecuted, and being persecuted he is become suspicious, cruel, vin- dictive. I am aware that this view is not without its element of truth, nor without its stout champ- ions either. It·ving hitnself was once among them if we may judge from the account of his first appearance in the part in 1874, which is quoted in the Appendix to Furness' Variorum Edition of The Merchant of Venz\ce ; but per- secution while it is not wholly lacking as an element in Shakespeare's depiction of Shylock, is a much less conspicuous one than is commonly supposed. Irving has now t·educed it to the minimum and his conception of the part is quite the opposite of the one I have stated: Shylock is suspicious, cruel, vindictive ; therefore a Jew and persecuted. This, I think, is much nearer to Shakespeare's Shylock than the other view. Indeed the faults in Irving's rendering of the part are not in his interpretation as a whole, but in details of elocution and of acting. It is precisely the avoidance of such eccentricities, let me say in passing, that makes Ellen Terry's Portia perfect. I am aware that Shylock is not Portia, but by your leave, neither is Irving Ellen Terry. Ellen Terry is not eccentric. Neither is Shakespeare. * * * * * * Here Prof. Bennett read some lines \ A Tribute to a Door Mat.\ Continuing he said: ''At all events the lines rnay hardly be said to have the quality of Shakespeare, even of Shakespeare's prose, but if the thing is to be intolerably mouthed and gurgled and nosed, will not the door n1at do as weH as these words of Shy lock? \ Hath not a Jew eyes ? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affec· tions, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subjeot to the same diseases, healed by the sa~me means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and sun1n1er as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us do we not laugh? If you poison us do we not die; and if you wrong us shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we t·esemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Ch.ristian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian exa tnple? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it will go hard, but I will better the instruction.\ · No, No! Let us give the Devil his due though he can\ cite Scripture for his purpose.'' We've paid the price of admission. We'll hear the words. * * * * * These deductions then (and manner makes or mars the perfect work in acting Shakespeare) must be made from Irvingjs rendering of Shy lock. If we disagree with the rest, I suspect that it is because the wish is father of the thought. But we have no right to believe what we wish to be- lieve in reading an author. Our duty is to un- derstand him and his thoughts and not merely to fasten our own thoughts and opinions upon him. After we do understand him, we may agree with him or disagree with hin'l, but that is a different matter. There is a Greek proverb which says that \the unflogged man is not educated.\ Now one of the most necessary delusions to flog out of a tnan, but withal one of the rnost difficult is precisely this, that he can put into his author the

6 THE CONCORDlENSIS. meaning that most suits his own view. Toenight I should like to flog out of tnyself n1y own pre- conceptions with regard to Shylock, and to try to find out \Vhat Shakespeare's conception of , hiln was. And perha pi the first step to take will be to consider what the status of Jew was in England, during and just prior to Shake- speare's time. It was long supposed that the edict of Edward I in I 290 drove the Jews out of England as effectually as St. Patrick's staff drove all .. venomous beasts out of Ireland, the progenitors ofTammany excepted. It was further supposed that Jews did not return to England until they were permitted to do so by legal enactment under the Protectorate. Certain it is though that there was a goodly sprinkling of Jews in England in Shakespeare's time and certain it is too that as a tace they were looked upon as they are to this day in some less enlightened countries than our own. Jew-baiting would seetn to have been in about as good esteetn as bear-baiting. The most remarkable expression of this national an- tipathy prior to Shakespeare ·s time is Mar- lowe's 'few of Mala written in I 588 or there- abouts. This play is important alike as an evi- dence of the popular feeling with regard to the Jews, and as an anticipation of Shakespeare's \Merchant of Venz\c.\ * * * * * Prof. Bennett then gave an outline of Mar- lowe's play. This Congreiee of blood and thunder seems absurd enough to us, but never think it did ~n its own day and age; on the contra.1y it was perhaps the prin1e favorite among English tragedies for a considerable term of years. Nor ever think that Marlowe was a weakling. At the time of his death (he died at the age of twenty-nine) he was a poet of greater promise and of greater per. formance too tban Shakespeare himself, who was but two months his junior ; and as it is, his is generally agreed.to be the second greatest name in the history of English dramatic litertaure. And further, you have but to read The Yew of Malta in detail, to see how heavy a tribute Shakespeare laid upon this very play in writing The Merchaut o.f Venlce. He borrowed from its characters, he bot-rowed from its situations, he borrowed h:om its very lines, always ot course itnproving what he took as. was his wont. However, a.B this is aside from my present purpose, for I have spoken of Marlowe's play sotnewhat at length merely to introduce it as a document in evidence with regard to the popular feeling toward the Jew in Marlowe's and Shakespeare's day. It has to he sure other n1otives especially in tbe first two acts, but after the beginning oft be third act, it rapidly becomes a patnphlet of race hatred and so ·continues to the end. In 1594 there occured in London an incident which strongly evidenced the popular hatred of the Jew, and which probably influenced Shake- speare a good deal in writing The Merchant cif Venz\ce. There was at that time in London, a Jewish doctor named Roderigo Lopez, who by his abilities had gained the favor of tnany persons ofnote and had risen to be the physician to the Queen herself. Sotne tin1e previously there had come to England a Portuguese refugee named Antonio Perez, a pretender to the throne of Portugal. He and his designs were entertained ~itl1 favor, because of the strong anti-Spanisl1 sentirnent which was then prevalent in England, for Philip of Spain was plotting to annex Portugal, and Perez might be made an instru- n\lent to thwart his purpose. Lopez was n1ade interpreter to Perez but in the end quarrelled with him, for Perez was a disagreeable fellovv and managed to incur the emnity of all who had to do with him. Indeed Lopez finally entered in to a· plot to poison the pretender. The first time Perez was taken sick, he should die he said. Later Lopez was urged to join a conspiracy against the Queen's life, which he refused to do ; but Exeter, animated by a private grudge, ex- torted some incritninating evidence from hin1·by torture, and though his guilt was never proved to the satisfaction of the Queen, she finally con- sented to his execution, a11d he was hanged in the presence of a delighted populace amid cries of \ He is a Jew.\ The outburst of race hatred wl1ich was provoked by this occurence was imtnense. There were twenty representations of The Yew cif Matla before the end of the year. Perez, the plot against his life having r L i ) ' .. ' I I. 1. I

THE CON'CORDIENSIS. 7 come to light, became a kind of hero, and it is conjectured, not with()'Ut good show of reason, that Shakespeare named after him, the title characte1· in The Merckant of Venice, which was written before 1598 and therefore while the epi&ode was still fresh in the popular mind ; for race emnities are slow to a bate. Would Sb.akespeare have allowed hin1self to be infL.1enced by such ;prejudices? No doubt, To be sure he has said some bitter words about the rabble, but mostly in character, or a least of such a sort as he hardly thought his own rabble could take to heart ; for be has a keen eye to the prejudices of his audience and not unfrequently strikes to them. Besides, Shakespeare was none too fond of the Jevvs himself. \Jew is one of his stock epithets ofot>probrium,\ \a Jew and a Hebrew\ iss ahade worse, and Sir John thinks he has laid himself under the n1ost horrible of oaths of self condemnation when he says \I atn a Jew, else an Ehrew Jew.\ \Liver of blaspheming Jew\ is, as you retnember an1ong the ingredients of the vvitches broth jn 1VIacbeth, and it must be said that it is in very noxious cotnpany in the incantation. Was this for the groundlings only? Hardly, else it would not be iterated so often. Shake- speare is pretty apt in his profanity. No, I be- lieve that in this respect Shakespeare was a true child of his age, a child of his time and not o1 eternity. It was a case of imperfect sympathy and tllore than two hundred years later, Charles Lamb, the most lovable of English authors, so far as I know, next to Shake~peare, analyzed the feeling about as it is personified in Shylock. ·\I have, in the abstract, no disrespect for Jews. They are a piece of antiquity compared with which Stonehenge is in its nonage. They date beyond the Pyramids. But I could not care to be in habits of familiar intercourse with any of that nation. I confess that I have not the nerves to enter their synagogues. Old prejudices cling about us. I cannot shake off the story of Hugh of Lincoln. Centuries .of injury, contempt and hate, on the one side, of cloaked revenge and hate, on the other, between our and their fathers, must and ought to affect the blood of the children. I cannot believe it ca11 run clear and kindly yet; or that a few fine words such as can dour, liberaHty, the light of the nineteenth century, can close up the breaches of so deadly a disunion. A Hebrew is nowhere congenial to me. He is least distasteful to me on 'Change- for the mere anti le spirit levels all distinctions, as all are beauties in the dark. I boldy confess I do not relish the approximation of Jew and Christian, which has becotne so fashionable. The re- ciprocal endearn1ents have, to me, something hypocrHical and unnatural in them. I do not like to see the Church and Synagogue kissing and congeeing in awkward posturesofanaffected civility. If they are coverted, why do they not cotne over to us altogether? Why keep up a form of separation when the life of it is fled? If they can sit with us at table, why do they keck at our cookery? I do not understand these half convertites. Jews christian izing- Christians judaizing-puzzle me. I like fish or flesh. A moderate Jew is a more confounding piece of anomaly to me than a wet Quaker.\ So spake Charles Lamb some eighty years ago. Surely those eighty years have not\ closed up the breaches of the deadly disunion\ which being bred of a distortion of true religion follows the persecuted as an evil fate followed the house Labdacus. Yet the disunion is not so great as it was even eighty years ago. In Shakespeare's time it was very g-reat, and he was heir to it. Be it temetllbered further, that in the outset, Shylock was deemed a comic part, that it soon became a low comedy part, that it continued as such for a full century and a half, that Shylock was then transforn1ed into an odious villain of the sort that we have in mind when we speak of a Shylock, and that no brief was really held for the Jew until r8r4, when Edtnund Kean, as Furness says, first represented hin1 as tnore sinned against than sinning. The part is generally agreed to be essentially tragic now, but actors and play-goers and readers of Shakespeare are still pros and cons with regard to Shylock, just as they are mads and no-mads and north- northwest-mads with regard to Hamtet. Irving, though be seems to have started as a partisan of Shylock, is now, I beleive, pretty frankly his foe. Is Irving right? I think so; but let us

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. refer the questions to certain passages irt the play itself. These passages I have not chosen. I think, as the advocate of a particular view. My own predisposition was, as I have said, for Shylock and against Irving; but I have gone over the play with some care, and I beleive that my predisposition was wrong. Turn we to the third scene of the first act. Shylock and Bassanio enter in conversation about the proposed loan. \ Three thousand ducats ; well?\ \Aye sir, for three months.\ \ For three months; well?\ \ For the which, as I told you Antonio shall be r·ound.\ \Antonio shall become bound; well?\ Shylock's is a higgling tone, nor is this tone merely a disguise of other feelings. There is sotnethingofdisguise about it, hutitisre.,'ll withal. \May I speak with Antonio?\ says Shylock. '' If it please you to dine with us.\ \Yes to smell pork; to eat the habitation which your prophet the Nazarene conjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you.\ This is to us a perfectly explicable retort but racial to say the least, and cannot have been much to the liking of Shakespeare's England ; and it is. to be observed that the con- clusion of the whole matter is as market question \What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?\ And when Antonio enters this is Shylock's aside: \How like a fawning publican he looks! I hate him for he is a Christian; But more for that in low simplicity He lends out tnoney gratis, and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice. If I can catch hin1 once upon the hip, I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him, He hates our sacred nation, and he rails, Even there where merchants most do congregate, On me, may bargains, and my well-won thrift, Which he calls interest, bursed be my trite If I forgive him.\ Usance and Jerusalem here contend for Shylock, and Jerusalem con1es in second, longo sed z\ntervalls. Aftet Shylock's disquisition about eanling.s, Antonio suggests that gold and silver are not ewes and rams. ''I cannot tell\ says Shy lock. \I make it breed as fast\ \Mark you this Bassanio\ says Antonio lnreply, \The Devil can cite Scripture for his purpose,'' Shylock being the Devil, and Antonio, though not per- haps flautless in our sight, yet a very estimable person in the play. Now'' Devil\ is an epithet which is applied to Shylock with some iteration and usually in damnatory contexts; and I feel about Shy lock the Devil in the play, very much as I do about Diabolus himself, the false accuser ; the wily one; Satan, the adversary, '·the fine gentleman\ as Fluellen calls him: where there is so much smoke there must be some fire. Take we this from Shy lock : \Siginor Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and usances: Still have I borne it with. a patient shrug, For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe. You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog, And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine.'' A vile affront to spit upon his Jewish gaber- dine ; a vile affront indeed ! We are with Shylock here. I would as leave let a 1nan tread on the tail of tny coat as spit upon my gaber- dine. And should he tread on the tail of my coat because I a111 a Christian~ me thinks I would essay sorne pagan retaliations. \ Or\ says Shylock, \Shall I bend low and in a bondsman's key With bated breath, and whisperinghumbleness Say this:- 'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last; You spurn'd me such a dag; another time You call' d me dog; and for these courtesies I'll lend you thus much. monies?'\ Bravo ! Shylock. This is from '' moneys and usances\ to gaberdine as it should be; but this is also from Shylock to Antonio. It is not customary to show one's hand before playing the cards. Shylock to Shylock went from ga- berdine to the market place. And Antonio's hard reply,

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 '' I am as like to call thee _so again, To spit on thee again, to spurn thee !too. If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not As to thy friends, for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his frieud? But lend it r'ather to thy enemy; Who if he break, thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty.\ This reply, I say though it may jar on us some- what, was I doubt not, widly applauded by pit and galleries. Gobbo, Launelot Gobbo, ( delici<Jus name) being duly sworn deposeth and saith as follows: -\ Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my 1naster. The fiend is at n1ine elbow, and tetnpts n1e, saying to ,me, \Gobbo Launcelot Gobbo, good Launct:lot,' or 'good Gobbo' or' goo(l Launcelot Gobbo,' use your legs, take the start, run a·way.' My con- science says, 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot ; take heed, honest Gobbo ; 'or as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo ; do not run ; sco1·n running with thy heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack: 'Via ! says the fiend ; ' away!' says the fiend; for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,' says the fiend, ' and run.' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, ' My h<>nest friend Launcelot, being an honest man's son,' or rather being an honest won1an's son :-for indeed my father did something smakc, something grow to, he had a kind of taste ;-Well, my conscience says, 'Launcelot, budge not!\ ' Budge,' says the fiend. ' Budge not,' says my conscience. 'Consc1ence,' say I,' you counsel well:' 'fiend,' say I, ' you counsel well : ' to be rnled by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my tnas- ter, who, God bless the mark ! is a kind of devil ; and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil hitnself. Certainly, the Jew is the devil incarnal; and in my conscience! my con- science is bnt a kind of hard conscience, to ofier to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives t11e more friendly counsel : I will run, fiend ; my heels are at your comtnandment ; I will run.\ Why did Gobbo's conscience give him less friendly counsel than the fiend? Well, I must disclaim all responsibility for Launcelot Gobbo's conscience, but I certainly can see nothing in Gobbo's implied portrait of his master to make hitn keck and squearn at fight, and certain it is that Gobbo thought \ the devilhimself\ a master preferable to \ the very devil in- carnal,\ to wit the Jew. And Gobq_o, be it said, was not of a ver_y morose or brooding dis- position. Jessica in bidding him good-bye says : I atn sor,ry thou wilt leave my father so: Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.\ Why was the house hell? For the same reason, I suppose, as t'other places of the same name is, rnd that reason being personified, was \ the very devil incarnal, \ to wit the Jew. When Launcelot is gone, Jessica says : \Alack what heinous sin is it in me, To be ashamed to be my father's child! But though I am a daughter to his blood, I am not to his manners. '' We barely escape hating Jessica by remember- ing all this, and Shakespeare did not frame her to be hated. * * * * * * * Skip we the daughter, the ducats, the daugh- ter, the Christian ducats, the Justice, the law, the ducats, the daughter, the sealep bags of ducats, the double ducats, the jewels, the stones and the ducats ; and let us not ''bait fish withal,'' nor say aught of Leah's ring worth \a wilderness of tnonkeys\ and therefore worth several wilder- nesses of ducats, of ducats, of ducats; nor let us hale Antonio to prison to the tume of\ I'll have my bond,\ but having \ exhaled \him let us go forthwith to the court of justice. Now this trial scene, in spite ofthe Shylock's monstrous and vindictive cruelty, in spite of the wheiting of the knife, in spite of the scales, in spite of the convincing loveliness of Portia, in spite of the joy that con1es with the thwarting of a vengeful purpose, seems to me inexpres- sibly sad. ·As Shy lock staggers from the court- room deprived of everything he holds most dear, his daughter, his wordly wealth, yes even his re- ligion, I can hear nothing but the taunts of Gratiano and they sound most harsh and cruel

10 THE CONCORDIENSIS. in my ears. Yet it is not so nominated in the play. Here was tne height of the tnerriment, and Gratiano was the wag of the day. The young lady who sotnething less than a hundred years ago, I believe, exclaitned as Shylock made his exit, \ The man is wronged,\ was the first to pity the Jew so far as the records tell us, and she pitied him from her own good heart; for the intent of the scene is clear; never was there a more exultant hun1bling of a man, than the humbling and gravelling of Shylock. And what is that precious fifth act but the joyous epilogue to Shylock's so1-row? Happy, all happy, and none more so than Jessica. How does it happen then that Shylock starting cotnic, falling to low comedy and sounding the depths of ridicule, has come to be tragic? For nobody takes Shylock otherwise than seriously now. We may laugh, at his \ducats and his daughter\ but we do not laugh at him. VVe pity him or we hate him. Is this because Shakespeare as he w1·ote The Merchant of Venlce had one eye on his audience, and one on posterity and the altruism of the twentieth cen- tury? Hardly. Shakespeare was no squint eyed genius, and he cared about as much for posterity per se as the coal barons of Pennsy 1- vania do ; not enough to have his plays publish- ed. He sold them to the theatre and there was an end. That was his publication, and the audiences his public. By the way did you ever hear a tnart make a speech to posterity? His hearers yawn and posterity does not last to the peroration. No, if Shakespeare thought of the matter at all, and perhaps he did, he probably thought of it in this fashion : \The best way for me to hit posterity, is to hit tny auditors. They are men of like passions with myself; therefore I will give them men of like passions with us all, -like passions, though not perhaps the same passions. At the satne titne I will do them the honor to suppose that they will be in- terested, all of them or many of them, in what I have wrought with care and pains with love and hate.\ And so when he came to write his pre· scription for Shy lock, it was something like this:-\ In1primis, an intellect and cunning, twice a match for anybody in the play save dearest Portia; second, lz'ver of blaspheming Jew;\ third, moneys and usances; fourth, last and all the thne Dr. Lopez, Hugh o.f Llncoln, Gernutus ; a bas des :Juifs ! Lay this on with a trowel. They'll like it and I believe I do myself. Net result, tnirth a plenty, but a viii ian who is big enough and huma11 enough to hate.\ And right here it will be worth our while to revert for a moment to Marlowe's Barabas. Marlowe wrote the Barabas of his first two acts for an audience of men. Curtain ; third act; audience of prejudice and prejudice only. End of fifth act, Barabas in cauldron; bitteJ glee ; tragic. Enter twentieth century altruism ; Barabas a clown. Shakespeare's Merchant of Venlce Act I, Sc. 3 ; enter Shylock. Audience of prejudice and men. Act IV, Sc. I ; exit Shylock. Audience still prejudice and still men .. Great glee, '' sweet in the mouth, hut bitter in the belly.\ Enter twentieth century altruism ; less prejudice and more men; Shylock still odious but still human, and therefore tragic and pitiable withal. '' F acllz\s desceusus Averno,\ dramatically speaking. Barabas is there. Shylock, to be sure can never reach the stars. Shakespeare has p.ut certain smirches upon him which would make him look more like a dish pan in the spangled sky than a \patine of bright gold.\ But he has improved with age, and the shade of Shakespeare and the spirit of our age alike may plun1e themselves upon that.

During the present session of Congress 1,HE SATURDAY EvENING PosT, of Philadelphia, will contain bi-weekly articles on national affairs by the former Postmaster-General. Honorable Charl~s Emory Smith, Union, '6r. In Men and Measures at Washington Mr. Smith will discuss the great legislative and diplomatic questions of the day, explaining the news of the week and giving a clear presentation of National policies and politics. Mr. Smith's long familiarity with public affairs, his shrewd political insight and his brilliant literary style combine to make these papers of unusual interest. The lighter side of Washington life, the amusing happenings, the current gossip and bright sayings are found in a new departtnent, entitled A Woman's Washington. These bright letters ate by the author of The Diary of a New Congressman's Wife. A challenge has been received from the Yale Law School Baseball managetnent, for a gatlle to be:played son1e time in May. Although there are tnany good players atnong the Law-men, as evidenced by the number of candidates for the 'Varsity nine frotn the School, it is dGubtful if this proposition will be accepted, as it would necessitate the cornplete organization of a team, and to do this for but one game is not deemed advisable. Badger, '03, has been confined to the hospital for some time with a severe attack of typhoid. I It is understood that he is now convalescent,. and the junior class at a special meeting held Monday noon, voted to send the invalid a slight testin1onial of the regard of his class-mates as has been don.e on several previous occasions in I similar cases. The 'o2 rnen who recently passed the State Bar Examinations were sworn in :as Attorneys and Counsellors at the present tenn of the Appel- late Division, Third Department. Interest continues un-abated in the Moot-court work carried on by the juniors. The \ Court of Appeals \ has decided the case of Ever dell vs. Hill in favor of the plaintiff-appellant, in which case Richerd C. S. Drummond was attorney for plaintiff, and Norman N. Britton for defendent. In the \ Appellate Division \ the case of Jones vs. Spencer was argued on March 3d., by Dyer & Smith for defendant-appellant and Hotaling & Rogers for plaintiff, respondent. The decisiou of the court will be rendered Wednesday even- ing of this week. Judge Landon began his course of lectures on \Evidence\ on the roth., to the seniors. The Dean lectured on Monday to the juniors on the Statutory Construction Act, and on Tuesday be- gan the lectures to the satnc class on Torts. Judge Tennant returned on Monday after a week's absence and was heartily received by everyone.

The track management havearrang_ ed for an inter-class indoor meet to be held in the g-ymnasium which began on Wednesday, March 12 and ends on March 14. The usual indoor events will be run off and it is hoped that by this 1neet any latent ability in any man in college will be discovered. The freshtnan class, so far, has made the largest number of entries which is a very encouraging sign. Base-ball The necessity for the immediate Subscriptions. payment of all subscriptions for baseball does not seem to be re- alized by the students. Theprospects for a succesful season were never brighter, a good schedule of games has been arranged, an u.n- •. usual number of candidates have appeared,. the :first game is on Apri112, with West Point-· what other argument could be used? The subscriptions should be paid and paid at once. Commendable Position. The Senior class is to be con- gratulated for the position they have taken in regard to the wear- ing of caps and gowns. The Concordiensis realizing the importance of keeping up the cus·tom and the improvement that could he made in it, has endea- vored to arouse interest in the question by showing the advantages of ·retaining the custom, and to this end numerous editorials relative to this subject have appeared. Whether they were read or whether they had any influence in the decision of the class is another question, it remains that they appeared. Upon examinat1on it will be found that the time for wearing this kind of dress for Seniors is being lengthened at all the larger in- stitutions and is being taken up more and more by the smaller colleges. It is a dignified uniform marking the close of many years spent in study. Worn by Seniors only, it serves to unite them more closely in the last days of their course. TELEPHONE FOQ SILLIMAN HALL.

THE CONCORDIENS18. 13 WILLIAM H. SEWA~D AT UNION COLLEGE. [Extracts from his Autobiography, publlshed in 1891, and from the • Memoir' by George E .. Eaker, prefixed to his Works• published in 1853.] The eventful career of Union's Greatest Alum- nus is replete with concern to Americans, irrespect of political creed, and especially should the incidents of the years. r816 to 182o-when he \-vas a student, inte1~est Union students of to-day. With this hope, these quotions are made. ,,, At Schenectady I alighted on the banks of the Mohawk River, then navigated with\ bateaux.'' I climbed the College Hill with a reluctant and etnbarrassed step, to offer rnyself for an examination at which I feared I might not pass. I called at the office of the registrar, Mr. Holland, and by him was itntnediately introduced into the presence of the Pre>fessor of Mathemetics and Natural Philosophy. The college catalogue, which I had carefully read, described him as the Rev. Thomas J\!1 cCauley, Doctor ot Divinity and Doctor of Laws. I wondered at my pre- sun'lption in coming into so high a presence. The professor inquired which of the classes I supposed myself prepared to enter. I summon- ed boldness to answer .that I had studied for examination to enter the junior class. He im- mediately put tne through a series of questions for half an hour, in several preparatory class books, and pronounced me more than qualified. He then asked my age, and on receivtng the answer '' fifteen \ he replied that my studies had carried me beyond my years; the laws of the college making sixteen the age for entering the junior class. I did not regret the decision. Life at college seemed very attractive. and my previous excess of preparation would make my studies easier. Long before night, my \ chum\ was chosen, my room supplied with the cheap futniture which the college regulations required, as I sat down to meditate on the dignity of my new situation. I was matriculated as sopho- more ; and these two large words signified, for me, a great deal, because I had not the least idea of the meaning of either.\ ''Union College was now, in 1816, at, or near the heig,ht ·of its prosperity. The Presi$ dent, Dr. N0tt, ranked with the most popular preachers of the day; while hi:s great political talents secured him the patronage of all the public .tnen .in the State. The discipline of the college was based on the soundest and \visest principles. There was an absence of everything inquisitorial or suspicious; there were no courts or 1m peachments ; every young 1nan had his appointed studies, recitations and attendance at prayers ;. and a detneanor was required which , should not disturb the quiet or order of the insti- tution. If he failed or offended, he was privately called into· the presence of the president or pro- fessor, remonstrated with, and admonished that repeated fai:lure would be tnade known to his parents for their consideration, while habitual insubordination would be visited with distnissal. I think I know of no institution where a manlier spirit prevailed among the undergraduates than that whic11 distinguished the pupils of Dr. Nott. \ I cannot speak so highly of the sy~tem of instruction. There was a daily appointmeat of three tasks~ in as many different studies, which the pupils were 1·equired, unaided, to master in their rooms,. the young, the dull, and the back- ward, equaHy with the r:nost mature and the most astute. The pupil understood that he per- fanned his whole duty when he 1·ecited these daily lessons without failure. \iVith most of us the memory was doubtless the faculty chiefly exercised; and where so much was comtnitted mechanically to memory, rnucl1 \vas forgotten as soon as learned. It was a consequence of the method of instt·uction that every study was not a continuous one, but consisted of fragmentary tasks, while no one volutne or author was ever completed.'' ''Finding, in my Latin author, passages too obscure t<> be solved unaided, I went freely, though meekly, to the tutor, .and obtained his assistance during the study hours. Soon after- ward the leading members of the class, with the support of tl1e rest, determined to oblige the accomplished tutor to give then1 shorter lessons and more frequent holidays. 1'hey atternpted to effect this by throwing asafootida on the heated

Of course he found out the offenders, and of course they were punished. 1'he whole class, suspected an in- forn1er; and who cou~d the inform.er be but my- self, who excelled them all in the recitations, who refused to go into the general n1eeting and who was seen daily going to a11d from the tutor's room upon son1e errand unexphtined ? Thts, I think, was my first experience of partisan excite- ment. I need not say that I never afterward offended my classmates by seeking to obtain special instructions or aid from my teacher.\ On January I, r 819, Seward, who was then a senior and had become involved in debts to \the accotnplished tailors of Schenectady,'' left college to teach in the South, sperding six months in Georgia. He subsequently returned to college and graduated the next year. ''A new state of things had occurred during the year of ·my absence frotn the college. Pre- viously to that event, the students from the North and the South mingled pro1niscuously and mingled harn1oniously together. U t. ion College during that year received a large accession of . \Southerners.\ Previous to their coming, the students were divided between the two literary societies, the one '~the Philon1athean,\ the other ''the Adelphic,\ which were nearly coeval with the college itself. Of these, the Philotnathean was the larger and the n1ore popular, as it claimed to be, by a year or two, the more ancient. I belonged to the Adelphic, which, at the tin1e, cousole<? itself for its in- feriority of numbers by pretensions to superior - --·- --- -····· scholarship. The Southerners,, on their arrival at the college, had joined the Philomathean, but soon afterward had complained of oppres- sion, seceded and organized a third society, under the nan1e of the \ Delphian Institute.\ \ The division of the Philomathean Society, not unnaturally agitated the Adelphic, leading members of which anticipated an increase of their own strengh from the di,minution of the numbers and prestige of their great rival, the Pbilomathean. The agitation drew into dis- cussion the relative merits of Southern and Northern Society. It seen1ed to be believed by both parties that the opinions I should express, after having had a six months' experience in the South would carry weight. The Philomatheans clain1ed my sympathy on the ground of the character which I had established for it_depend- ence. The Adelphic symathizers with the seceders claimed my adhesion on the ground of loyalty to the institution to which I belonged, and which had crowned m.e with all its little . . honors. Thus at an early date, bifore my educational course was ended, I stood upon the threshold cif natlonaljolitlcs. I promptly decided that the Southern secession was unjusti- fiable and disloyal to the institution, while I made due acknowledgments of the hospitable and chivalrous character of the South.\ ''My chef d'oeuvre in the Literary Society was an essay in which I den1onstrated that the Erie Canal was an impossibility, and that, even if it should be successfully constructed, it would financially t·uin the State. On the other hand, the subject of n1y cotnmencement oration was, \The Integrity of the American Union.\ SW·ELL CUT GARMENTS. NO FANCY PRICES.

\If I were required now to say from what part of my college education I derived the greatest advantage, I should say, the exercises of the Adelphic Society.'' \' The college career of young Sewat·d,\ observes his biographer, \as related by his con- tempories, gave ·brilliant indication of the rare qualities for which he has becutne distinguished. The traits of the future leg isla tor and statesn1an were foreshadowed in the character of the modest youtl1 during his period of academic re- tirement. \F- ven then he displayed great originalty of conception -the sturdy i ndepend- ence of purpose- the firm adherence to his con- victions of right- the intrepid assertion of high n1oral principles- the careful exarnination of a cause before appearing in its defence-the sympathy with the weak and oppressed- and the intellectual vigilance and assiduity in the pursuit of tl1e truth, which have formed such conspicious and admirable features in his public career.\ W. H. A., 'oz. CHI PSI CONVENTION. To be held with the Union Chapter on May 14, 15 and 16. The sixty-first annual convention of the Chi Psi fraternity will be held in this city, ~lay 14th~ 15th and 16th, in the new lodge of the local chaptel', which is now nearing con1pletion. Delegates from 18 Alphas will attend, represent- ing a nutnber of the E1stern colleges, including \Villiams, Amherst, Cornell, 1-lamilton, Rut- gers, Stevens Institution of Technology, Lehigh, in the middle west, Michigan, Wisconsin, l\1in- nesota and Chicago, and in the far west, Leland Stanford and California universities. 1'he dele- gates and visitors will be tendered a stnol<:er in the lodge on Wednesday evening and a banquet in the Ten E:yck, in Albany, on Friday evening. The remaining three days will be devoted to the transaction of fraternity business. TQACK PaOSPECTS. Th~ prospects for a first class track team this year cannot be said to be the bi'ightest. The loss of Weed, Kline, Stack and Langlois will make the team materially weaker tha.n it was last 15 year as far as the three upper classes are concern- ed. There seems to be, however, some promis- ing material in the freshtna n dass which may sl1.ow up well in ti1ne. As no inter-class tneet was held last f\lll nothing difinite is known as to just what this material is w<>Tth. T'he only meet that is definitely scheduled as Jet is the meet with New York University. The n1eet at Rochester, Decoration day, of cout·se was cancelled by Union's withdrawal from the league. An inter-class tneet is being held this week to a waken interest in track athletics, and both captain and manager are doing all that they can to form a good teatn. Whether they do or not rests largely with the student body, as they must receive sotnething more than the half-hearted support which has hitherto been accorded to track athletics. Among those who V\ 7 ill try for the team are: in the jumps, Griffith, Rutledge, Oltnsted and Rayn1ond; pole vault, Raymond, and Anns; weights, Finegan, Patton and Becker; long and n1iddle distance runs~ Hawkes, Finegan, Hoadley, Parker, Benning, Becker and Kluge; hut·dles, Griffith, Olmsted, King and Raymond; sprints, Griswold, Arms and Stevens.

Enough has been said to show that this n1ove- ment is not only of interest as a distinctively religious enterprise, but ft·om its very immensity and daring claims the attention of all who are interested in great student undertakings.

The Garnet has been in the bands of the printer for some titne, and that portion of the task of bringing out the annual is nearly com- pleted. A generous response was n1ade to the appeal for n1ore literatary contributions and with the possible exception of short stories, there is a large variety of n1atter frotn which to choose. Several members of the faculty have generously consented to aid by preparing tnemorial artkles, for which, the board desires to express at this time its grateful appreciation. It is difficult to state postively the date at which this volume will be ready for delivery as everything now depends on the dispatch with which the printing is finished and the binding accomplished. Although theoretically the board of editors is an active agent, collecting material here and there and then after it has been sifted and arranged, ruslung- this book in the raw, through the form of book-n1aking, yet actually \by your leave,\ the board is a rnere slave; first, of the contributors, secondly, of the book- makers. All of which goes to show that the Board of Editors is trying to withdraw from the position taken when the announcement of an early issue of the Garnet was rnade. This is not, how eve:, the case.

They investigate profitable questions and have lectures on practical and prominent questions of the day. THE SCIENCE OF SOCIOLOGY. A list of books on sociology given by the present senior class to the college library is given in another column in this number. This admirable plan for securing ·a proper list of hooks for the use of students in sociology was inaugurated by the class of '98, acting on the suggestion of Dr. Frederick Robertson Jones. 'fhis class gave a 1 ist of about forty books on Normal Sociology. The example set by this class has been followed by each senior class since. Concerning this m,ethod and sociology in general, Dr. Jones has this to say in a num- ber of the Concordiensis for last year: ''A mere glance at the list is sufficient to show the value of the acquisition and the importance of such literature to the work: of sociology. In present- ing the. books, the class has followed the com- mendab1e precedents established by the four preceding graduating classes. The sum spent for these books represent net library prices and is exclusive of costs for carriage. The books have been selected with care and with a vei w to their especial adaptability to the needs .of the class, and the subjects and methods of the course. These gifts were suggested by the unsur- mountable difficulties experienced in following the course in sociology properly withoqt the \ authorities\ for the purpose of collateral read- ing. There were practically no books in the library on the subject from \1\- .. hich assignments could be tnade to suppletnent the lectures. The nature aud scope oft he subject rnake the lecture and library ,methods the only methods that can be followed advantageously. This necessitates a large,, well-chosen and well-balanced collection of books on normal and pathological sociology. This want the senior classes have generously atten1pted to supply, until now we have built up a fairly good working library. Tl1e scope of the subject is so vast and its treattnent up to the present time so unscientific that no satisfactory text-book has been evolved. 1.'he \ doctors\ are still disputing over every essentia1 element connected with its treatment. The fundamentals of the science are conse- quently in the air and it will take time for them

THE CON·CORDIENSIS. 7 to be shaken down sufficiently to admit of that orderly scientific treatm,ent that will make pos- sible a satisfactory text-book. It is altogether intelligible that such should be the case; for while none will deny the vital importance of the study, yet all will recognize that its very nature makes the estahlishn1ent of bounds and limitations difficult. Thi~ is true in the early development of aU sciences and one would nat- urally expect to find it even more obvious in the evolution of sociology. In may not be the ali- inclusive science that some of its over-zealous disciples would have it, but it is all-permeating. It treats of man in his relations to other men and these relations are innumerable in their variety, and boundless in their scope.'' '~This device as followed by the senior classes gives the class access to a large number of books, and e'\1ables the instn1ctor to carry on the work in a systematic manner. Assigned readings in the various books along special lines, give the student a broad knowledge of the subject matter, acquaint him with authors of I world-wide reputation, and point out to him the weak and strong points in the arguments of each.\ \SONGS OF THE EASTERN COLLEGES.\ 'fhe Concordiensis acknowledges the receipt of an up-to-date book, called \Songs of the Eastern Colleges.\ The book is edited by Robert W. Atkinson of Harvard, and Ernest Carter of Princeton. The Editors have collect- ed a large number of popular college songs of the Eastern institutions into a volutne which ts bound to have a large sale among college tnen. It takes the place of older editions of college songs which have become antiquated. It should produce a closer union among the Eastern col- leges possessing as it does a strong loyal senti- ment. Union is represented by \ Song to Old *' Union\ by Fitzhugh Ludlow, Union, '76, one of her representative songs. The book is very attractively bound in green cloth having a poster design in c.olors of a tally- ho party on the cover. Price, $r .25.

This gave it a rank with the leading universities of Spain. At the beginning of the Spanish-An1erican War there were about g,ooo students enrolled. Nearly 1,300 were in the Law Departtnent, 857 in the School of Medicine, and over 5,ooo in the pre- paratory department. Owing to the unsettled condition of affairs there are but 300 students this year.

8 THE OONOOBDIENSIS. Y. M. C. A. PRESIDENTS' CO,NFEQENCE. On April 3-6 Union College is to act as host to seventy-five men representing the eastern colleges. The college has been honored by the acceptance of her invitation to the International co1nmittee to hold this conference in Silliman Hall, and takes a just pride in so exercising tl1e function of host that the conference tnay enjoy a pleasant and profitable session. The enter- tainment of the delegates will be provided for in the homes of the college fraternities and in homes throughout the city which are to be opened through the cooperation of the pastors of the city churches. The men who are to meet in conference are the newly elected presidents and graduate secre- taries of the Y. M. C. A.'s who seek by con- ference and discussion to prepare themselves for · their administration during the coming year. Nearly every college, including technical and military schools, and the large preparatory school~ of New England, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland will be repre- sented. This makes the conference one of the most important in connection with the college work. The purpose of this conference is to give the newly-elected presidents of student associations a broader and clearer view of the place, scope and principles of the association ; to give them the advantage of the experience of other asso- ciations in meeting problems of work ; to show them the work and relationship of the office to which they have been elected ; and through. personal fellovvship and through united waiting on God to give the inspiration and the convic- tions whi-ch are essential to sustained and effective leadership of the association. Papers and discussions will be the chief features of the conference. These will be under the direction of the secretaries of the Student Department of the International Committee aided by the secre- taries. of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions, and by leaders ilil state, city and local student work. The first session will be held in Silliman Hall, Thursday:evening, April 3, at 7 :30 o'clock and the last session will be Sunday night, April 6. During these days Uni~on is to be brought into active fraternal relationship with .all the colleges and universities of the east which Decessitates the cooperation of all the men of coUege in extending to them the cordial l1ospitality of Old Union.

North, of New York city on \'The Monroe Doctrine.\ The author shows that Canning's , claims as the real author of the Monroe Doctrine are entirely without foundation; giving extracts from official correspondence from the time to substantiate his statements. In concluding, the writer says: \The claim made by Canning that he had called into existence a new world to re- dress the balance- of the old, in view of the dates at which the independence oft he Spanish-Ameri- can colonies was secured, and acknowledged by us and by England, seems absolutely without other than an imaginary foundation. The claim that he originated the ~1onroe Doctrine has this distant relation to the truth : Canning wanted a joint declaration near enough to the Monroe Doctrine to keep France from getting something England might wish.''

'I like your way,' l1e said to the presiding officer, 'and I sometimes wish that I were not tied down by the conventionalities of the Presbyterians. I som,etirnes know that I could preach a much oetter sermon if I weren't.' When the presid- ing officer arose to introduce him, he told the audience what the noted Presbyterian had just said. Then turning to the guest, he added, 'And you are not on a Presbyterian platform now, but a Methodist. Go ahead and preach d ' \ . as goo a sermon as you can. '88.-A. J.

It is certainly incumbent upon the 1nanagement of the college team to use every possible endeavor to arrange for such a meet. Here is an opportunity which cannot be allowed to pass. Close of the Shakespeare Lectures. The course of lectures before the Shakespeare ·Club closed with Prof. Bennett's lecture on ''Shylock'' on March 11. The student body owes a good deal to the president of the club for his indefatigable zeal in securing the excellent course of lectures that he succeeded in doing. That they were not appreciated was evi- dent from the comparatively small attendance of undergraduates. They were unconsciously the losers. In all :five lectures were delivered, as follows : Prof. Ashmore, ''Hamlet;'' Prof, March, ''The Spirit of Shakespeare;'' Prof. Hale, '' The Theatrical Conditions of Shakespeare's Day.'' Prof. Marvin, of the Union Classical Institute, ''A Base Lie ; '' and Prof. Bennett, ''Shylock.'' 1902's Contribution to Sociology. The present Senior class follow- ing the excellent examples set them by the four preceding class- es has made a donation of thirty books on Sociology to the college 1i brary. This splendid system of increasing the sociological books in the library was begun by the class of '98 at the suggestion and under the direction of Dr. F. R. Jones, of the History and Sociological department. Through this system Inter-department Meet. The correspondent from the Union college now 'possess a sociological library Medical has suggested a that is the equal of that in any institution of the matter which, if carried out, would be of the greatest importance in bringing the different departments of the University into closer union and also the means of securing a bet- ter 'varsity track team. This is the question of holding an inter-department track meet. Such a· meet can be easily arranged to take place before the Albany departments close in Ma::y. The students from those departments of the university seem to be in favor of holding it and are manifesting a same size in the country and even larger than many institutions that count their students by the thousand. These books have been carefully se- . lected by Dr. Jones in every instance, who has always used his best judgment in purchasing them. The college is certainly greatly indebted to him for originating this system and introducing it here and likewise to the classes who have fol- lowed it. This is a custom that it would be well to keep up.

' •f: I i 'i ' ! 12 THE CONOORDIENSIS. THE MEDICAL. BOOKS ON SO.CIOLOGY ADDED Herbert Bowen Reese, 1905, has lately been initiated into N. E. N. Dr. Howard Van Rensselaer left last week for Paln1 Beach, Florida, for a two weeks' sojourn at that resort. J. W. vVbite, 1905, was one of the University's representatives at the Convention of the College Y. M. C. A., held at '\I'oronto two weeki ago. He reported a good time and an enthusiastic re- ception in the Canadian city for all the delegates present. Occasionally the round ot \hornd grind\ is relieved for the poor tnedics by \free shows.\ The other day the Freshmen in Anatomy class were treated to an exhibition by a contortionist and double-jointed man. The abnormal con- dition of his bones and ligatnents was a source of great interest to the Freshies. Later, an analgesic man appeared before the students at one of the Saturday clinics at the Albamy Hospital. He chewed the heads off matches, stuck pins into his body, or walked around with boards nailed to his feet, all with equal readiness. Much intrest has been 1nanifested in the proposition to have an \ inter-department ''meet. The Medical College contains some good material and if these tnen who are athletically inclined can be induced to get out and work, providing of course, they can find titne to train, the Albany men ought to make a very good showing. There are a couple of men who are good in the weights, as well as some fast fellows in the sprints. If a n1eet can be arranged, to take place before the men leave in May .. the ''Medic'} will doubtless be well represented. The correspondent cannot speak for the Law School, but judging from the rumors afloat, it will not be far behind in any efforts to render such a meeting successful as a University affair. BY 1902.
