8 TI-IE CONCORDIENSIS THE PRINCETON HONO:R SYSTEM. The cmnmtttee on the honor systen1 is made up uf the presi'den t of each Princtton undergracluate class an.cl two a.dditional upperclassn1en. Its worll.- tngs are .secret. At a general meeting two weeks hefore the rnid-years, the student committee i.ncl.Il- cate the principles of the sy.ste1n to the mem- bers of the Freshmen Class. Thus the Freshman is brought into ilnmediate contact with a hard and fast pro·position backed by student sentiment. The proposition is \you must not cheat.\ At the opening of an examination the papers are distributed. the professor only remaining ie. the hall long' enough to interpret any necessary ques- tions. As the student finishes the paper he signs the pledge, \I pledge 1ny honor as a gentleman that I have neither given or received assistance.'; During a. long examination it is not uncommon to see a group of st1:1dents in fro~t of an examination hall talking and snwldng, but not one word is said about the examination. When they have rested they return to their work. It is considered a breach of the syste1n to see cheating and to fail to report it. School boy seruple.s of telling on another are done away with before the larger propo-sition of guaran~eeing an examination. In the case of a man's being detected cheating, the proceedings are as follows: The case is pre- sented tD the cmnmittee and tl1e findings of the committee are transmitted tD the Dean of the College. lf the verdict is guilty, the man is al- lowed twenty-four hours to withdraw voluntarily or to a}Jpeal to the faculty. In the absence of either, expulsion follows. No one but the committee, the \Yitnesses and ·Lhe accl1S€d are present at the hearing, and the strictest 1neasures are observed to l<eep the charges of cheating from transpiring·. In the ab- sence of an appeal the Dean withholds the name of the stl1dent from the faculty. ln the p.ast four years there has been no al)!)eal. The classmates of the student who leaves are none the wiser, if he leaves .quiet1;:. He is thns r;ive11 another chance t) begin li ·ye over and he bas back of him the wholesome lesson that only strict honesty can succeed.-Bowdoin Orient. ____ ___,_ __ _ Taylor Hall, the now dormitory of Lehigh Uni- versity, \Yas forn1ally opened last week by the donor, Andrew Carnegie. INTERCOLLEGIATE. The Syr.a:cuse Urriver..sity Glee and Instruinental Clubs gave a concert in the First Methodiat Ch1uch, Sc'henectady, Friday evening, April 24. Two students of Sheffield Scientific Sc:1o01 ~Jf Yale University have been suspended for the re- ntainder of the year for ::;:fwoting needles fasten Pel to n1atches into a horse going along a street where seVeTal student bo.arding house.s are located. :P:esident Eliot of H.arvard c.ontinues' the anti- sport war in his a~1nual report by calling footbail \tl1e least u.seful of all the gan1es, because a sn1aller proportional nun1beT of students is fit for that sp.·ort than for any other.\ In speaking cf basketball, base ball and hockey, as well as football, 1J:e says:. \The strong tendency of the 'highly com_petitive violent ga.mE-s is to reduce the proportion of young n1en who pray t1len1 and to in1pede the univer.s.al developm:ent of -vvhole- some sports accessible to all. The fierce compe- tition n1akes these gan1es so intense that they are Hnsuita ble for any but a sn1all proportion of the students. Football toughness is not the kind of toughn.ess which is n1ost profita hle in after life.\ In n1odern life President Eliot says n1en do not need t'he \insensitiveness required on the foot· ball line,\ but 1nan \n1.ust 1nake his living by q1lick, accurate and inventive thinking.\ There are fifty-seven n1en on the base ball squad at Cornell. The financial secretary of Syr~cuse is raising $100,000 for the in1pTovement of the can1pus. A course in preparation for journalisn1 has been established at the University of Illinois in order to afford the pro:spective newspaper man an opportunity to acquire a general education, while pern1itting hin1 at the san1e tin1e to specialize along some line ·fielpful in 'his work. For the sixth time in as 1nany consecutive years Michigan won the four-n1ile chan1pionship relay 1·ace as well as the two-n1ile c11ampionship race, which were held at the University of PAnnsyl- vania's tr.ack April 25th.

UNION COLLfGE t THE CONCO·RDIENSIS 9 -- UNION'S EARLY ALUMNI. 'The Founder of Jackson's Gardens .. llrdlu Wl1hrdlu wnharly shrdluny shrdlun& hnmnh Arno.ng old Uni-on's past professors :l)robably no~re is n1ore gratefully re~en1bered by the stu- dents of to-day th.an Prof. Isaac \f\T. Jackson,. for it wa:s his personal effoTts, inspired by love for his .Al·ma l\1ater, that converted an tmcuJtivate<l part of the college grounds into a vale Inxuria1.1t with the beauties of nature. Even i~1 boyhood Dr. Jackson manifest€d. such a~1 uausually .strong de.sire for knowredg.e that wl1e:a S<eventeen years of age he was seat to Al- ba~lY .A:caden1y. After completing hi.s studies at the Academy with the 'highest honors ill classics and nnthem.atics, he ·entered Union College in the class of 1826. While in college he n_xade ex- cellent progTeBs and w·on his way into the :1.earts of his classn1ates by his syn1p::tthetic n.ature al1U gentle 1na~1ners. He attained hig'h standing h1 the classlcs aad graduated in his twent~y-second year with the first ho:..1ors L1 mathern.atics and chemistry. llnn1ediately after his graduation :1.e waJ appointed tutor in the college atHl in 1831 he was promoted ta the professorship of lnathe- matics. He wrote several text-books ·on 'higheT mathe·maties which were adopted in 1nany An1eri- can colleges, although they were designed only for tl~e aid of his students 0 .:.1 taking up his residence on the co 1lege cam- puB he found a few beds of p·oorly cultiva.ted flow- er.s and . vegetables and adjoining then1 a rude, tangled vale. When he died he left this san1e un- lH0111ising spot well ordered, widelv extended and filled with select IJlants aad flowers, the long shady rambles and sunny glades of which have become one of the most attr':lctive possessions of the college. As these gaTden3, which were com- n1ittsd to his care were improved and extend~·cl durb g a long period by 'bis own hand, be learned with deep pleasure in the last year of hJs life that a fund had been projected for continuing llis work. Certainly he could never have received. a 1nore approp·riate tribute to his memory. His life was centered in and was mainly bouncl by his ·college associations. It was passed in his family circle, ·llis studv his e·ardens with the v ' '-' ~ students or wit'h members ·of the faculty. He was very modest and while he had great UteTary pow- ers, he could not be prevailed upon to exercise them for the sake of a reputation. As an executive officer of the college he was pTmnpt, energ;etic, watchful and active, selecting his tneasureB careftH1y and carrying the1n out with discretion. Althoug:h in his earlier days 'he had rather harsh and severe conceptions of discipline, they were soon so:fte:ned by the influence of hi..:• beloved president, Dr. Nott, \vhon1 he loved and assisted most faithfully. At the clo:3e of the Civil \Var, althoug·h the country in the NoTfh was pros}Jerous, it was felt that Union College was in a critical condition, :ts she was steadily decliaing tn prestige, influence, and nun1.ber of students. Dr. Jackson was an1ong the first to comprell:end the situation. He sent forth earnest appeals to the graduates to organ1ze local Alumni Associations, and wrote with his own hand 'hu~1dred.s of letters in order to a'fouse in- terest in the college and to increase the nun1ber of students. It was i~1 the bright s.unli.g11t of a sunny after- noon in the garden, which by his care had jnst reached its mo..st pe-rfect condition, aRd under the great elm which 'he loved, that his friends gath- ered round the body of the noble professor for funeral rites befittin?; the departed one. Accord- ing to his ow~1 desi1es without ostentatious dis- play, his bier carrie-d by college work1nen and sur- rounded by his lifelong aad loved assoeiateB, he was laid to rest in a grave covered with flowers of his own raising. ---------- It is nearly two years E ~nee \Old North Cell e ge\ at Wesleyan was burned. The old building has been re·plac·ed by a structure m()dern in every way. it pre.sents a very fine appearance and is as proof against fire as it is possible for a building to be. There are accommodaticns for about one ht1:1- dred men. The University of Illinois is to have two new buildings. One is a physics laboratory, to cost $250,000, the other an extension of the natural his- tory building·, to cost $150,0CO. Wesleyan University cannot rEceive any benefit from the Carnegie fund, because of the fact that the managers of the fund consider it to be a sec- tarian college.

THE' CONCORDIENSIS II . Last Sunday at Vesper service Mr. Downs, sec- retary of the city Y. M. C .. A., addressed the meet- ing .. He took as his subject, \The Christian Asso- ciation Work as a Life Work,\ and gave a verr interesting talk, showing what a broad fie}d there is in this line of work for the young me1~ who de- sire to follow a Christian calling. AltAough. his talk was necessarily short, yet it w:a...s very in- structcive to all present. At next Sunday's service Mr. Miria1n, a promi- nent business man in the city, will address the meeting. His subject will be \A Business Profes- sion as a Life Work,'' and will be well worth the· three-quarters of an hour which it will tak-e up. On Friday evening of this week Mr. Billings, who was the delegate fro·n~ Canada to the Inter- national Federation of Christian Assoeiations to Tokio, Japan, and who is traveling secretary for the Dominion of Canada, will be nere and speak on Northfield. On Friday evening, May 22nd, plans are being made to hold a social at Silliman Holl. It will be held directly after the campus meeting,. and it is hoped that there will be a good crowd of the fellows out. There will be a speaker who will give a talk interesting to all, and there will be music to help make a general good time. Re- freshments. will also be served. Many men do not know what the Northfielc1 Conference is lil\.e, bnt they may be a.ssured that it is worth attending. The association. hopes to send this year a del-egation or about 15 nen. Th2 conference is fro1n June 26 to July 5,. at North- field, Mass., one of the prettiest places in that State. There is always an air of general good fellowship there, which is helped along by all kind.s nf athletic sp-orts, to which every afternoon is given up. There is always a tennis tournament and a baseball tourna1nent. Last year Union had several goDd men in the tennis tournament and won several games in the ba.se 1lall tourna- ment. Keep this in mind and soon there will be a call for those who desire to go. Further particG nlars may be obtained from Faust, '09, or Cavert '1 0. ' The Tuesday evening meetings of the associa- tion were closed for this term with the address by R.ev. W. A. Adams, Union, '02. 'l,hey will start in the faH with the opening -of the college term . ---· -· ----- INTERCOLLEGIATE. The student body at Wesleyan voted 118 to 67 i11 favor of letting Vars.ity baseball men play sum- mer ball f-or remuneration. N. Y. Freshmen have the election of attending £laUy prayers or writing a semi-monthly theme on scHne' religious or moral question. Willia1ns, Brown, Amherst and many other smaller .colleges have indorsed summer ba.seba 11 playing as a means of pecuniary aid. The p1:aRs for the new ·Chi Psi house at Corne 11 have been accepted by the University Build:ng Committee .. The work will be com1nenced next Jnonth anel will he finished in a year.

~- 12 THE CONCORDIENSIS . . . ·- ~tl)lttit£' It sesrrs as though the element2 were displeasen. Nith us, for rain has either broken up or inter- fered with Ue past three games, and games of im- pel tanee insomuch as tney are league games. The Varsity is in excellent condition and would no doubt have made an sxcellent showing in each game. We have one game on the can1.pus this weel\:, t1:at with Roc:!.ester, Wednesday afternoon. Next Friday and Saturday the -varsity will cross bats with Hamilton and Hobart on tl1eir home grounds. With the rever£es that the w2ather cond-itions have caused might come a loss of interest by the players. Now it is up to every fellow on the Hill to get out at pract:i ce each night and not only bet- ter l1is cheering in preparation for the Rochester game, but also to help. rouse the team from the rainy-weather lethargy. The league pennant must be ours if we only can keep the team in the conditi·on they wsre in at Rutgers. FRESHMAN BASEBALL~ The Freshman tea1n defeated the Watervliet High School at Watervliet last Friday by the score of 7-6. Despite the fact that the diamond, at best scarcely more tl~an a rough and hilly field, was in a poor condition, the errors were remarkably few. For 1911, Riggs pitched a very good game, fanning fully a dozen men and allowing but a few scattered hits, wl1ile only good fielding by the Watervliet men saved them from a crushing de- feat. The featl1res of the game were Weaver's batting and the home run made by Duchscherer. Following is the 1911 line-up: Bray, catcher; Riggs, pitcl: er; 0 ~c-onn ell, first base; Duchscrerer, second base; lVIackey, third base; Weaver, short- stop; Clowe, rignt field; Wallace, center field; Canfield, left field. H·AiMI L TON'S VIEWP'Ol NT. On next Friday occurs the Union game on the Campus. Union is, next to Colgate, our ke·enest rival and expects to re.trieve for her defeats in basketball and football. Colgate defeated Union 3-2, and Hobart 1·0, so that if comparative .scores are indicative, we will have our hands full. The batting orders follow: Hamilton-Judson, ss.; Clark, 2b.

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS . - ---- --- - --· - 1908 CLASS SONG. The 1908 clas.s song has been accepted by the class and .seems to meet \vith general approval. l t is of somewhat different character than that fol- lowect by the class song writers in recent years, being bright and lac!\.ing the dirge-like style of compositions of tllis nature. The mu.sic was writ- ten especially for the song and is well .adaptecl for it. 'The song as here printed is the resuit of ' the joint efforts of Kline, '08, and Weyrauch, '·08. Alexander D. Kline, '08. I All hail to thee, dear Alma l\1ater We will cheer for aye, Each day will bring us ever nearer, To the parting way. Btill as we linger near thy terrace, The scene of many a fray, We'll glance once 1nore, then Union cheer, Forever and for aye. Chorus. Rah-Rah-Rah- Rouse the echoes, let them peal, O'er ev'ry land and sea. The myriad voice.s may they answe~ Till eternity. Dear Alma Mater, may thy loyal sons, E'er raise this song to thee. And. wake the echoes with the paean Union and victory. II. As verdant freshmen when we e11tered, We numbered a hundred men. But many a trial and tribulation, Have thinned our ranks since then. Old Nineteen Eight, always victorio11s, In battle knows no fear. So what care we, we've won our ''dips,\ Now raise a rousing cheer. III. Tho years 1nay pass and fortunes alter, We'll still be true to thee. And as sweet memories grow older Still more, we'll honor thee. Tho fewer answers to the ro1l call We'll still renew our youth. And when we n1eet on Alumni Day, We'll shout, RAH-Nineteen Eight. TIFFANY & co. Fifth Avenue and 37th St., New York Blue Book. The· Tiffany & Co.

When e.omplete with its shield, which protects it and its operator from batted balls, the 1nachine greatly resembles a masked battery. ·The ·baseballs are fed into the gun at the breech and are expelled by compressed air, so regulated by a lever that swift or slow balls can bs thrown at the pleasure of the operator. The most inter- esting and at the .~ame time the most striking feature of this basebali \gun\ is the device· which enables any kind of a curve to be thrown. The ball, while in the barrel, rests between two wl1eels. These wheels are ·operatecl by strings a.nd com-municate the twist to the ball which produces the desired curve. By pulling -one string the wh-eels are made to revo1ve in one direction and by a pull on the other the opposite direction is the rESult J.Jroduced. In this way an in or an out curve can be thrown.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 17 that the wheels are above and below the 1 ball a drop or upshoot can be similarly thrown. The direction of the baH is adjusted by a ldnd of pivot, on which the barrel is mounted, and on which the muzzl·e can. be elevated, depressed or deflected to one f;3i:de or the other, as ts required. There i.s, however, one. difficulty in batting the balls thrown by this ma:chine, as there is, of course, no winding up motion before throwing the ball on the part of the \gun as is the case with the htunan pitcher. The first the batsman sees after tne sound of the escaping compressed air is the ball hurling toward him through the air, and until he becomes accustomed to it, this feature n1ake.s it puzzling to gauge the flight of the ball. If this new machine proves to be a success, as the trials held at Harvard indicated that it would, it will undoubtedly ibe adopted by all the colleges. -:Maroon Daily.

UNlON COLLEGE. UBHARY. THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, MAY 19, 1908 :t\,.T t\'iO. 26 RUTGERS-UNION DEBATE. The Garnet Wins from· rRutg e.rs. Last Tuesday, the thirteenth, the Union debat- ing team, consisting of La Crosse, '08; Weyrauch, '08; Mould, '09, and Davies, '08, alternate, with Professor McKean, left for Rutgers College, New Brunswick, N. J. On the next evening this team defeated Rutgers on her own floor in a close but decis·ively won debate. The question was: \Resolved That the further restriction of irnrn.igration (intD the United States) is undesirable.\ Rutgers, who had suomitted the question for our ap:proval, defended the affrmative, while Union had chosen the negative side. Both Union and Rutgers had made long and elaborate prepartions for the debate, as Rutgers knew that our team had decided to win. In opening the debate Tracey Voorhees, '11, the first Rutgers speaker, tried to lay the burden of proof up·on the negative. When he had finished, La Cro.sse, '08, arose and by skillful a.rgumen t showed that Un.ion had to bring forward but one specific case in w:O.ieh restriction of cl8.ss 0'1' kind was desirab1e to win t11e debate. La Crosse was greatly aided ia his argument by statistics and by examples whicl1 the team had procured while visiting· Ellis Is land that morning and witnessing the landing of a large C'rowd of emigrants from the German steamship Krownprinz Wilhelm. He proceeded to describe the undesirable class of emi- gra11ts from foreiga lands, criminals, paupers, mentally, moraUy and physieally defi.cient. He also described the bond system as a mere means· of getting around the law. The second Rutgers r'ebater, William H. Mac- Neil, '03; laid great stress upon the labor prob- lem, stating that tbis country needed just this class of persons to fill the menial positions in the land. His rea.sons for this need, however, were not conclusive enough and Mould, '09, Union's sec- ond speaker, succcessfully refuted this point by showing that the need for such laborers· was fic- titious, as broug·ht out by his opponent. The last Rutgers debater was F. Marmaduke Potter, '09, who is a Rhodes scholarship man. He tried to anticipate our next argument by declaring· that the .classes which immigrate to the United States could be :assimilated into the spirit of the country and nl·oulded into good citizens. Weyrauch, '08, however, Union's last debater, completely refuted this lJOint by bringing forward cases and ex~mples where as.silnilation had prov-ed a failure and Im- possibility. After the rebuttal the judges, Dr. James M. Green of Trenton, N. J., Prof. E. Y. Rohbins, Princeton, N. J., and Ho\vard Gilmore of Newarl{, N. J., retired to mal~e their decision, and after an hour's discussion the chairman announced amid rounds of applause that the judges had de- cided by a majority of two to one that the palln belonged to Union. This victory i.s one of the most satisfactory of the year, because it marks one more mile p·ost past and because Rutgers never osfore has been beaten on her own floor. Also this is the first time in the seven annual debates between Union and Rutgers that Union has won. The college owes a debt of great thanks to th.ose students who have worked so hard, and to Professor McKean for his efforts. These n1en un- selfiishly have worked for the college, seeing in the distance no gain for themselves and often sac- rificing· themselves for the glory of old Union. This debate marks the end of a perfect debat- ing season, with three victories----.Alban~ Law School, Hamilton and our vanquished rival, Rut- gers, as a nucleus for a r;oorl starter next year. UNION MAN TO WED. The engagem.efit has been announced of Miss Amelia F. Pease of Syracuse to the Rev. Irving W. Ketcham of Weedsport, N. Y., a graduate of Union College, a Phi Beta Kappa man and a n1en1- ber of the Phi Ga1n1na Delta fraternity. He is pas- tor of the Pres·byterian Church at Weedsport. The date nf the wedding has not been fixed.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS NOT'IC:E TO THE ALUMNI. To insure a large attendanee at Commencement, arrangements have been made with the T-runk Line Association and the New England Passenger Assoeia tion for a reduced fare to Schenectady and return from June 7th to lOth inclusive. The :fol- lowing rules nn1st be observed: 1-Tickets at full fare for the [;oing journey may he secured within three days prior to and during the first two days of the meeting. The advertised dates of the meeting are from June 7 to June 10, conseque:11tly you can obtain your ticket not earlier than June 4 and not later than June 8. Be sure that, when purchasing your ticket, you re- quest a certi:ficate. 2-Present yourself at tfie railroad station for ticket and certificate at least 30 minutes before departure of train. 3-·· Certificates are not kept at all stations. If you inquire at your station you will find out whether certificates and through tickets can be obtained to place of meeting. If not, agent will inform you at what station they can be obtained. You can purchase a local ticket thence, and there take up a certificate and through ticket. On your .arrival at the meeting, present your certificate to· Mr. F. A. Bailey at the treasurer's office. It has been arranged that a special agent of tne associations will be in attendance to validate cer- tificates on June 9th. A fee of twenty-five cents will he charged for each certificate validated. If you arrive at the meeting later than June 9th, after the special agent has left, you cannot get the benefit of the reduction on the home journey. No refund of fare will be made on account of failure to haves certificate validated. So as to prevent disappointment, it must be understood that the reduction on the return jour- ney is not guaranteed, but i.s contingent on an at- tendance of not less than 100 persons holding cer- tificates obtained from ticket agents at starting points, showing payment of full first-class fare of not less than 75 cents on going journey. The roads included in the reduction are: Baltimore & Ohio R.R., D., L.. & W. RR., N. Y. C. & H. R. RR., Phila.clelphia & Reading RR., Cen- tral RR. of N. J., Erie RR., West Shore RR., Le- high Valley RR., Pennsylvania RR., B. & A. RR., B. & M.. RR., Canadian Pacific RR., Oen tral Vt. R.R., Grand Trunk RR., Maine Central RR., N. Y., N.

Since the preparation and delivery of ora- tions has been required of all three upper classes, the advantag·es of oratorical training have heen brought to th.e attention of the students, result- ing in general improvement along these lines. Much good has been aceomplished. There .should be no ·halting in. the progress, however, until well adapted special courses are offered for Sophom·o.res, Juniors and Seniors, w~1o are especially interested in oratory. There have been many requests for such a course this year from members of all three classes and the Sopho- mores crystallized their sentiments in a :pet:tion whieh was presented to Pr·of.essor McKean. For those that have enthusiasm for the work, but are laboring under physical disadvantages, liberal op]_)ortunity should be given for thorough and continued training, with a view to overc·oming natural defects. For those that expect to make pubEc sp·eaking· their lifev1ork, such as candidates for the law or the ministry, courses calculated to lay deep and broad foundations for future plat- form work should he provided. The enthusiasm for oratory and debate which prevails at present should be nourished and sustained by prom·pt ac- tion on the part of the college to supply the need of larger and more extend·ed traini:J.g. Messrs. Pauley and Bis!and of the Power and Mining Department of the G. E. Works, delivered a very interesting and in.structi\Ve I.ecture to the Junior and Senior electricals last F'riday afternoon in the chapel. Lantern slides were used to illus- trate the models of the various types· of machines and m.otors and their power curved. l\ir. Pauley is an authority on induction motors, while l\1r. Bislancl has a thorough ln1owledge of .steam tur- bines. The Locom·otive Club defeated the F'reshman nine last Saturday by a score of 12-4. The game was played on the club's diar.aond.

THE CONCORDIENSIS II ANOTH EH VlCTO RY FOR G:A.R NET. :Ro•chester 5; Union ·6. Last Wednesday the campus s.aw another very exctting game of ball, that with Rochester. Al- though the game was very loosely ]))layed on both .sides, yet it' vras a very goo:::l game to witness. JudKing from the support given the tea.m from the bleachers the fellows enjoyed the game to the fullest. The 'varsity had expected. a brtter tean1 to p1ay against, but were happily disappointed in this, and easily won the game, having the advan- tage most of the time. Rochester had first bat, but made no runs until the second inning, when she passed tw-o men over - the plate. This start seemed to stir Union up a bit, ~nd in the last half of that inning and in the next two innings scored three run:s. In the fifth Rochester again made two .scores, thus gaining the lead again. The second tw() runs acted as a stimulus again, for in the sixth inning the varsity scored three runs in qutck succession, thus having a good safe margin of two scores. In the s·eventh inning Rochester gained one n1ore run, still being one score behind. When the varsity came to bat next, they found a new pitc1).er, and no more runs were made by either side, Union not taking· her last bat. l The sixth inning, w'hich turned out so well for the Garnet, did not lool\: very promising, for two men were put out quickly. Then Hildreth cam2 to hat and made a three-base hit, th 1.rs bringing in one run. There was some more goocl batting· that half and so two more runs were added. It was Chadwick's first game., but he played a fine game, ma.king three hits and one run. Ber- gan m·ade a pretty catch on a bunted hall. The playing was good, there being a few nncalled-f<~r ' . errors at critical 1noments. The score: Rochester. A.B. R. H. P.O. A. E.

Friday morning the varsity left for Clinton, quite positive that they would clean up with Ham- ilton, whieh ther did in a very nice way. It rained the greater part of the forenoon and a. little w'hile the men wer.e practicing. There was some sun, however, which made the field a little bet- ter, although it was .somewhat wet and muddy. The ball was wet and this prevented especially snappy plays. The occasional sprinlde during the game kept the field slippery. In spite of the wet field and baH, son1e very good playing was seen. Eamilton started the scoring in the first inning by bring.ing in two runs. When Union ·came to bat tn the second inning Hildreth was given a base on balls and then b.y some g-ood base running se·ven runs were quickly scored before the third out -was called. There was no more .scoring until the .s;lxth, when Hamilton made three and the Garnet one. In the next in- ning Hip made another bit and succeeded in scoring a run. This was the end of the scoring. Hip made three hits, two runs, stole four bases and made two catches at second, putting both men out at first, thus preventing two hits. Perry caught a long fly back of second, and by a long throw to fir.st put out th ~ runneT. The whole team played a good game. Dunn pitched a very good game. A fair-sized crowd wit.ne ss ed the game and the cheering by Hamilton was £OOd. The score: Hamilton. A.B. R. H. P.O. A. E.

S.treng·thened by the victory over Hamilton on Friday, the varsity went to Geneva on Saturday a11d ta.ok the laurels again in the g.atne with Ho- bart. When they arrived tliey found a team con- fident of victory, but it was a matter of good play- ing, not confidence, that counted. The field was rather heavy and a little muddy, hut not to .a great extent. The worst thing in .. connection with the whole game was the umpire, who did not seem to knOIV his business, and in- s-isted upon umpiring the ga1ne, base running and all, from back of the catcher.

THE CoNCORDIENSI'S VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, MAY 26, 1908 ~0. -27 El:GHTY MILES AN HOUR ON AN ELECTRIC LOCO MOTIVE. In tl1e eighty years of the developnH~nt of locon1otives for lung-distance transportation, only a dozen years or so have passed since the elec- tric Ioco1notive 11as been in the field. But four- teen years ago no such th·ing had been heard Df, and, wh i;le the steam locon1:Jtive of to-day is the result of three-quarters of a century of inven- tion and ilnproven1.ent, the prese11t perfection of the electric locon1otive has been reached after only a decade of experin1ental and researcn worl\, Fnr s ::me ·of us who are n1ore or less fan1iliar with thern the novelty has begun to \~ear off, but thEre are hundreds of engineers who wou: d place great valr:.e upon a trip on one of the1n. For those of my readers who are an1ong the less f:::rtunate, I will atten1pt to describe a trip on one of these \Mercuries of ti1e Rail.\ We board an Amsterdam car at Schenectady, N. Y., tl1e hon1e of the electric engine, ::'nd .go west through tbe Mohawk Valley. We have to ride but three n1.iles when -our car, running parallel to the N-ew York. Centra'l tracks, gets abrEast of the well-known and n1.uch-feared t:1ircl rail. Here we see one of those silent, n1ysterious bulks of iron, standing quietly with no puffing and blowing·, as in the case of the .stean1 eng\ine impatient to be off, but with a n1ajestic silence, te'lling us of vast power pent up within it and but temporarily subdued. Continuing up the valleY, we l()Ok out of the window, and are allowed but a few seconds to catch a glimpse nf the once still engine now de- vouring the tracl\: on which it runs at an en-orn1ous rate of speed, and _s8on 'be,colning; invisible in the d-istant pers·pective, .although we are running in the s·an1e direction of 50 1niles per hour. Soon. however, we arrive at Wyatt's crossing, the loca- tion -of the sub-station ,and barn. Here we await the return of the engine, and in the 1neantime wander about the station. H·igh up :::n t~1e side of t11e \Vall the 33,000-vo~t lines enter from the outsid·e .. and in1.media tely b€· lo\v are the curiously shaped lightning arresters and the long, sliln n1ain switches. Down on the floor are a set of transforn1e'l'S which 1'·2dl1C'2 the aLernating -curr21H of 33,000 volts to a much lower potEntial. Fr:n1 these the current runs to the rotary converter w~1ich, in ttun, gives off a c1ire~t current of but ·660 volts, v-rllich is applied to ~he third rail, p2ralleling the track outside. Br~.t the engine is a waiting :n s now, !1a ving been stopped -br one of e1e ernployes, so vve mu~t :i.1.urry a·board. First, ~he conduct:r n1ust take our pass so as to protect hin1sel,f in case anything should happen to us. He finds all is right and signa 1s to go ahead. The bell clangs forth a few strokes and the \engineEr who is a n1otonnan, slowly opEns h-is \thr:: ttl e.\ Slowly, s ~ead ily, and witl1 almost no sol;nd, we begin to move. The 1notor- n1an d·oe.s not hold his lever on the first notch, but quickly pulls it over the entire first se~, of wb ich there are thrEe, and tl1e n1ot:::rs continue to accelerate perfectly sn1oothly until near ~.he1r limit of sp'--:ed under that set, when he gives then1 .additional \juice.\ Starting frmn the eastern end, we have a s ~r-aight stretcl1 of three-quartErs of a mile, at ti1r end of -vvhich there are several sharp, double curves. Alo:1g i1ere the n1otorn1an is not allowed tJ excEe-d .a speed of 65 1niles .per hour for saf2ty's sake. This is rather fast traveling, afte1' never having gone faster than 60 1niles per hour, anr! we wonder at t:1e ease with wh-ich our s~Eed tal\es the curve, leaning far over to the tnsjde so that. when standing erect, with regard to tl1e floor, WP are ten degrees fron1 the pErpendicular. A~ the end of the curve she rights herself and s1owly leans in the opposite direction on going around th-e next curve. In this way we pass over tl1at part of the track containing several cunTes and a slight up grade. which ends about one n1ile west of the sub-statioll. Then we enter a straight stretch, ending. in a

Directly upon leaving tlle sharper curves the motorn1an gives his gearless machine (the axles of t11e .drivers, being the shafts of the 1notors around which are the arn1a~ures) the entire 660 volts, and we in1.n1edia tely experience an increase bu~ yesterday we would have declared as being ''fa~'\.:'.\ 0 · t b t 'd · · _1 _,t. ur s.aor . u rap1 · JOUrney 1s now ove\j and as the brakes are applied we come quietly to a standstill, tal~e a long breath .and try to rEalize what we have Experienced.

This continues until it reaches about 74 miles per hour, when it stril{es the curve, reels gently t:l one side and settles itself in ~hat posi~ tion. Tl1e n1otor1n·an pulls the chord of his great cmnpress.ed air whistle for four long, loud, pierc- ing blasts, grasps his current and break lovers, and we rush upon the little sub-s ~ation, which is situated at the far end of the curve and partially hidden by tre·es. We are now half way arounfl and n1Jving ~t a terrific speed when it suddenly appears in our very path. On, on it com.es, in- creasin.g in size un :il we finally clash upon it and just 1niss it, l)assing· barely to one side. '\Vhen directly abreast of it there is a deafening roar of tl1e whistle and we rucl1 past on the far sicle, and, looking back, we behold pedestrians at the cross- ing holding on t3 their hats and one another, while to then1 we rapidly grow S1naller in the As the college year draws to a close, n1any of us are thinking what we are going to do that will enable us to get tb:e best results· for ourselves and fJr others. For such a 1nan there is no place where suc~1 a result 1nay be obtained as at distance. We have now entere·d the two-1nile straight- away with no crossing·, change of grade cw curvG within that distance. For the whole six 1niles of the track there are n1ile, half ancl quarter-Ini1e IJosts with one, two and three black bands on thenl, respectffully. These we pass in quic1H!l' succession after leaving Wyatt's, and. when with- in a half-n1ile .of the place where the power must be shut off, a couple of G1e n1en tin1e our flight with stop ws.tches. Eleven and three-tenths sec- onds, is the verdic~. We know tllat this is for the whole of a quarter of a n1ile, and with it con1es the realization that we are covering dis- tance at the rate of 79.6· 1niles per hour. But now easily, we think. The objec~s outside have passed with incredible rapidity, but all thought of such speed would vanish ·when we would thinl~ of the very s1ight sway and the Entire absence of all f::;rwarcl lurc'hing. Northfield. The Northfield Studen~ Conference for 1908 will be held on tlle grounds of the Northfield Semi- nary, East No~rthfield, Mass. It is as pretty a place as one wo·uld care to visit. The open-ing session is on Friday evening, June 26, at 7:30 o'clock; the closing on Sunday night, July 5. The conference is truly an intercolle.giate affair, as is shown by the fact that in 1907, there were present 756 stlldents fron1 159 institutions in Ganada and the E:astern United S~ates. The life of the conference is truly wnolesome. Every afternoo'll, except Sunday, during the ten days, is given over to athletic sports of v:ariJns kinds. A series of baseball gaines t-or the col- lege championship, a tennis ~ournan1ent with 150 or n1ore entries. swinn11ing in the Connecticut, trmnping expeditions about the beautiful country, a track n1eet, and unique celebrati3n of the Four~h of July-these offer to every n1an so1ne forn1 of athletic enjoyment that will con~ tribute to t11e wholeson1e effects of the confer~ ence life. Real friendships are formed during the days. Men of con1mon interest in the fundamental things of life con1e together in a delightfully in- fornlal n1anner, and find in each other characteris- tics that n1ake strong and pern1anent fri~ndship. The enlarging of 1nen's circle of acquaintance, alone, 1n·akes the ten clays of value in the de- velopment of a ric1ler and 1nore enj0yable life. At the n1eetings are heard such men as Rev.

Y., delivered an esE.ay, and San1uel Pierson Brusb. of Troy, N. Y., delivered the valedictory. The subject of the valedictory address was \The History of Medi- cine,\ and a very excellent paper. He showec th8 additions :1f Inedieal lrnowledge from very ancient tin1es to the pres.en t, and also the results of tllis- lrnowledge. In his address to the class Dr. Alexander urged tb en1 to keep up the lligh standard t:1ey had had ·before thern as students and in that w.3.y they would uphold the go-od reputation whi·cD. the col- leg8 bas always enjoyed. He said that as they were t:1en gradua~ing their c~li2:f thing tJ do woula he to think, and tl1at in their line of work they had a s·plendid opportunity to advance -in 1norals.

First place went to Barney a~ 9 feet 11 inches, with Streibert second and Ches- ley, who plnckil~· vaultE.d over nine feet with a sprained ankle, won third. This gave W. P. I. six points to Union's three, thus maldng the score 60 to 57. In tlle high jump Huthsteiner not only won first place, but also broke the C:)Ile.ie record of 5 fe8t 7 1-4 inches n1ade by E. J. Dunn last year. Huths ~einer cleared the bar at 5 fee.t 8 2-5 inches. 'Travis also fulfilled the predictions that have- been made of l.1iln and broke the two-n1ile re.cord, lowering it seve'll seconds·. Go1·d, the noted W. P. I. n1an, in an atte1npt to keep pace witi1 him h2.ca1ne so exhaus~ed that he fell twice, but aris- ing pluckily finished second. Travis's time fJr the two-mile run was 10 minutes 38 seconds.

Dr. Tayler said that colle-ge men some time get the foo1ish idea that when a n1an gets in college be ought not to hav2 restraint thrust upon hinl as upon a child but sh.::;uld be left to take care of hin1self. T'his idea is entirely wrong for a man 1nust submit to every form of dis,dpline if D.e wishes to he a thoroughly equipped man. Dr. Tayler laid great stress upon old Union and her traditions and bade th·e~ men pres:ent to do all in their pJwer thr·ough their life .and influence to uphold the principles of their Alm·a Mater.

THE CoNcORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, MAY. 5, 1908 No. 24 THE OLD U. C. SENATE.. Probably there are bn t few n1en now in collPge wlro are aware of the fact that in onr student body there existed., many years ago, an organiza- tion called the U~1ion College Senate. 'This w.as, neverti1eless, the case. In October, 1839, there was held a Tneeting of the Senior Cl~u~s. those to graduate June, 1840, for the vurpose of organizing a body \by w'hich t11ey 1night beco1ne 111-ore efficient and useful in t11e discharge of their future duties,\ and to on- tain \facilities for in1proven1.ent in exten1porau- eou.::; speaking, and to become fan1iliar with those rules and usages, whic·il prevail in parlian1entary assen1blies.\ To this body was given the nan1-e Senate. The n1en1bers were, \as nearly as pos- sible, persons of the san1e pursnitB, and of equal acaden1ic rank, talent and attai:Jment.\ The sub- jects for discuss.ion en1braced aln1ost every ques- tion w'hich was of interest to the scholar, states- ma:l or general philanthropist. Its exercises were ca Tried on conten1poraneously with those of the recitation roon1 and tilus looseness of thought and la11guage'' was largely '-counteracted by frequent attention to written composition.\ The Senate n1.et every Saturday, except the first. of each collegiate term, at 9 o'clock a. m. The officers of the Senate were a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer and Librar- ian. The President was a 1ne1nber of the Faculty r~nd presided at all n1eetings and at t'he first Tegu- lar 1neeting after his election he had to deliver an address. It was the duty of the Vice-President to })reside during the absence of the President. Tbe President was elected annually and the other officers once a tern1. ~o person could be an attending n1en1ber un- less 11e was a n1en1be-r of the Senior Cla.ss, and ·only such were eligible to office or to vote. Grac't· nates were honorary 1nembers and n1en1bers of the Pacn 1ty \vere ex-officio 'honorary n1en1 bers. At the last regular meeting but one of the third term of the SenioT ~rear, the whole Junior Class was invited to becon1e i11em1Jers of the Senate. and at the next n1eeting those desiring to hcon1e men1bers were duly initiated. Twenty attending n1en1.bers cGnBtituted a quont:m. All n1en1bers were required to be pres- ent at every 1neeting and an absentee was fined \the sum of six and a quarter cents.\ Besides this, each n1e1nber paid into the treasury, in the second week of e.ach term, the snn1 of twenty-five cents. The questions that were di::;cnssed in the fonn of \Debates\ by the Senate were confined to Pc- l!tical Science, Political Econon1y, Ethics, Mental Philosophy and Literature. And the questions were de-cided by ct n1ajority oE the 1nen1be-rs present. There were seven classes an1ong· the nleinbers of the Sea ate, with reference to the iT residence: Those roon1ing in ~o·rth Hall and Xorth Section of ~orth Qollege, first cla·ss; those in ::.vli.ddle Ser· tion, second class; those in South Section, third class; those in ~·orth Section of South College, fourth class; those in :Middle Section, fifth clas~; those in South Section and South Hall, sixth class, and t'hose roon1ing in town, the seventh class. These residences were called districts, and in debate, a n1en1ber was refeTred to as the Gentlen1an or Senator frmn the first district, etc. There was b.eld an annual celebration of the Senate on the afternoon and evening of Con1- n1ence1nent Day. The n1en1bers 1net at 2 o'clock p. rn. \to exchange salutation, to consult concern- ing n1.easures calculated to peTpetuate the SenatP. and pron1ote its interests and to dine.\ evening· an address was deliveTed. by the w'ho was a graduate of Union College. In the ·orator ' As far as possible the 1neetings of the Senate were carried out like the n1eetin2·s of the U. S. Senate. The President had po\ver \to l)rHserve oTder and decorun1,\ and to \certify passage of all bills by the Senate.\ ~o men1ber could \speak to another or otherwise interrupt the busine~1s of the Senate, or read any matter irrelevant to the business of the Senate, while the journals or pub- lic papers were being read,\ noT could \a Senator

THE CONCORDIENSIS pass between a Senator speakin2.· and the chair.

Co., delivered a 1ect ure in the eha1)el on the practical apJ)1icatiOl1 of electricity, show- ing how it is used in all branches of manufac- turing. He used sonre lantern slides of diffe·rent 1nanufacturing plants in which electricity is used for that purpose. A..bout two weeks ago Chancellor J. R. Day of Syracuse Dniver;:;ity asked Dean Kent of the College of Applied Science to resign. The Senior Class of the engineering college drew up resolu- tions criticizing this act and on April 30th the Ci1ancellor notified the class that the rnembers were suspended until the resolutions were re- tracted, and that unless such action was taken, its 1nernbers would not be graduated. The class cut r€citations and \held a n1eettng.\ CHAPEL MEETING. Kline, '08, preBided. Captain Vogt spoke on the ?:an1e witi1 Colgate Saturd.:ty.

We starL d on a, rush for the scene of t11e calamity, but before we con ld reach the place the fire apparatus had arriv€d and had gotten as near .as they could, which was not ver:v near on account of the pri·meval forest surrounding the great, rnassiv·2 barn. F'or this, we found, was what was at the mercy of the fearful elen1ent fire. Soon ~-izz;l ing streams of water fiercely fong·ht the flames. But see ! 'the conquering hero co:nL s.' On rushes C. B.

On, on he comes ! But ah ! Are the horses still in the 1nidst of the flames ? Oh, no. Two valiant frosh, with con rag~ spurred on by df.S,}Jeration and undaunted by the fearful danger had at an early sta.ge of the fire rushed boldly into the glowing, fiery fur- nace and rescued the faitllfnl beasts.
