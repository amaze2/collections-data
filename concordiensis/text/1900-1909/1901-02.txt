Dr. Eliphalet Nott Potter, presi- dent oft he Cosmopolitan Uni-versity, and for thirteen years president of Union, died suddenly of heart failure, Wednesday, at Mexico city, where :he bad gone in search of renewed strength and health. The details of the death and the funeral arrangements have not yet arrived. Dr. Potter was born Septetnber 2oth, 1836, of a distinguished family. His father, the Rev. Alonz<> Potter, who married the only daughter of President Nott, was at that tin1e professor of Mathematics, Rhetoric and Natural Philosophy. Young Potter entered and graduated from Union with tbe class of '6r. The following fall he en- tered tne :Berkeley Divinity School, from which. he graduated in the spring. The Church ofthe Nativity in South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, al- most itnrnediately extended hitn a call to its pas- torate. Dr. Potter was connected with the church 1or seven years. During part of this time and for a while afterward, he was secre- tary and Professor of Ethics at Lehigh Univer- sity. He was also associate rector of St. Paul's church of Troy, N.Y. In 187r, ·he was elected President of Union college, and he immediately entered upon his duties in that capacity. In 1872, he was elec- ted a truste·e, which position he held until r886. He was instumental in forming the University in r87l, and became its first president. Under his adm-inistration new endowments were re- ceived, new buildings erected, and the number of students increased. Misunderstandings, how- ever, arose between the president and the facul- ty and the trustees, and he retired in 1884 to accept the presidency of Hobart college. At the san1e time Dr. Potter received the call ~to Hobart, he was tnade Bishop-Elect of Ne- braska. During his tenn of office at Hobart, he did much for the welfare of that college. When John Brisben Walker founded the Cos- !fnopolitan University in r897, he invited Dr. Potter to become its president. He accepted the invitation and did much to strengthen the Unhrersity. In r895, Dr. Potter delivered the commencement day address. Dr. Potter's family have been closely con- nected with the interests of the college. His father, the Rev. Alonzo Potter, Bishop of Pennsylvania for tnany years, was professor frotn r8r9 to 1845, honorary vice-president frotn r845 to t865 and trustee from 1847 to r863. Clarl{son N. Potter, '42, his brother, was trustee frotn r863 to 1882. Howard Potter, '46, another brother, was trustee from r882 to 1885. Edward Potter,' 53, a brother, is a distinguisbed American architect. Gen. Robert Potter, an- other brother, achieved distinction in the civil war. Bishop Henry C. Potter, of New York city, is also a brother. The only sister, Maria, married Launt Thomson, the fatnous architect. She now resides in Florence, Italy. Shortly after his inauguration, Dr. Potter tnarried a daughter of Mr. Joseph Fuller of Troy. c'MY LITTLE COLLEGE LASSIE.'' There has recently been published a new song wl1ich bids fair to becon1e popular and which, wl1ile not distinctly a Union college song, is yet one of which the inspiration catne from Old Union, and which bears a peculiar relation to this institution and its rnemories. \My Little College Lassie\ was written and com posed by · Elizabeth Hoyt Near, a daughter of Prof. Lock- wood Hoyt, '30, and a sister of the Rev. E. C. Hoyt, '79· Copies of the song may be obtained . at the music stores and are on sale at the Book : Exchange.

'I ! . 1 6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. NINETEENTH CENTU~Y ~OMANTICISM Dr. Hale's Address Before the Unity Club of Albany. Prof. Edward Everett Hale, Jr., lectured be ... fore the Unity club of Albany last Friday Even- ing on ''Romantic Ideals in the Nineteenth Century.\ Dr. Hale, in his opening remarks, said that he had selected three authors-Scott, Dickens and Stevenson-as representatives of romanticism at the begi ning, middle and end of the century. He said he was aware his se- lection of Dickens would be questioned, but asked his audience to suspend judgment for the time being. He said in part: \If we try to pick out one of Scott's novels as being typical of the great tnaster's romancer we shall probably think first of 'Ivanhoe.' It is perhaps the most widely known of the Wa- verleys. 'Ivanhoe' is undoubtedly in some re- spects a typical book for the historian of liter- ature. It shows us that fascination of the Mid- dle Ages that was so btrong a feature of the ro- mantic movement in Gennany, England and France. But, in spite of that, I do not take 'Ivanhoe' as typical of tl1e rotnance of the W a- verley series because, after all, these things were but the externals of romance. \Nor shall I take 'Waverly' itself ai a type. 'Waverly' is typical enough of some things un- doubtedly ; it shows us Scott's form in the Scot- tish character. 'Waverly,' 'Guy Mannering,' 'The Antiquary,' 'Rob Roy,' ~The Heart of Midlothian,' these are pre-en1inently the novels of Scottish life, all of the having the element of rotnance in them. T,hey are yet much stronger in their presentation of that feeling for Scottish life and character which is, in some minds, Scott's surest title to greatness. \But not to spend too long a time in telling you what I shall not do, let me say at once that the particular book I do pick out is 'The Bride of Lammermoor,' and this for several reasons. \It was felt at the time that this was the truest romance that had yet appeared among the W averleys. It came before several books which might have presented such an estimate. 'Blackwood's Magazine' said it was the only true romance of the set. 'The Edinburgh 1 said it was more romantic than the usual vein of its author. Then, next, it has but little to distract us from the romance, not chivalry of 'Ivanhoe' nor the charm in manner of 'Waverly.' \It is sitnply a tragic tale of human passion in scenes and drcumstances that heighten our imagination and allow full play to power and extravagance of etnotion. Two lovers bound by the deepest effection and kept apart by cir- cutnstances,-that subject is cotnparatively sim- ple. But Scott cast it all into a form that ap- peared romantic. It was founded on an old family legend. The time chosen was remote enough to be unfamiliar and strange. The scenery was of the wild and impressing Scotch seacoast. The manners vvere still those of a chivalric age. The incidents, too, were of a ron1antic character. With this setting, and with the romantic characters of Lucy and Hen- ry Ashton, and Edgar, the Master of Ravens· wood, we accuston1 ourselves easily to romantic incident, and that tone of half mysteriousness, half extravagance, which is one of the charac- tet·istics ·of romance. 'The Bride of Lam mer- moor' is the most romantic of the Waverleys, because it has, I believe, absolutely nothing to it of special note except its ro~ance. Scott wrote it in a serious state of ill-health. For a time he wrote himself, but most of the book was written to dictation, for he could not bear the pain of sitting at his desk. \This rotnance of sighing maid and gloomy lover is certainly empty and conventional. The romance of mediaevalism is a little better but not much, and if the romance of Hig-hlander and Jacobite is more real and soul stirring, it is because it was nearer to Scott-so near in fact, as to be almost a part of the life about him. \This ron1ance I call emp.ty and conventional, and I tnean by it that it does not come out of life. It is not created by that fine strong im- agination of Seott which dealt so nobly with the materials which life gave him in all those characters which he l~ad had half a chance, even, to study them and know. But Scott did not like to go far below the surface in these ' '. I l

' '. I l THE OONCORDIENSIS. 7 tragic matters. His nature was buoyant and exuberant. Life and character he knew and loved,-bu t it was generally in mo tnents of · buoyancy and exuberance .. ''At that time romance was something quite different frorri reality---It was quite unreal, in fact, something to be enjoyed in literature and kept out of life-If it had a·place in life it was only in the life of the young and foolish, and by them to be got rid of as soon as might be. And considering what the ron:1ance of Scott was, I do not know that he was very far wrong. Scott is always amusing, entertaining, .exhilarating, undoubtedly. But when one begins to think of Scott as something more-as Ruskin did-then one leave~ Scott's rotnance behind and turns to his testitnony anent the hutnan life in Scotland that he knew so well. ''Dickens made a step in advance when he said that he wished to present the Romance of Real Life. That ph1·ase is a good one, for it brings strongly to our mind how very unreal is the life of rotnance we read. Dickens saw that one did not need to go hundreds of years or hundreds of miles away to £nd romance. He saw it everywhere. But Dickens never actually did allow himself to see things exactly as they were,-or if he did, he never allowed himself to present a correct report of them. He always had his public in tnind: he always recollected his duty as a sto·ry teller. He was no scientist. It was by no n1eans his business to present life as it was. It was his business to tell stories. It happened that he could easily keep his stories fairly close to life, but he was convinced that the public would not stand having them too close, so he allowed himself any libet·ties that he liked. He happened to like the drama, so he took s~ch liberties as are suggested by the stage. The result is that though his romance pleased the public of his own day, it is most apt to weary the public of ours. Miss Havisham in her rotting wedding gown and one ~atin slip- per ; Lady Dedlock, statuesque and beautiful, i1.1 fear of the lawyer who knows her secret,- these figures are too remote from our interest. We cannot realize them and we easily forget them. ''By the time Ste-venson came on the stage, the literary conscience had been well aroused, chiefl'y by forty years of realis:m, it may be re- marked, which like n1any other arousers of con .. sdence had becotne pretty tiresome itself in the process. Peop[e wanted the real thing, hut they also wanted something more than 'the clink of teaspoons and the accents of the curate.' To use Stevenson's characterization of some novels of twenty years ago- ' They were ready for romance but they wanted something real too.' ''Stevenson coulan't bear realism. Imitation. he couldn't abide. But he too felt the necessity of truth. In fact, he said that realis1n on the whole, was a question of method,-and he didn't like the method. The point was, not to tell all you saw~ but to leave out nine-tenths and know which tenth to keep. ''So his romance was life, Real Life. Often enough it was ptue adventure, but here and there it emerged from the sea of wholly unim- portant but blood curdling and existing facts, and showed some of the truths oi the human spirit. The reason that it did so, so rarely, was in all probability, that Stevenson did not know much of life and tha:.t he did not often care to say what he did know. I don't think he had a sane or healthy rnind. Undoubtedly some of the perceptive powers were very developed, but the rational or reflective powers were pro- bably rather lacking:. It is probably not very remarkable that he did not hit the mark oftener than he did. ''What he did do however, and really there is a good daal of it, appears to me to reach pret- ty near the high-water mark of romance in one century. I say to 'reach pretty near' for para- doxically enough, I am inclined to think that the highest poi,nt in romance has not been reached by romancers, at least not by novelists. I should say that tbe poets of the middle of the century and the dramatists of to-day were the true exemplars of l~()mantic feeling in the nine- teenth century, not <>nly in England, but in all Europe.\ John E. Parker, ~oi, has returned to college.

. i I l l ' . I ! 8 THE CONOORDIENSIS. THE CUBAN :C·QN,SiilfTION. Frederick W. Seward ArguesAgainst Un- due Haste In Its Consicleration. The '':'Tribune\ prints a letter £t-om Frederick W. Seward, '49, t~elat1ve to the 'Cuban Consti- tution which is soon to be pre sen. ted to Con- gress. The ideas ,ex:pressed in it win be inter- esting to students of constitutioJITa[ government at Union. It follows in full: ''There is an old Spanish coupiDet still in vogue in Cuba, wll ic h says : 'Antes que te ,cases, Mire lo que haces. ' It is an iniunction that we might well bear in n1ind in dealing with the propose-d Cuban con- stitution. ''One would imagine fron1 th~ <>utgivings of correspondents ancl the press that tbe the consti- tution was coming toward us Jike an electric car, that we rnust Jtnn p on as so<:>n as it touches the crossing or be forever left he'lilind. We are told that it is due on February r:5, and that it tnust be :acted on at once, as thea~e will only be two weeks of the Congressional session remain- ing. Otherwise, t11at we shaH ba veto have an extra session of the new congt·ess, with its trouble a.nd expense. And that :if the new ~on­ gress does not speedily decide about it, there will be unrest in the United States and danger in Cuba, and so forth, and so forth. ''Cet·tainl y, it is desirable that the President anb Cabinet should examine it prornptly as well as carefuJl y. Certainly, it is desira.ble that Con- gress, the deliberative body, s;ha.ll discuss it thoroughly as well as without n.eedless delay. But there is another party to the b·usiness, whose opinions are wortl1 considering. That is the American people. It concerns tl-:1em now and hereafter, quite as tnuch as it de>es their tem- porary rept·esenta tives at Wash ington. They have not yet seen the constitliti.on, and have heard of it but irn:perfectly. Wl}.en it is pub- lished and they ha-ve read it, they will undoubt- edly discuss it temperately and decide about it wisely. For our Government is.t•o t now carried 9n merely by legis.lative or exec-utive announce- , ments from the capital. Thanks to our modern system of railways, telegraphs and newspapers, every great N\at problem is carefully scanned, studied and talked over, in reading rooms and clubs, in public conveyances and private homes,, in city gatherings and village postoffices throughout the length and breadth of the land. The n1ltuch lauded New-England town meeting was bat. the prototype of the gteat Na- tional town tneetiag that is going on every day, and whose de-d sions are looked for and respect- ed at Wash ingt·on. \There is nothing in our recent history more impressive tham the pause the Nation made be- fore the Spanish. war. Our Government did not begin that war of its own volition, but at the demand oftl1e American people. Even af- ter the appallin.g news of the de&truction of the Maine, the N:atiion paused to consider and rea- son out its line of action. It was a n1agnificent example of National self-control. When at last it reached the conclusion that the state of affairs in Cuba was :ilil. tolerable and tnust be ended even at the risk of war, it was with a judicial calm- ness that rem -in.ded one of those 'mills of the gods,\ which, tl1ough grinding slowly, yet grind exceeding small. \The Cuban. question has been a long time ripening towar<l its present stage. It cannot be ended by a~y sutntnary proceedings now. Doubtless the Convention in Cuba has madft a constitution resembling in many respects those of our own States. It will have, or ought to have, the sa11.1e guarantees of personal rights and liberties, tl1e same judicial safeguards, the ·same freedom of religious worship and popular action, and, presumably, similar machinery of republican g-overnment. But there are other points of vital importance. We should know what it provides in the way of restraint or lack of restraint on trade, industry, finance and pub- lic works, wh~t provisions it contains regarding foreign relatio1.1s and military forces. Above all, we should kt1ow and fully understand what its provisions are with regards to the relation between Cuba and the United States. Doubt- less its phnases will be friendly, and will con- template a co:ptinuance of n1utual friendship.

THE CON~CORDIENSIS. 9 Eut if it contains provisions looking~ ,directly or indirectly, toward a state of possible !hostility to the United States in the future, or of foreign alliances adverse to us, aU such provisions are inadn1issible and tnust be rejected. They would simply undo what was done by the Spani~sb war. \When w~e have the ~constitution before us, and not till then, we can <i:ecide what to do with it~ Whatever we do sih ould be done only after due deliberation, consideration and care.\ INDOOR ATHLETIC MEET.

The Concordiensis is very anxious to aid the work of making the first commencement exer- cises in the new century exceptionally attractive by reason of the large nutnber of alu1nni that shall attend the annual reunion. vVith this object in view, the paper has decided to carry out more fully the plan adopted and very suc- cessfully worked by last year's board. The plan is as follows: During the tnonth of May, the paper is to publish short individual histories of the graduates of these classes that will hold their reunions in June. A copy of the paper will be sent every living graduate of those classes together with· a cordial invitation to be present ~n Alutnni Day, June I r. The attet11pt tuet with much success last year and it is hoped, will tneet with more this com- tuencement. In order to tuake these individual histories of '6r tnen as complete as possible, a copy of this nun1ber is mailed to every living graduate of that class with the request that a short sketch of the career of each alutunus shall be sent to the paper as soon as convenient. 1'he following infonnation is especially desired. College fraternity, if any. Honorary or professional degrees. Posttions held in civil, political or military life. Books written, if any. Present business and address.

THE NEWS of the sudden death of Dr. Eliphalet Nott Potter, president of Union College from 1871 t<> 1884, and of Union University from 1873 to 1884, comes to us just as we are going to press. The sad news will be a bitter shock to many who knew him during his many years of service for the insti- tution. Dr. Potter was intimately connected with the college from his boyhood until his death- whether as student, president, or loyal alumnus. The Concordiensis will publish in the next issue a number of sketches of his fife and character by men who knew him from boyhood. ance runner, is now a member of the Continentals. Captain Wyatt was formerly the crack pole vaulter of the New England league. Other members of the team have gained similar distinction on the track. With good cheering to help them on, the men in Garnet have e:x:cellent chances. of winning tb.e meet. Show the team your appreciation of its work, and you will be aiding the work of making a good track team in the spring. THE support given the 190Z Garnet board by the undergraduates thus far has been very discourag- ing. The students do not seem to realize that the Garnet is their own book and, as such, is entitled to their earnest support. The reason for the late .appearance of last year's annual was no other than the same apathy which appears so decidedly this year. Everyone is famiiiar with the sort of contributions that are solicited by the board- short, catchy stories of college life, sketches and drawings suitable for headings or for humorous purposes, class-room jokes, calendar hits, grinds, etc. There are plenty of men in college fully capa- ble of aiding the work of making the Garnet an artistic and literary success, who nev~r lend th.e slightest assistance to this student enterprise. If the 1902 Garnet is to be a success, this assistance should be immediately forthcQming. LAST week's number of this paper contained an account of the idea which has been suggested at Washington to give college delegations a prominent place in the approaching inaugural parade and ceremonies. There are especial reasons why Union should be represented at that time, if the plans now under way are carried out. In the first place, William McKinley is a loyal alumnus of the law department of the university. In the second p1ace, Charles Emory Smith, a devoted son of Old Union, will ag-ain be in the Cabinet. Such an. opportut;tity for Union men to show their loyalty EVERY man in college should be at the armory next will not soon be offered ag-ain. A large delega- Thursday evening. The team will be in need of tion of Union men in the parade would show the hearty support, for its members have no novices to compete against. Fel thausen, the crack long dist- outside world that the university is still very wide- awake and alive to her opportunities.

THE CONCORDIENSIS,. 11 The expense coR:nected with sending any large representation would., of eourse, be high. Yet the difficulty would not be so hard to meet if enough men willing to pa.y part of their own expenses could be found. .S-ubscriptions enough to pay the railroad fare, of -th.ese men ought easily to be obtained as the railroads have agreed to give special rates to a1i1 s-uch delegations. One thing must be considered if the plan is to be executed and that is-it must be carried on strictly as an university affair. Delegations and subscrip- tions from the law must be in proportion to those from the college. \ASSOCIATION ::M::E\N\ for February, publishes a number of letters from men who have given mon- ey or erected buildiHgs for branches of the Young Men's Christian .Ass.ociation in different parts of the country. One leiter signed \H. B. S.,\ with characteristic modes-ty, tells why the author saw fit to give Union tbe handsome building that is fast nearing completion. The writer says: ''In answer to y()nr request for a statement of the reasons which in<luced me to erect the Young Men's Chriseian Association building at Union college, I think the strongest incentive was a sense of the importance of the establishment and development of Chris-tian principle among educated young men. This should be upon lines that should attract rather than repel, by showing that a pro- nounced Christian ~baracter and life is not alien from hearty good fellowship. Such, I am satisfied from observation and experience, has been the work of the Young Nen's Christian Association among college men~ and I am fully convinced that for its larger de-velopment there is necessary a first-class bui1di11g-, which shall be a center of whatever is enjoya1>1e and helpful in social as well as in religious life. That this has been the prac- tical result where ;Such buildings have been provi- ded is the concurrent testimony of those most di- rectly and deeply interested and best qualified to judge.'' It is sincerely hope.d by the faithful ones who have kept the Y. Iv.l. C. A. alive at Union, that Dr. Silliman will see U1e end of his desires fully ac- complished. And, indeed, it should be so. Al- though the c<>llege Y. M. C. A. has ever been a sincere and enthusiastic organization, it has some- how failed in its efforts to bring the great body of students to its meetings. Practical appreciation of its usefulness has really been wanting. No student has doubted the truth of the saying that '\a pronounced Christian character and life is not alien from hearty good fellowship, '' but few have been ready to seize this particular opportunity for its development. _With the opening of the new building, this apa- thetic atHtude should and will, undoubtedly, change. New life and vigor cannot help but ceme to the association with the better opportunity of- fered for the cultivation of manliness in character. Dr. Sillitnan 's work is for the best. If in .the future a more sincere and earnest set of men leave Union, his efforts will have been of much avail. COLLEGE CALENDA:R. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 8. 7 :oo P. H.-Bible Class at the Y. M. C.

The qt.1estion before the societies this year is : \Resolved That the latest Democratic Plat- fonn truly represents the principles of Jeffer- sonian Democracy.\ The negative side of this question was chosen by the Philomatheans and will be argued by Leopold Minkin, 190 r, Lester W. Bloch and Walter E. Hays, 1902. The speal<ers for the Adelphics will be Joseph H. Cletnents, jr., and ArthurS. Golden, 1901, and John A. Bolles, 1903. Dr. Rayn1ond will pre- side and the speakers will be introduced by the presidents of their respective societies, H. A. Barrett of the Philotnathean and John McNab of the Adelphic society. The question was announced at the opening of the term and both societies are working ·earnestly for success. Great interest is taken in the outcotne. The prizes, which were founded by Geo. F. Allison, '84, and Wallace T. Foote,'85, consist of $roo to the side presenting the best argument and $50 to the individual, regardless of side, who makes the best speech. The Adelphics were successful in 1899, Irving Ketchurn, '99, receiving the individual prize. Last year the Philo,matheans won, Stephen ·s. Read, 1900, receiving the individual award. p ' I~ ! ' /

The Concordiensis publishes below, several tributes to the men1ory of Dr. Eliphalet Nott Potter, by men w l1o knew him well and under- stood him. The details of Dr. Potters's life were published in last wee,k's ntunber. Writing at our request; Judge Landon con- tributes the following : His presence was itnpressive and gracious. His mind was enriched by varied study and reading and by contact in this and other lands with_ leaders in many fields of thought and en- terprise. He was fond of his family and friends and was always thoughtful of their happiness,_ and unselfish and generous in promoting it. His sympathies wet·e with what is noblest and ' best and with whatever tends in that direction. I He was especia1ly helpful to young men who were struggling- for education or improvement. Marty a man now prominent and ~Successful owes to him the stimu:lus which led him to undertake a collegiate course,. and to the help he afforded him in perservipg it. By his energy and en- thusiasm he enlisted many helpers in this work. He brought many students to Uuion during his .presidency of the college and enabled them to complete their studies. By the same means he greatly assisted the college in its financial needs. His ambition was to make the college a great institution of sound learning. His misfortune was that his methods were his own, and he could not per sue with patience or success those imposed by others. His heart was in his own methods of labor, and when he left Union College, he put aside the Bishopric of Nebraska, which was tendered hitn, t() carry on at Hobart the con- genial wot·k he had begun at l7nlon. His religion pervaded and sweetened his life. He was no bigot, and he welcomed with the liberality of his large nature the good that comes through other forn1s and creeds than his own. He was sometimes misunderstood, but this did not make hitn petulant or bitter. If he had en- emies he could forgive them. If he made tnis- takes or had faults, they were those of his ener- getic and generous nature, sometimes too confi- dent that other men were of like mould and thought with himself. Altogether he was a remarkable man, refined, liberal, cultured, noble, and above all, self-re- liant. He could lead, but could not easily fol- low. At last he leaves us, not having accomplished all he planned or wished, but leaves tnany lives the worthier because he had done so much. These lines are written while his grave is yet open. The friend who wrote tl1em, feels that it is not easy for him to pay a full tribute to the worth of the lamented dead. To the Edz\tor of the Concordienst\s. Dear Sir:- In reference to your request for a few words reminiscent of the late Dr. E. N. Pottet·, for- merly President of Union College, I desire to express my deep sense of loss, on hearing of his death. It was in 1873 that I first came to know him well. I was then connected with the Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Penn., where Dr. Pot- ter had many friends whotn he used to visit fre- quently, and with whom he had becotne intim- ate, while rector of the Church of the Nativity in South Bethlehem. Since the year above mentioned it has been my privilege to re- gard him as a friend, and I can bear testimony to his loyalty and generous disposition. I never asked a favor of him without meeting with a prompt and heartyresponse. In facthewasready

By the san1e means he greatly assisted the college in its financial needs. His an1bition was to tnake the college a great institution of sound learning. His misfortune was that his methods were his own, and he could not persue with patience or success those imposed by others. His heart was in his own methods of labor, and vvhen he left Union College, he put aside the Bishopric of Nebraska, which was tendered hitn, to carry on at Hobart the con- genial work he had begun at Unt\on. His religion pervaded and sweetened his life. He was no bigot, and he welcomed with the liberality of his large na true the good that comes through other fonns ancl creeds than his own. He was son1etimes tnisunderstood, but this did not n1ake hin1 petulant or bitte1·. If he had en- emies he could forgive them. If he tnade In is- takes or had faults, they were those of his ener- getic and generous nattn·e, so1n etitnes too confi- dent that other tnen were of like tnould and thought with himself. Altogether he was a. ren1arl{able tnan, refined, liberal, cultured, noble, anc.l above all, self-re- liant. He could lead, but could not easily fol- low. At last he leaves us, not having accomplished all he planned or wished, but leaves tnany lives the worthier because he had done so tnuch. These lines are written vvh ile his grave is yet open. The friend \vho wrote thetn, feels that it is not easy for hitn to pay a full tribute to the worth of the lamented de:ad. To the Edz.tor oJ the Co1zco1·diensis. Dear Sir:- In reference to your request for a few \Vords ren1iniscent of the late Dr. E. N. Potter, for- merly President of Union College, I desire to express n1y deep sense of loss, on hearing of his death. It was in 1873 that I flrst can1e to knovv him well. I was then connected -vvith the Lehigh University in Bethlehetn, Penn., vvhere Dr. Pot- ter had many friends wbotn he used to visit fre- quently, and with whotn he had becotne intin1- ate, while rector of the Church of the Nativity in South Beth lehetn. Since the year above mentioned it has been my privilege to re- gard hitn as a friend, an.d I can bear testin1ony to his loyalty and generous disposition. I never asked a favor of hitn without tneeting with a pron1 pt and hearty response. In fact he was ready

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. always to do what he could for others, .and the al- truism about which he would discourse-often in my hearing-was an active princ<i ple in his life. One of his intimate friends was the late Dr. Coppee, President, at one tin1e, of the Lehigh University, and a man who did much for the cause of education in his day. It was on Dr. Potter's invitation that Dr. Coppee made yearly visits in Schenectady, for three weeks at a thne, and delivered lectures on subjects connected with English literature, before the students of the college and the people of the city. These lectures were much appreciated, for Dr. Coppee was a specialist in English literature, and 1~t­ mous as an interpreter and a reade!r of Shake- speare .. It was my good fortune to see Dr. Potter frequently in his home on College lli ll, \vhere Mrs. Potter dispensed a liberal hospitality, to which faculty and students were welcomed. In those days he was a striking figure in Schenec- tady. His distinguished bearing, genial and kindly manner, and agreeable personality had rendered him popular with the people. Indeed many of the business men and merchants of the town felt personally aggrieved over his depar- ture from the city, while others thought that the college and all who were connected with it had suffered irretrievably, when he resigned the pre- sidency to accept a similar post elsewhere. Like all men in prominent position, Dr. Pot- ter had his enemies. It remains for those who loved him to recall his good qualities, and to note those traits in his character which not only rendered his life conspicuously useful, but endeared the man bimself to his family and to his friends. It is not necessary for me to speak of his work in the interest of education, of the benefactions that came to Union College in consequence of his ef- forts, or of the various positions of responsibility which he filled in the course of his career. I'hese are matters of record, to be known and read of all men. It is my part merely to pay this brief tribute to the memory of a friend, who was always good to those less fortunate than himself, and who had a word of encoura-ge· ment and of cheer for all. SIDNEY G. AsHMORE. To the Concordt\ensls: At the request of one of your number I het~e· with submit a few facts in the student life of Dr. I Eliphalet Nott Potter. The commencement of the year r8 58 was made memorable from the laying of the corner stone of the central building and the instituition of Alumni day. The exercises attending the fonner were replete with pathos and historic interest. '[':h_e trustees having performed the formal ceremony on the mound, adjourned to the chapel to receive the congratulations of Dr. Nott, whose infirrn health did not permit of his taking part in t11ern in the open field. It must be rernembeted t:hat to Dr. N ott, the erection of this building, Iang contemplated, was a crowning achievement. There were gathered in the senior seats tbe most illustrious of the alumni, men distinguisbed in state and nation, and others educated to laige sphetes of action, many of them bowed with age. Dr. Nott was ushered in, leaning on the .arrn of Moses. The whole house rose in hotnage or his presence. With a solemn dignity peculiar to him, the doctor raised his hand and invoked in trembling voice a blessing of rare beauty of expression upon the assemblage. I never witnessed a n1ore impressive scene, so marked in its individuality, so pregnant with the beneficent sanction of a life's work. 'rb:e fountain of human emotion was stirred to its uttermost by the eloquent utterances of ()ne, who had b~en a power in the land, who vvas honored and revered that day by men who ha.d felt in their lives the controlling impulse of that power. It was indeed aptly quoted that, \The soul's dark cottage, battered and decayed,. Lets in new light through chinks that time ll'as made.'' Under these auspices I first tnet Eliphalet Nott Potter. Our acquaintance grew and stleng-tb· ened into a life-long friendship.

THE CON'CORDIIDNSIS. 'T He entered college and becatne a tnember of his grandfather's family. In his youth he was tall and slender in person with a face of exceed- ing refinetnent and beauty of feature. It was said that he r~semb led his mother,, one of the most beautiful and accomplished women of her day. Potter had been cruising before the mast in the Pacific in a vain attempt to recruit his health, which was delicate and ,continued so throughout his college course. He soon joined the Kappa Alpha society, where his companionship was most genial and attractive, seasoned as it was with jocose re- marks and story of adventure by sea and land. I well recollect even at this early date his ready speech, his often playful as well as serious imagination. It was a strong characteristic of his to be constantly thoughtful of the comfort and pleasure of others. He was ceaseless in good offices of this kind and in consequence proved a generous and confiding friend. These attributes followed hitn through life and devel- oped in maturity to a degree seldom seen in one whose responsibilities ranged over a variety of onerous duties-and whose enjoyment of life was of the keenest. His magnanin1ity of heart was a surprise to his friends and at times seemed almost a fault. It led him to forget I think, the human side of character in opponents, and hence to under- value the violence of their opposition. Athletics were not prominent in our day. Dr. Nott rather frowned upon them from fear of accidents. So that our amusements were con- fined to the cultivation of the voice and ear, and to be truthful, a little \high low bluff and the game\ as the occasion prompted. Potter was gifted with musical talent and pos- sessed a fine voice in singing. Ours was an era when college glees were wont to be heard about the old town under windows of maidens fair on balmy summer evenings. He was not proof against the felicitations of these midnight re\Tels. Students rows were frequent, particu- larly with the townies. Of these Potter \\ ... as rather chary, probably as much from Dr. Nott's generous attention to such, as from a discretion enforced by ill health. However, the younger Eliphalet never failed to enjoy with a gusto; any significant details of student frolics, recited as they usually were with embellishtnents, highly flavored for the occasion. Having entered upon his college course at a late day, Potter was solicitous to get on, and out into the world of active duty. He was an atten- tive student and acq aired with great facility, absorbing knowledge readily from text book or other sources. Before I was aware of it, he was deep in Hebrew and prepared to enter the sen1inary at Middl~etown, Ct., where he con- tinued both college and seminary work. He returned here t<> graduate with the class of r86r. By this time his health was quite restored and under the tutelage of Bishop Williams, formerly of St. George's of this city, he came to the priesthood with ao inconsiderable vigor of mind and body. He filled the offices of clergy- man, college pro:fessor and president with great energy and devotion until failing health induced his retirement wi~th the solace which comes to those who have spent long years of usefulness to their fellow ·men. Dr. Potter's attachment to college hi,ll, the scene of his childhood and youth, and his desire to advance the material interest ofU nion College, were sentiments vital and profound and ren1ained with him uufalteringly to the end. · SAMUEL T. BENEDICT, '6o. GIFT FROM THE PHILIPPINES. Dr. Rayn1ond received an interesting Christ- nlas present this week from the Philippines. It was n package of hemp, said to be the best rais- ed in the Islands, from~ Captain H. H. Benham of the Second U. S.

l I I 8 THE' CONCORDIENSIS!. THE ENDOWMENT OF COLLEGES. Several of our contemporaries published last week a noble plea from the pen of Dr. Herrick Johnson, for the endowm~ent of the colleges now receiving help from our Boa·rd of Aid for Col- leges, as a fitting Twentieth 'Century offering. One of these colleges makes :a,a interesting plea for such help in this number of The Evangelist. President French is now in th.e _East seeking the needed endowment. We would remind our readers that every dollar they tnay contribute to this cause will be reckoned .as a part of the Twentieth Century Fund. We cannot more cogently endorse Dr. French's plea than by quoting son1e of Dr. J ohnson~s utterances: \The question repeats itse:1f: Where can a man of wealth do most for God and Truth in this first ot the next hundred years? ·~'We point to the American Christian College as a help to the solution of this problem of trust and responsibility. ''The College is America'~ peculiar institu- tion. There is nothing just tH{e it as an educa- tional agency on the face of tile globe. ''Think, now, what history they have made, these institutions planted at tl1e beginning of the nineteenth century. Think of the trained intel- lects and scholarly judgments and capacities for leadership that have been bor-n of them. Think of the men they have fitted fo1· farm and forum, for teaching and trade, for me<licine and law and ministry. We doubt if anotber agency can be named, outside the Church and the Home, that has entered so dominantly aad structurally into our national life. The $1 ,ooo or $ro,ooo or $5o,ooo put into those scho~ls of learning and discipline a hundred years ag() have proved first class investments every way. . Taken all in all, could the money tl•at went into these colleges have been put anywh.ere else to grsater advantage for God and Truth ? ''Well, what these colleges have done the last hundred years for the Eastern half of the Con- tinent, the infant Christian College& we are now planting and nourishing from the Mississippi Valley to the Pacific may d() for the Western 4~Jf of the Contiqent. The ba~e su~~estion of such a poss:i:})iHty lends sure support to the con- viction that here is 'the bottom thing' in the agencies that a.re to give permanency and high characteF t<>, our life as a Nation. Colleges grow. Colleges last. Colleges never come to their dotag-e. Kept Christian and brainy and ' open-eyed, tae possibilities of their transforming and upHfti!ng force are simply limitless. • . \To give these Western colleges efiici,ency ' and pertnanency ,, they must have endowment. 'Bricks wi1the>ut straw' are as impossible in intel- lectual as in material structure. Endowment means endt::wer:nent. And endowment under the St;lpexvision of our Presbyterian Board of College Aid ,means permanency of use for all time in the interests of an education that pays heed to our educated youth at the point of greatest pet-ill along the track of their intellectual developrnent. \Still ag-ain : At the base of all our wide evangelizatio:u and conquest, and indispensable to the vast ndssionary movements before our Church, is a living ministry. This ministry must be edacated. A godless education does not ~nake n~inisters. The Christian College is the training school for these servants of the Lord. \We bave here 'the bottom thing' in an agency for llelping Christ's Kingdotn come in this new ce11tuTy .\ Huron is i()ne of the colleges for which Dr. Johnson th11s vvarmly pleads. We trust that it will receive its endowment. It is only one of a long roll or colleges in vanous parts of our wide land which equally need support, and which if well supp<>rted will sut·ely do for our broad West what B()wdoin and Dartmouth, Williatns and Rutgers, Middlebury and Union, Washing- ton and Jeiferson and Amherst and Hamilton have done for tl~e East.- The ~vangelist. This will l>e the greatest college year that the United Staies or indeed any other country has ever known. The collegiate institutions, num- bering over fOO, have a combin~d attendance of nearly 200,()00. The rush for higher education has never been so strong or so general as it is today.

THE' CONOORDlENSIS. 9 BASEBA.:L;L SCHEDULE. Games With Qepresentative Nines A.rranged. Captain Parket· has returned to college and ac.five practice in tbe gym and base-ball cage will begin within a few days. It is probable that a good coach wi11 be secured to take charge of the team and fi·orn now on hard work may be expected. Manager Kline has been working hard on the schedule, and the result is that Union will play some of the best colleges in the vicinity. The schedule of ga.mes is as follows: April 22, West Poiat at West Point. April 27, Rochester at Schenentady. April 30, V errnont a:t Schenectady. May 11, Columbia at Schenectady. May 16, Middlebury at Middlebury, Vt. May 17, Vermont a.t :Burlington, Vt. May 18, Vermont a.t Burlington, Vt. May 21, Colgate at Schenectady. May 25, RocbesteT at Rochester. May 30, New York University at Schenectady, June 1, Colgate at Hamilton. June 6, Williams at Williamstown, Mass. In addition to these, two games have been ar- ranged with the Schenectady State League team for April 24 and May 6, respectively. This schedule has not yet been ratified by the athletic board but 'in all probability will be if the necessary am~unt is subscribed by the students. QUA.~'JET PLANS. The college quart~t, with the aid of Mr. H. J. McClure, will give a concert at the Baptist church of Burnt HiUs on Friday evening, March r. On Wednesday evening, March 6, they will sing at the Baptist church of Granville. During the early part of next term the mem- bers expect to give a concert at Plattsburgh. The average annual expenditure of the class of 1900 at Princeton f()r the past four years was over $7oo. THE UNDE:QG~ADUATE SMOKEQ. Best of Feeling Pervades the ~eception at the Press Club. The university stnoker last Friday evening, at the Albany Press Club, was a distinct success. The affair was unique in character, as i:t brought the undergraduates of the university together in a way they had never been brought before. Good fellowship reigned from the beginning un·· til the end of the evening. Men who had never before felt the true meaning of \'Union\ began to 1ook at it in a new light. Men who had never before heard a Union song, joined heart- ily ,in every one. Men who had never before heard the U niou yell, gave the \Rah-Rah-Rah U· n-i-o-n, IIika, Hika, Hika !\ with a wilL It \vas \an au~picious occasion,\as son1eone term- ed it, full of protnise for the closer union of the departtnent~. The afiair was entirely informal. All the privileges of a club member were exten- ded every man. It was this very infonnality that brought the men together and made then1 feel more at home than any nun1ber of banquets could have. The few speeches were of an in- formal nature. Pre~ident Dyer, of the Press ·Ch.tb, welcotned the students to the house. Re- presentatives from each departtnent made short speeches in which the importance of the gather- ing was emphasized. Dr. Arthur G. Root sang several songs, which were heartily encored, and Mr. Eugene Brumaghim of the Press Club, gave several pleasing recitations. Light refresh- ments were served during the evening and pipes, tobacco and cigarettes were distributed. The Press Club men were splendid hosts, and many thanks are due thetn for their hospitality. The college sent about fifty men to Albany. The Law School was represented by about twenty-five men, and the Medical College and College oi Pharmacy by twenty-five. Others present were: Dr. T. S. C. Van Allen, Dr. Ca stree, Dr. Haskell, Dr. Streeter, Dr. Rich- ardson, Dr. Root, Dr. Will, Dr. Cunningham, Dr. Griswold; Willis, 1900; Blessing, '96; Ed- wards, 1900; Hartnagle, '98; Herrick, Law, I900.

THE half-tone engraving of Dr. Potter enclosed with this issue, is from a photograph taken while he was president. THE Concordiensis publishes in this issue several tributes to th.e memory of Dr. Potter by men who knew him intimately. It is expected that Presi- dent Raymond and Major Austin A. Yates will contribute similar articles for next week's number. The editors f~el that in this way their appreciation of the large services of Dr. Potter for Union may be best shown. His steadfast devotion to his Alma Mater gives the students of today an example well worthy of copying. THE Concordiensis speaks for the University as it assures -the members of the Albany Press Club that tb.eir hospitality of last Friday e\ren-ing is deeply appreciated. The cordial manner in which the students were received speaks much for the friendly spirit of the club. Too many thanks cannot be given its members for the reception and the generous spirit in which it was offered. 'They have done much in aiding the work of hinding the departments together.

The most encouraging news of late is the announcement that George H. Witbeck, Union's crack twirler of last season, has re-entered the Law School, and will be with the nine again tl1is year. The teatn will be weakened by the loss of four of last year's men-Lawton, Edwards, Robinson and Groat. Yet it is hoped that enough new tnaterial will be discovered to more than fill the vacancies.

12 :THE CONOORDIENSIS. \COLLEGE Fl~A TEQN.ITIES .. \ An Interesting Article in the February Munsey's Magazine. The February number of ''Munsey's Maga- zine\ contains a fourteen-page, much-H,fustrated :article on ''College Fraterniti~s\ by Ennan J. Ridgway. In it the author points out the value of fraternity life, the origin and rise of coUege ft·atern.iti:es, the relation of fraternities to colleges and other points of interest. The article con- :tains nun1erous pictures of fraternity houses throughout the country. ''The idea is entertainecl in many quarters that tnen go to college to learn things out of books. If the college graduate depended upon .remembering the facts learned while at college for earning his daily bread, his diet would be likely to consist largely of free lunches and ozone. After five years' study of G1·eek, the writer re- n1.etnbers two words-entet.~-tlzen exelaunei-and those only because they occurred so frequently in Xenophon's 'Anabasis,' and it was grateful :to translate the phrase without referring to the lexicon. ''Men go to college to learn how to do things. The entering classes of all the colleges are larger each succeeding year, not because coli ege gt·adu- ates at·e regarded as magazines of information, but for the reason that college men are seen to be taking leading places in business and the ,professions. College life gives a man some- . thing he cannot get anywhere else. Not only does it train the n1ind, but it fashions the whole man. Brain cultivated at the expense of soul and body starts its owner into the big world top heavy. Associating with the other students, brushing up against every variety of tempera- ment and disposition, mingUng in all the activ- ities outside the class room-these are the things that stril\.e the balance and t·ound out the tnan. ''College life is full of fierce strife, keen anx- iety, and bitter disappointment, no matter in what form ambition seeks ex pression. If a man would excel in scholarship, he finds on the san1e bench with him the born scholar whose mind concentr~tes automatically--and assitnilates while he reads. To excel means to excel this man. The competition for the places of honor within the gift of the student body is keenly fought out. To match the fertile inventions, the subtle schemes, the brilliant coups, of college politics would tax the genius of an old cam- paigner. In athletics, one may be strong as an ox and wiry as a panther, and yet be as so much clay in the hands of a scientific opponent. \The man who takes his four years in college seriously has a contract on his hands that would dishearten him utterly if, at the beginning, he could see what was before him. A young n1an _ comes from his home into a life absolutely ne'Y to him. His parents tnay have taught him self reliance, or self distrust, o1· they may have taught him nothing in particular and sent hitn to col- lege to get rid of him.- The faculty cannot direct hitn except in a genera:l way. Here the fratern- ities find their place. The student's associates must look out for him, and it is to their credit that tl1ey do it well. Trust them to find out what sort of a fellow he is, and trust his fraternity to do all that human ajd ever can to make of hin1 the sort of fellow he ought to be. \Whenever men are thrown together, V\rhether in city or college, congenial spirits will seek out one another and form clubs, societies, or fratern- ities. The purposes of the diflerent organiza- tions may be as varied as human nature itself, but the underlying sp.irit is forever the same.\ CAMPUS NOTES. C. E. Parsons, '98, was in town Monday .

It consists of recent cases involving novel and practical points of law and practice which are extensively annota- ted by notes showing how the courts have pre- viously treated the questions involved in sitnilar and analogous cases. Volume seven is a hand- some volume of 6oo pages, and it takes but a glance to see that it contains rich stories of an- notation in connection with each case. It was issued in monthly parts during the past year and received with great favor by the legal pro- fessio n.-Rochester Union and Advertiser. '98.--H. E.

Senator Brackett and A-ssemblyman Mac- Millan Introduce a Bill Providing for Its Establishment. The representatives of Schenectady county introduced a bill in the state legislature last week which, if passed, will SOotnetime n1ake Union University the leading inst ituhon of the country 'in training young men for the great and growing 'industry <;>f electrical engineering.. The bill, as introduced, is the outcotn:e of much careful con- sideration. It provides for an imtnediate appro- priation of $r5o,ooo forth e erection and equip- :ment of an engineering school, and an annual appropriation of $zs,ooo for its maintenance. In return, the trustees are to deed all necessary land to the state and grant one hundred free scholarships in electrical engineering. The bill reads as follows: \Whereas The works of the General Elec- tric company, the largest in existence, tnakes the city of Schenectady in this State the natur- al centre for the study and developtnent of elec- trical science, and ,,. Whereas, Electrical science is entering n1ore largely each year into the industrial life of the State, thereby involving the interests of all the people and demanding intelligent legislation for the safe guarding of tl1ese interests and the protection of life and property, and H Whereas, Union college, located in the satd city of Schenectady, in close proximity with the said works of the General Electric company, and with a course in electrical engineering al- ready organized and in operation with special privileges granted by said company, offers ex- ceptional advantages for the supervision and direction of such work of ex:perilnentation and :, instruction as the interests o1 the State require ; and \Whereas It is important for the State to ascertain and establish official standards for electrical measuring instruments and apparatus and to secure independent and authoritative in- formation on questions of electrical science: therefore, ''The People of the State of New York, re- presented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows: ''Section I. For the purpose of providing in- dependent and authoritative information on electrical science, an official standardizing la- boratory for electrical measuring instrutnents, apparatus and standards, and an equipment for the work of instruction in electrical engineering, the sum of $r5o,ooo or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropri- ated, to be paid to the trustees ofU nion college, in the city or Schenectady, in the State of New York, to be expended in the erection and equip- ment of an electrical engineering school of Union college, to be known as the New York State laboratory of electrical engineering. Section 2. The sum of $25,000 shall be annually appropriated out of any n1oney in the treasury not otherwise appropriated to be paid to the said trustees of Union college to be ex- pended in providing for investigation, experi- mentation and instruction at and in connection with said State laboratory of electrical engineer- . 1ng. Section 3· The sums appropriated by this act shall upon the warrant of the comptroller be paid by the treasurer of the State to the treasur- er of Union college upon the requisition of the finance committee of the board of trustees of said college to be applied for the purposes for which the satne are hereby appropriated, and satisfactory evidence of work accotnplished shall be given to the comptroller with every

THE CONOORDIE~NSIS. requisition for money appropriated for the building and equipment of said electrical engi- neering laboratory. Sec. 4· The trustees of Union coHege shall deed to the State of New York such land now in their possession as may be needed for the erecHon of said electrical engineering labora- tory, under a prov~ision that the land thus con- veyed and the building or buildings erected thereon shall always be used for the purposes :set forth in this act. Section 5. One hundred free scholarships in ;el:ectrical engineering in Union college shall be , available for students who have been residents of this State for at least one year immediately pre- ceding their application for instruction in said college. These scholarships shall be distributed among the senatorial districts of the State, on the basis of one appointment for the term of four years from each district in each senatorial term ot office ;. 25 appointments from the whole State being :tnade each year, the first year from districts bearing odd nutnbers, the second year from districts beat·ing even nutnbers; all the appointments to be made by the department of public instruction of the State of New York. I. A competitive examination, under the direction of the department of public instruc- tion, shall be held at the County Court house in each county of the State upon the first Saturday of June in each year, when a scholarship appointment is to be made frorn the senatorial district or districts to which the county belongs. These examinations shall be held by the county superintendents and the school commissioners of the county. 2. Such examinations shall be upon such subjects as rnay be designated by the president of Union college. Question papers prepared by the department of public instruction shall be used and the examination papet·s handed in by the different candidates shall be retained by the examiner and forwarded to the department of public instruction. 3· The examiners shall witl1in IO days after such ,exatnination make and file in the depart- ment of public instruction a certificate in which they shall name all the candidates exarnined and •· specify the order of their excellence, and such canditlates shall, in the order of their excellence, become entitled to the scholarships belonging to their respective counties. 4· Notice of the time and pla~e where such examinations will be conducted shall be pub- lished as required by title 12 of chapter· 556 of the laws of 1894· Section 6. This act shall take effect immedi- ately. BOOKS ON SOCIOLOGY. 1901's Contribution to the Library. An assignment of twenty-five new books reached the Department of Sociology, Monday. They are the gift of the senior class and include most of the latest important works on Sociology and Econon1ics. This custotn of the senior class contributing its books was started by the class of '99, and has been continued since then. Instead of using regular text book:5, the work has consisted of lectures and collateral readings. In this way the department has secured nearly every important work on the subject of Sociology. \Famous Trials of the Century,\ by Atlay ; \Social Settlements,\ by Henderson; \Prisons ·and Prisoners,\ by Horsley ;\#\'Social Elements,\ by Henderson; \Trampin-g with Tramps,\ by Flynn; \The Tramp at Home,\ by Meriwether; 'A Teu Years War,\ by Riis; \'Social Laws,\ y Tarde; \Econotnic Crises,\ by Jones; \\Trusts in the United States,\ by Von Halle; \Monopolies and Trusts,\ by Ely; \The Cen- tury and Charity,\ by Mackay; \Suggestions Toward Applied Sociology,\ by Payson; ''Municipalities and Monopolies,\ by Bemis ; ''The Theory of the Leisure Classes,\ by Ver- blan; \Government of Municipalities,\ by Eaton ; ''The Distribution of Wealth,\ by Clark i'<\Statistics and Economics,\ by Mayo- Stnith; \Friendly Visits an1ong the Poor,\ by Richmond; \Crime and Criminals,\ by Dr. Christison ; ''Professional Criminals of Amer- ica,\ by Byrnes; \Degenerates by Max Nor- dau, and \Jukes-Edwards by Winship.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 \ POTTEQ AS WE KNEW HIM.\ Judge Y.ates' Reminiscence of His Old Friend. Nothing can be added to the graceful,. just and eloquent tributes that his brethren in the repub- lic of letters have rendered to the memory of the writer's old playmate and life-long friend .. Yet he gladly responds to the invitation of the Con- cordiensis to put on record in its columns, the retniniscences of one who knew him longer and better than any 1-nan living within sound of the college bell. Dr. Eliphalet Nott of Clifton Park went on ahead the other day, Dr. Potter has fallen beside him and there is no one here left ' in fact few anywhere else, of the old college gang to ramble with the write1· under the unchanged gray walls, and the unfaded glory of Jackson's garden. A very democratic horde was that college hill aggregation of hoodlums, for hoodlums they were. Sons of College Dons, sons of section officers and section janitors, sons of professors of every known science, and professors of dust and ashes fraternized with a magnificent disre- gard of the arrogant distinctions of society. Black \Hank ''Curly Bill,\ \Buster \Patsey Martin,\ \Sky McKinney,\ ''Gallus Gleason,\ \Paddy Whacl<.\ were the euphonious titles of men, son1e of whose names are known on both sides of the water, Bishops, Generals, Judges, College Presidents, Doctors of Divinity and of Law. All of tJ1e lads whose fathers were of the faculty were described by clerical visitors in the tnorning devotions as the ''children of many prayers,\ but their piety was not of the earlv kind, it developed later. It was not perceptibl~ in the horde which went down to tl1e corner of Jay and Union to fight the \dog corner boys.\ It was a strange dual life the college lads led- rigid decorum in their cultur~d hot-nes, vaga- bondia outside. And in all this motley crowd, '' Lif\ Potter was dearly beloved-by the now scattered survivors most deeply mourned. He was not vigorous, tall, very tall for his years, very thin but shapely, and always of that singu- lar grace of movement that we all remember, with ab handsome a profile as was ever carved. But slight of frame as he was, a brave cotnrade, above all warm, affectionate and true, full of a quaint humor that never stung, with a laugh that was quiet but fetching. He was nobody's enemy-he could not understand why anybody should be an enemy to him, and he never has so understood to the hour of his death. Looking back tearfully, as those who knew him in boy hood all look, one can understand sotne of the troubles of his later days. Those of us who remernber \Lif\ in his boyhood can comprehend the troubles of President Potter in l1is prime. He loved Union very dearly, as all of that old regin1e well may. Alma Mater was in the height of her glory. Down to the hour of Sutnpter her commencetnents were proud days. The governor and his cabinet were all there and always ''William Rufus\ as they called ''Billy\ Seward, the great Secretary who piloted the nation through its awful war. Names were signed to the register that were mighty then, are immortal now, faces that are carved in granite and marble on monun1ents in parks and. battlefields all over the land. And when in a later day there came a new acadetnic king on the throne who knew not Joseph and tried to repress the grand old chorus, ~'Here's to Thee,\ because it was not of Calvanistic origin, old chums of playground and college rose in rebel- lion, and ~hook the roof, made the chandeliers dance and turned the president pale with Fitz- hugh Ludlow's glorious song. The president and professors were massive in brain and influence. Today some of them are, some are getting to be, just as great and all just as good as they were then. The students are only as Fitzhugh Ludlow says, \wearing their dad's altered pants,\ the same kind of boys and as they gather on the ter- race, we see the fulfillment of his humorous prophecy. \Old Union thou shall see Them sitting where their dads have sat ' And smoking over thee. '' They have the same external reverence and inward contetnpt, for all authority that Gibbon

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. said the Pagan had for his God. 'They bowed low before the grave :and reverend ; behind his back he was ''Old Prex,\ \Pug\ Potter, BCapt.\ Jack, \Jack\ Foster, ''Horsey\ x..,.ates, '''Proso\ Proudfit, ''O~d Spikey,\ 4 'Pinkey\ Pier- son, ''Geodes\ GiUespie. The ran1part of veneration that surrounded the name of Dr. 'Tayler Lewis seen1s to have been impenetrable to even the ungodly irreverence of .the under- graduate-there was no nicknatne for him. But they wet,e universally beloved-· are rev- erenced in memory all over this broad land, and they were worshipped afar off, a great deal farther off than now. It was not a college of learning_, it was an institution that taught men how to succeed, and that nothing succeeds like success. Classics, literary and scientific lore were taught labori- ously and well by men of splendid learning ~nd world-wide fame. But the direction of brain and ambition was pointed out by the president in his lectures to the seniors in the old chapel and to the wayward in the dreaded study. All was said about the ditn hereafter that propriety required. But especial stress was laid on the earthly argutnent that dereliction did not pay here, that anticipatory raising of the devil before his time was not conducive to success on this side of the dark river. Very little said about the misty higher life, much about the better life to live to win. Very little about the eternal tor- ment of the hereafter, much about the hot time he would have tonight in the Doctor's study. It all counted. Men who had achieved great- ness, renown and wealth thronged commence- ments to thank the brightest politician the best judge of the ·boy human nature that ever lived in this state. Dr. Potter's father, Bishop Alonzo, con- cededly the head of the Episcopal church of America, has honored Union with his distin- guished natne. We had thrilled with a boy's awe when Union's great came yearly to her shrine. With the gang we had, from ·behind the grand old hedge in \Horsey\ Yates' garden, assailed with a rain of horse chestnuts \Chin\ Hoffman, future Governor of New York, and were the only ones to throw mud at '~Chet\ ~rthur, the most courtly and gracious P~esident of the United States since the day of Madison. Full of the tradif,ions, imbued with the policy that had made Union mother of the great, but also full of loyalty and love for the Alma Mater under whose roof we were born, and whose glory we feel to be ours he still hesitated long before he accepted the call to the Presidency. He wrote to those ruen and women of the old crowd who were here and we urged hhn to come. None of us are sorry that we did, or that he can1e. The Doctor may not have been a great finan- cier,-his grandfather was n<;>t, and Dr. Nott was said to be the greatest educator in America. He never claimed to be a man of great erudi- tion, yet he was far better educated than his pro- genitor-way ahead of hhn in book learning. Let it be rem em be red that when he came he found the old college answering the description of the attack made upon it by Senator Beekman -\Three millions expended and three barn-like buildings on a desolate hill.\ And let it not be forgotten that Union felt the touch of a magnetic hand, that she grew in strength and architec- tural . beauty until she is now the admiration of every alurnnus in America, and that all this is the effect of the stirnulus of his splendid energy. The monuments of his ambitious love for the college of his ancestry and his boy hood are planted all over Union's beautiful territory. In that he made the coUege woods 'and the desolate hill to blossom as the rose, his advent was an undeniable beneficence. Like his eminent brother he was channingly democratic. In the days of his most brilliant success, before those other days came in which in failing health he ·might say he had no pleasure in thern, he met us with the music of the old nicknatnes and was welcomed as \Lif\ to his unfeigned delight. Atnong the people he assumed no dignity, before the people he did not have to. It was all there. In pulpit, on the platform and comn1encement stage with his comtnanding presence, attractive face and the grand voice that retninded us of the first presi- dent, he was easily the most in1pressive presid- ing officer that comtnencement has known since '6o. Life and ~haracter have been generously writ- t I l 1

THE colllege awaits with mingled ho})e and fear the action of the New York legislature ou the elec- trical engineering school bill now before it. For a long tin1e those who have had the true interests of Union University at heart have been waiting a favorable opportunity for its intr:oductiou. It is thought that that time has now come, but no one can tell whether or not Union is to enter upon a new era until the bill has passed in the legislature and received the approval of the Governor. The strong arguments in favor of the bill are found in the resolutions published in another column. Editorial comment upon the measure has been favorable and unfavorable. Two leading newspa- pers of New York city-\The Times\ and \The Tribune' '-oppose its principles, claiming that it introduces tbe bad feature of \paternalism in education.''' Papers in a neighboring city, where another engineering school is located, oppose the the location of the institution in Schenectady. It is scarcely within the province of the Concor- diensis to dispute a question of principle wit~ such papers as \'The Times\ and \The Tribune,\ and yet i:t might be appropriately asked-Is not this prineiple of ''paternalism in education'' a feature of nineteenth century development and are not the .American cmnmon schools and state uni versi- ties examples of its practical application? The Empive State has more than onee manifested its deep interest in technical education. It is well enough to argue that rich men should be founders of such an institution and that innumerable techni- schools will soon be at the door of the legislature asking for aid, yet it might be again asked in return-Why have these men not given their money and ~is not electrical engineering at present more deserving of state aid than any other technical science? If such an institution is to be established, it is doubtful if a more appropriate place for its situation can be found than in SchenP.ctady. DELTA UPSILON BANQUET.

Well Contested Trials for the State Oratorical Contest. The preliminary trial to select Union's repre- sentative for the New York state intercollegiate oratorical contest was held in the chapel Tues- day evening. John McNab, 1901, was chosen as the representative and Archibald A. Lee, 1903, as alternate. In all there were five com- petitors and all showed considerable care in pre- paration as well as ability in delivery. The judges, Professors Hoffman, Ashtnore and Stol- ler, were unanimous in their decision. The first speaker was J. Lewi Donhauser, 1904, whose subject was \General Custer.\ The speaker traced Custer's brilliant record dur- ing the civil war and in the Indian campaigns~ comparing his death at Little Big Horn with that of Leonidas at 1~hennopylae. The second speaker was San1uel B. Howe, jr., 1903, who took as his subject, \Legal Murder.\ l\fr. Howe maintained that n\Iany critnes are the result of insanity and that punishment by execu- tion for crimes of insanity is wrong. The death penalty is a relic of savagery, lynching is unlaw- ful, capital puNishment is legalized murder and the BibJe condetnns these when it says, \Thou shalt not kill.\ \Oliver Cromwell\ was the subject of the oration delivered by A. A. Lee, 1903, who said that Cromwell was the tnan for the hour. lie found England in a state of chaos .and n1ade her the :first nation of the world. He was a self- .made man, respected alike by friend and foe. The country needed him and he, like the true and loyal patriot that he was, responded to her call. Adams, 1902, spoke on ''Municipal Prob- len1s\ and con1pared the evils existing in our cities with those of European municipalities, The causes of our corrupt cities are our corrupt legislatures and the unrestricted immigration. The remedy will only come when honest men are willing to enter into the field of politics and purify thetn. The last speaker was John McNab, 190r, whose subject was \The Ambition of Aaron Burr.\ He said that Burr's earlv environment \' was derogatory to hitnself and that he possessed many natural gifts but all became concentrated into self-loYe. He sacrificed everything to ambition. The only reward he received for his conduct was the scorn of his companions. The state oratorical league is composed of Rochester, Syracuse and Union. They tneet every third year at each institution and this year the contest will be held under the auspices of Union in this city. The date has not been defi- nitely decided upon but will probably be held during the first week of March. It is reported that a polytechnic school is to founded at Pittsburgh, Pa., at a cost of $3,000,- ooo, given by Andrew Carnegie.

12 THE CON-CORDIENSIS. THE SOPHOMOQE SOIREE. Brilliant Entry of 1903 Into the College Society World. Memorial Hall was a scene of beauty and delight last Friday night. The Soiree surpass- ed all previous afHtirs in its brilliancy. The tnerry couples danced from ten till four to the delightful waltzes and two-steps of Zita, and when all was over everyone wa& unanimous in declaring that 1903 had surpassed all former Sophomore classes in the success which crown- ed her efforts. The decorations were unique in character. Besides the usual festoons of garnet about the pillars and college banners upon the walls, fra- ternity banners were hung betwnen the pillars to designate the fraternity corners which had been tnarked off. These banners ~ere tnade for the occasion by Mr. Frederick Topping, a Syracuse graduate. The electric bulbs were covered with light garnet paper. The tnusic stand was hanusotnely draped in garnet and surrounded with hemlock. Above it, the in- genious underclasstnen had worked their class nutnerals in electric lights. The catering was by Owens of Utica. The dance was well patronized, so that, con- trary to the usual happening, no money was lost upon it. All in all, the Soiree was a splen- did success and an easy refutation of the state- ment that such a dance cannot be properly given in the Round Building during the winter. The con11nittee to whon1 a great share of credit for the success of the occasion is due, was cotnposed of the following: M. C. Collier, H. G. Hoxie, A. E. Bishop, J. A. Bolles, H. N. Bowler, G. W. Donnan, J. ~ Gulnac, A. S. Peck, J. L. Staeber and D. W. Weed.

Union Defeated by a Narrow Margin at the Indoor Meet. The Washington Continentals won out by a score of 44 to 3 7 at the dual meet held in the armory last Thursday evening. Both teams were i11 fairly goou condition and, as the result, the events were closely contested throughout the evening. Wells of the Continentals was the star perfonner, winning first in the broad jump and quarter, tieing for first in the pole vault and winning second place in the forty yard dash and forty yard hurdle. Langlois, 1904, was a surprise in both of the longer runs. l--Ie captured first place in the half in the fast titne of 2 :20 and came in a close second in the quarter.

He vvas born in Attica, N. Y .. on the 17th of October, 1819, the youngest son of Elijah and Mary Moore Norton. He received his early education in the acadetnies atCherry Valley and Lowville, N.Y., and entering Union college, Schenectady, N.Y., in the year 184-o, graduated fro1n that instituiion in 1843· He took his theological cour.se in the general theological seminary in New York city. Graduating in 1846 he was ordained deacon on July z6th of that year, in Zion church, Pierre- pont Manor, N.Y., by the Rt. Rev. Willia1n Heathcote DeLancey, D. D., bishop of western New York. On the 21st of July, 1847, he was ordained priest in Trinity church, Watertown, N. Y., by the satne bishop. Trinity church was his first parochial charge, and there l1e ren1ained fron1 1846 till r853, when he resigned to take charge of St. Luke's church, Jamestown, N. Y. In Jamestown he built two churches- the first one erected having been destroyed by fire in 1862. He also laid the co1·ner stone of the present church on the 29th of N oven1ber, r892, at the request of the present rector who thought it an honor well deserved by one who had done so 1nnch faithful work in the parish. Mr. Norton was rector of St. Luke's church till August, 1870. He then resigned and removed to Metuchen, N. ]., where he retnained as rector of St. Luke's church in that place till r882. He then took charge of St. Paul's church, Rahway, N. J., retnaining there till Easter, 1892, when ill. health con1pelled hin1 to resign,

In July, 1861, his sense of duty to his country impelled hitn to leave for a time the peaceful scenes of his work for Christ in Jamestown, and to pursue that work amid \war and battle's sound.\ He enlisted as chaplain in the 72d N. Y. volunteers, and served at various places in Maryland. B.eing attacked with catnp fever he was sent hotne on a furlough. But after his return to the arn1y continued ill health com- pelled him to resign his chaplaincy in :J\1ay, r862. The church in which he was a faithful and efficient minister considered hin1 worthy, as he certainly was. of sotne of the honors which she has to bestow on her clergy. He was for sev- eral years a trustee of the general theological seminary in New York. He was secretary of the convention in the diocese of western New York in 1869 and in r879 he was elected secre- tary of the standing committee in the diocese of New Jersey, serving the church and diocese in that capacity for 13 years. Mr. N o1ton was a metnber of the Masonic fraternity, taking his first degree, and joining Mount Moriah lodge during his early residence in Jamestown. He was a sir knight, and form- erly a member of St. John's commandery of Olean, N.Y. He was n1arried Oct. 15, 1846, to Elizabeth Proudfit, daughter of Stephen and Jane Martin Leonard, at Lowville, Lewis Co., N. Y. A son and daughter, Frederick and Miss Lucy Norton, survive and are residents of Jamestown. -Jamestown Journal.

The Concordie11sis VoL. XXIV. UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 28, 1901. No. 19. ADELPHICS WI:N. DEBATE. Individual Prize h1. the Allison-Foote Con- test Carried Off by Minkin, 1901. The Allison-Foote prize debate, held at the First Presbyterian church on the evening of Charter day, vvas closely contested by both of the literary societies. The Adelphic society leaders, who maintained that \The Latest Den1ocratic Platfonn Tr·uly Represents the Principles of Jeffersonian Democracy,\ were awarded the decision. Leopold Minkin, the third leader of the Philomatheans, was judged to have tnade the best individual speech of the evening, and will thet:efore receive the $5o prize on commencernent day. $5o will also be given the Adelphic society at that time. The judges were Judge A:lton B. Parker; Gen. Amasa J. Parker, '63, president of the law departn1ent; and Danforth E. Ainsworth, deputy Superin- tendent of PubLic Instruction. President Rayrnond introduced the presidents of the two societies-Henry S. Bahler of the Adel phics, and Harry A. Barrett of the Philo- matheans, who in turn introduced the repre- sentatives of their societies. In the opening arguments e~cl\l speaker was limited to eight minutes~ and in the closing arguments to five n1inutes. J. Albert Bolles, 1903, who opened the debate for the Adelpl1ic society, said that the purpose of the affinnative would be to prove that the Kansas city platform was consistent with the principles of Jeffersonian Den1ocracy in its declaration of strict adherence to the constitu- tion, of the necessity of avoiding the many entanglen1ents <>f foreign alliances and the burden of a large military establishment, of the encour- agement of ~gdculture, and of economy in the adtninistration of governtnental affairs.. Point for point, he attempted to show that such was the case. Lester W. Bloch, 1902, opened the debate for the negative.· He pointed ou.t tnany points in the 1900 platfonn which could not be reconciled with the beliefs of Mr. Jefferson. Jefferson, he ,claimed, was unalterably opposed to the free and unlimited coinage of silver at a fixed ratio with gold, as he recognized that any fix:ed ratio could not be maintained. According! y he put a stop to such coinage. There must be something radically wrong in a platform, if such rnen as Grover Cleveland, John G. Cartisle and William C. Whitney revolt and will not support it. The ·second speaker on the affinnative was Joseph H. Clements, Jr., 1901, who advanced several indisputable argutnents. He quoted the Kansas city platform as follows: \Jefferson said, 'Peace, comtnerce, and honest friendship with all nations ; entangling alliances with none.' We approve this wholesome doctrine, and ear- nestly protest against the Republican departure which has involved us in so-called world poli~ tics, including the diplomacy of Europe and the intrigue and land-grabbing of Asia, and we especially conden1n the ill-concealed Republican alliance with England, which must mean dis- crimination against other friendly nations, and which has already stifled the nation's voice while liberty is being strangled in Asia.\ The principle of J effersouian Detnocracy to maintain a neutral position in respect to foreign countries still exists in the Detnocratic party. Jefferson practiced economy in the mainten- ance of an at·my, and this was exactly what Mr. Bryan antd his followers believed. Jefferson said that \a well disciplined miUtia is our best reliance in time of peace,\ while the Democracy of 1900 maintained that \a small standing army and a well disciplined militia are atnpl y suffi- cient in time of peace.\ Jefferson believed in a limited expansion and the fostering of agricul- tural pursuits. The 1901 platform re-affirmed the doctrines. Walter E. Hays, 1902, claimed that the plank in the platform promising the irrigation

6 'PHE CONCORDIENSIS. of bad lands is a tendency ,toward sociaHsm, a thing which Mr. Jefferson <l:espisecl: and fought against. Jefferson vv~s an earnest advocate of expansion and of the so-c:a.iled ''i m peri:alism/' as shown in his purchase of Louisiana and in his .govern- ment of it, which was similar to that now accorded Porto Ri:eo and the Philippines. This policy cannot be reconciled with the 1900 plat- form. Democrats of the old .stamp were opposed to the sort .ofna.tional bank system advocated by the present-day party. ArthurS. :Golden, 1901, :the tl1il~d speaker on the affit·n1ative, said that J-efferson's fundamental political faith was heHef in and reliance upon all the people. His policy ~respecting domestic affairs is cleady shown in ]~is falU()US saying- '' Equal rights for aU, special privileges to none.\ The 1900 platform:, in :its affirmation of the party's detennination to strictly adhere to the principles of the DeclaTa.ti on of Independence and of the Constitution, and to oppose great trusts and combinations of capital, follows out Jefferson's ideas. The last Philomathean leader, Leopld Minkin, 1901, said that Jeffersonian Democracy was dis- tinctly opposed to anti-tntst legislation. Jeffer- son was an ardent \imperialist according to Mr. Bryan's definition. The army in Jefferson's day was proportionately larger than the army which exists at present and which the Kansas city platform attacks as \m ilitarisn1\ and a con- stant menace to the libe:tties of the American people. The closing; arguments w·ere sutnmaries and explanations <>f the argtrments already given. The college q_ uartette ren<le.t·ed selections while the judges were in consultation. JLidge Parker' in his annour1cement of the awm·ds, expressed himself as favorably impressed with the general excellence of the debate. The University of Pennsylvania. is to have a $35o,ooo gymn~siutn. John D. R..ockefeller pt-omises $2oo,ooo to Oberlin college on conditi()n that $3oo,ooo more is raised before Januat·y first, rgoz. A STATE ELECT~ICAL LA.BO~ATOQY. A hili :i1s pending in the State. Senate provid- ing for the establishment of a laboratory of electric engineering in ·connection vvith Union College in the City of Schenectady. It pro- poses an appropriation of $15o,ooo for the erec- tion and equiptnent of the laboratory and $25, ... ooo a year for its maintenance. In considera- tion of this appropriation-which is the equiva- lent of $3o,ooo a year-the State is to have the title to tile land and twenty-five four-year free scholarships annually in electric engineering at the college. The selection of Union College is determined by the fact that the great works of the General Electric Company are situated at Schenectady, and from them extraordinary facilities are to be obtained. The Times has never been an advo- cate of State support to higher education, believ- ing that expenditure of this sort should at least be deferred until the best possible education is provided i11 the eletnentary branches for all that are in a position to take it. But this is not the principle of the State, and there is tnuch to be said fo~· pa1tial support by the State for thorough special education in electric engineering. The interests affected are very extensive and various and conce1·n a constantly increasing number of the population. It is in this direction that much of the educational effo1t of the time is going, and the situation of Union College as well as the character of its present administration is such as to mal<.e this project worthy of the most care- ful consideration.-New York Times. Hereafter the degree of bachelor of arts will be granted to every regular graduate in the lite- rary department of the University of Michigan. The ruling was passed last week at the meeting of the Board of Regents who unanimously indorsed tl1e petition drawn up by the literary faculty and tendered for the Regents' considera- tion. In accordance with these resolutions, a committee of nine professors with President Angell as chairman, will be appointed to revise the present system of work.

THE OONCORDIENSIS. 7 INTE~COLLEGIATE ASSOCIATION. Annual Meeting of Amateur Athletes -·Officers Elected. The annual convention of the Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America was held last Saturday at the Fifth avenue hotel in New York. Forty delegates were present, representing over a dozen colleges and univer- sities. There are double that number of insti- tutions in the &ssociations but they were not ali represented. Albert C. Mason, of Harvard, the retiring president presided. It was announced that the annual games should be held in New York again this year. They are held on the 1ast Friday and Saturday in May. The statute was amended in several import- ant particulars. It was (1ecided that the faculty cornmittee which passes upon eligibility of can- didates for athletic honors sbould have its juris- diction confined merely to tl1e question of the candidates' scholastic standing. Heretofore, such cotntnittee has been accustomed to pass on the eligibility of the candidates as amateur ath- letes, as well as upon the standing as students. Another amendtneut, however, n1akes the rule regarding scholan,hip more stringent. In order to con1pete in association games those classified as \special students,\ if in their first year at college must have passed an entrance examina- tion equivalent to that required of students in regular courses. Still another amendtnent requires that if a student has cotnpeted in the games one year and then enters another institu- tion he cannot enter again until after a full cal- endar year has elapsed. 'I'his rule will have a tendency to save sn1all colleges from losing promising athletes who, in their freshman or sophomore year, tnight attract the attention of some wealthier institution whose supporters might offer inducements t<> get them to tt·ansfer their allegience. Seven institutions were admit- ted as members of the association, including the University of Michigan. The University of California. was dropped from the roll for non- payment of dues with perrnission to secure rein- statement within three weeks. The foUowi ng officers were ,elected : Presi- dent, E. A. Mechling, University of Pennsyl- vania ; vice-presidents, A. A. W:ebb, jr., Syra- cuse., and E. G. Goldthwait, Williams; secre- , tary, J. W. Gould, New York University, and treasurer, A. B. A. Bradley, Columbia. The following are on the executive committee: Thornton Gerrish, Harvard ; J. Hamilton Blair, Cornell; Sherman Coy, Yale; and James W. Jameson, Princeton. 1.96:1.. Information Desired Concerning Mem- bers of That Class. The Concordiensis is very anxious to aid the work of maldng the first com tnencetnent exer- cises of the new century exceptionally attractive by reason of the large number of alumni that shall attend the annual reunion. With this object in view, the paper has decided to carry out tnore fully the plan adopted and very suc- cessfully worked by last year's board. The plan is as follows : During the month of May, the paper is to publish short individual histories of the graduates of those classes that will hold their reunions in June. A copy of the paper will be sent every living graduate of those classes together with a cordial invitation to be present on Alumni Day, June 1 I. The attempt met with much success last year and it is hoped, will meet with tnore this commence- ment. In order to tnake these individual histories of '6r men as complete as possible, a copy of this num her is mailed to every living graduate of that class with a request that a short sketch of the career of each alumnus shall be sent to the paper as soon as convenient. The following information is especially desired. College fraternity, if any. Honorary or professional degrees .. Positions held in _civil, political or military life. Books written, if any. Present business and address.

8 THE CONOORDIENSIS. THE AQCHAEOLOG:tC~L INS'TITUTE. Opportunity Offered to People Interested to Become Memb-ers of the N. Y. Society. The President of the Ne:w York Society of the Archaeological Institute, Dr. Julius Sachs, has recently issued a circula:r letter, in which he requests the privilege of pre1Senting for metnber- shi p in the Institute the natnes of any person who \may be interested i·n the work of the Insti- tute. The letter calls ailten.tion to the fact that the price of men1bership hs ~~ro per annum, and that a member is entitle<} :to receive, free of charge, the quarterly i~s~es of the American Journal of Archaeology, w11ic11 is the official journal of the Institute. 'This journal contains full reports of all archaeo~ogical investigations conducted by the Institute~ a·s well as the ·papers of the American Schools of Classical Studies at At l1ens and at Rome. \Since its foundation· in, r 879,\ says Dr. Sachs, \the Institute h~l'S- promoted numerous archaeological investigatious, particularly on classical ground, in Greece, in Asia Minor, and in Babylonia.\ It has also contributed to the support of the two schools of classical studies, above mentioned, which h.ave become centres of inspiration for the classical scholars of this coun- try, and have already done much to provide our colleges with trained an<l enthusiastic teachers of the Classics. It is the aim of the tnetnb ers of the Institute to extend its work and influence. This they hope to do by increasing its men \'bership. All tnem- bers are entitled to tickets of invitation to all meetings and lectures c0onducted under the auspices of the Institute. Persons desirous of becoming tnembers are req_ uested to send their names to Dr. Nelson G. McCrea, secretat·y, etc., Columbia University, N e\iV York city. Sr))NEY G. AsHMORE.

Dr. Nott's Old Coachman TQ Stop Active Work. Perhaps for the last time Moses Viney has brought Mrs. Peissner from her home to the campus. 'The old tnan's eighty-four summers are beginning to press heavily upon him, and remorseless rheutnatistn has for him, as for all, no respite. So remembering Dr. N ott's legacy Moses has decided to give up active duties in the days to come. But he says that maybe when the bright springtime comes he will now and then get his carriage and for old associations sake take his charge up to the hill once n1ore. Moses early made up his mind that the sunny South was not. his destined home. On a May morning in 184o, he took his earnings, the accu- mulation of years, and started north. When he came to Schenectady, he entered Dr. Fonda's service and remained in it till r847, when Dr. Nott first employea hitn as coachman. Moses spent the years 1850-2 in Canada, after the Fugi- tive Slave Law had been enacted. He returned to Dr. Nott's service in 1852, as the president hed bought him and set him free. Until Dr. Nott's death Moses was his faithful and devoted body-servant, a tireless and affec- tionate attendant during the president's last illness. Since those days what Union man is there who has not talked with him at his work? Who does not recall hin1 as a part of the Old College herself? Need we say that we miss hin1? No, let us rather, as we see hitn now and then join in the wish that for Moses Viney fortune may yet have tnany a peaceful year in store. Dr. Raymond delivered an address before Perkiotnen Seminary, Pennsburg, Penn., on ·Sunday and yesterday spoke before the Hill school in Pottstown, Penn. Capt. Weed has issued a call to all candidates for the track team. Active training will begin every afternoon at 4:30 in the gytn.

If this should happen, the library would be located on the uppet· C()rner of Q!.tackenbos and Union. The site under consideration is perhaps as fine as could be selected. It hai been the policy -of the college trustees to keep the Union street fr()nt of the pasture clear, but it is not unlikely that the nature of the new building will be taken into consideration, and the policy for the once reversed. The sale of the property should realize a very fair s.un1. No formal negotiations have as yet taken place between either of the parties con- cerned .. SHAKESPEARE CLUB. The Old Organization Qevived. Stuclents interested in the reorganization of the· Sh~ke~peare Club held a tneeting Monday evening in theY. M. C. A. rooms. Consider- able iaterest in the project was manifested and it was. decided that a committee should be app()iated to confer with Dr. Truax with refer- ence to an introductory lecture before the club next Wednesday evening on \The Shakespear- ian Englishman as a Play-goer.'' Tbe Shakespeare club was several years ago a pote11t factor in the literary life of the college. A cordial invitation is extended members of the upper three classes to join the new organization. BASEBALL SUBSCRIPTIONS. ·$600 Needed to Pay Expenses for the Coming Season. The Athletic board estimates that $6oo will have to be raised among the students to carry out the baseball schedule announced in The Con- cordi en sis two weeks ago. A portion of this amount was subscribed at a poorly attended college meeting Monday morning. The class collectors have blanks for all men who have not yet subscribed. CAMPUS NOTES.

WHY would it not be an excellent plan to mark the pictures in the college chapel in such a way that undergraduates would not so frequently be placed in the embarrassing position of admitting to visitors that they do not know who the pictures represent? There are few men in college who know correctly three names out of all. THE editorial in last week's issue in regard to the establishment of a state electrical engineering school at Union, was misleading in so far as the attitude of \The New York Times'' upon the question was stated. \The Times,\ while . regis- tering its objection t() the principles of state sup- port of higher education, admitted that there are many commendable arguments for this particular bill. The entire editorial is published in another column. ANYONE who was present at the trial contest in the chapel at which Union's representative in the Inter-Collegiate Oratorical League was chosen, must have felt encouraged at the awakened interest shown in oratory among students. There were , more contestants for this place than usual, and it was evident from the orations that the men had devoted a good deal of time and energy to thier pro- duction. The interest in oratory and the desire to gain the honor was shown not to be confined to ope class, as so often has been the case, but there were representatives from each of the classes, one senior, one junior, two sophomores and one freshman. THERE was an organization at Union last year that accomplished a great deal of good, known as the Press Club. Nothing whatever has been heard of it this year. The club as it existed was undoubtedly an influence towards the betterment of the outside view of the college and was a. help in many other ways. There was a committee fr01n the club whose duty it was to see each student and, if possible, i.o get him to send his Concordienw ses, after reading them, to his preparatory school. The purposes of the club as a whole were to ''pro- mote a journalistic spirit in the college; to insure correspondence for newspapers and preparatory School publications; to prevent the circulation of untrue and unauthorized reports injurious to the college; and to promote the interests of the college through the press.'' This was a very laudable organization worthy of an immediate revival. THE Intercollegiate Association of Atnateur Athletes of America have adopted an excellent and much-needed rule which will do much toward stopping the wholesale robbery, of athletes from small colleges by large universities, which has been going on during .a long term of years. The new rule provides that athletes who have competed in the annual association games one year and who have then entered other institutions, shall be ineli- gible to compete again until an entire year has elapsed. One prominent university has profited to such an extent through the non-existence of this rule, that at one annual meet not a single member

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 of its team had entered in the regu.lar ~manner with the freshman class. The inducement of a stewardship which will virtually pay a man's college expenses, has been a sufficient attr-action to take many an athlete from his Alma Mater. It is a satisfaction to remember that the two leading New England universities have been little, 1 if at all, given to this practise. The mention. of the matter of Kilpatrick, Sands, and Cregan- all Union men at first-will serve to illustrate how large the average small college's loss has been under the old rules. THE management of the musical clubs has made the announcement that the farce ''Found in a Four- Wheeler\ or \Cabman 93\ will be repeated at the concert to be given in Albany in the near future. If such a program is carried out, a decided mis- take will be made. Every member of the indulgent audience who good-naturedly gave encouragement to the four members of the caste at the recent con- cert in the Van Curler, was of the opinion that the farce had better been left out. It is argued that an unforeseen happening prevented the men from getting the proper amount of coaching for the exhi- bition. On the other hand, there is much more argument in the statement that there has not been a single rehearsal of the farce since the public performance up to this week and that barely two weeks remain for further training. The Cornell \Masque\ gives a play in Ithaca every spring for the friends of the college. Its subject and caste are selected early in the fall and rehearsals are held very frequently throughout the winter and spring terms. The Senior Dramatic Club of Amherst, after professional instruction, makes short annual tours. Williams, Colutnbia and other colleges have dra- matic organizations which never venture to make public appearances except under the guidance of the professional instructor and costumer. These instances ·are given to illustrate the attention that is given to such matters at other institutions. When \Box and Cox\ and \A Proposal Under Difficulties\ were given at the Van Curler, a large amount of preliminary training· was manifest in the performance, and the men received well merited praise. ''The Bicyclers\ also deserved consider- able commendation, although many ventured the opinion that the farce itself contained too much .of the element of ''horse-play.'' The Concordiensis has no desire to discourage the study of dramatics among Union men, yet It would urge the necessity of having all out-of-town performances finished exhibitions, in so far as it is possible. It is hard to believe that two weeks' work on \Cabman 93\ will bring about such a result. The Albany concert always pays well because the clubs have always pleased the audience. Is there any reason for harming Union's reputation in that city? COLLEGE CALENDAI{. FRIDAY, MARCH I. 7 :oo P. M.::-Bible class at the Y. M. C.

'38.-Arrangernents for the public services to be l1eld by the citizens of Albany in tnemory of the late F~ther Walworth, were discussed at a meeting of the cotnmittee in Mayor Blessing's office last week. It was decided to hold the services in the Assembly Chatnber on the evening of March 19. The speakers secured so far are Bishop Doane, of Albany, and Rev. Father Walter Elliott of St. Thomas' College, Wash- ington,. D. C. Dr. Samuel Ward presided at the meeting and called it to order at 4 o'clock. Mr. Lan- ahan, chairman of the committee on hall music, reported that an orchestra of ten pieces was necessary for the occasion. They were author- ized to engage the orchestra. Mr. Lanahan called upon Superintendent of Public Buildings Bender, in 1·egard to securing the Assetnbly Chamber. He said that Mr. Bender told hin1 that it was doubtful if the trustees of the capitol would grant the request. He then. wrote out a fonnal request and forwarded it to the trustees. This will be considered at their first meeting. It was decided to have Secretary W adhan1s and the committee call on the trustees and urge the granting of the request. Rev. Dr. Battershall said that it was desirable to have a speaker who was not a clergyman, who would represent the social and municipal life of the city, to address the meeting. The suggestion was referred to the comtnittee on speakers. 0 n a motion of Mr. Wadhams, it was decided to pt·int the proceedings of the metnorial meeting in hook. fonn. The chairman was authorized to appoint a committee of three on publication. The committee of arrangements was authorized to have invitations printed of such style and character desirable. Mr. Melius spoke about the tnonument pro- ject, which was discussed at the last meeting. The idea is to erect a granite slab in the Aca- demy park, bearing the names of the first mayor, first patt·oon and first school teacher. On the fourth side Mr. Melius said Father Walworth's name should be inscribed. The plan was adopted. The finance committee was authorized to raise funds necessary to carry out the ideas of the committee. '45.-The John V. L.

He is the Rev. Leon C. Hills, a gradu- ate of Princeton Theological Setninary, and the school was established through the munificence of H. B. Silliman of New York city, who gave $ro,ooo for the purpose. A two story school building is now being built, the first story of stone and the second of some kind of hard \\\rood and not bamboo, which the natives use for almost every sort of building. The roof is to be tnetal. Besides the school building there will be a sn1all chapel (Presbyterian) and a manual training school building, where little Filipinos are to be taught carpentering, iron working, etc. A hundred acres of land have been purchased on which to teach the youngsters agriculture. The city of Dumanguete was selected because of the friendly attitude of the natives toward the Americans.'' '6o.-Williatn H.

A year ago Col. Hamlin was transferred to the business department, having been elected a director., vice-president and general rna nager. He was given con1plete executive contro'l of the paper, and within one year of the date of his elec~ion it is announced that ail of the floating indebtedness of the \Pioneer Press\ has been wiped out, and in addition a cash dividend has been paid to the stockholders., thereby putting the company back atnong the dividend-paying properties of the great North-vvest.

Baker has returned to his home at Comstocks to await the honor- able discharge from the volunteer army, after nearly three years' service ashore and afloat in and about Cuba, Porto Rico and the greater part of the Philippine archipelago. Captain Baker first obtained a cotntnission in June, 1898, and was ordered to Chicatnauga, where he served as qua·rtermaster of the Third brigade, first division, Third army corps, under the com-

14 mand of Brig.-General Colby. Later ·Captain Baker was assigned as quartennaster in ·Charge of the whole camp of the Third army corps under Brig.-General Royal T. ~~rank. Upon the reorganization of the army corps , November r, I 898, Captain Baker was ordered to proceed to Can1p Meade, Penn., as bri·gade quartermaster on the staff of Brigadier :General Chambe1·s McKibben. Shortly after his arrival he had the work of moving his brigade to Augusta, Ga., ·w·here, by his hard work of over·· :fifty hours without sleep, he br<>ke the record of the n1ove1nent of the various brigades in the Second army corps and earned the com:menda- tion of his superior officers. After a few months at Augusta the Second a nny corps, under Major General S. M. B. Young, was reorganized into three separate brigades, Brig- adier General Chambers McKibben command- ing a brigade of seven reghnents, while Captain Baker remained as his quartenna:ster and attend- ed to the transportation and equipment of some ten thousand men so well as to Teceive an offi- cial commendation from Major General Young. April I, 1899, the Second at-tny corps was disorganized and Captain Baker ordet·ed to Savannah, Ga., to take command of the United States army transport Sedgwick and carry the Secon-d United States infantry to Cienfuegos. Since that titne most of his duty has been to command various anny transports. His knowl- edge of conditions in nearly all ()f the coast towns or Cuba and Porto Rico was of 1naterial advant- age to his ~uperior officers. Wbile in the Philip- pines, he was assigned to duty as assistant to the depot quartennaster at Manila where he designed a surf-lighter of new model, which is now in general use by transports crusing about the archi- pelago, which have to land ca1·go through the surf. Captain Baker has gained a 1·eputation for thoroughness and executive ability and has been frequently commended officially by his superior officers.-Granville Sentinal. 1900.-] ohn M.
