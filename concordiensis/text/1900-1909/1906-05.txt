Again Manager Parsons feared trouble but the sajntly conductor smiled benign.!Iy and proceeded to rernove thirty 1niles too much. from the mileage book and i\Ve 1vere safe for the nonce. The genial host of the \\Vindsor received us with open arms and consigned We:lles, Vander- grift, O'Donnell and Snow to Xo. 23. Assembled at dinner the regular patrons were treated to several popular selections and en- cores for more but as the: hors d'oeuvres had been consurned it was necessary to hie our- selves to the theatre for the matinee. As a re- hearsal foJ? a few friends this performanee was a decided success but as a full-dress performance to a Warfield audience it missed the mark by about 400 people. At 4:30 the audience :put on her hat and went out to tell her friends how good it was. The clubs adjourned to see the Nor1nal and other points of interest i]l this thriving town and did not assemble again till supper time. Manager Parsons took a swift look at the as- sembled audience which filled the pretty play house and expressed himself gratified with the box-office results. The clabs gave the best per- formance nf their trip and were applauded again and again. At the close of the concert the clubs adjourn- ed to the X ormal where the girls tende~red them a very delightful dance. Xine o'clock next mornhirg found H1.e fellows awake and ready for depa.:rtau·e and after a farewell hand-shake with Prop1'ietor Richmond and Xate Fenton they Ina.rcl'wcl Hn·Clugh the streets singing the good o rd eo:llege songs and bade Oneonta a fond fare\\ve1IL They reached Schenectad1~ at noon tired but happy and voted that the tt~ip was unpa.ralleled success.

' ... 'HE CONCORD'IENSIS In the course of the lecture Prof. Landreth cited the diffei'.Pnt causes of strean1 pollution. and gave concl·(~te PXHnlples of each. He then described elPHlly the \'arious 1nethocls of O\'el'- coming th.{•se dange1·s and even utHizing the ap- parent waste-n1a tter. The laws goyerning the d~ffe1·ent departments of .sanitary supeeyision were quoted in part, and their effecth·eness ancl suitability discussed. After tbe :Lecture, \\'hich. was illustrated by ·diagran1s and point8, pertinent topics \Yere taken up by the lecturer arl'd several of the audience. X ot only were the mem hers of the society pres- €nt, but aJso several people from the city and '\':cinity who are especially interested in the sub- ject. Mr. Darling's Lecture. An extre,rne1y interesting lecture \Vas given in Silliman Hall last Sunday afternon by Mr. H. W. Darling. Treasurer of the General Electric Con1- pany. Mr. Darling is a thor-ough business man hirnseJ~ and consequently his lecture on \Business as a Lif.e w:ork\ \Yas extremely interesting. He put considerable stress on the importance of choosing a life ,,·ork; the thought and consideration that it oug-ht to rece-ive and the fitness of one' . .;:; self to follo1v any profession. Mr. Darling spoke of the great changes that had come over the business \l~orld in the past fe\v years; ho\v it was conducted by consolidated corporations rather than by individuals. He then spoke of habits as having a great in- fluence upon success in business; he claims t ~1at the American is a born trader and that business is in great pa:rt a natural instinct with him. Good business ability n1ay not always be born in a man but it is not beyond the :power of acquisition. Mr. Darling then mentioned the essentials· of a good business Inan; 1nethod, perseverance, regular- ity, accuracy, thoroughness, decision, ability to act calmly in times of emergencies; and above all truth. He als<> shO\\'ed wherein the English 1nethod of training young 111en differed from the American. Whether a rnan become engineer, doctor or law- _yer, some b11siness ability is necessary and Mr·. Darling's speech shO\Yed ho\v ilnrwrtant this is. His talk was highly appreciated as indicative of the interest ·which he has h1 the coUege. lt is hoped that Mr. Darlin·g n1ay be persuaded to lee- tv 1·e again before the students. Edwin Vi ilbur Rice, Union, '56. Ed win WHbur Rice, D. D., of Philadelphia, lec- tured in the college chapel last Friday. Dr. Ric•\' is an alumnus of rnion and father of one of the present trustees of the college. His subject was, \Early Colonial Household Literature of A1nerica.\ In the course of the lecture he showed how IittiE' lit rature the early colonists had, and to what a11 extensive use they put that ·which they did have. The unusual hun1or and peculiar ideas held by the critics of the earlie1' times served to m~1ke Dr. Rice's lecture highly interesting. He was kind enough to read some examples of the ballads and other literature common to tht:> earlier tilnes. Particular reference was made to the \Ne\v E'ngland Pi'imer\ and \Poor Richaru's Almanac.\ The fe\\' that attended the lecture were a;mply re- :paid. It is to be regretted that more students did not avail themselves of such an exceptional op- portunity.

1'HE CONCORDIENSIS 1.1 BROWN STUDENTS T.Q· CONTROL ATHLETICS. ltadi<•al Change of :Hanage-n:tent, A supplement to the Brown Daily :Hera:ld gives an account of n1atters in ·wflich all students are keenly interested. The corporation of Bro'lvn Uni- versity sor:ne ti1ne ago requested the Faculty to as- surne contl'ol of athletics, and in clischa.1·ging the duty, the foUowing staten1ents were p1·esented to the student 'body: ''That intercollegiate athletic contests as at pees- ent conducted n1·e attended by evils de·rnanding im- Inediate ren1edy is a conviction that has forced it- self recently on all our educational institutions. Exaggeration of the in1portance of athletics; sys- teinatic evasion of rules of eligibility; secret in- ducements in n1oney or its equivalent; excessiv1..: luxury, e·xttavagance, and often n1isrnftna.gement in the use of funds; frequent discourtesy, unfairness, and hrutaHty in the condul't of gmnes-these are evils apparently characteristic of intercollegiate athletics eYerywhere. Unless they can be elelnin- ated, it is evident that these contests cannot be al- lowed to continue.\ * * * * \In so far as it is ilnpossible· to eradicate evils by means of legislation, and in so far as rnatters arP. by their very n.a.ture of particular concern to th\~ students themselves, the students should be made responsible for them. Thus to students should b~ entrusted the choice of regulations concerning or-. ganization, rules of play and eligibHity, apart from matters of scholarship and attendance; and of them n1ust be de·rnanded that they conduct their gameB and affairs honestly and fairly. In accordance \Vith this principle the Faculty ha'3 decided to adopt a set of regulations, subJect to such additions .and revisions as· circumstances ma:r seem to require. The main features of these r·egu.- lations, so far as they differ from those now in fo:·ce, are as follows: 1. The appointment, subject to the approval of the Corporation, of a Supervisor of Athletics, among whose duties shall be the exclusion from teams of men \\\Yho are physically unfit; eontrol of finances; super:v·ision of the work of n1anagers; - - -- -----~-- ------ supervision .of coaching and training; and so far as he can a·ccornpUsh it, 1ihe maintenance of i}Hope.· standards of play and conduct. 2. Lin1itation. of the absences allowed fo1· athletic purposes to a n un1 be1· not exceeding that which any student n1ay take without being I'equil·ed to accom;t for them. 3. The exclusion of all students who h:r\'e en- tra nee conditions; ana of all \\·ho have deficiences amounting to n1ore than four hou1·s for the :preeeJ- ing tenn, or n11ore than nine hours for n 11 pl~eyious tern1s. 4. The exclusion of all students in thci r first year of l'esidence, and of graduate students. 5. The retention in the hands of the Facult~r of the power an c1 obligation imposed upon it by the CorpOI'ation to ,make such modifications in th·~ future as the interests of the university n1a1 seen1 to require:' * * * * \Subject to the restrictions enurnerated above, the Faculty here\:rith entrusts to the students the power to determine and the obligation to enforce the rules· of organization, .of eligibility and of play, under ·which theii~ contests shall be conducted. The only further conditions it irnposes are that the first set of rules passed by them shall be submitted to the Faculty for approval; that no change in €xist- ing rules or in rules subs.equen tly adopted sl1all go into effect until the beginning of the acade1nic year following their adoption; that such change;-:; shall not be inconsistent with the ends vvhic.h the plan hereby announced has in vie\v; and that a eopy of every .change in these rules. shall be filed with the Secretary of the Faculty as soon as it Is a0opted.\ UNION, 7-COLGATE, 1. \Cuion \\\Tins an Interesting Ga1ne. The first game of the season· on the cmnpus t()ok place last Saturday and resulted in a victory for Union. The game was an interesting one through- out and sho\\ved the home team up in first rate style. There \\Yas no over-confidence felt and therefore the team played the best they knew how.

Frm11 the first inning, when Union scored four runs, the gan1e \Yas never in doubt, although there was exciten1en.t enough to 1nake the gam.e an interesting one. Errors we,re p~entifui on both sides. Union's hits were \Yell bunched but Davis kept those of Han1ilton ·~;\·ell scattel.~ed except in the first when fou.r ·were rnade. There \Yas no scoring hovvever due to Union's fast fielding and Hmnil- ton's poor base runnin.g. r.rhe special features of the garne included the batting of Bel.'gan and Captain Rjder and a pretty catch in the fourth of a difficult ball well out in center by Hildreth. In the fourth jnning \Yith two men out and bases full Capt. Rkler can1e to the bat. After t\VO strikes and tluee balls had passed he drove out the longest hit cf th'e year, scoring three runs and n1aking second bas€. Later in the san1e inning he scored on a pretty single n1ade by Hagar. Bergan was the only 1na11 on the hom.e tean1 to n1ake two hits. Hagar as usual played his brilliant gan1e in centerfield.

. 'THE. NORTHFIELD CO'NFERE.NCB \\\'bat It is and \Vhat It )leans, ::\Iatters of hl- terest to All Students. :Curing the su1n1ner n1onths, N·orU.lilleTd Set1.1inary, situ a ted a~ Ea·s t N ert h,fielc1, Mass., is the scene gf seve.ral cnnfernees ·on Christian V'i'Ol\k each last;]ng from a week to ten days. One o:ti the most iirn- portant of these confernces and certah1ly the n.J.~st valuable one to coHege m.en, is the student con- ferenc,:e. Last ye::u· the Student Con-ference occurred d.u r- ing the fi1·st ten days of July and 1r as attended by upwards of (3.5:@ men, representin_g 131 colleges of the Eastern. States and Canada. 'J'his year the con- ference will be held a week earliee and preparations are being rnade f0r a stili larger nun1ber. Northfield Sen1inary is a beautiful college built qp in the hills of the Connecticut val:Jey, just south ~f the border point of Verm.ont, Ne\-Y Ha1npshire and Mtl'lssachusetts. The country is o:f ,the finest to be found in the ~ew England States, and the selniil--1- ary itself is but little less picturesque. Du.ring the ten days of the conferenc·e the dele gates live in the dorn1itories or tents on the campus and board at hvo or three of the college buildings. \Ca1np Northfield\ higher up in the hills also furnishes an abede for son1e of the students. The Student Conference is unde1- the direction of the International Com:,mittee of th€ Young Me:n.'.s Christian Association and has as its supreme pur- pose the training of students for Ch.ristian service in their after life as well as in their college career, whether their chosen life-\.vorks are distinctly relig- ious or purely secular. To this encl the pr.ogram of the conference is com:pos·ed of Bi\ble study class~s, \platform\ and \round top\ held meetings in tbe morning and .evening, while the whole afternoon is given over to out-door sports. The platform. 11.1eetings are heid in the la:r;ge auditorium and are open to the puhlic as well as 'to the· delegates. They are addressed by some of the best and ablest speakers of the Arner-ican and Eng- lish pulpit. Thus the conference affords to th<Jse vvho attend an opportunity to near men whom ' they probably would not have the ·opportunity to hear under other conditions. There are aJso 7 abuttdctnt oportun. ities of meeting and talking -with the·m :p.riva te·ry as \\·el las heal'ing then'l. in forrnarl aclClt·esses. '\RGund Top\ is· a knoll on the Southern side of the campus front which a fine view for miles uu the Connecticut valley is obtainable. Here the· delegates gatne1· directly after supper to listen to short iHformal talks on the opportunities for Chri:s- tian ~erYice \Yhich are offerd in the different 1ntlks of life. It is taken for granted that 1nost of the n1:en have chosen their life work, that 1nost of them have chosen s2cular callings and that all of them are anxious to do what good they can fot theie fel- lmv-men. \Round Top\ is a great inspiration to all the men who attend the conference and is one of the longest re1nembered and n1ost pleasant of Northfield experiences. The first t\.vo hours after breakfast are g.iven to Bible study and conferences on Christian 1vork in the colleges. The Bible study \Yill be carried on under the group syste1u, with a bout ten or twelve n1.en in each group. These groups will be taught by men ·who are authorities on the subject of Bible study, and these teachers. vvill in turn meet each day for instruction by some of th~ best Bible teach- ers in this and other countries. The conferences on personal and association 1vork will also be held in as· srnall groups as possible. in order that the conference may not be at all tedious and that everything possible to develope 1nen in all branches may be offered, the afternoons are given over to the men to use as they choose. Wh.lks are arranged through the country and ath- letic events are scheduled for each day. A base- ball series·, a tennis tournan1.ent, cricket, basketball and lacrosse games, a track n1eet and swimming fon1.1. some of the athletic events. In previous years the Fourth of July celebration has been. one of the most interesting features of the conference. The celebration begins· after sun-down in the auditorium which is gaily decorated with national flags, pennants and colors of the different colleges, each d~legation sitting beneath its distinc- tive e1nblem. After patriotic speeches by one or two of t11e pron1inent men present, each college having a dele-

8 ':L~HE CONCORDIENSlS gaUon of five rnen is eaHed upon for a college yel:l, and eaeh delegation of twelve or 1nore men for a verse oif tiheir college s-ong. Needless to say the ·whole scene is a rnost insp~ring one. Directly after tb.i;s an im:mense bonfire, Rearly a hundred feet in hetght is kindled and the deJ:egations dance around it s irnging and chering fo1· their colteges and for each ot'11 er. Although the confeeence this yea'!.' wHI not inc:I'ude July Fourth, the celebration will r1<ot by any rneans be omitted. Pnobably the one thing that impresses a delegate to Nor01:ti:ei:d n1ore than anything else is :what may best be described as th.e \Northfield Sp.irU.\ ?\o other phrase exactly expresses it, and no nun1ber of IJhntses can exactly describe it. It is college spirit of the finest kind, an enthusiastic, trustful feeling of good feHO\Yship and a rnanly Christian earnest- ness. If a man recei\·ect nothing els·e fron1 North- field it ,,~ould be fully worth his while to go there silnply to come in contact with the \Northfield Spirit,'' feel its influence, and be a part of it. Last year Union was represented at Northfield by only three men, so that the privilege of giving a yell at the Fo11rth of July celebration was denied. For the same reason, :Union yells at meal tin1es were decidedly fe\v and far between. This year Union should se11d enough men to give a verse of \The Song to Old Union'' at the celebration. That rneans twelve In en. The Christian Association \Yill have a large enough fund to pay a consid·er- able share if the expenses of that nuinber of men. The men \dil not be chosen from the men1bership of the Association, but from the· college at large. The co11fen:-nce beginR on June 22nd and continues until July 1. Spe-cial rates \Viii be made by the different 1·ailroad~. Inforrna tion a bout the confer- ence m<.~y be had at Sillin1an Hall, and it is hoped that any 1nan who 1nay be able to go will rnake the fact lnlO\Yn. This is a great opportunity and should be taken advantage of by a large nun1ber of stu- dents. ---- Musical Club Notes Tlle present musical season is one which has reflected great credit on Union CoHege considering the handicap placed on the clubs early in the sea- son. It was very difficult to book g0od dates and muoh valuable time wa:s ~ost 1n getting ready for the initial performance whi·ch took pla-ce during Junior Week.

The clubs have been supported entirely by private funds this season and deserve the support of the student body next year.

( )ne cannot fail to see that if the l~tter course be pursued, the very object of the ceren1ony is defeated. It is 'highly gratifying ~o know that the s~'nti- 111ent of the present senior cia:: s is opposed to such a ·course. It is the idea, however, to n1aintain the good points of this inter- esting- custon1. Such an idea n1ust of necessity be above unfavorable cnttc1s1n. It is only through the n1aintenance of col- leg-e cnston1s that the best spirit is culti- vated. This custon1 is peculiarly adapted to the cultivation of such a spirit, provided always that it be attended with a spirit of order and seriousness. It is ttndoubtedly true that on previous occasions many un- desirable features have been present. But it is a18o true that the most praisewGrthy features have been partially obliterated as a result of thoughtlessness and disorder. Be this as it 111ay, the fact still ren1ains an indelible in1pression has been 1nade upon the n1inds of the three upper classes. It is well that a sin1ilar itnpression be 1nade upon the 1nincls of the fresh1nen for in after years the ren1en1brance of such an occa- sion will stand out in bold relief.

At the Vesper Service last Sunday afternoon Dr. Lunn of the Fi:rst Reformed Church delivered a -v·ery interesting taik on \The Ministry.\ :Some Further Discourse of the Statues After n1y first experience \Vith the statues in the chapel I went often to n1y hiding place to wa tell tl11em. Several weeks passed by and nothing hap- pened so at last I began to believe that n1y ex- perience was only the result of an ovenyrougbt fancy goaded on by that monstrous voice. One night after a feast at De\·ine's, that region of good things. I rnade up rny mind to give the statues one last trial. So I entered the chapel by a \vindow that I had purposely kept unlocked, and hiding behind one of the 111.useun1 cases sat down to wait for the \ghost to walk, as a man of the quality would put it. For full half an hour I sat there and not a sound anywhere in the chapel. I had just determined to leave; when Pheobus Apollo gave a mighty yawn. And such a yawn! It was as if the thousand sleep- ers had all come back to life at once. Straight- way all the other statues woke, and then began a great babble that went up even to the throne of Zenus. A babble like the Magpies make as they fiit from branch to branch of a :flowering tree in the early springtime. There gods and goddesses forgot their dignity in the eag·erness to tell what they had been considering for so long in their mute stone hearts. They talked of every thing from transcendentalism to Least Squares. Poetry, song, history and learned disco-urse fell from those lips in such a confused jangle that I could scarce under- stand any of it. At length when the last argument had been argued and the last reason reasoned, all ceased as suddenly as they had begun. After a short silence lame Vulcan, his voice hoarse with much talking, thus addressed lYrercury, \Ah! N·o ble lYI essenger. I take great delight h1 n1y new temple that has been builded for me at the edge of the sacred groYe. Great zero! Hs tall stack sends forth 1nore good black sn1oke than 1ny own forge \vas wont to do on the sumrnits of Mt. Olyrnpus. Soon ·will I have the ear-splitting stearn whistle in its place; and 1ny an1·H will be >moved up fron1. the Locomo- tive \iVorks across yon fertile pasture. Then, srna:ll care \YiU I have 1vhether college keeps or not, for I at le-ast \\\ill have my pleasure, the rolling s,moke will rise like the savor of a burnt offering at mm·ning, at noon and at night: and with my anvil and whistle of shining bl':tss I can delight n1yself with noise.\ Then Venus interrupted his easy flowing speach and told of the night when they had all gone out to perade upon the C<:unpus in honor of a victory for the ''Sacred Garnet.\ She told how they had tried to play the game of baseball and how the early da\vn had come upon the1n ere they were aware~ how they had been turned back to stone right where they stood on ever they had time to reach the friendly shelter of the chapel. Then aiJ applauded the telling of the tale and they laughed to think how the blan1e for their adventure had been put upon the underclassmen. Thus one after the other each had his say. One prophesied, another sang, and still another told stories of the olden days when the college was young. At last Athena began \.Yith an history and a prophecy of much interest to all. (T'o be continued). ON. SENIORS TO MOVE UP Interesting Custont to be Observe(l. lv.Ionday morning is the time set for. the n1oving up in chapel.

Opponents Again Victorious. Uni0n's debating team was declared defeated when the jud;ges brought in their decision before the a,udience in Kirkpatrick chapel at New Bruns- \Vick last Friday evening; and Rutgers thereby added one 1nore victory to her l:i.'St. The question, Resolved, \':E'hat Civic Interests are Best Subserved by the Municipal Ownership and Operation of Public Utilities'', was advocated by Union in the affirmative under three heads. Viz: That it is practical; that it is economical; and that it would lessen corruption among public of- ficials. Reed '06 led the attack by stating that, b0th in ' this country and in other Iar:ds where it has been tried, n1unicipal ownership has been an unparalleled success; and he cited numerous cases to bear out his arguments. Bevier, '06 of Rutgers stated that the tack of the negative would be to prove that well enough should be let alone, and the succeeding Rutgers speakers Senkel, '07 and K!ain, '06 followed out this line of argument. Putnam, '06 and Lewis, '06 showed respectively \Walk-Over\ Oxfords for Spring, '06. The extreme styles, as well as those of more quiet design, are to be found in this most popular line.

THE CONCORDIENSIS Union-Rochester Track Meet On Saturday, May 12th, D1e coUege tl'ack team heil.d its first dual meet of the season at Rochester. The contest ·was close thro'M.ghout, and the lead kept changing from one temu to the other, so that the scor·e was not decided tDl the v·ery last event. Rochester \V·on with 6l1h points to Union's 5412. The conditi011 of Capt. Whh'hon \Vas a gr.eat mis- fortune. Two sprained ankles crippled hirn so that he could not capture his •usual numbe,r of first places. The ne\v m.en on the teaiJ.n showed up ,,·ell and good wo·rk is expected h·om them in the next hvo \Veeks. Of the old men. Closson and von Dan- l1enburg not only lived up to their old reputation but Closson did more by beabtng the college record in the hamn1er thro\v by seven feet. The meet star ted auspicio 11.sly with Closson in the hammer ring and his phenomenal throws brought forth the only chee,rs heard during the afternoon from the Rochester bleachers. At the sa1ne time Wood, the crack :Rochester Inan, n1ade his first appearance on the field in the high jump in which ev·ent he captured tirst place at the lo\v height of 5 ft. 1 in. The hundred and t'iventy yard hurdles followed and Langley- easily captured first place, the run being rnade on.. a fa·st piece of turf. In the mile run Wood sho\ved his great endurance powers by beating out Heed and Flo\vers in a pretty sprint at the end, a performance \Vhich he dupli- cated later in the two mile ru.n. The track for the distance events ,,·as far· frmn ideal, being n1erely a chalk mark around a somewllat irregular campus, leading throl:lgh ditches and other rough. places. An uphill stretch had to be rUTl directly in the face of a heavy wind, a circumstance which leng·thened the time greatly. Bid\vell showed up well for Rochester in the sprints capturing first in both the hundred and tv\To-twenty yard dashes. Raytnond, '08, and Sammons, '09, cmne in ahead of the Roch- ester men in the half ·Inile, one of the prettiest races of the day.

Th~ game \vas the 1nost exciting one from the spectators standpoint, that has bee-n seen on the campus. this year. It was a loose game poorly played \dth errors on both sides but Union deserves a lot of cr€dit for pulling out o·f a bad hole. R. P.
