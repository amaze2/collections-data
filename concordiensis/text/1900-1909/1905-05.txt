Dr. Thomas vVallace vVright on account of ill health and not having sufficiently recovered dur- ing his leave of absence from the college, has tende.red his resignation to the Board of Tfustees. As yet no action has been taken by the board and it ·will be deferred until the next mt>eting, which is sometime in June. Since 18 84, Dr. Wright has been professor of applied mathematics in the college. He was a student at the University of Toronto, g,raduating in the year 1863. The following year he was of- fered a chair in Galt Collegiate Institute as teacher of mathematics and physics, \Vhich he held until 18 71. He then entered Sheffield Scien- tific School of Yale University, there havirlg con.- ferred upon him. the degrees of Ph.B. and C. E. After leaving Yale he was for ten years engineer on the United States Survey of the X orth and Xo:rthwestern Lakes, and then was transferred to the Survey of the Illinois River, as instructor of Civil Engineering in Lehigh University his term was short and in 1884 he came to Union . .So far during his career in the educational world he has contributed to the Analyst, the Jour- nal of the Franklin Institute, Van ~ostrands En- gineering Magazine and also is the author of ''A Treatise on the Adjustlnent of Observations.\ Dr. vVright is a member of the Theta Chapter of Psi Upsilon and also of Phi Beta Kappa. Prof. Prosser at Ohio. It may be remembered by some o.f our readers that Charles S. Prosser, who was professor of geology in Union from 1894-99, has been :professor of geology in Ohio -State University since leaving

6 THE CONCORIJ!E/V .. ~'IS\. Union. During that period the number of stu- dents in the geological departlnent of that univer- sity has increased 13 7 per cent. while the increase cepting Saturday, when the hours will be fro.m 8 to 1. Chapel will be held at the usual hour of 7:45 o'dock. The object of this change is to re- in the total number of students in the university lieve the crowded work of both professor and I was but 59 per cent. The instructing force of student. We understand that everybody will have the department has consisted of Professor Pros- ser and another professor; but at the ~ast meeting of the Trustees it was voted to add an assistant professor to the department.

As there seems to be some doubt in the minds of the students as to the recitations for .next year, we might state that the Faculty has de~ided to hold classes every day from 8 to 1 and 2 to 5, ex- two hours at noon between classes. It is also the desire of the Faculty to have the schedule so ar- ranged that the so-called stra,ight hours may be done away with as much as possible, it being the general opinion that three, four or five consecu- tive classes is too much of a tax upon both pro- fessor and student. Seniors Move Up. \Moving-up Day\ was celebrated Monday, de- void of the usual bolting but otherwise being very similar to other days of its kind As a result of a misunderstanding of what was desired by the Seniors, the Faculty had forbidden them to move up on the p-roposed date. It was feared for a time that a conflict might result, but last Satur- day the Seniors got busy and obtained the con:- sent of the Faculty to move-up, promising that there could be no bolting. In this spirit, all m.orning exercises were carried on in the chapel, in the allowed hour. The other classes followed the Seniors and classes were made as usual. The cerem;ony of painting the idol white was perfonned at four o'clock that afternoon by the two under classes, with a great show of good feel- ing between. Our Guardian Spirit now wears his more or less white coat until hostilities open around him in the fall. Chi Psi Dance. One of the most delightful events of the college year occurred in the Chi Psi Lodge last Friday evening, when that fraternity gave its annual spring reception and dance. The dancing began about 9:3 0 o'clock and continued until half past two in the morning. Those present were Dr. and Mrs. F. S. Hoffman, Dr. and Mrs. F. B. Williams, Mrs. V. G. Furman, Mr. and ::M!rs. Stewart, Mr~ and Mrs. F. Van Olinda, Mrs. A. J. Thomson, Rev. and M:rs. Talmage, Dr. and Mrs. Ja1nes Stoller~

From now on the Glee Club will rehearse regularly twice a week, Monday evenings and Thursday afternoons; and the Ins:rumental Club, every vVednesday afternoon. Of course a second evening concert in Schenectady means an entirely new program; and outside of the college songs, the Glee Club will offer nothing which it has used be- fore. The Instrumental Club has also several brand new selections. The quartette is in good shape and has been practicing faithfully, having already taken and successfully carried through two concerts, and Friday evening will give another at Gloversville. It is very probable that between the two parts of the June concert, the Dra1natic Association of which Classen '0•6 is president, will occupy the stage. The new music f.or both clubs i.s not so much on the clasical order; but of the rollicking sort that men like best to sing and play, and the concert, instead of being a recital or an attempt to display artistic musical finish will be rather an attempt to give the audience their moneys \:Vort:h in laughter and en.tertainment College Briefs.

This n1ore even distribution of \vork ought to give opportun1t1es to tnany 111en in college for con1peting for positions on the various athletic tean1s. The greatest con1plaint of our coaches has lately been that the n1en do not have tin1e enough to deyote to training and practice. Then too, this plan \\Vill practically con1pel attendance upon college games and exercises, on the part of a large nun1her of n1en who go hon1e O\~er Saturday and Sunday.

THE CONCORDJENSIS. II have to be deferred to another titne. Ho\v- eyer, can not this be accon1:plished during the week, if we have rnore tirne then? Un- doubtedly, it will be unfortunate for the 111an who goes hon1e over Saturday and Sunday to save expenses and also for the 1nan who is obliged to work in a store Fri~ day and Saturday. It will, too, do a\vav ..; -vvith Friday evening gayeties, to son1e ex- tent, but does this 1nean that Saturdav vv-ill _, be any the n1ore pea.ceful? Still, we feel that such a change \vill be fa,Tored by the students generally and that they will support the Facultv in its desire _, to lighten our labors. If \ve were to 1nake any cotnplaint at all it would he on the score of chapel bolts. As we will be obliged to 1nake chapel oftener, would it not he fair to allow us a few n1ore bolts? Our track tean1 tries conclusions \Yith Rochester this afternoon in the second n1eet of the year. The n1en have been \vorking harcl and faithfully to 1nake the result of this 1neet different fron1 that of t\vo weeks a~:o <... and also to n1ake up for the defeat suffered at Rochester's hands last year. They have also before then1 the 1nark set for then1 bv the brethr·en on the baseball tean1. ...r\.11 suc- cess to then1. Our good wishes are also \vith the base- ball 1nen. Having won six straight gan1es on the can1.pus, for the first tin1e in three \v-eeks they are playing on strange g-rouncl. They play this n1orning with scarcely any tin1e in which to work off the stiffness of their long trip, so a victory will be doubly creditable. Another \n1oving-up\ clay has con1e and gone, marking the rapidly nearing end of another year. It is a 1natter worthy of con- g-ratulations on all sides that the ceren1onies, which at one tin1e looked as if they tnight n1ake trouble, went off with no conflict be- tween the Faculty and the students. It can in no wise be denied that the occasion lacked son1e of its forn1er entertainino- fea- b tures, but no doubt vve vvill all li\·e as long for having rnade classes that day as \Ye \vould had the clay been n1ore in line ·with its predecessors.

THE COJICORDIEl\lS!.S Union Defeats Middlebury. Last Saturday Union added. the .sixth successive victory to this season's baseball schedu~e. winning fr,om Middlebury in the best game tha,t has 'been .seen on the campus this .sprtng. 'fhe features of the .game 1vere Rider's sensa- tional stop of a grounder, for \Vhich he \vas obliged to stretch his full length on the gtound; Davis's good pitching, and the e~cellent form in which Vogt threw to .second base. The manner in which the team steadied down in tight places was encouraging. In one inning two were on bases and none out; in another Fisher drove out a three bagge:r and roosted on third while three were put out; and in the last inning, three were on bases with one out. In every case the side was retired easily and at other times :Middlebury \vas held safely.

Union failed to score unttl the third inning \vhen a hit by Davis, a couple olf errors by Chad- burne, and a clean hit by Rider netted 3 runs. In the fourth the eollegians added. four runs to their score and another in the sixth. Each side scored t-hree times in the eighth. Hawkes, of the Mohicans, pitched an excellent garne, allowing only seven. hits, but the fielding behind him was wretched. The game was devoid of any sens?-tional features. At all thnes, except one inning, the boys worked well, but there was no snap in their play. This was partially due to a feeling of confidence, which should not be al- lowed to grow into over-confidence. The score: U~ION. A.B. R.

It is earnestly hoped that Hamilton will soon not'fy us exactly what matches they '\Vish to play, as th·s will make it easier for us to select the team., and obtain the necessary practice. The umpires have not as yet been obtained. The trials as far as they have gone are shown in the follow- ing scores: Vincent beat Meeker 6-3, 6-0. King beat Becker 6-1, 6-1.

I. ! . THE CoNCORDIENSis : VOL. \¥XVIJJ. UNIOJ\T COLLEGE, J}JA 1 7 • 6, I905. THE PRESENT SITUATION IN RUSSI:A. A Russian Political Exile Speaks in Chapel. Mr. Isador Ladoff, who is publishing a series of articles in \Harper'.s Monthly\ on his exile in Siberia, lectured in chapel last Saturday evening relative to the present situation in Russia. A number of outsiders were present, together with the usual number of college n1.en. At the con- clusion of his talk, which ·was very interesting, Mr. Ladoff answered a number of questions. Asked as to the reason for his exile, he said that while writing for foreign papers shortly after graduat- ing from college, h.e was suddenly arrested and deported to Siberia without even a trial. It was there that, with the aid of standard books, he ac- quired his knowledge of the English language, in the use of which he is perfect. Mr. Ladoff began his talk by sum:rning up the early situation in Russia, before the Crimean \var. \Tyranny\ is the watchword of the government, the press is muzzled, science trodden down and free spe~ch forbidden. There are neither juries nor trials. A suspect is banished without com- punction. The peasantry are crushed; owing to the fact that two-fifths of their gross income goes to the government in taxes and much more to the provincial system they are underfed and deteriorating physically. The result is pauperism, illiteracy and semi-barbarism among nine-tenths of the total population of Russia. Mr. Ladoff next stated that the popular opinion concerning the Czar as a mighty power is erron= eous. He is a mere figure-head, and the real rul- ing class is the bureaucracy. It is for the benefit of these bureaucrats that the government is run. The peasants, Poles, Fins, Jews, etc., comprising the major part of the population had no desire for war on the· Japanese, the policy of expansion being dictated entirely by the bureaucracy. The absorption of the Asiatic provinces and the as- piratioh to acquire Manchuria was mainly to provide more \graft\ offices for relatives and friends of the bureaucrats. So corrupt is this !bureaucracy that most of the money provided for the accessories of war, for the soldiers' pay and maintenance goes into the private purses of the ofncials. Mr. Ladoff cited as a single instance of corrupt political \graft the case of the late Grand Duke Sergius, who, after collecting twenty- five million dollars to build a memorial church to his father, failed to turn over a cent when every- thing was ready to begin construction. However, the most educated and enlightened people in Russia are opposed to the bureaucrats, and are in the present crisis the best friends of the Japanese. They know that every defeat in the Far East is a blow at tyranny and for liberty at home. The educated prolectarians are hoping for the revolutionary movement which ·will oust the bureaucrats forever. The rapid spread of Socialism even among the poorest classes, the criminal tyranny of the government in massa- cring innocent persons on the streets of St. Peters- burg, the excommunication of the revered Father Gapon and numberless events of Eke character, are all hastening the time when Russian peasants shall become an educated and an enlightened peo- ple. In conclusion Mr. Ladoff said he felt that the hearts of the Am.erican people were in sympathy with the down-trodden Russian working class, and that there would be no greater rejoicing anywhere than in America when the bureaucrats were taken from Russian politics, and the real Russian peo- ple ruled a real Russia.

6 THE CONCORDIE-.VSIS. MEDIC COMMENCE:MEI\JT. Fifty--two Receive Degree at Albany. The annual commencement of the Albany Medi- cal College was held Tuesday afternoon at the Odd Fellows' Hall, Albany. In the presence ·Of a large number of relatives and friends, fifty-two members of the class of 1905 received the degree of M.D. The ceremonies started at 3 o'cloek when the graduates, wearing the academic cap and gown, entered the halL The essayist of the class was Charles William Hacker,. a resident of Albany, who read a carefully prepared paper on \Lock-- jaw.\ Later Dr. A. V. V. Raymond, as chancel- lor of the university, conferred the degrees. The Hon. Judson L. Landon of this city deliver- ed the address· to the graduating class. In open- ing he said that, while he could not agree entire- ly with Dr. Osler's theories, he must admit that it is the men under 4 0 in whose brains is inculated the epoch-making work of the world. He went on to show what a high calling the graduates had ta-ken upon themselves and the great opportuni- ties for good afforded to them.. IJn closing he ex- horted them to make universal good their object and not money alone. In the evening the annual banquet of the Al- umni Asociation was held at the Ten Eyck. Good cheer and witty speeches abounded and the eve- ning was passed most enjoyably. :Or. John H. Cotter was toastmaster. The following respond- ed: Judson S. Landon, L.L.D. and Drs. Samuel B.

At Sunday's Vesper service Dr. Towne, who was to speak on ''Physical Development a Christian Duty,\ was unable to be present and Dr. Ellery took his place, speaking on the subject of \Strength for Men.\ Dr. Ellery gathered the thought of his talk around the words \luck\ and ''pluck.\ He read as a text the first chapter of Joshua, finishing it with the remark that he wished every college man could have that chapter on strength at hand to read once a day. In part Dr. Ellery said: There is no such thing as luck. That is, there is no such thing as a cause without an effect. Any man who asks for sympathy saying his luck is against him is but suffering the effect of some former mistake in his life. Luck and pluck. Take some of the thoughts suggested by the first letters of these words: They often are the difference in the characters of the men who speak the words. P suggests patience. The kind that brings suc- cess. Some of Nature's laws work very slowly. The effect of obedience to her laws is often as long in coming as the effect of disobedience. Patience is first; the willingness to study Nature's law, second; the willingness to obey, third. lf, after learning, we do 11ot obey our. study is in va-in. P suggests perseverance. This age is one marked by rapidity in aU th~ngs and this is often unfortunate. We are apt to forget that geniuses are few. We reap at big th:ings .fo:rgetting tha:t the bulk of the world's work is ·done by the plodders. Pride is a word suggested:. Not vanity which is an emptiness, but s-elf-:r,espect which is a fun- ness. The pride which keeJ)S a man from an en- vironment where no proud man is found. Purity is the last word. We often exhibit our pride before others. Purity we exhibit when alone with ourselves. Men .should be pure for they set the standard of purity for woman, for their mothers, their sisters a:nd those they love. A man may possess all his passions and yet be pure. All these things may be brought into our lives without losing anything of good already in them. They are the things that mark the difference be- tween the man of luck and the man of pluck. SUNDAY VESPERS: \-4\. Triu1nph of Con- science.\ Suggestions f1•om Victor Hugo's \Les 1\Iiserables\-By Dr. Eilery. TUESDAY EVENING: Self Mastery.-Nutt, '06. Because of the baseball game the cabinet meet- ing was held Wednesday evening: Reports from the chairm·en of the committees showed much progress and, by the end of May, all the prepara;- tory work for the coming ·year will be completed. The reading room has been enlarged by the addi- . tion of \Munsey\ and \Life\ as the aim is to make this feature of Silliman Hall popular. Other magazines are to follow. Northfield as a place to spend part of a vacation was the subject of the Tuesday night meeting. Dr. Ellery gave some interesting facts and this year Union should be well represented. The associa- tion will help pay the expenses of those attending where needed. Two hours' university credit is given at Chi- cag·o University for services in the orchestra.

The smallest university in the world has just ~ommenced its twenty-third year of active work. This is the Ameri-can Classical University of Athens.

It is doubtless as it should be and, indeed, we. a~~i~ ,t~c;tt all things must ha~~ a~ ~nd, but, for all that, we can only look with regret upon the retirement of the old board, heralding as it does, the coming, all too soon, of the end of another college year an~ with it the departure of I 90S,. T'his is rnore of a titne for a hopeful glimpse into the future than for ren1tnts- cences. But it does not seetn u~1~~tng .~o pause but a moment for the latter. It qas been our lot to see, in this year's \Concordy\. a great improvement over former iss~~s,.· which (if we may be permitted to boast a:\' littl-e) have been by no n1:eans few in nutn- ber. For this, the college and all its friends give their heartiest thanks to the retiring board. A pace has been set which we of the new board must follow, whether or not. vVe will do our best, confidently expecting from the student body the san1e loyal support which has been accorded this year's paper. BASE BA~L. vVe were not at all over certain of winning that Wesleyan game last Saturday and, ac- cordingly, when the good news did come, it was received with so much the greater joy. It showed what the teatn is capable of doing. The none too pleasing ga1nes before were by no means a criterion of the team's stand- ard. \7\Tith such playing and especially such clean, tin1ely hitting, there seerns no reason for the loss of any other ga1nes on the sche- dule. But the tean1 still shows a dangerous tendency to slun1p, as was seen in \N\ ednes- day's gan1e. One of the best ways to keep in check this tendency to \go up\ is to shovv the 1nen that w·e are behind then1.

Yankee Ball Tossers Easy for, ·the Garnet. On Saturday last Union easily defeated Wes- leyan at Middletown by the score of 8-4. The victory was rather unexpected but the team braced up wonderfully after the week's work. The victory was due in no small measure to Hildreth's pitching, off of which Wesleyan goi but five hits. The story of the game follows: The first in- ning resulted in goose eggs for each team as did the second also for Union put Wesleyan got one man home making the score at the ·end of the sec- ond inning 1-0. Union scored 4 times in the third; Vogt, first to bat, struck out but Hildreth singled, Rider was passed and Hagar also got a gift which filled the bases. Diver drove out a long single on which Hildreth ?-Tid Rider scored. Harvey hit an easy grounder to Munroe threw wild and let Diver and Hagar score. who Wes- leyan scored twice. The fourth inning was prac- tically a repetition of the third, Hildreth, Rider and Hagar scoring. The opposing team was shut out.

THE ~CONCORDIENSIS. The 'Union University O!!arterl~ · .. The last number o:f the first volum·e of the Un- ion University Quarterly ~came out this week, con- taining a number of very interesting ahd instruc- tive artides. The leading article is by William J. Keep, '6!5 and deals with the work of Dr. Nott as an inventor. That D~r. Nott was very promi- nent in this line is showri by the recorCI.s of the United States Patent Office. \Aesculapius the Miracle- Worker,'' by Prof. Bennett ts a treat f·or all lovers of the classics and highly interesting reading for all. The following is a cure -which the author ranks high for its mir- aculousness and higher still for Us benevolence. \Heraeus .of ::Mytilene-He had no hair on the top of his head. On his chin he had e'filough and to spare. :He was ashamed of himself for its friends poked fnn at him. He slept. The God rubbed a lotion on lais head. That brought hair.\ ''Is the Civil Service an Attractive Occupation?\ is a question well discussed and answered by Hor- atio M. Pol'lock, '95, Senior Examiner of the New York State Civil Service Commission. The treatise on \Some Tendencies in Modern M·edical Education\ should be of practical value~ to many a..s Dr. Craig, '8;0 is an authority in h:i:s line. The editor ... in-chief, Dr. March, contributed in \The Character of Wordsworth, a car.eful and scholarly essay. The writer says: ''It is he (WordSW(l>rth) who first told us of, 'The vision and the faculty divine.' ~The creative sou..l,' 'Plain think·ing and high living' 'The thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears,' 'The still sad music of humanity,' And 'Tlle creature not too bright or good, For human nature's daily food.' There are the usual department articles and an excellent lot of alumni notes. The 19:0 8 baseball team went to Amsterdam yes- terday to play the HighSchool team of that place. They atended one of the High School fraternity dances .in the evening. The ~instruction comnitee of the Board of Trus- tees held a m.eeting in New York last night. ~ ,\}'·· ..,.. • ... 4 •• •,. \~'\'\ • '..,..,<>.:,.,~' , :~ .1.~ '· 0:.., ~ N~OTICE TO COLLEGE STUDENTS No doubt you are one of rnall·Y wh:o has thought of what wo:u'ld be n~eeded, to refresh the wardrobe thi~s spring and sunJ.m,er seaso11.

Trinity won easily from Union in the dual meet held at Hartford Saturday, May 6th. Our oppon- ents ied in the scoring from the start. Gateson, Bowne, Cam;pbeU, !Pond and Ohnstead did most of the scoring for Trinity; an these men showed the results of long training. Weather had favored them, their track having been in good condition since the 16th of March. In addition to this they have had \rubbers\ take care of the men after their daily practice. • The track \vas in excellent shape and conditions favorable for a m·eet with the exception of a strong wind that blew up the stretch preventing better tim.e in the hurdle and dashes. The final score was seventy-one to forty-si-x. For Union, Waldron scored 12 points and Capt. Raymond 11, Parsons, '08 ran a fine half mile and Flowers, '0 8 won the two n:1ile easily in 10.4 5, and establishing a record for Union.

The weekly lecture in the Electrical Engineer- ing course was delivered in the College Chapel Tuesday evening by Mr. W. S. Andrews of the General Electrical Works. The subject of the lecture was \Ethereal Undulations and Radio- Activity.'' The lecture was well attended and thoroughly enjoyed by all. Mr. Andrews said in part: \Scientists have· ever sought for some simple basis to which all the complex things and acts of nature might be reduced, and they now think that they have found that basis in the undulations of the ether. Everything of which man can conceive is ac- countable to waves in the ether. ''Taken in their order, beginning with waves of low velocity and great amplitude and approach- ing waves of infinite velocity and zero amplitude,

' 6: THE CONCORDIENSIS. we have heat waves, Hght waves, ultra-v:olet or tory than any pu bUshed heretofore. The state- chemical rays, the .so-caned: X-rays and finally m.en:ts for required studies are better arranged radium rays and the rays of other radio-active- a·nd all the work f'or th:Ei ·enginee~I'ing·· departm-ent materia·ls. ''It is 011ly the elements of very high atomic weight which exhibit this curious phenomenon of radio-activUy. These give off heat, Ught and energy for a seemingly unlimited length of time, without aNy apprecia:bl!e loss in weight. The theory most generally accepted regarding radio- activity, i:s that the substance having this prop- erty tends to disintegrate into a simpler sub- stance. (This substance may be lead, for no radium ore has yet been found which does not cOil tain some lead.) The process of disintegra- tion is one of throwi:ng off minute particles at velocities varying from 20,000 to 150,@00 miles per second. These mtnute projectiles coming in contact with some flourescent material produce the light seen. \Radium like many other impo1~tant things, was discovered by accident. Beckerel laid some pieces of pitch blend (which is the most import- ant ore of radium) on some photographic plates in a dark room. On developing the plates he was greatly surprised to find the pieces of pitch blend perfectly photographed on the plates. \Many of the views now held concerning rad- ium and radio activity are probably false, yet scientists hope that they are ever coming nearer the true explanation of the constituency of mat- ter.\ Mr. Andrews exhibited some samples of radium, and \vas, further, kind enough to present each of those present with a small radioscope, made by himself, which sho\VS very plainly the constant activity of radium. The lecture was one of the most interesting of the course. Don't forget the junior Hop next week. It's the last. The New ~Catalogue. The catalogue for the ensuing year appeared during the week and is fuller and more satisfac- is classed :under a separate head. Announce- ment is a1so made o.f the intention of the Faculty, acting upon the authori:ty of the Board of Trus- tees, to hold regnlar recitations on Saturday mornings. DR.SEEL YE FOR COMMENCEMENT Noted Educator to Speak. Announcement has been made that Dr. Clark Seel.ye, President of Smith College, and a graduate of Union College of the class of 18 57, is to deliver the Baccalaureate Sermon this year. The services, which \Y~H be held June 11 in the First Reformed church, will be held in conjunc- tion with the celebration of the 225th anniversary of the founding of that church, \vith which Dr. Seelye, as wen as his family, has long been con- nected. All of the indoor graduation exercises will be held in the same church. Vesper Service. Sunday's vesper service talk \vas by •Dr. Ellery, who spoke on \A Triumph of Conscience,' sug- gestions from Victor Hugo's 'Les Miserables.' \ Dr. Ellery made the subject of his talk the life of Victor Hugo's immortal character, Jean Val- jean, showing the element of conscience which was in him, from his conversion to good, support- ing him in temptation, reclaiming him after fail- ure, and at his death bed leaving the man \vho had been a brute and criminal of the lowest type, a noble and loving character. Dr. Ellery said: \We learn life's lessons in many ways but it is only in years of maturity that we are willing to learn by the experience of others. The great stories of the world teach ·what the Bible teaches. They teach from human experi- ence, bringing us the great principles of life. The teacher who opens our minds to what is best in life will lead us ultimately to the Bible. 'Les l\ 0 F t: c f f i r s a a I ( i l t

VESPER SERVICE: \Oppol~trtnli and Linl!i- tati,ons''----By Dr. \Villia1us. TUESDAY EVENING: \The attitude of scien- tific n'ten to\vards Christianity.''-~1. Ii.ing, 'Ol>, leader. The Association has received a number of cir- culars on Northfield and they may be obtained f,rorn the President. To most of us the problem. of a life work is most serious and during our college course is often be- f.ore us. Many a young man feels that he would Hke to spend his life rn Christian work though the ministry may not be possible. The Christian As- sociat~on offers a vast field for such men and as a general secretary or higher officer some of the best Christian work in the world can, and is be- ing done today. The vastness as well as gener- ally recognized value of this work can be realized when it is known that the Mikado, though a pagan, has extended a welcome and given finan- cial aid that Japan may receive the benefits of as- sociation influence. Here then, is a field with great possibilities and well worth our serious at- tention. To prepare men for it a summer train- ing school is held. Further information can be had from th~ officers of our Association. Y. M. C. A. in Other Colleges. The annual convention of the student Associa- tions of South Dakota was held at Mitchell on March 10-13. Records of attendance were broken by the presence of eighty-three visiting delegates, and by a total of about 125. Nine professors were in attendance, taking an active and inter- ested part in the proceedings. At the Sunday afternoon meeting, addressed by M·r. W. M. Par- sons, of M(inneapolis, ten men committed them- selves to the Christian life. Under the leader- ship of C. D. Hurrey, Studant Secretary of the In- ternational Comm·ittee, and other student leaders of the West, the \vork of a typical Association was thoroughly covered. During the two days some- thing over $4(:)0 was pledged to the State work. At the University of North. Dakota, Grand Forks, as a result of the Fargo conference in February, the Bible study enrollm,ent has been increased from a little over thirty to seventy. * * * * The Day of Prayer for Students was celebrated in Ro~e, Italy, by a gathering of .the students of the Methodist College, the Intei'national Institute, ar'l.td others. :Mr. Penfield, who was at the time in Rome, was one of the speakers and added to the profit of the day. A prayer meeting of univer- sity students, held at the Association building on Saturday evening, was largely a tten de d. * * * * Student delegates to the number of 13 6 from the institutions of Virginia attended the State Convention at Petersburg. Much time was given to informal student conferences, and these \vere followed by several delegation ·conferences. On the day following the convention a well-attended conference for new presidents was held. In con- nection with the Convention, a special conference for professors and members of faculties \\vas in- augurated. Seven institutions were represented, and so helpful did the conference prove that it will probably be repeated annually. * * * * Virginia Union University has a successful mis- sion-study class of fifteen. This Association has also fitted up an attractive social room with games for rainy days. * * * * The effectiveness of the Bible Study work at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute has been much increased this year by a most successful normal class of fifteen leaders under the direction of· Professor L. S. Randolph of the faculty. * * * * The Fifth International Convention of the Stu- dent Volunteer Movement will be held at Nash- ville, Tennessee, February 28 to March 4, 1906. Full information concerning the program and all the arrangements will be issued next Fall.

8 THE CONCORDIENSJS. Sigma Xi Elections. The Alpha Delta Phi fraternity entertained in- formally at the chapter house last Friday eve- ning. The following elections have been made to the Sigma Xi Society: From the Faculty-Prof. Edward Ellery, Prof. E. F. Creighton. From the Graduate Course-. T. I~. Evans.

College Briefs. At the election held in chapel last Monday morning Hill '0 7 was e'leeted over Reed '0 7 to the office of assistant football manager for the sea- son of 1905. * * * * L. H. Peebles, chairman. of the Jun:or Hop com- mittee has announced the next Hop for Friday evening, May nineteenth, at the Boat House. As this will be the last Ho:v of the year extra efforts are being made for its success. Parsons' orches- tra will furnish music. As the committee hopes for a large attendance, especially good refresh- ments are being provided. * * * * The members of the Sigma Phi Society are no\v living in their new home on the hi'll. * * * * The Senior-Junior baseball game scheduled last Tuesday was not pl~,yed on account of the cold weather. The next game is down for Tuesday, between 1905 and 1907. * '* * * Monday has been named by the Senior class as \Moving-up-Day.\ Caps and gowns wHl be donned on that day. * '* * * The game scheduled for May 27 with Boston University has been cancelled by that institution. In all probability a garne will be played here with R.. P. I. if satisfactory arrangements can be made. The rest of the schedule remains as :first published. * * * * At the meeting of the instruction ·committee of the Board of Trustees, held in New York last Fri- day night, a number of important questions were brought into such form as to be laid before the trustees in June. * * * * Among visitors on the hill Sunday were Weed '01, and Watson, Irish, Craig, Stiles and Green- man, all of 1904. * * * * Arnold G. Chapman '0 6 and Milton K. Huppuch '08, left Tuesday for Bethlehem, Pa., wheire they will attend the Psi Upsilon Convention now in session at Lehigh University. * * * * Barnes '06, has again returned to his college duties after a severe illness at his home in Clyde, N.Y. * * * * In a late number of the Green Bag, a law pub- lication, Dean Fiero of the Law School, has an interest1ng article on \The Applicability of Eng- lish Methods to Conditions in the United States.\ Don't forget the Junior Hop next week. It's the last. Dramatists of. Today. Dr. Hale has compiled a number of essays from the Boston Dial on Rostand, Hauptmann, Sudermann, Pinero, Shaw, Phillips and Maeter- linck in a volume entitled \Dramatists of Today.\ The following criticism is an extract from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle of J\iay 6, 19 05: Mr. Hale is a modest and sensible, as well as an acute and sound critic. Instead of tying him- self to some incomprehensible ''principles\ of crit- icism, incomprehensibly pronounced by some im- practicable persons named, maybe, Peter, Ruskin, France, Hazlitt, Jones, Brown and Robinson, he reassumes the old fundamental principle: \I

THE CONC.RO:DIE!fSIS. 9 don't pretend to know anything about critic:sm, but I know what I like,\ and he dilutes thts in- dividua!L standard with the equally sensible as- sumption that there is in the drama something a tittle more than what we ''Uke''-namely, the comparative didactic impression left upon our in- dividualism by the presentment of some new form of expedeirlee. While a book or play may not am use y0u, and is therefore rot, it may still in- fluence you by suggesting new experiences which do not happen to have presented themse~lves to you in person. That is all a book or a play amount to;. the description of an experience. ~o single person is in the way of experiencing every- thing, and the lack must be made up by borrow- ing experiences elsewhere. It is experiences that result in the formulation of principles. In this way every new experience thrust u:pon you, whether it amuses you or not, tends to have a fonnative effect on. yourself and through you on society. \Before one can lay down the law as to how one .ought to feel about the drama,\ says Mr. Hale, ''it is but reasonable to try and find out how one really does feel.\ With this candid mind, Mr. Hale proceeds tD analyze the plays of certain foreigners from his own point of vie\\v without worrying himself vvhat the Paris Figaro or the Masquee of Beloochistan happen to have said on the subject. And that is all \\Ve care to ask of any critic-\vhat he tl)inks about it himself. We shall not, or ought not, to agree with him, because every one's point of view ought to be different from every one else's; but f.or that very reason, the narrowness of our individual points of view, ·we. need, and we find amusem,ent in getting, the opinions of people different to our- selves, provided always they are people whom we can respect, people whose heads are not swell- ed out of proper proportion, and people who are capable of having an opinion of their own. The majority of so-called well known critics do not be- long to the latter category, being quoters and im- beciles. Don't forget the Junior Hop next week. It's the ~ast. · ALUMNI.

Publication Office, SCHENECTADY GAZETTE. \ Last Monday morning in chapel meeting the attention of the student body was called to an occurance which was, of itself~ most deplorable but which was rendered doubilly so by the fact that never before has such a thing been knovvn to happen here. It seems that the Hamilton tearn dressed in the gym for last Saturday's game. Part of the men turned their money and other valuables over to the tnanager but several thought that it \vonld be perfectly safe to leave everything in their suit cases. When they returned to dress after the game they discovered that their suit cases had been rifled and neariy everything of any value taken. '\fhe tnoney loses were made good to the n1en by our management and what the men lost in watches and jewelry will also be n1ade good. But that cannot wipe out the memory of the affair. No possible suspicion can attach it- self to any of the men in college, but that fact can in no wise alleviate our feelings. It is the firm opinion of the student body that no such thing could have happened if adequate police service were given the col- lege. We do not mean to say that it would not have happened if there had been police on the campus for police there were-all en- joying the ball game. What we do mean to say is this: For two years and more, a \cop\ has been a rare and wonderful sight on our campus. In this titne the \kids\ have been getting more a-nd more brazen. At the present time we are allowed to use the campus merely as an act of courtesy by the youngsters of the neighborhood. They have found that they may wander about uncheck- ed and this latest depredation comes as a re- sult of their growing knowledge of the lay of the land. We understood, when \Jim the Copper\ took his departure,- that we would enjoy the police service of the city. We do only \\vhen there is some game in progress. Why can- not we have the same at all times? As a last resort, it has been suggested that the

THE CONCORDJEN.SIS. · II _____ ...-...:.:.J student body hire a special policetnan, to keep the campus clear of objectionable char- acters. We think this schetn-e deserves con- sideration. Saturday last could scarcely be called a day of unmixed de~ight, but stili we have . reason to he pretty well satisfied with our- selves. We not only defeated Hamilton in baseball for the fourth consecutive time but administered the worst defeat of the four. The tea1n continued its good work, showing the best form yet seen on the ho1ne grounds. 1'he batting was a revelation, even to those of us who have watched the team develop. Nor are we any the less satisfied with the work of the track team. The men fought nobly against odds. It is no disgrace to be beaten by better men. Now all is preparation for the meet with Rochester. Let us give the tea~m all possi- ble support, for there is a good chance of winning that meet, as our tearp is much bet- ter than last year's. The last Junior Hop of the year cotnes next Friday night. The committee has given an excellent series of hops this year, but this promises to he the best of all. The fellows should attend well to tnake it as suc- cessful as the others have been. The advisory cotnmittee on athletics of Trinity College at a meeting held at Hart- ford Thursday, May 4, discovered that the track meet with Union last year was unfair- ly won by Trinity because of a man on the Trinity team who was not in college. A representative was at once sent to Schenec- tady who personally on behalf of the com- mittee apologized for the affair, stating that it had just been brought to their notice. He further stated that the banner would be returned to 1J nion and the meet stricken en- tirely from the Trinity records~ We recognize and appreciate the honor- able course taken by the advisory con1tnit- tee. M ;_ . l. • ., '''C · F . '' · ICing an s · · ounty a1r. On May 5 and 6 the students of Michigan Uni- versity held their triennial County Fair and it proved to be an immense slil.ccess, over $4,:000 be- ing cleared for the benefit of the University Union. This Union is corrrposed of students, alumni, mem- bers of the several faculties and the board of re- gents and has for its object the advance1nent of the interests of the entire university body. The proceeds of the fair are to be devoted to the building fund of a large club house. The fair was hetd in the large double gymnasium and con- sist·ed of everything from a pa-\vn shop to a beauty show. There were continuous vaudeville, side shows, an Indian village, a German garden and an animal show. Along the midway were gam- ing devices of all kinds, fortune tellers, ballets and mysteries of every conceivable nature. Be- fore the show began there was a long parade through the streets of Ann Arbor, which afforded interest and amusement to the crowds that had assembled from the nearby cities. The show \vas arranged and carried out by students of the uni- versity alone and never before was such enthu- siasm shown in any other undertaking. The of- ficers and members of the Michigan Union surely have just cause for being satisfied with their ef- forts, for they succeeded in arousing the keenest interest and good fellowship among the students of every department of that great university.

12 THE CO!lCORDlENSIS. ===============================================================---~·==================== HA·M~L TON DEFEATE:D. Union Wins Fourth Victory. A game which savored more of the practice variety than of the intercollegiate was pilayed last :Saturday on the campU:s against Hamilton and resulted in a victory for Union by a score of 12-3. Hamilton's main trouble lay in the miserable work of her outfield and pitching staff, eight runs being scored in the first inning. Union played a consistent though not brilliant game and was only charged with two errors. Hil- dreth pitched. a very good gam·e, striking out five men. Sherman, Hamilton's much heralded fresh- man pitcher, was batted out of the box before the end of the first inning and his successor, Havens, fared but little better. The game showed Union's great improvement in batting. Some excellent bunting and sacrifice hitting was also seen. The runs came rather in bunches. Hamilton scored twice in the third and once m:ore in the sixth, while Union scored eight in the first, three in the third and one in the sev- enth. For Hamilton, Haggerson lead at the bat, get- ting three of the hits made by his side. Havens fielded his position well taking six out of seven chances. All of Union's men batted well. Diver held down third well, accepting six chances with-~ out an error, while Davis took a like number at short. Mulrooney, \\Vhile he suffered an unfor- tunate accident made the star catch of the game. While trying for the ball he collided with Hagar. He fell hard but hung on to the ball. It was later :round that a piece had been chipped from his shoulder bone. The score: UNION. A.B. R.

Rochester Added to the List. · \iVednesday afternoon we defeated. Rochester by one run after a closely arid loosely played con- test. Rochester found Hlildreth at once and secured several good hits before we made con- nections with Hart at all. Taggart made a three bagger ii1 the first and scored on Sull ivari's single. We failed to score until the third but then three rui1s came· in on Richard's home run. The eighth was our lucky inning and won the game for us. Rochester did some heavy hitti11g and had a fast infield which gave their battery excellent support until the sixth when it weakened noticeably.

THE OO~VCORDIEl\fSJS our boys were slower but played a more careful game as the error column wHl show. Taggart's hit in the ~.rst, Richard's home run and Harvey's scoring on Colburn's bunt by means of a' 'squeeze piliay'' were the features .of the game. Hildreth, though hit hard, pitched a consistent game and had seven strike outs to his credit. AU our 'boys :seemed to be in good . trim and showed plainly the effects of the past few weeks careful training and offered quite a contrast to the Rochester men before the game was finished. Our batting in general too was much of an improvement over the other games on the ca·rnpus this S'eason. No better example of the use of combined yell- ROCHESTER. A.B. R ..

THE CONCORDIENSIS. Middlebury Today. A good game is promised today when M:tddle- bury comes to meet Union on the campus. Mid- dlebury has made a good record. thus far while Union has experienced only two defeats and that was before the team was in proper playing condi• tion. The team will try particularly hard to wipe out the defeat sustained at the hands of the Ver,mont- ers last spring, although that was due more to our own misfortune than to their strength. M:ahar was injured during the game and the team was in a demoralized condition. We should win rather easily after the showing made in last Saturday's game. The line-up: Hildreth, short stop. Rider, left field. H'agar, center field. Diver, third base. Harvey, second base. Richards, right field. Colburn, left field. Vogt, catcher. Davis, pitcher. FRESHMEN WIN TOO. 1908 Defeats Amsterdam High. On Friday, May 5th, the Freshman team played its first game of the season at Amsterdam. Though the game, which lasted for five innings, was play- ed in the ra:n, the team showed up exceptionally well. Curtin pitched a strong game, striking out seven n1.en and allowing but one hit. Consider- ing the condition of the grounds and weather, the work of the infield and outfield was good as the few trys which they received were handled easily and quickly. The batting was somewhat behind the other work of the team, but the few hits which were made were well bunched, thus al- lowing the freshmen to make three tallies.

UNION SQUARE, NEW YORK TENNIS WITH HAMIL TON. A New Enterprise in Athletics. On May 24th Union ·will meet Hamilton for the first time in a tennis match. Last year, it will be remembered, a match was arranged to be played in Clinton, but weather prevented and the match was called off. This year Hamilton will bring a team of four men to Schenectady and every- thing possible will be done to make the event in- teresting. Six men only have entered their names for the trials which should be completed before the end of this week. These men are E. King, '05, vV. L. Brooks '06, M. R. Vincent '08, F. S. Ray1nond '08, P. S.
