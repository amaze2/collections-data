When y6U: begin to study about the missions of Syria, plea.se bring your geographies with you; open them to the map of Syria and Palestine; find Dam2scus, then look on the seacoast oppo- site and :fi.nd a city na.med Beirut or Beyrouth. Stop there, for you have arrived at the present metropolis of Syria. It is a .city of about 120,000 inhabitants, has the only really good harbor on the Syrian coast, a fine water supply furnished by an English company, gas works, a pretty good European market and rather a large element of European citizens. This is the only port of entry for this portion of the country and therefore is a great trading centre. Back in. the second and third centuries Beirut was noted as a seat of learning. It had one of the most noted law schools of the world and for years it flourished. To-day also it is the centre of education for the levant. There are twelve or fifteen institutions of higher learning in it con- ducted by almost as many different religious denomina t:ions. The two most prominent of these are first, the University of St. Joseph, under the di- rection of the Jesuit order. It has a department of arts, department of pharmacy, and a department of medicine. It has some six or seven hundred students. Also there is the Syrian Protestant Col- lege, with which I am connected. If you were coming to Beirut, as I sincerely hope each of you will soon.er or later, your steamer would p~ss around a high promontory, then skirting along the shore, you would notice a row of fourteen fine stone, tile-roofed buildings crowning tll.eir promon- tory, so near that you could almost call to the people on the .shore. This promontory is the campus, and these buildings constitute the home of the :Syrian Protestant College. The campus contains about fifty acres. On it are the buildings of the Preparato:ry Department, .School of Com- merce, Collegiate Department, Schools of Phar- macy and Me~dicine, and a good athletic field. There is also an Observatory modeled exactly after the Dudley Observatory of Albany. So in this you see the Syrian Protestant Col:lege has a touch with Union University. But there is something more than a touch, there is also a vital connection. A number of Union men have been concerned in the growth of the ·college. There is Rev. John Crawford, D. D., '47, who, for over fifty years has been a missionary in Damascus, and Vice-Presi- dent of the Board o.f Managers 1or the college. There is Dr. Ira Harris of the A!l\bany Medical, '80, I think, missionary in the city of 'Tripoli just north of us, also a member of the Board of Managers. Joseph Afternus, ·~n, was for several years a teacher in the college and has written an Arabic grammar which is in quite universal use. Dann L. Wood, '97, was an instructor here for three years, and myself '96, taught here for three years after graduating and then returned to America for a theological course after which I returned to the work here as Principal of the Preparatory Dept. Just a word about the organization and equip- ment of the college and then I wish to tell a little of the students and the aims of the institution. About the year 1862 the mJssionaries of the American Board located in Syria decided that an institution for higher learning was needed. They accordingly set as·ide one of their number, Rev. Daniel Bliss, to organize that worlr., making it in- dependent of the Mission Board if it were possible to raise proper endowment. Dr. Bliss was suc- cessful, both in America and Eng:land, in interest- ing men of means in the enterprise. So the col- lege was incorporated in 186 3 under the laws of the State of New York and was .granted a charter by the Regents of the University of New York. The college was organized with its own Board of Trustees composed of business men of New York

In the opening years of the college Arabic was the language of instruction. But later, owitl.g to the dUficulty of obtaining proper text books in Arabic, and owing to the fact that 1nany non.- Arabic-speaking students desired to attend the college, it was decided to employ some European language as the medium -of instruction. Of course English was the most natural language to em- ploy. So now all the work of the college is in English except the course in Arabic language and literature. The student body is made up of all sorts and conditions. There are half a dozen different nation- alities, and there are as many different religions. I mention the classes of religion because in this part of the world every one must have a religion. He is classed in the government lists by his re- ligion and his only representative before the gov- ernment is the head of his religion. A man with- out a religion would be practically an outlaw. The result is of course very apparent that the churches are loaded with all sorts of characters whose lives do not begin to approach the teach- ings of the religion. The college this year has registered 7 50 students, in all departments .. There are Syrians, Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, English, Australians, Turks. Their religions are all shades of Oriental Chris- tian sects, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Ro- man Catholic, Copt, Old Syriac, Protestant. There are Moslems, Druses and Jews. They have come for all sorts of purposes. Some because sent by their fathers, a number who wish to remain a short time to learn English, othe1·s because of the general educational advantages. But whatever their reason for coming, here they all are. What shall we do with them? As the college teaches only in English the first thing for them is to learn English. Therefore they must -enter the Preparatory Dept. until sufficiently pro- ficient in language. Those who have been edu- cated elsewhere are often able in two years to enter the college or scientific department while ~others who enter younger have to spend the full fiv-e years :i:n :preparin:g, f:or they have not only to leaFn a langfuage but ,t0 become educated as well. Of course this throws a large number of students into the P:r€paratory, :this year 420. They come from all kin <is of homes and schools, bigoted relig- iously, full Qf family pride, false ideas and ide?-ls of ed:u.ca:H,@n, the dec~itful, as weU as the well- trained arul obedient. We exa:ndn e them, ~c:lass,ify them as best we can and begin the process 0f manhood, Christian man- hood mal:\Jng. They must all take the same studies, regardless of reUgion, of age, of previous education_ They must aB study English, Mathe- matics, G €o.graphy, Sc1ence, Bible. The aim 0:f the co[l ege, negatively expressed, is not to make them Anericans but rather to have them Syr'ia.ns or Egyptians or Greeks with the best that A.rnerican elll.ergy, thoughtfulness, man- hood can_ give them. Religiously expressed the college does not aim 'to make the students protes- tants, but in. the best and broadest sense Chris- tians. StU:dents may enter Jews or Moslems or what-nots and remain the same throughout their course and never eve 11 have a word said to them about changing thei:r religion. But no student can pass through th:.e college without having a knowledge of the Biole, its central facts and its central tea.chings. N\or can he be here one year without llav-ing care:fully explained the meaning of the spirit of Christ~ in its broadest, best, and most savjEtg sense. It is not the policy of the col- lege to fi:B.d all that is bad in other religions and then to present how good ours is, but it is to find all that i~ good and t:rue, and there is a great deal, in every re'ligion, rec:ognize the truth wherever it is found, give proper credit for it, and then to show, both by precept and example, how much more true ~is religion as presented by the life and teachings 0f Jesus Christ. The college is missionary in its aim, in its man- agement, in its spirit, and in all its purposes. As a truly Christian institution it aims to give a thor- ough, scientific education, along broad and ad- vanced lines. It aim.s to teach its students to think, a11d thinking,. to live in the abund- ance of Rfe that the Master of life came to bring. . ' ., ';t .,. ' ' ' l : l ! . ·: . t! .:

Th.e time of crea- Uon was divided into six days; the periods of Geology were six. 'Let there be light' was not that setting in motion of the forces of the uni- verse.

Science tells us that we inherit char- up with the idea that we were to use our intel- lectual powers along any other line but that of religion. To a certain extent this was right. It is a moral and physical law that in early life we received all from the_ hands of our parents, but the time comes when we 1nust leave this susten- ance and strive for ourselves. In the same way the time comes when a man must face his relig- ious difficulties. We -have to eat again our early religious food and assimilate it for ourselves. We have developed to the point whe-re we must think and when we think we question or doubt. acteristics and tendencies which lead us to sin. I do not believe in God because of the Bible but in the Bible because of God. Every unbeliever, sceptic, athiest or whatever he may call himself must believe in himself-a being, rational, capa- ble of loving. Just so is God a being, rational, capable of loving, an intelligent 1naster of all.

The mid-winter ~vening air was crisp and chill and the snow left in little patches on the pave- ments crunched under foot with a cold frosty sound.

This nightly journey. I was brought up with religious training in a religious family and when I went to college the study of Geology brought to me my first doubts. The science clashed with the words of the Bible and my doubts began with the story of the crea- ti-on of the first day. From then on doubts piled went on until the world about me did not seem a reality when one day the thoUght came that I who doubt, am something-that is the truth; if there is a religion it is founded upon truth. I shut up When one is young and in the fullness of strength and health, such a night sets the blood in rebellion against the cold and this rebellion shows itself in the qui-ckened stride and th~ deep-

I think I must have flushed a lit- . tle, though my eyes were looking straight into hers, and as she turned away I saw the red creep up until it met the brow11, of her hair., I opened the door for her when she passed out and just as she reached the pavement she slipped a little and putting out her hand to save herself she touched me.

This is done by setting aside garden plots for their use and offering prizes for the best results.\ Dr. Tolman had an .abundant supply of fine Dr. 'Tolman then described a mode:l vifl:tge called Port Sunlight, in England, \whicih has been lantern slides, illustrating all the parts of his lee- ture.

He graduated from Union in 1862 and was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi and Phi Beta Kappa fra- ternities. At the breaking out of the Civil War he enlisted in the One Hundred and Forty-sixth New York Volunters as captain and was breveted major upon his retirement at the close of the war. tutes, parks, a museum and an open air theatre. Restaurants are run in a clean and wholesome manner at very low cost, and everything is as near perfect as the hand of man can make it. The effect of the town on the people is a work- ing example of the fact that infinitely more can be done for the w~rkingman in this way than by any amount of legislation. Dr. Tolman then spoke of another great branch of work which is being done abroad. That is, the establishment of \Museums of Securities,\ where all manner of safety devices a.re invented and exhibited free to the public and especially to manufacturers, who are urged to copy them and 11 use them in their factories. As examples· of. empl-oyers in this country who have done much to help their emptoyes, Dr. Tol- man spoke of the H. J. Heintz Co., and the Na- tional Cash Register Co., both of which have done everything to make their employes as com- fortable as pos_sible during working hours and to surround them with good influences when they are out of the ractory. \The Institute for Social Service accomplishes its work,\ said Dr. Tolman, \with the aid of what are known as !social secretaries' and 'social en- gineers,' who work in the large factories for the betterment of ~conditions and suggest changes which would help to make things better. Maj. Wright came to St. Paul in 1866 and taught at the Washington school where he after- ward became principal. He was principal of the Central High School several years and served as superintendent of schools for eight years, retiring in 1889. He was for many years a member of the board of education, was one of the founders of the St. Paul public library and was the secre- tary of the board at the time of his death. He was a member of the Loyal Legion, of Acker Post, G. A. R., and Damascus Commandery of the I~nights Templar. He was for many years state agent for the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Com- pany. He leaves a wido'VV, Mrs. Flora vVright, and three sons and three daughters, Mrs. W. H. Garnham, the Misses Dorothy and Mary Wright, Taylor Wright, Benjamin F.

Fur- thermore, the number of freshmen coming out :is unusually large and he is hoping that among them there will be several who wiH develope into good pitchers. Dr. Towne gave his opinion as follows: \All the old men except M:ahar will be baok and this, together with the fact that so many freshmen are out, insures us a strong team. vVe have begun regular daily work in the gym and the men will soon be in good condition to go out oil. the field.

THE :VOL. L¥XVI!l. UiVJQ}\1 COLLEGE, J[.L~l R. i I, I905. Building ·Sacrifices in Modern Greece. If you travel in Greece, footback, muleback, wheelback, horseback or by rail, you must expect to be catechized, for the Greek of today, like the Athenian of Saint Paul's tilne, is ever eager to hear son1.e new thing. \Where are you from?\ and \where are you going?\ are the first ques- tions, and surely these openings offer more prOln- ise of talk than \It's a fine day.\ Traveling by Tail once from Pyrgos to Tripolitza, I fell in, as asual, with friendly inquisitors. A ·white bearded old .fellow in fe; and splendid, T fuspanella began the catechis1n. ''\Vhere are you from?\ \~-\rnerica.\ \It's a great countl~y,\ he said. ''You have the light there. The light was here oncP but it has gone out.'' Ho\vever, the light hasn't altogether gone out in Greece yet, nor ever ·will so long as one stone of 8 ny te1nple is standing· on another. Further- n1ore, the old life, light and dark, is by no means extinct. Indeed the traveller in Greece, if he cares to observe such matters, \Vill find son1e the old G·reek :for \It's a w~et day;\ \God rains\ is the modern. Of the pagau rites that survive in the Greek Church, the iflou ndation sacrifices are especially interesting. 'Tlw oughou t Greece, even in Athens, ·when the corn.er-stone .ef a buUding· is laid, a sacrificial rite is commonTy performed by a priest of the chul'ch. Tne victim. (usually a cock or a lamb) is slain and.. its blood is allowed to drip on the corner-stGnJ:e.. Inst€ad of the sacrifice of a living victim, there 1nay,, however, be a sym- bolic sacrifice. The m .. easure of a man may be taken secretly \vith .a tape or cord and the tape or cord buried under the corner-stone; or else the stone is la i~l in the shadow of a h un1an being. A person whose sh.ado\r is thus caught will die \vithin a year,-perhaps; at any rate the Greeks think that he \viii and they mind their shadows well when th .. ere is a sacd,fice forward. Be it noted that hoth these sy:m 1Joli c sacrifices are human sacri.fices. ::\ O\V anyb0 dy-, seeing these sacrifices or hear- ing of the1n, W(}Uld be sHre that they \\Vere both nnch:·nt and paga.n. So, in fact. they are. Sim- very interesting n1.en1orials of ancient Greece,- i.lar ~acr.i:fice:-1 .( ulsually of ln .. H11an beings) suiYive perhaps the most interesting ones of all-in the in India. in China and a.n1ong some of the savage Greece and Greeks of today. Often he \Vill see faces that re1nind him of the \Yell marked type portrayed in Greek statutes. He will find that when Greek 1neeks Greek he still speaks Greek and that there ensues forthwith a dialectic en- counter that may aptly he called a tug-of-war. He \\'ill find old legends, old customs, old super- stitions, old rites. In the Greek church, in particular, are 1nany survivals of pagan superstitions and rites, and even of pagan deities. Some of the saints are baptized gods. Even Bacchus has been canon- ized. The healing rites of the God Aesculapius, are perpetuated with striking fidelity under the :patronag·e of various saints. \Ze}\us rains\ was tribes of Africa. ancl sirnilal' hun1an sacrifices were somt'tiB.l.es offered in ancient Greece to in- sure the stability of stn.Jctures. It ap})ears, iurthermo1·e, that hu1nan victilns have been offered at building· sacrifices in Greece even in n•cent Un,.es. ~~rnong the folk poems of the 1noclern Greeks is one entitled \The Bridge t of Arja.\ 'rl'lis poe-In tells how a n1.aster-mason and his men faihd/to huilcl a bridge. They car- 1 /b~ ~,4 ried it up a 1 ittle \.-Yay, but after that they worked to no purpose. 'VVhat they built each day would fall at night. Finally the spirit of the bridge spoke out from. the ruin .. s and told the master- mason that l:le could not make the bridge stand save by saerHiciTlg his wife. ..And so the master

6 THE CONCOR\DfE}V:SIS. --- sent for her. \¥hen she came he told her that he had lost his ring down among the stones and that nobody could find it. He asked her to look for it and, like a dutiful \Yife, she obeyed. But as soon as she began her search the m€'11. hurled rocks upon her and buried her under the1n. Then they built up the bridge and !it s~ood. This story of the bridge of ArJ>a is clearly a tradition of human sacrifice. Furthermore, the belief n the virtue of such sacrifices is still cur- rent in some parts of Greece.

Ellenwood was taken ill and cotnpelled to give up his college \vork. Ever since he has been confined at his hotne in Dannen1ora and does not ex- pect to return to college before . .:\pril.

In1n1ediately thereafter the Board elected l\Iorris T. Ray- n1ond, Editor-in-Chief. 1\Ir. Raytnond has had direction of the paper during l\Ir. Ellen- wood's illness and assnn1es the position as Editor-in-Chief, having been guaranteed the active and earnest support each \veek of everv n1e1nber of the Board. It '\vas fur- .- ' ther voted that the Board 1neet regulariy ~Ionday evenings to outline the work for the week and thus effect better co-opera- tion.

On Friday evening, March 3d, the college quartette, Kline, '0 8, Richardson, '07, Reed, '06 and Spier, '07, attended an informal banquet of the Union University Alumni association of :\orthern :\ew York, at the University Club in Albany. The evening \Vas spent in singing col- lege songs and listening to college rerniniscences. The Knickerbocker Quartette, of \vhich Robert M. Eames, '9 9, is a member sho·wed by their rendering of some of the more difficult pieces, a finish which comes only from plenty of practice together; and the two quartettes bunched up around the piano and sang the old songs with a vim. After the banquet, Verro, a presdigitateur of wide reputation, mystified his audience for an hour or so; and accomplished h,is tricks with the keen eyes of coHege alumn.i within. four feet .of him. Th:e Union quartette, as is usua:Hy the case with college boys, did their best work during the banquet. Among the Union atu.mni who attended were A. H. Mills, '7 2,. J. M. Bailey, '61, J. Xewton. Fiero, Dr. M. G. Plank, Fred W. Cam!eron, '81, E. W. Blessing, '88, P. S. Dorion, '89, C. B. MacMurray, '87, Frank Coo:per, '93, Xicholas J. Veeder, '~4. H. A. VanAlstyne, '93, W. S. McEwen, '95, J. X. Vanderveer, '99, M. L Bender, '00, and MHton Russum, '02. Base Ball Practice. It has been the usual custom for Union. base- ball 1nen to don flannel shirts and hie themselves to the gym. for light practice \vith the advent of the first blue- bird or robin. This practic€ con.- siste<.l in fooling with a ball for an hour or so, and ending up with a short run. But the truth of the expression\ what a. great fire a little spa·rk kindleth'' was never so evident as now in the history of athletics of Unio11. The reason is the rejuvenated gym. Good light, plenty of warmth and room 1nake it a pleasure instead of labor to exercise in it. Practice this sea~:;on is being conducted on a different plan than heretofore. In the first place there are two coaches. Mr. Cunningha1n, Instructor in Mathe- rnatics, and a graduate of Lafayette, is hea..d coach and Dr. Towne, assistant. The men are put through a regular course of gymnastic train- ing· every day and finish their practice with a run. The squad has been out about a week now and 3 6 men report ev.ery day. This n~eans a good Rcrub, the value of which was sufficiently demon.- strated last fall during the successful football Reason. It will be seen from the following list of names that nearly every position is being con- tested for hotly. Candidates for catche are: Harvey, '07; Jewell, '08, and Colburn, '08.

Will be Held in Armory March 1 5. For the greater part of the winter preparations have been made for the annual indoor interclass athletic meet. This is to take place Wednesday evening, March 15th in the State armory. Ow- ing to the increased interest in track athletics in college due to winning the relay race with R. P. I. this meet should prove very successful. As usual a good number of Freshmen have entered, some of -whom have so far shown up well in practice. The price of admission ·will be twenty- strengthened materially and from the showing of five cents and the tickets are now on sale by the the Freshmen candidates \Ve can can expect at management. outfield. The pitching department can be least three good men. Practice hasn't developed the abilities of the ne\Y candidates sufficiently to judge thein accurately yet. A lot is expected of Freshmen, especially if they corne well recom- rr.~ended and there is no lack of references this year.

(Dedicated to the heads of the Language De- partments.} In te1npus old a hero lived, Qui loved puellas deux; He ne pouvait pas quite to· sa31 vVhich one amabat mieux. Dit-il-lui-meme, un beau matin, \X on possum both a voir Sed si address Amando Ann, Et both sunt very agathae Et quite form.m:;ae girls. Entin the youthful Anthropos, Philoun the duo maids, Resolved prepondere ad Kate Devant cet evenings shades. Procedens then to Kate's domo. II trouve Amanda there. Kai quite forgot his late resolves, Both sunt so goodly fair. Sed smiling on the new tapis, Between puellas twain, Coepit to tell his flame to Kate Dans un poetique strain. Mais, glancing ever et anon At fair Amanda's eyes, Illae non possunt dicere Pro which he meant his sighs. Each virgo heard the demie vow, With cheeks so rouge as wine. And off'ring each a milk white :hand, Both whispered, \Ich bin dein.'' H. E. C. BASKETBALL Basketball, aJthough not a !recognized form of athletics, has been taken up to quite an extent l1y the ci:asses this year, and Doc. Towne is the o.ne to whom aU honor is due for being the chief factor in arousing enthusiasm. There is some excellent material in the Freshman class, and the1·e is no doubt in the world but that Union could have turned out an excellent team had the college officials recognized this form of ath- letics. The interclass games have been going right on however, and will continue to do so un- til the season is over. Mr. Pond has become generous and has ordered two new baskets ·with screens. The gam,e will be more interesting when the baskets and screens are put up. So}Jhomores 14-Senioi·s 13.

\ . ! THE CoNcoRDIENsrs '· UN!Oi\1 COLLEGE, .JI.A !?.. 18, 1905. \The Steam Turbine. . on Tuesday last Mr. 0. Jungren of the Gen- eral :E:lectric Company lectured in the chapel on the ''Underlying Principles of the Steam Tur- bine.'' He said in part: • 'Lately many varieties of turbine have been p,eoposed but only three are used extensively. These are the Parsons, De Laval and Curtis types. \The Parsons turbine consists, elementarily, of a hollow revolving drum, bearing rows of buck- ets; and a hollow casing bearing stationary buckets curved in opposite direction to those en the revolving drum. The dia1neter of the (1ru1n increases from the inlet to the exhaust in <:Jrder to accommodate the constantly expanding steam. The turbine is always made horizon- tally and the end thrust is balanced by pistons of the same diameter as the different sections of the drums. \The De Laval turbine consists of a single \vheel (of small size) which is made to revolve by steam forced (from a nozzle set at an angle to the ·wheel) into buckets in the revolving wheel. This turbine is little used because the discharge of steam. fro1n a nozzle gives only 58 per cent. of the original pressure of the steam. \As the velocity of the steam is very great, and consequently the velocity of the turbine, great trouble has been experienced in governing the De Laval turbine. One of- the novel features of the De Laval turbine is the flexible 1nain shaft, \\Yhich is n1ade small enough to bend and over- come the dangerous vibrations caused by the high speed. Tl1e Curtis Turbine. into two or more separate turbines (acting on the same shaft) develophlg equal a·mounts of \VOrk. \The turbine is mad:e vertical and has, be-- tween each two sets ·Of revolving buckets, a set of stationary buckets to reverse the direction of the stea1n. \At the first glance it would seem that the principles involved in the Parsons and Curtis turbines are the sa1ne. They are not, ho\vever, for in the latter there is no pressure difference between the buckets, while in the former there is. \Leakage is quite an important item in the constructi_on of steam turbines, especially as the high speed involved requires large clearance. \The velocity of the stea1n is greatly reduced in passing through the turbine, and for this reason the angles of the buckets in the last set are much larger than those in the first. The initial velocity and direction of the steam 1nay be combined graphically with the velocity of the turbine to find the resultant velocity of the stean1.. \'The larger turbines of the Curtis type are constructed with four stages, the reduction in steam pressure beging as follows:-1()8 lb. (ab- solute) to 58 lb., 58 lb. to 18 lb., 18 lb. to 5 lb., 5 lb. to 1 lb. The fact that the same velocity is produced by a change from 5 lb. to 1 lb. as by a change from 168 lb. to 58 lb. shows the advan- tage of a low entrance pressure. \In order to overcome the difficulties ex- perienced in the two former turbines, Curtis in- vented a machine to take the work from the steam in stages. That is, the turbine is divided \The Curtis turbine made by the G. E. Com- pany, from 50 0 horse power up, is always con- structed vertically, for simplicity and for saving in floor space. The weight of the \vhole re- volving n1echanism thus comes on one bearing, and this must, consequently, be a good one. It has been found that the best bearing can be pro- duced by actually floating the revolving portion on a very thin film of oil or ·water. The pressure of this film of lubricant is kept just high enoug\h

-, I :I T ' 6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ------------_c-.:..:_-_-:-::-----=--- to separate the revolving and stationary disks a very small fraction of an inch. The result is an aln1ost frictionless bearing which will carry a practically limitless weight. In the 7 500 horse power tu1·hine the revolving portion we1ghts 80 tons and. the friction at the bearing is so s1nall that a m.an can turn it around ·with ease. \The governing of the entrance of steam· to the turbine has been accomplished by many methods. In the Curtis turbine it is controlled by a large num.ber of valves (all under control of a governor) which produces the maximu1n efficiency at the least expenditure of steam, for a variable load. \Ton :pressure turbines are now being con- structed and used in some quantities and are gaining in popularity. ''Turbines in general have the follo\ving ad- vantages over the reciprocating engine. They can use steam at either higher or lower pressure, are cheaper to build, require less space, less at- tention, smalle.r foundations and less internal lubrication. \Turbines are being used extensively not only for generators but for marine propulsion, large fans, centrifugal pumps, and other m.achines which can utilize high speed.\ THE CLASSICS AND MODERN TRAINING. A New Book by Prof. Ashmore. Prof. Sidney G. Ashmore, of the department of Latin Language and Literature has just pub- lished a series of addresses suggestive of the value of classical studies to education under the title \The Classics and Modern Training.\ The author in his preface states that \this series of addresses is published in the hope of interesting the general reader in a few matters connected with the study of Greek and Latin, and if possi- ble to call attention to the value of the ancient languages and literatures to education.\ Prof. Ashmore composed these addresses independent- ly and in different years and has combined them in book form since each of them has behind it a purpose similar to that of the rest. The ad- dresses that constitute the book are: I. A Plea for the Classics in Our Schoo11s, with Particular R·eference to Latin. II. Our Classical Inheritance. III. The Tragedy and Comedy of the Greeks. IV. Classtcal Archaeology. V. 'The Olympic Games at Athens in 189·6. That the book will accompHsh its purpose there can be no doubt. Be_s.ides peculiarly inter- esting the arguments are well put and forceful. A. strong argument in itseH, which must appeal to the most utilitarian, is the fine English \Vhich the author, a student of the classics, commands in his book. The addresses are not merely a plea for the classics from the view point of a pro- fessor of languages, but of a scholar who appre- ciates what is best in literature. There is a great dearth of \\Titings of this sort at the present time and any attempt on the part of an author to help the cause of the classics is far from unwelcome. The Engineer and the Patent Law. Mr. A. G. Davis, head of the Patent Depart- nlent of the G. E. Works, spoke in the chapel, Tuesday night, March 7, under the auspices of the Electrical Engineering Department. Mr. Davis delivered a very good lecture on \'\l'he En- gineer and the Patent Law.\ He said, in part: \The United States has adopted the general idea of the English patent system, but has improved it greatly. \The Patent Law is a fed.eral law giving to in- ventors the exclusive use of their inventions for a limited time, in return for which the inventor gives to the government a full, clear and precise description of his invention, so any man of ordi- nary education in that line will be able to con- struct and use the invention, from· the de~crip­ tion. The patent also contains dravvings and specifications. \A patent is a negative right rather than a positive one; that is, it does not confer upon the inventor the right to use his invention, but pro- hibits its sale for others. \On<5 of the hardest questions to decide, with regard to a patent, is what constitutes an inven- , ' I ~ . ---\.- .. : •, ', \ ''•: . \' • l ' ' ' : ~ ,< ti v t] a n p t t d l e t l

'The courts have r~fused to define an in- vention, in the positive, just as they have done in the case of a fraud. An inv€'nHon must be new and useful tn be patented.

The gr,eat progress during Hur has returned after spending several days the 1 !')th and 2@th centuries is in great measure due to the patent system., and especially to the United States patent system.

There are many n~en full of facts who Dr. EHery said: • 'General Wallace when traveling by rail at one time met on his train, the great agnostic, Rob- ert Ingersol, who invited him to come into his in a moment's conversation show they are with- out an education.

The plan met with slll:ccess frOm the start. At the student con- ferences last summer, the delegates were made acquainted with the method ef organization and maintenance of s1:1ch classes· and many of them prornised to endeavor to organize them in their respective colleges. A partial report gives the number ·bf fraternity classes at presen.it as 6 8 and the total enrollment as 7 9 8 men. r:L.,he second annual conference of leaders in the professional school Young Men's Chdstian Asso- ciaUon of the East was held at Princeton Univer- sity, February 17-19. It was attended by 38 stu- dents from 20 institutions of Boston, ~ew York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, as well as by ten secretar,ies and speakers. The conference was de- voted to a thorough discussion of. the practical problems of religious work in the professional schools and gave a valuable impetus to this dif- ficult \vork. At the Mt. Hermon School, Mass., founded by Mr. D. L. Moody, the association furnishes speak- ers and Sunday school teachers for churches within a radius of five miles. Recently 44 college associations reported hav- ing a mission study enrollment ranging between 50 and 26 7. The \Day of Prayer\ \\vas observed in the numerous colleges in various \vays. Through the efforts of the University of Illinois association, six local pastors devoted one of their Sunday services to the association movement, par- ticularly to the student work. The leaders of the Uni,versity of Toronto asso- ciation had men speak in twelve of the largest churches of the city, to audiences aggregating about 10,000 people. So much interest was aroused in association wor.k, that they have been asked to repeat the story in other churches. At the U. S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Md., the subject presented was the significance of the world-wide studeht movem,ent, with special refer- ence to the opportunity of the naval officer to see and help in the work of the association in other lands. At Oberlin, the \Day of Prayer for Colleges\ marked the climax of association activity. At a special meeting held on that day 53 men con- fessed Christ for the :first. THE SNOW BALL SCRAP. Victory .for Sophomores. One more snow- ball scrap has come, been fought, and gone down into history with the me1nory of b1·uises, bumps and torn clothing. It had looked as though the scrap would never come off this year, there having been so few con- venient mornings that seemed to fill the bill. That being the case, when last Friday n1orn ing da. \\'ned ·w:th a considerable wetness, although ice \\'as where there would haYe been snow a rnonth earlie1·, it was officially decided that the time was ripe. Eut it was a difficult rnatter to convince the under classes that such was the case. After a good deal of moral suas:on and considerably n1ore physical suasion, however. the Juniors managed to get the row underway. It then rnanaged to work itself out. The \Sophs\ claim victory and not without jus- tice. The Freshman president, fighting hard, \\·as put over the terrace early in the struggle. The Sophom.ore president did not follow hirn for the reason that he was flat on h~s back most of the time, with a faithful body-guard of some dozen Sophs sitting on him. Here was the thickest of the fight. The fight was a little out of the usual fo:r two reasons. There was no preliminary snow-ball scrap because of the scarcity of snow. h~stead of water. the gully at the foot of the terrace \Yas filled with several inches of black n1ud, effec- tually marking any unfortunate who was once in it. The time occupied was not long. peace- being fully restored in half an hour. In the intercollegiate oratorical contt'st held at Rochester last night Union's representative,, Thomas M.

In another colutnn are printed son1e clip- pings that pertain to the value of education. These should prove of special interest to us at the present titne. As the end of the win- ter tenn is approaching with exan1inations close at hand we ar.e apt to realize n1ore than eyer the in1portance of our regular col- lege work. The ·chief ain1 in corning to college is to gain an education. \Vhy? Be- cause experience has proyed that the edu~ cated n1an starts life with greater assets and thus better qualified for success than the uneducated. It was with the end in view of higher education that colleges vvere estab- lished. Granted then that a college stands pritnarily for education, does it not follow that the college n1an who does not n1ake education his chief ain1 loses the greatest advantag·e college life can gi.ve hin1? The n1an -vvho enters with the purpose of just skinning through and of paying as little at- tention to his work as possible is not a typical coHege rnan. vV e are now face to face with exatnina- tions. 'T'he way we pass then1 will shovv our true attitude towards the Yalue of edu- cation. The n1an who is content to just pass tn his work will not atnount to tnuch.

This year is the transission £ro1n no regular win- ter athletics at all to officially recognized branches of winter sport. As regards hockey, early in the winter several of the college fellows den1onstra ted their ability by defeating the 1\tiohavvk Golf Club. Ground has been levelled and n1oney expended on a rink which next year, barring accidents, should suit the needs of a regular hockey teatn. As regards basketball surely enough has been done to show the college as a 'Nhole and the Athletic Board what inter- est and what 1naterial there ir in college for the fonnation of an official basketball tearn. At the beginning of the season the Athletic Board refused to recognize basketball as a branch of college athletics on the ground that everything regarding success in this line was mere conjecture-that they had nothing definite to go by as to Union's chances for turning out a good t.ean1. This winter by a series of interclass gan1es it has been clearly detnonstrated that the possibil- ity we have for turning out a strong teatn should be made use of.

THE CONCORDIENS~IS. A VIEW OF FOOTBAL~L. From an Unexpected Qwarter. I am Hausmutter in a large Southern \U:niver- sity, \Yhere we pride ourselves on our 'varsity footbal~I team, and I think a few facts from one of the \insiders\ might not be out of place. \Vhen. our boys are not well or a.re sn1oking too m ych, or sitting up too late, eating in. digesti- ble food, too lazy to keep up gymnasium work, too dull to study, with what eagerness do we look. forward to the training season for football! Within a week what a difference! No smoking, \early to bed, early to rise,\ football diet, en- thusiastic \gym\ work, clear brains for study, the steadfast look in the eyes that co·rnes from self-control and concentrated purpose. The very orders of the football field become the source of daily inspiration of life. Whe1:1 a boy tries to inspire a younger brother to attack a difficult lesson, what possible words would be as potent as \Buck the center, kid; don't be a quitter!\ Boys at other times called \goody-goody\' come to the front as :fierce tackles, and every ••goody\ word they say afterwards carries weight and in- fluence. When we gather by the evening fire there's sometimes an experience meeting. On one occa- sion football was the theme. One of the most aggressive players, \lion on the line,\ a boy of unflinching moral purpose, an almost brutal frankness on the side of the right, and a tower of strength physically and morally in every good work, led the talk. •'Did you know, Hausmutter, I was no end of a coward before I played foot- ball?\ A groan of derision went round the fire. \It's solid fact. I was always so big no boy of n1y age thought of attacking n1e, and I never was hazed. But I absolutely dreaded a collision with any one who differed from me, and without football I'd have sneaked along through life. But football gave me courage, and I'm glad to say I do enjoy playing on the weaker side and tack- ling a bigger man and carrying things with a rush.\ \Whew! hand over your trumpet, please; we'll blow it for you,\ say two or three juniors. r .· ~ ~· TIFF ANY & CO cl~ . • I Jeweiers to ·College Men. * * * * Designs and estimates furn.ished for Frat·ernity Pins, Class Rings, Class Cups Stationery, Ftc. * * * * No order will be accepted for ex- ecution at a price not consistent with the best workn1anship and a quality worthy of the nan1e of the House.

In order to arouse an interest in the study of topics relating to commerce and industry and to stilnulate an examination of the value of college training for business men, Prof. J.
