I . . f' ·. THE CONCORDIENSIS UNION COLLEGE, JANUARY 14, 1~02. No. 12 .. R. P. I. 24-UNION 2. Saturday evening, January tenth, the basket ball teatn played the first game of the season with R. P. I. and was defeated by a score of 24--2. T'his score, while seemingly pretty large,. does not put the Union team in such a bad light, for besides being the Union team's first appearance in public, the game was played away fron1 hotne and with a crippled team. Olmsted and Burnham, who have both prac- ticed regularly with the tea1n, could not be on hand, so Captain Anderson had to have Cleve- land and K.luge play Olmsted's position, and Hagar, ~vho has be.en practicing but three or four days, play Burnham's position. These 1nen of course played a very pretty game, but had the regular tean1 been present the score wuuld certainly have been tnuch smaller. 'fhe gan1e was a retnarkably clean one, only two fou:ls being called during both halves. For the first five minutes of play it looked very 1nuch as though neither side would score, there being not a single basket 1nade, but then R .. P. I's. centre seen1ed to lose. Cleveland made six of the right baskets made in the first half. In the latter part of the first half Captain Anders.on shot a very pretty goal from nearly the centre, thus n1aking the only score for Union. 1'he second half Kluge took Cleveland's place and stuck to his man remarkably ·well. 'l'he first part of the second. half promised to be a repetition of the first part of the :first half, but after a little R. P. I.'s familiarity passing with their own 'floor and their accurate secured for then1 four more baskets which made the final score 24--2. A return gatne is to be played some time in !-february and it is to be hoped ~he whole team can be present and that the score this next time wHl be 2 4 to ~ 2 in favor of Union instead of R. P. 1~ The line up follows. R. P. I. Union. R. G. . ............ ,, .•.••.•. I-I agar L. ·G ...................... -s .•••••• Gagen , J Cleveland C .... ··•·············•·· 1 !(luge L. F .............

A large engine boiler has replaced the old furnaces under the present library and Memorial Hall will be heated with the steam frotn this boiler.

' MID-WI,NTER.CONCER.T, · At the mid-winter concert of the Union 'College Musical clubs, to be held at the Van ·Curler on Tuesday evening, Jan. uary 20, an ,, innovation will be attempted. In addition to the usual typical college program of the Glee and l\{andolin Clubs the Cheshire Con- cert company has been engaged. 1\'his com- pany consists of Mr John Cheshire, harpist ; Mr. c.· T .. Coley, recently from the General Electric testing department, has been made instructor in electrical engineering. He is a graduate of Stevens ~Institute of 'T'echnoJogy of the class of 'oo. Mr. Coley has been :for tw~ years p~rsuing a special line of study in t}lis· city and co1nes to the college with the highe·st recommendations .. Since the recent .· changes in the sc~edu~e of the electrical en- gineering course, .the greater number of en~ineers have. chosen that course. The eivil apd sanitary engineers are now comparativ~e ly few 'in ·number. Owing to the recent changes in the electrL cal engineering course, hereafter all engineers are obHged to de.cide their separate cours·es by the ·beginning of winter term of their freshman ye,ar. President Raymond said recently that he had received and is receiving daily many let- ters from n1en who will graduate from other c'olleges this year and \V'ho desire to take post- graduate work in the reorganized electrical engineering cout~se.

Mrs John Cheshire, pianiste, and !vliss Nina Picton, £oprano. All are famed in . higher musical circles and their appearance will cer- tainly assure an artistic program. Mr Ches- shire is one of the most celebrated harpists in the world and his recitals have been accorded high praise. The concert will be a musical I treat in all its phases and should serve to crowd the Van Curler on that night. 1.,he clubs are hard at work trring to n1ake their part of the entertainment a success. It is to be hoped that college men will support with their presence this worthy branch of col- lege work. SOIREE. The committee is hard ·at work arranging for the Sophomore Soiree. At a meeting of the committee held Friday it was decided to hold the soiree in the latter part of February, pre- ferably the twentieth. It will be held on that date if arrangements can be made to postpone the Allison-Foote debate to the twenty-third. The committee is meeting with a serious obstacle in holding the dance, which, next to the senior ball, is the most important college social event of the year. The hard wood floor· which was· put in Memorial hall by the under-: graduates several years ago is being torn up in the course of the retnodeling of the building, and there is little likelihood that the floor ·will . be put back in for the event. ; !

THE CONCORPIENSIS. 7 The com1nittee has attempted to obtain the armory for the dance, but can not get it, and is unable to get any other hall in the city large enough for the dance. It has been suggested that it be held in Odd Fellows' baH in Albany and the suggestion is being considered. 'fhere . are several advantages to be derived fr-om this. First of all, the hall is a good one and the ex- pense would not be much greater to the men here, and besides, a large number of law and medical men would be liable to attend if the soiree was held in Albany. ALLISON-FOOTE PRIZE DEBATE. ~'ill Be Held on Feb. 23. The subject for the annual Allison-Foote prize debate has been announced. It was selected by l)ean Ripton, acting for the com- n1ittee, and reads as follows : I ''Resolved, that the advance in co-operative action in industry and con1n1erce leads to So- cialisln.\ To this question the following note is appended : ''By the term socialism is, in general, to be understood a social order in which production and distribution are control- led by the will of the com1nunity and not by the free action of individuals under competit- ion.'' This debate will take place on Feb. 23, and is held between the two literary societies of the college, the Adelphic and the Philo- rnathean. A prize of $so is offered to the society putting forward the best argun1ent and another prize of $s,o to the individual offering the best plea for either side. This prize debate was founded by George F. Allison of New York city and Ex-Congress1nan Wallace T. l~'oote of Port Henry, N. Y., for the encouragen1ent of debate in the literary societies. The contestants must have engaged in at least ten debates in their respective socie- ties Juring the college year imn1ediately preced- ing. The Adelphic society is represented this year by A. F. Bolles, 'o3 ; G. Parker, 'o3, and G. W. Donnan, '03 ; the Philomatheans are re-. presented by S. B. Howe, jr., 'o3 ; L. T. Hunt\ 'o3, and J. Fenster, 'o3. At ·a meeting of the Adelphic and Philomat- thean societies on Wednesday, the Adelphics chose the affirn1ative side of the question for the Allison-Foote prize debate, and the Pbilo- matheans chose the negative. CHAPEL MEETING. Meeting opens with Pres. Bolles in the cha~r. Manager Donnan speaks of the necessity of paying base ball subscriptions early so that the .A.thletic board can ratify the schedule. Capt. Gris,vold also speaks on subscriptions. T'h e Sophornore Soiree committee announces that a Soiree will be held, although a suitable place has not. been found as yet. Staebor denounces the pulling down 0f bulle- tins off the board. Putnam announces that the r 904 Garnet would surpass all previous efforts and that the· board had arranged to have the book ready for distribution by Easter. All personal histories, class histories and fraternity matter must be in by this week. ~Ianager Bishop announces that Concordy I subscriptions are due. Manager Peck announces rehearsals of the musical clubs for the week. Also announces a concet·t, a 1nusical treat, which will be held next- Tuesday at the Van Curler. Adjourned. VESPER SERVICE. Tl1ere was an unusually large ~ttendance at the Vesper Service last Sunday, a11d President Raymond spoke upon a theme especially ap- propriate to the New Year, taking as his text Paul's words ; '' 'rhis one thing I do, forget- ting those things which are behind and reach ... ing forth into those things which are before.\ Attention was first called to the spirit breathed forth in these words, which was de-

I \ I l \ j' : i I I I I I , I l i . I ~ ~-: ~- ..... - \':·~ ~ THE CONCORDIENSIS. . ~ s~~il~~d a~ dissatisfaction with oneself and am- b1ti~n for. greater attainments. Self compla- cency not only makes a man disagreeable but al$0 stands in the way of his development. ... : ':' . . Reference was n1ade to Paul's condition when he. wr:ote the words of the text. He was an old .man and a prisoner, with apparently few opportunities before him, but he would n1ake the· most of these. So long as he was alive he ··was in the contest for the best thing that life offered. President Raymond next spoke of tqe '.'high calling of God\ as that which ·is -before every man whatever his work or the I • . seeming limitations of his life. He described itas essentially the development of character and power to inspire otLers. The greatness of Ghrist appeared not so n1uch in his deeds as in what he was and the influence of his spirit over the spirits of others, giving then1 desires anq purposes that lifted their lives out of the commonplace and sent the1n forth to inspire others. This development of oneself for the sq.ke of others represents the call of God to every man, and because all work and all ex- perien,ces n1ay contribute directly to it-it is possible for eve.ry student to say \This one t4ing I do,\ whatever course he tnay be pur- s.uio.g,, whatever profession or occupation he '' . may have in view. In following this purpose he must forget the things that are behind, the defeats and successes of the past. It 1natters not if be has failed in son1e struggle with evil or with adverse circumstances, in the next battle he may win. It matters not if he has succeeded.

Dr. 0' Neill told at first of the clitnate of the Philippines, and said that in com n1on \Vith 'I'exas the Philippines have all kinds of climate. There are but two seasons, the wet and the dry, which vary in different islands. In the is- land of Luzon it is now the dry season, while in the island of Samar, the .next south, the rainy season is at its height. Of course, vege- tation thrives during the rainy season, but is burned brown in the dry. Parts of the islands are delightful the year round. In nenguet province, on the island of Luzon, -where the governtnent proposes to es- tablish a health resort, the noon ten1 perature averages 70 and the nights are also cold enough for blankets. The principal productions of the islands ar.e hemp, sugar, rice, tobacco, cocoanuts, bananas and carnotes or sweet potatoes. The titn ber. is mostly hard wood of the n1ahogany type. In Satnar men burned logs that would have n1ade ' ' . b.eautiful piano cases, and at a can1p on Catu~ bier i·iver he built a dock of mahogany hoards b . that n'licrht have been used for library tables. 0 The Chinan1en control the lumber business. The Filipino saw tnill consists of a high 'wood- en horse, and two Chinan1e.n on opposite ends_ of a hat~d saw. '!'hey usually get out one or two boards a day.

,. I' ,•,: :THE· OONCORDIENSIS. 9 some 1nodifkation of the Chin.ese exclusive act that wiH allow importation of coolie labor. The islands are dependent almc0st entirely on the Chino for skilled labor. 'I'here are as many distinct tribes of Fili- pinos as there are states in the Union. The Ilocano are an industrious people and are not inclined to insurrection. The rl'agalos are the best known of the Filipino tr:i bes. 1,hey are the n1ost aggressive and rebelious of the tribes, and the staten1ent is often n1ac.1e that they are advanced, but this is probably an error. They are agitators an<.l their narn.e is synonyn1ous with '' in snrrecto. '' The V isayans probably constitute the largest branch. of the Filipino fan1ily. They are intelligent and approach our civilization more closely than any of the other Filipinos. The speaker told of his first station at Dao and described the now fan1ous vvater cure. Then he described the native Filipino. I-Ie is a little brown n1an, beardless and with long arms. Eie has slant eyes, a flat'nose and large but well forn1ecl lips. He goes barefooted, but wears clothes in town. In the interior his appare 1 is coafined principally to a straw hat. I-Ie is weaned on cigars and sn~okes then1 frotn two years of age until death. He dies n1ostly of tube,· culosis. \Vhen the Filipino dines he squats on the floor and eats with his fingers. II e keeps his pigs in his kitchen to keep it clean. At night they close up every door and window, shutting out all ventilation. This is done so that if anyone s_hould die d-pring the night the soul can't get away. · All a~es and generations of the won1en wear the sa1ne costu111es, so that the children look 1 ike quaint 1i ttl e won1en. The ·women are rnore industrious than the n1en and are more prepossessing. The young \\Von1en of the better families are educated in the convent schoo1s of Mfl,nila. They are natural n1imics and learn quickly things they can be taught objectiYe1y. They are eager to learn and to speak English. Dr. O'Neill then spoke at length of the differ- ent dialects and their peculiadties. At present the Filipinos are governed entire~ ly by the civil authorities, and the military may act only at their request. In closing· the speaker said : \ It is the policy of the insular government to give the Filipino a good English eaucation:, and to this end the force of American teachers will be increased. It will take agenetation to get results, and the results n1ay be a crop o:f men more intelligent and, therefore, more troublesome, insui·rectors. But whether the policy is good or bad for Uf,, it is simply fair play to the Filipino, and that is what our gov- ernment stands for. '' BOOK NOTICES.

The alterations in progress in Memorial llall . . . render that building impracticable for dancing. The armory is an ideal place but those who are in charge of the armory are not in favor of letting it to students. Arcade Hall is small and for that and other potent reasons is no place for the dance. To hold the Soiree in Albany, while it would undoubtedly attract patronage from the Law ~~d Iviedic men, ,would be rather opposed to college custom. 1~he Soiree unlike the Senior Ball is more strictly a local social function attended by few out-of-town people. · If held in Albany an amusing and confusing mingling of the clans would result. To rett1rn to the armory.· If a properly worded request be sent to the Adj'utant General, it is ·possible that the armory may yet be secured. The ·committee will certidnly commit no mista,ke in making this attempt. The Board of Editm s takes great pleasure in· welcoJ.?- ing in 'behalf of the student body the aqditions to the faculty. Professor Steinmetz is too well known to the. students to need further introduction, but the Editors are in hopes that he will outline the changes in the electrical course ia the near future through the columns of the Concordiensis. Further mention of Mr. Coley is made .l! in another place in the present issue. In recognition of the good and regular work done by Messrs. RutJ:edge and Stevens, the Concordiensis Board has elected the former an Associate Editor, the latter a Rc· porter. This election indicates that these men have per· formed approx.imately three times the amount of assigned work required of each of the other members of the board. ToR . I rYiy brother ! 0 my brother!

So1ne delay was caused by the fact that Treasurer 'Vii tse, with the where withal to satisfy the host, did not put in an appearance exactly on schedule titne, which apparently, in the language of a justice's court summons, was ''nine o'clock, 1neaning ten.'' Leopold Minkin, of Albany, was toast- master, and conducted the proceedings in his usual clever and breezy style. After a decidedly original \ blessing\ by Chaplain David A. Dyer, of \Albany the boys proceeded to discuss the n1enu, which consisted of oysters on the half she 11, roast turkey, lobster salad, devilled crabs, potato salad and coffee. The first speaker was President Richard C. S. Drumn1ond of Au- burn, who responded to the toast \Our ' Class,\ in a most entertaining manner. ''Fun '' was the topic assigned to 'Villiam Rooney, of Ballston, and it is safe to say the genial ''Bill \ got all the fun out of the subject that could possibly be extracted therefrom. Clinton R. \Viltse, of Alexandria Bay, responded to the call for \J3on1bs and Bouquets.'' Mr. \Viltse as a \var correspon- dent for the New York Journal, had an in tin1ate knowledge of ·these articles, which was clearly evident frotn his ren1arks. John J.

Moran, \frotn Cattaraugus coun- ty,\ ·spoke on\ Complaints, Legal and Other- wise,\ with much earnestness and vigor. His fatherly advice no doubt sunk deep into the hearts of each man present. George IL Stnith, of Hamilton, toasted H The Junior Class,\ and brought down the house more than once by his witty anecdotes.

Every day the ne-vvspapers had brought stirring accounts fron1 the front. i!e ll~td read of the detennined stand of the Federal artil- lery at Shilo, and of the gallant charge of the boys in blue at F:redericksburP\ and he was ..._., now tJ s~e th~se sc~nes enacted in reality. A. lump seetned to rise in his throat as he thought of the consequence. l:Iow would he act in a fight? \Vould he cringe at the f1rst fire, and prove ·a co\vard, as so many had done, or would he go l.Jack to that little town in quiet Vermont a hero, perhaps bea1·ing an honorable wou nc.1 ? These thoughts were in his n1in d, as they marched t 1o\vn the road to the IDain coltunn. \ New oae, eh ? \ S:J.ld a soldier 1narching next to him. a veteran, whose face \vas browned with the sun of ·virginia. \I got here only this n1ornin.g,\ answered the recruit. \\Vell I reckon you'll get all you're looking for. \Ve won't let Lee get into \Vashington unless dead men can walk. Very n1any of you ? \ \No only five of us,'' c::tme the reply. \\Vell that's bad, for we have room enough for about a do·zen in our comp1ny alone. Got lots of stuff in you?'' \ I guess-I hope so.\ \You look as if you bad,\ saiu the soldier, taking a large chew of rank tobacco, ':but I'll keep an eye on you and help you out. First fight is tough on a 1nan 's nerves.\ After a long silence, broken only by the n1easured tread of the soldiers, or an occasion- al command, Hilton asked : \Don't you ever get afraid in battle ? '' \Afraid ! \Vhy, what's there to be afraid of ? \ \vVhy shells and buliets,\ answered the recruit. \Nonsense! You don't want to thinkof such things-unless you happen to stray under a shell when the botton1 drops out of the blarneJ thing. Forget it n1y boy.'' But Hilton could not forget. He thought • • ... • • • -. ,.., 4 .. , •• of the ninety thousand 111en marching into battle, of whom five thousand at least would be killed and perhaps ten thousand wounded, yet they n1arched and joked utterly regardless of the future. An hour later they left the n1ain road and can1ped in the fields, ·where ra- tions were served. A tnile down the road were the enerny's pickets. There would be hard fighting to-n1orrow. Two hundred thousand rnen won ld dash at each other cheering, curs- ing, shouting-four hundred f1eld pieces would roar and flash, belching forth their deadly n1is- siles-cavalry \Vould cheer and charge. \ \Vhat in the de vi 1 ails you,\ asked ~ burly corporal slappin,g Ron~ld I-Iilton on the shoul- der, as he sat vvith his plate on his knees. \They say that the greater part of the Rebel arn1y is down there,\ said the recruit. \\Vell what of it? 'Ve can't lick them till to-tnorrow, so eat your grub and turn in.\ Ronald IIilton forced hin1self to eat, and rolled up in his blanket, but sleep was out of the question. Never before had he been so nervous. l\1en around hitn slept soundly-al- n1ost as soundly and peaceful as eight thousand of then1 would sleep und~r the soil three nights later-but he could not close his eyes. .A.t last he could be.-tr the suspense no longer, and after wandering around an1ong the sleeping, he found one man awake. lt was an old veteran, suffering fron1 a wound in the head, and he growled at the recruit : \Say what are you doing aroun' here this tin1e of night. Trying to pinch sotnething?\ '· I can't sleep,\ replied I-Iilton, '' I'n1 ner- vous.'' ''The devil you are ! You 1nust be fresh fish.\ '' I joined only yesterday, \ answered the recruit, '' and I'n1 afraid I won't stand the racket to-morrow. This will be my first fight.

Coffee was given to the soldiers, and after a few hasty preparations the arn1y was in tnotion. Several co1npanies were or- dered out to fonn a long skinnish line, and Hilton found hin1self an1ong these. They ad- vanced under cover of a sn1all oTuve and with b ' a cheer, dashed across the \)pening to a ravine in which they i ntrenclled themselves But that short dash hacl.invited a shower of lVlinie bul- lets and fifty of their comrades lay dead or dying behind. Soon reinforce1nents carne up, and in a fe\v 111intttes a line of gray, with glittering bayonets, n1arched out fron1 the rebel trenchments with a quick, s\vinging step. 1\s the charging Confederates neared the Union lines, every man vvas down ,behind the trenches except one. That was Ronald H.ilton. It seemed queer to him. IIe did not hear ..the thunder of the Rebel guns nor the shells bursting; around him. , \Down you fool,\ cried the captain, but the recruit did not heed. All he saw was a huge cr.owd of meu, their faces blackened with powde1·,. advancing in double tin1e. .A corporal, leaping up, caught shoulders and hurled hin1 down. hin1 by the Then he knew :where be was. The tnen around hin1 were firing, pouring into that advancing line rapiJ, steady \70 lleys. He tried to fire also, but he was no longer a h urn an being. J\!Ien on both sides cheered and Hilton did the san1e · ' ' he did even ra ore, he cursed, raved and threw dirt and stones into the faces of his comrades. \Vhen he catne to his senses he found hin1self prostrated on the ground with three compani- ons try:ng to hold hin1. \Vvrell of all the crazy fools, ·' said the sergeant, \you must have an idea of· your own about stopping a charge by throwing dirt into people's faces. I '·d. ought to give you a good licking for it. \ \Did I show the white feather?\ asked the recruit in a husky voice, but just tnen the or- der carne to n1ake ready to repel another charge. Hilton knew that he had. rnade a fool of hin1self. 1-lc saw his companions looking. at him, and he kne·w that he n1ust be cool or receive the ridi,cuie of the whole co1npany. Again he s~tw that line advancing, flai1ked by cavalry. They vva vered under the tre1nendous fite. Ronald Hilton dashed foward ·with his regiment in a counter charge. He again svvung his cap, but now he received the chee1~s of admiration from his con1 rad es. l-Ie was directly in front of the E.ebel. cavalry, when sudJenly-every thing seerned blank. Two rnen of a squad, detailed to bury the dead, lifted hin1 up and he heard one say, '' 'fhis is that young n1an who joined yestet- day ; perfect devil for fighting, wasn't he ? \ \I never saw his beat anywhere, \ 'answer_ ed the other. ''He had hold of one of their division flags before he fell. If he'd lived he would have been promoted sure.'

Of this nutnber more than two hundred students have been earning part or all of their tuition fees during the last three n1onthf'. 'l'he kinds of work vary as n1uch as the needs of the students. About one hundred and twenty-five of the n1en waited on the table last sutnn1er at Atlan- tic City alone, and thereby vvere enabled to tneet part of their expenses when they returned to the university. 'The bicentenn:ial dining hall of Yale has deprived about seventy-five young In en of their occupation of waiting on table. Fonnerly about two hundred students acted as waiters at the various eating clubs of Yale throughout New Haven.

'· THE CONCORDIENSIS UNION COLLEGE, JANU.ARY 21, 1902. No. 13. SOIREE .. At a special meeting of the Sophornore Soin·e Committee held in .Silliman I1all,Friday, Jan. I 6th, it was decided that the Soiree would be held in Odd Fellows' Hall on Stat,e street in this city, on February 2oth, the last Friday before Lent. It looked for some time as if the idea of having the annual Sophon1ore dance would have to be abandoned until the spring tenn. At a. rneeting of the committee on \Vednes- day previous to the last n1eeting, the n1atter was thoroughly discussed and it was practical- ly decided in view of the prospects at that time of securing a place large enough to hold the dance, that this social function would have to be postponed until spring term. Efforts had been made to secure Odd Fel- lows' Hall, the only place in town suitable in point of size, and it \Vas supposed that the hall could not be gotten, when Chairn1an Smith was notified on Friday that he could obtain the hall. Inasmuch as the Round Build- ing cannot be secured this tenn and there is very little prospect of its being in shape even next term for a dance, it was decided that the Soiree, which is the n1id-winter dance, should be given this tin1e. It. is certain, fron1 the experience of those \vho have danced in Odd Fellows' Hall, that those who attend, will be glad they did so, as the Hall is well adapted and has an exceptionally fine floor. Owing to the uncertainty of there being a soiree this tern1 nothing definite had been done in regard to tnusic and catering. The con1n1ittee, however, will endeavor to furnish ample pro- vision for the hungry and thirsty and vvill undoubtedly secure the services of Gioscia''s orchestra, on the night of Feb. 2oth, CI-IAPEL MEETING. Meeting opened with Pres. Bolles in the chair. Fenster announces that the debate with R.utgers will occur about 11arch 20. Fenster rnoves an assessment of thirty cents for the expense of the debate. Carried. Griswold and Peck speak of the concert of the Glee Club on Tuesday night, and urge a large attendance of the students. Griswold also speaks on base ball 1-11atters, urging the payment of subscriptions and the preparation of candidates. Peck announces the final n1usical rehearsaLs before the concert Tuesday night at the Van Curler. Sherrill announces the next Junior hop for next Friday evening, Feb. 6. He urges a larger attendance than has been usual. If the Junior hops are not n1ore largely attended they will have to be discontinued for financial reasons. Adjourned. TlGEH.'S EYE INrTii\.\TION. On \V ednesda y evening, January fourteenth, the annual initiation of Tiger's eye was held. The initiates frorn the class of 1906 were Charles N. \Valdron, George Schefflein, Claude Huston, Earl H.ider and Charles Cantwell. After the initiation a n1ost enjoyable ban- quet was served at the Stoddard restaurant, on \Vall street. 'I'oasts were responded to by R. \V. Clark, H. S. Ohnsted, ]. G. Cool, Chas Quinn and J. R. Stevens. A pleasant evening was spent in song and story. Those present were Clark, Olmsted, J?almer, Heath, Watson, Cool, Sherrill, 1904. Brooks,

As the baseball season approaches, the manager and captain are busy looking out for material for a team. I\Iost of last year's team will he 011 the diamond this spring. rrhe fol- lowing old tnen expect to play: G.riswold and Schroeder, 'o3; Mahar, Heath, Bradley and Lawsing, 'o4, and Ellenwood, 'os; Od\vell, Hevor and O':Brien, all of who1n played a very consistent game last year will probably come over frorn the Medical and Law departments. ·Manager Donnan has arranged for a very full schedule including sotne games with the larger colleges. Dr. 1'owne will coach the team as usual. The :first copy of the college annual, the 1904 Garnet, was put in the hands of the prin- ter· Friday morning and the work of con1- pleting the book will be rushed. The con- tract calls for delivery before April r, which will ensure an earlier appearance than any previous Garnet. The book is tnuch larger this year than usual and will have n1any addi- tional features, an1ong which being the indi- vidual pictures of the Junior classes of the Albany Law and Medical departments. The annual is dedicated to Dean Ripton by the unanimous vote of the Board of Editors, and this election n1et with the approval of the entire class. 1'he book is to be printed and bound by the Tuttle Engraving and Electro- typing Company of Boston, J\1ass. Professor Sidney G. Ashmore has been elected vice president for Schenectady county of the Hudson Valley Humane society. 'rhursday, Jan. 23, being the day of prayer for colleges, all academic exercises will be suspended. Arrangements are. being made to have a speaker for the occasion who will address the friends of the college and the students in the chapel. The first debate of the winter term in Dr. Hale's class in argumentatiou will be hetd on Jan. z8. The question reads as follows : ''Resolved, that there should be a subsidy itnposed on stea1nship line$.\ 'f'he affirmative is represented by Barrett, 'o3, and Beadle, 'o4; and the negative by Cool, 'o4, and Clark, 'o4. At a meeting of the Junior Hop committee, held last week, it was decided that a· hop be given Friday, Jan. 23, in Yates' Boat House • The price of the tickets will be $r. so. Danc• inO' ·will beain late so that those who desire 0 0 to see Mr. James K. Hackett in ''The Crisis'' at the Van Curler on that evening n1ay do so and attend the hop later in. the evening. ----·---- An artistic recital was given in Sillin1an Hall last week Tuesday night by Miss Elsa Rueg- ger, the reno-vvned young vie>loncellist. Dean Ripton delivered an interesting ad- dress before the Y. J\L C. A, in this citv last \ week on the strange ideas on evidence that prevailed in the rniddle ages. A double quartet from the college' rendered several nutn bers at the U n.iversity club last Saturday evening. The following undergrad· nates were present: Messrs Peck, Griswold, Howe, Bishop, Styles, Hagar, Palmer, Heath, 11ullineaux and Rulison. Prof. F. S. Hoffman deHvered .a lecture Sunday afternoon on '' How and What 'Ve Ren1ember,\ before the Labor Lyceum, which n1eets in Union hal1, State street, each Sunday at 3 p. m. These ,lectures are free, and. there is a discussion afterward, in which all those that attend are invited to tal(e a part.

,,', THE C:ONCORDIENSIS. tr t COMMISSION PLANS FOR PRO- p.Q,SED STATE ELECTFti- CAL LABORATO,RY. President Raymond of Union college and the n1en1bers of the state electrical laboratory, conferred with Governor Odell, Jan. 13th. The co·mn1ission submitted plans of the pro- posed buildings and estin1ates of cost ; also an outline of the report the commission will make to the legislature. State Engineer Bond, a tnember of the cotntnission, later gave out this statement : An1ong the bills passed by the legislature of I 902 was one appointing a commission com- posed of three n1embers, Edward A. Bond Charles P. Steinrnetz and Howard \'\V. Buck for investigatting as to the necessity of the establislnnent of a state electrical laboratory and provide information on que·stions of elec- trical science and an official standardizing lab- oratory for 1neasuring instrtunents, apparatus and standards for the protection of municipali- ties and the producers and consumers of elec- trical energy. The men1bers of the con1n1ission have been actively engaged during the past year procur- ing all the data obtainable irll relation to this subject, and have just con1pleted their report for subtnission to the legislature. It was found by the comn1ission that over one ancl a half billion dollars of capital is in- vested in financial interests involved in the use of electricity in New York state. It is evident that ·where such vast interests are concerned, disputes must necessarily be of frequent oc- currence between the producer and consumer; and also between the interests which are both producing and using electrical energy for differ- ent purposes. The danger to 1 ife and property frotn crossing of circuits, insufficient insulation, the use of high Yoltage in public rights of way is also rapidly increasing with the swift growth and extension of the use of electricity, and publi.c interests demand that every possible safeguard be en1ployed to enhance the security of our citizens ; and to als<? further the gener- al co.mrnercial interests of the state by provid- ing the means for meeting the demands grow- ing out of the complications arising from the conditions thus created. , A state electrical laboratory adequately equipped and properly conducted, wouid, in the opinion of the commission, fulfill these re- quirements. £'\n official standardizing of the electrical instruments used for measuring the in1n1ense an1ount of electrical power which is bought and sold would be insured to the great benefit of the consun1er. It is hoped that in n1any instances, disputes which are now carried into the courts, could be obviated, and an1icable settletnents reached through the 1nedia tion of such a laboratory equipped for experimental work and to which could be subtnitted for careful and impartial investigations, tnatters which would otherwise be adjusted upon the evidence of witnesses necessarily more or less biased in their opinion. The facility for constant investigation and experin1entation which could be accorded would be of the utn1ost importance to the state at large, in view of the fact that the subject of the use of electdcity is one which in one way or another is now of !n1portance to every citi .. zen, and will go far towards keeping the state of New York well abreast and even ahead of the march of progress in this great branch of industry. The genera.l scope of the laboratory as pro- posed by the conunission is : I 'l'he calibration of all forn1s of electrical tneters and other electrical apparatus and ap- pliances. 2 Experitnental tests which may be called for by the courts, municipals or individualities for impartialities or individuals for in1partial evidence on disputed questions of fact. 3 Continual investigations and experitnents with a view to the developtnent of electrical science and the application of electrical power to useful ends. To carry out the plan proposed by the com-

8 .THE CONCORDIENSIS. mis_sion, they suggest the erection of five separate buildings at some point to be selec:t- ~d. by the comtnission to be named by the legislature, and to consist of a power-house, es.timated ~o cost $r3, 856.oo, a stora.ge building $7, 202.oo, an electro-chemical building, $z3,- 0io, and Machinery building, $9,52 7. oo, an administration and instrument building $28,- 354.oo, making the total cost of all buildings $81, 949• 00. The estimated cost of the equipn1ent is $59,- 7oo.oo for power house; $I,ooo.oo for storage building, $2o,6oo.oo for electro-chemical build- ing, $63,400 for n1achinery building and $ro,- 40o.oo for ad.tninistration and instrument building, a total of $rss,roo.oo. 1'o this should be added $27,4oo.oo forn1iscellaneous iten1s. such as copper cables, poles, traveling cranes, installation of machinery and appli- ances·, etc., and $to, 55 I. oo for superintendence, contingencies and architectural treatment, mak- ing the total estin1ated cost for building and equiprnen t complete $2 7 5, ooo. oo. The comrnission n1akes these recommenda- tions to the legistature : rfhat the sum of $2 7 s, 000 be appropriated for the erection and equ~pment of a state elec- trical laboratory, and that the governor of the state, the comptroller of the state, the state engineer and the remaining members of this commission be designated as a special con11nis- sion to supervise its work. That to this special cornmission be referred the selection of a site tor the laboratory. That this special· co1n1nission be instructed to prepare and submit to the next legislature a plan for the control of said laboratory, where- by reasonable assurance will be given of free- dom from all influence that would tend to dis- credit the absolute independence of the labor- atory and the scientific value of the work. That this commission be instructed to nomi- nate to the next legislature a suitable n1an for the office of dire-ctor of the electrical laboratory, and to reco1nmend the amount of his salary, together with the total amount of the annual appropriation that ·will be necessary to carry on the work of the laboratory. UNION COLLEGE WINNER IN L. I. LAND SUIT. In holding that Union college n1ay recover possession of land in Long Island City, great- er New York, because the n1unicipaHty neglect- ed to build a city hall thereon in compliance with the conditions of the transfer, the court of appeals last week handed down a decision of particular interest to those who deal in real estate. 'fhe action was one in ejectn1ent, brought by the trustee's of the college against the city of :New 'lork. Itntnediately after the description of the pretnises is the following language: ''Said plot of lancl is to be used by said Long Island City for the purpose of build- ing a city hall thereon, and this conveyance is rnade upon the express condttion that in case the said plot uf ground above described shall ever cease to be used by said Long Island City for a city hall, or other similar city buildings, then and in that case the said plot of land shall revert back to the parties hereto of the first part as if this co'nveyance had not been 1nade.\ The tract of land in question consists of a triangular piece of about five city lots located on the north side of 1\'welfth street and east of Van Alst avenue, west of St. John's Hospital. The plot was donated to Long Island City in 1872 by Union College, which at that tin1e owned a large part of the city. This was shortly after the incorporation of the city and the adoption of the revised~ charter in r 87 I. As is above stated, the plot was given for the express purpose of a site for a city hall. Shortly after that the n1unicipality entered up. on a vast systetn of public improven1ents ren- dered necessary in order to provide a syste1n of public higb ways out of the svvan1ps and salt rneadows covered at every high tide. This ex- hausted all .of the funds of the n1unicipality and delayed the building of the hall. It was intended also to purchase two adjoining lots

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 belonging to Philip I(earney, in order to make th·e plot sufficiently large for a,n in1posing pub· lie building. This purchase was never conM sum.mated, on account of the straitened finan- cial conditi<?n of the city. The plot was assessed for $7, ooo by the Long Island City improvetnent cotnn1ission and was sold for non-payment of the atnounts due and was bought by 'Vn1. Nelson the pipe contractor. ·under the provisions of the law the owner of the property was allow·ed to reM deem. the same in improven1ent certificates which became very tnuch depressed in value. The city redeemed the property by the payrnent of $5,300 in i1nproven1ent certificates, thus exer- cising an act of ownership. About ten years ago forrner Attorney Gen- eral Leslie \V. Russell began a suit for Union College for the recovery of the property. Ivlr. Russell soon after went upon the Supreme Court bench and the suit was allo\ved to sltun- ber. After the consolidation the local authorities tried to induce the City of New York to secure the property for a borough hall, but n0thing was done in the 1natter. The prevailing opinion was written by Judge Gray, Chief Judge Parker and Judges O'Brien and Bartlett concurring. Judge Haight dissent- ing, and Judges Cullen and \iV erner absent. POST GRADUATE COURSI~ OF LECTURES. At the time when the Union college authori- ties decided to make a change in the Electrical Engineering course and the services of 1\Ir. Charles P. Steinn1etz were secured as professor of electrical engineering, a post-graduate course was spoken of. Professor Steinn1etz strongly urged the establishment of such a course, pointing out its great advantages, not only to those who vrould avail themselves of the opportunity offered, but to the college. It was decided to institute a post-graduate course and on Saturday Qf last week this new branch of the college work was started, with Professor Steinmetz in charge. During the course Professor Charles Stein~ n1etz will give two lectures, elective_s, on the following subjects: \Scientific Foundations of Electrical Engineering.\ and ''Theoretical Eletnents of Electrical Engineering.\ The dates for these lectures have not as yet been decided upon.

Addres~ all communications to TIIE CoNCORDIENSIS Union College, Schenectady, N. Y. The College Y. M. C. A. has recently issued an attractively gotten up card containing the topics for th.e Tuesday night services during the term in Silliman Hall. It is to be hoped that a large number of the students will avail themselves of the privilege of attending these meetings. The concert held in the Van Curler Opera IIouse Tuesday evening was an artistic if not an overwhelming financial success. It is to be regretted that so few of the students attended. If a college organization is not supported loyally at home by the students what can it expect at the hands of strangers ? Some time ago a Committee was appointed to arrange for a series of College Smokers. One pleasant evening has thus far been provided. We would suggest that this cmnmittee awake from its slumbers and arrange for another gathering early i~ February • ' T'he student body is able to breathe normally once more. For two weeks we have been. treated to a grand amalgamated spectacular acrobatic entertainment furnish· ed by the Soiree Committee. The rapidity with which these gentlemen have juggled with the date and place of the Soiree has been somewha:t bewildering. vVe decided to attend it here in Schen.ectady only to learn it was to be given in Albany. IIaving borrowed the requisite carfare we were about to dose a deal with the Albany I-Iackmen's Union when the committee folded their tents and fled back to Tiorp. vVe learn authorita- tively as we go to press that they have finally succeeded in nailing down the elusive date and that the Soiree will be given February 2oth. Laying aside all levity we desire to offer our humble praise for the successful completion of the preliminaries of an unusually difficult task. The Southland. 0 what shall be said of thee, Southland, Thou pleasant and beautiful sunland, The land where my thoughts often turn, love, The land with the cle:1r sky o'erhead, love, I think of thee oft in the day, I dream of thee oft in the night, I would that I might far away Midst thy glories and splendors delight. Though the poets may sing of the Northland, \Vith its hills and its valleys of snow, 'Vith its rivers of crystal, the Northland, The home of the brave here below, Yet give me one year of the Southland For twice, double, that time in the North For the cold and the frosts of the Northland I would have thy sweet perfumed green swarth. 0 the men that have sung of the Northland, The cold and forbidding, grim Northland, I sing now alone of the glories thine own, I sing of the glorious Southland.

TRACK TEAM PROSPECTS. As the seaso::n for track athletics once more approaches, tfu:e question as to whether or not Union is in a condition to turn out a winning tearn naturally arises. Griffith ai1d Finnegan, 'o2, will be greatly rnissed, but there are still men enough left to make the prospects fairly bright. R.oot't.ey, the \Vil1ian1s- Union sprin- ter, is st_ill in the Law depart1nent. The fall track rneet s·bowed that there was good material in the Freshman class. The manager is arranging to secure a coach for the season, but nothing definite has been done as yet. Jf a mid-winter meet could be held sornewhere it would not only serve to arouse interest but would give the captain a chance to begitl to judge his rnen. A dual meet will be held in New Brunswick, N. J., with R.utgers. College, and it is possible that a meet n1ay be arranged with Hamilton.

'fh.e J~ritish Minister of ~\'oreign Afiairs pac- ed th.e floor of his roon1, n1uttering curses on the jeering crowd below. Once he went to the window and looked down on the street, where a squad of soldiers were keepi.ng a crowd of Chinamen at a respectful distance from the consulate. The n1ob was not trouble • some at present, bnt he could see that it was becoming restless, and, unless sotnething was done, the Christian legations ·would soon be at the .,1nercy of the Chinese. T'lle British minister had j·ust received word that a force of Boxers ·were n1arching on the town' and unless sornething \vas done to check their advance they \vould be in the town befor~ night. 'Vhat was to be do11e? He had but~ handful of soldiers, com IJared with the thous- ands of Chinese in the vicinity, who would gladly join the Boxers. His soldiers were in comn1and of a young noblen1an who had never seen service, and he well knew the outcon1e of an engagen1ent with the rebels. · The French tninister joined hi1n. \'Vhat can we do, 1\tlonsiet1r? .\ he asked • •' Nothing, si·mply · nothing, '' answered the

.. THE CONCORDIENSIS. 13 Eng.lishtnan, ''unless the relief con1.es before to- n1orro\v .', Meanwhile the crowd outside was l>ecotning more trou b:leson1e. Stones were thrown; and the.order was given to the soldiers to \fal hack,.'' to protect ·.the legation buildings. About this tin1e a runner came to the officer in charge, saying that the Boxers were about to occupy th.e hill overlooking the town. 1'he hill was \vitbin easy rifle shot of the Consulate, and, when once occupied by the Boxers the destruction of the town would be easy. The two consuls were earnestly talking on what would be their best wav out of the situa- ., tion, when a tnan was ushered into the room. He was poorly clad, and his young looking face showed signs of recent in'toxication. His features, however, were clean cut, and his tnanner suggested a certain sense of refinen1ent. \ I have con1e, \ he said, \to infortn you that you are in a tight fix, and, unless prompt action is taken, there will not be a living Christian in tbe city to watch the sun set to- night.\ \Is that all?'' asked the consul, coldly. \No ; I can show you a way which may save your lives ; at least it is better to try than to be shut up i·n the city, to be murdered at night.'' His n1anner was frank, and there cou.ld be no harm in listening to his suggestion. ''Go on, '' said the Frenchn1an. \The plan is this. Put the British soldiers under the co1nn1and of an officer who has seen service and can handle troops. Let hitn occu- py that h:Il, and then, perhaps, they can hold it until the H.ussian-American relief cotnes.\ \Your plan might be feasible,'' said the British minister, \ but we haven't the whole English armJ to pick this officer fron1. \¥here can I get an officer who has seen fighting ? \ ''Here ! \ said the· stranger, stepping for- ward ; ''try n1e. '' ''But what proof have I that you can conl- llland ? I· dare not risk tny only hope, with a .• .. . . man who wil:l not give his name and who ap.- pears to be a heavy drinker.'\ The stranger stood tnotionless, his face flushed. \Here is pro.of.,. '~' he cri~d, and, .. tearing open his shirt, he threw s.an1all iron. medal on . .. . . . . ~ the table. \ A Victoria cross ! \ exclain1ed tpe l3ritish consul. '' vVhere did this C0111~ from ?· Speak ; are you an Englishrnan? \Vlicre did this ·con1e frotn ? \ \From the field of 'l~~f-el-~Z.eb~r., \. at~sw.er­ ed the stranger ; then he added in a' choked voice : \I was once an Englishman, but now.,_ \ Give hin1 the n1en. Try hin1 ; the troops can do nothing here. It is our only cl1ance, \ said the French minister. And the English consul,. biting his I. ips, an- swered, '• I will ; and for the honor of your country and the cross you wear, do your duty.\ That afternoon the British. troops rnar~hed out of the town, leaving a few French soldiers to protect the foreign n1inistcrs and their fami- lies. The officer in cotnmand was 110t the san1e gay young lieutenant, with gilt braid and polished boots. This officer n\l~rched on foot with his tnen, and his face showed tnark ed signs of anxiety. The natives were awecl. by his daring to march so far fr9n1 the city, while the enemy were advancing. in his directi()t1, and even the soldiers, though well knowing that the chances were a hundred to one against their ever returning, respected his courage. As they neared the hill which the Eoxers were about to occupy, they learned to tl1eir dis- may that the enetny had already co1ntnenced the ascent. · ... But this was not discouragh1g to the 13:ritish. troops. They had e:xpected. this, and,, \vithout a halt, they reached the top befor·e the· ·et'Iemy was half w~y up. rrhey threw up rude in- trenchtnents, but·, without tools, they ·c~uld. do . little. For t\VO hours they waited·, well know- ing that the enemy .only .waited for.n'ightfall to con1mence the attaclc · · · · ·

14 'rHE CONCORDIENSIS. ·Night ca,n1e at. last. For eight tong hours those heroes kept six times their number at bay. All through the night a broad sheet of flame poured fron1 the trenches on the hill. But during that night their a1nmunition had run low, and every cartridge tnust tell. Their cotntnander seen1ed every\vhere. \Vhen daylight came he ordered his men to re- serve their .fire. One look at his face shovved that the fate of the little army would soo.n be told. \Vhat was that cotning up the hill? A long line of men. Novv they break into a run. Ping ! ping ! A couple of bullets strike the rocks near. hitn. vVhat can his men do against these fiends ? Eight hundred Chinamen surrounded thetn and poured in a constant storm of bullets ; btlt still their con1mander's cry was, \ No surren- der ! '' At last he becan1e aware that his men \ver~ preparing to fall back to the town. Son1e- thing n1ust be done. He threatened to shoot the first n1an who took a step toward the town, but it was of no avail: they were all disheartened, and he tnust act pron1ptly, or all would be lost. Leaping on top of the rude breastworks, no-vv filled with dead and wounded, he cried : \Stop ! 'fhe eyes of London are upon yon. If you ·are Englishn1en, you will beat all those devils, or die. Con1e on men of Soudan · ' charge ! \ Every soldier there wou.ld bave given anything to set eyes on London at that moment, but the words '' ~1en of Soudan, '' spoke by their officer of days gone by, 'vould have carded thetn to the very n1_outh of hell. rrhey instantly recognized the young lieu- tenant, who had led the Highlanders in their gallant charge against the trenches of Arabi Pasha's troops. They follo~ved their leaders down the hill,. throwing the Boxers in to a panic. At that tnornent an English sergeant raised the cry, \ Retnetnber the Tel-el-IZeber.\ It was taken up by two hundred voices, and such a cry was never heard in that \ r-.orbidden Country.\ rfhe enemy could not stand before the fierceness of the charge, and broke and fled in confusion, That night, while the fight was taking place on the hill, the British consul walked the floor in a frenzy of despair. Why had he thrown away his only hope ? Why had he placed the the lives of the Queen's soldiers in the hands of a drunken :adventurer? How did he know but what this stranger was a leader in the anti- Christian spirit in China? He cursed andraved as he listened to the firing on the hill. At daybreak he threw himself in a chair. and dozed for an hour. l-Ie was suddenly a\vaken- ed by the little French minister pounding on his door. \Son1ething terrible has happened 1 ., cried the Frencln11an ; \ the firing has su_ddenly ceas~d.\ The Englishtnan's face turned ghast- ly pale. ''It's all over,\ he cried in despair;. \all because I trusted a drunken outcast/' l-Ie had hardly spoken when he heard a body of tnen coming down the street. '.' 'l'he relief, the relief!\ cried the French- n1an, but the Englishman shook his head. Throwing open the. blinds, he looked up the street. There, tnarching through the crowds of Chinese, \vho had suddenly becon1e quite friendly, were the soldiers who had left yester- day. He soon learned all. Congratulations were showered upon the tnan who had led these British soldiers to victory that day, and when the relief came that afternoon and the town was filled fur the first time with foreign sol- diers, the safety of the Christian legations was assured. That night in one of the lowest \diyes\ in the city, sat a young man, surrcunded by a half dozen opiun1 sn1okers. l-Ie did not seem to be the satne officer who 1ed the Bl'itish troops in that furious charge that morning. He was drinking and seen1ed unhappy. He had had enough ; the place was hot and oppressi\:e, He searched for his purse to pay his bill, when his hand struck a n1edal hanging fro1n his breast. lie gasped; the rootn seemed to whirl before his blurred eyes. He laid the iron cross on the table before hiln. CONCLUDED-NEXT W-EEK. • • ' • I o

THE OONCORDIENSTS. 15 HOW STUDENTS EARN MONEY. Continued from last week. About twenty men are caring for furnaces. During the Christmas vacation and while the rush was on in the New Haven department stores a score or n1ore men were working there. The express offices have the servicesof half a dozen students. Five students are at work as conductors every day on the trolley lines. 1'hese 1nen hav~ runs that begin at 5 p. n1. and end at n1id- night. For this they receive 20 cents an hour. 'I'hese studet:ts are employed the year around and have no difficulty in keeping up a good standing in their classes. '\\'hen a college play is given, as in the case of the French play recently, students frorn the Bureau of Self Help are employed to take charge of the stage curtain and help in various ways on the stage. For this work they re- ceive 25 cents an hour. vVhere the student has to compete with local talent, as in the carpet beating business, he has to come down to the usual rate, which is zo cents an hour. There have been several in- stances during the past summer where colored men have depressed prices in this line n1uch to the chagrin of the student. Many of the boys do a lot of teaching, and this is regarded as the most remunerative of all the vocations offered by the Bureau of Self Help. Applications have been received by the bureau for Yale teachers of physical cul- ture for the coming sumn1er. :Between forty and fifty men from the bureau are at present en.gaged in tutoring their fellow students and sorne of these tutors are now employed during the Christmas vacation with the fellows who fell behind and are trying to catch up in the next few weeks before the college opens 111 Jan nary for the winter tern1. e=cmr·rn···· = s .. ,,.mraw;:r= ,..... .....,....,. .,, .. ,..,.¥ COl{NEijlj UN1Vl~l~SITY MEDI,C1~L COLLEGE-~.~ NEW YORK CITY.

From Horace, Ode 5· What pretty boy, in midst of many roses, Besprinkled with a liquid sweetness, Besets you, Pyrrha, in pleasing bower? For whom Bind'st thou thy golden hair with simple neatness? Alas how many times will he bewail The fickle gods and promise given light ; Without experience will he behold . Seas lashed rough and black with storms of night. TiiE INFLUENCE OF SCIENCE ON THE IMAGINATION. NoTE-The followLng excerpt from· the note book of a member of the Senior class in the study of the Victorian Era in English Literature is of such literary value and general interest that the Editors desire to present it to the read.ers of the Concotdiensis. The extract is taken nearly verbatim from one of a course of lectures which is being delivered before the Senior class this term by Prof. James R. Truax. In the early stages science is dealing with a vast tnass of matter wl1ich is to be com- pared and correlated and explained. \Vhat sort of a structure is to appear ultimately is not known. \Vonder at first seetns to be disappearing and posit,ive knowledge tak- ing its place. As ti1ne advances, however, new wonders are tevealed. 1'he material phases that were overwheln1ing begin to subordinate then1selves to the laws by which they are shaped. and when sotne great synthesis, such as the theory of evolution, appears, substance seenl? to fade, and an idea, work- ing th~ough all ages past and with. unlitnited potentiality for the futtu·e, begins to take its place. Progress of society is fe 1 t to he proceed· ing more slo-vvly and this alone would te1nper enthusiasn1, but it is, at the sa1ne time seen to be proceeding more surely, and the end no man can foresee. If a man can look backward to all that inter- venes between himself and the lowest for1ns of life, he must be a strange being if he experiences no thrill of feeling as he gazes forward andre- flects that he is an essential factor in the vast schetne of progress. In the elder poetry the sun \~·as presented as a God of radiant beauty, driving a briHiant chariot over the great arc of the etnpyrean. To-day we know that the sun is a v .ast flatning furnace, burning with undiminished intensity through centuries and ligl1ting, heating, and fertilizing with the merest fraction of its rays an orb 2 5, ooo miles in circumference, from a distance of ninety-three millions of miles. \ . ,, ' f,[ .j ' j .,

\ ... •'· \ . ,, ' f,[ .j ' j ,, THE CONOORDIEN.SIS. 9 It requires an imagination and a language of transcendent n1ight to picture that, and yet in the universe the solar systen1 is itself but the veriest grain of dust. The elder poet represented only appearances. There is den1and for one that shall render to us the reality, that shall n1ake us see the '' im- passioned expres~;ion\ which according to \Vordsworth ''is in the countenance of all science . \ \Ve are capable of reaLzing sorne- thing of this vastness and are therefore in son1e degree partakers of its iinmensity in our spirit- ual being. Then this cornplex universe is held in the grasp ot:law. n'lysterious affinities and repul- sions control it. ...t\.s in a great wor~shop, des- pite the magnitude and the confusion of seen1- ing, parts answer to parts, there are hints of a comn1on purpose, and a few ideas explain all the bewildering intricacy. How silnple and yet tnajestic is that force which lays its im- press upon the tiny drop of water and the great compound of n1olten n1atter and con1pels hoth with equal ease to assur11e the globular form! hirn in its first suggestions, while he read in J\ialthus of tfu.e fierce struggle of hungry popu· lations for bread. and it took twenty years of research to In-ing· together the proofs of that divination. As the poets have often dreamed the tru_~h afterward realized by scientist, inventor and econon1ist, so, the poetic faculty in the scientist hin1self is the advance guard of his forces or the wizard tha.t with sudden stroke of his wand transforms va.st accurnulations of . fact into son1e wide reaching and illuminative principle, 1naking a valley of dry hones into a spectacle of superabounding life. COI-LEGE MENTION. The l~ev. Dr. Langdon C. Stewardson, Chaplain and Professor of Philosophy at Lehigh University, was elected President of Hobart colleg4t! at the sen1i-annual meeting of the Board of Trustees .. President 'V\oodrow \Vilson of Princeton university is at work on the development .of a plan of his O',\VD which will be an innovation in Arnerican !ttni versi ties. He in tends to introduce the tutorial systetn into Princeton, such as is used in Oxford and by which tutors are available for every student in his in- dividual prep~u-ation for classes. 'rhis and other changes proposed will require $12, soo, ... ooo, which I)resident \Vilson has faith he will obtain. An occult syn1pathy binds us to all the past and all the future. \ Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing,\ as VVhit- n1an puts it. Those who tnay spring fron1 us will in son1e sense carry so1nething de- rived fron1 us into the re1notest futut-e. l\1ys- teriously do our ancestors stir in us, as in a dream, in countless impulses to good and to evil and from the living garn1ent of flesh which they have woven, and in which the shuttle of our life plays for a few years, is taken the flesh raitnent of our de seen dan ts. \Vhile we tnay look for a larger intellectual eletnent in our literature, as the result of the scientific activity of the age, it wil1 in the end furnish new rnaterial and new impulse for a more robust and daring itnagination. It should be remen1bered that while science in its average working proce_eds by logic, its great theories _are in their first conception the product of the i magii1ation, as l)arw'in 's theory can1e to \Vhen an editor makes a mistake in his. paper, all the 'world sees it and calls him a liar. \Vhen a private citizen n1akes a mis- take nobody kntows it except a few friends, and they come around and ask the editor ~o keep it out of the paper. '\Vhen the private citizen dies the e eli tor is asked to write up a11 his good qualities and leave out the bad. \Vhen the editor dies the private citizen will say, \Now that old liar wiH get his just de- serts.\~---The Cleveland (Okla.)

It is time the students take . some .. action in regard to this manifestation of disorderli- ness. The Asst. Treasurer had this telephone placed in Silliman Hall for the benefit of the students. Ey the terms of the contr_;1ct the college must maintain the signs and the telephone will be taken away if the students do not sh<;>w their appreciation of the convenience provided for them. Mr. Pond will give them one more chance to prove whether they want the telephone or not, and if there is any col)ege spirit and disposition toward fair dealing in evi- . . ' dence these ~ew signs will be unmolested. There is scarcely a man in college who has not, at some time or other, considered the possibility of turning the campus into a skating rink during the winter months, west side, which could be moved when the season ·was over. The fact of injuring the campus in any manner is not worth while considering ; since, with proper drainage, there would be no settling with the spring rains. Very few pedestrians use the campus in \Vinter for lt is naturally bad walking, so it would inconvenience few. while it would give amusement and exercise to many.

Appropriat.e services were held in the chapel on Thursday morning, Jan. 22nd, the Day of Prayer among -colleges. A large number of the local ministers and many towns-people were present, as well as the entire student body. An excellent sern1on, which was de- liv~red by Prof. Tho1uas C. Hail of Union Theological Sen1:inary, of New York City, was preceded by Bible re·;1ding and prayer I bv Rev., Mr. Adan1s and Rev. Mr. 'l'almage .. respectively, both of this city. Pres. Ray1nond introduced Dr. I-Iall, who chose as his text: \For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul ? \ Mark, 8: 36, using the word self for soul, which Dr. Hall declared is man's essential self. He spoke as follows : '' lt is hard to define genius; it does not consist of capacity for hard. work nor is this capacity genius, for many a n1an may work hard and not be a genius, and on the other hand, ·many a genius does not work hard. :St:lccessful genius is the capacity for reaching after a certain purpose by the directest road. There is a great deal of waste in hun1an life, as our purpose is not always clearly defined. Jesus Christ shows the road for us ; by being attentive to his words we can save n1uch pain and trouble. It is a stupid tnusician who would try to work out his n1usical salvation without reference to some of the great mas- ters, Bee tho vea, Mozart or I-Iandel. ''The spiritual genius of Jesus Christ was marked by absolute clearness of purpose. He is a fool who eaters upon life w.ithout reckon- ing upon Jesus Christ as the highest spiritual genius and source. Jesus does not blink at the fact that we n1ust conflict with the world. We go out to overcon1e the world, to becon1e masters of the wor.Id, but what profiteth it us if we becon1e Inasters and our n1astery beco1ne our owil in1prisonrnent ? '·'A popular writer of philosophy, .a rr1an with the command of exquisite German, has been spreading throughout Europe the im- pression that Christianity is weakaess and absence of manliness. T'his man sh.o\vs ignor- ance of both Paganisn1 and Chri-stianity. The defects of Paganism were displayed in Gre·ece. She secured a whole world and ) lost herself. Suppose ·we go to Rome in the tin1e of the Caesars. Rome had tnastered the world and was supretne. Our philosopher tells of hun1an strength, but tnark the real surrender to Pa.gan.isn1. Every senator cring- ed before the haughty arrogance of a half- mad Caesar. Every client stood in abject terror of his senator. 'fhe whole empire was saturated with the meanest kind of cowardice; the highest boast of virtue was a whispered . criticis1n upon the despots and cut-throats who ruled an empire but had lost themselves, It took this Christianity of ours to loosen the nerve of n1oral courage. rfhe senate dared not and the soldier dared not. He had over- come the world but los.t hin1self, his larger self. '' You youths o( this land, I ask you to face the question of your duty in overcotning this material lrorld to yourself. Is there any fear that we 1nastet;\ material things and lose .our- selves? : 'l'his question, I ask you to face before· your 1nanhood is undermined. I ask you what you will do whh the challenge of Christ? 'Vhat shall it profit ~ 1nan, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul ? \Not only should we . seek the mastery of the n1aterial world, but also should we St!ek mastery over . mind. \V e need scholarshi-p that is fearless and independent.
