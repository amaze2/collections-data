THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXX. The I go8 Garnet At laHt the joyful news has arrived that the 19(:) 8 Garnet 1s due, the first :copies being ex- ll·l'l'h'd today. The publication has been slightly delayed by a number <Lf ca.m·L's, ch'efly the fact that there hRs been a 1nuch greater amount of nul terial sent in for apvrova.l than usuRl. The Board has worked very baed in the .effol'( to m.akc this year's clas.s-book the bPBt in the his tory of the college, and it is sincerely hoped lha.t their labors have bl'l'n succc,ssful in attain- InPnt.

College Meeting Chapel rneeting last Monday was not marked by- any very .exoi ting incidents. Dr. MacCom- l::JC\r was present and gave a good talk on the ba..Reball team. He said that very good spirit had been shown at the Pratt Institute garne, an:d that the yeHing was fine. Concerning spirit he said that it was a very good thing to have vvhen a team wa:s winning, but that the real' test \\''HS to ,s'how an equal amount of enthusiasin \l'l'l,en everything- was apparently going w~rong. Th~e team rnight always be counted upon to do i\l~ best and it is: up to the student body to show t1iat they reciprocated in kind. That is the fac- t~r that counts, and the thing that will turn out R winning tea1n. In regards to the track pros- ;pects, Dr. Macco,mber made the announce1nent t l1at Union's team would contest this year in l~:J·e 1\ew York State Intercollegiate League. v~fhat we ask for now is to get a representative ;t('arn on the fie 1 ld, and the only way that that .~a11 be done is for every one to come out and hy in competition for some of the opei1 places on the team. 'The prospects thus far have been \rn·y encouraging, and a number of enthusiastic :fn::.shmen are out for the team. J-Iarvey, '07, spoke on baseball. He mad.e no :J'('port on the garu_e on account of the fact fhat lt had taken place on the campus and all the f~llows had seen the contest themselves. He :found difficulty, he said, in impressing the squad vv'ith. the fact that it would be a good thing to Cf,lrne around when a notice to do so was posted f(i)·r their benefit. Waldron, '0 7, spoke on the interscholastic tntek rneet that is to be held on the campus on the 17th of thiS' month. Although the 1neet ]s not under the direct supervision of the Union Fnanagement it wcntld be a good opportunity to :sll-ow the young fellows what a good place Union ,,~('ally is. His rnotion to have a committee ap- !l;_}-0in ted to make arrangement for the pro :per ~rEception and entertainment of the out-of-town nten was unanimously ca::rried. A ca.mpus meet- ing was the form of entertainment decided upon, the meeting to tak·e place on _the evening of the m•eet. Manager B·rennan of the basebaH t€an~ found fault witll the way that the Press Club of the eoliege, that he supposed to exist, sent in the ·n~ports of games to the New York papers. He :said that hereafter the Press Club would be ~r~Ji.eved (j)f its duties an-d. that he, .as baseball :manager, \v·ould rnake 1lim.self personally re- :spons.ible fun· the appearavnce of the accounts of aH our grames in all of .the New York papers. Thi·s re:po(i)rt was hailed with an outburst of ,ftpplause from the stude~~nt body and the \Press 'Dlub.'' Captain Flowers of t,be track team an- 'n:ouneed :out' first meet ;as the one against R. . P. [.,' to be held on May the 11th. He w'antA aJl the rn ert to come out for daily practice so fhat the team will be able to make a good R1lowing against our opponents from Troy. Manager Noble announ·ced that five rnen who C(i)mposed the basketbaU team would be award- ed the bask~etball \U\ as soon as the committee decided 'vho was entitled to wear it. Upon 1noHon it was then ca1·r1 ed that the basketball players b-e awarded a Yegu'lar \U\ without any q1lalifyin:g- :letters to indicate the branch of sport. TJ1e report of thee committee was then u 1~on 1notion accepted. Five players will be <:1'Wal·ded the \U\ and others deernc d worthy \\\:11 be g.tve11 the \aUa.\ THE 'U8 GARNET IS HERE. ~OX.

The Dean's talk is to be of the same sort as his addrPs~ of last term. It needs no higher reco1n1nendation. His subject will be '~A Queei' Stm~y fro1n the New Testament.\ The ~orthfield Rally Tuesday night is of speciai importance, not only to those men in- tending to go, but to everyone interested in the Association. A great deal depends upon send- ing a large delegation to the Northfield Con- ference, and it is all a matter of the amount of enthusiasm we are able to raise. A large delP- gation should be sent from Union, both for t.h.:; good of the fellows themselves and more espe .. dally to have the College well represented

He practised law for a ~hort time- and thE>n assumed a eivil ser- vicE' poRition in the PenRion Office at ~7\Tashing­ ton, where he Rtay~d for thrf'e yf'ars. While there he took a course in the Nationa'T Un.iver- si ty Law Schools, in which he carriPd off every honor for which he competed but onP. In De- cern ber, 19 0 3, he rna rrier1 MisR Fntncrs Potter of Washington, D. C. In announcing· the appointment, Mr. Young said: , 'The office of Deputy Auditor General is a H'l'Y important one, not only to the l~E'ople of the State, but to the Auditor General himself. It is a purely personal appojntment ancl pecu- liarly so in this .Instance, politics having no part in it. The selection of Mr. Crighton was made fm:- two reasons: First, I wanted a man whom I know from the ground up. In my absence thP deiJuty is authorized to ~ign wa1Tants :111'(1 do other irnportant act~ which hind his princi- pal. So impurtanL doeR the State consider the deputy that hf' is bonded. in twice the sum of the- Auditor Gt'nenl:l for the faithful perform- ance of his duHeR.

Again the soft sunshine and softer rain ndmonish · us that Spring, gentle Spring, is here ~in all her verdant glory and coquettish weather. Now, she smiles and now, she weeps and oh, \vhat tears. Hovv they fill The Brook, run- rivers down Union Street hill and cause ''Prex\ to give another hitch to his trous- ers. But sunshine or showers, all the world rejoices. The awakening power of beautiful Bhould not be forgotten. In fact, it be called Time's annual alarm-clock. Spring might And this year we think that the clanging of the bell must have been unusually loud, for it has aroused our venerable trustees. Doctor Hoffman will tell you that sleep is the nor- mal condition of animal life, at least, that is what he used to tell us, and that wake- fullness is abnormal and a matter of degree only. And can we even hint that our trus- t<:>eR are abnormal? Hardly. But this year they appear to have waked to a little matter which has needed atten- tion during the past hundred years or so of their encurnbency, and that Is, an appro- priation for the improvement of the appear- ance of the campus. \Johnnie\ Bennett once wrote in this periodical, \A college may con- sist of a log, an instructor seated on one end, and a student on the other, with a soap- box of books between them.\ ·True. We all know it, but let's advertise. Let the bill- board read Dry Paths, Close Cropped Lawns, A Drop of Paint.\ Remember 'how the grounds always looked in Spring Term? Mud ankle deep, rank weeds and grass knee high and the paint in scaley blisters. A pretty picture'? No, but an uglier reality, :especially so to the stranger wh() must perforce judge by appearances. Let us throw out our chest and put up a front. Sort of say to the possib1e freshman, \Have a look. Aint we a beaut?\ We crave \Spike's\ pardon for the \Aint also for the \beaut.\ So here is to our trustees. Asleep or a wake, norm.al or abnormal, they have done a good job this beautHul Sp1·ing.

In the BeilRge zur Allegeln,einen Zei tung for Jan- ua,ry 9, Dr. Rein of Je·na reviews .a recent book, \D Universitet uncl deutsche Zuhurft, '' by Frederich. v. d. Leyer, in which the author takes a thorough pe,ssilnistic view of Gennan universities. One must not be deceived,. he says, by the rapid gro~th in natural science and medicine, nor by the increasing number of students. Since 1850 the uni- versities have been going steadily to their p1ace. 'l'hey are today only the highe:st technic'al schools for specialists and training institutes for govern- m1ent otncials. V. d. Leyer als,o sharply criticizes the profession. lnde1pendent personalities, he says, are rare an'long then1., but of virtuosos, cle-ve·r poseurs, unscrupu- lous office seekers and bureaucrats thei'e is no laJc:k. Their lectures are no longer influential in the build- ing of character, but rather bring about bewilder- ment, dilettanteism and IJSeudo knowledge. The phy~::Jicians on the faculty regard their own practice as n1ore irnportan t than their~ duties as instructors, and have, _indeed, condesC'€T1ded to university work only in order to better their social condition and be able to dmnand higher fees from their patients. This criticis1n of Ger1na..n universities is especial- ly interesting because of several recent articles criticizing our An1.erican ttniversities. It is note- worthy that these critics have two points in corn- mon: (1) Over specialization; (2) The failure of instructors to exert an inspirin·g influence towar<l character f<orrnation.-Daily N.e brasl\an.

6 THE CONCORDTENSIS NEW LITERA'TURE AND 'OLD Dr. Mabie Lectures in the Chapel On Thursday evening Dr. Hamilton Wright lVIabie lectured in Chapel on \Literatu1·e-New and Old.\ After a brief introduction by Dr. Raymond. Dr. Mabie entered directly u.pon his address. It had been his purpose, he said, to make it a formal address, but when he thought of the familiar Schenectady faces that would greet him, he changed his mind and came pre- pared only to give an informal talk on the men of the two periods of literary activity that he was go-ing to discuss. Dr. Mahie said in part: \One can look back into the past and see a great number of stars in the literary world. I have done so, but now the heavens have a different appearance t11.an they had at a for- mer ti1ne, and the present luminaries are quite on a level with their progenitors. But the per- sonalities of the old school were interesting in the extren1e. When I went to college all men 1vere affected by either Carlyle, Emerson or John Stewart Mills, if they were of a scholHstic trend.\ Dr. Mabie here cited several reminiscences of Mills, and continued: \I like to get a close view of Tennyson. Any- body else that does so 1vill be amply repaid. Tennyson belonged to a great group of college men. I recall one interesting anecdote of T~n­ nyson that well illustrates his retiring nature. One day Tennyson was out walking with a friend. A man was seC'n approaching the1n fro1n the opposHe direction. 'I do not wish that fellow to see me,' said the poet, 'let us hide behind this tree. Accordingly the two hid be- hind the tree indicated. The man continued to approach and passed the tree without deigning to look at the two men hiding be'hind it. 'Why,' said T'ennyson, 'he doesn't seem to know who we are/ \Tennyson was held in great reverence by Queen Victoria. In a letter to him before his death she said that if he passed away before she did that she would never appoint another poet-leureate as long as she lived. It really did take a great amount of persuasion to get the queen to c'hange her views after the poet's death. \In this time fl.ourished not only Tennyson, but Browning, Carlyle, Swinburne and Dickens. It was the day of Victor Hugo also-the great Hugo, whose novels we so eagerly devour, but who we remember chiefly for his poetry now, and for his sublime egotism. Some one in de- scribing this egotism depicted Hugo at the gates of Heaven} saying to St. Peter: ·'My great collaborator-\-how are you?' It was the day of great men in o-ur own lit- erary field, including Bryant, \Wlalt Whitman, Ernerson and Hollnes-not a piece of Old Bos- ton, as some one caned him, but Old Boston itself.'' Dr. Mabie continued the lecture along these Hnes, skil'f:ully interw·eaving narrative and rem- iniscences with the outline of his talk. He spoke of Lowen and gave an interesting incident of his experience as ambassador to England. The men bridging the chasm between the past and the present in literature 1Vere named as Dr. E. E. Hale, Charles North and Donald G. Mitchell. In modern days fine talent has come from the South and the West, among the1n be- ing- men like Riley, Chambers and Frank Nor- ris. Dr. Mabie paid a tribute to the work done by Frank Norris, and said that the country had lost .a great man when he died. He brought out the distinction of old and new literature and said that the modern age was one of cynicism and doubt. Tolstoi and Gorkey and especially Ibsen were the great leaders of this 1novement on the continent. Modern con- ditions are infinitely more complex than they ever have been before, and call for changed treatment. This is recognized universally as is PVinced by the school of modern German writ- ers as 1vell as those mentioned. There is a gre.a t reaction in German against the too strid family lifE', militarism. and commercialisin. Severa 1 things should mark this universal movement for serious consideration in that it is a real attempt to see things. as t'hey really ~re. In Dr. Mabie's opinion the movement is a recognition, but not a solution of the present clay difficulties, and, as he said in conclusion ' it is neit'her to be laughed at nor wept over, but an atte1npt must be made to try to under- stand it, and a real striving to know and to learn should take place. College Briefs At the Centennial Exercises held in the First MethodiRt Episcopal Church of thi~ city during the past week, Dean Ripton read an excellent paper on \Three Score Years and Ten.\ He also presided over the meeting on Monday Pvening. * * * Through a typog-raphical error, t'he names of Munk and Traynor were omitted in last week's edition, from the list of Seniors whose, future

College Meeting Monday's mass 1neeting in Chapel was marked by the passage of several of the new athletic rules, pr~sented as recomrnendations by the comtnittee in charge. Captain Harvey spoke firRt on the baseball game against Trinity on the P'l~evious Saturday, and again urged the Aquad t() come out every day so that the first tea1n could have as m.uch practice as possible. vVrigh.t, '08, then spoke upon the F'reshman bible for next year. The book, he said, was being nade up already and if any suggestions

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS were to be given, he would have them now rather than after the bible carne out next fall. Manager Noble,. of the basketball team, an- nounced the election of Assistant Manager to take place on Monday morn:ng next-the con- testants being Clark, Hendricks and Huntington, all of the Sophomore Class. Hill, '0 7, also an- nounced the election of Assistant Football Man- ager, and stated that the candidates were Cor- bin, Roosa, Tapscott, Guardenier and Welles, all of '0'9. Captain Flo\vers, in speaking for the track team, satd that the tearn had been doing excel- lent work during the \Veek. Last year R. P. I. won the meet against Union, and he said it was \up to\ the Garnet to turn the tables on our Troy adversaries. This has been partially done in the relay race during the winter, but a decisive track victory was the best \VRY to wipe out old scores. Kline, '0 8, for the Glee Clubs, in announcing a concert for next week, said that two rehears- als were necessary to get the men into condi- tion, and announced Monday and vVednesd:ay as the evenings for practice. 'l\'he athletic recommendations then came up for adoption. The article on Manager's awards was unanimously carried. Concerning the award- ing of a U enclosing a 2d to the members of the football team, there was a difference of opinion. Harvey, '07, expressed himself as fa- voring the award of merely a 2d, without the block U surrounding it. His suggestion met with the approval of a majority of the student body and the motion -vvas passed as he recom- mended. The remainder of the motions were unanimously carried. They concerned the award of the U for football~ for track; the hockey emblem; the tennis emblem; the gymnasium en1blen1., and the award of class numerals. Campus Meetings 'The t\vo Campus Meetings held thus far this term have been ent'husiastically supported by the entire student body, and their good jn arous- ing a fine lot of college spirit has been ma .. rke<l. The cheering has greatly improved, and the \vholc> tone of college spirit has been raised. The talken~ on both occasions have been interesting and entertaining. Professor Bennett was the particular luminary Wednesday evening, and he \cast his pearls\ with great apparent enj.oy- ment to 'hoi polloi seated upon the bleachers. Doc M·oon, '06, C'harlie Waldron, '06, nnd Glo- \Yackie Parker, '03, a 11 gave inte.resting p·hases of the \College Spi!fi:t\ question. Grout, '0'1, spoke on the cheering. T'he freshmen had B:ne fires built and the meetings were both ve•rY interesting. President White, of the Senior Class, hopes to hav·e them as a r·egular feature of Spring's activities. ~>- Medic Appointments F·rom the Senior Class at Medical School a nurnber of ap:pointr:r1.ents are annually made to • the hospitals in the vieinity. This year's list of appoirl,rnents was in charge of a committee composed oJ Professors Curtis, MacDonald, N·eu- man, Lochner and ·Craig.

The . weather was disag.J'E'E\al!lle but an enthu- siastic crowd of rooters ~kept enthusiasm at while hPat, ancl interPst DP\rer flagged for an instant. Th.e entire ga1ne was \.VeU played by Union's

Practically f'Yel y player on the Union team . got a hit. liildl'eth wa~ the ht>ro of the occasion and he had perfect (•ontrol at every stage of the ga.me. The visitor::; were entirely incapable of hitting him f'lafe and their taps at the ball were easy Infield affairs that easily resulted in outs at first. The entire field played a snappy support- ing game and but three errm·s were made. Con- sidering the state of the weather and the con- dition of the diamond, this was truly .a remark- able- record. Davis, at third base, had five put- outS to hi:s credit, and took every c'hance suc- ee~sfully. Union worked the \squeeze play\ !-'UCCEssfully in the seventh, when Osborne sac- rift.ced to lPt King in. The sa1ne play tried l y Trinity resulted in the player being caught at home by a pretty throw fron1. Bergan at Short. ThE'· wPek of practice had \Yorked won- ders and the- brace taken at the bat is a good ~ ornen of future successes. 'The score follows: 'TTUNI'TY. Rich, cf ............ . Rmith. c ............ .

H.oehes:er 2, Union 0 'Thursday afternoon Union 1net its first defeat on the hom·e diarnond, by losing a close, fast ga1ne to RochestE'l' by the narrow margin of 2-0. rrhe diamond was in excellent condition and tht> visitors' work was little short of mar- velous. But one error, coming al an inconse- quential period, is tallied up aga:nst them . • Union had but thrf'P on her side of the score, but they all came at critical periods an.cl h t in the two winning runs for thE' Rochester tean1. Davi~ pilched a fast game, and Rochester only mad0 one hit during the entire game. The Garnet also was lacking in h:tting abHi ty and only got two to their credit in the nine innings. It was not so much superior playing that vvon the game for Rochester as the knack they had of avoiding every error that would have re- flulted in a little different score. Union's team was not, it is true, up to the foiTI1 exhib- ited in the Trinity game, but the Rochester aggregation is the fastest crowd that has yet made its appearance here, and the defeat is no eternal disgrace. The only sad part of the n1atter is that no return game is scheduled for this sPason Ftnd the fellows won't have a chance to retrieve their defeat. The support givt:-n by the student body was very commendable, ancl elicited much praise from the visitors, who marveled at our yelling abilities.

There were two young men who went t:o coUege. One went because he -wanted to go, and the OLher brewery. because his father owned Th~ first pa'i<ll hi.s tu~ tion by the ~weat of his brow; the tuition of the SPcond came from the parental perspiration, and the old gentle- ;tnan wore winter underwear a'll the y~ar around. The poor young man studied Greek, Latin, English, Liteq:-at~re, ~rrigono:metry,. Amer·ic~rl ( . H.isto1y and his finarJ.Ces. The Tich young man studied German beer, F·rl-'nch cigareUes, American girls and a way to avoid exams. W1benever the~re was a f.ootbaH game on the college campus the first young man would sit by a window and read up on the customs of the early Persians. The second young man would sit sighing, be~idc:' a window, concealing everything but his voice behind a chrysanthemum and yell- ing like a tortured automobile horn. After many years both men were grad- uated, one with honors, and the other wt th a private tutor and a certain helpful discovery .in t.he art of using invisible ink. The sa1ne year the rich father lost hi~ roll, and the two young 1nen began life on the san1e fo.oting. T'he rich y·oung men, who foolishly spent his time at college, adores the front plat- form of an electric can which runs on Eighth Ave. The poor young man hasn't much use of Greek and Latin, but he employs his mathe- matical learning in .measuring ribbon in a .department store . Of which the moral is this:- You can't hope to raise any more fio\\rers by planting pansy seed in sawdust than by not planting it.

H. ~EUpton went to Elmira on Mon- day last to attend a dinner given in his honor by the alumni who reside in Elmira and vicin- ity. The dinner was one of the most enjoyable and successful ever given by fhe AlLunni Asso- ciation of Elmira and served its purpose in fur- ther cementing the ties of good fellowship among the men who have left the old college to fol- low various walks of life. The toastmaster, Colonel D. C. Robinson, '65, introduced Dean Ripton in a characteristic hu- morous speech that is making Union dinners famous gatherings for the promulgaHon of wit and wisdom. Dean Ripton spoke in part aF; follows: \Union College is making great progress along all lines at the present time. We are especially proud of her standing as an engineering school, which is being; strengthened by the gift of $100,000 from Andrew Carnegie and large gifts· from alumni and friends for the erection of a new general engineering building.\ The Dean also spoke of the many improvements now under way and in contemplation and mentioned the fact that the financial condition of the college is now better than at any time in its history. His ch·eering and optimistic report was re- ceived with great applause and he was com- pelled to repeat a goodly portion of his address to many of the graduates who were interested in the welfare of the co.Jlege, at the close of the dinner. The Elmira Da.ily Advertiser for Tuesday, May 14th, speaks as follows: \Following Dean Ripton, Dr. A. W. C'owles, the beloved president emeritus of Elmira Col- lege, and one of the oldest living g,raduates of Union, spoke. D~r. Cowles' address was of a rem.iniseent nature and in many ways was truly remarkable. D·r. Cowles, w·ho entered ·college in 1838, went from Geneva to Schenectady in a canal boat, the trip taking five days. Incidents of the trip, and of hi's .college days were re- counted by the venerable divine with perfect dearness and even zest. The characters of that long ago period are nearly all gone, but Dr. Cowles, at the age of 88 years, recalled: names and events as though they had been yesterday. As he entered college as a sophomore, he was graduated with the class of 18 41. ·~'I will not stay here .a great while longer,' said Dr. Cowles, in closing, 'but wfuile I· remain, I shall continue to remeiTI ber and love Old Union and all that it stands for and represents.' Applause and a heartfelt cheer greeted the Doc- tor as he resume his seat.\ ThE: other speakers were Rev. Mr. Dougal, '9 2, Attorney Mandeville, '88, Mr. Parker, Mr. Preston, '91, and the R.ev. Mr. Macintyre, '88. The guests were as follows: Dean B. H. Ripton, '8 0; Dr. A. W. Cowles, '41; Col. D. C. Robinson, '65; Rev. Arthur Dougal, '92; H. C. Mandeville, '88; Henry W. Preston, '91; Prin. F. R. Parker; S. G. H. Turner, '9 8; Donald C. llawkes, '02; Charles Brand; the Rev. G. Cam- eron Mackenzie, Pres. of Ellnira College, of Elrnir.a; Thomas H. Reddis.h, '92, of Owego; H. C. Bothwell, '02, of New York; Rev. Joseph :Mac Intyre, '88, of Blooming·bury, N. Y., and F. E. Hawkes of Waverley, N. Y. T'he Alurnni Association of Elmira is doing a great work for the college, and that it is a live and interested body is attested by the number of Elmira 1nen at present in college. Interclass Meet This afternoon the Annual Spring Interclass Track Meet will take place on the College Oval. The diffe~ent class teams will consist partially of thE! 'Varsity track team and the meet. will be verY close, as the winninp- team will pro b- ably win by only about 5 or 6 points. T·he class team teams this yesterday. captains have been choosing their week and handed in their entries The classes are expected to come out and yell for their respective teams. The events to be run off are as follows: 100 yards dash, 220 yards dash, 100 yards hurdles, high jump, ham1ner throw, pole vault, shot put, broad jump, half mile run, 440 yards run, 1 mile run, 4-lap relay. 1 ( t t ] E t 8 ( c f: f: t t j c c 1 I t ,, c r

E. lass val. ally will Tt1e heir orne The ards ards j THE ·CONC.ORDIENSIS 'J ·Rutgers-Union Debate In the fourteenth consecutive victory for the Rutgers first debating team, the Union four met defeat at the hands of their New Brunswick oppone.nts on F\riday evening last. It was a close decision and the judges were out half an hour before effecting an ag-reement as to the a\varding of the honor. Union may feel proud of the showing made by her representatives and may look for better times at subsequenc events of a like nature. The debate started at 8:30 in the College Chapel. Aftei· a brief address of welcome by President R.aymond, La Cross opened the de- bate for Union on the affirmative side o'f the quesdon \Resolved That the growing tendency toward centralization of power in the national governn1ent is a menace to the welfare of the United States.\ La Crosse defined the querstion from the a.ffirn1ative standpoint and said that the growing tendency of centralization was tending to place the balance of power in the hands of the national government; that such a course was d~ngerous because it took away from the people their inherent right of self-govern- ment through the individual states and be- cause their interest in government \Yould thus be lost. rrhe first man up for Rutgers was F. Marma- duke Poi.ter. It immediately developed that Rutgers would refuse to meet the subject fron1 the Union de.finition and that they would at- tempt no refutation in the opening speeches. Potter SLarted in and delivered a fine oratorical effort for his side and stated that Rutgers would take the position that centralization was neces- sary for the social, the economic and the polid- eal interests of the country. The first topic he developed at so1ne length by showing that past acts of legislation had always been for the best social interests of the nation. He also stated that centralization \vas the natural tendency of the times and was not to be stopped arbitrarily, citing most of the modern nations as exa1nples of successfully centralized powers. Hanigan, '08, nexi. took up the debate for Union, and after briefly taking exception to Potter's arguments. took up his topic-that cen- tralization is distinctly inadvisable, because it would take away from the people the right to legislate for themselves. If all power were centralized at Washington, he said, the govern- ment would be too far removed frmn the needs ,, of the people to legislate for them in a proper manner. Luman S\hafer was the next Rutgers speaker .. He dwelt upon the economic side of the advis- ability for further centralization, m.aking no effort to refute any of Hanigan's arguments. His speech showed very careful preparation and was well delivered. King, '08,. finished the a.rgument for Union in dwelling upon the inadvisability of central- ization; by lessening the field for experiment and thus stunting our national development. King first very carefully refuted all of the negative's points and made a strong effort :for the affirma- tive. George A. Leuk.el, the last Rutgers speaker, \\'as by far the strongest man the negative had. He made .an excell~nt speech upholding his side of the argument. Rebuttals followed in regular order and the decision was left to the judges. Throughout the debate the Rutgers team consistently de- clined to meet the affirmative upon any mu- tual line of procedure, and continued in their adopted policy without swerving an iota. There is not the slightest doubt that they exhibited excellent team work and they ·stu.ck consistently to their argument throughout. The Union. team put up a good defence and were especially strong in the rebuttal. In the decision the judges announced that the award. was made with a full comprehension of the ambiguity of the qu\estion as to just what was meant by the word \tendency around which the two teams built up their separate arguments. Considering the t!eam work and the presentation, the award was given to Rutgers. 0:o st~gma rests upon the losers, as they put up a plucky fight on the apparently wrong side of a question that was directly opposed to pop- . u lar opinion. Next year the team will go to ::--Je\N Brunswick and it is 11oped that with the training of the intervening year will manage to carry off the laurels. College Meeting CollegE> Meeting Monday morning settled au- tomatically into the regulai· rut of the passing of athletic by-laws, after the ordinary M·onday diRplay of eloquence by the undergraduate me 1 n- bers. Captain Harvey opened the proceedings in a characteristically enih usiastic manner, in spite of the fact that the team had lost a home game,

1-\1-IE CONCORD1ENSIS :and was repeatedTy cheered before he couiJ.d .make himself hear·d. He said that Davis (who p:tched at the Rorh,ester contest) deserved the ~eon1pl·iment o.f th€ entir~ student body in the \Yay that he han d~l u t h game in Rpite of the drs- couragi:ng feature that the team lacked its usual snap and did not giv·e hiln the support he de- served. The yelling, Captain Harvey said, was fine and greatly helped the tearn, and stirred up their sluggish \tllood to a considerable extent. Dr. MacComber Rpoke next. He seconded what Harvey had just said and then announced the Class traek l.TI. eet for the follov~<ng Sat ur- day. He had gol<le through the ''dope sheet'' very carefull-y, aceonling to his statement, and he declared that the nH=et would be a close o.ne in (:'VeiY eYent. A banner would be a~varded, h-2 Raid, to the ·winning class, and individual rib- bons to thE:> winn.ers of all events. Doc also anl1.1Jrun.eed the int21scholastie meet on Friday, and urgE' dthe studPnt body as an example to the young contestants, to keep en- tirely off the ova.'l during the mePt, both for a mattPI' of Hafety and of general order. OnP more fratevnity game was announced be- for~ the penn.ant could be awarded-the game between Phi Gar:runa Delta and Psi Ups!lon. The Junior and Fresbrnan game also was still un- played, and wou kl have to take place soon to leL the winnE'r~ bLke the pennant. , W.flldron, '07. eontinuE'd the talk about thP inta~schola~tic 1n.eet. He said that there were eleven schools reg-istered. It wa,s the in-tention to hold a good campus meeting to arouse en- thusiasm among the boy~. and everybody was urged to come out Friday evening after the rneet to makE' thE' affair a success.

The conference is religious in nature, but athletics take a very prorninent part in affairs. The object is to m.ake the attending Rtudents feel noi flO rnueh like n1e1nbers of a certain college as 1ike members of the Ameri- can UnivPrsity as a whole. Men were urged to attend if they could in any way do so. The athletic ta·ws that \VPl'e passed concerned the Athletics uRe of the collPge nan1E': that class teams must. be bona fide; that thP rnana- ger should hand reports of games and rn{'ets to tht> athletic secrE'ta1y; that only men having re- ceived a\vards were entitled to have thPir pic- tures taken with the tea1ns.

BASE:BALL l\IIDDIJEBUilY DEFEA'rED UnJ.on 8, 1\:f.iddlebnry 2 Middlebury met defeat on the hom~ ct:arn()nd last Wednesday at the hands of the Garnet tra1n. T'he much-vaunted aggregation fr.r)m. Vermont arri\red with their incomparable bat- tery, but somehow that battery petered out at critical p,oints and the Union team touched up Fisher fo.r six hits that resulted, through ~t:he ~ubsequent errors, in runs for the Garnet. The game throughout was very loosely played, especially from the Middlebury side. No glar- i .. 1g errors were made by the Union team, and the entire field supported Stewart in a good, conBistent manner. Stewa.rt, while a trifle wi1d at times, had great control at critical periods, and through the course of the game he struck out eleYen men. Only four hits were made off his delivery. The second inning started :fihe rout for Union, when Middlebury muffed a fly, the Garnet got ·a hit, and a ball past the catcher let in three runs. Hoffman distinguished himself by shutting 0ut a n1an at home plate by a fine throw from right field. Mic1dleb1Jry was erratic and had an \off day,'' as is evinced by the fact that this was the firBt defeat they met in six games. The score: UNION. R.
