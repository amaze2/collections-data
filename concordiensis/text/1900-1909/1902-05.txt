On 'f. hur~day a»:d F~·iday, May 8th and '?th, the Managtng C~mmtttees of the Amencan Schools of Classical Studies at_ Rome andAt hens held their annual n1eetings in the Board Room of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, in New York. Upon thttse committees rest the obligation of devising ways and means to maintain the schools at their highest efficiency. The schools are supported chiefly by contrib- tions from American colleges and universities. Representatives frotn the following institutions were present: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, University of Vermont, University of California, Bryn Mawr, University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins, Western Reserve University, University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin, University of Maine, Trinity, Cornell and Union. Many other colleges are represented in the Managing Com- mittees of the two schools, but their members failed to attend the meetings referred to. Each college or univet·sity represented on the Managing Committee of the School at Athens contributes annually a tninimun1 of 250 dollars per annum to the support of that school. In the case of the school at Rome the minimum sum giving title to representation on the Com- mittee is roo dollars. M.embers of the Roman Committee are invited to attend the meeting of the Greek Committee, but are not entitled to a vote. . Each school is managed by a director, who is elected for five years, is elegible to reelection, and resides in Rome or in Athens, as the case may be. The present director of the Athens school is Professor Richardson, who has been in charge there for more than ten years. At Rome the work is in the hands ofMr. Richard N·orton, the son of Mr. Charles Eliot Norton, of I I :,.·' Boston. Mr. Norton. has been in charge n·ot more than two years. A professor is elected annually to assist the director, and the latter is at liberty to em ploy a secretary and such local assistance as he rn ay deem necessary. In Athens much assistance is derived through affiliation with the EngHsh, French and ·German schools, whose lecturers and specialists are ever ready to place their services at the command of the popular Americans. Prominent among these obliging foreigners have been Dr. Dorp- feld and Mr. Percy Gardner. In Rome there is the G~rman Archaelogical Institute, whose doors are open to students of the American school; and the Vatican library, whose authorities have proved themselves to be both courteous and obliging. The lectures on Roman Topography given every year by Prof. Hulsen, and those of Prof. Mau, also given annually, on the site of .• 1 Pompeii, have proved of great value to the American students, and the study of palaeo- graphy and ancient tnanuscripts has been made possible and easy by the authorities in charge of the reading room at the Vatican. The foundation and maintenance of th€se schools at Ron1e and Athens are the best evidence we have of the interest taken by Americans in the study of Greek and Latin literature, languages and life. They make prominent the n1ore tangible side of antiquity, and en1phasize the itnportance; to students of the literature, of what is commonlv termed archaeology. A part, and an .. important part, of this work is excavation. Here ~sp~cially the architect and the student of art are ·called into action. To uncover an ancient city, like Corinth, or Delphi, is a matter· of~.diggjng merely, which \ can be accomplished without much trouble if tnoney be availab~e with which to reward the persons who dig. But to interpret and to ~e­ construct the broken and frag.mentary rematns which the spade lays bare is permitted to th?se alone who make it a business and a professton to study ancient building, and antique art. . . \\

THE CON:O'ORDIENSIS. This done, it is wonderful what added light is thrown upon the literature, and what interest attaches anew to the study of ancient life. In future, no man who intends to teach Latin or Greek in the colleges .and schools of this country ' . . can afford to forego a year s experience 1n Greece and Italy. Among the more interesting features of such an experience are the excursions, under the guidance of the director of the school, into the Peloponnesus, or atnong the ruins of southern Italy and Sicily. What the Germans call an Insel-ret\se is also a part of the year's work at the school at Athens. Such a journey among the islands of the Grecian Archipelgo does mot·e sometimes to vivify the literature than months of work in the study or the class-i·oom. A young man may profit by the opportunities to which I have thus briefly referred if he be a graduate of an American college or university, and can afford to equip himself with the moderate sum of seven or eight hundred dollars. If the college from which l1e cotnes is one of the : \ contributing\ institutions, no tuition fee is ex- : pected of hitn. Otherwise he must pay the sum of 25 dollars into the treasury of the school. A scholarship or fellowship is occasionally at his disposal-but only after a competitive examina- tion for which he must be especially prepared in accordance with directions fully set forth in the American Journal of Archaeology. To this publication I would t·efer those who may be $eeking furthet· information on this subject- a subject of interest to all advocates of classical studies at Union College. SrnNEY G. AsHMORE.

Held Under Auspices of Union Chapter. - The sixty-first annual convention of the Chi Psi fraternity was held at the new lodge of Alpha Pi, the Philip Spe11cer Memorial Chapter House, Union College, Schenectady, N.Y., Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, May 14;· 15, and 16, under the auspices of Alpha Theta of Williams College. Chi Psi was founded at Union College in 184r by John Brush, Jr., Judge Patrick Upshaw Major and Satnuel Titus Taber of the class of 1842, Dr. Jacob Henry Farrell and Philip Spencer of t.he_ class of 1843, Alexander Peter Berthoud, MaJor General ]an1es Cnatham Duane, Robert Me Fadden, Willian1 Force Terhune and James Lafayette Witherspoon of the class of I 844,- Of these but one-Patrick Upshaw Major-still lives and but for his great feebleness most certain! y would have been in attendnace. The convention itself was a dedication of the attractive new lodge, erected to perpetuate the tnemory of Philip Spencer the patron saint of the fraternity. The business sessions of the convention were held during the three days. Delegates began to arrive on Tuesday and throughout the three days Chi Psis from every where were very much in evidence around the college.

THE CAMPUS MEETING. The catnpus meeting of the student body held : last week on the eve of the departure of the ~ 'Varsity base ball team upon its annual Vermont'~ ~ trip was in a measure successful. The tresh- 1 rna n class is to be complimented on the efficiency\ of its n1anagement of the bon-fire, the base ball' management on the successful agitation of the; matter of subscription payments. The lack of display of wholesom-e enthusiasm and loyal Union feel ling, so evident on previous similar; '. occasions, is certainly to be deplored. The party of engineering students under Prof. Landreth and Mr. Edwards left on Tuesday afte1·noon for New York where they will stay until Friday.

The class of 1892 is working hard to hold a large and enthusiastic class reunion in June this being their tenth. L. B. Sebring, '92, of Schen- ectady, and E. S. Coons, '92, of Ballston Spa, are working up the reunion and the indications are that a very successful reunion will be held. These men have found a great difficulty in ascertaining the correct addresses of the members and they earnestly request all men who matricu~ated with the class of 1892 to send their names and addresses to either of them. The Concordiensis hereby acknowledges its indebtedness for considerable in- formation concerning the class of '92 to Lewis B. Sebring of Schenectady. The New Board. With this issue the present board of editors hand over ;the Concordiensi's to their successors. The Editors have en• deavored during their incumbency to make the paper the best possible, in this they have often failed, partly due to themselves, partly .to circumstances which could uot be remedied, The editors relinquish their offices to the new board with wishes for a successful year and with the sincere hope that they may improve the paper and bring it to a still higher standard than it now attempts to maintain. The new board, as the result of the election held in Silliman Hall on May 15, is c01nposed of the following: Editor-in- chief, Walter E. Kruesi; literary editor, Samuel B. Howe, Jr. ; news editor, Joseph G. Fenster; athletic editor, Raymond C. Donnan; exchange and alumni editor, Allen S. Peel{; medical de- partment, Walter E. Hays; Law department, Borden H. Mills. The associate editors from the class of 1904 are as follows : A. L, Benning, R. W. Clark, J. L. Donhauser, S. C. Fiero, E. D. . Greenman, H. S. Olmsted, C. G. Stiles. The reportorial staff, from the class of 1905 ~ E. F. Ellenwood, J. R. Nowell, E. G. Simons, M. T. Raymond, G. A. Vedder. The attenti9n of every man on the board is called to the fact that at the meeting of the board a resolution was unanimously passed that here- after every man on the board, senior, junior and :: :sophomore, must hand in one article at least for , one out of every three issue of the paper or he ·~ will be dropped from the board. The board as it is now is quite large but in view of the resolution passed it is hoped that the next · year's board will be able to reduce the board and at the same time secure the best men. It behooves every man to take note of this fact and if he wishes to retain his position he will have to work; for the board will certainly be reduced, especially in the class of 1904.

Union's base ball te:a,m left at 12 :35·on Thurs- day, May 15, for Budington, Vt., where the team was to play two games with Vermont. The first game was played on May I 6 and resulted in a de feat for Union with the score of 13 to 3· The second was played on the 17th and resulted in a score of 14 to 13. The games were marked hy loose playing on both sides, N. Devoe and Griswold playing steady ball for Union. Union's team was in a half-crippled condition as it has been for some weeks. With Bradley off, O'Brien playing, but suffering still from his arm, and Mahar, out of the gan1e, the team could not play as well as usual. With these important n1en out of the game, at fell to the batting to play the whole game, a thing difficult to do, Devoe struck out 7 men in the first game and Davis the Vermont pitcher, 4; in the second, Devoe, 7 ; Davis, 6.

In this issue is given all the facts obtainable concerning the class of 1862. This class, an unusually large OJ]e, entered with one hundred and thirty-three men, graduating seventy-five, which was a large number considering the troublous tin1es. This class will celebrate its fortieth anniversary and reunion in June. Lack of Concerts. Apropos of the subject of finances and college organizations, it will be remembered that a tax of one dollar was levied on the student body in the fall term for the support of the Musical Association. The number of concerts given by the association con- sists of one given in Albany and one in this city. From the unusual and liberal financial support given to the association by the student body this year it seems as if more concerts could have been arranged than the two comparatively stnall ones that were given. The New York trip, the only important trip of the year has been given up. For this there tnay have heen an excuse as Mt. Edgar S. Barney, '84, to whom the success of these New York concerts is chiefly due was unable to give the necessary time and attention to working it up among the New York alumni. Why concerts could not be arranged for elsewhere or other trips taken is not known. In the past trips were made to the west, whether these were successes or not, is doubtful. The point of the whole matter is that it does not seem at all just either to the student body or to the men composing the clubs that no trips have been made this year, while the association has received such liberal support at the b.ands of the students. Athletics and Finances. The talk made by Dr. Towne at the special college meeting on Wednes- day morning needs to be taken to heart by every man in college and especially by the freshman class. The time has about arrived for them to realize that they are students of Union and a part of the college, and therefore have certain duties and obligation~ rest- ing upon them which must be fulfilled by them if they have any sense of gratitude whatever. Per- haps if they could be brought to realize that their duty is to the college first, then to their class, s\lch a state of affairs as now exists ·would not continue longer· The fact has been e1nphasized often enough in college meeting relative to the position taken by the Athletic Board. They will not ratify games until there is sufficient money in the treasury to pay the expenses ot these games. This position is nothing more than a just and reason- able one from a business point of view. And should they cancel any game the student body has no right to make any objection, for the blame rests with them and not with the Athletic Board. Athletic teams and athletic seasons can not be successful without a sound financial backing. There are yet ten gatnes to be played and five of these are to be played on the campus. There are two track meets coming off and in order for all of the above to be successes every man must pay up his tax at once. •,. i: \ ''

Union defeated the University of Vermont base ball team on the campus on Monda.r, April 28, in an exciting garne. Davis, the Vermont and Devoe, the Union pitcher, both did excellent work. Odwell fut· Union played the best all-round game. His fielding was especially fine as several tirnes l1e spoiled what seetned to be safe bits. Mahar played a fine gatne at short stop. O'Brien, the right-fielder, was struck on the forearm wh i.e h resulted in a split bone and so had to be retired. Paige was substituted in his place. rrhe sum·mary is as follows: UNIV. OF VT. A. B.

Eddy's resignation takes place in June. The many friends of, Prof. Eddy at the college,. while regreting his departure frotn Schenectady, will be gratified at the advancen1ent wh kh this change tneans. The University of Cincinnati was recently reorganized, a new location and new building·s in the suburbs of Cincinnati secured and extensive addition~ to its endow- ment received. Its students number about r ,300. Its faculty numbers 150 and it has a productive endowment of about three and one~ half million dollars.

Griffith, 'oz, spent a few days at his home in Watertown last week. Peck, '03 and Q.!.1inn, 'o5, spent Saturday and Sunday at vVilliatnstown, Mass. The regular n1eeting of the trustees of the college was held on Tuesday. The sophon1ores defeated tr,e juniors in base ball 0'1 Tuesday afternoon by a score of 5 to 4· The freshmen base ball team was defeated by the R. P. I. freshmen by a score of 12 to o on April 26. Invitations are out to a reception and dance to be given by the Chi Psi fraternity in Nott Mernorial Hall on May 15. At the Y. JvL C. A. meeting on Tuesday evening the subject of settlernent work was dis- cussed and the feasibility of undertaking such work here. It vvas decided upon and a number of men pledged themselves to begin the vvork.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS. AT THE LAW SCHOOL. Badger, '03, has returned to school after a long and serious illness. A cotntnittee of the senior class is arranging for a class banquet. The seniors .are having their class pictures taken by Gustav Lorey of Albany. Parr, '03, entertained the \ Devil's Own\ on the 25th of April at the Abbey Hotel, Glenmont. Judge Tennant returned to the juniors on the 2rst of April, taking up the subject of Sales, and was heartily received by all, being a universal favorite. Dr. E. P. Johnson of the First Reforn1ed church of .i\.lbany, will preach the annual sermon to the graduating class on Saturday, May 25th. The Delta Chi fraternity has removed to 301 Hamilton street, while Phi Delta Phi's has vacated their Swan street home and are ten1porarily lodged at\ The Tub.\ It may be noted in passing that four out of nine of the 'Varsity base ball teatn are juniors at the Law School, viz. : Odwell, lb. ; Nicholas Devoe, p.; Milton Devoe, 2b., and O'Brien, r. f. This certainly speaks well for the athletic ability of the Law School men, particularly as not one of these men has ever played on any college team before. The Appellate Division (juniors) has returned the following decisions : Jones, Respondent, vs. Roe, Appellant. Mills & Foster, for Appellant, Cassellas & Guardineer, for Respondent. Lawless, P. J. reads for affirmative. All concur. Blair, Appellant, vs. McFarlan, Respondent. Lawless & Hotaling, for Respondent. Guard- ineer & Dyer, for Appellant. Thomas, P. J ., reads for reversal and judgment absolute against defendant on the pleadings. All concur. The Annual Circular of Information, which is in fact an illustrated catalogue of the school, has just con1e from the printer's hands and Secretary Davidson deserves great credit for the neat appearance of the parnphlet. Besides the usual matter detailing the course of study, the bar examination rules and the catalogue of students, the book et contains very fine full-page porb·aits of Chief Judge Parker, honorary chancellor of the university, Dr. Raymond, chancellor and president of the college, and President Parker of the Board of Trustees of the school. The officers of the recently organized alumni association 'are set forth, as are the chapter rolls of the Phi Delta Phi and the Delta Chi fraternities. According to this book, the school graduated 36 men with the degree of LL. B., and 23 men without the degree, in the class of 1901, or 59 in all. There are at present 2 graduate students, 78 seniors and 55 juniors, a total of 135. BASE BALL SCHEDULE FOR THE REMAINDEQ OF THE SEASON. May 3-Colgate University on the campus. May 5-Schenectady Y.

,:.; i l I THE CONCORDIENSIS. 13 \ME AN' OTIS.\ A Play Given by the Students. The Cercle Comique of Union CoHege pre- sented the four act comedy Me an' Otis at the Van CU;~ler on the evening of April 28 to large and interested ~udience. The presentation of this humorous comedy of college life was very successful and the various actors and '' actresses \ deserve great credit for their efforts. It is the first tin1e that anything of such pretentious in the dramatic line has been atten1pted, and it is to be si~cerely hoped that in the future dramatics will be a pern1anent feature in the activities of the college year. With such a promising amount ot material as the nucleus, a successful dramatic a~sociation should be forn)oed as soon as possible. It is difficult to com mend any particular man for his work in this play without slighting the others, as this feature of the presentation was so unitormly excellent as an amateur pet·formance. The difficult and eccentric role of '' Rosilla\ was interpreted with great spirit by Mr. Wagner, and Guardenier kept the audience amused with his portrayal of a henpecked farmer. Cool and Clark acted the parts of the two dissimHar students with cleverness, Donnan and Ellenwood were two most lovable damsels, while Fiero made a capital hired man. The minor parts were well filled, and the costuming and '' make-ups\ were in all cases adequate to a professional production. It is the intention of those in charge of the play to repeat it at the Van Cur1er at an early date, and in that event, it can be recommend to all who desit·e to spend an enjoyable evening, watching the funny endeavors of the boys to act the parts of girls, and finding out how much real dramatic talent there is in the student bodv. ., \ DRAMATIS PERSONJE. ..

No. 25. the culture of individual life, the development of the tnan in all that is essentially worthy, and .PRESIDENT RAYMOND AT COLGATE UNIVERSITY. TheOrator·at the Patrons' Day Exercises. The Madisoniensis, the Colgate weekly, con- tains in its last· issue a picture of President Ray- mond and the full text of the oration delivered by him before the faculty and students of Col- gate University on Patrons' Day, April 25. The address was on '' The Mission of the · to this end the college must offer young man- hood ambitious to make the most of life the , 1 tninistry of the best thoughts, the noblest ideals, the purest sentiments the most refined sym- pathies. But the development of the individual American College.\ from the address : Below are some extracts \ has an end beyond his own enrichment, as no man liveth to h in1self. The influence of educa- tion must reach beyond the culture of the individual soul, beyond the charmed circle of scholarly tastes and satisfaction and touch those : 'larger interests of the comn1unity and of ''In this address I do not propose to dwell upon the importance of higher education in general. The worth of broad knowledge, of ' trained powers of thought, of cultured sympathies and refined sensibilities needs no emphasis in the company of the educated. 'l'he first mission of the college is to deve op life-life which is more than meat ; to unfold those capacities and powers which clothe human nature with dignity and honor. The great end of life is its own in- crease, more life, abundant life., iust as the prophecy of the blade is the full corn in the ear. The educated n1an inherits this promise of life itself and is blessed with keener vision, with broader sympathies, with deeper experiences. This liberty of life is the birthright of humanity. · When Channing said ' He is to be educated he- cause he is a man and not because he is to make shoes and nails and pins,' he gave forcible ex- pression to the underlying principles of all educational work. Its value is not to be estimated by the standards of gross utilitarianism but by its influence upon man himself. Because the life is more than meat its own expansion and enrichment is the eupreme good. Not until we appreciate this reflex influence of . quickened intelligence, this ennobling of essential manhood, can we understand the price· less value of what is called ' a liberal education .• \ humanity upon which the progress of ciziliza- Hon depends. If education does not do this then it is but the development of a culture, an intellectual aristocracy, self-satisfied in its en- joyment of exclusive previleges which like every other aristocracy is hostile to the general good,\ ''If the American College has any distinctive ·mission it is determined by the conditions and aims of our national life, for the college must ever be the servant of the state. This is indeed fundamental to a true conception of its broader work. It is not an independent institution existing for its own sake nor for the sake of science or of culture in the abstract, but an integral part of the nation, identified with its interests and charged with its welfare. This connection is not determined by statute for it is vital rather than legal. It is not determined by state patronage for the true American College is as tnuch a private enterprise as is any other t. '' corpora ton. ''Now the first condition of good govern- ment is the ability and character of the govern- ing class. In popular government the govern- ing class is the numerical majority of the citizens. Whatever arbitrary power may be assumed and exercised~for a time by individuals '' The aim of the college is therefore primarily and factions, ultimately the people assert their authority and the rule of the majority is not only J the theory but the fundamental fact of our

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. national life. This at least has been established by our history of m:ore than a hundred years, and it indicates the direction and aim of the service which the college is to render the state.\ \ It remains for us now to indicate son1e of the specific lines of influence which the college must follow in its general mission to American citizens. First of all the curriculum· of studies should in- clude subjects which are concerned not only in- directlybutdirectly witn governmentalquestions. I indicated at the beginning the general influence of education in enlarging the horizon of :life by developing the tnind, training the faculties, in- creasing know ledge, so that one acquires ability to take broad and comprehensive views. This is essential to the h ain1ng of the citizen and puts practical emphasis upon the general disciplinary and culture studies of the regular coL.ege course, and we need not be surprised that some regard it as all sufficient. Doubtless it is more itnportant than any specific line of instruction in public affairs, for without in- tellectual grasp and broad sympathies the rnere technicalities of instruction are shorn of tnuch of their value ; but given the general education, specific instruction is needed for highest efficiency. These two tenns, education and in- struction are enough in thetnselves perhaps to define the distinction which we wish to make. While the one suggests the unfolding of innate powers the other suggests the informing of the mind. While the one developes ability the other seeks to direct ability to practical ends. The training of the citizen calls for the use of both of these preparatory means for usefulness. We therefore claim a place in the college curri- culum for the subjects directly connected with civic duties and the science of government. This means more than the introduction of a course in so-called practical politics, although such a course may well be included, but beyond this it demands a ~tudy of sociology, economics, and in other broad outlines at least constitutional history and international law, and I am inclined to add diplomatic and consular duties. Knowledge of all these subjects is essential to the discharge of the highest functions of citizen- ship, especially on the part of those who by reason of superior advantages are fitted for leadership in their several communities, mtould ing the thoughts and guiding the energies of others in civil and social affairs. We would have these subjects taught in every college, not to a group of specialists. in political science but as a part of the training which the college offers to all its students in the fulfilhnent of its tnission to the state. There is one subject which I have not mentioned but which is perhaps the most important of .all when rightly taught, history. When this is treated as it is in some colleges as the story of human progress the history of civilization, in fact, showing the introduction and gradual unfolding of governmental and econotnic principles, it becomes in itself a liberal education in the rights and duties, the limitation and prorogatives oi modern citizen- ship.\ \Closely allied with this spirit of democracy, as fundamental to manly character, is the sense oi honor which indicates a further duty to the American College. The tendency of a materialistic age is toward the deprecation of spiritual qualities. Visible, tangible, sensuous success is the controlling atnbition. ' The sense of honor' as Addison says, ' is so fine and delicate a nature that it is only to be meet with in n1inds which are naturally noble or in such as have been cultivated by great examples or a refined education.' The school of honor is not the market place nor the battlefield but the environment of great thoughts and noble characters. It is the product of reverence, of the spirit of worship as Etnerson has taught. 'Honor exists for hin1 who always recognizes the neighborhood of the great, always feels him- self in the presence of high causes.' . · The college as the conservator of honor must quicken it by the steady influence of its own high ideals and exalted life. This suggests the influence not of books so much as of tnen, the ahnosphere of strong personality, the touch of noble character.\ Ex-Captain Gould of Yale, has been secured to coach Amherst's foot ball team next season.

Knowing the get~eral interest of Union men in Prof. Opdyke, who is now on leave, :the editors are glad to be able to publish the follow- ing letter descriptive of a trip fro1n Ziidch toward Rome, at Eastertime : ON BOARD THE ST. GOTTHARD TRAIN, March 1.5, 1902. DEAR-- Yo\1 may be interested to know that I am definltely settled now at the University of Ziirich for the rest of my stay in Europe. I am sorry for other towns and universities, hut Prof. Weber says that I may start my arbeit when the spr1·ng semester opens. This definitely stops my notion of favoring ?ther communities with n1y presence. All fooli.ng aside, this means that I atn so relieved that I wouldn't go to work again at the bottom' of another prof's ladder for two and twenty farms. And so I am celebrating by a little trip into Italy. The train skirted along the east bank of 01e Lake of Uri, or the lower arm of Lake Lucerne, and the hills look like the Hudson Highlands, wlth every now and then a snow peak through a ga P• I wanted to get out at Fluellen and go up to Altdorf. Maybe I shall on my way back. Then we seemed to climb a mountain gorge. Very .snowy, ragged peaks on either side that threatened to break off at any moment, You know a bout the curved tunnels and zig-zags, to .say nothing of the .great tunnel of St. Gotthard. Well, the biggest thing is the speed the train keeps up all the way through. Now we are coasting down toward Chiasso, on the frontier, where we pile out with our baggage. A couple of cars back there is a large crowd in the third class coach, spreading out luxuriously on both sides of the corridor. There acompanyof jol:ly, fat, fur-coated, roly-poly old 1nen with long white beards or gnarled mustaches, are going down to ·Monte Carlo I guess, to grow young again. Over the border now, and back in the train again. The stylish Italian officers loolH~d in my waistcoat for cigars. At first I thought he wanted me to give him one to smoke. It is alwavs safer not to understand anything disagreeable that people say to you. I shall have to try to speak French now; and try as I will, I shall talk German, '' H abcn sie ein Vioture .~ Je veux nach--aller. '' Sunday-! am pushing on to Florence this after- noon, rolling along the fertile plains of Lombardy. Think of the countless hordes of men who have swarmed up and down this very plain 1 Gauls,. Romans, Germans, Huns, Vandals, Goths-·and the steady tran1p northward of the legions, with Roman laws and gods for all of Western Europe. The plain continues, not a curve in the track and Pavia half a mile from it. Alongside the river's hroad beds of gravel-sandy white, threaded hy the bluest of blue ribbons. Overhead a warm blue sky, with a :sort of brown haze on the horizon. We are entering the Apennines now and night is shutting down. . * * * * * * \Bagni della Poretta \-The meon is shining and we are right in the midst of the hills. They look like the Adirondacks, big boulder-like, quiet, with the tops in a soft mantle of mist beneath the moonshine.. There is even the strong, deep, steady music of a waterfall to complete the like- ness of the situation to that near Phillips Lock on the Black R. canal where we snuggled right up close to the bare breast of the grave, serene, mountain and were lulled to gentle sleep by the splasping waters of the spill-way.

The track meet between Rutgers and Union will come off at Ridgefield in Albany on Satur- day, 1\tlay ro. Ridgefield has been put in first class condition for the meet.

8 THE CONC'ORDIENSIS. THE F:OOT BALL SCHED'U<LE. Below is given the foot ball schedule for the season of 1902 as it stands at present. Manager Gould is to be congratulated on the number of good gan1es secured. He is still arranging dates for further games. Thii schedule is in- complete anq of course, subject to change: Oct. 4·_;Corne11 at Ithaca. Oct. f 1.-An1herst at Amherst. Oct. I8.-Rochester at Schenectady. Oct. 25.-Laureate at Schenectady. Nov. I .-Lehigh at Schenectady. Nov. 8.-· West Point at West Point. Nov. 15.-Vermont at Burlington. Nov. 22.-N. Y. Univ. at N.Y. :R. P. I. vs. UNION. Game Lost to Trojans. Poor batting tells the story of the defeat by R. P. I. With a substitue outfield and a crippled infield Union held R. P. I. down until the fatal ninth. Had Mahar had good consistent support he would have won his game handily. This gan1e should stimulate the batting practise as with proper batting the game would have been won. R. P. I. took the lead in the second and third innings scoring once in each inuing. The fourth was Union's inning. Griswold hit, Grout sacrificed, M. Devoe drove out a long hit for two bags, Griswold scoring. Odwell brought M. Devoe in on a sacrifice. Bradley scored a two bagger, stole third, scored on Mahar's hit. In the ·eighth inning with three men on bases, no outs, Mahar pitched good ball, strikit g one man out and the other two fl. ying out. The gan1e was won by a two-base hit by Wirth, the R. P. I. catcher. N. Devoe pitched two innings when he was badly hurt by a pitched baH which struck him on the head. He pluckily tried to pitch the next inning but was too dizzy and was retired to the bench. The summary is as follows : UNION. A. B. R. lB. P.O. A. E.

The western trip of the base ball team scheduled for May 30 and 31 when Union was to have played Hobart and Rochester, re- spectively, has been abandoned on account of the disbanding of Hobart's team. Manager Bloch has arranged that the game with the General Electric Test should be played May 30 instead of May 10 on account of the track meet with Rutgers. A game has also been arranged with R. P. I. for May 3 I to be played at Albany. . I . ·,, I .,.·, .. ;.; l .;· .~: I >. ~ . ·· .. , ' ~ '• , .... '• i

Shaw, 'o2, has been called home on account of the serious illness of his ·mother. Parsons, 'o2, has recovered from an attack of typhoid fever and is making recitations. The senior class appeared for the first time on Monday n1orning in caps and gowns. The game with Colgate scheduled for last Saturday had to be called off on account of . ratn. The trials for thP junior and sophomore oratoricals was held in the chapel on Thursday 0 evening. The Chi Psi convention will be held under the auspices of the Union chapter on May 14, 15 and r6. Samuel D. Paltner, 'o4, has been selected as leader ot the Mandolin club for next year, and the tnandolin music for the Comtnencement con- cert will consequently be under his direction. The election of an assistant foot ball manager will occur on 1\1onday morning. The candi- dates from the sophotnore class who have registered for this position are Sherrill, Cool and Guardenier. Prof. Ashmore was present at the meeting held in New York on Thursday a·nd Friday of the managing committee of the American school of classical studies at Rome and the American school of classical studies at Athens. Rutledge, 'o4, had the 1nisfortune to fall upon his ann breaking it just above the wrist 'vhile high-jumping on the track on Monday afternoon. He is now confined to his rootn. His loss will be felt by tne track teatn for he was one of the best high jutnpers for the Rutgers meet on Saturday. The trustees of the college at their meeting held recently accepted the gift of $4o,ooo which Mt. Andrew Catnegie n1ade for the ren1odeling of Nott Memorial Hall into a library. The Hon. Judson S. Landon and Silas B. Brownell, '52, were appointed a committee to prepare acknowledments. Another committee was chosen to settle upon the details for the com- pletion of the. building. It is expected that the ~ork will be begun soon. THE ALUMNI COLUMN. Interesting News About Union Graduates.

'59.-The Rev. ,George Martin Wiley who died of arterial sclerosis on April 15 at his home West Hebron, N.Y., was born at Putnam, N. Y., in 1830. He was graduated from Union College under Dr. Nott in r859, and from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1862. He entered the ministry of the United Presbyterian church and his first pastorate was at Ryegate, Vt., where he remained five years. In r868 he was called to the United Presbyterian church of vVest Hebron. This pastorate continued through more than thirty-three years of active service to October z8, 1901, when he offered his resignation. He was a tnetnber of the Phi Beta Kappa society. '99.-Harrison K. Wright \\tvho is well-known in this vicinity has recently been ordained by the Elizabeth {N. J.) Presbytery and been granted a license for the 1ninistry.

Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. 1872 and 1877. In this issue is given the list of the mem- bers in the classes of 1872 and 1877. The class of 1872 will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary and the class of 1877 its twenty-fifth in June. Both of these classes were for some reason small, but the lists contain many names that have since become well-known in various walks of life. Caps and The senior class is to be congratulated for the position they have taken in Gowns. regard to the wearing of caps and gowns. It was decided by the class at a meeting held in the winter term that the class would wear caps and gowns at the first college meeting in May. This the class as a whole has done except on the part of three or four individuals. The dress distinguishes the seniors from the other classes and is a dignified and scholarly-appearing apparel. It only remains for each man in the class to be consistent and wear the dress while on the hill from now on through commencement week . The Senior Class Book. The committee having in charge the getting up and publishing of the Senior Class :Book have been at work for some time trying to ascertain where they could publish the most novel and best class book. Late developments have shown that there is a great lack of spirit among- many men in the class who will not agree to take books and not from any financial reason either. This lack of spirit in 1902 is very unusual as the class has always been noted for the splendid support given to class enterprizes as well as college organizations. So far only about twenty-five men ,out of forty have agreed to take books. What is the matter with these fifteen men? A man doesn't graduate but once with 1902 from Union and it seems as if he . .. \ certainly would wish to own a copy of the class book gotten out upon that occasion. The committee finds that it costs more to get out twenty-five books than it would forty, for this they are not re&ponsi- ble. It was thought best, in order to reduce the cost of the book as much as possible, to omit the pictures of the faculy. To this a few men seriously objected and cancelled their orders should this be done. To this it may be said that the committee's object was to make the book as distinctly a clflSS book as possible, and to this end they proposed to omit the faculty pictures and substitute some valuable statistics and questions much in vogue in other college class books. And in reference to the faculty pictures it will be found upon examination that very few senior classes at other colleges put in the faculty pictures. The idea is distinctly passe. Wake up seniors, are you goit1g to let your class spirit die out at a time when it s-hould be at its best? Seven thousand one hundred dollars has been pledged by the students of Brown University for a new building.

CoN coR.DIENSIS, Single Copies, TERMS.: $2.00 per Year, in Advance 10 Cents Address all communications to THE CoNCORDI- ENSIS, Silliman Hall, Schenectady, N. Y. Entered a.t the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Oha.s . .Burrows, Printer, 414: State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. The college was grieved to learn on last Friday forenoon of the death of Charles Guy Vernooy of the freshman class. Mr. Vernooy had been very ill for some time in the Ellis Hospital having been taken there some time ago when his case became serious. He died from an unsually severe attack of brain fever. Mr. Vernooy's home was in Ellenville, N. Y., and he is survived by a mother and a brother. All college exercises for the freshman class were suspended on Friday and the class held a meeting and decided to send a suitable floral piece and one member of the class to accompany his body. A short chapel service was held on Saturday morning just before his body was taken to the station. Mr. Verno<>y was taking the Latin-scientific course and was very ambitious, applying himself closely to his work. The student body, the college and friends extend to his bereaved relatives their heart- felt sympathy. Classes of 1882 and 1887. The editoTs take pleasure in giving in this issue the names, fraternities, honors, records and addresses of the members of the classes of 1882 and 1887. These classes being relatively recent as compared with the older classes, should succeed in holding large and enthusiastic reunions during Commencement week. The old Blue Gate stands wide ever ready to receive back all sons of Old Union. The Rutgers Meet. The meet with Rutgers held in Albany on Saturday sh<>wed that Union's track team was ()Ue to be proud of. The men under the consistent training of Coach Thompson showed up fi.uely and but for the inclemency of the weather more college record~ would undoubtedly have been broken. Griffith established a new record for the 120-yard hurdle at 17 seconds, formerly 17 3-5, made on May 28, 1898 by LeRoy J. Weed, 1901, the captain of last year's track team. The time in the 220-yard hurdle was good though not up to the record. Finegan's hammer throw of 95 feet 10 inches was good. Parker's unfortunate fall in the mile-run was disastrous for Union as he stood every chance to come in second thereby changing the score in Union's favor. \: , \ ~0 +\ 1-i )....- ~ l.-\ '-\- Union won 6 first places and one lr'e, and l- second places, while Rutgers succeeded in winning ;J;..!i r~-tL\': 5 first places with one tie and 7 second places. l:\ ~ With such a showing as Union put up it is hoped v * that another meet can be arranged this season giving an opportunity to the men to further show their ability. In fact, this seemed the fault with the team, if there was any, namely, their lack of experience in meeting an opposing team rather than practice. Columbia University is to have a daily news- paper next year for the first time in her history. 'l' ~ . ' I ; ' ' j ; ; '

RAYMOND, FRANK I. LosEE, LERoY L. ODELL, Com. :RUTGERS-UNION MEET. Qutgers Wins by 4 Points. Union's track team tnet the track team of Rutge:s College on Saturday, May 10, at Ridgefield in Albany. 1'he meet was an un- certainty from the start to the finish and it re- quired close figuring to decide the meet even at the last. Union took forty-six out of a possible ninety-six points. The high wind precluded anything like fast time in the longer runs whe1 e it was necessary to run against it. The Union College record in the I20 yard hurdle race was broken by Captain Griffith, who ran it in an even I 7 seconds, the record being 17 3-5 seconds and held by L. J. Weed, 'oi. The tirners caught the time of Van Nuis, the Rutgers sprinter, at nine and three-tifths seconds, but it is very doubtful whether it would be con- ceded that the Rutgers man equalled the world's record haYing as he did, a driving wind at his back. The events and the successful men are as follows:. Ioo~yard dash-Won by Van Nuis, R.; second, Elmendorf, R. Time, 9 3-5 seconds. 120-yard hurdle-Won by Griffith, U.; second, Leary, R.

Running broad jump-Won by Pearce, U. ; second, Rooney, U. Distance, r8 feet 8 inches. Shot-put-vVon by Cleghorn, U.; second, Moon, R. Distance, 34 feet 9 inches. 22o-yard dash- Ehnendorf, R., and Van Nuis, R., tied. Time, 23 seconds. Ham.mer throw-Won by Finegan, U. ; second, Donnan, U. Distance, 95 feet ro inches.

Cornell's Athletic Council has approved of the Princeton-Cornell athletic meet as arranged for May 27 at Albany. Darttnouth won the fi.rst annual triangular meet of Darttnouth, Brown and M. I. T.

Mahar received a split finger and had to be retired fron1 the game. Bradley, center fielder, on account of injuries was kept out ot the game entirely, likewise an injury to 0' Brien received some time ago necessitates his retirement for the present.
