®NG®RDIBNSIS. VoL. XXIII. TJNION COLLEGE, MARCH 1, 1900. No. 19. THE AESTHETIC CHARMS OF EUROPEAN TRAVEL. 'I'hecourteous requestofTheConcordiensis for an article on tny recent trip, put me in a reverie. There floated before me a vision tnade up of limitless sea, towering Alp, castled crag, vine- clad slopes, massive cathedral, stately abbey, fairy chateau, and intricate patterns of populous n1edireval towns flnng over plain and vale and mountain side, and bound together by a network of gleatning rivers, shrine-ornan1ented roads and winding hedge-rows. But of all that dreatn I can here record only one series of reflections that answer to the query, proposed by myself to tnyself, \What was the supreme chann of it all?\ Many reasons, doubtless, can be given for the interest in European travel. It meets the desire for radical change. The instant one is aboard ship he tnust conform to a new regime. He is cut off from custotnary associations and custotnary modes of living, and must begin a series of adaptations that con- stitute a new life. Throughout his tour a kaleidoscopic variety of scenes will keep his tuind fully but not vexatiously occupied with compari- sons, readjustment of views and endeavors to determine what is best. The fact th~tt this change can be had for less than the cost of a tour of equal length in the United States, where the utmost stretch of nail brings alteration in natural scenery but almost none in any other respect, constitutes an inde- pendent attraction. Economy is served by the choice of Et,1rope. To change of surroundings is added change of conceptions. No adequate idea of the solernn and rapid flight of time can be gained save where walls, highways, buildings, are tnonuments of down-trodden generations of rulers, thinkers, artists, whose spirits gather like clouds of wit- nesses and urge the wisest use of time. Com- paratively few realize the direct advantage of university education abroad, but to every traveler comes the indirect influence of surroundings in thetnselves essentiallv educational. .~ Only the very smallest number are drawn to Europe for purposes of dissipation in the freer life of its capitals, where custom and law are the protectors and eve~ promoters of unhallowed pleasures. The few who are caught in the tnad current are usually ruined very quickly. The greater nutnber of American visitors become only occasional spectators of follies that disgust by their very excess, and with eYery door wide open and nearly every guide an agent they walk the dangerous paths protected by their Anglo- Saxon training which has given then1 self- mastery. Of those who go for health, most obtain benefit through change, not through specific treatment. Men who fancy that business cannot spare thetn, escape that delusion and give their· tired brains a respite, when they are separated from their office by three thousand miles of sea; and hav- ing realized once that they can pron1ote their success more by nine months of vigorous tban by twelve of languid exertion, they turn a single prescription into a rule of life. Women who are indisposed to outdoor exercise, who cannot see the co11nection between physical activity and health, but believe in the infinite virtue of drugs, become the despair of their physicians and are sent to Europe to get unconsciously what they refuse to take when it is expressly ordered. Impelled by curiosity in sight-seeing, or by shop- ping instincts, or ambition for a record in clitnb- ing or some novel experience, they will take, in the course of every twenty-four hours, an amount of exercise that would be simply appalling if it were prescribed as such. But in too many cases of ill health, Europe becomes the last prescription, a forlorn hope, a

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ten1porary abstraction of thought from the con- templation of inevitable decline and death. To one who recognizes this condition, as he walks ! the steam,ship deck and looks at the paling face and wasting form, the vessel seems one of · Charon's fleet. Still a little brightening of the sky at sunset is something to welcome. The great tnass who in the summer months tax the full capacity of the trans-atlantic lines are not special students, nor invalids, nor over- wrought natures, but seekers of change, especi- ally change from the crude to the finished, from the coarse to the refined, fron1 the purely utili- tarian to the artistic. In European cities the sky-line is broken by spires and domes and gables of an infinite diver- sity of pattern. Every building has a striking and a beautiful individuality like a person with a character and a history. Prodigious masses of stone are flung up toward the heavens in the cathedrals and so richly beset with carvings that they seem to have burst into tnidsutnmer efflor- escence. Of the 1nunicipal buildings some rise from massive bases, through skilful gradations of sculptured walls to the airiest and most feath- ery pinnacles, others low and spreading are dominated by a huge clock tower ot imposing pattern, from whose tnagic casements pour forth the quarter chimes like songs of birds awaking in rapturous joy, while at the end comes the deep ominous roar of the finished hour as if all the buried past awoke to claim fresh prey and with hoarse voice to vaunt its victory. The palaces of justice seem embodiments in stone of the loftiness and grandeur of law. The richly decorated and spacious opera-houses carry invitation and protnise of refined enjoyment in their very appearance. Last but chief are the endlessly varied private dwellings, each constructed to fit its particular site in hannony with its fellows and to express the individual taste of its builder. Those grace- ful gables and oriels, those carved beams and decorated panels-what delight they awaken, and how it is increased by glitnpses of a court reinforcing the exterior beauty by tiers of con- ~entric balconies, yin~-tr~l1is~d~ decorated with bust of hero, or tigur~ of sylph, ~nd touched by rich hues cast from some swinging Venetian lantern ! How well do I recall the fascination which held me to Nuremberg, how for eight days I \Vandered abcut its crooked streets,, and crossed the numerous bridges that span the rapid Pegnitz, arid loitered by the moat, study- ing towers, walls, house-fronts in light and in shadow in a perfect intoxi~cation of delight, or how at Lucerne a single oriel drew me daily as a worshipper at a shrine, or how at Kenilworth the very ruins of such brought back all the \argent revelry\ of the England of Elizabeth. What uniformity of dull architectural effects reigns in our own cities, until we cease to lift our eyes, or what sheer ugliness causes us to cry out in pain ! Brussels, on the contrary, protects itself by aspecial cotnmittee and will not suffer its fine vistas to be spoiled through the coarse taste or niggardliness of the individual builder. Sotne of our streets simply repeat an originally unlovely plan through a series of fresh deformations to a clim.ax of hideousness. Some of our houses have the blank stare of fortress-v.ralls, and cross-bows or blunderbusses projecting from the embrasures would be more congruous than any traces of domesticity. Bay windows, probably bought at an auction, are tacked on to house-fronts with which they harmonize as well as a dress coat would with a pair of overalls. Even the stl'aw thatches of the Black Forest, or of Shottery cottages, the forn1er drooping low, the latter curving over bays to shut out glare, or grace- fully rising and retreating to let in sunlight else- where, suggest \ measureless content '' within, and harmonize perfectly with the outdoor world of grass and tree and bird-life. The very tiles and chimney pots of English houses are beauti- ful and some carved house-fronts are an out-door museum of art. Another aesthetic contrast is furni5hed by clean streets-a result secured in Dresden by scrubbing pavements as house- floors-by smooth, hard roads bordered with shade trees or protected along precipitous edges by stone parapets; by the paving and curbing of channels of strean1s as at V evey ; by the pro- vision of dainty chalets of glass and iron as waiting rooms for tram-car passengers in l3rus- I i l

I i l THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 sels ; by the er.ection of graceful electric light standards, as at Wiesbaden, from which the globes depend like drooping fruit, in place of our knotted and warped poles with transverse arms like a gallows.; by the seizure of points of vantage such as heights, or river, or lake mar- gins for prornenades and the training over the broad esplanades of the branches of trees until they interlace in a continuous roof through which the light traces a graceful tnosaic on the walk beneath. Perhaps nothing more fully illustrates the strength of the art instinct than the character of the little hotels. For seven francs a day one could not, in our country, expect more than barren shelter and tnere prolongation of life. 1\'his is what it will procure in Switzerland : a terraced flower garden among vineyards, vvith a dozen shady nooks, and two surruuer-houses, one flanked by graceful statues, the other orna- tnented with a delicate ceiling painting fit for a parlor; a spacious dining roon1 with windows opening on Alpine sunsets and walls decorated by Italian artists, with garlanded nymphs fratned in arabesques; sleeping rooms provided with balconies that command views of verdured slopes, quaint towers, blue lake, and scarred heights tenninating in the roseate snow-sprinkled front of the Deut du Mz\dl; nutritious food in appetizing form; the prompt, quiet, and intelligent service that banishes irritation ; a library of high-class works in English, French and Russian ; a drawing room where conver- sation is a refreshment and an education. But for the saving grace of the hills to be climbed, the gorges to be explored, and the sails to be taken, enough, to make one fall into self- condemnation, for a pleasing vice known among Methodists as ''softness and needless self-in- dulgence.\ The sn1allest towns of Europe have tnuseutns not yet possessed by the largest American cities. Opera is with u& in general a fitful recreation ·Confined to a day or a week out of a whole year, and offered at prices practically prohibitive for the tnasses. In Europe it is sustained by the State for educational reasons. One dollar will buy the best seat in the house at Dresden, and thirty-five cents will buy one still better. In the public squares of German cities military bands play daily the .compositions of the gtieatest masters. A single tnark will procure one an entire evening of instrumental or vocal ,music of the highest class in Berlin,. and in some cities like Leipsic the population seem unified by music as by nothing else .. In the matter of dress mote is probably spent here than there, but the defter European touch produces rarer effects from sitnple materials and infe:te time, which is often, for saints were numerous once, streets, parks, and cafes are art galleries vivified. The effect of attire is enhanced by captivating manners. The polite request takes the place of the brusque command; voice, look, and rnoven1ent harmonize. Gentletnen raise hats to gentletnen, and pause and stand uncovered in the busy streets when the £uneral cortege pa&ses. In Gennan territory the rnulti- tudinous Mahlzeits and Gute Nachts, n1ake one think he eats or sleeps attended by the good will of all mankind. Ordinary business suffers change into some- thing beautiful. How prosaic is a butcher shop ! and yet one with tiled walls, and burnished scales, and hams trimn1ed with tissue and tinsel, and legs of mutton done up in curl papers, and butcher in faultless white, has a chann sufficient to arrest the passer. Before a Dresden sausage shop I have lingered a full quarter of an hour captivated by the variety of patterns in which minced .meat can be arranged. Some of the shops that charmed me infinitely displayed nothing more retnarkable than kitchen utensils, or Dutch stoves made of tiles, or a wrought iron sign in which a dragon curved in an arabesque caught from profiles of flowers and leaves and blosso1ns. I am proud of American energy. I like the rush and feverish excitement even of our life, but I find a coarseness, and sordidness that is too n1uch with us at times ; and the satne instinct that drives me out on pedestrian tours over bad roads to catch the faint blue outlines of distant mountains, or makes tne tread lonely woodland trails for the joy of seeing sunlight sifted through forest leaves and gilding masses

I know perfectly that all this luxuriance of art will be ours some day. Our land will be a garden and a vast art gallery, and· a syn1phony wh.en son1e of the centuries ahead have fallen into the rear. Our magnificent scenery, our colossal energies, our noble manhood, our great creat- iveness that finds now its point of application in rnaterial progress, presage it and assure it. T'he titne will come, when, as by some miracle of . sunset the ray& of light transform the whole clouded heavens into vast fields of beauty, the glory of art will transfigure American life. The treasures that are in the homes of the fortunate few will be given to the public, and the refl.ex of them will be found in the comn1onest feabn~es of our daily existence. But my generation will not witness it. For us there is but one retnedy, and that is- EUROPE. JAMES R. TRUAX. UNION AT THE STANFOQD ~ECEPTION.

Mr. Rowe was a '96 man, and Mr. Cumtnings valedictorian of '97· \There is now passing through the press a work on the Silurian and Devonian systems of central and eastern New York, by Professor Prosser. This report which is based on field work conducted by Prof. Prosser during his four years' connection with the State Survey as Assistant Geologist, will appear in the Seven- teenth Annual Report of the State Geologist of New York, and willtnake a book of sotne 400 pages illustrated with one hundred or more half-tones, n1aps and sections. The volume will also contain two joint papers by Prof. Pt·osser and his graduate students ; one with R.

CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, TERMS: $2. 00 per Year, in Advance 10 Cents Address all communications to THE CONCORDI- ENSIS, Box 213, Schenectady, N. Y. Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second· class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 4:14 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THE PROPOSITION explained in another column, to change the football rules so that none but actual players shall be within the ropes, is certainly a scheme worthy of adoption. Union men, especi- ally, recognize the need of a rule of this nature. A certain flagrant violation of the existing rule on our own campus during the past season forcibly points out to us the necessity of the adoption of some more iron-clad regulation. Fair play in con- tests seems at times to be forgotten while courtesy is disregarded and abused. Cornell dealt right- eously with a coach from another New York state college who abused his rights during the early part of the season. Colutnbia experienced a bitter taste of breach of courtesy in the Princeton game, when a Princeton substitute saved the Yale game to his eleven by running out on the field and tell- ing the time left to play. When courtesy and fair play do not prevail, it is necessary to remove the means of their disregard. Union earnestly ad vo- cates this timely proposition to remedy existing conditions. THE CONDITION of the college Young Men's Ch.dstrian association calls for favorable comment and commendation. At the present time :there is no undergraduate organization on a firmer basis, aHd this excellent condition is the result of faithful interest and unceasing labor on the part of all the members and in particular, of the officers who have served during the past year. Within the association there have been carried into effect many changes, and every innovation has strength- , ened the organization. The improved condition of the association is outwardly manifest in the interest in and attendance at, the two regular meetings; the midweek service on Tuesday evenings, and the Sunday afternoon vesper service. Through the efforts of the Y. M. C. A., the students have had ' fr01n time to time the pleasure of listening to clergy- tnen of this and other places, while the classes in Bible study have been of great profit to those who have enjoyed metnbership in then1. In short, every phase of theY. M. C. A. work has been enjoying a healthy g-rowth, which we hope will be continued under the new set of officers; for with the new Y. M. C. A. building on our catnpus this branch of undergraduate activity must have a still larger place in the student life. NEW Y. M. C. A. OFFICEQS. The weekly meeting of the college Y. M. C. A .. was held as usual on Tuesday evening. Ray Finch, '03, was the leader. After the devotional exercises a business n1eeting was held at which the report of the nominating co1nmittee was received and accepted and the follo~-ing officers chosen for the next year: President, Fraser Metzger, 1902 ; vice-president, Harry L. Crain, 1902; col-responding secretary, J. H. Cletnents, 1901; recording secretary, W. L. Dickenson, 1903; treasurer, T. DeL. Coffin, 1903. '38.-Grace Episcopal church of Albany held memorial services last Sunday in honor of the memory of the late Rev. Maunsell Van Rens- selaer, '38, founder and first rector of the church. Dr. Walter W. Battershall of St. Peter's Episco- pal church, an honorary graduate of Union, preached the memorial sermon.

TltE CONCORDlENSlS. 11 FOQ NEW FOOTBALL QULES. MIDWINTER MEET. M.an.y Proposed Changes in the Qegula- tions Governing the Sport. Successful Affair Held in the Gym on Friday Evening. A lively discussion is going on between the large universities in regard to several proposed , cba nges in the existing football rules. Coach- ing from the side lines, the relative value of the touchdown and the goal from the field, and the retention or rejection of the twenty yard rule to retai1n possession of the ball are being actively foHght over. Tbe many troubles of the last season resulting from. coach interference appear to have brought abottt a strong sentitnent in favor of relegating evet::.yone except actual players to the ropes. Tl1oe Yale-Princeton game especially etnphasized the :need of such a rule. The disgraceful inci- dent in the Princeton-Colutnbia gatne, when a Princeton tnan on the side-line tripped up a Columbia back, will be ren1embered by every one .. \l\he rules cotnmittee at its coming tneeting will undoubtedly adopt some regulation in regard t<> t:his most important matter. :Princeton is advocating a dhninution in the valuation of the goal from the field. A recent dispatch from New Haven strongly opposes any su-ch change. It is argued that such a method would bring about a decadence in the art of pu11.ting and drop kicking. Yale denies that rttshing ranks above kicking in really scientific fo<>tball and argues that the punter and drop- kicker represent the highest types of the foot- ball player. Great games, she declares, are iBY.ariably fought out inside the twenty-five yard line so that the risk of an attempt at a placed or · dr()p kick frotn the field raises football science to an higher plane. [t will be remembered that an old rule in the code gives an eleven the right to retain posses- sion of the ball when losing twenty yards or tnore on the four downs. It is said some elevens have been taking advantage of this to delay games. ,.I'he rules con1mittee tnay pos- sibly adopt some modification of this regulation. However, there appears to be no urgent neces- sity at present of any such change. The annhal inter-class midwinter meet was held in the college gymnasium Friday evening, March 2. The freshmen particularly showed admirable spil·it in the contest, having the most entrie~ in each event and proving then1selves victors with .52~ points to their credit. The sophomores were their nearest competitors with 3576 points. The preliminaries for the high jumps and the finals in the shot put and high kick were held Friday, Feb. 9th. The results of the meet ·were as :follows : Shot put-Slack, 1901, first, 37 ft. 7 in; R. Donnan, 1903, second; Hoxie, 1903, third ; Oakley, 1902., fourth.

12 THE CONOORDlENS!S. \ANSWER TO PQA YEQ.\ The Qev. Philip H. Cole, '88, the Sunday Afternoon Speaker. The vesper service in chapel last Sunday after .. noon was addressed by the Rev. Philip H. Cole of Syracuse. Mr. Cole was graduated from Union in the class of '88, and was for a time an instructor in the college. He also held a pastor- ate in one of the city churche&. At present he is a trustee of the college and pastor of the First Reformed church of Syracuse. Mr. Cole preached in Dr. Rayn1ond's stead in the First Refonned church of this city on Sunday. At the meeting in chapel Mr. Cole took for his theme, the answer to prayer. He read the passage of scripture in which Christ said that if we abide in Him and His words in us, w hatso- ever we will shall be done unto us. J\tlr. Cole said that if there is no prayer there is no spiritual life. Mr. Moody said of his buildings at North- field, that he pt·ayed up every one of them. We need not say that those structures became material facts as a direct result of Mr. Moody's prayer for each one, but we tnay ask, \Is it likely that those buildings would have arised if Mr. Moody had not been a prayerful man?\ Mr. Moody had his character formed by prayerfulness which gave hin1 a purpose, an energy and a power which he would not otherwise have had. Therefore it would seetn that Mr. Moody's utter- ance is a worthy testirnony of the efficacy of prayer. Mr. Cole said he believes that God directly answers prayer. He believes that we cannot rightly argue against God's free agency. Prayer is a law of the universe. He illustrated with a short parable. An angel comes into a garden where there is a learned and thoughtful scientist. The angel desires explanations of natural phe- nomena. The scientist explains the geological structure of the mountain, he explains celestial n1oven1ents, and the angel is delighted with the depth of the scientist's thought. The scientist goes on to say that there is nothing but force and law. The angel expresses himself as delighted with all he has heard but says that of all the wonderful things the scientist himself is tnost wonderful. The scientist has a person- ality, a conscience and all the attributes which we allot to a hutnan being but yet the scientist gives no explanation of his own personality. What can the explanation be hut God? If God is behind everything he must possess a free per- sonal agency and he must be able to answer prayer by a means that overpowers the laws of his own construction. \Interpret Christ's ahn and whatsoever you ask, following his teach- ings, it shall be done. The man who does not believe in prayer must deny that there is a God or deny his personality, he must deny the divine revelation of the scriptures and Christ.\ CHI PSI ALUMNI BANQUET AT ALBANY The annual banquet of the Chi Psi Alumni Association of Northern and Eastern New York was held last Friday evening at the Hotel Ten Eyck, Albany, and was thoroughly enjoyed by both the alumni and undergraduates present.

The Delta Upsilon alumni of Albany and vicinity will hold a banquet at Hotel TenEyck next Friday evening. A large delegation of the local alumni together with the active chapter expect to attend. At Monday's college meeting, David Mont- gomery Dunning, Jr., 'oz, was elected secretary of the student body. The creation of this office was deetned necessary in order to formally pre- serve the actions of the undergraduates. Instructor Pollard suspended regular fresh- man Physiology recitations Wednesday and Thursday that he migl1t show the \Frosh\ the interior view of a specilnen of the canine species. The \Frosh\ say that as a detnonstrator of anatomy the \Dr.\ is an adept. The freshman class has adopted as the class head gear a black cap with garnet nutnerals. A number of freshmen are now wearing it. In accordance with the college custotn now observed, 1903 restricts wearing of the cap to members of her class teams. This rule has proved a decided incentive toward activity in class atl1letics. The Schenectady Clothing Company, ~THE LEADING-- ONE--PRICE CASH CLOTHIERS, HATTERS, AND GE\NTS' FURNISHERS.

He was n1uch liked by \Massa's Chilun ,\ who all t·egarded \Unc' Dan'el'' as an authority on any subject, and they would consult him in preference to their own father and tnother. And there was surely no one who could produce such nice cookies as \An' 'Riah,\ though every time she gave them one she would assert vehemently, \Now dat's de las' one I gwine gib you all, so you jes' well go 'long 'way.'' And the splendid ginger cakes that she would bake for Unc' Dan'el on Saturday preceding the first Sunday of each month ! They were large, very large,-they seemed almost a yard across to the eyes of the children. Not that they were any better than the ones An' 'Riah cooked and carried in \the house\ for thetn, but because Unc' Dan'el had them, and then they were so much larger too. On these Sabbaths he would rise early, get his old faded umbrella, an old cast-off silk hat, wrap up his cakes in a large bandanna and start for a negro church son1e five n1iles away, ~There there would be ail-day preaching .. There, during the interval between the morning and evening services (there is no afternoon in the South), he would retail his cakes at two or three cents each. At these services he would have the oppor- tunity of seeing many darkies from neighboring plantations, many of them friends and acquaint- ances of his. Whether he ever increased his stock of worldly possessions from the proceeds of his cake business is difficult to say, but he certainly derived some enjoytnent from his monthly pilgrimages. Upon his return he would teU his wife of the different negroes he saw, the many tnessages that Sis' Hannah and Sis' ~Nervy and Sis' Susan Bsont\ her. But to return to that early morning scene in the cabin while the overseer's horn is blowing for the hands to come from their quarters and begin the work of the day. Unc' Dan'el was a firm believer in using the means at hand in case of an emergency, or in any other case, and especially when these means had been used by his forefathers with good results. Hence he believed that there was nothing better for rheumatism than to \nint\ the affected part in the oil or grease obtained by frying a rattle- snake. The day before, one of the hands had come across an unusually fine specimen, in a piece of newlv cleared land about a tnile down the ~ river. They had killed it, and knowing U nc' Dan'el's thorn in the flesh, had brought it home for him. He had carefully prepared it that night to fry the next morning while his break- fast was being cooked. The night before, he and his wife had sat before the fire, with their three children lying in different positions on the floor, while the crackling logs gave everything in the cabin a ruddy glow and cast fantastic shapes of the two on tl1e wall behind them. rrhe father noticed that the children were not moving at·ound as usual, and said to them, \You all a in' got de rheumatiz, is you? Num mine, I gwine nint dern jints uv you alls wid somer my ile, and den you'll skip eround.\ That morning his wife had risen early and prepared his breakfast, and he had fried his

The crisp, brown pieces looked for all the world like strips of bacon, and it is no vv-onder that they looked appetizing to three hungry little negroes. An' 'Riah had the breakfast to cook for ''the house,\ and so hurried off. The only occupants of the cabin were the three children, who were still asleep, and whose little black \nappy\ heads could be seen above the coverlet. About an hour passed, the sun rose, the children stirred, and in a little while six shiny eyes popped wide open. They scrambled out of bed and ran to the fire-place to warm their rusty toes. They soon saw the contents of the pan, and urged on by promptings within, and taking it for their breakfast, began to devour the supposed bacon. It disappeared as if by 1nagic,-Unc' Dan'el's ile and all. They smacked their lips in evident satisfaction, and all unconscious of any harm that tnight come to them, ran out to beO'in the 0 day's play, happy and contented with their existence. The cure n1ust have taken effect quickly, on the wrong persons, or perhaps it was because it was taken internally, but certainly there was no trace of rheutnatistn about the three dusky, nin1ble little figures that scampered up towards \the house.\ Aunt Maria was busy in the kitchen all day, but Uncle Daniel came in at noontime and went to his cabin, thinking to fix up his rheumatic oil. To his astonishment it had disappeared. He went to the door and called loudly for the children. They came and arranged thetnselves in a row before him. He frowned on then1 and then asked, \Wat's you all dun wid yo' daddy's rat'lesnake ile wat he lef in de pan?\ They opened their eyes to huge dimensions and for a moment were speechless.

Tlhe semi-annual meeting of the New York State Intercollegiate Athletic Union was held Saturday afternoon art Bagg's hotel in Utica. Those present were Professor Howard Opdyke, J.D. Edwards, Union; Charles V. R. Johnson, G. A. Teller, I-Iobart; H. D. Spencer, Harnil- ton; Dr. M. S. Read, H. E. Fosdick and W. E. Weed, Colgate. H. S. W eet was present as the representative of Rochester university. W. E. Weed presided. Professor Opdyke read the report of the treasurer, Mr. Franklin of Union, showing receipts and expenditures balanced at $192.73· Sun1s of $56.28 each were paid to Hamilton and Union as profits of the last field day. Mr. 'Veet of Rochester presented the applica- tion of that institution for adtnission to the union. He said notice had been sent to Union ' Colgate and Hobart of the application. The managernent of athletics at Rochester, he said, is now vested in a board of two trustees, three alumni, two membeTs of the faculty and four students. The result has been good. rrhe board adopted a resolution asking for adtnission to the union, and it was presented with expres- sion of assent to all conditions of the union's constitution. To Professor Opdyke's inquiry as to whether Rochester would compete in all three branches of athletics, Mr. Weet said a track team would be at the spring meeting, and there would be a baseball team this year. As regards football, there is great activity, a generous alutnnus having taken special interest and declared the institution should lu.tve a teatn in any event.. As to the scholarship requirement, the Rochester board requires 15 hours, while the union con- stitution requires only I 2.

8 THE OONCORDIENSIS. PEA~Y'S EXPEDITION OF '91. Interesting Lecture by Mr. Gibson, One of the Party. Mr. Langdon Gibson of this city, delivered a lecture in the chapel Friday evening, on his experiences with the Peary Arctic Expedition of 1891. The lecture was illustrated by many fine views reproduced from photographs taken by Mr. Gibson on the trip. The party of eight persons started in June of that yea-r frotn New York City in \ The Kite,\ a vessel especially prepared for the trip, n1anned by an old Newfoundland captain. They stopped at Cape Breton and coaled and thence proceeded on their journey. They soon saw that Arctic phenotnenon, the Aurora Borealis. The Esquimauxs have a superstition that these lights at·e the spirits of their ancestors who are playing when they shoot up towards the zenith. Mr. Gibson gave some interesting accounts of. the early history of Greenl~nd and Iceland, of the early Norse settlers under Eric. Greenland's clilnate has not always been what it is now, for in its strata n1ay be found fossils and forms of ferns and other delicate plants which show that in some past age the climate could not have been so cold as it is now. '' The Kite \ was often surrounded by huge icebergs which at times made it very dangerous for the vesseL Mr. Gibson remetnbered seeing some as large as Manhattan Island and at one time as many as one hundred and forty. The one great advantage of travel on inland ice in preference to the sea ice i~ that the way of return is never cut off. The party spent some time at Godhaven where they were entertained very hospitably at dinner by the mayor of the town and his wife, at their home, the most imposing structure in the town. After finishing the meal the host told them that his wife wished him to say to them that they had eaten everything there was in the house, by which phrase she ment to s:ay that she hoped they had had a sufficiency. The dress of the natives in Greenland is very picturesque indeed. This is particularly true in regard to the women's costume, which. censists of a sort of pantaloon of skin with patcies of seal sewed on here and there, while a. ihlouse and hood of fur co1npletes the costume. During one of the voyages in the soHnd Lieut. Perry had the misfortune to break his ~eg, and was consequently connned to his tent for many weeks. During Lieut. Peary's illness M1·\ G-ibson was placed in command of a boat expedition in search of provisions in tbe way of cluck eggs and also to secure a native family to live near them during their stay in winter qua1'ters .. They succeeded in inducing a man, his wife an.d two small children to come. Mr. Gibson to'ld ofthe stealing of a silver spoon from thetn by the native's wife. Curiously it is not considered wrong among the Esqu,imauxs to steaL The party spent the winter in preparing sledges and skins for the inland journey. The party that went on thi:s journey consisted of four persons. Many times their patience '\Vas tried by the dogs who would frequently get away. At one time the only way that they could cap- ture a dog was by giving him opium in some meat. While under the influence of tb.is they put new harness on hirn. Very often, ilil' order to get away, the dogs would eat up their har- ness. Most of the traveling on this inland trip was done between 6 :p·. M. and 6 A. M. One of the party., a scientist, was lost. He had been out on a tour collecting speci1.nens and wandered away froth Mr. Gibson w bo was his companion. His tracks lem to the eclge of a glacier and it was thought that he had tried to cross the glacier and had fallen into one of the numerous crevasees in the ice.

Mr. Gilbert has just con1pleted a tour of the colleges of England and Scotland. Union is fortunate in securing Mr. Gilbert for an address, which will no doubt be one of the best of the year.

Y ., as second- class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THIS EVENING, at seven o'clock, there will be a meeting in the chapel of those interested in giving- a minstrel show. The call should 1neet with a full response. WE AGAIN remind freshmen competitors for the editorial staff that earnest work is a necessary qualification for their appointment. The large number of men trying this year makes the nature of the appointments uncertain, and warrants a decided activity on the part of every man. The policy of the editors has been stated before; but it may be well again to remind those already on the staff as well as the men trying for positions, that ability and evidence of a desire to work are the two essentials necessary for a student to g-ain and retain a place on the board. Competitors should bear in mind that some contribution, however small is expected: every week. Quantity as well as quality in the work submitted, and pro1nptness ·in the handling of news will be duly considered when the appointments for next year are made. Now THAT the five hundred dollars for the spring base ball team has all been subscribed, the team is able to continue its preliminary traiLing with a strong realization that the college is behind it and is supporting it. The probability that a competent coach will be secured increases its and the students' confidet1ce in a successful season. 'The training rules adopted last fall insure a nine that will fully deserve college support, whether the majority of its ,games are victories or defeats. A word to subscribers ; manifest your college spirit by paying up promptly. Captain Edwards and his men will do the rest. ATTENTION has been called before, in these columns, to the fact that one of the bells on the col- lege buildings bas been silent during the greater part of the year. Like other unused property upon the campus, the bell on North college might be said to be for ornamental purposes, except for the fact that it occupies rather an inconspicuous position. There can be no doubt that if this bell were put into daily use, it would be greatly appreciated by the occupants of North college, both in the dorma- tories and class rooms. And speaking of bells, would it not be a good idea in the way of a memorial if a loud, clear- toned bell were purchased by some class and placed where it could ring out the hours in no uncertain tone? It would cost less than a new Y. M. C. A. building, even less than renovating the dorma- tories, and its voice would be an effective reminder of the generous spirit of its donators. COMMENCEMENT OF THE COLLEGE OF PHARMACY. - The comtnencetnent exercises of the Albany College of Pharmacy were held at Odd Fellows Hall last week Tuesday evening. The Rev. Dr. Lawrence of the State Street Presbyterian Church of Albany addressed the large gradu- ating class. Dr. Raymond, as president of the university, conferred the diplomas and addressed the newly-made pharmacists. ·

'rHE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 WERE DEATH ALL. Were life but an accompaniment unto death's minor song ; Were laud and honor, pon1p and fame, with all their kindrea throng, But incidental harmonies to rnake pain's theme more strong ; Life's fullness death, and naught beyond, the soul forever still ; Then would we pray some Master-player to rest the strings until Death's song would cease, its melodies completed at His will. S. B. H., JR., '03. \ THE TRUE LIFE.\ Address of Rev. G. E. Taln\lage at Vesper Service. At the vesper service in the chapel Snnday, Rev. George E. T'alrnage, pastor of the Second }{efonned church, addressed the students on ''The True Life.\ He said in part: ' 4 lt is not of tetnporal or physical life that I would speak this afternoon, but rather of the spiritual life, which is just as invisible and in- tangible as the physical life. It too may be manifest in many ways, and none of these ways are without advocates who seek to establish that they are respectively the seats of life. 'l'here is the church service and fellowship, and yet, while the church is a help to the spiritual life, while indeed it is the result of that life, and a tneans for manifesting and perpetuating it, yet after all it is not the secret of the life. \ Our service this afternoon is under the aus- pices of tbe Y. M. C. A., and we all value the fellowship and help that is afforded by that excellent institution, but we do not find in it the life. It is called into being by the life, but it does not produce life. I tnight, in turn, take up each one of the tneans of grace, and of the institutions for the conserving of religious life, and in turn each would have to be rejected as to being the seat of life. Each has its value without a question, but if we would find the life, we tnust look elsewhere. It is of the life that I vvould speal{, and I speak here where it is more likely to be manifest in a different way from other circles. I am not so far away from col- lege n1yself as to forget the college life, and I recall that we were in a class by ourselves. · The first tendency of the change from hotne is to throw away the restraints of form.er Hfe. The next step is to throw away the traditional beliefs, Happy is the man, who leaves this training with convictions, and with character. There are two kinds of character, but I tnerely call that charac- ter which is positive. I think that it is Drum- tnond who says that a tnan in college passes through three stages, the first of belief, the second of doubt, and the third of conviction. It is of the last that I would speak this afternoon. \ That life may be tnanifest in the world, it may aflect other lives, but it exists between you and your J\laker, and nothing should be allowed to intrude into it, lest it die. The soul is abso- lutely independeBt. Each tnan stands or falls by hin1selL So far as we ourselves are con- cerned, we are are to n1aintain our integrity and individuality., and to pern1it only such con vic- , tions to take possession of us, as satisfy our own . consciences. '' 'But thou when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret.' I believe that these words tnay be interpreted as defining that which in the last analysis we call 'life.' When the soul shuts out the world, and comes into touch with God, then we have life. 4 And the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Hitn, and He will show them His covenant.' Christ came to a lost world tnerely to make this possible, to restore the privilege and the habit of the soul's cotn111union with God, which had been lost through sin. 'For with thee is the fountain of life : in thy light shall we see light.' The tnan who passes out of the college life without thjs secret of life, may comtnand his fellow men, he may rise to positions of the highest responsibility and glory, but he has lost the power that will tnake his life tell, for time and eternity. \And speaking again from observation, I say that there jg a danger of the college life crowding . out the true life. And therefore I am going to

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ask you to preserve that life fron1 constriction and from ridicule. In the matter of constriction, there is a danger of its being crowded out, by having so much else to do and think about. You have rushing in upon you a multiplicity of social duties which belong to the college life, so that the regularity of hours is hard to maintain. And place ! for here is a greater danger than lack of time. They say that fatniliarity breeds contempt, of that I cannot say, but certainly familiarity robs us of all privacy. Respect that tnnn \\rho does not make all his thoughts and feelings comtnon property, and who holds some of his thoughts and life in reserve. \ Ridicule is also dangerous, and I fear, too con1tnon. The freshman son1etirnes leaves behind his religion, or hides it when he cotnes, for fear of ridicule. In the preservation of the life, respect your training, and the traditions of your childhood. Respect your itnpressions, respect your conclusions, for they are your own, and by them you will stand or fall. Cultivate the private comtnunion with the Father of Spirits, and find therein the spiritual and moral power that will sustain you and those depen- dent upon you throughout life, and that will project them into eternity.\ DEATH OF MQS. JOHN K. PO~TEQ. Harriet Cramer Porter, of Waterford, widow of the late Judge John K. Porter, '37, died at the Murray Hill hotel in New York, where she had been passing the winter. The deceased was a woman of sterling character, alway en- gage<l in good work, and founded several benevolent institutions. She established the John K. Porter Memorial Scholarships in memory of her husband, to assist students to pursue the study of law after graduating from Union. She was a daughter of the late John Cramer, 18o 1, and is survived by two brothers, George H., and William E. Cramer, '38, owner of \ The Wisconsin,\ one of the leading news papers of Milwaukee. It is proposed to send an All- Western track team to the Paris games. DELTA U QEUNION AND BANQUET.

'' I .. , ·1 !. THE ~NG~RDIENSIS. VoL. XXIII .. UNION COLLEGE, MARCH 21, 1900. No. 21. THE EXCHANGE.* In every phase of journalistic wo1·k, from the country weekly neVt 7 spaper to the metropolitan daily, and frotn the high school publication to the standard weekly and monthly n1agazines--- in all forms is the exchange an itn portant factor. Eut while an ever present eletnent, the parts played by it in the different branches of literary work are ahnost as varied as the forms from which the reading public of today gathers its information. To illustrate : The country editor~manager­ reporter-proof reader picks up the exchange with a purpose very different from the man on the New YG>rk daily whose sole duty lies in the perusal of exchanges. Nor, again, is there a great deal of sin1ilarity in the motives of the high school editor and the tnagazine reviewer. To be sure, space figures prominently in both cases. But in the one case it is a question of how the material for the exchange column tnay be \padded\ to fill the required space, while in the other the reviewer worries as to how to crowd into the limited space at his disposal fairminded estitnates of the tnagazines of the month. It can readily be seen what a wide field of investigation is opened to one who wishes to enter into a thorough exposition of the exchange in its broadest sense. But in the present instance the purpose of the Intercollegiate Press Asso- ciation is an article upon the exchange from the point of view of the college editor. In the first place, then, what is the aim of the exchange? An exchange of college papers has a three- fold object: first, the itnmediate benefit to the paper in the form of actual news or literary pro- ductions which may be reprinted; second, the benefit derived by the editors; and third, that *Written at the request of the New York State Intercollegi- ate Press Association. felt by the students as a whole outside of the editorial boards$ The first .of these objects is self evident. One may almost say that it is the foremost obj:ect, but this proposition is open to debate. Among newspapers, however, it is certainly the prin1ary aitn. But in the college publica- tion the three aims are so closely related, that their relative merits can hardly he weighed with fairness. In e\Tery college paper there is bound to be matter in a larger or smaller quantity which is of sufficient interest to warrant its pub- lication in full, or at least in a condensed fonn, in other college papers. Intercollegiate news leads this class. In the college literary 1112gazine this is not always found to be the case. Prose compositions, unless of special interest, rarely are reprinted. 1'he greatest objection is, of course, found in the space occupied. Verse may be, and is to a great extent, copied. If not carried to excess, and if due credit is given, there can be no objection to the use of this tnethod in the selection of material for the magazine. But it is not merely a negative good, and the same is true with reference to the college paper. The college publication that confines its field to the four walls of the institu- tion it represents will find its sphere of influence bounded by the same narrow litnits ; and, a greater evil,-it will foster a spirit of exclusive- ness among its student readers. The publica- tion that adopts such a policy is not up to the standard of the day. And in that case it fails as a true representative of the institution. The ideal student publication should aim to have a depart- ment of intercollegiate news or, in the case of a literary magazine, a department under which would appear the best things from the colutnns of other college magazines. Here enters the function of the exchange. This, then, is the first advantage of an exchange-the benefit felt by the paper itself.

' i 6 THE OONCORDIENSIS. This brings us to the second point, namely : the benefit derived by the editors. This benefit is so closely interwoven with and dependent upon the first, that a sharp discrimination is wen night impossible. T~ke for instance the matter of self-centred conservatism above referred to. Grant that the editors l1ave no de&ire whatever to Jimit the field of their paper, but for some reason no tnaterial that is not connected with the institution is published, and no other college magazines are invited to exchange. Does it not follow that the editors will be the losers in senti- ment to the extent that the paper is in actuality? The editors will soon tend to becotne narrow- minded, and then again, there will be the reaction on the paper. The editor who is so fortunate as to have at his disposal a score or more of publications fron1 other colleges, is not only kept in touch with the college world, but gains frotn a perusal of his exchanges imtneasur- able assistance in the conduct of a college paper. He profits by the lessons of his brother editor, and is able to improve constantly the paper under his direction. We come now to the third point, the benefits derived frotn the exchange by the students. These benefits are realized in two ways, indi- rectly and directly. The indirect advantages are those which come in the shape of the inter- collegiate news a student reads in his own col- lege paper. But there is a more direct advan- tage. In every college there should be an edi- torial room where files of the exchanges may be seen. Every student is thus enabled to have access to papers and tnagazines from the othetA colleges and thus to keep in touch with the college world. One of the best vvays in which to becotne acquainted with an institution is to peruse its publications. The college paper stands for something more than the mere print- ing of news items. As a true exponent of student life it should mould the undergraduate sentin1ent. It should, in short, be to the students, what the ideal newspaper is in relation to the public. A few words now as to the limits of the exchange. Carried to too great an extent, it b~comes impracticable. Besides, business man- agers usually run their papers on an economical basis, and receipts and expenses are, as a rule, planned to come out nearly equal. So an exceedingly large exchange list is not always possible, and if so, perhaps not practicable. There is, then, .a limit, within the bounds of which it is advisable to retnain. Disregarding the comic and illustrated college papers which are few in number, we tnay divide college pub- lications into three classes: the newspaper, • daily, semi-weekly and weekly; the literary tnagazine, bi-weekly and n1onthly ; and lastly the type devoted in part to news, and in part to the literary side, and issued as a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. For the purpose in view, let the field of college journalism in this country be divided into four parts, the first to contain the Ne\tY England and Middle Atlantic states, the second the Southern, the third the Middle West, and the fourth the far West. An ideal exchange list would have on it every col- lege publication of that class issued within its territorial division, together with at least two typical publications of the class frotn each of the other divisions. Then too, an exchange with a few foreign publications is an advantage. In the case of the publication partly news and partly literary, an exchange is desirable with all three classes as set do~rn above. No lines should be drawn between the college and the university in the exchange of paper&. The system is of benefit to both. The question of the high-school exchange is an independent one. So far as the editors are mutually benafitted, the advantages are almost wholly one-sided. But the presence in the high- school reading room of college papers reacts in favor of the institutions represented. This is the sole benefit of such an exchange, and this benefit may be obtained in other ways. One of these is the system wherein the students in a college have their papers :fi)rwarded to the prepa- ratory school from which they have graduated. This plan is being pursued with success at Union, and has been found to be an acceptable substitute for the high-school exchange. In conclusion, then, a brief sumtnary. The exchange of college publications if kept within ·~ • {i '· ! ' ~~ ,, -.: \j .. c'.j

.. i '\' ' -/ THE CONCrOJtDlENSIS. 7 the prescribed limits is a great advantage alike to the editors, and students in general ; and the material benefit felt by the exchanging papers is best evidenced in their own columns. Through its ,effect upon paper, editors, and students, the exchange has come to benefit the institution itself, and if given its proper place in the system of things it cannot fail to continue to be a recog- nized good. \ PHILIP LIVINGSTON THOMSON.

Even before the days of Seward, Union men were taking front rank among the national law :makers. Union's sons have always been prom- inent in the affairs of the nation as we11 as in s,tate poHtics. This is as true today as ever. Among the Union Alumni who are enrolled as J.Iletnbers of the fifty-sixth congress are : Repre- sentatives Charles E. Pearce, '63, of Missouri ; Charles W. Gillet, '6r, of New York ; Henry Richard Gibson, Law '65, of Tennessee; Wash- ington Gardner, Law '76, of Michigan; Joshua S. Salmon, Law '73, of New .T ersey ; Joseph E.

The Albany concert of the 1nusical clubs next Saturday night should bring out a large audience ()f 1·epresentative Albany people. The Albany concert has come to be an annual feature in the l'ife of the 111 us~ cal part of the college, and the clubs are always well received. Atnong the ptorninent men of Albany, Union's alutnni are c<>nspicuous both as regards their number and their individual itnportance. At the present titne the percentage of students, living in Albany· is greater than that of any other city. AthletL c<>ntests are often held and well supported in Albany. Thus it is that Union has always been on terms of intimacy with Albany, and looks to Albany as a close friend and loyal supporter. On their part the clubs have been appl_ving tben1selves closely to work this year, so that they have become exceedingly proficient. At the recent meeting of the Board of Stewards of the Intercollegiate Rowing Asso- ciation, held at Philadelphia, the application of Syracuse for admittance to metnbership was favorably acted upon, and as a result it is prob- aiJie that Syracuse will row at Poughkeepsie nteKt June.

8 THE OONCORDIENSIS. THE s.PANISH-AME~ICAN WA~. Some Phases of the Campaign as seen by a Staff Officer. General J. W. ,Clous, the cotnmander at Governor's Islalild, and who was present in Cuba during the Spanish war as a m'etnber of Gen. Miles' stafl., lectured in the chapel Friday afternoon. General Clous was formerly pro- fessor of International Law at West Point, and at the close of the late war was secretary of the Cuban evacuation comn1ission. He took for his subject, \Glimpses of the Cuban and Porto Rican catnp2igns ~nd the Evacuation of Cuba by the Spanish Army.\ General Clous spoke first of the need of ~Teater preparation in tim~e of peace, drawing a com- parison between the ways and means employed by European powers to maintain an army dur- ing peace and the unsatisfactory method by which our standing army is maintained. He said, \The preparation for war in this country is vastly different from that in other countries. Year after year, we have been going on, not as George Washington said, 'In· time of 'peace prepare for wat· ,' but in time of peace prepar- ing for more peace. 'rhe outcome of the Spanish-American war was not due to careful preparation, but to the ready way in which An1erican pluck, energy, and ingenuity went to work to raise the number of soldiers, when the crisis really came. On April 24, we sho\\red to the world that we \rvere preparing war on paper. In less than three months we had nearly 345 ,ooo men. \l . d was ass1gne to the staff of Gen. Miles at a:n early date. We went post-haste on the American steamship Yale to Santiago, arriving six days later, just in titne to see the New York bombarding Santiago.\ Gen. Clous, after giving a vivid description of the siege, then quoted the words of Gen. Miles to the Spanish general at the time of the surrender: \General you have rnade a gallent defense, but it is use- less to prolong the struggle, for we have rein- forcements close at hand. ''The carnpa ign in Cuba ended, preparations w·ere tnade f&r transportation to Porto Rico. ' Gen. Miles telegraphed to Washington that he was about to ~tart for Porto Rico. But instead .of sailing for the· north-eastern part of the island .he ~aHed to tl1e south-west. Consequently the Un1ted States thought for a tirn,e the expedition lost, receiving no news of it through the news- papel~s. ·''The campaign in Porto Rico was an easy problem. AJl the roads run north and south. One column vent up on the ,extreme western .side of the island, two columns marched up through the cea:tral part of the island and three up the eastern side. Then came the cessation of hostilities at Havana.\ Gen. Clous is not a :lover of Havana. The odors of Havana harbor he described as \'terrific.\ General Clous said that during his stay in Havana, he never received the slightest dis- courtesy frotn the Spanish .officers or soldiers.

. ·' ''i \ THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 STUDENT VOLUNTSE~S. lftr. Gilbert's Strong Appeal for Mission- ary Workers. .A!t the vesper service Sunday afternoon Mr. :F::red. M. Gilbert, secretary of the Student Volunteer Movetnent, addressed the students. :Hr. Gilbert is a graduate of Yale, and has -recently returned from a tour through the .cotleges of England and Scotland. The speaker ~n1phasized the responsibilty which rests on ewety student in the choice of his life V\rork. ''' '['h. ere is but one life work,\ he said, \ and it i:s aJl important how we shall use it. The man who decides early in life what he shall do, is li~ble to have greater influence with his fellow me11 than he who is undecided. Whoever faces tbe question of choosing a life work needs some great controlling purpose. The motive of the Saviour was to do the will of his Father who sent b:ittl. We can have no bettet· purpose than to d<> the will of God. Hindrances may arise, such as selfish ambition, flattery of relatives and ft-iends, indifference, ignorance, or disobedience, b-ut there is no real reason why we should not ask ·God what He will have us to do, and do it. ·\The call of the present day is largely to the tnission field. Physicians and teachers are needed as well as clergymen. An appeal is tnade by the Student Volunteer Movement, and a stronger appeal is heard from th.e distant lands from those who have already consecrated their 1L ves to God and now look back with longing eyes to see if other men from their colleges are . 11.ot going to follow. Stronger still is the appeal from the men and women in India, China and elsewhere who have come into Christianity. Even stronger is the appeal from the eight lundred tnillion who have never heard of Christ. B:t:tt the greatest invitation comes from the Master who stands waiting. 'Go ye into all tl1e world,' this was His last appeal. He is our Ex:arnple, our Saviour, our King. Why not ()bey Hi~ last cotnmandment? ''A young man who was about to give his life to the tnission work said in answer to the <JUestion, why he went, that Christ had done so much for him that l1e :Celt it his duty to go. In short, he said he went because he had no reason to stay and every reason to go. And is it not so with t.nany of us if we would but ask our- selves honestly, 'What will God have me to do?' ShaH we not feel him calling us to some field of which we little thoug:bt ? \ SCHEDULE OF EXAMINATIONS MARCH 26-30, 1900 . SENIORS. 9A.M. { Ethics, Monday A. merican History, '·\ • Design, (L.) N.Y.

CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, TERMS: $2.00 per Year, in Ad vance 10 Cents Address all conununications to THE CONCORDI- ENSIS, Box 213, Schenectady, N. Y. Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414: State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. NEXT WEEK being exatnination. week, according to custom there will be no issue of The Concord- iensis. THE UNDERGRADUATE COUNCIL recently estab- lished by an act of the student body, certainly marks an advance in the administration of local collegiate affairs. Heretofore, there has been a too evident lack of controlling influence over many matters of common interest. Neglect of duty has sometimes gone unpunished, and certain turbulent and heedless actions of little benefit to anyone have occurred at times when an influential body could have prevented them. The council as organ- ized is composed of a representative company of college men, who through their position in student affairs, have shown themselves worthy of the con- fidence given them. They are a body of men who the council may possibly assume too many pre,_ rogatives. If it is remetnbered that the student body, as the creative power, is the higher authority, any doubts on this question will speedily disap- pear. The council is, in reality, merely a E!trong student executive committee. The council appre- ciates its responsibility, and has set about its work in a business-like manner. Good results have already been the outcome of its actions. The wisdom of its establishtnent cannot for a moment be doubted, and a successful future is au assured fact. IN LINE WITH the many reforms which are being acc01nplished, The Concordiensis wishes to call attention to a matter which should have been reme- died long ago, and which now has reached propor- tions that are disgraceful. We refer to the attend- ance-or rather, non-attendance-of the students at lectures. From time to time the college authori- ties offer the students an opportunity to listen to some prominent man on a topic of timely import- ance or one of general interest, and as a rule, the hour set for the lecture finds the chapel only partially filled by an audience made up of towns- people, faculty, and a small proportion of students. Now this is a state of affairs that ought not to exist. We are here for an education, and the chapel lectures are as much a part of our develop- ment as any course of studies in the class room. No one can afford to miss these opportunities. At the lecture last week a large proportion of the audience were women, and there were actually less than fifty students in attendance. There is anoth~r point of view from which to face .· the question. Much has been said and written this year anent college spirit, and in many ways an admirable degree of this quality has been shown. But in this one particular it is being sadly neglected. It should not be necessary to threaten college men ·with being tnarked in chapel, to induce them to come ·out to lectures provided for them, and only incidentally,, for the faculty atid friends of the college. One of the very best ways can safely be and moment. entrusted with matters of delicacy of showing a proper college spirit is attend~ce The suggestion has been made that - upon the lectures. Let us hope for an improvement.
