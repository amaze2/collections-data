UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 3, 1904. No. 15. . ~t)TGE.RS~UNION DEBATE. if she is to co1npete with other nations she must give up free trade. The arinual debating contest between Rut- gers and Union was held at New Brunswick, Friday, January 29. The New Jersey College obtained the decision over Union, after a , spirited contest. An account o·f the debate, taken in part,. fro1n a New Brunswick paper J. H. Brinkerhoff, taking up the argutnen.t for the negative, claimed that England wa:s never greater in her prosperity than she is now, and has increased 12 s,ooo in foreign trade alone. T'he British empire, said the speaker, is. not a pack of cards which will fall if not propped up by protection. Und.er a preferential tariff, the home food supply would be cut off and thousands of people in London would starve if the price of bread were raised a penny a loaf, while in case of \var the food su.pply would be cut off altogether. It has bee11 well said, Mr. Brinkerhoff remarked, that free trade has done more to maintain the peace of the world than all the di plon1acy of f.ollOW'S-. 1,·qe contest took place Chapel, beginning at 8. r 5· large audience present. in !{irk patrick There was a The subject of the debate ·was) \Res.ol ved, . Tb.at· EngJanq should abandon her free trade policy.\ r.rhe· following- speak~rs for union supported the affirmative: Morris T. Ray- mond, 190 5; Tho1nas M. Holmes, 1905; El~ -~bert V. I.Vfullenaux, 19::4; alternate, Elbert 1\. .Rulison, Jr., I 904. On the negative side the following spoke for Rutgers: J. Howard Br-inkerhoff, 1905; Charles Wagner, 19··o4; ·Martin L. Schenck. 1904; alternate, \V. W. B··ender, I 90 5· Morris 'T. Ray1no.nd led off for the afilrn~a­ tive. He said that in I842, when ~ngland . abandoned the protective syste1n, she practi- cally n1onopolized the world's cotnmerce and as free trade is the weapon of the strongest, had no one to compete with as a man uf actur- ing nation. But in the sixty years since then, said the speaker, England has lost ground, and by taking up the systen1 England discard- ed, Russia, Gern1any and the United States have built their manufactures up until they have rivaled England. At the present time . El).gland's in1ports exceed her exports by nine hundred n1illions. At one ti1ne England own- ed ev.ery kind of continental security, now ~he dr.aw:s her capital fron1 other countries. E\n.gl'and is undoubtedly growing poorer, ~nd ministers put together. Thon1as M. I-iolmes, of Union, took up the practical side of the case, showing how in fifty years England's colonies have grown commercially independent, yet give England a preference of f rotn 2 5 to 33 per cent. Still the United States supplies England with 66 per cent of the wheat used in. the mother ·country . Charles \Vagner, for the negative, thought that England's lack of raw tnaterials for her manufactures forcecl her to cling to free trade. Free raw materials, were absolutely essential to :Eng1a.nd's continuance as the greatest n1anufa.ctudng nation in the vvorld. Elbert V. ~1ulleueaux, of Union, held that a. one-sided trade system \vas not business-like, and th.at a withdrawal of England's preferen- tial tariff would mean that she would have to cotnpete with her colonies on the same basis as other countries. He declared that England could not maintain even second place in the inclustrial struggle without protection.

THE~ ·aoNO:ORDlENSIS. Martin L. Schenck, of Rutgers concluded the presentation of arguments by ·alleging that Joseph Chan1berlain had advocated pro- tection for political reasons. 'The change of ;: tariff system, he contended, would raise the price of food stuffs an·d ~inflict great injury up· on the poor people. He pointed out the :: danger of ta.mpering with trade conditions and j held that England's present system should not be exchanged unless for one manifestly very i' tn:uch better. 'The speakers during this part of the debate vere limited to ten minutes. Then they were allowed five minutes in rebuttal, which was very interesting and amusing. Dr. Scott presided at the debate and in- troduced the speakers. After the last had spoken in rebl:lttal the result was submitted to the judges, who were Edward Day, of Newark ; Arthur C. Howland, Ph. D., of Columbia University; Edgar 0. Lovett, Ph. D.; of Princeton University. The judges r~:Jtired and w bile they were taiking over their decision the students present entertained the audience with college songs. When the judges returned Mr. Day an- nounced that they had decided in favor of Rutgers. The local students loudly cheered this decision and there was an interchange of cheering by the rival colleges, for one another. NATIONAL ORATORICAL CON- TEST. Winner of Contest at the World's Fair Ne·xt Fall to be Champion College Orator of the United States. ·c~_llege ~t~dents all over the country are be- coming interested in a proposed oratorical con- tes't which is to determine, at the \Vorld's Fair ne'xt . autumn, the cham pion college orator· of the· United States. Students of the Missouri State University, at Columbia, Mo., are per- fetting a plan proposed 'by a student in the Kansas University for the creation of an inter- state oratorical league comprising, evrery state' university in the Union. . The plan, as unfolded ·thus far, Js to enlist· the interest of oratorical talent in each' state university; organizing a· local oratorica] asso .. fi ciation in each; to divide the country into sev• eral sections, each comprising half a dozen or more states; and to hold the final contest in a hall on the World's Fair grounds. Each institution will hold a local contest, several of its leading orators participating,. . The student who wins at his horr1e college will represent his state in the section of several states to which he belongs. 1~he tnan winning at this contest will be sent to the World's Fair to represent his section. One tnan thus may represent the New England states, another man the Middle Alantic coast states, another man the states of the Middle West, and so on. At the final contest these half dozen or more young n1en willtneet upon a rostrum inside the exposition and engage in a contest of oratory such as the world never has known. The ex- position con1pany will grant the use of one of the splendid assembly halls for the contest. The judges will be selected from amongst the most distinguished and representative men in America. J udgtnen t will be rendered as to thought, composition and delivery, a separate set of judges being arranged for each of the three points of competition. The plan calls for the sending of copies of each oration to the judges pn thought and con1position some time prior to the date of the contest, so that the em~ inent authorities may read the productions carefully and mark them according to estimate of merit. The judges as to delivery will be present at the con test and will retire imme- diately after the close of the concluding ora- tion and render their decisions. A general average will then be struck between the ,mark- ings of the three se.ts of judges, and. ~h.e man receiving the highest marking will be adj.ud~ed ;. winner. ~ , . l' !·' ·.1 l I

'· ' ~ , . l' !·' ·.1 l I GLOBE HOTEL, ALBANY.-Adv. That this young man will become in a large sense a national hero is not to be doubted. An the world loves a lover-· and an orator. The man who can sway an audience by the eloquence of his lips is ever a hero. 'fhe abil· ity '' the applause of listening senates to conl- mand\ is admired and honored in all nations. Therefore it is to be expected that the young college student who shall win this national contest in oratory under such auspices, prac- tically with the whole world as his audience, will become a prophet with his own country; and there are just now scattered throughout the United States, in two score of state univer- sities, a large number of talented young men who are ambitious to engage in the contest.- Ro bert us Love, St. Louis, Mo. PRESIDENT NOTT'S DISCIPLINE. P£eaident Charles F. Th\ing of ~~ 8rtlot\les- tern t'~rsity, in a chapter on \The Gov- ern.ment of Students,\ in his book entitled '~College administration,\ says : d The gov- ernment of the students in American colleges has undergone a revolution in the last half century.\ The causes of these changes is manifest. The cause most evident 9 although not the most fundarnental, is the change in the methods of the college officers in treating the students. These changes in tnethod are best set forth in the address which President N ott of Union college made on the occasion of the celebration of the semi-centennial of his be- con1ing President. These changes are also illustrated in his ovvn career as an executive in Union college. In the first years of this cen- tury in the government of Union College, the :Faculty ·met as a court, summoned offenders, ex:amined witnesses, and passed judg1nents ~ith all the formality of a civil tribunal. Such a method President Nott felt was wrong in .principle and uri wise in tnethed. Once one of the professors came to an issue with one of the students on so simple a question as the THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 right of the student to illu·minate his room on a special occasion. The student ~;vould not accede to the wish of the professor:~ and he was accordingly expelled. The father of the boy appealed to the Board of Trustees to set aside the sentence, and after a discussion of half a year, with many accompanying disturb- ances, the student was returned to his place in college. It wa~ at this ti:me President Nott determined that such methods shot.tld cease. He decide~ to adjust the government of the college to the age, temperament, and con- ditions of the students. Whenever any stu- dent was found offending in condttct or de- linquint in his studies, he was treated as a child would be treated by his father in similar conditions. I-Iis most · intimate companions were urged to take an interest in his welfare; if he were a member of a society, that society was asked to bring all its influence to bear upon hin1. Moral and religious interests, sense of honor, ·were the n1otives and condi- tions that were used to aid students to be gentlemen. It is probable that President N ott has had a larger and more renowned success in managing students for the larger part of his career than any other college Presi- dent has ever had. But the conditions that he found valuable throughout his conspicuous and prolonged career represent tbe method that is now prevailing among American col- leges.\ LA DERNIERE CLASSE. Dr. Cavour, Professor of Philosuphy, arose from his chair to deliver his lecture. The pro- fessor was an atheist, and held his position as head of the philosophical department of the great university only on the condition that he should never endeavor to force his ()Onvictions upon his class. His lectures were nasterpieces of logic and eloquence, but they }{new not the word God. Eiis god was Reason. He had a ~wondetfql person.~lity. His broad shoulders

'On the day in question his eyes seem,ed brighter than usual, so1netimes like the glitter of bronze, and again like the glow of dark red wine; and as their glance swept over the classroom they seemed to charge the very atmosphere with a strange magnetic force. Every whisper was hushed, and the only sound which broke upon the tense silence was the full-throated song of a robin, and a gentle rustle of the new leav!es just outside the window, for it was spring. Then in clear cut, carefully worded senten- ces he began his lecture. As he passed from point to point in his argument his voice rose in its fervor of eloquence, and as his utterance grew rnore impassioned his brow seemed to darken and his eyes to g1 int with a strange brilliancy. \Vhat was the conclusion of the argument which he was putting forth his n1ightiest effort to prove ? The pencils had craved to 1nove over the note books. All sat gazing with mingled awe and fear at the speak- er. At last the purpose of the argument was grasped by the students. They waited in si- lence for the conclusion which they kne·w must be drawn from his line of argument. There· was something threatening! almost defiant in his attitude as he approached the conclusion. \ Let the fools gape and stare if they will, and let them wear out their eyes hunting for their God. They must have a name, so they call him God. It is sweet to them so let them grope on in their blindness. But must we, blind as bats and worms, grovel with them ?\ A cold glitter shone in the speaker's eyes as he cast forth his arm in a gesture of supreme contempt. '' God ? fools! there is no God! Let them search sea aud earth, and gaze at the planets with dull and vacant stare and weav~ strange webs from their flimsy imaginations. What do ~hey find? Nothing.. Why! There. is nq God. Reason, and Reason alone is-Reason, and Reason-Reason and. \ Why did he hesitate? Had he lost the thread of his argument ? A change ca.m.e rap- idly over him. He no longer stood erect, but stooped over his desk as if bent '\vith age. . ' Then gradually he settlt:d back into the chair behind him. 1'he light which had so lately gleamed in his eyes flickered a momont and went out. His features which had drawn into an expression of contempt relaxed, and became as expressionless as those of a child. He turned slowly in his chair and fixed his dull gaze upon a bird which was tugging at a bit of cord on the window sill. His lips moved .as if he would speak, but no sound . came at first. At last he muttered a few words in a complain- ing voice: \Why will that bird insist on tugging at string? Drive it away! What does it want of the string anyway ? That is a simple question, Dr. Cavo~r, yet you cannot answer it ? With the exception of two students the class passed silently from the room and out across the campus to the president's office. It was only a few days later when the chapel bell began to toll disn1ally, yet not for tn<?rning prayers-Dr. Cavour was dead. L. S., '04. UNION'S FINANCIA~ CON·DITlON.

In the statement of Liabili- .. ties, of the Carnegie gift of $4o,ooo, there re- · mains $22,461.83. There is also an unexpend- ed balance of $1,532.68 from subscriptions for the Electrical Engineering Dept. In this same statement, it is learned that the Armstrong En- dowment Fund amounts to $59,968.86. F. W. Adams offered the opening prayer after which Pres. Raymond introduced the Rev. E. E. Johnston, Pastor of the First Re- formed Church ,of Albany, who delivered a ser,mon on ''The Perfect Man ;'' the text be- ing taken from th.e Book of Ephesians, 4th chapter and 13:tl.ir verse. Dr. Johnston gave a very interesting and impressive address, ex- horting men to become as near like Christ as possible, who v.ra:s taken as the . on 1y example Aside from the Carnegie Gift, ther,e hav·e been d~onations atnounting to ·$s, 78o .oo. Of these, J .. H. Starin gave $r, 100; Dr. A. V. V. Rayn1ond, $716.66; Dr. Geo. Alexander, $6oo; Ron. N. V. Franchot, Vv. B. Rankin, S. B. Brownell, Hon. D. S. Lamont, D. W. Vander- veer, $'5oo each. The receipts from the stu- dents amon11ted to $15,965.59 The entire Budget Appropriation for the Coltege·amounted to $46,540.05. The gener- al College Expenses amounted to $46, 278.4o, thus tea ving -an unexpended balance of $2 61.6 5. There are many interesting facts to be noted in the report. In the college year 1902-03, the Money Scholarships for students amounted to $z, 216.66. The Board however appropriat- ed only $2, ooo for these scholarships. Pres. Raym~nd, it seems, came to the rescue and contributed the necessary $216.66. In the san1.e year, 1902-03, the tuitions rebated to stu- derits amounted to $6,5 ro. At the close of the report, a small but expressive table shows the sums received from the students during the last three years. In I 901, $3,988. so was received from them; in I 902, $6,442.94; in 1903, $rs,g65.59, four times as tnuch as two years-before in 1901. D·AY OF PRAYER. • ~ c~ 0 ~-· of a perfeet ,man.

When the tender tide was full and flush With the line of shells by the rollers' rush, The tremulous voice still called to me, From the cavernous caves of the sobbing sea, Ou the heart of the homing wind it came Setting my faithless soul. aglow When I heard. that voice of the Long, Long Ago, \ Oh come to thy lonely Linulo, Come, come to the loving heart you know, Haste,'haste to thy sorrmying Linulo.\ ' s. c.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XX\TII. UNION C-OLLEGE,, FEBRUARY 10, 1904. No.1.6. EXCAVATI'Or.JS.' The inter~est attaching to the excavation of ancient sites. in Italy and Greece is chiefly of an historical nature. 'Old reHcs in brick, stone and n'larble are of little value, except vvhen they throw 1 ight on the custon1s, re- ligion, character, art and relative in1 portance o.f the earlier nations of the earth. rrhe great- er the influence once exerted upon the rest of mankind by any ;one portion of the human race, at any given epoch of time, tbe greater also is the vah1e to students of etl1nology and history of the relics in1m,ediately connected with that particular civilization. :E-Ience the interest a~sociated with all that is left, w heth- er in the fonn .. of written docu1nents, or of , architectural or art fragn1ents, of ancient Greece aqd Rome. The tern1 archaeology is usually restricted to the study of ancient remains in stone, n1arble, clay, etc, In order to get at these ~·etnains for purpos- es of investigation it has been necessary to use tbe pick-axe and the spade, t 11at is, it has been necessary to dig into the ground and re-· move the earth which has accumulated through the centuries and hidden frotn view Ltrge por- tions of ancient cities, ten1ples ancl d\Yellings_, which for one rec~son or another bad fallen in- to disuse. 'l'hc ancients, especially the Ro- mans, had a \Yay of allo\ving a b·ui lding to tumble into ruins, and ~f n1aking the ruined portion of it a foundation for a ne\v structure. Thus the old building rernai ned in sight, in a 1nore or less dilapidated condition, but con.- c·ealed from. view by the superstructure of more recent date. Rains, floods, earthquake and alluvial deposits were also factors potential in the creatio11 of hidden cities. We are \\on t to speak of the results of ex-- cavation as '' finds,\ but the word is inade- quate to say the least ; for it is not a few vas· es merely, or gold ornaments,. or a brorrze or n1arble statue here and there, that is the ob· ject of search, but buildings of con'siderabie extent and in great number, such as are now conspicuous in the excavated Forum Roman· urn, and at ancient Corinth, Delphi, Olym~pia, Epidaurus and i\thens,-shattered and pros- trated it is true, yet exhibiting enough of the-mselves to render restoration hopeful :· Excavation in Greece is in son1e respects all easier 1natter than in Italy. This for two reasons. First, the Greek governme'nt has always thrown open, as it were, the whole country to the spade of the foreigneJ;. No restrictions by government have been placed in the vvay of the Gern1an, the Fre1:chman, the Englishman or the American, whose curiosity has led him to seek permission to dig into Greek soil. In the second p-lace, what I have referred to as the accun1ulatioBs of centuries, has been operative in slig~ter measure where abandoned Greek sites are con· cerned, than where sin1ilar places have been lost to view in more thickly populated Italy. In the latter country the jealousy of the Vati- can and of the I tal ian governrn ent has proved, at ti1nes, an almost insuperable impediment to investigations of this uature, while the cort· tinuous life in one and the sam,e spot or area __,an activity unbroken, so to speak, for up- wards of three thousand years-has been the cause of a n1ore complete obscuration of the ancient 111onuments. But the difficulties connected with govern,· ment jealousy in Italy are slo·w·Iy passing away -chiefly because the Italians themselves have been induced by German and ·American aT•

6 THE CONCORDIEN:SIS. chaeologists to lend a hand in the matter. ~ evertheless the Italian governn1ent today is unwilling that:anything should be done except at its own initiative, and all excavations in the city of Ron1e are carried forward under the superintendence of the minister of public instruction. These excavations have been progressing rapidly of late years, with the _result that the whole (or nearly so) of the ~oman Forum has been laid bare, togethe :- with considerable portions of the Fora of the ~aesars, and what was, fifty or seventy years ~go, a simple cow-pasture,-Campo Vaccino as it was called, is now an excavation, an eighth of a mile in diameter, thirty feet, at least, below the level of the modern city, and disclosing the very bases of those monuments and consecrated .structures which once consti- tuted the environment of the conquerors and law givers· of the world. It may be well here to remember a differ- ence between Roman and Greek civilization, and its bearing upon this subject. Greek ·civilization, relatively speaking, was scattered. Excavation in Greece is not, and need not be, largely confined to one centre. Athens did not hold a position in Greece corresponding to that which Rome occupied in Italy. Greece was broken up politically into numerous states, ·each of which had its chief city. In Italy Rome became the centre from which govern- ment radiated the Hub, as it were, in fact as well as in name. In Greece it is import_ant to excavate many cities. The American ex- cavations at Corinth are as significant as those ~of the Germans or the Greeks at Athens, or Olympia, or of the French at Delphi. But ex- cavate ancient Ron1e, and you have accon1- plished two thirds at least of your necessary task. On the other hand,. ancient Greek sites, though sometimes lying beneath modern vil- lages, are yet easy of access, compared with the hidden treasures of the Roman city. At Rome we rnust distinguish a;t least three dis· tinct periods of civilizations, the ancient, the mediaeval and the modern. The signs of these are massed together in one confused heap on the seven hills, and ~in their immediate neighborhood. Roman life has been n1ore or less active within the limits of the district now encom- passed by the Aurelian walls, since the days of Romulus. 1\'he. ancient Greek city on the contrary had its period of ascending and then feH into decay ; another period seldom ex- ceeded the duration of four or five hundred years. In the interval there has been little to disturb its repose, except earthquakes and the ordinary damage effected by the hand of titne. What was o nee there, though shattered and disrupted and buried, nevertheless in large ·measure remains, awaiting the hand of the ex- plorer. But the relics of antiquity at Rome have suffered in a thousand ways, until the soil has given up a very large proportion of that which it once covered and protected, to the greed of the labor owners of the lands. Thus while the antiquities of Greece are to be sought for in isolated spots, far re- moved from any n1odern habitation, those of the Italian city are seen in close proximity with all the accompaniments of the life of to- day. The Ca1npus l\tlartius is filled to overflowing with ancient, mediaeval and modern struc- tures. The Quirinal hill is the abode of royal- ty. 0!1 the Vatican lives the Pope. Horse .. cars and trolley-lines pass within view of the palaces of the Caesars. Mainertime prison lies beneath the church of St. Joseph the Car- penter. The Capitolin Mount is obscured by n1odern buildings. · Yet in spite of the difficulties thus presented to the investigation, the results obtained fully justify the search, for the fragments that re- main are full of meaning and suggestiveness to the keen and dii igent student.

GLOBE HOTEL, ALBANY.-Adv. MR. MC ELROY'S LECTURE. The H·on. William H. McElroy, Union, .. '6o, delivered a lecture in the College . Chapel ~ast :Friday a fternqon on '' Personal Recollections of Oliver 'Vendell Holmes .. '' President Raymond introduced the speaker as ~'Author, Editor and Poet and one of the most honored alumni of Union.\ Mr. Mc- Elroy began his lecture with the story of a western man who, on being asked if his wife was entertaining this winter, replied, \not very.'' \And so,\ added the speaker, \'if this proves uninteresting it will not be be- cause of the subject.'' Mr. McElroy said in part :·\When a great man dies we search the horizon in vain for his successor ; his class has disappeared with him. This is not strictly true in all cases but it certainly applies to Oliver Wendell Holmes. We shaU never see his like again. The genius of Holmes manifested itself in many ways but, nevertheless it eludes all touch and test and re- . \ mains unclassified among the original elements. After having considered his strength and sweetness, his wisdom and wit his incisive in- sight ana his large human heart. What is known as the personal equation has still to be taken into account and that is beyond elucida- tion. Holmes belonged to the Golden Age of the Lyceum, to the age of men like Emerson, George William Curtis and John B. Gough. A great g;roup in which Holmes always held his own. As I remember hiln he possessed a slim, almost boyish figure, v\'ery bright and flashing eyes and a nervous temperament.'' Mr. Mc- Elroy then told of a lecture that he had heard Hohnes deliver in Albany in which he repeats his beautiful poem \The Hudson River.'' The speaker continued: \ I first met Holmes at adinner given by the Atlantic l\Ionthly to its co11 tributors in' honor of J. G. Whittier on his 70th birthday. rrhere were some of my MSS •. which had not been rejected and so I was urged to attend. There were present, THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 H1nry W. Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, John G. Whittier, Oliver Wenden Holmes, Mark Twain, Charles Elliot Norton, William Story, William Dean Howells, John Trow .. bridge and a score of others. It was at the dinner that Holmes read a poem which illus- trates his genius for an occasional poem. It was here also that Mark Twain perpetrated that famous ( or infamous) speech which seemed to throw all Boston into a state of mind. After dinner, while talking to Holmes I asked hitn which of all his poems he consid- ered the best. After some hesitation he •re- plied, \The· Chan1bered Nautalis. '' During the course of his lecture, JVIr. Mc- Elroy read interesting extracts· fron1 some of Hohnes' letters, especially tho.se to Dr. Hale. The lecturer's repetition of a few of Holmes' poems was 1nost instructive. It was a privilege even to see a man who had known such celebritiet and it was indeed a double privilege to hear Mr. McElroy speak, whose whole address was characterized by that \ grace which is the result of forgotten toil.\ SOPHOMORE SOIREE. \There was a sound of revelry by night\- last Friday night-in Memorial Hall, and the general verdict given is that the Sophomores are irreproachable as hosts. Everything in connection with the Soiree tended to make it a most enjoyable affair. The floor which was laid at much trouble and expense proved to be far better than expectation allowed and all the appointments were perfect. The fraternity booths . added to the attrac- tiveness of the Hall and the decorations were greatly to be admired. Needless to say, \Joe'' seemed to surpass himself. The following account is taken in part from a local paper for Saturday morning: ''Whatever the tnembers of the class of 1906, Union College, may have done in the past to distinguish themselves; however fa,.

Lectures. Mr. l\1cElroy's lecture last Friday after· noon was thoroughly enjoyed by every one who was fortunate enough to be present. His per· sonal recollections of America's greatest literary men of the nineteenth century, were wonderfully interesting. It brought to one's mind Brownin~'s : '~ Ah, did you once see Shelley plain, And did he stop and speak to you And did you speak to him again? How strange it seems and new ! '' The humor in Mr. McEkoy's lecture was highly origin- 1 al and never failed to produce the desired effect on his audience. Those students who were not present missed one of the best addresses that has ever been beard in the Chapel. It was noticeable that there was only a comparatively small part of the student body there, while the friends of the college seemed to have anticipated what was in store. These lecture~ are part of a liberal education and it adds to any one's cultivation to listen to a scholarly address. It is a mistake and a very foolish one at that to think that just because attendance is not compulsory that it is un- necessary to attend these lectures. They by men of national reputation and it is always a privilege to hear them. Such speakers are in great demand and it is , no easy matter for the college authorities to secure them. When, therefore, the opportunity of hearing another lecture presents itself, let us show our appreciation for those who invite the speaker and for the speaker himself by being present as the representative body of under- graduates. The Soiree. The members of the class of r go6 are to be congratulated on their entry into society. Of the many dances held in Memorial Hall, fe\VJ if any, have surpassed the Soiree of last Friday in bril. Hance and enjoyment. The affair was a complete success and can well be taken as a model for all coming - annua 1 college dances. We trust the committee, whose efforts were crowned with such success, has come out at the large end of the financial horn.

No.17. ~-----·- --~ - ---- --=- -====---===========================-==========================================- --rHE !vllND IN SLEEP. (From •' Psychology and Common Life'' by Professor Frank Sargent lioffman.] ·r t is surprising, when we stop to refl. ect upon it, how tnnch of our brief sojourn upon this plane~ is devoted to sleep. At the outset of o:..u· existence ah11ost every n1on1ent is spent in sleep, and at the clirnax of our powers from one third to one half of our tin1e must be given up to it. The great majority of lower animals are ·wrapped in sleep n1ost of the time and not n1uch n1ore than half awake the rest of th!e time. No human being is ever absolutely awake. The best one ·can do is to vibrate he- tw.een deep sleep ancl high or low degrees of wa·kefulness. If we had to decide the ques- tion as to which was the normal condition, sleep or wakefulness, we certain 1 y would have to decide in favor of sleep as regards the lower animals, anll probably as regards the vast n1a- jority of n1en. Son1e think that 1f it had not been for hunCYer we should never hare waked 0 up at all. In spite of the fact that eyery hurnan be-ing from the titne of Aua1n has known by congtant experience ·what sleep is, nobody h~1s yet been able to explain it in a satisfactory manner. The best. illforn1eu physiologists c1o not at- tempt to define it. They readily admit that tl1:e;y can tell us little about huw it ~Lrises, about the st;.~te of the body during-:its (:(jntinu· ance, or how it produces its v:triutts eCfects. * * All e:tdnTit that ordinary sleep is attended by a diminished activity of son1e of the nerve- centres of· the brain and of the spinal cord. 'I'he centres of 1:eflex action are also partially inactive. and even those connected witb tl1e precei~ses absolutely essential to life, such as the action of the heart and lungs, are more or· less in repose during profound sleep. * * 'The occurrence of sleep at night is .more· largely a matter of convenience and habit than of 11ecessity. The darkness and stillness of night favor sleep, but there does not seem to be any vital connection between the diurnal changes of night and clay and the changes in the nervous energy of the body. Many of the lower animals habitually sleep during the day and search for their food d~1ring the night. Nan.y hibernate for months at a ti1ne during th·e winter, and persons vvhose occupations necessitate that they should work at night and sle~p by day easily adapt themselves to there- quirement. * * * * It is probable that no two tilnes of going to sleep or of awaking are precisely alike in any in eli vidual. rrhe senses ll ndou btedly fall asleep at different times in different degrees and avvake in unlike proportions. One sense may fall asleep while all the others are active and several senses may be asleep while one alone is perfonning its usual functions. Soldiers often sleep on the 1 ine of n1arch in all their powers except the rnusc1es of the leg which still keep up the required n1ovement. Sailors S leer) clino·ina to the ri~ro·incr in a sitnilar Inan- t:. b bb b aer. * * * That all 111en drean1 there can be no ques- tion; we only need to refer to our daily expe- rience in confirmation of the fact. But it is also probably ttue that there is no such thing, in 1nan at least, as dreamless sleep. It has been argued that all drea1ns occur just before going to sleep or just before waking. rrhis may be true of our ·most vivid drean1s, but it may easily be disproved of all our dreaming by

Changes in the distribution of blood are con- stantly taking place. It .is also to be r:emem- bered that even if all the other senses were quiescent the entire surface of the skin is al- ways sending impressions to the brain in the profoundest sleep. Thieves in India make constant use of this fact. It has always been observed that as a rule -we quickly forget our dreams. One of the reasons why we do this is that the act of awak- ing causes our dream thoughts to dissipate and our perception of the real objects by which we are constantly surrounded when we wake up is so much more vivid that the experiences of sleep are soon obliterated. How much ·would we reme111ber of our thoughts by day if we should lie still all the time on a sofa with our ears stopped up and our eyes covered with a bandage? How many of us remetnber with distinctness more than a fraction of what passes through our minds in a single hour even when we are most completely in conscious possession of our po·wers? * * * Assutning then that to sleep is to dream, the definite problem we have before us is simply this: what is the condition of the rnind in dreams? And in the first place we observe that we are always limited to the materials of our pCJ.st experience in our dreams. In other words, we never dream about anything the elements of which have not in some way come withi~1 the realtn of our past observation. That a person born blind never drean1s of see- ing is well established by com pet en t i nvestiga- tors. ·Hundreds of cases were examined not long ago by Professor J astrow in the asylums .for the blind in and about Philadelphia, and in no instance was a person found blind from his b·i:rth ·who- even in a dream believed that ·he saw. Many have undertaken to collect evi- deuce. concerning the dreams of. pe !SO·q·~: ~O:t:~: deaf, and all agree. that they neve.r . dreaPl. . about hearing, although they d.o . so1ne~im,es dream about experiencing vibratiops S·\!Ch as. would eo1ne thr·ough the organism ~s a w-h().1~­ from the :firing of a cannon or the loud. bef:ltiQg, ~ of a drum. •• 4 •· ... There is no exception to the rule that. our·. dreams are always made up of those thing~ that we have had something to do with in' out past experience. This experience . may long . . . ago have fad.ed out of ou.r conscious 1n.emory,., or may have been so slight as not to have b.e.en definitely remembered by the conscious ego at all; it n;1ay perhaps consist of traces le.ft upon the brain by the deeds of our ancestors now ·' many generations remote. But in some way or other it sets a litnit to our mental activity beyond \vh.ich we cannot pass. One of the most striking peculiarities of the. mind in sleep is the little attention it pays ~o the relations of tin1e and space. * · * The number of scen.es that n1ay pass through the mind of the dreamer in aln1ost an instant is so large as to be well-nigh incapable of cal- culation. Count Lavalette tells us that' one· night, when he was i1nprisoned under the sen- tence of death, he dreatned that he stood .,.r'or·· five hours at the corner of one of the streets 6f Paris, and witnessed a continuous succession of harrowing scenes of blood, every moment of the ti1ne teeming with excited feeling. In reality he was asleep less than two tninittes·: Many other cases have been recorded wh·ere ·a. succession of events has passed through the mind of the drean1er and been regarded ·as years in transpiring, which must h~ve beep dreamed about in onlv a few seconds:· ·Tlre \ nearest analogy to this state in wakefulnes~ is when one becon1es aware that ·he it; tott'eririg on the brink of a precipice, or ·going down un.o: der the water for the last time.· All the events of a lifetime seetn at· such a moment to prd: ... sent themselves·to view. 'I' his lack- of:..·p~ope.f appreciation of time and space in dreams is

. GLOBE HO'l'EL, ALB.A.NY.-Adv~ largely due to the fact that the senses are not sending. in th.eh· reports one after another· in their usual m~nner, and the moven1ents of ex- ternal objects by which we helped to measure titne are not being· attended to. The n1ind is absorbed in cornhining together the in1ages an:d ideas which memory furnishes it out of the experiences of the past. TRE ~ooNOORDIENSIS. 7 We may also see why there is usually an absence of moral responsibility in our dreams. Responsibility involves choice. But where free will is lacking there can be no choice. Furthermore in dreams, as we have already seen, the conditions of a sound judgment on any subject are wanting. Not only is the relation of the n1ind to t:he external world con .. stantly shifting and fall of incongruities, but no clear connection is nrade by the mind with its ovvn acts or states. Ilil this chaos of ideas and feelings; right jadgrnents are impossible. No opportunity is present for determining what we ought to do or to be. It is for this reason that conscience rarely troubles us in our drearns, although when we awake we may be filled with the deepest shame and n1ortifica- tion at the recollection of our conduct. * * This leads us to observe that of all our mental powers fancy has the fullest play in sle~p. Fancy is the n1ind's power for putting to.gether past acquisitions into all sorts of haphazard retations without reference to any definite plan or purpose, and this is the usual chan~c~er of _t.h~_ proflu~ts o.f our. dre,ap.1s. In this state or conditon the rnental energy is literally spent in giving. to airy nothingness a l0cal habitation and a natn e. People change Modern psychologists .and phys;iologists are their ag~; their sex, their cou11 try, their occupa- now agreed that the phenomena of dreams are tiQn; perh~p~ in one and the same drean1, dependent on natural causes.

Professor Hoffman, in his pre· fac~ to ' Psychology.:and Common Life' has _the followip.g . ' . .: interesting statement : ' Not many generations ago the all absorbing theme WaS physics an~ little atteJ?-tiOn . was'- paid to other studies. J\ater biology became the dom.i· · nant science and gave. direction to th~ ~current of thought. Now psychology has come to· ~he front and holds undis- puted sway.' This opi11:ion is one in which the criti7, from his observation of the public, can heartily concur.\ Track Practice. Regular practice for candidates for the track team ·~s ·held everY: afternoo.~ at 4· 30 in the Gymnasi~m. In this work it's never too soon to begin and while .it is a little early as yet to start regular training, consiste~t exercise taken n.ow will ~~k~ a -mart stro~g enough to take training without fear of any bad effects due to too su@den a change.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XXVII. UNION C'OLLEGE, FEBRUARY 24, 1904. No.18. .POE AND FRENCri LITERATURE. Fear was ~he primitive temper of the human race. It lies deep in :us stiH ; and in some minds of high development the ,restless dread, the shuddering superstition of tb.e savage have been sublimed into a new kind of cosn1ic terror. Not fear in the concrete but fear in the abstract, fear of the 1J nknown and of the great Fates. that govern onr lives. Poe was preetninently a writer whose stories. deal with the ernotion of fear. He is n1aster · of those who are impressionable. Throughout: his works there broods a deep melancholy, a great terror of the intangible and an undying despair of the fatefulness of human existence. 1,here is no writer in ·whom these ~characteris· tics are so clearly n1arked as in Poe. His genius is incl i vidual, distinct. I-Iis n1erit as a. literary artist is never questioned although his. taste 1nay be. His style in lofty imagination and clear analysis is clearly marked. He often touches on the sublitne and in this fea- ture he is unexcelled. After Lotlis XVII of France had reaped the whirlwind of the French Revolution, the coun- try was rife. for impressions. Napoleon rose to the highest pinnacle of glorr, only. to be cast down to defeat and exile. The whole land was in a feverish state, convalescing from the mighty upheaval caused by national wrongs collecting, unheeded, for centuries. This condition extended far into the nineteenth century and who can say, even today, that France ha.s not still son1e of that fever in her blood ? During the last century, France was in a fit condition to receive impressions. During this period many literary men of merit lia ve arisen in France and each one has been influenced more or less by the past and the present condition of his country. Edgar Allan Poe is the idol of the in1pres- sionable. His poems indicate that human perception is inexorably limited, and that there is no vital perception of the eternities that lie beyond it. 'r:he melodious earthly despair of the '' Raven '' inspired the serene heavenly contrast of H:ossetti's '' Datnozel..\ What is true, in this connection of his poetry is none the less so of his prose. What can be n1ore vivid than the ''Fall of the house of Usher\ or more analytic than his ''Murders in the Rne Morgue\ ? Poe lived a feverish life, for his means af- forded him little or no co1nfort. He also was itnpressionable and hts tastes were the direct outcome of his temperament. Poe's detective tales probably had n1ore in· fluence on French literature than his poetry. A French1nan delights in the bizarre, the in1· aginative, and what can be 1nore so tlian \1'he Purloined Letter,\ or '' The 1\lystery of Marie Roget\ ? Poe's analytical pow·er is sho'Yn in the tales, ·where he makes l\L Dupi11, the pri- vate detective of Paris, discover alinost in1· possible clews to 1nys.teries. I:-Iis poems also, however, have their share of influence. To a French mind what could be so weirdly at- tractive as \ Alal ume\ or \The Bells'' ? and what so beautiful as \ The haunted palace \? T'he eminent French scholar and critic Jules Le1nai. tre, ranks Poe with Shakespeare and Plato ! 1'his may seen1 like exaggeration and yet to the French heart Poe is probably closer than either 0 { the other two. The French poet Baudelaire was a great admirer of Poe and translated 1nany of his works. It is not unlikely that he drew tnuch of his own ability from studying Poe and his n1ethods . Balzac excels Poe in analysis but just the re· verse is true in condensation. Balzac may be said to be the first true Frenchrnan who made 1: I. I I. I·· ' i' i . 1

'I i 'I ' 6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. a study of analysis.. Poe was an adept at this and he was n.ot influenced from France, but did not Balzac give the finishing touches to his .analysis by Poe's influence? vVe are sure he did. Coming down to more recent years, Poe's influence in France has not died out. If the writers are at all sensible to melancholia or we may even say to the weirdly sublime, and _Poe's influence has touched them, it shall as- suredly affect their writings.. To an eminent- ·ly practical or utilitarian mind Poe stands for little or nothing. But since one of the most characteristic etnotions of the French is their sensibility to impression, Poe's influence has been wide spread in that ·country and ever will be so long as Frenchmen remain French- _ men. ''Little ,even of the little do ·we have left of Poe's works to remember hi·m by. Call him if you will the least of the immortals, but let us trust that imn1ortal he n1ay be : that the ever gathering wind which bears down to us the odors of th~ Past sha11 carry always a trace of the bitter fragrance crushed out from this de- spairing soul !''

Rooker, formerly of the apostolic delegation at Washington, but recently appointed Bishop of J aro in the Philippines. According to an official report of church matters from the Philippines Bishop Rooker has been the central figure in son~e stirring scenes since his advent in his new field. His energies have been especially directed against the Aglipay party, and in one incident, at least~ he ignored ecclesiastical procedure and adopted heroic mititary method~ to obtain his end.

. I THE ~CO'NCORDIENSIS. vV;fuen :Bishop Rooker arrived in Jaro, ac- cording to the report and a letter fron'l Chief J!Usti:ce John rr. I:vf.cDonough of the Philip- pines, he found that several of the most prorninent of his churches had been taken out of his diocese. One of these, near Iloilo, in an. in land barrio inhabited solely by natives, -was a costly stone church erected by :the friars just before the Spanish war. Bishop Rooker determined to take this church of San .Augustine, and at the hotel in Iloilo, where he ·was staying, he dec]a·red his intention of doing so on. the following day. He was warned that su cb an atternpt would be dangerous. ''If I had wanted a soft snap, p replied the J3i shop, \ I wo u 1 d have r e 111 a in e d in. the Unit- ed States. I came out here to work, and I am not going to be bluffed by the Aglipay party. I am going to take that church and sone others besides.'' The report says there were then twenty .An1e~ricans in Iloilo, and although on1y four of them were Catholics, they announced that if the \ Yankee Bishop'' would fight for h1s cbu r~h they would help hi1n. The Sheriff led the party, which was well armed. ''After several hours' journey,\ says the re- port, \we arrived at the barrio, of several tho11sand inhabitants. Great was the excite- :ment when our mission became known. 1,he Pr~esidente was in possession of the church key and from him Bishop Rooker demanded it. T a~is was refused, the Presiden te declaring that ~he church was public property. Bishop R.ooker replied that it was church property- R.ornan Catholic Church property--and that the Aglipay party had better attend to poli- tics and leave church matters and church prop- erty alone. '''The Americans gathered about the Bishop and the Presidente. The Americans exhibit- ed th.e con tents of their hip pockets. 1'he key was surrendered. Bishop Rooker unlocked the door, removed the altar stone, relocked the door, put the key in his pocket and an- notln~ed to the crowd that had gathered that he would celebrate tnass in the church on the following Sunday. The B~ishop addressed the people in Spanish, teUing then1 that he liaci gone there to defend the church, not to sur...: render it. l-Ie bestowed his blessing on them and, amid the cheers of the A1nericans and t:t few natives, returned to his abode some miles away. ''In the course of a week word reached the city that the i\.glipay party intended to drive a herd of carabaos into the church during the serv1ce. The An1erican s heard of the threat to desecrate the sacred edifice and volunteered to accompany Bishop l{ooker, saying that if any atten1pt were tnade to execute the threat there would be tnore dead carabaos in the barrio than were there at the height of the rinderpest. rl'hey went. Bishop Rooker, with a revolver best de hin1 on his throne, said the 1nass and preached to the people in Spanish, and not a carabao was in sight.\ 1,he report says that the church was crowd- ed, but the congregation was sulky and not entirely respectful. It is stated that Bishop Rooker has had sin1ilar experiences in obtain- ing other church property in his diocese, and that Bishop Dougherty in the north has follow- ed the example set by Bishop Rooker in the south. The report declares that the talk that ''the friars tnust go \ is dying out. They will have to stay for some time to cotne, it says, as their withdrawal now would leave millions of people without religious ministra- tions.-N. Y. Sun. '~/ '65--Warren G.

'67,..-It is a common charge against the pul- pit that it is controlled by the rich men of the congregation and that it is too subservient to the vested interests. That there is another side to the question is shown by Dr. Teunis S. Ham lin in an article published recently in The Cum berland Presbyterian. This author bold- ly asserts that tnen of wealth are a much need- ed factor in religious progress. Dr. I:-Iamlin admits that there are some in- stances of subserviency, \and it is wholly con- temptible. Eut far more nun1erous are the in- stances of cheap flings, jibes and sneers. The popularity seeker has an unfailing resource in sarcasn1 directed at the prosperous. One is distressed to hear ministers who should be en- tirely above such sensationalism raising a laugh by allusions to the weal thy or to leaders of so~ ciety; usually in blissful ignorance of the fac.t that his words disclose how little he knows what he is cliscussi ng There are rich n1eu, leaders in society and politics, who are selfish, corrupt, debauching to both private and pub- lic morals. Their sins should be unsparingly exposed and denounced. But the assum pti()n that because a man has wealth, reputation, leadership, he is necessarily a bad tnan, and a fair target of public slurs and defama.ti on, is the outco1ne of ignorance and bigotry. Such men have the right to be addressed from the pulpit with the same respect and courtesy as the poorest members of the congregation,\ . ~·

Just because a man is not an u-pperclassman seems no real reason why he should not have the right to speak. He is permitted to vote and often has something more lmport.a11t to say than most of the old reUable Senior babblers. It is time that something was done about this. There. can, at least, be no ·earthly excuse for stamping a man down when he wishes to preseJ.ilt some motion or some idea touching college affairs before the student body. A Sophomore wiU generally speak his own mind for he has not yet become saturated and warped with Colile'e politics. Since he has College spirit, give him the oppor· tunity to show it. Hockey. The Hockey team certainly deserves great credit for the showing made against the Mohawk Club. Since the idea of the rink on the eampus fell through, (and no one is to be blamed for it except everyone) those interested in Hockey have been playing under Union's name, although the organization has not been rec0gnized by the Athletic Board. Perhap~ not this season, but we~ wmtld suggest that, if circum· stances are as propitious next year as they are this, that some· step be taken for recognition of the Hockey Team. Surely they are now reflecting credit on Union and the or- ganizati0n deserves to be recognized as a regular branch of college athletics. Professor Ashmore. The student body extend their sym- pathy to Professor Ashmore for his loss in the death of his mother. EGYPT . The River of the Ages rolls along Disconsolate thro' all the level tracts, Yet surges, singing some wild deathly song \Vhen its vast volume takes the cataracts.

Some of the opinions given were these: President Eliot of Harvard: The frittering away of the student's tin1e in trivial self-indulgent occupa- tions .a.nd animal pleasurec;; Provost liarrison of the U ni -;;er~.;i ty uf Pennsylvania: 'The sepa- ration fron1 the sacred ties of home and proba= b1y church l·de, also ternptations to explore phases of life to which the student had been a stranger; Professor ] oh n E.

He n1aintains that a man cannot translate frorn one language to anothf'r cor- rectly if his 1nind is prepossessed with opin.- ions on the subject. Prof. Srniley has taken several Greek sJ·udents ,rho have never read the Bible and who do not believe in Christian doctdnes, and is securing frorn them transla- tions of the Bible fro1n the Greek. He believes that only in this way can an exact translation be secured, since the former' translators have b~en in.fluenced by their previous kno\vledge of the contents.--Ex. 1\fr. J am·es B.
