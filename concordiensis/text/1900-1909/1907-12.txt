THE CONCORDIENSIS ' FRESH:M~A'N BANQUET. O.n Wednesday las·t the .a.nnual banquet of tha fre:shman ·cla$:s occurred. The pla•ce was the H·otel Tourwine of J.o~nstown, N. Y., the H1ne was nine ·by the ·clock, a11d the ·.s.cene, (after the sopho•m.o~res arrived) w.as one ,uf destruction. The whole affair was kept a :s·eeret till Wed- nesday afternoon when tlhe so~phomores noUced ·the :scarcity of 19'11 ma·teri.al on 'the cam·pus and woke up 'to the :fact that something was Hlp. After that they ea.sUy traced t1l·e uppe'r-.classmen to Johnstown. The freshmen left Schenectady in all directions buf the right one and arrived on the seene at J·oh·nstown any ·time fron1 3 to 8 p. m. With a few ·exceptions they eiude.d 1the watchful eyes of 1910 and ~arrived safely. The sophs began to .a.ppe:ar about 8 o'·claock and at 9 p. m. 1 w~1en the banquet con1:menced there were about 30 of the·m o-utside th·e hotel. The ban- quet went .smoothly until after the second c1ourse, Vi·-1len the enemy ·.::;ueceeded rn b'reaking inbo TJhe hotel and .attacked the .poliee;men :at ;the do·or of the hanquet hall. At the first alarm. the entire .freshm.an ·Class, rushed ·out to the aid of ·the police· force. Then resulted a hand-to-hand conflict which ·would have caused the speedy eviction of the at:t.a;cking party had not one sop:ho•m.·ore, moTe wily than t!ne .ot'h- ers, rushed in with a .bottle of strong .ammonia and threw it into ~the Toom. Although seve·ral men .were ·d 1 iSa:bled ·by this method of attack, the cla·ss ,of 1911 rallied ~and fina.lly ·ejected the class of 1910. In the mean- time last year's freshmen 1 h.ad ·suceeeded in .breaking all the windows -of U1e dining room and most of the dishes on the tabJ.e:.s. :The freshmen were boun·d n·ot to give in, ·so they had tihe la:St ·eourse of the ;banquet served and the toast ·ust was ~carried to its e~onclusio:n. 1\~J.st of the toasts w·ere bright and witty and . went far towards ·making up .fo·r ·the :confusion t 1 hat cam·e ·before. The '!Janquet~·eom 1 mittee had ~a troubles.om·e tin1e in arranging ·tlhe ·banquet this year :and found 'it difficult to find .a ·sui·table :place on ac-· count of the reputat'i1on .whioch freshmen banquets have .acquired .with an .hot-el !men. 'T.here were two •otheT plans .for the hanquet beside the one ca·rrieod ·out. The first was to take every.body rto Springfield, M~ass., on a 'S·peocial .,... trailil. T'he second tpl:an was to hold the banquet at Kingston ,and! charter a :boat to {ake tifie men d1own and :back, so that on.ce the freshmen and upper-elas·smen were· on the ·boat, their enemies w~ould not know whe're· they were going, nor ·could they g~o al·ong with ·thenL Both of these plans f8l1 through, however, beeause the hot·el man~g­ E'rB backed out at the l~ast momen.:t. Although the hanquet was n1ot an entire suc- cEs-s., H turned ou:t to the ·satisfaction of every- body eoneerned, except per:haps, the town of Johnstown. The freshmen are s.aHsfied, the up- per-classmen all agree tha.t they fh,ad a good time, and t 1 he 'B-opho-mores are jubilant over the facs thwt they d·isturbe-d the. \Peace. of _ Johns:tnw.n.\ There follows a list of the toasts and the Ban- quet :Committee: TOASTS.

Last 8 aturday evening in a poorly :playecl game of basketha.U the 'varsity went down to defeat at the hand~B of her ·old rival, R. P. I. The only ex·cuse that ean be offered is t~1at the 'va·r\ 'Sity lacked the ·practice that bTings tea1n work and good basket 'S'llooting. T'he game started with a rush after Union had chosen to .defend the west goal. The ball .for seve:rai minutes remained in R. P. I.'s territory, but Union W•a:B unable 'to get the first •basket and Inglis .opened .the sc-oring . .Severa.! foul'S were called for ·rough .playing but they always hap- pened to be dou·ble fouls. Tifie first half ·was not In·arked hy a-ny phenomenal plays although Clowe .and Starbuck played the m•a.st ·c~r:tsistent ga:me for the 'varsi,ty and Inglis for R. P. I. by making :::;even batskets. Both .sides lh.a!d hard luck i~1 throwin·g fouls, :Starbuck making one ·out of seven chances and W-ager none out of four chances. An- derson th'rew t:w·o out of three of his ·chances at fouls. S.coTe at the e·nd ·of first naif: Union, 9; R. P. I., 20. In the second half the visitors 'SWept the 'var· ·Bi ty off their .feet and s:eored five or six baskts bef.ore Union realized the·ir predicament and tlhen it was t/oo late. The l·atter •part of tt'he se·cond half I was veTy rough and Union got in some of her best ·playing in spite of the .rougnness. All her four baskets were seored in the last five minute·~ of tplay. This half ended R. P. I., 22; Union, 10. Captain Starbuck was injure•d in the ·se.cond half .and Buck took 'his place, while BeTg:an took Clnwe's place. Union did not ·play in her old f.or1n ·of last year, but g.ood, ·hard practice from now on will give the 'varsity an ex.cellent ·C'hfllnce of winning fTom the Troy aggreg~ation when they meet again.

LITERARY DEPARTMENT DR. GEORG.E ALEXANDER. Rev. George AleX!an·der, b. D., GhanceUor ad interim ·OL Union UHiversity and President ad interim of Union College, was born dn West Charl- to-n, Sar8Jto.ga County, N. Y ., on Oct. 12, l843, of sturdy Scotch descent, in a fa,n1ily well known for lofty ideals of life and for inherited virtue. 1Hi.:S education, preparatory to his college eourse, was re,ceived at ·Charlton Acade1ny, a little 'Pri- vate school ·Fo:at has been for.tuna:te indeed in r.aving been ]Jrivileged to send to Union College .suc'h men as Dr. Alexander and the late Rev. Tennis S. Hamlin_, D. D,, of the class of 'G7, one cf the n1ost eloquent .pulpit orators in this .country. Dr. AlexandeT .entered Union Gollege in 1863 in hiB Hophon1ore year, gnaduating in ':66 at the head .of his class and receiving rnen1bers·hi'p in the honorary Phi Beta Kappa .Society. He ·was the w-inaer of the Ingha1n essay prize, whic'h had been offered that year for the first tilne. During his life .at Union he was .an acHve meln,ber of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, of the PhHomatll- ean Literary Society, and was prominent in othel' co1lege activities. F·or two year;:; after gradu~tion Dr. Alexande1: w.as a private tutor in the fain 1 ilY o.f Gov. Lucius Robinson. In 1867 'he entered Pr·in·ceto·n Theolog- ical S.mnina.ry, fron1 which 1 b.e graduated in '70. Frnm this tilne until 1883 he was 1pa:stor of the East Avenue Pres.byteri.an Chtrrch in t.his eity, and during the last six years -of this ·pa.storate he held the profess.orship of logic and rhetoric in 1 hi:s Al•m,a Mater, receiving from iller i·n 1884 the degree ·Of \doctoT ·divinitatis.\ Ahout this time Dr. Alexander re·ceived :a call to the University Pla-ce Presbyterian Church of New York City, and now for almoist a quar:ter of a century he haB •been affiliated wHh tn.at church. The high es-teen1 in w'hi·cib. Dr. Alexan- d·er is 'held throughout t.he ·m1inisterial world is attes;ted to ·by .the fa·ct of his being President of the Bo.ard of Foreign M·issions of the Presbyter- ian Church. In ·tfhe n1etropoli.s Dr. Alexander ha:s been th(~ leade·r in an extens-ive 1ntssionary w·ork in tae tenement districts, and he has a:chieved grea·t re- sults among the t]j}eo·:p:le the·re. I-Ie 'is iden.tdfied with various institution:a, espec- ially t'hos·e of an edu.cational ehara.cter. He is President o.f the Board of Di'rec.tors of San Paulo Oollege in BrazH, Pres,ident of the New York College of Dentistry, Vice-presidell't <>:f the Coun- cil of New York University, and a dir·ector ·Of Princeton Theologi·cal :Sem-inary. His servi·ces t·o Old U·nion have been ,of the greatest importa.nce. He ·i·s .a life trustee of the College and a mem.ber of tib.e Board ·of ·Governors of 'the UniversUy. For several years past he has been chairman 1 of the Com·mittee ·On Instruotion, in which capacity his .ab.ility !ha;s been of great value. Dr. Alexander was .a ·mem.ber of the executive committee of the Centennial Anniversary in 1895 and chainnan of 'the com'm'Htee on publication. At this ·celebration he -delivered the memorial ssrm·on, \T'ne Influe·nce of Union Gollege in the ,Mbf'al an·d Rleligio·Hs' Wbrld.\ One o·f the closing ;sentences of this address is worthy of quotation. H·e .said: \Eternity al·one ·can reveal ~how muc'h the irenic spirit 'Of Un·ion College has done to ·s,o·ften the as.perities 'Of se,cta·rian strife and to extend the range ·Of Chri·sNa.n ~charity.\ Truly Dr. Alexa:nder is one of 1tlhose to whom Old Union has meant something f,ar more than a name. AI umni and undergraduwteiS alike are earns>St in tiheir ·desi're that he should ac,ceprt per- manently, reside in the President's 'house on the Hi1l. and form· a part ·of .the lives of the students.

! I I I I I I : . I i .T.HE CONCOI~DIENSIS. FR'IENDS. Wbea, fr,om ·the wide .and verdant plain:s, with sn1i1e-enw'reat·hed face T'he Fre.sh•man prances into view and thinks h0 owns the place, He looks upon the four year~· work as though 'twere alm•ost .done, And dreams of cheri:siheod ,prizes, w.hich .so·me day he shall have won; He thinks :before his strong right arm the c·raven S·Oph ll1U8t quail, ~or in the Freshman's lexicon, there'·s no such as ''fail''; But when the sage wh'o gui-des 'b.is steps doe·s for his kn·owledge ·call The Freshies soon find.s out that he ha:s run '::t,gainst .a wall. He finds 1 his golden dreams, like evening S·Ull· bem'lls go, And all the honor:s that he seeks are coming very 'slow; 'Tis then he seeks :s·ome kindly word, Fo..at to .his spi'rit lends 'rhe }Jriceless aid that he receives from his broth· ers and hi:s fr,iends. Time pa.8':3es ,on, and heals his wounds-for S!OL'- r·ows cannot last; He· thinks ·when .he's a so,phom'Ore, ali trouble will b·e paiSsed. But so1ne day, far t~oo late for class, he wakes- his 1 1lead a whirl- And think.:; how just the night before some fresh· im,an stole his girl. He looks upon his piled-up work, .and thinkJs with awful dread Of fearfHl ·term exa'ms that loon1 but one brief 1we.ek ahe:ad. The ·only rift in the ·shrouding ·cloud that o'e-r •D.·is way descends Are the tin1ely words and heartfelt aid of his ·brotber and his friends. A year rolls ·on, and still he brood:s in melancholy thought, Of all •his fun and festive Hmes-of his w·ork :that'-s g·one for naugb.t. He has n·ot gleaned from learning's field a veT-y plenteous st.ore; BY '08. Hle has n·ot puzzled out hi-s tasks; from P1rofs. ga.ined little more. Then, different ma1ids he's wont to 'meet and t·o ' each one he vow:s A love that fills the unive:r.se, as at their feet :he bows;. Hut, one by one, they cast him d·own, and all :h1s ·Offers sp:urn U :1til at la:st 1 the truth itself, Uipon .htB soul d,oes burn:-. \No girl Will cha:se a w'hite· cloud's ·shade\-fr·o'm Which may be inferred That no girl of the present day will ·trust a jun- ior's word, Though taking h'is flowers, presents, ·cash, until ·hi:3 spi'rit bend:s And scorned by her finds relief wHh his :brothers nnd •:his friends. In winter term of 1 Senior year his last am.biti-ons g'O No chance f.or 'him to win renown, the profs ·say he's too tslow But still, on Uni·on's gray old walls, he look::; w'ith tea?r-dirnlmed eye And thinkS' 'h·OIW soon the time will com.e to bid a last g·ood-bye To thG dear old place he's l·oved S•O well in s1pite ·of tra.nsien t care And as he looms .a reverend ·calm ·cD'mes to ihim 'a·s his ·share- As 'be thinks how o'·er tlhe plain of U.fe each one his journey wends, Not lonely though, ibut e'er helped on by his ob'r.oth- ers and his friend·s.

HEARD AT THE BANQUET. \My to·ast is \Gridirons:\ hut I don't intertd to talk about \Gridirons.\ I intend to talk ahouc the Freshmen, and I will divide 1ny subject into tw·o par~s: First, \FTeshmen and second, \Fresh- m8n in H·ockey.\ An •;::;peaking of baseball, wa would like to see as n1any Freshmen come out as not. l\tiy subjee-c. is \Gridirons but I don't intend to spe·ak about \Gridirons.\ \~·ow we want all the Freshmen wb.o can play basketball or baseball to come out, and if Y·OU, FreBh1nan, can't play ·baskethall ·or hase·ball, w·~1y come out and play baseball. There are four Soph.omores 1 out fur the hockey tea1n, but two of the:m are :no goo,d, therefore every Freshman should c·ome out for baskethall. \Now you may think I am straying fr.om my subject, for I think n1y toast is sup,posed to be on 'Gridir·ons,' but I d·on't intend to ·;:;peak on 'Grid- ir·ons.' I want to say a few words ahout comin<.! '-' out fo·r Uni·on. Come out and then everybody will say, \He did :fiis best fo~r Union.' It doesn''J n1ake .any difference whether you ·can do any· thing or not. Just ·come out for Union, and then everyb-ody will say, 'he did ·his best for Union.' Tt doe.sn't make any difference whetlher you get your 'U' or n·ot; 'if you don't get your 'U' then every- body will say, \He did his best f·or Union.' N-ow, my subject is 'Gridi'rons,' but I don't intend to speak about 'G·ridirons.' We know that things are prBtty well broken up here to-nigh·t. But I want t osay a word about coming out f.or Uaion. Now, you Freshn1en did pretty well in football t11is fan, B·O just get out and everybody will .say, 'He dhi his hest f.or Union.' \In ·conclusi-on, let me .say get ·OUt, and stay ~out. U you're not good enough to play on the scrub o·r on the 'varsity, ·Come out .and play ·On the 'varsity.

Evidently the F·reshieB were gettins worsted, for he say that many were just craw1ing fron1 the dibch below the Terrace and he saw the Hophs throwing huge quantities of snow upon them. 'Then ·the ;blood of his 'heroic g.randmothe!' boiled within him and he could ·contain him.self with difficulty.

The n1en advanced towa.rdB one another on the run, and met near the edge of the Terrace. Hiram turned sadly a way, for was not the bl·ood of his heroic grandmother, who had once captured a thief, liable to make him again jeopar- dize him.self? .A!h, the perversity of Ev·oluU.on! i' 'The fight drew nearer.
