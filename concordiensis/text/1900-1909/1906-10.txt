THE CONCORDIEN.SIS· VOL. XXX. UNION CO,LLEGE, OCT. 6, 19c4, No. I A Rational . System of Athletics and the hysterical enthusiasm of the studenl s Th€ widespread discussion to which the :game and a hero worshiping public have all com.- of f(')·G>tball was subjected during the past year while ostensibly a determined effort to rHt the ga.m·e of some of the more brutal aspects and elimina:ie as far a'S possible the physical dan- gers, :had at the same time a d;e~p~r significance. College faculties, newspaper· editors and the mere <:onservative public had begun to appre- ciate U1;at in the colleges and preparatory schoolc:; there had been developed a condition of affairs that .may justly be designatNl. as athletic in- sanity, Football had to bear the brunt of the cri.t icism for foot baH ·was chiefly responsible. WhRe I am well aware of the value of foot- baH as a, means of developing courage, ag- greess.iveness, self control, alertness, manHneRs an.d c 0llege spirit and have ahvays been a strong advocate of the gam·e under proper restrictio11S I am free to confess that owing to undis:puted pub lioity through the press and the 'hysterical interest developed in the general public, football bined to prepare a limited number of young gladiators for the slaughter. AthleHcs to win only is the slogan. Honesty, fair play, true sportsmanship have been cast to the winds. \A s-ol:Hld min.d in a sound: body\ is a pretty saying and one of the aims of education, but how is this to be realized under the \side line\ system that · prevatls so generally? Physical training is recogntzed by educators as a most E:·ssential department in every college, but how can its ends be acomplished if all its classes meet only upon the bleachers? The problem. is to reach the great mass of the student body whose need of systematiztd physical training is so pressing. Great sums f'f money a.re avaBable to build spacious stadiumc:; to nire ;professional coaches, maintain training tables, purchase expensive equipment, buy up a few athletes, great pressure can be brought to can be justly charged with the origination,. of bear to get students and alumni coaches to most of the evils that have crept into our ath- letic H:t:e. I believe too that the danger of ac- cidents is among the lesser of these evils. Our jnstitutions of learning are suffering fro:m a disease that we might call athleticitis. A cer- t::t n type of athletic interest has con1e to occuvy t(i)o prominent a place in the rninds of the ~tu­ dent body and of the alumni. We are su:ff€ri:-tg from a multiplicity of inter-collegiate contests aggravated by an overdose of newspaper pub- licity. The result has been that in our anxiety to win, tll€ drag nets, often baited with silver, have been out to secure the most talented of prep- school material, the choicest of our physical man\hood have been selected for exhibition pur- poses and high salarie{ coaches vvhose sole ambiti0n is to win, backed by frenzied finance make heroic sacri·fices in order to develop a \'·inning team, but there is no money and little enthusias,m for th.e fitting up of a dozen grid- irons and diamonds that all may have a chance to play. The squads are rapidly weeded out and only the choicest flowers are saved for cultiva- Uon. \Get off the field the varsity must have secret practice,\ is the cry. \Come out and get health and strength\ it ought to be. The student hhnself is largely to blame. A~­ sessed an athletic tax he is willing to see it all expended for the benefit of a favored few .s0 long as he is permitted to witness the spec- tacles that are provided for public amusement. vVihat would he say if the college after accept- ing his tution fee selected fifteen of the brightest minds to alone be taught mathematics? If nine others \Vith mechanical ability were chosen for

( !: l I i I 6 THE CONCORDIEN.SlS the engih·eering courses,. a few others allowed 'The faU meets, olass contests and the series of to study languages and the remainder were eon- fraternity relay races scheduled has :resulted. in stituted .a cheering squad to occupy the side :fi1fty men reporting :Dor training befor·e the pre- lines under the leadership of an enthus.iastitC' professor of \yeHology ?\ It is the students' business to demand his rights in this matter; to insist that provision be made that all may enjoy and receive the benefits of eexrci:se and recreation out of dom~s; to bring such pressure to bear that college authorities shaH be free to heed the demancl. Such an ideal condition however, will never p~r-e­ vail unless the student bestirs himself. So long as through laziness or indifference to his own physical welfare he i:s willing that present ·Con- ditions shaH prevail just so long will they 're- main in force. The adop:tion and development of a rational scheme of physical training which shall reach the entire student body does not necessitate the elimination of the inter-collegiate contest nor is it desirable that it should do so. Neither does it require a lowering of the standard of varsity tea1ns but on the contrary through arousing the active interest of all the students much valuable material will be found which would otherwise remain undeveloped. Fewer outside games should be played. Ma,ny contests between class, fraternity and other or- ganizations should be arranged. Contests which do not require long weeks of severest training to fit the individual to take part. Ample fauH- ities for such contests should be provided. In- stead of catering to the few star athletes to the exclusion of the rest the college should aim to elevate the average physical standard of ... hE entire stnc1•::ht body. Since football has been abolished temporarily at Union we have had a chance to put a rational Hminary meet for novi-ces was run off. Sure•ly a record attendance for fall track work. 'There ~is, however,. a great need for mor.e tlia- m·onds so that several games might be JT p.ro·gress at the sam.e time. Any system of ath- letics devoted to the interests of the whole stu:- dent body must have a geRer.ous equipment in the way of ground's. More irnporta:n:t than cost- ly stadiums are br.oad fields tha~t many can en- joy. There shou~d be amp:1e funds to provide coaches to teach the finer points ·Of the sports that are engaged in, to furnish the essential parapherna.lia for games and to keep th!~ grounds tn condition. The college that adopts such a system and is able to provide the finances to develop it may not get a large proportion of the athletic stars li>ut it oug'ht to appeal strongly to the parents of the average hoy. It may not line its walls with championshi:p trophies but it will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that competi- tive sports are lil.@t the ·most important factor in its lif€ and that athletics occup.i.es a normal place in the minds of the student body.

Musical Notes The Glee Club has held several trials, and the retu.rn of almost all of last year's members aNd t:he coUection of several promising fresh- men point to a remarkably successful season. Kline '08, this year's leader, has 'had considerable experi.ence ln ,musical work and will in all probability continue the good work so exce;- ~en.tly started: by By Reed. The presence of over thirty aw plicants for positions on the dub has rnade competition much more lively, and this will assist materially in the development ·Of a fi,rst class organization. It has been deem- ed advisable to keep the club down to sixteen m:en, and on this basis a temporary list has been ttrranged. As it may be decided to put on four other men aJl the reserves should keep busy, as they- have excellent chances of making seve- ral of the trips. The present list follows: First tenor-Bis'hop '07, Fuller '08, Davies '0 8, Coplon '10. Second ten()r-Cantwell '07, Watson '08, Cor- l)in '0 9, Hutch. ens '1 0. First bass-Richardson '07, Fairbairn '07, Bell ',0 8, MeM'ullen '08.

The leader has mad~ out a tem- porary list of eighteen men, frun w·hom the club will be picked. A number of other like1y men have not entered the field yet and there will be enough spirit€d rivalry to insure the ciub's success.

THE CoNCORDIENSis VOL. XXX. RECENT HISTORY The Golden Eagle ·.:··· Joe and I were cleaning house this faU when .. ·we came across a very familiar old friend of . , ours. \Say Bill, do you recognize your old pal'?\ \Well do I! I think I know the genus. · ·Wasn't he the old boy we found staring at u!3 '.; · i over the doorway of a down town drug store? •·. j Just look here and see where we plucked hhn . i ·on the wing. Pretty sad now, isn't he? He's ·bald enough to use Herpicide.\ This last was spent on deaf ears for Joe, who js a confoundedly methodical chap, was deep .in his scrap book anxiously searching for some- .thing or other. I knew him well enough to ' 'preserve a discreet silence for I was sure that ·he would dig up something worth while. After a minute or two he sought his d:ary as if for verification. Then he read an entry. \March 17-Made chapel and classes. St. Patrick's Day and F'riday at that. Went through the agony of Mary's annual dinner. Managed to pull through and meet Bill at the . ,Crown. Hooked a big gilt eagle from DeSands's No. 2 example and report such acts of vandalism inl- mediately after they occur. Tongue-Tied This rare incident didn't happen so much on my account as on Joe's. You see, his stomach is not lined with copper and hence is suscepti- bl·e to the domineering sway of such things a:::; welsh-rare bits, lobsters and soft shelled crabs. We had been over to Albany to see Sothern and M1arlowe in \Romeo and Juliet.\ The play was so mushy that we felt we had to resist some- thing so we went down to Keeler's and had a \broiled live'' apiece. Talk about resistance! Why we could have stopped the Empire. When we got back to town we sat down and tried to smoke it out. No use-the old red coat liked us too well. After an hour we went to bed. About four o'clock Joe whispered out: \Bill!'' \What's up?\ I asked softly, for I too was \Vide awake. \Let's get up and let other people know th8 joys of being awake all night.\ No sooner said than done. We started out well equipped for the fray, Joe carrying a ·drug store. Bill put a cobble through 'his clothes line that he always kept in case of ··; :wing before he descended upon us.\ \Ha ha, ha!\ shouted Joe. \But listen to this from the Dorp \Guardian\ of April 1.\ Mr. Howard De Sand the popular druggist · ·· on Freedom Street appeared in police court th=s morning and complained that some mischievous person had broken down a large golden eagle which hung over the door of his s'hop. All evld- ence seems to point toward a noisy crowd of :High School students who were abroad about :midnight. The police have several clues and po doubt the ringleaders will soon be brought ;before the justice for a deserved reprimand. AB propertyholders should follow Mr .. De Sand~s emergency. vVe went over toward South and couldn't see any lights burning in the sections. Jimmy was snoring peacefully so it was easy enough to tie the rope to the tongue of the bell. We tilted the wheel toward the shed and took posts of vantage on its roof. Jimmy still slept, nor was any light .to be seen. \Play 'Let the Grecian dream' first,\ I whis- pered. Joe started in with a maestoso movement, calmed down to a soft adagio lullaby and then burst forth with a spirited allegro. \0~ Jimmy, where's the fire?\ \R' .j!l:> 'II · ?\ .. ·Il1g ·0.~,~~ W1:. · YOU ••. .. • • .. .. • • '. • - ._. • ~ 1:' ·' .. .. ... ~ .

Athletic Board Meets A regular meeting of the Athletic Board: was held in Silliman Hall, Wednesday nig-ht, and a good deal of business was transacted. Among other things the matter of basketban was dis- cussed, particularly with reference to a coaeh and a place to play. Probably the most important motion earrie-1 was t_hat allowing inter-class footbaU games tn be played on the campus after October 15. This opens the way for practice which will enable Old Union to put a good football t.earn in the field a year from this fall in case the Athletic Board sanctions the game. I. I I i '' \

:' '-. TI-IE C:ONCORDIENSJS I I We are pleased to announce that in the near fntt1re we shall publish an articille by Prof. 1\[arth, r-evie\ving a collection of poen1s recent[y sent to him by Mr. A. H. Rutledge, Union I904. Mr. Rutledge was editor of the Concorcliensis in his senior year at coJ ~~ege, vious that there was not at any tin1e during the season, the interest n1anifestecl in then1 by the students as a whole that there should have been. Now the ,tnusical -ciubs of any college, rightly n1anaged, nor only advertise the colle:ge 1nost efficiently in the towns where they give concerts, but they give the people of those tovvns a chance to judge of the kind of tnen attending the college. CO~IPE;TJTION FOH. FRESHl\IEN All freslunen who want to be elected to tile Reportorial Staff 1nust reg-ister with the Editor on or before Monday, October 22. i\fter t:l1at date regular assign1nents wiH be given out and each n1an registered is assured of being given a fair trial. The results of the contest will not be posted until the paper changes the n1en1bership of its staff next spring tern1. At that tiif:ne a thorough exan1ination of each man's vvork and ability will be n1ade and a proper nu1n ber chosen. The final choice will be 1nade upon the counts of matter accepted and published, accuracy of detail, hand- writing and general newspaper ahiJ,i ty. Decided evidence of that that n1uch-to-be- desired quaiity-good old con1mon sense- will also influence the editors in their se- lection. Although 111 en in the technical courses are far fron1 being debarred, yet it is highly desirable that a number of men in the liberal courses signify their intentions. The reason for this is that few engineers could find tin1e for the son1ewhat exacting labors thrust upon them. The work is not easy nor is the i1nmediate reward here !fn ihe case of last year at Union, it is neediess to say that a great n1any n1en vvho could play and sing as well as those in the ch1bs, continually failed to turn out and do their s:b.are. As has been said, the season was a suc- cess. Bttt notwithstanding this, it is very easy to see that it could have been n1ade a great deal n1ore of a success with the co-op e1·ation of all the students. A. college 111 usical concert is generally recog11ized as n1ore or less of a social event in the town where it is given. It affords the alun1ni living there an opportunity of hearing once n1ore sotne of the old songs of thei:r college days and it allows their sons to see and to 1neet the men of the coliege. ~n college very noticeable, yet we who have survived thus far, believe that it offers a good practical course in a few of the ele- ments of journalisn1. Few of the student body at Union realize the in1portance of the n1usical clnbs to the college. While last season the clubs were thoroughly successful fron1 an artistic standpoint, it was, nevertheless, 111ost ob\ For this reason the members of the clubs should make every possible effort not only to give a good concert but, what is scarcely less in1portant, to make the best possible appearance. It is true that the n1ajority of towns where the clubs played last year are s1na1I and it is also true that Union is perhaps the only col- lege -vv h ich sends clubs to then1, but if the right i11terest were taken, why can we not include son1e larger cities in the circuit? There is no reason why Union cannot produce a club tnacle up of genuine ability. If then, we can forn1 a club of real worth, why should we not exhibit it around the larger towns of the in1mediate vicinity? 'rhe Union n1usical clubs have scored 1nany successes during the years gone by,

Track Notes Last Saturday was the date for the first of the fall track meets. This meet was unique in its way for only those \Yho had never conr- peted on a college oval were allowed to enter. rrhe day was not auspicious for a meet as it was rainy and windy. However some very good. material appeared. The first fraternity re:la:,.7 race to be run off this fall was won by Phi Delta Theta. The results of the events \Vere as fo:1- lows: 50 yard dash-Won by Dwyer. ~in1e, 5 4-ti secnnds; Maugham, second; Davern, third. 100 ~':a.rd low hurdles-Won by Maughant. Time, 13 2-5 seconds.

Four men are to nn1. for each team, covering a total distance of two ~aps. All of the schedule games were not :played off liast \veek, hut those that \ve.re proved very interesting. On last Friday Phi Gamma Delta defeated Delta Phi by the s·core of 7 to G. On Saturday morning the same fraternity defeated Chi Psi by a score of 3 to 1. The featu.re of the game was the fine work dorie by both bat- teries. In the afternoon the Seniors and the Freshmen played the first inter-class game. Darkness set in and when the game was called in the fourth inning the score was 3 to 3. The Freshmen team showed up VE'ry well C011Sider- ing their lack of practice. Buck p-itched a good game.

Opdyke aHd Mana~r HiH Intery;i ewed. A.s annoUJJ.ced last week it was decided by t'lile Athltetic Board to allow inter-dass foot- ban .games after October 15. As the report ca..1ne in just before going to press it was im- P,{)Ssilbile to secure authoritative statements from th(Jse intimately acql!l.ainted with the action of Ute Board. As appears in both interview::;, it is not the intention to play games with an:y eutside teams. 'irhe motion is merely tJil'e ·result ·Of a reasonable desire on the part of aU con.c€rned, to :see the new :rules worked out in actual practice here on our Campus. W1l. en interviewed by a Concordy re- pc3'rter, Prof. Howard Opdyke, chairman of the Athletic Adviso.ry Committee, spoke as followa: \~T'he AthEetic Board of the college has voted to al~ow i,nter-class football games during tha rema..inder of the term. Wlhether the game shal 1 l be resumed next year, as an inter- coH~giate sport, has not been determined yet; but the me~mbers of the Board believe that the value of the changes in the game adopted by the F'ootl>all Rules Committee since Union's action of last winter can be studied by us best at first hand. Therefore, the At'hletic Board has sanc- tioned a tria.:I of the new rules, through inter- class games, by those who desire it. No one need feel under the slightest obli- gation to come out and play, unless he likes the game; for the scores wi11 not affect Union's inter-collegiat.e record one way or the other. N()r should there be, on the part of any- one, the least wish to play unless he is physic- ally :fit. Und€r these natural safeguards of the .situa- tion the new rules will Jbe trled. There is no reason why the Rugby game should not be tried a:iJ.so. Whether the game of football shall be resumed, or r:to-t, will depend upon maturer judgment later.\ Mlanager Hill was also seen and expressed himseU as follows: \After rn uch discussion the Athletic Board and the student body of t1le coHege have voted to permit inter-class football games to take place on the Campus after October 15. This, however, must not be taken to mean that either of the two organizations regre1s the action of last January in abolishing foot- ball. Class games have been sanctioned for one main reason, namely, to permit the stu- dents at Union to try the n.ew rules in order to learn. pe,rsonally whether or not the garne has been radically improved. First hand know- ledge is by far the best, ar:td in no other way can we obtain it. If the .game has been in1- proved, as is claimed by those who have re- vised tl~e rules, Union will doubtless have a 'Varsity team next fall. In that case, th~ practice held this year, though of short dura- tion, will be of great benefit to next year's team. It would be folly fm;· Union, with nn training, and no practical knowledge of the new rules gained prior to the middle of Sep- tember next, to play other colleges. It will probably be two weeks at least before regular jnter-class games are started. Thus the players will have some tillfe in which to get acquainted w'ith the new rules, and the earli·est games will be a fair test of them. Three or four weeks after starting the games, we shall be able to see just what improv0- ments have been made in the style of play, and then can decide about ne:xt year. An early decision is necessary, for if we are going to

Under no cGndition shall any of the class put a strong well-balanced team into the field next sp:rhag, it is of the utmost importanee tha.t we develop, several good mile and two mile runners. The present outlook shows U15 elevens play outside teams this year, even in particularly weak in these events. Captain other towns.

Distance running unde.r supervision, begun in a gradually increased, is healthful and invigorating overdone it may safely moderate way and undoubtedly a most exercise. When not be indulged in by any fellow of average physical development. Defective heart action is the chi-ef factor which makes the sport undesirable for a few. The results of steady participation in dis- tance running, as shown by increased endur- ance, enlarged lung capacity, added weight and improved health and vitality, are such as should n1ake the gam.e attractive to the ordi- nary fellow, while its value in developing the ability to cover long distances at a rapid rata makes cross country running most useful to aspirants for honors in the mile and two mne runs upon the track. Add to this the fact that there is no limit to the number who may take part, that only severely unfavorable weather conditions inter- fere with regular training and that there ~~ practically no expense involved, it is readily seen that cross country running is peculiarly adaptable to any scheme of athletics which aims to interest actively the entire student body. It is to be hoped that a large number will engage in the sport this fall primarily fur individual development and secondarly that we may discover and develop some valuable ma- terial for the track team. If Union is to weather absolutely prohibits. The preliminary runs wHl be short, interspersed with walking and easily within the power of any fell0w. As the severity of the work increases the runners wHl be divided into squads so that any who are not equal to covering the full distance may return by a shorter route. Hare and hound races or paper chases will give added interest as soon as the condition of the feHows will perm:it. As a preHminary to the regular runs one or two laps around the track daily will serv8 to 'harden the muscles and prevent stiffness due to exercise too suddenly indulged in. Plenty G:f woolen clothing should be worn, w:; the Pt>rspiration induced thereby is a va.lu- n ble part of the training, it also ·offers suf- ficient protection against rapid chilling of the skin when walking or resting for a moment. Notices will be posted upon the bulletin announcing the date of the runs and also nf a meeting to perfect the organization of a cross country club. The first run will be held Monday, October 22, starting from the gymnasium at 4:30 p. rn. sharp. DR. S. A. McCOMBER. FRESHMEN!

Publication Office, SCHENECTADY GAZETTE. COLLEGE 1\fEE.TINGtS Once again we are to 1neet in the Chapel fo·r the transaction of such busi11 ess as 1nay con1e before the student body.. Whether or not the restrictions in1 posed .are to our liking is a question we shall not discuss here. ()p,in:ions diffe~· widely as to the: 1natter of srnoking in the Chapel. If it b·e a dese- cration, then by all 1neans it should be frowned upon. However, as regards the inj:ury to property, the hann is nllot-e easily seen. But \Ve do not purpose to d.·iscuss the outcon1.e of the arrangen1ent in detail. T t see n1s to ns that but one is sue ought to be our concern. The thing tb.a.t interests every true son of Old Union above all others is the absolute necessity of creating and n1aintaining the best possible college spirit. Now the effect of the college .n1eeting upon the student body is un1nistakable. If any, one doubts its power to stir up enthusiasm, let hin1 for a 1non1ent look back over the past three weeks. What percentage of all the students in college has appeared in Silli1nan Hall each 1VIonday tnorning? \i\lhat n1eeting held thus far has been typi- cal of those held regularly in years gone by? How 11111ch cause have we given the Fresh1nen to believe that for us, Union is the only college in the country? 1.7\.f e must needs confess our inability to give a credit- able answer to these questions. So far as this 111atter is concerned, it has been thought unnecessary to pubHsh any finely worded resolutions. A sin1ple word of honor suffices for our needs. T:hat word has been accepted in the spirit with which it was given. Ti1ne alone will show those undese-rving of confidence. RESIGNATION ()n account of other college dttties that 11111st of necessity be attended to, Mcintosh, 'o7, has thoug-ht it best to resign his position as N e\vs Editor.

TI1E CONCO·RDIENSIS I f gret that we accepted the withdrawal, for '\Mac''' has newspaper ability of a high order, and would, if circumstances allowed, be of very positive value to the present Board. But rather than hold an office to which he could lay no just clain1, he preferred to sever his connection whh and devote his attention to other n1atters. At all events, w·e have the assurance that his energies vviU be directed toward equally worthy ends. CORRE.CTJONS In last week's issue there appeared a statetnent to the effect that Phi Delta Theta had won the relay race for October 6. The fact is that Delta Upsilon won with Phi Delta Theta second. The mistake was due to en~or on the part of one of the officials in giving the account to onr reporter. In the Latin poen1 by Dr. Duane the last line should read \Solus in aede senex piger est, reliquique laborant.\ FOOTBALL In accordance with the action of the Athletic Board and the resolution passed Monday n1orning by the student body we are at liberty to begin inter-class football on the afternoon of October 16. We under- stand that this later date was chosen in order that the regular schedule of baseball gatnes tnight not be interfered with. We are glad that those interested will have a favorable opportunity of playing under the new rules. The action of the Board is n1ost comn1 endable for at least two reasons. It is an obvious fact that we cannot wait until next fall before organizing the 'Var- sity, if we are going to put out a team that is worthy of the college. Football is now, and for years has been, the biggest and the greatest gatne of the An1 eric an co liege. Its daily practice is an all-in1portant factor in the developn1ent of reai college spirit. It taffords an occasion llior a general assetnblage .of students at the beginning- of the new year. Such ass.en1hlages, held ~re:q uently, are the f)niy n1eans by which keen enthusiasn1 and 1iove ~or the college tnay be aroused. For (.this reason, if for no otheT, vve rejoice in the action of the Athletic Board and the student body.

CHAPEL MEETING Privi:Iege Again Extended-1To be Held ·in Chapel Monday Morning As a result of the Sophomore-Freshman rush, held after college meeting on September 24, the privilege of holding the usual M;onday morning business session in the Chapel was denied the stu. dent body. The greatest reason for the wHh~ dra war of the va.Iued privilege was that injury had been done college property as a direct result of the scrap. The most noticeable damage was the breaking of s~veral seats near the· main door. It was here that the hottest fight was waged. The rush was precipitated by the mutual feel- ing of antagonism existing in the two classes, and so quickly was it started that neither the ROBSON & ADEE BOOK MEN Schenectady and Saratoga. = b q p C< al H at m~ be fOJ an pr1 ] of to leg Mb ser

Tl1e annual reports of the different departments of the University were presented. Among other transactions, the Board decided to set apart the 12th of February as Universi>ty J)ay. It is in- tended on this day to bring t()gether all the faculties and st-udents of the University. 'rhe complete arrange1nents for the day have not yet been 1nade, but will be announced later. / Alumni '46.-Some interesting arti.cles have appeared: in the New York papers lately a bout D·r. Sheldon S . .Jackson, the head of the United States Bureau of Education of Alaska., and. aiso the Founder and Superintendent of the Presbyterian. Mission in Alaska. Dr. Jackson was the :Hrst Enan to intro- duce reindeer farming as a means of livelihood for the natives. Conditjons in Alaska had changed since the arrival of the foreigners, and it seemed as though the Eskimos would soon become Government charges like the Indians. But Dr. .Jackson found a solution to this impending danger by importing reindeers from Siberia to- gether with Laplanders to teach t·he Eskimos how to handle them, to the end tha..t at present there are about 14,000 reindeer in Alaska, which furnish the inhabitants with food, clothing and a means of transportation. * * * * ~~,: '76.-Frank Hurd Robinson died OR Tuesday, TIFFANY & Co.

' '~ ;~!I' • ,• j ' 'I On Monday the 15th of October, Clarl< Brooks died at his horne in Charlton, Saratoga County. Mr. Brooks graduated from ·union in 1865 w\ith the degree of A.B., and in 1887 was elected a permanent trustee of the college. A few years later he became the Secretary of the Boacd of Trustees and fulfilled the duties of that office until he was obliged to res[gn on aceount of HI-health in 1904. Mr. Brooks was a lawyer and ' practiced in N·ew York City. He beca:rne identi- fied with religious and charitable work in New York and was regarded with warm affection by atl his associates in this work. His loyalty to the college wa:3 unquestioned and his serviC!E's as .Pecr('tary of the Board and me1nber of the Finanee Committee were of great value. His greatest service was rendered when the college was still owning property in Long Island City and th(~ business connected with this property was left almost wholly in the hands of a New York com- mittee. Proper attention to this business required much thne and Mr. Brooks was always among the 1nost faithful meinbers of this committee. M'r. Brooks was born in Clifton Park, Saratoga County, in 1843. He was a man of exceptionally fine rharacter and made strong and enduring friend- ships. -----------------------------------------------------·-- 3he College .Shoe .S'tore MOST OF THE FELLOWS TRADE HERE WHY?

THE CoNcoRDIENSis VOL. XXX. UNION COLLEGE, OCT. 27, :Igo6 No. 4 Igo6 Football Inasmuch as we at~e going to play inter-class foHtbaH this fall, it rnight not be amtss to give the changes in the rules for thi.s season. One of our contem_poraries has explained the gam-e so exce:llently that we borrow freely. \The officials of the game shall be a referee, two umpires and a Unesrnan. It is however allowable to- dispense with the ' ' second umpire at the discretion o.f the two in-- stitutions involv-ed. The length of the garne has been shortened by ten rninutes, making the two halves each thirty minutes in length. The line of scrimmage for each side is an imaginary line parallel to the goal line and passing through that point of the taU nearest the side's own goal Hne. It will be noted that there are thus two lines of scrim- mage, one for each tea1n, and the two teams are thus separated the length of the balL The snapper-back must place the ball flat upon the ground with its long axis at right angles to the 'line of scrhnmage. It has also been provided that a player to be on the line of scrim.mage n1ust have both hand::; or both feot up to or within one foot of it. He must also stand with both feet outside the out- side foot of the player next to him Hnless he be cne of the two n1en standing on either side of the snapper- back, in which case he 1nay lock legs with the snapper- back. A player attempting to n1ake a fair catch 1nust Etignal his ii1te·ntion by raising his h2 nd clearly above his head while advancing toward the ball. Further addition has been rnade to the rule regarding 'down.' That is-, that the referee shall blow his whistle wheneve-r any portion of the person of the runner \\Vi th the ball, except his hands or feet, touches the ground while he is in the grasp of an opponent. The hall is also 'down' wher1, .as specified in the rules, it goes across the ;goal line on a kick which has struck the ground in the field of play, except the kick off, and als0 when it goes over in the sam-e man- ller from a forward pass. Tripping :ts specifically defined as follows: A player trips another player vvhen he ob- structs him below the knee with that part of his leg that is below the ' 1 (nee. Hurdling is definE'd and forbidden. Hurdling in the open is jumping over or attempting to jump over an opponent who is still on his feet. Hurdling i-n the line is jumping over or atternpt- ing to jump over a player on the line of scriln- mage with the feet or knees foremost within a distance of 'iii ve yards on either side of the point where the ball is put in play. Regarding the taking out of time, it is pro- vided that either captain may ask for time three times during the half without penalty. If th-ere- ufter either ~captain requests time, his side shall be pennl:zed by loss of two yards for each call, unless the player be removed from the game. Further :provision is made against interference with the man_ snapping the ball back. The op- ponents 1nust neither interfere in any way whatever with him, nor touch hiln nor the ball until it is actually put in play. The snapper- back is allowed to have his head, also the hand or foot used in snapping the ball, off-side. There rnust always be at least six n1en of the side in possession of the ball on the line of scrim1nage ar1d if only six are on the line, one ' . of these not on the line must have both feet outside the outside foot of the player on the end of the Une. Furthermore, no player of those ordinarily oc- eupying the position of center, guard or tackle, that is, the five Inidclle players of the line, may -drop back fr(!)m the line of scrhnmage on the

Holding has been m,ore spe.cific.tlly defined to include the folLowing: Grasping- an. opponent w'ith the hands or arms, placing t:he hands upon an opponent tc push hirn away from the play, circling in any degree any part of trfl. e o:p•ponent with the arm, any use of the arms to Jift an opponent in blocking. The only ano-w\'able use of the arm in blocking or obstructing an opponent is with the arms close to the body. One forward pass shall be allowed to each not touch the groun.d. The rule regarding foul play has been arnpili- fied and specially covers striking with the fist or elbow, kneeing, . kickiTlg, Ineeting with the knee by any player, or striking with the locked hands by linemen when they are breaking through. Furthermore, a player on defense is fo,rbidden to strike in the face with the heel of the hand an opponent who :is carrying the ball. These offenses are puni,shable ,not only by dis- qualification of the player, but also the loss by the offending team of half the distance to its own goal line.

THE !CO:NCORDIENSIS 7 have done more than .all the others to make the p~ay more open. The rutes covering body checking, holding, tripping and all other kinds of \dirty\ play have >tong been needed, and it ls hoped that they will eliminate that deplorable feature of injur- ing good. players in order to put then1 out of the gan1e. The fact that every player is ''on-side\ as soon as a punted ball strikes the ground makes the game rnor:e uncertain and consequently more in- teresting to the spectator. This year it is almost impossible to judge any- thing by comparative scores. It would seem that football has taken a new lease (j)f life from the 1906 rules and in an :proba- biHty we can expect greater developrnents tn the next two years.

Fron1 now on the work is to be carried out with regularity and despatch. Manager Noble and Captain Shntler can he depended upon to exert every effort that will possibly tencl toward a season of success. The fact that we have not all the conveniences that could be de- sired is a very evident one, yet this in its-,elf ought in no way to dan1pen our ardor or deter us fron~ giving the tea1n every possible reason for believing that we back it up heart and soul. On the contrary, the existence of such obstacles should serve to irn press upon each one of us the absolute necessity of doubling our usual efforts to the, end that the tean1 be assured of our spirit and enthusiasn1., Only a n1an who is \rvorking hard for his Aln1a lVIater by depriving hin1self of 111any of the con1n1on relaxations and pleasures of everyday col- lege life, thoroughly and n1ost sincerely ap- preciates a good old cheer that rings out our praises loud and high. Dut how do you personally stand in this 1natter? Are you going to be one of the uninterested onlooket-s or are you going tn be right on hand with plenty of lung power and the fin11 cletern1ination that our tean1 n1ust win?

The reason :for the Let every rnan here in college ren1en1- first condition is, pr.esumably; that the chapel, in ber that this is a golden opportunity for spite of its use as an assembly roo1n, a lecture winning over new students. Personal con- hall, etc., is nevertheless a .chapel and entitled tact, 111an to 111an, is the one of the greatest to the respect due any building erected for re- factors in developing our college toward Ugious worship. The second condition is based on an increasingly br:iHiant life. this, and also on the fact that more or less 'v\1 e of the Board, as extren1ely happy d8.mage is usually done the doors and such seats to welcon1e all the preparatory school boys as have the ·misfortur1e to be placed near the here today. We hope that this will be doors.

Person.ally I think that the end in this case rather justifies the means, for really the \setting- up\ parties do seem to be the outbursts of prep.- school enthusiasm. If, then, the student body considers the demand fair perhaps we s.hould not ' complain of the occasion used in forcing our ac- ceptance of it. Many of us regret, however, the rapid disap- pearance of old college cust01ns and traditions. It seems a very sad bit of irony for us to· sing the Terrace Song in chapel; and in it singing \Ye Union boys, whose pipes are lit,'' be con1- pelled to see the smoke rings only in in1agina- tion.
