Publication Office, ScHENECTADY GAZETTE. THE SIX~ YEARS COURSE It is with no s1nall gratification that we are enabled to publish the full details of the curriculun1 for the new six-years course leading to the degrees of B'. E. and Ph. B. It was entirely through the kindness and interest of De Landreth that the article appears in this week's issue. We believe that as yet no authentic statement with regarcl to the new course has been printed in the newspapers. We are considerab 1y flattered to think that the privilege of pub- lishing the first authorita~ive account was extended to our columns. It is not for us to attempt to discuss the argurnents for and against the adoption of such a plea. The Faculty and the Educa·- tion Committee have already done that, and they have decided in favor of the new course. We rest content with their deci- sion firn1ly believing that their action wiH redound to the everlasting fame and glory of our beloved Ahna M~ter. APPOINTliENTS It is with pleasure that we speak of two new n1en1bers of our Board-Harry Cook, 'o6 for the Law School and M. H. W ev- ., rauch, 'o8 for the News Department. It 1s hardly necessary for ns to say more. Those acquainted with them will readily under- stand the reasons for their appointment. The large scholastic attaintnents of the one -the Vlaledictory and the special honors- betoken a con1 prehensive and regular re- port, while the steadfast loyalty of the other coupled with real newspaper ability speaks firn11y in his favor. In acordance with Article VII of the Constitution of the Concordiensis which reads: \The Faculty shall annually elect one of their nun1ber to serve as member of the Roarcl exofficio in the capacity of Facnl ty advisor of the Board,\ we last week petitioned the Faculty for appoint- rnent of sucl1 an advisor.

1 I tion was taken and Dr. March appointed '':'o the Trustees of Union College: as r~equested i:n the letter to the Secretarv Iferewlth, in accordance with rny usual custom, of the Faculty. 1 submit report for the year en.ding July 31st, 1906. Duri,ng the year your college has lived OUR FINANCES No, we do not mean the finances of the Board, :for that is a subject tabooed frotn polite society. Besides it would be poor form to speak of such 1na tters now that we have noticed the passing of the famous First of Nove1nber-· that last day for the payn1ent of the $I .so rate for a year's sub- scription. But we do n1ean the finances of Union College-our college. Such a tnarked itn- provetnent in the excess of receipts over expenditures is deserving of particular mention. Certainly not for some years has such a fortunate condition of a.ffain; existed. We are proud and happy thus to be ab'le to congratulate Mr. Bailey and Mr. Pond upon the singularly sound finan- cial basis on which the college now rests. It was our desire to print the report in full but lack of space allowed nothing more than a summary of the in1portant points. These few figures speak for themselves in a manner n1uch more striking than could all the words we 111ight be able to set down. In connection with this report we also notice that an exceilent custom has been instituted, the custom of printing the full report in a handy and attractive book- Jet. We believe that this is to be a yearly occurrence. We sincerely hope that such is. the case for the sake of all those inter- ested in the college and her finances. TREASURER'S RE.PORT Conditions Most Favorable-Over $8;000 Oleared So much interest has been manifested of late over the Round financial basis of the college that we are printing a. report as of July 31, 1906, by the Treasurer o·f the Trustees of Union Co:Ilege. \\·ithin its income. A careful .study of the report demonstrates the I1lecessity of cornpleting the fund necessary to se- cure the g.ift of Andrew Carnegie, if your college is to increase :its usefuh'less.

The University Convocation of the State of New York The Forty-fourth University Convocation of the State of New York, held at Albany the 25th, 26th and 27th of last month, was a great success.

Three sessions 1vere held daily: At 9.30 A. M., 3 P. M., and 8 P. M. As in 1905, a genera..} topic was chosen for the whole Convocation.

The seventh ann. uai m.eeting of the New York The cmnn 1 ittee of arrangen::~,en ts is rna de up State Conferer}ee cf Rel.ig.:on will be held in this as follows: c!ty next Monday and Tuesd8y in the F' rst Re- formed Church, Cn on and Church S~rce~ s. The cor~ference is held upon t1J.e joint :i:nvita tion of the .l\1 bi.steri:::d Ass:)ciation of Schenectady and Union. l.~niversity. As rnen of prominence ia r:::l\giou~ ccllegiate and civil affaiJs are to take part in the' e e2-:ercises, U?.e conference sh)uld be of especial interest to the students and thoEe identi- rled with the college. This conference, ia \\'hose Inembership Jews unite ,\·i+h Christ:ans of m::tny deno1ninations, was forn1E'd in 18G9, and ~is the rnost inclusive rdig-ious organization in the State. Agree~i~ng that individual beliefs should be l0yally held and frankly n1air1tained, but also that Re- ligion Hnites rnany whon Theology divides, it affirms the unity of the religious spirit in the dif- fering religious organizations, the supremacy of Character and Service as the witnesses of that spirit, anq the obl'gation resting on all ·men of religious spirit to co-operate for social salvation. Its motto is HReligions are many, Religion is one.\ These af:firma tions are m.ade for a practical pur- pose and a vital need-the promotion of the sochl righteousness now menaced and dishonored in American society. The .great need of the hour is a strenuous spddtual morality. a quickening of the social conscience, a purification of principle and conduct in industrial, financial and political Hfe, a renaissance of devotion to the moral ideals of the :religion that is pure and undefiled.

His addresses are An Impressfon of Oxford Dav,id R. Porter Bowdoh1, ex-'06, the first Maint: ' student to win a Rhodes scholarship at Oxfor·d, delivered an address at Bowdoin, October 21st, on \Oxford telling of the conditions there. He said in part (quoting from the Bovvdoin \Orient Oc- tober 26th): \The E'nglish University differs from the Alneri- can in that it is eo1nposed of a collection of dif- ferent colleges. At Oxford there are 22 different colleges, all located in the city of Oxford, and fonning the University. Each college stands for a distinct thing, and each is a unit in itself. Each is surrounded by a high wall, which prevents the students fron1 going out. \It is difficult for an American to understand the relation of one college to the other colleges of the University. It can be compared to the United States government, composed of a num- ber of states, all having one central government. \There is no co-education at Oxford, but in the City of Ox:ford there· are se'Veral· colleges for young women. T'he women may attend the lectures and take· the examinations of the Uni- always popular and highly i nstrucUve. The da t- s versity, but cannot receive the degree. The and subjects are as follows; coHeges for the· wo1nen have their ow'n boards ! e a e i1 c b tl st

s e THE C:O·NCORDIENSIS 7 of trustees, and are entirely separate !Eron the Universii.ty. ''''The Oxf0rd student is required to take or:Hy three examinations. The first is called: the Re- sponsers, and was takeR by :the A~merican students before we lieft our native shores. 'l,he E 1 ng:I:i sh studeHts, !ho\\vever do· not take this until Uil:ey have entered the University, and they som~eti11'1 es remain there a year or more before passing it. ~rhere is ·another •examinaUon wh·i:ch all are •l'-('- quir.ed to take, but whieh really Is a f.lr.ce. It is called o:Ivh'lity lV(o'deration, and is given to test the candidate's knowledge of the Ne\v 'I'esta- men.t, and the subject matter of the Book of ActR. For a s.mall sum. a student may ])Urchase a bonk containing the questions, and if he masters these, he is pretty sure of passing the ~·exam.\ Hmv- ever, occasionally a surprise is. sprung, and t'hjs was the case- when the first Rhodes scholars arrived. If the student does not pa8s, he is finr c1 one pound. 'iF'his money is used to fill the coffer~, and \vhen the times are hard, as :-tt pre::;ent, th.e majority of the Freshmen are re-quired to pay the fine. \The second examination is held usually in the middle of the course, after the student has bee11 there a year and a half, or two years. third and :final '\V'ritten examination is held at the end of the course, and the student is expected to remember all he has learned. There is, how- ever, .after this an oral examination, ·whiC'h ls also a farce. \Afte·r the student has passed his seconn examination he may choose whether or not he ' will work hard. If he chooses to work hard he will take what is called the Honor School, anrl if not, the Passed SchooL This ]a tter is uRefl chiefly by wealthy E:ngHshmen, 'vho want the ·course he will take u:p, and then goes to that college, and remains there for two· years, or untH he has taken his last examination. \The tutorial system is in force at Oxford. A of his mora~ and physical welfare during his cai\eer. 1Dach tutor has between six and fifteen stadents under his charge. It is necessary to caill upon y.our tutor at least once a week. He wHl inquire what books you have read, what lectures you have attended, and .a bout your social life during the past week. He wiU then advise you as to your \York for the next week. ''All of the teaching is done within the c01lege, and the examinations are prepared, and the de- gree given by the University. It is the wo·rk of the tutor to prepare y.ou for the examinations. Oxford is a barren land as far as recitatio-ns go, for there are none. \To the Englishman the social side of life is n1uch n1ore in1portant th:=tn the studious life. There nre three terms of eight weeks each, and the ~tudt'nt must attend at least six of the e:ight weeks. The work is all done during the vaca- tions, and the students come up to Oxford to get acquaintt'd, and to attend lectures. The Englishman believes there are two ways .of ob- taining an education; reading books and reading lectures; they consider the latter the more :im- portant.\ Mr. Porter then described a typical Oxford day. The student is called at 7.30 and is given 20 ITlinutes to take a cold water hath, dress and get to chapeL Chapel is compulsm~y, and if he does not attend, he must write his name in a book in the dining-room ten minutes before eight. Breakfast is from 8.30 until about 10 o'clock. Lectures co.me from. 10 until 1, and then lunch is served. The students all go out to the athletic Oxford lift>, but do not care to study hard. [ field after lunch. At 4.30 con1es tea, and dinner believe that even these get as rnuch out of theiJl~ college course; as do the Americans who study- hard a few nights before the exan1inations, and then forget it all in a few days. \Th.ere is no elective system jn England. The student chooses at the begiiming -what general iH served at 7 o'clock. The first three meals· are supposed to be eaten alone, but one is either invited out or has company. Dinner is really the o11ly sn tisfactory meal of the day. The stu- dents hurry through this, and go off to one another's rooms for coffee.

8 TJ-IE CONCORDIENSlS \Freshmen are treated much different in Eng- land than in America. The Rhodes scholars had all been Freshmen in America, and were not anxious to live those days over .a.gain, but when we arrived we found things en t~rely different than in Am:erica. There a Freshman is looked up to and honored by the upper e1asHmen. Dur- ing the first f·ew months the upper ·Classmen are all· of the tim,e inviting the Freshmen to meals in their rooms, ·Or to the theatres. Sometimes when there is not room at the coHege f0r all the students, the Seniors give up their roon1s f-or the Freshmen. \The proctors have charge of the students out- side of the college. It is their duty to see that the student wears his cap and gown when he calls upon his tutor, .and also when he is on the street after 9 A. M.

Last week it became known to the Sophs, fron1 some unknown, mysterious source, that the Fresh- nlen were to hold their banquet Monday, Nov. 5. From the moment that such news was received, the entire Sophon1ore claRs began to rnake great preparations. But in spite of all their scouts, they were unable to ascertain where the event would take place. 'rhe fact that it \vas to be on Monday even~ng inconvenienced a great number of the 1909's. Some their heels. That was the only way by wh1ca tn:ey would be able to loca.te tne banquet hall. But what was the,f<r chagrin, when they found. that they were being ,]ed a. wild goose chase,. for there was to be no !banquet at all. The v..rhole affair was nothing :bnt a trap set itl the way of the uns·uspecting .S0]}hs, which they too eage,rly put their foot in.

'l\'he verdant freshies tried out the time-hon0red. trick last Monday n:tg:ht. They talked about it so n1uch that they r·eally thought the banq_uet was going to come off. Everybody was convinced. that lVIonday was the night except the SenioT s, the Juniors and the wily class of 1909. The F'reshmen cleared out in the afternoon, lost a good dinner and no doubt spent a pleasant even- ing. The Sophomores hung around and saw no steel fronts bound wi,th a silken frame nor were any bulky suit-cases seen to leave the Campus. Truly the class of l9(i)9 excels even the Seniors in astuteness.

This \veek we print an advan·ce pro- gran1 of the addresses and general order o£ business for the New York State Con- ference of Rerigion. \Ve wonld call atten- tion to this ,Conference for at leas~ three reasons. First, the ·Conference is given partiaJly under the auspices of the Uriiver- sit v and hence clen1ands a share of our ,.1 inter,est for -vve go to tnake up the sttrength o£ the institution. Second, the speakers are rnen \vho have done well in their p~ro fe::;- s1ons and who stand high in populaF esteen1. Rarell'J do we have an opportunity for ·see- ing and hearing n1en of such breadth of n1incl and strong intellectual power. Third. the l·eligious side of our nature is sotne- tb.ing that V\'e cannot afford to neglect. 'The Conference will· advance ideas known to be sane and practicable and so we who hope to becon1e well ech1cated 1nen tnnst of necessity evince a cordial interest in -son1e of the great religions probletns that are before the vvorld. vVe exhibit a narrow natnt-e if \Ve concern ourselves with noth- ing beyond the affairs of our own sn1all sphere. A GOOD LETTER. C)n vVednesday -vve receiverl a letter that is worthy of editorial notice. As the writer says we have already taken occasion for sa~ying- a \vord or two about speaking to tnen on the Can1pus. Thinking it unwise con- stantly to dwell upon snch a n1atter, we de- sisted frotn further cotnn1ent, hoping that others would take up the question. Others have. but they have not expressed then1- selves in a n1anner suitable for publication. 'the coh1n1n headed \Cotnn1unications\ seeks an expression of college opinion firn1er and 1nore specific perhaps than we can give here. However, in this letter, there is not a thing said that we have failed to experience. Rut this is a n1atter tlYat can- not properly be attended to -by n1any words

Both of the literary ~ocietie~ of the col- lege-the Philon1athean and Aclelphic-have at last organized for tl1e con1111g year. Prepa~rations are being 111ade for the pre- litninary debates -vv h ic h cnlln in ate in the !\llison-Foote debate next Febrt1ary. The students at \Union seen1 unable to realize how in1portant it is to for then1 to join one of these soci,eties. :\ot alone because the training is invaluable, as graduates oJ the college will tell you, bnt hecanse it is a question of college honor. Each year we debate \vith a tean1 repre~::enting Rutg-er~. and each. vear we have heen clefeatecl- r every year but last-because \Ve were clearly outclassed. And why have we been outclassed? Sure;Iy not because of nun1bers, for we have n1ore students than Rutg-er~. The reason \iVe do not n1ake a better show- ing· is because students do not lend their active sttpport and co-operation. \,\/ere it a football or baseball gatne, thirty or forty 1nen \\voukl give instant support. But for a debate, possibly six con1e out. prohahly not tnore than five. At Rutgers tvventy or thirty try for every debat~ing tearn, and everv cancl,idate takes up the 1natter with enthn~~ia~n1. Dovvn there they realize the itnportance to then1selves and to the col- lege of \Vinning debates. ..Ancl what is the re~u lt of that feeling? Rutgers no;yv holds a n1ost cnviahle position in the college_ de- hating \vorld. ~ever has a losing- tean1 con1e fron1 that in.~titution.

Editor: Through a Rtaten1ent n1.acle by one of the Faculty, I understand that the n1anagement of our college has appointed a con1n1ittee consisting of f;everal n1en1bers of the Faculty for the pur- pose of securing a large entering class of Fresh- men next year. For accomplishi.ng this, it is their cleRire to connnunicate personally with all seniors i:t:I- near- by High Schools .. To secure the best results, the co-operation of nli lhlion's students is very essential. I am sure, J.\Tr. Editor, that you will a.gree with me that the matter i:::; ·worthy of our hearty support, and it w- emR to n1e that every student here should have 0nough college spirit to aid this committee in cyery \Yay possible and especially by procuring n Ii:::;t of names of seniors now at hi::; O\\·n High School. Yours, h1 the welfare of our collegE', ''C:.'' Schenectady, N. Y., Nov. 7, 1906. To the Editor of the \Concordiensis\: Dear Sir: On n1y way to a class this morning, I hac1 occasion to pass through a crowd of fifteen Freshmen in the Arcade of the \Reel. Building.\

12 They \Vere evidently waiting f0·r the hell to ring before entering the class room. As i·t is my custobn1, I said ''Reno,\ and was greatly surprised when I only heard two restwnsc:s, ai'l.d they were very faint. Tbe rest of the Fresh- mei::t were too busy studying or were talking about something too important to even notice a ]Je1·son pa:ss]ng through their midst. \/\leek of Prayer for Young Men. For the past fourtE-en years the week foHowi·Rg tl:e second Sunday in :N'\ovem.ber has been ob- served in cGlleges and si.milar funstitutions through.- out the country as a week of special prayer a.n<i thanksgiving. As usual the ·week will be Oil!> ... scI Ted here at L'nion. Beginn-ing on Mbnday,, Upon leaving the class romn, I met a Junior to sh.:rt p-raye.r services will be held each day-, whorn I spoke and he looked me in the ey,e and never uttered a ·word and passed by. The fact . , that the uncler~-c.·lassmen were too busy to speari:, and the Junior too absent-minded, made me very indi'gr1ant, and l have been trying to discover a remedy for such a thing. What is college spirit 1 Does it mean. that you are to pass a :fellow- student by without even turning to speak or to see who i•t is? If such is good spirit, we d·o nnt want any at Union. If \college spirit\ does mea.n that you are to· speak and act as only good college men can, you rnust certainly .speak to every stu- dent you meet, whether on the Carnpus or o-n the street, be he Senior or Freshman. It is time- honored custom, as well as college etiquette, that requires a Freshrnan to speak :first to an. upper-classman, although the former is a stranger in our midst. If the Freshman only speaks to those who speal< first to him, it won't be long before his list of acquaintances will be very short and confined mostly to n1embers of his own class. If, on the contrary, he forms the habit now of speaking first to everyone he meets, the men will soon notice it and their meeting will be one of mutual recognition. There is nothh1g in college life that will make a man as popular and well liked as a good \Hello \Vith a smile on his face when you say it. As .for \Po1nters I would refer you to the editorial in the \Concordy\ of October 6, ai:\ld in the \Freshman Bible,\! page 28.

Tbe Conference of Religion oif N~ew York State opened M on aay m.orn.ing, .November the 12th, in the V'lrst Reformed Church. Pliesident ..A.ndrew V. V. Raymon<il of Union Col- leg~, the pr·esiding rn:i.ni!ste1' of the Conference, deliv-ered the addre~s of welreom•~ to the members o•i {be Conference and the laymen present. Dr. Jr...mes M'. White>n responded for the Cc·nference to Ur. RlaynJ.ond's hearty welcorne. D'r. Whiton is th.e staff editor of the \Outlook\ and tho Chair- ma.n of the e·onfer\:::nce El:xecutive Com,Inittee. Ra..JDbi Stephen S. Wlze of Nevv York City with Dr. Leighton. Wiiliams, pastoT of the Amity Bap- tist (;hurch of N'ew York, addresst:'d the Confer- enc~ on ''Religious Unity in P'racticG.'' AAter this excellent addre·ss it~ discussion was o:pe:ncd uy Mr. George F. Peabudy of New York City., Further discussion was co,.nduct.~d by R~hbi E:d- w.r . .rd lVL Chapma.n ,of Schene·ctady. T h~ second day O·f the· ConveEtion waS' opened with a.n. address by Congressman VVfi1lia.1n S. Ben- nett of New York. T'he subject of his address was \The Re7ival 0f C:n1sci.ence.\ Dr. B. W. R. rra\J~Jor of St. George's Church, opened the discus- sin\l that fono·wed. 'This di~cussic!:l, like all those that followed, was f:.1U of intoreat to the audience and to the ]Jarticipan.ts. Tne next subject 1v ns ''Religious [l.nd Social Pro- gresf>,'' dcliver€d by Rev. S::tm.uci J. Barrows, D. D. Dr. E. E. Ha.l ?, Jr., O·:pened the discussion. Dr. Hr41e '\-VaS foUowed by S~:11fttO!I\ Eldgar 'T. Brackett, who spoke on \Puh.Jic Service as a Moral Vocation,\ de:Jivcring a.n addre.;:;s that created con- siderable comment as it was rather a radical de- ' partu . .~t·e from the other sp.eeches of the Conven- tion. . 'Vfl~ ·~ , i I .f. I I 1 , Dr. James M. Whiton's paper on the· sub<ject \T'he E·thical Conception of Money', was full of interest, and the audience of the afternoon :session, opened by the reading ·of this p-aper, gave the speaker their closest attention. Mr. W. G. Nash, of the New· York National Bank, opened the dis- cussion of this question by stating that the mu.lti- mJllionaires of this count,ry are m-isdirected in their philanthropy. H.e said that instead of giving large sums of m·oney for the erc·ctio.n of Ubraries they should rather give their attention t9 matters mo·re deeply concerning the needs of a needy people, suggesting ten em en t house reform a.s a de- sirable end toward which to work. A much larger proporti·on of the population wJould thus be reached, and this, too, in a way that would pro- duce infinite good to the nation. ''Religion and WTealth\ was the subject de·-ve- Ioped in the speech of Dr. H·enry C. Emery of. Yale. Mr. Henry W. Darling of the General El€c- tric Con1..pany started the discuss.ioN. Dr. Ge0rge R. Lunn made a strong point . of the .fact that capital had too much control in church affairs. Th~ Rev. .James S. Kl ttell, presiding officer, opened the evening session with devotional e·xer- dses. The first addr-ess w:a.s. by Dr. Maurice· H. Harris of the T'emple Israel, N'ew York, who spo'ke on \WJbat Different Religions Ow:e to One Another.'' This was followed by a discussion, opened by Dr. Frank S. Hoff'man. President R11sh Rees of Rochester University spoke next on: \The Univer- sity and Religion,\ the discuss-ion of which was opened by Dean Ripton, of Union College·. After some closing remarks hy Dr. Lunn th.e Conventio·n w·as convened with a benediction pronounced by Dr. Harris. The keynote of the whole· Convention· was, the necessity of the churches to unite into one har- monious crusade. Entirely regardl€SS of cree-d·S,

Five minutes after the depa.rture of the bare, the hounds started in pursuit, and succeeded in trailing until .Jackson's Garden was reached. he·re they turned wrong and in consequence lost time in finding the trail again, thus giving the hare time enough to get well out of their way.

It is our belief th.a t we should recog- nize the rnost j,oyou:s season of the year by an effort to 1n.ake the holiday nun1bct of the '\Concordy'' a little diff·erent fron1 its usua[ character. 'To this end we are now directing our th .. ought and energy. Thus far we have been successful in ob-- taining material of unquestioned value. w.e have at hand orJe article in particu- lar, which cannot fail to stin1 ulate a keen interest in the 1ninds of all our reader.~. vv.e refer to a letter written to the Editor by Mr. Edward Payson \Vhite, '79, 0112 of the £ounders of ''The 'Concordiensis.:·• For some years M:r. vVhite has been Sec .. retary of the Board of Trustees, ancl has always shown a true regard for th c College. In connection with this letter there w1.11 appear a brief history of the paper dowa to the present clay. \!Ve shall also have an article that tnay appeal to the wor- shipers .of our patron saint-the idol. A few men1bers of the Faculty are giving active support to the schetne and will contribute to this special n nn1ber. We can also give assurance of articles from two or three recent graduates who edited t'h.e paper when in College. Fron1 the above staten1ents as our hopes and ain1s, the inference will Lc drawn that this issue is to partake sonH~­ what of a literary nature. \\le trust th~1t such will be the case, though it n1ay h(: well to state that the news ele1nen t \vill 111 no way be lessened or clitninishe(l. O'f course, such an a1nount of tnatetial, together with the several full page illus- trations, will require a considerable in- crease in the size of the paper. However attractive such a plan n1ay appear, there is one important eJ:en1ent that is entirely lacking. It is particularly

r 1 l T:HE C,ONCORDlENSlS 1 1 noticeable that but two undergraduates appear in the list of contributors. Both of these n1en are on the Board. 'Dhe one purpose of this editorial is to acq l!laint all the stuJents of the u·niver- sity with our plans and to offer a very cordial invitation to aU who feel inclined to S1!tbrnit articles. We are well aware that there are several n1ert, both in the acaden1ic and in the professional depart- tnents who have nG n1ean ability in storv ' . writing. We are also well aware that such 1nen, though obliged to avoid the exacting labors of routine work. would be g:lad of an opportunity for an occa- sionalli exercise of their talents. Such an opportunity is now offered in the full confidence that the ·Christmas nutnber will savor of the spirit of the undergraduate as well as the spirit of t'he loyai alun1nus. THE FLAG-POLE AFFAIR. h1 another colun1n will be found an account of the facts relative to the cut- ting down of the flag-pole. T:he n1atter is one of interest to us because we had always loved the sig·ht of our natiori:s banner flying in such a conspicuous place-the center of so 1nany of our coi- lege activities. In writing of the Freshmen's side of the case, it appears to us that there are son1e extenuating circun1stances. \1-ie doubt exceedingly if the Fres:hmen are open to just censure. Were this a mili- tary school where the sacredness of the Hag anc1 everything pertaining to it 1 was regarded with scrupulous care, we could not take the position we do. On the contrary, it is well to remetnher at the very :first that here at Union we haye no systen1 of saluting the flag nor, in fact, auy other systen1 for inspiring the proper regard for it. No doubt the feel- ing for the flag's inviolability has been ilnplanted 111 every heart long before college is reached. It is only right that such a feeling sho·uld ,exist. All pity to the man who lacks it l But we n1ust not forget that the cus- tonl of hoi ding flag rushes is very co1nn1on in n1any of our lnstitutions of learning. We are of the opinion that even we had three such rushes last year. This, to- gether with the fact that the Freshmen had not publicly been apprised of the discontinuance of the cus:ton1, seems to release thern of at least a great atnount of the blarne. We 1nust further state that no insult to the Hag itself was offered. The 1910 banner was hung in the night after the flag had been taken down until 1110t11111g. The Sophomores' side of the matter presents a very different :aspect. Here no quistion of patriotism is involved. It is only a n1atter of taste. We are of the opinion that our zest for ren1oving the obnoxious banner by cutting down the pole would be perceptibly ditninished if we knew beforehand that the pole was to be re1noved by the coHege authorities within a very few days. But this last is something that is not of vital itnportance. Perhaps the Sopho- rnores are justified by the fact that .there was little time for thought. Be that as it n1ay, we frankly confess that we find little for censure in the whole affair. Both Freshmen and Sop'hon1ores did the natural thing. Nevertheless, we 111 ttst be equaUy frank in saying that we are exceedingly sorry that the handsome flag-the gift of a generous friend of the college, by the way-will no longer wave in its ac- custon1ed place. We miss it now and probably shall, aU through the rest of this year.

THE CoNCORD IENSIS VOL. XXX. UNION COLLEGE, NOV. 24, '1906 No . .8 Opportunities. CivH engineers are an irnportant factm· at Union, so thi~s article fPoin the Brool{lyn Daily Eagle, u:nder the title of \Too Few Engineers\ will surely find s01ne interested readers. ''Exceptional dem,ands are bein.g made upon eivil engineers throughout the country by great bui'lding enterprises. In the case of New York State, the State Engineer and 8urveyor has found it difficult to get the proper a.m,ount of technical help to meet the heavy dernands made by can~L'l and good roads \Y'Or<k. For this reason the state's civil s~I'vice ex- aminations have been extE\ndcd to other st'J.tes to secure the required assistance. The sam.e s 0 arC'ity of civil en gin 0crs is co1nplained of by New York City in its b~g watenvorks under- taking. The barge canal plans are in the hands cf State Engineer Van Alstyne. While the sta tc has author- ized the expenditure of $101,000,000 for this enter- prise, the 1noney needed must be appropriated frmn year to year by the legislature. The contracts for barge canal work are a wflrded by Supe•~intendent of Public Works, an appointee of the Governor. The State Engineer has the po·wcr to a \Varcl contracts for improved highways, for which the state has an expenditure of $50,000,000. This 1noney must be used only as it is appropriated fron1 time to time by the Legislature, and no other w·ork can be or- dered that is not p.etitioned for by the various county governments.\ Union Alumnus Honored. Attention was called recently in one of the New York papers to the prominence and admiration one of our graduates has obtained in Japan. Dr. Franklin H. Giddings is professor of sociology and the history of .civilization at Columbia Uni- \'ersity, flnd \Vhile his books have been translated into French, Japanese, Spanish, Bohen1ian, Hehrew and Russian, the hook sales of whfch. in the [ast l!l an1Jied language have exceeded those in the UnHed fHa tes, it is the Japanese who appreciate him most. In Japan Prof. Giddings is ranked with p,resid~nt Roosevelt, Admiral Dewey, Carnegie, Harr,in1an .alnd J. Plierpont Morgan. A Japanese student, S.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS Prospects of the Musical Clubs. The very successful season of the Musical Clubs bas lead Manager Parsons to n:take extensive pre- parations for this year's work.The .start has been somewhat delayed on account of trouble with the music dealers but this trouble has been obviated and rea.l work has begun. The Clubs have more than met the expectations of the Leaders and have become very proficient in their several lines. Concert Number One is scheduled for December 12, at Castleto11, N. Y., and will he in the nature of a try-out for the men. The dates now unde1 consideration are Oneonta and Binghamton as well as Franklin, Pa., and ·Dunkirk, N. Y. If possible a four days' trip will be taken during the winter term. It is the intention of the clubs to hold a joint concert at S.chenectady with the Musical Clubs of Ha1nilton College and everything is being done to make this one of the I1Jost attractive n1usical events of the season here. The tax of $1.00 per man will be collected at once in order to insure a successful season's work and it is confidently expected that the 1nanagement will have no difficulty in getHng the money all in at once. Ali things point to the best year the clubs have ever had and it is up to :you to rnake it a sure thing. ME-DIC N-OTES. Nu Sigma Nu Entertains.

Soon the class was gathered, and congratulations upon the ()Ut- witting cf 1910 ·were fiying thick and fast. Thoughts of care were consigned to the back- ground, and merry 1naking had begun fairly, when without warning a door flung open and a fighting delegation of freshmen piled into the banquet h.all.

In the Junior Class of the Law School, thirty-six 1;nen have pledged themselves to join while in the Senior Class thirty-five have put down their names. Eiighty-one are pledged frorn the Pharmacy and M-edical Colleges and 1nore are expected. Two hundred members are needed. The question is now merely a financial one.

Among the bookmakers whom he patronized at the race tracks near New York was one who was troubled with hoarseness and who, to relieve his distress whiLe at w·ork, had frequent recourse to the juice of a lem.on \Vhich he carried in the side- pocket of his coat. On a certain day Bulger had been losing steadily, and as a \last best bet\ he took a plunge with this particular \bookie putting an his available· money on a horse at 10 to 1. The horse won, and with visions o.f high prosperity Bulger started to collect his \Vinnings. But the boo-kmaker had disap.peared. High and low Bulger searched for him, but for a long time in vain. At last he found him at the railroad station waiting for a train to town. \Better settle up,\ said Harry, with the \re- pressed feeling\ which he employs so frequently on the stage. The \bookie\ took the situatinn vvith an equal outward coolness. He reached in his pocket. For an instant Bulger had dreams of getting his just dues. Then the bookrnaker thrust toward the comedi8.n a large, beautiful, juicy, uncut lemon. \Take it,. old man,\ he said: \It's the only thing I've got left.'' Then there is the· night, '\Vith its parade of ·church-goers·. Woe betide th.e student who is caught in that maelstrom. He is picked up and dashed against some tree or building-and there he is found in the cold, gray dawn. And the next day we have an \Afternoon Function.\ It is s;tid by Bulger's friends that .if anybody doubts the veracity of this story he can shnw him the len1on.-New York World.

Y. - Publication Office, ScHENECTADY GAZETTE. We are glad to note that at last faculty and students have n1,et on ·coln- lnon ground fcK the settlen1ent of that 1nooted Senior exarnination question. Misunde1·standings, due to opposite views of a situation, are too often productive· of dissention. Disruption and ill-feeling, en- tirely out of keeping with the size of the n1atter, invariably result, and as long as either dissatisfied party will insist upon considering it in a biased manner, h.ar- 111011 y cannot prevail. VVe think that there is no question an1ong right-n1inded people concerning the pernic-· iousness of yellow journalis1n. When, how- ever_, a publication flagrantly leaves the field of legitin1ate news and. attempts to stir out evidences of discord where no reason for so doing exists, the n1atter has passed even below the pale of conte1npt, and no critioism could be harsh enough to express the in- dignation of the public. The stand taken by a local paper concerning the n1iSunder- stan<ling of the early part of the week deserves the severe censure of the general Schenectady citizen; not only because of the tnisrepresentation of the facts of the case, but also because of the evident de- sire to arouse a feeling of antagonis1n be- tween the faculty and students of a home institution. Before the publication of the second vituperative article, a n1eeting of the faculty and the students had settled the n1atter in a n1ost an1icable manner, and the prevailing opinion of the student body is that their stand on the question be officially expressed through the medium of the college organ. The generous stand of the president in overlooking the occurrence, the settling of the Senior exan1ination mat- ter, and the general opinion that a wrong had been done that should not occur again, indicate the trend of thought; and the col- leg the tne [ see l the . reJ1 ha\ 1 rro' off Va: cut the ten I to Let It glirr.
