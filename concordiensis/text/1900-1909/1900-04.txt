THB ®NG®RDIBNSIS. VoL. XXIII. UNION ,COLLEGE, APRIL 18, 1900. No. 22. ''THE COLLEGE MAN IN BUSINESS.\ Brilliant Address by Dr. J. H. Canfield of Columbia. The n1ost brilliant lecture of the winter term was delivered in the college chapel March 23rd by Dr. Jatnes H. Canfield, librarian of Colum- bia, who had as his theme ''The College Man in Business.\ The address was replete with wisdom, sparkling with wit, and full of splendid suggestions and bel pful advice to college men. The speaker, who has had wide expetience in college work, having occupied the presidential chair in the universities of Nebraska, Kansas and Ohio, discussed the benefits derived from a college education; \Not said he, \from the point of view of a college professor, or a gold- bowed eye glass theorist, but from the experi- ence of a practical business in an.\ \Young men come to college fot· various reasons; some merely because they are sent, and others with earnest purpose. In former times nearly every n1an who came to college had a professional career in view, and indeed, if a college bred man went into business, it was considered that he was wasting his advantages. Now, on the contrary, the percentage of men who go frotn college into the professions is much stnaller, for tnany enter the business world,-the world of constantly increasing activity. Jlot know what to do with an education if they had it. The second class of objectors say that it costs too much. And it does cost. Every- thing costs that is of r.eal value. An education costs tnore today than it ever did, but this is no . valid argument against education. The young man in college is being paid a high compliment ; it means that someone has enough confidence in him to make an investn1ent in him. The other class of business men who belittle the importance of a college training say that it is a hindrance, because it tnakes one think of some- thing else than business. This is true, but does it not rather argue for than against the training? It enlarges the horizon and makes a man a broad-minded citizen. \Speaking frotn experience,\ the speaker went on to say, \ there are three pa1ts of the business world that have no use for college training. To the first of these belong those who feel that they can live only by another's downfall-men who live to work, instead of working to live. But these individual$ would \The best business men will tell you that your college training pays in the best sense, though not, perl1aps, in the way you may think. The young men who have a solid founda- tion of Latin, Greek and Philosophy, the usual A. B. degree, are eminently fitted for large use- fulness. Without hesitation I can say that the average college graduate rises aboye his co- workers who have not had a liberal education. In the business world the question is not, 'what have you learned,' and 'what have you done/ but rather 'what can. you learn,' and 'what can you do.' Can you set yourself to the task that knows not the word failure ? Do you know what it is to apply yourself to a given problem until it is solved ? How facile are you ? How resourceful ? Have you the faculty of organi- zation ? Can you see clearly ? Can you see far? Above all, are you able to so keep your- self in hand that when the one opportunity of your life cotnes you will be ready to face it ? Health, courage, cheerfulness, intelligence, keen insight, continuity of effort, freedom from vice, application,-these are necessary qualities in a business, and these are sotne of the things your college education gives you.\

THE CONCORDIENSIS. The speaker claimed that a college graduate, if he takes advantage of the opportunities offered, is able, by having his 1nind trained, to grasp more quickly the problem which every day business brings,-that, all other things being equal, he is able to outstrip in point of useful- ness to his employer those who have not been trained to think, and to think to some purpose. He adtnitted that some college graduates had p1·oved to be failures, but asserted that they were ,men who \vould have failed in any case. ''Perhaps,\ said the speaker, \some of you are handicapped by good looks (I am not able to see clearly and cannot tell at this distance) ; per- haps by ugliness, perhaps by poverty, or most of all by wealth, which, by removing the necessity is apt to sap the energy. But what- ever tnay be your condition in life, if you are honest and earnest, if you place your aim high, and press steadily forward, you are sure to succeed. '~.There are those who say a college man will never be a millionaire. That may be true, and I hope you will never reach that position, if in coming to it you become a slave to the love of gold. Money is good, it brightens life; it is the love of money that is the root of all evil. As in a picture gallery one sees here a bit of twilight sky, there a cluster of pine trees, and anon a sandy shore depicted, and as the recol- lection of these will brighten days otherwise dark and dreary, so what you learn in the four years of college life will be sure to brighten the rest of your days, by giving you the power of find- ing beauty in life's situ plest places. It will do more, it will be an inspiration for good, and will be sure to spur you on to greater atnbitions and nobler aims~ \The world has a right to expect that you will render to it a return for what it has given you, and you will get from the world just what you take to it. You don't have to wait for the ne:xt world to get your reward ; it comes in this. Young ~entlemen, don't take your faith away from the An1erican people. The world expects you to raise the average American life by first putting yourself above it. I regard education not alone as a benefit, but as a complete and absolute necessity to the world. We of America have free thought, free speech, a free press, a free church, free men, and free education, and under God, our trust shall be in these.\ THE NEW YORK TQIP. Southern Tour of the Musical Clubs Next Week. The musical clubs will leave college for the annual New York trip April 26. They will give a concert in Saugerties in the evening, and will arrive at I(ingston on the 27th, where they will appear under the auspices of the Central Y. M. C. A. The concert in New York will be given on the 28th in Carnegie Lyceum under the auspices of the Union College Alumni Asso- ciation of New York. The New York concert promises to be a great success in so far as the clubs are concerned. All the members of the several clubs are strictly college tnen, and fro1n ptesent indi- cations the association will be greeted by an audience of Union men even larger than last year. Edgar S. Barney, chairman of the com- mittee, who has done so much towards making fonner concerts a success, is at present putting forth greater efforts than ever before. The managers and directors of the several clubs should be highly comtnended for their excellent work, which cannot fail to reap good results. The glee club will sing for the most part old Union songs, so well received by the alumni in forrner years. The other clubs will introduce entirely new selections. The clubs will prob- ably stop at the Savoy. Among the patronesses are : Mrs. Daniel Butterfield, Mrs. Sil~s B. Brownell, Mrs. Edwin Einstein, Mrs. Joseph B. Bloomingdale, Mrs. William H. Moore, Mrs. William H. Elroy, Mrs. George F. Allison, Mrs. Daniel S. La1nont, Mrs. George F. Seward, Mrs. Gilbert J(. Harroun, Mrs. Frank Bailey, Mrs. Clark Brooks, Mrs. Frederick W.

7 INTE\RCOLLEGIATE ORAT,ORY. ClaytonJ. Potter, 1900, chosen as Union,s ~epresentative. The preliminary to select Union's representa· tive at the Intercollegiate Oratorical -Contest was held Thursday night. Clayton J. Potter, 1900, received the appointment, and Emil L. Winter- berg was selected as alternate. There were four contestants and the cotnpetition was vet·y close. freedotn held by the Boers with that of the English and showed that the former people were not in accord \Vith the titnes, that the wodd had moved past them. He said that the Indians, , the Chinese, and the Japanese have had to face the same problem and had to give way to civil- ization and that the Boers in turn wiH have to do the .same thing. England has granted them many pt·ivileges, more than other countries do their dependancies, and if she had given us like liberties in I 776 Atnerica would never have fought the Revolution. Robert A. Bowden, 'oi, was the first speaker, and his oration was entitled, ''The Battle of Senlac and its Results.'' He explained the historical situation preceding the battle, and pointed out the facts which precipitated it. Ile gave a description of the battle and attributed the deteat of the Saxons to the poor condition of the troops who had fought a battle but a few days before. In treating of the results, he showed that it was a tnoral and social victory, for the Norn1ans inspired the Saxons who lacked spirit, and the latter softened the char:1cter of t11e Normans, noted for tl1eir pride, cruelty and con- tern pt for the lower classes. The next contestant, John McNab, 'or, spoke on \Anglo-Saxon Superiority and its Causes.\ He said that all nations adtnit this superiority. The adtnission is shown by France and G~t:many in attempting to build up strong mtlt~ary resources and by Russia's seeking peace. He attributed this superiority mainly to the love of hotne shown by the Anglo-Saxon people. It is not a mere structure but a \holy of holies\ where we find the purest motives and principles. He pointed out that in other nations various things take the place of the home, as the ar~y in Genuany, and so deprive the youth of . thts influence. He also dwelt upon our excellent systetn of schools which are superior to those of other nations. . ''The South African War,\ was the subject dtscussed by Emil L. Winterberg, 1900, who showed that the few events just previous to the war were not the real cause of it but that it vvas inevitable fron1 the nature of the case and merely hastened by them. He contrasted the idea of . The last contestant was Clayton J. Potter, 1900, whose subject was \A True Statesman.\ He said that the one action of a tnan is often taken as a criterion of his whole life while his other acts are almost totally lost sight of. The soldier is surrounded by the lustre of glory, but the statestnan who for years has been striving to perfect a form of governrnent is often lo~t sight of. Gladstone was a true statestnan havinO' no h vulgar thirst for office, but a man who entered public life to benefit his country. He was a Tory by nature but his liberality of sentiment con1pelled him to sever the bonds that united hitn to the Tory party. His views on home rule are a notable instance of his change of policy on public questions. He finally with- drew from public life, not as a conqueror but defeated often in n1any of his political schemes. From a political standpoint his life would not be called a success, but when we raise the standard of true patriotisn1 and devotion to country he will ever be considered a true example of the nineteenth century statestnan. The Williams Weeldy advocates the abolish- . { '' t\ h h . tng o se speec cs on t e part of sen1ors at the commencetnent exercises, and the substitu- tion of an address by some protninent speaker. The subject for the debate between Syracuse and Dickinson, which is to take place at Car- lisle, Pa., on May 4, is as follows : \ Resolved, that the A. B. degree should be given upon the cotnpletion of all four year courses in liberal art colleges.\ Dickinson will be allowed to choose her side of the question.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ALUMNI NEWS. Items of Interest Concerning Union's Graduates. '34.--The death of James Duane Featherston- haugh, which took place in this city en March 22, marks the close of a most retnarkable career. Born of famous ancestors, endowed with extra- ~rdinary native ability, instinctively a diplotnat, placed in positions suited to the exercise of his own peculiar faculties, Providence seemed to have preordained the tnan for the conditions. Mr. Featherstonhaugh was a very important factor in international affairs, and having figured in the court circles of England and France and in official life at Washington, was etninently qualified to entertain one with many romantic incidents that had come under his observation. The illustrious and venerable man was born on his father's estate in the Town of Duanesburg on August 8, 1815. He was the second son of · George William Featherstonhaugh of England, who was a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and was the first United States geolo- gist. His mother was the daughter of Judge James Duane, the friend and companion of General Washington during the Revolution, and also a member both of the Provincial and Continental congresses, a senator from the state of New York and the first mayor of New York city. Mr. Featherstonhaugh's early education was received at hon1e by private instruction. In 1826 he accotnpanied his father to England, the latter going there to consult with George Stevenson, an eminent engineer, concerning the construction of the Albany and Schenectady railroad. Father and son were abroad two years, and during that tin1e the younger Feather- stonhaugh attended school .at Yorkshire. Upon their return to An1erica they found their tnansion at Duanesburg destroyed by fire, and shortly afterward the family removed toN ew York city, where he attended school at Hyde Park. After completing his preparatory course he entered Union and graduated in the class of 1834, at the age of nineteen. During the next few years he was engaged in railroad construction. In 1837 he again visited England and was present at the coronation of Queen Victoria. In 1839,. in company with his father, he made his third voyage to Europe, and upon this trip his father was named commissioner for Great Britain in the investigation and adjusbnent of the dispute with the United States over the famous North- west boundary, and the younger Featherston- haugh was appointed an engineer of the expe- dition by Lord Paln1erston. He married Emily Chapman at Washington in 1844· The famous Dolly Madison stood before the altar with the bridal party, and President Tyler was a guest at the wedding. In 1845 he and his wife took up their residence at Havre, France, his father having been tnade British consul to the department of the Seine, and while there he witnessed the horrors of the French revolution of 1848. During that event- ful period his father was in clandestine com- munication with Louis Philippe, the fugitive king of France, and by secret instrpctions the two Featherstonhaughs managed to have the fugitive conducted to an English vessel in the harbor, and thus the king escaped to England. Frotn France father and son went to England, and in 1855 they returned to take possession of the Duane mansion in Duanesburg. In 1866 Mr. Featherstonhaugh came to this city, and for more than a decade was city engineer. While in the diplomatic service of England he met the greatest statesmen and diplomats of the age, and in this country he possessed a no less distinguished circle of acquaintance. He met and knew scores of Revolutionary heroes. He is survived by three sons, Doctor James Duane Featherstonhaugh, Jr., '67, of Cohoes, Doctor Thomas R., '71, of Washington and Counselor George W., '71, of this city. The funeral was held frotn Christ ch~rch, Duanesburgh, of which the deceased had been a vestryrnan for over forty years. Mr. Featherstonhaugh was a mem- ber of the Zeta Psi fraternity. '96.--Alfred G. Sommer is now connected with the Ne\ys Publishing Company of North Tonawanda, N.Y., as editor of the Daily News and Tonawanda Herald. '98.-Christie A. Hartnagel of the Albany Normal College was on the hill Monday.

TilE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 BASEBALL SEASON OPENS. Collegians Easily Defeat Local Amateurs. The heart of the college ball crank was gladdened, and the hope of every collegian for a bright coming season was raised last Satur- day, as they saw Johnny Edwards' pets skipping lightly about the campus, playing well and steadily, and easily welching by a score of eight to one the local Schenectady City nine in a seven inning game. Considering the chilly breeze that swept over the campus, the soggy condition of the field, and the earliness of the season, the Union men exhibited a snap and vigor in their play quite surprising for the opening game. The· town men, on the con- trary, showed a decided need of practice. On the collegians' side, a chance was given three men to display their pitching ability. Grout was put in for the first three innings, and was followed by Whitbeck and Edwards for two apiece. The law school tnan, Whitbeck, showed up very well, striking out two men out of his six chances. Edwards and Grout both had good control of the ball. Griswold, behind the bat, proved himself a player of no mean ability. The work of the infield was entirely satisfactory. \Bobby\ Robinson was back at his old position in left field, while Cook and Schroeder took care of centre and right field respectively. The fielding of the nine, as a whole, was good. The base running and lack of good judgment on the part of the batters is the chief criticism against the men. Several times a little waiting at the home plate might have forced in the three rnen on the bases. Coach Tamsett intends devoting some ti n1e during the coming week toward the remedy of both these faults. The gatne in itself was devoid of interesting features. Union took the lead at the start, and gradually increased it. Schenectady got three men on bases in her half of the second, but the batter fanned the air and made three out. Schenectady secured her only tally in the third. The score: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Union. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 0 2 0 0 2 3-8 Schenectady City. . . . 0 0 1 0 0 0 0-1 Batteries-Schenectady City, Rice, O'Neill and Kelly; Union, Grout, Whitbeck, Edwards and Griswold.

C& N CORDIEN SIS, Sb.1gle Copies, TERMS: $2.00 per Year, in Advance 10 Cents Address all communications to THE CoNCORDI- ENSIS, Box 213, Schenectady, N. Y. Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., .as second- class matter. (JlJ.as. Burrows, Printer, 41-4: State Street. Schenectady, N. Y. THE business manager desires that all outstnd- ing:- subscriptions be paid at the earliest possible dctte. Subscribers who are in arrears will confer a favor by giving this matter immediate attention. 'f\HE PROSPECTS for a successful base ball season are very promising. With the excellent schedule of g-ames, a good coach, and the assurance of an unasually good team, we ought to be able to come off at the end of the season with many laurels. :B1.1t the responsibility does not rest entirely with the team. The student body has a very important sll.al'e in the enterprise. The first duty that lies before every student is the prompt payment of his sttb~cription, for the schedule cannot be carried oti.t ttnless the money is paid in. Secondly, do not let your interest in base ball cease with the pay- men.t of your subscription but come out and watch the team in their practice, encourage the players, sho0w that you feel an interest in the team's work and success. Attend every game that is played on the campus, and by cheering the players show them that they have the entire support of the whole student body . IN OUR zest to turn out a successful base ba11 team, track athletics must not be lost sight of. In so far as base ball is concerned, most of the pre- liminary work for the season has been done and the team. is now on a firm footing. In the case of track athletics, this can hardly be .said to be true. To be sure, there has been some indoor training on the part of a few men, and the two under classes have been taking a regular course in gymnasium work, but what is needed now is faithful outdoor preliminary ·work. Last week's call for candi- dates was responded to by only .a few men. As was said in college meeting Monday morning, every tnan who has any athletic ability whatever ought to come out daily and try for the team. There should be a squad of forty or fifty on the track every afternoon. The management expects to engage a competent coach at once. In the mean;. time, however, let everyone come out and get into form. This applies in particular to the under classes, and especially to the freshmen. IT IS NOT now too early to turn our thoughts toward the one hundred and third Commencement of Union college. The intervening- period of ten weeks will have elapsed before it can be realized, and now is the time for students, faculty and alumni to unite in an earnest efiort to make this, the last Commencement of the century the grandest one in Old Union's history. There are, of course, many things which work together to make a suc- cessful commencement. Some of these factors are of larger, some of smaller importance. But there is no more potent force in making Commencement a success, than a goodly representation of alumni. A successful alumni day celebration means more for Commencement than almost any other feature of the week. Of late years it has been the custom of the general alumni association to send out every spring a circular letter to the alumni urging their presence here in June. In addition to this,. the

THE ·OON·OORDIENSIS. 11 president has communicated with the t:nembers of decennial classes with a view of working up reunions. The results of all these efforts have been sometin1es gratifying, and at other times decidedly unsatisfactory.. The reason for this latter state of affairs is due, we believe, in part at least, to the fact that the class feeling has been suffered to decline, and with no organization in existence it has been found almost impossible to get the members of the class to come together. To each class secretary belongs the duty of keeping a record of its membership, and of working up from time t.o time reunions. But at present there is no means available for ascertaining wh.() are the class secretaries, and with the excepti<>n of a few classes, the office, if it exists at all,. is purely nominal. Such being the case, it has seemed advisable that The Concordiensis assume Ute duties of the class secretaries, and by collecting and publish- ing information concerning the members of centen- nial classes, endeavor to reawaken class spirit with a view to having enthusiastic reunions in June. The plan is to gather at once from all possible sources, personal items about the members of the classes of '50, '60, '70, '75, '80, '~0 and '95. These alumni notes will thea be suitably arranged, and those of each class published in a separate issue of the paper. Copies of the class issue will be sent to every living member of the class. This plan with the usual announcement will, we feel sure, show good results on next alumni day. For the work in hand then, we ask the interest and aid of the fraternities and all -who have at heart the success of the 1900 Commencement. This undertaking is of itself no mean task~ and only through cooperation can b€ fully accomplished, The oldest college in the world is M<>hammand College, at Cairo, Egypt, which was I,ooo years old when Oxfoxd was founded. It has I I ,ooo students. About eighty fellowships varying from $120 to $520 per year are offered by the University of Chicago for graduate students of a.ny college, pursuing special work in that University. CHAN:GES IN EN:GLISH COU~SES AS ANNOUNCED' BY DR. T~UAX. This term ~enior scientifics are taking senior elective English literature in place of the course in British and American orators. In I 901, the course in the Orators vdU be given as the senior third term elective,, and the scientific section of 'o2 will take it with the seniors. In 1901, the junior course in Poetry will be given the full time devoted to EngHsb. in the second term, to provide room for additional lectures and fuller critical appreciations. The course in the English Novel will be transferred to the senior electives. In 1902, the co·.:trse in the Orators will be given to junior scientifics as the required third term work. CHAPEL EXE:RCISES. Instead of regular chapel exercises a special service was held last Friday tnorning in the chapel. Dr. Raymond 1~ead frotn St. Luke's gospel the portion narrating the last days of the Lord upon earth, and said that this scriptural event has had more influence upon the history of the world than any other. It exhibits the passions, the hah·ed, the injustice of tnen turned against one man. The Jews destroyed not one who had sinned but who everywhere had given help and comfort. Nothing sth·s men so much as opposition to their views, and this is the secret of their opposition to Christ. Christ is crucified \vherever innocence and right is outraged. It is the revelations we have in the sufferings of Christ that holds the attt ntion of tnen and not merely physical suffering. His suffering is a revelation of the love of God, and when the consciousness of sin comes upon us then we should think of God as one who will forgive our sin even to the end. A Freshtnan once to Hades went, That something he might learn ; They sent him back to earth again, He was too green to burn. -Ex.

·THE CONCORDIENSIS. 13 Several of the clHss divisions have organized baseball te~rns. The freshn:1en en,gineers are planning to play the U. C. I. tea·rni, and other games are scheduled,, an1ong thetn• ()ne between the \Rhetoricians\ and the \Spa mi~n·ds\ of the senior class. · Dr. P. R. Furbeck, '54, of G 1oversville; Capt. ;Ed. P.

The students of the Union Classical Institute will gi y~ their annual musicale in the Van Cuder tpis evening. A chorus <>f 150 voices will be under the able directioB ()f Professor George Edgar Oliver, and the entertainment will be concluded by the renditi<>n of a French charade. At a tneeting of the Hudson River School- masters' Club held in Albany April 6-7, the subject \Personality in Education'' was dis- cussed by President Raymond fn~tn the college standpoint. Ordinary occasions were dealt with by Prof. J. I. Bennett, Jr.~ ttnd unusual cases by Dean B. H. Ripton. Rev. William Elliot Griffis, D. D., of Ithaca, at one time acting pt·ofessor of philosophy at Union, delivered an address on '' Aerent Van Curler, Founder of Schenectady, and the City's Early History,\ at the Van Curler opera house on March 29. The lecture was delivered under the auspices of the Netherland Society. The Union alumni residing at Detroit, Mich., tendered a reception to President Raymond in that city on March 19. The affa.ir was held at the house of Dr. Williatn D. Maxon, '78, and a very pleasant evening was spent reviewing college memories and talking over old times. It is probable that an alumni association will be formed there in the near future. The Musical Association gave its annual ·con- cert at Albany, March 24, when a large and enthusiastic audience greeted the college musicians. Much credit is due the alu.tnni, whose loyalty assisted in making the affilir a success. After the concert, the collegians were entertained at the Fort Orange club on the invitation of William P·.

At a recent banquet of the Yale alumni of Eastern Pennsylvania, Homer Greene, '76, represented Union College on the toast list. The only other college thus represented was Prince- ton. The speech deeply stirred all who heard it, and it is therefore published in these col- umns. The main text follows: ''I am very glad of the opportunity of speaking on this occasion, and I an1 particularly pleased to be here as the representative of Union College. It is not so much the compliment which your con1mittee has paid to tne as the compliment Old Yale has paid to Old Union. Though business cares threatened to detain me, I knew that for myself and for my college it was an opportunity I could not afford to lose. I don't want it to distress me as long as I live that I missed a golden opportunity like this to say a good word at a Yale dinner for the alma mater whom I cherish and- esteem and revere. I know that I ought tonight to express my admiration for that magnificent institution in whose honor we are gathered, but I feel that I should utterly fail in any attempt to do her justice. But when it comes to talking about Old Union,-well, the task is even greater. ''The best evidence of the standard of a college lies in the character of her alumni ; and the people of Scranton are not unacquainted with Union products. Some of your best business men are Union graduates. Those of you who attended the New England dinner held in this room in December, cannot fail to remember the charm and brilliance of an address by a Union alutnnus, Dr. Willian1 H. McElroy. Nor will you S_?OO forget the masterly speech made here on a similar occasion a few years ago by Dr. Raytnond, an alumnus and president of the col- lege, a tnan who is admired and esteemed by all who know htm. Another loyal alumnus of Union who is well and most favorably known in Scranton is Charles Emory Smith, the present postmaster-general of the United States, a man whose ability and manhood and broad states- manship ought to and will one day, I trust, land him in the presidential chair. ''But it were vain to call the roll of disting- uished alumni, no matter how long. It is riot, after all, the tnan who has achieved fan1e and fo.r- tune, whose name is a household word and whose deeds make history, who most truly reflects on his fellow men that which his college has given him. He must have credit indeed for what he has done. As a rule his eminence has been achieved by hard and persistent labor, the slne qua non of permanent success. But he should not be put forward to the exclusion of every one else. No college ever yet graduated a body of students every one of whom becatne or will become great. I do not think I put it too strongly when I say that not five per cent. of the members of any class of. any college become what the world calls great. Nor do I think I put it too strongly when I say that barely one per cent. of the graduates of any first- class college n1ake total failures in life. ·The weeding process during the college course is too thorough and severe for that. No more splendid example of the law of the survival of the fittest can be produced than is found in the graduating class of any high grade college in this after glow of the nineteenth century. \But when you have set aside your nine per cent. as men of mark and your one per cent. of 1nen too deeply marked-what about the other ninety ? Why, Mr. President, they are the men who teach and preach and write and build, and plead causes and heal diseases and do the

6 THE OONCORDIENSIS. world's work modestly, thoughtfully, thoroughly, honestly, and whose names are seldom h~ard outside their own con1munities. But in those communities, sir, they exert an influence inex- pressibly great. They set the mental and moral and ethical peace for the people among whom they dwell. It is due to them that the culture of the schools and the ethics of the better life are being spread broadcast throughout the land. It is due to then1, more than to any other class of citizens, that practical refonns and broader theories, and .purer politics are cotning to be known and appreciated and reverenced and fought for with a vigor and enthusiastn and determination that must finally prevail. It's the average alumnus, after all, who among college men is doing the best and biggest part of the world's work. ''I take it, sir, that the true purpose of any col- lege is not so much to produce the genius who shall do mighty things on a broad arena,-not so much that as it is to train the average man to make the most of the life which is his, to become proficient in any calling he may choose, how- ever humble, and a good citizen ofany comnlu- nity, however small, in which his lot is cast. ~'And in this noble and munificent work, God speed your college, sir, and yours and tnine and all others to the end that the work may be well done. That is one reason why I am glad and proud to stand with you tonight and wear the blue and do honor to that historic and magnifi- cent institution you represent ; but even as I do so my heart yearns and my eyes turn to those gray old walls, and that grove-crowned hill on which the rising and the setting sun bestowed its glory throughout the four brightest, freest, fairest years my life has known.\ Y. M. C. A. NOTES. The Sunday afternoon vesper service is dis- continued for the remainder of the term, to be resumed again in the fall. Fred. M. Gilbert of Yale, who intends leav- ing for the foreign field next year, gave an inter- esting talk on the testimonies given for Christ, at last Tuesday's meeting. BASEBALL SCHEDULES. SYRACUSE.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 ALUMNI NEWS. Items of Interest Concerning Union's Graduates. [Every student and alumnus of Union is invited to send to the Editor-in-Chief items of interest for insertion in this department. News of a personal nature, about any alumnus, will be gladly recei- ved and printed.] '28.-Joseph D. Husbands, A.M., the oldest living alumnus of Union, died at Rochester on April 2. He was born in Barbadoes, West Indies, on August 13, 1809, his father being at that titne the representative of the British crown there. His father catne to the United States in 181o, and settled in Hartwick, Otsego County, near Cooperstown. The son, Joseph Dattin Husbands, first attended school at I-Iartwick Seminary in 1816, and in 1824 entered Union, graduating in the class of I 828, and up to the titne of his death was the oldest college gradu- ate in the United States, according to college records. In 1840, Mr. Husbands went to Rochester, where he becatne a pron1inent tnem- ber of the bar, aNd in 1867 he was appointed registrar in bankruptcy. Shortly before this he had been appointed United States Cotntnissioner for the Northern New York district. In 1856 he left the practice of law and became Secretary for the National Temperance Union, traveling and speaking through many states in behalf of temperance. The oldest living alumnus of Union at present is Horace 0. Moss of New Berlin, N. -Y~ '3}.-William Fullerton, for many years a pron1inent lawyer in New York City, and in the late sixties a justice of the Supreme Court and of the Court of Appeals, died at Newburgh in his eighty-third year. Judge Fullerton was born in Orange County, and entered the class of '37 at Union. He was admitted to the bar in 1840, and during his active life was engaged in many important cases, one of them being the famous trial of Henry Ward Beecher, in which he was one of the attorneys for the plaintiff. Since his retirement frotn practice a few years ago, he has resided in Newburgh. '32.-Union lost a venerable and distinguished son by the recent death of Dr. Charles E. West who died at his hotne in Brooklyn. The noted educator was born at Pittsfield, Mass., in 1809. He was fitted for college at the Berkshire Gym- nasium. Mr. West taught school during the winter of 1828 and 1829, and in May, 1830, he entered Union. In 1831 he was chosen a mem- ber of the Phi Beta Kappa Society for scholar- ship, and in·· 1832 he was graduated. He headed the roll of seventy-five classmates, and delivered the Greek oration at comtnencement, although he had read Greek but one term in college. His principal studies were physics and mathematics. The latter were his delight under Professor Jackson, '26. The course was the san1e as that at West Point. In 1833 Mr. West took up his residence in Albany, and studied law in the office of Atnos Dean, '26, LL. D., who was later chancellor of the Uni- versity of Iowa. Mr. West later became interested in edu- cational work, and founded the Albany Classical Institute. He married, and accepted the pro- fessorship of chemistry in Oneida Institute at Whitesboro, near Syracuse. He took a post- graduate course in science at Yale, and in 1839 he was called to take charge of Rutgers Fetnale Institute in New York City. Under his direction the school attained great success. Dr. West also found time while in New York to con1plete his legal studies under the direction of John VanBuren, 'r8, and Judge Hamilton W. Robin- son, '32. He was examined, and admitted to the Supreme Court bar in 1844. The degree of M. D. was conferred upon Dr. West about this time by the University of New York. In 185r Dr. West became president of the newly founded Buffalo Female Academy. He held this position until 186o, when he became president of the Brooklyn Heights Seminary. The success of the institution under his long tnanagement of twenty-nine years . is widely known. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Antiquarian Society of Denmark and tnany other scientific societies, and in 1889, when eighty years old, he relinquished the labors of education and retired to his books and his ease.

Tllm c·oNCORDIENSlS. · Rev .. Dr. Richard S. Storrs, '53, was one of the officiating clergymen at the funeral. '39.-The Putnam County Repuhlican pub- lished in its editorial columns a beautiful tribute to the late William James Blake, A. M., founder and senior editor of that paper, who died after success. The funeral services were held at Mr. Blake's late residence in Carmel, N. Y.\ '47 .-The Rev. Samuel J. Austin died recently at his home in Warren, Mass. Mr. Austin graduated from Union with honor, and was. elected to Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation he entered '.the minish~ and ~was engaged in. his clerical duties at the time of his death. : ~ '49.-A souvenir presented to General Dan- iel Butterfield of New York city by the Dewey Al'ch committee on behalf of the National Sculptural society, consisted of a series of prints a useful and upright iife of nearly eighty-three years. The Republican says in part: '\The young man prepat·ed for college at the old Montgomery Academy, and entered the sopho- more class in 1837. 'Old Union' was at that '· tin1e under the presidency of the venerated Dt·. Eliphalet Nott, who for sixty years gave it a wide reputation, wielded a strong influence in the educational world, and left an unmistakable impress on the characters of those vvho went out fron1 its gray walls. Not only did Dr. Nott stitn ulate the young men under his fatherly care in the pursuit of knowledge, but noble aims and high ideals were constantly held up fot· their emulation. Mr. :Blake took a classical course, and became proficient in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, while science and literature were not neglected. In college he was noted as an earnest student, a ready debatet·, and also developed rare oratorical powers, which were frequently made manifest during his lega'l career. l-Ie was graduated in the class of '39, among whose members were Joel T. Hadley, the well known historian, and Benjatnin F. Dunning,- who attained prominence in law. In 1843, Mr. Blake was licensed as an attorney and bega,n practice in Cold Spring, N. Y. The talents and brilliant powers of the young lawyer could not go long unnoticed, and in 1846 Gover- nor' Silas Wright appointed him master and 'examiner in the Cout't of Chancery. As a pleader at the bar, he had few equals. An old - lawyer; an intimate friend of h~s, said of l1irn, 'When he stood up to plead a cas~, he n1ade the court rootn ring with his eloquence and held his hearers spell-bound--, throwing l1is whole soul into his words.' Impaired . hearing sent Mr. Blake into the nevvspaper business, for he ;; was the man chosen for editor of the official republican organ of Putnam County, which paper was first issued in r858, and was a decided frotn negatives of the arch as erected in Madison square. It is a token of appreciation of the general's services as chairman of the Dewey Reception committee. '61.-J ohn Andrew Barnes died at Cologne, Gennany, on March 25.

Y., as second- cla.ss matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414: State Street, Schenectady, N. Y. THE COLUMBIA GAME to be played at Albany Friday afternoon should attract a large attendance of Union tnen. Let us support the team by our presence and encouragement. WoRD has been received by Professor Opdyke that the necessary action for the admission of the University of Rochester to the N. Y. S. I. A. A. has been taken by both Colgate and Hobart. Union's sanction was granted last term. Rochester is now, therefore, a regular member of the league, and the possibility of the intercollegiate meet again being of a dual nature is made itnprobable by her assurance that she will be fully represented in the latter part of May. Union congratulates her sister colleges upon their wise action and cordially wel- comes the new member. A SLlGHT attack of \spring fever\ has taken hold of the students during the past few days. The campus, with its fresh emerald hue and diamomd setting, has tempted them from the dor- lnitori~s, which seem to offer only a pale classic gloom~ The malady annually anticipated by the facul~y has appeared in malignant form. The \polet-'' leaves his books to bathe in the sunlight, and w.a.nders about in indolence~ Students are apt to lose sight of the primary object of our course at col:Lege, and of the purpose which should ani- mate ~~·s. It's all very well to have enthusiasm, but in our zeal to bring honor to our alma mater in a.it.letics, let no man devote hims~lf to the wooii~g of the gentle and salubrious spring zephyrs to the Ex:clusion of regular college duties. THF; OLD TIME PROBLEM of inter-class baseball games is again presenting itself to the under- grad 111a,te mind, and students are asking each other, '''will they be delayed as usual, and pulled off in the customary farcial manner?\ Th~re is but onE answer to this query,-unless a decided refor.m in the present methods is effected. In several other colleges, a very practical schetne is beingsttccessfully carried out. Entire supervision of the matter is granted the 'varsity captain or manag-er. This official sets a date for each game, as co11venient as possible, and forfeits it to the opposiDg nine if one team fails to make its appear- ance ai: the appointed time. Managers of class teams -wbo neglect their duties are thus brought sharp1:,y to a sense of their obligations. The adoptio11 of such a course at Union would revive interes.t in class athletics. The plan is certainly wortbf\\of immediate serious consideration. RE..ADERS will notice the unusually large atnount of alutnai notes published in this week's issue. Thro-ugh.out the year the editors have striven more than ever before to emphasize this feature of the college paper. In our last issue a plan was explained which is intended not only to lend additic.nal interest to the alumni columns but especiCI.1ly to awaken interest in the coming com- menc~ooent among graduates who may intend reverera.tly and properly celebrating the wooden,. tin, chi11a, silver, golden or other anniversary of

Succeeding issues, similar articles will include records of members of the classes of '60, '70, '75, '80, '90 and '95. Copies of these issues will be sent to every living member of the respec- tive classes, and while any information in regard to these alumni is most welcome, The Concordien- s is respectfully requests the immediate attention of its readers to its urgent appeal for class of '50 statistics for next week's issue. WEST POINT, 11; UNION, 7. Cadets Win at Base Ball. A slowly played garne at West Point last Saturday resulted in a victory for the Cadets by a score of I I to 7. Neither side put up a gilt edge exhibition of the national game, though the army men outbatted and outfielded their oppo- nents. The home nine, like true sportsmen, conditionally gave up their last two chances at batting to enable the visitors to catch the train .. The pitcher's box was held down by Witbeck duritag the first three innings, after whieh he was forced to retire through sudden illness. He threw the ball in rattling style, striking out six of the nine men that faced him. The curves of Edwards who followed him, were easily found by West Point. Poor support was given the battery by both Grout and L. G. Robinson. The latter accepted but four out of seven chances at the initial bag. He was badly bruised in the shoulder in a collision with a base runner. Mumma pitched an excellent gatne for the hotne nine. But £ve hits were made off of him by the garnet-stockinged men. The support of his infield was not exceptional. The main lesson of the game for Union would reveal the necessity of a more thorough organi- zation of the infield. It tnust be remembered however, that the team work is not yet perfec- ted. This week's games with Vermont and Columbia should show much needed improve- ment. The summary follows : WEST POINT. A.B.
