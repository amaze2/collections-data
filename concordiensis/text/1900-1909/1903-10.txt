THE 'CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XX\TII. UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 7,. 1903. No.2. COLUMBIA, 36: UNION, o. Played Oct. 3, I9034 In the football game between the Columbia and Union College teatns at the Polo Grounds, New York; Saturday afternoon, times were few when the Coltnnbia n1en could not gain their distance, and as they had the ball nearly all the titne they riddled the Union defence to the extent of winning by the score of 36 to o. 'fhere was a distinct in1provement in Colum- bia's play over that of a week ago, the backs going into the line harder-though they did not fight their way to the last inch as determin- ,edly as they tnigh t have-and the eleven played together better. An in1provement was noted on the ends of the line with roon1 for more speed in getting down the field under kicks. The Union men. n1ade numerous tack- les, having lots of opportunity for so doing, but seemed to be suffering fron1 lack of prac- tice. Prominent atnong Columbia's forces was Metzenthein, a ·wiry, aggressive, alert, blond- headed back, who played his first regular gan1e for the Blue and \Vhite. Nletzenthein followed the ball closely, stuck to his interfer- ence well and did not stop going until he had annexed every possible inch of ground. He n1ade the spectacular play of the gan1e when he gathered the oval in after a muffed punt and rushed it over the goal line. Both sides showed weakness in handling the ball. Col- umbia fun1bled badly in the first half, which fault against less opposition would have been expensive. Penalties for holding and offside were frequent, the new twenty yard penalty for holding being inflicted once on Columbia. It took Colu1nbia about five minutes to land the first touchdown.- The touchdown came in an unusual way. Patton kicked off for Union to Columbia's Is-yard line, and Columbia smashed her way goalward from four to ten yards at a cHp. Using a tandem and the ordi nary backfield formation, the local players waded through their overmatched opponents until the baH was five yards fron1 the desired destination. Here Frambach took it, but fu1nbled while going through the crumbling Union walt The ball rolled over the goal line. 'The Union men were so backward in falling on the ball that Fratnbach pounced on it for a touchdown. Jones kicked the goal, and incidentaily not a goal kick was missed in the gan1e. Soon after the kickoff Union got the ball on another fumble, but could not gain, and P~t­ ton punted to Columbia's 35-yard line. Fram· bach caught. but dropped the ball when tack· led vi~iously and Olmstead nipped it. Patton fell back for a punt, the Col un1bia forward got through on hiln, and his hurried punt was good for only ten yards. Then Columbia rushed the ball more than half the length of the field for a touchdown, the advance inclu- ding a 1o-yard quarterback run by Jones, Smith plugged the centre for the final four yards and a touchdown. Columbia had the ball on Union's Io-yard line when the half ended, the score being I 2 to o. Eishop kicked off for Colurnbia in the second half, and Cook was downed when he caught. Patton punted out of bounds, Colun1 bia had the ball, and in the next line\up Ivfetzenthein circled t~1e end for a 3o-yard run and a touchdown. Patton kicked off for Union and Fisher dropped the ball, but recovered it. Here Columbia was penalized twenty yards for holding, which put the ball on Columbia's s- yard line. Bishop punted, and there was hold· ing by Union, which made it Columbia's ball on the latter's 1o-yard line. Met.zenthein

A punt gave the ball to Union, fol- lowing which Oln1stead 1nade Union's best gain, a dash of six yards around Columbia's right end. Columbia grabhed the pigskin on a fumble in the next scrirntnage, and Bishop ·punted to Union's 35-yard line. Holmes made a mess of. the catch, and Metzenthein who was down with the ·ba11like a deer, darted past the Union tnan, picked the ball up on the ·.bound and scooted over the line for the fourth -· touchdown of the game. After the kickoff ·there was a bad pass from the centre to Bish- op, and the latter was toppled over for a five- yard loss. The next time he got his punt away all right. An exchange of punts put the leather on Columbia's so-yard line, whence Union's left wing was attacked so hard and ·persistently that a touchdown by Fisher was the outcome. Patton's kickoff sent the ball to J. Thorp, ·who was laid low with a beautiful tackle. The .line ripping across was begun once more, and with the same inevitable result. The speed was quickened a bit toward the end. ~ 7 illard being undtr way for the final touchdown just as the whistle denoted that time. was up. Columbia Union ..

VESPER SERVICE. One of tbe n1ost interesting and practically instructive talks ever heard in Silliman Hall was given last Sunday afternoon by the Rev. \V. B. l\..llis of the Congregational church of this city. He pointed out the natural pitfalls and ternptations which naturally lie in a col- lege student's path and the reward to be gained by living a clean manly life. The subject of his address was '' The relation of a man's am- bitions to the method of their realization.\ f-Ie first reviewed the history of Joseph's life and then drew the analogy of it to the life of a man in college and after graduation. He said in part : 1\'here are two passages in the bible relative to Joseph's life which show a marked change in the character of the man. The first is the story of his ·early life, when, worshipped by his aged father and mother he was a 1nere egotist. Next comes the Egypt of his ambitions where he is exalted in power and influence and yet is no longer sufficient unto hin1self. His was the experience of a boy who leaves home not of his own will. There are always two 1nethods in this connection-to leave wil- lingly or unwillingly. I-Iis was the latter. If he had stayed at hotne he would have been ruined by the 1)artiality of his parents. He had an1 bi tions ; he had faith in himself and yet he was hopelessly unsophisticated and con- ceited. The second stage con1es while in Egypt te1nptation visits hi1n and he in the strength of his spirit repels it. He begins to see the world in a new light and a feeling of sympathy for n1ankind enters his soul. He becomes fa- Inous by his prophecy and tneets Pharoah who raises him to the second power in the land. This is a short biography of so great a man

THE CONCORDIENSIS. and yet,. even these two phases of his existence are intensely significant. They teach the. · beauty of life and that is that no one can com- plete what he sets out to do. ,.fhis may seem strange but it is none the less true. For all work in life we are unconsciously fitted and we consciously fit ourselves. That chapter of Joseph's life dealing with his temptation and victory is especially applicable to college men. If we would be real men we must keep our poise and our ideals unstained. What helps a young man most to keep the faith is the know- ledge that there is a God in heaven and that there is a mother and father somewhere whom he does not want to dishonor. V\ 7 hat kept Joseph was the will power of character linked with a memory of the bright old days. The power to resist is found in that new spirit which God puts in every man. Joseph, finally, by the grace of God and of his character came to his own. And so my friends, whose lives are now like Joseph's when he first entered the Egypt of temptation, keep your ideal unblemished so that some day you shall enter the Egypt of your highest am- bitions. . /' \l NINETEEN THREE IN TliE WORLD.

GLOBE HOTEL, ALBANY.-Actv. 'THE CONOORDIENSIS. 9 TO ''KNOCK'' OR TO 'BE \KNOCKED.'' , the one who shows him the hole in his boat than to the one who sees it and says nothing, and he is much more likely to finish his jour- 1..,he editorial on \ :Football \ in the last issue of this paper, especially in the last paragraph, contained son1e 111aterial for careful delibera- tion on the part of the students of this college. The 1nisunderstood, misinterpreted, particular, ' general, broad, narrow, q u:estionable and mis- applied tenn ''knocking \ was the substance of the closing sentences of that editorial. The writer states that the habit is not foreign to Union, is custotnary and very obnoxious. To this perhaps we agree. In a certain and true acceptation of the word, that the habit is harmful, that 11 othing is gained by the prac- tice, we a1so agree. Now the rub co1nes here. \Vhat is the true meaning of \knocking ?\ Ask the man on the gridiron ; then the n1an on the side-lines, and each tnan representing the various activi- ties of college, and each time we dare say the meaning will not be the same. It makes all the difference in the wodd whether the man in·question is the one \knocking\ or the one '' knocked.\ But there is a difference somewhere, a big difference between good, fair, brotherly criti- cisn.1 and ''knocking.\ We on the side-lines are men enough to know that we can criticise a poor play as well as a good one without run- ning our team down. VIe can, in our inexpe- rienced way, recognize weak points without being cynical and n1alicious. \\Ve on the gridiron are men enough to know that our brother students can support us with heart and soul and at the san1e time tell us that we are playing a poor schoolboy game. We can receive such criticism as an evidence of their interest in our own hopes, failures and successes, and if we are men-Union men- such criticism will only spur us on to better effort. We are not little children to cry and pout just because someone frankly tells us we are no good. The man, starting' on a trip across the sea, will be much more grateful to ney. Football men, track men, baseball men, any- one and everyone in college, we are all united in a common cause-the advancement of Union. Let us not \knock\ a man because he does not belong to our fraternity or because he gained the position to which we aspired ; but rather let us criticise him 'vhen he does not do what he is capable of doing or what he should do to forward the interests of our insti .. tution. Let us say that we are too much interested in our own team this fall to be blinded to its faults. We love too much to watch the weak places develop into strong ones, and are too much terrified on perceiving strong places growing weak, to become stoical in our ob- servations, and say nothing. Give us credit for having a fair a1nount of common sense and '\'plenty of manly college spirit.\ \Ve are with our players onevery pass, run, punt and kick-off and please ! please do not tell us to keep silent on anything ·which we cannot praise.

Address all communications to THE CoNCORDIENSIS, Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. College With the return to college many Improvements. marked improvements were manifest. The impetus which the 11ew Electrical Department gave to Union last year seems to have widened until it touches various spheres of college activity. North College is now as comfortable as steam heat, electric lighting and well-equipped bath rooms can make it. South college is equally as good, the wood- work in vYashburn Hall has been refinished and re- painted and the carpenters are busy at vYork completing the engineering laboratory in the rooms which were for- merly occupied by the library. Nott Memorial I-Iall has entered on a new state of being due to the generosity of Andrew Carnegie, The building is steam heated from the furnace under the Oild library; the books are all in their p;laoes and catalogued and the ·fin.ishing touches are being put on. The building will be ready for use in the near future. The Physical laboratory, under the direction of Professor Opdyke, is being over- hauled and the valuable apparatus is being prepared for use. Lastly and most encouraging, the athletic tax is proving its efficiency and is a boon to the college as well as to the managers of the different teams. Contributions, The Concordiensis is intended to be Etc. the official organ of Union University. Such being the case it is the duty of every man connected with Union to do what he can to rn.ake this paper a worthy representative of the U niver- sity's life and of the students' minds. Its columns are open to contributions as well as to criticisms and one of the truest tests of a man's interest in his Alma Mater is to do whatever lies in his power to further her advancement through the \Concordy.'' The opinion is somewhat prevalent, especially among the lower classes, that the Seniors and Juniors ''run'' the . paper arbitrarily and only to their own interests. This is far from being true. Often among the best contributors are members of the Sophomore and Fresh- man classes. The Editors wish to urge all students in the University who would like to try anything along that line to turn some of their talent at least into the columns of the paper which represents their College. There are without doubt many men, who think that their efforts would either not be welcomed or not ap· predated. They are mistaken. It is an actual fact that scarcely one twentieth of the men in College have any active interest in the '' Concordy. '' Half of them care neither one way or other about it. Men vYho have much to say at class and college meetings and boast of their college spirit by suggestion are hardly the ones to stand fast when emerge11cy arises. They seldom contribute and yet their articles (should there be any) would be ·welcome, for the simple reason that they might be excellent, and aside from this, we are all Union men. And so, oh ye F11eshmen, Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors, waken the muses; think deep thoughts which G you: with thing on f feW': and glad Ann mem any the 1 may L< thin Cc of n J H. put Arr. the thy goc rJ 11c Ne the Ra tra bei ca:

Look out for the man who agrees with you in every- thing. College politics are seldom concerned with th.e rights of man. Do not mistake self-complacency for optirn.ism. '' \Ve think at first that home is heaven ; vV e learn at last that heaven is home '' ROBERT H. McCLELLAN. 1823-1902. An \In Memoriam'' pamphlet t() Robert H. McClellan, Union '56, has recently been published. The tribute is written by the Rev. Ambrose C. Smith, D. D. The quotation on the title page reads : \ And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.\ l'he author says in brief: '' Robert H. 11cClellan was born in Vvashington County, New York, on the third day of January, 1823, the oldest son of vVitliam and ::Margaret Randles McClellan. He was of Scottish ex- traction,· his grandfather, Robert McClellan, being a native of Kirkcudbright, Scotland, who came to this country in 177 5· His grandson 'rHE OONOORDIENSIS. 11 and namesake early resolved to obtain a liber- al education, and, with this in view, took a preparatory training in the academ,ies of Argyle and 'Cambridge, N. Y. l-Ie was graduated fro.m Union ·with the class of 1847. During his college course, his mind indicated a marked inclination for classical studies and general literature; and in the latter, notwith- standing the exactions by profession and busi- ness subsequently, he becan1e widely read. However absorbed in business or in public affairs, he never neglected his library. It was his unfailing refuge and solace. With ~is culture, professional learning and training and his interest in politics, he wanted only the gifts of the orator to have become eminent as a public man; notwithstanding this, he was of marked weight and influence in every public position he occupied. He was indeed taken away suddenly (July 23, r 902), hut yet in the full ripeness of his years. He had faithfully served his day and generation. And so in the mellow evening of I if e, while his sun was sinking without cloud to its abrupt setting, he was attended, as well deserved by \That which should accompany old age, As honor, love obedience, troops of friends,\ the friends who now mourn his departure and deplore their own loss. \ There is a safe and secret place 13eneath the wings divine, Reserved for all the heirs of peace; Oh! be that refuge mine!- The least and feeblest there may hide Uninjured and unawcd; 'Vhile thousand fall on every side, He rests secure in God. He feeds in pastures large and fair, Of love and truth divine ; Oh child of God, Oh glory's heir ! How rich a lot is thine ! A hand almighty to defend, An ear for every call, An honored life, a peaceful eve, And Heaven to crown it all.''

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ·GLEE CLUB. 'i'he caB of Leader Mulleneaux for candi ... dates for the glee club was answered on last Mond~lY evening by a number of men. The s,ervices of Mr ~'Ierrihew have been ~ecured for the con1ing season and it is needless to say that the training of the n1en \-Vi ll be the best. Every· man who can sing at :aB should go in for a jJosition in the glee club }ust as earnest- ly as ·he would for football or any branch of college activity. The nu1nber who tried was stnaH in co1nparison with what it should be. Don''t forget ·what it tneans to belong to the glee club and ren1en1ber that you will have chances of going out to other cities to repre- sent Old Union. There will probably be sev- eral concerts this year both in Schenectady and in the neighboring cities. rl'he tax on the student body for the support of the clubs should render the New York trip a certainty. MR. MABIE TO LECTURE.

Pinckney ,-\Valker, Evans & Cogswell Co., Publishers, Charleston, S. C. 1903.] The need of a Life of Calhoun has long been felt in Arnerica, especially in the Southern States, whose principles this great statestnan so ab1y defended. ~1 r. Pinckney, the author of the biography noted above is happy in the choice of such a timely subject. It is his pur- pose to set the life of Calhoun as a background so that the true greatness of the· patriot tnay stand forth fro.m the canvas in all the power of his work and energies. In attempting this, the author has departed from the customary method of biographers and yet his purpose has been accomplished. 'I'o .all those who realize that the true glory of the United States has been brought about chiefly by her statesmen and patriots, this co1nprehensive little volume will be welcon1ed with sincere appreciation. TO THE MEMORY OF FITZHUGH LUDLOW, '56. Child of the dream celestial, to \Whose power The stars looked down and ·listened many an hour Strange were your mystic tales and sweet your songs. Thine was a wondrous life, yet all too short. A deep and kind philosophy you taught.

Thou didst not deal with com,inol1 w~rldly things, Thine was the lesson schooled. thrd suffering pain ; You shov.red the grave wheriB your heart \Vas lain And taught mankind the ag;on~y it btings To walk the wayward' sweet and hitter path, Checking the advent of the sours true birth.

14 THE OONCORDIENSIS. REVISING COLLEGE YELLS. FITZHUGH LUDLOW. (A movement to revise and censorise the college yells has been proposed.) Every Union man, as well as many literary circles, doubtless know more or less of the history of Fitzhugh Ludlow. He was graduat- ed from Union witlL the class of '56 and whHe in college manifested many signs of his natur- al genius. I-Iis \'rferrace Song'' and ''Let the Grecian dream.\ are perhaps the 1nost widely known Union songs. His first book, ''The Hasheesh Eater\ was printed when he was scarcely of age. The wonders of that marvellous work are familiar to many. It was first published by the Harper Brothers in the late fifties. The author died before his talent had fully developed and yet his genius was recognized on both sides of the A tlan- tic. The rancous yell Of old Corne:ll And the whooping hail of Vale; The Harvard howl And the Princeton g-rowl To milder tone must pale. The U. C. shriek And the V sssar shriek And the Hopkins ribald blare ; Northwestern's yelp Of a lion· whelp Shall be softer on the air. The \VeUesley squeal And the Stanford peal And the Rah Rah of old Knox The \Vest Point cry And the Fiske Ki yi Must eliminate their shocks. And the whoop-te·doos Of the Oscaloos Shall be made more circumspect But the college yell Will sound like-well It will hold more intellect. -Chicago Tribune. This too brief sketch of his work is mere- ly introductory to a su-bject which will be wei- coined by all who know of Ludlow. The ·point in question is that his works are being revived. Having fallen into the background in the literary world for a quaL·ter of a century b~fore the onslaught of m:tny and various pro- ductions entitled \novels there were few who dared hope that the art of Fitzhugh Lud- low would be re-awakened and that he should finally come to his own. At present, however, the outlook for these conditions is very hope- ful. In the \ New York Times Saturday Re- See cthat Shoe?

Ludlow began to write while Irving was still living and working : he was briefly associated with the· old Evening Post while the poet Bryant was in the heyday of his fame as an editor : he was an associate of .Charles Dawson Shanly and that other · ' Fitz ' of the fifties and early sixties (Fitz James O'Brien) two gifted Bohemians from Dublin, and of Artemus \Vard on the staff of that brilliant, short-lived weekly called Vanity Fair. \Ludlow's life was short and not particularly merry. It was n1arred by illness and domes- tic disturbances. In the circun1stances, both the quality and volume of his literary work are remarkable. ' The 1-Iasheesh Eater,' which has been neatly republished by the S. G. Rains Company of this city, with a reason- ably appropriate frontispiece and title page taken from the drawings of that short~lived genius of a later epoch, Aubrey Beardsley, was originally published by the I-Iarpers in 1857· ''In putting it forth as a narrative of personal experience, the young author (he was barely twenty-one years of age) was burdened by the IF YOUR \VORK IS DONE BY~ Af~EBICAN LAUNDRY You'il :IJe Plcast_~<.l Witl1 I-t. _.

Perhaps it did : but that does not n1atter now. Conten1- pQ.rary criticism of ' The Hasheesh Eater;' Being passages from the life of .a Pythagorean, is not preserved. 1.,he records of Fitzhugh Ludlow's life and works are· printed in a few words. vVhile ' The Hasheesh Eater' is not of the literary quality and wonderful imagina- tive force of 'The Confessions of an Opium Eater,' it merits republication a .. ~. a curiosity. The descriptions of the drug 'ui)on its victitn are so graphic ; his hallucinations are so clear- ly set down that a sytnpathetic reader feels that he shares them. It was Ludlow's idea that 'The Arabian Nights' and other tales of the Orient were produced under the influence of hasheesh, which is a drug tnade of the resinous gum of Indian hemp. That is an attractive theory and the mere fact that this 'Son of Pythagoras' did not produce new 'Arabian Nights,' under the in~ fluence of the drug does not prove it a false one.'' No, Ludlovi wrote no \Arabian Nights\ but he gave to the literary world, tales equal- ly as mystic, dreams as wonderful and experi- ences as strange as ·ever a gifted son of the East brought forth fro1n his luxurious imagina~ tion. The swing and harmony of his songs touch 1nost closely the hearts of Union men who shall ever be proud of this talented ''Son of Pythagoras.''

MABIE'S LECTURE On Friday afternoon, Oct. 9th, '-o3, Hamil- ton Wright Mabie, associate editor of the Outlook, lectured before a large and apprecia- tive audience in the college chapel. Nearly ~very n1em ber of the student body was pres- ent and many friends of the college and lovers of Mr. Mabie's art catne to hear what the speaker had to say on ''Books and Writers.\ 1,he lecturer was introduced by President Rayn1ond as \An author, an editor ; a tnan who is widely known in 1nany spheres of ac- tivity, and,\ (what appealed most strongly to his listeners) ''as a friend of Union College.\ Mr. J\1abie began by a humorous allusion to his college days and n1entioned incidentally his first introduction to Union. His subject, ''Books and Writers,\ was approached mainly from the standpoint of the appreciative artist. His descriptions and exatnples were perfect in their congruity and fitness. He dwelt long on the artistic side of author's works as well as on the phases of their originality or genius. l-Ie spoke of the great 1nodern authors with an intimate knowledge of their powers and 111 some cases of their personalities. From an entertaining point of view, Mr. Mabie's lecture was a success ; fron1 an artis- tic point of view it was full of '' Grace;· the re- sult of forgotten toil. n Mr. Mabie said in part : \I speak to show why writers are interest- ing and why books are useful to us. rfhe audience of men and women who read books is greatly increased to-day. Popularity does not determine the rank of a book. 'rhe wide sale and reading of sotne books is because the writer has some vital quality in him. No book of real quality is read because it is done with excellent instrun1ents. The writing man is a representative of human nature. A large part of the people are unable to express their thoughts and their greatest joy is in the man who speaks and tnakes clear his thoughts for then1. \The writer is the representative 1nan who expresses what is in us. There are three types of men. There is the tnan who is experienced, then the man who achieves, as 1-Ienry the V., and the man who suffers, as Hamlet, or Romeo. 'i\Thenever these types of men appear in fiction there is an appeal 1nade to everyone of us which is pleasing and wholesome. It is not a vulgar curiosity, nor a desire to pass time away that leads n1en to read fiction not of good quality, but it is caused by the common life in it. \ The book that is si1n ply dexterous or skill- ful is not the book that goes to the heart. Great writers cotne from great races and no great nation fails to produce great writers sooner or later. '' Art is a n1an 's conscience applied to his work. Writing does not come by nature, but comes by very hard work. Any piece of liter- ature which see111s free frotn n1idnight lan1p and seen1s very spontaneous, you ma:y be sure that it was only obtained with the utmost toil. Every 1nan or wotuan serves an apprenticeship before he con1es to any degree of excellence. No 1nan can write too 1nuch, but he may pub- lish too nnich. A writer n1ust beware of be- coming too intimate with the style of great writers. ''Some men get their rhythm fron1 natural sources and some do not. The man who has the natural rhythtn is easy to read or to listen to. The essence of style is the expression of personality. One may be perfectly natural, but yet be deadly uninteresting. Everyone GL~ looks ' son w< all tha ceive ' '' Tl with tl ·ality.

Just as one per- son would l0ok in a window and cotnprehend all that he saw, while another would not re- . ceive any impression of it at alL '' There are plenty of people who are clever with their pens, but have not the least origin- ·ality. ' ' '' The 1na tter of 1 anguage is principally a matter of a cqu iring it. A person tn us t stick to his subject and not wander all over so that when he gets to his s_tory, the reader bas for- gotten his beginning. It is in personality that genius resides. No one can go along violat- ing all the laws of life on one side of nature and build out of the other side of his nature artistic things. 1\'alent without character is an }die thing.

What is our true Suc- cess? If we derive what we ·come to college to secure we have found our success in 'life. We shoald place our ideals very high and al- ways strive for sotnething high and noble ; a true Christian character. vVhen · we have at· tained this height, we knoyv our success. While we have been at home or .in prepa.ratory schools .there has always .been someone to keep us in the right way. As soon as we enter col- lege where restraint is least, we are very apt to drift in the wrong \direction. A man must always stop to think his ·way clearly. Our characters are strengthened or weakened every day of our lives. All low thoughts, be they ever so snJall, help to check the development of character. A good christian character is what our friends want us to have and what we honor our God with. Huw are we to make ourselves men ? There are six words, showing forth the noble ambitions of· three great races, which will help us to gain our success. The words are, '' K.now thyself,\ the motto of the Greek ; \Control thyself,'' the motto of the , . Roman ; \ Deny thyself,\ the ~otto of the Christian. \Ve must first know ourselves to find out how far we h~ve gotten in Christian life. It is hard to understand ourselves and possibly no n1an can ever wholly accomplish this task. We must watch ourselves daily to find out how much will power we have : how .n1uch endur- ance we have and how n1any bad habits are be- He· said in brief : ''This idea of a real sue- · cotning part of our nature. The second step-Control thyself, lies on the border line between tnan and beast. We tnust cultivate our will power and rule our- selves. After we know and control our beings we deny ourselves. \Vithout this final test of Christianity, there would be no happiness or ce·ss should appeal · to every college rnan. vVhen we· are freshn1en, th·e true success, prob- ably does not app.eal· to us. · We are anxious to be popular ; our rninds are distracted, and we are apt to wait too long before realizing what we are here, or should be here for. This sea- son is a propitious time of the year to begin to th..1nk what the real business -of a college n1an . . n1eans. Every tnan should strive for collegiate honors as far as legititnate. These are lauda- ble ambitions but they are far from being all that a man should have. These do not lead . beauty in the world. If, when we leave Col .. ; lege, we feel that our character is Christian, we may be sure that we are on the road to sue- •. cess.''

Mr. Hall was the son of Major Nathanie:I Ney Hall of the U. S. army, who disth1gnished himself in the war of· 18f2.

Considerable discussion has been going on in the I-Iarvard papers about the failure of col- lege n1en to remember faces after introduction. Some of the things said have often been said at all large institutions, nor are they altogether confined to colleges. The I-Iarvard Advocate comments as follows : ''A surprising misap- prehension was shown in a recent communica- tion to the Crimson. 1\'he wt'i ter deplored the fact that men often refuse to speak to men whom they have been introduced to, and in- tentionally cut thetn on the street. It would not be worth while to discuss this view were it not that a considerable number see1n to hold it. That such a misconception should find any ac- ceptance is most unfortunate. It puts I-Iar- vard men in a light which is, to say the least, unpleasant. People seem to forget that it is no easier in college than anywhere else to re- member wh(l>m one has met. Last fall a man said : 'I think so and so is a snob. I met him at the Freshman reception last night and to- day he cut me.' Yet it was not the fault of the older and~busier man for not recalling one i THE CONCORDIENSTS. 9 out of the m:at11 new fac~s· ; if tne- Freshman had spoken first, he would undoubtedly h~ve had his greeting returned.

The Athletic When the movement was definitely Tax. begun last year to institute a regular Athletic tax at Union, there were many who doubted its wisdom and st~Il more there were who questioned the possibility of putting such a pro- ce~ding into force. There were some members of .the student body, who did not sign th~ petition presented for the purpose of carrying ,the athletic tax motion . They doubtless questioned the justice of such a c0urse. 1That was last year. Now that the wisdom, possibility ' ~nd justjce of the new .rule have been tested, partially ' . ' at least, 'there can be Httl~ room left for doubt as to l 'i:he real efficiency of the tax. There is no longet· any ~arrowing uncertainty ii1 the mi:nds of the managers of ~he teams as to whether the financial part of the sea- ~on will prove a saccess .; no thore footsore collectors \rainly pursuing those students whose pr01nises are un- j ~· paid ; no more uneasy students seeking successfully to ~vade the collectors and no more pathetic speeches for financial support by the . representative of the Athletic ~oard in College meetings. Who can say, in the £ace of such evidence that the tax for athletics is not proving itself of inesti-mable ' benefit to the student body and to the college at large ? : The alumni will, no doubt, be anxious to knmv h0w $uch a state of affairs came finally to exist .; how the I I coup de grace was accomplished. We may answer that without the efforts of Assistant Treasurer Pond scarcely nothing practical in this connection would have been brought about. Union owes a debt of gratitude to him for his kindly co-operation in the matter. Track Athletics. The outlook for track athletics at Union this year is fairly bright. There are a great many things that go to :make up a good track team-a good track, good athletics, and a. good spirit and the greatest o~ these is the good spirit. At present we are lacking in some 9f these essentials but as soon as it can be made we are to have a new track and one to be proud of. This fact alone should be encouragement enough for the hnrclcst kind of work on the old trnck in order that one may prove himself worthy of the ne<w? one. \Vhat we. want at Uniotl is not a couple of star men and to have them our only pain t·winners. The fu nda-. mental thing is the good spirit and good will of a couple of hundred men. · Vl e want the interest, enthu-:- siasm and honest work of every undergraduate from the largest senior to the smallest freshman. If .we bit ve this and have it now, at the start of the college year, I do not hesitate to say that by Spring we can develop - a firs· at 0u I ' You bitiol use t do in~ we. are e any~ track self Octo· Don' once. do .fl( CheE of th ,, l l10me every The be e~ ies ' accor the I them retur no ] are s your in a asm in cc Le the s men onr t: forge gethe wave home Rah

Cheer Up 1 The following is from the u Hamilton Life \ ·bf the I oth, under the heading of the '' The Union Game.'' ''A week from today the ·team meets Union on her l10me grounds. We take the liberty of again urging every man in college to make this trip with the players. The power of heartfelt and systematic rooting cannot be estimated. It is safe to say that most of the victor· ies won .on the gridiron are traceable to the support accorded the winning team. Think what it means to the players to ''real'ize . th~t the whole College is back of them to a· man. They are willing to give their best in return. But when the men feel that the College has no heart in their work, the goal towards which they are striving disappears. Think this over and make up your mind to go. The whole College should go down in a body carrying with them such a store of enthusi- asm that Union's much praised rooting will seem feeble in comparison.\ Let them cheer! but let every Union man be on the side lines and out root thetn.

In the parlance of the day \' floating.\ a project means promoting it, or taking the public or a part of the public into partnership. But after an enterprise has been \ floated \ figuratively it sotnetimes becom-es necessary to fLoat it literally. T'hat was the situation up in Canada recently, where a remarkable piece of railroad bridge building was successfully engineered-actually floated. The Intercolonial Railway formerly crossed the ·Miramichi River near New Castle, New Brunswick, by means of some light bridges which were erected in 187o. Heavy increase in the weight of rolling stock forced the rail- road company to replace the light spans of the old bridge with a tnore modern structure. ]Jut, and this was the reason for the novelty in the erection, the railroad company wished to save its old spans intact for tranfser to another part of its line and declined to 'permit its traffic to be interrupted in· any way. How was the change to be made ? The work was by no means easy. Each separate span of the old bridge was 204 feet long and weighed 448,ooo pounds, and the new spans were to be -of the san1e length, to rest on the same masonry piers, but weighing 540, ooo pounds each. 1-Iere were two ung-ainly masses of metal more than a city block long and as high as a three-story house which were to be inter- changed in tnidair without mishap and without interrupting the schedule of an important rail- road. The 1nethods adopted by the contractor were· rei:narkably · shnple. He built the riew· IF YO'UR \VORK IS DONE .BY~ AMERICAN LAUNDRY You'll I.Je Plcasc<.l Witll.

On these barges were erected sn1all towers, so that at the proper time, on a rising tide, the barges would lift the new span frorn its seat and carry it safely away on the two towers. At the same time the contractor placed bar- ges underneath the old span ; but since this span was of itself not sufficiently strong to be supported on only two towers he had to build a supple1nentary wooden bridge across these boats so as to support the old span throughout its ·whole length. 1.,hese barges were then partly sunk under the old span. \Vhen all was in readiness for the transfer large pntnps were started to raise the sun ken boats, and as they rose in the water the old span was lifted from its place and tovved away. The new span, which had been f1oa tec.l some days before, was then quickly swung into posi- tion. Valves in the boats supporting this span were opened, and as the scows becan1e sub- ,merged the span sank slowly and carefuHy to its place on the old foundation piers. The rapidity with which these operations were carried on was marvelous. Five of these .. spans were built on shore, ... floated into place and set into position. for the passage of trains at the rate of nine d~ys each under unfa vor- ab1e ,conditions of weather.

THE CONCORDIENSIS L t-' . ;;.,.-·.. L . ..--\' VoL. XXv 7 II. UNION COL~EGE, OCTOBER 21, 1903. No.4. I-IAMIL TON, 28: UNION, o. A mighty hard gan1e for Union tnen to wit- ness, it was allnost a repetition of last year's defeat at the h::tnds of the san1e t~atn. But it all happened on our own gridiron this time, a fact which doesn't help us to forget it any soon- er. About a hundred IIatnilton n1en catne down to see their team win, and apparently they were satisfied. They yelled, they sang, they para- ded until it vvas all Hamilton around the catnp- us and the color of theit: players' jerseys was a true reflection of our our o\':n state of feelings. As far as cheering goes, the Union n1en-al- un1ni and undergraduates--watched the game with an interest that was pathetic and hikahed, rahed, and whiskey-wowed their strongest when there was nothing even to hope for. The tean1s. as they lined up for the first kick-off, appeared about as evenly tnatched as one could desire, but appearances proved de- cetvtng. \Ve lacked something which Han1il- ton had, so the score was on our debit side. Our fellows played their best, but it wasn't sufficient. A tnore or less steady rain kept up during the struggle but the crowd rernained through it all till dark. 1\'he field was slippery and wet which per~ haps accounts for the fatal fumbles of sotne of our men. Harnilton 's backs played particu- larly strong, especially Roosa. The following is as it looked frotn the side- lines: FIRST HALF. Patton kicked-off from the north goal to Branley who advanced the ball 5 yards. Ham- ilton failed to gain around the ends and Union held for downs. This was the best part of the whole game. In return Hatnilton held for downs on their 20 yd line. Hamil ton's backs now advanced the ball !IS yds in three separate plays. Soper and Roosa were each tackled for a loss on the next two plays but this was eqaal- izecl by Union being penalized for holdiqg. Ham:ilton now took the baU without serious interruption through our tackles, guards, eHds, n1ost any place for sn1all gain.s. which resu1ted in the ball being placed within 3 yds of Union's goal. Union held for two downs but on t1le third, Hatnilton tnade the touchdown. After kicking the ball out, an east goal was kicked. Score, 6-o. HamiltoD kicked off to Conway who brought ball back ro yds. Patton advanced 5 yds, Raymond fumbled but regained the baH. ISt down. Oln1steacl advanced 8 yds. l'Iar- vey passed ball to Reeder which resulted in a loss. Patton failed to punt and it was Hamil- ton's ball. 1\'he next few motnents were mark- ed by I-Iamilton's steady and decisive gains, checked only by frequent discussions of play- ers of which Bingha1n, the un1pire, figured largely as the cause. Harnilton soon went over the line for another touchdown. No g()al. Score, I r-o. Hamilton kicked off and Rayn1ond brought ball back 5 yc.ls. Tredick gained 5 ycls, but Patton lost ball to Hamilton on fu1nble. Ham- ilton gains 4 yds and is penalized for holding. On third down, I-Iatnilton punts. Patton drops the punt and }Ian1ilton bas the ball. A few agonizing moments and I-Ia1nilton scores agatn. An easy goal is kicked. Score, 17-o. Union kicked Qff. I-Ia1ni I ton advanced kick- o~f r 5 yds. F~iling to gain because of Reed- er's good work, Hamilton punts. Patton ran punt back 5 yds, but fails to punt well in ex- change. }latnilton in two plays gained 15 yd~ around the ends, but was penalized, and \ punts. Tredick punts in rettn-n with good ef- fect and Reeder tackles runner without a gain ..

Shuttleworth was put in Lent's place at left guard and Olm- stead punted to Hamilton's 40 yard line. I-Iam ilton fumbled twice but retained the ball. IC!uge was substituted for Conway at guard.

Union kicked off to I-Iamilton and a I-Iamil- ton man, securing the ball ran the length of the field for a touchdown. It was discovered later, however, that he had run out of bounds.

GLOBE HOTEL, ALBANY.-.Adv. THE BIRDS OF THE CAMPUS. The College grounds present an unusuaUy fine opportunity for observing birds. The garden at some seasons of the year is a bird 's paradise ; and at all seasons they are to be .found there. T'he woods above the garden af- ford a haunt for the pine-loving birds. The pasture and other fields have their quota. Even the buildings themselves are chosen for the nesting sites of several species. The following interesting Tist was compiled chiefly by ~~Irs. E. E. Hale, Jr., and Prof. J. L. ~{arch, two close observers of birds, whose observation extends over several years. Ruffed Grouse. A pair of Patridges win- tered in the garden for several years. 1\1ourning Dove. Occasional visitant. Screech Owl. So1netimes heard on the grounds. Yellow-billed Cuckoo. Black-billed Cuckoo.

This list contains eighty-three species and it is by no means complete There are many birds that can be seen just off the grounds that must come into them occasionally. Any additional records will be welcomed. I think that with a few years' observation we could have a list of birds seen here that could be duplicated by few if any colleges in the coun_ try. The Hudson River is a grand highway of migration and the Mohawk leads the way by us. 1,hus in Spring and Fall, the Garden and grounds are flooded with birds-the most beautiful creation Nature has yet made. J. R. Nowell, 'os. COLLEGE MEETING. October 19th. The meeting was called to order by Presi- dent Mulleneaux. Mr. Stiles announced rehearsals of the Glee and Musical clubs and also that the registra- tion for Asst. Manager of the Glee Club would close on Wednesday. Mr. Fiero announced the election of an as- ~istant track manager on Nov. 2nq~ i Mr. Cool asked about the money coHected for Mr. Cronkhite's outfit. Mr. Guardenier suggested that the same be placed in the bank and used for the baseball season. Motion to that effect was made , seconded and carried. Mr. Guard:-enier spoke on the Amherst game and the arrangements made to attend the same. A rising vo~e to find out the number of men who would go '· was called for and about Ioo responded. After the minutes were read the tneeting stood adjourned. THE CAMPUS MEETIN~G Last Friday evening, college spirit ran high. At Chapel Friday, a campus n1eeting was an- nounc.ed by Captain Olmstead, and nearly the whole student body responded to the call. The Freshmen as is the custon1 collected a large quantity of inflammable material and a huge fire added tn uch to the pleasure as well as to the warmth of the occasion. A band of ·wandering 1nusicians favored the gathering with several popular selections. After mak- ing the campus ring with the songs and cheers of old Union, the students repaired to the bleachers and speeches were in order. Prof. Bennett addressed the student body in an ~loquent speech overflowing with wit. He impressed upon his audience the necessity for every Union man to have confidence in his team.

GLOBE H·OTEL, ALBANY.-Actv. MA TRJCULA TION BY TABASCO SAUCE Or becoming a thorough collegian by the lily pond route are not essential for a Freshman. Yet if you are of the elect,. especially chosen from your number to add zest and flavor to your commencement week, accept the honor modestly and do not parade your triumph. While it is certainly kind of an upper classman to give attention to a Freshman they ask no greater 1hanks than to have their generous deed let go unsung. They know in their hearts that they have done w·ell and need no further ratification--nor even faculty mention. In the old days it was obligatory with all Freshn1en to enter college tna turi ty as effusive- ly as originality could contrive. l'h ose were often bloody days, in the dark ages of student thought, before the vivid college yell gave its chord of culture to the educational life of Atnerica. Some egress had to be found for the rich, red blood of the buoyant natives. College loyalty then rested on a man's ability to overturn a street car, or to pasture a cow in a dormitory belfry, or to blindfold a timid novice in a room full of boy-eaters and tobacco smoke. But with the introduction of culture into the American colleges there has been a variation in the pleasantries. Cayenne pepper has lost its popularity and is no longer on the n1atricu- lation bill of fare. The light horse, car has been superceded by the thirty ton electric coach, and then, too, culture has corne--a keen culture with a sense of humor. The palate is no longer the test .of an intranes ca- pability to stay ,with us ; nor are his muscles called upon to demonstrate that he can inter- fere with street rail way traffic successfully. The brain's the thing nowadays. Mentality is king--but not, necessarily, faculty know- ledge. Be brave and cheerful, my Freshie, and take what com,es, and feel honor(!d by it. Think, THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 in a year you will be the most unfortunate and blase of all creatures within the gates, a fas- tidious, supercilious, super-structured, super- Sophomore. They are those who are, '' Prouder than Aragon, Wiser than somebody in the Decarneron,\ and who amuse almost everybody, even ·each other, but never themselves. The bJ1ase are never amused. There are a few tough weeks before you Freshn1en, but be alive to your friends and generous to your enemies, and study o~casion­ ally and all may yet be well. Accept college traditions as you find them, and remember that if they are not meant for your good, they ar~ intended for the amusement of your fellows-- and while you are being tested invent improve- ments in the system which you can practice on the class of Igo8.--Exchange.

Politics and There is nothing so harmful to true .College Spirit. manly college spirit as college politics. There have been many attempts here at Union to purify politics. Such movements were, at times, sirtcere and then again, merely a means whereby the authors might rise in the favor of tl1eir fellow stu- dents or of the faculty. Nothing definite has ever been done to check or put a stop to this systematic form of ''grafting.''' A man may 'enter college naturally gifted with smootl~ ways and a gHb tongue and that man will before he graduates, have obtained perhaps marty class or college offices without evincing the least fitness or capability for the same. l-Ie will, perhaps, worm his way into a managership and thenceforth, the men whom he appoints or controls are most likely to be his intimate friends. IIe does not care for the welfare of the college but he does like to pose as one who can exercise more or less power and one, in whose good graces all students should stand. l-Ie is usually popular. Y,es., with that class who cannot see through his tricks, or with those men . to whom he has shown partiality. The goal of the college politician is selfishness pure and simple .; personal interest ad nauseam. There is not a student at Union who does not know that this state of affairs exists and yet they say nothing and seem to care less. It is not the pinnacle of the politician which makes us speak, it is the rare un· fairness of such a self-complacent, conceited fool's course. He works day and night to gain an office by bribing, stealing, cheating-anything-he does not care how little he is or how unfit or how unworthy-only to gain the influence whereby he may give away offices to his perhaps, equally unqualified friends and have the opportunity of backbitiag his enemies. Such a course may be allowable in the outside world wl1ere great is· sues are at stake and wl1ere party strife is bitter. Al· lowable or not, it will be acknowledged that it 1s ille· gal and degrading. nut here, where we should all be drawn together by the common cause of our Alma :Mater, where petty selfishness should be put down in the interest of our college, this rankling growth of poli· tics would choke all the true spirit which a student would otherwise have. It is nothing short of disgustc ing to see the way that fairness is tampered with here at Union. \Vho cares to associate with those men whom we know are exalted to positions solely by the abasement of their class or colle·ge mates who are, in most cases, far worthier. And yet, we are told, if we do not \ tag on'' to these low-mouthed brawlers, these many sided weaklings, &I You have no college spirit.\ If it lies in that direction, may every true son of old Union steer clear of it ! ...

The Goodfellow may be met with in all tfue spheres . of life but nowhere perhaps is contact with him so ob· jectionable as in coHege. He may be briefly described as a fool and a parasite. A fool because the fature means, it can mean, nothing to him, and .a parasite be· cause he lives on his surroundings and preys on what is not his own. This thing, for such we may ·call any material object, never thinks or acts for ;itself ; it seeks popularity for the sake of popularity; it generally agrees with all JOU say, and \ Curry Favor ,, is the motto on its arms. No truer words were ever said than '' l-Ie makes no friend who never made a foe.'' The Goodfellow fears enmity. Not that its nature is pacific but because it dreads the idea of not standing well in the light of the morals of every man be he saint or sinner. It is an ob- noxious growth, some weed in the garden of learning whose usefulness men have not as yet been able to dis· cover. In its essence, the thing is monstrous and nauseating. The Goodfellow is always a sissy and by that we mean the object which self-respecting men most despise. It is like some mushroom !?:rowth, often attractive to look at but whose being breathes fatality to all who approach it. It is a leper of mind and heart, a tt~mor which would in· trude on the son] of friendship. This being, for it is possible he has a life, is present at Union and this fatted worm would pollute the sacredness of con1panionship Beware of this fool and parasite ! 1: he Birds of The Editors take special pleasure in the Campus. publishing in this issue an article on ''The Birds of the Campus,\ by J.

Maier of the Union Presbyterian church addressed the students. He drew an interesting analogy b_etween the two Bi~le texts, \To him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken aw;ay, even that w.hich he hath,\ ~nd '' Tb~ Righteous shall inherit the earth '' and the Law of the Survival of the Fittest. :October 17th, 1903, Ex-Senator G. G. Vest of Missouri, has a very interesting article en- titled ''A Senator ·of Two :Republics.'' He reminiseeson Toombs of Georgia, Yancey of Alabama and Wigfall of Texas, aU statesm.en of marked ability and great influence. Of Robert Toombs he says in part : ''General Robert Toombs entered the army at the beginning of the war as a Brigadier- ·General and remained in the military service until the close of hostilities. He was, how- ever, a member of the Provisional Congress from February 4, 1861, to February 17, 1862. He and Mr Davis were colleagues in_ the United States Senate when the Southern States seceded, but were political antagonists upon every political question except that of slavery. Toombs was a whig and Davis a disciple of John C. Calhoun, but both were extremists on the slavery question. When Sumner threat- ened that slavery should be surrounded by a cordon of free States so that, likea viper en- circled by fire, it should sting itself to death, Toombs responded that the time would come when he could call.the roll of his slaves at the foot of Bunker Hill Monument. General Toombs was called the Mirabeau of the South, and in many respects resembled the great Frenchman. l-Ie had a strong in- tellect, violent passions and great courage. He was very ambitious, and the fact that Mr. Davis defeated hitn for the Presidency of the Confederate States in the Provisional Con- gress at Montgomery was thought by many to be the cause of his persistent opposition to the policy adopted by Mr. Davis in conducting the war. In the book published by President Davis after the fall of the confederacy the statement is made that he was unanimously chosen by the Provisional Congress to the Presidency of the Confederate States, but as a matter of fact Toombs received five votes and Davis received six,. each. one of the eleven Stat< tng c '7~ read histc mee· whi< cern, crat tad) / ~~-,~ the 3rd in t ber . tng stn Yo1 Syr I.

GLOBE HOTEL. ALBANY.-Aav. 15 BO·OKMEN, SCHENECTADY AND SA.RATOCA\ DEAN F'IERO'S NEW BOOK. J. Newton Fiero, Dean of the Albany Law School, has just published a new treatise on ''Torts.\ While the author does not express his views on the weight of authority, the decisions are so noted and arranged as to give prominence to those which are leading and controlling, while the fact that cases have been cited, fol- lowed or overruled is indicated where an in1- portant principle is involved. Aside from its general excellence and adapt- ability to the wants of the practising lawyer, tnay be noted. First-. The method of citation of authorities. While the ·work is primarily useful as a state- ment of the Law of New York, it has value in other jurisdictions because citations are freely made from the text-writers on the different topics, credit always being given to authors. These citations are followed by references to the English Reports, and to cases in the Fed- eral courts. Decisions in point in other States are given, followed by the leading authorities in New York. 'rhe decisions bearing on less important points and by way of illustration complete the consideration of the topic. This gives the practitioner the benefit of a very wide range of authorities. Second--1.,he con1bination of Law and Prac- tice in Part II of the work, relating to Torts, gives to the work an eminently practical char- acter. Following the Substantive Law relat- ing to each topic under Injuries to the Person is a full citation of authorities relating to practice, discussing questions as to Parties, Pleading, Evidence, Trial and Rule of Dama- ges, so that from the discussion of the General Principles of Torts in Part I and the rules of IF YOUR \VORK IS DONB BY~ AMERICAN LAUNDRY \'VVJ\d:.

Last Wednesday afternoon Union's football players took a decided brace over their playing of last S~turday,. and held Amherst to only I6 points, and all these were made -in the :first half. Amherst tried her best to score in the second half, but was unable to do so. Union played on the defensive all through the game. and when they got the baH generally punted, Amherst made gains almost every time they hit the center. · Ho·wever, when they tried end runs they were nearly always held for no gains. It is very doubtful if Amherst would have run up the score that she did if three of the Union men had not been out of the game on account of injuries. This is a very small score consid- ering that Amher~t ~eat Harvard 5 to o and held Columbia to I 2 points. The game was a very clean one, and there was practically no dirty playing. Every man on the hill is highly jubilant as they expected that Amherst would run up a large score. FIRST HALF. Amherst kicked off to Union and KJuge ob- tained the ball on the 40 yard line and ad- vanced it about five yards. 1:-Iere Union lost the ball on a fumble. Amherst by steady line plunges forced the ball over the line for the first touchdown, and kicked the goal. Union kicked off to Atnherst, who lost the ball on a futnble. Union was unable to tnake her yards and was obliged to punt. Atnherst forced her way over the line for the second touchdown by repeated line plunges, but did not kick the goal. Union kicked off to A.mherst. Amherst was obliged to punt and Union punted back again, but had to over again on account of off- side playing. Amherst then forced the ball over the line for another touchdown. The goal was not kicked. Union had just kicked off to Amherst when tin1e was called .. SECOND HALF. Union kicked off to Amherst who lost the ball <?11 a fun1ble on their five yard line. Cook tried to drop a kick goal but failed, but got a touch back. An1herst then pun ted from their 20 yard line and Union punted back. Am herst forced th~ ball to Union's r5 yard line where she lost it on a fumble. Union punted to their so yard line. Then An1herst forced the ball to Union's IS yard line. vVhen Am herst was penalized 20 yards for holding, Union obtained the ball on downs and tried to punt but the kick was blocked and: Atnherst obtained the ball on Union's 10 yard line. At this point time was called, without Amherst having made a single touchdown in the second half. The line-up: Amherst Union Beherends ..•..• ~ ....•.......•..••••••.•..•..•....•..•.••..•.....

On the r 7th the Garnet wearers were de• feated by ·Hamilton affer an exceptionally long and hard fought garne. With a partially crippled team, Union tnet Amherst on the 2.tst. 'The team, although in poor con- dition from the loss of three Varsity men, made a remark- ably good showing against the liarvard conquerors. The U n:ion management considered the question .from aU points of view and came to the decision that it would be impos .. sible to send a team to Ithaca which would fairly represent Union. Union regrets that there has been any Eeeling over the matter. A Mistake. It used to be customary at Union for aU students to speak when they pass each other. It is a mistake for the freshmen to think that they need a formal introduction to every man in cqHege before they may in all propriety greet their fellow students, VIe are, as it were, brothers ia the house of our Alma Mater and our numbers are not so great as to warrant any disre- gard of the usual courtesies. The New Instructors. The editors regret that until this time no pointed words of greeting have been extended to the new instructors at Union, thro' the columns of the '' Concordiensis, '' Their position in the matter may, however, be explained by a word. An article appears in this issue on '' The New Instructors'' and it seemed more fitting to re- serve the editorial welcome until now, so that the two mentions could be brought out in the same issue. Ia behalf of the student body we greet you and sincerely trust that your years on the faculty may be long .and happy and that your efforts may be crowned with that success which is always the reward of earnestness.

GLOBE HOTEL, ALBANY.-Adv. · herst couldti't score in the last half. It is not so often that anything like this happens in any game. It is hard, for a losing team to for· .get, as it were, the score, and play as if it were the winner. And when it does. we may count on that team having a great deal better stuff than that of which dreams are made. We were outplayed and outclassed, but we .showed our teeth. Once, on Amher-st's five yard line,. we actually growled. Next Saturday, wlth t~e same courage and spirit, let's bite. H.amilton 's Attitude. Q. E. D., 'o5 From the issue of the H am.U ton Life for October 24, we make the follow- ing excerpt: ''During the Union game of last Saturday there were many happenings and occurrences which are not al· lowed under this year's edit·ion of the footbalil rules. The principal fouls were slugging and unnecessary de- lay of the game. \Vhen the umpire attempted to penalize the offending team he was threatened with forcible expulsion from the field. That such actions should be allowed on a college football field shows poor management to say the least. No doubt the Union men desired to be gentlemanly and sportsman· like in every detail, bnt the excitement proved too much for their self-control and better natures. They did not play a clean game and also greatly stretched the re- straint placed upon Hamilton's players. But thanks to their good bringing up, our team acted the gentleman always and gave its supporters, together with its op- ponents, no chance to cry ' dirty.' '' T~at Hamilton should take such an attitude towards Union is to be regretted ; but that Hamilton should seek to preach '' gentlemanly conduct and sportsmanlike spirit'' to Union is rather inconsistent with their bear- ing. The game referred to was full of disputed de· . .cis ions, . unfort.unately, and fairer umpires have, ~t times, been . seen on the campu~, bt1t is that any reason why,: after all the hopes and wishes of the best men in both. colleges seemed realized, the organ of Hamilton . should take upon itself to open the wound of three year~ ago? ~hose ~ho say that Hamilton was not treated justly are . n1erely looking for a new break between tl1e colleges. Union- desires to maintain cordial relatiol)s with the THE CONCORDIENSIS . . 11 college at Clinton and can:not understand why, if a sitnUar feeling exists at HamHton, why the ''Life \ should publish such unfair, one-sided and dlscourteous remarks on the recent game. FOOT·BALL SONG. lt is suggested that every man in college commit the wot:ds of this song in order tha.t it may be sung at Satur· day's game, Tune '' Marching through Georgia.'' Old Union's men are right in line and readyto begi~, Tier football team is strong and fast and fuU of dash and vim, .And with Smi:th-ie as our coach, we know we'll surely win, And raise the white and garnet standard high. Chorus. Hurrah! Hurrah! Old Union is in line! Hurrah! Hurrah! For the white and garnet sign. We can buck the line and ski-rt the ends, our quarter tackles fine, \Vhile we are playing for Union. Our center is a hummer and our backs are good ones too; Our guards are strong and honest and they make a hole straight through \Vith two strong men at tackle we will make you feel quite blue · And our ends-they wHl do you up for ever. Hurrah! Hurrah! Old Union is in line! Hurrah! Hurrah! For the white and garnet sign. We can buck the line and skirt the ends, our quarter tackles fine, \Vhile we are playing for Union. F. G. TAYLOR.

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS.· '\.. '52- The- Rev. James Franklin Taylor died at his home at Douglas, Mich. on October 1st of this ~ear. He was born near Penn Yan, N. Y., November 4, 1824 and graduated from Union with the class of ,.52. He was also a graduate of the Princeton and New Haven Theological :Serninaries. His last visit to his Alma Mater was paid at the semi-centennial reunion of his class in June, 1902. '51-- The following is frorn the Charleston, S, C. News and Courier. Of Dr. Chades S. Vedder and his trip ab~oad this summer, that paper remarks: \The services were resun1ed yesterday at the Hugenot church. The discourse of the pastor oQly contained such allusions to his summer trip abroad as related to religious matters, in connection with his own and other churches. He had visited the great Cathedral of Canter- bury, England. Dr. Vedder had opportunity to convey the greetings of the Hu.genot church of Charleston to the sister church in England, and to express, in an address to a large assem- blage of tourists, thanks to the great English church for .its welcotne and long hospitality to the Hugenot exiles. In the cathedral, and\ . ' Dr. Vedder also visited St. John's hospital, from which William Enston received the in:- spiration which issued in the Wil'liam Enston Home of Charleston. In Holland, the H ugenot pastor stood at D·elft, on the stairway where William the Si- lent, the Washington of the Netherlands, and who 'left as a widow the daughter of Coligni., was assassinated, and in the room where he died.

Dr. Vedder visited Dort, at whose great synod the pastors of the French Re- formed and Dutch Reformed churchessigned each other's creeds and catechisms. At Ley- den the Hugenot pastor saw the inscription which American Congregationalists have placed on the church where, or near which, the Ply- mouth pilgrims worshipped, and visited the hon1e in which the famous John Robinson lived and died. These and like things of Dr. Vedder's experience were listened to \vith much interest, although they were only intro- ductory to his formal discourse. l-Ie was warmly welcomed home.'' very near to the tomb of Edward, the Black \. \ Prince, is the sarcophagus of the brother of .,..s.

Owing to the widespread interest regarding the imperiled American Christian colleges for young men in Turkey, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions is about to issue a report on the subject, translated from the 'furkish. It comes from Aintab, central Turkey, and contains the following: These col] eges, according to the order of their dates of establishment, are : Robert Col- lege at Constantinople, Syrian Protestant Col~ lege at Beirut, Central Turkey College at Ain- tab, Euphrates College at Harpoot, Anatolia College at Marsovan and St. Paul's Institute IF YOUR WORI( IS DONE .BY~ - ;. :AMERICAN .. 'LAUNDRY . ! \V\T:M:. :a:_ P. YULE.~ PrQprietor, 220 NOTT TERRACE, Phone 260F. at 1,arsus. Beirut College, in the growth of its courses of study, .variety of branches, ac .. commodation of its buildings and completeness of its equipments and apparatus, has . been ·making very rapid progress, so that the value Of its present property is· not les'S than 100,090 liras, nearly $4oo, ooo. The number of · i~s teachers in various branches is n1ore than for- ty, ten of whom are professors. · There are· now 1,489 students in the colleges, 771 of whom are Armenians. · · · There is one point in which none of. th~ others can be compared with H.obert Coll~g~. The latter holds the greatest number of t~:~ . ' ' . ~ . officers in governmental depart~ents_. It is able to show among its graduat~s Lieutenants, Generals, Commanders, J t:tdges, Mayors, Gov- ernors, Embassadors, and even Cabinet Mem-. bers and Prime Niinisters, and these are not merely some exceptions, but riearly one-foqrth of its graduates have attained one or the other of these high positions. This superiority may be ascribed partly to its high standard of edu- cation, and largely to its itnportant geographi- cal situation in the central point between Asia and Europe. Many famous Armenian profes- ·sors.in Constantino.pJe~ at:s·6~. well known mer- chan,ts, physicians .and' edit:brs, are graduates of Robert College.· _Th~ Euphrates College .# ... f has suffered mo~t f,ro-~ th.~ ·?~~~Hrl?ances. 'f:he tendency in its vicinity·· to leave the country has been so strong that, besides the number.· of the students being diminished, many hopeful graduates and even teachers of the college have left the country for fQreign lands.
