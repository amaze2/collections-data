No. 12 AT PANAMA A Vi:vid Sl\:eteb of Fi:rst lnipressions. Below we print a lettrer written by F. H. Poweil, '0 3, who \Vent to Panama last spri:r1g, since when he has engaged on the canal staff on the isthmus. His whimsical sketch of conditions there ·will well repay 1·eading. My Dear Editor: Your invitation to me to break into print \Yith rny im.pressions of life on the Zone is so diptoma tically \YOrded that I cannot find it in my heart to spare you. You m.ust. how- ever, bear in n1ind that nearly a year·~ res: dence \Vill have changed irnpression~ into habits, ard the writing of such a letter as you f'Uggested will be so 1nuch the ~nore difficult. A phrase in your letter-\constructive critic- isin\-leads me to rise to Inake a few rernarks. The construction so far S<:'en1s to have been in greater part built upon criticism. If the \\YOrk on the canal results in as much dirt being dug in the future, as there ha~ been mud flung up to date, you people in God's country wHl soon be the proud possessors of a ship. canal. I have never been able to cmnprehend ·why the \.Vork here should he involved in as deep mystery as the con- flicting reports from the States \VOUld indicate. I will disarm possible criticism in advance by ad- mitting that I know that rny opinion is worth no more than that of the various correspondents who spend a week do\Yl1. here and then tell you people all about ;t, yet it see1ns cornparatively. an easy task to sum up the canal situation. Given a great public work partly under ·way, whose local~ js in a land hjtherto notorious for its deadly climate, and which is re-attempted before ade- quate preparations for carryjng on that \-VOrk had been made-and there you are. Uncle Sam started for the Isthmus armed with a steam shovel or two, a few quinine tablets, several typewriters, and accompanied by the in- junction to \Dig Dirt.\ On arrival at Colon, he found nothing to eat, no place to sleep and a large number of mosquitos and fleas. (The mosquitos are on the wane, but the flea does not observe union hours.) For the past few months our Uncle has devoted himself to building houses, getting a line on something more strength- ful' than plantains and bananas for his work- Inen, and driving away yellow fever. I can re- Inember very clisLnctly that during the fever scare of last .. April and May, a goo~lly nu.mht>l' of us thoU';?;ht that it was better to have sa:d of us \There hP gee~~\ th:J.n \DoN:;n't h(.' look natural.\ and took the boat for little old ~ew York. 8on1e Df us stayed, not being entir('ly convinc~'d that \Hits no disgrace tuh run ef you are scahe:1\- but we were all scared, and \Ye all adm<it it now. Therefore it is but natural that ·whoever else we 1nay knock, in the privacy of our \sTuare fO''t'• rooms, we \vill always take off our hats to ColnnPI Gorgas. It is no small thing to have restored confidence in our chances of seeing the Statute cf Liberty again, and now most of us are looking forward to it with only such eagernf' ss a:.:; goes with the anticipation of the first civil:zed meal in 1nonths, and our anticipation is heightened by the sight of the increased avoirdupois of those who have already been \home.\ While I am on this: subject of diet, so dear to the masculine heart, I will add that the t\.vo staple articles of diet down here are india-rubber beef and celluloid fried eggs. Further com1nent is obviously unnecessary. As to Panama, I suppose that three things would first impress a newcomer here, (and those are the impressions I am supposed to be giving) though rather shopworn now, we will say, climate, people and manners. The newcomer would be rather surprised to find so great a difference be- t\.veen the heat of the midday and the cool of the evening and night. If he arrived in the busy time of the rainy season he would wonder how the air could get out of the way fast enough to let

By that tin1.e ll.e \Vould have lean1ed to set his earthly poss.ess.ions out in the sunlight at least once a week. After a few months n1.ore he would g.ive up worrying as to what the people were going to do when co:ld weather set in in the late fall, for he would gradu- ally get used to living in a land, where unlike Central New York, not more than 'steen varieties of weather are served in twenty-four hours. During this time he would ]!)ro bably have dis- covered that there are three dasses ·which com- prise the population, the \caballeros\ who are too strong to work-unless they can \vork their own or our government; the storekeepers, who seem to be the descendants of the pirates who once rav- aged Panama; and the \Hombres who work once in a while. Add to these 1 the hackdrivers, of whom I cannot trust myself to express an opin- in in print, a large number of Chinese, several hundred miniature policemen, a couple 1nillion dogs more or less, nearly all the aforesaid equiped \v-ith a full quota of fleas-what more would you ask? The customs of the people-this is the Ino:::;t difficult subject on ·which to write, for they ha Ye lost their novelty nO\Y, and I fe.ar that I cannot do justice to so interesting a task. Howeyer, supposing that the guileless ne·w arrival starts out J.n the morning to buy a pair of shoeB. On leay- 1ng his room he goes down stail·s, for the better ·cla~s lives on the second floor, and out on the sidewalk: this· he finds to be about three feet wide, and from a foot to three feet above the level of the street. Along the \Yhole block the seconrl story balcony extends out and over the sidf'- walk, a feature of Panama architecture that he much appreciates when the rainy season starts. With a hazy idea of the direction that he wishes to take, he sets out, with his eyes on the sidewalk to avoid ·risking his neck, and meets a Pana- mani.an, and as usual at home, our \Americana\ turns to the right; he goes on a block and crosses the street. He meets another \caballero'' ann. naturally he again turns to the righ. t, this time with the wall at his right, and 'he finds that the Panamanian also in tends to keep the wall next to him; they politely dodge each other for a few rninutes, an-d finany extricate themselves. The new arrival .goes on a little farther, me~ts this time an ''hombre\ and politely tries to yield the wall; this act flies in the face. of an the con- ventions that the humble \hombre\ ever learned, and he insists upon the new arrival passing be- tween him and the wall. By the time that the American has learned that between equals it is the custom to try to yield the wall to the custom to try to yield the wall to the other, and that the \hombres\ expect to make C1e outside of the walk, he has lost his way and is probably back at his starting point. Finally 'he gets to the \Com- Inercial Emporium\ and looks at sorne antique, misshapen articles which the clerk assserts are shoes, but which would seem t0 have been models for some new departure in naval architecture. Shoes being necessary, even : n Panama, 'he in- quires and pays the price, as ·would be customary at home. Afetr various exper:ences of this kind, our \easy mark'' learns that it is contrary to all business etiquette to pay the first price asked-and . then one sees why \shirt-sleeve diplomacy\ caused so great a furore in lTiuropean chancelleries-the Latin mind cannot comprehend why one wants \\vhat they ask for without the accompainment of a set speech on each side. It was my privilege to watch, for a short time, a so called bull fight. A bull fight! A self-respect- ing muley cow ·would hang h0r head in shame at the sight. Amid the paucl:ts of the yelling Panamanians and the blare of the Garde Repub- licaine band the picadors, the matador-and the bull-appear. A couple of lion--hearted picadors plunge a couple of darts into the back of the bull's neck-when he isn't looking. Taurus looks around meekly and the \rnain squeeze\-the matador-shakes the proverbial red rag in his view-the bull makes a wild plunge at him-and then start;:;:; off at a lope to look for the \Vay hmne -I am vc>ry sorroy that I cannot give the sequet I felt that the excitement was too great and I

It was with genuine reg~ret that the educational world learned of the death of William R2tinEy Harper, President of the University of Chicago, whi-ch occured Wednesday. Death came as a result of a cancer which had been fought with every means known to science, but which was seen some time ago to be fatal. Since February, Dr. Harper had been \vorking \without ·ceasing, to straighten up the affairs of his big university, bravely facing the e·nd which he knew to be in- evitable. He kept in touch with the university till the last. Dr. Harper was renowned as a scholar. He ·was given degrees by Yale, Johns Hopkins and other· universities. He acquired his greatest fame as a specialist in theHebrew language, on whiQh subject he was regarded as one of the leading men of the country. But he made his mark chiefly as a business executive, a type so common in the colleges of today.

UNIOiV COLLE~GE, Jrl1V. 20, 1906. .Yo. 13 Adverse Vote in C'oUege 1\Ieeting Football, as at present p:layed, received Hs death blow as far as Union is concerned, in col- lege meeting last M!onday morning. Action of this sort has been u.nder consideration since early in December when the Athletic Board expressed its views on the question. but it was felt at that time by the student body that any de·finite action must come only as the result of careful consid- eration and accordingly a vote was delayed. At a meeting of the Athletic Board, held Wed- nesday, Dec. 6, a resolution \.Vas passed declaring it to be the sense of the Board that football, aH at present played, should no longer occupy a place :n athletics at Union. The Foard also recnm- Inended that the student body take action. to and H. G. Davis moved that football, as at pres- ent played, be abolished. MotiOTl to lay on the table being lost, the form,er motion, on rising vote, was carried by eonsiderable majority. At a meeting of the Athletic Board Wednesday evening it was definitely voted to abolish football for :next year, no matter \Vhat change may he 1nade in the game, as is n-oted in another part. UNION UNIVERSITY CLUB X C'\.Y Association Foi'lllt'd in X C\V Yori{ As indicating the present tendency of onr uni- vel·sHy to d~ aw its different depaetn1.ents closer to- gether, there comes from. Xew York City the good \ ne\YS of the formation there of a 'Cnion University Club, to include men f1·on1 all of the four de- abolish the game. In accordance with these partments. Sorne of L'nion's most prominent resolutions, Haig.ht, '0·6, secretary of the Athletic Board, reported the action in college meeting on the following Monday. As has been said, noth- alu1nni of Xew York are interested in it and it is already an assured success. Its perrnanent or- ganization has not, as yet, been entirely com- ing was done at that time. The New York con- pleted. ferences \Vere approaching and the whole college world was waiting to see what action would be taken there. The feeling \vas expressed that we ,,·ould lose nothing by waiting and that, in fact, it would be far better to commit ourselves to no definite line of action while the football question was so unsettled. Little of any value ·has been accomplis'hed by the football conference except the amalgamation of the old and new rules committees. The fate of football rests with the members of this new coln-- mittee. The general feeling is that some radical change will be made. If it is not changed, many of the colleges of the country will drop it. ThiR, all along, has been the feeling here at Union. Thinking that sufficient time had been given to the fello\vs to consider their line of action, Mr. Haight, in M1onday's college meeting, again brought up the Athletic Board's recommendation Its purposes are \the establishrnent of a per- manent club house in )\ew York City, the main- tenance of a library for rnembers and to secure such Union University 1nen1orabilia as may from tirne to time be obtainable.\ T1venty-five per cent of all receipts are to be applied to a perman- ent building fund until the sum of $50.000 shall have been reached. Jo'hn A. Cutter, rnedic '86. has been elected president and Sam.uel Marsh, College, '6 7, is acting secretary. The first man to be elected to 'honorary mem- bership is Dr. William \~Tells ( \Cnclc- Billy\) Pro- fessor Emeritus of Modern Languages. This elec- tion \Vas Dece1nber 22. Silas B.

On Thursday evening the Junior class will hold Hs third hop in Yate~· Poat House or Red lVI.an's Hall. rrh~ Sophomore Soirl'e will occur the following evening in th€\ Ten Ey:·k, Al- bany. Satui·:Jay even!ng will b<:' de-voted to '.·al'ious fonn~ of entertainn1.c>nt by the several frat('rn.it:es giving house parties. It is highly probab:e that the Allison-Foote debate and the conce1't by th<:' musical clubs will take place on the afternoon of Friday and Saturday. Due to the energetic efforts of the committees concerned ev·erything seems to point to1vard a season of 1nost enjoyable gayety. The tickets for the Junior Hop will be two dol- lars, more than usual, but it is expected by the con1.mittee to improve upon the average Junior Hop. The price of the Soiree tickets, which have been on sale for a ·week past, are to be four dol- lars, ·which is also an advance over previou~ years. But in this connection, considei~ation must be ·nad for the fact that the dance this year is a great deal more expensive than before. flpecial cars will doubtless be provided to carry the dancE'rs to Albany and return, by trolley. The rnusic will he furnished by Zita's full m·ch(:'8tra of fourtc,en pieces. All in all, the dance prornises to be the rnost successful soiree held in some time.

C. Mon~hiy, ATHLETIC BOARD Football is Aholished An important rneeting of the Athletic Board was held Wednesday evening at which the under- graduates' action of Monday 1vas intensified and football was ·wiped off Union's athletic slate for next fall at least. This action was taken to put Union definitely on record as being opposed to the game and })robably, 'With the feeling that the resolution passe-l Monday hardly suited the requirements of the situation. This action is regarded a~ cl1·astic by son1.e hut doubtle~s concurfl w1 th the opinion of the majority of tlw 1n Pn in college. The meeting WRR called to orcle1· vdth Dr. Towne presiding. Aft~1· routine business. tlw baseball schedule 1nt-s ratifiE'd as sub1nitted. A resolution was also pas~ed that the- baseball Inan- ager should get an estin1ate on the coRt of n1aking a skin diamond and report to th€ executive com- mittee. To do away with the questi~onable custom of playing ''ringers\ on class teams, it v;as decided that no one should play on a class tean1 unless a bona fide n1ember of t11at class and that the ,m.an- age:r Of each class team must furnish to the execu- tiye committe~:' of the Athletic Board a list of his plnyers and his ::-;checl ule of gan1es. There has been no settled c-uston1. of a wa,rding- ca}H-3 and sweaten;;; to the wearers of the U, the swE a ten; being given in years oif prosperity, only. Accordingly it '\vas mo'\yed and carried that any . one on any college team, who earns his r during any season, shall thereupon recehTe from the Ath- letic Board a sweater bearing the V; and that any player earning his r. A. A. during any season shall thereupon receive fro1n t:1e Athletic Board a cap bearing the A. r. A. 'The last business of the meeH·1g '\Yas the passage of the aboye mentioned resolu t:on regarding th8 abolition of football.

COLLEGE MEN AND INTERN A- TIONAL ARBITRATION J>resid<'nt )lacCraeli.en·s Plan as Outlined at the JJalH\ )lohonk Conl~rPne<\ The \York of interesting college students in in- ternational arbitration ,,·as one of the subject~ most earnestly considered by the Lake Mo'honk Conference on International Arbitration, at its last session. Chancellor M,acCracken of Xew Y.ork University was the pricinpal speaker on the sub- ject and his words to voice the unanimous senti- ment of the conference. Chancellor MacCracken said that when he be- came .president of a university allnost a quarter of a century ago the colleges \vere using the same text book upon the subject which is in common use today, and that, this book devotes one hun- dred seventy-four pages to international conduct in times of peace and two hundred and twelve . pages to that conduct in time of war, a simple fact which speaks for itself as to the emphasis in pre~­ -ent teaching. He then pointed to the fact that international law is in almost all colleges only an ·elective, adding that it was perhaps not unfortun- :ate while emphasis continues to be placed upon the phases of the subj:ect \~'here it no\v Hes. The possibilities with a chan.ge of instructb:11 are at: once evident. Even the comrnoil hist(\:);l'3. text books now in use, a con1plete collection 0'f \Yhkh has been made by the historica'l de·pat~trrlelilt o.f Xew York Uni\·ersity, fa.ir to reyeal any o1uunge in the spirit of teaching the history of 'War ftTHlJ. that which the old conxentional text bo:ok was usE'cl Very little stress is laid upon the terriblefil:€Ss, the destruction, the lawless wickedness, of \•var. \The . only improven1.ent in the n1.odern text 'lil ooks .i~ that there is sornewhat less space deyoted t{} the subject. Three distinct changes in method of h1.st ruction ·were suggested by the Chancellor; first, :that the achievementf-; of peace and not ,,·at· be n'\lagnJfied: second, thatt he 1nisery and cost of war be tt·uly depicted; third. that fron1 high school u,p every effort be n1acle to exalt the preyent h·es o.f war. ~\11 the theory of international la\\' shoH1d be re- written so that it will invol\·e the acconilplish- m.ents of recent vears. and hence the n1o~t ad- . . Yanced stage toward arbitration, eYe-n if it is a poorer la K book than the present text. It wa~ • further suggested that if se\·eral cf the co He ge:-; should ask the entrance C'xan1ination bom~cl tn offer an exa1nination in arbitration, and if they should accept thi:::; instead of the usual •re(luire- Inents of ancient history, it would not take long to introduce the subject to the high Rchool C'Ur- riculums of our country. This ·would be no s1nall forward step. for in the 1najority of cases the high school ends the education of the n'lan, and hence to reach the great n'lajority the work must reach the high school. But th~ college should not neglect the work. Either in the Fresh man Ol' in the sophomore year eYery student who does not- offer some credentials of work in arbitration for entrance should be compelled to take so.n-.e cou r:::;e in the subject. This system \Voul.d b.J,·J.ng the ques- tion of arbitration home to the rn,il):ds €>.f the .stu- dents, would arouse an interest in the- s~bject. and make possible clubs for its more special study. These clubs Inigh t even go so far as to be O·rgan- ized for purposes of propogandism. P,resident l\IacCracken suggests that they be callecl \~Vorld 1 ' . ' > i ~ f

''Jrhe '''ords of Chancellor lVIacCracken appealed so strongly to the Conference that a committee ·was appointed to take up the work of arousing interest among the undergraduates in the country. At that time the suggestion was offered that col- leges should set aside a day for the special con- sideration and discussion of topics connected wit'h the suibject.-The Madisonensis.

This, he said, was wr,itten as a histo,ry :Dor th-e teaching of 1nen. In the Old 'Pestam.ent the.re is absolutely no mention. of im,mortality. The vvhole object seems to be the teaching of lessons for earthly life, drawn from the history of a people peculiarly favored by Ged.

They had no conception of ''secondary causes,\ but ascribed eve,rything to the direct agency of God. Thu.s an the miracles of the Old Testament ·were not meant by their authors as parables teaching a truU1, but as literal facts. The rest of his talk \\'as taken up by readings of passages to prove his position. He brought out also in the reading the literary value of the Old Testament. The talk next Sunday \\Till be on the Xe\Y Testa- ment, and the Sunday after, the fourth and last of the series, ·will be a sumn1.ary and general view of the \Vhole subject.

Finally the group was arranged \Vith Editor Imri.e's lofty, thought- ful brow, adorning the center o'f the first row with King, Miller, Classen, Reed and the lesser satellites in the immediate neighborhood. Cantwell, Par- sons and Mcintosh hrought up the rear. Sudden- ly \By\ Reed thought of a g-lee club rehearsal and had to announce it, with disastrous results. Ar- ranged once more, Warner King began to pass away and after being revived with cold water, explained that he had just had a relapse from a series of epileptic fits brought on by the offer of two literary articles and a poe1n by Powell, '08. The Board loRt control of itself momentarily and the ambulance \Vas sum1nonecl. After heroic medical treatn1ent the Board was finally able to sit up and make the camera look handsome.

THE CONCORDIENSIS II SIGMA XI SOCIETY Lceturc by Dr. lih1~·oun In SiHi!I.Dan Hall ·on Tuesday evening last Dr. J. J. Kinyoun of Philadelphia, forme.r surgeon of the U. S.

The inoculated Japanese soldiers were practically free from an disease, while the Russian ranks were greatly l'ecluced by the rav- e ages of these virulent diseasEs. In clesing the doctor made me-lil:bion 0f the mod- ern method of treating consurn'}.>t.ion and spoke largely fron1 an historical stand-point, showing particularly of the usefulness o1f Isolation vYards how the first beginnings of State investigation ·were in hospitals. attended \vith doubts and superstitions 011 the During the course of his rema1·ks Dr. Kinyoun part of the people and disinclination. of Congress paid a glowing tribute to Paste-aT, .the eminent to appropriate a sum sufficient to defray properly French physician, who has done .S<l much to allay the expenses involved.

A fe\\T years later Congress appointed a :\:'a tional Board of Health and this board acco1nplished n1uch in preventing the spread of contag·ious diseases. It might have become most in1portant and Yaluable had not Congress discontinued itfl existence by failing to make an appropriation. The lVIarine Hospital Service \Vas now chiefly concerned ·with the study of contagious diseases. The results of the study of this and other comrnissions 1nay be~t be illustrated by the condition of affairs in Havana after our late war with Spain. Yellow fever was rife in every quarter and had been for 300 years, and yet the medical and civil authorities ~uccee<i­ ed in completely stamping out the disease by de- stroying the 1nosquitos that were sn abundant. Today the n1osc1uito is considered the n1ost dan- gerous carrier of n1alaria and yellow fever. Pharmacy Notes F1·ed S. Leathers, who has beeB.
