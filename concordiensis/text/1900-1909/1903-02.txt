At a meeting of the trustees of Union Uni- versity, held in .A.:l bany, Tuesday evening, J anu- ary 27th, two distinctly post-graduate courses in electrical engineering were established at Ul!-ion College, to go into .effect just as soon as circu1nstances will pennit.· These courses are open to the graduates of the electrical en- gineering course of other colleges or institu- tions approved by the faculty, the one course leading to the degree of E. E. and consisting of r 8 hours per week for one year, the other course being a special post-graduate course of elec- tive work almost entirely and leading to no de- gree. There will be no time limit to this lat- ter course, as it is designed for the purpose of giving instruction in any special branch for any length of titne, tuition being paid for by the. hour, while the regular tuition fee of the post- graduate course leading to the degree of E. E. wi 11 be $ r so per year. It is furthern1ore an- nounced that no scholarships will be offered in either course. But some of the graduate students will assist in the laboratory classes and the compensation for this will materially lighten the expense of their course. Graduates of Union will natur- ally be given preference in this work. J:i'ollo·wing is the outline of the work covered in the regular post-graduate course, i.e. giving the degree of E. E. : Tenns Hours per wk. Long Distance Transmission Design and control of electrical Power Systems of very great Magnitude Electric Railway and 'I'raction, continued 2 2 3 2 2 . 2 Modern 1...,heorv of electrical \ engineering, continued 3 2 Oscillating Currents and High Frequency Phenomena 2 1 Lighting and Lighting Protection I 2 Wave Transmission with Special Application to 1..,elephony I 2 Scientific Foundations of Electrical Engineering 2 2 Che1nistry of very high Temperature I ~ Laboratory . Electives. The special post-graduate course for the year r 902-3 includes : Modern 'Theory of Electrical Engineering two hou1·s per ·week. Scientific Foundations of electrical engineer- ing two hours per week. Technical German one hour per week. Laboratory. Electives. The nun1ber of students will have to be lim- ited on account of the lack of space .. So far, about 2 5 students have been. admitted into these courses. 1'hey come from colleges all over the country, a.nd a few from Europe. Among the institutions represented may be mentioned the following : University of Stock- holm, Sweden ; University of Hanover, U. of P., Purdue, Cornell, 11. I. T. U. of Virginia, Columbia, and many others. It is said that post graduate courses will be started in the other departments as soon as the demand arises. President Raytnond says that he has receiv- ed numerous applications for entrance into such a course as either of the above, but it must be distinctly understood that the degree of E. E. from Union college shall stand for som~thing. This is quite obvious from the fact that a stu-. \

'1HE :CONCORDIENSIS. dent, to enter this post -.graduate course· mnst have h. is J3. E. or an eq ui valent if lle cotn es from an(}ther college. ln coHnection with the above it is interest- ing to note that a larg~ n un1ber of n1e m bers of the American Institute of Elect1:ica.l En- gineers who reside in this city .tnet recently im Sillio1an hall for the purpose of organizing a chapter o-f that organization here. 1\Ir.. ~Charles Proteus :Steinmetz was chosen pennanent chairman of such an organization and R. Neil Williarns secretary. A permanent con1mittee consisting of \V. Stichter, H. B. Reist and \V. G. Ely ,vas ap- pointed, :first to effect permanent organization and then to arrange for 1neetings, papers, dis- cussions, etc., of the society. lnfortnal discussions were held concerning ~ the work of the new chapter and the meeting adJourned subject to the call of the :c(}mmittee.. The charter members of the local chapter of the American Institution of Electrical En- gineers, are : Charles P. Steinn1et2, R .. Neil Williarns, E. \V. Rice, Jr., H. G. Reist, \V. G. Ely, Job.n Dempster, A. E. Averett, F. B. Corey, W. C. Slichter, A. P. Tank, lvf. P. IZice, H. P. Freund, A. S. Kappelle, H. Sudlow, Shiro Yarnagaki, JI. Scudder, Isaac F'. Brad- baus, N\. L. Rea and Edgar DickinsotJ. The senior electrical engineers will be able to avail then1selves of the papers and discus- siotls held at these meetings. FRESHMEN WIN SNOWBALL SCRAP. The annual snow ball scrap can1e ()f£ \V ed- nesday,.Jan. twenty-eighth with a great victory for 190 6 .. The morning could not have been :be ttcr Ch()sen. It had rained all n!ght and the morn- ing was by no means a dry one. The ground was covered with rain and slush. The underclasses had hardly gotten out of cha.pcl when the scrap was on, At :first it was a simple snowbaU fight but inc,ited by cries of \Over the terrace ! over the terrace ! \the freshn1en were not slow to drag the Sopho- nlo:res to their doom. ']' h,ere we.re more than forty freshn1en to less than twenty sophomores so it was not a difficult task. Once hurled over the terrace it was almO'st impossible for them to cHn1b up again as the freshn1en guarded every acessible approach. Then be- gan the triun1phant march of 1906. ·1~heSo­ phom,ores tried to break it up but all to no pur- pose. While the fresh1nen won the scrap by long odds 1905 put up the better fight and had it not been more than tw·o to one would surely have won the frav. As it is the :c:redi tis to be ., given mostly to the Sophon1ores. PROGRAM. Saturday, Feb. 7- J unior Hop, Yates Boat House. {Changed frotn Feb. 6.) Sunday, Feb. 8. s p. m. Vespers, Y. M. C . .A.

'/'' ' ' r y r.~ THE CONCORDIENSIS. 1 CAMPUS NOTES. 'rhe setni-annual tnee ting of theltrustees of Union University was held in Albany, in the office of the Hon. Simon \V. Rosendale, president of the board. In Mr. Rosendale's absence, fanner Judge J. S. Landon presided. Governor Odell was e1 ected honorary chan- ceUor of the university for this year, and he will deliver the annual address at the commencement in June, according to previous cus~om he will receive the degree of L. L. D. General Atnasa J. Parker resigned as se- cretary of the board, and Judge J. Newton Fiero, Dean of the Albany Law School, was elected to fill his place, General Parker nominating his successor. Reports were n1ade concerning the five departn1ents of the university, which showed the rapid progress which all the different institutions are n1aking. Chancellor Ray- mond su bn1i tted a report in regard to the new e'lectrical engineering course and the report was accepted. 'The trustees expressed great pleasure at the work the college is doing and authorized the remodeling of North College the san1e as South College. 'Ve are all pleased to learn that aside fro1n a severe bruising and shock, Prof. \Vright did not suffer in the catastrophe of a week ago Saturday. It seen1s that while he was walking along N ott 1.,errace 11ear Union street a runaway horse dashed up behind hin1 on the sidewalk. It is n1iraculous that no hones · were broken and th.at the Professor did not sustain pern1anent injuries fron1 the up that followed, bat such is the and Prof. 'Vright will doubtless be to rneet his classes this week. . 1111X- CaSe able Prof. J an1es 1{.. Tnt ax occupied the pulpit uf the Union Presbyterian church on Tues- day, Jan. 2 sth, and preached on the wisdom pf a broad view of life. Pres. A. V. V. Raymond and Prof. Stein- metz attended a dinner given by ~1:r. 'Villiarn H. Seward, in New York City, last 1\'hursday . even1ng. The Cornell, Colgate, Union and Syracuse chapters of Phi Gamma Delta will meet in convention at Syracuse, February 27 and 28. The national fraternity is con1posed of six- teen sections, of which the Central New York chapters constitute the fourth. On the evening of the 27th the local chapter will tender a reception and ball to the delegates at En1pire Hall. T'he follov1ing eveni11g the annual banquet will be held. By a unanimous vote the Board of Direc- tors of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers has passed are solution disapproving of the establishn1ent on the part of the state of a laboratory and standardization bureau. The establishn1ent of such a bureau was reco1nmended by a con1n1ission appointed to consider the question by the last legisla- ture. This con1mission recon1mended the appropriation of $2 7 5 ,ooo for establishing the laboratory in connection with Union college. In order to obtain the opinion of electrical experts circulars of inquiry were sent to consulting and operating engineers through- out the country. The consensus of these reolies was that establishment of the bureau J. \vould be un\vise. The recotnmendation of the State Elec- trical Cotnn1.ission that the State act as· a technical arbitrator of power companies and municipali~ies or other consumers was also generally opposed on the ground that an atnendtnent to the Constitution would be required to 111ake such a law possible, and that in practice the plan would not be practi- cable. It's a deal harder to pay one's honest debts than to shout in me~tin', according to the

'fhe eighth annual banquet of the Chi Psi alun1ni association of northern and eastern New York will be held at Hotel Ten Eyck, Albany, on February IJ. The association numbers about 250 Chi Psi alumni associations of Northern part of this state. The president and toastmaster for this year is James H. Callanan, editor of The Union. Albany men having the banquet in charge are Frank B. Gilbert, lvforgan B. Griswold, N eile F. ,.!'owner, Guernsey Jewett and John R. Cranell, Jre A committee was appointed as follo\vs to see what arrangements could be made con- cerning the skating accommodations for stu- dents : Guy 13. Griswold, Robert F. Barrett, A. H. Kessler, Harry Wickham, V\Tilliam C. 'freder and Frank R. Andrews. Arrangements are being n1ade for the ora- torical contest to be held in Syracuse. Prof. C. P. Steinmetz delivered a lecture before the Labor Lyceum, Sunday, Feb. 1st. The question of our having a skating rink has finally been settled. Mr Pond has secur- ed perm\ssion fron1 the water commissioner of Schenectady to use the city water and it now remains simply for a cold snap to come along to freeze up the ground so that it will hold water before the floating is done. The committee appointed to look into the matter met during the week and it is very likely that the rink will be on the oval as that seen1s to be the most suitable place and the one that will require the least bank- ing to keep the water in. Mr. Pond has displayed a great deal of interest in th~ matter and it no~t remai11s for the students to live up to their en.d of the agreetnent. The Soiree co111n1ittee is busy at work, has appointed its various conunitte~s and has secured the serv~ces of Gioscia's orches- tra, a fact which augurs 'vell for the success of the dance. Geo. A. Vedder, 'os, wl~.o left on Jan. 6th, to spend a few 1nonths in ,California, is pleas- an t1 y located at Pasadena, Cal., and writes glowing reports of the \vest. His, like a good many trunks, seemed disposed to take a circuitous route to that land of sunshine and strawberries, and finally reached its de5Jtination about tbTee weeks late. rfhose who have been in the sam,e fix, will doubtless appreciate the hutnor of living in a dress-suit case for a few 'veeks.

REMODELING NORTH COLLEGE. The work on ren1odeling North College has already begun and the cellars being dug. rrhe renovation will COV'er exactly the changes that were .made in South College during the sum1ner, with the exception that one section will not have running water in it. 1'he rents in this section will be less than in the others, the purpose being not to exclude those stu- dents who do not care to pay the greater an1ount, which the putting in of water will ne- cessitate. The who:Ie coUe-ge however will be supplied with stean1 heat and electric lights and the shower baths and toilets will be en- tirely n1ade over. 1\1 r. Pond intends to pu~h the ,vork with all legititnate rapidity and wtll take one section at a time so that the change tnay be effected by conltn'encement. PRO AND CON. Prof. Marshall L. Perrin of Boston Uni- versity recently made a violent attack on football. He declares that bullying is noth- ing tnore thaa \carrying the tackling impulse into everyday school ,intercourse,\ and says that \a buHfight is not to be compared to a football game.\ My, what a gentle lot of boys those Bostonians must be ! The Rev. Simon John I'1cPherson, head- 1naster of the Lawrenceville, t~. J., preparatory s~hool in an address before the Presbyterian social union said : \I would rather have one student killed occasionally in a gan1e of football than have all the boys rot to death in call ege. \The boy n1ust devel<>p physically, spiritu- ally anll intellectually. I don't believe in those persons who decry football. Such talk is all bosh. I an1 in favor of football with all my heart, even if there are brok~n _legs, sprained ankres and bumped heads. :he tntel- lectual life should be as strenuous as tt can be. The spiritual life is not a \Vatertight compart- ment. It should take in everything or noth- . '' tng.

Address all communications to THE CoNCORDIENSIS, Union College, Schenectady, N. Y. Now for baseball ! \Vith a good schedule already ar- ranged of fourteen games, seven of which are on the campus, including games with West Point, \Villiams, Columbia, Hamilton, \Vesleyan and Vermont, the manager has certainly made an auspicious beginning for a successful season. Captain Griswold has issued a call for men and active practice will soon be beg-un in the cage. There now remains but one thing to be done that we may have a successful season on the diamond. This is to pay the baseball subscription. If every man would take it unto himself to hunt up the manager or class collector and pay his share in the support of the team, a great deal of the usual unpleasantness, which neces- sarily attends urging a man for what is reasonably ex- pected of him, would be obviated. The man who says little but can be relied upon to support college enterprises from the depths of his poe· ket shows more true spirit than he who hom the depths of his heart, but nothing else, proclaims aloud his lusty approval of th.is and that organization. Let us aH co-operate and show in cold cash that we don't send forth a nine just becaus~ every college that pretends to . be a college has to have a baseball team, but because we really want one. If the team itself feels that it has the hearty and ungrudging support of every man in col- lege, it will have one of the greatest incentives to lead it on to victory. While it is absolutely necessary fo.r the success of the baseball season that financial encouragement be immediately forthcoming, it is no less necessary for the success of another college enterprise that the subscriptions to the Concordiensis be paid more promptly. Please see your class collectors or Mr. Bishop at your earliest convenience and settle your honest debts. Who, trusting, now enjoys you just as gold And hopes to see you always his to seize And always kind to him alone- He does not know the falseness of a breeze.. They're lost for whom you shine untried! A sacred wall doth show by votive slate from me That I, my dripping garments, have hung up To Neptune, god of power and of sea. Q. E. D. 'o5.

12 TilE CONCORDIENSIS. Assemblyman William vV. Wemple,. '86, will be one of the speakers at the annual dinner of the Albauy County Republican Organiza- tion, which will take place in Odd Fellows' Hall, February 4· The Governor and Lieu- tenant Governor are also expected to be present. The friends of Elnathan Sweet, former state engineer, 'vere greatly shocked to hear of his death, which occurred at the Fort Orange Club in Albany, Jan. 26. Elnathan Sweet ·was born in Chester, J3erk- shire county, 1Iass., N oven1 ber 20, r'8 37, and received his pre litninary education in the pub- lic and private schools of Stephentown, N. Y., and Hancock, Mass. In 1859 he was gradua- ted 'fronl Union college, 'vhere he pursued a course of civil engineering. For about one year thereafter he was a deputy under \Vard B. Burnett, surveyor-general of the state of Nebraska. Returning home he was n1arried and at once engaged in the civil engineering as assistant on various railroad projects, with headquarters in Stephentown. In 1864 he went to Franklin, Pa., where he was engaged in general engineering, developing oil wells, coal mines, etc., and where he retnain ed until 1868, when he n1oved to Chicago and prose- cuted his profession. In 1869 he was ap- pointed chief engineer of the Rock Island & St. Louis rail way (now the Rock Island and St. Louis division of the C. B. & Q.), with headquarters in both Chicago and St. Louis. He built this line two hundred and thirty miles in length in about t\velve months, and in · 1871, after its con1pletion was also made superintendent. l-Ie held both positions until 1872, and during the year 1871 was also consulting engineer of the Rockford Central and the Cairo and St. Louis railroads. In 1872 he formed a partnership with James R. Young, of Chicago, under the :finn name of E. Sweet, jr., & Co., and engaged in railroad construction, con tinning unti 1 187 5. During that period they built most of the Northern Paci6c railway ft~()lU the Red River of the North across Dakota to the Missouri ,: river, several bridges in !Ch.i:cago, and a part of the tunnel at \Vest Point, N. Y., for what is now the vVest Shore ra:Ht-oad. In I87 5 he :. was appointed by Gover~:l'or Tilden exper·t engineer for the co·tnm1i ssion investigating the abuses on the New 1.! ork state canals· and was engaged in t bose con1plicated af- fairs until the spring of IS-76, when fie was appointed division engineer, which position he held until the spriqg o!f r 88o. The work of th~ Tilden corntnissl:ort, was chiefly di- rected to the discovery of the abuses which had becon1e flagrant in the letting and the can-ring out o:f contracts for the various engi'neering vr ()rk s involved 111 enlarging and improvin:g the state canals. 1'he professional experience and acconl- plishments of Mr. S~weet enabled him to exercise a salutary 1n.~uence in direct- ing this work in the ~tnost effective man- ner, and his labors in formulating rnany of its important reports have contributed to the extensive and p ennanent reforms which have since characterized this depart- ment of the state adn1inistration. :ivir. Sweet resigned as division engineer of the cana:1s in the s11ring of 188o, and resutned the business of railroad construc- tion with his former l)artner, James R. Young, witl1 offices :in New York city. This partnership continue<} until 1883, the~r business being principalilJ the building of the New York, West Shore and Buffalo I railroad, for about fifty miles in Greene, Albany and Orange co11nties, finishing the West Point tunnel, and constructing a part of the New York, Susquehanna and 'Vestern rai!lroad frorn the Delaware river west. In 1883 he \Vas n.on1inated by the Den1ocrats and elected ~tate engineer and in 188 5 was re-elected to the san1e office, serving in all four yea1-s. l)uring ~'lr.

A discus- : sion of these experiments and the laws ,I of propulsion derived fron1 them were · published by him in the '' 'I'ransactions of the An1erican Society of Civil Engineers'·' for 187g.,. and constitute the n1ost impor- tant contribution existing in this branch of engineering literature. I-Ie also during that period, thoroughly investigated the problen1 of connecting the great lakes with the I-Iudson by a ship canal. His paper on this subject, read before the Amer- ican Society of CiYil Engineers in r884, with the discuss'ion upon it, published in the transactions of that society for 188 5, are of the highest authority on canal questions. As state engineer 1'Ir. Sv~ 7 eet 's efforts were strenuously exerted to restoring to the engineering departrnent of the state govern- ment the control of all engineering ques- tions and matters in which the state was concerned, many of which had formerly been entrusted to con1n1issions or to other departn1ents of the state administration ; and it is larg~ly due to his labors that the office of the state engineer now exercises n1ost of the functions appropriate to the usefulness and dignity of that constitutional offiee. Since the expiration of his second term as state engineer on Decen1ber 3 r, 1887, lVIr. Sweet succes~fully followed his profession as a civil and consulting engineer and also as president and trustee of the I-lilton Bridge Construction Company. He was also re- ceiver of the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company. In the prosecution of struc- tural engineering he introduced n1any iln- provements in the design of n1ovable bridges and bridges of long spans, the most no- ticeable, perhaps, being the con1bination of the arch and the cantilever in the same structure, originated by hin1 and ·first used in his design for the great bridge -connect- ing Capitol hill with Arbor hill, and which has since been extensively copied in Europe and in this country. lie was also a n1en1ber of the State Water Storage Corntnission. Since the sale of the Hilton Bridge Com- pany to the bridge trust he had followed h:is profession as civil engineer. ~lr. Sweet lived in Albany since r875, and was not only \vell known as an end- nent civil engineer, but was long prominently identified with many of the city's enter- prises and efficiently active in pron1ot ing its welfare and advancement. He was a trustee of the sinking fund and a men1 bcr of the finance board of the city fron1 1889 to 1892, and in July, 1896, was re-appointed t0 these positions. He was a tnember of the \iV ater Board f ro1n 189 2 to 1894. He was a tne1nber of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the University Club of New York and the Fort Oranc;;e Club of Albany. September 20, 186o, he was married to 1\1arion Rose, daughter of Jon a than Rose, of Stephentown, N.

Note.-Through the courtesy of Prof. La11dreth, the Concordiensis is able to print this week from the synop- sis of the report of the state water storage commission, which we think will be of interest, especially to the en- gineering students. Of unusu~~l interest, by virtue of dealing with a question never before considered by the State, is the report of the State vVater Storage Com- tnission, presented to the Legislature. The .commission was appointed by Governor Odell after the adjournment of the Legislature under authority of a bill which proposed the investi- gation of floods and called for an answer by

14 . THE CONCORDIENSIS. the commission, after surveys and investiga- tions have been tnade, as to whether floods throughout the State, which cause $3,ooo, ooo loss annually, could be abated and how. 'rhe commission named consists of Olin H. Landreth, professor of engineering at Union University ; fonner State Engineer Elnathan Sweet _of Albany, an account of whose death tnay be found in another colun1n ; George W. Rafter, a protninent engineer of Rochester ; John L. I<.ing, of Syracuse ; George R. Finch, of Glens Falls ; and th_e Attorney General, the State Engineer, the Superintendent of Public Works and the State Commissioner of Forest, Fish and Game. Since its appointn1ent the commission has carefully investigated every flooded district in the State, has mapped by water courses the entire State, and has appointed local con1mit- tees and received reports from them in every district of the State which has been subjected to floods. The query upon the part of the Legislature as to whether freshets can be prevented and what should be done to prevent freshets, is, to sum up the report entire, answered as follows : Freshets not only can be prevented through- out the State by the straightening of river channels and the storage of water at the head- waters of streams, but through such storage, progression upon the part of the State is assured toward these results : Improvement of public health, improvement of navigation through uniform flow of rivers, the reclaiming ·of marshes, the furnishing of additional water for canals, affording pure tnunicipal ·water supply to cities and villages, and finally the develop- ment of hundreds of thousands of horse pow- er by the generation of electricity, ,which will put New York Sta,te far in advance, instead of far behind, other States of the Union genera- tion of electrical power and the consequent in- crease of manufacturing industries. ·'We believe that State supervis:ion and con- trol is the only safe method of intelligently initiating, constructing and maintaining an ad- equate system of dver improvement in the State The suggestions as to what the measures for legislation should contain are as follows : Inauguration and execution of the system in the hands of a permanent comtn~ission ; en- tire cost of the e::cecu tion and maintenance of each of the various separate works to be borne by beneficiaries ; initiative of the. -wor1{ of itn- provement by pul)lication by the commission of notice of intention, or by petition ; the pow- er to prepare necessary n1aps, plans, specifica- tions estitnates and to execute tbe. work with stringent regulations. Report concludes as follows: \ We are firmly convinced that the prompt inaugura- tion of snch a policy by the Legislature would more profoundly influence the progt·ess and prosperity of the commrnonwealth than any public enterprise to which its intention can be directed.''

l :. ; y THE CONCORDIENSIS UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 11, 1902. No. 1.6 LANGTON'S CALL. Langton was returing frorn his usual nightly debauch. All evening he had been carousing with two congenial friends, who shared with hin1 a taste for conviviality, but they, being equally stup.ified had left him to find his way home alone .. It was a dismal night, with the fog hanging low between the houses and the rain dripping steadily from the roofs; Langton with coat collar turned up ~nd hat partly over his eyes \Vandered staggering up the side-walk cursing his hard luck with drunken stupidity, for com- ing out on such a night. His benumbed brain was not capable of grasping any facts ; he stumbled past a brightly lighted hotel but did not see it. He passed on. * * :k . * I * 1\'liss Glendon happened to be up late that night answering an accumulated- correspon- dence. Having completed her task she sat musing by the fire before retiring. She was viewing the past few months with rather pain- ful retrospection. It was only a short tin1e before that her engagen1ent had been announ- ced to Forsythe Langton, and yet, he seeln- ed to be growing more wild and thoughtless every day. She had hoped that her influence would have turned hirn frotn his downward path but he seerned to forget his promises to her as soon as he got out of her sight. \Ah well, \ she sighed to herself, blushing slightly, \ we will soon be married and then he will have to reform.\ She estimated her powers to her own satisfaction. Miss Glendon was startled out of her reverie by the sound of some one coming up the front steps. She sat upright and turned a trifle pale. She was alone, except for her little sister sleep- ing up stairs. Who could be there? The steps seemed to be stealthy. One thought possessed her n1ind. :Burglars! She crossed the room quickly, and opening her father's desk, took out a revolver. Its harrell gleamed in the red firelight and she trembled at the thought of what she might do the next moment. She stood waiting, her heart beating· loudly, Suddenly there was a crash and the door burst open. 'fhe hall \Vas dark; she could only dis- tinguish a crouching form whose attitude and appearance did not reassure her. ''Who are you?\ asked Miss Glendon in an unsteady voice. For answer the figure began slowly to rise and then came a little forward. A thousand thou~hts flashed through her brain; she began to be terrified. Her little sister's, as well as her own safety were at stake. She decided. ''Stand, or I shoot,'' she said in clear, but un- natural tones, at the same tin1e bringing the pistol up until it pointed at the man's breast. He advanced, there was a blinding flash, a loud report and the figure fell headlong into the room. It took son1e minutes for Miss Glendon to recover her self-possession. \Vhen she did she seemed to note something fatniliar about the strangely inert thing which lay across the room from her; the blood ebbing from a wound over its heart was staining the carpet. She crossed the room and bent over the 1notionless form .. She put her hand over its heart; it had stop- ped beating. Then, to cease the flow of blood she decided to turn the corpse over. Not with- out shuddering she gently raised him and laid him on his back. 1'hen, she screamed and fell back: the staring, sightless eyes that she look- ed into were those of her lover! * * * * * Those who came next day found the dead guarding the dead.

THE OONCORDIENSIS. /· \~} ARTHUR LEE BENNING. The death of Benning occurred at his home in Clyde, N. Y., on Friday the 6th. He ·was doing his work on the preceding 11onday, though not feeling v:ell. By order of Drs. Towne and Pearson l1e was carried home on \Vednesday. He was accompanied by B. ,V. Roy. H. A. -Pierce, 'o3, and J. F. Putn1an at- tended his funeral. Benning was of the class of 1904 and a tnein- her of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity. He had .a quiet manner but an impressive personality, so that he was a well\known member of the College. He was reporter for ''the Gazette'' from the time he entered college in r 900. This paper prints a glowing tribute to him on account of his good and faithful work and his sterling qualities of character, \vhic.h is given in full in another column. 1.,he staff of the Gazette sent a handsome wreath of flowers for his burial. Benning's character was noted for honesty, conscientiousness, faithfulness, truth and jus\ tice. He vvas preetninently a 'vorker, support- ing himself through his college course. His death was caused by typhoid fever which read- ily attacked a constitution weakened by over- work and consequent lack of sleep and regular healthful exercise. lie seemed to be one who constantly exerted the highest activity of his . abilities. I:-Ie was a pron1inent 1nan on the t1·ack team, and was on the staff of the'' Con- . cordiensis.\ His associates of the press had predicted a brilliant career for hin1. He was an only son, and leaves a bereaved family of father and n1other and a younger sister, \vhom he had in tended to educate after llis graduation. 1'he whole College joins the family in mourning his loss. Resolutions of the Class of 1904. Whereas, Divine Providence has retnovc d from our number Arthur L. Benning, and Whereas, 1.,his loss is keenly felt by the college, especially by his classmates to w hon1 his associations and friendship remain cher- ished, be it Resolved, That we, the class of 1904, herein express our deep solTO\-V and regret for the loss o£ our fellow classmate Arthur L. Benning ; and be it also Resolved, 1~hat we tender our heartfelt sytnpathy to his bereaved fan1ily, whose hopes have been centered in the l,ife so suddenly taken ; and to his fraternity, who have lost a loyal and beloved brother. And be it also Resolved, 'fhat a copy oCthese resolutions be sent to his family and to his fraternity. ELBERT V. l\1ULLENEAUX. W. H. GUARDENIER. CLAUDE N. J3ROWN.

President Ray- mond gave one of his practical talks, dwelling I t1,.

I t1, ·'' THE OONCORDIENSIS. 7 espe,cially upon the cooperation between man and God in all so-called human achievement. He showed that all material progress had come, from man's understanding.of the laws of nature and his obedience to them. By obedience hebe- conles master of physical forces and uses them. In regarding the laws that govern these forces, he is helpless before them. The same princi- ple obtains in the tnoral and spiritual world. ''rhe forces that make for righteousness are under law. Only as 1nan obeys these laws, do theses forces become his servants. Refere11ce \vas made to the laws controllingtnental energy, especially the law of habit. President Raytnond spoke finally of the judgment passed upon all n1an's ·work by the demands of reality. Only that abides which is genuine, thorough. Every day that is super- ficial, pr~tentions unreal, will be swept away. 'rhis is because we are \vorkers together with God and only that which he approves can stand. It is impossible to give n1ore than a brief out- line of the address which was full of suggest- ions bearing upon every day work in college. LIBRARY-CHAPEL. It has always been a source of much pleas- ure and gratification to the students of Union to be able to show \Vith the changing years marked improvements in and about the col- lege. Incidentally it pleases others also, but to the ones who are privileged to enjoy the new conditions, it is especially grateful. \Vith th~ ne\Y era which is dawnino· at Union b ' the desires of the student along certain 1 ines have been to a high degree appeased if not entirely satisfied. Naturally et1ough, as a resu_It of new and better changes, ideas will come even to the foolish and inexperienced, and, when proceeding fron1 a loyal spirit, should be expressed. rl'he renlova1 of the library from its pres- ent location to I\'Ie1norial Hall leaves a vacant roorn which to the student mind has many fi11e possibilities. To most of those who have been accustomed to spend a great part of the time there, the large, well-lighted win- dows, the high ah·y ceilings and the very atmosphere which seems to surround the place n1ake it suitable but for one thing-a chapel. Chapel is of interest to all students in one way or another, but the character of this interest is determined in a large way by assoc1at1ons. Imp,ressions cannot be made in this case by nae1~e thinking and imagination. There n1ust be son1ething more material to show to the student for what purpose a chapel is intended. The present library, lighted with stained glass windows to set off to the fullest advani tage the Gothic style of architecture, fitted with appropriate seats, and containing the other accessories necessary to a place of worship, n1ight weH be called a chapel, and called such with pride. Under such condi- tion the feelings· .experienced by those who are expected to spend a fe\v minutes each morning in dev-otion might be different. Certainly the present library is worthy of son1ething n1ore than to be a receptacle for biological, botanical and other specimens of antiquity. BASKET BALL. Rochester defeats Union by a score of 28-s. Last Saturday the Union basket ball team journeyed to R<>chester and there n1et defeat at the hands of the home tean1 to the tune of 28 to 5· The gan1e was characterized by fast and fu- rious playing and the fact that De Mallie and Olmstead played indoor foot-bali n1ade it diffi .. cult for the umpLres to make it a clean game. In the first half the Rochester forwards lo5t their opponents and made four baskets in about as many minutes. Earle made the field goal for Union in this half and Andy threw one foul.

' ) I 1 I I f I I I l I 8 THE OONOORDIENSIS. In the second half Union surprised Roches- ter by playing a defensive game., Rochester scored first and imtnediately after that Earle threw the last goal for Union. Rochester scored but 6 points in this half. Dr. Pollard did himself credit by providing good entertainment and accommodations. The line up was as follows : Rochester. Union.

Parker announces that the election of Asst. Track Manager is due and that McCon1bs and Cool of the Junior class have registered. It is moved and carried that the student body proceed to election. Capt. Griswold announces that practice will begin in the cage for the Varsity. Practice will be 1?-eld Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at 3: 45, and on Saturday at 2 :3o. Gulnac criticizes the Junior Hop committee on the lack of hops this year and particularly the absence of any hop this term. Watson voiced the sentiments of the committee by stating the difficulties encountered this term and that the committee would like to see the hops supported by the students as college affairs. Howe announces that the first rehearsal of the Dramatic Club for its new piar will ~e held in Sillilnan Hall at 4:30 Monday after- noon. He also announces that any absences fron1 rehearsals of the rnusical clubs will be regarded as resignations. 'l'he result of election ·of Ass\t. Manager of . the track team is as follows : McCombs 31, Cool 28. McCombs is therefore declared elected. Fenster speaks of the necessity of haying more candidates for places on the debating team·. Rutgers is sure to send a fine team up here and competition is necessary.. Hunt also speaks on this subject. Pres. Ollnsted announces a meeting of the Junior class after chapel meeting. Adjourned.

A comtni t tee was appointed sotne time ago to confer with Mr. Pond concerning a skating rink on the catnpus. Up to the time this issue of the Concordiensis went to press no man of this comtnittee had taken any steps toward such a conference. \Vhy is this so ? rro have a rink for the few week.s left to winter may be advisable, but even in that case as a matter of courtesy the con1n1ittee should officially notify the Asst. Treasurer. It seen1s rather ill-ad vised to give up holding a Junior Hop this term. If anything these dances should be the more strongly emphasized this year because of the disadvantages under which the Soiree Con1mittee has labored and the Senior Ball comtnittee undoubtedly will labor. Organizations in college, which have no re- cognition from the student body, should be very careful how they are advertised or commented on in press notices. It is not just that they should be n1entioned as the Union College society, club, tean1, etc., etc. There have been too many examples of the pernicious effects of a lack of recognition, either through carelessness or through intent, to pose as a re- cognized organization. \Vhy should the students be thoughtful of their obligations to their class and college ? Why should all subscriptions and assessments be paid promptly? \Vhy not wait until every- thing fai1ls or just flickers along because of lack of aid in. the form of money ? )Vhy nut let all the teams, clubs, associations be disbanded ? \Vhat if they do foster college spirit, make col- lege better and brighter, broader and fuller for every man in it? What if they do attract new students? What if they bring the name of the college in- to places to which it had never before pene- trated? Vvhy? Until the lavatory in the gymnasium was renovated and put in first class condition, the clamour was loud and long on the part of many of the students because the toilet roorps were not in tlle best of condition. Now that through the generosity of our treasurer, Mr. Bailey, the lavatory has been put in :good order, it would seetn perfectly prQper that the students would appreciate this and refrain from giving expression to poetic inspirations on the walls and closets. As a matter of fact, the ren1edy of this evil lies very largely in the hands of the upper- classn1en. It is reasonable to presume that a man who has spent two years in college has outgrown such acts of vandalism and the exer- tion of bn t little authority would be sufficient to pre\Vent freshmen from practicing prep. school tricks on college property.

Y. .Addres~ all communications to THE CoNCORDIIi:NSis, Union College, Schenectady, N. Y. Since our last issue the Great Shadow has fallen across our pathway and has hidden from our sight our friend and co·worker, Arthur Lee Benning. To his fellow students Ms death comes as a great shock, a deep- per· sonal letss. We seldom measure the extent to which otu interests are bound together, how the thousand and one strands of a college course are crossed and in.ter\voven. It is only on rare occasions such as this, \vl1en Death steps in and with sudden and relentless fingers rends the web of our fellowship in the CQllege community, that we are brought face to face -vvith this great problem of college life. \Ve would that we might fully voice all the sorrow felt by the students, that we might show ho:~.v ltis loss affects so many lines of college activity, but the -words fail to come at our bidding. As a member of this board he. always displayed a rare faithfulness and devotion, per~£orming his .duties with promptness and manifesting no little talent. In the Schenectady ''Gazette\ of the 6th inst., there appeared an editorial which expresses far better than . we can the esteern in which he was held. We take ; the liberty to reproduce it in ft1ll : For the .first time in the history of The Gazette, ;.death has entered its family and taken one of its :members. That Arthur Lee Benning has passed into · ~the great beyond comes as a deep personal bereave· ment to those who ·have worked with him and had come to love him well. The shock .is .intensified by its suddenness. As recently as last J\.Ionday evening he was in his place, doing llis work as well .and conscienti<>usly as ever, although he complained of not being well. On Tuesday morning he was found to have typhoid fever and he was taken on Vv ednes- day to his home in Clyde that he might receive the care and attention that only his family could give. Before Clyde was reached it ~vvas seen that he was very ill, much worse than had been supposed, and after tbe end of llis journey was attained it became evident that his chances for recovery were slight, and yesterday morning the end came peacefully, Death was due to typhoid fever, His constitution was not a strong one, and the attempt to do the work he had set out for him· self weakened it still further, so that when the dis- ease came on him he was unable to throw it off. 1\fr. Benning was 20 years old . and a student at Union college, being a member of the junior class. He was popular with his college mates, as well as with all who knew him, and a gloom has been cast over the college by his untimely death. He was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, one of the editorhll staff of the Concordiensis, and a prominent member of the athletic team. As a student he was a hard worker, yet not one of those men who have no thought but for the marks they may obtain and the prizes they may win. There is every reason to believe th~t had he Hved he would have been among the men whom a college proudly numbers on its roster of eminent graduates. But after his family it is his associates on The Gazette who most keenly feel his death. l-Ie came to The Gapette in September, I goo, a mere boy of 18, who had graduated from the Clyde High school, and worked at the printer's case to earn money to give him a start towards a college education. For nearly two years and a half he has been one of The Gazette's reportorial staff, being etnployed evenings and an occasional afternoon, while college was in sessiou, and steadily during the summer. In these two years and a half he developed into a man of remarkable ver· 1', I) .•

The public -which. always sees the newspaper as a wl1ole and not the individual work, will best reme.mber him by the reports of the State League baseball games played on Island Park last summer. It is no exaggeration to say that they were the best baseball stories ever published in a Sdtenectady newspaper, interesting even to those who cared nothing for basebaH. Nor was this his only line of excellence. He was a man who could be depended on to do Rnything asked of him and to do it well. lie has left a void that can never be filled .. Of his personality, it is hard for those who appre- ciated its rare quality to speak. Honest, conscientious, faithful, true, just, without a bit of sham and himself a hater of pretence., alway!; cheerful, although he was carrying a heavy load, always ready to help another to do his and more than his share of what- ever might need to be done ; such men are too uncom· mon for one to die and not be sincerely mourned. The death of any young man of such promise and such attainments is a matter for general regret, but in his case it seems tllat some curious chance of fate must have caused the wrong man to be taken. His father, bereft of his only son, his mother, her- self an invalid who must lose the stay of her de- clining years, the younger sister, whom he had intended to educate when he had finished his college career, these three remain to wonder why he should. be taken and another left. For them, as well as for all who knew him, there is sorrow and bitterness of heart now, to be in time replaced by the men1ory of a good and noble life, and the thought that \ after life's fitful fever, he sleeps well.\ For Arthur Lee Benning there is left only, in the words of the burial service, \' Dust to dust and ashes to ashes and his spirit unto the God who gave it. CA1\-1PUS NOTES. The excavations for the installatin of the heating plant in ~orth college is con1pleted. T'he lavatory facilities will be in North and :t\1iddle sections. As soon as Mr. Pond can complete his estitna tes they \Vill proceed with the carpenter and rnason work. 1\'he recently quoted statement of op1nton by the A. I. E. E., adverse to the establish- ment by the state of a State Electrical Labor- atory, represents by no means a majority opinion, but is chiefly that of out of this state engineers whom the question does not concern. A majority of the letters received from mem- . bers in this state cordiaUy endorsed the plan. The annual debate between Rutgers and Union will be held in Schenectady ·on the night of Friday, March 13th. The subject is : l{esolved, that it is for the public interest that every man should be able to do any lawful work at any rate of wages which may be agreed upon between himself and his en1ployer. The first trial for places will be held before a committee of the faculty on Feb. 18th. Chairman Sherrill has announced that there will be no Junior Hop this term, as it is impos- sible to secure Yates' Boat House for the r 3th. inst., the only available date before Lent. The management has arranged for a track meet with Rutgers, to be held in New Bruns- wick un !,fay 9th. 1-Irs. A. V. V. Raymond entertained Bishop and 1V1rs. Sheldon M. Griswold February 7th.

Yates, Union, 'o2, is situated at Coatesville, Pa. From the publication of the Chicago Univer- sity School : The only change in the faculty is in the nature of an addition to the teaching force of the school. Mr. Philip Thornson, Union Col- lege, A. B. and Harvard A. B., comes as in- structor in English and declamation. Mr. 'fhomson has had special preparations in Eng- lish, was editor-in-chief of his own college week- ly and has had two years practical experience in newspaper work, having been a contributor to the Boston ·rranscript and other papers. He has a hearty welcome to the University School. Vigorous efforts on the part of Rev,. John Calvin Knox, Union, 'go, who has been for some time, and is still, pastor of the Second Reformed Church at Rotterdam, N. Y., have resulted in the erection of a chapel in connec- tion with the church. On l'uesday, Jan, 25, the chapel was dedicated by Rev. Mr. Knox amid impressive ceremonies at which addresses were given by local pastors. Rev. Nlr. Knox studied at Auburn and Union Theological Seminaries and is a very energetic worker in religious lines. LOCOMOTIVE NOVEL TIES OF 1904 The present year will witness some very interesting developments in locomotion, both on land and sea. In June next Mr. F. B. Beh r hopes that . a portion of his 1\{anches- ter and Liverpool IV[ono-Rail Electric Ex- press Railway will be opened, and th~t cars will be running on it at 110 miles an · hour. Mr. Behr is introducing a bill next session for a I..Jondon to Brighton. n1ono-railway, which would take us down to the sea in half an hour. Many business n1en come up to town every day from London-by-the- Sea, and a half-hour journey would g~eatly · add to the number. l\1any of the big rail~ way companies are electrifying portions of ·. their lines, and by the close of 1903 trains . will be running by electricity. 1'he· Barmen· Elberfeld Suspended Electric Railway is to be opened by the German Emperor in June next. On this curious line-the only one of its kind in the world-the cars run under- . neath the rails. Engineers, like the Athen- ians of old, are always hankering after something new. There will be some novelties in ocean travel also. In May the first turbine-driven cross-Channel steamer ever built will com- mence running bet ween Dover and Calais, an;d in August another turbine vessel will : be placed on the regular Newhaven-Dieppe i servtce. On these boats we shall not only travel faster, but we shall feel no uqpleasantness from the engines and propeller shafts-a present cause of much discomfort to poor sailors. In April the }llost po'Yerful-engin- ed liner in the world will start running, namely, the North German Lloyd Kaiser Wilhelm der Zweite. She is expected to break many records on the Atlantic ferry._: London Chro11icle.

'THE 'CONC.ORDIENSIS. 13 AGAINST COLLEGE ATHLETICS. . Apropos of nothing in particular, but merely as a good expression of sentin1ents which are const~ntly gaining ground atnong prominent educators the following views of Dr. James C. Gilchrist of th~ Univerity of Iowa are given. There is much good for thought in them es- pecially the relation of athletics to undergrad- uate morals. •' The devotee of college athletics,'' says Dr. Gilchrist, \is doomed to a pretnature death; he must fall behind in his studies or else work under such a ·strain that men tal as well as phy- sical ruin is imrninent, his own moral character as well as as that of his associates must suffer, the moral and intellectual tone of his college must be lowered or at least seriously imperiled, by college athletics.'' Dr. Gilchrist holds the present college athle- tics not amateur on account of training for the events, coaches and the charging of adtnission fees to the games. ''If a man intends to devote his life to ath- . letic pursuits, and keep up his training, as he must, he will damage himself beyond repay, it is true, but the catastrophe may be somewhat delayed. He will have acquired a large heart and blood-vessels, to say nothing of lungs that are out of all proportion to any legitimate need of his body. Sooner or later aneurisn1, valvu- lar disease of the heart, pulmonary disease of various kinds, brain-leisons, hernia and other conditions are. sure to appear, and his death in all respects will be a pretnat ure one. Eut if a n1an trains three n1onths in a year, as our stu- dents do, trains as a prizefighter of a profes- sional athlete would, dropping it all at once at the close of the season, r~t~1rning to his for- mer habits of life for nine rnQnths, his life is in peril. This is in no sense a theoretical state- ment ; it is hard fact with ample proof at hand. How often have we seen young men trained in this manner taken ill with an ailment which the untrained man would take lightly, go down td death with scarcely a pretense of resistance. Suc.h work is n ·>t training, it is suicide.\ Intellectually, J)r. Gilchrist holqs training detrimental. It puts a tnan under an absolute, severe, unvarying rule of training. T~e eve- nings which shoultl be given to recreation are required for study which a tired body forbids being very productive. From the viewpoint of n1orals, even the co- eds are held to be seriously damaged by athle- ticistn. Says Dr. Gilchrist : \\Ve t?-Ot only notice a serious mortal decadence in the athle- tic himself, but to an even greater degree in . the whole student body or a sufficient number l to give character to the whole. They gradu- ally aquire a careless dress, slangy and vulgar speech and coarseness of n1anner. This is bad enough in the case of young men, but.\vhen, as in \co-educational colleges, the young women show similiar characteristics, the aspect is de- plorable. 1 have seen, and I doubt not.other colleges can duplicate it, young n1en at the thea- tre in the evening, in the presence of women, in sweaters ; seen then1 walking in the streets ,'in the same dress wlth young women and smoking a pipe ! \There is plenty of reason to hope and ex- pect a change in the present methods, '' says Dr. Gilchrist. \Those of us who have had knowledge of the hurtful character of the cus- totnary methods have something to answer for in keeping silent so long. Competition with an adversary in something that calls for mere bodily, muscular, physical endurance or capac- ity ought to be suppressed,; Gatnes of all kinds, football~ base ball, tennis, cricket, some kinds of track performances, rowing, swinl- ming, fencing, can be made perfectly satisfac- tory, if the spirit of competition can be kept out of it. Let us have our fields for games and sports of all kinds, but let it be purely amateur ; no striving for records, no contests \vith other colleges, no exhibitions, no striving to excel iu feats that none but a professional acrobat co.uld find useful ; and, above all else, no train- er:, no coach. This is not Utopian ;·it is not

Le Compte Robert de rviontesquiou- Fezensac, here to lecture on French litera- ture, met 'vith · a surprise the other day at a reception in New York. He was talking to a dainty little lady who spoke very good French. She was telling of the vast p ossi- bilities in the English language, and, neglect- ful of the fact that he in1perfectly understands the language, she gave him the following : •' A flock of girls is called a bevy, a bevy of wolves is called a pack, a pack of thieves is called a gang, a gang of angels is called a host, a host of fish is called a shoa.l, a shoal of cattle is called a herd, a herd of children is called a troop, a troop of part- tridges is called a covey, a covey of beau- ties is called a galaxy, a galaxy of ruffians is called a horde, a horde of coal is called a heap, a heap of oxen is called a drove, a drove of blackguards is called a n1ob, a mob of whales is called a school, a school of \Vorshipers is called a congregation, a congregation of engineers is called a corps, a corps of robbers is called a band, a band of locusts is called a swarm., and a swarm of people is called a crowd. M. le Compte asked the fair one to please write it out for him, as he 'vished to use a lexicon for purposes of translation. He tried it later and gave up in despair.-New York Times. A VALENTINE. Pray tell me, dear heart, of this thing called love, And what may its message mean 'Tis a rustle of angels' wings from above, A glimpse of the golden sheen, Reflected from countless glories there In the land where we never have been. \Vhere the .grand halls ring as the bright host sing Of the land so fair, of its grass so green, Of its flowers rare, of its perfumed air, The land that we ne'er have seen. Believe me, dear heart, that this thing called love Is written ·in every line Of the songs of the angels far above, And deep in this heart of mine, And it is for thee to read thro' the door Of my heart all its letters fine, And give n1e the bliss of a joy like this Of the happier shore where the angels shine,.

) THE CONCORDIENSIS. 15 BEING A GOOD FELLOW. Any sensible young 111an ought to know that he can't be up late nights abusing his stomach and be in full possession of his faculties for business the next day, says the Toledo Bee. And he ought to know, also, that a n1an n1ust be clear-headed and in full possession of his faculties to hold his own in the keen con1peti- tion of life. Your \good fello\v \ is popular for the time being, but when his .money is gone and he has lost his job and is on his uppers the \good fellow \ business doesn't get hin1 any- thing. It's ''poor fellow'' then. Another good n1an gone wrong, and'' the boys'' are ready to hail another ''good fello\v\ who has the price. \Ve don't mean by this to say that \the boys\ are mercenary. They don't altogether pass up a \ good fellow '' when he goes broke, but it isn't the same. They say he hit the booze too· hard and couldn't stand the pace. 1,hey feel sorry for him, but he is out of it. His good fellowship doesn't excus~ him even in the eyes of his friends for having thrown away his opportunity. The young n1an who gets the sleep his sys~ tern needs, is temperate in his habits, lives within his n1eans and shows up for work in the n1orning \vith a clear eye and active brain- that's the n1an business men are looking for. They want en1ployes who1n they can trust. !laving worked hard and laid by acotnpetence, they \vaut to throw some of the burdens off and they won't throw the1n off on the e1nploye who is too rnuch of a ''good fellow.\ Cut it out, boys. There's nothing in it. There's a whole lot of nonsense in that \good fellow'' business. Yon can't fool the public very long by living beyond your means and keeping up appearances. 1.,here n1ust be a show-down sotne ti1ne or other, and that n1eans a loss of 5elf-respect and 1nany bitter experi~ ences. A_ll n1en will think more of you if you hold yourself in and don't try to live a w·ine ex· stence on a beer income. lVIany a bright and pron11s1ng business mart has failed because he tried to travel in too swift a class, whereas, had he lived within his means, he rnight :have becon1e a highly successful mer- chant. The \Vorld doesn't give up its treasures easily. It isn't in the cards for all of us to be million- aires, and mighty few of the ''good fellows\ get into that class. It's better to earn your way first and go hunting for good tilnes, when you have reached the point where you can spare both the tin1e and the rnoney. Then, possibly, you'll have n1ore sense and have a different notion about what a good time is. - C:tCi'P' . IS ~· \\DifflgrGnG~ '[he I)atton l-Iall Stores SELL THE BE::-3T t;IIOES.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. XXVI. UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 18, 1902. No. 17. THE NEW ELECTRI1CAL COURSE. 'fhe reasons which led me to undertake the organization and direction of the Electrical Engineering course of Union College were that the conditions here are unusually favorable for an electrical engineering school superior to any, due to the old and well-established reputation of the College in engineering education and the proxilnity and favorable disposition of the largest electrical manufacturing company, which affords the students chances to see and familiarize themselves with apparatus and re- ceive information which no other electrical en- gineering school could offer. While the electrical laboratory, after being refitted, will not be as large as th_e laboratories of so1ne other colleges, after all a large and well-fitted laboratory, however desirable and useful, is usually vastly over-rated in its in1por- tance, and it is not the laboratory which tnakes the success of an engineering school but the teaching force, directly by their work and in- directly by the educational policy of the insti- tution inspired by their co-operation. After all, in the General Electric Co.'s works, which are open to the students, Union College has an electrical laboratory vastly greater than the the electrical laboratories of all the colleges of the world combined • Regarding the educational policy of an en- gineering school, the opinions are divided be- tween those who desire to make the college a training school for specialists and those who endeavor to give a general all-around education leading up to specialization in the art chosen by the students. Theoretically the former is . correct and four years by no means too long a time to be devoted to engineering studies. However, the first condition which the college should fulfill is to turn out educated men and not mere trained artisans. To devote the total college course to engineering studies therefore pre-supposes that the general culture studies required for any educated man are completed w:hen entering the college. l3ut neither graduation from the modern Hi:gh School nor the entrance conditions of the col- lege comprise a sufficiency of general culture studies, and the1·efore a part of the college year tnust be devoted to then1, if graduat.ion from the college should be a qualification of educated men. This broad educational policy has always been a feature of Union College and will remain so, and I even hope that with the complete establishment of the new course it will be feasible to increase the an1oun t of general culture studies and at the same tirne increase the :&pecial engineering studies while still decreasing the work which is required from the students, by the increased efficiency resulting frotn the increased teaching force. The first two years of the courses are es- . sentially devoted to general culture studies, as languages, literature, logic and composition, history of tnan and natural history, biology, etc. Only such general engineering studies as tnathetnatics and mechanics, which must be farniliar before engineering work can be under- taken, are included in the first two years. 1\'he last two years are devoted essentially to special engineering studies. The foun da- tion of electrical engineering is mechanical \ -..~ ; .. \ engineering, and while a young electrit£1-e·n· gineer can11ot be expected to be fully familiar with all branches of electrical engi11iering, he must be fauiiliar with the fundam~P:j~l prin- 1 I : t ciples of mechanical engineering. :a:~~ce the ,. Junior year will be largely devoted to.~e~hani·. · .· ' . .

'fhe Senior year and a part of the Junior year will be devoted to electrical engineering. The eotnplete course ·will be published shortly in the University c. ~alogue, so it n1ay te sufficient here to say that it will give a thorough grounding in the funda1uental prin- ciples and their application to all branches of electrical engineering, such as will enable the graduate rapidly to acquire the practical experience necessary to electrical engineering success. A Post-Graduate Course in Electrical En- gineering has been established, ·which when ootnpletely organized will give advanced in- structions, comprising many subjects which, while of fundamental importance in the lnod- ern developn1en t of Electrical Engineering, are not taught by any college, hardly not even published yet. It is such knowledge which establishes engineering reputations. It is not sufi1cient for an electrical engineer who desires to reach high positions to be able to solve ninety~nine out of one hundred problems which he n1eets in practice, but it is the solu- tion of the one hundredth problen1, where everybody else fails, which establishes the reputation of the engineer and raises him to positions where he can leave the solution of the other ninety-nine problems to his sub- ordinates. CHARLES p. STEINr-.IETZ. February 14th, I 903. CHI PSI ALUMNI B\'~NQUET. Held at the TenEyck.

The committee in charge, after much care and deliberation, se- lected \.A Red Letter Day,\ a roaring four act comedy. It is a capital play, abounding in ludicrous situations and fun~provoking dialogue, and is warranted to keep an au- dience convulsed with ·laughter. A party of country people who have been playing cards together for a year have accumulated a fund by the contribution of a . shilling each every night they played. The action opens on the evening that they are to decide what is to be done with this fund. Laura Bunce, a spinster lady, one of the party, receiving a reply to a matri- monial advertisement which she had insert-· ed in a London paper, persuades the others to use the rnoney on a trip to London, where the party m.eet with a series of ·most }udicrous adventures, and are finally taken for a band of pickpockets and sent to prison. On the way they effect their escape. On repairing to the house of the matrimonial a.gent to keep her appointment she is to her in. tense dis- gust introduced to Mr. Higgins one of their own party and a very sentimental old gentle- man. 1.,he n1atrimonial ~gent, hoping to please her, then presents another aspirant, Captain Graham, the police officer who had sent them to prison. He recognizes the whole party and is about to re-arrest them when the tim.ely arrival of Fe1 ix sets: 1natters right. Reading rehearsals have been carried on for the past week. rfhese rehearsals will be suspended for one week. At the end of this time every applicant is expected to have cotnmitted his. lines. Rehearsals on delivery and dramatic action will then begin. Nearl~ the complete casts are filled but no part is secured. All parts are still open and candidates solicited. It will be quite necessary for all candidates to have their lines by Tuesday, February 24. So far the parts to be filled and the appli- cants for the same are as follows. Theophilus Bunce, A Man of Ideas, S. B. Howe, Jr. Christopher Corker, an ex-farmer, Cool, Wright. Henry Higgins, Village apothecary, Pal- mer, Hall. Adolphus, Corker's son, ~1cCom bs, Guard- . enter.

Last Friday evening, (!t Fort Edward, oc- curred the closest and most exciting game of basket ball that Union has participated in thus far this season, when she met defeat at the hands of the Satterlee Hose basket ball team by the close score of 24 to 20. Altho circumstances caused the non-ap- pearance of two of our regular players,. captain Anderson and guard Gagen, every one of the Union men deserve great credit for their individual playing. It was lack of team work owing to the absence of two of the varsity and not the lack of good indivi- dual playing that caused Union's defeat. Handicapped as they were, the college men kept the final result in doubt by throwing , basket for basket, foul for foul, until gong sounded at the end of the second half. 1'he game in detail was as follows : In the first ten minutes of playing Fort Edward scored 8 points ; then Union, who had up to this tin1e been playing entirely on the defensive, suddenly assumed the aggressive with such success that the score stood 11 to 1 o in her favor at the end of the first half. The second half was just as close and ex- citing. for up to the last two minutes of playing the score was 20 to 20. Then, amid wild , excitment, Fort Edward threw two baskets, thus winning the game.

The committee in question has done everything in its power to bring this desirable end about, and we take this opportunity to apologise · to its members for the statement. Soir~e. It is to be hoped that the students will do everything in their power to make the soiree a success. The Committee has per· formed with great faithfulness an unusually diffi· cult task in c01npleting arral)gements and should have the loyal support of the rest of the college. '' Side talks with young men.\ A word needs to be spoken again with reference to the college meetings held :Monday mornings. It seems that many students are in the habit of boldng that hour in order to get up some work or from some other lazy motive, for it all ~comes to that eventua'lly. It is merely a different -m~nifestation of the same spirit, or rather lack of spirit, which causes men to be remiss in the payment of their subscriptions and 'in attendance upon othe.r college gatherings. It :is impossible to say to a man, \you must go to college meeting,\ \you must pay your subscription at on.ce,\ or '' you must attend baseball, track, musi· cal and dramatic practice,\ until a healthy spirit of co-operation is aroused in each man. The upper classes as a. ,rule realize this and it is no less true that many under-classmen are conspicuously faithful in their du .. ties to the college body of which they are memb.ers. If these men would endeavor to use whatever influ- ence they possess in promoting a better college spirit the best results will be quickly and surely achieved • Of course conditions are not very bad, nor are college men elsewhere much more interested in such matters than are we at Union, but this does not in the least affect the present status. ''Let everyone do his best:\ is a familiar and useful motto in the present instance. DELTA PHI SlVIOKER.

, .. .'. THE OONOO·RDIEN.SIS. 11 UNIO·N COLLEGE, BY DR. WELLS. As I \vas looking over some of the old maga- zin.e articles the other day, I happened to come across a volume of Scribner's magazine, issu- ed in 1876, in which appeared an article on Union college by Dr. 'Veils, now Prof. Emeri- tus of German in Union College. A brief re- view of the article, should be interesting to all lovers of Old ·union and of \Uncle Bitly.'' Dr. Wells begins by giving a description of the beautiful situation of the college, saying that \1\'he outlook from the college terrace over the rich valley of the 1iohawk, and the mountain spurs that adorn the conrse, is one of rare beauty, and is imprinted for life on the memory of those who have seen it.'' 'l'he means by which the college was first established , is then given. Dr. 'Vells says \A few of the solid n1en of Schenectady, of the old Dutch stock, had been developing a literary life in the form of an institution for the cultivation of literary investigation and debate, and the found- ing of an academy of a higher order for the .careful classical and scientific training of the young. It was seen that this schoo:I \Vould fonn a fine nucleus for the proposed college, and a dozen of the prominent citizens of Schenectady, backed by over one hundred from other portions. ,,of the state, petitioned the Board of Regents to grant them a charter for the foundatio-n of a college and pledged them- . selves, in case their request was granted, to aid the new enterprise with purse and influence, and accordingly the Regents granted them a college charter, dated February 25th, I 795, and signed by George Clinton, chancellor, and De- Witt Clinton, secretary.'' The first commcncetnent of Union College was held in May, 1797, in the Old Dutch Church, an historical monun1ent which was long since demolished. T'hree men cotnposed the gradu- ting class. The number of graduates increas- ed with great rapidity, until it exceeded one hundred per annun1. In x8o4, Eliphalet N ott was called to the Presidency. It was through Dr. Nott that Union College obtained the spacious site now occupied by the ·college. The faculty were chosen frotn amo11g the very first scholars and educators of the land, an1.ong whom were :Francis 'Vayland and Alonzo Potter. · The school of engineering was founded in 1845· rrhe developnlent and efficiency of this branch of the institution are largely due to the rare learnh1g and accomplishments of Prof. vVilliatn H. Gillespie, who continued to be its leading spirit until his death. The Sen1i-Centennial of the college in 1845, was celebrated with great pon1p. Dr. Hickok succeeded Dr N ott as President. This responsible position he held for two years, when he resigned on account of old .age. Dr. Aiken of Princeton college was then made President and held that of1ice for two years, at the end of which time he resigned on account of illness in his fatnily. Eliphalet N ott Potter succeeded Dr. Aiken. Dr. 'Vells says that \the solid foundation for n1enH)rial Hall was laid SOUle time before the war, by the aid of generous contributions from some of the alumni. Various untoward events interfered with its erection while the massive walls, just towering above the level of the campus, were a continual ren1inder of unfulfilled plans. As this enterprise was the one especially un- dertaken by the Alumni, it was thought to be appropriate to the new life to begin the work of it, without delay.\ The work then was soon begun. Dr. 'Yells mentions the fact that at this time (1876) the Union College gymnasium was the largest, it is believed, connected \vith an An1erican college. At the time of this writing Union had a ]Mil- itary Department, \Vhich was in cl1arge of a U. S. Army officer, a graduate of \Vest Point, and· a member of the artillery corps. Dr. Wells says \The department was established here,

An inexpensive fatigue uniform has been adopted, and great interest is tnani- fested in the regttlar drills. The physical disciplinary and other results fully justify the faculty in considering this experitnent a suc- cess.'' At the suggestion of 'Villiatn H. Seward a dual body known as the Senate and House .of Representatives, was organized in 1he Senior and Junior classes for Parlia1nentary Debate. \1'his body has familiarized many a future legislator with the practical· n1achinery of legislation. 1\tlr. se,vard himself aided in its organization and spoke several times at its an- niversaries. 'fhe AI ph a chapter of N. Y .. of Phi Beta Kappa was founded here in 181 7.\ Dr. \Vells tells us a story of Dr. Nott told by son1e old alumnus. \Dr. N ott was him- self very intimate with the boys and the most famous of the many stories of Dr. 'N ott is the following : One night the Doctor's hen roost \vas unusually noisy. Concerned abou~ his p~ultry, he hastened out in dressing gown and slippers in tin1e to surprise certain dis- guised figures, which quickly vanished, leav- ing a few of his choicest fowls beheaded. The Doctor had a rnagic way of finding out evil doers, and he soon discovered these. But instead of taki11g off their heads in turn, he invited them to dinner the ne:xt day, and feasted them on the fowls with whose necks they had made free the night before. 'I'he Doctor made no allusion to the occurrence, · trusting that every n1outhful of the contra- band chicken would stick in t_he throat, to teach them a better lesson than any he could convey in words. When the meal was finished, the boys were politely bowed out, firmly re- solved never again to prepare for themselves so uncomfortable a meal. The culprits never heard the last of ' Prex 's Chickens.' \ THE.LEGEND OF·M. MARIN. Near the bank of a wide, slow-flowing river, in one of our Southern States, there stand the ruins of an old colonial house. Once with wide halls and s~ately porticos ; it is now only a heap of ruins, the hahlnt of lizards and other reptiles in the daytime and of owls and bats at night. :From the centre of the ruins spring-s a full-grown gum tree, whose branches have felt their way through the openings in the brick walls ; which used to serve the purpose of windows but now n1erely stare like en1 pty eye-sockets in to the thickets which surround these relics of a dwelling. A short walk into the woods to the west of the house brings one to a curious looking mound. It is taller than a man's head, and shaped very symmetrically, and is compara- tively small in circumference. At this point the woods are very wild ; various vine growths make the way almost impassible while the sqle1nn gray moss overhead ob- scures almost all sunlight. From the side of the mound springs a perfectly formed cedar tree and its base is hidden by a tangle of . vtnes. The mound is a grave. The legend of that my,sterious ton1b ·has been handed down for generations. It is as follows: At the beginning of the eighteenth cen\' tury the house was inhabited by an old Frenchman, one M.. Marin, who fled from France, with his little daughter, at the tilne of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. His wife had suffered the fate of a Huguenot. IIaving purchased the house of an unsuc_ cessful rice-planter, M. Marin settled 'down to live in a very simple and quiet manner. His house, the ruins of which we have already spoken, \Vas situated in a sparsely populated neighbot-hood, there being no one, except a few slaves, within a radius of five miles. 1'he refugee's one aim in life' was to bring •

• j I I THE ,cONCORDIENSIS. 13 happiness to his daughter Cecily. rfhe years passed peaceably enough. M. Marin grew a little more feeble and his hair was now snowy white. Cecily, grown from a playful child, to full wotnanhood, \:vas her father's ideal. And well she n1ight have been. She was beautiful in every sense of the word. I~ the spring of the year 1707 a party of foreigners landed near M. Marin's ho-me. They seemed refined in appearance and speech. and the r~fugee, noted for his hospitality, in- vited them to his house. 1.,hey were reported to be frotn the West India Islands. One of their party being ill,:nothing would please M:He, Cecily's sympathetic nature but that she should nurse him. M. Marin reluctantly gave his consent. But the man did not recover, he had brought the yellow death with him unawares, and on the second day after his arrival he died. His companions, realizing the worst, fled. :h1admoiselle Cecily fell sick with the scourge and in a few days she too succumbed. Her father went mad. ruins of the house will have mouldered and rotted away and the legend of the Marins will be forgotten forever. CA!v!PUS NOTES. Mrs A. V. V.

He did not even want her to be down ; therefore, having selected a wild spot, he stoo_d the coffin on end and piled earth around it, all the while crooning to himself and muttering his daugh- ter's na·me. His work being completed, he calmly drew a long keen knife fron1 beneath his coat and plunged it into his heart. He fell without a cry . That was long ago. 'The grave of the unfortunate Mlle. Cecily is ~ow the haunt of the night birds. A few more years and the Theodore De L. Coffin, 'o2, is superintend- ing the construction of cable towers on the islands in the upper Mohawk. for the Hudson Power Company, and finds time frotn his arduous duties to visit friends on the hill occasionally.

- THE CONCORDIENSIS. VESPER SERVICE. Professor Hoffman spoke at the Vesper Ser- vice last Sunday afternoon. He asked the question \What particular idea that we have in our minds is the problem of the twentieth century?\ Every period in the world's history has a task. \Vhen there was no man but an age of material things the task was shnple. The thing became more complex when n1an came upon earth. 'fhe task then was how things could be adapted to the developtnent of persons. In Plato's tin1e sla~ery was es- sential for the ongoing of events. The object of labor was for the good of the wise and philosophers. The task of that age was to develop a few philosophers. \Vhen Jesus came, he held man as a direct object and every- one as a brother. It took a few centuries to develop this idea, namely, that of putting value on every human being. But it took a long time for men to understand that we must find freedon1 of thought within ourselves ; that man is not only valuable, but what is in • Sophomore • • • SozJ/ee • • • - Friday, Februarv the twe-;ztieth\ I90J.

In this age there is a great search for things and :every n1an tries to surround himself with material things. Therefore the dominant task is the developtnent of tnan to the highest pitch of perfection. All tnaterial things must be used for the furtherance of this purpose. vVe must use our wealth for the good of humanity-· for the good of n1an hilnself-the nobler n1an, and not for the satisfaction of worldly desire. Jesus said v~·e n1ust rise higher, becvn1e 1nore like God-· be great in the de veloptnent of aU our powers, and grow tnore and n1ore into the likeness of God. . IS SELL THE BESH ~I-IOES.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VoL. xx-vi. UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 25, 1902. \'No. 18. ALLISON-F·OOTE DEBATE. The Phliomatheans Win the Day. Mr. John A. Bones the Lucky Man. The annual Allison-Foote Prize De bate, be- t\veen the Philotnathean and the Adelphic Literary Societies, took place in the State Street lVIethodist Episcopal church of Schenec- tady, on Monday evening of this week. The instrun1entai clubs furnished delightful music for the occasion. The speaking was well attended by the townspeople. 1\'he Judges of award were: Hon. vVilliam E. \Verner, Judge of the Cou.ct of Appeals ; Hon. Alden Chester, Associate Justice of Appelate Division of the Supreme Court, and Mr. 'V. L. R. En1mett of Schenectady. At the close of the de bate, after a brief re- tiretnent, the judges announced their decis- ion in favor of the Philornathean Society, the negative side of the question, and in favor of John A. Eolles of the Adelphics, as the indi- vidual debater who tnade the best single speech regardless of his society relation. Each prize was the sutn of $so. The question for debate was : Resolved, \That the present tendency in co-operative action in industry and con1merce leads to so- cialism,\ the town socialism being in general understood to be a social order, in which pro- duction and distribution are controlled by the will of the community, and not by the free action of individuals under competition. The Adelphics took the affirmative side, and were represented by George W. Donnan, Glowacki, Parker and John A. Bolles all 1903. The Philon1atheans, who. defended the negative side, were as follows : Samuel B. Howe, Jr., Lewis 1\'. Hunt, Joseph G. Fenstel', all tgo 3 . President Ray n1ond presided and introduced the presidents of the two societies, who in turn introduced the speakers of their respective society. G·eorge W. Donnan spoke :first for the affir- n1ative, and s2dd in part that the will .of the people was expressed, not according to schetnes of socialistic .refortn, but according to a great systern of commerce ; great capital and trusts were the wonders of the age. The promise of the times foreshadowed greater advance;. the rapid growth of con1mercialis1n foretold such speedy co-operations as would rival the dreams of a Morgan or a Rockefeller. We should not approve of theoretical socialism, but the development of the trust question in.- to socialism ; indus try follows political devel- oprnen t, as is shown in history. Industrial socialism has developed, begin- ning with the slave, then the serf condition, until finally wages came into vogue. The spirit of the political is reflected back on the socialistic. The trust will centre in itself all industrial power and grow into a co1nmercial system like England, but it will not savor of anaJchism. Under the will of the people we may enjoy the utmQst freedon1 of action consistent with the rights of others. Samuel 13. Howe, Jr., spoke first for the Philomatheans. lie said in part : \Every act must have its motive, there must be the will to do, this is a well-known psychological fact. lf we can determine what motives are back of the present tendency to- 'vard co-operation in industrial enterprises, then its relation to socialism is indubitably es- tablished. \Can the affirrnative allege that the capita ... list is amassing his resources to turn over th~

THE CONCORDIEN'SIS. means of production to others? His motive is purely and largely selfish. '''In 19:01 only eight per cent of the total number of workingmen were enrolled in labor U n~ons, and allowing the liberal increase of two per cent since tl1at time, we can now say that oni y two per cent are in Unions. I refer you to such pu blicati:ons as those of the Schen- ectady Trades Assembly. \'Labor unions represent heterodox. socialis- tic ideas. K.arl Marx, as a chief representative of one school declares for the abolition of classes. Away with governments, the agents of the capital class. 'The Union leaders in adopt- ing his views are departing from the true ideal of socialism. So we affirm that the present tendency toward co-operation among the laboring class is far from a step toward a Socialistic system of government. '' When the laboring man 1s held down we cannot have a socialistic state, for socialism preaches an equality ; capital reduces men to an inequality. These two things are as far apart as night from day. Does the capitalist use his great influence to enfranchise the labor- ing class and grant the beginning of a glorious reign of labor? We have proved that this is not the case. The second speaker for the Adelphics was Glowacki :Parker, who said in part : \We have simply to show that the present tendency in co-operative action in industry and commerce is toward socialism. Socialism does uot necessarily suggest anarchy and lawless- ness. A clear and concise n1eaning is that given in our definition, that socialism is to be understood to be a social order in which pro- duction and distribution are controlled by the \vill of the community and not by the free ·action of individuals under competition. Bear this definition in mind. '' 'rhe developtnent of our forefathers' in- dependence was a glorious succession of tri- umphs for liberty, each triumph being a step to\vard sociali&m. In each case the cause of uprising was the final result of too great con- centration of power. In the end the power was shifted from the few to the many. ''So is it in the United States. Popular election of senators is now clamored for, and the civil service extends its branches to all peo:pl:e. ~he mechanic can rise to a position of power. '' The concentration of power is radically opposed to socialism. We do not predict the ()verthrow of the trust, but that its bene- fits 'vill be distributed.'' Lewis 'f'. Hunt next upheld the negative, and said that his worthy opponents had neither de- fended socialisn1 nor stated its advantages. Socialism was not a new thing, he said, but had arisen in France years before ; it had come up and gone down and was again revived in 1848 by Karl Marx. If the will of any com- nlUlJ.ity were to be expressed in any act, cer- tain 1y it must be only through government. According to socialists, government was of, for and by socialists, but, the speak~r said, there was no tendency toward that end. '' Is this great middle class of honest wagers in the ranks of the socialists ? Rather it has attracted to its ranks mostly men out of a job ; men opposed to law and order, who want only riot and tunnoil. \The tendency to amass great wealth into the hands of a few is a ·ground on which mod- ern socialism places great hope. The rich are to get richer, but the poor are still in better condition. The great middle class is content- ed and does not want socialism. This social- ism like many isms will pass away and other ism will come to the front. The last speaker for the Adelphics was J obn A. Bolles, who said : '' A startling change has come in the last de\' cade, the formation of trusts. Their object is to secure greater regularity e>f products and uniformity of prices. It is a question with some whether socialism can develop. Shall r .:: . ~ <';'l, ! ;, ·,' l :)~! r il· ' ,, . ' ~· I , I

'l it be organized governm·ent or organized capi- tal? \The fact of the matter is that 'Competition : is tbe individualist way of doing business and combination is the socialistic way. The trust is a confirmation of socialistic tendencies. By concentration of capital the cost of production may be considerably lessened. ~ . ''Democracy, the master of the civiiized world, is dependent upon wage labor. We are now ready for an economic transformation. Can any man doubt that our descendents will demand an organized governtnen t instead of an organized capital ? ''vVhat socialism needs is system such as the trust provides. Government control is now carried on in great Britian. 339 municipalities are involved in government control. The ae- tion of President Roosevelt in the recent coal strike, is a significant fact of the tendency to- ward government control. In such a contention as this fifty years ago, between labor and cap- ital, the president would not have dared to in- terfere; nay rather, he would not have thought. of it as his right. ''In conclusion, I shall quote the utter~ a11ce of another, that ' the future belongs to the perfect socialistn., \ Joseph G. r~\enster was the last speaker on the negative side. He said that socialism must be considered according to the n1eans of production. There are two kinds of n1onopo- lies, natural and artificial. England at pre- sent owns its own telegraph and telephone sys- tems; Gern1any her gas wells, and France her . 1111nes. Siegel Cooper owns n1ore capital than tnany natural monopolies, but it is an artificialtnono- poly. Natural monopoly would not tend to- ward socialism itself, as these natural resources cannot be n1onopolized. '\fhe tendency is not toward common owner- ship, the speaker declared, but toward the gov .. ernmental regulation of commerce.

1\HE OO·NOORDIENSIS. ll --------------------'-----------'--'\---'------.------~----·---~~----~---- SPEECH BY THE HON. CHARLES EMORY SMITH. Union College Chapel, Scbene.ctady,N .. Y., February 20, 1903. 1\rlr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:-· It gives n1e great pleasure to come to these familiar halls, to come into this chapel to which I used to come every morning with the irregularity which I hope you sti11 ob- serve, to look into these buildings which live so well in my memory. I think you shout better than we did in my day. I do not know whether you are prouder of your college and drink its inspiration more deeply than we did, but it cer- tainly stirs emotions ':vithin me which you can well under- stand, to come back here after so many years' absence, and look again into these familiar scenes. We are assetnbled to-day very close to the anniversary of the birtll.day of \Vashington, and while our hearts are still throbbing with the sentiments awakened by the birth- day of Lincoln. \Vashington and Lincoln are the promi- nent and canonized Ame.ricans whose natal days are fitly commemorated by the nation itself. The glowing jubilee of Independence brings the mid-summer reviYal of patriot- ism and these closely concurring anniversaries, each deep- ening the in1pression of the other, quicken the n1id-winter awakening of American devotion and aspiration. The sentiment ()f patriotism enshrines itself in the supreme crisis of its trial and triumph, and in its supreme personal types. We Americans instinctively turn to the two master epochs and the two master eras of our history. Each of these epochs developed illustrious leaders. The Revolutionary and Constructive period was dis- tinguished by a remarkable group of men who have been the marval of the world. Alexander llamilton was un- rivaled in creative insight a:nd genius. Jefferson had con- summate political instinct and mastery. Adams had fer· vid allegiance and inspired faith. Franklin had philosophic penetrati()n and grasp. Jay had purity of character and ' elevation of the soul. Madison had pure judgment and practical skill. But great as all these men were in their individual and in their united str~ngth they all bowed to the unquestioned ascendency of that overpowering chief, whose awe-inspiring personality dominated every council, whose wisdom guided every policy, and whose majestic character was the rock of national faith. And so the work for the Union, and the great struggle preparatory to it, gleamed with a constellation of stars. There was Seward, the illustrious graduate of this colleget with his long leadership, his acute vision and his trained statecraft. There was Chase with his robust figure and great ambition. There was Stanton, with his ambitious ardor and tireless energy and organizing genius. 'I'hete was Sumner with his proud and conscious scholarship, with his in1passioned eloquence and with his moral force. There was Douglas whc was the very Prince Hupert of America, and the sworn patriot of the most turLulant part of our Natiunal II isto1-y. There was Grant, with ltis con- quedng armies of the fieM. But out of the \Yest, un- trained save ilil the dash o( stump debate, untutored ex- cept in the strength of his o\vn great soul, came the (;od- given Chieftain to whom the ac1.nowledged princes of oratory and of statesmanship were often to yield the sceptre of indisputable supren1c::.cy, and whose indomitable faitl1 and sublime inspirati01~ l1avea!most divine prescien~e, and have been expressed in giving the language a glowing star of Liberty's march and triumphant progress. And so in the incarnation of patriotism. we come every year witl1 our never-ending hom~1ge at tihe shrine of \Vashingtvn, the founder of the Republic-, and Lincoln, the saviour of the U niun. And at this time iu connection \'r'ith the anniversaries, I have thought it not inappropria.te to say something to you respecting the opportunities which you have in this country, and of the proportions to which our country has grown, of the spirit w1;ich animates it and its government, and of the greatne~:s ()[ the destiny which lies before it. It is your great good fortnne, ycung gentlemen, that yo11 live in the age of unequalled opportunities, and that the demand for intellectual actidty and expert knowledge and trained capacity has ne\rer been as great and wide as it is now, and that the opportunities for distinction and sncct:ss have never been as .great as they are now. A half a century ago the only open field practkeble for intellectual effort, outside of the pul}Jit, were the law and public life. '1 he quality and the aren;t of th.e otl1er professions were still behind the veil. Stil:l more behind the veil were those extraordinary opportunities in connection with the material forces which ha:te come in our day. Then joarnalism was little more than mere political pamphleteering. The great- est commerce of our nation at that day, was never more than mere barter and trade ; but now, behold the wide op- portunities open to ) ou ! Behold the intricate network· of rail ways with its unlimited.. ,field for the genius of organiza- tion and command ! Behold the entrancing beauties of the Magic \Vhite City of I 893, or the radiant Electrical City of rgor, resplendent beyond the dreams of Greece or Rome, with their ill ustnttions (if the glories of modern ~rchitectnre ~ Debold the tmver of Eiffel or llrooklyn bridge, with their exhibit of the amazing resources of modern engineering ! Behold the wonders of the hulllan voice which speaks half- way across the continent and aU the marvels of the civilized world, anJ the subtle and mighty forces which, touched by the magic wand of an Edison or a Tesla or a Marconi, have beeome the famHiar factors of our everyday life. Behold the colossal enterprises and the gigantic combina- tions with their tremendous influence and their demand for the most expert a-nd trained knowledge, which illustrate all the genius, the penetration, the grasp, and the daring of our modern business life, As you contemplate this field with its opportunity for advancement, you see that it

V\' e haYe a Ugher Jt:yd of living and intelli- :~~nce. \Ye have a freer sc0pe for inteliectual action, and larger opportun itics in every direction. These inherited possessions all distinct and clearly Lld!ned, we say it in no boastful sp.il.it, have put our country in tl·e van of the world. The curre11ts of modern aJ.v.mce are especially de- terndncd ir1 this great American Republic, the pride of this 6reat \Vestern Hemisphere. The foundations of our republic \Ve1·e laid at a time when the conditions were reckoning for the political and intt!llectual etnancipa• tivn of mankind, and intdlectualliberation, and with the p·.:!rsonal frtt_~dom and the mental stimulus which it brought about, there came that devt:!opment of foHn or of the ma• teriat force ·which changed our whole ~od.tl life and indus- trial fabric. On the material side the \Vorld had been at a standstill for two thousand years. \\l-en J obn Adams start- ed for M asEachu~etts and Thomas Jefferson started from Vkginia to meet in InJcpendence Hall in l 1 hiladelphia·; ·what came to be known as Independence Hall, they h~d no m.eans of traveling any faster than the members of the ctiUJJhyction1c council of Greece v.-ho m~t in the temple at Delhi five hundred years before the Christian era. \Vhen Geor~·e \\'ashington rctir~d to his estate at r ... 1 ount Vernon he l1ad no other implements for tilling the soil than CincinM n.atu::; had when he returned to his farm When Martha W ashingt011. sat down to spin she had exactly the same kind of a distaff which Penelope used to distructthe attention and repel the ad ':ances of her ardent suitors during the absence of Ulysses in the dim and misty twilight with which tradi· tion surrounds the history of three thousund years ago. Jf these material forces which have reached such an ad- vanc~d stage in the v\'orld did not come because of the establishment of the American RepubHc, they came in a pr<>vidential way almost contemporaneously with it as H tl1ey were just fitted together in the progress of mankind. Do you happen to remember that the spinning-mule which performed all the manufacture, was invented the very night that the De(;Jaration of 1 ndependence was signed; that the power loo1n which had such a permttnent influence upon the industrial progress of the world was invented on the very night that the Constitution was framed: that the cot- ton gin which became so useful, especially in the South- ern section of our country, in the cotton industry, that the cotton gin 'vas invented on the yery night that \'Vashing· ton entered his se9ond term. }~nlton's first steam boat rippled the tranquil waters of yonder Hudson for the first time in the very year that Thomas Jefferson was swallowing his own scruples and confounding the first constitution mongers with his acqu:. ------- si ti.on of Louis iann.. T'he first r<t\Hroao came Totty years afttr our con5-:titution wrrs fr::.med : the f.rst teleg:raph fifty years ; and these, or most of these, m1d the gt·eater part o'f the subsequent development of the mate ri~d forc~s. were restd 1·s of Am ericcm ge,rlius. N<Ow ·these mateda:l forces in their app1ied form, energized by the ·geni'Us of our people and the character of our free institutions, had given this Republic a growth absolutely nnpm~:tleUed. The wor:d has never before seen 8ny nation of sach prominence spring ·up wit·hin a hundred years.. 1\ay, rnore; the w<:>rld has never anywhere else perceived the s.atne.- proportionate strength of development, the effeet of tl1e s<ttne forces, to such a gigantic gro\vth as has be-~n seen here. This is not the tim~, I believe, to un·dertake to su n1 up our extra- ordinary industrial and comm-ercial acllievennents, but one or two snap shots taken as vte go along may help our put- pose to appreciate the extraordinary cl1a.racter of this work and to npprecinte the extraordinary charncterof this growth and to form some estimate of the great distinction which lies before us. This growth has mostly come within tbe last thirty years. Thirty years ago the total value of (:Ur maP...tlfactured pro- ducts in this country was equal to that of England. To- day they are nearly three times as great as those <>f Eng- land. That total value is equal to the total value of the manufactures of Engbnd, France and GcFmany~ put to· gether. ~More than that,- in these last few· years the in- crease in their growth has been hvice as great as the combined increase in the growth of the manufac· tures of those three great commercial powaers of Europe, so that if to-day you were to match the United States against England, France and Germany together, we are equal to all of them combined in our manufactured pro- ducts, and we are growing twice as fast. Is it any won- der that the world wonders at our extraordinary growth and asks when this American growth and A.merican inven- tion are to end. \Ve are to-day manufactul'ing more than two-thirds as much as all Europe with :its four hundred millions of population. \Vhat of the future? Is tbe growth to continue? Think of the achievements. \Yhat are tbey? ls it raw material? \Vithout stopping to run over that question to any extent, Itt me ask your attention to oEe or two illus- rations. Take coal, the foundation of i11.dustry. Ger· many has 3,ooo square miles of coal fields ; England has 9,300 square miles. How does this compare with the United States when you stop to reflect that we have not 3,ooo square miles,-not 9,300 square miles.,.-but 2oo,ooo square miles of coal; or if you limit it to that quality of coal which enters into the production of iron and steel, the great bases of industry, we still have 7o,coo square miles, or 2o,ooo square miles more than the entire area of Eng- land? Is it productive capacity? \Ve can make answer in the single statement that, with our superior equipment and with our higher skill, illustrated in these g1:eat works

TIIE CONCOI~DIENSIS.. 13 which have grown up in this city of Scher:\ectady, we can beat Europe in the contest to the ratio of four to one; in other words, the productions of the United States for one year, according to statistics, are equal to those of Europe ht four years. Is it the financial power which organizes and energizes its industr,ial activities ? Consider for a moment the culrninative force of the single fact that last year the earnings of the United States, the total earnings of the United States, the earnings of labor and capital to· gether, were equivalent to more than one-l1alf of the entire wealth ol this country just thirty years ago. That is, the earnings of this country for one single year were equal to Il10re than one-half of all that had been made and saved and stored up and put into aH forms of property., into farms., into stores, into residences, into banks, into rail- roads, and every form of property during the first eighty years of our existence as a nation, vYe are magnificent spenders. 'Ve are the greatest .consumers the world has ever seen. If \ve were not such magnificent spenders, there would be absolutely no limit to our growth ; but even as it is, the sun, as it rises over our eastern coast every morning and spans the great width of this Republic and sends out its setting rays across the Pacific, leaves the country $4,ooo,ooo richer and better off than it was the day before. That is the way we are growing-a growth di.ffused in limit to every class, shared by all. And with this industrial supremacy which has already been achieved, and w.ith these limits of future growth do you suppose our growth is going to stop at its present stage of develop· ment. If such has been the de\relopment of the past hun. <ired years what is to be the development of the coming centuries? Industrially speaking, we began practically thir- ty years ago undeveloped, dependent and struggling. To- day we have made a large development; we have become industrially independent, and we are literally the leaders of the world. In this growth there hac; been two stages. The first st~ge was the development of our producing power to a point where it could reach our own requirements. \Vhen \Vhen it had reached that point, so that our producing power was equal to our own demand, and so had posses- sion of our own field, then we were ready for an outward extension. And 1898 was the first year in which our manufactured exports exceeded our manufactured imports That showed we had reached and passed the turning point, that we are able to take care of our own needs and that we not only were ready to go out into the world and that w.e needed to go out into the world, because we had come to the point where we had a surplus tlmt must find some outlet. And have you stopped to think that by one of those manifold coincidences which are so luminous in ·our history, which show something more than mere hu- man wisdom, by one of those coincidences the year of 1898 witnessed our own manufactured exports go for the first time beyond our manufactured imports; and we have so demonstrated our need of goiag out h1to t11e world,every year since the Spanish vVar which was unforeseen and the unavoidable coa.s·:!qu~nccs of which brought us to that point where we secured the footholds that we needed for our commercial develo.i.Jm~nt an.d for the outlets that we needed for the pto(.Ltdng capacity that .is absolutely un- rivalled among the natirJns. !E.x.p.msion has been the la:w of our National development. \Yithout it we could not have had symmetrical g-rowth. From tl1e beg-inning of this exp:1nsion in I 803 d:)wn to the present hour there has been a growth ·in that work beyond our prevision. The first expansions were contii!uous and continental. Then we needed ro0m for a great agricultural and industrial de- velopment. Now we need the sea and sea communication~ and sea footholds for commercial communication. Our grO\vth has been on the lines of logical development. First the approx:imatc continental expansion which was needed for the upbuilding of a great indu~trial nation. Then the remoter, distant ·expansion needed to secure commercial outlets for a capacity which had grown bt.yond our consuming power. These rt:sults were not sougl1t or foreseen, but if the most prcsdent statesmanship had care· fully and deliberately planned the work, these later expan- sions could not have bem:t more opportune or better selected for our national part :in the advancement of civiliz- ation. This does not mean that our development n.-quircs more territorial acquisition or that we become a nation s~eking territori.::J.l aggrandizement. Far from it. \Ve shall not follo\\ 7 France, or England or Germany as terri· tory seekers, htlt as an equalizing po\Yer. \\ e do m.t want it, and under existing conditions we would not be likely to get it if we did want it, for the world is practically already partitioned. Asia is practically di·vided into spheres of influence outside of the nations which are self-existing-. 'The map of Africa is clearly in the same way. Central and South America are protected from Europe by the Monroe doctrine,. and· the value, the efficacy of that doct-: rine as a grand protective for the American continent, we have seen illustratetl and emphasized within the last few weeks, and for o11rselves we need nothing south of us be- yond full Pan-A.merica.n brotherhood. The nations of Europe may have their contests over their spheres of in· fluence in the hereafter, but it is a fact worthy of considera- ston, and significance in the progress of the world, that when the Philippine Islands fell from the feeble grasp of an effete empire into the lap of the united States, the fate Of the last great portion of the world's surface which was not already either divide<l or practically appropriated by some great power, was determined. Our character and our pur- pose may be and arc attested by our record. \vVe can turn to that record for our vindication. Turn for a single moment to the burning chapter of China as illustrative of the growing and command ~ng in~~ fluence of the United States and of its moral restraint. Two years ago the several powers of the 'vorld became in· volved in a cm1fiict with the great semi-civilized giant of

14: THE UONCORDIENSIS. the East over the Eoxer class. Our minister and the ministers of all the several powers were imprisoned in China,'s capital with the evil doom hanging over them. You remember how anxious we were during those long weeks of r 900. II ad that question come up five years ago, three years even before that time, the United States would have been merely a passive and helpless spectator. 'fhougli our own minister was imprisoned, we should have been dependent upon the pmvers of Europe for his rescue, and we should have had no more voioe in the determination of the questions which arose than Spain or Belgium or any other third rate power to-day. \Ve should not have been consulted by the controlling powers of E_urope as to what policy should be adopted and what course pursued, for when that embroglio did come in rgoo the United States exercised a leading part in the deter- mination of the issue. It is not too m'-~ch to say that the moral force of the United States w::1s the gre~test exercised in that great issue, and I think I knovv whereof I speak. \Ve were there then by right, and v•:e were there with force. \Ve were there with a party of our own, because \Ve we were already in the Phillippines. vYe were there because our flag floated over Manila. \r e were there be- 9-:lUSe by those events we h::td already become an Eastern power with the right to exercise a voice in tl1e determina- tion of Eastern affairs. vYe had taken by that act a leading pl-ace at the council table of the nations, and I s;_:>eak whereof I know when I say that it was the president of the United States whose firmness and resolution against the hesitation and the indecision of other parties; it was the firmness and resolution of the president of the United Etates who insisted upon the advance that was chiefly potential in tlJe rescue of our minister and of all the ministers of the several powers. There was some exercise of material power in that de- termination but there 1\~as an even greater moral power in the determination of larger issue, for it was the ptesi- dent of the United States who at the very outset insisted that notwithstanding the belligerent condition at Pekin and its inhabitants, a condition of war did not exist ; and this localized the conflict, and by that decision kept the great Viceroy of South China from participating in the conflict and from making it of a national character. It was the president of the United States who at the very outset de- clared as the keynote of our poliey that we should main- tain the integrity of the Chinese empire and the opportu- nity of equal trade. It was the President of the United States who, when the time of settlement came, insisted and protested against an excessive indemnity, and offered to cut the indemnity of United States one-half. Instead of s.eeking for a division of spoils the United States protested against the whole policy of spoliation, and I believe, and that belief is shared by those to whom immediate conduct-of affairs is entrusted and is sh1:1red i know by Ge~era1 Chaffee with whom I had the opportunity of conversation on the subject only the other day, that the attitude of the United States prevented the dismemberment of China and saved that Empire with its great trade of the future from falling into other hands, being divided up among the powers of Europe, and saved it for the opportunity of equal trade for the United States, with an eqt1:1l chance,, and that is aU the United States asks. And so, my young friends, who are young Americans, most of whom, perhaps all of whom, will continue to li:ve in this American country or in some one of its extended ann;;, 1 want t::> say to you midway between these anniver· saries of \Vashington and Lincoln that you may look upon the spirit and adrninistration and the purpose of your country and your government with highest pride. I want to say to you that never in our history has any govern- ment or any nation shown the magnanimity and moral grandeur which have been shown in these latter years in this struggle of mankind. When before, let me ask you, young students· of history, when before has any nation after defeating another nation in war, instead of exacting an indemnity, actuaHy paid consolation money as we paid consolation ·money to Spain after the Spanish-American war ? 'Vhen before has any nation ever shown the mag· nanimity and generosity to send back the vanquished soldiers of its defeated enemy to their homes beyond the sea at its own ex:pense, as we sent back the soldiers of Spain from Cuba and Porto Rico and the Philippines back to their homes on the Iberian Peninsular-sent them back at our own expense? When before has any nation ever brought back its ()Wn dead heroes, even its unidentified defenders from the places where they had fallen to bury them on their ow11 soil, as we brought bacl\: our dead de- fenders from the places where they fell in Cuba to be buried as I saw them buried in the presence of the President of the United States and of aU his Cabinet and\of the heaps of ~ll the great bureaus of the government and of the rep~ resentatives of the two houses of Congress and of ten thousand sorrowing spectators with reverently bared heads as the last requiem was sounded,. in our great national ceme~ery at ArlingtQn ? When before has any nation in all history ever paid back to a dependent people every sin· gle dollar collected from them at the Custom House, as we paid back to the people of Porto Rico all that they had paid us in advance, paid it back to them to be expended by themselves for their own benefit? When before has any nation or any government in a11 history ever stretched forth its arm to rescue an oppressed and downfallen peo· ple, to relieve them from the yoke of tryranny to lead them up into the way of liberty and progress, to endow them with all the advantages of sanitation and justice and edu- cation, and then with absolute power in its own hands, with its protege practically helpless at its feet, still faith· fully fulfilled every pledge and withdrew its troops and planted a new star in the firmament of the nation, as we

'rHE CONOORDIENSIS. l5 did when we established the free and independent Repub· lic of Cuba? :My young friends, this country into whid1 you are soon to go forth ~ith the training of this institution, with the equipment which you shall here acquire, is not merely a great country with boundless opportunities, but it is a country which despite momentary tendencies is animated by high moral impulses, is inspired by high moral pur· poses; and it is a proud privilege to live in such a country and to take a part in its civic life. I am sure that every one of you, as he reveiws this history and contemptates the glory and the prestige of the increased influence which have come to our flag under these conditions, must feel as that American did in the great Chinese city Tien· Tsin two years ago. T'he story came to as in a report made at Washington. You remember that when the allied troops were moving, they vvere assembled in the city of Tien· Tsin preparatory to their march upon Pekin, and when the time came for the march, for the onward advance, among the great body of spectators that thronged the walks of the streets of the. city there happened to be two men standing side by side. One of them was an Austra- lian. He had lived all his life in that far off island and had bQt just come to China, so that he was not familiar with the uniforms or with the flags which were borne by the troops. By his side stood an American, and Ameri- cans, as you will appreciate, know everything; and as the line came forward the Australian t4rned to the American by his side and asked him. '' What are those uniforms and flags which are borne along the line?'' As the lines be· gan to appear, the American pointed to those stalwart Cossacks of the north, bearing the yellow flag with a double black eagle; and he said, ''Those are the Russian troops, and that flag which they carry is the flag of the Czar.'' Following them came a large body of the robust, sin· ewey men· of Central Europe, carrying the flag of three colors ; and the American turned to his companion and said: '' Those are the German troops, and tlmt is the flag of the Kaiser.'' Following them came the Sikhs of I 11dia, with their at- tendents in their picturesque Indian costume, bearing the Union Jack, and the American pointed to them and said, '' Those are the English troops and that is the flag of the Queen.\ For the good Queen then sat on the throne. Following them came the large contingent which have furnished a large proportion of the ullied force with those light, swarthy, agile, little men, representing that nation, which in forty years has sprung from barbarism to the foremost place in the East and almost to a position among the great powers of the world. The American pointed to them, carrying their flag with its curiou~ design and said, '' rhose are the Japanese troops, and that is the flag of the Mikado.'' And then succeeding them with swinging- step and proud air, shoulder to shoulder, to the music of the airs with which we ~re familiar, came those we are accustomed to call '''The Boys in Blue~\ but who wore their jaunty Khaki uniforms, and the American with his heart swelling with pride and exultation pointed to them and said, \ Those are American troops, and that flag whicl1 they bear is my flag.\ Not the flag- of any Czar, not the flag of any Kaiser; not the Hag of any Queen, gracious and be· nignent tho she may be; not the flag of any Mikado ; not even the flag of the President, for we know no distinction, but '' My flag,'' the flag of the individual citizen, Just the flag of ~the individual citizen ; for in this great Repub· lie of ours, with its boundless opportunities and its great administrative work, that flag is followed by aU the pres· tige and aU the glory won through its history and through its rescue. Just your flag, my young men, just my flag And it is for all of Hs to prove that we are worthy of its history and worthy of its great distinction. VESPER SERVICE. Dr. Raytnond spoke at the Vesper Service last Sunday afternoon and took as his text these words of Paul : '' \Vhereupon, 0 King Agrip- pa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.'' \Vhenever we think of Paul we must think of him as a real man, the man of his age. He was by training a thinker and logician, but his na1ne has come down for the things he has wrought for christianity. The Chris· tian church is the strongest organization the world has ever known. No nation has ever had such strength. Paul is responsible for it. After Christ, he organized the church, gave it impetus, directed it. lie was not afraid of any tnan. I-Ie could face a mob and quell a tumult. Now what made Pau 1 the tnan he was? He tells us the vision, sun1s it up in the words : '' \Vherenpon, 0 l(ing Agrippa, I \Vas not diso· bedient linto the heavenly vision.\ Rome at this time stood for glory of arms and glory of legislation. How these things appealed to the heart of Paul ! Think of what he could have accomplished had he put his life into work of this Court and used it to add lustre to the glory of Rome. Furthermore, Paul was

He had a mind responsive to their appeal. He had studied the old philosophers, understood their reasoning. Had he wanted he could probably have started a ne~w school of thought. Again, Paul was trained fron1 boyhood in the religionof his fathers. He took pride in their , depth of faith, the long list of heroes, the mag- nificent rituaL H~ could not help but be re- sponsive to the great influences of the Jewish church. ''fhere \Vere three great influences, ;; -legislation, literature and religion. Paul chose to tnake his life count for the latter, but had he chosen to work for the Jewish re- ligion we n1ight have heard of him, but he I would not have had glory. I Hon. 'Valter E. \Vard is delivering a special ·course of lectures to the Seniors on ''Patents, Copyrights,· and Trade-n1arks'' in which de- partment Mr. vVard is a well-known specialist. Paul was before his conversion what he was after. He was enthusiastic by nature, but changed the current of his enthusiasm for Christ rather than against him. He was a logician by training not by con version. Paul was learned by study, not by descent of the Holy Spirit. 1'he things that are finest came from abov·e. His life was influenced by these things. He never forgot the vision. He lived in the light of it always. A man n1ust live for the things that are best. vVhen a man has a vision of Christ he realizes the unworthiness of his own life. Not only must he haYe the vision, but he must abide by it and li\·e in the light of it always. Only by so doing can a 1nan live up to what is best in life and make his life count for what is best. 'This is what Paul did. He l{ept the vision of Christ before hin1 every day, for the secret of living is devotion to Christ, and Paul could justly say, \ \Vhereupon, 0 King Agdppa, I was not disobe~dient unto the heavenly vision.'' ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. The following additional students have re- gistered within the past few days: Seniors; Leon G. Crary, Cornell, Canton, 1~. Y.; 1'qo~as M:ercereau Smith; Cornell; UniDn An editorial in the Harvard Crimson voices the indignation aroused in the university pro ... fessors by the caricatures of them which have appeared recently in the college periodicals and have been widely discussed. These carica- tures have spared no one, fron1 Dean Briggs to the lowest instructor in the English depart- ment, and although some of the caricatures have just been ''funny \ others have contain- ed personal elements of a character so offen- sive that the undergraduates themselves have wondered that the thing was permitted to go on. Pierre LaRose, one of Harvard's brightest young English instructors, has been caricatured in almost every number of the Lampoon for the last two years. Mr. LaRose is a great worker and particularly partial to cigarettes, and the Lan1poon editors l1ave pictured him as a baby smoking the nevet<absent cigarette, and again merely hinted at his existence by drawing a cane, a collar, a suit of clothes and a cigarette. It is now admitted that zeal has, at times, been carried a way in enthusiasm, and the edi- torial in the Crimson (Harvard's official paper) shows plainly that the faculty think the matter has gone far enough. The editorial says in part: \vVe do not feel that any of our papers or . undergraduate speakers should in any way be

All the fun is lost when bitterness or malice con1es in, and if a caricature see1ns to have any chance of hurting the feelings of the man caricatured . or his friends, it should be scrupulously with- held from publicity.\ THE MED,ICAL COLLEGE.
