THE C:oNCORDIENSIS VOL. ;YXVIIJ. U;_VfOJ\1 ·COLLEGE, A jiN_fL. I, I905. LVO. 22 Union College in 1835. ''A Narrative of the Vis:it to the American Churches, by the Deputation from the Congrega- tional Union of England and Wales\'' by Andrew Reed, D. D., and James Matheson, :n. D., pub- lished in ~ew York City in 1:835 c011.tains the fol- lo·wing notice of Union College: \We visited Union College, whicll is situated here. It is exceedin.gly well placed, on an es- tate of about 300 acres; and considerable property is likely to come to it. Its plan is ve1-y large; but I had some disappointment in not finding it executed. At the inn there was a larg-e painting of the whole; and some gentlemen, ()H referring to it, exclaimed, \There! is not that '1. ~p~endid place? That is Union College!\ a..nd these cir- cumstances gave reality to the, thing. ::But on ar- riving at the spot, I found that o11.ly the wings \\vere erected. On its present scale, 1 h.owever, it is thriving; and there is the prospect ,()f its becom- ing as magnificent as it was propos.ed to be.\ Extract From journal of Edwald Dickinson Harvard 1823. Friday> May 9, 1823. I took the stage to Schenectady- at 3 o'clock and although the roads were very bad owing to the heavy fall of rain during the las-t twenty-four hours, upon this clay soil, arrived .a.,t the colleg-e before sunset, presented letters of 1I1...troduction to President Nott, who received me cordially. Aftel' tea the President and his son wau~,ed with me to the other college building, where Mrs. Potter and her husband reside. This \\vas truly a pleasant interview. Miss Nott was one of th.e m.ost inter- esting young ladies that I ever met and M·rs. Pot- ' ter is quite as interesting, pleasing,. lovely, as ever -the same simple artlessness of ma..nners; the same winning deportment. At the close of the evening, r·eturned to the President's and shortly retired to rest. Saturday, May 10th. I rose ear'ly this morning-the sun was ju::;t shining ove.r the hills. My chamber was in the front of the house, and from the windows I hat.! a very extensive prospect of the city directly tn front of me, and of the SU'l:Tounding country to a great distance. The situation of this college is truly delightful. Much credit is due to the pro- jectors in selecting such a spot, and to their suc- cessors in improving it so much . .wYet they have much more to do, and much 1nore in contempl.::\L- tion. As the prayer be 11 tolled, Prof. Potter called for me and I went with him to the chapel. He led the devotions, the President being quite ill. One thing excited my attention, and to me ap- peared quite odd. )Jot more than half of the stud~nts rose from their seats during prayers. I inquired the origin of this to me so singular cus- tom, and learned that it \Vas a Dutch custom.· They never rise for prayers. Some of the stu- dents are from Dutch families and they are privileged-and I am told that at present there are many whose ruling passing is indolence-who have no more claim upon the Dutch, than the boy who blo\vs the organ bellows has to the title of musician, who still keep their seats disregarding the good Puritan custom of Xew England. The President--who was somewhat better after breakfast-his son Prof. Potter, in fact all the officers of college were engaged in their several duties till about eleven o'clock. I remained in • the President's study, reading a little of this, and a little of that, sauntering a \Yay my time in busy curiosity. Then I walked with Mr. X ott, \\Vho is Professor of Chemistry and lVIineralogy to view the public rooms. They are much better supplied than Williams, yet do not come up to venerable Harvard.

The end of tbe \\\vinter term marked the close cof the year for the Young Men's Christian Asso- ciation, for at the opening of the spring term, a Finan.cially, the Association is in better condi- tion than it has been for several years. Seventy dollars in membership fees have been conected, \Vhile $50 -:were presented to the Association by rnembers of the faculty and other friends. With this latter a1nou.nt, were purchased books for the reference library of Bible and mission study, rnagazines and supplies. At present there is $17 in the treasury besides $35 left from last year's .:\orth .. fi.eld fund. \Vith the idea in view of making Silliman Hall more attractiv·e a reading roo1n \Yas started last ' spring. Ever since there have been on file many of the current magazines, the city papers, a Xew York daily and the Concordiensis exchanges. In order to create a greater interest in actiye missionary work, letters were ·wtitten to Union al u1nni who a1·e now in the mission field. The ans\Yers to these letters were read at the different missionary meetings and published in the Con- cordiensis. For the first time, in a few years at 'least, the 1nissionary con1mittee has raised money for missionary purposes. $14.50 has been pledged, \\Yhich amount will be sent to Harrison K. vVrigh.t, an alumnus, who is now at Mingpo, China. This amount is given entirely by students. Five Bible classes with a total enrollment of 32 have been 1naintained. The a\\'erage attendance has been about 2 0. There have been 30 yolu1nes added to the As- sociation library during the year; for the most part reference books for the Bible and n1.ission study classes. During the year 6 7 religious m,eetings \Yere held. The interest sho\vn in the meetings has been quite marked. The Tuesday night meetings have been ~ . very informal but of much practical help.

If thc1·e has been any advancenrent, H has been due to the hearty co-operation of the members witl1 the officers and if there is to be no back- ~ .- ' ward step during the coining year, 1nore fellows mu:::t show an interes-t and take a rnore active part in the \YOrk.

The book is very m.uch th:cker than any of the prev- ious nu1n t:ers and is gotten up with a style that g:ves the reader a good impressio-n the moment he turns its pages. The CQVer i::: of a Czarina paper \Yith. the gold letters \19·06 Garnet\ on the front. The pages are of cr·earn antic woven deckle edge vellum paper ·which gives the entire book a clean cut appearance. On the first page is the dedication and reads as follows: \This volume is de€1.icated to Charles Proteus Stein- out-of-town football games. The pictures m·e printed in a brown tint in order to conforn1 \Vit i1 the cream. tinted paper, and instead of bein~· printed directly upon the page, the original prints are pasted upon the sheet. The art editor vvas espedally fo•rtunate in oh- t.aini~\lg dra·wings for the book and 1nany very original sketches were handed in by the students. Most of the inserts show up strongly \Yhich. help . .; to make the book attractive. A topographical map of the college grounds can be found in the back of the book. This year's Garnet is in every \Yay a credit to the college. It is novel in make up and excellet:t in quality.

Baseball. In spite of the difficulties that the team has had to face this spring, there is abundant :matedal left, from which a winning team may be chosen. X orwood, '0 6, who showed up so well for pitche1' is critically iH at the hospital, and it is hardly probable that he will be able to play at all this spring. Several other good players will be un- able to play on account of the strict faculty rules, but will be out to help develop the 'varsity team. The coaching system is a fine one, and the coaches, D:r. Towne and Mr. Cunningham, are working hard every day. Under their efficient training, every man who has any ability will be made to show it to the best advantage. Again, the candidates are training very strictly and ' will go into the game with no drawbacks on ac- count of physical conditions. The first game is with West Point on April 8, and although \the time is short, the men will be in shape by that time, as they have been prac- tising in tbe open since Monday.

Harvey demonstrated his ability as a catcher last year and Je\veU has done good ·work on his pr-ep. school teatn. The pitching departn1ent which was so strong a few ·weeks ago has fallen off. Davis '07, Hil- dreth '0 8, Curtin '0 8 and Hafley '0 8 are out now, but all will not be able to compete. Rider, '06, and Colburn, '08 are the candidates for first base, and it is hard to tell which is the better man. It is hoped that one may be develop- ed into an outfielder. DiYer of the Albany 1\fedical College is showing up strongly for second base. He has not been over often enough to show \Yhat he can do, but his baseball reputation is an enviable one. The other candidates for second are Imrie '06, Ray- mond, '08, E._ Robinson, '08, Forbes, '08 and Davis, '07. :\ot very much can be said about them as yet. For third base there are :\orwood, '06, Ziln- mer, '06, Hildreth, '08, Hoffman, '08, Hale, '08 and Davies, '08. From these it is assured that t'vo good men can be chosen. The absence of Goff '07 leaves shortstop to be • filled by a ne\V man. Tiedeman, '07, Vogt, '08, Fullerton, '08, and Palmer, '08 are all strong can- didates. There are several good men trying for the out- field. Among them. are Hagar, '06, Richards, '07, Taylor, '07, Richardson, '07, Tiedeman, '07 Col- , burn, '08, Je\veU, '08; Robinson, '08, Helm, '08, Davis, '0 8, Hafley, '08 and Palmer, '08. , A schedule for the second team. is being ar- ranged by Assistant Manager Moon.

F1·ofessor Willianr Jan1es, ,of Harvard Univer- sity, relates that, upon a certain journey, he was questioning with hin1:self whether or not tJ:re higher heroism of life was passing out of hurnan society; and that, at the very. n'loment, he look,ed fro1n the car ·window and suddenl~ got sight of a number of work1nen perfonning some task on the dizzy ledge of an iron construction, at a great height. This at once brought to his n1ind a sense of the every-day bravery of men in every-day oc- cupations. It flashed upon hiln, on the instant, that the true he1·oi:s1n of life is found, not only on th~ day of battle and in desperate adventl.(lres, but also in building every bridge or in the or- ' dinary day- by-day service of the world, whether of the sailor upon his deck, the braken1an upon his train, the lumberman upon his raft, or wher- ever else men are at ·work. \As I awoke to this unidealized heroic life around me,\ 'he says, \the scales seemed to fall frorn my eyes, and a ·wave of sympathy greater than I had ever before felt with the com.mon life of com1non 1nen began to fill my soul.\ Notes of Other Colleges.

i. ! THE CoNcORDIENSIS VOL. )YXVIJI. Commencement Exercises Albany College 6f Pharmacy. On the evening of March 2 8 the Pharmacy Department held their commencement exercises at Odd Fell0ws Hall, Albany. Promptly at 8 o'clock the graduating class, consisting of 28 men and one young lady, in caps and gowns, filed into the hall. Shortly afterward the Faculty appeared. The exercises were opened with prayer by Rev. Sherman Rouse, after ·which Dr. Willis G. Tucker, dean of the college, made an address of \Velcome. Speaking of the gro\vth of the college during its 2 4 years of existence he referred to the constant- ly increasing number of matriculants. At the opening lecture last October there \vere 6 9 matri- culants as against 37 the year before. Dr. Tucker then presented to Chancellor Raymond the ' graduating class. Dr. R~ymond as the chief executive of the university, after a brief ''v•:ord of advice\ presented dipl01nas to the class conferring the degree of Ph. G. Rev. Chas. W. Heisler delivered a masterly ad- dress 1vhich was attentively listened to. After congratulating the graduates on their successful completion of the prescribed course and express- ing his personal gratification at finding a young lady among them he urged that the p<rofessional side of the calling might not be subordinated to the mercantile. He urged that instead of low- ering the constant aim should be to raise the standard and make it more difficult for outsiders to enter the profession. Or as Mr. Arthur I..~. An- dre\vs put it later in the evening, \If any other fellow wants to get into the game, raise the ante.\ Dr. Heisler placed clearly before his hearers the privileges and duties of the pharmacist to- ward his fellow men and dwelt especially upon his social duties and his personal responsibility as a citizen. He said that it was the duty of 7\l; ;?'? L H. -...) ·every man to accept proffered office and to dis- charge his duties to the best of his ability. He compared advantages and opportunities to the parable of the talents saying that the napkin was not tQ wrap the talents for burial but to \vipe from the hro\v the sweat resulting from \Vork and efforts in using rightly the talents entrusted. The validictory address was delivered by Ar- thur J. Curtis. His subject was \The Pharmacist as a Guard Aga-inst Adulteration.\ Space will not permit of the re})roduction of Mr. Curtis' ex- cel:lent address; suffice it to say that he showed the in.numerable \\rays in which the pharmacist guards his patrons against drugs and cheinicals adulterated or insufficiently purifi:ed by the pro- ducer. After thanks to the Faculty and a fare- well to the college hy Mr. Curtis, Dr. A. B. Huest-. ed \Yith a talk on the origin of the \Yord \prize a\.varded the following prizes: Prize of $25.00 for the best Senior general ex- amination to A. J. Curtis; honorable mention to R. Bruce Smith, A. L. Xeher and E. A. \Valker. Aiu:mni Association. prize of $20.00 to the Senior passing the best exa1nination in pharmaceutical Iab0ratory work to H. T.

Junior prize of $15.00 for best general exam- ination to C. W. Strong; honorable mention to W. N. Thomson, J. vV. Beavan and .J. L. Everleth. Tucker Junior chernistry prize of $10.00 to W. N.

Vesper Service. At the vesper service Sunday afternoon Dr. Hoffman began a series of three talks on Mediae- val and Present Day Conceptions of God. In part Dr. Hoffman said: \It is nece~sary that we kno·w the Mediaeval view of God in order to bring out clearly the right we have to our present day view, and to rea liz€ the new conception we have of -hiln because of our better kno\vledge of the universe and of man.

9 THE COJ.V·C·ORDJENSIS. - - ---- ~-- ------·- ---------------- --- -=========== Course of Four Years In Greek Will be Instituted at Union Next Year. The Faculty have decided to offer a course of four years in Greek for the he;nefit ef all students desiring the degree of A. B. who were unable to take that study during their High Schoo 1 years. At present a preparatory course covering three years in the High School is required for entrance. l\i[any of the High Schools, especially the smaller ones, :nave dropped Greek from their curriculum and this causes complications ·when the pupils from these schools desire to enter a classical course at a college. 'The plan of giving four years of Greek has been adopted at Harvard and Columbia and has improved m.atters considerably. The first two years are taken up with the study of the texts required in the preparatory course whHe \Vhat has been the regular work in Greek at the colleges for the first two years in the sub- ject will come in the Junior and Senior years. There have been many cases at Union where an. entering student desired to study Greek, but had not had the necessary preliminary ·work and by adopting this 1nethod next year the Faculty hope to accoTnmodate some ·who are in a similar posi- tion. Track Athletics. The fi. rst track rneet will be held with Trinity at Hart:ford, four weeks from to-day, May 6th, and the energies of the mE>n are being concen- trated to make this a v.ictory for Union. On May 20th tne Rochester track team is coming to Sche- necta:dy fot· a dual Ineet with Union. The Freshmen are showing up well. Those that have been out so far are Vincent Hafley, I.Ceith, Flo\vers, Parsons, Bennett, \Vatson, Heilbronner, Bacon, W. Hildreth and Stevens. M~c:\ab and Shutlel,, two pr<J.mising men, are deba,rred from com:p eUng on account of conditions. ~ or\vood, '06, \.-yho was a very valuable man, is unable to take pa:t~t in any athletics on account of sickness. He \Vill be missed on the track, especially in the quarter mile and. the hurdles. There is a good chance of having two or three 1nen from the Medical college over. All the old men are back with the exception of Rutledge, '04, and the out- look is very prmnising. .At the present \vriting ·we are unable to state the definite events that the different rnen are try- ing for as the work so far has been entirely of a general nature. Senior Class Officers. Although spring has con\le and the ground is drying up the track is yet in a bad condition. It is still wet and needs to be rolled. However the Athletic Board has hired a man to put it in shape and he is working every day digging the jumping places, placing sawdust in the jun1ping pits, rak- ing the track and puttin-g everything in good shape for the tirne when it will be dry enough An in1portant meeting of the Senior class was held Monday morning directly after college meet- ing. A class tax \vas levied to defray the ex- penses of com mence1nent week. The follo\ving officers were elected for Class Day and the IvY Exercises: Class Day Officers. Class Orator ..................

The Union College Alumni Association of the ?\orthwest held its annual banquet on Monday evening, April 10 at the Grand Pacific Hotel in Chicago. The guest of the occasion was Presi- dent Raymo-nd and there were gathered t<t meet him more than 2 5 alumni of the Middle West, for the most part from. Illino.is and Wisconsin. They represented a wide variety of professions, and al- most every decade in the history of the institution. It was expected that Devotion C. Eddy, of the name appears therein, ari.d a determined attempt made thus to keep the alumni of the lVIiddle West in closer touch with the institution. Several of those present follo,yed Dr. Raymond with informal speeches, and it was midnight be- fore the assemblage dispersed. Officers of the Association: President. .................

Then there were the men of the war days, the 70's, and the 80's, while the younger elem~nt present, upon whom rested the responsibility for the success of the af- fair, were as Dr. Raymond said, \my ow:n boys.'' The dinner began at 7: 30 and as it progressed \vas enlivened by college songs and yells. Presi- dent Henry C. Wood, '83, acted as toastmaster and introduced as the first speaker, Dr. Raymond. The president spoke upon the theme, \Old Union of Today.\ He described the changes that had . been brought about at he college during the last ten years contrasting present conditions with past and told of present ideals and the plans for their realization. Photographs of the grounds, buildings and equipment and copies of the college publications were passed among the alumni and enjoyed with keen interest. Each alumnus was supplied with a directory of the association, revised and brought to date, containing the names of nearly 2 0 0 alumni living in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa; and in addition the words of four well known Union songs.

Union again lost to Rutgers in the ann\'ual de- bate bet·ween the two colleges held.. in the chapel Friday evening, April 7. The visiting team 1nal>.e R.n. excellent impression and \Yo-n the debate fairly. ~he Union team, lacking in the ease alil.. d effec- tiveness of delivery that characterized t~e Rut- ~ers speakers, and upholding by far th~ harder €nd of the question, put up a good fighfi: and in the judgement of all made the most they could out of their side. The question read: ~'Resolved, That legislation aiming to destroy the trusts is unwise.'' Rutgers had the affirmative of the question and -was represented by Franci~ E. Wil- bur, '05; \Velcone W. Bender, '05, and.. Simon Blocker, '05, the alternate being J. Har~ey Mur- phy, '06. Union, supporting the negative, was represented by Joseph T. Wright, '07; CJ1arles N. Waldron, '0_6, and Morris T. Raymond, '05, with Thomas M. Holmes, '05 as alternate. Tbe judges of award \vere: Henry P. Warren, Prin. Albany Acade1ny; J. G. Murdock, Prin. Troy ..Academy, and Charles F. vVheelock, of the X ew York State Education Department. It was shortly after eight o'clock when ... Dr. Ray- fate of the country. The case for the negative \YaS opened by Mr. Wright. He said that before anything else was done the tenn '•trust\ must be fined. For this the popular, and not the liter·al, definition, must be accepted, \Yhich caBs trusts those associations \Vhich, through con1bination, gain cornplete con- trol of the markets and freedom fro1n colnpeti- t.ion. A trust must be considered an organiza- tion which has a monopoly, thus exercising re- straint, if not actual control, of trade. Fron'l this basis, to destroy the trust by law does not forbid honest combination. He said that if the trust principles ·were bad, the trusts \vould be bad; he advocated destroying the trust principle ~nd thus distroying the trusts Mr. Bender \vas the second speaker for the affirmative. He disagreed with the preceeding definition of trusts, claiming that to accept that definition \vould beg the question. All the large c:o1nbinations n1ust be regarded as trusts. In taking up the line of his argument, he viewed the question from the political side. 'The trust in itself is not illegal. Past legislation has proved ineffective and so any further legislation would be over-legislation, which is dangerous to our political ideas. He also said that such legisla- tion as proposed is unnecessary as the existing evils of trusts can be remedied. Re1nedial and not destructive legislation is needed. mond, after a short address of welcor11e, intro- duced Mr. Wilber, the first speaker. 1\Clr. Wilber defined the main issue as being·, \Shall the trusts be destroyed by la \V ?\ This he \ivas to h .. old as un- wise. He outlined the argument of the affirma- tive as vievdng the question fron'l th:~ree stand- points, the economic, political and social. :Mr. Wilbur took up the econo1nic vie··w. He found five points in favor of trusts: (a) The pDevention o.f the waste of smaller plants, (b) the .:>pening of Mr. Waldron continued the debate for Union and affirmed that it \vas not the desire of the negative to reduce all co1nbinations to kindling wood and totally destroy com1nerce, as the af- firmative had complained. He said that the prosperity of our country depended upon two things, its natural resources and Yankee ingenu- ity. Trusts curb this ingenuity, being \the abso- lute monarchs of business;\ they destroy the independence of the individual; the result of 1·, I their make sour-c unde1 fin all: 1none a me Th concl who Fe de state -waul COll'lJ a 1a1 . beca over. rupt that ·with sary unio l\1 clar' sary org:: tabl takE pro1 patE tiOll tru~ the bes n1:o stn ThE is , sta lav, sal bu lli2 ge~

their 1nethods is corruption and dishonesty; they make it possible for the few to use the great re- sour·ces oiE our country for their o\vn good; they undermh'le civic and business integrity; and, finally, our legislatures are influen.ced by the rnoney of the trusts, and ~he trusts thus become a menace to OU!t legislative freedom. The dire_ct presentation for the affirmative was concluded by Mr. Blocker. He desired to know who \vas to pass the proposed legislation, the Federal! governm-ent, through Congress, or the states. lf the former, the rights of the states ·would be over-ridden; if the latter, hopeless and co1nplete confusion would result. He said that a Ia w which cannot be enforced is a detriment, because it creates a contempt for law and more- over, to try to pass such laws would cause cor- ruption. From the social standpoint he said that combinations of labor rnust be destroyed ·with con1binations of capital. for both are neces- sary to the social equilibrium., and yet the labor unions are recognized as being here to stay. l\1r. Raymond was the last speaker. He de- clared that legislation is not only wise but neces- sary for checking the evils of trusts \vhich are organizations for plunder. The government es- tablishes conditions of ·which the trust magnates take advantige. The so-called trusts hide behind protective tariffs, charters loosely constructed and patent laws that inure to the profit of combina- tions rather than individuals. To distroy the trust evil \Ve must use that power which creates the conditions that make the evil possible. The best legislation would be that which would re- n1:ove the barriers to competition. The business struggle is resulting in the survival of the unfit. The sm.all producer having advantage in economy is driven out of business because the trust can stand a loss in a fight. The Sherman anti-trust la\vs has made trusts illegal, legislation is univer- sal and has proved effective. Each man was allowed five minutes for his re- buttal speech, after which the judges retired to make their decision. In a short time they re- turned unanimously awarding the debate to Rut- gers. The decision was well received and the ? audience departed to the accon1paniment of an exchange of college yells. ALUMNI.

Nelson 1\llillard, one of the ablest clergyrnen in Rochester, an- nounced his withdrawal fron'l the Presbyterian Church at the session of the Rochester Presby- tery Tuesday morning. Dr. Millard does not say that he intends to join any other denomination, merely saying it is his desire to occupy the indept'ndent relationship pro- vided for in the articles of government of the church.· He was chaplain of the !t·egim.ent and the oldest in point of service in the United States army. When he retired in March he \Yas the first to re- ceive the rank of lieutenant-:colonel. Maj. Robinson, during his ca1·eer in the army, has seen much service. He went through the civil W!=1r and was with Shermalll. on his n'larch to the sea. He was appointed post chapJ..ain by President Grant March 1, 18 77, and has been chaplain of the First infantry for several years . He spent many years among the Indian fighters in western posts. During the Spanish-America11 war he was on the hospital ship Relief. He then ''rent to Samar vvith the First infantry, but was obliged to re turn to this country because of ill- ness. Maj. Robinson and famHy are no\Y living in vVashington. * * * * '83.-· John W. Adams, (Den1.) of Kalamazoo, Michigan, who -vvas re-elected as circuit judge for the ~inth judicial district over Speaker Sheridan F. Master, is one of the best known citizens of Kalamazoo, as is his opponent. The personality of the judge was a large contributing factor to his victory in a nominally Republican district. He has for some years been recognized as one of the most able members of the Kalamazoo bar, as weU as having ·secured a prominent position in the af- fairs of his city and this section of Michigan. Judge Adams is still a young m.an, having been born in Lockhaven, Pa., November 30, 1859. At the age of about 12 years he removed to Three Rivers, Mich., and was graduated from the high school in that place. He graduated from the Un- ion college, Schenectady, N. Y., in 18 8 3, after win- ning honors, including the first prize in the Blatch- ford oratorical contest and the first prize in the Allen essay contest, both in his Senior year. After graduation he went to EeJm,ont, Ia., where for two years he engaged in farming. He was appointed postmaster of Belmont by President Cleveland during his first term. Ocfober 1, 1887, Mr. Adams came to Kalamazoo and entered the law office of Dallas Boudeman as studer. the ba at he partnE shAp c Mr. A torne~ hew::: and 1:: Th took is th the f carnr 'veek town the Hag<: acco toda· Di\'e Mull Davi up \\'i Har: \bit c. f. 0 day PoiJ A on a s< ers we:: Poi I sist k.ei ]

BASE BALL. Williams at Williamstown Today. The team. left this morning at 7:4-0 where they took the 10 o'clock train for Willian1stown. This is the second game of the season for Union anci the fkst for \iVilliams. Heavy rain has kept thr::- carnpus very muddy for the greater part of tho 'veek. It has rained fully as hard at \Villiams- town according to Dr. TovYne and consequently the Williams team has also suffered. Capta1n Hagar is confident that the team will give a good account of itself and announces as our line-up for today: Hildreth, p.; Rider, 1st b.; Hagar, c. f.; Dh·er. 3rd b.; Colburn. 2nd b.; Richards, l. f.; Mullrooney, r. f.; Vogt, s. s.; Harvey, c.: Jewell. Davis and Taylor, substitutes. The Willian1s lir.e- up ·will probably be vVestervelt, p.; McCardy, c.; Harman or \Vilcox, 1st b.; Bonham, 2nd b.; ::\es- \bit s. s.; vVield, 3rd b.; Hogan, 1. f.; Wadswortr.. c. f.; Warren or Waters, r. f. The West Point Game. Our baseball team made its first trip last Satur- day and experienced defeat at the hands of ·west Point. After a week of hard practice a team was put on the field that held the West Pointers down to a score of 5 to 0, and great credit is due the play- ers for their good fielding. The team was rather weak in batting, but this may be due to \Vest Point's pitchers, who were particularly good. off on one throw. His batting was good, however, and he made the only t·wo hits for Union. Diveir Vogt and Hildreth ·were in the game for all it was worth and played \veil. Out of six chances to the outfi,eld one only was lost. The game \vas 1-narked by its few errors and snappy playing. Everyone ought to be well satis- fied with the score after the difficulties the coach and captain have gone through this year. The score in full follows: '-'rest Point. A.B P.O. E. A. R.

A new book by Dr. Hale has been published by Henry Holt & Co. In it son~e of the more characteristic \YOrk of Rostrand, Havptmann, Su.detn-;uann, Pinero, Shaw, Phillips and Maeter- linck is considered. Among the plays discussed are \Cyrano de Bergerac,'' \L' Aiglon,\ \The Sunken Dell,'' \Magdo \Ulysses \Candida \Letty \Bris and \Pelleas and 1\tle'lisande.\ * * * * A timely book is one written by Thon1.as ~elson Page, \The N\egro the Southernier's Ptoblem.\ :::.'\o one could write on this subject with finer feel- ing or with keener appreciation. * * * * \The Princess Passes\ by Mr. and Mrs. Wil- liamson, the authors of \The Lightning Conduc- tor,\ has proved ilnmensely popular and is hav- ing a large sale. .As an automobile story it is the best of its kind. * * * * Hugo Ganz, \vhose book \The Land of Riddles\ is the most widely read of any of the recent books on Russia has just had an interview with Tol.stoi, whom he found with hair and beard white, yet with a youthful step and carriage.

In speaking of the present condition in Russia he said \They know where to find n1.e,\ contemptuously indifferent to the terror of the rnachine that has done so much to bring his coun- try to ruin. * * * * Henry K. vVebster's new book, ''Loyalist and Traitor\ \Yith subtitle \The Man Who Found His Country\ is a good old-fashioned story in ~;hich one breathes the strong salt air of the sea.

The following paragraph is taken from a full and discriminating appreciation of the book in the last Times Review: \The point cannot be too often emphasized that neither G1~eek nor Latin is a dead language and that the inheritance \\Yhich we have received from each is arnong our choicest yet most neglect- ed possessions. All that is vital and permanent in literature can be traced to the Greek; scientific demonstration owes its origin and perpetuation to the Latin mind; in the tragedies and comedies of the Greeks we find the beginnings of all that is shown in the modern drama-incident, dia- logue, tragedy, pathos, and humor, all magnified expressions of actual life. Even the introduction of steel as an elem.ent of architectural construc- tion has not caused us to be utterly unmindful of Greek forms, however these forms for the time and in the age of eager development may have lost their harmony by the transitory exigency of practicability. And as to the Greek athletics, their influence is a constant balance wheel to ex- cesses, muscular, sensational, and sordid.\ * * * * Rome.

At .Sunday's vesper se,rvtce Dr. Hoffman gave the second of his talks on \'Mediaeval and Present Day Conceptions of God.'' In beginning Dr. Hoff- man gave a revie\v of the features of the mediae- val conception of God a.nd the problems pro- duced by them ·which he had presented in his first talk. The remainder of his lecture was upon the development of the eonception. Dr. H.offman said in part: ''One of the later influences on the media:eval conception of God was the 'Four Books of Sentences' of Peter LOln- bard, Bishop of Paris. This book attempted to show the beliefs of the cllurch in regard to God, creation and judgment. and it became the text book on religion in all U1e theological schools of the tilne. \The reformation made no change in the actual conception of God as th€ question debated by it was one of the policy of the people in reading the Bible and putting their o'vn interpretation upon it or of their accepting the interpretations put upon it by the Pope and church.\ Dr. Hoffman then mentioned some of the prob- ' lerns which have grown from the old conception of God; the questions ()f the creation of the \\YOrld in six actual days, of the length of time man has inhabited the earth, of the origin of or- ganisms, and those brought up by the modern knowledge of astronomy. In his first two talks Dr. Hoffman has present- ed some of the mediaeval and negative ideas of God. In his next talk he will give some of the ideas of God, in view ()f our present day knowl- edge of man and of th-e universe. College Briefs.

This is of special interest to us at Union as one of our famous p·rofessors, Taylor Lewis, had much to do with the cffiearing a\vay of certain false ideas that had clung to the mind since their birth dur- · ing the middle ages. The Reading Room committee are busy renew- ,ing subscriptions and getting new magazines for .Silliman Hall. The idea is to make the reading :material there different fro·m the publications taken in the coillege library and of a more enter- taining character. Later a complete list of these ·magazines will be published. The Hand Book for next year is being prepared and the committee hope to get it out before June. It ·will be larger than last year's as the merchants have consented to advertise in it. The Junior baseball tea1n of the city Y. M. C. A. is in need of coaching and they are anxious to get some college men to help them. Any one who could give one or more hours a week to this will please give their names to Waldron. If Mr. Pond permits, this team will practice on the back campus. Well, well, these shaes are ·worth shouting about. Gi'Ve me a Nabob-quick-at $3.50 230 State St. Fearey's Schenectady

THE CONCORDIEJVSfS. \What! are you going to can on. my niece in a business suit?\ \Weli I mean business.-Life. The Freshrnan classes of the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University will meet in an· intercollegiate debate this year. Harvard men have organized a club to enter- tain visiting athletic teams. This is indeed high- ly commendable. Often the visiting team gets but the merest glimpse of the University an.d the city and carries away impressions entirely false. Whether a club is necessary to extend such hospi- tality can be questioned. The beauty about striking an attitude is that the attitude can't strike back. The Alumni Committee of Harvard University which has promised to turn over a birthday pres- ent of $2,500,000 to its Alma Mater at the next June commencement, has announced that it ex- pects to receive the larger part of that sum from J.

1 THE CoNcoRDIEN.sis VOL. ){XVIII. UNIOJ\l COLLEGE, A!JRfL. 29, 1905. No. 25 Rev. Putnam Cady, '85 Honored. The Reverend Putnam Cady, pastor of the Em- manuel Presbyterian church of Amsterdam, has been elected a fellow of the Royal Geographkal society of England, and is now entiHed to write the distinguished initials, F. R. G. S., after his name. 'There are not more than half a dozen Americans ·who have received this honor. This distinction has been bestowed upon the Rev. Mr. Cady in recognition of his discoveries in the exploration of Moab, on the eastern. side of the Dead Sea. In 18 9 8 Mr. Cady, accompanied only by t\VO Arabs, transported a small skiff from Jerusalem do\vn to the Dead Sea. launched the boat there and went do\vn the east coast of the sea, that side being almost unknown to scien- tific observers, and photographs having never been taken of it. 'The mountains of Moab rise from the water's edge, making landing extrentely difficult. The depression of the sea basin, 1,3 00 feet oelO\Y the level of the Mediterranean Inakes the atmosphere most oppressive, but in spite of these obstacles Mr. Cady kept on ·with his work, making careful explorations on the coast and sorne distance inland, obtaining rnany photo- graphic vie·ws of great value, and finally taking his boat up the Arnon river, a tributary svhich empties into the east side of the Dead Sea, some twenty miles south of the mouth of the Jordan. The only other boat expedition of any import- ance made on the Dead Sea, before that of Mr. Cady, \vas the one of Lynch, in 184 7, but in. that trip no photographs -yvere taken. The Lynch party made no attempt to go up the Arnon river, Mr. Cady being the first explorer to do so. The results of this exploration by Mr. Cady have bee11 of great value to Orientalists and Bibli- cal scholars, facts never before known being pre- sented with the precision which only the trained observer can bring to the task. A lecture on his discoveries was delivered last year by Mr. Cady before the A1nerican Geographical society and it \-vas considered of such undoubted value that it was printed in full ,in the magazine which con- tains the transactions of the society. There is an English society known as the Pales- tine Exploration Fun.d. Its patron is K:ing Ed- ward; its president, the archbishop of Canter- bury. The chairma1a of the executive comn1ittee is Major Gen. Sir Charles Wilson, famous for his exact surveys of Jerusalen1. an~ Mount Sinai. The work of Mr. Cady excited the admiring interest of Sir Charles, who is a member of the Royal Geo- graphical society, an.d a correspondence between the two ensued. Last month Mr. Cady received the following letter: Palestine Exploration Fund, 3 8 Conduit Street, London, W., March 13, 1905. My Dear Sir :-It has given me much pleasure to propose you for election to the Royal Geo- graphical society, and Major Dan.vin, a son of the late Prof Dar\-vin, has signed your paper. You will be elected in due course, \\Vhich means toward the end of this month or early in the next. Your election will be 11(3tified to you soon after it has taken place. I am Very truly yours, C. \V. WILSOX. Vesper Service. On Sunday, April 16th, Dr. Hoffrnan gave the last of his talks on \M-ediaeval and Present Day Conceptions of G<>d.\ Dr. Hoffman spoke as fol- lows: \One of the chief differences between the mediaeval conception of God and that of today concerns the sources of the data out of which it is to be formed. In mediaeval times it was held

6 Tl-JE CONCORD!EJ.VSIS. that all of our knowledge o:f God came through a supernatural revelatio-n. The position was that he revealed his existence and attributes to the fathers of the Jewish. people and they transmitted this knowledge to us. The vie\¥ of today is that we get our ideas of God also from what we know about this universe and \\Vhat we know about .our- selves. From OU'l' study of the universe we have learned that everything in it proceeds !from one and the san~,e Infinite and Eternal Energy and that every- thing is permeated and sustained in existence by this Energy. God is related to the universe as \Ve are to our bodies. That is to say, God and the world are so related that we may truly asert that \VE' have no way of thinking about this relation except by affirming that \God is no 1nore without a world than a world is without God.'' \Probably no write.r has more clearly and con- cisely expressed this result of recent reflection upon this 1natter than Herbert Spencer, \An~id the mysteries,\ he says \which become the more mysterious the more they are thought about, there will remain this one absolute certainty, that we are ever in. the presence of an Infinite Eternal Energy, from which all things proceed.'' God is All in All. God . is therefore wrongly thought of as a Great First Cause. He is not the first in a series of causes. He is not the origina- tor of secondary causes but is the one only cause. Gravity, heat, light, electricity and the like are not real causes but simply modes or ways in which God acts. All the acts of nature are the acts of God. There is no real difference between the natural and supernatural. God is all in all. This is Jesus' view when he says. \Consider the lilies of the field hovv they grow,\ and \Behold the fo\vls of the air. \\Ve ought not to think of God as in any sense afar off. He is present every n~oinent in every object that surrounds us, in every pebble, every leaf, and every flo\ver. He is nearer to us than our own bodies. It is literally true as Tennyson says, ''Closer is He than breathing, nearer than hands or feet.\ G ''Fron~ the study of the history of both nature and man vve learn that this Infinite Eternal En- ergy is a power that makes for righteousness. All history is a development of life. It teHs us how from the humblest and most insignificant begin- nings there are ever deve'loping higher and higher form-s of life. 'There is progress in the world and all history shows it to us. The microscopic germ grows and multiplies until the human or- ganisin results and this human organism is made the vehicle for the development of saints. \A rational plan is being realized and we can see it with ever increasing clearness. The world is 1nore and more being governed in accordance with the princip~es orf truth and right and God is bringing it about. From the study of ourselves we discover that this Eternal Energy making for righteousness knows and feels and wills. This we learn fr01n the fact that we know and feel and will ourselves. Our idea of God must be adequate to account for all that is. We are personal be- ings; hence God is the Infinite Person. \The highest form under which our personality manifests itself is that of a father. God is our Father. The Father of all mankind. This truth Jesus rightly makes the central truth of all his teaching. The emphasis he puts upon it is one of the principal proofs of his divine mission. Christian Association. VESPEH.

He graduated fro1n Union in 1L 824, taught one year and then attended Princeton Theological Seminary. E{e sailed in 1830 as a n1.issionary to Syria where be worked for 2 5 years with the exception of brief visits to GonstanU·no- ple and S\vitzerland for his health. In 1834 h.e was transferred from BeiT-u.t to Jerusalem where he spent 9 years. He returned to Beirut and labored there till he died of cholera in 18 56. The class of 1847 graduated two that were the leaders in their respective: fi.elds, Gulian Lansing in Egypt and John Livingston Nevius in China. John Xevius was born in 18 29. At the age of 16 he entered Union as a sophomore, coming from his home in Seneca Co., i1'l a canal boat. In the autum.n of 1849 he left hi.s ho1ne to seek his for- tune in the South and was n-ot at this time a con- fessing Christian. At his parting his 1nother said to him, \John if you were going away to be a n1issionary to the heathen, that I could bear, but this I cannot.\ Soon, ho\\vever he recognized the clairns of Christianity upon him and became a fervent m-en1ber of the Presbyterian church. After teaching school in the South for awhile and graduating from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1854 he married and started at once for ~ing­ poo, China. He possessed a strong body, power- ful mind and earnest spirit, and worked stead- fastly till his death in 18 9 3. Gulian Lansing is of spedal interest to us as he was a convert from the church of which President Raymond's father was pastor. All ch u.rches recognized Lansing as the leading missionary of his day in Egypt arl.d his scholarly .ability and knowledge of Arabia ga<in,ed him the respect of the Mohammedans alnOTJ.g whom he labored for forty years. Union today is well represented in the mission field and the example of these older men has not been lost. This year the Association collected $15 which was sent to Harrison K. Wright in China. Such support given to our own alumni helps the an1:ount. TO HON:OR AUDUBON. Commemoration in New York May 4. .Arrangements have :been made for the com- mem.m·ation of the one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary of the birth of the great ornithologist, John James Audubon, on· the evening of 1V1ay 4, at the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Inter- cession, at Broad\Yay and One Hundred and Fifty- eighth Street, Xew York City, which overlooks what was formerly kno\\vn as Audubon Park, the nam.e given to that part nearest the Hudson of the tract of thirty-two acres once owned by Audubon. The Rev. Milo Hudson Gates, rector of the Intercession, has appointed a commHtee to co- operate with him as Chairman. lt is compos.ed of EdmundS. Whitman, one of the Church ·-vvar- dens; Miss M. E. Audubon, granddaughter of the naturalist; George Bird Grinnell, editor of Forest and Stream; George F. Parker, and John P. Leo. Among those who svill participate as speakers are ex-Judge Alton B. Parker, Richard Watson Gilder, Ernest ,...fhompson-Seton, the Right Rev. David H. Greer, Prof. Frank M. Chap1n.an, Presi- dent of the Audubon Societies, and G.eorg·e F. Parker, formerly United States Consul in Bir- Iningham. Audubon was the first great naturalist of this country. He covered North A1nerica thoroughly classifying the birds and painting each one. In the college library we have four 1nassive volumes of Audubon's colored plates of birds and two vol- umes of quadrupeds. We have also five large volumes of .d·escription. These books are exceed- ingly rare, only a few copies being extant. It is estimated that the books of bjrds alone would bring two thousand doHars. Amherst has decided to have no freshman base- bali team this year.

8 THE CONCOR'DIENSJS. THE NEW SONG BOOK. Edited by Byron W. Reed, ':06. After usual ·weeks of waiting and deTay, the new college song book, entitled, ''Songs of Union College,\' is ready for the public, and is on .sale at Robson & Adee's. The book is attractively ,covered, with a fine cut of Nott Memorial Hall on the outside. It contain.s all of the songs which beloT1g especially to Union, both the words and mus,ic, harmonized for male voices, including three new ones. This collection is something which fills a long felt need and n1erits a wide cir-- culaUon. It has been the aim of the editor to put these songs into such form that every under- graduate can possess them, and for that reason they are bound serviceably, but not expensively and the price is but half a dollar. The editor has undertaken this task ·with the full conviction that Union has as fine a collection of songs as any college in the country, and that rn.any of them deserve a much wider popularity than they have at present. The volume is dedicated to the class of Nine- teen Hundred and six. ALUMNI. ·s7.-\The oldest employe in the Treasury De- partment and probably in the entire government service celebrated his 94th birthday anniversary on the 19th of the present month. He is a New York man, William W. Dean, by name, and he has been working for nearly half a century in the internal revenue bureau of the Treasury Depart- ment. Mr. Dean was a preacher back in the Civil War days. He was in Washington at the close of that conflict and took up the work of sending \Vounded soldiers to their homes. In carrying out this charitable labor, Mr. Dean's sympathies frequent- ly caused him to spend more of his private income than he could \Vell afford. He concluded to seek Dean in 18'6 5, to a Ji>}ace in the Internal Revenue Bureau and he has been there ever since. Al- though a monogel'led:an Mr. Dean is in r·emark- ably good health. He is in full possession of all his faculties, a very sHght deafness be~ng the only evidence of his advanced age. He is still counted an excellent clerk, a.nd is enga.ged in passing on accounts of collectm-s. Mr. Dean takeS' :particular pride in maintain- ing a record for punctuality and attendat1ce that '\vould do credit to much younger clerks. He has gone ten years at a stretch without losing a sin- gle day on acount of sickness. The severest bliz- zard cannot keep 1dm at home, and no matter how high the mercury :runs Mr. Dean is at his desk promptly at '9 o'clock. During the past year Mr. Dean was sick '\dth the grip and lost two days from the office. It was the first Ume this had occurred for years and he was badly broken up over the marring of his record.-Brooklyn Daily Eagle. :1= * * * '80.-Edward B.

There are seventeen graduates of Union in De- tro.it and twe.nty-two throughout other parts of Michigan. Among those present at the reunion \.Yere: HoiL Charles La·wton, Regent of the Uni- ver~ity of Michigan, Ann Arbor; Tho.mas S. Mur- dock, :\orthville; F. J. Hoag, Toledo, Ohio, and Jasper C.

It has been officially announced that U11ion is to hold recitations on Saturday morning ne~t year. Wednesday afternoon will be given as a halE holi- day to make up for the time lost on Saturday. This is by no means a new idea here, but has been under consideration by the Faculty and trus- tees for several years. They have felt all along that it was the only pos~ible means of relieving the pressure on the other days of the \\vee 1c. espe- cially for the engitJ:eers. It is so1ne little consola~ tion to those who will experience this change, that chapel -will begin 1nuch later on Saturday morn- ing than on the other mornings of the \veek, thus leaving to the students the freedom. of Friday evening. The trustees were also encouraged in their desire to maJ{e a change by the fact that this system has proved very successful in the large majority of colleges.

The gan~e was very poorly :played as the score -willshow. Our team was nervous at first and the infield especially did not seem to get into the game. The R. P. I. men showed a lack of practice for their playing was ragged throughout. Hildreth was substituted for Davis in the box in the seventh inning. Harvey had to retire on account of an injured finger and Vogt took his place. Dwight took Vogt's place at short. The score by points follo\VS: R. P. I. P.O. A.
