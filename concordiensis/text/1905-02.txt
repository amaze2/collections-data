But the· .cable's are the 'ba.ckbone o•f a suspetnJstion bridge, and hen,c•e the vital part. It is tlhe one part of. thie construction that presents un- usual dliftic,ulties and te-sts the genius otf the erngi- ne•et:r1s..

In order to e.reet the ca.bles it ·was nec:essary firs1t to esltalbJ.ish a connection between the two to~w·et!'IS'. A reel of .s.t0e1 cable was moved on a float. at the N e;w York tower. nne end was drawn u1p. overr the tower and fa:stPnE'd to the a.ncthorage, while the reel w:rus. towed aJCirosst t!he river, 1 t'he ·cable paying oUJt and s1inking to the river 'bed.

Woodbury, assistant engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company of Boston, gave an illustrated lecture Tuesday night in the chapel on the subject, \Electrical Fire Haz- ards.\ After an introduction in which he discussed the application of electricity for illumination, Mr. Woodbury took up the subject of electrical con- veyance of power, showing the progress that has been made. He discussed at length the general fire hazard from short circuit, etc., and also took up the subject of the underwriters' rules. A sec- tion of the lecture was devoted to the advancement made by the application of underground wires as a means of safety from fire. The lecture through- out was illustrated with a number of stereopticon views by which the .speaker's remarks were clear- ly demonstrated. ASSIST ANT PHILIPPINE SERVICE.

N:OTES The Christian work that has bee-n so prominent in the city for the past few weeks fou.nd expres- sion on the hill in half-hour meetings held Jan. 24-27. Thursday being the day of prayer observed in all colleges the student Y. M. C. A. took advantage of Mr. Adams' offer to address them and throughout the week devoted a short time before dinner to the hearing of Christ's word. Mr. Adams is es- pecially fitted to talk to college men and the meet- ings were well attended. In them he brought out the value of Christian principles in the develop- m.ent of strong character and his hearers could not help but feel that only such a development makes us truly strong. The Association was represented at the ninth annual mid-winter conference of the Auburn The- ological Seminary by McGregor, '05. While the conference wa primarily for the students of the col .. lege and for the alumni, the Y. M. C. A.'s of nearby colleges were invited to send representatives. The general topic of the conference was \The Church and the Young Man.\ Different phases of the topic were presented and discussed at each session. It was the opinion of most of the speakers, that the young man of today wants the word of God told to him in the most plain and simple manner possible; that he requires of the minister, not only to preach Christianity to him, but to live it and to have a personality, that will draw men unto him. .Ainong the principal speakers w·ere: Rev. C. Waido Cherry, Troy, N. Y., \The Church's Method for Reaching Young Men;\ Rev. William R. Tay- lor, :b. D., Rochester, N. Y., \How Can the Church Best Use the Service of Young Men;\ Rev. George L. Curtis, Bloomfield, N. J., \The Pulpit's Message to Young Men;\ Dean Ensign McChesney, Syra- cuse University, \The Claim of the Ministry Upon Young Men.\ Holmes, ',0 5, led the Tuesday evening meeting, choosing for his subject, \Living Our Religion.\ , After considering the subject of the evening for a few moments, the meeting was given over to pres- ident E. M. Colvin of the Intercollegiate Prohibi- tion League, who in a short talk explained the pur- pose and workings of the league. Dean Ripton will continue his series of talks on the \Prophets at the Vesper service, Sunday at 5 o'clock. The February meeting of the cabinet was held Wednesday afternoon at Silliman Hall.

THE RE'PAJRING OF T:HE GYMNA,sl·uM It is said that when Dr. Towne first ·came to Union, on asking to see the gytnnasiun1 the President explained that in sutntner it was used as a hay barn and so the Doctor had to wait. Now a goDd farmer would say it was too damp and dingy a hole for even such a purpose and yet we were expected to take healthy exercise, cyvhere ha:v would rot. So much for the past, and if con1parisons aid us to appreciate new conditions every Union man should feel encouraged at the improve- ments now realized. Steam heat, electric lights, a remodeled locker room with service- able shower baths, a new entrance with broad stairways, besides a general overhaul- ing of the old and the adding of new appar- atus have cotnpletely changed this into a real gytn. The walls are to be painted up and there will be no more clouds of dust to fall when basketball is played. When a new floor can be put in it will be an attractive place for college dances as the new stairways and the removal of Dr. Towne's office to the basement ·make the main floor symetricaL This new floor may be going a little into the future but when it is such a small matter to complete a good work we hope some alum- nus will see that it is made possible at once. The fact stands that we have a serviceable gytnnasium and that tneans a centre of inter- est for winter activity. Let every 111an come out and take an interest in the track, basket- ball, or general exercise that it affords. By doin'g so college spirit will thrive through the winter and the lessons in good fellow~ ship taught by football last fall will not be forgotten. Any college to develop the best spirit must provide for the common interests of its students, so let us take advantage of this new opportunity and this winter, as last fall, work out our successes together and for Alma Mater.

l l THE CONCORDIEN.SIS. PI JUNIOR WEEK From Thursday, February 9, to the end of the week Union is to have what is to be call- ed a Junior Week. The idea was originated by the Junior Class to devote three days at the tirne of the Soiree to social enjoy1nent and at their petition the faculty granted Fri- day of this week a holiday. The fraternities are to give house parties for out of town friends and the following provisions have been anade for their entertainment: Thurs- day night, a Junior hop; Friday afternoon, the Allison-Foote prize debate and in the evening the Sophomore Soiree; Saturday afternoon the Musical Clubs give a concert and Satnrday night will be left for the frater- nities to entertain as they please. ATTENDANCE AT COLLEGE MEETINGS. It is a very deplorable fact that the attend- ance of the student body at college meetings is not what it should be. It shows a lack of interest in college affairs and a lack of ap- preciation of the duties college 1nen owe their fellow students. No one can deny that when a man comes to college, is registered, and begins his studies, he is from. the first an integral part of the college. . The bon or or disgrace that 1nay come to the college is, at the san1e time, his honor or his disgrace. Whatever he does, either good or bad, re- flects on his college and he is at no time and in none of his relations, considered independ- ent of the college. Now the primary duty a man owes his college is to show he is worthy of being a part of that college. How is he to do this? Surely not in holding aloof, in liv- ing by and for himself alone, receiving and giving' no advice as to his welfare or that of his fellow students. No, to live his part, a man must make hilnself fa1niliar with all the interests of college life and do his share toward acco1nplishing the best resu1ts for the college as a whole. The student body of a college is the col- lege, and finds utterance in the college 1neet- ing. The purpose of this nreeting is to dis-- ;cnss and pass on everything that pertains particularly or generally to th,e welfare of the student body, and attendance at, if not active participation in, this n1eeting, is of necessity the .duty of each college 1nan. . The situation at Union is getting tireson1e. Titne and again, on a 1V1onday morning, an upper ·classtnan will say, \Well [ guess I'll have to let it go today; there are not enough fellows here to n1ake it count.\ And so son1e question of interest to all is allowed to drop or worry along another week. But this dearth of n1en is not all. So1ne fellows, most noticeably under .classmen, V\rho are in attendance at the chapel exer- cises, slip out the 1ninute the chairman calls the college meeting to order. trhis co1nes from the students counting too n1 uch on 8-9 o'clock as a study period, thus forgetting for a 1non1ent their duty as n1en1 bers of the stu- dent body. Though college meetings are held on \Blue Monday,\ let not that keep you in bed, but rather may you realize that your attend- ance means a fuller attendance, that a full attendance means kee11 interest in college af- fairs that makes directly for better results and so for the broader development of col- lege activities. THESKATING RINK AND THE HYDRANT Considerable adverse criticis1n has be.en rnanifested lately toward the skating rink. This criticism is in a 1arge measure unde- served, for it is only just and honorable that the co1nn1ittee be given credit for what it has done. It succeeded in securing the services of q, contractor for a reasonable rert1ttnera- tion at a busy season of the year. The rink was laid out and levelled under climatic con- ditions by no tneans ideal, and t11e fact that it did not hold water the first tin1e it was put on is no proof that it is a failure. During the last month a sheet of solid ice has forn1ed in the area, due to thawing. and freezing and the only req 1:1isite 110\IV for a re-

The co1nn1ittee has not enough available funds to replace the hydt·an. t by a ne'v one, and is therefore unable to go ahead vvlth the rink. · But irrespective of the skating rink the uselessness of this hydrant shows n1ost clearly the predicament we are placed in as regards dangers frotn fixe. Realizing the need therefore of adequate fire protection to South College and the buildings in prox- in1ity, the college authorities, it is under- stood, are to see to it that, when the weather permits, the old hydrant will be replaced by a new one, of much greater capacity and in every way suitable for conditions on t:he hill. And thus incidentally will the .skating rink be given an itnpetus. COLLEGE BRIEFS.

THE ,CO.l\TCORDIE.iV.SIS. Ij idea of the changes to be rna;de in the college's program of recitations. The term is to be lengthened two weeks and a schedule is to be arranged by which the classes Will meet oftener. The classes are to meet daily or are to have morning, afternoon and evening sessions every other day. Also one or possibly two new subj:ects are to be added to the curricu- lum. The requirements for entrance were raised twelve regents po·ints on December 31, 1904. The fact that daily meetings -of the classes are considered, would seem to indicate that the fac- ulty bas plans for a new bV.ilding or new quarters of some kind. Our present quarters are far from satisfactory. The pharmaceutical laboratory is over crowded and the microscopy class is divided into two sections thus giving half the course pos- sible with larger quarters and more microscopes. .:A.t present the junior class fills the lecture room to its :utmost capacity and it would seem that either daily meetings or all day sessions every other day could not be arranged without conflict- ing with the Medical Department. Let us hope that this is so and that the long wished for build- ing will be the outcome. VESPER SERVICE.

THE CoNCORDIENSIS VOL. XXVIII. UNIOJ\T COLLEGE, FEB. II, 1905. No. r6 \WHAT CAN WE GET OUT OF BOOKS?\ A :Lectare by Hamilton Wright Mabie,LL. D. we can learn of men and of all things, which made them possible. ''X o man has yet lived and no man will ever live great enough to make a book out of himself. It is the ,,·orld that makes a book and not the Hamilton Wright Mabie, LL. D., delivered a individual genius of a man. It is the individual lecture in the college chapel yesterday afternoon on \What Can We Get Out of Books?\ Mr. Mabie said in part: \This is a busy age and a practical country, but I believe that there is just as much imagination, just as much bravery, just as much chivalry, today as there was in the 16th century. It is an age of commerce and we have become absorbed in our great work, but there is just as much bravery and enterprise now as there was then. genius of the man translating the genius of a race, or in some cases of half a dozen races. What Books Offer. \It is because books contain the wealth an.d genius of the world that we cannot afford to 1niss them. Books offer us two great things-vision and vitality.. Man's power is an exact proportion to his vitality, just as the supreme quality of books is their vitality. As long as n1en live they will read Ho1ner, for into the works attributed Business Educates the World. to that man the whole horde of nations have pour- \ Business has educated the \Vorld. Colleges ed their vitality. And I say to you men who are have never trained one-tenth the men that have been educated by the so-called 'business enter- prises.' It is because of the business at the bot- tom that higher education is possible at the top. \The great things of the world have been ac- complished not by the men of the dreamy nations, but by those of the great co1n1nercial countries. \Success is the visible show of a. man's accom- pUshment, of his work, and poor, indeed, is the man who has plucked success out of his business and failed to find it in his life. No man can un- derstand and hope to cope with the 20th century who does not know what has gone on in the world before him, and what great difficulties men have met and overcome. No man can live and be in-: telligent without a knowledge of the great dang- ers and difficulties which were disposed of in the building of that great house which vve call civili- zation. Knowledge Through Books. ''The only way that we can procure this knowl- edge is throug·h our great hooks. Through then1 going out into the world-never lose your vitality. And the greatest \\vay to preserve that vitality is to read your great books. No n1an has the right to say to you that the \Vorld will be easy, but every 1nan has the right to say that the world ·will be great to you in just the proportion that you are great. \And if this were the last opportunity I should ever have to speak to you I should say-don't let go your visions and your vitality. And to pre- serve then1 both, read your great bool\:s.\ Don't IVliss the Glee Club Concert. JUNIOR WEEK Union's first junior week is about over and it has proved a most successful one.

CHORUS. 0 Lord, deliver us, Oood Lord, deliver-liver-liver us, () Lord, deliver us, theological men, 1 ' economical men, i philosophical men, from _. l all Grecian men, \biological men,. all Roman men. This song will be sung at the Glee Club concert this aeternoon and several new verses, Inention- ing tih~ other members of the faculty will be brought out. Because of the recent death of the writer~ O'Nein, '97, who was killed in the Philli- pines, the song has special interest. Another one of his soNgs, \The Hikah! Hikah! Hikah! and the Rah! ::Rah! Rah !\ will be sung also. This is one ner of them, but these things seem only to fan the flame, and the work which I received from a dis- tance while in college with a good deal of resp.ect and fear and hesitation has become a j-oyful realit~ that almost carries me away at times. It is hard for one who hasn't seen to believe, Perhaps I had better begin with the difficulties. First of all there is the language. I have been here two years only and of course the language study has been rny chief interest. It is wonder- fully interesting and wonderfully difficult. There are, in fact, two languages to learn; the spoken and the written. The spoken is a local dialect, so that although after some years of residence I can speak it, I cannot be understood two hundred miles from Ningpo, so. quickly does the dialect change. But within a radius of a hundred miles are some five mHlion Chinese all speaking Ningpo, no lack of men ~to preach to. Then there ·is the difficulty of knowing the heart of the.? people. They think i:n their own way and make judgments after models of their own that seem little short of crazy to us at first acquaintance. Any one who has read Dr. A. H. Smith's \Chinese Characteristics\ can under- of the :finest of college songs and merits a hearty stand something of this. recepti011. And there is the difficulty of the climate with OUR ALUMNI IN CHINA. Ningpo, China, Nov. 2, '04. S. R. :Lewis, 204 Park Ave., Schenectady. My dear Mr. Lewis:- I gladly respond to your request to tell some- thing about mission work and mission life in this part ,o-f .China. I sincerely wish that the members of the Y. M. C. A. may become informed and en- thusia..stic about mission work and a1n glad to hear .that an effort to this end is being made. YQU may rest assured that if I can do anything to help on this thing I will be glad to do it. The ·Chief d:ifficulty in writing a letter from the field, its summer heat, malaria and mosquitoes. There is the difficulty of the form of missionary life, the grouping of a few people together for long periods of time, tempting to friction, clashing of purpose, methods, etc. These are a few of the challenges of the work to those who take it up, but the whole numbe-r of these challenges is not worthy to be compared either with the irnportance of the work or the ac- tual results obtained in it. The gospel has been preached in Ningpo some sixty years-there are several thousand Christians, thirty or more churches of various denominations, three hospi- tals, five schools of academic grade for boys and as many for girls. numerous lower grade schools, ,fs to be ~moderate in one's expressions. Too much one college to be opened and about fifty mission- enthu sias-rn begets distrust and a n1issionary who aries at work. is not enthusiastic in a high degree is a rare man. \iVe have difficuttles of course a.nd trials, all man- My o\vn work is just beginning. I am to have charge of one of the academic schools aforesaid.

THE CONCORDIENS!S. There are over sixty boys, more than half of them Christians. The aim of the school is to give the boys a Christian education by Western methods in the Bible, in science, elementary mathematics and in the English language. Most of the boys are boarders, they have their literary society and Y. M. C. A. and as far as I can see are altogether very much like a lot of American boys, except that they are not quite so full of mischief and are easier to control. The work among them is most hopeful for many of them confess Christ every year and the tone of the school seen1s, as far as I can hear, to be decidedly healthy. The Chinese boy gets old and serious much sooner than the American boy. Their schooling is costing them something and they mean business. To get such After thinki:ag the matter over I have two sugges .... tions: The first is that you give it to the .school to help some boy or boys who are po·or and find it difficult to get their education. There are a nu1nber of such boys. The second suggestion is that you give it to a small pr1ivate fui1d which we use here to establish industrial classes. These are classes chiefly of country -vvomen who spend half their time learning to read and the other half in learning some trade such as hat-making. This is undoubtedly the more needy form of the work; the boys can get on without aid, the \vomen cannot, for they must earn their living and must be helped while learning their trade. If you should decide to send the money to me, please remit by check to Chas. W. Hand, treasurer, 15 6 men (for the older ones are really men) to con- Fifth Ave., N. Y., and ask him to forward to me, fess Christ, means more than to frighten a lot of letting me know at some time what you have harum-carum boys by a revival into sudden con- done. fession. One can see the whole thing as plain With many thanks for this chance for a ·word as can be out here. The whole nation is chang- with you and hoping to write you again, I am ing, slowly but surely, opposition is melting, the demand for education is louder than ever all over the Empire. The boys who are studying in mis- sion schools will be guiding the nation in twenty or thirty years. It is Japan all over again on a big scale. Can you wonder that it is absorbingly interesting to teach such boys and that the diffi- culties and trials of the work are not to be com- . pared with its pleasures and results? I wish I had you Y. M. C. A. men in front of me. I could make you see it more plainly than by a letter. I wish I might persuade some of you to come out here and put a few n1.ore shoulders to the wheel. And as for the rest, who cannot come, I would be glad to know that you remember the work and do your part in furnishing the sinews of war. Union College has done something for China. Dr. Nevins, one of the most honored of missionaries to China was a Union man. The senior member of our mission, Dr. T. M. W. Farnham, is a Union man. Doubtless there are others and I trust there will be more. You speak of a small sum of money that you would like to give to some definite missionary work and ask for suggestions as to its disposal. Sincerely yours, HARRISO~ K. WRIGHT, '99. COLLEGE BRIEFS.

H. Peebles (' 0 6) alternate, who ,in behalf of the Adelphic Society support the negative. All are capable speakers and will do their respective societies full justice.

UNDERGRADUATE LAW. In a recent issue of the Concordiensis there appeared a letter containing the fol- lowing sentence: \I also think it would be wise to have a con11nittee of upper classtnen codify the rules governing the election to all college and class officers.\ The idea here expressed is surely worthy of serious consideration on the part of the student today. Let us n1ake the suggestion rnore general in effect. \l\,f ould it not be beneficial to college activities to systen1atize afl the precedents, Ull\Vtitten. laws and rules in regard to all organizations receiving stu- dent support and cornn1ittees appointed by the san1e?

In short, why does not the student body which is self-governing possess son1e authority to which they n1ay refer? Precedent and un- written laws are at tin1es unstable supports. Finally as an aggressive step, let the president of the Senior class appoint a c.o111- 1nittee and this con1n1ittee draft a \consti·- tution,\ so called for the lack of a better nan1e, which shall be subn1itted for ratifica- tion by the student bocly and which shall ,, j: ' ...

BASKET BALL~ A £ew weeks ago Dr. T()\vne took the trouble to attend college Jneeting and en- dea vot·ed to arouse interest i11 a series of in- terclass basketball 'gan1es, looking to the organization, ~1ext year, of a tean1 fit to represent the college. 1'his is not visionary) in truth, it is in a fair way to becon1e an ac- con1plished fact. We have H1e 111en in col- lege who can play basketball and, n~oreoverJ we believe that those men are not any n1ore than 50 per cent poorer players than those in other colleges of our size. It has been out of the question to orga11ize this year, chiefly because of the con eli ti()n of the gyn1. But that has been repaired, to son1e extent. At this tin1e, however, we. can do the next best thing; we can get into trirn for next year. That was Dr. To\vne's idea and follow- ing out that idea he has arranged a sched- ule for practice periods and gaines for the classes. But the response fron1 the fellows has not been what it shonl cl be. True, the classes have elected officers and a few 111en go around once in a \\Nhile for practice. But that ,vill not n1ake tean1s this year or a win- ning tean1 next year. It is up to those fel- lo-vvs who have ever played basketball to vvake up, to go out and get bnsy. They need the exercise, at any rate. What's the sense of lying around all winter and just putting on fat? BASE BALL. The publication of the schedule in last week's nun1ber brings the fact once tnore to tnind that spring is con1ing--so1ne titne- and vvith it one n1ore athletic season, the re- sult of which for Union depet1ds on us. Arc we going to continue the record of last fall's football tean1 or are we going to sit by with folded hands. trusting that ()tlf baseball vvill thrive on the reputation of the football, whether \\Ve work or not? Much credit is due to l\1anager Thotnson for the schedule ; it is well balanced, shows so1ne new natnes and more old ones, and contains gan1es with teams which, almost without exception, are in our class. Mr. Thomson has certainly done his part, it now remains for the fellows to do the rest. Let us speak here ol a somewhat deplor- able but nevertheless customary habit with new 1nen. We have heard it this year as before; that query, \What places are va- cant?\ They are all vacant; every position is waiting to be filled by the best man that the college affords, be he old or new. The nevv man that holds back because the place he would play was held by sotneone still in college is lacking in spirit. EYen if he can- not n1ake his position at once, he can spur the other man on to greater exertions to hold the place he has earned, and in this way, at least, he wil help to build up a team that will be a credit to our college and one of vvhich he wjll not be ashan1ed vvhen. he tneets men from other colleges and is com- paring notes with then1. So, -vvhen Capt. Hagar issues his first call, which will con1e soon now, let every man who has ever played baseball get out and n1akc a try; let us break the record for the size of our indoor squad.

At Sundays vesper seryice Dean Ripton began his talks on the prophets, taking Samuel as the first of the series. HThe prophets of Israel were great public char- acters and leaders of the people's politics. At first they were only seers or overseers of public business but later were given the title of pro ph f't.

I2 T.HE COf\lCORDTENSJS. Samuel was a great statesman and th.e rast of the judges of Israel. He possessed the sense of eternal truth which gave hin1 his claim to prophecy. This fact is shown in his saying: \To obey is better than sacrifice.\ He wished to establish in Is1·ael a ki:nd of repubHcan govern- ment directed by the judges but the people were not ready for it and insisted upon havfng a. king in spite of Samuel's picturing to them. the op- pressions and hardships a monarchy weuld bring. The unity of Israel was moral and spiritual, just as the I.'eal unity of nations today. A :moral re- form was necessary before the people could. have the best kind of government and SamNel yielded because he saw this. rrhe people had. rejected the right and Samuel told them they had rejected the Lord. Samuel's greatness .as a statesman tay in his ability to see the ideal way of living. Y. M. C. A. NOTES At the Vesper service Sunday, a splendid ser- vice will be held in observance of the universal day of prayer for students. The first part of the meeting will be devoted to special prayer, after which Dr. Ellery will deliver an address on \The Godliness of Christ.\ tention of His way. The p'laee whieh the early Christians gave to pr~yer in their activities con- stitutes one ·of the principal causes -of their .spir- itual triumphs. - The history of the various Chris- tian st1:1.dent movements .of the wo:r1cl shows that all their greatest achievements have been inaug- urated and carried foil:·ward in the power of prayer. The spiritual needs of the stu.dent world will not be met nor its vast spiritual possibilities realized apart from JJrayer. 'The largest mani- festation of the Spirit of Christ in the student com:m unities waits on the faithful and fervent petitions of men who l!>eHeve in God. I·n view of considerations like these, to what exercise can Christians devote themselves which win accom- plish so much as by giving themselves to inter- cession on behalf of the students of the world from whose ranks come a disproportionately large number of teachers in the many spheres of thought and action. \That the observance of the day 1nay be profi- table, wise and reverent use should be made of those means which in a..ctual experience have been found. to be most helpful. \Have at least one meeting on the Day of Prayer in which Christian students will unite .in earnest prayer for the students of the world.

Eight of the classes are in fraternity houses. There are 4 mission study groups, with an enrollment of 50. The Association of . .the UnHed States Military Academy at West Point is surpassing its fine work of last year. There are 3 70 members. The weekly religious meeting averages 120. There is a mission study ctass with 16 enrolled and 35 .Bible study groups with 26 0 cadets as members. At Syracuse University membership in the As- sociation is confined to those who are willing to do Christian work. At present there are 243 members, but the. number could be easily raised to 800 or 1,000. The thoroughness of the work is shown by the fact that this year there are 46 Bible classes.

'98 THE ALLISON FOOTE DEBATE Won by Philomatheans The annual Allison-Foote prize d~bate between the Philomathean and Adelphic societies \vas held last Friday afternoon, forming one of the attrac- tions of Junior Week. The whole debate \vas most interesting, both sides showing the resuit of careful and conscienciouR preparation. The rebuttal arguments were very clever and showed a complete grasp of all phases of the subject. The question was \Resolved That Russia is justified in her effort to control an ice free port on the Pacific.\ The affinnative \vas upheld by Harry A. Sylvester, '06, Floyd Jt. Miller, '06. and Morvis T. Raymond, '0 5, for the Philorna,- theans. The negative of the cruestion was taken by the Adelphic society, represented by Benjami'.1 Adelphics. The 1nain line of argument given by the a.ffil- mative was as follows: The economic and social conditions of Russia require a commercial outlE\. in the far East. Siberia's future prosperity, and consequently Russia's, require an outlet ·for hec vast mineral and agricultural i·esources. Lastly, every nation that has ever attained any lasting importance has attained it by contact with other nations in a commercial \vay. The line of argument offered by the neg8li \ 7 € differed considerably from that of the affirmctlive. the two sides not getting together as much ac;: .-~._, they might have done. Mr. Mooers openecl his side by showing that Russia's state of civiliza-tion was low and that her specific acts in obtaining Port Arthur were wrong. The others of that side devoted their time to the argument that R us- sia was not justified in controlling Port Arthur and Manchuria unless she had a greater need for them than any other nation and unless she had reached a higher degree of civilization than any other country which might need them. The claims of Japan to the same territory were thc'!l brought for\vard. Jt was also shown that the civilization of Russiia \vas at a low ebb and that, economically, she couldn't occupy Manchuri.t, and consequently, couldn't keep Port Arthur.

In this way Inany out- of-town guests were enabled to attend every function throughout which added greatly to the success of the week. On Saturday evening the fraternities entertained their guests separately, holding either a dance, sleighride, or card party. The week was very prettily inaugurated with a Junior Hop on Thursday evening· at Yates' Boat House. It was one of the nicest dances of its kind ever held at Union and Parsons and Rubens were at their best. The patronesses were: r.rhe Mes- dames.

Lecture by Gen. J. S. Wilson On Friday morning, February 1Oth General James Grant Wilson delivered a lecture, in the Chapel, entitled \Reminiscenses in which he spoke about Washington, Lincoln and Grant. The lecture included many stories and facts regarding Washington, and especially many things told General Wilson by the friends and de- scendents of the father of his country. Beside the allusions to Washington General Wilson spoke of his personal acquaintance with nearly all the great men of the Civil War times, and especially did he pay tribute to the two fore- n'lost men of that time, Lincoln and Grant. He told many stories illustrating the greatness of these two men, of the humor and diplomacy of ta1ked on the .:'Principles of Electro Chemistry.\ The room was crowded and though many stood up through it all they were well repaid. The lecture wa:s thoroughly enjoyed for several rea- sons. The speaker was interestin..g persona1 1 1Y, he was straight forward, made his ideas clear, a.nd experimented a great deal. During his lecture he illustrated the ·conductivity 0>f various sub- stances; water, sugar, acetic acid, sodium acetate, and hydrochloric acid. He also experimented with some freezing mixtures. Though Dr. Wit- ney by no mea,ns exhausted his subJect a lot could be learned from what he sa:1d. It may be well to mention that the physical labratory is an excellent place to hold lectures of ihi.s kind. The needed apparatas is handy and can easily be obtained and the light is better than that in the chapel. The Glee Club Concert Among the many entertainments which serve·-'l to mark last week as one of the 1nost if not the most festive in Union's history, was the Glee Club matinee concert in the State St. Methodist church. f\pplause and laughter was plentiful-perhap~ tho occasional breaks really helped toward the suc- cess of the concert. Chair-handling and piano- moving figured in the rendering of the program; and, the number in which one naif of the cluh knew not (not apparently cared) what the other half played, served at least to remove for gooJ the studied :soberness of face which seems so ()ften to characterize the glee-musician-an anomoly isn't it?

'The lecture was of special interest as thes-e dynamos are manufactured exclusively by the General Electric Co-mpany. Y. M. C. A. NOTES Last Sunday was observed as the universal day of prayer for students. At the Vesper service, the call for the observance of the day, as issued by the Int€rnation.al committee was read, after ... which about twenty ninutes was spent in earnest prayer, not only for our own association by for the whole movement. Prof. Ellery then gave a short discourse on the Godliness of Christ. Tak- h1:g his scripture lesson from Isaiah 53, he showed that while the human and the divine sides of Christ were both important, in consi{[ering one, we should always keep the other in mind. Hav- ing spoken_ of the hurnan nature of tChrist in a previous meeting, he devoted the rema1nder of his talk to the God nature of Christ. In. drawing a lesson, he stated that, there are good characteris- tics in every person, a11d they are the same kind as the Godliness of Christ, but different in degree. Dean Ripton will speak at the Vesper service next Sunday. The following books have recently b€en donated to the a.ssociation library. Peloubet's Select Notes 18 9,4 and 18 9 5; The Higher Criticism, by Rev. C. W. RisheH; University Lectures on the Ten Commandments, by S. D. Boardman; Inebriety \by C. F. Palmer.

TO OUR ALUIVINL That a college is dependant on its Ah1n1ni for real success cannot be denied. This should be especially apparent to Union tnen for the blighting effects of the old quarrel \\'\vhich produced a divided and indifferent Altunni is still within the n1e1nory of n1any. It \vas a hard struggle to out grow this weakened state but thanks to all healing titne and tireless efforts of our President Union stands today strong and healthy; calling loudly upon her sons for aid to push on. Son1e Alun1ni think hat because they are not wealthy this aid 111ust con1e frotn others but that is vvrong for each has his part to do. One would not look upon Har- vard as being in great need of n1oney yet there are several of her Alutnni though of slender n1eans who see fit to send her sn1all sutns £ron1 tin1e to titne. Such a recogni- tion of the debt we owe our Allna lVIater tnay be observed by all vvith the double pleasure that cotnes when we help a noble cause. Few colleges have a past as bril- liant as ours. Can any of us study the great Civil v\1 ar period \vithont feeling a thrill of pride when we read the na1ne of Seward? It vvas at Old Union that he forn1ed his character. She is our n1other, to be loved as dearly by us as by that great sta tesn1an. ]=>resident Tappin the 1naker of the University of Michigan is anoth.er good exa1nple of the Union training, nor has this vital pO\iVer that produces great tnen left ·our halls. One law department in recent years graduated \Villia111 l\ 1 IcKinley and the Detnocrats savv fit last fall to non1inate another grad nate, Alton B. Parker, for the presidency. This record is our con1111on birthright and we tnay justly feel proud of it. That each Ah1n1nus 1nay keep in tonr.h with Union's needs and progress, let hin1 take the \Concordi\ or the Union lTniver- sity quarterly since active interest in her publications helps the undergraduates and brings to the \grad'' recollections of life's happiest days.

THE RUTGERS DEBATE. On April 7th Union is scheduled to d~­ bate Rutger's college in Schenectady. Fo:· the last three years we have clebated Rut- gers and lost each tin1e. But this is not a case of three tin1es and out. Vve are going to tackle thetn again this year, rnore de- tern1inecl than ever and 11111st win. vV e can do it if we n1ake use to the hest advantage of the 111aterial we have in college. Last year three n1en went to R ntgers not chose~·1 by cotnpetition but because they -were the onlv ones who \vanted to trv. Thus the\r ~ ~ did not truly represent the college. 'fhey 1night have been the best n1en but there was no way of proving it. 1'hey gave Rut- gers a close rub yet they had to face their opponents having 1nissed the opportunity and lacking the experience of hard cotnpet:- tion for places on the tean1. Let it not he the san1e -vvay this year. There is no doubt that we have excellent debating tnaterial in college. The Allison-Foote debate shovve<l this. Dr. Hale says his argun1ental1ou class is doing good vvork. Now \iVhat ;,; needed first in training for the de bate with Rutgers is the con1petition of a large nun1- ber of n1en. ()nly hy starting with ntany and sifting down to a fe\v can \Ve obtain the best results. On Friday. February 24 the first trial will be helcl. 1\ snbject has been given out either side of which can be taken by the speakers and presented in a short speech. Fron1 these 1nen a prelinlin- ary selection of six will be n1ade. These six will con1pete later in a regular dehatP, the three best to represent us when Rutgers con1es here in i\pril. This is an excellent opportttnity to sho-:v'~r college spirit this vvin- ter. Let there be ten to fifteen 1nen ready to give a good account of thetnselves next Friday. THE LECTUR,E COURSES. President Raytnond in chapel last \veek very tersely described the apparent attitude of the college n1an toward lectures supple- nTentary to the regular courses, or at least toward one class of such lectures: n1incl if its good or not, bolt if yon \~ever ,, can. Unquestionably, however, there is a lot of good to be gotten fron1 then1. If the lec- tures happen to be along· the line of a 111an 's own work the benefit to be had fron1 then1 is so evident as to 111ake discussion riclicnlous. If they are not abottt one's particular \vork, yet their value is great. 'rhey broaden a tnan's education, they -vviclen his knowledge of the work of the -vvorlcl, relieve hin1 of the idea that his chosen profession is the only one of consequence, and give hin1 a whole- sotne respect for tnen in every \valk of life. In the next place, aside fro1n specific in- forn1ation received, no one with any cap- acity of appreciation at all can listen for an hour to such a n1an as l\1 r. l\Iabie for in- stance, without absorbing a little of his en- thusiastic personality and gaining a lasting· in1petus in the struggle for culture. Finally there is rnore n1ental training· than perhaps n1ost of us realize in the effort to grasp a subject as presented by a lecture and in follo\ving a precise ancl scientific n1ind, l\tir. \Vhitney's for exa1nple-, alo11g its course of reasoning. In the large uni- versities there is plenty of training- of this sort in the regular work, tnany subject~ be- ing taught wholly in this way. but -vvith us this is not so and no man should fail to a vail hin1self of every opportunity for such cle- veloptnent vvhich the supplen1entary lec- tures afford.

I2 THE COl\rCORDIENSIS. UNION COLLEGE HYMN Air \Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory\ By Joseph Edgar OdeU, '74. 1.-In the upward climb of learning there was Union in the van, And Old Union of her riches proffered wealth of mind to mar1, And legions crested with her crown their conquering course began, Loved Allna Mater's men. Chorus. Shout for Alma lv.Iater hoary, Ever sing her honored story, Never dim nor blight the glory Of Union and her men. 2. vVe have marched with night battalions clad in sheeted masquerade, Consigned perplexing texts to rest by aid of speech and spade By rush and other carnage, features -,yrecked and havoc made, Oh, happy days dawned then. Chorus. 3. May glories of the ancient days gild Union's halls with light, And victories of years gone by still daring deeds invite, Let Union's fame and well-loved name mean honor, truth, and right To all of Union's men. Chorus. 4. Vast seas and sums and spaces we can measure and define, But the status of true greatness pen can never trace by line The wonder-glow of Godlike souls is Gran- deur's self, divine, In great and noble men. Chorus. 5. And in the great Hereafter when we walk the golden shore, May coming generations flock to Union's shrine the more, And gather there the treasures that no mines nor vaults can store And live for Union then.

REVIEWS. Although \Routine and Ideals,\ by Le Baron R. Briggs of Harvard is not one of the books of the month having been published last November, we wish to make reference to it because of its peculiar interest to college men. Dean Briggs ·writes with the knowledge gained from long and intimate fellowship with students and this, his latest book, will be found full of inspiration by all who read it. The following quotations will give some idea of the direction of his thought and the directness of his style: \The older I grow, the more strongly l feel that the best thing in man or woman is being there. Physical bravery which is always inspiring ts surprisingly common; but the sure and steady quality of being there belongs to comparatively few. Now being there is the result of these things-intelligence, constant practice and some- thing hard to define but not too fancifully called an ideal. Of intelligence everybody can see the need; but not everybody knows how little quick- ness of mind is required. As Senator I-Ioar once told the highest scholars in college, much of the good work in the world has been-that of dull men who have done their best. Moderate intel- ligence wUh devotion behind it aad with constant exercise in the right direction has produced some of the most valuable men and women. The best thing educati·on can do is to make moral charac- ter efficient through mental discipline. i .j , I ) \ \ i l l l I, ' I' l I

i .j , I ) \ \ i l l l l I THE CO·NCG·RDIElVSfS. 15 In one of our best schools f0r boys the o-lder and stronger pupils are called \prefects\ and are put in positions of responsibiUty which bring them into dose relation with the masters. They do not govern the school; they are subject to the masters; but they are consulted b-y: the masters as best representing the state of mind of the boys in general and as best interpreting to the boys in general the state of mind of the ma.sters. They are the maturest boys and in their responsibility they increase their maturity. As a result the school best known for its prefects system sends to Harvard College, nearly every year, .at least one youth who stands out in his larger surroundings as a leader. In one year three of the class presi- dents in Harvard College were from that school, which sends us not more than about fifteen boys a year; and they were presidents of classes in which five or six hundred young fellows had the right to vote for class officers. Moreover, many boys from this school keep in college the atti- tude of the prefect, the recognit'on that the main object of student and college officer is one and the same,-to do the best that can be done for every student ·who comes to the Un:versi.ty; to keep him if he can be made worth keeping, and otherwise, for the good of the place and for his own good, to send him a way, though seldom or never without a hope of coming back.

' ) :t JE CoNCORDIENSIS v~oL. LYXVIII. UNJOAl COLLEGE, FEB. 25, 1905. !Vo. 18 WESTERN EXPERlE:N~GES Union Man Tells of Cow Punching There La;st year I wrote a short article for the Con- cordiensis in which I told in a brief way about my work in connection. with the grazing prob-: lems of the state of Washington. During the past season my time was spent in taking care of the government experiment station in the Wenat- chee Mountains, twenty-six miles north from El- lensburg; and in inspecting a number of large pastures in that general vicinity. The object in inspecting these pastures was to ascertain as nearly as possible the carrying capacity of the stock ranges of that region, and also to learn the best methods for handling stock in such areas. As the total area of the pastures aggregated some 200,000 ac.res the greater part of my time was spent in the saddle. The best way to give an idea of this work and incidentally to give some idea of the life of a cattleman will be to tell of one of these trips of inspection. On the tenth of June I left Ellensburg for the Wenatchee Mountain station with a saddle-horse and pack-horse, the latter carrying three weeks' rations, a roll of blankets, a cooking outfit, a five by seven camera, and a portfolio for collecting botanical specimens. On reaching the station I found that, except for so1ne klootchmen (Indian WOlnen) who were camped there, that I was the first arrival since the snow had left. These In- dians come to this place every year to dig \ahnne puss\ (a species of Claytonia) and \Cammas the bulbs of which they use for food. After spending three days in looking over the station I started on a short trip to visit some of the nearby cattle ranges. One of these, belong- ing to Messrs. Cook and Bull of Ellenburg. I was especially anxious to see. These men had pur- chased some 30,000 acres the year previous; and were just completing the twenty-eight 1niles of fence necessary to enclose it from the outside range. This pasture had been very badly ov€r- grazed in the past few years by nomadic sheep and: was consequently in a very bad state of de- pletion. I had therefo.re promised to ride ·over this range with the owners in order· to sugg;est methods of improvement. I reached their camp in the middle of the af- ternoon some five days later. As they were evi- dently away at work somewhere I unsaddl·ed my horses and turned them out to graze, and, after getting something to eat, started out to do som.e botanizing-. On returning to camp about sun- down I found that Mr. Bull and his cow puncher had gotten back and were getting supper. About eight o'clock Mr. Cook and his two boys arrived and we all had supper. After planning the next days \Vork we all turned in for the night. They had just finished fencing and the next day were going to begin \riding their range\ to \cut out the stray cattle\ that had gotten in before the fence was completed, and to gather the stoek that was to be branded. As I could see their range to the best advantage by riding -vvith fhe:m. I told them that they could count on me as an extra man. The next morning we got up about five o'clock. As soon as breakfast was over and we could get saddled up we started out in three parties, each party having a definite area to cover in order that no cattle should be missed. Our object ,in this ride was to gather all \strays\ (cattle not be- longing to Cook & Bull, easily recognized by hav- ing brands not used by these men), all the stock to be branded, and all dry cows that \\Vere fat enough for beef. About noon all three :parti~es arrived at the place where the strays were to be sorted out and we commenced \cutting.\ This was done by three of the party holding the bunch-some three hundred head-while the other three cut out. In cutting out one of the

I I : ·; i ' ' ·l 'I ,, ! .. I I I I I 6 THE CONCO/{JJJE~.'VSIS. men rode into the bunch until he found an animal that was to g0 out. He then gradually worked the animal toward the edg.e of the bunch where by making a quick jump \Yith his horse he would separate it from the bunch. Before it could get back one of the others would ju1np his horse in between the animal and the bunch and turn it back. They would then chase it into the stray bunch which the third one helQ. from getting back to the main bunch. After the strays had been cut out, and the cattle that were not wanted had been turned back, the remainder were driven into the holding pasture-a small pasture of three hundred acres where the stock could be held un- til wanted. vVe then went back to camp and after getting lunch and changing saddle horses, started out on another ride in which the morn- ing's work \vas repeated. By the time we had gotten through and had eaten supper it was mid- night. The next day was a repetition of the first. On the third morning we gathered all the stock in the holding pasture and drove them into the corrals. After they were all corraled we began branding, taking the calves first as they were the easiest. One of the men would rope and throw the calf and hold it down while another would brand and mark it. The marking consisted in ear marking, or cutting a definite shaped piece from either the right or the left ear (each brand having its own ear mark) and in dewlapping. In this state the cattlemen not only use brands and earmarks but they also use dewlaps to help iden- tify their stock, thus it next to impossible for a \cattle rustler\ to change all the marks without getting caught. Dewlapping consists in cutting a narrow strip of the hide in such a manner that it will hang down in a kind of a string, each man using a different place or method in cutting his dewlap. After the calves were finished the fun began. Messrs. Cook and Bull had been buying several hundred head of cattle and a large num- ber of these were to be rebranded. These in- cluded one, two, and three year old steers and cows. Nowadays it is customary to drive the larger animals that are to be branded into a chute where the work can be done with very lit- tle trouble, and with v.e:ry little wear and tear on the animals themselves. As we had no chute and as the corral was too rough :for a horse to be used advantageously we went after them on foot. One of us would catch an animal either 'by the front feet or by the horns and then make a quick snub of the other end of the rope around one of the logs of the corral. As soon as the animal was snubbed someone else would catch it by the hind feet and throw it. The animal was then tied down until it was branded and marked. After it was b1.:-anded the ropes were taken off and it was allowed to get up again. In this work we were obliged to keep our eyes open for they would quite frequently \get on the peck\ (get mad and want to fight.) Whenever that happened we would all make a scramble for the fence until they should cool off. Once I was just going to rope a calf when the cowpuncher yelled for me to look out. I looked around and saw a cow ready to toss me. I made a quick dodge just in time to prevent it. A little \later a steer started for one of the other men. He tried to get away but stumbled and fell, and. the steer not having time to stop, went on over him. Before the steer could turn the man was on the fence with the rest of us. Another time a cow got Mr. Cook behind a tree and kept chasing him around until one of the boys caught her and snubbed her up so quick that she stood on her head, which diverted her at- tention long enough for him to join the rest of us in our usual place of retreat. These little in- cidents are co1nmon occurences in the life of a cattle man and simply give a little spice to the work and help to break the monotony. We finished branding about noon the next day, and then started to ride the lower end of the pasture, some fifteen miles down the canyon. On this trip Mr. Cook and. myself made the long :r:ide, following down the canyon nearly to the Colum- bia River and then climbing up onto the range of low mountains that ran back toward camp. This ride (of some thirty or more miles) was made partly to be sure that there were no cattle at the extreme end o.f the pasture and partly to enable me to see the more arid portions of their range --'·.- :, i '' '-'! ~ .~ -~ \ 1 .i I. l: ' I'

We caught up with the rest about .six o'clock and helped them drive the cattle back to camp. Fortunately it was a moonlight 11ight ifo1· by the time that we had gotten the strays cut out and gotten supper it was after one o'clock. We got up again about four and after co111.pleting the branding, ibrok.e camp. They were going to dtive a bunch of cattle to the valley but as it w,ould take them until the next morning I went on ahead, reaching Ellensburg in time for supper. J. S. COTTON. UN'ION WINS Defeats R. P. I. in Relay Race For the first time in years Union trained a team this winter for an indoor, intercollegiate tra:ck event and last Wednesday easily won from R. P. I. in a one-mile relay race. The occasion ·was the big athletic carnival in the Troy Armory held under the auspices of the Troy Central Y. M. C. A. Several colleges, schools, Y. M. C. A.'s, .Athletic Clubs and Military Companies competed in the numerous events including the high jump, shot put, novice and handicap runs and relay races. Yale captured the mile run, and high jump, and Williams the shot put and 600 yard run. Un- ion's entries were confined to the relay race with R. P. I. For this event we had entered Norwood, Von Dannenberg, Waldron, Hafley, McNab and Shutler. These six men had shown up so evenly in practice that up to the day of the meet it was a toss up which four would be picked to run. The final choice of the runners was based on their experience more than anything else and McNab, Norwood, Von Dannenberg and Waldron DR. STEINMETZ LECTURES 1 Great Scientist Gives an Interesting Talk The week's ;regular Tuesday evening lecture was given by Dr. Stein1netz, who spoke on \:Sdence and ·Engineering.'' The lecture was weH attended, there being present besides the facu Uy and students a number from the Electric worl{S. The talk was based upon the developn:J.ent of facts, laws and theories and how upon these both. science and engineering, which are so close- ly r€1lated, are based. He said in part: \All modern science is based on experiences. Fott ndation of all science and applied science, or engineering is the imperical facts discovered by experiment or accident. Facts are the funda- ments of our scientific knowledge. The great nu:rnber of facts on which science is based makes necessary the classification of these facts and their arrangem,ent into imperical laws. '''In representing facts by theories we really add things, for we al\vays have the co-ordination of the facts concerned and also something else. In the case of the Newtonian and the later theor- ic•s of light, each one contains some fact, with the addition of other supposed facts, ·which ren- del- the theory not a law. Most chemical theor- ies are of this nature. '.:In the consideration of electrical la\VS, elec- tricity is measured ahn::tys by the product of quantities. Though the product of these gives a real physical quantity, the quantities -vvhich make up the product are nothing but mathe- matical fiction. In explaining the production of electromoti.ve force the idea of a magnet cut- ting the lines of force in a magnetic force is a very useful picture, as far as it reaches, but after aH it is nothing more than a picture and there were selected to run in the order named. Each are cases where the idea does not apply. man ran his best, increasing the lead with each \All theories must represent the effects fol- relay and when Waldron :finished the race for Union, Gifford, R. P. I.'s crack man, was over .fifty yards behind. By w·inning this race the team won for them- selves individual medals, and for the college, a silver cup. lowing the facts which are stated. In ages ago th€ minds of people were different. People thDught they could understand action across a distance. Now we do not beHeve in action ex- cept through a medium. ''After all a theory is only a tool, but cannot

r / i ·' 8 THE CONCORDIEA!S!S. be used for work ·outside that for which it was desig·ned. Any mind can apply a theory to the \\ 7 ork for which it was made, but the things which come outside the field of the theory is what is le.ft for the engineer and scientist. The general trend of science now is to take things for granted. One theory is founded upon another without thorough investigation of that theory, un- til a theory is built up which vades farther and farther from the truth. On the other hand there is a tendency to change existing laws where there is no reason for doing so which will overcome the inconvenience, expense and tendency to mix up things, which will result. \And so I have tried to show that experhnen- tal facts are represented by imperical laws, that from these laws are developed theories, and that on these facts, laws and theories are based science and engineering.\ DEATH OF ALBON MAN A Famous Inventor, Soldier and Lawyer A recent issue of the Brooklyn \Eagle\ says: \Albon Man, the eminent la\vyer, soldier and in- ventor, died at the Hotel St. George, Saturday night, of paralysis, \vith \Vhich he ·was attacked last DecenJ.ber. He had been in a semi-conscious condition for the past ten days and his death was peaceful.\ Following this is more than a column, paying an eloquent tribute to the memory of a man th,is state.

His desire was to remain with his old comrades throughout the war. After the close of the war, Majo·r Man was put in charge of one of the bureaus of the National Treasury, later resuming the practice of his pro- fession in New York, continuing this until a short tirne before his death. He was counsel for and manager of several large estates, among them. that of the Lorillards. Put he \Yas eve11 more noted fm.· his activity along scientific lines.

He received the degree of Ph. D. from Union. After his death, forty of his personal friends and aesociates met at the Hotel St. Georg0, Brooklyn, and passed resolutions of appreciatior: and condolence.

TELEPHONES A highly interesting and instructive lecture was delivered before the senior and junior elec- tricail engineers lVL'onday morning on \Tele- phones'' by Mr. Baker of the General Electric Co. The lecturer dwelt at length on. the iletnen- tary theory of telephones, taking up the work of Reis, Bell, Hughes and Dolbear. The constructi:on and operation of the magneto telephone was fuLly explained and illustrated by mea~11s of suitable apparatus. The flo\V of the electric current in. the telephone was especially well shown . The lecture is the first of a series to be deliv- ered by the speaker on the same subject. Tte ·Pattersonville Concert Friday evening the Glee and Instrumental Clubs took the car to Hoffmans, were ferried across the Mohawk and found waiting for them three sleighs with plenty of straw and blankets; there follow- ed a ride up-hill through drifts and pit-holes for about three miles to \The Church in the Valley by the Wildwood.\ When, on arriving, it was found that supper would come \after the con- cert,\ it was surprising with what alacrity the rnen donned their dress suits. The church contained a good sized audience, most of them having come in sleighs and cutters from the surrounding farms. They were very appreciative and encores were plentiful. The Glee Club and Quartette, in spite of the - weariness caused. by singing and yelling on the way up, made a very creditable appearance and were compelled to sing again and again. The lack of a piano and the difficulty of get- ting in tune, coupled with some species of stage- fright caused the Instrumental Club to come so near to breaking down at one time that the leader called out, \Sh! play softly,\ which they were well able to do; but the audience didn't seem to notice any thing amiss. The best part of the trip came after the con- cert; a country supper and plenty of it. The drive back was entirely do·wn-hill, and the pit- holes caused some exciting times. As a practice concert, it was a success, in showing just where the clubs need further practice.

This shows not only that the college in general is dis- playing n1ore interest than for so1ne years in track athletics, but also that V\'e have in colleg-e excellent 1naterial fro1n which to de-· velop a good track tean1 in the spring. There are three necessary elements that go to the n1aking of a good representative colege tea111 in any branch nf athle- tics. They are ; first, n1aterial to work on ; second, college spirit enthusiastic and cle- tenninecl; third, good coaching. In contenl- plating the chances for track we n1ust con- sider these three elen1ents. As regards the first one, n1aterial, there is only one thing to be said-we have it. The whole of last year's tean1 with the exception of one tnan is still in college and the class of 1908 con- tains rnore than its share of n1en of ahilitv ol in this direction. Now it takes detern1ined and enthusiastic n1eet to count for sotnething. to surpass if possible the success of last year's meet. The progra111 will consist of the regular track events and everyone will he given a chance to show what he can do. It takes the united efforts of n1any men to n1ake good college s,pirit and that this elen1ent shall he nsecl to the best advantage depends upon the col- lege collectively and inclivic1nally. The third elen1ent, that of good coaching will not he lacking at Union this year. Dr. 'rowne has resigned as coach of the baseball tea111 in favor of lVIr. Cunninghan1 and is to nse his efforts fron1 now on in coaching the track tean1 only. Of course this n1eans a lot for track athletics. In for1ner years we have gone without the services of a pern1an- ent coach, a coach being hired only for a few weeks in the spring. Ae regards Dr. Towne's ability no one can fail to recognize it. He has already proved his vvorth in a practical n1anner. in the training of a yic- torious relay team. But what is tnore, he is with us all the ti1ne. He can watch and help a candidate in his vvork fron1 110\iV on through the entire season. Let e·very one realize this, and take adYantage of the ne·w condition of things. Give Dr. 1'o-vvne and (_ the tean1 your support and slo\vly and to- gether we will develop a tean1 which ·will truly· and successfully represent Old Lrnion 111 the cotning n1eets this spring.

Ripton in the second of his series of talks on the prophets spoke on \Jonah the Missionary Prophet.\ Dr. Ripton said in part: \The book has too many people become a mere stroy, a fish st<.ll·y if such a term could be applied to a book of the Bible, and when \Ve think of it we think only of the remarkable part. People argue that it nHtst be taken literally and discuss the size of a whale's throat, the action of the pieces of it's stornach, etc., forgetting the lesson of Christ's rebulc~ f-_C<l His disciples for taking things literaily, as they appear on the surface . We must beware of the man \Vho insists on che non-essential things. We must also beware o7 the man .,who stands by and criticises. The ~pil'i·t of criticism does not wear in the world. Biblicc.11 criticism is important to our understanding of l:ll<J Bible, but unless \Ve make a business of it, it 'i::-1 better to spend our time building more po;.;;iti,,e things into our lives, incultivating the power of construction, not of destruction. The saints of the middle ages ·were splendid and wonderful men toward \Yhmn our hearts warm as we l'eafl their lives, yet they believed with all thei:r herut::; things we could not possibly accept as true. T'o quote from Prof. Adolph Harnack: \The Gos1\el in its simplicity means to believe that God, the powerful ruler of the universe is also our Fath(~r. It means that we get hold of this thought ana ex.- perience its meaning, and hold fast to it as re- vealed in the person of .Jesus Christ, who i·s spoken of by St. Jol\ln in the fourth Gospel a~ the Way, the Truth, and the Life. And yet, ur·on this foundation, what variety of individual onln- ions may be reared and elaborated,! On L1-ds basis, one soul may hold as indispensible wl•at does not even exist for another.

The orthodox man has this adva.rl- tage over the man of h:eterodox beliefs. lie ha.:~: som~thing taught on ·which to go ahead and worl< while the heterodox believer is likely to fiE his life with zeros and minus signs. The book of Jonah is an allegory which el•·'l.br-R some of the most beautiful thoughts of th...:l Bible.. Jonah's mission was to carry the message of the Lord to the people of ::\Tineveh telling therr:. their city was to be destroyed.. When he at h::n,.~t1I reached them and delivered it, 1 hf' people re- pented and Jonah \vas angry becau.se God haJ compassion upon them. The last verse of the book is extremely beautiful. 'And shou~cl I not spare Nineveh, that great city wllt~t f)j:n an:~ In(Jre than sixscore thousand persons that cannot dis- cern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?' The story is a les- son of forgivness which goes far ahead of many of the books of the Old Testament in anticipating the spirit of the \N\ ew.\ The Tuesday evening service was led by Hitt. '0 6. The subject was, \What is Practical Chris- tianity?'' Prof. Ellery will have charge of the Vesper ser- vice Sunday afternoon. His subject will be \The Healing of the Leper,\ a reading from Ben Hur. The attendance at the Sunday metings, this term, has been up to the usual standard; but this is not enough, for the addresses have been unusually strong and inspiring. They are given by men who were once college students them- selves, and they thus know how a college man thinks and how to present the Gospel message to him in a forcible manner.

Shakespeare takes us to the heart of his charac- ters but Moliere shows his from the outside.

FRENCH DRAMA Prof. Marcb Lectures Before the Shakespeare Club Last Monday evening, before the members of the Shakespeare Club, Prof. March delivered a lecture on the French Drama.

He said in part: The comparison between the greatest charac- ter in English comedy and teh greatest character in the French is an interesting one.

Should College Students Study? There is an interesting article in the North American Review for February, by Charles F. Thwing, LL. D., president of Western Reserve University and Adelbert College. The subject of it is: \Should College Students Study?\ He says, taking Harvard as an exa1nple, that the average student gives 26 hours a week to study, 12 of which are spent in the class room,. leaving only 14 hours of actual study. Now the college should be a place of high aims, high opportun- ities and high spirits, it is a place for work as well as for freedom, association and good fellow- ship. Yet the number of men in. this our greatest college, who do work as they ought, is discredi- tably small. Is the college not founded to save men from themselves? If men be indolent, is it not to show them the joy of labor, to reveal to them the opportunities of work, and to impress upon them the obligation of hard service. Most men of fifty would say that their college had not dealt fairly with them, if, receiving them at the age of 20 as her students, she had failed to oblige them to read the best books about the best things and to give hard thinking about hard subjects. Out of great struggles great men are born. Tolerance, courage, paUence, power of observation, judgment, honor, noble purpose, are among the qualities which are both cause and re- sult o-f hard and constant labor. Such are the elements which constitute a great nation. The college is a trustee for the nation and should train its men to work and work hard. Thus, therefore, not a little may be urged in favor of permitting coHege men to work three or four hours a day. But more, very much n~ore, may be said for their working at least 6 or 8 hours a day. Going to college and working little is good; going to college and working 1nuch is better, very good. One needs simply to consult and follow the laws of value. First thtngs are to be made first, and secondary things are to be made sec- ond. The colLege student should, indeed, he other than a student. But he should, at least, be a student, and a hard. one, too. Lecture and Reception Dr. Wm. H. Tolman, direct0r of the American Institute for social service in N. Y., gave an il- lustrated lecture on ''The Homes and Workshops of the People\ last evening in the chapel. The lecture was well attended by the students and faculty and various other people who are inter- ested in the labors of the institute. Dr. Tolman gave a good description of the life of the work- ingman, both at home and in the workshop. This lecture was appreciated by all who attended a1. d all were loud in their praises of Dr. Tolman. Following the lecture a social was given by the Y. M. C. A. in Silliman Hall, to which the stu- dents and faculty had been invited. The affair was well attended and the speeches, which were was well attended.
