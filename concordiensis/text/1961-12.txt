Ellswm~th Tt:al\y Paul Tut~nerp James \-Vilson A More Perfect Union In the past few weeks, there has been a great deal of debate concerning the attitude of the student body in their approach to education. The anti-intellectual atmosphere which pervades Union's campus has been attributed ,to a strong fraternity influence or a lack of a student union, which wou1<;l make fraternities almost unnecessary. One of the most important influences on this trend heretofore has been neglected. We firmly believe that a lack of stimu1a- tion in the classroom towards an intellectual direction does much to encourage or discourage a student's interest. It is now two years since the Extendible Program was dropped. Within this time no satisfactory substitute has been passed by the faculty to afford an opportunity to a student with a sharp curiosity in a few subjects and an above average ability to pursue that curiosity independ- ently under an organized program. The Faculty Council has considered several proposals, but none have as yet been approved. The institution of an Honors Program, comparable to that at Amherst or Swarthmore but tailored to Union's specific needs, is neces- sary if the College is to combat anti-intellectualism among the students_ Such a program is currently being drawn up by the Faculty Task Force on an Honors Program but funds as yet have not been forthcoming from the Trustees to put it into effect. Unless such a program is passed by the Faculty and financed by the Trustees in the very n.ear future, we can forsee an increase in and firmer establish- ment of the anti-intellectual. The program currently being considered by the com- mittee would involve a different program for each of the four divisions. The form designed for Divisions I and II is to involve many very small seminar groups which would meet infrequently and discuss topics investigated in depth by the students. In all likelihood, in order to receive a degree with Honors, a thesis would be required by the division in which the student majors. In Division ill, it has been suggested that the program involve research projects to be conducted experimentally by the student with a min- imum o£ faculty direction. To date, Division IV has not found a system suitable to its course requirements. In addi- tion, the committee has not yet decided whether to allow a student to elect Honors in more than one division. In our eyes, this program seems to be little more than an expansion of the current 56 courses being offered in Divisions I, II and ITI. Although the expansion is a wel- come one, we question whether it will go far enough in the direction of independent studies. At Swarthmore, students who elect Honors follow a program during their last two years revolving around the program. During this time they take eight courses, two each semester, and work in these fields on their own, reporting back to a seminar group once a week in each course. We feel that a program ex- tending in this direction would be desireable for Union. The Editors invite the student body to comment on their conception of an Honors Program in next week's Letters to The Editor column. Last Clear Chance The Student Council has not yet considered allocating Student Tax: Funds to the Lectures and Concerts Com- mittee to supplement next semester's lecture series. As the year continues, it will become increasingly more diffi- cult to contract a high quality lecturer if the appropriation is passed. We strongly urge that this topic be introduced, debated andpassed at the next Council meeting. It should not be put off any later or the effect the money might have produced will be lost. Le.tters to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis:: Your editorial of November 17 states that \the best things in life are free.\ But we feel that things whirh are free are soon tal<en for granted. In the article you implied that free love means free sex. You are confusing your terminology !'ince sex and love are two .separ- ate Pntities. You stated that \.the only \'i·ay to ·beat the Russians is by offering bigger and better equalities, and bigger and better freedoms,\ but how much freedom do we see in the countries today striving to level the economic classes. Equa!l- ity does not necessarily mean freedom. People who struggle for eco- nomic equality are those who have no- means themselves. Ergo, we assume that those who advo- cate equal sexual opportunity, likewise .... How right Freud was in saying \playing with on·es hands\ is a manifestation of unfuifilled sex- ual desires. No finer example ex- ists than this editorial: where there has obviously been aimless playing with pens!! After your ca1'eful analysis of neurosis in industrial towns per- haps your prognosis would be to have your neighborhood brothels equalized and controlled by the Welfare State. We hope that the \horny• corny\ editorial boa·rd will chew thei1· oral contraceptives well so that they may enjoy their \orgy- porgy'' to the fullest. Sincerely, Wendy Davis Roberta Rubin, Wheaton College P .S. : We dare you to print this! ~: * * To tile Editor of Coucordiensis: For the third time since I have been at Union, I have once again seen the issue of a \reading per- iod\ I'ea1' its ugly head. My pati- ence has exhausted itself, and I feel that I must remain silent no longer. Speaking as one who has at last thrown off his yoke of apathy, I· propose that the \read- ing period\ be forgotten for the following reasons: 1) This so-called week to pre- pare for finals would not be used for study by a great number of students. It would furnish a last chance for many to get in a last fling, 2) Those students who use the week to study would not find themselves ahead of the game. The more time that a. student has to study, the more his instructors will expect of him. Fallout Shelters: 3) M~ny professm;s will take advantage of this week to assign additional readings. 4) By ~xtending the college year we will remove the edge that a Union student has over other coHege students in se(!king sum- mer emplo:~rtnent. He wiH no longer be \the early bird.\ Having renll.'~·ed my .tacit con- sent to the establishment of a \reading period;'' I urge the rest of the student body to ·do the same. 'William Scutt ~63 To the Editor of Coneordiensis: The recent editorial. concerning the question ·9f Free Love is. an excellent illustration of faulty in- terpretafion and faulty reasoning. The psychological evidence that is used to support Free Love is based on the theories of Freud. You have accurately stated some of the princi.ples of Freud. Our basic psychic energy is directed towards sex, unfulfilled sex. How- ever, the conclusion is yours not Freud's- Freud's feeling-s con- cerning F'ree Love are the com- plete opposite of yours- The fol- lowing quotation from Freud's a1·ticle, Contributions To The Psy- chology @f Love (1912) will show Freud's feelings towards Free Love. This very incapicity in the sexual instinct to yield full satisfaction as soon as it sub- mits to the first demands of culture becomes the source, however, of the grandest cul- tural achievements, which are brought to birth by ever greater sublimation of the components of the sexual in- stinct_ For what motive would induce man to put his sexual energy to other uses if by any disposal of; it he could obtain fully satisfying pleas- ure ? He would never Iet go of this pleasure and would make no further progress. This quotation shows that Freud did not support the doc- trine of Free Love and also raises the question of beating the Rus- sians. It is obvious that we will only beat the Russian!3 through pl'ugre~::;. Therefore, Free Love will not aid in this endeavor.

Presented The prog:uam at Memorial Chapel was devoted to three works: Schubert's Quartet No. 13 in A Minor, Anton Webern's Five Movements for String Quartets Op. 5 a11d Beethoven's Quartet No. 15 in A Minor, Op. 132. The scope of this music covers ap- proximately a century, jumping from the Beethoven and Schubert of 1824-25 to the Webern pieces of 1909. Although none of this music is really new, it was a wel- come adventure to hear the Beethoven al!d the W ebern on the same program. Neither of these works lend· themselves to quick comprehension .. Apart from sev- erely contrasted idiom and style, these works shat•e much ih com- mon and are not .as far apart as one might suppose. The compos- ers themselves share common qualities: Beethoven and Webern both drew inspiration from na- tute, both have basically Ger- manic origins, and both worked in Vienna. The two works in- cluded ih the program are :both intimate, abstract and introspec- tive. They serve to display the search for .a perfect expression of two· composers at different times in histol'Y- It is significant that the works of both composers have served. as milestones; Webern is Webern!s Five Movements were mission rulin1 treat~d as delicately as they de- tion in interst serve, resulting in a jewel-like '1 1: ~he .prosec1 perfection.

Patton, who got his experience wrestling steers on his father's ranch in Montana, is expected to start for the varsity in the 157-pound di- vision. Vrooman will take over the 123-pound class, and Broderick will wrestle at 130 pounds. An- other football player, l'esen·e cen- ter John Syzmanski of Schenec- tad~·, is expected to wrestle in the heavyweight class. He is a 200-pound sophomore who grad- uated from Mont Pleasant High School.

Business Manager ............ :'lews Editor .. -Sparta Editor EX 3-923: DA \\!~ Tllt:HSTU:\ '63 Choose Up Sides Since the announcement two weeks ago that the Facu1ty Council has established a reading period of one week for next semester, there has been a strong move- ment of student dissent. In petitions circulated and mo- tions passed at the Student Council meeting, students have voiced their discontent at being f0rced to remain on campus an extra week They have cited summer employment op- portunities and a week to be wasted in trips rather than concerted study as sufficient reason to abandon the read- ing week. In suggesting a reading period last February in this column, we stated that a reading or review period would give the student, firJshing his classes one or two days before final exams under the current scheme, an oppor- tunity to correlate a semester's work in his courses, mak- ing each of them a meaningful whole. Extra assignments, necessary in a week long period, we felt would be a firm step toward a more independent, mature education. In the current conflict, we are unable to see anyone considering the educational advantages of a reading period, everyone's arguments seem clouded by selfish motives.

This article but for superior citizenship in all represents a portion of that ad- its broad reaches. We still firmly believe in the value of either a read- ing or a review period. If such a period is to remain, the academic calendar for 1962-1963 must be revised. Since one of the main objections is that the present calendar extends too far into June. The necessary increase in time to accommodate a reading period should be tacked on to the beginning rather than the end of the year, thus allow- ing the students ample opportunity to apply for summer jobs on an equal footing with students from other schools.

SCHAEFER DRE\'IERIES, IIEVf VORK ANO ALB.ANY, II. Y, ClEVElAND, OHIO 3 Red ·students Art Exhibit: Active} I The latest .edition of World Stu- 1 dents News, the international! newspaper of the Soviet Com- munist student organization (the International Union of Students:) has launched another propaganda campaign against the Western bloc. It signals the beginning of an attempt by the Soviet Union to gain world student support for its Berlin policies. The aim of the new student drive is to con- vince the students of the world that West Germany and NATO pose a grave threat to peace, and that only a peace treaty on Ger- ma·ny modeled on the Soviet pro- posals will prevent a third world war, Lithography Reigns Pictured above is one of the many prints now on display at the art exhibit in Old Chapel. ----------------- The method used by the World Student News follows the' classic propaganda technique: irrelevent comments, quotes taken out of context, staged pictures, and the use of letters and petitions to cre- ate the impression that basic agreement with the Soviet posi- tion already exists amo11g stu- dents.

The second half provided an indication of what was to happen the following evening, as the vis- itors simply ran away from the Garnet. Jim Sweet and Mike Bergher pl'Ovided the big scoring punch, while the rest of the points were distributed rather evenly among the rest of the players. * * * * With Ben Beckton doing some amazing first half shooting, and Dave Strassburg picking up in the second half, the Vermont Un- iversity cagers ran over, around, through and away from a game, but undermanned Union five to score a 62-46 win here Wed, nesday night at Memorial Field House. Beckton, a 6'2\ junior hit five from the floor during the fiTst twenty minutes, and added three .for three from the foul line to help lead Vermont off the floor at the half with a 30-25 lead. The Dutchmen fared a go')d deal 'better in the season's openet· at Middlebury, when they scored a 70-60 win. Again John Pelton and Dave Santos were instru- mental this time in a winning cause; Pelton sunk 11 points in the first half, while Santos came back with 19 in the last twenty minutes, sinking 23 in all to help spearhead the win. Early Scoring Slow The game started with little scoring. John Pelton scored two baskets to give the Garnet a 4·0 lead, but it was not until 2:13 of the half that Beckton gave the Green Mountain Men their first Soph center Toby Lustig made the evening one to remember by points of the evening with a Box Scores: long jumper from the right side.

This faH .the Susquehanna Cru- saders finished with an 8-0-1 rec- '>rd and were ranked eighth in the · Lambert Cup standings. Under coach James W. Garrett a former assistant at Coast Guard, Susquehanna has posted a 15-1-1 record in the past two seasons, Union's 1962 schedule: Sept. 29, at St. Lawrence; Oct. 6, Alfred; Oct. 13, at Rochester; Oct. 20, R.P.I.; Oct. 27, at Ho- bart; Nov. 3, Williams; Nov. 10, .~usquehanna; Nov. 17, at Ham- Ilton. 5 Mermen vs. Williams By Lloyd ~ut·ick The second annual battle of the Olympians will occur this Satur- day at Williams College between the swimming teams of Robert Muir, WiHiams mentor and Olym- pic swimming eoach, and Tony rurner, 1952 Olympic diver. There is no doubt as •to the outcome of the meet, but Turner's Torpedoes will have improved te such an ex- tent as to worry the Ephmen's mentor about the future. In a twenty-four year history of swimming meets between the two teams, Union has lost twen- ty-three and tied one. Turner has indicated that within three or four years, if the same calibre of swimmer keeps coming out for the Union team, there is every chance of beating Williams. Outlook Optimistic Expected to show up weH are Kat Schneider, Will Grant and the divers, Dave Warmflash, Eric Teicholz, and E r i c An g e 11.

(We hope) We of the Concordiensis would like to extend our best wishes to the college community for an enjoyable holiday season. In absorbing Christmas .cheer, we find it necessary to caution those who· will be driving during the coming recess. One year ago this week, Bill McNutt died as a result of a driver's negligence. When traveling in the next few weeks, do not drive when fatigued or after having rung in the new year with anything but coffee. Drive cautiously and anticipate any danger which might come from other drivers. The Union Inferno At last week's meeting of the Interfraternity Council, Peter Rappaport reported on his recent participation in the National lnterfraternity Conference which was held in Boston two weeks ago. During the course of his report, Rappaport made several suggestions to the IFC towards improving the fraternity system at Union. Unfortunately, his ideas, which we belive merit serious 'consideration, seemed to fall on deaf ears. His most importannt proposal, we feel, was that Hell Week be abolished immediately. In our opinion, Hell Week or Greek Week, as it has. the Cuban goverrunent. It was de b.a. ted, tern p ora r ily shelved and l'e- d e bated for some time. A ., Colombian pn- ., p.o sal, less ··;:strong in its received considera- tion. , it asked Premier Castro to renounce his ties to in- ternational communi~m and to cease exporting revolution to ethel' atin American countdes. This failing, discusion of sanc- ti<>ns would be in order. The OAS approved last week a motion to call a foreign ministers meeting in mid-January 1~62. Cuba and Mexico voted negative- ly. Mexico has taken the position that only emergency situations are cause for convoking such a conference and will not admit this to be the case of Cuba. What the OAS will probably attempt to accomplish is the re-d~fining of the term \subversion so as to include it under the scope of the ll}47 R.io Mutual Defense Pact, signed by all Lating American nations. Sever Relations Thus far, many nations have severed diplomatic ties with Cuba, Colombia being the latest. This might normally' be considered first steps leading to economic sanctions and the like. However, the larger nations of Latin Amer- ica (Argentina, Braz;il, Chile) are kn-own to the opposed to such measures. It leaves up in the air the problem of what to do with Cuba. One should not attempt to an- alyze the reasons agaJnst sa.nc- tiQns. It is known that Latin American .nations strongly oppose any involvement in the affaiJ·s of sister countries. It is a p()int that tl1e United States considers heavily in its foreign relations with Latin America. The situation has been grow- ing more acute for some time. Castro's recent declaration con- Ever since the Cuban revoiu- tion, Latin American countries have beel). soft-pedaling the issue of a communist Cuba. Inaction on their part. has led to more ac- tion on the part of Cuba. It well may be too late for action oil. the Cuban problem. Sanctions Create Dangel' The imposition of economic sanctions, of attempting to iso- late the Castro regime, could be disastrous. This would afford Cas- tro a calling card, and permit him to scream perscecution. It would permit him to muster consider- able public opinion in his favor. Moreover, each Latin American nation could expect reprisals on its own territory. Each would have to face rioting and disorder. But the greatest threat to con- certed action against Cuba is the thought of Russian intervention. Russian and Cuban economics would become more closely tied. Rusl;lia too, could conceivably come to the aid of her bullied fl'iend with military assistance. In shm't, sanctions against Cuba might be more trouble than they are worth. Planned Policy Desired And yet, if no action is taken, and American nations keep spar- ing the rod, Cuba might become more and more spoiled. Thus is a seeming paradox, too little or too much response mean trouble. What is there left to do? This observer cannot say. But, he must ask for sincere deliberation, and 'plead for a policy that .is not half-vast and not ill-prepared; the Cuban invasion fiasco fortells the inadequacy of such policy. Too, American countries must also avoid the disgusting spec- tacle of out-and-out division and argument between themselves. Certainly they are in a bind, there is no doubt about that. But weak-kneed policy will destroy common agreement in the future and perhaps the OAS itself. There is no doubt about that either. euphemistically been renamed, ought to be nothing more...--------------------------, than a remembrance of a fraternity system peculiar to the Activities Questionnaire: era of bath-tub-gin instead of a vestige as it is now called. As a vestige, Hell Week does not go unnoticed. Rather than being a constructive part of society, it is a seven day holiday for every sadist biding in fraternity house closets. Not limited, however, to a few, even those normally hu- mane seem to .be swept along by this uncontrollable, ani- malistic drive consuming their fellow fraternity brothers. It is a week characterized by the most dangerous, most degrading and most obscene games that the creative minds of Union students can produce. Student Union. By A.llen K.

Hell Week means a period of little or no sleep for the pledges which serves only to start them off academically a week behind. Although they supposedly are being in- doctrinated in the ways and practices of their fraternity, we wonder if this is the normal behavior of a civilized society.

The Executive Committee felt, however, that ar- rangements as to the timing of the examination period and the reading-review period during the two weeks preceding Commencement was entirely within the jurisdiction of the College Faculty and that the Faculty through its Faculty Council has complee authority to arrange these periodS as · they see fit. If, as tl:ie WRUC survey reports, 85~£. of the Faculty replying to the questionnaire indicated they were opposed to the week, they have recourse through their divisional meetings and the Faculty Council to change the arrangement in any way they~ desire. The vote in the Fac- ulty Council was not as the survey reported by a majority one, but was 12 to 5, which is better than two-thirds. Divisional meetings wil he held early in January 1962, and the Faculty Council will meet again on Tuesday, January 16, so that any Faculty members who wish to have this matter reconsidered may put it up for action at their divi- sional meetings and at the Faculty Council at the proper time. that the best policy would be to back the uN, as we have been do- ing. In the long run, the situation in Katanga cannot remain as it is. If the UN does not aid the Congolese in retaining Katanga, the only choice left for them will be to tum to the Soviets. This in fact was the course followed by Carter Davidson Of course, the subjugation of Katanga would not solve all of the Congo's problems. However, it may provide for a unified, if not highly centralized, govern- ment and will make it posible for some progress to be made. Key Opens ·Lock ex-premier Lumumba.
