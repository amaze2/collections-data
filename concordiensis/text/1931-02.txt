Also, improvement in produc- tion methods usually results in the laying-off of workers, and, in fa<lt, more than two million men ·have •been thrown out of work because of this factor alone during the past ten years. \The business· cycle presents a serious problem, and its causes are very mysterious•.

Man Should Have Goal \A pilgrimage is a journey toward a goal that contains some spi·ritual content. The youth of today doesn't know where it is going. That the choice of a goal matters little is evidenced: by the phrase: 'Let's go places'. Jesus :possess·ed the pilgrim spirit when he declared 'Follow me'. Only a man that knows where .he is ·going can say these words. .All his life Jesus was consumed ·by the conception of a g·oal. in the estab- lishment o·f the Kingdom of God on Earth. \What about the college man. as· a pilgrim? Do our goals possess anything of a .spiritual character? We very often accept mere mobility as a means in itself, but life must contain something in the way of a purpos.ive goal. .A!ccording to Pro- fes•sor Pupin, it is only when atomic energy becomes purposive that we have cosmos· out of chaos. \Such a purJ)osive goal is finally realized on the pilgrimage toward belie·f in God. A man does we'll to use the pilgrimruge method as a guide to right living. Like the Master we can apprais·e to our- selves a spiritual goal of a gripping character.\ ----·0---- The talk will be illustrated with lantern slides showing the various steps in the accomplishment of the Westchester County Development. These views will show the various parks, ,parmways and recreational features in operation including the reclamation of various small streams in the county whe.r.e ob- jectionable developments had de- .stroy. e.d natural conc;litions; the S d B d D' transformation of garbage dumps · . tu · ent 0 . y lSCUSSeS and sw:amps into landscaped parks Aboli'.shi'n·g Frosh Rules and parkways and the abolition of bill boards and other factors detri- mental to the highest type of resi- . dep.tial communities. · -------•O------- Carroll Selects Cast For Two Spring Productions The Terrace Council proposed to the sophomores and upperclassmen at the Student Body meeting- yes- terday morning that four of the freshmen rules he abolished.

In the paper mills of Ontario and the water power de- velopments of Niagara Falls, engineers swear by them. Camels carry them into the depths of the Abyssinian Desert and dog sledges into the wilds of Canada. The quality of Crane piping materials has won them a world-wide demand. The globe-girdling Crane distributing organi- zation has placed them within easy reach of power and industrial builders every- where. Naturally, this distributing organization is most complete and efficien:t in. the United States. In this country are facto- ries in five cities manufacturing industrial piping materials;branches and sales offices in I 6o cities; warehouses in close prox- imity to every important industrial center. All these facilities are keyed to receive orders for quickly needed materials and have them on the spot with no loss of time. No matter where you take up your career after you leave school, you will find need for piping materials from the complete Crane line? and a Crane office nearby to make it easy for you to get them.
