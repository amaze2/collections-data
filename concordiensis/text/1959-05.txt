4 Ho · w To Landscape . Your Campus . By Jacques Ramee Friday. May 1 • . 1959 There have been landscape a r chitet'ts helpi·ng people with the de\'elopment of their gronnrls for man:'-' centur- ies. In the eighteenth centnry such an architect came . l:lpon the Pnion scene from France. But the problem was • not as acute then as it is todav. For never have trustees wanted to pack so much function into so little space. For these days, the average trustee wants as much performance from his 1 00-foot round library as a five- .. acre library used to take for granted. And the 300 thou- sand volume library wants to be markedly different from . Before one beo . ins one must be sure that no extran- the oth~rs in the smal.l .c?llege price range, but a~so corn- · eous and va:lueless\'materials are present. During the ex- ~lete w1th all the fac1hbes of the 42nd Street JOb ... cavations fer the · Union College buildings, oil, uranium hons and all. and manganise were encountered .

6 You And Shown for the first time j in Campus Beautiful is Davy, the campus dog. Davy has been on campus for so long that he is truly a mem- ber of the college family. Davy has recently made campus wide news by his ar- bitrary actions towards some of the most influential can- ines. Fm·tunately, two other animals bravely and com- mendably checked Davy's ef- forts to steal their bones. But Davy isn't bad ... He has atoned for his mistakes and is now back in the good graces of the campus. Many young married col- lege couples today find that keeping pets is a costly prop- · osition. One solution ad- vanced by pet owners at Un- ion College is to put them to financial use - a sort of \have your pet and eat it too.\ A large group of students on campus who are interest- ed in petting have come up with the solution shown at the righL During the day , the sheep are gTazed in the 1 1 pastures, in accordance with an old college law which has · recently been modified. At night, they are sheared to provide wool. At the end of the season, they are do- nated to the newly formed \Joseph Fleshyman Charita- ble Fund.\ M.r. Fleshyman has not as yet made known the use to which the animals will be put. ; Friday, . May 1, 1 : 959 Your Pets Going away from home this summer? Board your horse at a m0dern sta · ble-and know he'H be well taken care of. Today's stable operators are in business to seTve you and your animal. Since stables are neavily patronized during the peak summer n:ronths, you ' ll want to make . reservations weH in advance. But most rer;;pohsih'le stable 1 O\\·ners advise you to brand your hosg-this not only .pro- tects your belove~! pet, but gives h1m a teeling 01 utmlly identification-a sort of \Togethemess.\ Typical . of these boarding .stables is on~ at Pnion ('ol- lege in Schenectady, New York which. is e'Ccelled by few. Modern plant, the latest facilities, aH add up to better service to the hoss and his parents. And he'll be in the best ef company. The operators : of the Union College Stable have ad- . vanced these tips to homeowners who plan to board their hosses over the summer: Gradually prepare the animal for the experience-especially if he has never been away from home before. Don't forget to brand him properly, and be sure to include a few postal cards in his toilet-the attend- ant will be glad to mail them to you during your vacation, telling you of your pet's condition. And that's not horse. And, adds Stahle Owne1· Teddy :\lcllvellie, be sure to have him shod, so he doesn't tear up the lawn ... When you arrive home and go to pick up your pet, watch it ' !

Dur- ing the long spring and summer months, cautions Stable Attendant Bill Whinnie, hosses have a tendency to . grow horns. Result of this phenomenon, adds ' Whinney, is ~vide._ spread and serious frustration. The p1·ocess of de-horTJing one's hoss can be as rewarding as it is inexpensive, says Whinney ..... .

The original intention of the library was as a foundation for a statue of Eliphalet Nott, Union's most notorious president. Profe,;sc->r E-lmer Vehb canclidh· commented \For that it was big enough.\ · ' The ere~tion of the Nott structun was begun \Vhen the foundatiOn for the li'brary, affectionately known as Miss Minerva, was laid in 1858. This undertaking cost the Trustees two hundred thousand dollars. Contrary to popu- lar b~Hef the library was not designed after the Baptistry of Ptsa, but was adapted from a bust of Minerva previ ously possessed by Dr. Nott. ' The point of greatest interest about Nott Library is its smooth, globular pinnacle. The greatest curiosity about this unusual superstructure is not its unusual shape, but the fact that it is girded by a Hehrew inscription. Taken from the Eook of the Fathers the inscription reads-\The day is done and the labor is completed, and the laborers lascivious ; but the recompense is ample, and the mistress of the house is urgent.\ The Nott building, a small library, in a small Eastern college, which at one time was one of the top American Every inch of space is taken up with old books, copies . of colleges, is the most efficiently used building on campus.

Tt Sicilian government has attacked the find. claims, is to get a few students in between the legs of Grecian godesses. Plans are now at hand to clear out a of the old engineers and make room for some studer: Originally students wer.e admitted to the library at a time, but under the college's new expansion prog Union is attempting to set the all-time college record cramming the greatest number of students into a s~ enclosure as is possible. Vebb explained that the libJ is now floating on quicksand and the added weight sh• be sufficient to end a landmar1{ in Union's history. \~ all we have to do is find some individual,·\ explaine Trustee, \looking for some way to make a tax deduct and then we can start all over again.\ While Spring cleani his 1 i b r a I' y recent rnion Lihntl'ian Eln Yebb came upon t scene: A ft·og specim which had been pres~ between t>ages of a be since the Fall of 19 completely dismembeJ and fastened to the p~ 107 of Lady Chatterl Lover.-Dead.

· a Fester A. Arthur; A lu1nnus Be:autiful At the recent meeting of the Un : ion Alumni Associa- tion foi' the Attempted Betterment :of the Nation's Most Unbalanced College (UAAABNMUC}, President Carter Belovedson, uberofficial of the Institution, spoke to the assembled \touches\ on The Aesthe-tic : Value of a Lush Campus and the Benefits for Building Better Men. As a case in point, Belovedson discl!lssed the case his- tory of a: typical Union man before the era of Union's decline - Fester A Arthur. 'The story amply proved Carter's assertion that \Jackson's Gardens are utilized on Spring Prom Weekend.\ Fester had a log cabin childhood, dulcet and syrUJ)py. According to Fester, getting into Union was no problem for him. \My father knew Bill Petz.\ When Fes made his appearance on campus, wearing . . his coonskin cap, he made a wild sensation. A fellow Fester A. Arthur is shown meditating upon the steps of the campus' beautiful student theatre. Friday, May l, 1959 BEFOR · E AND AFTER.: Union's beautiful alumnus, Fester A. At·thur is depicted (above) as an under· graduate and (below) a seasoned gTaduate prepared by education and demonstrating that he is well orien· tated into the academic a11d social life of a profes;sor.

Fes was introduced to campus .traditions when he became a member of the De·ke Lodge for Sixteen Year Old Housen1others. It was at this time that Fes was in- boduced to the joys of chnapps - a Gennan sacra- menta~ beverage. Fes became Union's beiggest .proselyte, ad'opting Phil Liquorbardt as his pe1·sonal mecca. The i.mpression left by his hot little nose on the window t<>ane is being maintained by the college in his hallowed memory. After college, Fes's career was uneventful. His sHe- cession to the office pl'eviotisly held by James Garfinke, by default, was the only blot on his inebrious career. After his term - of office, Fes, disgusted with the complacency of Washington plutocrats, returned to for- wat:d-Jooking Union College anti hi:> favol'ite haunt- LiqLtorbardt's. After 1-1 years of teaching at his almP mater, Fes su<:cumbecl one night to a se\·ere case of mono, · aftet· a Frosh initiation party at the old Del<e house. The college ei'ected a statue in Fes's honor, depicting him in all his glory. Beneath the statue was inscrib-ed the Spring Weekend Proliferation motto~\For Human- ity's Sake.\ Don't Let It Happel To You Because. • •

The location of the library will present two important problems which will have to be faced by the college soon after the building is completed. Both the steam plant and Washburn Hall will have to be removed if the library is to be the center of the campus. These steps have already been recognized by the cGl!ege. The removal of the steam plant will eliminate a tre- mendous eyesore from the campus. The removal of Wash- bum Hall, however, will be far more significant as it will cause the college to find a new location for student activ- ities.

May We Amend There is presently before the student body an amend- ment to the Constitution of the Student Body that has l>een accepted by the Student Council and will be voted on by the student body at this Tuesday's noon chap!\! as- sembly, J..lay 12. According to the Student Body Constitu- tion, before a proposed amendment becomes law, it must be voted on twice, first by the Student Council, and then by the student uody. Having already been voted the neces- sary two-thirds majority in the Council, the amendment under consideration must now receive a simple majority affirmation at a meeting of a quorum of the student body. It is with this pt·ocess, rather than with the amendment itself that the Concordiensis takes exception. We specifically base our objections on these points. 1. Despite the fact that the proposed amendment was published in its entir~ty in the Concordiensis of April 24, because no further publicity of the amendment was at- tempted, a large number of students are not sufficiently aware of its provisions to vote intelligently. 2. Although a quorum of the student body is called for by the Student Body Constitution, we would hazm·d that no count will be taken in Memorial Chapel this Tues- day and no effort will be made to make certain that this provision will be enforced. (Furthennore, copies of the Constitution are virtually unavailable to bhe campus. Ex- ception: an out of date, unrevised copy kept under lock and key in the library's Union Collection.)

Alj::.o Antonia Kitsman sung the solo part and Robert Campbell's ex:cellent Glee Club performed the male voice chOir role in the Brahms Alto R1u~,psody. Miss Kitsman's well trained rich voice was excellent for the lush ·dra- matic alto solo in the wor.k. Cur- tis' skilled conducting success- fully combined the large male chorus with the orchestra a11d soloist to pr.oduce a well-balanced SOllhd; 3. It would seem that the procedure currently followed in amending the Student Body Constitution is designed to comply with the word, but not the spirit oJ that document. Those students concerned with the mechanics of the pas- sage of the proposal appear more interested in assuring the passage of their amendment than in seeing that thei.r true responsibility to the student body is carried out. This responsibility is in doing their utmost to insure that a well informed quorum of the student body will vote in- telligently on the amendment this Tuesday. The current amendment procedure has attained the unfortunate status of a farce. A better amendment pro- cedure would be one based on a campus wide referrendum vote of the student body. Not only would such a system eliminate the faults of the present one, but it would intro- duce no new problems of procedure. Because of their long and successful experience in conducting elections, and their efficient organization based pn voting at fraternity meet- ings and in dormitories, the Student Council Elections Committee would be the obvious choice to oversee such an election. With the performance of the opening Cowell Hymn a.ild Fugu- ing Tune for Orchestra, (1953), Curtis' excellent control of the group was apparent. The work itself, ·lyrical but not particularly exciting, was conventional -in harmony and melodic line. The orchestra rendered it carefully, however, keeping .the range of dynamics well-within the fairly limited scope of the music, The Hovha.nnes Prelude o.f The Hovhannes Prelude and Quadruple Fugue was again care- fully and concisely performed. One could have hoped for a more effective handling of the opening of the fugue, however. The voice entrances a.I;ld interactions did not call attention to the skill- ed contrapuntal writing. The dramatic crescendo, leading to a well-disciplined :finals •left the La Mer Performed The popular Debussy La. Mer was the major 'worlt in the sec- ond half of the program. Dis~ playing a fine range of dynamics and· a broad spectrum of imag- inative sounds the orchestra held its own through the entire work. Debussy's Iong, sometimes repeti· tive outpourings, ·however, did not always hold .the attention of the audience. It seemed as if there were too many ''special ef· fects\ and not enough carefully structured sections in the music. An amendment to the Constitution of the Student Body is of such importance and of such rare occurrence that every effort should be made to insure its intelligent consideration by evt;lry member of the student body.

Bi 11 Stewart, has ea;rned a rep- utation as one of the most sought after entertaining and dynamic sports speakers in the country. He had a long sports career until he t\etired at the end of the 1954 season after a 21 yea:!' career as a National League Umpire. According to Ketz hl.s talk will be a. discussion of his career with many stories of his playing days officiating in both baseball and hockey. \Sports writers have agreed that it was a sorry day for the baseball world when Bill Stewart announced his retire- ment, for officials of his calibre are few and far between,\ Ketz said. Umps 715 Straight Games Stewart had worked in 715 straight games from August 1932 until September of 1938 when he was stricken with appendicitis. He served as Umpire in five Wor1d Series and four All-Star Games and ohe City Series in Chicago between the Cubs and White Sox. He also handled six Stan.Iey Cup Series. He was a National League Umpire for 22 yea~s and a Big League Hockey Referee for 11 years. Stewart in- terrupted his 11 year refereeing career long enough to become the first American born coach to win a Stanley Cup and the first coach ever to win a Stanley Cup in his first year of coaching. Recently he was appointed Coach of the U. S.. Hockey Team which toured all the world competing in the World Hockey.Championships. • Applications for the. position of National Student Associa- ti'on Coordinator for the com- ing year are now available at the Student Activities Office.

The tone and con-· notations of the title of this rno-· tion picture are quite deceptive, insofar as the movie depicts a rather melancholy situation, yet very tendPr and moving. The few moments of true happiness are overRhadowed by the predomin- ance of sadness and remorse, qualities inherent in the plot. One SummPr of Happiness man- ages to capture some of the ten- sions and torment of youth, wedged between impulse and soc-· tal standards. However, the rno-· tion picture describes this nat~ ural conflict in all too melan- choly manner. One chapel credit will be glven.'

A chance !i:Ke this .may not come again.\ Cartmill's tenure at Union, ah though brief, has been one of re- markable success. Famous among Eastern small colleges for his overnight development of Union into a basketball powe1·, Cartmill also enjoyed record breaking sea- sons in tennis and soccer. The young coach also spent the past , year in the administrative capa- . ·city of Acting Dean of Studente Union Program The proposed National Student Association Amendment to the Student Body Constitution was accepted by a majority vote at last Tuesday's Chapel following Dr. Seed's ta.llt. Ha.ving previously achieved. the necessary two-thirds vote in the Student Council, the Amendment goes into effect iJn.. · mediately. and kee'PS us strong. This is why more emphasis must be placed· on liberal arts, whtch encourages differences of opinion. Jf this is, done all colleges will, lill:e Union, \play a significant part in main- taining the tradition of western liberal edu0ation.\ Prepared at Michigan A native of England, Dr. Seoo has devoted years of study to the field of American history and 'held the pqst of Lecturer in Amer- ican and Colonial History at St. Andrew's before coming to Un- ion. Part of his graduate p,rep- aration was done at the Univer- sity of Michigan, where he earn·ed an A.M. degree in 1942.

Ketz stated. \We fig- ured that he was a man who would do the kind of jqb St. Law- .rence would· require. Tom has a tremendous amount of ability and this was an opportunity he couldn't forego.\ Replacement Uncertain Union's plans for next year are presently in the uncertain stage. The problem of acquiring a new coach or coaches for three sports has been intensified by the late- ness of the school year. \We are looking for an experi- enced basketball coach, first,\ Ketz pointed out. \We also like it very much if he could take either soccer or tennis. However we are not pushing just to get a replacement. Even if we struggle for a year, we feel very firmly that ··We want a replacement who will fit into the department and the college. If we can't find a replacement, we'll wait a year. Union will be better off in the long run.\ Cartmill's responsibilities at St. Lawrence will not include coach- ing.

Alfred :\lcClung Lee ·of Bro<?klyn Col'le.g~, whi~h c~n­ tered at·ound the problems of racial and rehgt~ous dtscnm- ination in college fra.tet·nities, brought to ltg~t several problems which receive .far too little a-iring on this c~mpu_s. For although students 'have l~ecently become embro1led. m such issues as financial stability under a deferred rushmg system, tarely have they given much thoug~t to the far more important problem of how the frate~mty system at l'nion can bette1· contribute to the maturitY and growth of the men who spend .four years at the college. It was continually repeated at the lecture, that it is of extreme importance that during his college career the student be placed in a position wheTe h~ ~an be exposed to a wide variety of ideas and personaht1es. For unless this is done, the collegec experience becomes one of stag- nation instead of ene of g-rowth. Exploring ''Jac:k's'' Garden In a c:hat we had with Dr. Au- gustus H. Fox:, Chairman of Un- ion's t\[ath Department, some of the specific revisions Vll'ere dis- cussed. The present \5-hour\· Math 1 will ·become a fO'll·r credit hour course. This rrew \Mathe- matics 4\ wiU cover. ·differential and integrai calculus, with less direct emphasis on, .~nalyti-c geom- etry; rather than spending the entire first term on analytk .geometry itself, ·Math 4 will in- cot'porat.e some of the a:pp1ica- tions of anaiytic geometry il.lto a study of calculus.

The course which is n()o.W known as Math 2 will remain a 3 credit hoQllr course in the \pre-calculus\ .fie1d. Analytic ·geametry will stiU be studied in .Math 2,, but \some newer ideas ·in matheana\tics teach- ing, --such as· certain ap.pJi,cations to el!lmentary statl~tics,\' will also ·be covered.

It would be feolhardy to merely condemn the frater- nity system, for the fraternities at l?nion serve Il!a~y use- ful functions. Prof. Lee, in fact, pomted out their mvalu- able aid in providing a peer group for the maturing stu- dent. However, at tllis point frater11ities are far from a positive force in the debatable maturing process of the student at Union. The problem of racial and religious discrimination amono- Union's fraternities is a subtle one. Although very rarely' brought into the open, it is still clearly recognized that one wouldn't look to this college as the example to emulate on this issue. This campus still has considerable ground to cover before it can boast the \integrated\ fra- ternities found on many other college.campuses throughout the country. Following Prof. Lee's reasoning, then, one would have to l:onclude that Union's fraternities are stunting rather than promoting the development of their members. And the sooner tlris fact is 'brought into the open, and freely admitted by fraternity members, the sooner action can be taken to alleviate the situation. lt was pointed out at the lecture, that quite often the most valuable advances in helping to eliminate such inhibi- tory practices as discrimination, come from within the gt·oups themselves rather than from .outside pressure. The example used was the integration of professional baseball which was accomplished entirely from within the ranks of the sport.

Tippecanoe: An Appraisal By G~rald Sehwinn Those men who came to Union following World War II felt that students should have more to say about College policy than their pre-war predecessors. One of the more lasting results of this in· creased concern with students' re- sponsibilities has been ''N.ppe- canoe. The Tippecanoe Conference, in- formal gatherings of undergrad- uates, faculty and administration, attempt to discuss problems which are common to the whole College. This is the thirteenth year of Tippecanoe. The first Conference was held at Camp Tippecanoe, a YMCA day camp in Rotterdam, in the spring of 1947. President David- son was nearing completie>n of his first year at Union. The guid- ing principle of this gathering and subsequent Tippecanoe Con- ferences has been \to clarify is- sues by ·p!'esentation of opinions and attitudes of interested par- ties,'' and a discussion of those facts which are pertinent. to the issues under consideration. Site Changed til> College OI'iginally there were .twD such conferences each year, ·but ·pres- ently, there is only one a year. The site was changed from the \Y\ camp to the College because of more adequate facilities for holding meetings and feeding the par.ticipants. It is interesting to note that at the first Conference the topics were class attendance, an honDr system, superior academia per- formance as a reason for being excused from final exams, and the chapel requirement. Mr. Ketz, who was Co-Drdinator of Student Activities when the first Tippecanoe Conference was held, said in an interview that their inception was the result of the mature attitude of the Vets who then composed most of the student body. This was also the era when students first appeared on faculty committees and agitar tion brought the Rathskeller into existence. It is difficult to say how effec- tive any conferences were, but the fact that there is a place for students and faculty to discuss mutual problems and to find solu- tions has given Tippecanoe a per- manent spot on the College cal- endar. These meetings are typi· cal: of the Union approach to col· lege education. In many areas the inte!'ested student can con- tribute as much as a faculty member or an administrative of- ficer. Tippecanoe is more than a time for students to petition for theil• various projects. Discussions of the effectiveness of the Student Council or of new areas of stu- dent activity are often initiated by the faculty. Certain of the topics on this year's agenda show the increas- ing desire of students to play a larger role in the formation of certain College policies. Particu- larly the necessity for a student union and more participation on faculty committees are questions which have attracted the serious attention of many students. The purpose of Tippecanoe is not to resolve completely certain issues but to bring them to the attention of the entire College community. A well thought out agenda is basic to each Confer- ence, but it is the work done afterwards by faculty and stu- dents which decides its ultimate success.

Friday, May 15., 1959 4 was a talk given at Old Cihru:pel. Mrsc Jenkins Resigns As Bookstore Hea,d Admissions Explained ... (Contiuued from Page 1) a mature indi·vidual. Colleges are often accused o.f pt:'esenting a sit- uation whwh is coRsidera'bly dif- ~erent from the actual world; by broadening the geographical dis- tribution ·of '3tudents, Union is att('mpting to more .closely ap- proximate the s·ituation students wHI eacounter follow.ing gradua- tion. and most of these gifts •carne from alumni. The College is dependent on its alumni for swpport, and the College r0turns aid ·by providing education for qualified .sons of alumni. At present the gua:rantee of acceptance is merely a nice gesture on the part o.f the Ad- missions Committee, but as more people begin entering College a reserved place in a freshman class is going to ·be quite valuable. Polemically . G • This correspondent would esti- mate the percentage of Fraternity men at the tw0 meetings was well over seventy percent. It might have been thought that fraternity men would not wish to attend a talk by such a vvell-lmown critic of fraternities. Thei.r turnout at the two discussions may be some indication that fraternity men are coming more intere~ted in allev- iating the causes of fraternity criticism. (Continued from Page 2) last week's Conc()rdy, but possibly the most significant, was the re- port that the HF'IC su:b-committee on I\UShing was working on a re- vised \I.'Whing proposal. Mr. Wal- ter Casey, cha:h•man, is to be con- gratulated for his efforts taward finding a solution to the rushing problem.

The Jesire to broaden the geo- graphical distribution of Union stl:tdents are ·bei.ng helped by a tl'end in col1 legB ad·mission poH- C'ies. Mr. Pe·a·rson said that he he couhl f.ore~ee in the not too distant fU;ture that his affice wo1:1ld be writing to each second- ary school in their files and tell- ing them just how many of their students the College could accept each year. Amherst and the Uni- versity of Rochester are already doing this for an increasing num- bPr of high sch·ools every year. This trend is .bPing acccentuated by the growiNg number of above average students who at·e apply- ing to college. Bel•ieving that it is better to ta:ke students from as wide an area a.s possi,ble, this means thut the competition f,or admission to Union is more severe The desire to broaden the geo- graphic tl distribution of entering students and give fi.rst consider•a- tion to sons of alumni will not be allowed to enda:nger the acad•eani.c standards of t;he .College. The most important qualification is accepting anyone will always lby his ability to complete satisfruc\ torily the work which will be re- quired o·f him.

One of the things which ·has greatly contributed to this has been Union's unique and higlrly successful Alumni ·Fund Drive. Under the able <lirection of Ed- wal'd Ruth, head of the Alumm Relations Corrunittee and next year's President O·f the Student Council, a considerable· percentage of the students wcro rnade aware of and contributed to the d:rive.

Gruenther, Presi- dent of the American Red Cross and former Com- nmnder-in-Chief of NATO forces in Europe, while lec- turing on \Security in an Uneasv World\ in Memorial Chapel on Tuesday, l\Tay 19, at .8 :30 P.l\T. lie also spoke on \Current World Prob- lems'' in a specially sched- u1e~l eonvocaticm on Wednes- day at 10 A.l\I. There wei·e three facets to the problem of secul'ity that Gruen- ther discussed: the miJi.tary, the economic, and the psychological aspects. In 1947, the U. S. mili- tar-y strategists realized they couldn't defend the United States from this continent alone; bases or I:amparts far from our shor-e became a necessity. This feeling culminated ten years ago in the foz·mation of NATO, composed of fifteen nations. Furthermore, the U. S.. at present, has coJ.Iective secur-ity agreements with a total of 42 countries. Gruenther con- cluded that on the basis of the above, \a third world war i.s im- possible; no country will dare to attack because our tremendous retaliatory power means certain destruction for the aggressor.\ Oted Spiritual Security Passing over the economic as- pect, Gruenther emphasized what he considered to be the psycho- logical or spiritual part of secur- ity. This included the attitude within the United States as well as in countries abroad. The in- te!\nal problem is presently that of aedlcation and discipline. Children brought up in the Soviet Union are indoctrinated with a dedication to the state from the time they enter school. Although the population of Russia is in the neighborhood of 20!},000,000, only 3,000,000 are members of the communist party. Membership in the party is looked forward to, as the individual advances in school. As selections of super-ior people who will eventually be ad- mitted to the party are made, this anticipation takes the form of a religion. There is nothing in the U. S. which approadhes this zeal pi\es- ent in Russia. Gruenthei\ warned that, \if we are to compete ade- quately, a feeling of dedication in ('Continued on Page 6) ---0--- SC Holds Final Session Last Tuesday's Student Coun- cil meeting, the final one of the pr-esent term, was devoted to wrapping up the year-end busi- ness of the Council. 'The meeting was highlighted by the c<Jmmendation of Council President of the Student Body Eugene Cassidy for his service thid past year. Professor Joseph Finkelstein, Faculty Representa- tive and Advisor, presented the traditional gavel to the outgoing Prexy. In other action, next year's Student Tax Committee leaders were voted upon. Walter Casey was elected Chairman, and Paul O'Neil and Carl Nelson were named to assist him. According to tradition, Nelson, a sopho- mOJ'C, will become Tax Committee Chairman in his senior year. Ed- ward Ruth will automatically be- come a Committee member be- cause of his position as Student Body President. A I·ecommendation by Gerald Fincke resulted in the addition of Neal Singer to tbe Student Union Committee, headed by Alexander \Sonny\ Evans. Finally, Kenneth Hoyt was ap- pointed to the post of NSA Co- orclinato!\ for the 1959-6(} school yea.r. Hoyt '\'as also named Chairman of this Fall's Orienta- tion. Committee.

For example, there is the one Heather Goquickly gave, some years ago, in her tiny Manhattan apartment. • Ali~ formed in front of her place at six o'clock; it was almost seven before I stood, cold can of Schaefer beer in hand, in a crowded corner of the apartment. I watched Heather flying smoothly over the up- ~urned heads of her adoring claque (a stagehand- friend had put up one of those wire rigs one associates with ornate teleVision productions of Pet.er Pan), dispensing Schaefer-largesse and pointing out chairs to the most elderly of her guests. A creep shouted up at Heather. His head was huge- big, and he w:;ts wearing stilts; without them, one· might have thought him a Dwa1i Person. Words came out of his l?outh like machine-gun bullets: \Rat-a-tat-tat; tat-tat: and tat,\ he said, handing Heather her three-stringed dulcimer, which she played very well. Strumming it, she began to sing the happy air so popular to- day: What d'yrk hear in the best of circles? \Schaefer all around!\ Then she' landed beside me aml wistfully dranltmy beer. \Howj tres, tres!'' she sighed in her happy~sad voice. \Me or the Schaefer?\ \Both of you, darling. You remind me of my brother Ed; the Schaefer, that's.easy: it's got a smooth round flavor; never sharp, never flat.\ A tiger cub jumped into Heather's arms. She handed him to me. \You keep him Ed, or darling; or Whoever you are; I think I'm off fGr Tangier now.\ Taking only a can .of Schaefer, she was gone; I've heard from her just once: a post card scribbled in Swahili. Of course, the tiger grew too big, and I had to let him go. I've seen him since, though; he's· found a proper home With a traveling circus. I hope ;Heather has too. THE ·F. & M.

I've been able to continue my education in the company's Physics Program for college graduates. And I also have the advantage of association with top technical experts in my work. Opportunities like this have helped me real· ize that long-range programs are important-for both men and missiles.\ Harry Lawton is one of ,several hundred technical graduates who are devoting their skills to the develo:t>· ment ofi4 government missile projects to which General Electric is a major contributor. More and more our scientific progress and om- national security depend on men like this - men who bring high qualifications to their work a.nd who continue their quest for knowledge, both on and off the job. General Electdc believes that individual initiative and career g1•owth are essential to America's continued technological leadership. To this end, the company en~ courages all of its employees- including more tpan 30,000 college graduates- to develop to their fullest capabilities by }}roviding opportunities £or inc1·easing knowledge and working sldlls. 7>rcgre$S /$ Ovr Mo# lmporlanf Ptorlvcl GENERAL f) ELECTRIC F tl ~ a c ]] 'Y f

(Continued from Page 1) our country must develop.\ • • A second problem under psy- chological security which d-ruen· ther stressed was communicating with other countries of the world, thus inspiring confidence in peo· pie who think as we do. At times this is difficult. Having a high standard of living, there is a tre- mendous gap between the U. S. and t;he have-not nations of the world such as- India, Where the life expectancy is 32 years and the average Income is $58 a year. It is a gap that must decrease because more than one third of the world's population are have- not nations on the order of India. \If we should ever lose any part of that population, guided mis- siles, atomic bombs, all the wea- pons in the world are not going to redress the loss of balance in the world,\ commented 'Gruen- ther. Asians Want Change The General continued by stressing that ilhe underdeveloped countries of the Far East and Africa no longer want to be the \hewers of wood.\ They want a change, and they want it quickly. Krushchev, pointing to Soviet progress since 1917 from an agricultural country of peasants to a strong world power, prom- ised them this. According to Gruenther, their victory in launching the first Sputnik low- ered our smugness and has caused us to redress our educa- tional system; however, s.ome- thing more has to be done, Turning to specific present world problems, Gruentlher de-· scribed the situation in Berlin. In an effort to keep people pehind the iron curtain in the satellite countries, Khrushchev has used barbed wire to fence off East Germany from the West, The only opening in this fence is Ber- lin. People living in East Berlin who work in West Berlin need only cross the street and take a subway ride to freedom. Gruen- ther -added that in the last ten years, some :1,000,000 people, in- cluding doctors and professors, escaped through this gap. O.n November 27, 195&, Kruslhclhev is- sued a threa-tening ultimatum to the West concerning Berlin. Al- though the limit for aJction was set as May 27, 'Gruenther pre- dicted that nothing will be done in the nex.t few weeks. Fol'lnosa Is Main Objective Finally, on the question of Red China, Grueruthet• showtcd concem over the influe11ce of the indus-- trial progress of Red China on neighboring Asiatic nations. More important, ho·wever in his' opinion, was the latest Red Chinese at- tack on the two small Nationalist held islands, Quemoy and Mats.u. Two years· ago, under the same circumstances, the Communists failed to live up to their boast and were unsuccessful against the stalwart defense of the Na- tionalists. The main ohjective, however, is Form.osa. \If F'orn1osa is lost, the U, '8. wotlld be in real troub'le,\ said Gruenther. \No amount of appeMement will move the Commbunists from their· objective.\ Gruenther concluded optimis- tically with a faith In a growing spirit in the individual, devell)p- ing .more cooperation with the backward nations of the world and a general broadening of our horizons, FOR ·STU:DENTS LIGHT UP AND LIVE IT UP! 3greatcigarettesofferyo~627chancestowin!
