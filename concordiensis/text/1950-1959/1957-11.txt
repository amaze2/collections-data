Hurd, Pr9fessor of Chemistry at Vnion College, which appeared in the March, 1956, issue of the JoW'l18l of Che~cal Education, has been .translated into Spanish and circ . u}ated to many secondary schools in Chile, South America. Entitled How Can More Stu • dents - Be • Encouraged to Study Chemistry as a. Profession, the article is concerned with the efforts mad:e at Union Col- lege to .promote study in thl' field of chemistry. It dealt spe- cifically with informal dinner- discussion sessions which Union has · sponsored' <'luring the past · several years for chemistry teach- ers from area schools. Responsible for the translation of Dr . Hurq's ai · ticle was Dr . Elnnio Bianchi, Professor of Chemistry and Director of the In- stitue -- of ChE:,mistry of the Cath- olic University C>f 'C}lile. In a re - cent letter to Professor Hurd, Dr. Bia.nchi indicated that the situa- tion in Cl;lile with regard to the scientific level of high school preparation, partictilarly in the fie1d of chemistry, is highly sim- ilar to that which exists in the U1;1ited ' States. \I have rea,d yqui' report , \ be said, \ . .. and have observed a great coincidence ip the b8.!3ic points of this problem . . .

It Is now the tune of year for the HouS'e Presi- dents' Council to begin thei1· annual rushing survey.

Frat~rnities are an essential part of the total exper- Ience winch a student receives at l!nion. Every-student who wishes to gain by this experience should have the ri.gh ~ to partic:ipate. we prupose a system of preferential b1ddmg as the means b;v which this end may be reached. Aftel' an inactive rushing period and a two week ac- tive !'ushing period haYe occurred, the fraternities will submit a number of lists containing the number and choice of their prospective pledges. The freshmen in turn will submit first, second and third choices of the fraternities they would most like to enter. Clerical sorting follows and the choices are matched so that the most closely coinciding preferences are coupled. Thus every freshman who wished to participate in fraternity life at Union will have the opportunity. If a s~udent wishes to remain a non-participant, the option is his. To further smooth rushE:e-fraternitv relations another rushing period follows. If after the first \ballot\ there are still bids outstanding and freshmen unbidded the few un- satisfactory situations will be corrected. Fraternities wilL be able to pledge as many freshmen as they need to profitably maintain their house. Thev will no longer have to worry about the present conditions of fast or famine. Unfilled beds and ove1·-large pledge classes can both be done away with. Our proposal is neither new nor radical, but a practical system which has worked in many colleges such as Am- herst, Williams and Syracuse. Even if Union has given up the lead in formulating fraternity policy, it still can follow a successful example. If preferential bidding becomes institutionalized at the College, it may also be possible to initiate a system of de- ferred ru'shing. Neither freshmen nor fraternity members have an adequate opportunity to know each other in the first two hectic weeks of class. The new student, in addi- tion to the new college experience which he must undergo, is subjected to the whirlwind of rushing. Scholastic inter~ ests must be neglected and the freshman soon finds him- self behind before he has begun.· Campus activities also suffer for no freshman would dare leave his room to write an article or participate in a debate for fear of missing the knock on his door. Union's newest students·have scarcely met each othe1' by the time bids are distributed. They never have suffi- cient opportunity again because they go down 17 different paths.

Dr. Weaver's only complaint was that he could not manage to the onset, there was an air of hysteria, but in general, ali stu- dents were very well composed. It seemed that in every fraternity there was a healthy atmosphere of cooperation. The healthy fra- ternity men made a valuable con- tribution in combating the flu by offering their assistance to the sick men.\ The New Dormitory The college administration is to be comm:onded on_its decision to construct a new freshmen dormitory. H1gh school classes are growing _at an alarming rate and each year a higher percentage of graduates wish to attend in- stitutions of higher learning. Colleges must be able to accommodate the increased number of qualified applicants. The proposed dormitory shows a realistic acceptance of this fact. . In addition, tentative plans call for lounges to be in- stalled in North and South Colleges, as well as parlors in each floor of the new dorm. This represents a more real- istic and enforceable approach applicable to feminine guests in the do1·mitoiies. However, the erection of new living quarters for freshmen, as badly as it is needed, creates many prob- lems which will require further study. By increasing the size of each class by 50 to 75 students, a great deal of strain will be placed upon existing college facilities. Can the language building, the laboratory equipment of the various sciences, and the already crowded classrooms of Bailey Hall bear the burden of a student body swelled by over 200? Should the physical plant of the college prove equal to the task, what of the added strain upon the faculty? Will the ratio 0f students to faculty members be allowed to increase from ten to one to twelve to one, thereby de- stroying much of the close contact that exists between student and professor? If not, is Union prepared to pay salaries commensurate with the additional experienced and outstanding personnel needed?

Dr. Davidson stated that the $700,000 to be borrowed for construction costs cannot be used for a new library, and admittedly, the interest rate of three percent is un- usually reasonable. Nevertheless, interest will still amount to $21,000 per year. Coupled with this is the fact that a student's tuition covers approximately one-half of the money Union pays to educate him.

First, which is so sorely needed. many houses have been forced to base their annual finan-' cial income upon their pledges, and an extension of the rushing period might deprive them of this needed income. The certainty of a full pledge class, however, would go a long way towards alleviating the worry.

Photography Editor The Open Mind Mr. Sobol and His Critics To the Editor of Concor<liensis: In glancing through the pon- cordieilsis :Jast week, a very in- teresting letter caught my eye. It was, I suppose, a retaHaUve epistle occasioned by an article written the week before by Mr. SobGI. The style of this retalia- tc·ry letter was so .peculiar that it aroused my curiosity to the extent that I felt it was only fair to Mr. SGhol to read his arti(!le. After going through the neces- sary research entailed in turning up a two-week old issue of Con- col'diensis, I managed to read Mr. Sobol's article. It v. as not at all what I sup- posed it might be through l'CU'l\ ing the letter composed by th~ Student Council representative of th(' J.uni01· Class. Instead, it \\':1.3 a mature, cogent expression of a growing sentiment at Union; namely, that the elections Lo the offices of the student cou:J.ci! are becoming farcical. · Although Mr. ·Sobol never attack- ed anything but the manner in which elections were b,eld, they feel this irrelevent topic in some way refutes his arguments. Then, in the crucial parag-raph of the letter, these men try to devastate their \opponent'• .by ad- mitting he was correct in stating that the \election system has its fallacies.\ If the reader by now wonders how this proves their case he must 1•efer to their next statement: \it is as efficient D;nd democratic as possible.\ They r:ow feel that they have clinchPd their case and can dism:ss Mr. Sobol and his article as an ax- ample of \immatu1:e thi·nkin4.\ They have, however, only suc- ceeded in displaying that M·r. So- bol must have been correct in hi.o critici.;m, For how can a Ia.,ge portion of what is supposetl!y a responsible 'organizaUon hope I o defend their institution by a uug- matic, totally unsubstantiated a::.- sertion of precisely what their' oppom.nts question? The Conoordiensis is in favor of fraternities. We be- lieve that they are an integral part of the :present Union College. Fraternities have definite s.ocial functions and provide room and board for the majority of Union's. stu- dents. In fact, fraternities are an essential part of the ex- perience which a student receives at the College. We be- lieve that every student deserves to benefit from this ex- perience. My interest in this letter liPs not so much in the subject, how- ever, as in the manner the au- thors chose to defend themselves. a manner which s:gggests that their case is either very w~Cak or perhaps non-existent. For, in their opening .paragraph, they ex- pressed the opinion that Mr. Sobol was neither logical, rational, nor constructive. They then inad- vertently went on to cleverly il- lusb·ate the adjectives they chose in what they wrote thems.:h·cs. What is worse, however, than the case the Junior Class Repre- sentatives to the Student Council submit against a serious, well- founded criticism, is the manner in which they try to aba1>e Mr. Sobol. Either stated outrigh:, or implied none too subtly .in th~:t letter they call Mr. Sobol illqgi- cal, irrational, unconstruCJtive, negative, inaccllrate, immature, erroneous off-base, non-factually minded <a euphemism for a liar) and biased. Despite what ;me previously thought about tbe Stu- dent Council, I feel that such a puerile and slurring defence of it calls for some honest investiga- tion. They dogmatically prociled to state that Mr. Sobol was nega- tive and unconstructive but never substantiate their accusatbn9. Instead, by some devious logic, they state their second point, which is a description of the work of committees in the Cou.wil. Ira C. Halperi>1 '58 Throughout the week we have heard many criticisms of the plan advocated in this column last week and have received one Letter to the Editor. Most of the criticisms focus upon supposed injustices or inequalities which may take place. Again, may we say, the Concordiensis is ad- vocating a plan which is neither new nor radical, but a system which has worked in such schools as Williams (see page one) and Amherst. Since it has worked, the only valid objection is that \Union is not as good as Williams or Amherst. Thus a plan which works there will not work To the Editor of Concordiensis: here.\ We hope that this is only a statement opposing Archaic System Revisited right, even to a larger extent than the proposed system of institu- tionalized rushing. change and not a true indication of Union's status. We spoke to Robert West, Managing Editor of the Amherst Student. He told us that the program of prefer- ential bidding has been a success. \Nobody has even sug- gested returning to the original system,\ he added. \Has the system hurt fraternities,\ we asked. \No \ he an- swered, \fraternities on campus are as strong as 'they ever have been.\ We have heard a great deal about the student \who nobody wants,\ what has happened to him? \Though we worried about the hypothetical situation before the sys- tem began, the problem has never materialized. The House Management Committee\ (similar to Union's House Presidents' Council) \has been able to work things out each year and we have no reason to believe that it will not be able to do so in the future,\ he concluded. Andrew Hamsell, Editor of the Williams Record felt that the system of \total opportunity\ has had a sudcess- ful init!al ~·e~~· He ~ade it clear that the proposal was fratermty 1mbated. There has been no administration pressu:e ?f any sort,\ he added. In addition, \'total op- ~ortumty has strengthened the fraternity system at Wil- liams.\ The Concordiensis .suggests a system which will work. If me~ have closed mmds, they will find objections and excepbons a!ld ~he plan will never 1·each the blueprint stage. If theu· mmds are open, they will be able to discuss change and perhaps improve the suggested proposals. ' • We hope that the Student ·Council H. P. C. Committee This letter is a defense of our \Archaic\ rushing system. The proposed system of institionallz- ed rushing is obviously the re- sult of sound reasoning, hut un- fortunately 'that reasoning did not go far enough. There are a few arguments that must be consid- ered before such a system can be taken seriously, Fraternities are private insti- tutions, and they are made up of private individuals. If fraterni- ties are such institutions,. then those private individuals :belong- ing to them should have the ex- clusive rjght to choose whom they will accept into their membership. Likewise, if fraternities are pri- vate institutions, it follows that membership in them is not a right, it is a .privilege' extended by the present members of those fraternities. I don't think it can be disputed that an individual bas the right to choose thosP with whom he is going to live and as- sociate. * * * Now, here, it will be pointed out that the freshmen who are rushed, are likewise individuals and are enfitled to the same right as fraternity men in choosing whom they are to live and associ- ate with. Our present rushing system allows the freshman this The object of rushing is to se- lect those individual freshmen, regardless of the total number, who sh·au reasonably compatable with each individual member of the fraternity in question. This is what our ·rushing system seeks to accomplish, and therefore, it is an affair between individuals, not groups. i(· * * It follows from this, that if rushing is an affair ·between in- dividuals, then each freshman has an equal opportunity to make a favora.ble impression upon the in- dividual fraternity- men who rush him, lt does not follow, however, that it would be advantageous to this freshman to have his associ- ation fot'ced upon fraternity men whom he, himself, has failed to impress favorably. This proposed system of institutionalized rush- ing would undoubtedly cause such situations to arise. The question tha.t will be raisetl at this point is that of the inade- quate shortness of our formal rushing period_ It must be re- membered that at this college the pledge period is eJGtremely long. It is sufficiently long enough for the freshman pledges (Continued on Page 4) Is composed of men with open minds.

For an election to be worth- whHe it must have some roean- ilig ~r purpose. Basicailly, the purpose of an election should not be merely to .fill offices, but rather to provide tho voters with an op- portunity to make known their wishes for the ·desirable coup:Je of their government. V\,'hen an elec- tion does not provide the elector- ate with such an opportunity, the choice becomes one of tweediedee or tweedledum, and the election is meaningless. * * it· There has not, in this writer's opinion, been a meaningfuf elec- tion on this campus in the last three years. Each year, the stu- dent body is presented with a statement of purposes from each candidate ,but, with assoded plati- tudes declaring his intentim].s to continue and perhaps even im· prove the good work of previous student leaders. If this be the case, the basic question is: just what was ,the good work of the student leaders? In the past three years, the only action of the Student Council that has affected the bulk of the students is the issuance of identi- fication cards. The worth of this project is subjer:t to some ques- tion, but assun-,ing the desirabil- ity of the cards, is this enough to show for three years effort? I think not. It is not to the Student Coun- cil's credit that it is capable of handling the routine functions which for years have been the re- sponsibility of the council. Rather the Student Council should pro- vide leadership and realize its po- tential as a powerful organ of student opinion. The pressure .of . student opinion, effectively ap- plied, could easily accomplish a great deal in the student's inter- Apex Records present On LP BELAFONTE SINGS OF THE CARIBBEAN Harry Bela-lionte, RCA Victor est. The fact that the student body has not demanded this lead- ership from the Student Council reflects either its immaturity or e:l(treme apathy. The latter alter- native does not seem :valid be,. ·cause there is a great deal of in- terest shown in student problems if not in student g·overnment at Union. Despite this interest, the students are willib,g to thro.w away their opportunity to elect an ·effective government for the sake of a few funny posters and glad hands at election time. At this . stage ~f our educational develop- ment, satisfaction with the mean- ingless elections which we now have, seems (I repeat) ''to reflect the basic immatu.rity of the stu. dent body as .a whold.\ Briefly, these are some ideas which might increase th~? effec- tiveness of the student govern• · ment. Elections .should be made a much more serious affair. Class meetings should be held where the council candidates could set forth their reasons for feeling qualified to r-epresent their class. Smokers could be held at which the students could speak informally with aU the candi• dates. Issues rather than perso.n- alities should be stressed. Ambi- tion, should not he a valid reason for candidacy, Voting should be encouraged. This goal would be automatically accomplished by the vehicle of a meaningful cam•· paign.

CIRCULA'l'ION David Pearee, Richard Russac!(, Robert Sallick, Joel Berinstein New Cut Syste~ Stephen Melvyn • Vnusual Game Russian Roulette ·Returns ,• By Bruce Hauptman Would you dare take a six-gun, The Concordiensis Editorial Board wishes. to com- mend the Faculty Committee on Attendance for its action of Tuesday in eliminating cuts for upperclass courses (see stoi·y, Page One). While the plan as stated may admit- tedly contain imperfections, it represents a definite step forward. put a bullet in one of the six chambers, spin the cylinder, point the gun to your temple-and pull the tt·igger? A one chance in si\' gamble of blowing your brains out! Well, studen:ts at Columbia U. are doing .it with blank guns (a loud-explodilrg, ·bulletless powder gun). They're making a campus fad out of the devil-may-care ga&e that was played by Russian violence of guns with a match- of-wits card game. The result was the most exciting game any- one there had ever played. It ran for ten straight hours'--when the players couldn't stand the nervous tension any longer. By the next day, the new~;! of it had reached almost everyone on the campus and when the RR club was formed a few days later, it 'became the biggest fad ever The basic flaw in the new cut program is its unwill- ingness to allow cuts in any but specified courses (those above the twenty-level). But what the Faculty Council has done, in effect, is to extend the \Privilege\ system which exists now in the form of unlimited cuts for Dean's royalty under- the czars. In fact, hardly had school started when mysterious night prowlers cha:lk- ed the autere build.Jngs surround- ing the university with the words \Russian Roulette!\ -List students. The premise is that students taking upper- class courses, like Dean's List students, are superior lights who can afford the cuts. This premise, though worthwhile, is not wholly true. But it is at least partially true, and the aim of the Faculty Council is therefore laudable. While seeking to extend cut privileges, the Council has stopped short of abolishing cuts completely. To abolish cuts completely, wollld, as we see it, do away with a valuable asset. To hold the pmc- tice of cutting up to the student as a reward for scholar- ship is a wise if not wholly idealistic policy. The practice of cutting classes, we feel, is not the right of each and every student. A student unable to maintain a creditable index (3.0) or unwilling to take ·-challenging courses (those above twenty-level) is unwor- thy of the privilege of taking \unlimited\ cuts. That the Council has continued to regard cutting as a privilege rather than a right and, at the same time, extended the privilege to previously worthy but unprivileged students is entirely commendable. The Student Union For many years, the creation of a Student Union as a SCK!ial center for non-fraternity men has been in the pro- cess of evolving. Now, due t() the imminent need present- ed by the admittance of a larger Freshman class it will finally come into existence. Explosive Meetings This was a C\Gnsequence of the RR club, which has been shat- tering the cam·pus with its ex- plosive meetings to find the snap- ping point of the human nervous system with Russian Roulette. Dedicated to .playing a defanged version of the deadly game, the club has been spreading its gos- pel to other colleges-already it's the craze of seven campuses. The campus Russian Roulette is a safe if not sane version of the old fatal amusement. The players use a loud-exploding pow- der gun; a match-of-wits card game determines the number of times the players spin the gun cylinder and pull the trigger. No one can claim credit for having conceived it-it grew out of a poker game at a frat house, v. hen someone pulled out a blank gun as a gag and suggested playing Russian Roulette. Everyone was for it, and they drew cards to decide the order of play. But after awhile that seemed too ele- mentary, so ru:nbellishments were made. From it came a complete- ly new game that combined the known to a university. Natur- ally others have made adaptations of the game that was played that evening, and these have been .in- corporated In the official rules esta.bHshed by the club. Iron Nerves \R:R can now be played by those without suicidal tendencies,\ says Columbia's RR's president. \But harmless as it is, it's still noisy and nerve-shattering. You're gambling your nerves instead of your life-and it takes glits ,to put the exploding powder gun to your head. Waiting for the gun ham- mer to punctuate the game with a sudden explosion can ·be terri- fying . . . This thing's strictly for the fate-defiers who like the thrill of a sudden and hysterical end- ing.\ Andrews points out that \there hasn't been a national campus fad since goldfish-swallowing and record-eating during the 1980's. Then came the 40's-with war, cram courses, GI Bill students with families. Everything was deadly serious. The 1950's have a hangover from that period. Rus- sian Roulette is a rebellion against that kind of thinking-and I think .its a wholesome sign that college students are again becom- ing devil-may-care in their per- spective. Students all over are joining us. in making Russian (Continued on Page 6) We would like to commend the advocates of this policy (}n their forward thinking. Their action clearly illustrates ihe fad that the :fdministration is aware of the problems (}f independents. It proves that a student who wishes to l'ernain outside the fraternity system can do so and still €njoy he social functions which typify college life. Swan,s Way · By Jim Swan However, we are certain that it will be almost impos- sible to raise funds for this endeavor, in spite of the ingen- llity of David Kurland. Therefore we propose that the Student Activities Office allot definite amount& for the initiation of the project and its upkeep. ss For Your Information The awakening of a new era of l!beralmindedness would appear to be in the offing at our own Union College, or so it would seem from this week's Faculty ruling on the cut situation. But if we stifle for a moment our imme\ diate cries of joy to take a quick and penetrating look at the actual changes which will have been made, the new era might seem not quite so brave or new. universities, he can learn what he wants to learn withhout attending a specified number of classes - fine.

R. Burt, Exchange Pro- fessor from St. Andrews Univers- ity in Scotland, Dr. Leonard B. Clark, \Chairman of the Depart- ment of Biology, will return to Union this winter. He is sched- uled to arrive at the college some- time next week. While at St. Andrews Professor Clark taught two classes. One in Neurology and the other was a general discussion group on Topics in Biology. Both were non-laboratory two hour courses, and neither involved marking of test papers due to the European evaluation system. He will re- sume teaching his ·usual amount of classes at Union after the Thanksgiving vacation. Department Sorrowful The entire Biology Department expressed its deepest regrets over the Scotsman's .iJiness but are very happy that they will not miss the \alert and conscientious lead- ership of Union's most outstand- ing scholar.'' Professor Burt was stricken with a gall bladder attack last week. His condition is improv- ing but he will not be able to return to work for at least an- other year. At Union, he taught one class in Parisitology, one in Comparative Anatomy, and th1·Pe afternoon laboraties in Compara- tive Anatomy. Campus Chest ...

DSP main lower than those at Am- herst, Haverford, Williams, and other comparable Institutions SIC- cording to statistics released by the National Education Assc.cia- tion. Although the recipient of a $1,040,000 Ford Foundatio-n grant, Union's pay rates are only slightly higher than the national average. parts of New York State receive higher salar-ies than UnionJs fac- ulty. In t'he metropolitan New York area for example, teachers salaries range from a starting point of $5,000 to a high of $8,000 ·-=============:-, for non-administrative teaching li positions. PROCTO'R*S Saturday Classes One of the chief criticisms of this institution noted in last year's report of the Middle States Evaluation Com- mittee was the relative torpor of faculty scholarship and research. It was suggested at that time by the Evaluation Committee that Union faculty membeTs should be given more leisure time to conduct scholarly inquiries into Jhe nature of things-more specifically, that Saturday classes be eliminated. Saturday classes, of course, have never been a popular institution at Union, but, because they facilitate scheduling procedures, they have never been repudiated. Now, how- ever, the faculty members of Division One, supplied ~ith a practical reason for doing away with weekend classes, have succeeded in drafting a plan under which Union might l>e put on a five-day week. This plan, which will soon be ]}roposed to all divisions for general acceptance has both advantages and disadvantages, as must any plan which seeks to condense and reshape a system well-molded by the press of time. In any case, an explanation of the Division One Plan is certainly in orde1· and a brief three-point outline might be set up as follows: (1) (2) (3) Saturday classes to be struck from all sched- ules. Regular 3-day-a-week eight o'clock classes to be eliminated. The vacated eight o'clock periods on Mon- days, Wednesdays, and Fridays to absorb the Saturday classes eliminated in point ( 1). Thus, in practice, the Division One Plan would effect no real changes in Monday-Wednesday-Friday classes other than the elimination of regular eight o'clock sections. The significant innovation here is, of course, the disappearance of Saturday sessions. The median faculty salary of $6,800 can be subdivided as fol- lows: full professors, $7,800; as- sociate professors, $6,300; assist- ant professors, $5,500; instructors, $4500. These figures represent an increase of almost 100% over those in 1946, when Dr. Carter Davidson became president of Union._ How- ever, this increase loses much of. its luster when It is noted that in that same period of time the index of living. rose over 120 per cent. The National Education Associ- ation's figures on college and uni- versLty salaries show that in state and municipal institutions the median faculty salary is con- siderably higher than those in efect at Union. Salary scales at municipal institutions for e:xample range from $8,968 for full professors to $5,084 for instructors. Public school teachers in some While the formal education of ' Union's faculty has for the most part prooeeded far beyond the graduate level, members earn, on the average, less than the stand- ard graduate. The average sal- ary of the only comparably sc'hoo!- ed group, professional men, is some $2,000 higher than the med- ian Union salary. Further illus- trating the· need for salary im- provements is the fact that the average skilled or semi-skilled worker can today expect t{) bring home ·a:hout $30() more per year than a Union instructor. In 1939 salaries of Union .professors were 11 percent a;bove that of the aver- age American 'breadwinner. To- day they are a scant four percent higher than the nation's average. !Faculty salaries are determin- by the trustees of the college. If the median faculty salary is to be raised to the minimum $7,500, as suggested by Dr. iDavidson, it will ·have to be done on January 30, the date of the next trustee meet- Ing. Letter From the Dean To the Student Body of the Col- lege Gentlemen: From all available accounts one can hardly avoid the conclusion that some of the events of this last weekend were at best deplor- able. I can remember no prom weekend at which tl:tere was as much overt . aggression, destruc- tiveness, and violation of the proprieties. As in all such af- fairs, it was undoubtedly a few vtho caused most of the trouble, yet it is the entire c-ollege com· munity which receives the biame. great many men have learned a good deal of permanent value in the prQ.Cess of goverping :them- selves. It Is this second point that merits emphasis at the moment.

The prospect of thirty such \weekends\ per year mig-ht stir :faculty members to scholarly undertakings of such magni- tude that even the members of the Middle States Evalua- tion Committee mig-ht be struck with awe. ln the event that the elimination of Saturday classes might add impetus to scholarship at Union College, the plan would certainly seem to be worthwhile. It would be <l()ubly worthwhile if, at the same time, it might :permit students to condense their study hours and make better use of what time they have. There are two long-standing considerations that are pertinent. First, Union College ha.s no tra- dition <Jf vi<llence and wanton de- struction <Jf property. ·Over the years, Union students have shown a reasonable respect for both col- lege and fraternity property, In the second pl(!.ce, the Union stu- dent body has long had a good deal of freedom and autonomy in managin!l\ its own affairs. As with all things human, this has not invariably worked well, but the general balance is a very fav- orable one. ·More Important, a That the 'House Presidents' Council already bas the ni·atter under serious consideration is both proper and encouraging This group, however, can go at best only part of the way. Tile basic issue rests 'With the individual. We can move in the right direc- tion only if each ·of you has ihe qourage to make it rea(iily ap- parent that you neltller want nor will tolerate the kind of behavior that brings a bad name to all. ~--------------------------~ : At ·M.
