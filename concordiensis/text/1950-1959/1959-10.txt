The four fraternities, Delta Chi, 1 Sigma Chi, Kappa Sig-ma and Theta ;Delta Chi, are or were (Della Chi, having sold their house, is now resi.Uing in Schen- ectady's Y.M.C.A.) located in a strictly residential section of Schenectady.

The Bonnie Debaters The anticipated appearance of the Cambridge de- baters on the Union campus will afford a rare privilege to the local students to hear at first hand several of the reasons why our allies from across the sea frown so dis- tainfully at our educational system. The subject to be discussed will be the secondary school system, that level of American education which has been most open to for- eign criticism in past years. That the English are particularly verbose in their criticism of the American high school has been repeat- edly demonstrated by their representatives on the annual New York Herald-Tribune Youth Forums. That the vis- itors to Union will be debaters as well as Englishmen, will certainly ensure a lively and most interesting discussion on the evening of October 8. What Makes You Fellows Think We're Having A Pa~ty? . . . American Art In Review By Eli B. Enzer The most significant art exhibit in recent years to be on the Un- ion Campus is presently being shown in Old Chapel. The show, entitled \Five Decades of Ameri- can .Art,\ is on loan from the Munson- Williams-Proctor Insti- tute of Utica, New Y<lrk and is pa!'t -of the collection bequeathed by Edward Root. The importance of the show lies both in its innate qualities in terms of art and that it is the first show to include both past masters of Alnerican art and con~ temporary great figures. The works exhibited range from the early romantic painting of 1900 through \pieces completed in the 50's. New York ,wa:s a most important event in the histary of American art, and some works, from this show are ·included in this pres- ent exhibit. In' genera;!' the p-aint· ings are romantic in nature .fol- lowing a strong pattern in .Ameri- can arc which persists today in much of the Abstract-expression- ist movement and in the m()re recent 10th Street school. A stronger emphasis on the formal elements of the painting becomes evident as' the effects of cubism and fauvism begin to appear on the American canvasses.

This certainly is democracy practiced at the grass roots, at its very best. Among other things that the HPC has done this year 'is the rather novel idea of ehanging the rules in the midst of rushing. This is a rather remarkable feat. For instance, this past 'Duesday at the HPC one house said that quite f~:anltly it was ti~:ed of the rushing, why not just cut out the rushing for Thursday night. This was accordingly seconded and passed. Legal precedent for a maneuver of this sort is surpris- ingly slim.

Turning calmly, he watched Pathos and Bathos wrestle the fiendish English archvillain, Lord Half-Nelson, to the floor, and subdue him. \Well done, rare comrades!\ he shouted. \France is saved'! Let us go to my aunt's nearby castle, for rest and Schaefer beer.\ \Let us retire to the antechambers!\ his valiant friends huzzahed. \Schaefer's got a smooth round taste-never sharp, never fiat.\ The gay blades were taking their ease in the great banquet hall when Skip the Page entered, carrying gleaming silver tankards and a single bottle of Schaefer. \Hallo.! Just one for all?\ expostulated Bathos in- credulously. \No~ all for one!\ exclaimed the greedy Pathos, snatching up the beer. \En garde, Pathos!\ murmured Altos, buckling his swash and reaching for his foil. \En garde, Pathos!\ echoed the noble Bathos. \Save your steel for the Cardinal's Guards, gentl~­ men,\ smiled a youth from . the doorway, \and answer this riddle: What d'ya hear in the best of circles?\ \Schaefer all around!\ chorused the impetuous trio. \What is your name, 0 insolence?\ asked Altos, advancing on him. \D.

Only a brief glance at the final statistics is necessa1·y to arrive at the conclusion that the new bidding system was a highly suc- cessful experiment.

Terra.ce OouncU Criticized The fo1·mation of the Te~race Council, in 1906, was the first concrPte step in the sp!rjt of g1·owing liberal feeling, .. The Council, however, left much to be desired; in r&ality it was an oii~ garchical senior class hon<>r or- ganization, with athletic distinc- tion more a criterion than inter- est or intelligence. The Concordi- ensis, in its editorial of November 27, 1931, commented; \In the first place the (Ter- race) Council is too easily con- fused with being a perennial hon- orary athletic society, Little, if any, importance has been attach- ed to it as an administrative body carrying out definite 'Plans for the welfare of the college.

But one re~ult .of' such effor.t was the growth of a rather inefficient and unwieldly :but•eaucratic sb,ucture and o'f many p:oojects definitely t:nrelated' to the purposes of NSA, Still in Stage r~~f Growth .Certainly the most sign,ificant figure to catch the eye \Under the present sy-stem, I f h f h 241 f h h d Councilmen are selected who was t 1e act t at o t e res men w o expresse an have little or no time to study One must, however, look be- yond the platitudes of a. pream- ble, in assessing the progress that an institution has made. The Council has taken on a substan- tially more democrn.tic element in recent years. 01'iginally the Coun- cil was composed of ten seniors, four juniors, three sophomores and: two freshmen; now all classes receive equal representa- tion. The nomination of officers was formerly done by the offi- <Jers themselves-making it diffi- cult for a newcomer, however popular and capable he mig4t have been, to obtain membership. Whereas now with the petition method, popular support presup- poses election.

It was from this concern and desire that the National Student .Association was to grow. in the rushing rules ()f past years. outside o:l1 classes.\ For although there was a long In sum, the 'USNSA is at a new t•istory of attempts to form some crossroads in its sear~h of fulfill- sort of organization through ing the ho!JeS of th,e students who which the students of the United make it live. The \18\ figure also proves conclusively that at the present time the 17 fl'a ternities on campus have the facil- ities to accommodate every Union student who wants to join a house. For suxely even if the remaining- 18 fresh- men were aistributed evenly among 17 f1·ateenities, no fra- ternity would be gre:ttly further taxed. It seems logical then to conclude tim t it would be possible, in terms of space, to offer to every freshman who so desired, the op- portunity to join a fr~temity. With these facts now availa:ble, the jump over to a 100% Cooperative Bidding System would seem a small gap indeed. For surely it would be a simple matter to have all the houses collaborate at this time and solve the problem of providing fraternity life for the remaining 18 freshmen. Certainly now is the time for the HPC to evaluate the bid- ding system of this year and plan to insert the final step in next year's rules which will finally bring to the Union campus a lOO~o Cooperative Bidding System. The HPC is to be congratulated for the manner in which they administered the first testing of cooperative bidding. But they must bear in mind that they have made only the first step toward solving the rushing ills of the college. To stagnate now would be fatal. Pollock Profile The Concordiensis' questionnaire so cooperatively an- swered by Dean Pollock on the following page, should be an excellent first step in quieting the fears of the student body that in hiring a new Dean, the Txustees had visions of completely revamping the extra-curricular life of the Union scholar. Although Dean Pollock has not stated very clearly what he does intend to do, he has reassured all concerned that he has no intentio11s of invoking any drastic revisions in campus life. But what is more eneouraging, perhaps, is that for the first time in print Dean Pollock also implied that he is not completely satisfied with the status quo either. Suggested in many of his answers were ideas which he is anxious to discuss with student leaders. Dean Pollock certainly seems to agr-ee completely with the rest of the administration that the job of a Student Dean is to guide student policy, not institute it. The ques- tionnaire certainly indicates that the new Dean is anxious to create a healthy and cooperative relationship with the student body. We welcome his efforts and his intentions. Hail ·Garnet! The Concordiensis would like at this time to extend its heartiest congmtulations to Garnet Editor Ron Wein- stein, '60. Perhaps one of the most time-consuming anrl unrewarding positions f~mnd on campus, Yearbooker Wein- stein undertook his task with a dedication to be unsur- passed. Many an early-morning hour found him hard at work ih the publications office, ·surrounded by one or two staff members, busily planning page layouts, selecting and mocking-up photos, and doing the other countless cho1:es that result in the successful yearbook. Artistically one of the finest Gamets ever to greet the Student Body upon their 1·eturn to the campus, the 1959 yearbook is the result of the dedication, hard Work, and ability of Mr. Weinstein. To him we extend our warmest and sincerest thanks. In addition, the same editorial went so far as to question the in- tegrity of the members of the Terrace Council, and accusations of graft and corruption folio'Xed; \The present method of raising funds by taxing the freshmen for th£> 'fights' and 'peerade' rightly arouses suspicions of graft be- cause no a<Jcounting is ever made of the money raised and SJ!ent.

He's doing specific planning of long dis· tance communications projects Involv- ing ca:ble carrier facilities and microwave radio relay systems. Bryan chose a career with Southern Bell over several other offers. \There were three things that were most impor· tantto me,\ he says. \First I wanted to go with an established, growing company where I could grow, too. Second, I wanted tliorough basic training to get started off right, plu::; participation in development programs to keep me moving ahead. And, third, I wanted to stay in the South.\ After 15 months of on-the-job b'aining -in various phases of company operations, B1'yan was assigned to the Engineering Department at Columbia, S. C. His work with carrier systems and microwave radio projects has involved him directly in the growth of the company- And he's h-l'Oadened his expedence through devel- o-Jlment courses in management, general e:ng1neering, engineering economy, and :n:Jimowave relay systems. '~I know I'm with a fast·growing com· ~any and I feel I'm really participating iiJ.its growth,~' Bryan says.\What's more, I'm getting the training I need to keep me abreast of new communications de- velopments and take h~tter advantage of e~dvancement opportunities when they eome along.'~ Bryan Clinton earned a U.S. degree in Meeltanical Engi. neering.

No Trend Seen There has been no trend either way in recent years. Figures the past five years .show that the count has stabilized at less than 100f of t!1e student body. As to the merits of this sys- tem, Dean Huntley has said, \The system is not one of punishment. The word \warning\ is used for a pta-pose; it is there to indicate to the- student that real trouble may lie ahead. The system is designed for those individuals who have the ability but not the ambition to achieve higher grades.

The Weekend Debacle The House Presidents Council dealt with complaints of vandalism to ::;eve1·al fraternity houses during home- coming weekeHd at its meeting on Tuesday night. Inci- dents ranging in severity from college pranks to overt acts of brutal aggression were recorded by most houses at various times last weekend. Complaints, descriptions, th1·eats and allegations flew so freely about Hale House Lounge that President Casey had to restore order to the group on more than one occa- sion. After enllecting, examining and sifting all available evidence, the HPC concluded that with a few exceptions, Schenectady nmdais were to ulame. The few relatively unimportant exceptions involved students from other col- leges. In several cases, the Police Department of the City of Schenectady was summoned, but failed to respond. Complaints ranged from petty thievery to disturbing the peace and ass:mlt ancl battery. On one occasion, an under- graduate had to be hospitalized when he was sprayed in the face with toxic carbon tetrachloride. Campus police could not be located and the City Police were called. Again they failed to respond. The {'oncordiensis bat:ks those house presidents who complained about the failure of the City poloice to come when called for assistance in these instances when pl'OP- erty was in danger and physical injury imminent. As one of the complainants pointed out, the fraternities are as~ sessed and pay taxes to the city (through the college ad- ministration) and should therefore feel justified in ex- pecting the same police protection as any other taxpayer, be he shopkeeper or college student. City police are not in any way restricted or discouraged feom entering Union's campus in the line of duty. The Concordiensis feels that there is partial j ustifica- tion for the failure of the Schenectady Police Department to respond to calls for assistance from campus last week- end. Familiar as they are with the twisted wit of the college student bent on a hedonistic homecoming, a cer- tain amount of doubt must have lurked within theil· minds regarding assistance calls from the campus. It was a case of crying \Wolf\ too often. Happily, no Union undergTaduates were found to be responsible for any vandalistic acts. This indicates a cer- tain maturity and a respect for our scholarly environment which was conspicuously lacking during the scandalous Fall Prom Weekend of 1957, called by Dean Huntley the most destructive weekend in Union's history. Union un- dergraduates were almost entirel·y responsible for the damage done on that weekend. Among the better suggestions to prevent future re- occurances which were offered by the HPC was one recom- mending that houses employ campus police, city police or private detectives during the big party weekends, particu- larly between the hours of midnight to four A.M. Though this has been done in the past by some houses, it often resulted in antagonism by other houses. Also, the presence of a guard often defeated his own pur- pose as vandals would wait until he left to concentrate re~ taliatory efforts on the fraternity. The Concordiensis sug- gests that a satisfactory solution might be to hire a pri- vate detective to remain at the houses until very early in the morning, avoiding any resentment that the presence of a campus or city policeman might impart. If such a practice were widespread no antagonism would result. A nationally known detective bureau with an office in this area is prepared to hire out guards for $2.25 an hour. The most constructive suggestion made w.as one by President Walt Casey, who asked the House Presidents to explain the necessity for such precautions to the member- ship of their fraternities, so that bad feeling, might be avoided in the future. Also at his suggestion, the Council agreed to handle any interfraternity squabbles exclusively through the presidents of the houses concerned. The Con• cordiensis feels that this is one of the wisest steps taken at Union toward better fraternity cooperation in many years. We commend President 'Casey for his handling of this matter, and we feel that Union may well be at the threshold of an \era of good feeling\ among fraternities. Honesty and the Student We ·would like to call special attention to the front- page article, \Honesty and the Student,\ which inaugur- ates a Concordy series dealing with the problems faced by the college concerning the establishment of an academic honor system. That a working honor system would be of great benefit to the campus with establishing such a sys- tem are immense. At their recent Retreat, the faculty expressed keen interest in the feasibility of installing an honor system :fo1· students. Both pro and con opinions were voiced by the faculty concerning the actual _)¥orkability of such a s.ystem. In the course of the Concordy series :many of these views will be aired, and it is hoped that the reader will be presented with a thorough ]}icture of tlte problem of student honesty on the Union campps. Art Decorates Fraternity By Ralph PalasE-k 'r'hut new lool\ in the living room of the Phi Sigma Delta house is the result of President Art Jude!\ solm's idea to !'alse the cultural standards of the house by the subtlP mE.ans of ']J!'esenting tht> brothers with an art gallery. A long-time fr·iend of the Phi Sig's, Nicola Squillaci, offered to rent certain paintings from :his gallery nt 524 Summit Av:e., for the dura- tion of one month. For this ser- vice.

Yet the v.ould-be tedium · is appre- h~nded by drifting clouds of even- ing, intervening between village and summit. We .feel that this is one of the finest pieces of 17th century Oricntalism. Thr: Paintings represent a fine idea on the part of President Ju- delsonn, and we hope to see an interest taken in them, !'..S we'll as a .further development on the part of the rest of the campus along these lines. ---o,--- Lette1· to the Editor •ro the Editor of Concordiensis: -Gazette Photo by Sid Brown The Concordiensis, in their last Pictured above ·is one of flbe issue, prmted an editorial advo- many works of art which pres- eating the HPC to make a. \jump entl,y adorn the Jiving room of to a 100% Cooperative Bidding the Phi Sigma.

He thought of the beer. \I will have the Schaefer now. The beer/~ Teresa brought it to him. \What do you hear in the best of circles?\ she asked. \Schaefer all around!\ he said. It was a little ritual they had between them. It was a very good ritual. She watched him drink:la cerveza, rea.l- the real beer. uHow goes it?\ she said. She was blushing. \It goes well.

I know about student dishonesty only if it comes to my attention in. the form of a copied paper. Tll.e pre- pared crib brought to the examin- ation and the a.!lllwer copied from the next man are not generally a problem in the Department of English, since we give exams in which this kind of cheating is just not usefut Lru!t spring, how- ever, a number of long papers prepared outside of class and lifted word for 'Word from maga- zine articles showed up in some of the ·English courses. They were dealt with by the department and were not referred to tll.e Dis- cipline Committee. What con- cerns the Department now is how to prevent such cheating in the future. Some students when caught plead ignorance, saying they did not know this kind of copying is wrong. Although this seems to us a dubious plea, we at- tempt to mE'et it by circulating to freE<hmen a pamphlet discussing plaga.rism and setting down the principles of literary ethics. When he has read it, each mart signs a statement that he has. understood the pamphlet, and this statement is sent to the Dean's office, where it is presumably filed. This rou- tine -procedure leaves untouched the problem of dishonesty by iii- tent and necessarily does little to provide the sound moral climate in which alone an honor syatem can flourish.

Diogenes' Dilemma The problem which has been the subject of most urgent concern on the campus this ye_ar has been that of the almost decedant state of student mtelleciual and per- sonal honesty. Two articles appearing- in the Corcordiensis this week reflect on varied implications of the lack of stu- dent honesty at Union. Dr. Carl Niemeyer comments this week on cases of unde1·graduate cheating and plagiarism within the realm of the English Department, and the ac- count of the recent Student Council meeting refers to the problem of stealing in the bool{store, ·which is to be in- vestigated by the Council. These diverse examples of student dishonesty serve to point eut quite vividly the seriousness of the situation. Dissatisfaction with the level of student honesty has long existed amon()'st faculty members and honest students. However, until this year the concern manifested itself in latent grumblings; it has now finally erupted. An ideal solution to the problem of course exists. A student initiated, student administered Honor System has been proved successful in maJ?Y c~lleges \a~o~g them Dean Pollock's Alma .;\later, Umvers1ty of Vll'gm1a.) But as with most perfect solutions, it remains the most diffi- cult one to realize. Only a conscientious and determined effort on the part of every student can make a successful Honor System feasible.

This also enables USNSA to enter into joint .sp<msorship of worthwhile prejects with other groups which have similar concerns and ·objec- tives. Post-War Crisis The World .University Service f.irst began its work in 1920 when, in the midst of the rubble and ruin of Europe, European Stu- dent Relief (ElSR) was founded to meet the critical material needs of the university students after the first World War. Although the most important work of msR was completed by 1925, there re.,. mained a desire to maintain con- tact, exchange ideas and experi- ence, and to work to meet prob- lems and long-term needs of the university community. Thus, out of ESR emerged an independent international organization which, after a magnificent rehabilitation job in Europe and Asia following World War II, in 1950 became known as World University Serv- ice (Wl)SJ. Since then, the main emphasis has been increasingly turned toward solving basic prob- lems in Southeast Asia, the Far East and the Middle East, even though there are- many other Under the sponsocrship. ·Gf B!nai B'rith CHiHel Foundation, the N.a-. tiona:l.

One of the major undertakings of VVUS has been its Hungarian Progra;m whereby some $1.3 miJ-.

A Night To Remember The decision of the Board of Trustees to make Rich- mond Dormitory into an upperclass residence with social and recreational facilities for independents is a both wel- come and promising gesture. It comes after years of agita- tion by student groups and the Conco1·diensis. Most impor- tant is the admission of the Trustees that Union has are- sponsibility to provide adequate housing and social facil- ities for those students that are not absorbed into the fra- ternity system. The decision to renovate South College is equally worthy of praise. The living conditions in this 145 year old building are barely tolerable. Here too, lack of social facilities has been sorely missed by independent dormitory residents. Especially laudable was President Davidson's comment that Richmond Dormitory may be developed along the lines of a Student Union. The need for a Student Union on this campus has long been a topic of discussion among respon- sible student leaders. The Student Council has made praise- worthy, if spo1·adiC', steps in this direction. The postponed appearance of adequate housing and social facilities for independents does m>t completely dis- chal·ge the Collcg·e':; ouligatiun to the students who are not members of the fraternity system of which the College is so proud . .As eommendable as the new d0l'll1itory plans are, they arc only the first steps in the emancipation of the independent. The next step is a revision of the archaic dormitory social rules. The pre~ent social rules are as unrealistic as they are unenforceable. In an editorial written last year on the occasion of the appointment of Dran 0. Edward Pollock, entitled \Great Expectations,\ the C'oncordiensis C'alled the pt·oblem of dormitot·y social rule revision \paramount\ among those problems which would fall within the realm of the Dean of Students. At this moment we feel the time is ripe for action; with an organized effort on the part of the Stu- dent Council, \Great Expectations\ may well become \A Night To Remember.\ The Green Panacea Once again the inevitaule has occurred as the Trustees have struck with their annual tuition increase. Far from coming as a surprise to the campus, it has come to be an expected event as easily anticipated as the annual rise in the cost-of-living index. The modern college student must either become rapidly conditioned to the fact that his tui- tion bills as a senior will only vaguely resemble those of his freshman df-ys, or he will become victim to the infla- tion nem·osis. · Although slightly discouraging to student morale, the tuition raise must be considered justified. Those students who are bent to complain should be reminded that even with the increase, their tuition payment covers barely two- thirds the cost of their education. The most encouraging factor of the tuition rise is that only liberal arts students were affected. It appears that the Trustees have finally come to the conclusion that a Liberal Arts education at Union is worth as much as the Engineering variety. Cast Your Ballot On The British. El~ctioas The Faculty Outlook By Richard N. W. Smith This is tile second and final installment by Professor Richard N. W. Smith in which ihc expresses his views on the British cleetioillS. PJ•ofcss·()r Smith is visiting Assist- ant Pr()fessor of PhiLosophy from St. Andrews University in Soot- land. In my previous article, I re- marked that in Scotland the trend of the voting had been different from what it was in England. In the last Parliament, Labour held 35 seats in Scotland, and the Con- servatives 34. One seat was held by a Liberal, and one by an Inde- pendent. On October 8th, Labour lost seat to the Conservatives, but won four. The final position, thet·efore, was that Labour in- creased their total of seats in Scotland to 38, while the Conserv- ative total dropped to 31. The two seats held :by the Liberal and Independent were retained by them. A partial explanation of La- bour's success might be that Scot- land has ·a higher rate of -unem- ployment than England. But there is fairly general prosperity, and unemployment is not likely to have been a major issue. Co- lonial policy, particularly as it has affected Nyasaland, has also been ·g-iving rise in Scotland to some dissatk;faction with the Macmillan Government: but not in the areas where Labour made their chief gains. and not among those who might be expected to make up the voting strength of Labour. Politica.I Attitudes Y ary I ar.1 inclined to look for a rathet different type of explana- 1ion of the discrepancy ·between Scottish and English political att:- tudes. One .of the Tory slogans, even before this eiection, has teen tnat Britain should become a \property-owning democracy\; and it has often been remarked that tht> British worldng classes, when they have made a little money, :begin to adopt middle-class dress, middle-class habits, and ry~n a middle~class outlook on life. Th~ descendants of .Socialist stalwart..o, living in the age of washing-machines and television take on a Conservative coloring: and may even begin lo vote Con- ·servative. This change of man- ners is closely connected with thE' deep and inborn respect which the ~nglish have for rank and posi- tion, and for the established order of society. Wb.at has happened In recent years is that a whole mass of people have been enabled to identify themselYes with a cet·- Winne Expounds tain idea: and that ideal is the old English ideal of an ordered society of differing layers, from the Queen down, but· in which it is easier than ever before for an able man to rise to any position that his talents fit him to occupy. The English working man, par- ticmlarly in the southern half of England, secretly aspires to be a bourgeois. He is also someth-ing of a snob ; and, if it cannot quite be said that he dearly loves a lm·d, it is at least truE' that he has no wish to be a member of a c.Jassless society. ScOtts are :Pl'tOls But th-is is not true of his Scot- tish counterpart. The people o.f inclustria! Scotland are unasham- edly proletarian. They do not ad- mire the man who seeks to turn himself Into a capitalist. And they have no natural respect for authority. Equality is more pre- cious to them, than other political virtues. The working people of Scotland do not share the aspira- tioru;, to which the Conservative pro,gramme is designed to appeal. There are class distinctions in Scotland, of course; but the ma- jority of the population are very ill content with this state of things, and would like to see them go. Anq many of those Scots, whose circumsta.nces are not pro- letarian, do not live in the indus- trial areas, and do not understand or sympathize with those who do. It might even be said of them Ula t they understand the English better than they do their own countrymen, and that they are more at home in English society, or .society organized on the Eng- lish. pattern, than in that of the majority of their own .people. These Scots have mostly been e-ducated in England, either Wholly or in pal't. There are sev- era.l of them in the Macmillan Government, though not so many as before the election. E:ven in the country districts of Scotland, where there has al- ways .been a laird,. there has not been the conscious approval of class distinction, which has 7narked the rel~tiO!l$ between the English countryman and the squire. ·The Scots do not believe in the superiority of landed des- cent. Indeed, there was not such a well-marked difference between the laird and his tenants. And where industry is establiBhed there is a deliberate rejection of the idea that society should be (Continued on Page 6) Honesty and the Stud·ent By William Winne The mock political ballot to be held next Tuesday, November 3, is another attempt on the part of a few dedi- cated students to expand the scope of the Union man be- yond his beautiful 100 acre domain. For when the Union man tallies his assets, political awareness does not usually number among them. A ballot of the type offered by the Political Forum will help test how aware the student is of events occurring outside the rather shelteTed atmos- phere of the college campus.

Enzer Last Saturday we had the op- portunity to visit the new Gug- genheim Museum· at 88th Street and Fi·fth Avenue in New York. It is tlie only maj<;>r work .by the late Frank Lloyd Wright in New York, and as far as we are con- cerned, it is a fitting, in fact, magnificent tribute to the man's genius. T-he structure is not at all like anything else in New York, ·but to suggest that the Guggenheim does not belong is a;bsurd? Wright's creation .belongs to this moment in time. The use of rein- forced conorete is but one exam- ple of Wright's awareness of the new materials a;nd techniqu·es which were at his. disposal in the construction of a museum to house the art of our era. It is not a building which fillst had a frame erected and then the bal- ance of the structure \filled in.\ The whole is one continuous unity, and this was the g<ml that Wright had in mind. Spiral Ra.m,p Inside The ifiterior o.f the Guggenheim is a large spiral ramp ascending to the equivalent of a fifth floor, and the paintings are hung along this ramp. On the lower spirals the paintings a1•e flus)l to the wall, but as one follows the gt•ad- ual s!o,pe upwards, the paintings are projected frorn the wall by steel supports creating the illusion of suspension. in .space. The re- sult is stun.ning, The viewer's attention is captivated by the painting test_ing in space before him. The low ceilings and slight partioning further 4Joncentrate the eye towards the painting. The wall of the museum is no longer a mere hanging place, it is a mov- ing background which, far from detracUng from the attention given to the -art work, continu- ally leaps the eye to. further ex- plorations. The museum is no made available for those who would !i·ke to sit and rest a while. But Mr. Sweeney has chosen,. at least for the pres{llit, to pl!j.ce various works of ·sculptm'e on the terrazzo floor. A Majpr Controversy The Gugg-enheim has caused a genuine controversy in the art world. The major objection to the .new museum is that Wright's building so greatly dominates the paintings that a viewer spends his time looking at the imposing ar-chitecture and not at the works. The fallacy here is· that the build- ing itself is a work of art and that its function is to 'create al1 atmosphere conducive to the aesthic experience. The reason :for the one continuous ramp is that it eliminates the catacomb effect •of several ·rectangular rooms whicEt, acco1>d'in,g to Wright and to empirical findings, tend to confuse the vie-wer as he wan- del's from area to area. The spiral ramp leads the .spectator from ·painting to painting, with no abrupt shifts or changes. which would divert his attention. The whole idea is to create an organic relationship among the works of art, the art enthusiast and the practical problem of seeing ·the exhibit. Wright's Guggenheim Museum accomplishes this as no other -museum !has in our experi- ence, and this includes the major museums of the eastern United States, France, Italy and Eng- land. T·he Guggenheim, as any othel' work of al't, must •be experienced \in the flesh\ in order to be truly appreciated. This is one of the most significant architectm,ai ac- complishments of our age, and as such we should endeavor to see the museum and attempt to vis- ualize it in terms of this day in longer separate from its exhibit, L G BALfOUR for the paintings, spiral ramp, •: 1 · · · · · · 00. - the whole structure become uni- CA 1 R· :L SO'REN'SEN fied into a total caesthetic ex- perience.

It comes after years of agita- tion by student groups and the Concordiensis. l\Iost bnpor- tant is the admission of the Trustees that Union has a l'e- sponsibilit~· to provide adequate housing and social facil- ities for those students that are not absorbed into th.e fra- temity system. The decision to renovate South College is equally \VOl'thy of pmise. The living conditions in this 1-15 year ole! building- are barely tolerable. Here too, lack of social facilities has been sorely missed by independent dormitory residents. Especially laudable was President Davidson's comment that Richmond Dormitory may be deYe!oped along the lines of a Student l'nion. The need for a Student Union on this campus has long· been a topic of discussion among respon- sible student leaders. The Student Council has made praise- worth~·. if sporadic. steps in this direction. The postponed appearanl'e of adequate housing and social facilitiL's fot· independent:; Lloe::> not c:umpletely dis- duu·ge the College· s oulig-atiun to the sluden L; who are not memben; of the fraternitr system of which the College is so proud .• -\s cumnwndahle as the new dormitot·y plans are, they are onl~· the fi1·~t stl'ps in the emancipation of the independent. The next step is a revision of the archaic dormitory social wlrs. Thl' pn'srnt socinl rules are a:; unrealistic: as thev are unenforceable. \ In an editorial written last year on the occasion of the appointmrnt of PPan 0. Edward Pollocl\, entitled \Great Expectations,\ the Concordiensis <:all eel the pt·oblem of dormitory social 1ule revision \pammount\ among those problems which wonlfl fall \Vithin the realm of the Dl'an of Students. At this moment we feel the time is ripe for action; with an organized effort on the part of the Stu- dent Council. \Great. Expectations\ may well Lecome \A Night To Remember.\ The Green Panacea Once again the inevitalJle has ocCUlTed as the Trustees have stt·uck \\\ith their annual tuition increase. Far from coming as a surprise to the campus, it has come to be an expected event as easily anticipated as the annual rise in the cost-of-living· index. The modern college student must either become rapidly conclitioned to the fact that his tui- tion bills as a ~eni01· will only vaguely resemble those of his freshman d~ys, or he will become victim to the infla- tion neuresis. Although slightly discouraging to student morale, the tuition raise must be considered justified. Those students who are bent to complain should be reminded that even with the increase, their tuition payment covers barely two- thirds the cost of their education. The most encomag-ing factor of the tuition rise is that only Iibera.! arts students were affected. It appears that the T1·ustees have finally come to the conclusion that a Liberal A1·ts education at Union is worth as much as the Engineering variety. Cast Your Ballot ~T\IP!t.NT •- ...

University in S<lot- land~ In my p1·evious article, I re- marked .that in Scotland the trend of tile voting ·had been different from what it 1va.s in England. In the last Pa·r]ia;_'>Uent, Labour held 35 seats in S<!otland, and the Con- servatives 34-. One seat was 'held hy a Liberal, and one by an Inde- pendent. On. October 8th, Labour lost seat to t:he Conservatives, but won foUcr. The final position. therefore, was that Labour in- crea•ed their total of seats in Scotland to 3-8, while the Conserv- ative total drt>pped to 31. The two scats held by t'hc Liberal and Independent \\.\ere retained by them. A partial ex:planation of La· bour's success tnight be that Scot- Lind ha,.; a l~igbc1· rate of uncn'l- ployment than England. But there is fairl:y general prosperity, and unempl()ymen t is not likely to have been a major i,;sue. Co- lonial policy, particularly as it has a-ffected N:yasaland, has also been givin~ rise i.n Scotland to some dis«atbfaelion with the Macmillan Go\'et·nment: but not in the areas whete Laboar matle their chief gains. and not among those Vl'ho might be expected to make up the voting str·eng;th of Labour. Political A-ttitu<lt•, Yary I am incline,d to look for a rathe1 different. type of explana- tion of the dis-crepancy betlv·cen Scottish and English political att~­ tudcs. ~ne of the Tory slog-an.-., even befor·e this election, has ~eon t:lnt Bl'it:l.in should become a \prof'~! ty-owning democracy\: and it has ·)·ften been remarked th,-.t thl' B-rit.ish. worlting classes, \\\lHm the~r have made a little money, begin to adopt middle-class dress, midrl!.c-class ha·Nts, and rwn a middle-class out.Iook on lik The dcs<!endants of Socialist stalwart..~, liv-ing in the age of washing-macbin€s and -television talu> on a Conservative colorjl)g: and may even begin to vote Con- servative:. T':his change of man- ners is closely connected with the deep and inborn respect which the ~nglish ha.ve for I'ank and posi- tion, and fo1· the established order of c;cciety. \What has happened in recent years is that a whole mass Of people have been enabled to identify tbem.seh-es with a cer- Winne Expounds tain idea: and that ideal is the old English ideal of an ordered society of differing Jayers, from the Queen do~, but in which it i,: easier than ever b-~fore for au a·hle mall to rise to ~n:y positien that his talents fit him to occt!py. The English working :man, par- ticularly in the southfrrn ha):f of England, secretly asp.ires to be a bourgeois. He is also() something of a snob : and, if it c::axmot quite be said that he de~:uly loves a lord, it is at least -t:me t-hat he has no wish to be a rnember of a classless society. &c.ts are l'r;uls But this is not true of his Scot- tish counterpart. Th-E people of industrial Scotland are unasham- edly proletarian. They do not ad- mire the man who seeks to turn himself into a capitalist. And they have no natural respect for authority. Equality is more pre· cious to them, than otlier political virtues. The working ]leople of Scotland do nC>t share the aspira- tiong, to which the Conservative programme is designed tC> appeal. There are class distinctions in Scotland, of course; but the ma- jority of the population are very ill content with thi:s state of things, and would like to see them g-o. And many o.f t liose Scots, whose circumstances a;·e not pro- letarian, do not live in the indus- trial areas, and do not understand or sympathize \vilh th<Jse who do. It might even be srld of them that they understand \the English better than they do their own countrymen, and tha.i they are more at home in Englllsll society, or society organized 01n the Eng- lish pattern, than in that of the majority of their- o-wn people. These Scots have nostly been educated in Engla:nd, either Wholly or in par-t. There are sev- eral of them in the Macmillan Government, th()ugh not so many as before the election; Even In the count:ry districts of Scotland, where tlure has al- ways been a laird, there has not been the conscious approval of class distinction, vvhich has marked the relatiq·ns between the English countryman and the squire. The Scots do not believe in the superiority of ]anded des- cent. Indeed, there was not such a well-marked differelllce between the laird and his tenants. .And where industry is ~stablished there is a deliberate rejection of the idea that society sliould be (Continued on Page 6) Honesty and the Student By William Winne The mock political ballot to be held next Tuesday, November 3, is another attempt on the part of a few dedi- cated students to expand the scope of the Union man be- yond his beautiful 100 acre domain. For when the Union man tallies his assets, political awareness does not usually number among them. A ballot of the type offered by the Political Forum will help test how aware the student is of events occurring outside the rather sheltered atmos- phere of the college campus. The foll011vmg article, by Pro- fessor Willimu Winne, is a.notller m the Concol'die:nsis series, \]{()n- esty and the Stmdent.\ Next week Professor .James Moss will dis- cuss the feasibili-ty of establishing an Ho-nor S;yste:m at Uni<>n Col- lege. It is hoped that before voting the student will make an effort to become well acquainted with the issues, a task which is his responsibility as a voter. In addition it is hoped that the results of the voting on \Resolutions Con- cerning the Campus Community\ will reflect the opinions of the large majority of the student body on these issues. Thus the results of the ballot can only be useful if (1) the students take time to cast their ballot and (2) the students maim an effort to examine the issues they are voting on carefully.

Enzer Last Saturday we had the op- portunity to visit the new Gug- genheim Museum at 88th Street and Fifth Avenue in New York It is the only major work by the late Franlt Lloyd Wright in New York, and as far as we al'e cen- cerned, it is a fitting, in fact, magnificent tribute to the man's genius. The stJ,ucture is not at all like anythiug else in New York, but to suggest that the Guggenheim does not bel0ng is a;bsurd? Wright's crea:tion .belongs to this moment in time. '1'he use of rein· forced co rrcr.ete is but one exam- ple of W1•.Jght's awareness of the new materials and techniques which we1'e at his disposal in the construction of a museum to house the art of our era. It is not a buildi-ng which first had a frame e1'ected and' then the bal• ance o'f the structure \fiUed in.\ The whol'e is one continuous unity, and this was the goal that Wright had ·in mind. Spi.Fa! &mp Inside The interior o.f the Guggenheim is a -large spiral· ramp ascending to the equiva.)ent of a fifth fleor, and .the peJntings are hung along this ramp, 011 the lower spirals the paintings are· flush to the wall, ·but as one follows the grad- ual slo.pe upwards, the paintings are .projected from the wall by steel supports creating the illusion of suspension in space. The re- sult is stunning. The viewer's attention is captivated by the painting :vesting in space ·before him. The low ceilings and slight partioning further concentrate the eye -towards the painting. The wall of the museum is no longer a mere hanging place, it is a mov- ing background which, far from detracting from the attention given to the art werk, continu- ally leads the eye to further ex- plorations. The museum is no made available for these who would l-ike to sit and rest a while. But Mr. Sweeney has chosen, at least for the present, to place various w0rks of sculpture on the terrazzo floor. A Maj9r Controversy The G'uggenheim has caused a genuine controversy in the art world. The major objection to the new museum is that Wright's buHd-ing so greatly dominates the paintings that a viewer spends his time looking at the imposing architecture and not at the works. The fal'lacy here is that the build- ing i'tself is a work of art and that i-ts functi0n is to create an atmosphere conducive to the aesthic experience. The reason for the one continuous ramp is that it eliminates the catac0mb effect ·of seVeral ~ectangular rooms which, according to Wright and to empi-rical find-ings, tend to confuse the viewer as he wan- del'S from are:;t to area. 'The spiral ramp leads !he spectator frem painting to painting, with no abrupt shifts or changes which would divert his attention. The whole idea is to create an organic relationship among the works of art, the art enthusiast and the practical problem of seeing the exhibit. Wright's Guggenheim Museum accomplishes this as no other ·museum has in our experi- ence, and this includes the major museums of the eastern United States, France, Italy and Eng- land. 'l'he Guggenheim, as any other work of art, must be experienced \in the flesh\ in order to be truly appreciated. This is one of the most significant a:rchitectural ac- complishments of our age, and as such we should endeavor to see the museum and attempt to vis- ualize it in terms of this day in longer sepa:rate from its exhibit, L G BAlfOUR for the paintings, spiral ramp, a .. z · : OOa the whole structure become uni- fied into a total caesthetic ex- CA'RL SO'RENSEN perience.

The aims of this election are: 1) to discover the sympathies of the student body regarding presi- dential candidates; 2) to have stu- dents express their choice for Schenectady's Mayor and Council- men; 3) to find out if the students are even aware of the election about to occur and have any knowledge of tpe candidates run- ning; 4) .to give student hody of Union College the opportunity to vote on proposed amendments to the New York State Constitution which would affect the body in various ways; 5) to give the stu- dent the opportunity to serve the College Community by expressing his opinion on controversial cam- pus topics. Amendments Included Two amendments to the New York State Constitution will be voted on by the student body. The first of these amendments is the so-called Northway Amendment. This deals with the use made ef state lands designated as forest preserve. This proposed a=end- ment would permit not more than three hundred acres of state for- est preserve landS to :be used for the construction and maintenance of an interstate highway (the so- called Northway) from a point in the vicinity of Glens Falls to the vicinity Of Keensville and Plattsburg. The amendment also limits the number of ski trails that may be built on state owned lands in the Adirondacks. The second proposed amendment deals with the testimony of public offi- cers. Its purpose is .to provide that any public officer who, wh~n called before a grand jury to testi- fy concerning the conduct of his oi\ficial duties in any public office held by him within the preceeding years, refuses to. sign a waiver of immunity against subsequent The ballot contains three resolu- tions concerning the college com- munity. The first resolution deals with the adherence of the College to the National Defense Educa- tion Act. This act provides $295 million in federal tuition loans at an extremely low rate of interest to undergraduate students and outright grants to graduate stu- dents. The controversial :part of this Jaw states, \No :part of any funds appropriated . . . shall b8 used to make payments or !trans to any individual unless such in- dividual has executed and filed with the Commissioner an affi- davit that he does not believe in . and is not a member of and does not support any organization that believes in or teaches the over- throw of the United States Gov- ernment by force or violence .or by illegal or unconstitutional methods ... \ Last February the Union College faculty unani- mously disapproved of the \anti- subversive\ affidavit requirement.

Zigman is an Accounting Man· ager for Wisconsin ~ell Telephone Com· pany in Oshkosh-with seven supervisory and 93 clerical employees reporting to him. His group handles billing for 350,· 000 telephone customers and processes $1,500,000 in revenue each month. Don has moved ahead fast-and stead- ily-but no more so than the Bell System interviewer told him he might. \That guy made a real impression on me,\ says Don. \He didn't guarantee a bright future for me. He simply described the kind of varied job experience I'd get, outlined the on-the-job training I'd go through, and pointed out the adva11ce· ment opportunities I'd have along the way. The only thing he promised me was that I would have 'maximum exposure for self-development.' He was 100 per cent right there. My training has been terrific-and I've had every chance to ad- vance that I could possibly hope fm.\ After joining the company, Don spent eight months in the Plant Department learning the roots of the business. He got experience as a lineman, installer and repairman. He was transferred to Ac· counting in December, 1956, working in the Methods and Results section. Thir· teen months later, he was Supervisor o£ that section-and, 14 months after that, he became Accounting Manager. \How much fa1ther I go now is entirely up to me,\ says Don. \One thing I kn<JW: the opportunities are here.\ Don Zigman graduated with a B.A. degree in Economics and English.

Tackle George Thom.pson .proved immove- able as did his line mates Bill Clinger, Norm Lavery, Bob Car- ter, Carl Valentine, Chuck Hanle, Bill Marx and Dixie Bergman. ·T.hompson plugged his side of the line so effectively that he forced Hobart to run to the other side. Needless to say, they were stopped successfully here also_ Such superb line play fot·ced the Statesmen to the air on more than one occasion. Here the backfield of the Garnet defense went to work. Led by Jim Erceg and Tom Pike, they knocked down nine of the twelve passes thrown and allowed only 29 yards gained, Coach Doyle stated earlier in the year, during practice sessions; \Seventy percent of the passes should be yoUl'S (the safety man's).\ By more than carrying out this order Hobart was pinned doW'n most of the afternoon. If Union's offensive game had matched the defensive game, they surely would have gotten the th!'ee TD's that were missed by the slightest of margins. Team Unveils iPla,y In the closing minutes of the first quarter Brad Arthur and company unveiled a play that nearly went for a touchdown. Pike who took a pitchout from Arthur, after a fake to the full- back, ran to the outside, spotted end Carl Valentine, foot loose and fancy free, running down the op- posite sideline and flipped a pass good for 48 yards and a first down on the Statesmen four yard line_ Hobart's line, not to be out- done, held on four straight plays and smothered the Dutchmen's opportunity for a claim to .fame. In the closing minutes of the game Arthur came off the bench and innovated a pass play from punt formation. Before the sur- prised Genevans could recover he had completed a 16 yard pass to Lavery. The final gun sounded during these last ditch efforts and thwarted another possible TD. Garnet passers completed 7 of 14 passes and gained 7{) yards via the air.

Pilfering could be reduced, Mrs. Hill said, by the use of saleslips or turnstiles, but, she said, the first solution would take too much time, especially during the first few days of each semester, and the instaliation of turnstiles would ruin the appearance of the store. Mrs. Hill, who has met most of the present students while work- ing in the admissions office, fe~ls that \nearly all of them are mce boys, it's just that a few of them don't realize what they are do· ing.\ On the question of profits, Mrs. Hill said that she cannot lowe1 the prices on books because the:; are fair traded b:; the publishers and said that she dot•s not know how other college bookstores arc able to get around this.
