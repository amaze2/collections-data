QU .. t\RTZ CRYSTALS How a 1 1 /4 hour· ~~gem-cutting\ operation became an 8-minute .mechanized job PROBLEM: Preparing quartz crystals for use as electronic frequency controls calls for the highest degree of precision. So much so, in fact, that prior to World War II skilled gem-cutters were employed to do the job. But during the war, there were not enough gem-cutters to keep up with the demanti for crystals in radar, military communications and other applications. Western Electric tackled the job of building into machines the skill and precision that had previously called for the most highly skilled operators. SOLUTION: Here is how quartz crystals are made now-by semi-skilled labor in a fraction of the time formerly required: A quartz stone is sliced into wafers on a reciprocating diamond-edged saw, after determination of optical and elec- trical axes by means of an oil bath and an X-ray machine. Hairline accuracy is assured by an orienting fixture. - 1i. The wafers are cut mto rectangles on machines equipped with diamond saws. The human element is practically elim- inated by means of adjustable stops and other semi-automatic features. The quart?; rectangles are lapped automatically to a thickness tolerance ofplusorminus .0001\. A timer prevents overlapping. Finally, edges are groWld to specific length and width 'dimensions on machines with fully automatic micro- feed systems. Most of these machines were either completely or largely designed and Q.e- veloped by Western Electric engineers. RESULTS: With skill built into the machines-With costly hand operations eliminated-this Western Electric mech- anization program raised production of quartz crystals 'from a few thousand a year to nearly a million a month during the war years. This is just one of the many i.musual jobs undertaken and solved by Western Electric engineers. Quartz stones are •Cut into wafers on this dia- mond-edged saw, with orientation to optical axis controlled by fixture. This is just one of several types of machines designed and devel- oped by Western Electric engineer.s to mecha- nize quartz cutting. ~ A Ulll/1 Of THE.BELL SYSTEM SINCE 111112 Manufacturing plcinfs ·in ·Chicago,.

It's rumored that Mr. Bell invented the phone as an inexpensive way for college boys and girls to talk over such points of common interest as mathematics and moonlight at long distances. NaQJ.raJiy, this spirit still prevails today, and that's why you'll find that thr Long Distance bargain rates which go into ef- f<'ct after six p.m. evenings and all day Stu1day are tailored for the never-too-full wallet. You know, even Chloe might have answered if her date had had enough sense to use the phone.
