Assistant Circulation Manager Mountebanks Are a Symptom The passing of the Mountebanks last week was greeted with mixerl emotions. The consensus of opinion appears to be that the1·e should be an active theatre group on campus and that the1·e is something radically wrong with the Mountebanks to permit it to fade away. It's ou·r feeling that the entire Mountebanks affair is a symptom, not a disease. Few people realize that other activities are going through the same stages that preceded the death of our thea- tre group. \\'H CC, one of the proudest arrd most outstanding activity achievements at Union has been forced to curtail its b1·oadcas1.ing time because of lack of participation. The Concordiensis manages to appear every Friday evening, but mainly because a few people do practically all the work. :Oiany of the ::;o-called unrestricted activities find difficulty in getting membe1·s to uttend monthly meetings. The \Doctor\ Was Wrong! The Concol'diensis summed up the situation last year by attributing the decline of activities to apathy stemming from the uncertain draft situation. That diagnosis doesn't appear to be sufficient at this time. If all the activities on this campus were to fold up, there would be plenty of protests from the student body. Perhaps we're outgrowing the need for activities. Presi- dent Robert Hutchins of the University of Chicago takes a dim view of their need in college, claiming that the student is there for academic purposes. Hutchins may be right; he is certainly correct in asserting that the main function of a college is academic. Nevertheless, the Hutchins viewpoint is not shared by the majority of educators and students. Then, if activities are wanted, why aren't they flourish- ing? On many other campuses, the top editors of the news- paper and the radio station manager are' paid for their work. That may be a paTtial explanation for the decline in participa- tion in those activities. Still\ that doesn't appear to be the answer. What is missing at Union is a healthy, wholesome aware- ness of the benefits of small college life and a genuine college spirit. College spirit doesn't have to mean inane cheering at sports events,. but it must mean an interest in doing all one can for the betterment of the college. The small institu- tion offers many more chances for a student to take a sig- nificant part in some phase of college life outside the class room. We'll admit that the class room is the more essential aspect of higher education, but it doesn't have to mean the complete exclusion of evetything else. Activities Prescribed The age period that we find ourselves in during our col- lege career is one of intellectual and emotional maturation. It's a period when we begin to find ourselves and develop new interests and intensify old ones. The class room goes ~ long ways to fostering this growth, but student activities supplement that work. The student will deprive himself of a great opportunity by not helping himself and his college. This .college spirit entails a responsibility of community living. Part of student life, of course, takes the form of a bull session over a bottle of beer and evening in Saratoga. That shouldn't be excluded, but neither sllould it grow out of pro- portion. No aspect of college life should grow out of propor- tion, but they should all be fitted into their place. We're protesting that student activities and college spirit have been sadly neglected. lf the students want their activities to continue, they must pump some life ~into them. Either that or they should be forgotten entirely. A half hearted attitude benefit8 no one. D. E. S. Hail· and Farewell The editorship of the Condordiensis changed hands this week as Jay Cohn resigned, after eleven months a.nd twenty issues at the helm. The editor .of a college newspaper is only app;eeiated by the people who work under him, for the list of his achieve- ments is generally prosaic. The day to day routine of putting· a newpaper to bed doesn't make exciting reading and that's probably the only reason why editors don't customarily ~Uite editorials about fellow editol·s. · Jay was the first non-vetemn editor of the Conc01'diensis of the post ... war era.· Without the benefit of experience that was endowed upon George Orick, Jim Murray, and Wolfgang Reimer, the Rogues Gallery since 19\48 he gave thE Concordy a stability of leadership that future editors can only hope to possess.' During on.e of the hottest campus issues in years, last year's Council presidential squabble, Jay made every possible effort to present the facts and the issues objectively. Since everyone carried his own prejudices into. that cam- paign, there were those who criticized Jay for both starting the dispute and for making· it sensational. We WQO worlced beside him at that time know how false these charges wei'e. Since Jay probably has printers ink in his veins rather than blood, we expect to see a lot of him around IUs office in the future. His guiding hand, however, will be sorely missed. D. E. S. St. Andrews Scholar Views Political Scene James Balneaves, St. Andrews University exchange scholar, expressed the feeling that the United States ·is start- ing to realize its responsibility in world affairs, in an 1nter- view with the Concordiensis tliis week. Outgrowing Isolationism <$>----....._ ________ _ Gr!lat Britain feels that the United States was once slow in participating in world problems, hut it has outgrown that stage. Jim opined that the Hoover and Taft statements earlier this year, · advocating United States with- drawal from Europe, were merely a carry over of isolationism which is happily dead on this side of the Atlantic. Balneaves, who lives in Aber- deen, Scotland, gPaduated this past June from St. Andrews in Honors English, having studied languages and literature. During the war he served with the Black Watch R.H.R. Infantry and in the Edu- cation Corps. Most of his courses at Union are in the Division of Humanities. When asked fot; a prediction on the forthcoming elections later this ·month, Jim said that the result would probably be indecisive, as the last time, but with the Con- servative Party probably winning. Many think that the Conservatives will produce ,more domestic sta- bility while building on the Labour Party's foundation of the last six years. Revolm Only Steel In the event that the Conserva- tives win, Winston Churchill will again become Prime Minister. The Conservatives have said they would maintain <Labour's gains while re- voking only the rec~nt nationaliza. tion of steel. However, many look upon Churchill as a drawback to the Party, largely because of his age. Britain is generally satisfied and proud of the Labour govern- ment of the six years and prac- tically all disagreement is over de- tails. Ther'e is some feeling that the government is responsible for the meat shortage. Numet,ous small business men claim that there are too many controls on business. Great Britain is generally agreed on rearmament, Balneaves said, with only the left wing Labourites, led by Aneurin Bevan, opposed. Prime M-inister Clement Attlee is of the feeling that to rearm is the only choice, Churchill has not taken a posi- tive stand on foreign affairs. He advocates a \strong foreign policy\ and he favors checking some of t)le American influence that Brit- ain has succumbed to. Balneaves himself says that while Churchill has been a great statesman and war leader, he is somewhat \out of date\ and this opinion is shared by even some members of the Con- servative Party, No Witch Hunts There is very little difficulty in Great Britain with the Communist Party and nothing approximating the American witch hunts, such as the ones conducted by Senator McCarthy and Senator McCarran. In fact, the most popular MP until he was defeated was Willy Galla- gher, a Scottish Communist. He was admired by both Attlee and Churchill. The British, Jim stated, look SO~ll,ewhat slteptically at American democracy particularly because of our constant rantings about it. The disclosures of the Kefauver Com- mittee added to this feeling. This ne!3essity for continually raving on Photo by Forman James Balneaves our part about our de:mDcracy, Jim attributed to political immaturity which will eventually be .dispelled. There was no great <lisagreement in Great Britain last Spring when President Truman dismissed Gen- eral MacArthur. BritDns looked very favorably upon the President's acUon. ---0•--- For Your Information SATURDAY, OCT. 6-Varsity soc- cer, Union vs. University of Massa· chusetts at Amherst, 1 p.m.; Var. sity football, Union vs. RPI a.t Troy, 2 p.m.; Jayvee C.rossCountry, Union vs. University of Vermont at Schenectady, 2 p.m.; Varsity cross country, Union vs. University of Ve1•mont at Schenectady, 2:30 p.m;.

There are, of the .physical a d v an· tages-better liv- ing quarters, bet- ter food', a bouse, parties, etc. There are also social and prestige ues to bei .fraternity ber, and a r e advaJnt~lge:s in living to~~etller with members different school classes. est values of fraternity- ever, · are not physical, They are the intangihles, found in the for- mation of close friendships, in liv- ing and working together with one's friends, in the management of one's own):louse. They are fOUnd in the feeljhg of belonging one gets, in the identification with the gl'oup, and in the security one f.inds in all this. However, the advantages offered by fraternities cpntain .in them- selves their disadvantages. The very words 'member\ and '!belong- ing\ imply also \·non-member'' and \outsider.\ Herein lie the major ,faults of the fraternity system. Being selective and restrictive, most fraternities limit their mem- bership to cer.tain types of indi- viduals. Sometimes these types are racial, religious, or financial; sometimes they are merely person- ality types. In any case, they are restrictive~and the restriction ·Of entrance into a fraternity is also the restriction of the contacts and experiences of its members. Since most close friendships are formed within the group, the type ·IJf friends one has is limited by the entrance requirements; the mere physical isolation of living and eating in a private house restricts one's drcle of fri.lmds. However, the major disadvan- tages of fraternities are felt· not by the members, but by the non- members. The greatest htn.t is felt by tb,ose who wish to join but who are unable to do so; an equal- ly great .Joss is to, those who are perhaps unaware of a desire to join, but who could be benefiteq by fraternity life. The .jronic thing, of ·course, is that those who might benefit mo13t bv fraterrilties~frotn the friend- ships. the sociar living, the feeling ·Of belonging, the security~are pre- cisely these peoule whom frater- nities ignore. 'The person who makes friends easily, who can talk well, who ·already be1ongs-he is chosen by fraterniUes. But the shy, the afraid, the insecure, the outsiders-in short those who need fraternities most-are· forgotten. The problem is not on:e which admits of easv solution. The so- called evils of fraternities may well be the expression of our person- ality traits and needs, and may thus be unalterable by mere pleas a:nd programs. These woulEl de• mand a re-examination .of our reasons for holding them.) At any rate there is no panacea. · There are, however, many re- forms which can be .advocated- the abolition of the \blackball the elimination of racial and religious restrictions, the reduction of finan- dal barriers, the encouragement of upper crass entranc~e, deferred rush- Ing and pledging, and the .post- ponement of initiation until the so.pnomore year. However, more than these re- forms are required. What is need- ed is a general examination, and perhaps overhaul, of the fraternity system. This is the rPsponsibility of not only the fraternities, but also the college. At present only the (Continued on Page 4) Letter to the Editor Last week the Ooncordy pub- lished a. letter to the :editm•, in which prices at West OoUege wet·e criticized. The r.esponse .to the writer from students has been .such that he feels that some more of the compla.ints of the students should be aired, including the l'e· mark ()f one of them that perhaps the old saying, \let 'em eat cai..:e,\ .Jsn't quite as funny as it seems. The 15 cent Ol'llllge juice, the blanket 5 cent inet•eHse in sand- wiches, and the general raising of prices was discussed. More time has been speill.t listening to the general complaints, and investiga,- tion has prove'd them plausible. The fact is th.at the price ()ne must pay for a. minimum break- fast in the West College cafete~·la, are the same and in ma.ny cases m()re th:a.n those that l1ave to be paid in a Schenecfla.dy restaurant. Breiakfast: glass of juice 15 cents; 1 egg with a piece of toast, 20 cents; 1 glass of milk, 10 cents. Forty-five cents for this breakfast. It must be pointed out that 15 cents for a glass of canned tomato juice, grapefruit, ()l\ prune juice, toepresents a pl'ice charged a.t the best restaurants. Also fr>om a 29 cent can (retail), of juice, .at least 8 glasses can be ·poured. Thus at 3¥.! cents a glass, a charge of 15 ·cents is 500 per cent profit. The old· statement, \le't em eat cake,\ may well be true toda'Y • .An order of .toa~t is now 10 cents, for 2 pieces. This is 5 cents a slice. At 20 cents fur a. loaf of 20 slices (again a liberal retai'l price), this represents a .500 per cent clta.rge over cost. If you bothered to ~dd it up you would see that the reve- nue from a 20 cent loaf is $1.00. .Again let it be emphasized that thls is no attacl< at any one or gl'oup of people. It h'!ts never been intended ·as ()ne. It is also not t!itn article to cause trouble:, dissension or fill up space. Its motives are in- cited by what the author and sev- eral other people feel, are unjust and unwarranted prices charge'd in a school cafeteria. Its pm•pose is to let those in charge Itnow stndent · opinion, in the hope that the situa· tit:m will be rectified, or explained, or both. --<Lawrence W.

'H t ulatiou :\la.uagt.•r Make Yourself at Home . amination of this subject, the proposition that continually springs up bdorc us is that engineers should be educated eithl'r before or after entering college. Our justi- fication for handling this topic is ba:>ed on the fact that we are not Pngine<•rs and therefore approach this study in a completely un- prl'judiccd light. As representatives of the militant minority, we firmly maintain the right to complain about forced associations wit):J. ' lt>sser beings. Our first objections to the type are esthetic. Physically, the average engineer has an amazing -lack of distinguish- ing characteristics. One of the most noticeable of these is an habitual expression of blank, staring, un- concern. This is aplly phrased by Mrs. X, an engineering widow at Cornell, who says, \I do like your friends, Chuck, but they never smile.\ In gait, engineers are equally undistinguished except for a tendency to walk very rapidly, and bent forward, as if fighting a heavy current. You have probably been bumped into by an engineer in this position at some time. Engi- neers are often hairy, usually shave only in spots, and are very serious. They are also very rare in this area because real engineers go to RPI. Thus the question remains: What is to be done with this blank, in- coherent vegetable who has in- truded his being into our midst? As a humanitarian people, we can- not espouse extermination. We come to the conclusion that this blatant symbol of the materialistic grasp which is strangling our so- ciety mu:<t he regulated. Even Plato, in his discussion of the philosopher kings, spoke of society as functioning harmoniously only when the artisan class .performs their mechanical skills to the best of their ability. Thus we take this opportunity to advance our plan for an Educate the Engineers Weelc. We, of the n10re advanced. must make clear to our lesser brethren that we do not hate them. lnd~ed a sympa- thetic attitude should be taken. All will try to persuade them to culti- vate literacy outside of the field of science fiction. Make it clear that they have a:f unction and even point out the little mechanical re- pairs that might be made around the campus to prove their sincerity. Above all, tolerance is necessary. n1akes \Vhith sea urec.t.<~;:~ . .1,::, '\'\ ut.tl someone buys a can of grapefruit juice. What. then, is the r.C'ason for summer stock? Primarily, the> buck.

But the .greatest value of stock, in any season, as anyone ,connected or interested in theater can testify, is to bring \more theater to more people.\ Our campus is being visited tomolTO\V by more than fifty high school seniors at the first annual College Day. A big football \Veekend is probably the best time to show off the gay side of college life to prospective freshmen, and we'd like to congratulate the admissions team of Jonathan A. Pearson and Rexford l\Ioon for conceiving the idea. TomolTOW will differ from the customary Sub-Frosh Weekend when high school seniors spend the weekend at fraternity houses. That will be held in February. The success of College Day, and Sub-Ft·osh Weekend, depends largely on the hospitality shown these men by the students, and we have firm confidence that Union men will be their The original reason fo1· foisting engineers upon a liberal arts col- lege is obscure.

With thoug-ht and kindness a new entity may arise on the Union Colleg-e campus, a new and more whole- some whole with doors that close and windows that open, and above all love and charity secure ih ~he knowledg-e that an engineer can be educated! For Your Information usual excellent hosts. To these seniors, we extend our warmest g-reetings. We hope you have a wonderful time tomorrow and we are looking forward to seeing you again next Fall. A Little Consideration By the time this editorial is read, most of you will have retumed from the annual Pajama Parade. We enter- tain just a slim hope that this will reach you before the festivities At best, town and gown relationships are rarely more than cordial. Nothing can strain this relationship more than a reckless crew of 800 college students completely upsetting all the business of a town. The people of Sche- nectady have usually been good sports about Union's Pajama Parade. Motorists face the problem of trying to get through town against almost impossible odds in a good natured spirit. However, sometimes the spirit of the parade goes a little overboard. Several years ago, a brigade of freshmen crashed tht·ough the doors of Proctor's Theatre and com- pletely upset the rest of the proceedings. Town and gown relationships immediately follovdng that display were hardly cordial. Each ~·ear, a group of students tries to break into the Friday night dance at ~ott Terrace High School. A good enough reason for not breaking into the dance is that a bunch of l 1 nion frosh in pajama!'. are just not wanted. Why Do We :'l<eed the Town? The question, A1·e town and gown relationships im- portant? is bound to arise. The answer is an emphatic Yes. The people of Schenectady help support our athletic events. Approximately 55 7r of the audiences at the Mounte- banks shows consisted of townspeople. For these and other financial considerations, it is important to maintain good relationships. Still, there may be a more important reason. When the Draft Deferment Examination was announced last spring-, a good many people with\)ut sons in college pro- tested vehemently. They raised the logical question, Why should college meri. be allowed a four year respite when men are fighting? Why should these men of draft age, just because they have the money to go to college, be deferred? .Many people don't eV.en have the patience to listen to th~ answer, which we feel is a valid reason for deferring -college men. But the surest way to convince these people to apply prssure to their Congressmen and to their draft boards for the immediate drafting of college men is to ·mal;:e an obnoxious spectacle of ourselves tonight. ~; We're not saying that if ?OU don't behave tonight, you'll be drafted tomorrow. But by showing a little con- ' sideration, we can go a long way towards cementing a town and gown relationship that should go beyond cordiality. Letters to the Editor Dear Editor: reason to believe, for example, that For some time now we have the Young Republicans have used watched with increasing alarm money that was given to them various anti-liberal movements on from a source which obtained it campus spring to full bloom, but through stolen student tav money it has not been until recently that to bribe members of the Student a.n:Y of these threats to good. sense Council into pressuring their col- have become violent and reaction- leagues to keep the matter off the ary enough to warrant counter Council floor. When we made it measurps of egual severity. This kr.own that at the first Council latest disregard for the public good meeting of the year we were going of which we write is all the more to appear to present our proposal invidious because of the clardes- in person <our representative hav- tine under-handed way in which • ing refused to act>, the meeting the opposition has been mustered place was secretly changed from to fight the impeccable cause at Old Chapel, tlie announced place, stake. to S01llewheTe else. The Student We write, of course, of the issue of benches for the Union campus. As authors and co-sponsors of this cause we need not labor here over the full details and history of our proposal, yet some background is necessary, we feel, in order that there may be enlightened opinion on this matter. By actual count Union Jags piti- fully behind almost every other in- stitution of its kind in the Western Hemisphere as far as ben-ches go. No other school has shown such sadistic neglect. Union is a fine and venerable place, yet bench- wise she cannot even compare to such places as Oswego State Teachers College, which provides. as was shown in a recent survPy, approximately one bench for every ten posteriors. The New York State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences docs likewise despite its half aci·e campus. These are just random samples showing average conditions which prevail. What does Union have? She has exactly five rr:ounted cement slabs locked away in Jackson's Gardens which could not pass for benches even if they were accessible. Our proposal is a simple one, aimed at the alleviation of this hardship. We would transform the Electrical Engineering Building into stables, utilizing- the Chemistry Building too if there should be a r.-eed, and rent stable space to anyone wish- ing to keep a unicorn in Jaclrson's Gardens. The money raised could be used for benches. Our sugges- tion has the merit of complete simplicity and reason. Council record will bear this out. Furthermore, both of us have re- ceived threats on our lives if we persist in our campaign for decent seatin•g facilities. Who is really behind all this? It is difficult indeed to say, so com- plex Is the network of reaction. Certainly the pants pressing lobby is implicated. When students are forced to sit on the gl'ass there is naturally more business., Other signs point towards adm!instration and ROTC opposition for reasor..s not yet ascertained. What is cer- taip is that every interest is being voiced but that of the average stu• dent. We ask your aid In clearing up a situation which is fast going from bad_ to wope. L~t·s get some benches. Yours truly, DAVIS W. GRIFFITH HERBERT SCHMERTZ Dear Editor: It is not my habit to write letters to the Concordy, but I feel that the West College Dining room situation warrants it, due to the fact that it is not being operated in con- sideration to the students. I think that the Freshmen are especially oppressed by the high prices in lieu of the fact that they hav~ to eat 'dinners there, and there is no other convenient place .for break- fast and lunch, I want to express wholehearted agreement with the last two letters to the Concordy on the subject, and I think the entire campus will agree with me that they tried. to bring an issue to light in a straight forward and intelligent manner .

Did anyone ever tell you that Art Lawrence was once one of the fastest backs in this area, and' still holds the record for throwing the ball the farthest? Mercy, Mr. Law- rence. This bit of malarkey brings to mind two of Bill Stern's tales as report<'d once by oJhn Crosby in his radio column. The first one, as repoted by Mr. Stern, is about I a very promising baseball player who was foi'Ced to leave the gam~ when a bean ball caused him to lose his hearing. Quitting the sport, the disappointed athlete eventually bpcame one of the world's greatest scientists and inventors. Who was· this person, accordir.g to Mr. Stern?

Mencken once said words to the effect that no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American. people, and needless to say, Bill Stern is not getting any poorer. I suppose that I could end this opus on a somewhat serious note and point out some other argu- ments i!J favor of some sort of a football conference for small col- leges in New England and New York State. First of all, I think that this oonferen<'e wouJd dE'vl\lop a good rivalry over the confert>nce cham- pionship, while stil !allowing old, established rivalriPs to continue in full force. There are many Ie.agues throughout the nation, and this one would give local fans a <\llanee to concentrate theh- attentions on local grid battles ratl1er on ga.mps hundreds of miles away. This idea has also recently ap- peared in the sports column of the Rochest£>r CAMPUS. Hal Johnson expresses views that are almost ex- actly like mine and offer some en- couragement for the plan that I have in mind, 1926. :-:inC'<' that yPar he ha~ bPcn 1·unncr;; and leading scorer;:;.

Last week COACH FRANZ GLEICH leg!' Soccer Club, which tied for third place in the Reserve Division of the Central New York State League with a record of 3 wins, two loses, and 1 tie. In 1948, Franz Gleich began, in earnest, the task of molding a var- sity soccer team for his first inter- collegiate season. For the three seasons, his teams have compiled an overall record of 6 wins, 14 losses, and 2 ties. It must be re- member<'d, thou~h. that this was the first time that soccer was played on the Union campus, with the !'XCeption of two years of 1924 and 1925. Coach Gleich is more interested in getting men out to play soccer now, than he is in posting winning records. All that he asks from his players is that they dor.'t quit on him during a game. Besides his interest in his p!aycl's, Gleich is anxious for the student body to take an interest in the sport and for a greater number of them to come out to cheer his team on. they came up with their most im- pressive win by downing Amherst 21-6. It was the first time in that long rivalry that the Rivermen have come out victorious. Coach Hammerstrom knows that his team is going to have a rough time against the visitors. He feels that the Dutchmen would have been the underdogs, even without these injuries, in the light of Roch- ester's record. Most of the backs will try thei!· hand at passing and he will have to do some shifting in his defensive backfield during the game. Delta U Advances In Touch Football As intramural football rolled in- to the third week of competition, only six teams remained in the eliminations. Delta Upsilon, last year's champs, advanced into the semi-final round with a thrilling 9-7 victory over Chi Psi. Delta Phi copped the other semi-final berth in a high scoring duel with Kappa Alpha which was won by the D- Phi's in the last quarter, 1916. Phi Sigma Delta advanced to the quarter-finals, but was eliminated there by an aerial-minded Delta Chi eleven, 20-0. The D-Chi's will play the loser o:t; the D U-D Phi game on Monday. A surprising Beta Eta Upsilon team, sporting the heaviest line in the league, runs up against Phi Delta Theta today, in a major test for the Phi Delts, finalists last year. First RoUlld of Tennis With the first round of intra tennis over last Saturday, five net teams were still battling for top honors. Sigma Phi, last year's ten- nis champs, were eliminated by Delta Phi ·in a surprising upset. Delta Upsilon which .Jost out in the finals last year, sported a flashy attack in downing Phi Sigma Delta. Kappa Alpha downed Psi U, and Chi Psi whipped BEU. In tl:ie hard- est fought match of the week, · Delta Chi nosed out Phi Delta Theta. The second round of the tourqament will be over on Mon- day. Going along with what I said in my first column I would like to quote the Christian Science Moni· tor; I quote, \ThP ideal college was once dPfint>d as Mark Hopkirs on one end of a log and a student on the other.

In 1948, Franz Gleich began, in earnest, the task of molding a var- sity socce1· team for his first intel·- coll<?g-iate season. For the three s<>asons, his teams have compiled an ow•rall record of 6 wir.·s, 14 Ios~<·s. ancl 2 ties. It must be re- membert•d, thou~h. that this was thP first time that soccer was· played on the Union campus, with th\ exception of two years of 1924 and 1925. they came up with their most im- pretitiive win by downing Amherst 21-6. It was the first time in tha:t long rivalry that the Rivermen have come out victorious. 1 Coach Hammerstrom knows thaJt his team is going to have a rough time against the visitors. He feels that the Dutchmen would have been the undel'dogs, even without these injuries, in the light of Roch- estel·'s record. Most of the backs will try their hand at passing and he will have to do some shifting in his defensive backfield during the game. Delta U Advances In Touch Football I As intramural football rolled in- 1 , to the third wcelt of competit-ion, only six tf'IW1s rl'rnaine>d in thr eliminatiOns. Delta Upsilon, last year's champs, advanced into the semi-final round with a thrilling 9-7 victory over Chi Psi. Delta Phi copped the other semi-final berth in a high sebring duel with Kappa Alpha which was won by the D- Phi's in the last quarter, 1916. Phi Sigma Delta advanced to the quarter-finals, but was eliminated there by an aerial-minded Delta Chi eleven, 20-0. The D-Chi's will play the loser of the D U-D Phi game on Monday. A surprising Beta Eta Upsilon team, sporting the heaviest line in the league, runs up against Phi Delta Theta today, in a major test for the Phi Delts, finalists last year.

Hal Johnson expresses vil'WS that are almost PX- actly likf' mine and off<'r some en. couragl'ment for the plan that I have in mind. Coach Gleich is more interested in getting men out to play soccer now, than he is in posting winning records. All that he asks from his players is that they dor.'t quit on him dm·ing a game. Besides his interr•st in his players, Gleich is anxious for the student body to take an interest in the sport and for a greate1· number of them to come out to cheer his team on. With the first round of intra tennis over last Saturday, five net teams were still battling for top honors. Sigma Phi, last year's ten- nis champs, were eliminated by Delta Phi ·in a surprising upset. Delta Upsilon which lost out in the finals last year, sported a flashy attack in downing Phi Sigma Delta. Kappa Alpha downed Psi U, and Chi Psi whipped BEU. 1n the hard- est fought match of the week, Delta Chi nosed out Phi Delta Theta. The second round of the tournament will be over on Mon- day.'

This marked the fourth straight win for the Dutchmen over· the Enginee1·s and the second in two years under the tutlage of Coach Sam Hammerstrom.

A majority of those who were interviewed were found to have their attitudes toward sororities and fraternities unchanged as a result of the movie. And, more notal:>ly, they thought that the \Communist-inspired\ charges were completely unfounded, and utterly ridiculous. A comment that seems to sum up the entire situation inferred that tlie whole thing seemed awfully silly; \How do they get anyone to join if it's that bad?\ On the whole, then, the feeling went that Hollywood had very much distorted the sorority situa- tion. \Unfair to Greelts\ All college students who were interviewed agreed that the movie was unfair to the Greeks. A senior in high school was extremely vio- lent in her remark: \It wasn't typical of sororities at all. Sorori- ties are just the thing for a girl who wants to get ahead socially In collPgP . . Resld~>s, rushing and pledging are fun-not miser- able like in the movie.\ An elderly lady, on the other hand, felt that sororities should be eliminated: \There's too much heartbreak for those who can't join.\ This scene was very well pointed up In the scene where the bids were handed out and one young lady found an empty en- velope. One rather definite comment came from a sorority girl who said, \Well I don't think I'll turn in my pin, if that's what you want to know.\ On the other hand, a senior, who admitted he was de- finitely anti-fraternity reto1·ed, \No I'm still convinced that the fra- ternity arrangement is a good deal -it keeps those screwballs In one section of the campus.\ \More Hogwash\ The biggest blow to Hollywood came in the fact that less than half of those interviewed were willing to recommend the movie to their friends. One middle-aged man said he wouldn't have attended it himself, were it not that the inside of hls house was being painted and he wanted to get away from the smell! The final question asked by the Interviewers--do you agree with the IFC (national) In that the movie was Communist inspired?- brought chuckles f rom tho s e queried. It seems that the first thought in most people's minds was that McCarthy was now hit- ting Hollywood! The majority of spectators who knew little· or nothing about the fraternity system felt that they knew no more after seeing the picture.- The college men who saw the picture felt principally that it was \just more Hollywood hog- •NaRh.\ For Car Troubles See a Union Man Ask the Boys Who Trade Here William H.

Free and Independent Indictment Against Council Ed. Note-Since the only space for opinions of staff members is the editorial column, we herewith print this editorial. It does not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of the Concordiensis. Whatever the original reason for the formation of the Student Coucil was, it has now become lost. The present Council group serves only as a vehicle for students who like the sounds of their voices and who are obsessed with their own importance, and as a result, monopolize the meetings with long talks on insignificant matters. One has t<? look very ha1·d to see anything that the Student Council has ac- complished during the last few years that has been of any importance. For the most part, the council acts as a rubber stamp on most matters, and only does work on minute, and insignificant problems. our campus. · Any measure that is of some importance finds the mem- bers totally unable to cope with it, and as a result these mat- ters are either tabled, buried in committee, or sent on to some higher person to be dealt with. · Big Noises Monopolize There a1·e a couple of big winds in the council whose o11ly purpose in attending the meetings is to make themselves heard and perhaps get their name m print. The main body of members is· practically totally disinterested in the pre- ceedings, and their main interest is in getting the meetin.g over with so that they can go about their other bUsinesses on campus. The few members who are seriously intere&ted in the running of the council are quelled by these others who monopolize the meetings. A rundown of the agenda of any of the meetings will interest practically no one since only technicalities and insig- nificant subjects are discussed. It is a shame that the few honest workers, who are really interested in the running of the organization have to waste their time and talents on such an unproductive organ. The Student Council is one of the biggest farces on the cam- pus today. It is time for the college men of America to awake from their complacency to fight for the preservation of -M. B.

Lausche, the Ohio For Your Information State Board of Trustees-we echo the words o-f Bishop FOR ACCURACY Michael J. Ready of Columbus: ''No one need fear the words of a man as long as a teacher is allowed to then put those words against a background of truth.\ Our society is based on the integrity and value of the individual, even \school children\ i.e. the college men of America. Compulsory indoctrination, p.s shown in the above examples, ignores all capabilities for personal evaluation and destroys the essence of individual integrity. The in- dividual is no longer trusted and finds himself subjugated to the very evils he is supposedly fighting. The proponents of such tactics destroy the vital basis of our democracy as much as any totalitarian regime and thus must be re- garded as the subtle enemies of our society, D. E. S.

The cheerleaders now consist of two freshmen, four sophomores and one junior. The Council recommended that some change be made in the selection of the cherleaders so that a situation similar to the one that occured last year when all of the chQerleaders graduated, does not reoccur. After a motion for adjournment was on the floor, Wilfred H. Ketz, Coordinator of student activities asked that the Council approve a grant for $300 be taken from the Campus Chest Fund, and that It be given to the Schenectady Com- munity Chest. The motion was passed, but was late!\ ruled out of order by David Walrath, president of the Council, since it followed the adjournment motion and no further action has been taken on the matter. Schedule Exams For Law Schools The Law School Admission test required of applicants for adinis· s!on to a number of leading Am- erican law schools, will be given at more than 100 centers throughout the United States on the mornings of November 17, 1951, February 23, .Apr!I 26, and August 9, 1952. A candidate must make separate application for admission to each law school of his choice and should inquire of each school whether it· requires him to talte the test. Since many law schools select their ft'eshmen classes in th.e S]lting pre- ceding their entrance, candidates for admissions to next year's classes are advised to take either the November or the February test.

The committee, consisting of John Carrierre, David Walrath, William Delaney and Dana Han- ford, have thus far heard reports from Prof. Clare Graves of the I psychology department, P1·of. Don- ald S. Jones, faculty leader of the Mountebanks, and Richard Hei- mann, former president of the or- ganization. Ref(}rms Suggested Henry J. Swanker of the Gradu- ate Council has planned a varied and .busy 'itinerary for the re- turnees. Included in the schedule is a meeting of the Graduate Coun- cil, the football game between Union and Hobart, and a familY luncheon at Hale House, with Dr. Edwin L. Crosby as speaker. Fra- ternities will contribute to the fes- tivities, with such attractions as post-game teas, buffet suppers and open house. The history of Home Coming Weekend dates back to 1923, when the first one was held. 72 men at- tended the first Homecoming, then known as College Day, tc see Union trounce Hobart, 7-3 in foot- ball. The 1951 edition of Homecoming Weekend will get underway today with registration at Hale House. The rest of the day will be spent in visiting classrooms, laboratories .and daily assembly in Chapel, plus a pep rally at B:OO. The first for- mal gathering will be a meeting of the Executive Committee of the· Graduate Council tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the library of West College. Crosby Speaks on Hospitals Action on Saturday will com- mence at 9:45 a.m. in Old Chapel, with a. general meeting of the Graduate Council. The meeting is open to all, and its purpose is to nominate three candidates for the position of alumnus trustee. At 12:00 noon there will be a family luncheon at Hale HotJse. Dr. Edwin L. Crosby., Class of 1929, will give an address. Dr. Crosby is di- rector of Johns Hopkins hospital, and was recently appointed to the advisory health resources commit- tee by President Truman. f{is topic . at the luncheon will be \The Hos- pital Picture Today.\ The scene will shift to Alexander Field in the afternoon, where Union plays host to a strong Ho- bart eleven. Kiclr-off time is scheduled for 2:00 p.m. Halftime entertainment will be provided by the College band. Following the game there will be a coffee hour at Hale House from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. All alumni, stu- . dents, and faculty are welcome to attend. In addition, many frater- . nities will have open house, fea- tured by post ga.me teas atJ.d buf- fet suppers for returning brothers. The weekend will be formally conclUded by Sunday's 11:00 a.m. Chapel speaker. The speaker will be nev. ·samuel :\.L Cavert, Secre- tary of th;, National Council of Churches. ~~--o-~--- Dr. Graves spoke on the prob- lems of the Mountebanks. Mr. Jones, however, gave some advice on what could be done to help re- organize the group. He advocated a job apportionment setup, He felt that this would more evenly di:vlde the work, and that everyone could· have a share in the productiQn in- stead of the work being done by two or three members, as was the Delphics Society to Sponsor Tutoring The Delphic. Society tutoring pro- gram, gesigned ,primarily to aid freshmen, will begin Monday night, Chairman David Platt has an- nounced. .All classes will run from 7:30- 9:00 p,m. The schedule for next week is as follows: · practice in the past. He was also. of the opinion that the students • should themselves determine just what they want in the way of Mountebank reform. Heimann advocated that the business and production ends of the production be under separate leadership, and that they not be concurrent as was the case before the group was disbanded.

Scheduled activities include several social gatherings where former graduates can once again visit with their old classmates. It has been emphasized that students are ·invited to attend an:y social gathering for the alumni. It would be a welcome gesture if many students did attend these func- tions in order to create a closer and warmer relationship with the alumni body. Our prime concern this weekend is to display our most gracious welcome mat to those returning to the campus. We want them to return home with a most satisfying feeling of the weekend and we also want them to return to Union ~s often as they can. To the alumni, then, we extend our hospitality. It's our hope that you enjoy the best Homecoming Weekend you've ever spent.· We also hope you bring us luck in to- morrow's football game. Who Makes the Noise? With all the cur1·ent excitement on the campus about activities and why they are not doing so well, we are re- minded of an old fable. The story concerns a \little red hen\ who wants to plant some com. She asks the fox, and a few other friends of hers to help. They' can't seem to find the time to help, nor are they able to give her any assistance when it is time to weed or harvest the com. Later, after the little red hen has made the corn into cakes, she has no trouble at all finding someone to eat them. By Jay N. Cohn What this campus needs is a good ten-cent prom! Now I don't mean to infer that a fabulous Union p r o m weekend should cost only ten cents. Every- one knows that a dime doesn't buy much any- more; but it seems that some· body's values an mixed up when prom prices an established. If a guy wants to go out fifteen, or even twenty his best girl, far be it from me to discourage him. But we must remember the poor lad who doesn't have twenty cents, or maybe does- n't even have a best girl. Of course, there will always be the guys who look forward to the big weekend as an opportunity for conquest. These fun-lovers would probably go to the proms even if it cost them as much as thirty cents, for, aiter all, it would cost almost that much to get the same kind of entertainment elsewhere. But certainly that's not the type of individual proms depend on for their success. These affairs must cater to the average student, and I use the term advisedly, who want to have a fair amount of fun, listen to good music, and dance. But the truth is that the high price of tickets to these semi-an- nual fiascos eliminates many of these men immediately and, in keeping attendance down, makes the high price of tickets necessary. It's a vicious circle, and the poor benighted student is right plunk in the middle. Too many campus gay blades who are past the stage of impress- ing their girls don't even go to the dances anymore. They invite their babe up for the weekend and spend a few days partying, figuring that the financial outlay for a couple hours of dancing isn't compensated by the dress shirt, the hot tux and the questionable entertainment. And, if you houstl the woman in the fraternity house and can stand a diet of beer and pretzels, it's surprising how little a gala week- end can cost. Proms will never fulfill their purpose at Union-to supply a so- cial outlet for all the students - until more of them are encouraged to go. And the best way to en- courage attendance might be to cut down on the ticket price. If would necessitate skimping a little on prom expenses, that would be all right too. It might surprise some people on campus to know just how much is spent on an item like decorations. And last spring's two bands seemed a bit extrava- gant, especially the one with the John Philip Sousa complex. It is even possible that, by low- ering the fee, enough more men may turn out to make up the dif- ference without any dip whatever in prom quaJity. It certainly should be worth a try. The only other alternative would be for the prom committee to sup- ply girls-girls who would make the expense worthwhile-for those guys who do not have their own sources. Since this latter plan seems, at the present, unworkable, the place to begin must be with the finances. I suggested. to the committee a few weeks ago that, as an experi- ment, corsages be eliminated for this prom, thus cutting down some- what on the exorbitant expense. They were afraid the poor girls would be \hurt.\ Tch, tch on the poor girls. They don't supply anything but them- selves. Well, even that might suf- fice-at ten cents. The \little red hen\ in this story seems to fit a lot of the campus activities. They have a hard time recruiting students to take an active part in the activity but they have no trouble in finding students who enjoy the results of the \little red hen's\ work. They also have no trouble in find- ing students who are critical of the activity but just can't seem to find the time to support the group. These \side- liners\ don't try to improve an activity by joining it and actually working for a better \crop of corn.\ They seem to be content to sit on the sidelines and criticize. Too often they just complain without making any attempt to criticize constructively. Letters to the Editor Anyone can blast away at the Student Council for fail- ing to \do this or that\ or can criticize WRUC for cutting the hours that they broadcast, but too many of these critics are \sideliners.\ My colleague in his editorial last week mentions that he feels that a couple of big winds monopolize the Student Souncil meetings. We feel that too often those, who are classified as \sideliners have a fine wind capacity themselves. -W.G.T.

We have here a highly hypicritical situation, since ihe article on the benches was not only one of the grossest misrepresentations of ac- curacy I have ever seen, but be- cause this same innaccuratc writer professes accuracy. Explination. It was stated in the October 12th issue that Oswego State College had \1 bench for every 10 pos- teriors,\ and that Union College was the only school in the Western Hemisphere that had none. Upon a careful and detailed survey at my own expense; and. one which took me to Colgate, Oswego and Amherst, among other places, I can safely report the following to the satisfaction of the rest of we CONSERVATIVES on campus, that Oswego State Teachers Col- lege has only 2 benches on the campus, both being tested by my- self. Colgate, one of the longest areas for a campus and with no escalator for its 500 foot climb to classes, has none. The complete report is nat finished yet, but IL'l the days go on and the information increases, it looks like the letter of the 12th of October recommend- ing the use of the Chemistry build- ing as a rental area from which money would be raised for benches at Union, was a deliberate attempt to sabatage the defense effort by limiting . the number .of engineers in the United States, and perhaps nothing more than ~he new radical party line for the month of Oc- tober.

That has posed one of tht> tough- est problems for Sam because both John Shade and Dick NPmPth wt>rP excellent in this important df'fen- sive slot, and many shifts haw• bt>en tried with incpnclusive re- sults due to furthPr injuries in,. curred by replacements. The offense has also been hit hard by injuries. In one game we used our third tailback and a re- placement fullback, thus seriously hamperin~ our pas:oing attacl~: and limiting the offense badly. Things are looking up again, however, because Reed, Dickson, and Klingberg are just about back to full capacity, and our backfield strength is regaining its full po- tential on offpnsp and defense. Just hold your breath and give some sort of prayer that will stave off further injuries, or Union may convert to six man football in ordeJ> to ha VI' runple reserve strength. There are other sports at Union, and I would like to give a plug for somt' of the men who do not draw the crowds or have the universal appeal that one finds in football etc. To persevere in such a sport as cross-country i:o a sign of grPat pC'rgonal charad<>r and self-dis- ciplinE'. Your columnist was dis- suaded from the running profes- sion by a good runner who con- fessed that he wished he were playinl' baseball. ThPrP arP thrills and sPnsations to bt> found in all sports, and one thing a football playpr loves to see is a bacl• breaking away for a TD. A runner, however, once told me that tile great('st sensation he ex- periences in a tough race is that of his stomach forcing its way out to fresh air. Soccer is another sport at Union that suffers by comparison with the more publicized and popular events. It frequpntly amazes visi- tors in this country to see this great game regarded as a minor sport while in their home country a soccer game may draw crowds far greater than our major baseball and football games. Such an example is just further proilf that our sports fans must develop a broader cilncept of the word sport and not judge a gan1e only by their own narrow stand- ards. A sport is where a man is giving his all, physically and spiritually, and this pffort should be respected as sueh. I believe that the major virtue of athletics is not to be found in the immediate results of wins and losses, but rather in the character building of the individual athlete. All the effort that goes into partici- patinf!\ requires a spirit of dPtPr- mination ar.d subordination to the team. Such training has its direct parallels in life. The rigorous \oonditioning\ is really a prepara. tion for sensible living. Self-dis- cipline is required evPrywhere and so are all the othf'r features found in athletics. ----o---- Grid Title to DU Sparked by the brilliant passing and dPfensive play of Jimmy <Goiden Greek) Charkalis, Delta Upsilon swept to its second straight football title. In doing so they conquered a strong Phi Delt club 14-6. The outcome was never in doubt, and continue-s a winning streak for the DU's that spans the past two years. Charkalis set up both scores and then passed for the tallies, and on defense he was con- stantly breaking up possible scor- ing plays. ----01--- Rah, Rah Fight Locomiltlve FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT, -UNION, UNION <Three .tjmesl Fight, ~earn Fight! - - • \\r\ FRIDAY~ OCTOBER 26,.1:961 Dutchmen · Eleven To Face Dick Dolan Paces ·Harrier-Track Teams Powerful· Statesman Foe If you have ever met Dick Dolan around the campus, you would never suspect that he is probably one of the best all- around runners to attend Union in the last twenty years . You wouldn't suspect it, but Bill Ketz, his mentor and the man who should know, has stated that in two decades of coaching Union track and cross-country squads, he~s never had another man like Dolan. ~ . BY Irwin Barg The Dutchmen will clash with a powerful Hobart foot.· ball team tomorrow aftm·noon on Alexander Field, and they will be seeking their third win in five starts. The visitors gained a ro.aring 26-14 victory over Kenyon College last weekend putting their season's record at one win and two loses. Hobart's record is deceptive, and~.,_~~--,--~---~--~~ their well balanced offense will make them one of Union's toughest opponents. In their opening game they lost to St. Lawrence, who had already won two. Then they were defeated by a very strong Trinity team, befot·e facing Kenyon. Union evened their season's l'ecord with the 32-25 win over Champlain and showed somll scoring punch with the return or Klingberg and Dick- son to the starting lineup. watch Letizia The visiting Statesmen play out of a T-formation, which is cap- tained by Lee Letizia, with Union as their first single wing !.'iva! of the yew:. Letizia is the big offen- sive threat, being a capable passer and a strong ground man. He completed eight of fifteen passes last Saturday and piled up 53 . yards in 13 cracks at center. Leti- zia is the big man in Robarts back- field, weighing 180 pounds, and is a standout in their defensive back- field. The running attack of the vis- itors will center around Bill Mor- ton, a freshman who gained 114 yards against Kenyon scoring two touchdowns, and Bill Michels, the junior fullback who picked up 93 yards in 25 tries. Michels also snared 5 passes from Letizia, good for 54 yards. Don Bramante is the probable starter at the other half- back position. Tryon Has a Big Line Hobart Coach Ed Tryon will start two senior ends, Ham Web- ster and Dave Gorman. Gorman is the leading pass receiver with seven completions, one good for a touchdown. The big man for the visitors is 229 pound Dick Opper- man who fills. the left tackle slot. Bob Mathews, another freshman plays right tackle, with John McMahon and Don Bruno at the guard positions. G'abe Vetare is the likely starter at center. Coach Sam Hammerstrom will make some changes in his offen- sive lineup. Fred Linn, a 185 pound senior, will start at right tackle in place of Ed O'Mealy. Bill Fri- day will be the other tackle, with John Kennedy and Joe Guerra at the guards. Jim Salerno will con- tinue at center and Randy Oram and Jerry O'Loughlin at the ends. Union Offense Strong Tom Giambruno will do most of the quarterbacking for the Dutch- men. He played fullback in· the early part of the season but was switched to quarterback for part of the game with Champlain. Bob Seydel will also see some action at that position. Bill Snyder and Len Klingberg will again be at the half- Ketzmen to Meet Engineers at Tr.oy ~--•••••-----------------•-•r I I I I I I I I I I I Attention Dutchmen!

George feels that armed cor.flict in Israel today is overplayed by the American press. Tht•rP are, one<' in a while, small skirmishes <like the recent incident over the drain- age project on the Syrian border) but most of the conflict is ex- pressed politically rather than physically. George feels that the source of the conflict lies in the partition plan v. hich divides Palestine in·to Israel and Arab states. This plar. was not favorably accepted by the Palestinian Arabs who are sup- ported by the surrounding Arab states, of Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, etc. However, Geo1·ge added, this does not mean that the JE!ws and Arabs, as people, could not, or do not want to live together harmoni- ously. The basis of the hostility lies, he feels, in the nature of the compromise settlement, the arti- ficiality of the partition. George believes that a much better settle- ment' would have been a united Palestine with a democratic gov- ernment representing both Jews and Arabs as citizens and not as particular ethnic groups. When asked about the compari- son between life inside and outside of Israel, George said that the Arab government is not a repre- sentative one, whereas Israel's Government is representative. Liv- ing conditions vary; the rural Arabs have better food than the rural Jews while the workers in- side Israel enjoy better living standards than those in the Arab States. DP Problem One of the biggest problems in Palestine to day is that of the half million displaced Arabs who left Israel at the outbreak of hostlllties and who would like to return to Israel. The Israeli government, however, will not allow them to return, said George, until there is peace between Israel and the Arab States. George believes that the hostility will gradually die out with time, as the Arab States reconcile themselves to the partition plan. When asked about his main im- pressions of college life here at Union, George said that he is most impressed by the cooperative spirit among the students and by the free expression of opinion as in the Concordiensis and discussion in general. ---o•--- Foreign Film In accordance with its policy of showing foreign films, the Crane Theater on 932 Crane Street will show \Fame is the Spur,\ a Brit- ish film starring Michael Redgrave Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.
