Y., SEPTEMBER 25, 1959 Football Opener Page 5 PRICE TEN CENTS Year YIJ1CA.Home For DChi Delta Chi, Union's fraternity without a house, plans to move into ne wquarters this June. The College is building a quadrangle of houses east of the Field House for the four -off-campus frater- nities who are being forced out of their present buildings by zon- ing regula;tions. Because of the early sale of their house, most of the men in Delta Chi have been living in the YMCA here in Sche- nectady. TWo men are liv-ing in private apartments, tw() are work- ing as freshman counselors and living in the dorms, four are mar- ried and living off-campus with their families, and one man is living with Union's c:lirector of athletics, Mr. Bill Ketz. The new house will cost well over one hundred thousand dol- lars and win be run on the suite system with two men sharing bed and study rooms. Delta Chi is hold~ng its rushing luncheons and dinners at nearby restaurants. They have secured the Rathskeller for their Friday and Saturday night pa.r.ties.

Presidential Message To the Concordiensis: We are assured by the Admissions Office that the Class of 1963 on the basis of College Board scores and hiO'h school r~cords, has the best chance of academic suc- ce~s of all the classes admitted to Union since World War II. Whether they will live up to this potential remains .to be seen, but at least it is good to know t~at the matel'~al is available. Personally, I hope that th1s class and 1ts three predecessors will mal~e the College year 1959-.60 the best one since the War m the area of student activ- ities. The appointment of Dean Edward Pollock on a full- time basis to assist in this area should show how eager the College administration is to help to bring this about. As far as physical facilities are concerned, t~e new Dormitory is obviously going to be completed durmg the year, and perhaps we can move students i?-to it in the Spring so that we can make some changes m South Col- lege to provide social rooms and other facilities to strengthen our social program. Also, th~ ne~ Shafter Library is about to come off the architects drawmg boards to go out for study and for bids by contractors. We would hope that ground can be broken for this im- portant new building early in the Spring. For Professors Coffin, Larrabee, and Edward Smith, this year marks the final year of their long careers of t.eaching at Union. By next June when they retire these three men will have taught a total of 112 years on om· Faculty. I am sure all of you agree that the impact they have had upon Union is incalculable and finding replace- ments for them on our staff will be a major task. I hope that they will find this year the most pleasant and re- warding of them all and that Union students will show by the work that they do their appreciation of the re- markable service rendered by these men. At the recent Faculty Retreat the Faculty members present, after long discussion, indicated that they would heartily approve of an \honor system\ of supervising ex- aminations and student honesty in academic matters. They felt, however, that this program should be initiated and worked out by the student body itself, since it will have to be administered by them. I therefore turn this matter over to the Student Council to consider during the coming year, with the assurance that the Faculty are ready to encourage your efforts. Cordially yours, Carter Davidson Rules and Reason Through the establishment of the Rushing Rules En- forcement Committee last Thursday, September 17, the HPC declared· its belief that the way to insure a successful rushing period this year was to demand of each fraternity an obeyance of the rushing rules second only to that of the United States Constitution. And if one Ustened to there- port of this committee at the last HPC meeting, there could be no doubt that in terms of keeping down the crime rate, 1959 has been the most successful year in our memory. 1 lfi<' In fact, the infractions uncovered by the \policing\ committe€ were so few and far between that they had to reach deep into their resources to bring up four cases and prove to the HPC that they meant business. Apparently the philosophy behind their action was that by demon- strating beyond any doubt that they would show no mercy, they would make any house think twice before daring to defy the law. ~ ~1..: Among the infractions that the committee noted and recom:mended be met with a $5 fine, was Kappa Sigma's lapse in allowing a rushing team to remain in a West Col~ }ege room until 9:07 by the chimes in the Chapel tower. The team of rushers left the room only to walk right into the waiting arms of the Committee. By noting this violation, the Committee clearly achiev- ed their purpose of demonstrating that they would draw the line as finely as possible and allow no deviations to pass their watchful eyes. If the Committee was only trying to p1·ove that they meant ·business, then their actions were justified. But if instead they plan to continue this policy of noting even the most petty of violations, then their whole purpose will be destroyed.

4 Carl Witzel Chosen To Replace After tucking away his own athletic achievements, Witzel turned to coaching. He spent two years at Andover High School, Andover, New York, as head coach of soccer, basketball, and baseball. There he brought the school it.s first winning season in ~occer plus the county champion- ship. chalked up a strong win- ning slate in basketball, and ad- vanced his baseball squad to the sectional finals. However it was at Brighton High School, Rochester, New York, where Witzel really made a name for .himself. His tealllll posted a phenomenal .700 r!!{:ord for his eight year tenure. During his athletic directorship at Brigh- ton, Coach Witzel steadily in- creased his t earn's !au re Is. His 1952-3 hoopsters captured the see- tiona! championship while posting a 35-4 record over a two year span; and his undefeated 1956-57 quintet notched the county title.

The days when The Annual is an ·official, non- profit publication listing the job opportunities normally made available by the more than 1,700 par.ticipating companies. Union is one of nearly 600 colleges and universities throughout the United States and Canada where it is being distributed. Copies for personal or reference use are available at the Placement Office, Wells House. Engineers in DMna.nd In 1959-60, as in most years in recent history, engineers wiil find themselves most in demand among the recruiters. Close to two-thirds of the companies listed in the Annual are interested in . hiring some trpe of engineer, and cumulative totals show more than 3,600 company openings for engi- neers of various types. Mechanical engineers, for the third year in a row, will be the most popular-some 800 compan- ies list openings for them-but the twin specialties of electrical and electronic engineering are close behind. The third most de- sirable man, in the eyes of the re- cruiters at any rate, will be the chemist. In the most startling jump in demand revealed by the Annual, the number of companies offering openings in that field went from 396 in 1959 to 672 this year. Selling High on List Fields with futures, as meas- ured by the number wanting per- sonnel in those categories, are selling, specified by 613; account- ing, 516; chemical engineering, 472; and business administration, 459. Industrial engineers, though still sought-after, found the de- mand for their services falling slightly, from 481 last year to 431. And, smaller in number but re- flecting changing occupational trends, the number of firms seek- ing mathematicians grew from 177 to 193, and the number seek- ing electronic computing person- nel continued to increase. In all, 236 occupations are either refer- enced or cross-referenced in the book. Wam'ell Included Examining the openings and opportunities for women gradu- ates, the Annual, for the first time this year, contains a special listing of those firms which offer professional e m pI o y m e n t to women. Nearly 600 of the firms listed offer as warm a reception for the ladies as for the men; the job opportunities range from ac- counting to aerodynamics and aero engineering and from proba- tion work to land law examina- tion to dentistry. Articles in the opening section of the Annual give tips on all as- pects of recruiting and job-hunt- ing, including writing resumes, interview do's and don'ts, and training programs. Others offer help in self-analysis, making job decisions, and ways to use 'bbe placement bl,!reau, a;;j We)l IJ,S a special article offering advice to working women. ~ -------o·------- Library. • • Awards Presented: Seek Funds . another major change in the games· with, Columbia, Yale \'h E t · d'bl p· 0 am was rushing systeQJ. this year has been_ Pl'·inceton, Harvard, and ethel'S ( \ontl'nued rr~ Page 3) The second pa\.t .of the Convo- ~· e x en 1 ·e r gr · ,..., f t• 1 \ ~· •· t th d f the adoption of the :e-re eren 181 . were taken as a matter of course l 1 . t cati'on was devoted to the pre-. another i em .an ·e agen a o . 11 . .

The coaches pointed out, bow- ever, that they are making no plans to drop the sport. \Foot- ball is too ·important a .p-art of RPI's life and history,\ Hoffman said. They do feel, however, that 1f conditions do not improve con- tinuance of the s•port would have to be seriously questioned. The Administration has indi- cated -that the resolution of the problem lies with the Student body. At a meeting of Freshman Orientation Week Councillors, Pt'esident Folsom stated that in- tercollegiate athletics are a stu- dent activity and their problems should be solved ·by students. The most pressing aspect of the problem at the moment. is man- power. Although the squad grew to twenty-seven men after the football rumors started, this is not a significant improvement.
