The frosh block is the !arg- est and .perhaps easiest to s 'ay. Thi! grand result of lhis w cek of garrulous gaiety was the elec- tion of one (1) GM, one (1) PU. three (3) each of class presidents, vice - presidents, secretaries and treasurers and 18 (three times six for those who don't have their slide rules on them) class repre- sentatives. Since beer mugs are distributed at the polls in addition to all the other activities of the Vl·eek, it would seem that the entire pro- ceedings are hardly designed to ferret out the best candidate. Perhaps students are expected to pick the party .that distri·butes the better beer. At RPI, the an- swer to the farrdliar, \What'll you have?\ is not Pabst, but Feder- ation or Coalition.

Draft, Reserve Survey The entire question of .fulfilling one's military obligations has al- ways been a re.Jatively complex one for the college student, and with the advent of the new \six month\ programs it v.ill become even more so. At first the six month program, introduced by the Reserve Forces Act of Augu~t 1955, was of little concern to the college student, sin<'e It was ap- plicable only to men 'below the age of 181h. Thus, the college student, un- less he is married and has chil- dren or 'has been placed. in a 4-F category for physical reasons, fa{:es the prospect of being draft- ed within at most one or two years after graduation, and if there is a large amount of en- llstment ·under the slx.·month pro- gram, the age of draft call may be lo·,\ered st1ll further_ WRUO Program Schedule Five-Minute News: 8 A.M., 9 Weekdays: A.M .. 8;25, 10;25 7:20-9;50-M<trning Sh{)W, Alan Megibow and Joseph Coons Saturdays: 4-4::l0 - warm up, Richard 7:20-9:50-Morning Show, Alan Adanti Megibow and Joseph Coons 4 :30.:5:30-Best in Wax, Michael l-1 A.

Produced in 1949 and directed by Henry Cornelius, the film stars Margaret Rutherford and Stanley Holloway. It deftly satirizes the accumulation of ,post-war 'ills that beset EnglE!ind and leads one to wonder whether the British were in reaHty the victors. Imagine a situation in which a middle-class London neighborhood is suddenly discovered by an ·Old deed to be Burgundian soil. Im· agine the pop-eyed excitement into which this discovery throws the shop-owning residents of the region who a:re fed up with the continued austerity, Imagine the diplomatic mix up and the For- eign Office's chagrin - and you have the essential makings of Pa;ssport to Pimlico. Viewed with a fair appreciation of the trials through Which the British had gone, it is not diffi- cult to understand why its hu- .mor was so popular on its home ground. A lot of cute buffoonery ha:J been spread here and there in a tale of extraterritorial complica- tions in the hear-t of London. For example,. there is t'he bl'ight and breezy business o~ the resiqents stopping subway trains and de- manding custom declarations from the passengers passing through. that makes for a comic agitation good for a laugh from anyone. · There is also the funny appea.r- ance of a wan Burgundian duke to cla:im his due, and t\le spec- tacle of the reign being supplied by an airlift during a siege. But there is· also compounded in this nonsense, a large swipe of sardonic spoof at the many vexa- tions which the British have grown weary of - shortages, ra- tioning, curfews, troubles with currency, and the bleak paradox of living without things which other people have. The neat way in which the producers have mocked these annoyances in jest is really the secret of the pic- ture's suooess. · Viewed in this country eight years later, such 'spoofing, while clever, does not have the same in- Tony's Ideal Shoe Service 1565 Van Vranken Quality Work Done At Low Prices While You Wait • Work Guaranteed tensity, and many of its collo- quialisms may be meaningl~ss to American ea.rs. Also, much of the picture~s charm has been lost in the injudicious cutting that was done before it was released in this •country. It is often lacking in rhythm, the transitions ·are fre- quent and abrupt, and some of the humor seems labored because it is not well cued. However, Stanley Holloway, who plays the premier of PimUco, turns in a sensitive performance. Mr. Holloway, is now featured in the Broadway hit My Fair Lady. Raymond Huntley is ann~singly dour a:s a bank clerk who finds himself .tangled ·in the complex mysteries of government finance. Nauton Wayne and Basil Red- ford, who have appeared in !Iiany BI'itish Imports, turn up as stolid diplomats, and Margaret Ruther- ford. is jovial as a thrilled anti• quarian. Taken as a whole, fine acting has been combined with a satiric script to produce a highly amusing show. Council. • • (Continued: from Page 1) in May.

For the man who wishes to slip through the clutches of his local draft .board, the government has provided over 40 different methods of escape. Micarelli 8:30-9-Georgetown Forum, Doc- 736 State Street Phone EX 3~8668 If the six-month program, .pri- marily a reserve measure, draws off a large number of men •who normally would enlist for three years or be drafted for two, a considerable reducticn of men available for the draft could re- sult. Such a reduction could pos- s~bly lead to a draft which called almost every physically fit male and even to a lowering of the age at wh·ich most men are ·being taken--currently 22 years. Since the raising o1' reserves is the primary purpose of the new six-month program, it is entirely possi•IJ.le that once the authol'ized reser·ve strength is filled, the Act will be discontinued untH it is needed again; and since all draftees and enlistees who finish their two yrars of active duty after August 1957 must spend two years in the ready ·reserves, re- serve and National Guard units may be filled rather rapidly. At presE>nt, most college coun- selors adv.ise students not to take the ·draft defetment tests sin<'e by .doing so one automatically extends hi~ dt·aft eligibility to the age of 35. However, in the next few years, a deferment test may become necessary if one is to cO<mplete his coHege education un- interrupte<l by the draft. Once a man has finished col- lege, there is no ·le-gal :provision for deferment through graduate study. This matter is entil'ely in the hands of local draft 'boards, whiclh may or may not approve a student's request .for time to complete graduate work. In any case, :whether in college or .grad- uate school, one can always be deferred un Ui the end of the academic year ih which he is studying. The simple way out is, of course, enlistment. By enlisting one can avoid t:he uncertainty of waiting to he called, and that is about all. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and Air l<'orce all require from three to four years' active duty from all enlistees, followed by two or three years in the ready a.nd standby reserves. The student already in college and planning to continue his edu- cation without interruption wiil not find enlistment much of a ·so- lution to his problems, and m.ust turn inevitably to the eKpanding Reserve and National Guard pro- grams. The Army Reserve offers only a two year active duty program and the siKth month program for men over 18%. Added to the six months training period are five and one half years of ready re- serve and no standby reserve for a total military obligation of six years. All reserves except the Navy's offer nearly identi<Cal six month :programs, but only to men be- tween 11 and 18 1 12 years. The Army and Ail· Force require four and one half years of ready re- SI'rve followed by three years standby reserve; the Marine Corps has five and one half years ready reserve and two years standby; and the •Coast Guard has seven and one half. years ready reserve with no standby. All of these programs, since they apply .only to men under 18'>!!, have an eight year period of service, as opposed to the more usual six year obligation. !Most have very Si!Ilall quotas. The major .difficulty with these programs lies in the fact that un- der them one is not deferred from the draft.

Electric development engineer Bill Hancock is a graduate of Pennsylvania State University where he majored- in indus- trial engineering. Bill joined Western Electric as a planning engineer in November, 1951, at the Kearny Works in New Jersey. Later, he was assigned to the new Merrimack Valley Works in North Andover, Massachusetts, as a development engineer. Here Bill is shown leaving his attractive New England home for his-office while his wife, Barbara, and their daughter, Blair, watch. Bill's present assignment at Western Electric: the development of methods and machinery for assembling one of today's most promising electronic developments - electronic \pack- ages\ involving printed wiring. At a product review confer- ence Bill (standing) discusses his ideas on printed wiring assemblies with fellow engineers. :Bill and his supervisor, John Souter, test a machine they developed to insert components of different shapes and sizes into printed wiring boards. The small electronic packages prepared by this machine are being used in a new transistorized carrier system for rural telephone lines. Sailing off the north shore of Massachusetts is one of .Bill's favorite sports. He also enjoys the golf courses and ski runs within an easy drive from where he lives and works.

Dr. Blanton is a well known psychiatrist, .author, and educator. His background of studying, teaching, and writing comprises a long and impressive essentially evidence of Freud as a man. 'The small, frail Freud was a quarter bald, with his face cov- ered by a gray beard. His hands were thin, with blue v.eins show- ing on them. The picture is yet more pathetic, for, as a result of a cancer operation, Freud had to wear a metaol Jllate in place of his .cheek bone, which caused him constant pain and discomfort. Speech was dif.fiCLtlt for the orig- inator of psychoanalysis, ·and he expressed the affirmative, the negative, agreement, and d-is- agt·eement .by making distinct noises in his throat.

There weve some L ------------------------~------' threads unifying the pages of The Captive Audience Discussion o.f the usefulness of Union's present cut system by the Student Council has repeatedly brought out the point that cut rules seem to have lost whatever charm they may once have had. What once appeared a. sacred cow may have become a white elephant. It has bee:n argued that cut rules tend to lessen the dramatic effectiveness of lecturers by assuring them a steady, if drowsy audience. It has also bee:n argued that the student himself, being responsible for his own grades, should be resp<Jnsible for the means by which he obtains his grades-in other.,..words, for his class attendance. But, when. all is said and done, the question of cut- rule res·olves ·itself into a question of whether or not the Faculty Council is willing to vote them out of existence. Such a move was taken years ago by our neighbors at RPI, and a free-cut system has been operating- there for a number of years. Since the introduction of this system at Rensselaer, tilere has been no significant increase in the number of washouts. There has been, in fact, a general tendency towa.l'd higher grades and a crowded Dean's list. Last week, Trinity College announced the abolishing af its cut-syste1n and drowned all eff01is to enforce class attendance. Here, as at RPI, the faculty was the decisive factor in bringing about this laudable change. Union's Faculty Council will next meet during the first weeks of May, and will, it is presumed, discuss the question here raised. Let us hope that reason will here prevail and that an unwieldy device may not emerge a stolid tradition. JES For Your Information Friday, Ai»il 19.

Contrasting the manner of the contemporary psychoanalyst with that of Freud, Dr. Blanton took every opportunity to poke fun at, if not to t:ebuke, the contempor- ary. The second thread was the descriptil>n of Freud the ml).n, in- cluding both physical and per.son- a!itv characteristics. Lastly, Dr. Blanton included within llis anec- dotes, and as points of his dia- logues, the numerous contribu- tions of Freud, the scientist. Perhaps misinterpreting, and perhaps misunderstanding the founder of the therapeutic prac- tice of psychoanalysis, contem- porary analysts have come td add a rigidity and silence (or mys- tery> to analysis. Dr. Blanton continually illustrated a far dif- ferent approach to analysis used by Freud, which included friendly discourse, comments, a degree of direction, and a sense of humor. Freud was described as being \de- tached,\ a necessary position for the analyst to assume, yet not having a \cold fish\ attitude . .Ac- cording to .Dr. Blanton's remem- brance, F'reud always had a \cor- dial, friendly manner\ wllich won the admiration and affection of his patients, yet did not Interfere with the strained and tedious pro- cess of analysis. There seems, to Dr. Blanton, tc, have dev~loped a narr01vness in contemporary psychoanalysis that has a definite effect on the pa- tient. 'The strained interperscmal relationship of analyst and patient is often met with what is called \resistance which is an uncon- scious desire to delay or escape from the analysis or a given part of the analysis. This is manifest- ed in varied ways. Dr. Blanton accuses the contemporary analyst of calling all motives \resistance\ so repetitiously that \. . , you get so sick of it, you want to spit in their eye.\ of those plays whose stagillg You (Beckett) lmow and do not problems are ex<:eeded only by the lmow what it is to act or suffer. problems of the audience in dis- You l•now and do not li:now, that cerning what the staging is all actin~:\ is sulfei:ing-, and suffering about, Whence these difficulties:? action.

But the fact that the conflict of this both a.re fixed ii1 an eternal ac- bit of sacerdotal stagecraft is of tion, an eternal patience to which the inner rather than the outer all must consent that it may be variety. Inner conflict, of course, willed and which all must suffer has been fairly standard Thespian that they may Will it, that the equipment since the days of an- pattf)rll ,may subsist, that the· other Englishman (a genuine wheel may tllrtl and yet be for\ one), W. Shakespeare. It has be- ever ,still. In any discussion· of a great man, the contributions of that man must be shown as a vital as- pect of his life. Freud is popu- larly known in association with many things. The \Freudian slip\ is eagerly looll:ed for by most col- lege students who have had as little as an intlJoduction to psy- chology. \ISy-mbols\ and \acci- dents\ are K!arefi.Illy scrutinized by many who are briefly aware of Freudian psychology to indi- cate their interest, to advertise their awareness, and as a popular affectation. Blanton illustrated the importance of Freud's work in two major areas: (1) the dif- ferentiation <>f conscious and un- conscious, and (2) the develop- ment of therapeutic methods. Regarding the laying open of the unconsciiYUS in psychoanalysis Freud was quoted as having call- ed for \ .. , free flow .of the ·un- conscious\ with the patient not feeling responsible for, and not passing moral judgment on, the unconscious. Dr. Blanton illus- trated the importance of dreams in psychoanalysis, as the activity in which the individual does not repress those impulses prohibited by society. Dr. Blanton explained that as one grows up, one is forced to repress ,moore and more, until one \ll.aNlly has anything left.\ Dreams are, therefore, a pleasant retreat from social con- formity. The \scientific detach- ment\ of the scientist, Freud, was reconciled with his cordiality and friendliness. It is unfortunate that some of the students attending the lec- ture, expecting a technical ex- planation of the dynamics of Freud's psychology, were disap- pointed. Per:baps Dr. Blanton will be invited back to Union to ful- fill the expedations of those en- thusiastLc students of psychology. .As a centennial celebration--as a remembrance of a great man- Dr. Blanton's speech was appro- priate. His skill at retelling his experiences, and his ability to use Freud's words, captured the atten- tion of his audience, and resulted in numerous gratifying chuckles. come more or less commonplace .A tricky bit of prose, this.

The poet, no his- tory book, has here chosen to give the case a slightly different inter- pretation. His own interpretation is a canonical one, one which con- fers the crown of sainthood upon the martyr's head. His handling of this ecclesiastical notion is deft and poetic, if his meanings are not at once clear and understand- able.

Draft, Reserve Survey This is the second part ~f a three part surv-ey of the present draft and reserve system. The in- formation incOI'Jll)rated is the re- sult of a. study cBnducted by The Harvard Crl.Ins<Jn MJ.d published in their issue of March 27, 1957. If one aspires to be an officer, the reserves at'e not the organiza- •tlons to join, ROTC being the main route to a commission for the college student, the reserves will be getting- more and more officers returning from active duty and already have an over- supply. The other method of fulfilling one's military obligation is to join the National Guard. For men over 181,2, there is a six- month progt•arn similar to that of the Reserves, Involving 5¥.. years of ready Guar{i reserve. This is the only Guud category which has the standard six-year total military obligation. The Guard also offers oppor- tunity for becoming an officer within the Guard's framework. The .Air National Guard offers the 11-week plan for men under 1872 and a six-month plan for those over 18¥... The plan for those over 18¥..-25 year age group involves only 4lh years of ready reserve and one year in standby. One of the most important points in most of these reserve and Guard programs is that one may postpone active-duty train- Ing for as long as 120 days after enlistment, thus enabling people who enlist now under the pro- grams which expired on April 1 to complete their college year be- fore going into the program on an active ·basis. In the past the ready reserve training program has had very little control over its members, but recent legislation has put some teeth into the· requirement that one must attend 48 drills per year and two weeks of summer Thy Children's Chorus · By Hans Groot Perhaps some of the college family remember the article on Union -which appeared in the August. 1950, issue o.f Holiday Maga.zinc, The story was enti- tled \Spook's Tour.\ It seems that a section of our campus~up near the site of the new ,field house-is haunted. \Holiday\ tells of a beautiful Dutch girl named .Alice VanVeer who wa.s very popular -with Sche- nectad:y boys in the 1670's. Her father, a surly recluse, discour- aged all the suitors but one, a young grocer who courted the beautiful Alice for months. Suspicious of his daughter's long evening 'walks, old VanVeer followed her one summer evening in 1672. He stalked tile lovers, waited until they sat down on the banks of what is now the col- lege brook, then crept up behind and shot the grocer dead. Neigl::t,bors were aroused by the shot and the girl's screams, and search parties were sent out into the woods. VanVeer, dragging his daughter by the al'm, was caught at the intersection of Church and Union ,streets and within an hour burned at the stake. In the confusion, .Alice broke away., but the enraged mob overtook her in the oak grove which bulldor;ers have now been levelling for the field house. There, unjustly ·accused of luring the young grocer in his death. .Alice was tied to a tree and burn- ed. The first fllll moon of the sum- mer looked down on Alice's death agonies. Now whenever the moon is full, her ghost can be seen re- enacting events that led to her death. At least, that is the way the legend goes, and files in the recorder's office do reveal that George Overacker, the campus cop, has, for two years in the past five, reported screams in the college woods and a strong odor of smoke on certain nights dur- ing the month of June, Who kno-ws but what the fore- going circumstances may give Union yet another distinction- the only haunted field house on a college campus. camp.

Second, the work area was exactly what I was looking for- transistors and their application to computer systems.\ Bob entered IBM's voluntary training program in June, 1955, where he studied the entire organization, its divisions and diversified products. He received technical training in com- puter logic, programming, and com- ponents such as transistors, cort'ls and tapes. By September, half his day was being devoted to an actual project; by the following March, he was on this project full time ... Our job was The \small-group\ approach.fa research to transistorize six servo-amplifiers for the MA-2 bombing-navigational system,\ he recalls, \and we com- pleted the project in April.\ In IBM Research (as in all IBM) Bob works in a small group. \Our team consists of three E.E.'s and a technician. We start with analysis and synthesis work involving math and systems logic.

The bill, brought up by Lynn Hinman, proposes that freshmen and sophomores remain under the present \obscure system;\ but that juniors and seniors be given un- limited cuts. Also, it suggests that each professor should submit to the Dean's Office the name of any junior or senior who misses more than tbree successive olasses without notification. This will inform the college of the whereabouts of the student and is not intended to limit cuts. The proposal was seconded by Karl Meyers and will be submitted to the Faculty Council at Its MJJ.y meeting. Among the other measures dis- cussed at the Council meeting, was a suggestion by Anthony Cesta of possible new areas to be reviewed at tbe Tippacanoe Conference.

A New Plateau For many years American educators have been com- menting fretfully on the negative aspect of learning in this country. This neg·ative .aspect appears saddeningly in the attitude of the student who refuses to risk mental strain for'the sake of higher than passing grades. :\lerely passing grades will gain him the same AB or BS degree that is handed on commencement day to his A-level fellow student. One positive deterent to such negativism is the exist- ence of the Dean's list, which, with its cut privileges and prestige value, provides a high-level plateau for high-level achievement. But at the Dean's list level the same problem of negatism 1·eoccurs-on a more exalted plane. Students who attain Dean's list status with a 3.0 index or there- abouts often refrain from exe1ting the mental power neces- sary to go beyond this point-for want of a higher achieve- ment goal. This week, under the aegis of the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi chap.tet's of Union College, the higher achieve- ment goal has come into being. The two honor societies have announced their co-sponsorship of a new award, a certificate, to be distributed each year to students who have, during that year, maintained an average index of .J.A or better. Recipients of these certificates will, in future years, be designated \Eliphalet Nott Scholars,\ after the founder of the original award (Page Four, Column Two). The creation of this new elite force in campus scholar- ship may not necessarily transfonn Union College into a hotbed of Rhodes scholars, but it may at least contribute to the resuscitation of Union's acade~ic corpse.

Director Alexander Hall has filmed this fantasy using humor a.t the expense of heaven. .Joe, a championship boxer, is mis- takenly given a ticket to heaven fifty years ahead of schedule. When he finds himself in the \be- yond\ he is rather abashed since he had been anticipating a cham- pionship fight. He manages, how- ever, to find himae1f another body and his soul is returned to earth so be can fulfill his ambitions. Robert Montgomery as the prize· characters :and story throughout the 1941 production, never resort- Ing to trick photograj)'hy or slap- stick methods. The film !'inds much of its success simply through the convincing •behavior of the characters in the prize fi·gh:te,r's return from heaven. The whole situation is treated as though it were the most natural course of events a prizefighter's 'life could f<Jllow. .A:s a result, tho viewer finds himself in the posi- ti<>n of a believer. Not once, through all of Joe's hilarious mis- adventures does the film falter in to the obviou.s ma:ke ,believe in script, direction or performance. Mr. Hall has spun an upr!Jar- iOU!!ly humorous tale that moves from heaven to earth and back without ever breaking its spell. VQ1'E for C::\..AS S OFFICE.RS / And now a word .froln my opponent . \Murder\: Review By Forrest Read It's too bad T. S. Eliot didn't ask Ezra Poun<l to blue pencil Mu.rder in the Cathedral the way he did The Waste Land. Pound might have made it into some- thing. Last night in St. George's Church, howeve1·, the ·'Mounte- banks did what they •could to pull s01ne pretty recalcitrant language off the page. Wliere the play had real drama and believable spirit- ual struggle, they put it on feet. But there ·were long stretches of drought where Mr. Eliot strings together for his chorus encyclo- pedic lists and definite articles (\the living lobster, the crab, the oystel\ the whelk and the prawn\ for example-sonorously). I sup- pose he hopes to drag sinners to God by the guts, but loads of symbols don't make a good play. Still Frank Micarelli as Thomas Be.cket, though he didn't really establish the archbishop as a com- manding presence until his ser- mon, caught the rhythm both of Mr. Emot's verse and of martyr- dom in the stirring second act. In the sermon Mr. Micareiii spoke the a;gony of a man who knows his impending death, but whe> is on the verge of accepting it. His last speech to the women of Can- terbury (\Pea.ce and be at peace with your thoughts and vision,\ etc.) rang true with the sureness of his calling. The knights stalke.d up the aisle with just the right air of naughty boys trying to outface their mis- deeds. Jack Watson, AI Katz, and Robert Abrams all were witty and properly sophistical as they justified killing the arch- bishop for the good of the state. Their strongarm master of cere- monies, Howard Goldstock, played his bluff part heartily. Beside Thomas, the most im- pressive single character was Wil- liam Herman. A magnificently- costumed fourth tempter, he tries to make Thomas not accept mar- tyrdom as God's will, but rather will it for his own personal glory and a victory from the tomb. He handled the tricky verse with sus- tained flexibility and wit, and with tone and gesture wo·ve a web around Thomas which only a real saint could have evaded. J·ohn Lott expressed well a canny up- start English baron who offered to raise rebellion against King Henry. Jesse Bidansett and Charles Enzer played the other tempters. David Atherton and .John Minor tripped on the verse as two priests, while Alan Shucard was able to fill and control it better as the third. Michael Berkman heralded without the comedy in- herent in his. part. Although in its .human action the play has a powerful theme, it too often becomes pretentious as drama and makes religion propa- ganda. It is primarily the chorus which inflates the drama and de- stroys the feeling of real connec- tion between religion and life. Perhaps it is possible to pro- duce, which Marion McKendree, Mabel Farrell, 'Martha Goldho:ff, and Harriet McMuiiin did not, the awesome effects of a Greek chorus or a medieval morality play. But I dou.bt it. The lan- guage is stuffed, extended, and monotonous, and always threatens to drown the action. It suggests that Mr. Eliot never looked into what he calls \the guts of the women of Canterbury'' from any• where but down his nose. Colorful costumes against a black set, and use of the pulpit and a simple altar, provided stark, moving atmosphere. The characters used well the different levels of the stage to support the inner drama.

What does a fellow like John Jackson do all day? In his own words, \I keep in touch with the executives of many different companies-advising them on the use of their IBM electronic data processing computers. I person· ally consult with these customers, and analyze their scientific and tech· nical problems for solution by IBM. Occasionally, I'm asked to write papers, and give talks and .demon· strations on electronic computing. All in all, it's pretty fascinating ... something new pops up every day.\ In other words, John is a full-fledged computing expert, a consultant ••• ana a very important person in this Calling on a customer coming age of automation through electronics. Since the IBM laboratories are always devising easier and faster ways to solve the problems of science, gov- ernment, and industry, an Applied Science Representative can never say he's learned his job and that's the end of it. At least once every two months, he attends seminars to be updated on the latest developments in engineering and .operations research. Introduces new methods During the two years that John has spent with IBM in Applied Sci· ence, he has guided innumerable IBM customers to new and better ways of doing things electronically. For ex- ample: about a year ago, a leading aircraft manufacturer wanted to ex- periment with a radically different design for a nuclear reactor. Although the basic format had been established, the projectsti.ll required manyrnonths of toil with mathematical equations. What,a MATHEM:ATICfAN can do at IBM Mathematics -is an ancient but ever-advaJ:lCi~g science that c;ontains many forms. It shouldn't surprise you then that i1- loci< some time before John Jackson discovered the one brand of m~ihem~:dics that seemed custom- tailored to his ability and temperament. John is an Applied Science Repre- sentative, working out of the IBM office at 122 East 42nd Street, N. Y. C. The aircraft people decided that they couldn't afford to wait that long, .so they called in IBM •. After disc-ussion with top executives, John helped to map out a computer program that saved the organization over 100 days mathematical background in -both of those a.l'eas. It was not until he was int(;lrviewed by IBM that field com- puting -whetted his scientific appetite. A few months later, John launched his ()wn IBM career as an Applied Science trainee. Promotion wise, John has come a -long way -since that time. He's now an Applied Science Representative in one of the busiest, most responsible · offiCEs 1n the IBM org!).nization •• , mid-to-wn Manhattan. Mapping out a compuier program of pencil-chewing, nail-'biting arith- metic. Later, for this same company, John organized the establishment of computer systems for aircraft per- formance pre~ctions • • • for data reduction of wind tunnel tests ... and for wing stress analysis. At the same time, he worked with this company's own employees, training them in the use of IBM equipment. John still drops around to see that everything is running smoothly. Another service that John performs is the constant reappraisal of each customer's IBM operation. Occasion- ally, a customer may tie himself in knots over a procedural \stickler.\ Periodically, in fact, John brings IBM customers together ..• just to talk over what's happening in each other's business......:how everybody else handled that old bugaboo in any industry .•• details. New field for Mathematicians John is exercising his mathematical know.-how in a field that was prac- tically unheard of ten years ago. Even now, this kind of work may be news to you. It was to John Jackson a few years back when he was an under- graduate at the University of Colo· rado. At that time, he was considering aetuarial work or mathematic!).l re- search. But John liked the ex:citement and diversification of science atid in- dustry and he wanted tG use his . \' Witll his_wife, Katherine, and daughtel\ Lisa, 20 months, and John, Jr.~ 6 weeks, he enjoys his suh11:rban Port 'Waship.gton home. lie's happy and he's satisfied. And then, too, John knows a few vital st!l.tistiCE1 about IBM .• , such as the fact that the Applied Science Division has quad- rupled during the past three years, and tlla.t in 1956 alone, over 70 pro- motions were conferred.
