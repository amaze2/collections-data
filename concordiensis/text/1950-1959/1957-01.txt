The Five Dukes of Dix:ie·wi:Jl add to the Winter Weekend festivities with a j JlZZ concert. Both events will take place in Alumni Gymnasium. Although Anth;:my's group will p-lay at the Mardi 'Gras dance for the £eoond consecutive year,. the F'ive Dukes will be making their first appearance at Union. iA. relatively ne.w band, the Dixie- land five has ·met with success performing at co.lleges in the Bos- ton area.

Each fraternity will sub.rnit a picture of its nominee for hoanely honors. Final decision as to the winner may be made through a vote of all attending the dance. The pictures will be tacked up near the entrance and each couple will vote as they enter. The wln- ne!' will receive a prize. In spite of the fact that $60 more was spent for the Five Dukes than last year's jazz· group, the price of tickets will remain at $2.50 a couple. No split tickets will be sold. Fraternity booths, for both events in the gym, will cost $15. A dance king and queen will be pleked on the basis of the best costume. Door prizes will be dis- tributed. Weather conditions permitting, a snow sculp-ture contest will be lleld with a trophy awwded to the winning house. otherwise there will be no display contest. ---o--- Five Get Awards In Science Field Five sep.iot•s majoring in science and engineering were recently aw·arded student memberships ln the A;merican Society for Testing 'Materials as a reward for high scholarship and interest in the testing material field. Recehting the awll.l\ds wet•e: Ladislav Berka., chemistry major; Paul Mohr, mechanical engineer; Wendell Neugebauer, electrical engineer; Rand Warner, electrical engineer, and Ronald Stevens, civil engineer. The five awards were made pos- sible through a gift from Dr. Ru· dolph A. Schatzel of Rome, who graduated from Union in 1921. Dr. Schalzel is Vice President and Director of Engineering for the Rome Cable Corporation and is cttrrently serving as President of the ASTIM:.

Orange Juice and Rolls One of the several problems at Union which seems to come up repeatedly is the food situation at the college dining halls, especially, as of late, the West College Cafe- teria. A look at the recent criticism of the service there may serve to throw some badly needed illumination on the entire situation. In the fall of 1953, the price or orange juice led to an investigation of the college dining halls. With a small glass of fruit juice costing 15c, the Concordiensis led the fight to lower charges. Opening \Bill North's Cafeteria\ in front of Bailey Hall to compete with William South, then manager of the West College dining hall, the news- paper sta.ff sold orange juice at 5c a glass and made both headlines and a profit. As a result of the C'oncordy cru- sade, an investigation was held which revealed that the cafeteria was operating at an annual Joss amounting to thousands of dollars. And finally, South was given charge of the Hale House Cafeteria, while Joseph Fleischman came to take over at West. Thl,} language barrier, before Le Million, had limited the show- ing of sound films to the areas in which the tongue of the pro- duction was spoken. Foreign language titles were not used at this time. Clair overcomes tWs barrier using two devices. First he cn•at<'d a ::;o~1nd imn.2;e in counterpoint to the visual one. His infinitely human characters act so well and speak with such emotional impact that the plot is almost entirely clear without a translation. However, Glalr aids in the understanding of the plot by placing two English speaking actors on a roof near the room where the action transpires. They explain the story in English. Clair has placed them effectively, so that they do not interfere with the continuity of the film. The glittering ·production is set in Paris and features ·a wild chase through that city in search of a jacket which holds a 1,000,000 florin lottery ticket. The story deals with a struggling young al'tist who is being besieged by his creditors until they hear a. news hawker announce that Michel, the artist, has won a lot- tery. They run up to the room where he has left a jacket which holds the winning ticket. In this scene the creditors burst into Attempts to find the garment, whilch has been given to a crook, are farcical. The chase leads the artist to an opera house in which a clever buffoonery of opera is presented. ~e picture is filled with unexpected ideas apart from t);le doing of the characters. The activities of the hunters strewh the suspense almost to the break- ing point. In portraying tbe action, Clair tends to jump from scene to scene. He does permit the char- acters to clarify the action, how- ever. In his t:arlier prodl . .,Uons this sh·ipping about had been re- sponsi•ble for a lac::• of continlli- ity. The music also helps keep the picture moving as a unit. It is \\.Oven into the plot so that the mood of the accompanying action is strengthened. Hollyy,ood type stunts are ridi- culed as the action moves t:> a police station and Michel is r.. ds- takenly identified as the criminal who has posses.sion O'f the miss- ing jacket. A friend rt>fuses to identify the unhappy artist hop- ing to get the re111ard by finding the missing ticket himself. The typical huxlesque of luo.v. grade HollY'I'.Ood movies is seen VI ith French V\it and .cleverness. Although the film was scorned ·by intellectuals of the 1930''>, it was warmly received ·by the pU!b- lic in both London and Ne.w- Yo_rk. It is today considered· a landmarlu In the history of b.>th sound and International film making. Campus Cullings A legend has begun at RPI n seems that one Mike Smith lost his slide rule in its green case. He posted several signs on vari- ous bulletin boards in order to re- cover his valuable property. It seems also that there lives at R PI one quiet, unassuming f·resh- man, named Gideon Nettler, from Queens, NeW' York. One of Gideon's friends (of which he had several at the time) decided that Jeere was his chance for a little joke. He posted an- other sign next to one of 'Smith's.

Within a year or so, however, the two had swapped roles. It was said that Duncan Hines, himself, would enjoy a meal at Hale House, while things at West Golleg·e were as bad as ever, if not worse. Since that time, the gripes about the food at West have been steadily on the increase. They reached a maxi- mum recently, when a group of fl'eshmen decided to warm up for the baseball season using- rolls and patties of butter instead of baseballs. We \vere glad to hear that members of the freshman class instigated the bombardment, be- cause we would have begun to question our sanity if per- sons with sense and maturity were behind it. As a result it surprises many RPI students to find out tha.t this fabulous character actually exists.

Freshman President Robe1t Tomlin's investigation of conditions has been well handled and has resulted in improvement of s~rvice. If he keeps at it until he is satisfied that things are xunning as best they can be, he will have done a service for future frosh as well as his own class. V:e have chided the freshman class somewhat only to :po:nt out that there are two sides to the food story. Certamb·, the food served could be better and there could ?e more of it, but management has its problems also. It IS only when these are brought out into the open and dis- c~ss:d logically rather than emotionally that the situation will Improve.
