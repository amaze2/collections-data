It will be staged ten times in the eleven day run, with no show being presented Monday, April 25. Curtain . time will be promptly at 8:00. The box office is now open and tickets can be purchased any day between 1:00 and 9:00. Student ·tickets will be given upon the pres- entation of Student Activities cards. The regular admission fee is $1.50, · date tickets being obtainable for $1.00 for all performances except those on Friday and Saturday nights. Recreates Past This play i.s in line with the Mountebank tradition of presenting at least one classical drama each year. Othello fulfills one of the primary oblig>ations of the society which is, according to Dr. Gifford Wingate, to recreate the past so that it will have greater meaning for the audience. Philos Qualify For. US Debating Finals Two major changes in the usual staging techniques have appeared in the lighting syst!ml and stage design. The lighting is more elab- orate than in the past. By employ- ing single pools of light on differ- ent parts of the stage, a wide vari- ety of sets can be obtained with- out numerous shiftings of sceneTy. The sets required for the play's three acts were· designed by Lin Swearingen. The stage design Is also quite novel In that part of the stage itself ex.tends into the theater giving a semi-arena effect. This arrangement will contribute to the audience's feeling of contact with the pair and will heighten the dra- :tr.(atic impact. Costumes for the play will be rented from the Eaves Costume Agency, and some of these will come from former Broadway plays. Rilburn Plays Moor Professor PatriCk Kilburn Is fea- tured in the title role of the pride- ful MD<or. Carol Newkirk ap- pears as his victimized wife, and Iago. the perpetrator of the many horrible occurrences of t!he play and the very embodiment of evil will be portrayed by Walter Stark: The parts of Cassie, Emilia and Rodcrigo will be played by Martin Stein, Marion McKendree and Saul Babb!n, respectively. Dr: Wingate who IS both the faculty adviser and directo1· of the Mountebanks is re- ?ponsible for n:any of the changes m the style of presentation of the drama. The play Is ztow in the last week of rehearsal and Is nearing the · final stages of preparation. The actors are now concentrating on ?ID10ot~in~ out the rough edges, and 1n ac')J1ev1ng g:reater finesse in the int~rpretation of their roles, Calvin Kmckerboeker, President of the Mountebanks, expects that tile act- ing: staging, and d:irecting talents which have entered into the forth- coming production will combine to form a play that will be well worth seeing. ..,.

The era of the hour exam has been replaced by a fiO minute exam, theoretically. But between theory an~ fact in manv cases lies 10 to 20 minutes. get but do their best to avoid? It seems to me that it would raise college standards amazingly if col- lege admissions policies were made a good deal more stringent, and if colleges and universities admitted only a fraction of the number that they now admit annually, Of course, this plan would leave out in the -cold a lot of opeople M•ho feel they have to go. to college, or ----------------~--~ at least be collegiate for four years cr so. To remedy this situation, I suggest the establishn.ent. closely following the present geographiral distribution of the colelges and uni- versities now: in existence, of a nuzDber of Extracurricular Activi- ties Centers, the nwr.lber of .owhose \undergraduates\ wuuld exactly equal the current number of col- leges in the country, multiplied by the fraction of '~:allege students !Who never get elected to Phi Beta K!lippa, Sigma Xi, and similar hon- orary c1Societies. In thi's. way, Union College, for instance, would be at- tended rby a greatly reduc-ed num- ber of enthusiastic scholars, w•hile Its sister Extracurricular Activities Center, (.preferably loca:ted at Sara- toga), wrould 'be attended by those p-eople who couldn't make the .grade a.t Union, and they 'W'ould find the living conditions at Union EAC closely approximating the living conditions of old Union, but Vlfth- o\Ut the dirty grinds. This •w!Ould be a virtu.al Utopia.. Nothing but ex- tracurricular activities, and in the evenings, some sort of orgiastic celebration, for the sheer joy of living. Upon having completed four years at an IDAC, a person would receive a diploma stating that the holder had successfully completed four years of gracious living, and 'WQUld receive lifetime subscriptions to Holida<y, EsqUire, and llie, in addition to the solutions to all the cross-word puzzles in The Sunday New York Times for the next fifty years. EAC graduates would be in tre- mendous demand in all fields. Hav- ing shown their remarka'b·le social adaptability, these graduates 'V\\'()Uld be snapped up by corporations and big .business, in order to fosfer pub- lic relations. And the graduates of old-fashioned colleges and univer- sities would receive the ibenefit of what WoQuld ·probably amount to in- dividual instruction, and they also IW>Ould •be snapped up by corpora- tions and big 'business, not to men- tion graduate schools and industry. Aiter all, they •would be the cream of the crop. Sounds like a pretty fair idea to me. I hope ·that educators all over: the country realize the value of my suggestions. It would solve a lot of problems. 'Not infrequently during the yea1· students have arrived at 50 minute noon exams to hear the p1·octor announce a one hour time limit, possibly even with the boon of an additional five minutes at the end. :Many departments have not taken cognizance of the fact that the exams are supposed to last for a period of titi1e almost 20 percent shorter than an hour. Cornell Questions ROTC Another ptoblem that arises in connection with exams concerns tests given during regular class hours. Some pro- fessors allow students to continue writing well into the next class period, leaving those with a class following the exam with the disadvantage of having· less time than their class- mates. We suggest that noon hour exams sta1t promptly at 12 o'clock, rather than several minutes after. The ptoctor should have the perogati\\e to extend the exam to 12:55 if he deems it necessan.', since planning exams to the minute is difficult. At that time, howevel', the exam should stop. The same sort of 50-55 minute basis should hold for class room tests also, v.o:ith all students being requir€d to stop writing at five to ten minutes before the hour. Above all, though, the faculty should plan 50 minute tests, not hour exams. E. S. L. Eighth Semester Finals At the next meeting of the Student Council, discussion will begin on the subject of excused absences from final exams for those seniors having a \B\ averag-e in any course. We support the proposal of Albert Barsamian for the following reasons. With graduation and Senior Weekend in the making, there is much for the individual senior to do at the time finals come. Those headed for g-raduate schools have no practical needs for the grades;. those striving for honorary societies have had their ad-intedm marks used as the basis for admissions. Either seventh semester grades or those at ad-interim of the eighth semester form the basis on which representatives choose their future employees. The administration may very well find seniors working overtime to achieve the \B\ average which, we·,hope, will excuse them from an unnecessary formality during their last days at Union. M. D.Z. Aroused by the recently irroposed<S>--------~-----­ loyalty oaths attendant on parti- cipation in the mandatory ROTC program, the students at Cornell University have acted to replace the program <with a voluntary one. The following story was· taken from The Harvard Crim.son. Student opposition to corr.puisory ROTC at Cornell will reach its ell- max on A:pril 20, v. hen the entire student body votes in .a special re- ferendum on wnether or not ROTC training should be mandatory, Ever since the passage of the Morrill Land Grant Acts in the 1860's, . COI'I1ell has had compulsory two-year m-ilitary training for all physically fit male undergraduates. The provisions of the Acts force Cornell to offer ROTC courses, but d.o not compel.the school to make the couxses mandatory, ( Student groups, headed by the Student Council and the Cornell Daily Sun, have led a drive to make ROTC .tl'aining purely ·volun- tary. The campaign was instigated principa:lly by the recent law which forces every ROTC student to sign a loyalty oath, stating that he has never belonged to a swlJ.versive or·· ganization. This, students charge, is unwarranted government inter- ference In education. Theoretically, if ~ student ref.uses to sign the oath he 'Wiould be sub- ject to ell;pulsion, i!J.ut in reality, only one student has not signed so far and he sits in a \9pecfa.1\ cla.;;s lL!ld is given t>rivate logistic in- struction. The two() faoc-ulty committees in- volved in the ROTC squabble, The Committees on Military Curricula and Requii·en:ents for Graduation, have so far supported i;4e stab-1s quo, and will recomn:end no change to the Faculty in May. HowEtver, the Student Council, un- animously supporting a change, hl!-S .planned the referendum to present th.e students' reaction. The Colloquim sponsored .by Divisions I and II will hold its third meeting of the second sen:ester on Monday, April 18, 1955 at 4:00 P.M. in Bailey Halt 202.

You all know how many of these promiseS are kept after his election to office. In my opinion there is only one promise that can and should be made by any and every candidate for any office . . . this is the promise to do the best job that he pD'ssibly can, as the cir- cumstances that arise dictate him to do. This, my f~llow students, is specifically what I intend to do should you see fit to elect me to the office of :President of the class of 1957. I firmly believe that a function of active community membership should be an understanding of the objectives, ramifications, and limi- tations of the ·public service. An aspirant for campus office must be cognizant of this function. By way of analysis as applicable to the Presidency of the Senior Class, may I remind you that our executive officer must; 1. arrange for the effective per- formance of Class Day, 2. act as liason officer between the ClaJSS and the Administra- tion i):'l matters relative to I feel that I have the necessary q.ualifications for the job.

This last one is not a school <tctivity, l>ut it is one that was very bene- ficial to me. Is attendance required of all freshmen? How is attendance en- forced? Does orientation continue after classes have started? How n.any lectures, such as hygiene, his- tory of the college, etc. are given? Are freshmen dances. picnics, song fests held?

The Prom will be our first major undertaking- .and it llJiUst be a suc- CS'SS financially, as well as socially. It will determine w'hether tile Class of 1957 will be a Class to be proud of, q:r just another Class in the his- tory of Union. My sole and sincere purpose will be to make successful anything that the Class undertakes. We all know too well that without the ef- fort and interest of each member of our Class this can not . be ac- complished. We must work to- gether -as a Class on the Prom and on any other tasks w'hi~h canfront us. Vote for me and let us do it to- gether! A. Theodore Engkvist '57 Members of the class of 1957, if I am elected to the post of class president, I s'hall strive for better student government by doing every- thing I can to brill!g about a better understanding between the admin- istration and the student body. Also, I would like to see some ac- tion taken to raise the sc'hool spirit which, hi my estimation, is lacking at Union. This brief outline of my proposed program can only be achieved with your help -and the help of the stu- dent body. Many of you know me; for those who don't, my name is Ed Conaway. I am a resident of Sahenectady and went to Saint Co- lumbus Hig'h. I belong to the Kappa Alpha. Society, and Newman Club. I have played both freshman and va.rsity basketball here at Un.ion. I have experience in class government because I have been VicE;-President of my grad·uating class in high sc'hool. Re.member, your vote is impor- tant.

Albert Bal-samian '56 cently. * * * In this statement, I should tell you of my qualifications and urge you to vote for me. However, my main objective is to urge the mem- bers of the Junior ClaSs to achieve a true indicative ballot by having a maximum turn-out of voters. If a small number of votes are cast, one can easily see that an election can be won by a candidate who is sup- ported by a small · but organized block of voters. Yet, this Is not necessarily an indication of the true wishes of the class. We can only obtain correct and efficient representation in class government when the l}ntire class casts its vote. ED BOWER The class president is responsible for .appointment of committees or committee chairmen, incl-uding a norr.dnating committee and a re- union committee during reunion years, and for the general executive activities of calling meetings and checking the functions of other af- fairs. This is only the part that a presi- dent has to do. What he does be- sides this de(ermines v.hether or not he is a good president. Plan- ning things in advance will rr ake a lot of these extras 1JOSS~ble. Some of the activities and func- tions of our Senior Class are al- I'eady planned; hov.ever, improve- ments on these and on our other activities can be made. For instance, all seniors are taxed to pay for the senior dance, the class day booklet, refreshments for · class day and other expenses. This year's taxe 'WI!l.S $3.00. By placing an early order, and for a slight extra charge, each one of us owould receive ten printed graduation an- nouncements. By ordering early in the year, we could obtain very reasonably, wallet size pidures for job applications. The size and cost of our Senior Dance depends also entirely upon the wishes of the class. Recently, it has been semi- formal with a local, lnw priced band. There are many more things that we can do if we ·get a good start, and that depends upon our choice of a good president.

The Garnet track squad in five meets last season scored J A d 305 points, for an excellent average of 61 points per meet. 8 ·. nnounce The record of two victories and three losses ia misleading,. however, since each meet was • extremely close. The outlook for this year is not bright; 247 points of last year's out- put were seared by men who will not be with the team this year. The loss of last year's high po·int getters leaves the Garnet with a total of only 48 points. Thl\ ·greatest gap left by graduation occurs in the field events, with the Joss of high scorer Lenny Klingberg, who wound up with 53 points, and Ed O'Meally, with 48. The team this year will have some bright spots; AI McKinnon, whose 24 points placed him third in the scoring department, will be back. McKinnon will once again run the half mile. Coach Bill Ketz said that on days of ideal conditions McKinnon will run in just hiS specialty in order to give him every opportunity to break the school record of 1:57.8. T'he other prom- ising member of the team is soph- omore miler John Parillo·. Parillo was outstanding in his freshman year, and should partly compensate for the ]()SS of Don Stack. !\lichl·lslty Rf'tums The only returning letennan be- sides McKinnon will be Lee Michel- sky who will handle the 120 high, and the 220 low hurdle:;. Other re- turning members of last year's team will be AI Southwick, who with sophomores Bob Youngs and Al Cox, will thrQIW the javelin; Dick Schappert, who will compete in the shot put, discus, and jave- lin; and Dudley Woodberry in the pole vault and 120 high hurdles. The 440 will be run by Bob Smullins of Albany Pharmacy. Tom Murphy will return to compete in the sprints. The spi·inting depart- ment which ·has always been a sore spot will be d.eeper- than last year be-cause of the .addition of junior EJd Crotty. Crotty was last year's Intra-mural hundred yard champ.

Another Look at Chapels Prior to Spring \'acation, when the pros and cons of chapel behavior wet·c being Landied back and forth by the many interested parties, the CQncordiensis sug-gested that the chapel programs themselves \might well be made the subject of an inquiry by a student-faculty committee which would present sugge~tions to the Administration as to a pos- sible future path for the asseml..Jly system.\ We felt at that time, as we do now, that the opportunities offered the Union student in the way of evening lectures and recitals by men of ability ai'ldjor note, as part of this program, were sadly conspicuous hy their absence from campus. If Union is to continue blandly advertising itself as a \balanced college\ with equal emphasis placed on the arts and engineering, there is much ground that it must make up in advancing intellec- tual outlets for men in the former field. A school of our size can not pretend to compete for visiting figures with the likes of the large l vy univel'sities, but we ce1·tainly should hold our own among the many small colleges whose contemporary \Ve claim to be. Othello ls not -·the ea:siest of Shakespeare's plays fot• the actors. J.f it ts; less confused thfl;n Hamlet or less profound than Lear, it is probably more intense than either of them and derrmnds from the players, if they are to -give it its full vaJue,. a sustained and dl'iv-ing passion that sha:ll &weep the audi- ence inte> run unquestioning a~cept­ ance of the idea that perfect -integ- rity can be destroyed by perfect villainy. In The Mountebanks' per- formance of tl:,~:~ play last night there was rnuch to commend, but tto get the fault-finding over with at once) it often wavered in ;pitch; and though the meaning of the great drama came through clearly, and though ther.e were often e:8;cel- lent moments, these' carne occasion- ally instead of continuously, The killin& of Desdemona was finely done;\ the scene with Emiiia and Desdemona with the· \Willow S.c;mg\ was performed with charm and just the proper tO<Uch of humor needed to lighten momentarily the grimness of the tragedy; the scene in the Venetian Senate Chamber made a good _beginning. But the g!'eat seduction scenes of the Shakespeare's third act, where con· scious evil conupts na:ive goodness, did not carry the impact they should. As for the very eeal merits, one should mention first (!md praise) the courage of the director in el'ect- i·n-g to give the play uncut. It makes ;;t long evening, but it is always in- teresting. The scenes move swiftly, thanks to skillful use of lighting and an ima;ginatively contrived set. The movement of the characters on the stage is always lively. Profes· sor Wingate has not been afraid in his directing to let the action spill over from the small stage and bring the actoi'IS near to the audience. The result is a feeling of involve- ment in the tragedy such as one necessarily misses in conventional professional perfarmances. There is plenty of individual merit to be passed out. As Othello f'rofessot· KilbUrn was most effec- tive in the last scene. There are two Othello~s: the great general, who dominates the first part of the ,play, and the victim of Ia.go. They are almost two Q:iffeeent persons, and the actor must do justice to both of them. Professor Kilburn convinces us more ea;sily of the lat- ter. Walter Stark gives a consiste·nt and :believable interpretation of Iago, though he would do wen to speak hl•s lines more slowly, giving each one its value. Carol Newkirk presents a Desdemona of profes- sional stature, innocent and charmr ing but with de11ths in the char- acter which appear clearly in the latter scenes. The usually slighted -role of Emilia. is played with vivar city by Marion McKendree; she gave it a dimension and interest that are not often brought to it. Martin Stein gave proper dignity and manliness to the role of Cassia; Saul Ba:bbin made a believable Rod- erigo. Mention should also be made of Webster Caye in the smaller part of Brabantio, and -of Fred Hall as: Lodovico. Performances of Othello are rare. In this one the Union College Mountebanks have nothing to be ashamed of. Their intentions are fine, and their performance very nearly matches them. The common explanation tende1·ed for this sparsity of evening p1·ograms was that the money normally appropriated for such endeavors was used to underwrite Paul Bm·lin's stay this year. It was further felt by some segments of the Col- lege populace that the Administration had been quite upset over the several cancellations in last year's schedule, namely Arthur Koestler, Chester Bowles and Captain Cousteau, and did not wish to chance a repetition of these happenings. We strongly doubt this latter thevry. To the best of our knowl- edge, these three men \Vere unable to appear because of rea- sons of business, ot· because of inability to g·ain admission to this country, certainly not for motives that would cause the College to virtually abandon it·; pTogram. We believe that the sole incentive behind the Aclministl'<1tion's ~<Ction was the forementioned subsidization ot' ::\Ir. 13urlin. April Fools'? No, April6! In doing this, we feel that Pnion has failed both the stu- dent l.Jody and the eommunity by depriving them of one of its most vital functions,-tlH:t of frequently affording op- portunities to hem· authoritiEs and attists whose messages extend beyoncl the range an<l scope of that which one ac- quires in the classt·oom ot· on the job. It is too late for thiP> to l>e remedied in the coming weeks ui' sehoul. but we sug- gest that the crention of a P>tudent-faculty committee to in- vestigate the possibilities of next year's program would be a step in the 1·ight direction. Only by p1·ogressive action in the direction of presenting· stimulating visitors, can the col- lege hope to quell the growing cries of resentment against what many consider to be a Yery negative attitude toward the li'beral-arts. By Edward Langholz A \gag\ April Fools' Issue of the Rensselaer Polytechnic, RPI's stu- dent neV~.spaper. ttLrned out to be more serious than planned. and as a result. che paper is in the market for a new Senior Board. The -for- mer board members 11 ere forced to 1·esign by Dean Richard A. Waite, of the Institute. Dated Wednesdil:y, April 6, the .. gag\ 1ssue headlined the fact that RPI's Easter Vacation, due to be- gin the next day, was cancelled by a quarantine placed on the school by the Ne\.v Ym·k ·state Board of Health \due to the mysterious plague th.tt has been s11 eeping the freshman dorms and n any of the fraternity houses.\ According to the lead article, stu- dents were forbidden to enter any of the Troy stores and Red Cross units v. ere all set to move in. the all too real illness of 125 fresh- men, also reported in the paper, VI. ho had suifered food poisoning from a meal eaten in the freshman dining hali. The Senior Board, \.\·hich had planned the hoax in ad- vance, had not figured on such a coincidence. Upon their return f:rom vacation, Senior Board members v.ere called before the Dean and asked for their resignations. These were sub- mitted on Thursday, April 14. The associate board ;took over the pub- lishing of the paper. As a result, a faculty publications committee was organized to help determine -rroatters of policy and \instruct staff member in the finer points of jour- nalism.\ The Art of Raymond Parker. Color greets the visitor to Old Chapel Gallery. Moving; slo·w, fast, wohirling, vibrating and sorr etimes not moving at all. Parker presents a rich study in q;ll kind of color. He is modern; he has a modern ap- proach to art and to his mediu·m, oils on canvas. He is varied; his work ranges from the very pure simplicity of his few-color works to complex, almost elaborate, -studies of uncou.nta:ble colors. Parker's wor-k -is entirely non- representational-at )east -in regard to physical 'Objects-it is concerned solely ''h>ith color effects and rela- tionships. But there is no \arty\ iSolation in his art, it is thought and lived and, I think, believed in. This re'hards the vle,irer quite hand- somely. The whole exhibit has a strange revolving quality about it. One notices this when he first enters the room. .Appa:t·ently -this is achieved, at least p-artly, by revolv- ing the canva.q itself several times during the painting. This is the technique W<hich Peter Baruzzi uses.; it is interesting though, to note the great difference in effect which Parker accomplishes. Nearly all of Parker's paintings have a very definite hub which falls just slightly off the center of the can- vas, around this the color moves. Those works which are not done in this way are a ve1'tical sort of regularity and are, to rr:e, the rr:.ore satisfying.

Parker is a thinking artist; an essay of his exploring the .student- artist-teacher relationship is in the .gallery and bears reading. It is not (and certainly does, not ,purport to ·be) the last word on the subject, but it is a straight forward :;~tating of an artist'~ position. .Just how close he comes to livi-ng u-p to his 0'11·11 standards is an open question.

Whether we .. have succeeded will not be known until well into next term when a preliminary assess- ment of the new Council's work can first be made. We feel that the three classes voted wiselv in their selections for class presidents, all three victors heing per- sonalities who can play a dommant role in class and council affait·s. They all haw ambitious plans and deRerve the hack- ing of their classmates as such support can best be expressed through the election of a forceful Student Council· to set·ve with them. It is not necessary for us to point out that among the 61 candidates, there are many who are not run- ning for office with the idea of better student government as their prime motiYe. We trust that you will eliminate these people from consideration ·when casting your ballot. The complaints that have been echoed this semester, and they have been many, about the calibre and accomplishments of the Student Council are nothing more than hollow oaths if they are not backed by intellig-ent action at the polls.

If a firm in Birmingham, Ala.'ba.ma, wants to sell to someone in Schenectady, it cannot charge more than that price.

Young manager handl:es finances for ·building of $5,000,000 .plant 1l DICK FETTER joined G.E. in·.l947 after receiving a B.S. from Bucknell Uni- versity, and serving 32 months in the Air Corps. At G.E. he completed the Business Training Course, class of '49. In the next ten years, the demand for General Electric industrial heating equipment will double. To meet this demand, a giant new plant (model at right) is :being built at Shelbyville, Indiana. The plant will cost $5,000,000, and the man responsible for handling finances for the entire job is 32-year-old H. E. Fetter. Fetter's job is important, responsible Dick Fetter's work as Financial Manager of the Department began long :before General Electric started building the plant. He and his group first had to estimate probable op- erating costs and predict whether the plant would be profitable. Now, during construction~ Fetter's chief. concern is keeping track of all the expenses on this rrililtimillion-dollar project. When the plant is completed, he will set up a complete financial section and manage everything from tax, cost, and general ac- counting to payrolls, budgets and measure· ments,.and internal auditing. 25,000. college graduates at General Electric This is a big job. Fetter was readied for it in a careful step.by-step program of devel- opment. Like Fetter, each of the 25,000 col- lege-graduate employees is given his chance to grow, to find the work he does best, and to realize his full potential. For General Electric has long believed this: When young, fresh minds are given freedom to make prog· ress, everybody benefits-the individual, the company, and the country. Vol. 8~ Sp ·1' . p Jion.

The Candidates Speak The Concordiensis, in coopemtion with the Student ~ouncil Electi~n Committee, requested of each of the nom- mees for ~resident of the Council, a statement of his plat- fot:m or mms, preparerl either by himself, or by his cam- paign manager. We feel that the choice of a Council Presi- 'dent is of s~ch great !mp?rtance to the student body, that we are devotmg our editorial columns this week to the candi- dates statements. They follO\v: Stephen Holbrook Wednesday you are going to the polls and electing a new president of the student body. What are you, Mr. Dutchman, looking for in a President? Who can better pz·e- side, Steve or John? Who has the drive a.nd initiati\·e to do some real \putting on\ of a prograrr, Steve or John? Difficult questions? Yes, but there are indications and we believe pretty clear indications, that Steve is the rr.an. Both John and Steve have had previous student government ex- perience, both W<Juld fulfill the basic essentials of the office, but here the similarity ends. Steve has plans that extend far into the realrr. of student affairs. Steve knows that this highest position that the school offers is not an office, but a responsibility. Those who know Steve, !mow that his sincerity and perseverence transcend all. The core of a good president is here. The facts are that Steve has had more experience, has better q uali- fications, and a more organized set of ideas. Let's prove it. ExpPrience and Qualification· A bronc! rN•ord of pn rticip-•tion and \orking in nll phaR<'s of ~tu­ dent life is bask In his fresh year, Steve was Vice-President of the class, then went on to join in the work of the Glee Club, Band, Football, Track, C.A. and the Pre- law society. Steve's sophomore year saw him as President of his class, a partici- pant in football and lacrosse, and a member of the Independents coun- cil, and the Student Council. At the end of the year he was elected to the school's honor society for service record, the Delphic.s. Steve's junior year is full of v.ork for you, the student body. He is again Vice-President of his class, is in the Delphics and Gamet Key, has served at Frosh Camp, and in the newly formed Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship. as v.ell as playing a dynamic gamE' of lacrosse. His organized sf't of idc>as include 11 on• faculty pa1 ticipation m stu- uent affairs and vice-versa, striv- ing for an even closer relationship that he feels should prevail in our srral! college scene. He also plans to fight the two large Problems on campus: inopo- tence of Student Government and apathy of spirit. To do this re- quires drive and initiative. Steve has plenty, as testified by his success in uniting this year's fresh class, by his personal innovation and idea, COn·Ceived and carried through to a complete finish-of the new· class blazers. This is typi- cal of Steve, and the type of thoughtful guy he is. He thinks it out, then driws hard to complete his ideas. Steve feels that in a school our size, it is every student's respon- sibility to give of his time and efforts to help the name of Union stand for the finest, and he \'ill .act in that belief next year. Al- tho~gh an independent, Steve is not agamst fraternities, and has an ~onest desire to further the school Instead of a class, a house, or an John McMahon To: The Student Body of Union College: I suppose the usu:a:l procedure for a candidate for the office of Chair- man of the Student Council is to enumerate all the many services he has perforn.ed on the campus in the past. I deem such action un- necessary as my record speaks for itself. I am not concerned about ~'.hat has been a.cceomplished in the past but what can and must be done in the future. I believe that in order to pro- mote and further the W€lfare and interest of the students of Union College, we must have a strong. active and unbiased student gov- ernn•ent. It must be strong and active in that it will back to the limit any constructive student de- mands l'.ithout .trying to continu- ally appease the administration. It must also ·be unbiased and not lend itself to .be sWlayed by any pro- posals that ·would only benefit a select group. I propose no so-called \platform\ consisti'iJg of ·particular deeds that I intend to accorr-plish if elected, but instead offer myself as a leader l'.'ho will truly represent you, the student body. Lrt me r<'mind you that the C\hairman of the Stuc1ent Council not only presides at the meetings of the Student Council but also assumes the following duties: 1. Serves as President of the Stu- dent body. 2. Serves as a member of: a. The Student Tax Committee b. The Committee on Student Affairs and Relations c. The College Discipline Com- mittee 3. Appoints \\lth the· consent of tw'O-thirds of the rr.'embers of the Council, students to the follow- ing groups: a. One student to the Admissions Committee b. Two students to the College Discipline Committee c. One student .to the College Li- brary Committee. These services must be per- formed by a man who not only has a strong de>sire and the ability to lead but one ·who has had experi- ence in the workings of the stuuent government. I believe that I possess these qualifications and trust you will cast your vote for me and better student governrr:'9nt. Respectfully, John P. l\lcMahon organization. He is one of our hardest workers and one of our best-liked fellows, but he realizes that success depends on support- not just at the polls, but of every student who has the interest of the name of Union and the pride of being one of her undergraduates at heart. This has been given to you not only as a friend of his, but as a person anx:ious to see better gov- ernment in our school.

We spent a good bit of time dis- cussing this w•hole matter at a meeting this month of our Corr.- mittee on Lectmes, of which Har· old Vink was a member as a repre- sentative of the student body. Our experience in the past on 'student attendance at evening lectures and concerts has been quite disappoint- ing. On several occasions the at- tendance has been so small that owe were embarrassed to introduce the speaker. The recent Student Coun- cil-financed radio forum w•as dis· continued afl!er four programs be· cause students would not attend, even with chapel credits. A show- ing of hands at a meeting of the Student Council indicated that not a single member of the Student Council had gone to any of the forums. Your corr•rr:ittee therefore felt that it would be wise to try a new approach. They were pleased by the success which the International Relations Club enjoyed with such speakers as Miss Gay Mumphrey and Mr. Leslie Paffrath this spring. Therefore, they voted to appropri- ate some of the fun'i:l.s to help or- ganizations like the I.R.C. under· write the expenses of ··bringing some outstanding speakers for those meetings. Om last two speakers at noonday chapel, Mr. A.lvah Mille~; and Mr. Edgar Ken- nedy, have also been very well re- .ceived, and .it was voted to appro- ·pz'iate another sum to bring in several paid lecturers at the noon- day assemblies. Since the Freedom Forum brings to this community four or five speakers with international repu- tations whose fees place them out of the reach of our College budget, ·it w•as thought that we might use ,some of our funds to purchase stu- dent tick·ets for those Union under- graduates 'VI'ho wanted to hear these {)Utstanding speakers. We rr:•ay have one or two visitors under the Arts Progrwm of the Associ- ation of American Colleges, and we .1\':ill undoubtedly have a topflight speaker or two at the Founders ])-ay Convocation in February. It w<as also thought that if we could get a really good series, of foreign lll:ovies and show them in the Phy- si<Js Lecture Room with a good ,projector and loud speaker, these Ir•ight be very well received by the student body. It was therefore de- ci{!ed to use the small balance of the fund for an experiment in that area. Your committee w1U be very glad to consider any other suggestions, 'but our basic philosophy was. that Wl€ were likely to get better student attendance and participation if we 1v-orked through already established organizations. Cordially yours, Carter Davidson, President Tulips and Chimneys By Edward Cloos, Jr. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Maggie, the \cat\ in a yellow slip arches defensively in front of a mirror and talks. She talks a lot. \Sister woman,\ Mae, permanently pregnant, garrulously exhibits her dog-narr.ed children-all five of them. \Big mama,\ a \lc;mg thin woman,\ shouts and cries because she alv.•ays does. And all th1·ee women ta!ll: and talk. Brick, the alcoholic \hero draw-ls only a few 86 proof sent- ences. Gooper, Brick's grasping older brother, talks as muah as the women, and \big daddy\ sums up all of the talk with a word-crap. All three men claim to hate all of the w.omen. The marriage of Brick and Mag- gie hardly exists; it is that un- happy. The chilling reason for this is disclosed powerfully late in the play. Gooper and Mae are com- peting against Maggie and Briek for \big daddie's\ money when he dies Of the cancers in him. \Big daddy\ and '~bdg mama'' are more concerned w1th just how near is this death and whether or not \big daddy\ suffers from cancer or a mere spastic colon. This is the present, but the rea! action of the play begins In the past and ·has progressed quite far· by the time the play opens. Already enormous tension has bu.ilt up and it almost sho<;ks the audience the <w.ay this strange pressure pervades the theater concomitently with the curtain, Tennessee Williams, with his usual vitality and spicy, appealing dialogue, writes of the relationships of Brick, Maggie, and Brick's foot- ball teammate, Sldpper.

It is she who pushes the action to resolution. She loved and married Bl'ick, but ·she had not won him completely- ,beeause Brick sincerely believed in 'his friendship with Skipper. Skip- .pei' too b.elieved in it but he Jacked ·the purity of Brick's character and ·the strength of Maggie's. With &:kipper's first doubt the relation- ship was destroyed. The problem, then, ca;rr.e in facing this fa-ct. ~l!ipper: went all to pieces and wrenched the friendship of himself and Brick into an entirely unbeau- ·tiful thing. Maggie, drunk, went to S;Jtipper's room and proposed sexual relations w:hich Sltipper was un- able to carry out. He immediately il>st all faith (or all pretense) in himself and began to drink. He died very shortly. The pro:blem of ·the play is to resolve the relatio..n- ship .between the two men and ludge Maggie's action.
