One of the fellows that used to help around the house quit. You'd probably re- membPr his name .if I told you, but off-hand I can't think of it. He was really a plutnber but he used to take care of the general labor around the house, too. I'm sorry you were not home, because I think you could have made the n~cessary adjustments. Now we'll have to sta-rt looking for a new n: an and you know what that means. There are so many people in the house now that we just have to get some- one agreeable to most of them or we'll just have unrpst and nothing will be done. You know those people on the other side ·of the lake? Well, they're starving again. I don't know what wepe going to <do about them. ·we wer.e such good· :fl'iends with them that it se~nns a shame to let them go on in this way. 'l;he only h'ou- ble is that we didn't put away enqugh money- to cover thei:n this· year. Yes, we did ·give t-hem sorr.e, but we knew then it wasn't enough. Our budget just doesn't allow us makes it ·wor,se 'is that the criminal element is offering them all lrinds enough for t-h<Jse charities. What of ways to bnpr·ove their lot. I'm sure that if I >~ere starving I would grasp at ·every straw. You'd better take the situation in hand and try and or.g:;tnize the rest of the groups a!!Dund· the vicinity, or the community will have more trouble to contend· with,. They re- spect you and ·realize the problem as much as we do, Together, I think we can· solve it and make a lot of friends over there. We can't do it alone, -though.

The a<hantages a Fraternity might offer should never be undervalued. Besides fumi~h ing a convenient college home and recreation center, the fraternity promotes mut_ual understandilw ancl leadership among its members. Life- loner friendships develop as a result of as~oeiating in the work ando enjoyment of these couperatiYe organizations. For those \·ho need relief from the burden of college expenses, many frntemities offer finan~ial opportunities through working· for the betterment of the~!' houses. By this time you have had an opportumty to loo~{ ove1: at least two thirds of the houses on campus and, wh1le domg this, should have narrower! your in_terest do•xn to th:ee or four. Howevel', no one of these chmces should be considered as the final or ultimate. You will find no sing]~ house so outstanding that other seem socially handicapped by com- parison. Yom· cha.nces of increasing- social poise and broadening your outlook by associating with othe1· men ar~ not found solelJ· in tile fmternit.v realm. There are mamfold oppor- tunities to develop these intangibles on this campus that are open to all. These situations are easy to find and it is up to each individual to capitalize on them. It is also advisal.Jie to remember, before making your decision, that some stuflents do not need, and often cannot adapt themselves to, haternit;v living. Others will find that the Fraternity environment \·ill create an unhealthy balance between study hams and social activities. Again, if your choice is tG join a Frat~i·nity, don't make it a hasty one. By a thoughtful selection, you can pick ~he organization most suited to your needs and through which you will be able to realize the many advantages that Frater- nities at Union have to offer you. · l\Iav \'our decision on Fraternities be as wise as your choice o.f ~olleges. -ROBERT CHARTOFF Answer The Challenge The Challenge has been :,ounded untl here at Union we are beginning to be ttoubled with the echoes.

What About The .Campus? Union College boasts the first plunned colleg-e campus in the U.S. We know of this from histodcal signs outside our gates, learned volumes, and from people who are justly proud of Union's heritage. You have doubtless seen panoramic photographs showing the s.vmmetry and beauty of Union's campus from the air. But has it ever occmTecl to you that we seldom see pictures snapped at ground level? Why this is, we don't know. It is certain. however, that the gTotmd c1·ew of this colleg-e does a ma1Telous job of keep- ing the old place in shape.

If we have lost this powe1·, all of a sudcten our colleges and later our communities and our nation-are in trouble. In partial answer to the ChallE·nge, we wish to cite two plans of action for the betterment of the college, that have emerged and taken fol'm during the past two weeks on this campus. President Carter Davidson has announced the following program of objectives which should be completely or par- tially accomplished during this scholastic year, and to which he has pledged the whole-hearted support of the administra- tion: In a dirert pffort to corrPrt this sit.uation, the Cunco.rdiensis will make your Letters to thP Editor directly influence the contents and policy of this ne·w~paper. Letters may he put through the mail slot of the Office in Washburn Hall. or placed in the new suggestion box at the Concordy corner In the library. The ·Editorial board will edit and present any and all opinions worthy of a Union student. Whether it is praise or criticism, we of the staff want tu lmow your feelings on what we have wrlttcn. This communication should be, and will be, a pipe-line into every activity and every mind on campus. We will collect the infoimalion coming through and try to pre- sent it in respectable shape. We will also pledge to support the ex- pressed wishes of the student body, and to press and aid the adminis- tration in the achievement of their pr·ogram. From time to time, the Concordiensis will assess the progress made and report details of various aspects of it. The degree of our success will show us how we are answering the challenge. in the meantime, if you don't iike what is going one, you know what you can do.

At present, there are six men on the varsity squad, and Ketz refers to this as ... \an absolute minimum. If we lose any one of those men, I see no alternative but to call off our meets and disband the team at least for this year.\ In addition to that, only fh·e men <e> turnrd out for the frt>shman tNllll,l ~sted in running, whether or not so it looks as if Ketz wil'l facP thP he has had any experience, to come same problem nrxt year.

Varsity in Four Meets The -varsity has four meets sched- uled in addition to the IC4A and Small College championships. Don Stack is expected to be Union's big gun, and Elliot Schechter, Al Mac- Kinnon, Wes LeMasurier, Les So- bin, and Frank Magliato round out the six men who are with the pres- ent team. Bill Matthews, who is out with a sore foot at present, is expected .to return to the team Monday. These seven men are the ones who will run against Vermont next Saturday, and the fact that every man who is on tbe team will start in the meet emphasizes what Ketz meant when he referred to the size of his team as 'an absolute 'minimum', The freshm~an team is now sched- uled for the IC4A and two other rt.eets, and Ketz expects that a lhird meet will be scheduled some time next week. However, the five men who are out for the team are two less than the number that Ketz would like to start, and only one of these men has had any experience whatever. It seems to Ketz that the Frush simply don't want to try anything new, and since the finish- ing place of all seven men can make a difference in the score, the manpower situation seriously hin- ders the chances of the Freshman team. H«twever, Ketz is hoping that more men will come out for the team, and if not, he expects to do the best he can. In general, both the varsity and freshman ctoss-country teams are seriously hindered by the lack of men. If none of the present squad quits and there are no injuries, Ketz will go ahead with the sea- son's meets and hope for the best; but the loss of any of the prer.ent team would force him to cancel the meets. Because of this situation, Bill wants any man who is inter- This week, the Union College soccer team under the tutelage of coach Franz Gleich began training intensively for their inaugural against Rochejlter on October 10. .Despite the fact that nine letter men will return, the Garnet's chance for equalling their 4-:l-2 record of last year looms a.s an im- possibility. Last season, Union's pattern of play was based on speed and a hard charging offense which har- ried the opposition and forced them to make mistakes. The team's entire attack was molded around the valuable forward line of En- t'ique Pinerua, Halile Osborg, and Arturo Tanco. This high scoring trio, together with Herb Rie and Rhein Vogel, two able vetera-ns who supplied our offensive punch at the outside slots, has been lost through graduation and scholastic ineligibility. Consequently, the\ Dutchmen will • have to field a green front line which figures t() receive little support from the de- fense. The only polished performer on defense will be Dick Carpenter, whose brilliant play last year helped to bolster our sagging back wall. Coach Gleich has a wealth of raw material which could conceiv- ably be welded together into a win- ning combination. However, for the most part, the team lacks ex- perience and will have to be tested before we can pass judgement on them.

Fraternity Rushing: Pro As set•n aftPr thl'se past two wePld;, fraternity rushing at Union Collt>ge will have its problems no matter when the J;Ushing .period tak.es place, be it dPferred ot· at the very onset of the school year. But m considering the rushing period we must not· malre the mistal~e of ~i~w­ lng the individual problPms of rushing over its broader ones m deCidmg the most advantagPous system. In the opposing editorial a fin!\ point was brought out in holding the rushing program off Wltil shortly after Thanksgiving. This at fir_:;t glance would appear to be a sound plan. There are, however, ~vo rnam criticisms which affect more than the narrow aspect 'lf settling down and becoming familiax· with thl\ faces and the names around the cam- pus. These points are that it will delay the, freshman's s~cial life on f:be campus and it also will leave the ldtchen s of many ot ~~e fratermty houses smaU at a time whl\n the house could use the additional money gatl1.ered from ft•eslunan meals. Denying the freshmen access to a fraternity dming the Autumn presents a sizeable social problem. Football weekends, house pax·ties and not least of all Prom Weekend would be missed by the freshman on the outside. The house kitchens, we must remember, have been severely cut by what may very well ha.ve been a large graduating class. If we ru·e to restrict freshmen from the house meals by delaying rush- Ing we may vex·y well put many houses into the red. We cannot put serious stock into the argument that by lengthening and delaying (rmtil Thanksgiving) the rushing pe:l'iod we give the fra- tP-rnities and the frt>shman a better chance to get acquainted. We be- lieve that no other period offers the spare time fox· a good rushing pro- gra:m a.s does the beginning of the semester. It is a time where hour exams and papex·s do not interfere with the rushing schedule. It•is also a time where both freshmen and upperclassmen are just getting into their ~arious courses and the work is fail'ly simple, requiring the least expenditure of time. We also believe that a well planned rushing pro- gram during this two week period beginning the term is most advan- tageous to both the house and the freshman for it is the thoroughness and not the length Gf the rushing that counts. We must aJso make note of the cost that will be absorbed by the fraternity in lPngthening the rushing period. Delayed rushing, as attempted last year must be J•ejected on two counts, it involves a financial loss to the houses and a loss to the fresh- man of the necessary social life of the campus. The best system, which we believe, will affect the best re8ults in campus rushing is ~ concenh·ated period beginning with the school year. It satisfic~ the basic needs of the freshman and of the house. The small flaws which will present themselves at this time may easily be cm•rected by the fraternities in increasing the efficiency of the program a.nd by the freshman with a more fruitfUl budgeting of his time to make accessible more time for the rushing schedUle, -Gary R, Katz; And Con--- The formal rushing petiod is over. Let's hope that in 1954 a more practical program can be worked out, one that will not have both fra.- ternity m-en and freshltlPn alternating laughing at and griping over the program under which they are supposed to operate. Why can't we learn from l'xpm·ieoncl' and rome up with a workable rushing program. A neo- phyte's choice of fraternities is difficult enough witltout making it even tought>r by our rules. TllP timing of this Far's program is' ridiculous both from the freshmen's standpoint and that of the fraternities. A man arrives on campus tho1·oughly confuse-d by the new experience fatling ltlrn. Imme- diately a borde of fraternity men descends on him, shakes llis hand until it is numb, and babbles. Within two weeks he is expected to make a decision that may affPct the re..o;t of his life. Holding rushing during the first two weeks of the school year pre- sents a great dilemma to the fraternity man as well. In two short weeks be is expected to scan a list of 300 names, deride which ones he is interested in becoming acquainted with, and then convince these men, whom he has nPver met, that his house is the one for them. He is expected to do most of this rushing between 8:45 (whn, with luck, the freshman comPs back from the house where he ate suppe1· that night) and 9:00, when is is required to be out of the fmshman dorm. If I'Ushing were to· be held immediately following Thanksgivina vacatiDn these problems would be solved. There would be two- month~ for freshmen and fr·aternity men to get acquainted at their leisure. Mea.nwltile, the frosh could become properly Ol'iented to college life. When formal I'USbiug started the freshman would have some -idea of the f1·atenlities he is interested in. and each fratei•nity woUld lmow the men whom they wanted. Thel'l' is also the possibility of returning to the deferred program lnitiatl\d last year. There were some defects, but is this not to be ex- pected in any new program? The basic idea wa~ excellent; only the t'Ules we1•e pom•. With a year's experience we should be able to de- velop a sound program. A third possibility is preferrential rushing. Under this system, a defen·ed rushing program would be held. After the formal period each fresllllUin would list the houses he is interested in, in order of prefel'- ence. Each fraternity would list the men whom tbey wanted. The two lists would then be compared, This would solve the problem of men who do not receive the bids they want, or worse, men who receive no bids. It might also help solve tile -problems of fratel'llities who do not get the number of pledges they heed in order to remain solvent. These ax·e just three of the numerous possibilities for a practical rushing system. At any rate, let's scrap the system we used tbis year. With trouble for all and satisfaction for none, it cannot be continued. · -Peter T. Adler West College Cakewalk The Orange Squeeze Great conflicts sometimes take place ovEn' seemingly trivial incidents-for instance, Great Britain going to war in 1914 over a ''Scrap of Paper.\ To some people,. a 15 cent toll for a small glass of Orange Juice means little. ·To us, however, it is a great symbol. There seems to be a general displeasure among student eaters at West College over the rising prices, with no corres- ponding advances in quality or quantity -of food. Specificall¥, Orange juice, that vital early morning fuel and lubricant has risen to a price many consider exorbitant. In ·C()nse- quence, resistance has taken on the tone of revolt following the recent Edict of '53 which marty consider the last straw. In response to this protest, and with an eye to improving this intolerable situation the Goncordiensis is sponsoring a light breakfast open to all. Anyone interested in starting the day off right with a generous cup of Orange Juice may now c>btain same at prices that even the faculty can afford. The Bailey Hall-Bargain-Breakfast, or Concordy' Coffee Clatch will begin at 7:45 Monday morning (.weather :permit- ting) in front of Bailey Hall and will continue until West College capitulates. You will see us there with a smile and a friendly good morning. Cost of Orange Juice plus cookies will be one nickle with all profits going to campus charities. Take note West College : the squeeze is on.

Six Hundred Alumni Attend '53 Homecoming Festivities Close to 60() alumni and their'$·;..· ~-------------­ fami1ies attended Union. College's annual homecoming last weekend. The program included meetings of the Executive Board of the Alumni Council and the Alumni Council Itself, a faculty-aiumnl lUncheon, and a varsity football game with · th~ University of Rochester. S'peaking before the Alumni Council on Saturday morning, President Davidson discussed the future ·deposition of college fi- nances. During ·his long tenure as Treasurer of Union, Frank Bailey had handled all the school's ac- counts and ·kept · a day-by-day check or them. Since it is hlgh1y improbable that Union can find another man of Mr. Bailey's ability who can devote the necessary time to this job, the funds will be placed in the charge of an investment or trust company. On October 24, tli.e Board ilf Trustees will meet to elect a new treasurer. ;Dean Huntley spoke on t:he school's enrollment and outlined new changes in the curriculum. This was later to provoke consid- erable discussion from the floor on the .purposes of a Libeval Arts pro- gram.

Pre-Meds Sponsor Dr~ Hudson's Visit Next Monday afternoon, Dr. Perry Hudson, Assistant Professor of Urology at Columbia University, College of Physicians and Sur- geons, will arrive on campus as the second special guest of the Pre- medical Society during the past year. D=lng his stay, Dr. Hudson will· lecture on the very close re- lationship which exists today be- tween the basic sciences and clini- cal, medical, and surgical research, besides speaking to the organic chemistry classes and holding num- erous informal discussion groups. When invited for this visit by the society president, Howard Fox, Dr .. Hudson expressed the feeling that \students in college sometimes think they are so far away from medicine that they do not fully re- alize the fundamental importance of the immediate work which they are doing in basic science.\ Con- tinuing, he said that this aware• ness should be inculcated into every pre-med. Believing that a pre-medical stu- dent's perspective towards -medicine coul~ be greatly enhanced by per- SOil!i.l contact with top men in vadous aspects of the profession, the Society initiated a program last year of inviting sUch people to our campus. Good Neighbors In presenting the gift, Mr. Craw- ford said in part, \as evidence of our continuing interest in Union College, our neighbor of long stan.ding with whom we have had such wonderful relations, General Electric takes this 75th anniver- sary as an occasion to present yo11r college with this token of our high esteem for the work which it is doing. \As our president, Ralph J. Cor- diner, so ably forecast at that out- standing Chamber of Commerce salute to G. E. the other night, General Electric expects Schenec- tady to become the industrial re- search center of the world. Union College, through its diligent train- ing of young men, has contributed immeasureably to the 75 years progress of the electrical industry and we of General E1ectric are sure that it\'will continue to play an important role in making Sche- nectady the industrial research center forecast by President Cor- diner. In accepting the gift, Dr. David- son said: \All of us at Union College are quite thrilled by this new evidence of the interest and support of the General Electric Company. \Al· though teher are many aspects of the college program which coUld use this financial help, the com- pany is obviously very much inter- ested in our engineering progr!lm and particularly in the secure es- (Coiltinued on Page 4)

In The Orange - ---- -- -ORAH GE. ;J\UIC£_ - - ----- ...... .r Only the Colm· Has Been Changed To Avoid Investigation - FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1953 Letters to the Editor All we want are the facts, .Just the facts, Mr. South. Well, it .seems that the big news on this otherwise dull campus is the Oran~e Juice caper. If nothing else, this action by a few zealous Conco1•dy staff members aroused the ca.mpus to activity from its usual lethargy and apathy. This is to be 0ommended. It shows that, even though the voice of enthusi- asm is gone from the football bleachers, it can be elicited when unusual circumstances call for it. But this .bandwagon campaign has vea.Uy done nothing to get the FACTS~ It went as far -as showing that orange juice could. be sold cheaper that it is sold at West Col- lege. This, in itself, is nothing-.. It hasn't brought out the circum- stances which caused the orange juice to be sold at 15 cents in the first place. Now, just what are the implications of this? Well, it could inean that there are really no facts of any interest; this, I am sure, .is nonsense. It should be made :public just what costs are in- volved in running West College, and that includes wages of all per- sonnel, cost of all food purchased, and the other sundry items known by accountants. This is the only way to find out If there really is any mismanagement or anything else afoot at West College. For all we know, there may 1 be nothing wrong in the management of the dining hall. In fact, there are .some figures around the campus th<J,t show that the dining hal~ has run itself into the red even when students complained that prices were too• high. The fact of the matter is that there are no facts yet. lt Is a deplorable situation when students talk maliciously about Mr. South and his entourage, without having the slightest knowl- edge about affairs at West College. W·hat this writer is driving for is a. full investigation of West Coi- lege. The sooner this is done, the sooner ruinors and gossip will stop. I am ·sure that the students on this campus want to ·know · the facts. I am sure tha:t they are as tired as I am of hearing apologies from Mr. South about the high cost of operation. Once we know what the situation really is, the bettei' we can cope with it. Until we find out the facts, or make an ·effort to, there ought to be a truce. To con- tinue the tactics ·of the Orange Squeeze without knowing all there is to know would be to foster a disregard of as yet unknown facts. The time has come for action. -Maurice Silver '154 FRESHMEN REPORTERS Steven Knafel, Joel Plattner, \Villiam Sisson, Calvin Kni<-kerbocker, I I For You· r Edward Kloos, Jerome Goldstein, Albert :ialvato, John Sein, Alan M • Schechter, Landlslau Berka, Alan Schiffman, Simon Stertzer, Alan USlngs l..--8-hu_c_ar_d_, -J-er_o_m_e_H_I_rs_h_in_._E_'d_w_a_rd_L_a_ng_h_o_lz_, _H_ic_n_ar_u_L_ew-·l_s. ____ .. -' '--------------·-----------------1 Information Dear Sir: The Student Union Board of New York State College for Teachers at Albany, extends a cordial invitation to the faculty and students of Union College .to visit our Student Union and enjoy its facilities with us during .the following school year. The Orange Squeeze (2) By the Grecian Dreamer FRlDJ\,Y, OCT. 16- Daily assem- bly, recital, Dr. E. A. Tidmarsh, MC, noon; Faculty Women's Club, Old Chapel, 3:30 p.m.; International Relations Club, English Reading Room, Bailey HaU, 7; 30 p.m. The \Battle of the Orange Juice\ lasted exactly one week: from the time the editorial Orange Squeeze .( 1) was printed in the Concordiensis last Friday to this Thursday at 3:00 P.M. when the nine-man Study Committee met in Har- old Van de Car's office in Wells House. But in these seven short days much of great importance has taken place. The complexion of \What was at stake changed entirely: from \Whether the price of Orange juice 1:1t West College should be reduced from 15c to 5c.\ the issue broadened to \Whether college students with a sincere gripe are able-through their free student press-to effect a change in college policy to better the con:ditions which caused the complaint.\ The Adm.ihistration of Union College answered the ques- tion promptly and decisively. In a special session convened Wednesday morning, President Davidson authorized the for- mation of a committee dedicated to putting the full story of all West College dining operations before the student body. Four students were seated on the committee in positions of equal trust and responsibility. · We believe this courageous step by the administr~tion heralds a new era in relations between the college and the student body. It shows the world that \Ve are, in fact, free to express our feelings in print or in a traditional student prank. It is also a :practical demonstration that when any of our complaints seem valid, the Administration of Union College will invite us to join with them in investigating and improv- ing the situation. To our knowledge, this kind of action by a student body and a University government are without precedent any- where. The situation so far has been conducted in keeping with the highest traditions of pure democncy, freedom of the press, and enlightened and foresighted college admin- istration. The crucial point of the Committee's work will be the open hearing Monday evening at Well's House, 1 Union Avenue. Any person who can contribute to the progress of the com- mittee is invited to be present for a full and confidential in- terview. If you possess any information or know anyone capable of rendering a valuable opinion, please call the office of Mr. Van de Car, chairman of the committee, before Mon- day evening. In this way you will be aiding the committee, suppo1·ting the College and the Concol'diensis, and eventually helping yourself. I was sitting on the steps of N ott Libi'ai'Y the other day, admiring the sheer beauty of the sunset. For once, Alco had relented and let natW'e display its full glory, and the front of West College was dini- ly visible in the crim,;;on of the westei'n slcy. The door opened, and a pipe stepped out. It was followed in close order by Helmer Webb. Talldng to the sunset, it seemed, he sighed, \Beautiful . . • reminds me of the days when we sat on the Terrace and sang at sunset. It was more comfortable then ... \Ve had a fence to lean against. They had to keep the professors' cows frotn walking over the campus, and they put up a fence along the Terrace. Every professor still has the right to pas- tW'e his cow down there, you know • • .\ Then he turned his back to the sunset and his reverie, and disappeared through the door. Tradition is to Union as vintage is to fine wine. Without it, much of the old-time flavor is g•one from college life. I grant that Bailey Hall might look the same, and that the professors would teach the same courses, -whether or not the traditions of Union are upheld. Yet, although the appearance would be the same, the conse- quence will be grave if tradition is allowed to fade into obscurity. Recently, the custom was revived of opening each Chapel assembly with the singing of a Union song. Now, I find it hard to hear the singing, so loud are the complaints about having to stand up \just to sing a song that means nothing to m.e, anyway.\ It was only a few years ago that Chapel witnessed some of the most spirited singing ever heard on this campus. With enlightened pride of our school, this custom can be returned to its rightful niche on the shelf of tradition. The old and annoying practice of hazing is banned on Union's cam- pus. In its stead are set up a. prac- tical list of rules for Freshmen to follow. I needn't enumerate them, for you all know the taboos about upperclass walk and the lawns. Yet, it seems that~these rules are dying from disobedience. They may seem silly to some, but, in cir- cumspect, they are a part-art essen- tial one-of life at Union. They are part of the foundation on which school spirit is built. I hear people s;a.y that our tradi- tions are dying out because we live in a world too materialistic to :permit us the indulgence of a little notalgia. I say that they are dy- ing because most of us just don't know enough or care enough to perpetuate them. It is time, how- ever, that we did care about them, lest Union College .~ecome a mere name, and its student body just a group of• men who go to classes. Colelge life can be far more than what we are making of it. Any improvement in it is entirely our responsibility. Let us live up to that responsibility. Let us all learn of Union's traditions, for we can then share not only in the pleasure of the present, but in the wonder- ful history of our school. Then our year here will be one hund1•ed fifty eight times forty weeks of knowledge, understancl-ing, and tradition. \So while we're here together, Let's give a rousing cheer ••• \ SATURDAY, OCT. 17 - Varsity football, Union vs RPI at Troy, 2 p.m. (Game fololwed by party at Troy Country Club under auspices of Troy Alumni of Union College, ' $1.50 per person); Freshman foot- ball, Union vs. Morrisville at Sche- nectady 2 :p.m.; Varsity Cross Country, Union vs. RPI at Troy, 2:30 p.m.; Varsity Soccer, Union vs. R.P.I. at Schenectady 2' p.m.; Freshman Cross CountJ;y, Union vs. R.P.I. at Troy, 2:30 p.m. SUNDAY, OCT. 18-Sunday service, preacher, Dr. Norman B.

The Tuition Situation I.!===C=a=mpus Culling.s I Prescri ption·s Fountain Servioe Drugs I I I I I I I I I I I I I .I I As eventually, it must, the high cost of learning has hit Union College. The most tender part of the human anatomy is the wallet; but a look at the tuitions of other schools of Union's size will ease the pain somewhat. RPI, an engineer- ing school, charges its students 800 dollars a yea1·, and Mid- dlebury, Williams, Vermont, Hamilton, and St. Lawrence's tuitions range from a high of 700 dollars to a low of 600 dollars. However, there is a factor which has important bearing on the subj ect,-that of endowment. Among small men's colleges in the United States, Union College ranks sixth in the size of its endowment. This fund has been swelled con- siderably by the recent gift of the late Fxank Bailey. The question is: what is the relationship of the endowmeht fund to the amount of money the students pay for tuition? The topic has long been one of much discussion and few facts. One misconception is that the College finances its operations by sp~nding t~e money in its endowment fund; actually, the schools funcbo~s are supported by the interest drawn by the fund from mvestments and bank accounts. When we remember that this interest runs in the neighborhood of 4 or 5%, the endowment does not seem quite as large. - In any c!l.se, we would all do well to re-examine the ad- ministration's reasons for the increase before we become vocal in our objections. The forthcoming financial report of the College should throw much needed light on the situation. · -Robert Richter By Gilbert Gertzog Concubine- When several busi- nesses combine. 600 UNION ST. COR.

Let's • · , get over to Troy tomorrow and The Union College football team travels to Troy Satur- day to play R.P.I. at 2:00 on '86 Field, and there will be four new men on Union's forward wall. Joe Wilkinson, Dave Gregory, Bill Rudolph and Bill Bloomfield will take over starting position for the Garnet, and Sam Hammerstrom hopes to get a better defensive performance than he did against Rochester last weekend. RPI On Tap For. Booters Union College's soccer team will play its third game of the season when it meets R. P. 1'. this Satur· day at 2 p. m. at Alex:ander Field. So .far this year, the Garnet has split in its first tw0 encounters, while R. P. I. was held to a 1-1 tie by Colgate. In 1951, when R. P. I. was the national champion, we lost 10-1. Last year, however, Union made its best showing against R. P. I., when they .played them to a 2-2 tie. Since the soccer team will be the only Union team playing at h,0me this weekend, it will afford an op\ portunity for some of you who haven't yet seen a soccer game this season to come out and give the team the support it needs. Last Saturday, the Garnet was trounced by .the Rochester Yellow· jackets, 3-0, in the first game of the year, and didn't look particu- larly Impressive. On Wednesday, George Pasqua! and Jerry Jameson starred, as the bo0ters took an easy 4-0 victory over Middlebury. Pasqual, playing inside right, scored two goals and assisted on a third. Jameson, play- ing goalie, made some brilliant stops, particularly in the last quar- ter, when the Garnet's defense started to fold. A goal by Eric Gansmueller on an assist from Pasqua! gave Union a 1-0 lead early in the first quarter. At 1:20 of the second quarter, Pas- qual scored on an ·assist from Dick Carpenter. The last two goals came in the first part of the third quarter, both on penalty kicks, one ·bY Pasqua! and the other by Gra- ham McNaughton.

Small fuses like this are used by the millions to protect certain telephone central office cir- cuits against cmTent overloads.

LUIGI IS RESTAURANT Union has lost to three good teams this year, and hasn't been able to combine good offensive w:ork with good defense, at any time. Rochester gained at will last week, but Union's .offense. was good enough to keep ·the Garnet in the game. Against Amherst, the story was just the . reverse. The team looked good on defense but couldn't get anywhere offensively. If the team could be effective both ways in the same game, it would be a far tougher outfit to beat. Last week's game with Rochester was never in doubt. Despite the brilliant all-round play of Len Klingberg, the Ga1·net never had · a chance. The Yellowpackets con- tinually tore huge holes in the Union line, and gained all their yardage on the ground. Union looked very good when they had the ball, and Klingberg looked al- most as good as Rochester. He continually appeared from out of nowhere, and made big gains when r-- .. -.:cii-siii---l SPORT COUPE · Mercury • 1951 1 1 SpecialiZing in MAROON • Ita-lian-American Food RADIO and HEATER ,tpR CONDITIONING t II 25 ·BARRETT ST.

The \grasshopper\ was studied by a young engineer out of the University of MiJ.mesota, Class of '40, who joined the Company in 1946. His studies indicated the most effective way to improve effi- .ciency and cut costs further was to change the design. Pursuing this lead the engineer and his group saw their opportunity to make an important contribution. They investiga- ted the latest tooling techniques, new metals, :finishing materials and methods, all of whiqh are constantly under study by engineers at Western Electric plants. A simplified design, which permitted. the use of the most modern tooling methods, re- sulted in a better fuse at lower cost that is saving thousands of dollars a year for Bell telephone companies. There's an endless stream of such challeng. ing assignments at Western Electric. Engineers of varied skills - mechanical, electrical, civil, chemical, metallurgical- find real satisfaction in working together on the important job of providing equipment for the best telephone service on earth.

Ad interim marks close soon, and it is still a good idea to \be prepared.\ These questions will give you a fair preview of what the professors are looking for in the way of answers. You can also get an overall picture of the objectives of the course and what you should gain from it. As Others See Us College spirit is not only a function of what we f€el for Union College; It is a reflection of our thoughts on the pur- pose and the merit of a college education. If we, ourselves, do not esteem knowledge, we cannot expect the adult world to view the college campus with respect. A Successful Season Last Saturday's Freshman football game was a sterling example of how the game should be played. The two teams were evenly matched, and the small handful of interested spectators showed that the players were out there for the pm·e love of the sport. The team bore the imprint of good coaching. Mr. Richard Ciccolella ran the club like a man who didn't have to worry about his position. The emphasis was on enjoyment for the ballplayers, and not the spectators. Win, lose, or draw, we predict that the F1:eshman football season will be a success. Friendly Rivalry We are happy to note the interest expressed in the R.;F.I. weekly newspaper recently, concerning the revival of that spirit formerly expressed by our two schools preceding the time of the annual football game. In an attempt to again sh·engthen relations between the two schools, Lee Pomeroy, the \Polytechnic\ editor, sug- gested that \perhaps a trophy exchange or annual joint beer party, symbolizing the rivalry between the two arch-oppon- ents might serve to revive some of those 'grand old Union- R.P.I. traditions' and stimulate a cooperative spirit, while avoiding bills for damages.\ The Concordiensis believes that it is expressing the feel- ings of the entire student body at Union by approving the intended establishment of this plan. Through this ac1mowl- edgement, we hope that both schools will at least devote some serious thought to the idea, and perhaps some construc- tive move can be taken this weel\end, when our freshmen football teams meet at '86 Field. The Editors contributions of Union to the professors commented to me that community, besides the obvious one it is the best class he has seen of affording the graduates of Sche- here in a long time. It is up to nectady schools a college which this class to assert themselves and can be attended while living at try to correct those things which home. Our faculty really plays a they think need correcting.

This year, but for the kaleidascope of colors on campus. one may easily lose track of the seasons. Fall, that season !tnown for its heraldry of winter's freezing winds, has shown none of its ex- pected fierceness. The b!an!tets, so prevalent on the Autumn Saturday at Alexander Field, have, with the colder air, hesitated in making their appearance at Union. · Strangely enough, however, that cold beverage with the warming effects employed to maintain body circulation through a cold four quarters has been seen going stronger than ever, We do not !tnow whether this drinking on campus only seems to have been intensified by its being spotlighted, but it appears to us that there has been, within the past few years, a dramatic increase in drinking on the college campus. We are not preaching for the abolition of drinking. A similar experiment attempted on a na- tional scale was doomed to immin· ent disaster and •succeeded in only ihcreasing man's appetite for the forbidden, drink. We are, how- ever, arguing for moderation. Drunkenness does not loolt pretty. It in no way increases the reputation of the inebriated party, his fraternity, his school or his rearing. There is, in our mind, no sound reason for the gouging we have seen recently at the games and at the parties here on the hill. These antics appear to be no more than a juvenile .showing oft, an at- tempt to follow the bolder mem- bers of the house. We do believe that alcohol can become an integral part of the col- lege party. A drink before dinner is a spark to the appetite. A drink during the college songs will help warm up the party. A drink with your date might be an introduction to conversation. Drinking to test ona's capacity is senseless and a block to the good. times that may be had at the college social events. The key word is moderation. Liquor taken in moderation can have none of the harms for which it is proven guilty if taken in ex- cess. In moderation it will become a enjoyable refreshment. In excess it can do nothing but ruin re.puta- tion and self respect thus injuring the individual, the fraternity, and the college.

Letters to the Editor The following is a 1·eprint of a letter to the editor, which appeared in the May 27, 1949 issue of the Concordiensis: Dear Sir:· In regard to Mr. Miller's letter on the Hale House Cafeteria, I wish to say that I would attribute the operational loss to gross mis- management and not to errors in bookkeeping.

However, if I am mistaken and the $13,597 loss is really unavoid- able, I suggest that the college would be wiser to discontinue the operation of the cafeteria, since with so great a loss of sorely need- ed funds, it has ceased to be a service.

Frosh Defeat Aggies, 14-7 Spectators had a preview of what may be a large portion of next year's varsity Saturday, as Union's freshman football squad defeated Morrisville, 14-7, at Alexander Field. The Garnet drew first blood in the second quarter, when Dick Lounsbury went off tackle to score from the seven. The tally climaxed a fifty six-yard drive, sparked by long gains by Joel Albert and Andy Reynolds. Pete Kansas booted the point after touchdown. In the third period, Lounsbury went up the middle and broke into the clear on S():tne fine blocking. He galloped ninety yards for Union's second touchdown. Kan- sas again converted, making the score Union 14, Morrisville 0. The Aggies' tally came in the final period on a pass from Da- mond to Barton. Caraccilo . kicked the ,extra point. . Lounsbury and Al)>ert led the Union offense, as the team· rolled up a total of 2ji3 yards rushing to 155 for Morrisville. Rex .Sawyer was a standout, both on offense and defense. Hawthorne sparked the Aggie attack. Statistics show that each team picked up ten first downs, but that Union completed five passes for 76 yards while the Aggies hit on three passes for 61 yards.· The Dutchman frosh squad meets R.P.I. at Troy tomorrow in its big game of the season. For the last few ·weeks, the. Concordiensis has been calling DU last year's football champs, in its intramural stories.

DU was, how- ever, last year's overall intra- mural ¢hampion. ~~---~~~---········ AUTUMN MADNESS By Bob Tofel September 1951, af) far as football was concerned, was the beginning of an all-out .period of the game. It was a year of two !)latoon teams and fresh- man eligibility. It was . a season in .which Union had a tough schedule. We were to pla:y an unbea:ten St. Lawrence a tough bury eleven, powerful iiams, not to which went on to build an unde- feated team. We were going to use a single wing, and .freshmen, both for the first time. It was a year:' of two platoon teams and freshman eligibility. It was a season in which Union had a tough schedule. We were to play an unbeaten St. Lawrence team, a tough Middlebury eleven, and powerful Williams, not to mention Rochester, which went on to build an undefeated team. We were go- ing to use a single wing, and freshmen, both for the first time. I attended pre-season practice early that Septembru:, and, as a sophQmOl'S. knew p1·actically evel-y- body there. There were, however, foUl' freslunen present who were unknown to everybody but Sam Hammerstrom, They are pretty well-known now, though; Don Reed, Joe ·Guerra, Bill Rudolph, and Jess Dickson. There were other frosh playing ball, but these four were ·clearly the best, and they did look good. The one ·who looked best was Don Reed, now varsity quarter- back. He played tailback in our single wing offense, and was very capable ~s a defensive safety. I remember particularly one pre- season scrimmage in which he shone. It was a long affair which lasted about two :ti:ours, and d ur- ing it Reed got off at least two long runs and scored three touch- downs. When the season started, he was second ·tailback behind Klingberg and started at safety. At St. Lawrence, where we absorbed a 48-6 beating~ he went 80 yards for our only touchdown. The next weekend, we traveled to RPI and won 21-14; however, in the first period, Reed, while playi:ng sa~ety, was blocked, and the block resulted in a serious dislocation of the knee. He didn't play any more that sea- son, nor did he play any conse- quential amount last year. It seemed to all that his football days were done. Anybody who· ·has seen Union this year realizes just bow false that assW!lption was. He was fitted for a knee brace which seems effective, and, to all intents and purposes, he has this season and all o0f the next to look forward to. So far this year, he has been excellent. Don is an excellent ball- handler, a necessity in the split-T, a. good runnet·, and a steady de- fensive player. I don't intend to extol him, nor do I consider him a hero. He has two qualities, however, which make hiin the ball-player he is; one is ability, and the other is desire, which makes the .difference be- tween being good and being out- standing. ___ ,0,--- Watching, Waiting On the potted ivy scoreboru•d: Amherst 21, Coast Guard 7.

Last year Ho- bart racked up two touchdowns in the last minute of play to pull out a 13\7 win. In 1952, an underdog Garnet eleven smasbed favored Ho- bart, 27-6 and the year bef'Ore it was the winless Sta.tesmen who up- set Union, 33-0. 3 Union's Harriers Outrun Engineers Paced by Captain Don Stack, Elliott Schecter, and AI McKinnon, who finished first, second, and fourth, respective.., ly, the Garnet harriers gained their first triumph this sea- son when they upset favored R. P. I. 27-30 last Saturday afternoon at Troy. In a preliminary triangular meet, the Union Frush, plagued Ly injury and a freak accident, Lowed to both the Cobleskill and R. P. I. cubs. Stack, who finished in a tic for~--------------­ first with Schecter last week I u b t DU against Vermont, led over nearly I n ea en all of the {.8 mile course, and callle in 50 seconds ahead of the nearest R.P.!. man. Schecter, with an ·ail- ing leg, started slowly, favoring it, but finished fast to beat out R.P.I.'s Gottshaw, who was tiring badly, for second. The steadily improving McKinnon ran an ex- cellent race to come in fourth, and seems to be shaping up very well, as evidenced by his time trials, which are the best of his career. Les Sobin copped 8th place for the Dutchmen, while Bill Mat- thews, running with a still weak tendon, fiinshed 14th. Frank Mag- liatto, whose knee has been trouble- some, was forced to stop without finishing, and Wes Le Maurier was unable to compete at all. With McKinnon developing as he has, and in the light of Sobin's encouraging 8th place finish on Saturday, the Garnet looks much stronger than had been anticipated earlier, and should win quite handily over Middlebury and Ham- ilton . An interesting sidelight to the R.P.I. meet is, the fact that, even though Union sccHed less points than the Engineers, they could When Sobin• crossed the finish line, the Garnet looked to have clinched the meet, but because of the fact that five men mast finish for a team to win, the issue was still in doubt. Matthews and Magliatto, both injured, were running well back, and one of them had to fin- ish to give the D.utchmen a win. Matthews finally did, in a time of .32:13, to give Union the victory, but Coach Ketz looked mighty worried for a time! The Freshmen, with their num- ber one man, John Parillo, il1, ran a very disappointing meet on Sat- urday, coming in last with a total of 84 points, and no man fiinshing better than 11th. :A big factor in this defeat was the- freak accident in which Ben Chapnick, who was running among the leader's, was struck by a truck and forced to re- Concordy Staff Leads Students To Bridge Win Roger Merrill and Paul Madison won EMt-West, and Mart Hauser and Pete Adler won North-South last Wednesday as the students easily won the first student-faculty bridge tournament of the year.

State and Broadway Gains Fin·als As a result of this and last week's competition, undefeated Delta Upsilon will meet the winner of the Sigma Chi-Phi Sigma Delta game for the in-tramural football championship. The defending champion Delta Upsilon downed the hard-fighting Phi Sigma Delta team, 7-0, last Thursday, and Sigma Chi downed Phi Delta Theta Monday, .9-7, to qualify with Phi Sigma Delta in the semi-finals. The Phi Delts de- feated Chi Psi to enable them to meet Sigma Chi, and Sigma Chi downed Kappa Sigma to enter the quarter finals. Delta Upsilon will be gunning for its second straight championship next week, and the winner of the Sigma Chi-Phi Sigma Delta game, already once beaten by the power- ful DU's, will be out to end the Delta Upsilon intramural reign. The competition should be keen and stiff, since the teams are ap- proaching the last games and must fight for survival, if they are to win the championship. So top- notch touch football is in sight. Get out and see those final few games. tire from the meet. Fortunately, no serious injury occurred. The Garnet cubs face R.P.I.'s Frosh at home this Saturday, and should do much better with Parillo back and A! Schecter in shape. The Engineers are still favored, how- ever. \What do you\ hear when it comes to Beer!\ UTICA CLUB!

Without a doubt, Union is one or the most overgrown old schools in the East. But undel'neath the Ivy, the spirit of Union remains youthful and vigorous. Our curriculum, with its changes of the past two years, is among the most up-to-date in the nation. Our student activities are \'aried and strong, and the devotion to the academic ideal placed Union, two years ago, with the highest scholastic average of any College in New York state. Unfortunately, however, in this era, it is not de- bating or journalism or scholarship that puts a college on the map-it is aUtletics. Union does not produce many football juggernaughts these days. Its last undefeated squad, in 1949, resulted from the influx of World War II veterans, and this situation was rather an accidental one in Union's athletic histor:\f. As I walk through the town, I see the chapel where the bones of Bishop Ken~dy lie enshrined. r. see the martyr's cross where a burning took place as an example to all Christians. I wonder at the tradition of it all, and I can't help feeling that so much has come of so Uttle. All around me, the air is filled with oldness and lore. These things that the travelogs can never portray. In town, I see the coffee shops where we gathered to talk and laugh and gossip about everything·. I can see Ian be}1ind the counter, and his daughter Clyd·e, and I can hear him saying \fetch me a wee cup o' milk, lass\. All around me are the students. ·Their brogue is thick and the laughter is loud.· It It S ·.• •t makes me feel as though there was S Plfl nothing to worry about, nothing The simple reason is that Union, and a number of other but the joke of the moment.

I have lived all ent winning seasons. Our crowning triumphs are haxd- fought, unexpected, upsets. Our pl'ice is the continuing friendly rivalry with schools we have met on the athletic field since before 1900. Our schedule is \great\ because it includes Universities of relatively equal size and strength, with the same attitude toward the role of Sport in a college program. Its Formation We believe it is high time the teams of the Union League stopped apologizing about their athletics. To post a non-win- ning season is not a crime-the means by which manv col- leges produce winning teams, however, sometimes border on actual criminal acts. We can announce to the world that our athletics are still Sport, and will remain such. We can demon- strate that athletic programs are still being staged for stu- dents interested in participating, and that the primary pur- pose of attending a University is still to study. To this end, we, of the Concordiensis, propose the recog- nition bf the \Little Ivy League\ among the following schools: Amherst, Bowdoin, Hamilton, Haverford, Hobart, lVIi_d~lebury, Rochester, Swathmore, Trinity, Tufts; Wesleyan, Wllilams, and last but not least, Union.

Also Half a Hero Wild Being a true Union College stu- dent, I read every line of the Con- cordy. In reading the October 23, 1953 issue, I came across these two lines: \The key wot·d is moder- ation. Liquor taken in moderation can have none of the harms for which it is proven guilty if takt>n in excess.\ Immediately upon read- ing those words, a voice spoke to me. \Go to the top of the Bevis Hill Reservoir and there thou shalt see a burning bush.\ I ran to the top of Mt. Bevis. and there the burning bush spoke to me. \Oh. James of Union College, listen closely, for I have a new command- ment for the world. THOU SHALT DO ALL THINGS IN MODERA- TION, NEVER TO EXCESS. Go, and preach this new conunandment to the world.\ Next Monday I will be iri Silli- man Hall at 3;30 a.m. to start the Moderate Cult. The meeting will be moderate. :My attempts to gain new· members will be moderate. The oath of the Moderate Cult will be, \0 Great Moderator, help us to be moderate in our loyalty to thee, and in. all our actions.\ I hope every Union College student will be at the meeting so that the Moderate Cult can have a moder- ate beginning. See you there, Mr. Editor. Since these thirteen schools already play 50-90% of their games with \member\ schools, the ''formation\ of the league would involve little more than its official recognition by its members. Union, through the Concordiensis, will take pleasure in presenting a trophy-a rare potted Ivy plant-to the team that tops the Little Ivy League's standings at the end of this season. The trophy will be symbolic not only of athletic su- premacy, but of the value and traditions of small-school foot- ball. I St;heenetady 6-4895 I ~~-~:~~--~~~~ Gary Cooper and Ruth Roman Hot N·ews The meaning of the command- ment is quite clear. No action is to be done to excess,. but in mod- eration. Excess Is the evil of the world. The ten commandments are to be revised by placing at the end of each the words \to excess.\ Lying is all right, it is just lying to excess that is evil. Stealing is a rightful behavior, it is just steal- ing to excess tqat is wrong. Truly, Mr. Editor, I have ,stumbled onto a great truth.

It may be that, if a school wins three consecutive tendrils on the plant, it might be attached to a wall of a building on the campus-as a reminder of the University's pride,in the great living traditions of the \Little Ivy League.\ Well, this is the beginning. The fate of the Little Ivy ~eague now depends on how the \member\ colleges act.

The former model- in production for years-had been gradually refined 'til it seemed almost oeyond further improve- ment. It was simple, inexpensive, efficient, came off the line fast. But ... It's an old Western Electric engineering custom to keep trying to..make Bell tele- phone equipment st:i)l better, at still lower cost. The \grasshopper\ was studied by a young engineer out of the University of Minnesota, Class of '40, who joined the Company in 1946. His studies indicated the most effective way to improve effi- . ciency and cut costs further was to change the design. -Pursuing this lead the engineer and his group saw their opportunity to make an iniportant contribution. They investiga- ted the latest tooling techniq11es, new metals, :finishing materials and JDethods, all of which are constantly under study by engineers at Western Electric plants. A simplified design, which permitted the use of the most modern tooling methods, re- \ sulted in a better fuse at lower cost that is saving thousands of dollars a year for Bell telephone companies. There's an endless stream of such challeng. ing assignments at Western Electric. Engineers of varied skills -mechanical .

How the grasshopper fuse works ' Small fuses like this are used by the millions to protect certain telephone central office cir- cuits against current overloads. Odd in appear- ance, the fuse is called the \grasshopper\ be- cause of its spring which is released when the fuse blows, displaying an indicator \flag\ in open view and tripping an alarm so the trouble can be spotted and corrected at once.

Note ••• Professor Schmidt's Government 48 class, in connection with its study of the State and Local Gov- ernment in practice, presents here a brif\f ~ympnoium on thf' <'nming municipal elections. This feature represents a Concordiensis policy of presentlng timely ::;y 111postu1no as a means of supplementmg our campus news with that of broader interest. We would like it to be und<•rstood that any of the opin· ions presented here are not neces- sarily those of Professor Schmidt or of the Concordiensis. in fact, begin at the local level, if off-year elections are really import- ant, what are the facts concerning the candidates, and the issues in the present campaign in the city of $chenectady?

Gone, too, are the voten;, or at least a sub- stantial portion of them, as revealed by reg-istra tiun fig- ures which show 20,000 les~ local residents qualified to vote this year than last. For, of course, this is 1953,-an \off year,\ and next Tuesday's election Is '\ummportant.' It just doesn't matter. Or does it? Can we, in fact, have such a thing as an \off yea1 '' in our democratic form of govt·rnqlcnt? Or does democracy - admittedly the most difficult, the most demanding, and even at times the dullest form of government devised - require our constant attention if it is to suc- ceed? When the City Clerk gets up to call the roll and recerd the vote at the City Council meetings, the nrst member called upon is Coun- Cilman Thomas H. Moynihan. The Clerl{, the Mayor, the City Man- ager, and the County boss already kn0w how Councilman Moynihan will vote, since he has never voted against or even made a suggestion to alter or defeat any proposal huvmg the backing of Cushing, Cohn, Wemple, & Co. Perhaps this 1s why Mayor Wemple calls Moym- han \a pillar ot strength\. lf ~~a~ or \1\'emple means rubber stump when he says pillar of st 1 ength, then Moynihan is the man. Thomas H. Moynihan is thin, cigat-smokmg, and sarcastic. The pictures, of him that have appeared in the Republican half-page ads in the local press were taken at least ten years ago. He has served on the Council for the longest period of time and is the Republi- can majority leader. His main at- tnbute is his ability to make sar- castic and amusing comments about Sam Stratton. His faults are thcrt he ~haws no independence and that he Iool{S, sounds, and acts like he is going to drop dead any minute. I feel that anyone who has seen him in action at a Council meeting will go to the polls and vote n\ainst him. However, few voters att£Ond these meetmgs. Thus, due to the voter's lack of Inforntation, .\luymhan p1 ol.mbly Will l.Je 1 eelecl- t:d by u 11 emtlndou., margin.

It would seem, however, that he is much in need of political experi- ence and know-how, and this lack of experience will probably cost him heavily in the forthcoming election. -~--o-~-- Eugene Male By Stanley N ewins Second position on the Democra- tlc party ticket for councilman is occupied by R. Eugene Male, a local l.Jusinessman (in heating oils). Mr. Male's political experience in- cludes two terms on the County Board of Supervisors. As to his program fo1· better government in Schenectady, we might cite a few of his beliefs: 1. That politics should be taken out of the City Manager's Office. 2. That the city council should begin to plan now a program for economic readjustments in the C\'cnt of unemployment, arising from departmental relocations and layoffs at General Electric. 3. That taxes should be based upon the ability to pay. 4. That the city should receive a fair share of state-collected taxes now taken away by the \insidious Moore formula\. Mr. Male, in ·a speech on October 16, called for a continuation of the two party system, saying, \one party government is bad for Rus- sia, -one party government also is proving bad for Schenectady.\ I wonder if Mr. Male would say that if the Democrats were in of- fice. I also wonder if the City Manager would be non-partisan if the Democrats were in office: It seems to me that the Democrats came into office not too long ago with a program of reform, but un- fortunately 'their plans weren't ef- l!ected. I would like to see non- partisan City Manager government in Schenectady, but I am doubtful that either party can give it to us now.
