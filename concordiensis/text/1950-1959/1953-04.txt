Rushing Is Discussed at Tippecanoe Henderson Will . Play For Juniors' Coronation Ball By Norman E. Scull A ~enLOrial ®·-------------------------------- To be named the \Alumni Mem- orial Field House,\ the building v;ill be a dedication to the 76 alumni who lost their lives in the armed services during World War II. Blood Drive Nearing Goal The Tippecanoe CoafcrcnLC was held on March 29, and a program for future changes were discussed. l-onceu.l~ng cut.s dul'ing Prom weekends, the faculty sentiment seemed to indicate that they didn't mind the cuts prpviding the ex- . cused students attend the Prom rather than go horne. It was also suggested that Prom tickets serve as excuses from classes. The Junior Prom committee has selected Skitch Henderson, His Piano and His Or- chestra to play for the \Coronation Ball,\ Union;s Spring Prom. The date is :.\lay 9, on Sat- urday night, which. ruaxks something new in the annals of l'nion proms. The Prom com- mittee also announced a new low price of $6 per ducat. Detailed drawings \\ill be sub- mitted to contractors for bids im- rr ediately, according to the Presi- dent, and the Executive Committee of the Board is authorized to sign contracts for the beginning of con- struction after bids are in, pro- vided tbe costs are within the funds available to the College. W. HoVI ard Wright, President ot the Schenectady Varnish Company, chairs the Executive Committee, of which the following tru.c;tees are members: Roy C. Muir, retired Vice President of the General Elec- tric Company; Hen. Oswald D. Heck, Speaker of the New York Asserr bly; Charles L. Hequem- bourg, Insurance; and Albert P.

The Committee on Stu- dent Standings is the final deter- mining body for expulsions. Dr. Davidson then mentioned that a Guidance Counsellor Plan was being formulated by the Ad- ministration. He further related that a plan for construction of social facilities in West College is under way. The Concordiensis and the Mountebanks were commended for excellent work. Mr. Ketz told of the lack of com- munication concerning excused cuts for activities trips. A pl!ln where- by slips signed by activity heads was decided upon. In the general discussion two subjects were included. Dr. David- son stated that his question and answer ·chapel Programs would be continued.

This move, which will place 4·~~~~--------..;.....------~----­ Union high in the list of colleges of comparable size in salary brackets, establishes faculty floors at $4,000 for Assistant Professors, $5,000 for Associate Professors, and . $6;000 for full Profe~sors. \This action by the Board,'' stated Dr. Davidson, \was made possible by the allocation of $20,0QO iron:~ the 1952 alumni gift fund by the Alumni Council of the College for the purpose of increasing fac- ulty salaries. \On behalf of the trustees, the faculty and the administration, I wish to express gratitude tu all of our alumni who contributed so generously over the past year to their alma mater, making possible this very vital elevation in the in- come of our faculty. \This is the first instance at Union College of alumni undertak- ing to raise .faculty .salaries,\ the President continued, \and by so doing, the alumni have helpe~ to place Union among the top lOo/c income which reflects an unusually high degree of management. It ·is not because the operating funds are unwisely spent. Again, the op- p·osite is true. ' \Union's philosophy has always been that young men. are entitled to a Union education because of their ability and not beca~e of the financial resources .of their fam- ilies. With tuition now at $600 a year, the Trustees are st1·iving to sustain our philosophy. \But the 'standard of education' for which Union is famous and whl't:h it guards je~;~lously can be sustained only 1f the quality of the faculty remains high. That can be done only if a reasonable and equitable salary scale makes teach- ing at Union attractive from an .economic point of view.\ ---0,--- Mountebank Plays, Financial Success of colleges of its size in the Middle Resltlts of the recent Mounte- Atlantic region in salary scale:\ banks productions of \Prometheus A report on the Hl52 alumni flind Bound\ and \Casina\ were re- of the college by Howard B.

We'd like to get in a little editorial comment on the national scene just to reassure our readers we read com- peting newspapers from time to time. It appears that the new president is getting quite a lot of publicity from the nation's press. We read that Ike is on vacation, he's teeing off ~n the White House's oversized back lawn, and he's playing golf with the masters, but one thing that's not mentioned is that he's getting paid $150,000 per annum for a year of this foolishness. This vacationing business doesn't bother us so much, but it's pretty discouraging when the prexy can't even break a 90 with all that practice. j For Your Information FRIDAY, Al'RIL 17 - Daily As- sembly, speakers, Mr. and Mrs. Muir, painting and sculpture, MC, noon; Faculty Women's Club, Mrs. Hoadley's, 3 p.m.; Demonstration of Painting ·by Mr. and' Mrs. Muir, OC, 3 -5 p.m.; val'sity baseball, Union vs. Rochester at Rochester, 4 p.m. SATURDAY, APRIL 18 - Varsity LaCrosse, Union vs. Hofstra at Hempstead, 2 p.m.; varsity traclt, Union vs. Rochester at Schenec- tady, 2:30 p.m.; varsity baseball, Union vs. Hobart at Geneva, 2:30 p.m. SUNDAY, APRIL 19 - Service of Worship, speaker, Chaplain Sidney Lovett of Yale University, MC, 11 a.m.; organ recital of French Music, Dr. E.

Diggmg back in the college arch1ves, we find that the steps m question have withstood 97 pre- vwus w1nters. They were con- structed dunng the spr-ing of 1856 to replace wooden \stoops\ vvhich were burned by students for fuel during the bitterly cold winter of '55 and '56. Some interesting items weve found when the old fieldstone fac- ings were removed this week. Modern building inspectors· never would have approved the loose brick piles supporting the 450 lb. granite slabs which serve as steps. Strips of crumbly slate had been used atop same of the bricks to level the slabs. The space under most of the steps was hollow and in one of these was found a rusty lunch-box with remains of a cen- tury-old lunch inside. Another con- tained Jayed upon layer of rat- droppings, evidence that probably 500 generations of college rodents had been raised inside. Laurence White, the college architect, made a special trip from· Nc>w York to ad.vise upon details of the reconstruction, <vhich may cost the college several thousand dollars. Mr. White examined thP g-ranite slabs carefully and de- clared that they were a very rare type which were quarried in the long-since abandoned workings at Port Henry on Lake Champlain. Stone from this quarry was·fioated doWn Champlain on flatboats, h~ said, then carried overland to Lake George and placed in other boats Placement News The last of the interviewing schedule will be next week with the fololwing companies complt't- ing our busy schedule: Stt:dents going cluv. ntown witll their Jll:undry pro!Jably have no- ticed that the sL.,.·foot retailHng wall ·beside the Public Librar:y nas given way to the elements thb year. This wall, much younger than the dormitory steps, was erected aboUt 1919 and is bunt pl'i- marily of limestone suar-r1ed near Altamont, so the records say. 'It now threatens to fall and l>lock most of Seward P.\a!)e, not to meq- tion crushing one of the two regu- lar customers on his way ·to the Public Libral'Y· Mr. White, the architect, points out that the city was the 'victim of poor .planning when it built the wall. If it had ·been three feet lower, it would have cost only half as much to reconstruct when it fell down. \That is one of the beauties of the North and South College steps,\ he said. The head of the college Division of Geology, who requested· that his name not be used, insists that the dormitory \stoops\ and the Public Library retaining wall are both .constructed on a variety of glacial drift picked up outside Scotia and that the granite steps of North and South Colleges were quarried near Bennington and brought to Sche- nectady by sleds dui\ing the winter of 1857. This interesting, if conflicting, information. will probably make good raw material for the Commit- tee to Study the Colleg-e at its May rr:eeting, provided ·the April showers haven't undermined the sandstone foundations o:t; Bailey Hall where it expects to hold its meeting.

Just a gentle rPminder that 70 seniors have not turned in a rec- ord sheet for our permanent files. Would you please fill them out and send them over to Wells House before graduation? The college has announced that constr.uction of the pro- posed field house will start soon. It makes maJir people happy to hear this news and no doubt when the edifice is completed many people will enjoy the menefits ~f its erec- tion on campus. Even as necessary as this adCUtion to campus facilities may be considered by some, there is something even more essential in our opinion. That is the erection of suitable living quarters for our faculty members. The campus is considered by many to be one of the nicer ones in the country. Union proclalm;; itself as the first architecturally planned campus in the country and the num- erous additions to the campus in the past fifty years have kept the general shape and form of the original plan so that as the college has increased its plant facilities and number of buildings, the beauty of the campus has not been dis- turbed. This is of course excepting the war time construc- tions. It seems to us that it is now time to get rid of those remaining war time buildings. They served their purposes amply and their presence on campus can only be denoted as eye sores. Facilities for faculty and married students are lacking and new housing to go with the architectural plan of the college is needed rather than the old \temporary\ buildings. These are fast approaching a decade in age and have long since served their functional need. The Union A venue side of the College, extending ll.cross Lenox Road, is just about the nicest .part of Schenectady one can see. But turn down N ott Street from the corner at Lenox Road and you notice a curious paradox-like the out- side of a house being painted while letting the inside remain filthy.

Because both profes-- sors attend all classes, however, their data is more closely inte- grated than would be expected from instructors with such \widely varying backgrounds.\ Meeting for an hour and 20 minutes semi-weekly, \the class periods consist usually of a lec- ture by one of the instr-uctors with the students breaking in inform- ally with questions and discussion . .. The students come from great- ly differing programs of study and have been able to utilize their range of knowledge to ·good ad- vantage both in discussion and in writing.\ Satisfied with the general sub- stance' of the course, the profes- sors would like to continue the program next year. However, they hope to \ . , . rearrange the ma- terials so as to present the major problems of evolution earlier in the year.\ To avoid disappointment, due to over- election in various courses, it is important that students re- port to their advisers promptly.

The cost of manufacturing our products represents 70% of the total expenditure for all operations including research, engineering, marketing and other administrative functions. With these activities and expenditures in the field of manu- facturing one can readily visualize the breadth of opportunity in the area of manufacturing. This wide scope of manufacturing activities and the importance of their integration into an effec- tive organization provide opportunity for challenging and rewarding careers in such areas as follows: Manufacturing Supervision: The most important part of any manufacturing organization is men-those who apply their varied skills and talt:nts to perform the many tasks involved in the manufacturing process_ To direct the activities of these men, to ·inspire performance, co-operation and teamwork, to provide fair and equitable treatment, to see that work is done in required quantity-on time-and at the lowest possible cost, ,. is the responsibility of Manufacturing Supervision. It offers a challenging and satisfying .career for individual growth aild development~ Purchasing: General Electric is one of the most diversified purchasers in the country today, buying material from every industry. Much of this purchasing involves technical problems, and requires a knowledge of sources of supply, market trends, and new products. Many items purchased are components or finished products of other technical industries. Constant contact with price, as well as evaluation of current and long-range raw material supplf situations, is another phase 'of this activity. It is becoming more and more important as a career opRortunity for young men. In addition to the above described areas .of opp~rtunity in manufacturing, such manufacturing services as wage-rate de~ tefmin;J.tioh, production control, ·inventory management, produc- tion planning and development, and materials handling offer opportunity for highly trained: specialization and for competent management supervision. These areas of manufacturing, together with many others, offer the college graduate of today a Wealth of opportunity for a challenging and rewarding career, W?t ~ r ~«kce m_ GENERAL.

K.A. fraternity leads all the rest in the .percentage of members pledging donations, although there are othet· fraternities who are very close to the 100% mark. It remains to be seen after all the blood has been collected, ho>li'ever, who will reheive the award for the highest percentages donating. In other business, Frederic Mor- r.iss Was elected in a runoff with Donald Prager, to the sophomore post on the council recently vacated by Lee Michalsky. Morriss is a member of Theta Delta Chi. Also elected to fill Joseph Wilkinson's spot on the council, was junior Richard Henry, of Delta Upsilon. Henry attended this last meeting while Morriss will take his seat at the next session.

CIRCULATION STAFF Robert Larsen. llouett .\LI8it, ~lm<'o l'-layton, Joseph llollinget Student Elections It has long Lreen the American custom to criticize our representative type of government and then, for these same citizens to remain conspicuous on election day· by their ab- sence at the polls. Cnion College then certainly believes in the American tradition. More and mo1'e we run into the attitude that we find present on this campus today. ''I just don't care.\ It is indeed discouraging to glance at the previous elections that have been held het·e for the various sehoul and class officers and then compare the numbers voting with the actual campus population. Union College has consistently managed to re- main below the discouraging national mark which in 1952, a year mal'ked l>y tremendous interest in the campaign, hit 63o/c. This lack of interest in student government \Vitnessed by these low v<>ting figmes appears to us as no more than the pres,.ent lack of spirit Httending most of the activities offered on this campus. But representative student govern- ment is more than another activity. It represents the basic ideal upon whlch this entire nation is based. and it is sad to see it taken for granted as it now is. Elections for student council and class officers will be held today and next Friday. At Russell Sage, this past week, 59t of the student body turned 0ut for the elections. The college was disappointed. Are we >;atisfied to elect om· officers with less than 50t;'r of the school voting? -G. R. K Hell Week The Union College Campus is at the present, and un- fortunately so, in the middle of the fraternity Hell Week According- to the custom that began with the founding- of the first Greel{ Letter Society, Kappa Alpha, on this campus in 1825, the hai'l'ied pledg-es of most of the present-day 18 fraternities are eng·aged in their most serious trial period- Hell Week. We believe that this trial period represents nothing mor than a past precedent that will be discarded as was the ancient lottery, when people come to realize that it has long since exhausted its usefulness if it did at all own that characteristic. We do not think that we have been too critical of a system that has as its strongest argument the fact that it serves as an ordeal to the neophytes in order to make them appreciate, all the more, the advantages and privileges of brotherhood. We cannot see how a period marke~ by per- sonal service, tedious and nonsensical tasks could make any college man proud to become a member of the group that advocates these policies. They appear to us more like the actions of cruel children than the useful, purposeful plans of grown men. Obviously there are many methods through \vhich pledges WOllld be proud to accept memtership without Hell Week. A ne\v method, Greek Week, which is becoming more and more evident on many campuses, appears to be a saner and more useful substitute. Constructive work, however, as constructive c1'iticism is always difficult. Included in these Greek Weel{s have been many community projects \vhich are not only produdive but also bring plaudits and respect to the coliege community. If we are going to make the pledges work, let's have their efforts result in something that both their houses and their college can be proud of. Along· with this wasted effort it is sad to see one week of the scho-ol years also sacrificed. The time devoterl to Hell Week makes it impossible for the pl':)dg·es to devote the proper time to their studies. It is not an unusual sig-ht dur- ing this period to see these neophytes making up most of their lost sleep- on their ·own class time. Fortunately the administrati&n is progressive enoug-h to consider the fra- ternities mature enoug-h to run most of their affairs; but unfortunately these same houses appear too immature to make use of this situation. We wonder how long the ad- ministraton will eontinue to advise the faculty to permit us to throw away this valuable time. It is no secret that we all are here not to join a fraternity but to further our education. We sincerely hope that the mature individual \vhich this college is striving to develop will overthrow this Hell Week, which appears to exist for no other reason than its having been :founded. -G. R. K. After describing the role and nature of the university in Ameri- can life, the article turned to the question of a university'§. obliga- tions and responsibilities. 'l'he con- clusion is worth quoting. \Finally we assert that freedom of thought and speech is vital to the main- tenance of the Amet·ican system and is essential to the genrral W€'1- fare. Condemnation of communism and its protagonists is not to be interpretL?d as readiness to curb social, political, or Pconomic in- \·estigation and resarch. To insist upon complde conformity to cur- rent beliefs and practices would do harm to the principle of freedom, which is the greatest, the central, American doctrine. Fidelity to that principle has made it possible for the universities of America to con- fer great benefits upon our society and our country. Adherence to that principle is the only guarantee that the nation may continue to enjoy those benefits.\ The pressure to conformity in America today because of war hysteria is enormous.
