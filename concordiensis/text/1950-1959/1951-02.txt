Toward Better Education Union College each year is preventing its students from perfonning an extremely important and valuable function- that of choosing their own professors. Until instructors names are listed with course sections and hours in listings from which students prepare their schedules each spring, the college should feel extremely guilty demanding class attendance. It is surprising to us that the opportunity to choose one's own professors has not been demanded by the students long ago, for an informal poll has revealed that the campus stands lOQ per cent behind any such plan. There appears to be no conceivable reason why the listing is not a part of college policy, which has always professed an attempt l:lit the fullest possible development of a student's capacities. It is inevitable in any college or university that there will be a variety of types of instructors. By the same token, no two students look for the same thing in a p'l'ofessor, and even the administration must agree that a student will learn more and better from a man he respects and likes. Naturally, the opportunity for free choice on the part of a student will be restricted by his own scheduling difficul- ties and by a limitation in the size of class sections. But merely giving them a chance to pick their teachers should eventually lead to a more satisfied student body and happier class attendance. The introduction of this plan should also produce a more subtle effect, but probably a more important one in the long run. Professors would soon find out if they were getting fewer students than their colleagues in other sections of the same course, and a conscientious man would undoubtedly be bothered by such a dilemma. The result might be a \waking up\ of those men who consider teaching a part time job, and a poor one at that. The college administration might also make use of this display of student tastes. If they are interested in offering their ~tudents the best possible instruction, they must pay attentiOn to the way they 1·ate their professors. If a man is consistently avoided when schedules are prepared it is the college's job to find out the reasons and to make changes where changes are needed. The college is now failing to provide Union students with the best possible individual education. We call on the admin!stration to make whatever plans are necessary to in- clude mstructors nal!_les on course listings this spring. An Ignoble Death . Confusion reigns supregte \on the hill,\ but the situ- ation may soon be remedied, at least for future years by the imminent demise of the year system. ' The inter-depru'tmental turmoil has become almost in- tolerable.. Professors :have not decided what their final exams Will cqver nor how they will mark their students at mid term. Most have intimated, however, that they will not follo'Y the policy of testing them on the \w_hole year's work, wp1ch was one of the principal l'easons the college had for adopting the system. Now word comes that, as was predicted earlier in the year, the Faculty Council will soon do away with the unwork- able plan. May it die an ignoble death. ,_ See the Dancing Girls .

HE FINDS it difficult to get ~----~-----.,.---~­ used to the idea of compulsory classes and eight o'clocks; in st. Andrews there are neither of these. Our examination schedule is also new to Bill. Ae St. Andrews there are only three examinations a year. The first two are simply tests which qualify a student for final exams in June. Particularly interesting was his answer to the inevitable question on his reaction to the parties and girls here. It was difficult for him to comment on the beer situation in relation to the parties since there is no liquor of any kind al- lowed on the premises at St. An- drews. Dances there are held about once a week with two formal dances a term. Bill thinks that in general the Scotch gii'ls have \more on the ball\ than most Am- erican girls he has met. He fMls · that our dances are too stereotyped and longs for a good old Scottish dance like an \eightsome reel\ to liven things up a bit.

Group meeting, 7:3() p.m. Old Chapel. THE FI.R:ST thing tQ.at impressed Bill about this country was the breath-taking spectacle of the New York skyline. He vividly described his trip down the Hudson, and the splendor of the skyscrapers coming into view. An ardent track enthusiast, Bill is the joint recordholder cif the 440 at St. Andrews. He didn't think that football was much of a game at first, but after learning of the skill involved, he now enjoys it to a greater extent. One thing which he misses is being able to go out for a game of golf at any odd moment. At St. Andrews four courses were within five minutes reach. An interesting point about the draft here as compared to the pro- cedure followed in Scotland was brought out during the course of the conversation. In Scotland it is-- compulsory to serve for two years b~fore you reach the age of 26. College students may finish their education before serving, whereas others must serve upon completion of high school.

The Student Council took action last Tuesday mght which will probably be the subject of heated debate for years to come. We do not intend to conde~n or to cond'?ne the council's decision to remove Jim Garrmchael fro}fl off1ce. yve would like instead to clarify some of the pomts cloudmg the issue ~o that ~tudents may better judge the college's lawmakers. . . . First it must be pointed out that the Council cond?cted itself well at the meeting, considering the tension and bitter- ness which was in evidence. The members knew what they wanted and, for this reason, the proceedings may have ap- pea.I·ed to be a \railroad.\ It must be remembered, however, tha.t they had several weeks to think the issue over and un- donbtedly had their minds rather set when they entered the r<Jom. d' . Whether the Council had a moral right to 1srmss a man whom the student body had elected as their president is an a.~ademic question. The Council elaimed that Tu~sday' s de- bate was maintained on an impersonal note, but It becomes almost impossible to keep personalities out of sue? disc':s~ sions. A majority of the members made one th~ng qmte elear-that they had soured on Carmichael. Nothm¥ much the ex-president could have done would have saved him that night, but he threw a~ay his last hope by his own untactful actions once the meetmg started. The accusation that Carmichael was \run\ out of office by a dique within the Council is p:robably well-founded. That the attendance question even came up is fair evidence tha.t there was a move afoot to unseat the president. However, the fact that 15 men out of 24 voting members decided against him is pretty good proof that the action migh~ pos- sibly have been wan•anted. As a student body president, Carmicha.el failed in many respects, an dhis athletic activities prevented him from devoting the necessary time to the posi- tion-in fact, prevented him from even attending all the meetings. A new election is scheduled for next Thursday to choose between two candidates who competed against Carmichael last spring and who have been nominated again. It might be noted that Carmichael was a scant winner in that ballot- ingwhich attracted only 500 voters. Elsewhere on this page, a reader calls for write-in votes for Carmichael. This seems like th~ best way to determine how many men still are strong- ly in favor of the deposed leader. It is extremely important that every Union student at- tends next Thursday's chapel to hear the candidates and to cast his vote, so that this time the student body elects a president who is a true majority winner. \Fair Weather\ Supporters?

6 Elmer Tidmarsh Marks 25th Anniversary Here Dr. Ehner A. Tidmarsh's 264th organ recital a week ago Sunday marked his 25th anniversary as music • of Union College. Through these years, Dr. Tidmarsh constantly strived to stimulate student interest in through recitals, courses, musical organizations and per- sonal encouragement. His goal is to let the student see the, importance and value of the thing about which he has built his life-music. DR. TffiMARSH'S activities~·-----~------­ have not been limited to the col- lege campus. He directs many musical groups in Troy, Albany, Schenectady and Poughkeepsie. Born in Sandy Hill, New York, Dr. Tidmarsh did not develop an intense interest in music until his teens. He had seriously considered · law as a career, but the home in- fluence on him was too strong; his father and grandfather were dance band leaders. Conventionally e n o ugh, t b i s music career started with the plano. Young Elmer made his de- but when the pianist in his father's band got sick and he had to take his place. DR. TIDMARSH went from the dance band to the Guilamont Organ School in New York City and helped meet expenses by work- ing as organ4lt in one of the near- by churches. He completed his course with honors and received the degree of Associate in the American Guild of Organists. In 1933 he was conferred the degree of Doctor of Music by Union Col- lege and in 1936 received the award of Officer of the Palms of the French Academy. DR. ELMER A.

A Weekend Nonetheless This weekend Union is trying something new-a Winter Weekend without a prom and without any winter. Despite the obvious shortcomings that a climate like Schenectady's has for staging winter affairs, we feel that the weekend should be a highly successful one, at least for fraternity men. After all, a college-planned event, even though it offf:rs nothing too much but a common social date for the enhre campus, at least gives students an opportunity to invite a girl up for the weekend without causing \raised eyebrows.\ We have a few suggestions for you independents who may feel you are being left out of the ;festivities. Take in the progressive jazz concert in MC tonight, and make use of your rathskeller, which has extended its hours to serve you. And tomorrow, make yourself at home at any or all of Union's fraternities. You're always welcome. Dear Editor: The demonstration of tyrranical taotics in Thursday's Chapel meet- in:g only furthers our desire for good representative government on this campus. Why wasn't a meet- ing of the Student Body held as announced by Pres. Davidson? Why was President pro-tem Ger- ald Parker so conspicuously absent f.rom the session? The sentiment of the students was strongly in favor of returning James Carmichael to office, and in order to do this there is only one course .of action .open-have a meeting of the entire student body in the immediate future, by Wed\ nesday Feb. 28, if possible. At that time we should vote .to repudiate ·the ouster action of the Council, thus retaining Carmichael in of- fice. Also, if the public mandate persists, recall this present CouniCil that has disregarded public opinion. Let us not forget this ·One point -Jim Carmichael was elected by the Student Body, not by the Stu- dent Council, also the fact that seems inconsequential to the ·COun- cil members, that the council presi- dent is also the px;esident of the student body. Strange that this same student body is not allowed to nominate a candidate or even vote for one on a write-in-ballot. Sincerely yours, Caryle J. Sherwin '51 James :r. McGrath '52 John P. Kennedy '52 Bud Souhan '51 Dear Editor: I am glad to see that the D. U;'s are willing to work so hard to win a carton of' cigarettes. For what other purpose would their letters to the editor be written? Surely they don't expect them to be taken seriously. They are also to be commended for their objective point of view inn face of their fraternal relations with the subject of the letters. It is very gratifying to note their sudden interest in student govern- ment. But I would like to point out one or two minor items which were apparently beyond their com- prehension: 1. Because there is no student Supreme Court the council has to assume that duty. If the council's interpretations of the constitution are il)egal because they are ex post facto so are the Supreme Court's. 2. As for worrying about re-elec- tion in: the face of a do-nothing record: How many people look at the record before voting? a.

T:Q.e Cou~ci1 had taken a short recess when Howie Simons rose to speak. Anything said during a re- cess of the Council has the same effect as a Bull Session~ Simons said that he did not like the fact that none of the members bad asked· their constituents whether they thought Carmichael should be ousted or not. He also 'bemoaned what he felt was personal dislike for Carmichael. I decided to argue with Simons on the first point, and to disregard the second. In answering Simons , I said something to the effect that we are like legislatol'S, lilte Senators, and were responsible at elections. I then said, \They don't tell us what to do; we tell them what to do.\ This is a play on words, a good rhetorical device, but is also a very extreme statement <Jf something which I believe. I started to ex- pand the statement, and qualify it, so that the members would realize what I meant. I looked around, and saw that next to nobody seemed to care, so I sat down. Then Petrak spoke, and I decided that somebody was interested, so after he sat down, I g()t up again. I started to say that I was glad to get Simons' .opinion ·out in the open, when I realized that this time everybody was even more bored, sG I sat down. After all, it was a recess. One of the main purposes of the Student Council is to try and get the administration and the faculty to make changes in the college policy which we feel is in the best interest of the people the college is here to benefit-the students. This makes the Student Council your \lobby\, In doing this, men on the Council come up with ideas, which, at first glance, a.re liable to rub some people the wrong way. It would be fruitless for the Coun- cil to try and find out what every student thinks, and then recom- mend that, because this would re- quire arguing with every single student. These ideas ~orne from Council members, who, ;presuma'Qly, have the time to investigate these problems. Asking a Counc!l mem· ber to try and \sell\ his Idea to the students as a whole is rldicu· lous. That is what the Council is there for, to decide these p1·oblems without boring the students, If the students disagree with the Council, let them come to the meetings, and if they cannot persuade us there, let them persuade the others to vote us out of office. We have the time to consider the problems; but not the time to ask au the stu- dents whether or not they agree, and tabulate the result::~. In acting on these ideas, we sometimes make decisions which are binding on the students, and in so doing, \we tell t'jlem what to do.\ That Is what I was driving at. Remember High School English? Remember the \Topic 2entence at the beginning of the paragraph\? That is w:Pa.t my statement was. The Council felt that Car- michaets attitude was preventing the discussion nf any real problem, so, in order to do the greatest good for the greatest number, he was ousted. If anyone still disagrees with me and doubts that these ideas are Democratic, I refer then to the United States Government, any Government prof on campus, or myself. Thank you, Jay, for letting me sound off. EUGENE UNDEBWOOD Famous Chinese and American Foods LUM FUNG Restaurant BEST LIQI:JORS AND COCKTAILS Part of the responsibility of an artist is to reflect the feelings of his· time. Sidney Kingsley, in his adaption of thur inspired novel, \D a r k n e s s at Noon,\ forebodes a theatre trend by partially ach-, ieving this in his play of the same name whic opened at the Al- vin Theatre in New York last month. The play i~ told through an intro- spective medium and deals pri- marily with the moral and spiritual downfall ·Of a once active lead€r in the Communist Party. N. R. Rubashov, intuitively played by Claude Rains, is imprisoned for \having conspired against the Party.\ ·The leaders want to avoid the martyrdom of Rubashov and the now powerful group wish a full confession before his execution. Morally strengthened by his fellow cellmates, he is determined to die a martyr. But the aged prisoner is ultimately beaten. Torture, star- vation-neither of these has a catalystic effect. It is the realization that he has spent his life working for a cause for which he now must die that brings Rubashov's confession. The only justification he can find for his death is that it serve a pur- pose. He finds that the revolu- tion, with which he was once so closely identified, has now become an end in itself. The idealistic fer- vor which had bee n a basic drive in the Party has ceased to exist. He sees himself a disillusioned and lonely man at death. · By his own admission, Kingsley's ·play, as were a! !his others, is .primarily a commercial venture. Nevertheless, it succeeds, as does Koestler's original novel, in setting up a moral signpost towards a «;lecadent totalitarian system. How- e:ver, it is so written that the audi- ence is robbed of the privilege .of reaching alternate conclusions about the wisdom of Kingsley's do well for mirrors to reflect a little themselves before sending, back images. The play is propaganda. With that in mind, one can enjoy the show passing over the too frequent melodramatic injections .(\I can't pay the rent!\-\You will pay the rent!\). Kingsley . had four alter- natives: he could have damned Russia, as a totalltarian example, he could have damned Russia as Russia, plot the story as aru in- dividual tragedy, or examined the roots of sick society which grew to a fungus growth. Either the third or fourth of these would have con- stituted. a major drama; he chose a combination of the · first and second. If the play is only adequate, Rains does his best to make it vital. Kim Hunter, as his secre- tary, gives an able and convincing performance. Fnederick Fox's sets are imaginative, decorative, and utilitarian. The audience is: im: mediately taken and awed by his ability. Talten as a whole, I think the play is not only timely in its sub- ject, but also combines elements of good theatre practice. It is worthwhile seeing. For Your Information FRIDAY, FEB. 23.

You see, telephone equipment occu- pies valuable space, uses costly mate- rials. Paring down its size helps keep down the cost of telephone service. Take voice amplifiers, for example. Telephone engineers put the squeeze on size, came up with a new small type. When 600 of these new ampli- fiers are mounted on a frame two feet wide and eleven feet high, they do a job which once required a roomful of equipment. Size was cut- but not performance!
