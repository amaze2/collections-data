Their decision appears to be the same as last year. Text of the statement follows: ------~---------'.---------0 With formal rushing just com- Miss Webster Discusses US Theatre The \Living Theatre'' and its future in the United States was the topic of a Sf)eech delivered in Memorial Chapel Wednesday evening by Miss Margaret Webster, noted directress and actress. The lecture was sponsored by the Schenectady chapter of the American Association of University Women. Need for Good Theatre Why the theatre has fallen away in this country, the necessity for having good theatre, 'and the means by which we can insure the longevity of the theatre were the focal points of Miss Webster's speech. Although the theatre has diminished, Miss Webster affirmed that \We cannot expect its role to be taken over by such other media as radio, television or mo- tion pictures.\' H o w e v e r, the theatre's existence · is threatened bec;:tuse these methods of enter- tainment are a glut on the enter ~ tainment world, reaching the vast audiences that they do. Theatre Vital Yet, according to Miss Webster, \The theatre is different from these media and much more im- portant. The Living Theatre has an electric contact between the atcor and audience, it is a more vital intellectual stimulus, and it draws the best of writers and ac- tors.\ Also, stated Miss Webster, drama \preserves our language, and is the greatest medium we have for the expression of living terms.\ For these reasons we still have a need for theatre. However, eco- nomic interests have risen to the fore , especially since the advent of television. Touring companies are not as profuse as they were thirty years ago, and as a result the \theatre-going habit has dis- appeared.\ However, there are some cures to the problem, asserted the speaker , using as examples recent repertory theatre successes in New York City. Groups such as the New York City Center and the Jean Louis Barrault players draw faithful, high-intellect crowds fo see such productions . as Shakes- peare, Shaw and Ibsen. More Road Companies For the preservation of the theatre, several avenues must be opened. More road compan - ies traveling into the hinterlands will stop. the centralization of the drama in New York City, and spread its advantages to other audiences. A drive for municipal and state \subsidies would also be effective. \Perhaps said Miss Webster, \the theatre could become even more competitive in an eco- nomic :vein, having a lobby for sponsors to display their goods.\ In conclusion, Miss Webster de - rided the idea that the theatre will just \keep getting along.\ She said \We must harness our faith and enthusiasm in dramaturgy. The theatre must be rebuilt from the ground up, and that growth must start outside of New York City. pleted, this would seem a proper time to raise l'he question of the plan that js to be in effect for rushing and pledging n-t year, Since this matter must be definite~ ly decided upon before the close of college in June, the people re- sponsible for malting the necessary decisions should begin planning at once. Last year ther.e appears to have been misunderstanding in some quarters about the position taken by the Administration, and for this reason we think it wise to make our attitude as clear as possible at the outset. · Our thinking begins with the prerr.ise that it is our responsibil- ity to provide the best environ- ment that we can for study and learning. Past experience derr.on- strates · beyond all reasonable doubt that a rushing program which extends over several weeks of the fall and which inevitably disturbs the freshrr.en during the most critical time in their . process of learning how to study is unwise. One reaches, therefore, the same conclusions that were drawn last year, namely, that rushing must: a. Take place and be completed in the opening days of the fall semester, in a period ~ertainly not longer than two weeks at the most, or; b. Be postponed until the second semester as it was this year. Of thP tw•o systrons, we are in- clined to feel that the second alternative is the better. This is not a proposition which is sus-- ceptible to any certain proof but several lines of evidence suggest its correctness. We hope that those concerned with the managen:ent and opera- tion of the fraternities will give immediate thought to this whole matter in order that the necessary decisions be reached before the beginning of final examinations on .the first of June. ----0•------ Senior A wards .Seniors are reminded that the index earned as of the ad-interim period ending on March 27 is the index used in corr.puting stage ap- pointments, pl'izc awards, etc. Be~ fore the mid-term recess each senior will be able to obtain his class standing from the Recorder's office. This index will rerr.ain as the official index until after final examinations in June. Some students are not familiar v. ith the rules for figuring a final accumulative index for four years. This is done by multiplying the in- dex earned in the freshman year by 15 . points , the index in the sophomore by 25 credits and the . index in junior and senior year by 30 credits. The result of credits earned in the four years is then divided by 100. Credits earned at other institutions are never figured in the accumulative standing, e. g. a student entering' Union College v. ith junior standing is given 30 credits for the junior year and 30 credits for the senior year and this result is divided by 60. ~--o--- Freshman Notice The new meal ticket for the sec- ond half of the current semester should be pi(')ked up from Mrs. Briggs in West College between the d!!>tPs, MARCH SO-APRIL 1 .from 12 noon till 6:00 p.m. HOWEVER, the $27.00 FOR BOARD WILL BE PAYABLE WITH THE DORMITORY RENT AT THE BUSINESS OFFICE BE- TWEEN THE DATES APRIL 13,. 18 INCLUSIVE. ~ . .

The affair made an unbelievable t0tal of well over $200 which will be turned over to the campus chest. That noble deed would seem to fare well in making out next year's social calendar. At the Student Council meeting- 'Tuesday night it was suggested that the Military wee1cend displace the IF~ fall prom while the IFC could assemble together a Wmter Weekend and then go all out for a Spring Prom. We don't know the chance that this suggestion has to pass the Council, but in view of the surprising success of the recent weekend, it doesn't seem out of line. 3 o.-.e Part Wisdom ll By Eliot Loshak Two weeks· and three daya after the Founder's, Day ceremonies at Unien, a more publicized and to me, a -more awe- some one, oc- curr-ed, On March, 14, the United· Stat e.s Military· Academy brated its anni¥ersary a Founder's Dinner.

The Stewart Air Force Base Band received nothing but applause and aG~olades on their play- ing, and it's hard to forget the profit of over $200 which was made on the affair and which was turned over to a charitable organization. H would seem te us here at the Concordiensis that the \Esprit de Corps\ which the ROTC has been harping on ever since its inception on the college campus, has finally come to the surface. Backing for all college functions, such as shown by the AFROTC for their first social initiation into the life of the colleg-e, would be an enviable prize to attain. Pel'haps the entire school could really get together on Parents' Weekend to However, on my way back here a disturbing thought kept recur- ring. If Harvard is \Harvard!\ why can't Union ·be \Union!\ .As things stand now Union, if the name is farr.iliar at all to anyone, i9 confused with the noted theo- logical seminary in New York. It would be quite easy to pass this sad state of affairs off to a· poor public relations office. But I think that this is .superficial. I believe the root of the problem lies in a w·ell formed, well preserved atti- tude on the part of the administra- tion concerning Union. This atti- tude has spread and now envelops the offices of the college (includ- ing the Public Relations Office), the faculty, and recently the stu- dents in the guise of no apparent college spirit and the evident de- mise of activities. Getting back to Harvard, the startling thing about the Harvard man's attitude to-ward his school is that he is aware of its import- ance and its important people not of a hundred years ago, nor even thirty years ago-but of import- ance today. How many students here know that among today's graduate& of Union University (the whole University is: the only fair way to compare it with Harvard) is an Associate Justice of the Su- preme Court of the United States or that one of the leading pioneers and research men in the vast new field of television industry a11d head of General Electric's televi- sion work is a Union graduate, or that the Vice-Pl•esident of RCA is an active trustee of Union. What a difference in spirit if these men would address the classes in gov- ernment, electronics, and eco- nomics once a year and we hon- ored these living testimonies to Union's glory in our chapel.

Field House Today at 5:01 Eastern Standard Time, Spring arrived in the outer and inner limits of Schenectady and by a former article in the Concordy entitled \Field House Spring- Possibility,\ the field house should now be under construc- tion. It isn't and it won't be for the time being. But there will be a field house, sometime in the near future. Harvard has been one institu- tion since its inception. It pas an unbroken tradition. Union has been two colleges and I think the crux of the problem lies in the failure of the powers that be to recognize the implications of this. Our tradition' (and we have plenty of it) deals with the first Union College which died in the late years of the last century. The old Union College must have been quite a place. One of the best sources of information about it is the 1953 college catalogue. Seven and one half of the eight paragraphs deal- ing with the history Qf the college is devoted to its glory. Those were the days of the progressive liberal arts at Union College. Those were the days when Harvard, Yale, and Princeton fought to keep on a level our 100 matriculated students would be our master public rela- tions staff. Are we forever .doomed to cele- brate Fitzhugh Ludlows of Union's Victorian Age7 If so, Union's death as a top prestige school is in the forseeable future. Being interested in the field house project, we got in touch with Harold Van de Car, who is the college's financial director. Actually, his authority in the field house was over when he raised the required amount and handed it over to the board of trustees. The matter then -passed out of his hands. Van de Car raised $354,000 in the campaign when $350,000 was needed. Harl the college started the project then, chances are now that the field house would be used for indoor practice of the spring: sports. But the water is_ under the bridg·e and this mistake can't be l'ectified. For Your Information Then what about the start of construction now? That doesn't seem likely because the colleg-e doesn't want to go ahead with the building until all the funds are in. lnci- dentally, the cost of the field house has zoomed to about a half-million dollars, although the college has its archi- tects busy attempting to cut costs somehow so as to make the field house more of a near future proposition. Many people want the field house sbtrted now but the cold hard facts seem to forestall its erection until such time as the administration feels it is ready. They say that we've gotten along quite well for the past H'iO years without ohe and it's worth our while to wait a few more years to get one.

Johnson of the Char- acter Research Project, MC, 11 a.m. The college's endowment is approximately $11,000,000 and while that seems quite a large sum, it must be remem- bered that the college can only use the inc()me derived from the money in tl'Ust. That money is taken up in salaries, maintenance, scholarships, and the numerous other ex- penses that the college is confronted with. To cut down the endowment and thereby decrease the interest received, the administration would have to cut corneTs in other parts of the college. It's bad economks to lose in-terest and lessen endowment to put up a field house which won't bring any l'eturn in the foreseeable future.

Last May, 103 .points were donated by ID.etn- bers of the undergraduate body and the faculty and administration. A quota of 400 pints has been set by this year's committee. The in- crease in the quota comes as the result of the abolition of the Ellis Hospital collecti on center, which cut down on the number of the on-campus donations last May. Pledge donation cards will be passed out in the dormitories and fraternity houses beginning next Tuesday. Students under 21 years of age rnust have parental permis- sion, and those undergraduates who have not attained 19 years of age by the date of donation will not be eligible to give bloo<l. Parental permission slips for the 18-21 age group will be attacl)ed to the pledge forms. The blood collected by the Red Cross is used both in Korea and on the home front, especially in the treatment of Polio in the latter case. In response to a Concordi- ensis quer-y, Dr. Alexander Arony, college physician, reported that there is .. no toxic effect.. from blood-giving, He gave as examples, General Electric and Telephone Company employees, who ret11rned to work within a half-hour after donating. Council Offers TrOphy As In the past, the Student Coun- cil will award an engraved trophy to the dormitory or fraternity with the largest percentage of eligible donors. Freshmen who are farternity pledges are instructed to make sure that their house !'\eceives credit for the donation if they (the frosh) sign pledges in the dovtni- tory. A meeting of the dormitoi'Y and fraternity repi'esentatives foz· the Blood Drive will be held 1!1 the Hale House lounge, Monday, March 30, at 7:00 p.m. Interview is Decisive In order to be chosen for this great honor a student must have a high scholastic average and an impressive list of extra-curricular activities. The most Important criterion for selection, however, is the personal In tervlew which each prospective eandidate must have with the committee. After these interviews Mr. Martin was the overwhelming c::hoice of the com- mittee. Since his arrival ·at Union, Mar- tin. has consistently been on Dean's List. His activities include the Mountebanks, the Garnet, and the Idol.

Also, the Idol has been moved to the rei];I' of the gym and the paths between the gym and Washburn Hall re- located. Twenty-five trees have been planted.\ Another prgress report is found in the trustees' minutes for Oc- tober 16, 1915: \Since the June meeting many improvements to the grounds have been made, the most Important of which follow: a concrete walk and roadway leading from the college office (in what is now Geology) around the library .to North Lane; a concrete walk frollb Washburn Hall to Payne gate; work com- pleted on the culvert ovet• College B!'ool{ near the Nott Street gate and commencement of a roadway from North College to Nott Street.

He was aslti.ng- also that an architect be :retailed to make the first plan .for eK:.pansion at the col- lege since the H .. amee work of 1813. He was asking for $5,000 for elec- trical equipment, a new Chemistry · Building, a. n.ev -~uilding for Civil Engineering an<! for $30,000 with which to build s!K faculty houses. Lack of :fur.tds: prevented the trustees from granting aU of Presi- dent Raymo:nct•s requests, but a start was m.ad-e. In fact, as we When warm weather finally ar- rives, students with a few moments time and a yen for exercise would do well to stroll through the lower end of\ V\!ile Cemetery in sear.ch of the \Union College plot.\ This secluded little glade, five minutes walk .from the busiest part of town, is a vestige of {he 19th century, when Schenectady was a smaller, prettier town. I listened critically to the State of the Union add1:ess, and heard an outstanding ~peech outlinir.g a sound compreh~Cnsive program, with possibly o'lle exception. This was the proposal ,that the secret treaties signed at Yalta and Pots- dam be renounced. My immediate reaction., upheld later by politica1 experts, was concerned with the harm which would be dea:lt to the integrity of our nation if we held it to be our perogative to renounce agreements at our convenience. It was the United States of America which was boun.d to those agree- ments. The principle, if adopted, would result in the justification by the Russians of renouncing their Blood Drive The Red Cross needs bl()od! And the Red Cross has asked the college fo1· suppo1t in its drive to obtain the life-giving substance for .Korea and Civil Defense and fol' its new use i~ treatment of Polio cases. The Bloodmobile will be on campus May 5 and the drive for the pledges starts l\Iarch 31 and will continue until April 4. The blood committee seeks the support of better than -1Ql)( of the scl1ool population when it asks for 4QO pints. For a \Vorthy ch·ive such as this, it would be well for the college to go all out in the campaign and surpass the proposed quot;;1.. Mountebanks a Success The :Uountebanks have extended themselves in their productions of the two plays from the ancient classical theatre. \Prometheus Bound\ and \Citsina''have gone over very well and the credit g·oes to all who pa1'ticipated to make the show a success. ;\lost (}f the people questioned about the actual per- formance coulcl find nothing \\TOng with it. By all means it was one of the bette1· jobs done on the 1\iountebank stage in recent years, and it touches \WinteTset\ for those honors. Even Don Jones is reported to be more than pleased with. the work of his young wards. And that's going sam~. look at our cullege today it is diffi- cult to picture it without its gates and fences, its f 1·aternity houses, its chapel. Yet, a.ll these appear_ed within a few\ slwzt years early in the century. In 1895, Delta Phi Fraternity petitioned the college for a lot across the r<Jad :from Psi Upsilpn upon which to i:luild its own house. The Delts stated tllat they would be equally w ell~sa.tis.fied with a lot on North College lane near \Green Gate.\ SirntLlta.neously, Sigma Phi asked for a. I ot \between Alpha Delta Phi a:nd ?si Ups'ilon\ (pre- sumably about where the chapel now stands.) ::Ifu th requests were granted, but it vas: not until 1915 that the trustees' minutes report \with satisfactioa\ the completion of the Delta P·hi House. The Sig- ma Phi Place 'Wa..s <>pened in 1905, but (J,ike Delta ?hi) at a different location tha.n the one originally granted. Once a building- has been erected, it is hard for <O:ne to remember how things loolted without it. Hence, a reading of the Tt·ustees' minutes for January, l.914, causes one to blink: \The new gyoonasium is com- pleted except for minor details and it is very sa.tis:factClry. We recom- mend the appr-oporiation of a sum, not to exceoed $6,500, for alterna- tions to tllie old gymnasium to render it suitabl<e as a dormitory for 28 students. (Old Gym served On the side of a little pcmd pro- tected by a wrought iron fence, lie the graves of ne•arly three dozen Union faculty and their families. Standing beside the grafe of Jona- than Edwards, Jr., the college's sec- ond president, one looks down through the old trees at a placid pond dotted with lily pads and rimmed by one of the city's few remaining dirt roads. They buried Professor Rotundo In the college plot two weeks ago, be- side the grave of Earl Cummings, his former teacher, as he had re- quested. Not far away is the last resting place of Johnny March, an- other beloved Union professor, who passed away only a short time be- fore Professor Rotundo. Union's \college ylot\ just a step from the campus is almost the only one of its kind in America. It came Into existence because the college once owned all the land be- tween .. the present campus and State Street. In July, 1863, Judge Alonzo Paige reported to the Board of Trustees that \the real estate south of the campus has been sold to the Vale Cemetery Company, re- serving forever about three acres to be used by the college as a burial ground for officers of the college and their families and of other persons connected with the institution.\ Three years later, the remains of Jonathan Edwards, J·r., were moved from another cemetery to Vale and he became the first in- habitant of \th~ college plot.\ From wl1at we can see, the production was successful throughout. The sets were beautiful, the house was sold out for all the performances with the exception of the first Thursday 11ight pe1·formance, and the direction and acting were fine. The thespians more than made up the $70-plus lost on the fall presentation of \Second ThTeshold.\ For Your Information What pmticularly stli.lCk us was. the amount of pub- licity placed by the Mountebanks around the Schenectady area. The Greek Theatre display by Professor Jones was unusually striking and was most wisely placed in one of the most focal points of Schenectady-in the window of the Schen~ctady Gazette. Posters were placed in most of the downtown stores, and, on many of the telephone poles within the city. The campus was virtually overrun with Mountebanks literature and the local papers did their share to call attention to the college's theatrical efforts in ancient classical drama. It was this publicity n1me than any one thing perhaps, that brought the people to see the play and so made the show the s1.1ccess that it was. Many mol'.e of the local theatre goers or lovers tumed out for this college function than for any other in recent years. The students supported it to the hilt, the faculty enjoyed a good performance, and the local goers saw the best Schenectady has offered to the thea:trical palate in recent years. Everybody seemed satisfied. FRIDAY, JII:A:R. 27-AD-INTERIM SCHOLARSBIP REPORT; Daily assembly, T'he 'Thursday Musical Club, under' the direction of Dr. E. A.

How can we demand more of our teams and the coaches that what we. give to them? Union College does not go QUt of its way to achieve winning squads.

The students set up their own requirements for church attendance, school grades, and citi- zenship, The lucky people that take the trip are approvc•d, first by the Fountain Club, then by the par- ents, the chut·ch, and finally the school.
