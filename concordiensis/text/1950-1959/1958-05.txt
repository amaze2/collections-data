Social Code: A Proposal In a recent editorial, the Concordiensis noted faults in Union's social code. Comparison of these rules with those of schools like Amherst, Hamilton and RPI indicates that Union needs to give consideration to revision of its regula- tions and act to improve them. The Concordiensis proposes that the College adopt a realistic view of twentieth century social conditions and that the student body through the Student Council act to revise the rules. We suggest the following revisions: 1. That women be allowed in dormitory rooms and fraternity house private rooms until 5:30 P.:\1. on 'veek- ends with two couples in a room. 2. That women be allowed in fraternity house private rooms until 9:30 P.M. on party weekends with two couples in a room. 3. That students be permitted to keep alcoholic bev- erages in their rooms. These revisions are contingent upon the l!nion man's behaving with \conduct befitting a gentleman.\ We furth- er recommend that fraternities set up their o'\vn regulatory agencies. The Concordiensis hopes that the House Presidents' Council and the Student Council will consider these t•evis- ions and act to bring Union's social code to a realistic level. We would be happy to send a representative to a committee which could be established for this purpose. or provide information gleaned from other campuses. Union Profs and Research In the past few years, many of Union's professors have been busily engaged in a wide variety of scientific research projects. Mainly sponsored by private in- stitutions, they include interesting topics in chemistry. physics and engineering. In the field of biochemistry Pro- fessors WilHam B. Martin and Henry M. Butzel are working on a seven-year project in the field of \The Sex Life of Paramecia.\ Under this humorous title they are trying to discover why one- celled animals reproduce the same line repeatedly. The National Sci- ence Foundation is financing the project because of its relationship to cancer research. Many Engineering Projects The greatest number of projects have been conducted in the field of engineering. Professor H. Gil- bert Harlow, chairman of that department, has been influential in the development of two types of shielding materials fot· nuclear reactors. One is of high density concrete which is currently being used in many government and in- dustrial installations for atomic energy. The other is a shield molded by vibrating dry aggre- gates normally bonded in con- crete. The aggregate used in shield.ing is usually very expensive .but by using Professor Harlow's technique It can be recove!'ed from temporary installations and 1·eused. Professor Bibber of the Elec- trical Engineering Department has designed a visual aid device to demonstrate the flux in the air gap of an electric machine. The department has also built a p011table unit VI hich can be rolled into the classroom. Although not unique. it is one of the best exe- cuted gadgE'ts to explain the func- tioning and principles of' opera- tion of electric motors and gen- erators. Other research in this department include work on va- cuum tube development and in- formation filters. Professor William C. Aubrey of the Mechanical Engineering De- partment has underta!{en a fas- cinating research project on air bearings. By using these devic·es extremely heavy materialg cl'!n he supported by a cushion of air. These bearings are very import- ant in nuclear experiments since no~mal oil bearings tend to be- come radioactive. Studies Cosmic Rays In 1951, Professors Rojansky of the Physics Department, began a study of cosmic rays. Work has been eonHnued and the present phase of the project is an atte'inpt to find out whether the arrival of these rays is completely ran- dom or if there is some tendency toward clustering. For the past three years the Research Corpor- ation has supported the undertak- ing, and f.inal results are expected In the sprirtg. The equipment for the cosmic ray study consists· of racks of elect·ric counter circuits to record the arrival of the rays as shown by light flashes in a plastic scin- tillating material. These flashes a.re converted into electric pulses by photomultiplier. Letters To The Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: On behalf of the Junior Prom Committee, I would lilte to ex- press my sincere thanks to the members of the Junior .Class who helped to make Prom Weeltend a success, and .to the student body In general for their conduct and cooperation at the Jazz Concert. John M. Ferguson, President, Class of '59 To the Editor of Concordiensls: I would like to thank the stu- dent body for their cooperation In observing the smoking and drinking rules at last Saturday's Jazz Concert.

Actually the word Jazz is a misnomer. Superficially i t may have sounded like the real thing, but that was as far as It went. The group al- t e r n a t e d be- tween attempts at wild swinging, with psuedo-bop saxes, drums, bass and piano uniting in a hor- rible cacaphony of sound, and genteel, prescious, psuedo-sophisti· cated cocktail music. The effect that the constant switching of these two styles produced was ex· tre1pely ludicrous. Bryce Rohde and the bassist, Jimmy Gannon, it is · impossible to say anything - for musically they said nothing. Errol Buddie, on tenor and bas- soon, showed occasional flashes of competence. Perhaps in other sur- roundings he would have made more of his abi1ity. But hampered by the AJQ's tricky, cute arrange- ments it would be difficult for even a great artist to express himself. Bright Spots There were two bright spots in the evening. In the first half of the program, the AJQ played a fugue in which Buddle looked particularly well. In the second half, the group somehow managed to play the second movement of a Bill Hollman piece straight. Un- fortunately this reflected less on the originality of the AJ'Q than on the talent of Hollman. Drummer Was Schizoid The group was personified in Musio Commercialized the drummer.

Darwin died in 1882, •but the rediscovery of Mendel's wor-k on genetics didn't start until the turn of the century. Consequently, an- other of the course's aims is to show just how· much of Darwin's theory remains and just how much of it has been altered. The Origin -of the Species is the basic book of I.D. 36, but An Introduction to Evolution by Paul Amos Moody might be considered the text of the course. In addi- tion, a large suggested reading list is offered as each subject is covered. Sparked by the dual observance of Darwin's ·birthday and the pub- l'ication of the Origin of Species, I.D. 36, under the •guidance of two veterans, promises to be in the -center ring, academically speaking, of the Union Colle>ge arena In 1958-59.

Among its powers are the elec- Uons of the editors and business · mana.gers of undet·graduate pub- lications, and the controlling of all contracts made by representa- tives of the various publications which run beyond the beginning of the .following school year. Voting members of the Publica- tions Board include the editors-in- chief and the business managers of tbe Concordiensis, Idol and Garnet, the editor of the Fresh- man Record, a member of the Stu- dent Tax Committee, the Dean, and the faculty advisors of the t:hree aforementioned publications. Also represented but without a vote, are the Coordinator of Stu- dent Activities, and the Direetor of Public Relations. Briefly about the member pub- lications: The Oonoordiensis is a weekly newspaper, published 25 times durillg the school year. Alterna- ting between four and six page issues, all students, faculty and staff receive them Friday eve- ning. The IdOl: Union's Painted Tradition The Idol is a quarterly literary magazine which is published spor- adically during the year. The J:dQl usually manages to publish its final two issues before sum- mer vacation starts, but students often must wait for them, and for the Garnet, until they return in the fall. The Garnet Is the College Year- book. All member of the upper three cl~ses receive copies of this publication. Freshmen receive the J!'reslmman Record instead. The grotesque .fe;~otures of the Idol, aa it originally appeared on the campus scene in 187«.

Philomatheans: Oldest Club By Simoo Gallo Founded in 1793, the Philomath- eon Society is the oldest activity on campus. In fact, it antedates the college by two years since it 'vas founded before the college, whieh was known as ·Schenectady Academy, was granted its charter. The Society is the debat'ing or- ganization on campus. Each yeav it participates in several inter- collegiate debate tournaments. Among these are tournaments at :Hamilton, University of Vermont, RaiVard, MIT, Brooklyn College, Boston University, and Siena. These tournaments are intellectu- ally stimulating and also p{·ovide fine social weekends. Th.e Philomatheans fenjoy a fine rer>utation among colleges in the Nort.heast., Three years ago one of its teams placed among the top five teams at the District Sec- tionals, which includes colleges in New England and New York State.

Einhorn Friday, May 9. 1958 Campus Cullings . By Lynn Ratner Individuali2;ed study on the style of Union's 56 courses was the subject of an editorial in a recent issue of The Slddm:Ore News. illdi tor Susan Swire felt that the 'institution of such a pro- gram \may represent the initial step toward' a college honors pro- gram.\ At present Skidmore does not have 56 ty:pe courses of indi- vi'dual research. The situation is .para<:loxical when compared to the state of affairs at Unien. We do have the 56 type of individual'ized course study, but we have yet to •see it materialize into a full hQ!lOI'S pro- gram. The €oncordlensis has been campaigning for such a pro- gram just as Tile Slddmore News has petHiened for a '56 plan. \The recognition of the need .for individualized study,\ writes Edi- tor Swhe; \has assumed signifi- cant proportion in the cunicula of many colleges. In direct op- position to 'spoon feeding,' pro- grams have been developed en- abling advanced students to pur- sue their owh educational 'inter- ests.'' We commend T.he Skidmore News for Its pei1ceptive recogrii. tion ,of the value of individual study, and we hope that the~r ad- ministration acknowledges the student's. desires and needs for ad- 'Vanced study. . * * * Police seized two strip tease dancers, ,one name(l. \Bubbles in a raid on a wild stag party held in a dormitory room Wednesday night, accord'ing to the student newspaper at Princeton. The .stag party 'began in an un- identified eating clu\Q the Prince- toniil.il. said. Later, several under~ graduates took the dancers to their dormitory room, the news- paper said', But' a police raid interrupted the party. The wome!l and •sev- ers;! undel'gi'aduates were ta:ken to pol\ce headquarters eai'ly yester- day. The women were held, but the students released: pend'ing further investigation, according to the Princetonian. The Daily Princetonian did not identifY' the· eating club where the student party was, held. It said that the party was for new mem- bers. The eating clubs are scheduled for a round' ,df semester-e-nd pa;r- ties this weekend. The faculty committee Q which determines the number of awards to be bestowed has seen fit to distribute fifteen this year. Under college rules any senior studying_ a program leading to a B.S. or B.A. degree who has mam- tained an academic average of 4.0 or higher is eligible. In the past two years ten and fifteen men, res}}ectively, have received the honor; in each case only one eligible man was denied it. This represents a substantial departure from previous years where only a limited few of those consid- ered were elected. Thus, we are approaching a more realistic attitude in relation to other schools. Since the honor is a national one, the esteem in which it is held by the public is decided by the standards of a majority of colleges and universities. Unless Union continues its pres- ent policy it will be penalizing students who deserve the distinction. An impressive student art ex- hibit, sympathizing strongly with the current avant-garde proclivity toward the abstruse, is now un- derway in Old Chapel. .A deep perception and incisive self- search'ing are prerequisites to tc.r as well as creator of his own wot·k. \The artist is obliged to adapt the traditional and relate 'it in contemporary terms.\ It is with this end in view that Nowacl( in- structs · the two class sections which .have produced the com- ponents of the show. Most of th~ 17 students represented limit- ed experience and not one has .professional aspirations of'-a ca- reer 'in the fine arts. Though the emphasis in art instruction at Un- i<>n is on the current, the ;student must master the technical, poetic and aesthetic structures and dis· ciplines of art. \The initial move in instilling artistic sensitivity is to challenge the student into a state of awareness and :urge the highest intellP.ctual grasp within each personal range.\ Nowack r-easoned that this was facilitated by predom'inantly non-di.reetive methods. 1 AMES Restaurant • GOOD 'FOOD Now's The Time To The rationalization behind the more selective policy is that as the Alpha of New York Chapter we must be particularly discriminating in our selection. This should be eliminated as an important factor. A Phi Beta Kappa key is re~esentative of a certain degree of scholastic excel- lence whether the chapte1· be the oldest or youngest in the state. Students competing for the honor should not be deprived of consideration because Union is emerced intra- dition. Faculty members of the committee should there- fore be commended on the present realistic approach. We are confident that they will continue this policy in subse- quent years. Parent's Weekend The Concordiensis extends a heartfelt welcome to the parents and visitors who will be on campus today, tomor- row and Sunday to celebrate Parents Weekend. Since its inauguration in 1951, the weekend has be- come a annual institution looked forward to by students, faculty and administration alike. The Delphics are to be commended for perennially planning a fine program. We urge the campus visitors to make this weekend more than just a time to see their relatives. Parents week- end is an excellent opportunity to learn about those aspects of Union College which outsiders rarely view: its classes, its professors and its activities.

Professor Wayne Nowack, the ad- ministrative force behind the ex- hi·bit, indicated that often the most crucial t'ime in the creation of a work of art is the artist's reckoning with the idea. and its implications and digressions. Of- tnn the idea appears as a sub- .-.:onscious drive, a desire to dep'ict emotion as form in space. An abstract painting may represent moods or networks of objects to the artist himself. He is specta- Essence Drawing Tried An interesting experimental project wh'ich has produced e;x:- hihitable results is the orientally- flavored \essence drawing.\ The attempt here was to \reduce nat- ural objects to lines, to smp up quality in quick strokes. Express- ing music in pictorial significance is another di·gression which has proved successful, in that all the canvases in color at the exhibit have •been done by that method. The various dep'ictions of a stuffed owl to convey it as a taetile and structural object and discover its formal structure, are intended as positive ,preventitives of imi- tation. \What !Make$ a Bad Painting,\ a definitive war on cliches and fatal mistakes, was a project which helped the e:x:hi'bitors to understand the artist as being a required indlcat'ion of his envir- onment, rather than an isolated aesthetic. Letter to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: I should like to throw out two questions which have recently oc- curred t.o me. One is the wisdom of hQld'illg athletic events, suc:l:l. as track meets and lacrosse games, in the pouring rain. This policy was followed for track last Sat- urday-; May 3 and Wednesday, May 7, and for lacrosse last Sat- urday. I question whether we should subject our athletes to the poorest weather conditions imaginable. Is this to •build them up and make them men? I feel that there is a limit to what one should do for the old school. Certainly the cold and the rrun should have forced the postponement or cancellation of these events, as baseball and tennis contests scheduled for those days were postponed. I watched the events for a few hours and feel qu!'l<lifi~ to jl,Iqge. The second question is whether there is justification for seniors voting in the last election for Student CoWlcll President and Secretary-. Shouldn't the new of- ficers be fully responsible to those students who will be here in the fall, and not the graduating sen- iors? At present, legally, seniors have the right to vote, but wouldn't it be more realistic to change the law? Comment is in order on ~he question.

Wagon Trails While the Concordiensis appreciates the fine work accomplished by the Committee on Buildings and Grounds as evidenced especially by its efforts in controlling the Dutch Elm blight, we feel that there is another aspect of the condition of the campus which is being pitifu]]y neg- lected: the roads. Since more than one-half of the students at Union drive cars, and an even larger percentage of the faculty and staff use the College's drives, this is a matter of im- portance to a large number of people. The crevices in campus \highways\ are not only dangerous but unsightly. With graduation approaching Union can expect a larg-e number of visitors, among them alumni and parents of graduating seniors. Anyone who musters up the courage to drive from West College (where many alumni will be housed) to North College can expect to experience some- thing comparable to a \vagon trail trip in the old West. While we realize that Union will be the p1·oud owner of a new freshman dormitory on the present pasture, we feel that it is not too much to ask that the West to North College trail and othe1· roads and parking lots be resur- faced in the near future. Permanent roads need not be built; at least tempoary improvements, however are a necessity. Alumni Training Ground A new perspective on admissions procedures will be derived by the 35 alumni who will attend the \Alumni Training School in Admissions,\ September 12-14 (see page one). For a school such as Union, where budget limitations prohibit the employment of a full-time man in the field, the advantage of using enlig·htened alumni, aware of the intricacies in admissions work, is great. These alumni, it is hoped, will do a significant part in stimulating an increase in out-of-state applications to a school that is attended mainly by New Yorkers. The quest for a larger geographical distribution has been a problem that 1\Ir. Pearson and company have been facing since the publication of the l\Iiddle States Evaluation Report. To- gether with the excellent joib currently being done by Rowan Wakefield, Director of Public Relations, the new training ground for alumni will help to spread Union's good name.

At no time was the Admini'stxat!ion opposed. to the sale of beer i-tt the R!lthsl;eller. From the very first mcention of a Rathskeller, which would sell beer, at the Tip- pecanoe Conferen·ce in the spring of 1918, .the students had the sup- port .of the Administr.ation.

He first appeared here -as an under- graduate in 1943, and after his graduation in 1945 remained at Union as an 'instruc.tor until 1948, when he attended' Harvard Uni- vers'ity, where he· received both his M.A. and Ph.D degrees. Be- fore returning to Uni-on in 1953, he spent a year in England study- ing at t!'te London 8-<:hool of Econ- omics on a Fu-lbright Scholarshfp.

It was handled brilliantly ,.by the ·Orchestra. Every nuance was pre- sented perfectly. The trahsitions were sharp and ~iean, without losing the continuity necessary in such an imagist .piece. The slow portions were particularly effec- tive. In these, the acoustics (about whicll. I will have more to say later) played a less impor- tant part. In less skilled hands than Dr. Curtis' it could have become letha1·gic. As t!le four soloists t()ok their positions on the stag-e; as the two choirs seliJ.ted in t!te balcony rustled their scores, the audien()e was suffused with a: tl'emendous sense of expectancy. Tbis showed how Vliell Dr. •Curtis had laid the ground for the climax. There was no disappointment. Tne two choruses did their- respective schools proud, the sol()ists were first rate, and the orchestra seeme-d inspired.

The second ·Correction I wish to make concerns the ratio of •beer sales to f{lod sales; iMr. Pul· sifer states that \originally beer was the calling caret and a large ·percentage of the net sales were made from this.\ At .no time ·di'd beer sales ,exceed 20% of total sales in a given month. To the best of my knowledge this general ratio .oi 80% food sa:les and 20% beer sales has persisted to th·e present. The Rathskeller could easily have been maintained w'ith- ollt beer as a menu item.

The :.1etcalf plan calls for a small lih•·ary building of 300,000 square fed on four levels, allowing room for future expansion at the r<\ai· of the building. The library would be placed in the center of aeaclt•mic traffic, rather than in the geogra;;hic or architectural center of the campus. The ·ba::;is of the Metcalf plan is that a college with our pro- gram, granting the present li- :brary loan system and future plans for photographic transmis- sion and telet~·pewriter serv'ice, there is no utilitarian need for rhe library to be larger than 300,- 000 volumes. Librarian Webb stre~serl that the discarding of unused volumes, which he estim- ates now total over 50,000 would be another factor in keeping the HELMER WEBB total fixe<! at 300,000 volumes. ---- Will Save $10,000 A member of the Commission since 1956, Dr. Davidson succeed-s Frank H. Sparks, former Chair- man of the Board of Trustees of Wabash College, who has become President of the Go·uncii for Fin- ancial Aid to Educat'ion. Under Davidson th,e Commission is to study and recommend' ways of trimming the costs of higher edu- cation, To help carry out its g.rowing duties, the Commission is cons'idering the establishment of a New York office with a full- time staff. Pla.yed Major Roles A key factor in the choice of President Davidson for the Chair- manship of the Commission has ·been the major role he has played in the ol'ganization and develop- ment of the Empire State F!ounda- tion of Independent Liberal Arts Colleges, whic'h in the past five yeal;j;l> has raised a million dol- lars\ from New York business firms toward the support of its tw·enty-three member colleges. President Davidson was the ·Foun- dation's first chairman. Allen· Limberg, Seniot\ Electrical Engineer, copped the coveted first prize in the Blatchford Speaking Contest held Tuesday, May 20, in Memorial Chapel.

The most s'ignificant turn-overs were in the Divisions of Social Studies a.nd Science. Professor William W. Bennett, Chairman of the Division of Soc- ial Studies, announced that Mr. Goeffrey Seed will replace Pro- fessor Ft\eder'ick L. Bronn·el', who will be e:xchange professor at St. Andrew's University, ·as Professor of HistoJ:'y, Dr. Norman Mercer will be added to the faculty as Assoda:te Professor of Ec()nornics. Dr. Lawrence Abbott, Prof·essor of Economics, will return from par- tial leave, and a new Sociology professot\ unchosen at present, •· will be needed due to the resigna- tion of Pmfessor Roseborough. In the Divis'ion of Science, sev- eral additions have been made. Mr. Rich·ard Henry and M:r. Salbo D'Agostino will commence duties as Assistant Protessors of Physics in the fall. DI\. Arthur Danese, Assistant Professor of M:athema- t!ics, Mr. Charles J.

Webb told the Concordiensis that a $200,000 savings could 'be realized in capital expenditut·e by building the simpler and less or- namental structure that Metcalf proposes. According to President Carter Davidson, the l'ibrary fund now totals $100.000. In a long distance telephone interview, Dr. Davidson revealed that the tmstees have given the Metcalf plan an initial hearing, but the Board feels that the present plan would present an opportunity to redesign and beautify the center of campus. TrustN'S Not Surp Although an exact builder's esti- mate has not yet been made, the prPsent Trustee - backed plan would cost in the Vicinity of $600,- 000 to $900,000. The plan now under consid·era- tion, proposed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & Wb.ite calls for a three stage construc- tion program, the first goal of which would be the construction of t·hP library itself. Later, sem- inar rooms, faculty studies and auxiriary reading rooms would be added. Eventually, the plan would include a group of buildings in the center of campus costing ·over one million dollars. It should be noted, however, that these auxili- ary buildings are not necessary to the library itself, and could be added over a period of years. ---o--- Chappe} to Preach The Reverend Thomas Hunting- ton Chappell, Headmaster of the Hotchkiss School, will conduct the community vesper service in Me- morial Chapel at 7:30 P.

We do not deny that Union's fourteen week vacation is needed; on the contrary, it serves many valuable purposes, among them affording students and professors the oppol'tunity to supplement their incomes, to gain experience in the outside world, and possibly most im- . portant, to serve as a break from the academic life. -, Many points concerning Union should, however, be to Colonel Sheldon and Maj.or Ford, whose assignments in the Air Force t'a:ke :them off om· staff after three years .of outstanding service to the College. We have tremendously enjoyed the visit of the whole Burt family and hope they will carry back to St. Andrews the warm greetings of all of us at Union. JAMES Restaurant PROCTOR'S \COWBOY\ \THE GIFT OF LOVE\ seriously considered during the vacation by every member of the college family. These are matters intimately con- cerning the future of the college in every field-academic, social, and cultural. Most important is the planned library. At the present time there are two proposals: the plan set forth h~· l\IcKim, ~lead, and White, College architects, which would place the library, a grandiose structure, in the geographical cen- ter of the campus, and the plan suggested by Dr. Keyes Metcalf of Harvard and advocated by l'nion librarian Hel- mer Webb calling for a more modest building to be con- structed between the Civil Engineering and Biology Build- ings· The Concordiensis does not tahe a stand on the merits of either of the two proposals. We feel. however, that a new library must be built in the very near future. We hope that advocates of both suggestions will not neglect the proverbial woods for the t1·ees. A disag1·eement of policy must not be allowed to delay the construction of the new library. * * * Two points concerning fraternity life must also be conside1·ed. First are social rule changes suggested by the Concordiensis and discussed by the Student Council. Social regulations at l'nion need revision; our ~ystem is archaic. We hope that the Council will take the subject from the table at the first meeting of the next academic year and air it thoroughly. The present social situation is farcical. The campaign for our new Library building has this year produced over $160;000 in gifts and pledges, and I am hoping that by Commencement time there will be enough added to this so that we will be within sight of our goal. The deadline for securing the amount to match the $50,000 pledge from the Kresge Foundation has been extended to November 30, 1958, but I am hoping that the campaJgn will be successfully concluded long before that date and that the building· will be in process of erection by Thanks- giving. Other gifts, particularly in the realm of scholar- ship endowments, have come to the College during the year to strengthen our program of student aid. The small number of members livjng in sevetal of the fraternity houses, with the accompanying financial diffi- culties, plus the necessity of expending considera:ble sums to meet the requirements for the multiple housing law, have combined to make the financial future of several of our chapters precarious. The college wishes to assert effi- cially again, however, that we intend to do all that we can to strengthen the fraternities in the Union College picture. In its proper place the fratemity house and the fraternity fellowship can become two of the most important factors in the development of an effective personality and char- acter of the great majority of our students. The College Trustees and Administration are working hard to figure out a plan which will enable us to help the fraternities during the years ahead. · The second point deals with rushing. Next ~·ear the rushing period will be extended to three weeks. September 20, 1958 is not the time for fraternity men to start mahing The sixteen \Extendibles\ in the freshman class, who plans for initiation of the new system; ideas must be were given Dean's List privileges immediately upon admis-- formulated over the Summer.
