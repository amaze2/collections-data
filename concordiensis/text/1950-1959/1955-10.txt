ThP arti-st .has pro· vidNl nl'ither tHk not· othe>r \clue>\ for the viewc•r to seize upon·; a 11 there is to sc•c is his work . Perhaps we arc not reaJy for this show.

The pa-inting is a thing; it, quite simply, exists. It looks o·b>·ious in newspt•int; the canYas surt•ly exists, paint is as n•al as 7 A.l.\1 hut -to· most tlH qu,>stion t·emains- what is it? The answet· plainly is, it is a painting. It is a composition that ts unique; it is its uwn ~xplana­ tiun. The art of ·Charles Annan is· difft>rent from any >ve have seen in the campus e~hibition 8t>rics. \Ve like it best.

Wc- do see som!'tlring- of the m·tist. Annan is not thP young- artist who hy Yarious perversions has been buf- fpt tt'd and distorted until he hELs r<>vc•t·ted to the primordial state whe1·e. out of touch with the world, hP rr adly p.iints \nonrcpr~sentaUve art.\ This silly .but popula-r con- ception is destroyed by the current show. But neither is he some ma- jestic being whose work may he l'Nl.Ched by on!~· a chosen few who !mow \all about\ rr.odet·n art. It is fot· every person sensually and in- tellPctually alive and nlPrL One need not be an artist to. see -it, the artist here is Char I e•s Annan- enough. Annan is a challenging· painter. His work is emotionally and intel- 1PrtuaHy exhilarating. n is grow- ing. it is c>ver inct•easing 'in. scope, it is rver -evolving toward maturity. Aft-er looking at somr .of thr ear- 1iPr d rnwings hung, no· douht. with somP t'eluctance on thP part .of the art i st. ther0 is an in..explieable· nwtaphysical-fG~l' what else could wr:> call it ?--delight in sel'ing the later work in the show. These latet· painting~ \\'f'I'E' not constru-ct- ed 'fzom noll's or models; thry are tlw deYP'Iopment of ycfm.s ... perce.p- tinns and convictions. NC>t that we ncean to imply that these paint- ings are some sort of ·philosophical disrour::;e fraught with controver- sial doctrine. How foolish. But the fact remains that an intelligent man li-ves by th.is expression ami he proceeds toward fulfHlment of it. ·One cannot help but notice the difference between Annan and Pau-I Burlin. Burlin js an old man, he is a consummrute artist. :His wor·k, therefore. is much ·more accessible, It is -complete. Despite Us infinite compleJtity, .our ability to see the entire universr of Bm·Hn's art l<>ts us more freely enjoy it. We can sense the unity l'Yerywhcre evidl'nt in his work It is intPg-ra ted; al- most everyone who saw the war!{ of Paul Burlin felt the pmverful coherence it displayed. yet the images were no more representa- tive or recognizable than those of Ann on. Thet'e is a unity -jn the work of Annan, but there is no real ful- fillment. The work can and •must be interpreted, ~but not closely and com.plete>ly li'ke the work of Burlin . Lihe the work of Burlin and every artist, it cannot and mtlst not 'be explain~cl. ·What does it mean? Come stand and look at it again with us; let us seP.

From the Editors' Notebook To Catch a Thief A call is hereby issued to all able bodied Union men to guard the campus tonight against further assaults of students from a nearby engineering school which we shall identify only by the initials RPI. It is hoped that this action will prevent a repetition of the chagrin suffered by underclass- men last week when the Idol was discovered to be not red nor green, but a Rochester yellow, and the disaster of last evening, which we need not elaborate upon. The following defensive equipment is suggested: 8D.';;a'k- ers, (these a1·e necessary in order to be able to catch the culprits because it is reported that they are highly proficient in the art of \pogoing\ along with their slide rules at high velocities); clippers, (since the price of haircuts has risen in Schenectady, it is only fitting· and proper that we provide free ones for our guests of the even.ing); lighter fluid, (this is an extremely useful item for lig-hting cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and for burning cherry paint off the Idol) ; and merth- iolate, (sophomol'es especially should take note of this item as it has been rumored that the Class o'f '58 has been stock- piling gallon jugs of this stain and storing them in the pipes of the organ in 1\femorial Chapel), However, even with the prescribed equipment, Union men should be cautious. RPI engineers are dangerous when armed with a slide rule, and have even been known, when cornered, to divide by zero. Silence Is Golden The College Committee on Leetures and Concerts has taken an excellent step in the direction of eiiminating the weeds of discontent that have been sown during the past few years as a result of the mediocre chapel programs. The film personalities series which is being presented this year should provide an interesting and enjoyable insight into the early days of the industry and the pre-depression and de- pression eras. Just as a good boolr is ageless, so are many of these classics. Chaplin's humor remains as funny and as universal today as it was almo&t 40 years ag<». The performances given b:y- the likes of Douglas Fairbanks, Marlene Dietrich, W. C. Fields and Greta Garbo can be appreciated at any time. Many will be viewing their first silent films, which is an ex:pe1·ience in itself. If these people can imagine a piano providing background music from behind the screen, ·they will be able to relieve the period of time in which many of their parents g1·ew up. Pioneer In Broadcasting Congratulations are in order :for WRUC, which is cele- brating the start of its 35th year on the air. Although a comparative youngster in comparison to other campus activities, it nonetheless boasts one of the most auspicious starts, having broadcast the first regUlarly scheduled radio program in Arnerka. WRUC's identification as \Pioneer in Broadcasting\ has continued to hold meaning through the years. The staff has constantly experimented with new equipment to facilitate reception, and has endeavored to pr()vide Union students with the kind of programs they enjoy. Tl1e Concordiensis extends to its Wash bum Hall neighbor best wishes for continued top quality broadcasting. Cheer On Her Team ''I didn't think they would object jpst for the celebration!\ Tulips and Chimneys By Edward Cloos, Jr. The October issue of The At- lantic Monthly carries a \paper of dissention\ by How:ard Mumford Jones ·Called \Undergr&duates op. Apron Strings.\ The \i\>ell-pre- served Harva;rd English professor decries modern controlled college programs declaring, in effect, that however well balanaed a list of college credits inay be, it still is no measure of a student's individ- ual development. Jones spends a good deal of time animadverting upon the overblown system of Western Man culture. courses. We read the ·ar-ticle with a cer- tain smug satisfaction, for dear Union is happily ·free of most of the cited sins. We do not, except to a limHed degree on the fresh- man level, devote much attention to Western Man-w·e specialize in the cream of the crop, the really important thing: AmeJ.iean Civili- zation. Jones denounces general educa- tion programs as tending to stifle Individual thought and imagina~ tion. We are proud to say that our Union does not resort to any such blatant means of smothering indlvldpallsm, Despite our totally free elective system, a veritable iiC!holastie anarchy, we have man- aged to maintain a subtle policy of sciollstic conformity-and we've done it all by ourselves. .Anyone w·ho reads the article will doubtless see other things which point out Union's virtues. Under tl}e old principle of the impossibility of pleasing all of the people ali of .the time, zr.ost col- leges are aiming at the median of their students ·(though this il well above the national average, thank you) and, says Jones,· boring the exceptional o·r at least unusual student. Up in. Bailey Hall we .have a theory; it is perfectly pos- sible, we. feel, to pli)B.l:!e. (and please equals interest) some of the people none of the time and none of the people all of the time. In other words, bore 'em all. Theoretically this system should -incite to indi~ vidual action even the most med- iocre fraternity boy. It does too; each student, independently, sleeps -intellectually and often physi- cally. This is very fine, though some out-siders have suggested that when everyone :does the sazr.1e thing~even if it is individually- it can be called ~onfOI·mity. That is a very .picayune point which. is best ignored. Mr. Jones, Professor Jones, as much as says that a superior chemist has a right to be an in- ferior citizen-at least a little \in- fe~;ior. One can safely say that Ul!iOn harbors hundreds ,of eligible candidates for \superior chemist.\ And each year several hundred rr.ore are carefully selected and come, carpet-bag in hand·, to pre- pare for the position. The point of a modern college education, says the gentle·rr an to \\hom Vl'e've been referring, has become adjustment; first to the college, then the faculty, then, fin- ally, the outside world. This is where Union shines. We specialize i1;1 the unadjusted student. True, w·e integrate them all, but it is only to the previous three years, never, thank heaven, to the fu- ture. We must confess to one bit of adjustment though-after graduation, checks are not .brought to the gymnasium but are mailed to 1 Union Avenue. To quote the poet Keats who was not speaking precisely of money, but we at Union wi.ll draw our own, independent and individual, pa.J:allels, if you please-and who's to sa.y what Truth Is, \~that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\ Mister Jones, we stand innocent.

Hypocrisy of the Rules With a special HPC committee due to meet this Monday evening with the Pledgl1! Presidents Council to review the effects of this past rushing period, the news 'of dirty mshing confessions by eight fraternities at Williams assumes particula.r significance. Earlier this semester, in these same columns, we complained of the lax enforcement of rushing rules on the Union campus. There can be no questioning the fact that a healthy percentage of our fra- ternities, if not all, were guilty of violations comparable to those committed at Williams. It is interesting to note that in no eventuality doe~ a I'Ushing penalty at Union assume the financial proportions of those assessed. at vVilliamstown. Our fines and/or pun- ishments are far too trifling for a system that is as fre- quently abused as is our rushing period. But yet, what matter the amount of the levy, if there is no machinery for its enforcement? We are not- completely aware of the motivations behind the confessions made at the Williams Sncial Council meeting, but we are quite sure that similar an3wers, however warranted, would not be forthcoming, if the question and penalty were posed at an HPC meeting. · Whether this is to imply that Williams man can be put on their honor, and that Union men are \practical has no place in our thesis. What does matter is that dirty rushing practices, both Orientation Week and the rushing period, were ignored by an HPC that has as one of its dele- gated functions, the policing of such things. In 1954, an HPC decision favoring early rushing was superseded by the Student Council, and a campus-wide referendum was held on the subject. We suggest that jf the HPC does not choose to do more than set hypothetical rules destined never to be applied, a matter for Student Council action exists. Why Not Little Ivy? Two years ago this month, Herbert L. Spira, then Editor-in-Chief of the Concordiensis, instituted an extensive promotional campaign designed to sell the id.ea. of a Little Ivy League to a group of New England and New York State schools felt to be of similar academic and traditional leanings. Largely through the personal efforts of Spira, the league got off to an adequate start in 1953 with the presentation of an ivy plant donated by Professor Winne being made at the conclusion of the football season to Amherst, adjudged the winner of the first competition. Unfortunately, Spira's successor lacked either the interest, or, more likely, the time necessary to devote to the continuation of the embryo league. Accordingly, the dual award made to HO'baTt and Trinity last fall passed almost unnoticed among the schools -\ i~r~A:v. oeT-OBt;R: n. 1955 Tulips and Chimneys Letters to the Editor ~~-~~~~~~~~--~~- By Ellw!U'd Ooos, J\r.

Monrovia was sti!J seething vl\ith excitement when I arrived July 1. A dramatic facet VIas the presenQe of a former friend of mine in the public square. He was a lawyer and erstlh hile Secretary of the In- terior for Liberia, S. David Cole- man. He had been murdered and so horribly hack-l'd ·and pulled and dragged that his body VI as nut recognizably human. Alongside lay his eldest son also murdered and extensively cut. His Excel- lency, William Vaconarat Shad- rach Tub-rran. President of Liberia, had originaHy intended to let the bodies rot away in public as a lesson to would-be traitors. Then it occurred to him that Coleman and Son rr ight become a health menace after death, thus continu- ing the evil which began '\\.ith their threat to the political health of Liberia. Mr. S. David Coleman all this tirue \ as peacefully resting at his farm sorre th~rty miles north of Jl![onrovia toward the Sierra Leon• frontier. Quite naturally, I a.slred why this body Jay rotting instea.d of PaUl Dunbar's. To this L got only shrugged shoulders and gen- eral ccnnments that the source of evil is more to be feared· than the puny finger which pulls the trig- ger. When I pushed the matter fUJ:ther, I learned that not only was Mr. Dunbar in no fear for his life but was actually do·ing pretty well. He had an unlimited supply of cigws of the Executive brand and whisky of the EJ~ecutive brand. This latter is extremely important, since whisky, '1\•hile not th~ blood of life in Liberia, is· ce!=:\ tain 1y ·second -in the list of na- tional fluids. Mor<?over, President Tubman's car stood ready to take Mr. Dunbar anywhere he liked. This was stipulated as a daytime convenience, however, anq Mr-. Dunhar w.a.s required to spend the nights in jail. When asked about his imprisonment, Mr. Dunbar re~ pi>rtedly said that he didn't mind how long it lasted. Most Liberians, huddled over their few grains of moldy rice in a leaky hut, could qudte understand his attitude.

Local Advertising Manager Prom Queen, Military Style Traditionally, Union Prom Queens have been crowned with a minimum of haggling and a maximum of fair play. They have been chosen by impartial judges from among all girls present, and no dispute has ever arisen over the award- ing of this honor. The prom committee of the ROTC has seen fit, however, to &.-ag the coronation from the high pedestal on which it has stood to the depths of fraternity wrangling and half thought out promotional schemes. In an apparent attempt to increase attendance, the seven houses with the lowest percentage of prom-goers will be eliminated from competition. This means that the less fmternity brothers a person has going to the prom, the less are his chances of having; his girl even entered in the com- petition. Paradoxically, if more of his brothers attend the prom, his girl still has less chance of being crowned because the odds against her being; chosen to represent the fraternity increase. Members of large houses are at an obvious disadvantage in that they are allow~d the same representation as smaller f1·aternities. The independents, however, suffer more from this ridiculous scheme than does any one house. Once again they have been mistakenly grouped together as an 18th fraternity. How can this group of approximately 300 students possi- bly get together and agree on one couple to represent them at the prom? Even if they could hold such a meeting, why slwuld they? .Just because they are all non-fraternity men, they need not necessarily have any ties with each other. This eliminates 30 percent of the student body from any chance of being erowned King-. Besides changing the competition from an individual to a fraternity basis, the prom committee has dumped another problem in the laps of fraternities which attempt to abide by the new rules. How can any house make a fair choice, or, for that matter, .any choice, as to its representative couple, when many girls w.ill be seeing the Union campus for the first time on prom weekend? Intra-fraternity disputes and pressure politics over the selection of a single couple will leave the weekend with a bitter taste for many. Degrading the coronation to a ticket selling stunt will not increase attendance. If there are couples that attend the prom just because there is a possibility of their being chosen as monarchs, which is a doubtful premise to start with, these couples will certainly have more incentive to go if they stand a chance to win on an individual basis, rather than if they have alt~eady been eliminated in fraternity competition. In changing the method of selecting the Prom Queen, the ROTC has made a decidedly negative accomplishment. A system which was uncomplicated and fair to all has been replaced by one which is the very opposite. E.S.L. Nine Seek Local Office Election Symposium SAMUEL STRA'tTON DANTE M.

Yes, Sam Stratton has a tele- vision show five days a week, a family of four and a mind and heart interested in the people of Schenectady. Although.. he is young-, his political experience goes back to 1940 and has been inter- rupted only by service in the Navy. One of his main .aims as the new Mayor of Schenectady would be to begin a real program to attract new and much needed indu.stry to the Schenectady area. I:Ie also would work against the drift of people out of the city to the suburbs by making the city grow to include them. In short, Mr. Sam Stratton has all the qualifications for the type of Mayor the city of .Schenectady needs-political knowledge, youth, ideas, understanding and a keen awareness of the interests of the people of Schenectady. ARTHUR R. BOEHM Republican Councilman for CoiUlcilman By Ronald DeAngelus The ~ell known Republican in- cumbent, Arthur R. Boehn ,, a na- tive Schenectadian, has been on the Nott Terrace athletic faculty for many years and on the City Council since 1952. Mr. Boehm's popularity stems r:rirr arily from his former position as basketball coach at Nott Terrace High School. Due to- his remarkable ability in producing talented teams, Boehm's name has been carried on the lips of every sports-minded citizen in Schenectady, and he is affection- atl'ly knov. n to all as \Whitey.\ Dan Scaccia, a native ·of Ro,me, Italy, has lived In the Schenectady area for the last 26 yeare. After graduating from Draper High School, he entered' Union Coliege to pursue his teen-age ambition of becoming a lawyer. His· goal had to :be set a.Side temporarily while he served three year~ in. the Navy during the Second World War. After returning to ci-vHian life, he proceeded to graduate from Union College and the Columbia Law School. Fulfilling his ambition, he re- turned to 'Schenectady and set up a law office. Recalled to active duty in the Navy as a Lieutenant Commander, he once again served· his country in the Korean conflict. In 1952 he resumed his I~w prac- tice and 'began to take an active intere.St in city aff.airs. He has par- ticipated in such organizations as Sons of Italy, Cham·ber of Com- merce, Freedom Forum, the Civic Music Association, and several legal groups. As a member of the Democratic team, 'nan Scaccia Is actively supporting their platform which includes the following points: 1. End one-par.ty 'boss rule 2. Take poli-tics out of law en- forcement 3. Get a fair deal for the tax- payer 4. Plan for Schenectady's future As a lawyer, Dan Scac<lia has become particularly interested In the entanglement .of politics with law enforcement in this city. Evi- dence of this is his interest in the D'Attilo gambling, case which looms as a rr.ajor campaign issue this fall, and his fight for better police organization and pay ·bene- fits·. Although Dante M. Scaccia is untried in the political arena, his past record indicates that he has the qualifications to be a good Councilman and bring credit to himself as well as t-he city of Schenectady. KENNETH S. SHELDON Republican Candidate for Councilman By Lei>nard D. Pannone Kenneth S. Sheldon, originally f~om Oakdale, Massachusetts, was f1rst attracted to Schenectady In 1916 as an entering student of Union College. While at Union, he was an active Student Council member and a member of the v-arsity cross-country team. His ot-her a<'tivitiPs centerN'l around his fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa, and the Student Army Training Corps (SA TCl ·which eventually led ·him to Officer's Training School at Camp Taylor, Virginia. Skidmore was obviously a \stamping ground\ for Union Col- lege men even in 1~20, for Mr. Sheldon met and married a Skid- more graduate and permanently settled in the city of Schenectady. Shortly after graduation, he ac- FRIDAY,. OCTOBER 2$, 195!$ ··.FRIOA¥, Letters to the Editor GarJ As~ Ext~ October 26, 1955 'ro the ~ditor of the Concordiensis: In tile past three Weeks, .the F.t~use P!.'e:>i!itmts Council has been repeatedly reb-uked for not ta!r.ing action against fraternity hoU:ses who have supposedly car- ried on dirty rushing practi-ces. While ~t is the prLv:ilege oi any member of Union. College. to n:allike such accusations, the HPC felil.i;i it only fair and necessary to pre- sent Its views on the subject. The f!ri!t point that we WO\Ild liltJe to bring to light is. that the HPC realizes and aqcepts the· fact that a minimum of dirty rushing doe~> e:j!:ist. We are not, ):lowevcr; saying that since no fraternity has ciffici.a:ily pressed charges, v. e v.HI forget the entire matter. On the coQtracy, the HPC is very con- cerned and plans, although slowly and deliberately, to tty to alleviate the .problem. ·For 'those who are men of acti{)n, there will be no \mass confe::;sions\ such as oc- curred !!,t W!Hi~s Qollege l!!St week. Thi·s Is ~doubtedly very disappointing to some students. Here at Union, no charges h.ave been official]y pressed, and the HPC cannot take police actit;>n against generalizations. Perhaps tb.e rr.o.st impmtant point brought to our attention \\\a;s the dirty rushing that took place· during the orientation program. i think it is s!!,:f;e to say that the majority of the dirty rushing com- plaints referred specifically to this. parti<:ular week As you are aU aware, the orientation progra;rn •v. as reorganized and for the .first, time carried O\lt here on campus.: The l\ushing rul>;Js which go int~ effect Sunday noon prior to the! first day of school did not take the or.ienta.tion program into con- sideration, simply because it never had to be ~one before·. However,! it seems this will have to be changed since thera is a g<>od deal of opportunity to rr.eet or; to take freshmen out Vlhile here 0 n. campus during orientation week. The E!PC copld not ·P9SSibly _be; aware of any viQlations, let alone police them, since the majc;>rlty of the student bodY vv.as not back at school. If this -situation can be handled effectively, we believe it v. ill be a. big ·step toward aboi- ishing dirty rushing. It has been. our purpose to present briefly to the student body the policy of the HPC toward · dirty rushing. As I have men- tioned and repeat once again, there undoubtedly ·~A as a rr inimum of dirty rushing taking place. It is · a very difficult practice to sup- prMs completely. The HPC \~th the h:lJil of the ~reshman Pledge Council Is working on ways in which ruship.g can be improved. We would lik•e to take the oppor- tunity here to welcome any sug- gestions from any member of the student body. However, we will· malte no definite changes in, the rushing rUles this semester. In- stead, we will make r.ecomnienda- tlons in .the form of a paper and submit this to the :HPC next sem- ester.

PFEIL RepubUcan ()andidate for Mayor By John Davidson Mr. Henry G. Pfeil (pronoW\ced File) the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Schenectady County, is the Republican candi- date for Mayor of Schenectady. Mr. Pfeil is a long time resident of Schenectady and ·is the manager of Henry's Cycle Shop on Al'bany Street. He has an extensive record of community service. Among other things, he has 'been the area chairman of the Red Cross and has 'been active in s·everal youth organizations including the Boy Scouts and the Schenectady Boys' Club. Mr. Pf~il's political experience has been mainly with the Sche· nectady County Board of Supervi-s- ors as Supervisor · from the 12th Ward and as Chairman <>f the . Board. This lattet' post has given Mr. Pfeil experience as a legisla- tive leader which :he feels is an excellent qualificati<>n for a -can- didate for Mayor. The Mayor's most important govermental func- tion is to .preside a.t the meetings dania of public service to the tax- payer. \2. Continue the sound financial structure of the c·ity with a balanced and hpnest budget. \3. Assure a greater 'Schenectady tom<>rro_w through sound planning today.'' The main trouble with the plat- form is that it speaks in broad generalities and says' nothing spe- c-ific. I believe that a platform should contain more definite prom~ ises instead of speaking in such broad, though pleasant generalities. As a man, I feel that Mr. Pfeil is well qualified as Mayor of Sche- nectady and could do ·a competent job. He seems to· be a person who can express himself articuiately and forcefully, at least in private coli.versatio!J.. His political philso- phy as given to me is \If the voters elect me, they expect me to efficiently and quietly represent them to the best of my ability and to do a good jo'b.\ If Mr. Pfeil is elected, and if he is allowed a reasona-bly free hand at running the government, he wlll probably conduct it th·at way-a good soUnd government, qUietly and efficiently run with a. minimum of fanfare~ Councilrr:an :Boehm is actually much too nice an individual to offend anyone in or out of politics, or press certain is:;mes which IT.Ii!.Y prove embarrassing. This feature, however, ·seems to wcrk. in both. ways for even his \political en- emies\ 1'a.il to criticize any of his political sh(}rtcomings. .As the facts stand now, Mr. Boehm Is the Republican Party's front-running candidate-an. ami- able individual with natural vote getting appeal. How·ever, with all due respect to his diplomatic abil- ity, a man with stronger political convictions would prove to be far more beneficial to the people of Schenectady and the welfare of our community.

CREATIVE ENGINEERIN AT ·WESTERN ELECTRIC Use of the transistor in Bell telephones Shown here are the parts of the small amplifying unit' in Western Electric's new Volume Control Telephone. Because of the use of a transistor (shown above, extreme left on index finger) this amplifying unit is no larger than an ice cube and can fit inside the housing of a standard telephone. Manufacturing of transistors on a commercial basis represents a solid engineering achievement •. , for it means volume production of an item that must be made under rigidly controlled laboratory conditions. For example, harmful impurity atoms in the germanium must be reduced to less than 1 for every 10,000,000,000 germanium atoms and then helpful impurity atoms added until there is approximately 1 for every 50,000,000 germanium atoms. Western Electric has been making transistors since 1951 when our engineers set up the fiist cammercial production line. This history-making achievement is representative of the way we work as the manufacturing unit of the Bell System ••. translating Bell System designs and inventions into the many things - from tiny semi-conductors to huge switching systems - used in the nationwide Bell telephone network. It's a job that presents an unending cha1lenge to, our engineering staff.
