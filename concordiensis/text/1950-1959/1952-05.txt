Ketz Depressed, Dolan Colbtpses Those students who happened to wander past Alexander Field late one afternoon this week, witnessed some amazing sights as Uncle Bill Ketz .put his <Jinder grinders through one of. their lighter work· outs; just prior to a meet. Dick Dolan appeared on the horizon w:ith a knapsack on his shoulders after com.pleting his O'Wil personal W{)rkout. Dick had set, out a couple of days earlier, in an attempt to raise Ketz•s spirits. The medicine worked as Bill flashed a smile from ear to ear when Dolan stumbled past the gym. Unfortunately Dolan's condition re· mains critical and it is doubtful if things will look rosy for the Union ' mentor again this season. Dick's stablemate, Gari Clough,. did not get o:llf so lightly.

Planned Procrastination Two weeks ago this publication announced that it favored a reconsideration of the closely contested defened rushing proposal. We weee motivated by a desir~ t? see the term deferral backed by a more than scanty maJonty of the campus, if it has even that backing now. For more than a term, the Interfraternity Council has been haggling over rushing. An early vote defeated th_e term postponement. Pressuring by the Student Council brought about another vote, which gave a _very weak ~p­ proval of the term delay. Was this the solut_10n? W,e thmk not. A one vote margin, and that vote a t1e-breakmg one, is hardly a decisive measure. The campus administration is greatly in favor of the six- teen weeks plan. They rejoiced in its acceptance. But, th.ey can't find any solace in the way it was vo~ed in. In a str1~t sense the Student Council recommendatiOn to the IFC IS legal, but the step which was take? is. to our mind, ~nfair and in poor taste for a matter wh1ch lS momentous m the way it effects the rushing plan. Many have condemned thi.s paper for stirring UI? a temp- est which they felt was headed for peaceful seremty. ~et us consider the problem from another angle. Had the tie- breaking vote been cast in the negative, the SC would have clamored for a revote, if one is to believe that body's presi- dent, David Walrath. Does the term deferment plan have the backing of a workable majority? It does not. Deferred rushing in any manner would have a hard time mustering enough votes for overwhelming approval. There has been a bitter fight over rushing and now there is an equally bitter fight to approve the rushing rules. If we may use a pun, deferred rushing is nothing to be rushed into. It has to be weighed, its definite advantages pointed out, and it must be presented at a time when the houses are in a stable enough financial status to accept it. Before we were called a terrible procrastinator, we felt it necessary to point out these factors. Before \The die is cast,\ let's sit back and Teconsider. As shocking as it may sound, what we are saying is: no clear majority, no deferred rushing. If only fools rush in, then let's not be fools. De- ferred rushing an actuality? Not necessarily. Let's post- pone deferred rushing for one year. A wait such as this would mean a stronger deferral plan, certainly more backing from the student body, and then nobody can yell, \we wuz robbed.\ · -J. J. c. Inexpedient Thriftiness For one term, Union College has been officially without a Public Relations director. In essence, the Public Rela- tions office has been without a director for almost a year. Doctor John M. Bradbury was appointed to that post last fall, but was so shackled by the amount of time he devoted to classroom instruction, that he was unable to handle the post. One of Concordiensis' columnists, Jay Cohn, has blasted what he calls a de-emphasis of public relations. This pub- lication completely agrees with his judgment. Union, little ·known, apparently wants to remain that way, for this week a new director was hired, and he would have to be a magician to find the time necessary for an adequate public relations job. Union's forthcoming Public Relations director will be a triple-threat man; he will also edit the \Alumnus\ and teach history. The only threat is to his health. What we want to know is: Why is Union so thrifty in a department which can mean so much to the college's future? Customarily it is the Public Relations head who must \sell\ the college. Apparently Union has found a new method: hide the college. This, we are certain, is not the purpose, but it may be the result. Let's face the facts. Public Relations is a good invest- ment. It is an efficient ahd easy way to promote Union in the eyes .of the public. Enough of this penuriousness; let's have a full time Public Relations director. -J. J. c. has ga.ined ing this time. purpose of a eral :arts co such as Unio:n be- ing r.e>t merely education in spe- cific C()urses, but also tll.e tion ·o:f a osophy of this assesom11~n1 should the genera1ized pattern of' ideas the coll'ege has provided. In so far as one ca.n make explicit his basic standar-ds and values, his phil- osophy of !Jife~and this is almost irr.possi bie - the most important concE:>pt that I have found at Union is ihe idea of \permissivism.\ This concE:>pt has b~en abstracted from a variety of course~. perhaps most of all from ,psychology. It is an obvious concept, almost naive in its simpUcity. Yet, in its implications, it contains the seeds of a phil- osophy of life and perhaps even a solution to many cur-rent world dilemlll.as. Per~nissivism is merely the knowledge that each human being is a unique individual; that all human beings are different - in tempet··ament, ideas, attitudes, and values. It is the understanding that all individuals must perceive and behave in different manners; it is the acceptance of tlwse dif- ferences, and the individuals in whom th.ey occur, without imput- ing superiority or inferiority to any. tt ls the understanding that each b.uman being behaves as he must behave-that is, in the man- ner best suited to his personality- and tllat the individual is the only capable judge of his own actions;· that, so long as his actions are not harmful to others, each individual should be permitted to develop along the lines best suited to him- self. Permissivism is relativity in values. It is vastly different from absolutism which assumes fixed standards and values for all in- dividuals. It is different also from authoritarianism which assumes that a person's standards and values can be chosen for him by someone else, that the individual is not fit to choose for himself. Permissivism is also different from tolerance, for, as Howard Fast wrote, \Tolerance is not the opposite of Intolerance, but the coUIJ.terfeit of it. Both are des- potisms. The one assumes to itself the right of denying Liberty of Conscience, the other of granting it.\ Tolerance ts never extended between equals; it is a patroniza- Tb.is view, substituting under- standing for self righteousness, pro- vi<\es an excellent basis for rela- tionships between Individuals'-re- latlonships built upon mutual ac- ceptance. It can be successfully ex- trap<Jlated to other spheres and can provide a sound basis for for- eign relations and internal politics. It lEads us to consider the Rus- sians in a new light-not as mali- ciou~ evil doers, but as individuals different from us, perceiving and actir1g in manners different from us. They are, perhaps, just as con- vinced in the justice of their claims and policies as we are in ours. Their acts and beliefs are, ·On an absolute scale, neither good nor bad ; they are perhaps good for the Russians and bad for us. 'Thus we can divest ourselves of our self- righteo:usness and indignation - whi<:h make any peaceful worlting relationship impossible - and sub- stitute for it understanding, which might make compromise and solu- tion. possible. (This, of course, pro- vided the Russians do like-wise and attempt to understand and accept us.) In internal politics permissivism is the expression c;>f the .American detYJocracy, of the ideas and con- cepts embodied in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independ- encE. Herein .are expressed the ideas that all men are created equal, that all-even the deviant- are entitled to the same rights, that all can express their views. The opposition voice, no matter how rad.lcal, is permitted so long as it does not impose itself_ By the satYJe token the majority may not impose Its opinion on the minority. And the opposition voice in a de- mocracy has a great utility because it throws into question the basic values of the society. (Since so- ciety is a dynamic rather than a static organization, it is therefore healthy for a society to question its values - so that change, when nel!essary, 'can occur.) The fear for our democratic system then, should not stem from the minority and its voice, but from the sup- pression of that voice, from the imposition of conformity. This pe_rmissivism, then, is not a rigid dogma or standard to apply to all cases. In itself it contains the idea of flexibility, of differ- ential applicability - the idea that no principle is absolute, that none can cover all instances. Permis- sivism can, however, provide us with a relative, but functionally useful philosophy of life. Right now rm studying law at the Uniyersity ·Of Munich in Ba- varia. Talking about college life here, 1 simply have to use expres- ·sions taken from your own 'lan- guage. Actually that causes much misunderstanding. You would' have to come over to Germany to avoid that; i.e. there are many fvaterrti- ties, Catholic one~ mostly, which are so outdated in their manners and or-ganization that I'm outright disgusted, while I was delighted to stay with the Psi U's at trnlon.

There isn't even a concept like that. The stu- dents .(10,000: Munich is. the big- gest German university) live· all over the city and rush around, since some of the class rooms are miles apart. It ta:kes me :35 min- utes, if· I;m lucky, to get to Law School by street car. No wonder the student~! are studying on the bus! This semester I pay my tui- tion and stay home \with Ma:rna and the books.\ In ma,ny cases it isn't profitable anyway to attend classes. There are 1215 courses given. Still some are atteJ;ided by as many as 500 students. This is especially true with lectures given by famous scientists or thinl,ers. To have such people or not to have them is the only -.criterion ··wl:lich differentiates German universities in the minds of the students. On the whole you are just as well off if you graduate from Freiburg, Gieben, Kiel, Bonn or Heidelberg. GOOD SHOES FOR.

Art. Lawrence's nine will also be .trying to regain their winning ways after s.uffering a 6-1 drubbing by Rochester, this past Wednesday. Hogan to Fitch ®----------~---- Art Lawrence is going to lose the co-captains of his baseball team, also. Unless some capable freshmen turn up in next-year's class, Dick Munro is going to be a . hard man to replace at secpr.d base .. Franz Gleich will also be sorry to see Dick leave because of his steady performances with the soc- cer team and .he is the only man to captain two varsity squads this year. Bill Harris has been having a good season in left field for the baseball team and his batting ability has currently put him in the number four spot in the lineup.

En- tries will be taken on the field be- fore each event. A man may com- pete in two running events and one field event, or two field events and one running event. At least six: men from a fraternity or other organization must compete to gain entrance points for the team. Also, no spikes: will be allowed in the meet. Jim Hogan will be the starting' pitcher in the coming encounter which will be the thirtieth meeting of the Middlebury and Union· teams, since the first game was played in 1890. The Dutchmen have won 18 of the games played to date, although last year's sched- uled game was cancelled because· of rain. Weather conditions on Alexander Field, last Wednesday were hardly conducive to good baseball playing and the Garnet team was not suf- · ficiently primed to shake off the Rochester-Black spell. The cold wind which swept the field kept most of the would-be spectators from the bleachers hut did not pre- vent Mel Black, the Yellowjackets ace hurler, from beating the home team for'the second time this sea- son. Black Sharp The difference in the game was the veteran right hander of the visiting club, who weakened only once and yielded only four safties to Lawrence's batsmen. Until the first half of the sixthe inningBlack and Union's starting hurler, Jim Carrigg, were locked in a pretty fair pitching duel, with Rochester leading 2-1. Carrigg got .past two men in the sixth before the Roch- ester batters found the range and banged in four runs. Lefty Jim Hogan was rushed in to put out the fire, but the game was as good as over. Union's lone tally came in the fourth inning, when Co-captain Bill Harris singled h.ome a run. The Dtuchmen never threatened again and the loss left the team with a 2-4 record for the season. On Wed- nesday of next week the Union nine will play host to RPI in their secon~ meeting of the season. On the first day of the meet the 100 yard dash, 440 yard run, ahot put, and high jump will be run off. On the second day of the meet the four concluding events will be held. They will be the broad jump, 220 yard dash, 120 yard low hurdles, and the 880 yard re- lay, consisting of four men. The lacrosse team wlll have to hunt up a. new goalie again next sea.son, with the loss of Bob God· burn. As big a loss if not bigger for Frank O'Brien will be Herb Hufnagel. The .5'7\ .attack .ma.n has been a little off his scoring pace this year, but he 1 has always been the stickmen's big scoring threat. Gone from the tennis team will be big George Exner and AI Fishbone and Coach Ga1·ves wlll be losing Captain Da.ve Frost and Buck Wittner from his golf team. 5'5\. Don Mayer duplicated Goff's scoring by broad juxr..ping 19'1h\ to take first place in this event. Incidentally this and the 220 yard low hurdles were swept in their entirety by the Union aggregation. Vaulter Len Klingberg and ver- satile Bob Murray followed Mayer down the pit, while Franlt Pana- riello and Dick Woodbery took sec- ond and third behind Murray in the lows. Other individual winners included Gari Clough in the mile, John Larkin in the half-mile, Ed O'Meally in the shot put and Tom Giam bruno in the discus. • •11111 Blllllllllllil I 111•111 I I Ill II I II IIIII I II I II 1111 Ill I II II IIlii I II' 1•11 I I Jill II I I I Ill II I II II IIIII II Ill The coaches should be able to look for improved records for next year because of the experience ac- quired by their freshman and sophomore players this year.

Eliot Loshak and Norman Scull were the student participants. Also on the agenda for the busy year were the seven Philomathean Forum programs on WRUC, given on various pertinent topics of the time. The Philos also spoke at several functions in town, among tl!em the Young Students League, a program on WGY and another on WRG B television. The closing week of the season saw Kappa Alpha fraternity win the Interfraternity Debate cup, by defeating three other fraternities in the debate on: \Resolved that Gambling Should be Legalized.\ With all the results of the year nearly complete, and with 50 events finished, the Philos have to their credit a gold cup, a published de- bate, the most number of debates and wins in their history, second prize in the Hearst oratory con· test, and the satisfaction of know- • Watches, Jewelry Clocks Repaired • Engraving, too!

Thirty-five student leaders from all spheres of student activities attended this year's conclave. By Herbert M. Guston The wavering Interfraternity Council finally resolved to accept the sixteen week deferred rushing plan for next year in a hectic special meeting at Bailey Hall, Monday night. The new plans became official policy for the school's eighteen fraternities despite the opposition of a majority of the houses represented at l\londay night's conclave called by new IFC president George Batkiewicz.

Meeting Afire The meeting, held to rea,fflrm the passage of the controversial rushing rules which were enacted previously by the narrow margin of ex-president Robert H. Hochuli's tie-breaking vote, reached a climax soon after the reading of the roll call. Donald Simmons, Kappa Alpha representative, acting as spokesman for the dissident fra- ternities, called for a motion to de- lay the institution of the disputed plans for one year. In the ensuing discussion of the motion, Simmons~ pleaded that many of the houses needed time to set their finances in order before the acceptance of the new rules. Simmons, who had expected the support of 10 fraterni- ties, found himself unprepared when two houses reneged on their promises. He then asked Admin- istration representative Wilford Ketz; to explain the College's posi- tion on the issue. Mr. Ketz, at first hesitant to in t e r j e c t t he administration's policy, at last became convinced of the futility of waiting for the disagreeing r e p r e sen t atives to reach any agreement. He then read the carbon copy of a prepared expose of West College Cafeteria Silverman waa selected to succeed ::some minds if the Board was real· Although no exact determination malpractices-.

Deferred rushing, which has filled more space in Con- cordiensis than a certain Wisconsin senator has provided to both the tabloids and the Congressional Record, rece~ved a dramatic and probably final twist at the Monday meetlng of the Interfraternity Council. As a consequence Union has the term deferral, the means of attainment being discussed forthwith, and no matter how one's sentiments lie, v:e strong· ly urge that deferred rushing receive the full backmg of the campus colony. At Monday's session the College Administmtio-n, strong supporters of deferred rushing verbally, put it in writing; a little known statute was evoked to prevent an attempt to rescind the motion adopting the -term deferral, and the rush- ing rules were finally approved. This adds up to a rather hectic session of the IFC and also brings in the question of the strength of that body. Not to be overlooked either is the relationship between the College Administration and stu- dent gove1·nment. Over a month ago Wilford Ketz, coordinator of student activities, presented a recommendation to the IFC that a council .Qf Presidents would be a facile way to strengthen the group. It was defeated overwhelmingly. 'The downfall of that motion, the attendance at meetings of the IFC, and the inability to gain any clear cut decision on deferred rushing- all point out the weakness of that group as an integral part of campus government. The epitome of this pusillanimity was reached at the Monday evening session. We of Concordiensis have lately sided with those at- tempting the rescinding of deferred rushing. We were con- cerned mainly with fraternity finances, whicli seemed to point out that a year's wait before planning to defer would find the opposing houses better prepared to accept the plan. Fraternity Finances Reconsidered If these fraternities were so badly off financially, then they had their chance to defeat deferred mshing. In a state- ment read before the Interfraternity Council, Wilford Ketz explained that the Administration favored the adoptien of the term deferral. However, there was one loophole. If the fraternities saw fit they could approve an alternate plan of immediate rushing and pledging. 'With eight houses, a majority, against deferred rushing, the one week plan C()Uld have been substituted. The fraternities didn't see fit, and then managed to spend over two hours haggling over the rushing rules. · With few exceptions the Interfraternity Council has split down the middle on every proposal brought before it this year. Unanimity <>f opinion has been completely lack- ing. It is a group divided, and as a result, a very weak group. One wonders if they shouldn't win the incompetency prize for this school year. Interference by the College Administrati<m is probably not of the precedent-making nature. It is roughly equivalent to the voice that the faculty advisor has in campus activities. What is the surprising thing is the fact that about half of UJ}i<.m's fraternities were behind a proposal 'Which the Ad- mlmstratwn terms \detrimental.\ Om question is in the definition of \detrimental.\ We will grant that both the ~erm postponement and immediate rushing w<>uld offer Jess mterference to the frosh and fraternity men in their studies but we wonder if it is of such a nature :that it merits th~ college's intervention. . ,What we think really gives sanction to the Administra- tions tak1ng the stand that it has, is not the relative merit of the manner of rushing, rather it is the inability of the frater- nities to make any kind of a decision whatsoever. Never has a group kicked .a question around for so long without getting anxwhere~ I~ IS far from absurd to say that th~ IFC would st111 be debatmg the pros and cons until next fall if some- pressure hadn't been exerted from without. ' · . If any of the fraternities plan to shed any tears, we'd advrse them not to. Before they }}lead poverty, we'd recom- mend the~ realize that they have only themselves to blame. If the claim that budgets couldn't be balanced is true it ~hould ha~e be~n argued in a lucid form which left no do~bt m anyone s mmd. Now that we have deferred rushing let's give it a fair chance. ' -J. J. 0 .. The Administration of the College had hoped that t):le Student Council and the Interfraternity Council could fol'· mulate a deferred rushing system for the c-oming year that would serve the best interest of the student body. Though a sixteen week deferred rushing program has been approved by the Interfraternity Cou,ncil and similar sentiment has been expressed by the Student Council,. i·t is apparent that the Interfraternity Council at this time is far from general agreement concerning this matter. The Administration of the College believes that one of its primary responsibilities is to provide for its students every possible opportunity for them to conform to the academic requirements of the College. It further believes that the rushing plans of the past several years has amply demonstrated that a short deferred rushing program of from two to eight weeks is detrimental to the academic welfare of both freshmen and :fraternity members. Past experience dictates that rushing· should be deferred for one full semester or that rushin,g and pledging be completed by the end of the first week of the college year. The Trustees and Administration of the College en- dorse the .principle of deferred rushing, .believing that the advantages to be gained by the freshmen and the College in general outweigh the ·difficulties that migh-t be experi- enced by some of the fraternities. If, however it is felt that, the pre~en~ly approved sixteen ~eek defer;ed plan is unwise at this hme then the alternative plan of immediate rushing and pledging must be adopted. ~hichever plan is adopted by the Interfraternity Council and. approved by the Student Council, if they desire to take actiOn, the College Administration will insist that the plan so approved be followed by all fraternities. · which to aim.

Fm·mer Editor Offers One Last Parting Shot To the Ed!to1· of Concordiensis: Unlike Jay Cohn, I don't write a column for the Concordiensis to use as a vehicle for eltpressing my farewell sentiments. The editor of the Concordiensis is in a pecularily advantageous· positi9n to ·observe the behavior of Union College and its community, I was fortunate enough to hold this vantage point for several months earlier this year and most of my pertinent remarks we11e stated in the editorial column at that time. However, I'd like to take one parting shot in this final issue. The college student is expected to go through a maturation period during his matTiculation. His• ideas change, his interests dev.elop; his approach to problems, his accept- ance of responsibility all undergo scrutiriizaHon during his four year college career. Unfortunately the college doesn't always. realize this change. What is worse, the student is also sometimes slow to appreci- ate the difference.

SCHWA:RTZ West College Notice Since we plan to house alumni ·in West College .June 6 and 7, · it is re;quested that all men · , turn i:n their keys as soon as th!ly -vacate their rooms. .AJl · dormitory keys must be turned . i:n t~t the Business Office by A Return to Mediocrity Jay more than adequately dis- cussed the role of the college in the handling of the changed student. The time 'has arrived for the col- lege to widen the scope for the up- perclassman. Freshmen are treated as fifth year high school students because they supposedly ·do not have the sense of responsibility ·and the experience and wisdom needed to make unfettered choices. The college feels that it must make de- cisions for the students. By slowly widening his scope, the college should develop the prerequisites necessary to make responsible and reasonable decisions. If this is suc- cessful, then the student should be emotionally and intellectually de- veloped by :his final two years to be permitted a wider latitude of choice.

What we fear is that it may be a step in a retmn to mediocrity. The class is small, much smaller that the 363 of 1950, and also slightly fewer in number than last year's graduates. More important than numbers, however, is the feeling, on our part at least, that with them goes a genuine interest in Union College which will not be matched by any of the three remaining classes. grateful ·beyond words fox yotLr un- These charts further state that f T Sophia dates most often in fra- the students' o:w:n risk.

Obviously the college does not feel it is successful enough during the early part of college training, for there is still a narrow range of choice for the student. There is no reason for the college to in- sist that seniors (and juniors) should attend all Classes, or take five courses, or sit through exam- inations. ing to apologize for, but r am. \Veil rah\ colllilgiate piaces- and road- aware of having had monents of houses. Next in frequency came This is something that can't be chalked up to hero-wor- ship. There are certain dynamic qualities which can't be picked out specifically. But, anyone who has had an \in\ with activities will know the contributions they have made. If any one facet is to be singled out, it would have to be leadership. This quality alone is one which distinguishes the senio1· class from its successors. ACTIVITIES HAVE SUFFERED We of Concordiensis have reason to mourn this exit of leadership qualities, for two former editors of this publica- tion say farewell. But we are not alone. Activities in general have suffered from poor support. When the p1·esent class departs, the need for replacements ,.,.ill be even mot·e acute. If verve is the lifeblood of activities, then there will have to be a great change in the students that remain at Union. If we rna~· be permitted to extend our range of gener- alities, perhaps what we are recognizing is a growing trend on the part of American Youth to be \followers.'' To do as little as possible is becoming a sacrament rathe1· than a sacrilege. It can readily bt> seen here at Union. A study of activities at Union in the past year makes it evident .that the undergraduate is increasingly of the kind that desires to be obliviom; to, rather than aware of, the problems of everyday life. The Mountebanks were dormant this vear. The task of reorganization fell to a gmduating senior: The continuance of the dramatic group is in the hands of next year's under- graduates. The l\lountebanks seem headed for renascence, but will other activities have a temporary downfall? We have seen tendencies in other groups this year. It can be seen in the quality and quantity of support of these groups themselves, ancl in the continued investigations of the ail- ments of many other organizations. Fewer activities keys were awarded this year, due large- ly to the fact that there were a smaller n1,1mber of people that deserved them. The Interfraternity Council spent more than one teTm debating deferred rushing, and even then couldn't come to a majority decision. Union seems to have engendered an undergraduate body which is pleased with its own indecisions. Leadership is lacking, and, returning to the senior class, it seems that with them goes many of better campus leaders. Will they be replaced? One has to look hard to find suitable replacements in the remaining undergraduates. Let us hope that Union does not find itself heir to a campus of \lotos-eaters.'' ACADEMICALLY THEY'RE FINE What began as an adieu to the senior class, has evolved into a study of their followers. But the contrast makes us realize even further the fine class which we are losing. We have shown that they have been leaders in activities. They are not con trained to this one field. Academically they are one of Union's finest. Twenty of them have received stage appointments. This means that about ten percent of the class of 1952 has received an average index of 4.0 or better. Those of them who have applied to graduate school have received almost phenomenal success in their accept- ances. . This is a class worthy of the name. They have served Umon well. We know we echo the sentiments of the entire campus when we wish them luck. They are entering a strife- stricken world. Their training at Union should enable them to overcome whatever difficulties they encounter. They leave us an academic and leadership heritage which will be hard to .equal. We hope we can fl.11fi11 this heritage. ---J. J. c. What I am more concern!ld with, ar.d which I devotedly editorialized most about during my editorship, was the role of the student in bringing about his own develop- ment. Before I permit the reader to misunderstand my above re- marks, let me state that while I feel the student should have a wider latitude for making decisions and choices, Union College offers many opportunities to its students. I merely feel lift at all of the above could and should be greater. Professor Peter Viereck, of Mount Holyoke College, recently stated that generations of Ameri- can college students alternate be- tween sophistication and commit- ment. The sophistication he de- ~cribes is not complimentary; it mvolves retreat from worldly problems and an apathetic concern with their resolution. It is a re- treat to the art museums, with no interest in creativeness. Today's student, charges Viereck, is sophis- ticated-and uncommited. A previous generation of stu- dents; when faced with a similar di~ema that we face today, com- mrtted themselves squarely against the threat of totalitarian naziism and fascisrn. Our generation is charged from running away from the threat of totalitarian com- mun-ism. The alternative tha:t many of our demagogic elders present to us is not a pretty one. They tell us that the only way we can fight communism is by embracing a native nee-fascism. necessarily like Mao and should be cell mates of Gene Dennis. .

.. 4 FRIDAY. _MAY 23, 1~52 Normalcy Keynotes the School By Herbert L Spira Y .·· .· r.Campus . ea . CuUiniJs ~----~~----------~----~----------------~----------~--~~------~----~----~----------~----- As the last issue of the Con- cordiensis f0t' 1951-52 rolls off the presses it brings home, t~e realization that another academtc year at Union College has come and gone. Viewed in relation ta the complex political, economic, and social interaction of the world that provides Union's social set- ting, the recurrent happenings dur- ing this year are pretty inslgni- fican t. It is true that most of what took place at Union this year could not claim earthshaking im- portance, but much of it will continue to yield enduring satis- faction when viewed in retrospect because of their }larts in filling Union's 157th year, and making it a milestone to those who helped shape it. 951 Enter Union Tradition-hallowed gates swung open last Septembel' to admit some 951 seekers of knowledge, the fi:rst \normal\ en1~ollment since the war. It is ironic that the lead story of the year's first Concordiensis nar-. rated the enlargement of the R.O:T.C. to 393 students and the extension of its curriculum and teaching faculty to meet increased demands. The first axe of the year de- scended abruptly on the Mounte- banks which was disbanded as the Student Tax Committee voted to withdraw financial support. Schwartz ~1' Cohn October brought spirited rivalry between freshmen and sophomores for the Clifford J. McQIJ.one trophy, emblematic of class supremacy. Don Schwartz replaced Jay Cohn as Editor of the Concordiensis. As the four week rushing period came to an end, and 183 bids to fraterni- ties were accepted, the Interfra- • ternity Council began its marathon consideration of the possibility of instituting deferred l>ushing, During October a movement for an Independent Council began to gather momentum, spearheaded by the hard work of Oscar Grusky.
