The past week has been a fitting· climax to this ironic tale as Van Doren, suddenly .forced to reveal himself a:s a willing .partner in the TV quiz scandals, finds himself after his \ordeal\ even more the dashing hero to the Ame1ican public than when he was merely the brilliant young money winner. It is certainly an interesting phenomenon in American public opinion that a man who has not only played a signi- ficant role in a national scandal, but has also lied to a Cengressional Investigating ·Committee should be taken to the country's breast merely because he finally, and quite belatedly, told the truth. Perhaps Van Doren has be- come a modern Daniel Webster wrestling with the Devil and because of his ultimate victory over the forces of evil, he has become a symbol of the man victimized by the forces around him, who eventually finds the honest path by vir- tue of his basic integrity. The personal tragedy of Van Doren certainly must gain one's sympathies. However, it is far more difficult to justify the emulation and praise offered him even by the members of the Congressional Committee before whom he made his confession. For if Mr. Van Doren was sincere in the reasons he gave for participating in the \quiz hoax\ then he was an incredibly naive young man. One finds it hard to believe that a man of Va.n Doren's great intellect could actually believe that his desire to raise the status of the intellectual in the public eye justified the type of action he took. To commend a man of this type is nothing more than a paradox. He may deserve our pity, but he certainly does not warrant our praise. Said Rep. Steven Derounian, the only member of the Cong-ressional committee not to join his colleagues in praising Van Doren, \I don't think an adult of your intelligence ought to be commended for tell- ing the truth.\ In the end, :iVIr. Van Doren has dealt a serious blow to the status of the intellectual, as he was the first to admit. For once again the intellectual has attempted to come out and tackle the world of advertising and public opinion, and once again he has finished a poor second. Van Doren at- tempted to become a public hero on the basis of his truly superb intellectual ability. Instead he has become a figure <>f public emulation merely because he has finally told the truth. The greatest problem of the American intellectual is to counteract the \egghead\ label which has been placed upon him by public opinion. Instead of helping to alleviate this stigma, Van Doren has furthered the picture of the intelligent academic intellectual who finds himself hope- lessly naive about the worldngs of the practical world. Thus, those who heap praise on Van Doren no longer remember him in his intellectual capacity, but rather in his role of the man beset by temptations, who finally de- cided to rectify his errors and cleanse his soul. However, those who do remember Van Do1·en's academic ability, ha:ve only sympathy for the man as a victim of practicalities of which he is totally naive. But the intellectual craves respect, not sympathy. For without respect, the intellectual is left with little else oher than his academic integrity. In order to assume a position as a motivating force in his society, the intellec- tual must first effect a reevaluation of his status in the public eyt:l. The actions of ~r. Van Doren have only moved the realization of the intellectual's goal bac~ yet another s.tep. 'Mock Ballot Analyzed The Faculty Outlook Sy James Reidel In a relatively light turn\out Union College scholars cast their ballots Tuesday in about the same way as did their elders in the state. In fact, unlike last year even the margin of victory was roughly the same on campus as in Schenectady for may(]r and coun- cilmen. Interest in the Northway prop- osition had been building up on campus since juniot• Ro.bert Thur- ber last spring pro~d about the ca,mpus for SU·pporters on his side in the controversy. On this, State propositon No. 2, the college vote was almost identieal with the stat~· tally. But on the third proposition, concerning testimony of public offieials, Union voters appeared to be considerably more lenient on reluctant office iholders under investigation than was the state at large. Nixon Swamps Rockefeller was passed u~animously here at Union. Thanks to Senators Mundt and Dirksen efforts to knock out the ·obnoxious affront to Ameri- can collegians was .frustrated by two votes. Several of the \top quality\ colieges have this year rejected loans under the :Act rath- er than force students to make a choice between using this loan source or declining to swear that they are not law-breakers under conditions not imposed on any other class of government-aid re- cipients. In a close :vote the stu- dents voted to keep the olean fund at Union. Honor SystEm Endorsed An 'hanoi\ system at Union Col- lege was endorsed 2 to 1. One hesitated to draw any parallel -be- tween the vote on that proposi- tion and the following one: \Are the Union College social rules un- reasonable to enforee?\ By ·a similar vote the scholars indicated that they were not. Some ·cynics on the faculty may well ask if they intend to self-enforce the honor system the way .they self- enforce the \No women above the first floor\ sociil.l rule! Unreas- onable or not, the social ·rules are only spottily adhered to in so far as they are Inhibiting to an ex- pansive mood, and until recently, enforced largely by self-discipine, if at all. Any \rule\ that is widely resisted and ignored, and seldom if ever enforced, ceases to be a \rule\ even in courts of law for practical purposes. Now the students declare by ballot that the rules are not un- reasonable to enforce. It must be assumed that, since .enforce- Friday. Nov~mber 6. 1959 NSA: In South A·frica Bf KennHoyt .As the national student union for the United States, USNSA is very much concerned with stu- den~ condi1;ion!;, university life, and ·student organization abroad. The principle focus of cooperation on the international level is the International Student Conference, USO.J, an annual meeting of 63 representati:v'e national unions of students. In addition there are a multitude of bilateral relations ·conducted with individual\ na- tional unions. Occasionally, there comes· to bhe fore an emergency issue which d·emi:tnds· the immediate attention of USNSA and its member ·schools. O'ne exam,ple was the HuNgarian affah. Another, with which .the remain.der of this arti- cle Will deal, concerns the ca,se of ·a ·single student. In 1921 South West Africa was taken from Germany and estab- lished as a proteetorate· under the supervision of the Union of S(}uth Africa by a :Mandate of the League ·of Nations. Upon the. for- mation of t'l:J,e United Nations, South West :Africa came under tlhe trust provision of .A:rticle 93 of the United Nations Chartev. According .to specification 31 of the continuing mandates and tvust, the Union of South Africa has the responsibiUty of reporting periodically back to the U;ni.ted Nations Trusteeship Couneil. The Union of .South Africa has failed to meet this responsibility and, in addition, has unhesitatingly and tyrannically imposed an extreme- ly repressive form· of its own apartheid policies upon l;louilh West Africa without the consent of the people of t)le Trust Terri- tory. Thus the United Nations has .questioned the Union of South Africa's pos~tion and has attempt- ed .to eXert pressure for tl).e clari~ f·ication thereof. Education is Inadequate Since there are no institutions of higher edueation in ·Soutlh West Africa, any students seeking high- er education <are req:uired to study abroad. Yet, because ii.f the eompletely inadequate level of secondary school education, there are few students .prepared to con- tinue there education on the uni- !Versity level. Even worse, the government of .the Union of South Africa does not allow those .few students who are qualified to st\ldY abroad to do so, unless a-broad is taken to mean the Union of South :Africa. · Hans J. Beukes, a citizen of Southo West Africa, while study- ing at .the University of Cape- town, was awarded a three-year scholarship to study law and eQo- nomics at Oslo ·University. The scholarship was one o~ <a series of award.9 made by the N!itdona:l Union of Nm:'weglan Students through the National Union of Stu d e·n t.s of So~th Africa. (NUSAS'). However, in June 1,959 :Mr. Beultes was deprived of his passpoi.--t .by ,the government of the Union of South Af·rlca on tlhe grounds. that he had Qeen seen ip. the company of ·••subversives.\ He .then fled to Bechuanaland, Where, with the assistance of interested parties a~d a. contribution qf $-'TOO by delegates of the 12th National Student Congress, he. obtained ·a ,visa to the United Stafes and en- planed for New York for the pur~ pose of presenting lh.is .own and his' peoples' case to the United Nations. rleli for Oppressed •On October 13 a.n.d 14, 1959· 'Mr. Beukes, .an Anglican priest, and three young Amed;cans, (among them one Allard K. Lowenstein; a New York lawyer ·and a former President of .USNSA) presented to the Trusteeship Committee of the .Qeneval A.;~semlbly, \ 'the desperate hope' of the natives of South West Africa for international action to relieVt} them of racial oppression. What has been accomplished so far? Mr. ;Beukes has gone ou to take ·UP his studies at ()slo Un-i- versi~y, but he is faced with the unpleasant fact that he niay never return to pjs homeland -as long as the Union of Soutlh Afric~;t U.dlninisters the tel'Titory. USNSA has sent to the United Nations, the governments of the, Union of South_ Africa, and the United States, to NUSAS; the Afri• kaans Studentenbund, and to the U. S. Ambassador to the Union of South Africa, and to the ISO,. a resolution asking for the restora- tion of Mr. Beukes's paasport, the removal of dlreet or less formal prohibitions on t'h.e right of stu- dents of South West Africa to equal educational opportunities and the pursuit of higher educa· tion.

Kt>yt>d Up The hard driving Hartwick' squad was lteyed up for the game. and despite the bad weather about 50 persons from the State Teacher's College drove up to: root their team on. Hartwiclr's goal was scored during the first period and despite deep penetra- tion::> into Hart wick territory, the Dutchmen just couldn't get the ball into the nets. This was the team's fourth straight Joss, the third shutout, and ended a season that had in- itially seemed very promising for the Garnet boaters. Off to a fast start the Dutchmen post- ed wins over Hamilton. Oneonta State Teachers and Middlebury. Against Rochester they were shut out, but carne back to win against Syracuse. At this point with four games left it appeared that the Dutchmen would pick up at least one more win and possibly two. Slwnp PPrplPxity What actually was the cause of the final slump is difficult to say. The main reason would !H'em to be lack of depth.

More Reasons Another cause for the final de- feats was the failure of the Gar- net attack to score. Repeated tries for goals. missed by frac- tions of an inch or would hit the wooden rim. AI Hansford who scored eight times in his first six games, was held scoreless and did not equal his record of eleven goals during the 1958 season.

Intramural Season Draws to Clese The in tram ural football season will draw to a close .next week' with the final playoffs between the Southern, Eastern and North- et·n lleague and the Independ- ents of the Southern League. Beta was the only undefeated. team in the three leagues this year, winning all five of their games. Their opponents, the In-· dependents, won the playoffs in the Eastern League by defeating both Theta Delta Chi and Delta Phi. The champion of the South- ern League will be decided Thurs- day, November 5 wiUl the playoff taking place between Phi Delta Theta and Delta Chi. This year the playoffs will not be of the round~robin variety but z·a ther they will be contests of straight elimination between the three ·champions. The winner of the Phi Delta Theta-Delta Chi 'will draw a bye for the first game of the playoffs. With the closing of the foot- ball season close at hand, the volleyball intramural games started this week to be followed closely by basketball intramurals.

Van Doren applied for the position, he would be very glad to have him on the staff. A theoretical sitU· ation was put bt>fore Dr. Xiemey· er in which Van Doren caught a student cribbing. Could Van Doren morally turn the student in? The English professot· felt that having gone through such turmoil, Mr. Van Doren was more qualified to do so than most peo· pie. Dr. Niemeyer added that he \was shocked that Columbia had accepted Van Doren's resigna· tion.\ Professor Coffin revealed that he had never seen the show and knew little about the situation. However, he stated that Van Doren impressed him as \an in- currably naive young man\ whose value would depend strictly on his prominence as a teacher. Dean Pollock said that while he didn't know the man, he had an inclination to respect his past with the exception of this one deed. The Dean of Students stat· ed that he believed that a fac· ulty member should b~have \as if on a pedestle\ and therefore he couldn't see clear to hiring Mr. Van Doren if the hypotheti· cal question was before him. Professor Bradbury said he could not respect such a man. He believed that the TV star has harmed the intellect of the coun· try by creating a false impres- sion of a professor. He would not hire the man. and would ac- cept his resignation. Bradbury did say, however, that it w·ould be possible for Mr. Van Doren to gain a student body's respect. Police ...

(Continued from Page 5) For the ll!Ost part, the Gar- net's chances came in the first half, when the visitors dominated the yardage with six first downs to Williams' two, and a 123-57 edge in total yards gained. It was the same pattern as last year when the Dutchmen held a much stronger Williams team to a one .t.9uch-down margin in the first half. The Joss left Union with an 0-5-1 record with two games left, against Kings Point and Hamil- ton. Williams upped their season mark to 2-4, in picking up their 33rd win in 58 tries against the Dutchmen. \What's In It F'j)r Me?\ The second question that seems always to arise in discussions about honesty is \What will It get me in terms of social or ma- terial rewards?\ I must admit that the evidence is strong and compelling on the point of success being identified with attaining increasing power at whatever costs. I suppose Mr. Van Doren stands out as an illus- tration that those who occupa- tionally or professionally choose not to enter the economic market on its more ruthless terms are often, by this fact, found to be farthest removed from the exer- cise of economic and political power in the larger society.

Defending the Deed At their most recent meeting, the Und~rgradua.te Publications Board unanimously passed a motiOn t_o d~s­ continue the \Prom Issue\ editions of the Concordiensis. The decision was based on the theory that a \Prom Issu.e\ is valuable only to the extent in which the quality of 1ts humor approaches an adult level, and since recent issues had approached a nadir in quality, they had ceased to have a function for the college community. . Humor is perhaps the most difficult type of litera- ture to produce successfully. It requires careful thought and lengthy planning. The Concordiensis has found that in the week's time which it has to produce a \humor issue\ it has often been forced to include material de- cidedly in bad taste along with its more cleverly written stories. Humor written under the pressure of. a close deadline, often takes on the qualities of personality slur- ring, petty jealousies and trite references to sexual sub- jects. Humor of this type is neither funny, nor worth the effort used to produce it. The Concordiensis is a newspaper, not a humor mag- azine. The talents of its staff are geared to the problems of journalism, not comedy. We sincerely feel that we can be of greater service to the college community by pro- ducing a competent newspaper edition than we can by writing a \second-rate\ humor magazine. However, the Editorial Board feels that there is cer- tainly a place for a hu~orous publication o~ high qua}ity in a Prom Weekend settmg. In order to ach1eve the high- ly to be desired goal of a Prom Weekend publication con- taining high-level humor written in good taste, the ~on­ cordiensis proposes the formation of a new and entirely independent organization, a Humor Magazine, which would come under the auspices of the Undergraduate Publications Board, and would concern itself only with the publication of three \humor issues\ on the three col- lege Prom Weekends. The Concordiensis would be happy to assist in the initiation of such a publication, and would welcome any student opinion on, and interest in the project.

There is also and always a reality, a set of past and present facts and at- titudes. Responsibility is the ad- justment of ideas, or ideals, to realities to ideas. The adjustment is always possible, but often dif- ficult. Witness the idea of equal- ity in the reality of the American South. An honor system at Union is possible-and difficult. There are a number of long-standing cus- toms at Union. You know them better than I, but I hear enough. These customs will have to be abolished sudde·nly, drastically, if an honor system is legislated. In the South it took guns, and the idea still is not won. I like the idea and for four years lived unde1• it. At every examination, I signed a pledge that I had \neither given nor ·re- ceived aid\; and at every exam- ination I signed the correlative pledge that I would report any infraction that I had witnessed. The system can work only with that correlative pledge-r solemn- not live up to his pledge to re- port any and all infractions will stand up. No one stood. He would have been torn down in bits. Next day seventeen bids from the seventeen clubs. An extremely embarrassing popular- ity. Students Hesitant to \Peach\ Are all Union men really ready now to be disloyal ( ?) to fra- ternity brothers, friends, engi- neers, artists for an ide·a? They will all report that thumbing through of fraternity files, that peer over the shoulder, that un- acknowledged quotation, that lit- tle discussion in the wash room? I hope so. But I seem to dis- cover in my discussions with un- dergraduate friends that Union has not the present temper to sanction such disloyalties. The idea seems to crack up against the intransigent fact. As I say, I am all for an honor system. I shall be delighted to discover that the student body wants it-wants it enough to sign away old traditions and loyalties.

This trend has ·been no- ticed on the graduate, as well as undergraduate revel. In a recent letter to the Wooorow Wilson ~el­ lowship nominees; Sir Hugh Tay- lor, president of the fellowship foundation, observed that over half of. the Fellows elected to go to seven graduate schools. The result is that ;the number of Woodrow Wilson Fellows desiring to study in som:e universities is considera,bly in excess of the num~ ber the institutions wish to ac- cept. Henc:e many fellows do not gain acceptance to the school of their choice. The fact that these men,. sup- posedly the cream of the crop, have trouble getting into gradu- ate school is evidence of the sit- uation-there just isn't enough room -ih the \name\ schools; it is foolish for students interested in graduate stud,ies to limit their applications to t:h,eli!e schpols.

,, I' 4 Friday. November 13 1 1959 Freshman Gridders End Season With 31-6 Victory Over RPI Union Harriers Finish Sixth At State Meet Engineering Society Sees Serious Faculty Shortage By Arthur Fliednum. On a cold, bleak Saturday0 afternoon last weekend, the I sun shone for the Union College Freshman Football team as they romped to an easy 31-6 victory over RPI. before the brave spectators who turned out to witness the Alexander Field contest. It is difficult to single out any feW' players since the victory was mainly a team effort. However, the passing of quarteJ Lack D'avc Eales wa.s tht• outstanding offen- sive weapon for the Garnet year- lings. Much credit must also be given to Keith Flint, halfback \Chick\ Swam, ful!Lack, Hudy Cms~hcltl ami Chuck D..,d, cull;:;, 1 auu a forward wall leu by Ray I Gilmartin at ct:nlcr, Boll DiCocco a 1 guard, and Bill Miner at tackle. The Garnet <:untrolled the game throughout and only an 80 yard kickoff I'eturn !laved RPI from being whitewashed. llnion Starts March -VIsAid Photo It was only midway through thP first period that l'nion start- ed their march. A 40 yard pass from Eales to Jack Screba brought the ball to the RPI 44. Three line plunges move the ball to the 33 and the remaining dis- tance was covered by a touch- down pass from Eales to Flint. A pass play from Eales to Flint for two extra points failed and the score stood at 6--0. An unid .. ntifi<'d Union baclt is shown bolting for the goitl lint• rapidly but unsuccessfu.Icy pursued by tacklers from RPI. ThP gllflllt' ••nded in a 31-6 Union \'ictory as the frPSiunen ended their sea~on wi1ih a 1-3 record. A 21 yard pass from Eales to Flint, later in the half, gave Union a first and ten on the RPI 37. This thrust was thwarted at the RPI 20 by a pass interception. The Engineers from Troy moved for a first down at their 30, but then Union held and RPI was forced to kick. Left end Deci raced in to block the kick and Union recovered on the RPI 16. On the second play, after a line plunge had gained only one yard. Eales dropped back and tossed a short pass to fullback Swain who carried it in for a 15 yard scoring play. Pete Blshko's attempted conversion was blocked and the score stood at 12-{) as the first half came to a close. Union's Third Score RPI kicked off to start the sec- ond half and Union marched from their own 32 to the Engi- neer 23 before RPI took over on an intercepted pass. RPI was forced to kick and again Deci crashed through to block it. 'l'his gave Union a first and goal' from the eight. On the second play Pete Burgwald crashed in from the one. Once again the ·kick con- version attempt failed and the score stood at 18-Q. An Eales to Umscheid-pass was good for nine yards to the 34 as the third quarter ended. Union continued their drive into the fourth period with an Eales to Umscheid pass moving the ball to the Engineer's 16. On fourth and about 20 Eales connected with Flint on a wide flanker pass play to the three yard line. However, a 15 yard personal foul penalty brought the ball baclt to the 18_ After a running play net- ted three yards, Eales hit Flint in the end zone for the touchdown. The extra .point try failed, and Union now led by a score of 24-0. 80 Yard Run MadE> .on the ensuing kickoff, the RPI safety man took the boot and ran it back over 80 Y!lrds for the only Engineer score. At his own 40, he avoided a host of Gar- net dPfenders and from that point on he simply outraced his nearest opponents. A pass try for two extra points was incomplete, making the score 24-6. On the first play from scrim- mage after the kickoff, Eales un- corkE>d a 30 yard pass to Um- scheid who took the ball in full stride and outran the defenders the rest of the way for a touch- clown. Wayne Leece converted to make the score 31-S. The team ended up the season with a rather disappointing 1-3 record, but with a few more breaks could have reversed it to 3-1. They were beaten 21-6 by Wsleyan, 20-7 by Rochester, and 18-14 by the University of Ver- mont fresh. Lambert Cu.p List Posted Delaware's powerful football eleven found the mud and rain of last Saturday to its liking and crushed Temple, 52-0, for its sev- enth straight triumph of 1959, its ninth straight over two seasons. In so doing, the Blue Hens of coach Da VP Nelson earned unan- imous selection fm· the fifth \traight weel1 as top team in the I'ace for th<> 3rcl annual Lambert Cup, emblem of the small college football championship of the East, from the selection committee of roache.s, writers and bi'oadcasters. In winning over Temple, Dela- ware clinched the Middle Atlantic ConferE>nce championship. In their· Sl'\'<'n victories this year they have scored 256 points or 36 a game while yielding 59 points or 8 a game. Bowling Green and Bucknell, the sixth-ranlted team, remain on the Delaware schedule. Juniata. Second On the strength of its decisive H-to-0 victory over Drexel, un- beaten Juniata moved up to sec- ond place on this week's ballot. Juniata has won seven games this year and hasn't been defeated in its last 27 contests. Janiata has averaged 32 points a game while allowing 4 a game this fall. Rounding- out the top ten are Lehigh 13-4), Buffalo 16-ll, Con- necticut t5-3l, Bucknell 13-4), West Chester' 1 6-1 l, Lafayette, 13-4), Hofstra 16-0l, and a tie be- tween Tufts c:>-1-1) and Rochester 15-1) for tenth.

Dr. Hazen spoke to an assembly of Tau Beta Pi delegates, from various colleges, at Purdue University. The es- sence of Dr. Hazen's speech fol- lows: Dr. Hazen emphasized the ad- vantages accruing to the profes- sot' of engineering (or the pro- fe:<sor of any field of knowledge, for· that matter). For one thing, a. professor can continue to .be a studt•nt. Opportunities for indi- vidual r~search and study are abundant. One of the most at- tr-acti\'e features of engineering instruction is that one can com- hinr tenrhing with creative pro- fes~ional worlc Additionally, the instructor lives in the mid,;t of the academic com- munity. He is exposed to the influences of his pupils just as they are exposed to his and he cannot ,but profit from the \fresh- ness\ that serious students add to a growing body of knowledge. <Continued on Page 6) GOING ELECTRIC AND Your opportunities for advancement at Public Service Electric and Gas Company are excel· lent.

From the very beginning Sam hinted at things to come, as he led the freshman foot- ball team to an undefeated season from his fullback slot. In his varsity years, Hammerstrom was outstanding, to say the least. By his senior year he gained national recognition for his fourth in the nation showing, in scoring, and was voted to the first team of the Little All-American. He was the president of the 1940 senior class and received the Bailey Cup for rendering the most service to his school. Besides these athletic Sam Departs . Sam Hammerstrom's departure came as a surprise to everyone, including himself. His eight year old son, John, became ill and it was necessary for him to move to a warmer and drier climate, such as that in Arizona. Sam's teams were noted for their aggressiveness, good spirit, and sportsmanship, just as he was. He sincerely felt that Un- ion's handling of the football sit- uation was in the right and thus he fought hard for the system. Much of our present-day policy is due to him. In short the Sam Rammer- strom-Union College relationship was an excellent and a close one -one that will be remembered many years from now.

Friday, November 13, 1•959 Contest Outcome 0 Not Predictable By John I.ubetldn \We anticipate a very rough ball game,\ Coach Keith Doyle said in refer- ence to tomorrow's tradi- tional game against Hamil- ton. \This is our biggest rivalry,\ Doyle continued, \but we feel that this ran be our game. It's not going to Le that easy, though, and we'1·e definitely going to have to fight for it.\ Tomon<>w at 1:30 P. M., the l'nion C'oiiPgP Dutchm<'n will mC'Pt thP Hn.milton :Continentals fnt• thP sixty-fourth time since 1R90 L:1\t >\\\\ th<> Contirwntals c:1 ppPd off :t n undc>fPa lt•d season with nn lll-0 gamP that wa,; fought during a blinding rain\torm. To datP both teams have com- piled unimpressive records. The Union College aggregation has an 0-6-1 rC'cord while their Clinton opponents are entering Alexander Field with a 1-5 season. All prev- ious performances indicate an ex- <'PE'dingly close game. :Erec>g H£>ady Coach Doyle believes that his team will be at full strength for tomorrow's game. Although star sophomore quarterback Stew Walls was injured in the King's Point game, it is believed he will be ready to go all the way. An- other question mark was ECAC junior halfbaclt Jimmy Erceg, but the scrappy back turned in a fine performance against King's Point and will also be ready. Tomorrow's game should be the best of the season. All odds Indicate an exceedingly close game with neither team being favored. Comparative scores show very little. Although the Conti- nPntals were able to defeat the Hobart team, that had tied thP Dutchmen two weeks earlier, it •hould be pointed out that in the earlier game Union end Dave ;vntchell was not in uniform, and Marquf'z was out for the se<:ond half vrith an ankle injury. Both teams lost by equal scores to RPI and against King's Point the Dutchmen played a better game than did Hamilton. Coach Doyle is hoping for good weather. \A wet field,\ he said, \will definitely hamper us. We have no extreme speed and its tougher for the ends to get down- field for a pass play in the mud.\ He pointed out that despite ex- tremely good passers, on both squads, there is no reason to as- sume the game would be domin- ated by pass plays. \Running- wise we have proved that we can move the ball against big lines. The King's Point statistics do not show that over a 100 yards were caiiGd back because of penalties or lost because of passers b .:!lg unable to find an open receive!.\ DPfensive Lap~t>s Hurt As for the team in general coach Doyle pointed out that de- fensive lapses hurt the Dutchmen the most. Missed blocks and letting n.n end get loose \have been our higgGst weaknesses,\ he said. \It costs us wh(!n ·w<' make these mistakes.\ he continued. \but we've rome a long way, a helluva long way. this year.\ The other weakness Doyle points out is the great lack of depth. \With 1050 boys in the college \ve should hn.ve> more than 23 men on the squad.\ This can bl' the Dutchmen's ball game. If the team performs as \\'ell as they have in the past two games, there is a truely strong chance of a victory. ll .. hm lu Neu' Ynrk Jl'iJit(!I[lipp 14 E. 44th St. • New York 17, N.Y.

The first performance of The Trial will be Monday night December 7th at 8:30 P.M. The play will continue to run througfi Wednesday of the same week. Directing the play will be Pro· fessors Nelson and Wingate. Rich- ard Heineman has been placed in charge of production. George DiCenzo plays the role of Mr. Joseph K., who is awak- ened in his apartment one morn- ing and informed of his arrest. Having committed no crime of which he was aware, Mr. K. im- mediately begins a frantic and futile search for his accuser and the nature of the C'rime of which he has been accused. This search constitutes the body of Kafl{a's play, which involves a cast of nearly thirty actors playing char- acters whose significance is ap- proximately equal. As the play progresses, Joseph K. comes no closer to solving his problem. The longer he searches. the more confused he becomes. and his actions become those of a guilty man. Receiving no help fror~1 anyone, including hi:l lawyer, 'he 1s crushed to such an extent that at the end, he sincerely be- lieves in his own guilt even though he never determined the nature of his crime. Kafka has created an almost unreal situation by combining sev- eral logical coherent scenes into an illogical whole. His unusual perception of reality is evident m his insistance on exactness in certain details and a complete ~eglect of others. Nearly Pqual- mg Kafka's originality, is an im- prt•ssionistic stage designed to fa- cilitate the easy switchmg of about thirty scenes. o--- Retirements (Continued from Page 1) believes that \the age of 65 de- serves study.\ Smith expects to .lead an active retirement.

If he is to work in the best interests of the student,\ the pricary consid- eration is that the advisers 'be interested In their job ... and that they avoid academic rivalry and questions of departmental prestige.\ Given Little Tho-ught Professor Coffin expressed the opinion that the advisory system in most colleges is given little thought and preparation. He feels that more emphasis should be placed on the importance of the choosing of advisors by the administration, and when a re- liable g-roup is organized, it should remain the official adVisory body for as long as possible.

The Faculty Questionnaire appearing in this issue of C()ucordiensis is the culmination of an investigation on the part of the newspaper, to discover how the faculty felrt about the problem of student honesty and the formation of an honor system. After a careful examination of the individual questionnaires was made, it was concluded that the prevailing opinion amongst the faculty favored an honor system as idealistically sound, but expressed serious doubts about the p~·acticality of such a system.

We find it far more difficult than the faculty has, to separate the issue into these two aspects.

Enzer's new sea- tertamment. ther continuation, this opinion · An honor system demands a highly specific set of values in otder to operate efficiently. lt is the common be- lief that these values can be boiled down to the single trait, honesty, however this assumplion i:> a gross over- simplification of the situation. If the student under an honor system \vere only responsible for his own behavior, then one might validly claim that the success of such a system would .depend directly on the strength of the stu- dent's individual honesty. If, however, the student were also asked to police the behavior of his colleagues, then he would have to sel'iously test the strength of his friendship and group values as well as the tenacity of his honesty. Thus the values required by an honor system demand of the student that he place his group ties in a position sub- ordinate to his sense of individual honor which the system assumes is present. • ~ow the question must•arise: ls it wise, either ideal- istically or practically, to ask the student to adopt a h.ier- archy of values which ·places his group tie~. in a subordin- ate position? And in view of the society in which we live, we must answer, no! Our current society is based most strongly on values derived from a community setting, and although this. situation has its definite disadvantages, the strength of g1·oup ties cannot be lightly discarded. Howevet\ the a::;pect of group ties is not the only rea- son why the adoption of an honor system by Union College \vould be an un\\ise Sttep. For a second question must now arise: Does an honor system necessarily promote the value of honesty? Once again our answer must be negative. An honor system is based not so much upon a prevailing at- mosphere of honesty as it is upon the maintenance of a highly rigid and individualistic code of honor. The terms of the system leave little room for choice. A man is obli· gated b()th to act \vith honesty and to promptly report any violations of honesty he might see committed by others. This is his code of honor; this is his pledge. Thus what the honor system is actually attempting to do is to translate a set of highly individualistic, rigid, and romantic values, i.e., a code of honor, into a highly prag- matic and t·elativistic society. The honor system is a product of the South. Its two greatest proponents, Prince- ton and the University of Virginia, are well kndWn for their strong Southern components. The system was estab- lished in the 19th century under a Southern culture reek- ing with romanticism and the \code of honor of the gen- tleman.\ The honor system, then, is based primarily on a tradi- tion of the past which finds itself hard-pressed when ap- plied to a modern setting. And because the honor system is b:rscd on \\:.tlucs from tlw pn--t (inoiviilnality, rone of honor), it cannot work in the Union College of t()day. A. basic fallacy of many observers has been to confuse the importance of the system with the importance of the values. The objective we must seek is a shift in values which will cause the student to accept \honesty\ for its intl·insic good. For since a system, rather than changing values is actually dependent upon them for success, we are approaching the problem from the wrong direction when we talk of changing the system. We must first attempt to change the values and then, once the values have been altered, the s~·stem will change to preserve the new values.

I FOR CAR TROUBLES SEE A UNION MAN I I I I William H., Plath : The faculty is approximately evenly divided regarding the hin- derance presented to an honor system by the fraternity system. Some believe that ties of friend- ship would. be just as great a hin- derance. However, others wrote that loyalty to the fraternity would make the system less ef- fective. A majori'ty of the repli- ant professors felt that if a fresh- man reported someone fqr cheat- ing, his chances of entering a fra- ternity would be considerably re- duced. Several stated that this was a sad comment on our pres- ent moral state. Faouliy Divided on Morality The faculty was divided into two, relatively unequal, strongly opinionated: groups regarding the present moral state of the coun- try. The majority felt, as did Professor Esteves that the \busi- ness above all\ principle is coi'- rupting American morals to the very bottom. However, just as many agreed with Professor Graves who wrote, \where is the evidence that we were so all-fired moral in the past? Let us look at history as history is-not selec- tively.\ Professor Lambert ex- pressed an opinion apparently un- ique among the faculty. He said ''this question assumes the ex- istence of moral standards in the nation in cases where there is a financial consideration and where the question involved is not one of pure legality. I doubt the nation as a whole has had such standards in my lifetime, though a minority probably has had.\ Many See Changing Standards The large part of the faculty of Union College believe that moral standards are changing and possibly dropping throughout the nation. Almost every one of them feel it desirable to establish an honor system on the campus but at least half feel that it is pres- ently unfeasible. Many feel that it can be established sometime in the future, but only when an in- stitutional tradition is developed and possibly when the Influence of fraternities is reduced. The majol'ity believes that most stu- dents do not cheat or plagiarize in any way. But they also be- lieve that the average student would not report someone else for cheating, even when a pledge had been signed. • BEST CIRCLES A11to Service 1 , \ BASS weejuns $15.95 • On city streets, along coun- try lanes - wear Bass Wee- juns.

It reader. was never a problem to me to re- Abbott: P~rhaps it would be workable to establish an honor system without tho requirement that the observer n:ame names. (I am not at all sure that it would be workable-this is merely an idea that I have not explot\ed thor- oughly-but it might be worth thinl\ing about.) A possible al- ternative would be to require that a student who had observed cheat- ing or plagiarism report that fact and describe the nature of what he had observed but without iden- tifying any student or students by name. This requirement would be much less likely to be evaded. It would at least give the admin- istrators of the honor system grea-ter confidence in knowing, for example, the number of exams in which the honot\ system was being respected. Bacon: Students are essentially honest. In fairness to the honest student there should be some form of supervision to protect him from cases of dishonesty which are bound to exist in large classes of competing lower-class students. In upper\classes an honor sys- tem should have a reasonable chance of success. Butzel: Student desire for such a system must be very strong with the full understanding of the meaning of the system in terms of responsibility to abide by all the rules. Perhaps starting with a fresh- man class It could be worked up to all four years. Starting with a fulJ.-scale program with no time for indoctrination might be dis- astrous. People need to be edu- cated to be willing to abide by all the rules of the system! Fra- ternities also must show a strong stand and desire to have the sys-· tem, including the very difficult (to them) fact that one has a higher obligation to one's college than he do.es to his fraternity. Gobie: The import_ant point to me is that under an honor system I can act as if I have trust in, and respect for, my students. I will not have to be in the degrading position ·Of distrusting everyone. I hope that the realization of this atmosphere of trust and cgnfi- dence will have more influence for an honest behavior than the frain from cheating in an exam- ination, .but it would have been a headache to have felt any re- sponsibility for what other stu- dents were doing. In addition to the legitimate reporting of violations I would expect considerable grief might be caused by claims of cheating which could not be propedy sub- stantiated. I can think o..f. noth- ing more distressing than being falsely accused of cheating wheth- er one is eventually exonerated or not, Hoffm.an: I would like to see an honor system tried at Union, knowing full well that this will surely make it easier for the per- ennial c)J.eaters to. cheat. Reason: To live under an honor system is to have an opportunity for self- growth that should be denied none. .All our adult life we es· sentially live under such a sys- tem. Let's get used to it in col- lege. The ones that defect will do so anyway, some way or other, in any system: America as a whole should be a better place if yeo pled by honor system grad· uates. Lambert: I feel establishment of an honor system at Union would be successful under only two conditions: 1. That a large majority of stu- dents value such a system more highly than any shibboleth of sup- posedly gentlemanly conduct. 2. That the college adminis· tration be willing to see students dismissed for any infraction of the system. Lowen: Th~ principle of the honor system is the only right course. However, it's implimenta- tion cannot be legislated. First the proper attitude must be es- tablished, and I don't mean mor- als (I assume they have been established in the home), I speak of the craving grades.

Believes Cayer's Chances Are Good With less than two weeks to go before the opening game ~f th~ 195~-~0 .basketball season, Varsity Coach Carl Witzel rs optimistic about the teams overall chances for another winning season.®•~---­ He is convinced, however, that his charges, who are scheduled to face a Decem- ber 2 opener at Middlebury, have a long way to go be- fore the first ba:ll is tossed. Even thoug!h there are five holdover lettermen, including last year's regulars Chuck Marshall, CHUCK MARSHALL Mike Bluestein, and Ken Hoyt, Witzel has declared the manpower situation to be wide open. \Right now, I couldn't start to pick a team although I've got a pretty good idea of what most of my players can do,\ said the new court mentor who replaced Tom Gartmill as head man of the Gar- net cage aggregation. MarshaJ.l, Bluestein, and Hoyt, plus 6-6 Max Steele, who saw q-uite a bit of action .in the second :half of the last season, and Bruce Walsh form a sol·id nucleus of ex- perienced players. Several mem- bers of last year's freshman team will be on hand to bolster the upperclass talent. Witzel has -installed a new of- fense thit> ~>'Cason which stresses j continuity and pallei n·type .ball I which\ revolves about a single pivot post, and will use man-to- maa defense in lieu of the zone, that ha.s become so popular in t'he college game today. Backcourt Weak Spot ··we're definitely hurting in the backcourt where we must replace Frank Crum and Bill Mather,\ said the coach. He singled out Walsh as one of the possible re- placements a,.nd said that Pelton, who is back in action after a year away from the court game, will be a great help in the backcourt situation. \I have been running tlhiee . units, but I have never matched the teams up the same way more than one time,\ he explained. \This has given me a chance to look at all the players under al.l condi- tions .. \This team has plenty of talent and should round into shape;\ he figured. \Time and lots of hard work and practice should do the trick.'' chell and ~hip Nassor.

To this date, approximately 125 students have received loans from this money. National Students Association has temperament, it was a appy mar- l'iage.

Although the faculty agrees al- most tu a man that the Dlsdauucr Oath is nut ju,;t, it follows two ::;chuuls of thought. 'College Has il'o Right One, lead by Professors Way and Bacon ::;ays that since the college i:> only an agent tu give the loan, It has nu right tu dec1de whether or nut to make the muncy available to the student. Pro- fessor Bacon stated \I don't feel that the faculty should legislate something that is up to the stu- dent in principal, however I per· sonally do not approve in this case since the average student is not able to 1·ecognize the over- all implications of what he is signing.\ In other words, thest' professors feel that since the stu- dent is the one who i~ ~igning the oath, it is his choice to analyze his convictions before signing it. The other school of thought i::; led by Professor Larrabee, who originally introduced the resolu- tion to the faculty. He feels that the college as the agent of the loan is the one to decide how its provisions may agree or disagree with its ideals and traditions and to act accordingly. In Union's case, as in t-he case of the other schools, the faculty thinks that the student should not be forced to reaffirm his ba::;ic innocence before himself. h!s countrymen and before God. Repeal Pledge . . o less government officials, write to the congressmen and get things done the right way. Th~ rule has also been termed a \violation of the academic free- dom of the student and the in- stitution he attends.\ Th<>re is also a political aspect to the eagerness of Senator Ken- nedy for the repeal to be approved on the second try, as suggested QY Morse. The Senator, a hopeful presidential candidate in 1960. has only one blemish on his record, only one bill given his support that did not pass-that bill being the first attempt at repeal. This mark would be elirninated should repeal be passed on his next at- tempt, and thus would give Sena- tor Kennedy a clean slate on his drive toward the White House. The National Defense Education Act itself, however, has proven to be a boon to many institu- tionti. Calvin G. Schmidt, Union's Director of Student Aid comment- ed, ''A great many lesser-endowed colleges that previously could give very little financia.l aid or none at all were placed in a much- improved position. Even Union has benefitted highly. Without government aid, our loan funds would have been so depleted by 1961, that there could have been a d!\astic 'reduction in student loans when that year arrives if government funds would not be available. On the other hand, Oberlin, Harvard, and Yale have already retut·ned the money, re- fusing it because of the principle involved. ----0---- Fox In Chapel possibly disloyal citizen his edu- Professor Sherwood Fox describ- cation would only serve to con- the aims of the Union College Soc- firm his disloyal tendencies, ial Research Center and the whereas they might well he halted projects which have materialized if he wel\'e permitted to obtain under the Center's program at an education.

That he wrote several appropriately ~ ull tomes desct\ib- ing his finds shows that his mo- tiveti were at least partly altl'llis- tic. Such a brief summary ca)l only hint at the personality of thi::; tyrannical financier whose pdvate life was a tangle of irrational fears and compulsions, and yet who accomplished more than most saner men. Schliemann's p!'odigious energy is indicated by the heavy corre- spondence he carried on all his life, always writing in the lang- uage of the addressee and always making a handwritten copy of each letter. Fortunately, though probably owing only to a lack of time, Payne, who turns out an average of three of four books a year, has resisted the temptation to ap- proach his subject in the overtly psychoanalytic and inevitably in- competent manner of many mod- ern biographers. By neither over-analysing nor idolizing him, Payne exposes the pathos in Schliemann's life while letting us admire his ambition and ability.

Murphy: An honor system at Union would be an ineffective remedy, since it would attack the wrong disease. Union must de- velop into a dedicated liberal arts and science which holds learning in high regard, and must inculcate in its· students a sincere respect for knowledge and thought as ends in themselves. The first step would be abolition of the fratern- ity system lock, stock, and bar- rel. The second would be a firm attitude towards students caught cheating, i.e., automatic expulsion.
