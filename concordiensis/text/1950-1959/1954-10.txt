Am- herst carires a large squad of ap- proximately fifty-five men and boasts the two complete teams that carried them through ali arduous season without a defeat. There iB experience and depth at virtually every position of the squad. In Saturday's triumph over Colby, the Lord Jeff's displayed little passing, -throwing seven, and completing two. However, this was offset by the power shown, both inside, by quick halfback drives, and outside, through end sweeps. Starting Lineup The Garnet starting eleven will consist of left end, Gregory; Left tackle, McMahon or Allen; left guard, Rudolph; Center, Mattie; right guard, Guerra; right t!).ckle, Huntington; right end, Havill. Reed will be at quarterback, Medei at left-half, Feldmaier at right.half, and Lounsbury at fullback. The left tackle spot is in doubt, due to a slight brain concussion that John McMahon suffered against Vermont. He has been kept out of all contact work during the weelt, and his starting on Sat- urday is still in doubt. Wodarzalt, the right half back, suffered an inju1·y i nscrimmaging, and did not play against Vermont. As he has yet to don a uniform, he prob- ably will not play against Amherst. Also slated to see considerable action on Saturday are ends Sawyer and Martucci; tackle, Mc- Donough; guards, Shepard and McGregor; and Kimmel at center. In the backfield, there is Crotty, as quarterback, and Reynolds, Mc- Dermott, and D' Aiello. Although the Garnet squad will enter Saturday's contest as under- dogs, Coach Hammerstrom feels that the squad stands a gdod chance of upsetting the Lord Jeffs if they play the game they are cap- able of playing\ Rathskeller Opens After the Vermont game a changed Rathskeller was opened to the public. During the summer a group of students under the direc- tion of Mr. Thomas Strad€r, refer- ence librarian, spent four hundred dollars renovating the student hangout by giving the inside a new coat of paint. According to James Brown, gen- eral manager of the Rathskeller; improvements including a new juke box, better refrigeration, and a dishwasher are planned depending on student support and future pro- fits. This year, Bob Penny holds the post of business manager, and Bill Mathews is the purchasing agent for the organization. Those interested in working at the Rath- skeller should contact Don Mc- Kibbon, personnel manager.

In the past two weeks you have been engag-ed in the crazy whirl which we call rushing. You have been invited to meals, patties, football games, nnd picnics. Litemlly speak- ing you have not been given a chance to breathe. I, however, am now asking you to stop at the e.nd of this rushing period and THINK. To the Editor of the Concordiensis: There appeared in last week's Goncordy an ectitoria~,.,by one of y(JUr reporters that is very mis- leading. Mr. Shucard has made some re- ma;ks about Independents that may perhaps be interpreted as be- ing satirical, but at the same time, · a person could very easily be mis- led by these statements, especially a freshman who .is about to make an important decision in his life- \Should I join a fraternity or not?\ Mention is made in Mr. Shu- card's article of \~little men who d(m't (join fraternities). They are snubbed in a hundred little ways. They are pegged as introverts and lo.oked. upon as outcasts.\ There are people who. come to Union to study, and for no other- purpose. They are so wrapped up in their work that they are not active in extra-curricular activities. These people, because of their na- You must first decide for yourselves-Do I want to j.oin ture, usually remain Independents. a fraternity?

But the purpose of this letter is not to debate or compare the rela- tive merits of fraternity life vs. non-fraternity life; that is entirely an individual matter. The purpose of this letter is to show, as errone- ously pointed out last week, that an Independent is not necesarily, nor should. he be, looked upon as an outcast, introvert, or jerk-ball non-conforming squirt.

From the Editors Notebook • IS OUR FACE RED This past \reek the Iluuse P1esidenb Council voted to buy pom-poms fo1· distribution to our reutrning alumni. After discovering that these would be too costly Bill Shaw President of the Council changed the order to wa\'e sticks for the football game. After placing the order he then learned that the company had an-anged to send wavers of multi-colored crepe papet. A call to New YDl'k and this was changed so that the alumni would 1·eceive garnet and white wavers. This evening Mr. Shaw was infonned that it was impossible to send the garnet and white wavers but that the company had sent red and white wavers fm· our alumni to cheer on our eleven in their traditional game with R.P.I. RADIO GIVEN THE AIR One of the most thankless activities on this campus oc- cupies the office next to ours in Washburn Hall. WRUC has always had its troubles. First, they have constantly sought to maintain a staff of men large enough and experi- enced enough to handle a radio station. Second, they have received nothing but laughter at their efforts, for it is com- mon knowledge that WR UC has probably the lowest listener rate than any licensed radio station in the country. This attitude on the part of most students is totally unjustified. The station has in the past aand will continue, I am sure, to present many fine hours of listening if we would bother to turn their way. Among this entertainment I would list \Twenty Questions\ and the broadcast of away athletic contests. This latter has always been one of the more enjoyable and worthwhile functions of the radio station. I know that many men were extremely interested in the Amherst Foot- ball game this past week-end. WRUC had counted on the broadcast of this game to gain headway with the freshman das;,; both by way of a listening audience and to interest fresh talent in the radio 1-'tation. It is now understood thai the radio station had planned tu broadca,.,t tllb game and llatl approached lhe Tax Com- mittee on the suuject asking for their approval of this plan, which had been a past function of the station, in the form of seventy five <lolbrs to pay for the rental of the telephone lines to handle the game. The_y \Yere refused. The Tax Committee is running at a deficit and is certain- ly making a very fine attmpl to shave their lmdg·et to co- incide with their present as;-;cb. nut they did nut make a wise choice when they chose to make this broadcasting of away gamel'l the victim of their shavings. They did this, in fact, nt a time when the sUttion had the prospects of a sponsor for these evenis. At the present time WRUC is not at all sure of their sponsor. Had the Tax Committee granted the usual permis- sion for the broadcasts of away games, this one at least, we might have found the radio station not only paying for this event, but actually adding a slll'plus which would have meant less financial aid by the committee to the station. We hope that the station will be able to sign this sponsor in time for this coming week's contest at Rochester; we doubt if they will. If they don't or if their negotiations fall through completely we think that the udio voice of Union has eamed and deserved the permission to present the program which has been of tremendous help to th eactivity in the past. ACTING UP With the leaving of Donald Jones last May, there came from many quarters a feeling· of alarm that the Mounte- banks, which had recently been reactiviated, would once more fall by lack of support and interest. Such has pleasant- ly not been the case. The Mountebanks under the direction this year of Clif- ford Wingate have shown themselves to be a substantial organization.

(Reading time: 45 seconds) Here Don Garland makes noise distribution measurements with a Level Distribution Recorder \M - y job is to help solve problems of noise and other interference on tele- phone lines due to power interference. Inductive co-ordination is the technical term for\ the work. \First thing the Chief Engineer ex- plained to me was tl1at 'all the an;;wers aren't in the hook.' He was right. Most of the problems have required a com- bination of electrical engineering, a knowledge of costs and generous amount of ingenuity. I like it that way. It's given me an immediate opportunity to put into practice the theory I learned at school. ~'In addition to this on·the-job ex- perience, I have attended several spe- cial training courses conducted by the company. Now I'm breaking in a new man, just like when I started.\ • • • Don Garland's work is typical of many engineering assignments in the Bell Telephone Companies, There are simi- lat• opportunities for college g~•aduates with Bell Telephone Laboratories, Western Electric and Sandia Corpora• tion ..

'The passport arrived the From the Editors ·Notebook A HOLLOW HONOR Tuesday marks the opening of another in a long series of Frosh-Soph Rivaky Weeks at Union. They tell us that not too many years ago this was quite a big thing on cam- pus and only one 11art of an extensive rivalry that b~gan the day the fl·osh first set foot on the college grounds. T1mes have changed and so have the moods and manners of Union men. Cane and tomato fights of the early 1900s have been replaced by an organized program that runs the gamut from touch football to chess. Many of the familiar touches that this weekend's visito1·s may remember from their years at Union have been altered to fit the day. When we were freshmen we read in our handbooks of a \traditional Tug~of- ' d \ AI th' . t War over the brook that boun s. as, IS 1s no more.

I New Heat Engines Laboratory Marks Addition To Coll~g!e Plant Thirsty? ~· : HE.RSHEY\4 . · QUARTZ CRYSTALS How a 1 1 /4 hour ~~gem-cutting\ operation became an 8-minute mechanized job PROBLEM: Preparing quartz crystals for use as electronic frequency controls calls for the highest degree of precision. So much so, in fact, that prior to World War II skilled gem-cutters were employed to do the job. ·But during the war, there were not enough gem-cutters to keep up with the demand for crystals in radar, military communications and other applications. Western Electric tackled th~ job of building into machines the skill and precision that had previously called for the most highly skilled opera tors. SOLUTION: Here is how quartz crystals are made now- by semi-skilled labor in a fraction of the time formerly required: A quartz stone is sliced into wafers on a reciprocating diamond-edged saw, after determination of optical and elec- trical axes by means of an oil bath and an X-ray machine. Hairline accuracy is assured by an orienting fixture. The wafers are cut into rectan~les on machines equipped with diamond saws. The human element is practically elim- inated by means of adjustable stops and other semi-automatic features. The quartz rectangles are lapped automatically to a thiclmess tolerance of plus or minus .0001\. A timer prevents overlapping. Finally, edges are ground to specific length and width dimensions on machines· with fully automatic micro- feed systems. Most of these machines were either completely or largely designed and de- veloped by Western Electric engineers. RESULTS: With skill l>uilt into the machines-with costly hand operations eliminated- this Weste1·n Electric mech- anization program raised production of quartz crystals from a few thousand a year to nearly a million a month dtiring the war years. Th:is is just one of the many unqsual jobs undertaken and solved by Western Electric engineers. Quartz stones are cut into wafers on this dia- mo_nd-edged saw, with orientation to optical axzs co. ntrolled b;t {iX~/klie.

A member of the faculty for the past six years, Professor Morley spent the .period from 1950 to 1952 in Japan on a Social Science Re- search Council Felolwship. While in that country, he conducted re- search in the archives of the Japanese fot:eign ministry and the principal university libraries. and also found time to speak before student groups in the leading uni- versities. His kno\\:ledge of Japan- ese affairs last year resulted in his appointment to the Subcommittee for Liaison with Japanese Scholars, a functioning body of the An:erican Council of Learned Societies.

The Brown Memorial Cup This week will mark the presentation of the Stephen Brown Memorial Trophy. Stephen Brown, a student at Union College and a member of Phi Sigma Delta Fraternity met with fatal injuries in the horrible Long Island Railroad crash a few years ago. His fraternity at that time offered a trophy to the school, in memory of Stephen, to be presented to the highest ranking fraternity on campus. This was a particularly fit- ting memorial, for those who were fortunate enough to know Stephen Brown held him to be a fraternity brother, in the true sense of the word. Tlfe particulars of the trophy weer worked out over this past year and this coming Tuesday will mark its official presentation. We are all in accord with the yardstick which has been adopted to ward this highest fraternity honor. The administration working with a student group have chosen three qualifications for the trophy and the winner is that house which has made the greatest overall achievements in all of these areas. In our minds the classifications chosen; scholarship, intramurals, and school service, represent some of the higher ideals of fraternity living. A fmternity should strive to achieve within the mem- bers an attitude of responsibility concerning the academic work of its members at colleg. Certainly this should be one of the first considerations in the award. You are living together in the house and worldng together. Fraternities as a group strive, through play on the athletic field, to devlope the team spirit and cooperation which will lead to success. I believe that intramurals here are a fine program and are worthwhile. The success of a fraternity in intramurals stressing this cooperation should also be an factor in the Brown Trophy. A fraternity as a functioning body with officers,' and work around the house has often forgotten its responsibili~ ties on the campus. They cry for school activities and then in many cases fail to supp(nt them. Activities, and the fra- ternities membe1·s contributions to them, represent one of the most important aspects of college life. This we were glad to see was one of the deciding factors in the presenta- tion of the Brown Cup. We thi:fik that the Brown Trophy is a serious matter and reprsents a good deal in the way of accomplishments to the fraternity so honored by the award. We hope that in- tel'st, which now appears high for the award, will not only remain so ; but will only increase in the yes of the fraternity men on campus. In time such regard for the award will only stimulate student interest in their academic studies intra- murals and services to the school. ' -G.R.K.

'I\he Union-Haverford game, last home game of the season will take place Saturday afternoon. During half- time, the best AFROTC squadron, Squadron B, and the drill team will give a marching exhit>ition, fol- lowed by the presentation of nine· military awards. On Saturday night, there will be the usual number of fraternity parties. The parties are open to all stud€'llts up to about. midnight; then the party is closecl for frater- nity men and their guests.

Katz. The Concordiensis, he pointed qut, has· certainly been hurt by graduations and the failure of many of their freshtrran reporters to integrate within j;he organiza- tion. Another problem, that of an adequate photography staff, was discussed and several -concrete proposals which might aid the or- ganization were brought forward. A motion 'was then entered on the floor ·by Dominick Carboone, Editor of the Idol; it read as fol- lows: that the Pu·blications Board recommend to the Editor of the Concordiensis that Edward Cloos Jr. be dismissed on th€ grounds of unethical and ungentlemanlike be- havior in regard to his recent column. Votes Cast The n-.otion wtas seconded by Donald Pavkovitch, and carried by the board in a close four-three vote.

Columns Wise How far may a newspaper columnist, particularly one on a college newspaope1·, go in commenting upon or criticizing the scene about him'? Does the college writer enjoy the sru:ne privileges held by his brethren on the larger metro- politan dailies, or is he subject to standards laid down by the school administration and student gove111ing bodies? Since the outset of this semeste1·, the Concmdiensis has met with repeated attacks from all elements or coilegP sociPty concern- ing the writing of two such columnists. In this issue we have published a letter from a. member of the Publications Board and a report on that gt·oup's meeting of Tuesday, both dealing with the censure of our Feature Editor. Have his ·writings merited a recommendation of his dismissal by the Publications Board, ot· are they of a nature that expresses the definite opinions (Jf one student as pre- sented under his byline and therefore open to answer, argu- ment, and questiop. lJy his con temporaries in the same pages? We choose the latter viewpoint. l\lany of those who have been most vehement in their criticisl1'1 have preferred to let their dissatisfaction remain \vithin oral bounds outside of the hearing of the person most concerned in this matter, the columnist. To date, the Concordien::>is has !'eceived three letters on the subject. 'One 'nts a poem that strove to satirize the poetry of :\II·. Cloos in a previous issue; the second, a lette1· from an anonymous Delpl1ic who chided what he thought to lJe a lack of prepa1·ation and failure to obtain the facts in all cases discusser!: and t l1e third, l\Ir. Carbone's lette1· printed in this issue. Thn:::; one person out of the entire student body and facultr of l'n ion has actually chosen to go beyond the hound;; of debate and to ask for dismissal. What has our Feature Editor \Vritten tlli::; semestel\ that is of such an olJjectionable nature'? In :mccessiYe issues, he has used as his su!Jjects: fra temiti t>s, chapel, the bookstore, Paul Durlin, and finally the fidd house, cmd Jim Dro\\'n. His critics feel that his rPnl<ll ks Pll :\lr.

Brov.,11 or :\Jr. Carbone, two of the most active and h:mle::;t W(Jrking memLers of the student body, in this category. Othe1·s have suggested that the Editor of Concordiensis is personally responsible for the views outlined by the news- paper's columnists. He is to temper their opinions and to lead them on a path that will in essence reflect all that is good about us. But all is not good, 2nd the worst is reflected in censorship. \Ve should not tole1·ate this at any time, whether at a student, editorial, Ol' administrative level. -J.I.H. Bouquet The announcement in this issue of a posthumous show- ing of the art of David CohC'n, brings to us a call for con- gratulations to Professor John Bradbury. The long list of constantly improving· shows which have hung in Old Chapel Gallery since Dr. Bradbury came to the Fine Arts depart- ment here, serve dramatically as testimony to the work he has done. Last year Old Chapel saw a full schedule of exhi- bitions which we all enjoyed .wl1ile probably never stopping to think of the man hhind \the boards.\ Dr. Bradbury had,- alone, to arrange for the exhibits and then to transport them from as far as New York City in his own car. All this was done without large appropriations from the College. This year he is Chairman of the new Art department, another of his contributions to Union. Our congratulations and· thanks go to Dr. Bradbury for a job more than well done, and another well begun. E.J. C. Letter to the Editor To the Editor: It is with deep concern that I express myself in a matter to the editors of the Concordlensis and the members of the student body. I ·believe an injustice has been done to an individual, a set of ethics and policy, and the harmony of our college communitY. T-he in- dividual is James BroVI n; the ethics are those of the Concordi- ensis; and the harmony is self- explanatory. The injustice v.as made .by a men •ber ·of the CoueOI•diensis's staff in his unmeditated, slanderous ac- cusatipn against a person and a college function in the suffix of his column, \Tulips and Chimneys.\ The person of this injustice is Mr. Ed·\\ ard Closs, Jr. He has made three seriolll3 n is- takes. ~1) Mr. Cloos has comnutted' a -breacl1 of the ethics of journalism. He has wntten a derogatory al' tack, -based purely upon self-asser- tiOn Vl.ithout anY attempt to BU.b- ~tu.nliat\ Ius r·ernar·l!cs with vu.lid proof, against an inuividual dele- gated to perform a college func- tion. The Delphi-c Soclety under the authority of the Student Coun- CJ!·-the legislative directors of >~lU­ dent acuvrties - has given Mr. Brm' n this delegation. Desipte Mr. Cloos' pensonal, mature feelmgs (a presumption on his part), this petty childishness of rivalry, as he .be- lieves it to be, is a. duty of \\.rr. Brown's and not necessarily the direct v.ishes of the asignee. Mr. C!oos' accusations, if · grounded, should be directed at the proper bodies. (2) Mr. Cloos has used an un- conventional use of the editoria;l \we\ as an expression of Concordi- ensis' policY and not one of per- sdnal pathos. I am confident th:at the eoncordiensis lends its f-ull support to campus funct\ons Vl·hether it be Delphics, Student Council or other groups wjaich have the expressed desire ·of promoting the best for Union College. · (3) Mr. C!oos is in very bad taste to accuse a person of imbecility, by being a so-called \fool or tending to folly, by being a \.perennial sophomore.\ These are nastY terms for any student to attach to a .fel- low student in a pwblic statement. These, Mr. Cloos, tend to be libel- oUtS. Freshmen orientation has a1ways been good fun on everyone's part. It is not below· anyone's state-of- mind to take an acti'Ve part in the met·rymaldng. This pretention of sophisticated maturity on the part of the accused is to me a sign of petty rashness. His gibberish reve\ lations of a\'ll1nt-gard-ism. etc., are nonsensical verbiage exerr oplifying a self-infatuating individualism which he deems :with hauteur. Jim Brown has given to the col- lege valuable· service. Just in a f<:>~· rr'llnths of this semester, he has accomplished more than manY of us do in .our four years at Union. Student Dircctoi• of Frosh Ca!t>p, Chairman of Frosh Orientation Committee, General Managpr of Dutchrr•an's Rathskeller, Business Manager of the IDOL, are some of his most outstanding contributions to student activities. His personal qualities havE' 'been friendly, help- ful, and at all times, conscientious. Therefore, I •would like to see the following accomplished: (1) Immediate dismissal of Mr. Cloos as a rPprPSPntatiV£' or mem- ber of the Conl'ordipnsis for .u.n- ethical and ungentlemanlike ap- proach to this issue. (2) A note of apology to Mr. BrD'wn by Mr. Cloos expressing- a sincere desire to be pardoned for this error. (3) A staterr•ent of offical .policy ·by the Editor of the Concordiensis regarding tradition at Union (in- cluding rivalrY), its application and .promotion. thereby clarifying the previous statements made by Mr. Cloos in the newspaper. Many of the students have laughed off much of what Mr. Cloos has previously written, .but many of us believe that he has overstepped the bounds of personal authoritY in this matter, and there- fore, should not be given the oppor- tunity to commit an even more serious blunder.

Outside \f the na- tional political stadium, the honor- able Irvrng Ives began roasllng chestnuts to Vlatm up a cold and dead campaign. Of course the real reason for this GOP flurry is probably the old axiom -that the party in power looses congressional seats in the off-year ·balloting, and especially VI hen its regular voters appear apathetic, as Republican diehards have done this year. Somehow, the Republican crowd, VI hile exciting, isn't very appealing · to me. I like Ike, fishing, golf, and Willy Mays, but the rest of the elephant VliQrshippers are a very# strange menagerie.

And then, too, has Dick Nixon introduced his pet pup of 52 fame to Mr. Wilson, the SecretarY of the Hunt.

4 FRIDAY, OCTOBER 29. 1954 Flying Club- Boasts 4:3 Dav~d pohen Members After 5 Years Exhtbtt In . . Old Chapel Dr .J osephFinkelsteinNamed Union Alumni Review Editor :<\\W.'·.:.,.- ·. One of the FlyingClub's two Aeronca Champions In 1948 the Union College Flying Club was founded. h·y three retu~ing Air Force veterans to help Union students learn how to fly. Two of the founders-Roger Story an<l Steve Isr.ael-are still active in th~ Club, the fonner actin.g as official mechanic. President \Bill\ Corwith pointed out that the total cost of obtaining a license through the Flying Club is about $175. The requirements for a l!lcense are at le-ast eig'ht hours of dual-controlled flying before a solo flig-ht, followed by five more hours of dual-controlled cross- country flying. Twenty-five solo hours and fifteen dual hours is the total air time needed before a test may be ta.ken. The first class of piloting a novice can be is private pilot-he may do any type of fly- ing other than for hire. Tlu-ough the Club, Union students can rent a plane for $5.50 an hour for dual-cootrolled, which includes a. fully-)icensed instructor, and $2.50 per bout\ for solo. These rates are comparable to twelve and eight dolLars, respectively, commercial rates. Now the membership is forty- three, which includes seven private pilots, one co=ercial pilot, and four sol<> pilots, with nine more ex- pecting their solo licenses by the end of N<>vember. The Club has two Aeronca Champions, although one is now in the midst o.f a com- plete overhaul. Even if both were in the air, there would be little more tine for instructions. Neither of the t\wo- instructors, Bill Leng and Lane McDaniels, has any free time next week, or the coming three weekends.

One ·of the major art events of the cun·ent school season, an exhibition of the works of the late David Murray Cohen '45, will open at the Old Chapel gallery on Sunday, October 31. Cohen, a native New Yorlr-er. achieved international recognition before his untimely death in 1953. As an artist, his interest in subject matter was varied~still life, mar- .ines, landscapes, etc.-and, although he was exposed to European tech- niques, he retained his individual- ity in the handling of these sub- jects. Particularly noted in Fran.ce were his eye for color and the rich surface and e~otion of his ran- . vases. · Shortly aiter graduating from Union in 1945 with a degre-e in Economics, Mr. CohE>n developed and patented the Kone Fe:rrule, a new kind of umbrella tip which he sold to manufacturerS'. He ·had begun studying art under Howard Pa:ssel, as well as at .the Art Stu- ·dents League in New York, but it was only after his visit to France, following his marril!-ge in 1948, that he developed the serious interest in · painting that was to inspire his life. While hi Paris, his energy, irn• agination and intelligence seemed to have served him well, for he won early recognition from critics <md fellow artists. His first exhibit, a. one-man showing of 24 canvases in the Gailerie Sa!nt-Placide, Paris, terminated only nine months of study abroad, an honor not often · bestowed on such a young artist.
