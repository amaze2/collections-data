When Wails Grow Grey Today, under the directitm of the Sh~dent Council, ?e- gan the first real Cndergraduaie-Alumm Fund campmgn that the college has undertaken. Several com!llt=;nts have been made questioning the role that the c?un~Il 1~ assum- ing in backing, directing, and, in effect, mst1~adtmdg such a drive. Althottgh Union College does pay form ee more than half of each student's education (excluding· all forms of scholarship aid g·iven) should her undergraduates, who for the most part are financially dependent, 'be ex::pe~~ed to o-ive to an alumni fund'! If so, should the responsibility of ~uch a drive be assumed lJy the Student Council? \No Wonder We Need More Dormitory Space\ In answering, let us state that we feel the purposes of the drive to be several. F'irst, Wells House l!eports that an averao·e of 52r(; of Union's alumni donate annual gifts to the college. I; comparison to a 73~o averag-e f?und in many colleges of otu· class (Dartmouth and Hamilton to mention two) om· record could stand improvement. If, however the college should boast that near 100% of the student Lody has contributed to the Alumni Fund, even if merely a token contribution, would not our alumni feel a greater obligation to Union? Perhaps mo1·e important, it is hoped that every Union student will, upon g-raduation, become a regular contrib- utOl' to the Alumni Fund. A certaiw·amount Qf \condi- tioning\ is necessary in establishing the custom of giving to one's college, ··conditioning,\ however, which cannot be interpreted in the mere Pavlovian sense of the term. Union College, we feel, possesses an organic identity of its own, and seen in this light, the te1·m Union College then becomes an all-inclusive one, encompassing each individual who passes through its halls. Enough has been said concerning the function of fra- ternities on our campus. We have heard the opinion that in many instances, loyalty to one's fraternity occupies a position above that of loyalty to one's college, especially where alumni are concerned. In the Undergraduate- Alumni Fund campaig11, we see an opportunity to destroy this notion. In addition to belonging to frate:mities, stu- dents can active!~, demonstrate their loyalty to, and con- cern fm·, their college, Both institutions can, and should, exist on the same campus, without one institution being in any way detrimental to the other. ---- Polemically Speaking By St('phPn CoopPr Non-directwe education is one of the few institutions at Union which does not sti1· apathy. Based on the theory that a person will not leam what he is not inter- ested in, it does away with a for- mal syllabus and allows class discuss\Ion to roam wide, while encourag-ing students to take up independent study topics \v·hich interest them. Merit in Non-Direction The usual argument against non-directive teaching is that it is educationa.Jly unsound and worthless. Wh'ile there may be some who take advantage of the non-directive methods, there is a strong possibility that there is merit, if not great merit, in this unusual system of education. <Un- ion's 56 courses are non-direction \'ita prestige.) Besides the pos- sible educational advantages, it may ·be noted that non-directive teaching is valuable as one of the few experiments in education at Un'ion. The main argument against non-direction, therefore, is not educational. It is primarily di- rected against the administration of the course, part'icularly in re- lat1on to the normal concept of a cout•se in relation to higher edu- cation jn America. A course title -a normal course title, that is- means something when it is read by people outside Un'ion. It means that a certain minimum of under- standing may be presupposed of a certain student for a certain area of knowledge. But non-directive courses acre not normal courses, and they should not be hidden under normal nacm-es. The wide range of class discussion does not lend itself to be categm!ized under one .particular title. In some instances the same course title is given to two sec- tions of a course, one being non- directive, with there being no re- lation between the two sect'ions other than the title. A mot·e ludi-crous situation arises when a person may go through Union college taking a few non-directive classes with different titles, and each time taking the same course! Ab.olition No Solution Abolition of this method of edu- cation is not a solution 'because of the possibility mentioned above of there ·being mer'it in the sys- tem. What should be done is that the course be publicized fot· what it is-an experimental de- parture from the normal method of conducting classes. Graduate schools should know what to ex- pect from applicants. The trans- cript should contain some note that a course is being taught in a non-directive manner, or the title of the course sho1+-ld jn·dicate exactly what the subject matter is. Any other method is plain misrepresentation. Union's ·Library Examined By Leslie Mari\Us In conclusion, we wish to commend the Student Coun- cil for their undertaking. In our opinion, no better organ- ization could have assumed the res:ponsibilities of such a project, and launch a drive with so successful an ap-pear- ance. We urge 100% student participation in the Under- g·rdauate-Alumni Fund campaign, Conflict The Concordiensis has often taken issue with Union's compulsory chapel program. Although we still feel that compulsory chapel is an unnecessary and unneeded aspect of campus life we have resigned ourselves to the fact that ch.apel in some form is like taxes, \here to stay.\ The early history of Nott Me· A few years before Dt•.

When pe1·sons of national or international l'enown visit our cam- pus, as they do none too often, they should be ex:tended the honor of lecturing- before the student body at noonday chapels. Although chapel scheduling, of necessity, is decided upon weeks in advance, we feel that programs sponsored by members of the College Community can, and should, be postponed in favor of visiting lecturers of imp<Jrtance. Next Tuesday, December 9, Simcha Pratt, Is1·ael's Consul General to the United States, will be on campus. He is slated to speak that evening, in competition with the Tri-City Symphony. (See story, page one.) The Schenectady Museum-Union College Concert. Series is an established, albeit new, tradition on campus, and, in our opinion, a worthy one. We regret that, in ac- cordance with the laws of physics we are prohibited from attending both functions. Interior of Union College Library; card catalogue files shown. A simple solution would have been to schedule Mr. Pratt at the noonday chapel. The only complication would be in rescheduling the Campus Chest auction. That t'he auction is an interesting and valuable means of raising money for a wor1;,hy cause can not be denied; it would be of little inconvenience to move it to another date, however. Were T!les4ay's program conflict an exceptional case the ConcordiensiS would not labor the point. In IUany in- sta~ces, however visiting dignitaries are slighted :by being demed access to the noonday chapel ,podium. If the situation were unavoidable the matter woul<! be only unfortunate. The Concordiensis suggests that this is not an unavoidable situation. campus, has an origin far remote from its present use. Originally planned as a memorial to Eli· phalet Nott, the idea for its use as a library was not conceived until considerably later in its his- tory. In 1870, Dr. E!iphalet Nott Pot- ter <-President 1871-1884 and Eli- phalet Nott's grandson) accepted the presidency of Umon College. Upon his arrival on campus he found the foundations of a .structtue whi~ had formed a conspicuous part of the original design for the Union College campus as prepared by Jacques Ramee in 1813. According to one legend the original intention of the library was as a foundation for a statue of Dr. Nott, 20 feet high. and cowls and marching through the city of Schenecta-dy at m'id- night, to flhe music of a funeral dirge. The macabre procession culminated on campus ar<lund the foundations of the Central Build- ing, as a group of mourners around an open grave, where they \Burried the Trustees.\ 'When construction was again begun on the library and the student body saw that the walls were finaliy rising on t}1e Central Building, they organized anot!her proce.'lsion through Schenectady acc()Utered, this time, in sheets and pillow cases and accompanied by the blasts of horns. Back on campus, with great oration and song, the student body proclaimed the \Re- surrection of the Trustees.''

The Concordiensis editorial·l:Joard and staff would like to extend a slightly premature but heartfelt Season's Greetings to the student body, a<lrninistration, faculty and .staff of Union College. Crossing our fingers and sitting on a copy of Miracle Gn 34th Street, we submit a very short list t() good old Santa, who we hope can take enough time out from grind- ing for finals to deliver a few requests. First, of course, must be a new dormitory for the ever increasing number of books whG decide to come to Union College. And please do not forgEt a Student Union for those who (how shall we -ph.rase it) don't like frater- nities. Pocket heaters for all would -also be in order, and m:aybe a copy of the Amherst's plan for deferred rushing and preferential bidding. Dare we be so presumptuous to also request successful 1vinter sports seasons, Santa? And get final exams for students who don't care if they learn anything as long as they are accepted into graduate s'chool? If we could trouble you for one mote item, Mr. Krin- gle, we would be forever grateful Let EVEryone connected with Union College be granted the o]JJ)oTtunity over the holidays to spend a few moments in a thoughtful evalua- tion of the school. And Belated Salutations The Faculty Council last wee1c made permanent the unlimited cut system for juniors. and seniors in good aca- demic standing, subject to depar-tmental rulings. The Concordiensis salutes the Collncil for taking a realistic view of the cut system at Union. We have long felt that college upperclassmen should have enough re- sponsibility to act sensibly when confronted with the op- portunity of not attending classes. \What I seek to do in my paint- ing is to find my humanity,\ stat- ed Paul Brach, whose one man showing is on exhib·it this week in ·Old Chapel. Brach, explaining his communication with the viewer continued, \I first must assume that I am a human heing, and that a basic human level exists in all men. If I can approach that particular trutn whkh is my humanity, then I shall also 'be approaching the same humanity in other men.\ Mr. Brach 1s an artist whose work falls into the classification of to day's most avant garde school of painting, the Abstract-expres.s- ·ionist movement. The twenty works on view show a tendency to search for form more than any other special goal. His earlier paintings of 1951 through 1954 show an at.temJ>t to capture form by means of sh-apes. The can- vases are filled with sometimes 1arge, sometimes small curving shapes done mostly in black and white wit:h a little yellow OJ' blue. sw,ee.ps carry the movement of the paintings. Brach's recent paintings show a greater confid·ence, and hence a greater freedom. The whole form of the painting does not appear at first glance, but as one observes the painting, the colors sta:rt to work togethel', un- til at the l•ast moment, the whole form in motion is discovered. His painting Enfilade, complete<l in 1957, seems to be the transitional work between the constipation of Skirmish and the freedom and excitement of Guardian (the most recent work completed). Use of Oolor As Mr. Brach's paintings are observed, it becomes evident that the a!'tist found less and less a ·ne€d for m·Uch color, thus return- 'ing to some of the con•cepts of his paintings of six and seven yea!'s ago. His present use of -color is more controlled in the sense that it plays togethef hal'- moniously enough to create a symphony of forms which are One of the majo1· sources of ()pposition to the proposal came from those professors who felt that much class time would be lost by explaining to students who were absent from the previous session exactly what was discussed. We hope that pro:fiessors shed their sense of reponsibility for those students who cut excessively. Students who cut must realize that they are doing so \at their own risk.\ The class should not suffer because of the attend•ance infidelity of some of' its members, even though we believe that at- tendance should not be required. Professor Nowack Poses Beside a Brach Original The Concordiensis ho~s that in the near future the unlimited cut system will be extended to soplwmores, and possibly even to second-term freshman. Yet we als<> feel th.at academic quality should not suffer. Chapel Attire Professors Edgar Curtis and Norman Johnson recently brou:ght to the attenion of the Conc01·diensis that some stu- dents are attending evening cha]>el programs in attire un- becoming to the atmosphere of the events. We hope that merely bringing this to the attention of the student body will provide the necess.ary improvements.

Cowsendux I11 1954 Bra.c.h started to use mo!'e color, less black and white, un'l:H in 1955 he .painted Sldrmish and Ar:n1al'l.a with several thick, shol't strokes of h-eavy yellows, reds, blues and greens. Shapes are d'isregarded while the color is highly excited and dashes about the middle of the canvas; the out- side, or background, is a soft white- grey. For me these two paintings are less successful tllan either Brach's earlier, more somber work, or his later, more opened and free paintings. Too Great Tension ThE' failure of Sldnnish and Annada (both of which were in- spired by the bullfight) is that to1> much is happening in too small an area. The colors rush into one another, and even though the background is soft, it does not manage to relieve the too great tens-ion that has ·been cre- ated. The paintings do not lead to a conclusion. Unfortunately space limited the number of paintings that could be shown, hence there is a gap b€twee11 highly composed, tense bullfl~t-inspired paintings and the artist's most recent work. In 1957, with t•houghts aroused by the •impending disasters in France, Jv.'[r, Brach started to use large black shapes reminiscent of the guillotine. His forms ·come from the use of color, rather· than the shape or the figure. The light, .soft hackground -is maintained but soft reds ·in ·broad strong both melodious and stirring to the eye. * * * Mr. Paul Brach, born in New York City In 1924, attended t•he Fieldston .School and then re- ceived '!;loth his Bachelor of 'Fine Att.s and •Master of Fine Arts degree from the State University of I·owa. Since his graduation, he has taught at the University of Missouri, Tbe New School for Soc!.ial Re- search and the Rand School. Presently he is teaching at th-e Parsons School of Design and New York University. His WOI'k has ·been in group shows at the Chicago Art Institute the Museum of Modern Art' the Sidney Janis Gallery, th~ Stable Galle~y. The Tanager Gallery-, and he had a show at Leo Castelli's in 1957. His Wal'k 'is ·!'epl'esented in the col- lections of: St. Louis Museum Of Art, New York Public Li- brary, Olivett College and nu- merous p~iv-ate collections. The present exhibit in Old .Chapel has representative works from 1951 through 1958. Mr. Brach has also been a contributor to Arl Digest and Pictures on Ex- ·hibit. ~a--- From The Amherst Student: \In his recently published twelfth annual Report to the Trustees, Pres. Charles W.

Obviously one of its purposas was 'to show off the French Bar.oque •Organ which has replaced the calli?P.e that former- ly ·bellowed at audiences. For Poulenc's Concerto for Organ, String Orchestra and Timpani, however, a ca;!liope would have served well. A minor critiocism might be made to the effect that it lacked any un'iiy-either in the relationship between .organ and orchestra, or in o·verall conception.

There are only two solutions for this problem. Either the Tri- • City must confine itself to a reper• toire consisting of cha1111ber works,. or add enoug11 ·strings to rectify the trouble.

6 Coci Eminent Within recent years, Miss Coci has risen to a position of emin- ence among the world's organists. She has performed with major symphony orchestras, has given solo recitals from coast to coast, and cla.im.s the distinction of be- ing the first organist of her sex to perform at the U. S. Military Academy. The mother of twin sons, she was widowed in 1951. Union's Christmas Festival is presented each year as a special community service. All portions of the ·program are open to the public without charge. Cha.pPl Cre-dits Given Two chapel credits will be given for the afternoon organ recital, and two for the evening service. The next of the Sunday vespers will come on January 11, when the Reverend Duncan Hl)wlett of the First Church in Boston (Uni- tarian) will be the speaker. ---o Auction ...

Home Life 'Criticized In general, altitudes toward our home life were very critical in condemnation of our disin- tegrating family unit, under the influence of television and other distractions, and the increase of juvenile delinquency. Major con- cern was expressed over the treat- ment of the Negro, and tJhe for- mez· students indicated difficulty in explaining the Little· Hock story. Their only explanation was that Little Rock wouldn't be in the news if the American people, throug·h the Supreme Court, werpn't trying to do somet.b:ing consh'uctlve about racial segrega- tion. Education InfP.rior i\z to cdllcation, it was felt that AmeriCan secondary school grad- uates know far less than their European counte1·p.arts, Jl'articu- laly in the area of languages, lit- tTature, history, science, and ma- thematics, but they also real'zzed •.hat American schools educate a much higher pe!\centage of that age group tha11 do European schools. Wonder was expressed at tihe movies we send to Europe, such as Blackboard Jungle, as a pic- ture of American ·schools. The average European thinks .of Am- erica as the home of the western movie or gangster picture and of rock and roll. \In summary.\ President David- son added. \we felt that although we have given these foreign stu- dents a difficult task to interpret America to Europe, they are do- ing so in a friendly and under- standing fashion. The investment in intemational cooperation is paying off 'in a very unusual way.'' ~·•••••••m••••••••••••~ ft • • • = FOR CAR TROUBLES • : SEE A UNION MAN • • • • • !William H.
