Katz n became known tod~y that the second set of bids f().r the construction of the field 'house was more in line with the administration's estimate of the cost of such a projeet than was earlier supposed. This would place the figut€ of the McKannis Langey and Brockwell bid near the esti- mated $450,000 cost. The above-mentioned firm and one \other were the only contraC!- tovs who subniitted .the bids whicl::t were opened this past Tuesday In New York City. These two firms represented the low bidders of February 26 when the first bids were opened, ·and the adrninistra.- tion at that time asked them to re- evaluate the job to determine whether they could submit a figure which would be in line with earlier college estimates .. Changes in Consb'llction In cutting the cost of construc- tion from. the near $750,000 esti- mate, the~ were necessarily many changes made in the proposed plans for the structure. These changes were thoroughly discussed. among the contractors, architects, and administrative representatives at a recent New York meeting. There is no doubt that the lowe!.\ figure is dependent to a large -ex- tent upon these changes. Tj:le main changes which will be listed here were given to the Con- cordiensis by Mr. Theodore Mc- Ilwaine, who represented the ad- ministration at New York.

It Pays To Advertise The students of Union College went to the polls this pa~t Wednesday to elect their various class officers. It was particularly gratifying to note that there were about 450 votes cast for the presidential nominees. This figure repre- sents 67 percent of the possible 670 votes which could have been cast by the mt>mbers of the three classes participating in the elections. lrtterest in the election was certainly high among the students, but there was in this election the same lack of enthusiasm present among the many men campaign- ing for the offices. Election time recalls to me the hectic campaigning that was so evident in high school, and also at colleges which I was fortunate enough to visit during their polling periods. What has become of the large placards which were displayed in obvious locations to attract the votet·s' attention? Sadly missing are the handouts which are also aimed at winning the votes. I have witnessed many stunts at other campuses, such as loudspeakers and soap box speeches by advocates of many of the candidates. These campaigning measures are seen to .serve a dual function. They obviously bring the names of office seekers to the attention of the voters. They also provide the campaigner with the opportunity of prese?ting h_is q_ualificatio~s ~o t~e voters. The latter is a funct1on wh1ch ts sadly m1ssmg m our present election routine. I cannot imagine how the many candidates presented their qualifications to the stu- dents in this past election. I cannot see how a voter should be expected to cast his ballot without the list of accomplish- ments and qualifications of the candidate. It makes one stop and wonder on what basis we elect our officers. What Union College should have is obviously a revival of candidate activity in electioneering. There .should be, as there is at many schools, a chapel program at which the many office seekers may be introduced to the students,_ and their particular qualifications or programs may be outlined. I must add that at the present time any man who seeks to brinO' his name before the voters is thought of in any but complimentary terms. I was gratified to observe that a few of this year's candidates did dare to encounter the wr~th of the voters bv distributing letters and handouts urgmg men to vote for' them and even stating why this should be done. We have long been striving for a lnrger vote in campus elections, but this vote is absolutely valueless when it is attempted under conditions coming close to absolute ignor- ance. Certainly, any measures undertaken with the express purpose of bringing some knowledge into these dark corners should not be frowned upon by voters but should further be a pl'ime weapon of any candidate. -G. R. K. A Reasonable Facsimile It is our opinion that the Trustees will accept the new bid for the field house this l\Ionday. It is doubtful that the administration would undertake o;uch an action as bringing the matter before the Trustees if they did not feel that the cost of the building would be· a~ceptable. We must remember that in February-'the administration clearly indicated that additional money beyond the original estimate could not be spent on such a project. Now they have made many concessions on their original plan in order to limit the cost of the field house. They appear quite anxious to have it built, and in view of recent events they must be quite satisfied with the latest bid. We feel that the administration is sacrificing a great deal in the accomplishment of their main aim,-to get the field house built. It now appears that we are no longer build- ing a field house for its original purpose, but with the ex- pressed aim of just building any ldnd of field house. The Trustees have not yet decided on the matter. If they do, and they probably will decide favorably, construc- tion is probable for this spring. We are quite sure that they will, however, give the question the serious attention it de- serves. G. R. K. Theater Whirl By R()BERT RICHTER . I entered the Morosco Theater last Saturday night with a mind confused l:>y the existing reviews of T. S. Eliot:s \The Confidentia:l Clerk.\ I left with a mind equally, if not more confused. Some had called the play a farce; others, a typical Eliot masterpiece, conceived with inspiration, wr,itten with a m1aster's pen, and put together as conclusively as the pieces of a completed jig-saw puzzle. In truth, I cannot agree with eitller ()of these analyses. Doubtless, I am influenced ·in my judgment by the work ot an earlier Eliot, especillilly by his play, \The Cocktail Party.\ Since •he has ]ong been an enigmatic soul-searcher, I ex:pected to find \The Confidential Clerk\ fraught with the enigmatic, soul-searching pro.fundities· with which Mr. Eliot customarily taunts his audiences. J;'erverse playwright that he is, he has reveled in con- fusing his audiences with pieces that are indisputably controversial.; but, in this new play, the confu.sion stems not from his profundities, but from their absence. I .found mJyself made uneasy by the real- ization, as the acts marched past, that I was not finding the deep significance for which I was searching. I was missing Mr. Eliot's point, I thought. Now I know better. Unless I am a victim of the blindness of ignorance, Mr. Eliot's point is right out in .the open, devoid ·of its usual armor, shorn of its poetry, and utterly clear - unless you search in vain, as I did, for a deeper meaning which just is not there. Mr. Eliot must still be chuckling gleefully over the plot he cneated. It is a procession of illegit'imate children, all of uncerta:in parent- age, and all in dire need of !mow- ing exactly whose children they are. That their identity emerges at the end is a tribu:te to Mr. Eliot's genius, for the snarl that ensues when ()once the searching begins is one that would tax the patience ant1 sanity of a Socrates. The unraveling produces quite a few good laughs which last well after the final curtain descends. From the point of stagecraft, Mr. Eliot has always left something to be desired. \The Confidential Clerk\ is no exception. Admitted- ly, it is a play difficult to stage, for the characters do little more than stand and talk to ea{!h other. .. --~ ...... ~ ............. ~ This they do adequately well under the circum~lances, but I wonder whether the play would I'ea;Jly lose anything if it were nelegated to the realm of closet drama, to be read rather than seen. Thie point aside, Mr. Eliot seems to have had trouble spreading his plot over three acts. The dia-logue is often wordy, and the absence of his poetry makes the wordiness -rr:ore apparent. The intensity of \The Cocktail Party\ is gone, and in its· stead is a not-so-serious and' not-so-deep treatment of the pro·b- lem of whether one is b-etter off fulfilling his life's arr. bitions or fol- lD'wing the course. dictated by cir- cumstances. Mr. Eliot has not de- cided the question, and neither have I. Neverth~less;. t4e play is amusing-, -and if you <lo not expect to see in it the Eliot of J. Alfred Prufrock ·and \The Gockta.il Party\ you 'Wiil probably enjoy it, if only for its. ingeniously contrived .plot. H you go, however, anticipat- ing the ultimate in theatre art-the .perfect union of drama, diaiogtie, staging, literature, and rhythm- you wHl be disappointed. If the acting is a:ll that draws you to the theatl'e, you v;ill find it good enough in this play. Ina Claire plays her rol'e to the hilt. Her Lady Elizabeth Mulhammer is farcical, w hini.sicaJ, E~catter­ brained, and delectable. She makes much more of the part than the script giveS' her. Claude Rains, as her husband, Sir Claude, gives a performance befitting his status as a fifty-year man in the theatre, but is stifled somewhat by hav:ins- to humanize a not-too-.plausible char- acter. Joan Green wood, the Eng- lish actress with the voice that sounds like a coa binatioa of that of a frog with a girl in its throat and a foghorn, flits \ith graceful' abandon from scene. to scene, justJ. ly deserving her niov.ic\won ac- claim. Douglas Watson, an ac- compli\shed actor, seems, however, oddly negative and stiff, playing the pallt of Colby almost at arm's length. It is a shame that Mr. Eliot did not make up his mind what kind of a play he wanted to wdte, .seri- ous or farcical. As it ·sta.nds, it oscillates between the two, leaving some dead space between the ends of its swings. The result is a slightly inferior play by my stand- ards, and more so by Mr. Eliot's. ~ ................................ ~ ...... ... Tulips ~nd· Chimneys· 8 By Edward Oloos, J'r. \' ......... It is the time of year when the .Admissions Office sends its fairy tales of \Liberal Arts\ Union to the eager high school seniors of the country. I am not averse to fairy tales, and I like Union. With this point clear we shall proceed. How can Union be called a col- lege of \Liberal Arts?\ Even the most active imagination, if coupled with at least a supra-moranic in- tellect, would be severely strained to so much as suggest that there is anything \liberal\ about our dear little school. I euppose that there are some \arts but hardly enough to justify so imposing a title as \I;..illilral Arts.\ It is a popular expression with the admiinstration that \nothing is ever done n,t Union simply be• cause it has been done before.\ If this were true, nothing would be done at Union at all. A moment's reflection suggests· that this is nearly the case, although some things ate done. Aren't they? Another beloved ex:pression is that Union is a \balanced\ college. The meaning of this is never quite clear, but it appears that whether it be a, balance of engineers and \L. A.'s,\ or a balanced education for engineer;;, or so-called \Liberal Arts\ · students, it is mere fable. The idea of a balanced education for engineers has been a Union dream for more years than I, un- fortunately not an engineer, can count, but the college has never had enough faith in such a plan to give It any sort of trial. It seems to be feared that no students would come to our \hallowed· halls\ if we didn't offer our un-liberal arts program. This seems more than ridiculous. In any case, the idea has never been discarded, and continues to be dragged through the admissions office propaganda. Ignoring the \.balanced\ nonsense, it becomes clear that Union is in reality an engineering school -with some \L. A.'s\ also in attendance, certainly not a \Liberal Arts\ col- lege. If Union is not, what then ie a true \Liberal Arts'' college? A Liberal Arts college graduates in- dividually thinking men. It cre- ates an Intellectual climate con- ducive to understanding. To dis- pute this would be to dispute the entire basis of education, and dis- play a carefully develo:ped ignor- ance. It is obviously unnecessary to point out the fact that this has not been the character of Union's graduating classes, To be sure, there is some intel- lectualism- at Union, but not the independent and vitally alive sort of \avant garde\ intellectualism which results in creatively free thought. Instead we ha.ve the campus aesthetes ·Who, unfortun- ately .• prefer a dull sort o~ snob- bery which has little place at any college. There are exceptions of course, but were there more the Union tradition of bourgeois in- tellectual complacency could not long survive, and our unburied but corpse-cold-dead trustees 'Would turn over in the-ir cemfortable graves and be very much disturbed indeed (and trustees are never to be disturbed). Myriad fraternities give rise to small groups of collectively indif- feJ•ent students, further stifling \avant garde\ intellectualism. What is to be done (assuming that something would bel? We have our trustees, fraternities, aethetes, and tradition-all above irrpeachment. A balanced college for engineers, an \avant garde\ in- tellectual climate of opinion for the study of the Liberal Arts, or both? Any would be unique. None VI ill be adopted as long as there are plenty of students willing to come to an old psUedo-liberal arts>-engi- neering school with a llisiory of over 150 years, and no defiinte edu- cational policy at all. --~01--- Campus Cullings Bus Driver: All right back there?

Unfortunately, nearly .2 of a mile of walks are carved out of our lawns each spring, some of them neve-r to return to the grassy state, despite the fact that the grounds crew applies hund!'eds of pounds -of fertilizer .and many bags of seed each spring and summer. One of the real campus eyesoves today is the area. in front of the General Engineering Building. 'This was carefully seeded just two years ago and fenced off with string . But some careless soul knocked the string down and hordes of engi- neers, plodding in their typical \head. down\ manner, stampeded across the area day after day until there wasn't a blade left. This spring the .same plodding company is stamping out a 1iew cow path across the green in front of W11shburn Hrull. Meanwhile the upper-campus fratf;lJmity groups continue to tramp down the· Delta Phi lawn, gouging the terrace ever deepe1•, and then march on across Daley Field. It is understood that one of the factors which decided the trustees against renewing tl,)e turf on this playing field was the prospect of having students cut it to ribbons by walking across it day in and day out.

Other changes inclu:de wooden instead of galvanized o:mi:al end walls, one public entranceway instead of two, a simplification of the building's heating system, a:nd a delay in the installation of extra. facilities, such as a public address system and exterior landscapll:!:g. \Our present gymnasium,\ ean- phasized campaign chairman ae- quernbourg, \was built to take care of the needs of a student bocly of 400 and a program of four n::tajor sports.

CIRCULATION STAFP Alan Chl'ssler, Roger Harvey, Fred Roberts, Martin Stein, Charles Walkoft', :--:orman York. A Question Of Honor In another few weeks Spring Prom will take over Union for a few days. With all its carefree gaiety and abandon, how- ever, comes the perennial problem, - what to do when you want to show your date what the inside of yo11r dorm looks like and you can't find a proctor to witness her entrance into and departure from your room. Williams College has solved the problem admirably by turning to that oft-maligned method, the honor system. Their rules are simple, and the results are ex:cellent testi- mony to the honor inherent in Willhms men and, I expect, in Union men. In one of Williams' ten dormitories, the one housing only independents, girls are allowed to visit from 1 p. m. to 2 a. m., unchaperoned. Tn the remaining nine, hous- ing fraternity men of the lower two classes, tl1e hours are from 1 p. m. to 6:30 p. m. and, again, no chaperones need be present. The only check upon the students is the presence of watchmen who check up at closing time. Last year, one man was suspended fm· having a girl in his roo1n after hours, and, according to the Editor of the Williams Record, that is about the average number of violations a year.. To be con- sidered are the facts that there are full~- 700 men in Williams' dormito1ies and that the only lounge is found in the Student Union. The situation here is bad in two respects. We have no Student Union (the West College lounge and game room are wholly inadequate substitutes), and when one wants to bring a girl into a dorm a proctor cannot be found because he is out with his own date. The solution to our problem is absurdly simple. Why should we not copy Williams' honm· system? Naturally, the hours could be changed to suit both our preferences and our limita- tions, so that we need have no fear of being caught by vis- itors in varying stages of undress or profanity. We are no less moral than Williams men, or men of any college, for that matter. The Trustees have seen fit to trust us with liquor, and their decision has been justified. Why not now gTant us another trust? The advantages would be ~anifold. We would not have to embarrass oursElves by teU- ll!g. anyone .. _that we are not trusted enough t() have girls VIsit our rooms, the annoyance of the present situation would be gotten rid of, and we might, in the course of time he- come a hit more mature by virtue of being allmved to 'con- trol ourselves, instead of being controlled. -R. M. R. The Move Is On Long overdue, but nevertheless welcomed with cheers, is the news that our little beehive of technelog;ical thought is soon to be honored with the presence of a Visiting Profes- sor of Art. The appointment of 1\Ir. Paul Burlin, an artist of great talent and excellent reputation, can be regarded as nothing but a step toward making Union a truly Libera:l Arts college,-one where liberal arts are not only taught, but are actively participated in by students. The next steps, a.c:; we see them, are obvious. First, the Professorship of Art should be put on a permanent basis. Second, the music department should be expanded to em- brace a variety of courses including those suit8ble for the students whose knowledge of music ·waxrants study on a higher and more detailed level. These, too, ·w.ould be only stepping stones, and would necessarily be dependent for their success upon the initiative and interests of the student body. A desirable preliminary step, however, would :be to conduct a poll of the Union student population to determine whether such advanced arts courses would get the necessary enroll- ment. Our thanks are extended to Dr. Gordon Silber for hit; efforts in bringing Mr. Burlin to Union. We urge strongly that the new Art course receive firm support, lest it be the first step downward in Union's Liberal Arts curriculum. -R. M. R.

Copies of Keats and Shelley are being brought from their dusty storage holes, and Jackson's Gar- dens is already overcrowded owith str.i\l:en students, pining -away Qe- side our polluted creek. But to the dreamE'r, carried away by the sn:ells and th·e sounds of the sea• son, external' cfrcmr stances mean little. The wea.ther itself :seems to be against the very thought 9f studying, and g-rinding appears a,n absurdity. Somehow, Spring alv.ays brings culture into vogue. Just as the sap begins to rise in the surround- ing greens, so knowledge (or proeud0-kno\\ ledge J, rises to the heads of the young college, student. The emot[ons are aroused, and reason no longer rules. Philosophy, the Arts, and Music are given the biggest .play in these times, Against this urge toward intellectualism, ·for trivial \cocktail conversation;\ the student is almost defen&eless; for the never enQ.ing wonder of the rcbkth of life invariably stirs up thoughts on a higher plane than usual. However, I cannot help feelin,g that there i's something false about the iW-hole affair-like thE;! tooth- paste ads telling me how to get a girl. Romanticism is passe in these modern times; the age of speed require!! ideas which are ligl).t a:il.d easy to change. You do not travel by airplane and· carry ancient, cumbersome baggage. · Yet in Sprin.g, with the emotions- running ·rampant and reason being ban- ished·, we \praise that the spring time is all.\ ED NOTE-'This is Louis' first article since his return from a world tour. Louis, like his brother Hans, is one of our Grecian Dreamers. In keeping \1 ith the Spring v. e have a nice topic from across· the seas. From the University of Edinburgh we have received a copy of \The Student\ in which there appears an article entitled -\Ex- aminations\ by Prof. James Dre- ver. We thought the ScottiSih point of view would be of some intevest to the American college student. \It is tempting to bace o.ur present examination sysotern back to the early days of universities in the Middle Ages. Then scribes were few and manuscripts .pre- cious, and a priest going out into the world might be .expected to carry in his head the knowledge he needs. To test him, therefore, the authorities might reasonably shut a candidate up in a room away from works of reference and see how much he could remember. In point of fact, examinations in mediaeval universities '\\ere not like that, perhaps because writing materials were also more scarce, but even in defending a thesis orally the candidate would be judged in part at least on his ability to quote the relevant author- ities. Some say that the invention of printing should have changed all this, and that a candidate should now be examined in a li- brary with free access to its shelves ... It is certain that mem- orizing no longer has the practical value that once it had . except in the limited eituation in which be to sprinkle u few examinations at random throughout the year and. hold them ·without warning (re- member this is only an idea ex- pressed by our Scottish cousins but which we do not think too good an idea for our more serious stu- dent body, as· our minds work more closely atuned to a schedule than to some random hit-or-miss examination system). Thus we would to some extent avoid the For Your Information examinations are used. \Some years ago students in First Ordinary Psychology rwere asked unexpectedly to do a term examination about five :weeks after they had talten it in the ordinary course of events ... Most of them fell a long way below their orig- inal level.

4 FRIDAY. APRIL 23. 1954 Work Camps The Stumbling Blocks: [AJ [I] [~] [QJ [X] (Continued from Page 1) four departments provide roughly half of the students' expenses, the students pr-oviding the rest. The \Vork camp program runs purely on a voluntary basis. Any Union College students, excluding seniors cwho a:re interested, may apply directly to the American Friends Service Committee or the World Council of Churches, pro- vided they are willing to pay. the entire expense if accepted. The primary purpose of the Work camp is to create a broader feeling of international understanding and good will arnC>ng its members. Many of the beneficial projects that the work camps accomplish help to carry out that central purpose. For example, the members of cer- tain worlt camps may spend the summer manually constructing churches or roads, while those of other cantl)S may devote their time toward providing vital aid to hea:lth projects :md to needy individuals in a community. By sharing many experiences that can be derived from working and living together, students from all pat·ts of the world not only have the opportunity to learn and understand each other's similarities and differences, but also to become farr.iliar with peo- ple of a foreign community in which the work camp may be situated'. Fu!thermore, the basic purposP of the worlc camp can be fulfilled \() even a greater extent after- a student brings home and spreads to othl'rs his feelings of understanding and good will.

There have lie en many cries raised ovet· i.he poor state of the activi- ties on the campus. Recently the important job of coordinating these activi- ties, and helping the students in such a manner wherein they may ol..Jtain the maximum Lenefit from their extm-cuiTicular work was turned o\·er fl'Om the able hands of Wilford Ketz to those of Professor SYen Peterson of the Philosophy de- partment. Professot· Peterson had a difficult job facing him. There wet·e numerous activities confronted with problems needing, above all, a guiding hand in theit· eventual solution. This aid neected to come, and has come, from the new Co-o1·dinator of Student Activitie~. In o1·der to come to grasps with the situations facing ~uch organizations as the Flying Club, WRUC, and other:;;. 1 1 e has taken a course of positive action. In cooperation with the Activities Committee of both the Student Council nnd the Ilouse Presidents Council, Pro- fessor Peterson is now holding informal meetings with the leaders of all of the campu-s activities. The pmpose of these meeting::> i::> fo1· the activities to outline their particular prob- lems to the gathered gToups; they will also present their proposed solutions; that is, how they will endeavor to iron out these difficulties, and also put forward planned improve- ments for the futUl'e. The committee in turn will offer sug- gestions to the various activities for improvement, as well as offering constructive help to them. One of the main points of these meetings will be to help each activity in the choice of an adviser, who quite often can be a major factor of the s;uccess of any group. The beginnings of this aid to campus activities might seem comparatively small; we should not be misled by these observations. This aid represents the first constructive worl{ towards improving the extra-curricular life of the en- tire campus. Thev have replaced the proverbial complaining about Union apathy and are proceeding to do something about it. -G. R. K. Room Distribution Farce We are al\vays hothe1·ed when we observe someone doing an easy job the harct way. If \Ve attempt to show that per- son what he is doing wrong he will usually become quite irate. There is, and most of us fail to see this, a bit of jus- tification in this other person's action. It is fairly easy to criticize. It is an ertirely different story when we attempt to replace what we see to l..Je wrong with other measures. We feel, however, that we have in the p1·esent dormitory room as:;;ignment method, something which lends itself both to our criticism an•l to progressive amendment. Waiting on line~ before the administration building as though one we1·e waiting for the World Series .:represents what we see as a poor system for the students of the college. There is no reason we can think of why men need be forced to sit hours through the night to get the dormitory block which they want. It represents an easy method for the ad- ministration personnel, who do not keep the night watch· but it is pure waste for the students who spend many hour~ in foolish waiting. - It would be far easier fo1· all parties concerned if those groups desiring dorm blocks were assigned blocks impartially as they apply for them; or, what would be a far more a~­ cep~able method in the students' point of view, allowing the maJ~r. groups concerned (and let this be determined by a specific number of students) draw at the same time for the available blocks. There is, as we can see, an easier method of room dis- tribution. We have, and many others have also, voiced their disapproval of the present system. It would seem foolish then, when other roads are easily accessible, to once more see the men of the college maintaining their night watch on the administration building. -G. R.

Tulips and Chimneys :By Edward Oloos, Jr. ~ ................... ~ ...... ~ ....... ,_ ....... ~......,. .. ~ ...... , ..... ~ The last tiJ:r.e this column ap- peared I suggested that the educa- tional policies of Union, especially in regard to what was term.ed \avant garde\ intellectualism, ·-were not clear. Since that time it has been made clear that this doubt should not exist. Union College is firmly dedicated to the stifling of all independent thought, free think- ing, and intellectualis!fi of any- sort save the comfortable conformity which is deemed the most prac- tical intellectual way of life in our modern world. The educational policy at Union is one of sciolistic \egghead-ism.\ \Avant garde\ intellectualism. Union is opposed to it; but what is it, and is it really worth bother- ing about? Just what it is can never be defined exactly-it is not exact. This would porbably be the first point in a definition, following the statement that \avant g-arde\ intellectualism is a way of living and thinking not dictated by fashion. It is not exact, unchange- able, or institutionalized.; it neither leads nor follows. In short, it is free thinking and expression. As to whether or not it is worth both- 'ering about, the biased opinion of this column is that it is n:ore 'WOrth \bothering about\ than practically any thing else that is. Where is it found? The answilr to this is, alzr.ost nowhere. It does exist though. The glorious poet (to whom I owe the title of this space), E. E. Cummings, is an \avant garde\ intellectual and cur- rently America's finest poet-per- haps our greatest living Jlterary figure. He has a fresh outlook on life, an intelJectual honesty second to none, and a thrilling purity of style which makes you live his poems:-never simply read them.

Marianne Moore, Gertrude Stein, Edith Sit- well, Dylan Thomas, Truman Capote, and many others, all with a different style and view point, but all with singular free thought and expreseion, are all \avant gards\ intellectuals. The \many others,\ mainly including T. S. Eliot, must total less than 100 and the world is of billions. Wher~ are the rest? Where is Union? Where are you? Why are there so few, (not so few as 100, which refers to known lit- erary and inteliectual figures.) The answer seems to lie in our college system, from ·which is supposed to come the thinking people. Ameri~ can college students (including Union, but I refer primarily to Liberal Arts colleges) are over- read and under-thought, too eager to adopt the ideas of others, too sldlled at criticism and evaluation, blind to art, blind to life. We are indoctrinated into an insidious sys- tem of regimented intellectual con- formity by a wooden spoon group of soi-disant educators. We are educated in un-understanding. We. are Union men. ---•0,--- Certain thinkers believed that the sun goes around the earth; others that tbe earth goes around the sun; the truth would seem to lie somewhere in between . FRIDAY, APRIL 30, 19~\4 Th,y Children's Chorus By Hans· Groot Perhaps some of the college family remember the article on Union which appeared in the August, 1950, issue of \Holiday Magazine.\ The story was en- titled \Spook's Tour.\ It seems that a. section of our campus-up near the site of the new field house-is haunted. \Holi- day\ tells of a beautiful Dutch girl named Alice VanVeer \''ho was very popular with Schenectady boys in the 1670's. Her father, a surly recluse, discouraged all the suitors but one, a young grocer who courted the beautiful Alice fot' months. Suspicious of his daughter's !mig evening walks, old VanVeer fol- lowed her one summer evening in 1672. He stalked the lovers, waited until they sat ·down on the banks of what is now the college brook, then crept up behind and shot the grocer dead. Neighbors were -aroused by the shot and the girl's screams. and search parties were sent out into the woods. VanVeer, dragging his daughter by the arm, was caught at the intersection of Church and JAMBS Restaurant • GOOD FOOD at prices you can afford Booth and Fountain Service 426 State Street L. G.

In the con- fusion, Alice broke away, but the enr!'j.g-ed mob overtook her in the oak grove which bulldozers have now been levelling for the field, hous. There, unjustly accused of luring the young i?o'rocer to his death·, Alice was tied to a tree and burned. The first full moon of the sum- mer looked down on Alice's death agonies; ,Now whenever the moon is .full, her ghost can 'be seen re- enacting events that led to her death. At least, that is the way the legend goes, and files in the recorder's office do reveal that George Overacker, the campus cop, has, for two years in the past five, reported screams in the col· lege woods and a strong odor of smoke on certain nights during the month of June.
