Old Days\ Those stouthearted lads who decry the passing of the \good old days\ must view 1·ecent hell weeks with an ex- pression of scorn as they Taise their bri1nming beer mugs to theil· lips. Sad to sa.v. but their disparag-ement seems to be justified. Pledge paddles seem to have become items of decoration rather than instruments of aggTession, al- though freshmen have been known to suffe1· acute cases of sore posteriors and wounded pl'ide even in 1·ecent years. \Vhethe1· Ol' not uppercla:;s i maginatiuns have become less prolific, stunts me losing the reckless, devil-may-care qual- ity that endeared them i11 the hearts of so many fraternity men, and which neat'!~· killed a guou 1mmber ol' their pledges. Another feature of hell \reek ·wh_ieh must be quite odious to the aesthetic sense of the die-hard, all-fraternity boys is the trend towards utilizing; ple<ige's efforts for constructive purposes. As they see n1a tters, such labor debases the moral benefits that can be derived from a hell week that retains its original purity. 'This practical appli- cation, they feel. is but another num ifestation of an unde- sirable pragmatism and cheap matedalistic attitude which has crept into Amel'ican society. A rampant materialism may be a primm·y cause of more moderate hell weeks, but the fact remains that not only pledging, but als<J traditional :f1:eshman-sophomore rivalry, has toned down c<Jnsiderably-. Hazing, in its cus- tomm·y regalia, has almost left the Amedcan college scene entirely, and Cnion is not an exception. Some feel, how- ever, that hazing is nec·essal'Y in ordet- to ·weld each class togethet· and preserve that nebulous \class spirit\ and they, therefore, 1·egret its disappearance. But these people are likely to fail to recognize that the loss of this time- honored custom has not left a void. .A new spirit seems to be replacing the cla.::;s spirit of f<Jm1er days; the foUl' years are integrating with each other' instead of among themselves. Perhaps we seem to be overly-opt-iniistic in this state- ment, but we feel there is a distinct integ·:ra tion, a bridging of what we1·e once larg:-e g-aps between the classes. This new phenomenon ma~· be ascribed to maturer attitudes among- colleg·e students; a one-year <liffeTence in age and experience g-enerall;\-' doesn't seem to mean as much as it did previously, rlespite the sophomoric reeling of superiority still prevalent. It may be a result or a dec!'easing need for college men to bolster their eg·os through domination of others. Or it ma~' be a natural reaetion typical of our country's fair!,~.-· recent attitudes concerning isolation, but whatever the cause fm· the increase of ties between classes and the inc1·easing- mode1·ation of hell 1veeks, it is to be highly commenderl. I.C.H. Mother of Frattrnities It is not hard, as one sit~ in the lil.>rai'Y on a Thursday night, to realize tl:e pow~:r o-f the fratel'lliil- svstem on the linion campus. The fraternity man, \\vho. st.ays away in d1·oves when his i.Jrothe~·s request his .S€11Vices, is an inter- esting stud.L IIi:-; \o.,\'alties are divirled between college and \house\. Often he holds greater allegiance for the social organization t!wn for the aca<le'mic one. And this has dused some eyelJJ'ow 1·:ti~ing among non-fraternity men. We ourself take, of necessity, ;a.,n inactive part in f1·aternity affairs. But ,,.e do feel tha.t the meetino·s ad- ministrative tasl\t;, work assignments and feeling of loyalty to the group, have a real place in ·college life. As a student, the college man exerts an individual effort. As a member of an activity he leams to contril~u te to an organization which performs a seniee OI' assemblc>s a product. But onlv as a participating member of a social o:rg:anization, such a·s a fraternity, does he learn to cop-e with the problems of living with othel's. And so, on the occasion ·of Greek \Veek and cognizant of certain faults still in need of cm.reetion, we should like to reaffirm our faith in, and support of, the fraternity idea, at Union and elsewhere.

The students of Charles Annan offer a compact show not without surprises and stimulations. The first board the visitor sees on entering the room bel-ies the interest to follo•w1. Levy and Allen offer colorful but undistinguished compositions displayed, Uke all the paintings, ~~th a lack of Ji·tles ·bordering on arrogance. Levy's is mor() to our liking; we Hke the pleasing and sig- nificant use of V>·-hite planes, but about one-third of it is intense, incapsu.lated BJction out of place in the quiet rest of the '\\ork. Then, tm10 free studies in black and white 'by; Belus and Nevin; these would hold any viewer. Belus' is dynamic and free-its only limitation, the size of the paper. Nevin's might alrrost be described as introverted; it is deep but essential·lY static. peBJrs in a heautitul corrment on a thing crumpled, perhaps paper, Infinite nuance Vl~thin the strict limitations of the definite subject n akes a fasdnating fragment. His color work is bold•er but ever so refined. One is dominated by a corr•bination of lbJue and v.hite in a well-played motif of a curved shape. It is very bright but the delicate tou,ch is always theve. We find his painting rather lacking, b11.ut Loffredo hardly can fail to generate interest in his choice of colors. Go see.

BJ:\uh.Pck's Style Popular Brube-ck's jazz style personifies the latest form ·of p1·ogressive jazz which has received great popular- ity the past few years. It arose from the free-wheeling \bop\ of the forUes which h<:>C'flm<' disorgan- ized in its late years. NJ:ndc>m jazz, while frce and for the most part dependent on improvisation. is bound t·uc;eth..:r in firm patterns. Brubeck's n•ethod is to first lay down a groundwork of rhythm and timing by leading of'f with a pop- ular selection. He and his band then gradually depart from this base and eventually arrive at a point vo.here the music i·s solely their own creation. Intermittently, snatc:he·s of other songs can be heard. Then. smoothly and with precision, the •band, as one, returns to the orignal melody. The quartet ·has been ·described by Jazz ex:pert.

Pedestrian.s~ Lament Little can be said in this column that has not already been ec,hoed and re-echoed throughout the campus about the parking problem. Apparently, the new regulations have done little to alleviate the situation, having gone too far in many respects, creating not only new prO'blems but also ill will. Rather than jump on the band wagon that is already headed toward the Administration Building with tar and feathers, we would like to o<ffer severe! concrete sugges- tions. In a situation where s<J rnany persons want to park on campus, partly empty lots are just as bad as overcrowded ones. One JX>Ssible solution would be to prohibit only the Sophomore class, for example, from dl'iving on campus. This might not even be necessary, for with the Class of '84 gate an exit only, drivers f.r0rn fraternities on the east side of the campus will think twice before driving· to class the long way around. Another suggestion is an alternate day plan ()f parking on campus. This could take any one of several forms. We have been bothered l!r a seeming paradox in tlte new regulations. If students cannot park on campus, why should the.r Lather to registe1· their cars? Without the small garnet decal on their wind. shield, students could park anY:where on the college ground:s with little fear of getting a ticket, because they would be classified .as visitors. At the moment, we can think of no effective way to enforce the registration of automobiles. At the crux of the entire program, however, is a basic injustice. Union College is an institution which is here p-rimarily for the student. :Is is he who pays tuition. If any group of persons is to be prohibited from parking on campus, it should be visitm·s, quite the opposite of the present regulations. The administration has :requested a period of one to thre~ months to smooth the :regulations. We suggest that th~ Iron. should be heated up as rapidly as possible, because th1s problem already has many ¥.Tinkles. E.S.L. Chapel or Church? Why is att~nda_nce at Sunday chapel so poor? We feel the reason hes m the fact that the time it is held is inconvenient fo~ the majority of the student body. If it \vere held later m the day, more would be- eligible to attend. We realize that it is a cornmon trait of colleg-e students to sleep late on Sunday m0rnings. If they miss .the 11 A.M. chapel service, l:nion offe1·s no other religious activitv later in the day. · T~er~ are a large numbel' of students who regularly worshiP. m. the church of their choice Sunday mornings. The. majOl'lty of churches in s~henectady have their main serv1ce at 11 A.i\1: !his is not healthy co-mpetition. .B~use of _th~ confhct m hours. none of the clerg-y officiat- mg m the c1ty s ch u:che-s are available to speak in 1\Iemorial Cbapel. If the service were conducted later in ih€ dav the college ·would have a wider selection of preachet·s. · ' In _recent years vesper services have had .a growing app.eal m college. communitie&. Organ recitals could easiLv be mcorporated m an afternoon service. · In. ~he n~ar future, th~ St11dent Council will distribute a fiUestionnaire to deterrmne the Gonsensus of opinion on this m~tter. T~e re~ult of this poll will undoubtedly be taken mto consideratiOn b~· the administration. We feel that a change would benefit the majority of students as well as the college. C.G.C. Last September at registration, moot student drivers were informed that a new regulation concerning campus driving was in effect: no .student in .residence on ·campus or in fraternity houses near campus, was to be allowed to drive to or bl'tween classes. Move Sorely Needed The move undoubtedly was made to keep unnecessarv ·cars off of the campus and out of the crowded· legal parking areas. It was a good and sorely needed regulation-and it would have all but solved the problem, too-that is, if the Ad- ministration had not been so loose in handing out registration stick- ers to any(}ne and everyone who was willin;g to part with a dime; and, if any attempt whatsoever had been made by the proper au- thorities to enforce this ruling. In- stead, we now have what a. group of people thought was a more drastic solution, but what actually is n(}thing more than an unnecess- ary distu:rber of the campus peace. On the average, (}ne out of every four registered students is a ·emu- mute!'. Of those who have cars, most used to drive them to campus in the mo1ning, park th~m some- where near their classes and leave then. there until they left campus. very often using them as their \room\-tlleir \office\, as it were. The faculty drivers complained that, all too often, they were un- able to fi:nd a. parking place near 'their offices. Uni'ortunate as this situation was, it is no>w equally as unfortu111ate that 25 percent of the student body is inconvenienced 'bY not ·having their \offic·es\ at Jeru;t conveniently handy. Students Still Drive There are certain students who have been issued metal parking permits-specifically, those living in frater{lity houses without suffi- cient parking facilities and certain do11mitory resi·dents. This is a.ll \l'<>ll and goad. What is beyond comprehension, however, is why these students, some at least, still find it com·enient to drive to and between c1a.ss<>s, when every other student dares not even to :put his foot on the brake of his car vVhile driving ()n campus, for fear of getting a ticket for illegal parking. It would seem that the problem e:ldends, unnecessarily I may add, to afternoo-n and evening. w:hy, mey it be asked respectfully, is the Uni()n College driver, having busi- ness at various parts of the cam- pus (most especially, at Washburn Hall) forced to park his car so inconveniently far o£f campus? In the afternoon is it to make parking facilities available for the ·non-existent tra.ff.ic? And in the evening, is it to give these park!in:g facilities to the outsiders attending functions in ~emorial Chapel? And, if so, are these things jwJt. to the student? ln short, ·something is wrong. Fr01m the rumblings of a majority -and, froim all signs, the majority is rapidly gro'l\'ing to unamimity>- soone<me ought to take heed. Robert Lehrer, '56 _ Martin Stein '56 WaJter Stock '57 Robert Malincr '56 Jerry Goldstein '57 * * * To the Editor of the Concordiensis: There comes a time, at varied pPriods in history, Vl~hen mature men and women, .holding the sane interests and follow~ng the same ends to a more or less common go·al, have t() af,firir·•· their inde- pendence and Interdependence. Col- lege students the 'VIQrld over are members of a class of society; one \'hich Is neither economic nor soc- ial, :but yet definitely actual. There are tv.o cases at present which call for our support. One of these is in Spain, and the other is in our owrn country, albeit it is a section of the country with a peculiar, unique traditi<m. As our own domestic problems are closer to our hearts than thO'se of an- other country, let us flrst look at the case of Miss Autherine Lucy versus th~ White· Citizen's Councils, a latter-day reincarnation of the Ku Klu;x Klan. Miss Lucy is a college graduate, holding a B.S. degree and a cer- tificate in teaching. She wants to attend the University of Ala- By this time, all of us, if we so rnuc):J. as glance at a daily ne'<l\S- pa.per, are cognizant of the fact that Miss Lucy is being denied her constitutional rights as an Alr- erican citizen. She is also being denied her rights as a mcJ;n'ber of the humart race, subdivision colleg-e stt:dent. Wll~·. and by whom? Succumbs to Mob Rule The University of Alahama, in order to \.p.rotec.t'• the righ.ts of Miss Lucy, 'has succumbed to :rrtob rule and del).ied her the exercis.e of her rights. There is not encmgh room here to go over- all the facts in valved except the basic issu.e, \''hich is, as \\'e see it, state's rights and defiance of the Supreme ·Court. The principles invo!ted by the states concerned ar.e .grouped un- der a term called interposition, \'~ich is in reality another W>Ol'd for nu:llifica.tion. T'he .]>resent state of affairs, if allowed to continue, '<1111' eventually lead to a setting approaching that of 1860. The mood of the South is almos·t the same, and so are many of their o.ctions. However, the southern states have already tried, a:a.d lost, an effo'l't to assert state's rights on the Negro- question. The Civil Wru·, and the subsequent horrible days and years of :R-econstruction bear vivid witness to that. What the present situation leads one to believe is that the South is trying to d·isavow all events after 1860. But history cannot go back\·u·ds or even stand still for a period olf close to a century. Our present system of government is evidently one which w•e prefer over· any othel' or else it would have b·een rrodified, as has been done in the past. Under tqis .sys- tem, the legislative 'branch of the government has initiated a Jruw concerning desegregation in the schools. The adrilinis'b·ative branch has endorsed that law'. So~Peone has contested its consti- tutionality, and it has 'been upheld by the final arbiter of United StatE's legislation, the Supreme Court. The South is trying to disown and discredit the Cou1't and bring back or ·retain a •way o'f life i:hat does not, and .cannot, operate for the ·ben~fit of all c,oncerned. It is up to us, as future responsible citizens of the United States, and as the international C()rranunity of nations, to ass.ert ourselves and affirm those things which we be- lieve in and live by. I am calling for a united stand, by the students of this c.ollege and eventually by a!l college students, for the prin- ciples of lilb.erty and justice. A good start would 'b·e a telegram or Jet.ter. from the student body of Umon, to hll the principles con- cemed in the present case: a let- ter of support to Miss Autherine J. Lucy, orie of rebuke to the students of the University of Ala- bama and one of condemnation to all those . who support the idea of segregation in the public schools of the country.

It's a ve1y big job-and a very important one-which calls for the pooling of varied types of engineering skills. · New manufacturing processes and methods are constantly required to produce better telephones, better cen- tral office equipment, better wires and cables, new types of electronic equip- ment to keep pace with the nation·s ever-growing need for more and better telephone service at low cost . In addition to doing our job as man- ufacturing unit of the Bell Telephone System, Western Electric is busy pro- ducing many types of elech·onic equip- ment for the Armed Forces.

But she murmured, softly smiling at my yearning to explore, \No my darling, nevermore.\ While my senses from me stealing and the room about me reelino- From a sickening liquorous feeling, which was chilling to the core, I more ardently repeated and, whispering silently, entreated. But my advances she defeated as she motioned to the door. \Hold I cried, \don't leave me lonely.\ She turned and stood before the door, \Stop or you will have me-nevermore.\ Back into my chamber tuming, she filled again my heart with burning, And new warmth in her discerning, I held her tighter than before. Presently my soul grew stronger and, hesitating then no longer, Though with no intent to wrong her, I started to implol'e. Hoping and vainly praying that it was not useless to implore. Still the answer,-\Neve1·more.\ ' Downcast I stood, not perceiving that my courage had been leaving; But her bosom still was heaving so I attempted furthermore. \i\le embraced in silence broken only by a thought unspoken That this fervor was but a token, only this and nothing more; . Just a taste of hidden ardor-this it is and nothing mo1·e. For still she whispers,-\N evermore.\ I could never live unsated, thus my reason I debated And decided that, though hated, through one bold method I could score. · So solemnly I extracted a gleaming object which attracted; Soon the dreaded scene enacte<l, everlasting love to me she swore.

As nothing particularly stimulated our imagination, ~)quiet contemplative reverie prevaded our perambulat- ing footsteps. Walking thus silently lost in thought7 we were suddenly .brought to our usual acute sen.se of aware- ness :by a startling painting lying in an unlikely corner of a small paint shop. It was an abstraction of the nee-impressionistic school v.•ith dynamic overtones of dada- ism modulated soberly by an in- trinsic feeling of continuity, We stopped, struck with admiration and a wonderful awe at thus view- ing such a stirring. creation in the midst of the everyday world of banality. We had 'never seen so masterful a stroke, such a keen appreciation of color and line and so integral a composition on even the well- canvassed walls of Old Chapel, our favorite haunting grounds. This keen artist had verily captured a mood of infinity. Forms, shapes, gaudy colors somberly intermingled with dark tones of poignant sad- ness impossible to fathom. All com- bined to produce a singular effect which defied definition or dissec- tion. In fact, the separate figures were meaningless even to our criti- cal eyes. It was their superb in- tegration of non-objectivity that conveyed the experience and sense of life pulsing. within the· soul of We guidied bhe woman as she come and perch on top of the 'backed out the gate.

But our joy was to be short- lived, for from within the dark in- terior of the little shop appeared a you n go paint-besmattered boy. Was this the artist we breathless- ly asked ourselves? Slowly, the boy produced a number of· paint brushes and with his long grace- ful fingers poised them tentatively above the canvas. Then he pro- ceeded to wipe them off upon the surface of the painting and calmly walked back for a fresh supply of dirty brushes. Ah! Such is the life of the critic.
