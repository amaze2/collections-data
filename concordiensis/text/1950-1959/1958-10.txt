PilCiher in an exclusive <Jonoordiensis inter- view'. £Housed in a special building completed only weeks ago, the radioactive material is surround- ed by a six. thousand pound lead shield. Completely enclosed by a steel and ba.xb fence, the foot- thiek concr-ete building is located in the northeast section of the campus, partially hidden behind the college barn. Specially licensed by the Atomic Energy Con::unission, the new equipment Is officially rated at 1210 Curies In strength, and is de- scribed by Dr. Pilcher as \a lbigh intensity sour-ce of Gamma radia- tion.\ Rumors to the effect that the new building contains an atomic reactor of some type have been vehemently denied by .college e>f- ficials. • According to Professor Pilcher, who is in ~harge of the project at Union, the cobalt equipment will be used t01 \study the effects of Radiation on certain materials.\ It will be available to all Science Deparbm·ents, but it is expected to be used most by the Depart- ments of Physics and ChemiStry. The ·Schenectady Varnish Com- pany, whose chief executive offi- cer is a lTni·on trustee has made the new research facility available to Union, and is expected to share its use with the college. Professor Pilcher stressed that the \safety features of the new ,unit have been carefully desigrted to comply with AEC speciflca· tions\ and added \this is an un· usual facility for a college that does not do extensive research.\

The yearbook, originally scheduled for publication over the summer months, is presently only in the final stages of pre-publication, and probably will not reach the campus before December.

When asked if he could enumerate the above .points, Dr. D'Agostino felt ,tliat he had not spent sufficient time in his new environment to verify, let a;lone formulate, his impressions. However, he did speak of the European view of American edu- cation. The Italian .student, who, incidentally, is required to study the English language, superfi- cially regards the typical Ameri- can student as a boy \wit:h a great deal of money and an easy life\. Recently, however, Italian scholars have been studying American education and culture from a deeper ·point of view.

Apex Music Korner .-.-.------·-------------, i LUIGl•s f There can be no doubt that the reason for this pre- longed delay is the inefficiency and perhaps irresponsibility of the 1958 Garnet editors. Yet Editor-in-Chief Gerald DePass was graduated from Union last spring, and chas- tising him at this time can be of no concrete value. We wish to point out, instead, that the Garnd is one of the few organizations on campus that has little personnel continuity from year to year. The present Garnet staff, headed by Ronald Weinstein, should in no way suffer the onus of blame for the tardiness of a publication for which they were in no way responsible. Indeed, were it not for the voluntary work offered by present Garnet members, the publication might be delayed even longer. The Concordiensis hopes, however, that this deplor- able situation will not repeat itself. We applaud the Un- dergraduate Publications Board's decision of last spring to appoint a junior to the highest yearbook editorial posi- tion; a marl. who has another year ahead of him at Union after his term as editor-in-chief expires will of necessity, we believe, make sure that his obligations to the college communty are fulfilled, whether from a more close per- sonal tie with the campus, or whether as a safeguard against strong campus criticism. We further hope, moreove-r, that the irresponsibility of the 1958 Garnet editors will in no way affect the policy of student-run publications existing at Union. We feel that the Garnet shouldn't be placed under strict faculty surveillance for the coming years; on the other hand, how- ever, a closer l'elationship between the Garnet and its fac- ulty advisor certainly seems to be called for. Cooperation? Competition among fraternities is a phenomenon very much in the limelight during these weeks of rushing. We have noticed that in addition to interfraternity competition there has been a move toward College-fraternity rivalry, on a social level. He proceeded to contrast our schools with the selective and highly specialized Italian institu- tions.

Progress Report Frosh detmonstrate a.s Scht-nectady aut;llo·I~ies take custody of two Union ll!en at tile dose of the Paja~na. Parade. By Leslie Marrus severed •in their attempts at re- laxation. About two years ago the Concordiensis, in an. editorial entitled \We Wonder\ raised a number of questiOns c~n­ cemino· various phases of camp-us life. Among the topics covered were several items which still are sources of won- del' among those on campus who are even slightly con- cerned with the State of Uni(}n. Union's traditional Pajama Par- ade before the first football game of the season came off .in fine style last Fr'iday night. The fz·eshmen involved in the exer- cise apparently were pleased with their handiwork. A few Schenec- tady residents were not as pleas- ed, but this does not necessarily reflect on the parade. The unsympathetic police, look- ing for ·a ·scapegoat, chose lRoy J. Hjelmar fot· a ride _in thetir distinctive vehicle. When Roy declined, the ·police chased him and insisted on his accompanying them. When Bradley ·sweeney, another frEshman with esprit-de- corps, inquired as to the extent of the 'bail required to aiJow Roy to return and catch up on his much-needed sleep, he too was invited alo-ng for the ride. Whether the o·oal of enough money for a new library would be met by 'he end of the academic year was one question that was raised. A second w~s w.hether the H.PC would continue to igno1·e flagrant V!Olahons of rushmg rules by its members. Still another point was the com- parison of the average index of rushing chairmen with the college averag-e in November. . . At the present time, two years after that editorial appeared, the Concordiensis feels that the points men- tioned there deserved continued consideration. Although vve realize that the C{)l!ege Community has not been in- active on these \thoughts to ponder\ we feel that there is still considerable work to he done. Will the new libral'Y in actuality be constructed in the near future? Will prefened rushing be accepted by the seventeen·fratemities so that dirty rushing and the abnor- mally time-consuming activities of rushing chairmen can be to a large extent eliminated? At the begnning of this academic year, we too wonder. Polemically Speaking By Stepllen Cooper (Tilt> opinions I'X]lressed in this ~.llhmut are not nPeessarily those of the Editorial Boartl). The poor handl'ing of living regulations by the Union College Administration is overshadowed hv the farce tho. t is called \the administration of dining facili- ties.\ The past years have seen a steady rise. in prices and an equally steady decline in the quality of food served 'in West ·College and Hale House. The problem must ·be solved before it gets worse. One administration official feels that the solution lies in requiring all freshmen meals to .be eaten at \Vest College. His bas'is fot• this proposal is that there will be less money wasted on coolting extra food which will never be eaten. On cerl:a'in days a lat·ge amount of food may J;e 'prepared for a meal, and be- cause of the sl'ight leeway given to freshmen in their eating choice, a large proportion of it may have to be throWn away. By Plimin- nting- this w1.ste, it is thoug-ht that the prices will go ·down. Plan Missps J>oint latter hall less pz·one to con·up- tion because of the combined forces of the faculty eating there and the absence of meal tickets) se-es many unbel'ieva;ble discrepan- cies. Fo1· example, at West Col- lege a simple fen cent_ cup of orange juice contains 2.5 ounces, while at Hale House the same dime purchases 4.4 ounces. Com- parison with outside private fa- cilities d'iscloses even greater dis- parities. How can Feno's Res- taurant give a Union student a complete dinner with choice of soup or juice, relish plate, all the bread and butter he wants, two vegetables, a well-prepared meat c such as pork chops), desert and beverage for as little as n'inety cents? Question Is Choice 'rhe number of pajama-clad freshmen who at first turned out was not satisfactory to some· so- phomores, who subsequently roamed through the hal·ls of West College for fresh recruits. Re- cruits 'in tow, the entourage head- ed for the gate, where a pep rally was held previous to a so- journ into Schenectady's .business district. March Downtown .Ammenities over, the paztici- pa..nts marched toward State Street. Reaching their destina- t'ion, cinemaphiles promptly head- ed for the State Theatre. Ushers offet•ing little resistance, they gained access to the moviehouse, rushed down the aisles to their seats, spiritedly singing and chanting the songs from their Freshman Handbooks. When the local gendarmes arrived enmasse their quarry had apparently fad- ed into the night. The theatre manager was sure that they had been there, however, from his b1•ief encounter wit::h one of the fresilmen. The manager refused to bring any charges, though. Hot on the trail the local ges- tapo encountez·ed their quany at Union and Lafayette Streets and stealthily trailed them to Union and Seward Place. The group, numbeJ'ing upwards of 75, quite tired at this point, lay down in the street for a much deserved rest. -Although they were forced to move on tv.-'ice, the group per- The oth.er freshmen present showed their displeasure of this infringtnne:nt of the K'ing's peace by pelting these men in •blue with pennies a:nd water-filled bags. The policernen, evidently. men of ill humor, hauled the frosh off to the local gaol where they charged them with disturbing the peace. Five friends appeared, howevez·, t<J rescue the stalwart •heroes. Ciiminals Appear On Tuesday the two \criminals\ appeared before the austere Jus- tice Louis .J. Rinaldi. Expecting the worst, they were relieved when the charges were dropped for lack of evidence or for that matter because no crime could be found to charge them with. Prev- iously accused of wanton destruc- tion, the pol'ice were fo!'ced. to shame-facedly admit that con- trary to the Schenectady morning paper, all crimes were perpetrated by local ·high school charges. The judge, evidently a man of wry humor, asked the two men if they had gone out for football this year. When they replied that they ·hadn't. his honor remarked, \Maybe i.f you exercised some of that energy on the football team, they wouldn't have lost last week by SO mu{)h,\ Chern Department Work Tradition With Spirit By Ste.plzen In his junior year, the Union pre-med delves further into the fields of chemistry, and is at onoee exposed to the mysteries of a subject which we call Organic.

True, less food would be thrown out. But what of the natur-e of the management of the eating facilities? And why must the solu·tion be one whtch will hamper even more the free choice of a place to eat? Further, and most important, what precaution will be taken to ensure the food being palatable? But the question here is more than the quality or quantity of food given by a monopolistic oper- ation. No, it is the question of choice 'in eating facilities. The id.eal system would be one where no meal tickets were needed and the quality ancl price of food could successfully compete with outside facilities for the student custom- er. If it is imposs'i·ble to com\ pete. then the eating facilities should be abolished, for any other course is pure fraud. Hale House competes successfully (although there is no general enthusiasm over the ·bill of fare presen.ted l, and the Rathskellar ha.s also seen -its share of sucooss. Moreover, we need a system where the best 'interests of the student's palate and waiiet are prime considera- tions, and not the desire for profits.

I hold that the monopol'istic fran- chise given out 'Ia an ordinary businessman, in this instance Jo- seph Fleishman, is the main cause of the degeneration of din- ing fac'ilities at Union. When one knows just what his income will 'be (·and Fleishman does, because every cent that is paid for meal tickets is given to him by the end of the year, whe- ther or not the food is eaten ·by a freshman), he corr-ectly (though not. justly) feels tha.t every penny Saved by skimp'ing on quality and size of portions is money in his pocket. An observer making a few simple compaTisons between West College and Hale House (the Offer Solution What can be done? The best method is to have a student group act as trustees of the eating fa- cilities. They will hire a trained Steward - Dietician - :r;[anager who will operate bhe facilities on a straight salary. No cutting corners will put any more money into his ·pocket, a;nd therefore the most will 'be given for the money. The injustice of fording a stu- dent to use the facilities of a profit-making organization will end. Also there will be more sup- port for a student-run project, and better communication ·between management and customer w'ill r\esult in improved service. This is the only Just and economically sound way to run our dining fa- cilities; JOE RUDMANN slunk down to the stocltroom and obtained a replacement.

Every attempt around the etids was stopped cold. The Union quarterbacks' reluctance to pass after a few interceptions left the Dutchmen with only a sound attack through the middle o'f the line. Many Dutchmen did manage to shine in the. lop-sided loss, how- ever. Once again Bill Pike ·boomed forty yard punts.

The University of Tehran 'With Union College students will have the opportunity on Wednesday of participating in a mock election conducted under the auspices of the newly-formed Political Forum (see story, Page 1). In addition to voting on stat~ and national candidates and state issues the student Will be able to register his feelings on two campus matters of con- siderable interest: a preferential bidding system and. UR- limited cuts. Proposal number two is concerned with the continuing of the present absence rule of unlimited cuts for juniors and seniors in good academic standing. We have little doubt about the outcome of student opinion in this matter. The existing rule appeals to almost all undergraduates, and to a considerable majority of the faculty members. Al- though in the eyes of some members of the College Com- munity the present system is being abused, the fact re- mains that students will not vote against anything which tends to render their academic life more enjoyable. Proposal number one, reading \Do you fav()r a sys- tem of preferential rushnig and pledging\ is of vital im- portance to the student body at Union. As established by the Political Forum, a yes vote indicates that student opin- ion favors a system whereby students desirous of belong- ing to a fraternity ar~ extended that privilege on a prefer- ential basis. A yes vote obviously also indicates dissatis- faction with the present system. The Conc()rdieusis feels that the present rushing and pledging system leaves muth to be desired. One of the obvious faults is that a student often pledges a fraternity in which he is not actually interested. Much friction is often radiated in the course of four years because of this, A preferential system insures fraternities of the fact that all of their pledges definitely rate the fraternity highly. When we looked up Tehran on the map It looked like a thousand miles from nowhere, and now that we are here, it still do~s. Yet there 'is no sense of isolation- except when the mountain ranges seem to close in-for this remark- able city is self-contained and multifarious. It is a combination of the med- ieval and the modern with no n'ice comfortable Vietorian bric-a- brac .In between. The wide ave- nues are intersected with narrow small alleys called \kutches and both are lined •with open ditches of running water into which, mir- aculously, the automobiles never seem to sl'ide. Very early in the morning you can sometimes hear a soft, clop- clop in the streets ·(like Freihof- er's horse in Schenectad-y), and you look out to see a camel cara- van where a few hours later you will see only motor-cars from jeeps to Cadillacs, interspersed with a few littl-e patient donkeys that have long s'ince rejected the human race. Nothing in Tehz·an is finished, apparently. You can't go a block without encountering a broken· up sid.ewalk, and nearly every Square seems to 'be torn up for installation of a fountain or sta- tuary. Hundreds of apartment buildings and office buildings are in construction, prices are high- and Iran proposes to keep her promise as a progressive nation under her energetic young Shah· Mohammed Reza Pahlevi. Many editorials 'in The Tehran its approximately 9,000 stud.ents and 450 teachers has not yet gone into full schedule although place- ment tests have :be!illl under way for some -t'ime. In English •stud- ies, for example, only 100 have been selected out of 1,200 a:ppli- cants. The competition is sil.acy, and higher education is a very serious affair with young Jl&Ople here. College is never just 11: sO<J- ial opportun~ty casually engaged in, but a bitterly contested chance for u]timate employment an•d a place in life. The language of the Univer-sity is Farsi, ·but since I will be teach- ing )n the ;Division of Foreign Languages, I will be allowed to lecture in English. A good tlJ:i!l:g, too. English is the next lan-guage -more than 95% of Iranian stu- dents now study it as their sec- ond language, although in earlier days French was favored. 'Fl'ench, of course, is st'ill most useful here- abouts, and I m·ge its study fei:- vently. It seems to me that in order to appreeiate America one shoul-d know other conn tries if opJlo r- tunity offers, and to travel with- out language study is to miss the very heart of one's experienee, We think of Un'lon these days -thE' fall coloring on the Libr-ary and Washburn Hall, for exam.ple .. They are pleasant pictures in the mind; and, incidentally, if ever there is talk of removing 'Wash- burn for campus construction, we will take our stand amon.g the react'ionaries who defend it. N'o reason, except that we like it! Let it be understood that a yes vote in no way implies Academi· c Bureaucrac '? that all students must join a fraternity.

Hamilton, the lowly faculty for their own future welfare. for example, is switching to a preferential system in the coming academic year. Williams now enjoys such a system. The Concordiensis feels that the forthcoming election is an excellent and highly democratic method of deciding student opinion. We hope that every student will avail himself of this rare opportunity to express his beliefs. The way for a consensus has •been opened; the students must now exercise their rights to be heard.

The Faculty Thanks again and we hope that Council will in all probability vote <>n making permanent there will be no fuDther hold-ups o: shortages due to poor plan- nmg on our par-t. Stop in and see if we are right. The Rathskeller Staff this system at their next meeting, with the proviso that any individual department may alter the system as it sees fit. The 'Concordiensis suggests that the student body act in a practical matter as l'egards t(} the cut system. We feel that extensive cuts in those departments known to be strongly opposed to unlimited cuts, such as the mathema- tics and modem language departments, are foolhardy. The ancient pl'ovel'b about biting the feeding hand holds true even today. At the same time, however, we believe that the Faculty Council should vote into permanency the un- limited cut rule, and that all departments should follow this proposal. We advocate the policy that a student has the right to attend or not attend any given class. We also feel that if a student can not assimilate a subject because of excessive unexcused absences the solution is not to re-· quire classroom attendance. Instead, we suggest failing those students Whose work does not justify a passing grade. Jack-in-the-Box That a student does or does not attend classes should not be a ceiterion for grading. This should he done only on proven ability. A Commendation \Ve think it at this time appropriate to compliment the student body for its conduct at last Saturday night's jazz concert in Memorial Chapel. It would not be Wrong to state that an atmosphere bordering- upon sophistication existecl, and. made itself evident in the applause, general stuflent conduct, and a noticeable absence -of smoking and drinking (which seemed to pervade similar functions last year). · Many unfavorable comments have been directed to- warcl campus fraternities, criticizing their lack of support of the concert. It must be pointed out that fraternty hack- ing of campus functions is anticipated, and indeed ex- pected, during- a prom weekend. However, it must be re- memberd that this was Homecoming Weekend, where fra- temity activities should be (and were) centered about the fraternity itself, as an individual unit.. This has been the weekend's function in the past, and should remain its function in the future. A hit more foresight on the part of the Delphics and the Student Tax Committee would have predicted this lack of support, and compensatory measu:res then could have been effected. By Paul Ji'rcundlich I am still mildly deaf in one ear from Maynard Ferguson Sat- urday night. I would not carp if this infirmity had been .receiv- ed in a worth- while cause. It was not. From the applause that frequently interrupted h'is numbers, how- ever, I dare say there are many who appreciat- ed· noise for noise's sake~at least this is the only reasonable explanation I can advance. I have mentioned earlier that I am slightly deaf in one ear- this 'is, df course, an exaggera- tion. Actually I regained the £till use of my hearing hvo days later. But I was sitting in the balcony -What <>f those in the first few pews? I cannot say. I did ~ot have the heart to examine their obviously broken and shattered frames. Now 'it is true that the size and acoutics of Memorial Chapel may have contributed to the over- whelming sound. Yet I doubt that even in .the Fieldhouse they would have been lo$t. finale for a TV spectacular. Only there weren't any dancers. Pity. Fortunately Maynard Ferguson only provided half lhe music. The rest of the program contained the best jazz I have heard in years. Billy Taylor was the ar- tist Saturday night-or .perhaps virtuoso wou'Jd be a more accurate term. It's what everyone else has been iooking for; Taylor has known for; years. He would be- gin with a trite little melody, just p]ay'ing around-then suddenly there would be four themes weav- ing in and out in a complex pat- tern. All of this with a seeming 'lack of effovt that made Fergu- son's febrile flounderings all the more ludicrous. Not that Taylor is way out (esoteric). His was solid, swmg- ing jazz, beautifully conceived and executed. The group itself was -the most perfectly -integrated ag- gregation I have ever heard. As a unit-they were. On individual fl'ights-they flew. Taylor's drummer, Eddie Phig- pen, swung his way through a wild Afro-ClLban drum solo that at no time degenerated into noise. lf nis bass player, Earl May, is in any way handicapped by being left-handed, then he compensat- ed awfully well. A,s long as I'm on the subject of left hands, Tay- lor played one piece with his left hand alone that so1.mded more lilre he was using three. A,s for Vlrhat the lt,etguson en- semble pla;ted, it wasn't very good. Excij:ing, yes~but :an unsatisfying excitement, compounded of vol- UI)le, screeching and speed·.

Finally, 1 have heat·d LUllaby of Birdla;nd done at least a hun- dred times. I had thought -that there was nothing left to say about it-well, Billy Taylor said it.

Friday, October 24, 1958 Polemically Speaking By Stephen Co(}per The student response to the Oc- tober 10 article on Union's eating facilities wa~ as e~pected. The majority of students palled by this writer are strongly in favor of the recommendat.ons made in that colu-mn, and there were 'no dissenting 'comments. The response of the faculty, however, was quite surprising. Three faculty members approach- ed me J,ndependently and ex- pressed sympat)ly with the gen- eral progra;rn put forwa-rd, and then went on to make further suggestions. The major proposal of bwo of the faculty men is that there should be Sunday meaJs. It was suggested that there was a conspicuous !libsence of the bare minimum of Sunday breakfast and lunch offerings on campus. Faculty is (Jo:ncerned The 'important :point •to no-te is that the faculty is. concerned abeut the state of dining facilities on campus, And they .should be ·concerned! They have more at stake than any student. With faculty suppmt, much can be done to improve the dining s'ituation at Union. More import- ant is the fact that the faculty ·have a ready-masie organization (in the .form of the :faculty coun- .oil) whose authority can be used to reinforce any .student senti- ment on the subject. W·hat this writer respectfully suggests is that the faculty council pass a mot'ion to investigate -the state Apex Music Korner Playboy•s ~Delight $1.98 Minus Your Discount SAL SALVADOR STU WILLIAMSON CONfE CANDOLI STAN LEVEY PETE BROWN JONAH JONES EDDIE SHU OSCAR PETTI FORD CHARLIE MIN&US TERRY MOREL HOWARD McGHEE at -APEX Music Korner STATE at BROADWAY FR 7-1112 of the d~ning facilities at Union. Immediately follo:w!Ilg passage of this motion, machinery could be set up to invi·te one or two d'ie- ticians or restaurant stewards to survey the situation and make any -appropn-ate recommenda,tions. If the study shows tha;t Hale House and West College a1;e be- ing run for the benefit of the {!Ollege community, then there will be no changes. If, however, the oppesite •is the case, and the conclusion is reached that major improvements could be made, ar- Fangements should be mad'e to change the ma,nageinent of the two din'ing halls as soon as it is practicable. We must ma.ke the dining fa- cilit'ies work for the benefit of the students and faculty. Just as a man does not aid economy nor ensur-e quality in his kitchen by giving the cook a sum of money for the food, and saving that whateve-r is left over the cook can keep, so Union ·College should have racil'ities where the ,excesses from· stringent econo- mies are g;iven back to the stu- dent in the form ·of less expensive meals and -better foed. * * * This writer Wishes to apologiZ\e for the omission of a phrase from last week's column which noted that tile use of bold-face -type for the quote from the catalogue was made by th'is columnist, and not the catalogue.

Has it improved? Has it grown worse? The silence of the administration on this point is distressing.

Michigan Program IDvery 'Christmas Michigan State conducts a ten day program for foreign students attendin~ schools in the United States; The stu- dents have the opportunity during tlis period to spend the holiday with an American family, and to visit various industrial plants. Th . e program leads to better under• · standing and gives the H.ID.L.P. students a m.ore accurate picture of American life, and of course everyone has a thoroughly enjoy- able time. The cost of the pro- gram Is $115 plus transportation costs . The students pay as much of this as they can and the · rest is provided by the faculty fund. President Carter Davidson, who went to Europe t'his summer to visit former H.E.L.P. students, commented that he was quite pleased with the results of the program. :Many of these H.Jll.L.P. students are continuing their edu- cations and others have alx-~ady gained some measure of success after graduation. One man Is do- i · ng some work for the United Nations and another has worlted · as an aide for West · German Chancellor Conrad . Addenauer.
