With Gordon MacRae CHAIN OF EVIDENCE With Bill E!fiott The feeling has arisen, since the class of '58 brought Dave B.mbeck to the campus last year, that each class must battle for profit-making ventlues to sponsor, and promote them to the hilt, storing any accumulated funds in the elass treasury to be spent eventually on a stul?end- our Junior Prom.

ESL And Codman Hislop I put my heart in .c My doggerel, the great William Martin Scholarship Revisions 'The change in the policy towards annual scholarship grant renewal comes as one of the most welcome altera- tions. that the administration and B()ard of Trustees have recently made. In future years, scholarships issued in the fresh. man year will be maintained by the college with- out reduction throughout the student's remaining years at Union. 'The new anangement wiU result in a number of ad- vantag€s both for the coUege and for the individual stu- dents concemed. Students will lose the feeling of having been stranded by the school after the first two years. It is hig-hly probable that the college will profit by the ch~tll_ge in attitude in the form of larger donations from former scholarsMp holders who will be somewhat more amia.bly inclined toward Union.

Schurig, Vought Fox, Hoadley, and Wittner in vain I've sought Fit rhymes and if I seem too off-handish Wfth Henry Holt and Charles Junior Standish, Neal Woodside Allen, William Cady Stone And Patrick Kilburn I hereby atone, For I'm exhausted-the poem is se fini, (Except Karl Schmidt and William Thomas Winne). Campus Cullings At Harvard, the Committee on Education'~! Policy has finally succumbed to student .pressure and has approved of typing finals. The new method was put into ef- fect this past exam period and the results are yet to be pub- lished. The cost of tuition and room and board was raised at Yale to the stupendous figure of $2,000 per year. Tuition was raised from $1000 to $1100 while the cost of room, board and incidentals went from $-800 to $900. lOver at · RPI tuition charges were raised also. Here the in- crease was from $1000 to $1200. The additional $200 per student is expected to raise $600,000 for fac- ulty salaries. Theta <Chi Fraternity at Lafay- . ette had to pay $80 for a Christ- zv,as tree. The tree, along with 20 o•tb;ers, was stolen from an · Easton, Pa. merchant, and was found,. fully decorated, in the Theta •Chi living rom£. The other 19 firs have not as yet !been , located. 'The guarantee of a four~yem· undiminished grant will also serve to increase the school's power to attract perspective freshmen. At the san1e time, students will benefit from a greater freedom from financial worry. The action of the administration is to be lauded and we would feel at fault if this column which is so often filled with argull!ent missed the opportunity to praise this new poliey. At •Colgate, tuition charges are now $1000, a $150 raise. In both cases the reason cited for the in- PAG crease was rising costs. Also at Lafayette three valuable wall clocks were stolen from a dormitory. 'Their value is plaqed by authorities at $60 apiece.

Among other op- ponents, Amherst declined, explaining that they only had such agreements with the Little 'Three teams. Kings Point replied that their own students had to pay for their football games, and Hobart and Rochester have not yet :responded. On the topic of future :sched- uling, Ketz said \:All schedules are rapidly being :eompleted for next year.

Page Four Friday, Fe~rtaary 22, ~ 957 450 Girls Invade Campus for Mardi Gras IV Although Uniop can't hope to m~tch the spectacular annual festival in New Orleans, there is little doubt that Mardi Gras IV will provide an,other top-notch Winter Weekend. The tem:pera,ture in this vicinity has risen considerably, aided and abetted no daubt by the presence on campus of about 450 girls from near and far,. and should go up even further before the festivities end. Skidmore once ag·ain rates top honors, with 55 belles here for the costume hall. Numerically, at least, the girls from 'Toga barely top the 54 loca'l lassies. Adding to the gaiety will be 44 femmes from Albany State and 25 from Sage. Traveling somewhat further will be a contingent from Syracuse numbering 18. On the local level; Kappa Nu once again leads in num- ber of dates with 45. Other top totals include: Delta Cb.i, 40; Phi Sigma Kappa, 35; Beta Theta Pi, 32; and Phi Sigma Delta and Sigma Chi with 31 apiece.

The Garnet defeated RPI by five points, meet. from Chappaqua, N. Y. 67-62 on December 15. The starting lineup for Union ' figures to be the same as that of I recent games. At center will be I ti'6\ ::-<orm Baum. Bill Cole and · 1 Drew Lawson, 6' and 6'4\ respec-1 tively will occupy the guard posi, lions while Frank Crum, the only I sophomore who has been a regu- I Jar starter, and Dan Berman Will I ()perate out of the forward posi- tions. Crum -is 5'11\ and Berman stands an even six_ feet. Also slated too s~ considerable action for the Garnet are guards Ed Conaway and AI Duncker, for- wards Marty Nachbar and Bill Mather, and Arnie Lewis at the center slot. Starting for RPI will probably be Don DeLuca, a 6'4\ center, Rudy N esse! and Ed ' Umgelter, both forwards measuring~ · 2\ and Ralph Hasenbalg, 6', and :t;;d Han- tho, .6'2\ at the guard positions . Leading reserves for the Engi- neers are . guards Dick Besha, Lee Day, and John Moffa, and Dick Chait, a forward. DeLuca and Hasenbalg are team co-captains. In tlie first game of this sea- son between the two clubs, Union took an early lead and was never headed. A tight zone defense set up by the Cartmill crew kept the RPI attack in check all evening. Taking the initial tap-off, Union gained an early six point lead with three consecutive field goals. The ten minute mark found Union on the long end of a 19-13 score. In the latter minutes of the first half however, the Bachelor five closed the gap by capitalizing on numerous foul infractions by the Dutcb'inen, and at one point pulled the score up to 29·28 in favor of Union. The Garnet managed to pull away again, though, and led at the half 41-35. A fairly consistent ten point lead in Union's favor held throughout most of the second -half. A late RPI spurt fell short as time ran out, leaving the Dutchmen with a five point mar- gin of vict()ry, High scorer for the evening was Crum with 22 points on ten field goals and hyo foul shots. Both Drew Lawson and Ed Conaway scored 13 points, while Cole t<~ol­ lied eight. Besha paced the Bachelors with 16 points, while Chait and Nessel with ten points apiece, were the only other Engi- neers to hit double figures. The Garnet yearlings meet RPI's frosh in a preliminary con- test beginning at 6 :30. The relay terum being made up of Bob McCabe, Giert Knutsen, Tom Lawrencp and Lingan Ran- dolph is expected to come through with flying colors. The lead off- . man.
