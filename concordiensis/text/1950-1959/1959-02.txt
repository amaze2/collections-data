The first state school superintendent in the nation, he served the cause of public education in New York State from 1818 until his death in 1870 and has often been termed the father of the State's •Common school system. His initial appoint- ment as Superintendent PI'eceded by a quarter of a century the election of Horace Mann to the secretaryship of the Massachu· setts Board of Education. A native of Connceticut, Haw- ley resided from an early age in Saratoga County of New York State and was prepared for col- lege at the Ballston Academy. His undergraduate record at Union is somewhat obscure, but the fact that be was invited to remain at Union as a tutoT following his graduation in 1809 is evidence that it was a good one. While engaged in his tutoring duties, he began readi·ng for the law under Henry Yates, brother of New York's governor, ·which studies he tem- porarily relinquished to prepare for the Presbyterian ministry. He subsequently returned to his legal preparations and was finally ad- mitted to the Supreme Court of the State in 1812.

Lee, Communication Director for the New York Thruway Auth- ority and Mr. Benjamin F. Brad- ley, Assistant Supervising Engi- neer of Radio and TV New York Telephone ·Company will be on hand to assist .Mr. Dewire. Founded at Union College in 1877 SCHENECTADY, N.Y., FRI.DAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1959 Appointed Superintendent of Common Schools in 1813, Hawley literally had to organize a public school system and provide for its management. He was instrumen- tal in the enactment of two vital pieces of legislation, the amended school law of 1814 and the revised school act of 1819. Inherent in the former was the mandatory provi- sion for the maintenance of a commo·n school by each schoO'l district. In addition to these ac- complishments, he also found time to write the State's first instruc- tional syllabus. So successful were his efforts that by 1821 96 percent of the children of school age in the State had actually attended school at some time during the year. The number of public schools had also doubled under his administration. Prior to the meeting the Union College Joint Al!IDE-IR.E Student Branch will provide a banquet dinner at the Town House Tavern for RPI guests, Mr. Dewire, Mr. Lee, Mr. Bradley, and Mr. Richard D. Wood, member of th.e Schenec- tady Section AlEE, and Director of Student AlEE .Activities. Student Slashed A special invitation to attend this meeting is opened to the members of the Schenedady Sec- tion AIEE and IRE and to all stu- dents at Union College. Trustee Election Reported by Baker Hawley reaped his reward in that year-summary dismissal at the .hands of the Van Buren poli- tical machine, which had man- aged to capture the S.tate Council of Appointments from DeWitt Clinton. Labelled a \gross out- rage\ his dismissal resulted with- in days in the passage of a Jaw making the Secretary of State ex- officio Superintendent of Common Schools. Was Elected R-egent The election of a new Term Trustee, as well as several new appointments within the Board of Trustees of Union College, was announced recently by Clhairman Walter C. Baker following the Board's annual winter meeting in New York. Baker w)lo has served as Chair- man of the Board since 1941 and as a member of the body since 1932, was reelected to the top post for ano·ther year. Also reelected was Vice Chairman :Meade Brunet of Mendham, New Jersey, w'ho is a Vice President of the Radio Corporation of America. Named a Term Trustee of the College, as well as Secretary of the Board, was Albert P. Bantham of Schenectady, owner of the Ct·cdit Bureau of Schene-ctady. A native of this city, Mr. Bantham was graduated from Union in 1924 and has been one of the Col- lege''S most active alnmni. He has served since 19()2' as an Alumnus Trustee and has held membership on three of the Board's most important sub-com- mittees, the Executive Committee, the Buildings and Grounds Com- mittee, and the Committee on Personnel and Facnlty Salaries. His Alumnus T'rustee post has now been •va:Jcated and will be T·hough distressing to Hawley, the ill-conceived political. action of 1821 by no. means ended his service to the field of educatio·n. He had alref!.dy served since 1814 as Secretary to the State Board of Regents and ·continued in that post until 1841. Following his resignation as Secretary, the Legislature elected hilh a perma- nent Regent, in which •capacity he served until his death in 1870. Among other contributions, be wa:s also one of the fonnders of the State Normal School, now the New York State College for Teachers in Albany,. and one· of the original Regents of the Smithsonian Institute of Wash- ington. and filled by an alumni election later in the year.

Edith Garvey and Peggy Snare were turned over to chil- dren's <Jourt authorities on a warrant charging them with being wayward minors. Arroested were Jesse Tison, 17, of 119 Park P1ace, the alleged leader of .the group, Ha;roid Du- Pont, Joseph Blais, Edith Garvey, and Peggy Snare, all of Schenec- tady. Several of them already had .criminal records, including car theft, burglary, previous knife-slashing, and other misde- ,meanors. Tison, the actual assailant, spent time in the Rochester Industrial School for stabbing another youth several years ago. The victim, Robert Pfeiffer, 19, of Chi Psi Fraternity, was taken to Ellis Hospital for treatment of •cuts on the right hand and left hip. lHe is a sophomore enrolled in Liberal Arts. hand tussle, which followed, when Tison picked up a piece of glass and began slaShing him, inflicting the aforementioned wounds. But before the teen-agers could drive away, Pfeiffer's companions, John Palmer and Ed NichCfls, re- corded their license number and notified police. The car was spotted at 3 A. :M. on Albany Street, and after ques- tioning, DuPont disclosed the whereabouts of the other four youths. The police then went to the alleged location of the four, Blais' house. They were found sleeping in the attic amid a con- glomeration of empty beer cans, and were taken to heailquarters and questioned. Pfeiffer has stated that he will press charges on Tison. The fiove will remain in custody until the investigation is completed. Time of the attack wa.s placed at about 1:15 Sunday morning. As Pfeiffer and two other Union men were crossing South Avenue on the way home from a Barrett Street restaurant, a. 1957 car later identified as belonging to Du- Pont's brother pulled up and stopped. One of the youths in the car yelled out, \Stay out of the middle .of tlhe road,\ and several I 1958 Garnets will be distrib- profane expressions.

Collage Collection On Exhibit Here A collection of collares and con- struction'S, assembled through the courtesy of the Hansa Gallery of New York City, is now being ex- hibited in Old Chapel gallery and will run through February 26th. Also participating in the exhibit· are the Martha Jackson, Brata, and Camino Galleries of New York City. Collage, according to Professor Wayne K. Nowack of the Art De- partment, is a contemporary art form in which seemingly odd and unrelated fragments and materials are pasted together. A construc- tion, he pointed out, may be either an ambitious college or some- thing more three-dimensional in appearance. Both are of 20th cen- tury origin, dating back to the period of the first World War. Gallery hours for the new ex- hibit will be 9 A. M. to 9 P. M. on weekdays, 9 A. ·M. to 6 P, M. on Saturdays, and 3 to 5 P. M. on Sundays. \We collected a total of $621.1&,\ said Coons, \and the Delphics are circulating now in an effort to contact the people who noted on their questionnaires that they wished to be contacted at a later date.\ Coons noted that there was a good chance that the drive would go over the thousand-doUar mark. \In addition to the direct dona- tions we will add $182 to the fund from the auction and $100 from other alumni gifts,\ he said. Will Review Choices When all the money is in, some- time late next week, a coun.cil made up of one student council rcpresentaHve from each class, a Campus Chest committeeman, and Dr. Norman Johnson, will review the choices of charities by the students. \Funds will be allotted to the various charities according to student opinion taken as a whole, a,ccording to the student choices,\ Coons said. The Delphics assumed the ad- ministration of the Campus Chest when several organizations had tried unsuccessfully to inter-est the student body in its goals. Other committee members are Lawrence Kahn, Nathaniel Pul- sifer, and Eugene Cassidy, with other Delphics acting as solicitors.

That no fra temity will be asked would be built between Wash.oorn to accept a pledge whom it does not fully desire, nor vice versa, is understood. After thoughtfully digesting the full rushing report, however, the Concordiensis firmly believes that the pro- posal of deferred rushing and cooperative bidding is one of the most sound and most constructive ideas presented at L:nion in many years. That. there are minor flaws and loopholes is apparent even now, yet in practice we are con- fident that they will resolve themselves. The committee is to be commended for their conscientious achievements. v:e have not forsaken .otir idea of a one hundred per- cent preferrential system. Yet is is entirely possible that L'nion is not ready to accept this L'topian dream. The co- operative system is a more immediate·- solution,. and one, we beleive, which is more than adequate.

Better· Late Than Never? \:Better late than never,\ is an oft quoted phrase. When used in respect to the recently published 1958 Gar- net it becomes a banality. In addition to the fact that this yearbook at best can not hrun:i the prestige of Union in the eyes of those people unaffiliated with the College, we feel .that this effort is an i11sult to the members of the College Community. We hope, or trust, that a deliberate insult was not intended. A yearbook, we feel, should. tell a story. The many unidentified pictures, accompanied by quotations obviously far from their element, tend io render the story a comedy of errors. The highest compliment 'that can >be paid to the 1958 Garnet is to call it a hard cover Life magazine. The editor-in-chief of the 1958 Garnet was a senior whose olbligation to the college apparently ended with graduation, if not earlier. Bearing this in :mind the Con· cm·diensis feels that the present policy of a jun:ior year- book editor is an extremely p1·actical one, especially if the Garnet eontiniles to include hjg-h'lights of the spring sem- ester and Commencement Weekend.

'Webb has stated t'hat student sentiment should •be of primary oon·cern .in deciding many o-f the features to 'be included in the structure whose This coming Tuesday evening, February 17, 1959, and plans ar-e ne·a:ring t'he drafting ta- on forthcoming Tuesday evenings in the succeeding wee~s, ble. actl ·on of vital importance to everyone connected With The fint prdblem to be dealt f h t with is the site of !.he new build- Union College will take place at the meetings 0 t e wo ing.

Location Questioii:S The proposals of the rushing committee diffe~·s from Many factors must ,be cDnsid- our vision. The committee suggests deferred rushmg, but ered in choosing a location.

Cooperative addition to containing more room, h 1. h a library built on tbe Dewey bidding, as we understand it,. is a system W erevy eac Hall site will more easily lend fraternity voluntarily seeks to fill its bidding quota by 'Ltself to e~pansion.

On the other bidees, so that an equita:ble designation of pledges to hand, t'he square structure which houses will be assured. That no fraternity will be asked would be built between Washl>urn to accept a pledge whom it does not fully desire, nor vice versa, is understood. After thoughtfully digesting the full rushing report, however, the Concordiensis firmly believes that the pro- posal of deferred rushing and cooperative bidding is one of the most sound and most constructive ideas presented at L'nion in many years. That there are minor flaws and loopholes is apparent even now, yet in practice we are con- fident that they will resolve themselves. The committee is to be commended for their conscientious achievements. V\'e have not forsaken our idea of a one hundred per- cent preferrential system. Yet is is entirely possible that Union is not ready to accept this Utopian dream. The co- operative system is a more immediate•· solution, and one, we beleive, which is more than adequate.

As stated earlier, both the HPC and the Student Coun- cil will be afforded the opportunity in the near futu)'e tb express their opinion on the proposed system. The Con- cordiensis urges the student body to bear in mind the fact that both deciding bodies should merely echo the voice of student opinion. We feel that every student is obligated both to himself and to Union to spend fifteen minutes in reading the complete text of the report and to advise his Student Council Representative and/or House President of ,----------------------~......, his opinions concerning the matter. We hope that the final decision is not left by default to those few elected officials 509-511 STATE STREt:r FR 4-7709 Music Korner STATE at BROADWAY FR 7·1112 embodied in the two governing organs. Better· Late Than Never? \Better late than never,\ is an oft quoted phrase. When used in respect to the recently published 1958 Gar- net it becomes a banality. In addition to the fact that this yea1~book at best can not harm the prestige of Union in the eyes of those people unaffiliated with the College, we feel that this effort is an insult to the members of the College Community. We hope, or trust, that a deliberate insult was not intended. A yearbook, we feel, should tell a story. The many unidentified pictures, accompanied by quotations obviously far from their element, tend to render the story a comedy of errors. The highest compliment that can be paid to the 1958 Garnet is to call it a hard cover Life magazine. The editor-in-chief of the 1958 Garnet was a senior whose obligation to the college apparently ended with graduation, if not earlier. Bearing this in mind the Con- cordiensis feels that the present policy of a junior year- book editor is an extremely practical one, especially if the Garnet continues to include highlights of the spring sem- ester and Commencement Weekend.

They will aware of the various financial also submit a number wh'ich considerations involved. they consider to be their ideal Fourth, freshman soeiial life is centered about the fraternity. A deferred system would have to create a social life for freshmen until rushing begins. Fifth, in the present rushing system, the probh:m of \dirty mshing\ is limited to the short three W<'Ck period. Under a de- fc•rred system, this proiblem of controlling ruSlhing might ·become rc-uc~'h greater. ·These are the most .positive as- pects of the 1mmediate rushing system. However, this committee feels that there are a number of unsatisfactory .features that ma•ke the present system less adequate than a dt>ferred plan. In pa.rtieu· la:r. it is felt that four aspects now incorporated 'in rushing need sl rengthening. First, katPrnilies face serious financial i.nstahilities under the pr·esent system. One year a pl.edge class may number three, the year a•fter 23. This is in spite of the fact that a f.ratcrn'ity needs a relativPly stable number of pledges if it is to maintain fin- ancial security. Fraternities are to·o important at Union to rest on such an unstable, fluctuating finanC:i-al foundation. Second, many freshmen do not receive bids despit-e their e·a:rnest desire for fratern·ity membership. This i>; <;al.!s\d in part l:)y the ex:- trf'mely short rus•hing period in \\\hich hou..ses fa:i.l to ·cvalua tc cor- Iectly freshmen and freshmen in turn fa:il ·Correctly to evaluate thf:' brnthPrs. It is imperat i\'<' that a system be devised which 1 '\\ill eliminate this defect. The 1 freshman ·who does not receive a bid at present feels extremely hostile and rejf'eted. He has no facllities for a healthy social life. The present. structure of fratern- Ity bidding weakens his collPge mora-le at the commencement of his college ·career. , Th-ird, frPshmen arriving at col- lt'ge in September have a most difficult adjustment to malw without the added :burden of choo·sing a fraternity. Many hoy-; have not been away from home before. All freshmen .must make new friends and adjust to an ar- duous program of study. FI·es'h- men have suggested that th~y would ·rather concentrate on the academ'ioe subjects during the first critical weeks of the first semes- ter without oconcerning themselves with fraternities. <l!lourth, school and class spirit at Union S'Uffer from the turmoil of the present immediate rushing system. The oomm'i.Ucc recog- nizes that there are many causes {Jf this, A ·change in the fi·atern- ity rushing systeun is not intend- ed a!il a p-anacea, but we feel that certain Clhanges would he helpful in this respect. It is the feeling of the committee t'hat much spil'it Wlh'i-ch is now given to the .fratern· · ity would ·be transferred to the pledge quoba.. C. Freshmen sha.ll su.hmit on the same day a list of fraternities, ranked in p-referenoo, that thPy W1ish t<J join. A freshman is not required to list all houses and shouJd only su.bmit those fratern'ities to whi·Cih he would be willing to join in prefer- ence rto remaining independ- ent. D. The Rushing •Committee shall then match the fraternities and the freshmen in the fol- lowing m•anner: 1. If a freshman reooives a bid fr<Jm the fraternity of his first choice, he shall 1\:>e assigned to that house. 2. In .a similar manner, the fres:hman as yet unbid shall next be matched with their second choice, and the pro- cess shall continue until the freshman is assigned to the house, :h'Lghest on his list, which has given him a bid and \V\hich has nat filled its quota. 3. The ideal pledge number submitted by the fraterni- ties shall be that number at whiJch the Rushing 'Com- mittee will storp 'in matching a katernity and the fresh- man rists. 4. No house Fhall be cons·id· ered to have filled its quota until it is assigned everyone who has chosen that house at t'he same !eve I of prefer- ence during which period the quota is reached or ex- cei\ded. ·5. Follow'ing this first rou-nd of matching, the Rushing Committee sha!l draw up a lillt of all unbid freshmen and this list shall .be dis- trib-uted to those h()uses that have not reached their quota. Such houses shall also receivoe the number, but not the names, of fresh- men assigned to them at that point. 6. Those fraternities thrut have not filled their quota shall then have until bha.t Sunday at three in the afternoon to submit a ne:w list of bids, if they wish to. Rushing shall •continue durinog tha.t three·day peri<Jd. 7. When tihe second ·bidding lists are submitted to the Rus1ring Committee, they will be ma:tchecl with t.he ·p.r:eferences of t!he unibid· fres.hmen in the id~;ntical manner with the first 1 Q un•l mat-ching. E. That e-vening, ·all bids will :be issued to t'he freshm-en. No freshman shall receive more than one bid, ' 111. Administi•ation A. This .plan shall be adminis-ter- ed ,l:).y a standing committee of the col!eoge. This Rn.rshing · Oommittee s.hal! consist of th~ fol!owing seven · members: President and Secretary of the Student Council; the President of the House Presidents' coun- cil; threo members of the H.:p.c. appointed ·by the presi- dent of that body; and the Dean of Students who shall act as chairman of the com- m'ittee. 1. The three members ap·point- ed 1by the H.P.C. president a.re not too be in ·the same .fraterni~y as ei t'her the Pre·sident or .Sec.re-tary of the Stu·dent Council. Y. Snmmary The Cooperative Bidding Sys- tem des<;:ribed .above in no way interferes with fraternity selec· tivity. Fraternities determine their own ideal quota and they are not compelled to fill this . quota. The advantage lies in that fraternities are better able to fil:l theil• pledge class by hav- ing· an immediate second oppor- ' tunity to issue bids. There is no reason for a house to have only a few pledges when there are a great number of available freshmen who desire house mem· bership. This Cooperative Bid-. ding System will a:lso give the unbid freshmen an immediate second opportunity for fraternity consideration.

Mr. Webl> has ex- pressed: his desire to present these questions to the student body; t!he theory behind this is that sin-ce the library is to. be p.re• dominantly for student use, who but our students are rbest qual'i- fied to answer such questions as have al\i$en?

Less than four years after graduation •.• He runs a team of 69 people serving 20, Q:OO telephone customers H. D. \Doug'' Jones graduated from Texas A. & M. with a B. B.A. degree in 1955. Today, Doug supervises six plant .foremen and 63 craftsmen for the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company at Galveston, Texas. He is re· sponsible for installation and maintenance activities on some 31,000 telephones serving 20,000 customers. It is a big job and Doug finds it challenging and rewarding. Here he is during one day's activities ••• \8 A.M. Today, before the men start out on their job, I talk to the foremen and their crews about the importance of taking every opportunity to sell tele- phone services and huild good cus· tomer relations.\ \1:15 P.M. After lunch, I meet with the district department managers to go ov:er floor plans for a central office now under construction. The office is being planned to serve a particularly fast· growing area.\ \9:1 0 A.M. One o£ the best ways for me to judge the results of our training programs is to ride along with the men on service calls. Here, I chat with a customer while a color telephone is in- stalled in her home.\ \3 P.M. At my desk I prepare produc- tion reports on our installation and re· pair activities. A foreman reports a complex switchboard installation heing completed today. I decide to gt> over and ta:Ik to the customer:\ \Well that is how the job went today ••• tomorrow will be very different. There is just no set routine on this assignment. I have to be ready for any- thing that develops. That is one of the reasons I really look forward to my work every day.\ Doug Jones and many co1lege men like him have found real opportunity to use their abilities in Bell Tele'phone Companies. There may he a bright and fulfilling career waiting for you, too. Talk to the Bell interviewer when he visits your campus. He'll give you the whole story. And read the Bell Tele- phone hooklet on ·file in your Placement Office. ~'I 0:30 A.M. Returning to the office, I check customer trouble reports with my Chief Test Deskman. Continuous · study of tl1ese reports helps us to pre- vent serious problems from developing and keep our customers satisfied.\ ·\4:·10 P.M.- At the Port of Galveston offices, I discuss advantages of the new P.B.X. with one of the officers of the Port.

A New Look ai Deferred The Deferred Rushing and Cooperati':'e Bidding Pro- JJOsal was passed by the. Student C?unc1l last ~:sd!l-Y nio-ht in what is hoped will be the first step tmq1.1d Its ev~ntual adoption by the administration and student body of the school. During· the course of the meeting many ant~cipated oqj ections wer~ raised against the .proposal, partiCul~rl~ by representatives of the Soph~moi e class. Thes~ obJ ~c tions centered around two mam spheres, the fmanc1al prO:blems incurred by fraternities under the new system, and the problem of maintaining an a?equate and n~ccess­ ful indoctrination campaign over a five month period as Not YPry Prolific Union's one-hund·red and ten man fa<::ltlty is no-t an especially pt alif•c one, in the liter-ary .sense of the ter·m, yd from time to time, \\-ot'd ;.>scapes to the student botly informing them that Profetisor Eradhury has written ·a book ca:lled Thf' Fugith·f's, or that Professor Ni('mcyer has published an arti- cle comparing Gide'e Lafcaclio to Dostoevsky's RaskolnikO\'. What is more, students of Chemistry are \W('l! aware of Pt·ofessor Bacon's collaborations in the writing of a tPxt'book in Q'ua.ntitative Analys-is. Divis'lon TV has perhaps been most RUC'C<'ssful in seping the the~H'ums, ftud'i<\s and texts of its faculty reach the presses. Rt'view Of Re~iew Yet on sec:ond thought, I find it necessary to· reject my idea of a review of ,the Review. This sit- uation has become analogous to the Thurs<lay n'ight frate·rnity meeting, dm•ing the course of which th-e much-distraught house rresiclPnt srverP!y chn.stises the body because a considerable por- tion of the members of the or- ganization are ahsen t from the meeting. This house PI'Psldent fo11gets that he is cr-it'icizing the very individua-ls who should be commended f·or attending the me~ting whi~:h the·ir companions have abs-ented themselves from.

However, not once during th€ course of the C,ouncil meeting was an objection raised which was not m1ffie- diately and successfully resolved hy the proponents o.f the prom·am. The student body must constantly be remmded that the proposal under consideration is not meant to be desbuctive, but rather the modern revision ~f what h~s become a stagnant and outdat~d sy~tem. The pr.o~osal Is not meant to undermine the mdiVIdual fratermt1es and cause them to sink into financial oblivion, but rather to revise the rushing system in such a manner that th? fra- telnities may- be strengthened under the cloak of a l1be'ral and perceptive policy. Lacl• o9f Faculty Publications Fol'getting for the moment that we are ·attending what a .prom- 'inent faculty memher- once re- ferr-ed to as· a \precar.iously bal- anced\ college, om· concern seems to center about the more liter-ary endeavors of the faculty, and woe should like to dismiss, a:gain for the mom·ent, the pub!'lcat:ions \\Yhose interest is primarily of a scientific nature. Cert<toinl:y noth- ing prevents the interested stu- dent from strolling into the b'ook- store and 'PU!'chasiri·g a copy of Professor Br-adbury's Fugitives. S'i.milarly may this same student se-ek out a copy of :t'he issue of Mo~~dern Fiction Studies in whioh Dr. N-iemeyer's aforementioned ar- ticle appears. Nevertheless one cannot deny the laclr of publ1ca- tions of faculty authorship, which are avrula'ble to_ students, even though an examination of the Union College Review proves the f'Xistence of a substantial literary talent on campus. One copy of the Review is given to eaah fraternity house, several copies are shelved in the Nott •Memorial Library, and a surplus may be found soatterecl about Thus it W'ill suffice to say (for the 'benefit of -those w:ho are read- ers o-f ,the se~ond page ·of the Con- cordiensis 'b11.1t who have not yet r-ead the January issue of the Union College Review) that the 'issue in question contains an ex- cellent at•tic:Je on caves by Pro- fessor Smith, a Slllper-hly-written essay •by Dr. Rislo;p -entitled Amer- ica Is Seai'c:h, and other- no less •worthy selections by Messrs.

VAN GLEE F . . .. , . . .... . : :. , ., & ARPELS' I often remember old parties I have gone to, the people present, and their foibles. For example, there is the one Heather Goquickly gave, some years ago, in her tiny Manhattan apartment. A line formed in front of her J)lace at six o'clock; it was almost seven before I stood, cold cau of Schaefer beer in hand, in a crowded cor:ner of the apartment. I watched Heather flying smoothly over the up- turned heads of her adoring claque (a stagehand- friend had put up one of those wire rigs one associates with ornate televis i on productions of Pet e r Pan ) , dispensing Schaefer-largesse and pointing out chairs to the most elderly of her guests. A creep shouted up at Heather. His head was huge- big, and he was wearing stilts; without them, one might have thought him a Dwarf Person. Words came out of his mouth like machine-gun bullets: \Rat-a-tat-tat; t a t-tat: and tat,\ he said, handing Heather her three-stringed dulcimer, which she played very well . Strumming it, she began to sing the happy air so popular to- day: What d ' y a hea r in the best of circles? \Schaefer all around!\ Then she landed beside me and wistfully drank my beer. \How tres, t r es!\ she sighed in her happy-sad voice. \Me or the Schaefer?\ ' 'Both of you , darling. You remind me of my brother Ed; the Schaefer, that's easy: it's got a smooth round flavor; never sharp, never flat.~' A tiger cub jumped into Heather's arms. She handed him to me. \You keep him Ed, or darling, or whoever you are; I think I'm off for Tangier now.\ Taking only a can of Schaefer, she was gone. I've heard from her just once: a post card scribbled in Swahili. Of course, the tiger grew too big, and I had to let him go. I've seen him since, though; he's found a proper home with a traveling circus. I hope Heather has too. THE F.& M . SCHAEFER BREWING . CO .. NEW YORK and AlBANY.

Febr.11ary 27, 1959 CRIME :Forgery Folly Elanor Sm·c1 ' anki, a fine, quaint, dedicated, beloved and supposedly well-meaning healer of the sick and deranged young men at Union (the small well-balanced) College on the banks of the placid Mo- hawk, had what apepared to be a nice relaxing disposition for a nice relaxing job within the fences of the sweet little college community. Then, as a complete surprise to everyone concerned, the respecta- ble R.N. became the center of the biggest scandal to hit the apathe- tic atmospheJ : e of the academy since a dismissed swimming coach, in a fit of despail·, commited sui- cide by - drowning in \The Brook That Bounds\ (honest, that's the name). Before a shocked and disbeliev- ing crowd, President of the Col- lege, Carty Davison, announced that the nice nurse had become involved · in the unheard of prac- tice of forging medical excuses for the Freshman gymnastic pro- gram. FreSihman Forl'-es ForgE-ry. In her defense, Elanor sobbed out a long story of torment and black- mail at the hands of a shrewd, 11ggressive frPshman whose leg . she had, in the course of a rou- tine examination, nearly burnt to a crisp by placing on it a dia- th.ermy machine set at R temper- ature hot enough to boil your poached eggs - on. In her confes- sion, the sobbing student of Flo . r- ence Nightingale re'Vealed that in order to keep the student's trap shut she had promised to give him g:ym passes for the rest of the week. Howe\:cr, she sobbed on, the sludent, a little disturbed at having his thigh permanently scared, demanded to squeal if she didn't keep coming across with the little golden sli - ps. By the end, of the second month of her forging folly, Elanor explained that she could go on no further. She had to confess aild purge her · corrupt- ed conscience and so confessed all to her quiet - spoken, r·eassuring leader, Dr. Miron Woven. The Athlete Speaks. The first to come out with a statement after the shocking little tale had seeped 'out of the porous walls of Silliman Hall, -was Harold (you have two unexcused absences, Sir) Witty, cha.irrnan of Union~s ­ progressive cur.ricular athletic program. \Thank •God we caught this terrible thing at the start,\ said Witty. \VVhy do · you realize that a practice like tl~is could make a shambles out of the fresh- man program. And there's no telling where it might end. Why, with a powerful mind behind it, it might even make a farce out of the sophomore program.\ When the smoke had - cleared everything seemed back to normal with even Elanor back · on the job. But even though the excitement had died down, th.e students were obsei1ved to be guarding their valuables far more carefully when the need arose to enter the ivy- covered walls of Silliman Hall . Babs vs. The Evidence By longstanding custom, the police force of that little town of Schenectady rGEville) has seldom, but not always, been partial to the students and - professors of the small, balanced, 165 year old engi- neering and liberal arts college within its ,midst. Three weeks ago the local cops .Jived up to their tradition . It was the coldest night of the year in a place where below zero temperatures continue into May when the local militia dragged popular college professor Babs Profunda from her heated apart- ment, and grilled her for two hours in the h01vling wind. Babs, attired only in a robe hastily thrown over her night clothes, categorically denied that it was her car which knocked over the lamp post in the middle of the mall on the street in the city which lights and hauls the world. WCTlT & Safe Driving Too. '!'he evidence looked bad, however, for the sweet life-long · member of the WCTU and charter member of the WTRY safe-d..riiVing club. T:he lamp post was indeed smashed, and her car, which was parked in front of her house, was indeed sporting a brand new dimple in its left front fender. The cops, who seemed to enjoy the sight· of Union's lone woman professor slowly turning blue from the · cold, finally were persuaded to forget the matter until the fol- lowing morning. Everything turned out OK, how' ever, as is so often the case in Schenectady. The real culprit was . caught trying to break into the college library, purportedly with the hopes - of pil(cring a rare volume of pressed flowers. And Babs went back to her Freshman English class, with only the bags under her eyes serving as grim reminders of the harrowing night.

Among the most serious objec- tions to the plan are: 1) the ex- pense atta,C'lted to installing the 'l'V · set in each room, <2) wheth- er or not it is really necessary for the programs to be broadcast in • color, -3) the prof:essors must submit to the gross invasion of their ·privacies which would come w'ith broadcasting from their homes so early ho·•r o.f the mor·n- ing, 4 \ ) whether or not the thirst for .knowledge will be <;ufficient ill(lucement to the students to \tune in\ and 5) the final exa!Ills will have to be given over TV, too.

Army, '55. Friday, february 27, 1959 SPORT starts, suffered a casualty which is expected to bust their already reduced squad. Cartwheel Resigns Po·pular basketball, tennis, and ,occer coa.ch To·m Cartwheel f1•om U\nion College, the weB-balanced :1thletic power, handed his resig- na.tion to President Carty Davi- ;on last week when it was lea,rn- ed t:hat his present cagers \shav\ed' points in at least two of the games dUring the current home sttand. Gartwheel',s surpr'ise move came as a climax. to four frantic hours of excitement on the campus. Union's super sprint star, Gills Grumman, while speeding through the slop in the school's antique pool, struck the wall as he ex- ecuted his famous flip-top turn during the third leg of the thrill- ing 400 ya1•d relay race. He sank immediately .into three feet of solid water and assorted unfilter- ed elem:ents before the amazed eyes of the horr-ified onlookers. One of the squad explained the weird action by, \We couldn't in- terrupt the race,. coulc1 we?\ 'The .action began slightly be- fore noon last Tuesday when the NCAA committee extended the final at-large bid for their post- season tournament to· Union. President Davison immediately accepted the bid for Union's first post-season tourney. Coach Ed Fubarski was a bit disturbed by the event. \That was a helluva time to start fool- ing around,\ he· chirped. \We were three feet ahead at the time. He could have waited until practice to try his under-water capers.\ A dissatisfied sub revealed to the police that the· team iliad shaved points during the slop·pily played game with Hamilton last Monday night as well as against Pratt. The Dutchmen, who had overwhelmed Hamilton by 29 points earlier in the season, were hard-pressed by an .obviously in- ferior team to win by a mere nine points. The sub, whose name has been withheld for the time being, stated that the Cagers were to win by no more than ten points in order to be paid. The objective ·Of point sharv:ing is not to lose the game but to win by no more than an allotted number of points. Kitz Hits Ritz Welford Eiiz, well-known per- s8nilility from Un:i:on College, waH honored last Wednesday by the Fathers of America with a din- ner at the R.itz in New· York. 'l'he award, presented by Roy :Mol'lane, was given to Kitz for his outstandin-g contributions to 81ITl.ateur abhle•tks. •Kitz, you w'ill remember, won national frutne for the experimen- tal Wicker-Wachter hasket last winter as he tdpped and broke his foot while high-jrumping over the hoop. Ki.tz tried this foolish stunt in an attempt to publicize :both the :Union tournament and his track team at the same time. It had been assumed that Kitz V\•ou:ld someday win the award ever since he sent all of the tickets to the Unton-Hammy.ton football game to the fathers of the members of the F,O.A. in 1956. Only a :mass rtot of the Union students \\v'ho mai'ched the entire distance to the Ritz pre- vented Kitz fi'om winning the award that year. Scoreboard The amazing shooting accuracy of tearn captain Frank Cramb al- most wrecked the deal, the sub re- vealed. Cramb, who had no knowledge of the fix, scored 20 points during the first half but was ha:mpered during the rest of the game by bad passing and \accidental\ trippings by his team- mates. The sub also stated that the scores were controlled mostly by missing foul shots and by com- mitting obvious personal fouls. Refu!les Bid. The release of this news brought two immediate ac- tions from the Pr-esident's office.
