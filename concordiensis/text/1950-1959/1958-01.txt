The ·proposal was initiated on December 3, and sent to the di- vision committees. The divisions 'will report at the Faculty Council meeting on Tuesday. A Concordiensis ·poi! taken this week showed a large majority of the faculty, as well as high offic- ials in the Administration to be apparently iri favor of the plan. 'Most of the opposition came from the Departments of Mathematics, Science and 'Modern Languages, •who argued t'hat \near perfect attendance is often necessary fot• · the success of some of our courses.\ Advocates of the .plan, howev.~r, point out that the pro- posal allows •each department to set its own absence rules, and penalize ~rades for 1poor attend- ance. Proposal 441 That Jllil.iors and Seniors in good aQadeniio standing shall be allowed 'unlimited cuts sub- ject to any limitations an- . nounced by each department and tha.t a student's grade in· a. course will be affected by his attendance.

The Bethlehem Steel grant will ·be applied toward the College's libra:ry fund, President Carter Davidson announced. The endow- ,men t results from the fact that Richard Yates, class of 1957 has completed the Company's Loop Course. The Du Pont Company's grant of $4,CWO will be used for the ad- vancement of teaching in chem- istry and other fields. It consists of $25{)0 for chemistry teaching and $1500 for other courses. The DuPont program of educational aid. established in 1953, is award- ed to private colleges on the basis of their excellent records in the field of chemical education. Union was one of the 73 institutions to receive this grant. The 195S grants mark the sixth consecutive year that the 'College has been so hon- ored.

Dr. Peter Sykowski:s gift was made to Union's Willis R. Whit- ney Scholarship Fund. The fund started by Dr. Sykowski on Aug- ust 22, 1956 has now attained its final goal of $10,000. The donor expressed the hope that the fund would encourage deserving young men to enter into scientific re- search and \vould assist them. in their studies. It will be awarded for the first time next spring to a deserving student of the class of 1962. , by tlte council. P.rofessor William W.

Dr. John Iwanik, Assistant Professor of Spanish and Russian, .has edited a collection of sh01't stories in Russian for class reading on the intermediate level. He first had ·' the idea of selecting a num- ber of short stories suitable for language - teaehing pur- poses and editing and annot- ating them for class use nearly ten years ag(). \While the n·umber of students studying .the Russian language in the United States is small, tech- nological and political develop- ments suggest that it is going :to increase sharply a.nd there will be aii increasing need for care- fully prepared grammars anq readers on the elementary an<l intermediate levels,\ Professor Iwanik said in discussing his new book.

Are we veering too greatly in a tecllll<>logical direc- tion to the disadvantage of the liberal arts? Are we for- getting the essential humanistic base necessary for ·scien- tists and technicians as well as everyone else? ·we must not lose this base in the sudden rush to technology, for the rapidly growing demand for scientists could conceivably lead to the development of technologists without wisd,om and without concern for human issues. Dr. Henry T.

To reach the aim of better edu- cation, we cannot concentrate on a few s~holarships or special projects alone. We must revise our basic thinking towards education. Attitudes towards tea()hers and the teaching profession in general must be changed. Salal'ies must be raised and new classrooms built. F1nally, student potentialities must be mo1·e fully realized.

Graubart & Sons U.S. Enrollment Paradox By Lynn Ratner \A sucyrising shot\tage of stu- dents is hitting many 'U. ·s. col- lE'ges.\ Such was the claim made by the Wall Street Journal in an article on December 26, 1957. Here at Union. where the ratio of apP'Iicants to those wW.o are accepted is usually large, we may lose sight of the enrollment situ- ation at other institutions. As deseribed by the Journal's eye- raising survey, this situation is extremely parad·oxical when ex- amined in the light of today's \tidal wave\ of .college applica- tions. The at\ticle went on to say that \some admission deans are bol- stering ski..tl:J,py freshman enroll- ments by lowering\ entrance .re- quirements and recruiting stu- dents who barely eked ~hrough high school.\ .At Union such is apparently not the case. In order to acce'Pt the most a.ble students-Union has, in fact, decided 't<J tighten its ad· mission requirements. In addi- tion to the custo-mary Scholastic .Aptitude Test, the class of 19'62 must take three a.<:hiev:ement teste of the College :Entrance Examin- ation.

Union is a small college and, as such, attempts to main- tain an intimate faculty-student relationship. In adjusting the pro- gram at Union the administration does not wish to destroy 'the \small college atmosphere.\ The fact that there will be more stu- dents per faculty member is un- deniable, however.

The catch in this app·ar- ently rosy plan is that the stu- dent will have to assume a .great deal of the responsibility involved in directing his education. Charles Cole, President--of Aln- herst College, has stated that in the near future students will have to be \turned loose.\ Some stu- dents will simply J.\Un wild under these circumsbances. The fac!llty member will not be a policerrum who directs the student's evew move by giving him informatior:t and then examining him to see if he has memorized it. Instead, the student will have to mal1e some of his own decisions based will return to Union next fall as an Assistant Pr()ofessor of Physics. The appointment was announced today by President Carter David- son. Mr. Henr)\ f()rm-erly of East Orange, Ne1v Jersey, was a. top honor man in Union's class of 1954, gra(},uating with a B.
