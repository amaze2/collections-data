This time, the Student Council recognized the problem and tried to put some tacks on a few Reats in an attempt to get something done about it. We feel that action on this ques- tion is highly desirable, but we hope that the entil·e matter is approached in the right wu;{ In an October 21 editorial it was suggested that lack of HPC action on the subject was due cause for Student Council action. We can only hope, h9wever, that the Council does not take steps which will convert the problem into a Student Council-House Pres·idents Council dispute such as that which attencled the last ru~hing referendum. Recognition of the existence or a dirty rushing problem vvas the first step. The next mo\e is up to the IIPC. 'We feel that dirty rushing is pl'imm·ily a fratemity problem and should be handled by the house presidents. If they decline to act ag-ain, however, the Student Council will have to investigate the situation on its own. Ivy Efforts to Continue Apparently, much work remains to he done if the Little Ivy League is ever to become a reality. Clarification is needed of the principles behind the proposed association of small colleges. A system w11l have to be worked out for awarding the potted ivy plant, and for making sure that it gets from one year's winner to the next. Another probl~m confronting the final establishment of the league is tht: opposition of some schools. Hamilton and Hobart seem to have cliametrically opposite points of vie\v- regarding Little Iv~·. \Vhile Hobart seems to be all for it, Hamilton feels that, \joining a little Ivy League would place upon football an overemphasis that we feel has never been in evidence at Hamilton.\ Probablv the best chance for formation of the league rests with U~e policy set forth in an Octohpr 21 C'oncorrliensis editorial. \Thet·e is no reason wh~· the Little Ivy plant cannot be passed on frorh season to season among the un- official champiQn of the small schools of the region, with a minimum of ballyhoo marking· its travel. We ask for no forrnaJ bonds between the schools, but only request that the competition be conducted among them in the same spirit that governs their meetings on the football field.\ Perhaps the rpeeting of the editors of the three schools tomorrow will clear the air for further prog-ress along the line of making the Little Ivy League a reality. Watch Where the Roses Go The ROTC prom committee has acted wisely in rein- stituting the customary method of choosing a Queen. We are not sticklers for tradition, but we do ask that when tradition is chang-ed, that it be a change fol\ the bettter. The system which the committee previously initiated was deeid- edly not so. The one remaining problem is the haphazard distribu- tion of roses by the .iudges m an attempt to quickly f1·ee themselves of their obligation. We trust that Messrs. Ford, Gibbons, and Weiss will not fall prey to this shirking of responsibility. Wheels to Williamstown Although few people were interested enough to take a bus to Williamstown last week, a caravan of cars wended its way east from Schenectady and, as a result, there was a good sized Union contingent .at the game. Since there were many Fnion men present in spite of the fact that there was no bus, we suggest that the prerequisite for being excused from Saturday 11 o'clock class to attend away football games be changed from a bus ticket to a ticket of admission to the game.

W·e feel that a balanced colle;:;e should have a bu:an~e.d cultural prograrr. In order to have a bn.lanced cultural pro- grilln the admi·nistration, .rather than tbe students, shouid set the intellectual level at which to aim. Although the Friday night film series is highly entertaining to both college students and children of the faculty, it is a far ery from \a really good series of fo-reign movies\ as was suggested by the President ih a letter to the Editor of the Concordi.ensis publis):J.ed April 29, 1955. Even before the student body l€arned of this film series there was a front page story in the ·September 30 issue of the Concol'd(Y entitled \Paisan Opens Film Series Tonight at Museum; Union Stu- dents May Purchase Tickets at the Door.\ A WC'ek before the opening of the campus film series, two of the identical Chaplin c om e d i e s were ~een by some interested stu- dents at the Schenectady Museum. Although some of the students have been members of Freedom Forum since their freshman year, the college this year has decided to support that civic minded or- ganizat-ion by purchasing 50 student tickets. This was rnade known to the stud~nt body after those inter- estc>d membt'l's had already pur- {'haserl their tickPts at $2 apiece. Is this to take the place of the evening lecture series which the college has sponsored during the past few years? \-\'\ think the IRC is one group on campus which is helping to give the students a cultural background outside the classroom. However, the constitution of the International Relations Club limits the type of speaker they can bring to the .stu- dent body. To date this organiza- tion has had two high caliber speal1ers. But they cannot be ex- pected to bring to the students programs ·by good rr.usical and dramatic perform~rs from outside the campus. \Ve feel that Union CollegP, rather than such places as a public high school, ,;hould be U1e le-ader of intellectual life in the commu- nity. The college seem:> to be hav- ing ·excellent \town and, .gown\ relationships but we feel that ~he cultural life is stimulated by the town, whilP .the gown is taking a back seat. < Richard W. Antemann '56 Chat·ies G. Carl '57 * -l(· * To the Editor of the Concordiensis: During the ·past six weeks the freshm.an cl!!.ss has suffered the in ell uity of having to fortify itself with food served in the West Col- lege dining room. Eight times. each w.eek, we have shuffled into the dining room, inch- ed nungrily forward on line fbr seve-ral minutes, and th.en .to our usual disma:r sadly si;ghted the Spanish rice, Salisbury steak, or macaroni (with or with<>ut saus~­ ges). Occa;sionally lhe m-enu of· fered such. items as turkey or roast meat but, unfortunately, .these .oc- casions were few. I am enough of an ex:Pert on food to know that age does not improve its flavqr, Last .Saturday's lunch, for example, was well aged. It included macaroni from the day before, libera.Jly do\\-·sed vdth to- mato sauce and topped with a lonely looking sausage. Those stu- dents unfortu·nate enougn to come late to lunch dined on a plate of chili con came that had made its first appearance two days previous- ly. Other p()Ot' meals in the past have included dried out chicken, beef or tuna fish pies, I have enjoyed several meals at the cafeteria in Hu.le House and I hea:rtily recommend that those responsible for West College food try eating a meal there (providing, of co·urse, they are not eating there already). For me to suggest any possible improvements to thvse who try to run West Co.lle.ge dining facilities would be hypocritical because I do not confess to be fully awa:re of all the facts a·nd figures. I do however:, hope that their discretion will prompt them to ser.vo better food. Bruce Hauptman. '59.

To the Editor of the Concordiensis: Last week in the doncordy, we were treated to one freshman's first · literary contri'bution to Union Col- lege. To those of lis that 'have been here for the pa.st three years, it was an old story-the story of 'a boy, shortly out of high school, and . still. unable to make the change to a new and different situation. Each year there is someone, and to those that have gone before, let , me assure you that after having worked at West College ·and eaten bhere for my entire college career, the food has never been better. The purpose of this letter then is to vindicate those people who have been attacked, namely Peter Shas- kavitch, the chef, and Mrs. Leger, the manager. The cleanliness, bhe attitude, and whole feeling of those who prepare tl::\e food is of the highest caliber. The chef has long been known on Lake George for his work in the large resort hotels . there. ture man, you are supposed to show her a good time ln a Little Ivy 'League school. 'To do this! does not require an .ex:.cess of drinking; it does not require a milk can of drink at the ga;rne, nor does it require a general show of incon- tvolability. '1n general; this is a .plea to make this a wee]tend where respect is shown fov oar dates and our school. The liquor l:aw:;; were set u,p on a personal responsibility basis. Not all Qf us are men capable of handling this respollsibility, and .since there are boys ·among .us, let's get togebhel' this weeke11d to live up to what we said w•e would do two years ago \\hen the open liquor rules were estab- lished, and be as mature as is \en- joyably possible.\ Stephen Holbrook '56 President of the Student Council Garnet Photos () 0 0 0 FRESIDIAN STAFF Monlecai Braunstein, Robert Deming, Michael Enzer, Jerrold Fleisher., Leo I•~rilschler, Peter Goldfine, Arnold Goldschlager, William Gross, Anthony Guidare!li, Kenneth Hasson, Bruce Haupman, Kenneth Hoyt, Robert Kessler, Robert Eline, John Kovacilt, Irwin Lunianski, Robert Sallick, Gerald Selkowitz, Stefan Stein, James Swan, Richard Russack, l'aul Jarvis.

Finkel, Robert Gordon. \What Makes Sammy Run\ A lesson in practical politics of a nature not ordinarily encountered in the government classroom was granted the Concordiensis em·lie1· this week as the Schenectady mayor- alty campaign progressed toward election day. Perhaps the best way to relate the events of the week, as they concerned the newspaper, is through the 1·eproduction of an article ·which appeared on Page 12 of the Schenectady Gazette, Tuesday, Novembe1· 8, under the headline: \College Paper Has Not Indorsed Stratton: Editor.\ Any comments that we have to offer on its suujed or the personality most di- rectly concerned are more properly included at the conclusion of its text. The article 1·ead: \Samuel S. Stratton, Democratic-Liberal candidate for mayor, lnJ.s not been indorsed by the Concordiensis, Union College student weekly, the editor-in-chief, Jerrold I. Hirsch,. en, stressed in a letter to the editor of the Gazette yesterday. \Hir.schen wrote: 'A political advertisement supporting Samuel S. Stratton for ma.ror of Schenectady appeared on page 1() of the Gazette yesterday, November 7. Undemeath a picture of Mr. Stratton and his family was printed an ex- cerpt attributed to the Union College Concordiensis of Oc- tober 28 which \vould imply that newspaper's backing of Stratton's candidacy. It said: Sam Stratton has all the qualifications for the type of mayor the city of Scheneetady n~ds-political lmowledg·e, youth, ideas, understanding, and a keen awareness of the interests of the people of Schenet:- tady. \ •True this was printed on page 2 of the Concordiensis of that date, but as Mr. Stratton's. supporters neglected to menti<rn, it was part of a symposium on the Schenee.tady elections compiled uy students in government classes at the college, and in no way reflected the editorial opinion of the newspaper as the quoted statement seeks to suggest. \ 'The editor of the C'on.cordiensis attached an intro- duction to the s.ymposium to guard against such a misundel'- standing. Thus before the series of articles in which Dwight Ball's analysis of Samuel Stratton's candidacy was included, there was this paragraph: The Coneordiensis presents in these columns a survey of the candidates for mayor and city coundl of Srhenectady in the coming elections. All articles were written by students in Government 48 and Goveninent 12 with the opinions expressecl being solely those of the authol\s Out· editorial policy has had no influence on either the positive or negative tone that they may take. \ 'That same series of m}icles began with a sketch of Henry G. Pfeil, the Republican candidate for• Mayor of Sche- nectady, written by John Davidson. Davidson, also a govern- ment student, said in 1mrt: As a man I feel that Mr. Pfeil is well qualified as Mayor of Schenectady_ and could do a competent job •.. If Mr. Pfeil is elected, he will probably conduct it that way-a good sound government quietly and efficently run with a minimum o.f fanfare.' \ l\lr. Stratton did nothing illegal in quoting the passage from the symposium article. His was, in fact, a common practie.e. A practice employed regularly when a Broadway show about to fold seeks to glean any sentence of a favor- able nature from the disheartening reviews that accompanied its opening, and features them in advertisements. Both are blatant forms of misrepresentation! J. I. H. The paradox is, that the food which is extolled is that served by the fo=er management of West •College. This food is also good, but how ironic to those of us who re- member the fa m o u s Orange Squeeze, and its events which re- sulted in the rerr.oval of this ma!IJagement for the same reason. I do not ask for a public apology, but a private word to the chef would do a great deal toward re- pairing the injury to one man who is completely devoted to his worlt, and feels that a part of him goes into each boy that be feeds at West College. This kind of chef is the exception to the common rule of greasy, watery, impersonal cooks that are so common to all of us, and his kindness has been witness- ed by many of the freshmen who have come to know him. * * * Secondly and separately: This is the first prom weekend since I assumed office, and I would like to point out something that I feel needs restating, A prom weekend is a time of honor for the girl whom you have aske{l.

We've tried to help both the an- nually changing freshman orienta- tion groups and the Delphics pro- vide their greatest service to the college; we've tried to help to speed their declines. There have been other wholesome propositions and we've sought to become reli- able reading matter for all the family. Quite safe, shouldn't you say? But, 0, modesty permits us to say no more. Now., alas, we break with tl'adi- tion. We drop the quiet pose, merely an affectation anyway, and become regular just like you-it is prom titr. e, why not? This week, too, we give up the long sought after family trade and ask that the follov.ing bombastic few inches be read only by adults and sophisticated teenagers as y;ell as Union men under direct adult su- pervision. Not to imply, of course\'; that Un- ion men are not adult in many ways; they are adult in too many '\'lays, hence tlie need for super- VISlon. But that is not of which we write. or any party at an eastern school goes and the -way it ought to. Our only complaint is the trustee's putting one of the hest and most enjoyable pleasures of undergradu- ate life in a rather special cate- gory, Its indulgence is thought of as. some sort of C()ncession or favor to the students. The fact it seems to us is tl;lat these spirits are the prime means of relaxation for the intellectual , or <Lt least intelligent type personality. It is not only all right, it Is best that alcohol be the theme of every party. We say theme, not plot or argument, we all know what that is. You can have your recre- ation, we'll take just .a little more relaxation. ... Another prom. party fallacy, no pun intended, is the great import- ance of sex to having a good time. It is all right, but who needs it? Consider, if you Will, the negative nature of this so much discussed subject. It is little more than an unadjusted refusal to participate in group acti'Vities. A1; it .is practised at Union, our subject is representa- tive of - the great dealine which college students all over the coun- try are experiencing. There was a time (but now Its all gone by) When one wild young bla.de would secretly engage in a limited amount of oral contact with t'he young lady in his compan-y-but he would hurry back to the dance floor· quite promptly so that his fellow students could have every oppor- tunity for, as gentlemen, \cutting in\ on his d<Lte.

Graubart & Sons The Perfect Place for the Perfect Diamond In the highest circle of Union are a grcmp of very good a:nd very sober men who eontrol the undergraduate destinies of all of us. They permit prom woeekends. In this as in all :matters, they are above reproach. After a busy political campaign, sUch a terri- ble rush, statements, pictures and more commehts, they turn wearily to very old Union and watch their children tear the place to pieces. This is done in many ways but often involved are certain grain spirits willich are here with the full knowledge of the aforemen- tioned political figures. We mean not to criticize the system. It quite honestly does not affect us at all. How-ever some basic dif- ferences would be welcome: First. a re<:Qgnization of the fact that it is not the dance or the football game that are the good time, though both are fine-<we favor t.he latter. It is tl:i.e spirits not the Spirit that cause the cheers. This is the way a Union party In t):le good old days, 3.!1 histori- cal period which took place be- fore most.· of US' \vere born, people reaognized the sorry state they, as the nation's· youth, were in.

SKYPATH FOR WORDS AND PICTURES Pictured here is one of the many sta- tions in the Bell System's new nation~ wide radio relay system for beaming telephone calls and telecasts coast 1o coast. It is Western Electric's responsi- bility to make and install the complex electronic equipment needed. This is another example of our job, as the manufacturing and supply unit of the Bell System, to provide the thousands of things that make good telephone service possible. It's a job that presents an unending challenge to our engineer- ing staff. DI~ECT DISTANCE DIALING Modifying telephone systems for nation-wide dialing requires months of ma:ke-ready. Working with tech- nical men from Bell Laboratories and Bell telephone companies, Westerp. Eiectric engineers develop and plan the manufacture arid installiltion of the intricate equipment needed for change-overs. Shown here is an automatic switching. bay being manufactured ih one·of Western's 16 plants. So Ia hetra- he,gin fa. Stock up 0 ~ -l:l)at good Schaefel' brew-!\ THE f, & M. SCHAEFER BREWING.

Ed has been termed loyal, wise, and unselfish by Hal Van de Car; he has been praised by Irving Marsh of the New York Herald Tribune; and he has been toasted and feted by Union alumni at a dinner held in New York City. At this time next year there will be no speeches about Ed, there will be no ceremonies in his honor. He will be gone from Union and another man will have taken his place, Ed's successor will have just -completed his first foot- ball season with the Garnet. He will be a younger man. And his formal training for the job he holds will just. as surely be greater than Ed's, He may use newer and better equip- ment. He might perform his every task in a more precise, scientific manner; the product of his academic training. He might even quit wastiing all the tape that Ed used as a psychological weapon to protect his boys from. injury. In all, he will most likely have a head start over h1s predeces- S()r. Why he might even be a college grad I Ed never went to college and whatever he has learned has been gleaned fmm lessons in \the school of hard knocks.\ But the men who follow Ed. will have to strain to equal the j()b he did. He has been mote to his athletes than simply a man to teach them and patch them. His quick .smile and sage advice have made Ed more of a symbol than an employee. The work that he has done for Union and those who have studied and played here, cannot be measured; l,mt neither can it be forgotten. N.H.R. Politics and Education \Vith the effo1·ts of .Mr. Pacelli, t~eproduced in another column on this page, demanding answer. post-mortems on the Schenectady elections must take precedence in our editorial columns for yet another week. The crux of l\'Ir, Pacelli's. argument would api)ear to center around a belief that politics and education do not mix, particularly in the case of President Carter Davidson of Union and the city of Schenectady, New York. Our correspondent even goes so far as to address \a word of warning\ to the subject of his epistle. Fear not, Dr. Davidsotl, the pages of history stand behind you! Rather than simply present an abstract negation to Mr. Pacelli's note, we will afford our:>elves the privilege of quot- ing and citing past links l>etween fhe two disciplines whose present connection he has objecte'Cl to. The most naive among us would assume that Mr. Pacelli's p<Jlitical leanings are in the direction of the donkey, so why not begin with one of the greatest of the Democratic Party? Surely all have heard mention of an educator by the name of Wilson, or Woodrow to his friends. That august authority, The Encyclopedia Britannica notes on page 633 of Volume 23, the most recent one on the shelves of our library, that \while at Princeton, both as professor and as president. Wilson displayed great interest in politic:;~;] questions of the day, and through his addresses and articles speedily won a national reputation.\ . · Let that suffice as our lesson from the not so dim past! Certainly the memories of the 1Q52 presidential c~rnpaign remain with us if we are to judge by the reception and comment granted the announcement this week by one of the protagonists in that engagement that he would try again in 1956. The name of Harry J. Carman was as familiar in educational circles when Stevenson and Eisenhower first met as it is today when he grants our campu~ the honor of his presence and judgment on occasion. We surmise that Mr. Pacelli is unaware of the fact that Carman, Dean Emeritus of Columbia College and Moore Collegiate Professor of His- tory, was reported in Th~ New York Times of October 16, 1952 as having made .public a statement supporting- Dwight D. Eisenhower for president.
