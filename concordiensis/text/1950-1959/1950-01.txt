The three that will remain occupied are Wildwood, Seneca and Elmwood. Mohawk will house part of the Character Research project and Beaver will remain vacant. Mr. Mciiwaine also said that four of the five dorms will probably be re- moved as soon as the proposed freshman dorm is completed al- though there are no definite plans at present. The Characte1· Research project will probably keep Mohawk until' a more suitable place can -be found. THE COLLEGE has n'o definite plans for the removal of Dutch- man's Village although part of it may be rerroved next summer. There will be no other face lifting projects except for-the removal of Dewey hell which VI ill geo next summer. Some time in the future the mess hall, the library annex, all of Dutchman's Village and the pasture dorms will be removed. Dr. Ernest Ligon said that the Character Research project's mov- ing into Mohawk is not as a means of expansion but is as a matter of necessity. Dr. Ligon said presently there are 40 people on the staff and \about half of them are work- ing in the library annex. These people will probably move into Mohawk about Mar. 1, 1950.

Assuming that the dormitories, dining hall, and bookstore should break about even, • {most colleges consider dorill,itories as an investment and expect a reasonable return), there are fhe following educational expenses to be paid (in round figures): Faculty salaries ......... . Administrative salaries ... . General expenses ........ . Library .................. . Buildings and Grounds ... . Intercollegiate Athletics .. $605,000 125,000 105,000 60,000 250,000 45,000 To~al .................... $1,190,000 Toward this expense Union students (including extension and summer school students) paid approximately $810,000 for instruction. Much of this, in 1948-49, was paid by the Federal government. Where was the other $380,000 secured'? Primarily from the in- . come on some $7,000,000 in endowment funds given to the college by former students and friends during the years past and held in trust for the benefit of today's students. In addition, approximately $5,00G-,OOO has been given by these friends to build the buildings which you use. A 5% depreciation charge is certainly small as a \use ex- pense,\ adding another $250,000 each year to the benefits accorded Union students. . In other words, over and ,beyond any cash payments received by the College for tuition from students and the government, approxi- mately $630,000 is expended each year for education-a gift of over $400 to every student who attends the college. Just remember this, the ne:xt time you pay a tuition bill. CARTER DAVIDSON 'Snowball', Cancer Benefit, to Feature Elgart Orchestra By Jay Cohn Union's annual winter prom, the \Snowball to be held on Feb. 24 for the benefit of the Damon Runyon :Memorial Cancer Fund, will feature the music of Les Elgart and his orchestra, it has been announced by the prom committee. -® WITH the hope that the idea of benefit dances will \snowball\ through other colleges, the com- mittee has selected the slogan \Snow Under Cancer,\ and all profits of the formal will be given to the Runyon Fund, which is leading the fight against that deadly disease. Chapel Friday, Jan. 27 at 10 a.m.,------------------------------- In choosing the Elgart band, the committee, headed by William Van Ost and Harry Petrak, followed the general campus opinion that prom- goers would rather have the sweet, danceable music of a capable or- ganization than the rhythms of a big-name hand. Elgart has stressed the slow ballads since he organized his group in 1944 and has attained a top for the soft, stylish music that college groups like. He fea- tures the original arrangements of Bill Finnegan, the songs of Mary Bennett and his own brilliant trumpet solos. Dr. Henry T.

Simmons Named Idol Editors Riemer, Concordy, The Union College Publications board has announced the appoint of Wolfgang J. Riemer as editor of The Con- cordiensis and Howard A. Simons as editor of The IdoL These appointments become effective at the beginning of the new term in February. ---------------- ~ BOTH James Murray, resigning Treasurer Honored By \Who's Who\ A special citation from the edi- tors of \\Vho's Who in Americn\ has been awarded to Frank Bailey, Union '85, treasurer of the collPge since 1901, for \extraordinary serv- ice and benefaction\ to the college. ANNOUNCEMENT of the award, one of those presented annually for unusual service to an ilnstitution of higher learning, was made by Carter Davidson at a dinner last week in honor of Mr. Bailey's 85th birthday. Mr. Bailey, former president of the Title Guat·antee and Trust com· pany, New York city, was born in Chatham, N.Y., the son of a coun- try doctor. He entereq Union on scholarship in 1881. WHEN be became treasurer .Jf Union College in 1901, the college had an endowment of $500,000. Mr. Bailey agreed to take the position of treasurer only upon the strict condition that the institution live within its income, \even if that in- come is only ten cents,\ as he once put it to a friend. head of the campus paper, and Clarkson Potter, former. editor of the college literary magazine, have declared personal reasons to be the cause of the early retirements. New appointments for posts on col- lege publications are generally made late in the spring of each year. The present appointments ex- pire in April, 1950. Other new appointments made ir.clude James Dorill as managing editor of the Idol, and Jay Cohn. Martin Siegel and Willard Taylor as page editors on the senior board of the Concordiensis. Donald Sohwartz was named acting sports editor of the paper. RJEMER of the class of '51, was former managing editor of the paper and is also manager of the cross country team. Simons, also '51, former managing editor of the Idol is active in the Mountebanks. The present system of senior and junior boards used on the Concordy, will continue with the junior board acting as the proving ground for prospective members of the senior group.

THE COUNCIL voted to send a letter of protest to President Davidson urging him to reinstate the lost credits. The letter will be presented by Thomas Elliott. Van Ost was again on the coun- cil floor to present plans for the winter prom. He announced that due to union rules a \name band'' cannot play without pay even though the dance is a benefit. Van Ost said however that Les Elgart had agreed to bring his orchestra to Union for a \very low pt·ice.\ Elgart will reduce his J.eader's fee so that greater revenue can go into the cancer fund. It is helieved that the agent who is making the arrangements will also reduce his commission fee. The Delphic so- ciety has already given fifty dollars to the prom committee, Van Ost announced. A freshman orientation commit- tee was appointed to work with Mr. Wilford Ketz on improving the student handbook and orientation lectures given to new students. The student advisor or \big brother\ system will also be re-vitalized. COUNCIL president James Cour- ter selected Martin :Mandel to re· place David Martin, who is gradu- ating, as a senior class representa- tive.

Plans were also laid for class day exercises and a semi-formal dance for graduation weekend. THE CLASS tax is the first voted by a senior class at Union since the end of the war. The income will cover all the expenses for the graduation weekend festivities and any additional costs for mailing information to the class members next term. Class Day activities will he held on the Friday before graduation, probably in Jacksons Gardens. and will be followed on the next night by the dance at the Van Curiel' hotel. The orchestra has yet to be announced. A RECORD number of 275 sen- iors, approximately two-thirds of the class attended the meeting.

Note:-The following editorial by retiring Editor James Murray is written primarily for liberal arts students in general and Union CollPge libe•·al at'ts students in particular.) There is growin()' agitation around campus for return to the honor system~ The small group ~f men in ~he ad- ministration, faculty, and student body who propose It know the experiment was tried at Union be~ore .and stopped at the behest of students themselves, but tlunk 1t could and should work here now. I agree the honor system is highly desirable and has worked in other colleges; but I believe it can wo1·k here only after more fundamental reforms have been made. An honor system implies self-reliance; it implies ac- ceptance of responsibility; what is more, this self-reliance is intellectual and moral. As the college is constructed today, attainment of this goal is impossible because of tendencies in the other extreme, dependence. It is impracticable to have an honor system on one hand which depends on self-reliance and a compulsive system on the other which relies on dependence. Attitude Carry-Over If the two systems were in effect jointly, the honor system would fail. Students would carry over attitudes which they now have into the new system. Because of the testing methods, compulsory class attendance, compulsory chapel attendance, all students not bothered by a conscience (and most can rationalize it away) now feel justified in beating the proctor system with crib notes, getting to know professors so they can get excuses from class attendance, getting chapel slips sneaked in at the end of the term. When they can beat the system they are smart; but whether th~y beat it or not, it is worth trying. After all, it's a game, much like playing the pin~ball machine. There is nothing \\Tong with rocking the machine back and forth if it doesn't tilt and you might profit from it. The mere presence of the proctor indicates that one is not to be trusted, so you might as well resign yourself to being untrustworthy and play the game with him. lf he lights tilt, you lose everything; it's a gamble you take but it involves no moral question. This attitude would carry over to the honor system because all other phases of the institution still would point to the individual's untrustworthiness in acquiring education. If the student were still required to attend classes, whether they were profitable or not; if he was still required to attend chapel whether interested in the \culture\ or not, if he were still required to take a certain number of hour exams, a certain number of quizzes each term to keep progress at the minimum required, this would all indicate the unwilling- ness of the college to let the students assume responsibility. Therefore, cheating would increase under the honor system because the system would be incompatible with the rest of the set-up. One would carry the old attitude of resentment into the new system and even those plague-ridden with conscience would soon rationalize their way out. Guilt would not enter in. Maximum Freedom-Minimum Restriction A student in college should have the maximum amount of freedom within a minimum amount of administrative restriction. He should be able to live in an intellectual· atmosphere where he is besieged on all sides by ideas, no matter how radical. He should be able to work his own rhythm, without delays by lazy professors or needless ex- aminations. He should be free to come to class if the pro .. fessor is worth hearing and to skip class if the professor is in a mental tor:por, as many are. Instead of the :professor !Jeing .merely .a stepping-stone to reality, he should exploit mcent1ves wh1ch would allow the student to soar in intel- lectual pursuits connected with the professor's field. In other words, all efforts should be funneled toward student self-reliance. That would be an intellectual democracy, which· seems to me a pre-requisite of social democracy if the· latter is not to be charged with hypocl'isy. This does not mean to say that social life is not important; just not all-important. standards. It s~ould keep astride of its top scholars.

Education and Self-Reliance (Ed. :-.ote:-Tlw !'nllowing editorial by reti1·ing Editor James Murray is wriUt>n prima1·ily for liberal arts student!:i in general and t:nion Cullegt• liberal a1·ts students in particula.I',) There is growing agitation m·ound campus for return to the honor system. The small group of men in the ad- ministration, faculty, and student body who p1·opose it know the experiment was tried at Union beiore and stopped at the behest of students themselves, but think it could and should work here now. I agree the honor system is highly desirable and has \Vorked in other colleg·es; but I believe it can work here only after more fundamental 1·eforms have been made. An honor system implies self-reliance; it implies ac- ceptance of responsibility; what is more, this self-reliance is intellectual and moral. As the college is constructed today, attainment of this goal is impossible because of tendencies in the other extreme, dependence. It is impracticable to have an honor system on one hand which depends on self-reliance ami a compubiYe system on the other which relies on dependence. Attitude Carry-Over If the two systems were in effect jointly, the honor system would fail. Students would carry over attitudes which they now have into the new system. Because of the testing metlwtls, compulsory class attendance, compulsory dwpel attendance, all students not bothered by a conscience (and must can rationalize it away) now feel justified in beating the proctor system with criu notes, getting to know professors su they can get excuses from class attendance, getting chapel slips sneaked in at the end of the term. When tlwy can beat the system they al'e smart; but whether they heat it or not, it is worth trying. After all, it's a game, much like playing the pin-ball machine. There is nothing wrong with rocldng the machine back and forth if it doesn't tilt and ~·ou might profit from it. The mere presence of the proctor indicates that one is not to be trusted, so you might as well resign yourself to being untrustworthy and play the game with him. If he lights tilt, you lose everything; it's a gamble you take but it involves no moral question. This attitude would carry over to the honor system because all other phases of the institution still would point to the individual's untrustworthiness in acquiring education. 1 f the student we1'e still required to attend classes, whether they were profitable or not; if he was still required to attend chapel whether interested in the \culture\ or not, if he were still required to take a certain number of hour exams, a certain number of quizzes each term to keep progress at the minimum required, this would all indicate the unwilling- ness of the college to let the students assume responsibility. Therefore, cheating would increase under the honor system because the system would be incompatible with the rest of the set-up. One would carry the old attitude of resentment into the new system and even those plague-ridden with conscience would soon rationalize their way out. Guilt would not enter in. Maximum Freedom-Minimum Restriction A student in college should have the maximum amount of freedom within a minimum amount of administrative restriction. He should be able to live in an intellectual atmosphere where he is besieged on all sides by ideas, no matter how radical. He should be able to work his own rhythm, without delays by lazy professors or needless ex- aminations. He should be free to come to class if the pro- fessOl' is worth hearing· and to sldp class if the professor is in a mental torpor, as many are. Instead of the professor being merely a stepping-stone to reality, he should exploit incentives which would allow the student to soar in intel- lectual pursuits connected with the professor's field. In other words, all efforts should be funneled toward student self-reliance. That would be an inte1lectual democracy, which seems to me a pre-requisite of social democracy if the latter is not to be charged with hypocrisy. This does not mean to say that social life is not important; just not all-important. . Of cours~, ~h~ majority of students prefer col1lege as it 1~ today,, a frmshmg school, because they do not want to iace reality. That does not wanant the college lowering its standards. It si:ould keep astride of its top scholars. If the other men are. m college oNly to learn social niceties, they s)1~uld .no~ .be m. college. I sa~· this with ::n extremely prac- tic<tl.

Michurin was not a scientifically trained man but a plant hybridizer THE NEW SOVIET genetiC's p_mceeds upon two main assump- tiOns: <1) that acquired characters are hereditary and (2) that veo-eta- tive hybrids are a fact. If these statements are true, they are of transcendent importance. Ashby, a well-lmown English experimental botanist has made a special study of the experiments of the Lysenlw school. He states, \There is no recor~ of a single statistically valid expertment. There is complete ab- sence of suitable controls.\ O~e wond~r~ how present day Soviet genebctsts explain the in- heritance of ordinary colorblind- ness or the difference in the sex- linked transmission of colorblind- n~ss or hemophilia as compared w1th the non-sex-linlred transmis- sion of albinism. And hc•w, for ex- ?-mple, w~ll they explain the pecul· mr relahons and transmission of the 0, A, B, and AB blood types? Or what will the Soviet thinkers do with the facts of linkage and crossingover? And so ad infinitum. THE SIMPLE questions I have just propounded are the ordinary grist of the chromosome theory of heredity but they would almost ·certainly make a devotee of Ly- senko's genetics break out in a copious sweat. In view of the statements I have quoted from Lysenko it will hardly come as a surprise that the Prae- sidium of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Science pledged itself in a letter to Stalin \to toot out unpatriotic ideal- ist Weismannite-Morgailist ideol- ogy/' i.e., the chromosome theory of heredity. FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 1950 THE REST IS SILENCE By DAVE MARKSON Culture is a pretty difficult thing to define. There is, however, one thing which can be said about it in general, and that is that it's too good for people. I came to this conclusion, which has been germinating in my fertile brain for a couple of years now, after viewing the Van. ~ogh exhibit in New York city during the recent vacation. The exhtbtt, I found, was magnificent; but remaining there to look at it for any length of time, I found, was unbearable. I CAN EXPLAIN myself most simply, i.f it doesn't appear too pretentious, by borrowing a Hne from Mr. T. S. Eliot: \In the room the women come and go Tal'king of Michaelangelo .. .'' Substitute the name of Van Gogh for that of the Italian master, and although you'll disturb Mr. Eliot's meter, you'H find the whole trouble expressed quite perfectly. The Van Gogh exhibition was jammed, from morning to night, by thousands of borish pretenders who made it almost impossible for · anyone to take any pleasure in the artist's work. It was bad enough to be shoved from room to room by the many hundreds who had paid their half-a-buck and were rusing from one picture to the next for the sole purpose of being able to inform their friends that they had seen the show; but it was even worse getting jammed into a corner where two or three women were holding a dmmatic debate over the advis- ability of purchasing a certain reproduction to match a certain green rug or a set of orange slip-covers. I DON'T CLAI~I, of course, that the greatness of Van Gogh is something which I alone can comprehend. But I do have a certain basic appreciation of the stuff, and I get a ·big boot out of simply standing there and looking-with my big mouth kept shut when it is obvious that I would be making a fool out of myself by saying any- thing. I get the same pain in the neck at a movie like \Hamlet let us say, when I get stuck behind some character who has read the play once, in his high school days, and then proceeds to offer an idiotic and superficial running commentary to his feeble-minded girlfriend throughout the picture. I haven't an:y solution to the problem, mind you, and I'm sure it will always exist as long as artists are forced to create their stuff for this materialistic and unappreciative society of ours. I'm simply stating it, and 1•epeating that people, especially phonies lilre most of those at the exhibit, make me sick.
