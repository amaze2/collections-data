This hour is not long enough to get much studying donE>, especially when you deduct time for a round trip to thP lihrary and perhaps n few moments of inspil'ing intellectual dialogue with n fellow erudite scholar. THE SUGGESTION which I propose is to drop in and listen to some of the better lectures. Even in four years, you can not tal'e all the choice courses. Most professors are willing to admit self invited guests. Advantages: 1. No quizzes, hour tests, term papers, or final exams. 2. There is often a good show. 3. You might learn something. E. L.

I wouldn't want to think that the Concordy is atempt- ing to smear campaign at the -oficers of their sister publication, The Idol. The problem of semantics and philology and plain speling is a dificult one.

TilE GARNI<~T cagers. behind only 24-29 at halftime saw their de- fe~~e collapse e:1I'ly in the second h!(lf, and were never in the game aftet· that. Dick Davis, who with Ray Pomet·oy, was pacing the Un- ion attack in the first half, was tossed out of the game early in the second half for protesting too ve- hemently over the r·eferee's deci- sions, or lack of them. The Nistad-men jumped off to a 3-0 lead on a free throw by Pome- roy and a tap-In by. Spen Warnick. Bruce Cardell, who was a thorn in the losers' side all night, dunked a hoop. as did Bob Halloran. and the Engineers were off to a lead which they never relinquishE'd. Mid- wav through the ont>nin~; hA.lf. the Cherrv and Wbite hPld a 21-12 lead. However, with Jim CarmiC'hael and Ray Pomeroy leading the dri\•e. the Garnet closed to within five points.

One of the most exdu:sive clul>s on the campus of Union College is an urgamzattun that has no rules ,no activities and no program. lt would appear tllat some uf the gentlemen concerned might not e\·en know that they are honored mem- bem of this society. We mean those little heard from and ewn less known men of empt~· glory, the class officers. ln the next few moments of shocked silence we \vould like to make a few suggestions before the lnicklmts lJegin to fly around our heads. There seem to be two altemative ways of resolving our problem. One would be to eliminate all class offices other than class president, who \\uuld still be a member of the student council and handy tu lw.\\e around when committee heads have to be chosl'll. The other altemative would be to set up requirements either in class constitutions or student council uy-ht\\::; \\ l,i\.:1! \\ uuld outline, not only the jobs and traditional projects uf class offtcer::> :such as the Junior Prom, but al:-o t'f't}Uii'P the officer::; to plan and present some form of activitv ('ach term. We dislike to go on record as favoring methods which force action but it seems that no other way would get life out of the prc:sent :;ystem if\\'(' w:mt to keep it. Some class officers of course do some work dur·ing parts of freshman and senior year~ along with sophomore discipline and the junior prom. Dut actions such as those of George Hendon '51 who has been conducting little gripe sessions like Solomon the \Vise to get voter opinion, are unfortunately few and far between. Perhaps real incentiw could Le gotten by greater class rivalry among- all four classes in such items as athletics, cam- pus chest drive::; and other projects. Pmties and money raising schemes would help to bring together liberal arts and technical students and add funds to treasuries that vvould not have to depend on cl;:tss taxes etc. Perhaps the spil\it of Eliphalet Nott would turn over in his grave were we to sug-g-est a refined form of the lottery- a raffle, as a money raiser. Internal Sabotage The Interfraternity Council appears to be in dire straits. It is indeed unwise as well as unfortunate that this model council, so much lauded and praised l>y outsiders, should be repudiated by its own membership. The member frater- nities have refused by a large vote to underwrite the council's financial condition now that it is in debt. \ Why is there not more concern? The group performs manJr good functions and when profits accrue from Gridiron Formals no lack of backing is in evidence. Perhaps the IFC should be composed only of fraternity presidents, who can better judge the value of the IFC to the College community. Guilty! No matter how manr men \vere responsible last week for withholding the records of the student council meeting from our reporter, we still feel it was wrong. If there is no policy on this matter it certainly is about time the council adopts one. PLACEMENT NEWS T\VO placement meetings have been scheduled for Monday evening, Ma1'ch 13.

Editor, Concordiensis Dear Sir: Those who have given their allegiance to this ideology will stop at no~hing in th..eir attempts to undermine our system. SAM NEWCOMEit I am writing this lettet· in an attempt to clear a situation for which I am being made responsible. I refer to your issue of March 3, 1950 which states that the results of a student council roll call vote were not publishE-d because Thomas Elliott felt that he 1 could not release the information without the permis:>ion .of each council member. I \\\ISH it to be understood that your reporter was told that since 0 there is no established policy of the student council ·on the matter, I could not release the information asked for. Concurring in this opinion were James Courter, chairman of the student council, and Wilford H. Ketz, advisor to the couneil. . I recall that not long ago the Concordiensis criticized both Mr. Courter and myself for attempting to establish policy for the council. Therefore, I resent the implication, in a supposedly straight uews story, that I should set' policy for the council. I trust that in the future the council may benefit by better and more accurate reporting. • Sincerely yours; THOMAS C. ELLIOTT, Secretary, Student Council EDITOR'S NOTE: My, my, it seems that there was more here than met the eye last week. Now there are three guilty parties. From here it looks like a plot by subversive elements to overthrow the free- dom of the press. But seriously, see our remarks in the editorial column.

Some modifications of the usual routine are to be recognized, such as the so-called \constructive\ pledge trip; but the typical pledge quest for such items as traffic signs and arti- cles of feminine apparel is still very much in style.

Inspection, Education Last l\1onday there was a little fire in f?eneca, one of the war-time dormitories, which brought to hght several v~ry interesting situations. We would like to c~ll yo.ur attention to several stories on this subject elsewher~ m th1~ paper and then we would like to point out several thmgs wh1ch are out- standingly deficient in the colleg·e fire prevention set:up. . First there appears to be quite a lack of educat1~n (m a college no less) on the pal't of the students not only m ~he proper methods of reporting a fire bu~ also as to. the locatwn of fire alarm boxes. Schenectady firemen arnved several minutes later than they should have because the phone call made from Seneca gave the impression that a grill across Nott Street from the Green Gate knew about or 'had the fire. A fire alarm box, which exists in the pastu1·e dorm area, would have pinpointed the fire much quicker. Secondly the warnng alarm system of the dorm had been for some reason tampered with and did not operate. General opinion seems to blame students for _this. The d~nger ~ere is 'obviou::;. Had there at a previous time been a misfunctwn- ing of the alarm system it should have been reported to the maintenance department not \adjusted\ ,by amateur elec- tricians. The third and perhaps the most impo1tant defect pointed up by the little blaze is the apparently complete lack of any sort of inspection by college authorities not only of the ~larm system but also of the condition of the fire hoses. Splitting hoses and nonfunctioning alarm systems are items that could have been prevented by rigorous inspection. The pasture dorms are slated to be razed in the near future but why not o.wait until they aJe empty. Fire safety inspection should be frequent and thorough for the entire campus, and the locatiorts of fire alarm boxes should be advertised. Planning Ahead Now is the time to start planning fol' the next college year. We say this not only with the student council and other tax supported student activities in mind but also with a consideration of the entire student body. It seems that Union will be entering an \austerity\ phase all of its own with the beginning of the next term in September. The situation that we are specifically pointing at is the drop in student enrollment next fall \Vhich will bring the total of undergraduates somewhere closer to the prewar level and the proposed top limit for the future size of the college. What does this mean? Simply this. There will be a sizable drop in the revenues that the student tax committee will be able to obtain and a resulting drop in its allotments to activities. The golden era is drawing to a close and most .of us who m·e faced with the annual task of budgeting will have to do a little real figuring. There are of course several possible solutions of which we would like to mention at least two. A rather obvious method would be to raise the present yearly tax of sixteen dollars. Another means to the same end would be to raise funds through other avenues. We favor the later method and would like to take this opportunity to tell the tax com- mittee, student council and the board of managers how we feel. The problem is how, and that is for all of us something to think about. ' Congratulations! The student council ought to be congratulated for a job well done in securing 10 points chapel credit for the last few. weeks of coal shortage and chapel suspension. It would ap- pear that the system is showing some signs of weakening. We predict further changes next September. By Hugh Montgomery The American political system, which it :must ·be .granted works quite well, is based upon two _virtually indistinguishable major parties and various minor parties. The system depends upon the latter never holding elective office; the reason why they are essential is that they hatch all the new ideas. Distasteful as it may be to the .idealist, this way of doing ,business probably- wH! stay with us for a. long time to come. Few of us really differ on principle; mostly we differ in the acuteness of our cultural lag. And so the process goes on, slowly to :be · sure, but apparently with sufficient inexorability. Many of us, ·by heredity or inclination, have certain political be- liefs. W'e contribute at one point ·Or another to the successful operation of the system. And as we do this we like to hawk our wares with great vehemence. Fine. But there is another range of political fact which must never be lost· sight ·of. By any of us. This consists >of the emer- . gence of situations in which the external environment does not permit the Internal operation of democracy. FIRST. there is war, An ultramodern sure~fire war fought on home soil would stop Tweedledee, Tweedledum and: all their little idea men dead in their t1•aclrs, indiscriminately. But there is another tnore subtle, • and thus more dangerous, monster preening itself far off across the ·landscape: the threat of war. . The thPeat is more insidious than the real thing. The political Tile ·~ Weekly system will seldom look up to notice the beast; the victim dies in the end with horroble certainty-not with a BANG but a whimper. The threat of t{')tal war will eat out the heart of democracy. All of the alterna;tive reactions-authoritarianism, weakness, bankruptcy, exploit- ation, secrecy, etc., ·etc.-stand in contradiction to the system. Perhaps this is not a crystal-clear danger, like a nuclear bomb, 'bu.t it cannot be overemphasized that it is a real and present danger. e THE TH:REAT' of war, then, must be removed. And all of us who hope to see GUr system of government continue must strive, determined- , Jy, to accomplish this. It is virtually a truism that only .effective, community suppor.ted. authority can successfully- stand in the way of the irresponsible use of force. Where this fi.Uthority is laclting, even though violence does ;not seem imminent, there is fear. Where t':le authority .exists, is supported by the community, and is able to apply sanctions, there is confidence, In the case of the world community this means a world-wide govern~ mel:lt to which has been delegated such authority and power as is neces- sary to malce war a thtng of fond memories.

SO THERE you have it. And you can't escape it. No matter what your political habits may be, you have got to help get the entire Ameri- can political system out from under the brooding shadow of fear. This is a primP.ry obligation. More simply, it comes first. It comes before co~fee and donuts, before hour exams, before dates, beer, 'football, spring ram, young love, and even before that greatest .of all questions-who gets to wear a high silk hat in Janua.ry 1953. It comes first because it is first; because our future indulgence in all those things depends upon our achievement of world community. This is so whether you per- sonalty like the idea or not. You simply cannot aifford either quibbling or apathy. World government is a subject closer to your own life than Chaucer or AC machinery or diplomas. And the sooner you realize this, and moneover do something about it, the better wo1ld this will be for all of us. IncllJding you.

Sanity Code Hits Grades For years, colleges, such as the University of Pittsburgh and more recently the University of Southern California have been talking about de-emphasis of athletics. With added pressure from the NCAA, the program has been given im- petus. But here's a new angle . DePauw University of Greencastle, Indiana, has initiated a policy of de-emphasizing grades! SEVERAL r e c o m m e n d ations have been made by the committee on educational policy to go into affect this year. For the first year, the word \grade\ will apply to that descriptive symbol which certifies completion of a course and which is submitted to the registrar at the end of a semester for entry on the permanent student records. Other estimates or scholastic standing will be called \progress reports,\ according to the announcement. Instead of six-week and twelve- week grades, single mid-semester report will be sibmitted to the dean of students, exception being made in individual cases of poor adjust- ment or; poor performance, especi- ally in the freshman year. The uni- versity will cease to calculate and publish grade averages and rela- tive standings. RECOGNITIONS, honors, and awards are to be postponed to the latest practicable date and in pub- lic mention of ·such awards, grades are not to be mentioned at all or as little as possible. • -The Union Lacrosse Team will .Tohn Berbert was named captain have two pre-season games April of the 1949-50 swi)ll.ming team, 4th and 5tl?' with Yale at hollle Wittner also announced. and Springfield away .• , SFEIDEL is a junior, 20 years old, ..and a native of Troy, N.

Whether he is so because of Ander- son's lines or because· of Mr. Don- ald Jones' direction I am not ready to say. I can say though that his performance, like Mr. Vinck's, Mr. Herrman's, and Mr. ~elmann's, to ON TUESDAY, Wittner received a letter from an undisclosed source, also applying for the Amherst job, asking of he could use Wittner as a reference. He also said in the letter he understood John Mc- Laughry was the leading candidate for the Amherst job. If McLaughry received the appointment, the let- ter writer asked to be N>nsidered an applicant for the Union job. Thus, before there was a vacancy there was an applicant. THE FOLLOWING day, Mc- Laughry went to Amherst where he made several demands. On Thursday, he received a call from Amherst asking him to come up Saturday, When he returned that afternoon, McLaughry revealed to President Carter Davidson and Wittner that he had accepted a \fine\ offer. His new salary is in excess of that received by any pro- fessor on the Union College faculty. The fact that .T·O>hn lived in the Mas!';achusetts town for four years when his father, DeOrman (Tuss) McLaughry, now at Partmouth, coached the Lord Jeffs, is also be- lieved to have influenced his de- cision. McLaughry compiled a superb three year record at Union with his football teams winning 17 games, losing 6 an dtring one. It Is inter- esting to note that his really great results were accomplished after he switched from the single wing to the wing-T formation in the middle of the 1947 campaign. This action was forced by the removal of stat• Harold Enstlce, injured in the RPI game that yea1~. Since the change in tactics were put into effect, the team's record is even more impres- sive than is the overall picture, with 16 wins, two loses and one tie, which was climaxed by the unde-- feated 1949 season. DOUBLING AS ski coach, he guided the skiers in the Senior IS-4 meet, only to have a series of bad breaks put Union in last place. Regarding a successor, Hammer- strom has been the name most prominently mentioned. He was a fullback on the undefeated 1989 team and was named to the little All-American backfield that year. Sam played in the 1940 \Herald- Tribune\ Fresh Air fund game, which the Collegians won, 16-7. Co- captain of that team was John McLaughry, and Tuss McLaughry was the coach. The only other time the Collegians won was last year's game, 28-13, when Kenneth Whalen, anc-ther Union great, played first-string defensive gua:rd. ---0·--- Architecture Exhibit tours· to local construction sites, Professor Vladimar Rojansky is from the alumni body were selected even if only re9ent1y, a classic, it presentation of papers by a student teaching Ronald Tt1cker the lnstri- to speak at the sessions.

It has proved worthwhile and en- lightening; and will also give me a needed credit at Union. -I FIND THE general student here much older than the average Union man. There is still a large percentage of \ex-set;vice'' students here; a'nd the prospect of many more in the future years makes the outlook of the public school or high school graduate very black. Science st1,1dents at·e exempt from national service before they get their de- grees, but then must do national service. The medical course is in two parts, the first three years are at St. Andr.ews, the last three in Dundee. The degree is one from St. Andrews University, Dundee Medical School being an integral part of the university. The medical course was extended to six yeaEs this year; previously it was five years. There is nothing here that corresponds to· our \pre-medical.\ . During their St. Andrews year-11 the students do a chemistry, physics, and zoology course outside of anat- omy and physiology - but do no arts courses in any form. In de- fense of this system, I will say that the average student here has >a longer high or prep school edu- cation, that seems to be equivalent to our first year of college. The reason for this longer and more extensive secondary school educa- tion is that a smaller percentage of graduates matriculate to college or university because of the shortage of places and facilities. ' I DO LIKE St. Andrews aca- demically, and find its drowsy, old- worldish atmosphere very con- ducive to good study. NO DOUBT the year here is very worth while, and I feel that I have already gained much from it. Yours truly ROBERT R.

Mon- day night's lecture was amusing, slightly instructive and highly in- dicative of the pc•et 's ability as a raconteur. Following an introduc- tion by Dr. Carter Davids.on, Mr. Auslander told of his first meeting with the renowned Amy Lowell at a meeting of the Harvard poetry society. As a result of her rather harsh and abrurJt critictsm, and his application of the same criti- cism to her, a friendship was begun which had great influence on his development as a p·c•et. received. He believcs that poets today have a moral obligation to move the whc>els within wheels. He dec!'ied the modern apotheosis of psychiatry even to T. S. Eliot's \Cocktail PaTty\ and stated that he had determined tL· write of the simple people who were happy al- though thL·y had never heat d of Freud. . Following the usual introductory remal'lts, Mrs. Auslander read some of her own poetry, including sonnets and the usual narrative poem._ IN -CONCLUSION, thP two lec- tures were entertaining but con- fusing to one with definitely limited experiences with such things. Both poets were cc•ntinu- al!y apologetic as if afraid of bor- ing what they might with reason have considered a captive provin- cial audience. But even if they thought that, their charm and art never faltered and perhaps we may be excused for trusting they too enj0yed their visit. ----o---- school, Middletown. N.
