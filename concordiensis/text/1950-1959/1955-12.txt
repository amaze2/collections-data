Hobert Wasserman, David Flnl<el, HolJ.,rt liort.lon. A Need for \Equilibrium\ This issue marks one year that we have held the editorial reins uf this newspaper. Last l\Iay, toward the close of the spring semester, we wrote a brief summary editorial that expressed in part our disillusionment with certain institution::; of Union, an attitude that yet Jingel's on. Change, however, in these env1rons, is not to be achieved by iconoclasm. lnstead, it must be the product of subtle sug- gestion intermingled with beyond the scene negotiation. lluw uftcn we have seen the bold editorial attacking an ol.Jviuus inj ustiee vr inaJeL[uacy, provoke even stronger re- sistance from the affected part1es. The spring of 1955 saw this previously expressed dis- illusionment directed toward the mstitution of the fratemity, particularly as it was related to the status of activities and edu~tion on the campus. Since that time, we have co1ne to view the shortcomings in our env1ronment as ~he product of forces far wider in scope than mere fraternahsm. We now believe that their causes do not stem simply from the effect of the fraternity on the •individual's thinking; rather they al'c an outgrowth of the peculiar nature of the g1·oup enrolle~ in om· College, and the reactwns of that grou.p to the m!l:m- fold phases of life at Union, both intellectually and soc1al. What, then, is the character of the Union student body, tho::;e :.lUO ur ::;o souls who enter our portals every year, and generally total up to around 1,0~0? We f!!USt first realize that we attend a College that 1s devoted m part to the practical sciences, particularly to engineering. l!nion is not a liberal arts sehoul in the sense that Hamilton, Williams or Amherst are considered such. A great part of our 1·eputation is based on our engineering and p~e­ medical cun·icula, and this is justly so. We are qu1te willing to accept the uft-repeated.conccption of \a balanced college,\ if and when a proper equilibrium is achieve<;l. . Contrary to words that others have expressed m thts column in years gone by, we do not take issue with the content or number of courses offered in Divisions I and II, and we feel that the question of the calibre of iHstructors is put·ely a matter of personal likes and dislikes. The man and his course are in the end, but a reflection of those who oecupy the classroom chairs. It is t~e student and his mutives that a.re the l\ey tu the educatwnal process. Thus our \equilib1·ium\ IJetween fields of stutly is ~o be achieved through individuals, a conscious effort to f11l our classes with tlwse who justly uelung th~re-those who see a pur- pose in being then:!: . . , , Of late, we have heard that there IS a hvel~' oJscusston in progress among certain parties in our AdminiRtration a.s to tlte 4ue::-.tivn vf geographical representation.

This latter view- point is une of the' liasic solutions attendant upon se~u:ing \equililJrium.\ Dra\\ing undergraduat.:s only from a hm1ted a.rea does not promote an interchange of ideas, nor does it bring the best available students to Schenectady. . Geo- graphical distrilJution is something that cannot ~)e rachcally changed owmight. hut it shoulfl be altet·ed if tTmon Reeks to be more than a local school. During· the course of the 19!1!1 spring semester we int1·oduced the idea that the College ought not even discuss increasing- the size of the gtudent body before it made cet·tain necessary improvements in facilities. We .:w?uld no\Y alter our the!'lis to thi!'l extent: that the AdmiSSions Office go so far as to reduce the size of the entering, class, for several years if need be, in an effort to seek ability rather than an approximate numerical total.

Be it better that you find praise for the \Administration\ of Union Col- lege rather than for the \Repub- li<:an Administration\ of the city of Schenectady. In closing, I'd like to comply Definite action was needed, and several steps have been taken which we hope will solve the prob- lem. In order to avoid any possi- ble misunderstanding, we wish to pass on our decisions to the stu- dent body. The main problem appears to arise from stags present during the late hours of parties. As a re suit, after a lengthy discussion at our last meeting, we passed the following rules: 1. ;No stags, other than fra- ternity and pledge brothers, will be allowed into the cnapter house during an open house paxty. 2. No beer will be served in the chapter house after 11.30 P.M. 3. The doors to the chapter house will be closed at midnight. We regret that such drastic ac- tion was necessary, but after the past prom weekend something de- finitely had to be done. We sincerely hope that you will help us in maintaining these rules, and that in the near future we may be able to relax the restric- tions, Delta Upsilon Fraternity. \Rock Hunter\ By Norton Reamer Staunchly fortified by two acts of crackling comedy and Jayne Mansfield's expansive ·bocsom, '\\'9 survived a third period letdown to leave New York's Belasco thea- ter pleased and still chuckling.

Miss Mansfield stunned us, Martin Gabel and Mr, Matthau sprayed the theater with humorous remarks, while Orson Bean de- flected in our direction any that might have gone astray, We were amused to the point of exhaus- tion.

Orson Bean and his now-re- nowned self-conscious patter must be ·accorded their share of praise.

Should a blue light be used more often than a red? What kind of e:ffect does a violet light have on merchandise? In recent years, color lighting has become so important in stores, restaurants, theaters, and displays that General Electric developed a line of ~ew easy-to-use color-reflector lamps for this market. · The man responsihleJor deciding which colors are mosl effective for users of these lamps is 29-year-old Charles N. Clark, Ap- .plication Engineering Color Specialist for General Electric's large lamp department. Clark's Work Is Interesting. Important In a recent series of tests, Clark made a critical appraisal of literally hundreds of color-filter materials to find the ones that produced maximum results but were still suitable to high-production techniques, prac- tical stocking and simplified selling. This· experimental work also had to- take into account all the information on human per· ception of color. 25,000 College Graduates at General Electric When Clark came to General Electric in 1949, he already knew the work he wanted to do. Like each of the 25,000 college-grad- uate employees, he was given his chance to grow and realize his full potential. For Gen- eral Electric has long believed this: When fresh, young minds are given freedom to make progress, everybody hene1its-th~ irt- dividual, the company, and the country.

Allen, a senior, played the season at right tackle, and, along Vlith McMahon at left tackle, was one of the major factors in the ex- cellent showing of the forV>ard wall on both offense and defense. A four year man in football, Mc- Mahon also is a key member of the lacrosse squad. Several times during the season he made im- portant tackles to break the back of opponents' scoring threats. The soccer team elected junior Stephen Gluck captain of the 1956 team at a 1r1eeting held Thursday, November 17~ ·A halfback on this year's squad, he distinguished hirr self both on offense and de- fense. Michael Pincus, also a junior, was selected -cheerleading captain, succeeding Richard Preziosi. There will be a meeting of the Ooncordiensis business staff Monday evening, December 5, at 9 P.M. in the Publications Office. M erm;en Will Open Season At Lancaster A swimming team that coach Ray Mull'ane terms the \best bal- anced\ in his ten years at Union will open its 1955\56 campaign Sat- urday, December 10 against Frank- lin and Marshall at Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Mullane feels that ~he addition of sophomores, Paul Belus and Ed Mishkin, will more than compen- sate for the 'loss of John Sherwood the only mem bcr of last season's squad to depart. Sherwood holds ·the Union record· for the dive with 73.7 points. Jay O'Neil; Norm Bartner, George Trask and Steve Sheppard will handle the sprints for thhe Garnet with Belus, Bill Havard and Marty Cohen swirr.ming the distance e- vents. Diving May be lVeak Spot Breaststroke and individual med- ley chores will be in the hands of Bob Kim and Rupe Ruse. Back- strokers are Mishkin, Mark Hof· fer and Bernie Berkowitz, with Mishkin also swimming the indi- vidual medley. Diving, perhaps the weakest spot on the team, wiil be done by Chuck Roberts and Gary Gilmore. Before their first taste of sche- duled competition this season, the mermen will participate in a prac- tice meet against either the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania. or ,Villan- ova, December 9. · Included on the schedule for the first time in a number of years, both Franklin and Marshall and Trinity show overall edges in, competition with Union. In pre- vious meetings, Franklin and Mar- shall has taken both meets while Trinity has won ten out of 11 en- counters. The schedule: Franklin and Marshall .. December 10 Williams ................

Brubeck's popularity has .beerL growing uuring the past few year-;; and he has hau many fine· recelJ- tions at colleges f.rom coast too coast. Not confining himself to- barnstorm.in~ the educational in'- stitutions of the country, he hal!' appeared at Zardi's in Los An- geles, at Basin Street in New York and numerous other clubs. LasL year, he gave a concert at Car- negie Hall. Records for Columbia The quartet, for many years, re- corded for Fantasy r•ecords, a com- pany which Brubeck E'Stablished and operated. In June, 19M, he cut his first platter, called Jazz U()e~ to College, for Columbia. It .outsold similar single albums for several months. In the November 8, 1954 issue or Time rnag<j.zine, Brubeck appea:l'ed! on the cover. An extensive article dealing with his style, musical in- terpretations, and general ba<:k- g!'ound was included in the s11-me issue. Tributes to h1s musical ability- and talent have also come frollll the world of jazz itself. He wollL Down Beat's popularity and critie poll and Metronome's all-star poll'! ind-icating that his appeaf is Vlide- spread and not restricted to iso- lated groups of jazz fans. The style which Brubeck em- ploys is completely individualized . It is a modern form of jazz whicb has departed, to a great extent: from the older and outdated \bop.' · This latest development in the growth and increased accepta;nce of jazz is greatly dependent on im- provisation. The music is thus ·a continual test of the musicians.' eapabilities. Dave Brubeck meets this challenge easily and witb grace. Concert Represents Innovathm Aiding and complementing hl::s wanderings in melody and rhythn:n are three fine musicians in t.hei.T own right. The other component.s of the quartet are: Paul Desmoncl at thP alto sax, Joe Dodge on the drums, and Bob Bates at the bass. This concert, sponsored br the Class of '58, is the first of its kin-<! ever to be arranged. The re'pre- senfatives of the sophomore class responsible for this prl)sentatio n are: Richard Argyle, Joel Bm;t- baum, Gerald DePass, John Glass, Frederick Hall, Ron a l d Jecke-1,.

From the Editor's Notebook The Life You Save .•• A word of thanks to the Faculty Council for its gener- osity in giving the New Year's party-goer an extra chance to survive his trip back. Traveling on \the day after the night before\ is mm·e than just annoying for those who go by car. The dangers of fatigue added to the usual seasonal hazards made classes on the second a necessarily risky proposition. Now that the Administration has done its part, we should like to urge students who dl'ive to do the same. Driving is at best gomewhat 2erilous. Errors of judgme?t, mistakes of others, and natilral dangers are always With us. Even without a serious ureech of regulations, we still face possible injury. Any speeding, careles~ess or in- attention at the whE-el greatly increases the likelihood of an accident. This is the toughest time of year on the roads. Tough on everyone. but particularly tough on college students. Vacati()ns mean borrowing the family car for a date, to spend an evening with old S<:hool chums, or just to cruise around the neighborhood. A desire to operate the family car is understandable-reckless driving isn't! A Bouquet for the Extra Day The suspension of classes on January 2 gives us another cause for glee. The guccess of the Student Council's petition l'epresents perhnps thP mo,.;t notnhle achieYement in its recent histor\'. Often C'hidcrl fo1· it-; ineffectiveness, the Council has l·mely been able to demonstrate its worth so concretely. Ce1·tainl~· rntitlerl to a few petals from thig bouquet is Senior Class PrE'sident .-\lhert Ba1·samian. Barsamian remained unconvin('ed wh('n Council President Stephen Hoi~ brook wrote off attempts at having classes suspended as a \real flop.\ His Jesolution, pas,;ed at the November 29 meeting, can he largely credited for bringing about the suspension with little help f1·om othc1· pressures. It may ue usdess for us tu urge \mm·p of the same\ from the CounciL Important issues are brought before it only in isolated instances and they tend to arrive in toned- down form '\.Yhich ealls more for speeches than action. But we will ask the memhe1·s for a more diligent application to getting things done, !'ather Uwn to getting themselves heard. It's Bailey Cup Time \The hanrl that gives can also take away\ and we should like to point out that it is now Bailey Cup time here at lJ nion. Yes we kn0\'11 that Prize Day rolls around in 1\Iay and not Decembe1·, but now is the time for all potential winners, and even mme unlikely candidates, to take action. January and the succeeding- months should see a resurgence of political activit,\' in various campus organizations which tend to lie flotmant from September till Christmas vacation. 'l'here will surely h.> charg.es leveled against opponent and innocent bystande1· alil\e and .perhaps even a crusade or two. The C'onco1·diensis; which prides itself on its restraint in matte1·s concerning- campu.R politics (as divorced from )()cal politics) and hasn't had a Bailey Cupper in years, will just sit bark and enjo,v the goings-on. However, although taking· no active pmi in the rivalry, we shall reserve th.e right to poke pins in any hot air balloons which float by. Last year's strong finish filled us wi.th mirth, but we were still raw am! inexperienced then. This Spring, with one campaign under ou1· belts, we will be keeping eyes peeled. But \ve would prefer not to be referred to as the Discor- diensis: why we may even advocate the awarding of several Bailey Cups. Unfortunate!,\', straw polls such as the one on page four are impossible in the months preceding Prize Day. But careful attention to our news pages may provide valuable information for any wishing to follow the race.

Leonard Walter Jerome of the Class of 1839 appears to be the same Leonard Jerome, sans the middle name, whose daughter, Lady Randolph Churchill, became the mother of Sir Winston.

At the pres- . er1t til;ne, largely because of the · contributions of the oil companies to the Venezuela government, that nation has no debts of any type, domestic or foreign. Being a good citizen, accorqing to the principles followed by Cre- ole, involves one major point; keep- ing out of aU internal politics. Cre- ole is trying to aid in the coun- . try's ·development by giving tech- , nical aid and assistance, scholar- ships, and other help to the govern- ment and people of Venezuela. The job of the \head man in Caracas\ is mainly con(,lerned, therefore,. with maintainir\g good publie and gov- ernmental relations. The education~i~;l system in that country until CJ_uite .reeently w<a:s completely undeveloped, However, in the :past few years it has been prqgressing rather well. On~ .of Creele's polici'es is :to encourage the development of schools, to pro- vide educatio:n :for the worltets to increase their working- proficiency. Creole employs a:bout 15,000 peo- ple, over SO percent 10f whom are Venezuelans. All' North American employees must learn Spanish as so.on as they are hired, and. they are given annual tests to dete1:1mine their rates of prqgress. The ·second facet of Creole's own \good neighbor\ policy is that of being a go 0 d employer. The em- ployee problems constitute a full- time job for the personnel men. \Everything that happens to the ol;>rero is due either to· s\Dmething the company did or did ,not do,\ said O'Rourke. Mo§t of the .oi). is .found in un- .nhabited r,egions. When the com- . .pauy goes into these areas, it builds roads, houses, utilities and recreational facilities for its em- ployees. This ends up, as a cost to the company of 300 pevcent of the base wage of each wo.rker.
