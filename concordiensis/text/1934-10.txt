Combining. • • offtackle plays with end runs and forwa1·d passes, the Cardinal eleven succeeded in reaching their oppo- nent's thirty-five yard line before· having the ball taken away from them on downs. Union then pro- ceeded to take the ball to deep into Wesleyan territory to make what' looked like a scoring bid. The Cardinal line held for downs, how- ever, and the Dutchmen were forced to make another a:ttempt. Garnet Scox,es After Wesleyan had punted to their own thirty-five yard line to start the fourth quarter, Brown, Liffiton, and Semerad ran the ball close to the Wesleyan scoring stripe only to have the pigskin ex- change hands. Again Wesleyan punted out of seeming danger, only to have Dain and Semerad spoil the day for the visitors with their scoring stunt. It was Sem- erad himself who kicked the point after touchdown to give the Garnet their seventh and last point of the· day. After this, Milano again kick- · ed off for Union and, with six min- utes of play remaining, the Garnet successfully defended theil· margin and turned in their first victory of the 1934 season. . . ... It was a different looking team which Coach G. Elliott Hatfield and his two new line coaches, Can- · trill and Lawrence, put on the grid- iron. The blocking was the best that it has been for many years. Captain Dain, Semerad, Liffiton, Brown, Milano and Charlie Krull were especially effective in this de- partment. A big imprQvement was also noted in the way the team was tackling. The line was practically impregnable as is shown by the lit- tle :Yardage that Wesleyan could gain from rushing the ball. ... * * President Fox, usually adverse to watching athletic contests, spent the afternoon in the Union stands_.

One group believes in retaining su·ict denominational lines because they are \right\; another group believes in dividing the Christian churc?es into fundamentalist and modermst; while a third believes in th insti- tutional point of view. Dr. Fox believed that the new mechanical devices for transporting people quickly to great distan~e;; further Intensifies the need for m- tegrating the churches in order that they many maintain them- selves. The need for fewer, though perhaps larger, churches grows as the people find It easier to travel long distances. \Certainly Protestantism was los- ing its beginning in America,\ con- tmued Dr. Fox., \as Roman Cath- olic immigrants crowded our ports. The theological seminaries began to teach sociology and the cult of so- cial service began to rise as a new and dominant force among Pro- testant Christians. Then in the nineties came the institutional churches, like St. George's in New York and Russel Carwell's Baptist Temple in Philadelphia. Christian leaders came to take an interest, not only sympathetic. but intelli- 1 gent and informed. in the problems of our new industrial organizations, particularly the problems of labor: on Februat y 2f>, 1795. \The old b1ick. acadclllr 1esounded with the tidings or succe~$,'' said Jos~ph Sweetman, a member of the first graduating class in a speech de- livered at the seml-centenaial, \and the night following the wind<>ws were well-studded with candles, and at a concet·ted signal all in- stantly in a blaze, the little bell on the top of the hou~e jingling most menily, the interior filled with happy boys and the streets crowd~ ed with sympathizing spectators.' Old records in the exhibit show that when Union opened its doors 139 years ago, its property con- sisted of one building, $16,5{)0 in cash or go-od securiti~. and sub- scriptions from citizens to the amount to about three thousand dollars. Onl:r- nineteen students presented themselves for admis- sion and for them there was but one' instructor. The instructor's salary was fixed at $635, and the sum of $325 1vas named as the sal- ary of a junior tutor to be ap- pointed later. -----o - . I New College Magazine to I Embody Special Features!

A typical student's ·room of one hundred years ago is one of the most interesting features of the historic exhibition which will open today in the Old Gym Dorm and South College. Nothing is lacking to carry the observer into the past, for the owner of the room, himself, is to be found there, ::tbout to take his departure. A table of white pine contains a dish of biscuits, one of apples, an old iron clock, candle, a two burner sperm whale oil lamp, and an open book, as well a a liquor jug. On the wa;lls are several paintings, in- cluding \Much Ado About Noth- ing,\ \Merchant of Venice,\ one of boats on The Mohawk River in 1825, and one of Meeting of Union College Graduates. The lighting of the time is por- trayed by a candle on a ladder rung, arranged so that it shines over the left shoulder of a person sea:ted in the reading chair. Other articles included in the make-up are a flintlock gun with powder horn and a clothes press. It is before this clothes press that the \student\ is to be found, dress- ed in blue \claw-hammer\ coat of broadcloth, with brass buttons, a figured, brocaded vest, white linen shirt with fluted ruffles, a fine figured muslin stock, pinned with blue jeweled stock pin, a:nd wearing white linen trousers strapped under shoes. He carries a tall, tan um- brlla, and a carpet bag is at his feet. Ml'S. Fox ProcW'ed Articles Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox, afte1· a search covering much of the Ca:p- ital District, procured most of the articles included in the room, and presented them to the college for the exhibition.

Local Paper Comments on Inaugu1·ation Conference Editor-ial comment on the forth- coming inauguration of Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox: as president has already begun to flow. In an editorial in Tuesday's edition of the Schenec- tady Union-Star, the college man in politics is discussed with empha- sis on the conference between Dr. Earl Cummins, Governor Wilbur Cross and Comptroller Joseph Mc- Goldrick, which will open the two day ceremonies. \ ... If politics is to be raised out of its low estate and is to be ma:de a serious occupation for trained minds, it will have to be as the result of placing responsibility upon men of integrity, character and ability. There is no insuperable obstacle to making men of this type pra>Ctical politicians. The same opportunity is open to them that is open to less conscientious and less well-trained persons. Too many content themselves with being the- orists; and, if they enter politics at all, seek to enter at the top, in- stead of learning the elementals. Great revivals of interest in public a,ffairs grow out of times in which young college men enter politics.\ Larrabee to Speak At Melville Dinner Will Tell Conference in Pitts- field About Eal'ly Life of Auth()r of 'Moby Dick' Dr. Harold A.

German Organist Begins With Bach's 1'oecata and Fugue In D Minor; Well Received By TONY SHARPE Last night, we had the rare priv- ilege of hearing Gunther Ramin, ?ne of Europe's foremost organ- Ists and holder of the most histor- ical position on the continent. The experience is ne we can never for- get and judging from the response of the audience, one which left a lasting impression on them as well. The program began with Bach's well known 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' and Mr. Ramin did full justice to it. He showed by his interpretation that he keenly felt every note that he played. The rythym ot his body, the tossing of his head, his vigorous touch and peda:lling seemed as much a .part of the music as the notes themselves. We never can forget the DJagnifi- cent Toccata and the climax o.t the I<'ugue. 'l'he high spot of the evening to us, however, was the 'Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor'. Of course the work itself is a masterpiece of counterpoint and architectural skill. The theme, announced in the first eight measures by the pedals is re- peated more than twenty times, now in the Swell, now in t.he Ped- als, now in the Great. The intricate wea-ving of the tl:ieme back and forth rather reminded us of kittens at play. There is a tremendous cli- max to the Passacaglia making the whole thing stand as a monument to the great genius of Sebastia:n Bach. But even outstanding from the composition itself was Ramin's interpretation. His registration was unbelievably delicate when the oc- casion demanded, yet equally as forceful a:nd triumphant when big crescendos were in order. 'l'he dif- ficult pedal passages were done flawlessly yet witl:i much feeling and vigor. We thought the Bach Chorales were things of sheer beauty and sensitivity and more than deserved their place on the program, The melody in 'My Heart Lies Heavy Within Me' wa:s taken by a. clarinet stop accompanied by soft strings, making it a sad, wistful, will· o' the wisp affair. 'In Dulci Jubilo' was brighter and more moving having been written by Bach for the Christmas season. But for Bohm's Partita on the Chorale 'Ah How Fleeting', we could see very little excuse. We were rather surprised that .Herr Ramin should include anything so trivial. Neither did we care particularly fo· Buxtehude's 'Prelude ancl Fu- gu, in F Major'. It was very- bril- liant with its soft flutes answering soft stx-ings and Its ;remax-kable petial passages but somehow, if Buxtehude had any effect on E~teh, we much prefer Bach . Ramin's improvisation on 'Home Sweet Home', the theme which was submitted, was nothing short of amazing. It was a mixture of Bach mannerisms, Reger's 'Fantasy on B-A-C-H' plus the most modern chords a:nd tonal changes that one could imagine. A. great deal of it was simple marmon!zation, but just when we would imagine that the German maestro was stuck he would slip out with a series of in- tricate major and mln<Jr key changes. It was very well received and deservedly so. Philomathean Society Existed Two Years Before College Was Founded The Philornathean Society, still flourishing in Union today, has a history which is of peculiar interest, in that the society existed in Its original form for two years before the college was actually endowed In 1795. Unde1· the name of the Cal- !opean Society, students in the Sche11ectady- Academy carried on a literary prQgram which was unal- tered when it became connected with the college and changed its name to that which was to become famous in .the college history. The objects of the organization were the acquirement of literary knowledge, the promotion of virtue and the cultivation of social har- mony and friendship.\ This was to be accomplished through the or- di!lary business of the society ''De- clamation, Composition and E:xtem- poraneous Debate.\ Meetings were held secretly and there were very high standards of decorum. A fra- ternal spirit pervaded the organiza- tion and the early literary- societies are often looked upon as the direct forbears of the modern Greek let- ter fraternities. One of the most impQrtant acts of the society was its collection of books to form a club library-. Ac- tive members, as well as alumni, donated many volumes and the .funds of the club were used t<> sup- plement the books collected In this manner. By 1848 nearly three thous- and books belonged to the society and in 1886 the complete libraries of the Phllomaihean and Adelphic organizations were turned over to the college.

Hobart has a tac-1\le named John- son who weighs a r:nere 290 pounds. Those who saw the Hobart ,;arne here two years ago probably re- member him. His mountainous bulk could not very well be missed from any angle of the field. He is far too stout, however, to be well proportioned and our opinion is that he will never ma:ke a formid- able football player. We hope that the game takes such a favora:ble Three turn Saturday that Mr. Hatfield can put Union's own little counterpart of Johnson, Gene Hull, into the game. Hull tips the scales at a- round 250, himself. 'l'o see the two pitted against each other would be worth the prtce of admission to anyone. If the two went down in a .pile together, just about the whole field would be blocked. Red Burt0n would have to get out his vaulting pole then, if the Garnet team needed a score.

Whitney and King will be the ends. Whitney is a sea- soned veteran, while King is a: new man, but they both have what it takes and should prove bothersome to the Garnet. Coach Wilson bas two fine tackles this year in John- son, 290 pounder and Harter. They are husky lads a:nd will battle the Union team to the last ditch. Two other newcomers to the Orange and Purple squad, Kenly and Stein, are in the guard positions and strength- en the Deacon's defensive power considerably. The center post is in the hands of Captain Turturro, a veteran of two other seasons on the Hobart squad. Have Two Backfields Although having a comparatively new line, Hobart will present a ver- itable wealth of bacltfteld material. Coach Wilson has two complete backfields which he can use at will. No. 1 back is Rich, a veteran, whom the Union fans should re- member from last season. No. 2 backfield position is Curtin, a ball .carrier of no little ability. No. 3 man is Nichols, another veteran and the No. 4 post ls Cullen, a soph- omore a:nd a steady ground gainer. The second backfield array presents itself in the personnages of Ferris, Harvey, Cross, and Balter, another veteran. The Garnet squad has been strengthened greatly by the return of two vetera:ns from past seasons, Little and Bill Waldron. Phil bas given the \trick\ knee of his the big go-by and has donned his uni- form. He pra.bably will not malte his initial 1934 appearance Satur- day, but should see action at .Am- herst, when the Dutchmen tackle the Lord Jeffs. Bill Waldron, with the aid of a specially constructed mask which protects his face, will undoubtedly see action Saturday. Jiggs Rotunda has been seen in the ba-ckfield frequently this past week, and may be used in that de- partment against the Orange and Purple.

Below us, in shallow river water, stood numerous thatched huts built on high stilts to which more native dugouts were tied. Along the street stalked tall ne- groes and muscled negresses who I puffed continually on fat cigars. Naked children scampered about in the sun or wallowed in mud to their waists.

In elt- change we took on bananas, coffee, and ivory nuts. When at last the steam wmches were quiet and the ship had left the docks, night had fallen.

The motion, made by Ralph Cohen, '37, was greeted by a burst of applause from the unusually crowded assembly. It read at first that \In accordance with the cus- tom of past years, the student body go on record in favor of not hav- ing the Sophomore Soiree, and of having the extra. days of Thanks- giving recess,\ This was revised, at the request of Ralph Semerad, '35, chairman of the meeting. The chair called for discussion, and George Haske!, '37, asked if the sophomore class does not have the power to make the final decision whether or not it is in accordance with the de- cision of the student bod)•. Semerad replied that the final decision does rest with the sopho- mores. George Strobel, '35, x·ose to ask just how many extra days of vacation the abolition would mean. After a short discus- sion it was decided that two extra days would be granted. Semerad then called for the vote, a very small minority voting in favor of holding the dance this year. This is the fourth continuous year that the student body has chosen thi,;; alternative. Chatle:o !Jain, '3a, captain of foot- ball, also announced the defeat of th~ team by Hobart Satut·day.

Since this was the first meeting, no practice debate was cGnducted. Mr. Wyatt, '32, the new director of debating, discussed the organiza- tion of debating at Union, urging those who were present to work diligently. He al:oo expres::;ed the hope that the coming- season will bE: a succe::Jsful one and urged more students to come out for debating. Mr. Ro.bert Smith, '34, the new coach of debating, explained the method of choosing the personnel of the teams for intercollegiate competition. \Debating he said, qffers no rewards, except the exper- ience itself and the opportunity to learn to express oneself clearly.\ The tentative debate schedule was read by John Argersinger, '35, manager of debating. As outlined, the schedule includes six home de- bates which will be broadcast over station WGY and six debates away. A10 ::loon ru; alfangements are com- pleted, a definite schedule will be announced. The first practice debate of the season will .be held Monday at 7:30. The subject will be \Resolved that the ptivatc manufactuze of arms and munitions should be forbidden by international agreement,'' with Joseph Woolman, '35, and Preston r:.cet:., '38, upholding the affirmative a~,;ainst a negative team consisting of Charles C. Thomas, '35, and Richard Snyder, '37. This debate will be in preparation for the first varsity radio con test on November 12 when the Garnet team will meet Hamilton. Seymour Horwitz, '35, president of the society, proposed that the meetings be conducted according to parliamentary ,procedure if the members desired to do so. A defin- ite decision on the question will be made next week. About a thousand guests includ- ing presidents of colleges and uni- versities, leaders of industry, jour- nalists, representatives of learned societies, distinguished citizens, alumni, and government officials will witness the inauguration of Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox as the twelfth president of Union College, on Thursday and Friday, according to the program announced Saturday. The program opened with an historical exhibition yesterday at which the history of Union during the 140 years of its existence i.s be- ing uniurled through its documents, photographs, books, instruments, and other memorabilia. On Thursday night, the inaugura- tion program proper will begin with a conference on \College Training for Government.\ Induction on Friday The induction ceremonies will take place on Friday morning, <.Columbus Day). Dr. Nicholas Mur- ray Butler, president of Columbia University, will make the principal address, in addition to the inaug- ural address by Dr. Fox:. An inaugural luncheon will fol- low at which the representatives of the colleges, the press, industry, the faculty, the alumni, and others will speak. The formai opening of the histor- ical exhibition will then take place and one of the chief exhibits will be a student's room of 100 years ago faithfully duplicated and under exactly the same conditions and in the same building in which it was housed. The conference on \College Train- ing for Government\ on Thursday night will serve as a spring-boru-d for the increasing emphasis Dr. Fox's administration will make on emphasizing the part Union College will henceforth take in preparing students to take an increasingly active part in the government. McGoldrick to Speak The chief speakers at the confer ence will be Dr . .Joseph D.

GILBERT The Schenectady Police were to Union boys nothing but \obese mobst('rs\ who spoiled Town and Gown fights, in the days of prexy Potter. On one notable occasion the po- lice were the butt of much local criticism. The Concordy claimed that the local arms-of-the-law were pos- sessed of considerable brute force, but utterly devoid of t·eason. What Is more these \carrot-headed wretches\ waddled about the str.eets jumping at every opportun· ity that presented itself for inter· fering with college street-sings, mid-night parades and innocent carousals. The town news saw no reason for criticism. The illiterate mus- cle-bound nincompoops were men of high esteem In the eyes of the good and lawful citizenry. Why sho\lld the undergraduates be of- fended? After all, the force was endeavoring to do its duty. The college boys, nevertheless, drove the much-despised wretches off the ca:mpus whenever possible. In an early issue of \The Garnet\ <1880), Dr. Charles M. Culver '78, aptly portrayed in a cartoon the chasing of a helmeted cop by a llvely student armed with sticks taken by the fleeing officer a:ppears to be away from the campus.

The fraterni- ties, however, with the exception of a fe\\ which have eliminated the old ideas of se- crecy and sectarianism, have remaiHPd ;;tatic. Moreover, it is the function of the college to deal with men and not with groups. Men come to college today for culture, training and maturing, and in orde1· that the instiu- tion accomplish this, it must have unham- pered room for experimentation. The fra- tetrnity can either aid or hinder this basic function. To aid it meuns drastic changes which the fraternities themselves must make; to hinder it means inevitable dissolu- tion. The choice still lies with the fraternity but it will not remain with it for long. Here at Union it is a tragic fact that there are too many fraternities. A college of 800 students, with a great many local men, and many more who can barely '\York their way through colleg·e, cannot possibly support 22 active and healthy fraternities. Yale seems to have hit on the remedy- college dormitories for the entire student body. Union can find the happy medium, first by a deferred and controlled rushing system, and second, by the establishment of freshman dormitories. It may be objected that this will result in financial difficulties fur all fratemities. and extinction for some. But survival of the fittest is a primary la\\' of nature, and onlj· the fraternities that can weather a tempor- ary flurry of adversity are the ones worth keeping at Union. If the senior class can trust its nominations to a round dozen men, why not have a fair caucus, at which every fratemity as well as the neutrals v. ill ue represented, to act as a nominating committee. One man from each of the twenty-two fraternities, one from North College, one from South College and one from the Neu- trals at large would be a more just nominat- ing committee than onlJ-· the represeulc.tti ves of seven fraternities. If we are to have class offices at Union College, why not elevate them to a position whereby the.r would mean something to be elected to, rather than a mere process of being nominated by a frater- nity brother and then, if fortunate, being elected by the class as a whole? With such a caucus, it would lJc neces- sary to have a majority of the caucus to agree upon each man to be nominated, and the number of nonunees could be fixed by that body. Nominations for Student Coun- cil are made in a similar manner and have worked successfully in the past. There was no evidence of a deal for last year's class elections nor is there any evi- tlcnce of such this year. There have bee1i deals in the past, however, and there may he more deals in the future. Thus, it would be wise to have nominations by caucus, and to hm·e the nominations kept secret until the time of election, in the same manner as the Student Council elections are held. * * • This is Milk Month.

FERGUSON The greatest upset and general calamity that could possibly have befallen the Union varsity football team has come to pass. The eleven travelled to Geneva on Saturday and sustainea a 19 to 6 defeat at the hands of little Hobart, a col- lege who has always had the repu- tation of having poor football teams and who was the underdog in Saturday's set-to. Few, if any, believed that the Deacons were powerful enough to hand the Gar- net team any kind of a defeat, let alone the beating they passed out on Saturday. Hobart Scores Early After Union had kicked off to Hobart, Rich, scintillating left half- back of the Hobart team, pulled a beautiful quick kick that spiraJed far over Semerad's head, catching the Garnet safety man off guard and it was downed on the Union ten yard line. Semerad, who at- tempted to punt out of danger, failed to get off a good kick and the Dutchmen found themselves facing a hard-fighting, charging, clawing, ldclting aggregation called Hobart on Union's 30-yard stripe. Rich then passed to King for the first Hobart score and the Garnet found themselves on the short end of a 7 to 0 score at the end of the first period. The second quarter was much of a see-saw up and down the field, with Union holding the edge over the Deacons in yard- age gained. The half ended with the ball in Union's possessiOn on the Hobart five yard line. Two more Purple scores =me in the third period. Rich intercepted a Garnet lateral pass that landed ught m hL::l hands, and 1 acPd fo1 the Union goal line, 75 yards away, for a touchdown. The la~t Hoba1l ~core came in the same penod when Rich again passed to King for the touchdown.

Carole, Jung and Fa:rr are candi- dates for the other two positions. Canole has never played football before, but Nitchman says he is showing up better than any other man on the squad at the p1esent time. He is a: fast, shLfty runner and opposing teams will have to look out for him. Farr has sus- tained a slight injury and may not get mto the fracas. Th1s would leave Jung in the fullback position.

Joseph McGoldrick, Comptroller of New York City; Dr. Earl E. Cummins, professor of economics; and Governor Wilbur L. Cross, of Connecticut; were the speakers. Dr. Frank P. Graves, State Commissioner of Education presided. Comptroller Joseph D. McGold- rick of New York City, speaking on the relation of college to govern· ment, emphasized the need for more college-trained leaders in this democratic world. From his prac- tical experience in politics he stated that college courses in the past have been too theoretical and that the teaching of political science has left much to .be desired. Comptrol· ler McGoldrick lamented that there are not greater opportunities for careers in public service. He di- vided public service into two branches; that of the political var- iety, where a party machine rules, and the classified service, which still favors the popular candidate rathex- than. the better-trained one.

They were Laurens P. Hickok, Elipbalet Nott Potter, Har- rison Edward Webster and Andrew V. V. Raymond. The first president was the Rev. John Blair Smith, who served as the executive head of the college for its first four years of existence, from 1795 to 1799. .At the time of founding the college Rev. Smith was Pastor of the Third, or Pine Street, Presbyterian Church, of Phi- ladelphia. Twenty years prior to his election as px-esident ot Union, Rev. Smith's brother the Rev. Sam- uel Stanhope Smith, was chosen as the first president of the Hampden- Sidney College of Virginia. Butler Gives Challenge rro ·Education in His Address Hiram L.

He called attention to the long period when our national gov- ernment failed to attract men of high intellectual attainments, and when the political slogan was \to the victor belong the spoils\. He pointed to the growing interest in government in colleges and univet·- sities; and he emphasized the need for practical apprenticeship in pol- itics to temper theoretical knowl- edge.

Students, members of the faculty, alumni, friends of the college and the com- munity may well take pride in having so dis- tinguished a person associated with them.

Dr. Fox has in his personal library a tremendous collection of books on his spe- cialty, history. l\lan:y of the fraternities have house libl·a- ries. l\lost of them are, however, quite small and seem to consist in the main of standard encyclopediae with a varying number of novels and textbool\s. Some of these libraries were built up in a few weeks as part of a mm·ement toward house libraries made last year. Could they not be greatly enlarged by followiug a plan among the alumni of the individual fraternities similar to the one suggested by D1·. Fox to enlarge the college library '! :\Iany of the alumni would be only too glnd to contribute to such a project v:hich, if carefully planned and diligently carried out, could become an asset to the different houses.

The liberal policy which he has been pursuing regarding student activities enhances the opportunities which these activ- ities have to offer to the student body, per- mitting them to be student activities in fact as well as in name. The Concordiensis pal·- ticularly can appreciate the liberal attitude of Dr. Fox and it is grateful for the cooper- ation which this policy represents. Such an attitude is fostering understanding and co- operation between students and the adminis- tration while his policies in general are pro- moting hai'mony between all branches of the izaiion and of their greatest glory. \' * • Weeks Nastiest Remark Depart- college. The Concordiensis extends its best wishes to Dr. Fox in its own name and in behalf of the students of Union College. We cannot but feel that, under the direction of a man who combines the qualities that Dr. Fox does, Union is bound to continue on its path of progress to greater achievement and greater service. With the influx of alumni and visitors to ~~~.t: \I met her at an Elks pic- the campus to witness the ceremonies this morning, the exhibit has become a center of attraction. However, these will not be all who might derive pleasure in such an exhibit. To- morrow and Sunday will bring to the cam- pus many alumni who because of business considerations cannot be here today, but who nevertheless are vitally interested in Union and in its past. The Goncordiensis suggests that the ex- hibit be held open all day tomorrow and Sun- day, when it will be possible for the num- erous persons interested to see the exhibit at their leisure. Union owes this amount of consideration to those men who are con- cerned enough with her welfare to give up their time to visit her campus on such an impo1tant occasion. . .. ..

A l!bentl education is not only one whicn is based upon a true con- cept and understandmg of freedom but it is one which prepares for freedom- freedom from narrow and self-seeking seltishness, free- dom from meanness and hypocrisy, f~eedom from malice and antago- msm whether personal, group or national, freedom .from willing- ness to exploit or impose upon one's fellow men. The man who is truly free w1ll see the world as It is. He will be a stern realist and for that very reason a sincere idealist, since it is ideals, whether true or false, which rule the world. If any part 'of the once civilized world has been wholly free from all this dtsun·ion and disaster, that fact escapes the attention of even the most patient observer.

This union of men involves h 1 Y years ago was a congeries of The American college was in some degree unfortunate in that it began its career as a school whose ideals and methods were, in large part at least, those of vocational preparation. Those who brought the college into existence on this continent had in mind, first and chiefly, the preparation of men for the ministry of the Christian Church. It was some little time before those conditions were changed and the college entered upon its long and useful career as a school for the general and liberal education of American youth, no matter what his future calling was to be. As the college multiplted in numbers, its task was steadily in- creased in difficulty by the progress of knowledge throughout the world. New regions were discovered and new peoples made known. Nature was attacked on every side by ob- servatiOn and experiment and rapidly yielded her secrets with the lessons and consequences that are eveii now only partially under- stood. Literature and the tine arts, always untrammeled by either race or language or natlonal boundary, steadily conquered the intelligence and the emotional life of increas- ing millions of men. Despite these enriching and unifying influences, economic conditions· increasingly tended to become such as to lead to the demand that the school and the college offer that instruction which would point the way to earn- ing a livelihood in some specific calling. This is well enough in its way, indeed essential, but it is something which is quite fatal if mistaken for education or allowed to displace it. So in time it came to pass that economic forces which w ich is our hearts' desire, is our sch 1 h f and depends upon a common foun- oo s w ere, so ar as entrance confident expectation and our most stand d dation for intellectual and moral earnest wish. ar s were concerned, a young insight and understanding.

This insight and understand- ing will be found, as they have always been found, in the interpre- tation of human insight and human experience. Those master- pieces of the mind which serve as milestones in the history of litera- ture and the arts and those master- ful accomplishments in the field of human organization and public service which are the outstanding landmarks of humanity's history, are the material of which this faun· dation is to be built. The immor- tality of human effort and human accomplishment surrounds us on every side and If we would under- stand life and its sternly practical problems, we must grasp the sig· nificance of this immortality at any cost. Happy indeed is the American youth who is led up to the high places from which he can see and appreciate those permanent intel- lectual, moral and spiritual forces whose working gives to civilization both its meaning and its ideais. What this signifies is that after · the technique of apprehension has been gained through a knowledge of arithmetic, algebra and geom- etry, of grammar and rhetoric, of the elements of scientific method and of at least one other language than that which is native to the student, he shall be offered guid- ance toward comprehension of fundamental scientific principles, toward appreciation of excellence us.

Captam Chip Dain, who has been on the starting end of both of Union's scores this sea- son, will be at left halfback, and Don Liffiton, who has played ex- ceptionally well as a blocking back, will be at right half. With the ad- dition of Rotunda at fullbaclt, the backfield will be complete.

Cohen was seeded second in the tournament, but owing to a ruptured stomach muscle his doc- tot· has compelled him to relinguish all forms of athletic endeavor un- til next spring. Cohen was slated to meet Salad in the third round, and, if victor- ious, would enter the quarter final matches which will be played this afternoon. Moffett t~ 1\leet Fox George Stroebel, seeded number one and captain elect of the net squad, defeated Hym Enzer on Wednesday to earn his place in the quarter-final bracket. The scores of the match were 6-1, 6-3. Jack Mof- fett, seasoned veteran of the Gar- net tennis team, seeded fourth, earned his right to meet Austy Fox, another third round winner, in the quarter finals by defeating Van Nordstrand in a hard fought match that went the limit, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. The Nitchmanmen have had stiff drills throughout the week with the intention of being in good shape for their first encounter. They have learned but six plays to date, but teams coached by Nelson Nitchrnan .have gone undefeated on six plays before. As was the case with the varsity in the Wesleyan game,. it is rathe1 too bad that the yearlings have to open their season with a game that is going to be as tough as this Gloversville set-to purports to be. The freshman have met only the varsity and C. B. A. in scrimmage and the lack of suitable opening op- ponent is clearly seen. finals. Orton defeated Ed Carpen- ter, '38, Rankine Hinman, '35 and Hallebeck to fight his way to the round of eight. \Doc' will meet Fritz Hawley, '3S, seeded third, in the third quarter final match this afternoon. There seems to be little hope for Orton to reach the semi- finals, for Hawley has been the sen- sation of the courts this fall, sweep- ing aside all the competition which the student body could offer, with the exception of Stroebel, who has been able to give the newcomet· u stiff battle whenever they have met. Stroebel and Hawley Final? The default of Cohen seems to in· dicate that Hawley and Stroebel will meet in the finals, providlng- Stroebel can get through his next two matches, which seem to be a lot tougher than the next two on Hawley's schedule. Salad will meet Thorne this aft- ernoon for the right to enter the semi-final round. Semi final match- es will be played on Monday, with the finals scheduled for Tuesday, weather permitting.

Captain Jack Kehoe, the Amherst powerhouse, will un- doubtedly stc'l.rt at his post in the backfield. The fullback on the Jeff- men's eleven will be Al Snowball, whom many will remember as be- ing a big factor in the Amherst victory last year. Others in the bacltfield will be Eddie Brehm, Leo Pagnotta, Browning, and Patten- gill. Who will be the starting ones is unknown at the time of this write-up but any Union fan will re- member that the Amherst backfield is a strong one, one that ran rough- shod, over, around, and through the Garnet line last year. In the same season, the Union eleven managed to eke out a 96 to 0 slaughter over its traditional rival, Hamilton. In the report on that game the Concordiensis states, \The only reason that they tUnionJ did not make 150 points instead oi only 96 was the fact that the last half of the game was only 15 min- utes long and the making of teuch- downs and the !ticking ox goals had grown monotonous.\ Fox won his place in the quarter final round by defeating B. Stew- art and will meet Moffett this aft- ernoon in what promises to be the best of the four matches which are to be played on the courts today. Both Fox and Moffett are veterans and will meet in the only all-varsity match of the quarter-finals. The schedule of this afternoon's · HELEN OSBORNE'S The most formidable line-up for the forward wall presents Bob Moses and Ken DeBevoise at the flanks for the third straight year, Art English and Parke Burrows at tackle, and Bud Trembicki at guard. Both \Toots\ Colucci and Sumner Lawrence are ready to al- ternate at tbe other guard posi- tion. The pivot man will be either Dick Forman or Tom Kennedy. This is practically the same line that started the Sabrina's victory last year and it is not easy to forget the strength of this forward wall. Union Presents Sa,me Attack The Union eleven is going to use the same system of running, buck- ing, and passing that it has used in the first two games. Several weak points that were prevalent in the Hobart encounter have been ironed out and Coach Hatfild is confident that Union is at least not going to suffer the slaughter they received a -year ago. The Garnet mentor is not as con- fident of scoring a win over the Lord Jeffs, but . • . it is going to be a tough battle. -----0----- Wainger Advances to Thh·d Round in Faculty Toumament • • It further states that it was the third straight year that the Garnet had won the New York State Cham- pionship in a row.

Six Text of Dr. Fox's Speech (Continued ft·om Page 3) of all. The library of one university today, with its mi·llions of weH- Helected volumes·, contains a great- er number of scholarly boolu<, by tar, than were to be found in a'll America when Mark HopllinB tool' up his presidency nearly a hun- dred years ago. lt is obviou~ that the small, independent college can- not compete in these facilitieB with the undergraduate department of any one of our major universities. Moreover, it is argued that the student in the isolated college laclts the stimulus of the scholarly hu- man contacts of the university. The higher learning, it is said, Js too expensive to be strewn over the countryside in little centers; in the competition for funds the great universities, with their vast pres- tige, must always win. Our student's plight is worse, runs this analysis, because of the teacher's plight, and it is manifest that this stri!tes at the heat t of the matter. A uni\'Ptsiy prof<'\\'n recently published a paper on the independent colleges in which, half humorously, he doubted them \in- tellectual graveyards.\ In it he al- leged that the best opportunities for vital thought and the best com- pensation, and, therefore, the best brains, were to be found in uni- versities, where the college teacher had more time, stimulus and facili- ties for schola1·ship, and where some part of the week he met the keen excitement of able graduate student minds. To :sum it all, this writer declares in substance that no young man of parts and power would take appointment to an in- dependent college if he had the slightest chance for a place in a university college. Such an ap- pointment is the mark of tempo- rary failure, though final discour- agement comes only when all at- tempts to escape have failed. Then personality rots and withers, and the intellectual graveyard claims un'Other co!pse. Many di::>tinguished presidents before me, then, will discover them::;el ves as sextons. Alwnni of Small Colleges Rauk This challenge cannot be smiled away. It is seriously made and must be seriously answered. Though we live in a swiftly chang- ing world, it might seem that we must, like Patrick Henry, judge the future by the past; and we must judge the past of an institutoon by its product. When the biogt·a- phies of Who's Who are explored, the witness of the past is strongly reassuring to the smaller colleges. Judged in proportion to their total number of graduates, the indepen- dent colleges show a high rating of distinction, at least as it is recog- nized in that familiar work. In the first fifteen, out of seventy consireded, are Amherst, Wesleyan, Trinity, Hobart, Williams, Haver- ford, Hamilton, Bowdoin and Un- ion-and Lafayette, Dartmouth, Rutgers and Colgate are not far behind. These figures may be crude, but gloss them as you will the small college, so far, has no cause for shame in the assay of American alumni. The 1rraduates of the good small college have for generations sent their sons back to its care, knowing its value in their own lives. After all, the primary purpose of a college is to produce not learned books but able men. New Problems But complacency might well pre- sage degenet·ation. Pet haps we can- not judge the future by the past. It is readily granted that the uni- versity as a whole is far less like the small independent college than it was in our fathers' day, and per- haps this makes past comparisons uninstructive. If the university col- lege is now a .place or larger and higher life for the undergraduate, the best young men will pass the ::;mall college by, for they no long\t· have the strong appeal of neigh- borhood convenience. They were scattered tl!rough the country just fot that. An Oxford or Cambrid~e family of colleges, serving a nation, would have been impossible in t.arly America, when difficult dt;;- tances had to be encountered and sectionalism flourished. \It is one of the glories of American colleges,\ said Theron Baldwin in 1854, \that they are not concentrated in one vast university, but are scattered far and wide among the people, each one filling its sphere, avail- ing itself of local associations and local sympathies. . _ . \ No one can overestimate what the geo- graphical availability of higher learning has meant to Americans of times past. But now that miles are merely minutes everywhere, geographical availability appeals only to those who must lodge at home. No sma11· college can exist on that alone, or chiefly. The stu- dent with a reasonably free choice goes now where he wills, and if the university college is bettet• on all counts it will get him. The future of the small college depends very largely on how it meets the prophecy of an en- feebled teaching faculty, No dis- couraged man can communicate courage. No man can teach youth to love learning who does not him- self continually love learning-not love his own knowledge met·ely-, but the exciting joy of learning. graveyards of the intellect. These THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1934 The college which load::; a teaching scholar with sixteen or eighteen hours of classroom work soon has nothing but a tired driHmaster. The professot· in a smaJ.l college need:; as much so-called leisure for learning as the undergraduate teacher in a univelsity, and a small college which cannot Hi ford to ~ive him time for spiritual refreshment will find that young Amel'ica can- not afford to come to him. There is no body of knowledge which, once accumulated in early life, is complete and can be displayed and redisvlayed under the name of teaching. As um evised textbook,; are soon obsolete and eliminated .from the market, so too, unrevised men become obsolete and ought to be eliminated as humanely as is possible.

The teacher two at intervals. wh~ a:Dter sixteen weeks 1eturns Able men feel the creative im- pluse; for the college teacher this is gratified, but only partly grati- fied, in the classroom. He knows that he cannot, genE>rally speaking, meet the judgment of his peers without publication. Though his class\!s rna~/ be more cun1petently critical than he realizes, he is right in doubting the sufficiency of their approval as a test of his new ideas and interpretations. He desires to meet, and should desire to meet, a higher test before the world of scholarship that reads the printed page. Moreover, he desires, and should desire, to contribute to con- structive judgment by his own re- views of books from other men in the general field in which he wot·ks. He desires, and should de- sire, to foregather with other schol- ars in that field at the annual meetings of his learned society and talte part in them, at .the very least in private discussion of the schol- arly papers read. The Teaching Scholar \Vacations\ for Study We may admit again that thE' facilities of library and laboratory are net as fortunate in country col- leges as in university college,; d ur- ing the so-called academic year. But may I be permitted to suggest from twenty-five years of rather close observation tha-t the data fot· scholarly writing are n0t cl1iefly harvested by college teachers d ur- ing the \academic year.\ It is no wonder that the toiling business man is ·apt to feel that the c<Jllege teacher's life is soft and easy, when he enjoys nearly a third of the calendar year in what is apparently one long vacation,. He does not !mow that college teachers func- tioning at par use most of thotie sixteen weeks in increasing their lmow·Jedge and preparing for con- tribution. Commencement past, the teacher is the whole scholar once again, justifying the academic hood that he has lately worn. He is to be .traced in well-planned travel, en- riching his observation of the world he is expected to interpr-et, or, more generally, he rnay be found among the collections of a notable museum, or ranging with his delicate apprehension the mines of some great library where he sus- pects the materials of his personal truth may be discovered-truth which he will fit togethet· and de- fine, his contribution to the wis- dom of the ages.

There was very little literary ingenuity displayed there, at any rate. The Music notes remind one of the best the Encyclopaedia Britannica has to offer. In a recent issue, the report of the Ramin Concert brought back memories of the morning after Prom. There was such a mix:ture of verbose inanity and faulty dic- tion therein that the article ap- peared stupi.d. The reader quite probably cared very little forlthelre- r~nter's opinion of Bach or Bohm, and wondered sorrowfully where was Rankine Hinman.

COlt, STATE AND BROADWAY Y -Cabinet Plans Forum Meetings fol' Coming Year A series of forum discussions on various phases of religion in mod- ern society will be held by the Un- ion College Christian Association during the winter months, it was decided at a meeting of the cabi- net Tuesday afternoon. A committee is now working on a tentative list of topics and lead- ers which will be mimeographed and distributed to the student body in assembly nex:t Tuesday morning. Each student will have the oppor- tunity to checlt the subjects in which he is most interested. Of the ten or eleven suggested topics, the fl.ve most popular will be chosen for discussion. In this way the Y Cabinet hopes to fit its program to the needs of the students. The meetings will be similar to those held so successfully last year. Prominent members of the faculty will lead the discussions. In addi- tion, the cabinet is considering se- curing ·one or two speakers from outside the coHege who are partic- ularly qualified, to lead this type of meeting, and who are well in- formed in their fields of endeavor. Professor Ernest H. Ligon, as- sembly speaker for Tuesday, will devote his talk to explaining the suggested topic~ and outlining the work of the Y Cabinet for the com- ing year.

Eight Text of Dr. Fox's Speech t Continued from Page 6) pears in many a great man's memoirs. But even this generous ministry must be supported by en-; dowments. The college whose neces- sal'ily mean stipend confines its teaching scholar to a bare and shabby home, can scarcely hope that his student guest will be subtly reassured with the prospect of a scholarly life. No one pleads that learning should be associated in a student's mind with luxury, but neither can it well be associated With distress. Large-hearted men and wolllen de:;iring the dignity and charm of learning in th.js country may well bear in mind that the small C(}l!ege is carrying on its en- terprise of education in the homes of its staff as well as elsewhere, and that a modicum of apparatus is as essential there as in the college labol'a.tory. When recently the president of one of our largest uni- versities remarked that his univer- sity college assumed no interest in the life of its students outside their academic exercises, President Com- fort, ·e>f Haverford, welcoming a dis- tinction here implied, toolt occasion to reply that the small college con- tinued to stand in loco parentis. That it does, not in an inquisitorial interference in the sphere of pri· vate liberty, not in the imposition · of arbitrary rules, but in a humane concern for the growth of fine and rounded personality in every mem- ber of its family. Smll.ll Colleges in Universities There could be no more impres- sive recognition of, and no more sincere compliment to, the power of beneficent personal contacts, which has long distinguished the small college, than the recent un- dertaking of certain large univer- sity colleges, with fortune at their beck, arbitrarily to disintegrate themselves, each into a family of small colleges. But it is not unna- tural for the historic small college to believe and, perhaps, not inde- corous for it to express its belief, that it will not be imitated out of existence. The high objective of the inde- pendent college is liberal education, primarily of its students; but as a means to that end it desires, too, the continuing liberal development of its teaching faculty. The physicist and the classicist, the philosopher and the historian, the economist and the mathematician, are not only in the same institu- tion but 'in daily neighborly contact and companionship, and constantly aware of the interrelations of the arts and sciences, constantly aware of the oneness of knowledge. It is this which maltes for the breadth of college teaching and the rich- ness of the college experience.

Perhaps the greatest contribution made by Union has been in the .sphere of education. Sixty of her graduates have distinguished them- selves as presidents and founders of colleges and schools which today look back upon their administra- -tions with respect and admiration. Francis Wayland Leading among these educators is Francis Wayland, 1813,. Brown Uni- versity's greatest president.

The announcement came from Dean Charles F. F. GariB and was read by Pre:>id.ent Ralph Semerad, president of the student ·body. The announcement was greeted with cheers, for it was only last week that the student body had voted to abolish the sophomore soiree for the current year The meeting was opened with the singing of the \Terrace Song,\ led by Thornton W. Whipple, who was recently appointed college song leader. Several freshmen were named to report to the sophomore ·discipline committee because of in- fractions of several of the rules governing the actions of the mem- bers of that class.

For several years the Publications Board has donated an equal sum for the purpose of buying books for the library. This announcement comes im- mediately after Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox's appeal to the alumni to give books to the library. The titles of th<9 books which will be purchased with this money will be announced late d. Upon receiving official announce- ment of the $200 appropriation from Button Delack, 'll6, secretary of the Tax Committee, Dr. Fox wrote him expressing the college's apprecia- tion .for the move. Dr. Fox's letter follows: \On receiving your letter of to- day's date I must write you im- mediately to express the warm t!Manks of the college for .the gener- ous gift of $200 by the Publication Board toward the increase and en- richment of the library. It is quite superfluous for me to commend this loyal s·pirit signified in this gift, but I cannot for.bear comme11t on the wise discrimination you have shown in making the Library your beneficiary.

Your gift is, if I may say so, evidence quite as much of your sound re- flective ~judgment as of your fine the faculty opened the luncheon by saying grace. The first toast was delivered to Dr. Fox by Dr. Living- ston Farrand, president of Cornell University, who spoke for the col- leges. Dr. Farrand said, \I bring the very hearty and warm congrat- ulations of the colleges and univer- sities to you, Dr. Fox,\ Cornell's president continued by saying that Union stands as the gateway to the colleges of the Mohawk valley, Un- ion being the oldest institutiOn of higher education in this section of the state. \In spite of the many curriculum changes, we are all en- gaged in that tremendously respon- sible task of training youth,\ Dr. Farrand concluded. Dr. Finley Dr. John H. Finley, an editor of the New York Times, spoke for the press. He defined a newspaper as an instrument essential to the high- est element of democracy and the definition he gave of journalism was that it is the continuous story of the every day events of life. President-emeritus Charles Alex- ander Richmond addressed his toast to Dr. Fox for the retired fac- ulty. Dr. Richmond had just arrived from Scotland on Thursday after a seven months' tour of Europe. He •·aid that the two things that im- pressed him most while in Europe were the menace of war and the at- tack on personal liberty. In an in- terview with Chancellor Adolph Hitler of Germany, Dr. Richmond learned that the Teuton chief would not hesitate to enter another war if he felt strong enough to do so. Hubert C.

We have it on good advice that the Student Council is generally in favor of such an organization, but, as yet, there have been no definite steps taken in that direction. At Amhe1·st the interfraternitr council virtually governs all the activities of the fra- ternities, with special emphasis on rushing-. For several years rushing has been well organized on the Amherst campus, only be- cause of the interfraternity council which is bestowed with considerable power. Union is somewhat in the same position as Amherst in regard to fraternal life. The ma- jority of the student body in both institu- tions belong to fratemities, although the number of Greek letter societies is smaller at the Massachusetts institution. A deferred rushing- system would be ulti- mately desiral.Jle here; but, it goes without saying that for the present that is impossible for the welfare of every fraternity. l!t is not impossible, however, to defer rushing until the opening of the school year, thus enabling every fraterruty to start at an even pace and preventing some poor sub-freshman from be- ing kidnaped into accepting a pledge before he has had an opportunity to see more than one house. Under the cutthroat system now in force the fraternities are compelled to use extreme measures in securing respectable delegations. Sometimes this works out well for both the individual and the fraternity- in a majority of the cases it does not. Other powers that an interfraternity coun- cil could assume would be the handling of in- tramural athletic tournaments-thus reliev- ing an overworked athletic department; a 0 give 1emse ves a ue er c 1ance to pass Mae West was with us again sev- your mamma teach you to be po- ium of radio the examinations that m·e to come at the end era! days ago.

The students of Union are altogether for- tunate in that they have access to every book in the library, instead of being- restrict- ed to the classified index and call system- which is in use in most of the colleges in this country. Take care that the college is not forced to threaten you with such a system- and all the disadvantages it entails. AFTERMATH The tumult and the shouting dies; The scholars· in their robes depart; The Union student yawns and sighs As once again his cla.sses start. Union has inaugurated her twelfth presi- dent with plenty of pomp and ceremony. The distinguished guests have come and gone. We settle back to the normal routine, the bread- and-butter diet of life. The Concordiensis re- sumes headlines of a more modest size. Most of us are a little tired of hearing speeches. We are glad the tension of feeling our college on display has relaxed. We begin to wonder what it is all about. Why make all this fuss about inaugurating a man whom we know akeady? It is a reasonable question and deserves a reasonable answer. First, the inauguration ceremonies give the alumni and friends of the college the opportunity to meet and hear the new president. Second, the occasion gives the college excellent publicity. And last and most important, the inauguration dramatizes a cdtical moment in the history of Union College. It is a time for reviewing the past and previewing the future, for taking inven- tory and making plans, To pause for a mo- DRAMA AND THE THEATER By FRANCIS E.

On that day all of the hidden foibles of Schenectady re- veal themselves, and pour in drovPs into the big city. Especially interesting are the 1 family groups of thirteen or four- teen children, all below the age of five, • who squirm and screech tire- lessly the whole 165 miles of the trip. These groups usually carry with them boxes and bags laden with foodstuffs, clothes, babies, and bottles, and spend most of their time exploring the contents and steadily, stolidly, munching their way to the bottom, Yet, like the magic pitcher of Philemon and Baucis, the boxes are brought back to the train for the return trip, just as full, and its owners munch on, just as steadily and ceaselessly. Then there was another group on the return trip, an Arab, two Hebrews, and a Chinaman. Amid hiccoug:hs, and with great gusto and technical detail, they were dis- cussing the forthcoming marriage of the Arab to a Polish blonde. All of which tickled the not-too-fin- icky taste of the generality. Mr. Webster would have found admirable material, too, for his Mr. Milquetoast cartoon. An old gentleman, with a small mou.s- tache, puny physique and large ears, sat hunched in a corner, starting to read the New York Times. He was just through the news section when the brakeman, a huge sanguine creature, replete with bovine neck and voice and hands about as large as a signal lantern entered, and sat down on the plush seat. His blue serge trou- sers were new, and he feared that they might become shiny. There- fore he picked himself up, walked over to the little old gentleman, and silently but threateningly toolc the paper which he had just put down. Bearing it arrogantly to his seat, he remarked, \Watch the old bugger squall for his paper.\ He was surprised, a moment later, to fi,nd t~e little .fellow standing over h1m w1th a gnm expression on his face.

At Amherst the interfratemity council virtually govems all the activities of the fra- ternities, with special emphasis on rushing. For several years rushing has been well organized on the Amherst campus, only be- cause of the interfraternity council which is bestowed with considerable power. Union is somewhat in the same position as Amherst in regard to fraternal life. The ma- jority of the student body in both institu- tions belong to fraternities, although the number of Greek letter societies is smaller at the Massachusetts institution. i'or a few months.\ would be cause for alarm. \The ma- q1:med t.o speak to t~e fres~men edly be a permanent feature.

I crossed by Snowball, rangy full- back who kept tearing holes in the Union line all the afternoon. Another blocked kick by English in the second period led to the second tally of the day. A bad pass from Union's center resulted in a fumble and Amherst recovered on Union's 15-yard line. Four line bucks put the ball across the last ' · line for the second goal. The try for point was converted and Am- herst led 13-0 at the half. The absolute inability of the Union line to hold the Lord Jeff men was noticeable throughout the game. Shields and Fleming, playing on the right side of the line opened holes in the Union line big enough to send the entire back- field through. On every running play the Jordanmen had half the team running interference while the rest were easily taking care of the rather half-hearted efforts of the Union men to break through. During the second part of the con- test, Coach Hatfield's charges , played an entirely different brand I . of football. The chan.ge was partly due to their attempts to stop the Amherst line in their tracks in- stead of attempting to break through the line on every play. Many of the fancy plays of the home team were piled up at the line of scrimmage after this style of play had been adopted. Milano's Run The Garnet defense, although still ragged, was much more effec- tive in the second half and the ball was constantly in enemy terri- tory. After exchanging several punts at the opening of the third period Amherst started what seem- ed to be another march to a touch- down. Joe Milano, who was taken out of the game shortly after due to a painful injury to his ankle, spoiled the offensive tactics of the Amherst gridmen by intercepting a pass, and, with practically an un- guarded field before him, running forty-three yards to the Sa.brinas' thirty-yard marker before being downed by the safety man, Brehm. This play seemed to take the heart out of the Amherst defense and the Garnetmen continued to threaten their goal for the remain- der of the game. A twenty~one­ yard pass to Burton on the eigh- teen-yard line ended the game. The best playing on the line was done by three men, Jack Finch, Joe Milano, and Bob Barton. Finch and Milano were in the thick of the scrap from the opening whistle and broke up many of the smooth- working reverses of the Jordan- men. Barton played one of the finest games any sophomore has played in recent years for Union. His ability to detect the fakes and reverses were a huge factor in holding the Amherst team to thir- · teen points. The backfield was hot particularly outstanding Saturday. This was due, however, more to the sieve-like line than to the individ- ual backs. It is a remarkable tri- bute to Semerad that despite four blocked kicks he was the outstand- ing kicker of the game. All of his kicks were hurried and yet he re- peatedly kicked his teammates out CHARLES' Formerly ED'S The Official Union College Barber ror the past 24 years.

It is said that the forming of Delta Phi was first discussed at the Scotia Bridge, a picture of which is the frontis- piece of the centennial catalogue, on display. Other interesting items in the Delta Phi exhibit are the Delta Phi autograph book, the original cata- lugue, dated 1845, and a number of clippings from the press about Union College and Delta Phi.

The Psi Upsilon Catalogue belonging to Arthur with his signa- ture is on display. The original badge of Samuel Goodale, one of the founders of the fraternity is on cii:;play. It is much larger than the present badge of the fratemity. The badge of Lawrence J. Goodale, brother of the founder, and his Phi Beta Kappa key are also in- cluded in the exhibit. Among the publications in the Psi Upsilon case are the Psi Upsi- lon songbook, \The Story of Psi Upsilon,\ the Psi Upsilon Epitome and several catalogues.

Chi Psi, founded in 1841, one of the two fraternities founded here which has as yet to celebrate its centennial, shows pictures of five of its founders, James C. Duane, Patrick U.

A copy of the charges and speci- fications of the charges preferred against Alexander Slidell MacKen- zie, commander in the Ulllted States Navy, by the Secretary of the Navy are included in the Chi Psi exhibit.

All the grading of the rink itself Is being done by student labor as a FERA project, and the workers are total- ling three hundred hours per week .. When completed, there will be a skating surface two hundred feet 'long by one hundred feet wide. Lighting facilities for night playing and practice are being considered, although it is doubtful it there will :oe time even to complete the rink before the cold weather prevents further work. In the gully in back of the Delta Phi house, a dam Is under con- struction which will store water in the college creek to flood the rink. A gravity conduit will lead from the dam to the rink so that no pumps will be needed. In order to peMnit the concrete mixers to approach the damsite, the Delta Phi gate had to be taken down. A small trench running along the creek was the object of much curiosity. History has it that this trench was designed to carry soil by means of water to fill in depres- sions in the lower campus. Dr. Fox Is Honored At C~ of C. Banquet President Tells Local Chamber Of Commerce Advantages Of City-College Cooperation Initiation Friday Dr. William A.

Waldron Explains Student Tax Plan Committee Chairman Tells How Blanket Tax Evolved, Also Method of Solicitations W1lliam A. Waldron, '35, speak- ing in assembly on Wednesday, re- viewed at length the evolution of blanltet tax for student activities at Cnion and explained the p1·esent systm1 of tax assignments by the Tax Committee and their admin- istz at ion by the Co-ordinator's office. The idea of an annual tax odg- inai.ed from the athletic depart- ment in lieu of the old custom of \passing- the hat.\ Its successful application ~oon led other activities to a~k to be included in the tax. The fault of the plan lay in the fact that appropriations ran from year to year with no correction for changes in the scope of activities or in thf'il' value to the college. ThP credit for the initial impetus of thP movement to adopt the pres- Pat anangement should go to Dr. Et>nn..tt, said Waldron, The idea f'anH· tu HPnry Gulnac of the class of '31, when this professor suggPst- t>d illustrating- some principle$ of Public: Finance by having various lPadt•! s in campus activitiPs justify tltP appropriation::; which th!'y l'C- erivrd from the student tax. At the suboequent Student Council meet- !ng-, a eommittee was appointed to investigate, and the result was a rrport 1 ecommending several fun- damental changes. The report was adopted by the student body last Janua1y and i:; now in the fir·st stages of trial. Waldron went on to explain the function of the Co-ordinator's office and the method of application for appropriations. He emphasized the fact that the anangements are tentative as yet, fm· the coming year may bling to light advisable alte1ations. Day as a result l> f u. ntotiou passed A.

Dal'tmouth, 32-0 and to little Ith- aca Cellege, by the score o:f 7-0. Lineup Changed Coach G. Elliott Hatfield, of the Garnet eleven, has juggled his line- up to quite some extent and even new it is rather uncertain what his. star:ting team will 1ook like, During the past week Hatfield has been using all the material at hand in .an effort to stem the tide of defeat and to put the best winning com- bination on the field that he can find from the candidates at ·hand. It appears that the ends will be Van Waldron at left end and Jack Sloatman on the right side of the line. In the tackle positions will be Lambeth and Krull, and the guards, Finch and Potts. The center will probably be Leon Nagusewski, who recently reported for practice. In the backfield will .be seen Ralph Semered, who will call the signals from the left halfback po- sition. Captain Chip Dain has been moved over to right halfback, and will do his stuff from that posi- tion. .Toe Milano, former right wingman, has been moved into the backfield and will be used as a blocker from the quarterback post. The fullback will be Jiggs Rotunda who has played well at this post during the year. Vermont Offense The Vermont team is going to present a strong running attack if nothing else. Their backfield drive is built around Andy Werner and Rollie Delfausse. Werner is the fullback and is a veteran of last year's team. He is a driving line plunger and will be hard to stop. Delfausse is the right halfback and a newcomer to the squad who has shown more than a little promise. Eddie Funk, the quarterback, is ex- ceptionally good at running back punts and also makes a good field general, handling the team with great zip and pep. The fourth mem~ 'ber of the backfield is Enos Ra- mon, the left halfback, who plays a steady smashing game for U. V.M. The Green and Gold line is also going to be strong, having held a bigger, heavier, greater Dartmouth team to 32 points. The ends will probably be Negus and Giardi. Ne- gus is a veteran of last year and knows plenty about playing left end, while Giardi is a newcomer who has shown up well in previous contests. The guards will be Ross and Captain \Red\ Cook. Ross is a newcomer, but Cook is a seasoned veteran whose specialty is punting and place-kicking, and he seems to have an uncanniness about putting the ball exactly where he wants it to go. In the R. P. I. contest es- pecially he put the ball out of bounds innumerable times close to the Engineer's goal line. This is an invaluable asset to any football team. Holley and Saxton seem to be slated for the gua1 d position,; with Paul at center. ThPse three hoy,; can mull· than hold thcu· own again.<! toue:h oppo~ition. Be,;Jdes this regular stl ing of ;;tarting players, Coach Subo has a wealth of material from which .to draw as he sees fit. Among them are Lawton, Geo1·ge, Leekoff, Rome, Trudeau and Kenworthy.

One of the biggest football games of the year is scheduled for Saturday; unfortunate- ly it is to be played away from home. :\Iany students do not own automobiles and must go to Troy by bus. For the convenience of those \Vho must go by bus, it would help tremend- ously to charter a bus fo1· that purpose, and would save a number of students the trouble of having to \valk any distance to reach the bus, or the campus in Troy. Perhaps if the freshemen would 1·ealize that certain rules which they are asked to observe are for their own benefit, they would not have to be reminded of theh existence of the rules. We have repeatedly pointed out in these columns that the absence of a dormi- tory to house the entire freshman class and the cutthroat method of mshing which pl'e- vails on the campus make it especially diffi- cult for freshmen to become acquainted with many of their classmates and hinder the de- velopment of class spirit. Perhaps the only counteracting influences aTe two freshmen rules. The wearing of caps aids freshmen in recognizing those classmates with whom they never come in contact and the obligation to greet other undergraduates fosters a friendly spirit between them and. the other classes. Men who acquiie as freshmen the habit of greeting fellow students carry the habit th1·uugh the remainder of their college years and the result is that a more friendly spirit p1·evails on the campus than would otherwise he possible. It is for this reason that we remind the ft·eshmen once again to obey the rules. penny for him who does. * $ * 'f The Sigs are back at their tube tricks again.

CLASS FIGHTS The lack of enthusiasm which was accord- ed to Mr. Fox's suggestion in student body rr..eeting yesterday regarding a freshman- sophomore football game indicates one of two things: viz., either there has been a mistaken impression prevailing over the Student Coun- cil and the editorial board of this newspaper that some sort of antagonism between the two lower classes would be desirable; or, the suggestion, as originally made in the editorial columns of The Concordiensis was not fully understood. We meant to point out that such a contest would be far more human than the ancient paint fight and salt and tomato fight; we meant also to point out that a football game of that sort would not be impossible to stage for both the varsity coach and the freshman coach have signifield their willingness to support a contest between the pick of the two lower classes.

The previ- ous record was 18 minutes 3.2 sec- onds made by Ed Bastedo, against Colgate two years ag0. Waters flashed around the three-mile course in !5 minutes 59 seconds, three seconds behind Eddy of Nott Terrace, who won the race. The first part of the race was run in slow time with Waters, Meyers and Hawkes keeping well bunched. At the half way mark the runners increased their speed and Waters and Eddy forged t0 the front with the other first year men falling to the rear. The order of the men as they crossed the line was as follows: Eddy 15:56, Waters (U), 15:59, Domanilo, Nolan, Tul- lock, Hagerty, Thayer (times not recorded) ; Meyers ( U) 16: 13, San- toro, (no time recorded); Hawkes (U) 16:25, Springstead (U), Mer- chant (U), Laurenski (U), Capar- ella, Shepard, Cebula and Fowler.

Dain then proceed- ed to add another lost yard to the nine and Semerad was forced to kick from well behind the Union goal line. A little slip on his part would have meant plenty at this spot in the encounter. Semerad, however, got off a good punt and the quarter became another up and down the field proposition with the visitors having the edge all the way. Schenectady, N.Y.

The referee then played tit for tat and the ball was brought back to where Semerad started his escapade and a fifteen yard pen- alty against the Union team added on for helping the runner with the ball. Semerad again was forced to punt from behind the line, the ball sailing down to Lanahan, who was held for little gain. A U. V.

Ketz's lVIen in Recent Meets R. P. I. Has Veteran Team , 'Tute Runners Have Broken ; Even in Two Meets Although the Union varsity cross- country squad is the favorite to win over the R. P. I. harriers tomorrow at Troy, it will have a tough bat- tle before it brings home the bacon. 'With a strong veteran squad con- sisting of five lettermen, the Tech runners make up a strong combin- ation. Nine men will make up the Union team: Gildo Mirate, Bill Brockwehl, Leahmon Nestle, Ed Bastedo, Jerry Neuman, Sam Hewitt, R.us Knox., Bob North, and Hal Vandecar. Bas- tedo had been unable to do much running during the week, because of a blister on his foot, but he cov- ered the usual practice course yes- terday afternoon and is sure to run tomorrow. Knox has also recovered sufficiently and his ankle will not hinder him from competing in the race. Co-Captains Should Win Co-captains Mirate and Brock- wehl, are expected to take the lead in the field tomorrow. Covering the difficult Wesleyan course last week below the record, they a1e ex.pected to lower some more records when they race at Troy. R. P. I. gave a strong C. C. N.Y. team a hard battle two weeks ago, losing by a 22 to 33 score. Last week they took over the Albany State Teachers by a perfect score. Webster, Esser, Barker, Lefkov, Farnham, Swasey, and Stearns form the nucleus of Coach Mc- Donagh's squad. R. P. I. Times Poor The time in which the first 'Tute runner covered the New York course was almost two and a half minutes over the time that Mirate and Brockwehl ran at Wesleyan. Even the first C. C. N. Y. runners were far over the 26:02 mark by the Dutchmen's last week. The runners will start off at the same time that the varsity football game is played, and are expected to reach the finish marlt near the close of the half. Frosh Race One of the best freshman cross- country teams that Union has ever turned out will race today against the R. P. I. frosh at Troy. Led by Dave Waters, Harry Myers, and Bill H;l.wkes, the Garnet harriers ought to take the R. P. I. runners in their stride. There will be some tough competition from the Tech runners in the ,person of Eoopman, a freshman who has been continu- ally leading both the freshmen and the varsity in the daily trials. Five others, Laurenski, :Merchant, Springsted, Shepard and Fowler will complete the Union freshman team. Waters clipped the frosh course record last Saturday to 15:59, coming three seconds after John Eddy, N'ott Terrace speedster. During the week the yearlings have shown fine form in their trials. Shepard and Fowler cut down their time also in the trial-s to 17:29, thereby earning the place on the team that runs at Troy. FOOTBALL TICl(ETS The sale of ticl{ets for the Union• R. P.

PRICE FIVE CENTS Dutchmen Gunning For 1wenty-fifth Win Over Trojans Teams Meet in Thirty-fourth Annual Encounter at Troy Tomorrow Afternoon Dain to Call Signals Four Sophomores in Starting Lineup; Woodruff to Play By MILTON D. BEDELL Tomorrow afternoon at Troy at 2:15 p. m., Union and R. P. I. will renew their annual grid rivalry which began 49 years ago. Thirty- three games have been played in this ,;erie,; of duels, with Union fa1· in the front by virtue of her 24 wins. Six of the battles have fall- en to the Engineers with three re- sulting in ties. The Engineers have been unable to score against their opponents this year, having bleen blanked by St. Lawrence, Vermont, ClarkBon, and Trinity. No illusions are held however, to the effect that R. P. I., will be a pushover for the Hafleld- men. Although a beaten and blank- ed team, Coach Kumpfs men have met some of the strongest little col- lege teams in this part of the coun- try. Clarkson, with an exceptionally strong eleven, was held to two touchdowns by the Trojans. Sawyer Is R. P. I. Threat What will probably instill fear in all Union rooters is the return of Bud Sawyer to the R. P. I. line-up. Last year Sawyer spent the after- noon sweeping through the Union defense to score two touchdowns. On the opening kick-off he gathered the bail in and proceeded to rip off 60 yards through the entire Garnet eleven for a touchdown. In the last quarter he intercepted a Union pass on his own 45-yard marker and romped down the sidelines for his second tally. This year Sawyer has been able to do little in the line of offensive tactics. He has been stop- ped in his tracks in practically every game. Twelve men who saw service in the Union game last year have re- turned to the folds of the Cherry team. The graduation of Myers and Suk, two other menaces last year, has considerably weakened the back- field, their positions being filled by sophomores. Parry, Fiori, Dugan, Zazetti, Smith, Davey, Eckhardt, Ward, Powers, Russ Schwarting, Rennie; Van Rensselaer, Kolezar and Pfau are the most formidable men on the eleven. Kolezar, it will be remembered, scored a field goal against the Garnet last year. Line-up Uncertain Coach Hatfield is still uncertain og his starting line-up against R. P. I. It seems certain, however, that Joe Milano will not be on the field at the opening whistle, Don- ald Liffiton filling his berth. Van Waldron will probably be on the bench also, his place bein taken by Dick Woodr-uff. Woodruff has been displaying a fine brand of bail lately and may prove his worth if he gets his chance. There is also a possi- bility that Captain \Chip\ Dain will call the signals for the Dutchmen. . Coa~h Hatflel~ ha.s been drilling mtenSively on h1s running plays in an attempt to get the timing down perfectly. Yesterday was spent in defense work against R. P. I. passes, supposedly their strong point. The offensive of the eleven has been vastly improved. In the scrimmage against the freshmen Wednesday the varsity made several long gain~ and tallied two touchdowns. The game will start at 2:15p.m. \ ... * Ralph Semerad, Ernie Brown and Joe . Milano have been practicing puntmg and have been putting the pigskin out better than 60 yards. . ... Coach Hatfield has been putting the team through a series of new shifts and is hopeful they will im- prove the offensive strength of his charges.

For the first time in several years a contract has been drawn up which promises publication riot later than Junior Prom- weekend which is scheduled for May 3 and 4, 1935. The early publication date ·will . be made possible by the fact that all pictures are being taken now and will go to the engravers on December 15. Modernistic design will prevail throughout the book something which has not been tried befo!\e in ·The Garnet. Due to the reduced appr·opriation from the student tax it has been necessary to make th~ design simple, yet aLtractive. The staff has acquired an engraver to do this work in such manner that the c<>ntral theme of the book will be continuous and the art work will be a perfectly balanced design. In the past The Garnet has been strictly a student publication with no campaign ever being m~de to sell copies outside of the student body. This year The Garnet will be offered to alumni at a reduced rate from the previous price for single copies.

The red-head had a comparatively easy time in smashing out his· fourth victory, sweeping Moffett before him to the tune of 6-1, 6-2. Previously Stroebel had received a bye in the first round, after which he defeated Jerry Rosen. Rosen of- fered the most competition that the sorrel-top has thus for encountered. taking one set out of the three. Hym Enzer. '38, was the next vic- tim and offered little opposition. In the quarter finals, George Mc- Gee likewise proved ineffective against Stroebel's swift but accu- rate driving, and was taken in stride, winning only four games. Moffett, the latest conquest, is a veteran membet· of the Garnet court squad. Tomorrow afternoon the two fin- nlists nrc schedu!Ni to mPet in n 1 three out of five set encounter for the championship. Hawley, like . Stro.-bel, bus thus far failed to meet any ~tel iuu,; difficulty in hb four previous matches, losing b.ut one set. The match will be played on one of the varsity courts.

The eight men- Paul Beik, Ernest Brown, Hugh R. Elwyn, Rankine G. Hinman, Seymore A. Horowitz, Ralph D. Semerad, William A.

U:appa's Aim After welcoming the new mem- bers in the name of Phi Beta Kappa, Dr. Shimer continued, \Phi Beta Kappa stands for that all- around knowledge and that general mental capacity which makes a man free and creative; which makes him feel at home in the world and gives him the confidence and bearing which is readily dis- tinguished from empty bravado and the bliss of Ignorance. \From that early day when life on earth was represented by uni- cellular creatures like amoeba ~ond germs, reproducing sexually by fission, giving birth to offspring and dying in the act, demanding neither husbands nor gra:veyards, growing up quickly to care for themselves-since that day through the succeeding millions of years youth has been lengthening, the parent has been surviving for longer and longer periods after re- production.

Wainger's talk in daily assembly Saturday morning. 'Dr. Wainger first discussed the matter of the student's ability to choose his own courses. He s.tated that the students usually chose their courses because the subject was easy or interesting, or the in- structor was congenial, or the course fitted an open hour in his schedule. Because of this, he said the students were incapable of de- ter·mining their own educational programs. He then said that this was no affront to the students be- cause it was his experience that the faculty was almost as much at sea when they attempt to deter- mine educational objectives and programs. Dr. Wainger said in explanation of the integration of courses and the reason for it: \You will under- stand, then, what I mean by the integration of college courses. Within the individual course it in- volves such treatment of the ma- terial as will bring out the relations of the subject to other subjects. In the arrangement of the student's program, it involves combining courses that will lead in a natural order to a definite educational ob- jective. \Now let me try to explain why I emphasize this problem of inte- gration ..

One student raised the objection that there was too mUch singing at student body meetings and ma·de a motion that singing be limited to but one song in the future meet- ings. After the motion was second- ed, T~d Whipple, '35, defended the present arrangement by stating that when the status of student meetings was 'reorganized last year, it was agt·eed that a college song would be sung at the conclusion. Whipple's statement was received with much enthusiasm, and the re- sult was that the motion was over- whelmingly defeated. .

A pair of very earnest bo.bbies appeared on the scene and with short dispatch dispersed the m.ore eager battlers, and several pates were soundly whacked. The brilliant young Union frosb mentor was beset by a pa-ir of en- gineers who were eag·er for the fray and a bit. to put it as delicate- ly as possible, under the weather. Outside intervention averted fur- ther difficulty and most of the bel- ligerent parties were calmed. The gist of this rather wordy de- scription is that the· R. P.

Value of Backg1·ounds Claims Local Background to Be Important Element \History has busied itself too ex- clusively with the life story of the state. Actually, national govern- ment, especially in America where the sphere of private liberty has been so large, bas affected us com- P<:ratlve!y little,\ declared Dr. D1xon Ryan Fox at the annual din- ner meeting of the Westchester County Historical Association held last night in Bronxville, N. Y. Dr. and Mrs. Fox were guests of honor at the meeting, and Dr. Fox, who was for fifteen years first vice-president of the society, deliv- ered the principal address. Taking as his theme, \The Value of Backgrounds,\ Dr. Fox empha- sized the importance of the work of local historical societies in mak- ing real to a community the rich backgrounds of its institutions and traditions. \.A successful commun- ity is one surcharged with common interests,\ said Dr. Fox, \and no common intere.st draws men and women closer together than a com- mon interest in the local past. Local Historians Valuable Assets \The officers and staffs of local historical societies are to be reck- oned distinguished assets of a com- munity, along with the manufac- turel·s, builders or railroads, and the founders of churches and schools. The donors who have laid foundations for these worlts must rank with those who have sustain- ed the hospitals and charitable in- stitutions. Indeed, it may be said that this cultural enterprise of stewarding the past, less visible and direct in Its benefits, will find support only in a happy blend of intelligence and sentiment. History is good for everybody, but not everybody knows it. \Local history is often thought dreary if there are no battles to chronicle. And in time the battles, with all their courage and patriot- ism, themselves grow dreary. But is this background of patriotism, this background of courage under fire the only background worth cherishing? Are there not other human vutues which have been practised and exemplified in our own communities which are wmthy to inspire future generations? liife Built on Past \Imagine if you can the impossi- bility of physical progress if eal!h generation bad to be pioneers, if each departing generation toolt with them all their a;ccomplish- ments and their successors had to begin again to clear the forest. <Continued on Page 4) Psi Upsil()n Founded To Counteract Practices of Old Literary Societies By DONALD C.

I., Complete Five Passes, Two Accounting for Scores By WILLIAM E. FERGUSON Featuring longt runs, perfect passing, excellent blocking and hard tackling, a snappy Union Col- lege eleven took advantage of the few brealc;; offered it and swarmed over a courageous R. P. I. aggre- gation on '87 Field at Troy Satur- day by the score of 18 to 6. Fot the first time this season Union's ground attack looked fairly good. For the first time this season the Trojans scored a touchdown. For the first time this season someone else besides Ralph Semerad sc0red for the Garnet and for the first time this sea.son Union's score has been more than seven points. the better of the kicking, but the Trojans managed to keep the play on Union ground with the bail on the Dutchmen's 12 ya!'d line when the per1od ended. Dain Scores The first score of the game came in the second period. Leon Nagus- zewski, blond giant center of the Ga:rnet, and Charlie Krull, who was a tower of defensive strength, re- covered a fumble made by an R. P. I. back on the Engineer's 24 yard mark. Captain Chip Dain, who called the Union signals gain- ed four yards, but Semerad lost them on -the next play. A pass from Dain to Don I..iffiton gained three yards. On the fourth down, with the Cherry and White con- templating a possible Union punt, Semerad feinted back and tossed a pretty spiral pass to Chip Dain, who outran two of the enemy, caught the pass and fell over the goal line as he was being tackled. Semerad's place kick was wide and the gaining tactics of both sides were over for the first half. Series of Forwards Produce R. P. I.

The 'Tute run- ners took the lead and maintained it to the end. Koopman, star har- rier for the R. P. I. cubs, crossed the finish line first in 14 minutes and 59 seconds, excellent time for the two mile course at Troy, Bill Hawkes was the first Union man to finish, coming in fifth in 15:40. He was preceded by Hitch- c0ck, Geisker,and Bridgewater. Harry Myers and Dave Waters, the Garnet yearlings' best men scored sixth and seventh, while Dale Springsted and Orville Shepard breasted the tape ninth and tenth. Laurenski trailed next to last. Dave Waters, number one man on the Union squad, failed to mal\e his usual good showing against the Tech harriers, running a slow and labored race. Marshall of R. P.

Next Saturday the Freshmen will nold their last meet th1s season here against the Christian Brothers Acarlemy. It was a gala field day for the Gar- net varsity. To be sure, 1t was their aerial attack that cinched the game for the visitors, but it was heady, smart football by an alert team tha:t piled up those eighteen points against a stubborn Cherry and White eleven, which in the middle of the third period culminated a seventy yard march down the field for their first 1934 touchdown and almost immediately afterward pro- ceeded to return the ball 50 ya·rds to the Union 10 yard stripe before they could be stopped. A team that would not be beaten took the game from a team that had outrushed them twelve fhst downs to five and had gained 240 yards frorr. scrimmage to seventy fol' the Dutchmen.

And, there- First Snowfall of the Year fore, his economic opinions il1flu- · By ROBERT C. NORTH In an open truck filled with blan- kets eleven members of the Union College Outing Club left the cam- pus Saturday evening for the east- ~rn Bhore of Lal;e George. WhE'n they reached Glens Falls, snow was already falling, and such a chill wind blew that each one burrowed into the blankets and doubled into knots to keep warm. After leaving the truck near Pilot Knob, they tramped into the v-.•oods to a, point well sheltered by pin trees and spread blanltets over piles of dead needles. While each one fixed his own favorite bed fold, a shivering dog appeared from the woods and watched the pro- ceedings with wistful interest. When a biting puff of wind blew in from the lake, she would cover her nose with her paws and whine. When the last bed had been care- fully made, she glanced at each in turn, then trotted over to Fred Wyatt's, But Fred was already snoring, and she turned away dis- tastefully. Russ Knox had warm blankets, but ao cold heart. She prudently left him alone. She paw- ed at another roll, but there was only a freshman inside, and he didn't really count. Then she found Bob North. He seemed to appreciate her company, and his bed was warm. She curled at his feet with a sigh. His blan- kets had delightfully strange scents, too,-exotic odors of South American jungles and open pam- pas. But alas, she was not to rest pea:cefully that night. Soon she got up and tip-toed away. After all, how was she to know that South American fleas hide in woolen blankets and are particu- larly vicious in cold weather? ence his religious views, and his political affiliations affect his po- etry. W'hat we must do, therefore, is to put together the abstracted parts of a man whid1 W(! have been analyzing and integrate them into a living whole.\ In conclusion Dr. \Yaingcr said that the responsibility lies with the student, that the teacher can lead the student to knowledge but he can not make him learn. \Once in a while you meet the teacher who is able to kindle the spark of im- agination in the student and blow it up into a flame. From that point of view the highest compli- ment you can pay to an instructor is to go up to him and say, 'Sir, you burn me up'. \ ---0-·-- Histol'y Has Busied Itself With Life of the State <Continued from Page 1) How purposeless would seem our lives! New methods and new con- trols of the material world have made many old things obsolete; yet every one of them in giving something to improve upon is a part of the living edifice of civil- iza:tion, entitled to respect. \The material fabric of life i::; r-ot all that we inherit. Far more im- portant is thP legacy of institu- tions, customs and ideals. J:f we had to invent every social device we use we would be far more handicapped than if we had to build the material world of civil- ization anew. \The citizen, especially the young of what he sees each day. To him a bui.Jding is not a: mere physi.::al fact, a social practice is not simply so much activity. He sees the lively dead behind them. He sees a pro- cess as if in a moving picture. He lives a larger, deeper life than those whose vision lacks this third dimension a:nd who are blind to the inner view.\ ---·-o·--- Psi lJ psilon Founded To Counteract Old Societies <·Continued from Page 1) bership from all undergraduates. Wililam Taylor of the class of 1838 was the first \Frosh\ initiate. Ordi- nary business meetings were held in rooms of its members. Special meetings were held in a tavern \longroom.\ With the establishment of new chapters Psi Upsilon h<LS spread into twenty-eight other colleges and universities including two Canadian chapters. l!ntil this fall the Alpha at Harvard was the only one in- active. This was a record unequal- ed by any general college frater- nity. Due to college regulations at Yale the Beta chapter' is now in- active. Seven out of the first class of fourteen Psi-U's graduated at Union were elected to Phi Beta Kappa. During the first 25 years of Psi Upsilon, 70 of its 201 initiates were elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Psi Upsilon has produced many illus- trious alumni including Chester Adam Arthur, Union 1848, Presi- dent of the United States, and William Howard Taft, Yale 1878 President of the United States and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
