THE OHA.N·GED TITLE. A gay young 1nan at n hoar<ling school, A long tailed-coat and a fancy cane ; A Senior, too, I'd have you know, And '' Senior \ there is no mean name. A Freshman now, and nothing more, And \Freshie \Fresh \0-Fresh they call. A change of title gJ'eat indeed, Fro1n '' Senior \ down to '' Fresh \ to fall. But though he fill a humble place, And though there come a taunting sneer, By f:1r than Senior there again, He'd rather be a Freshman here. A grave young man on a college green, A high silk hat and a limber cane; A Senio1· too, with revel'end mien. And •; Senior\ there is a noble uame. A F1·eshman into the worlJ he goes, And \greenie \only a boy,\ they call. A change of title, great ind8ed, From \ Senior \ down to \ Fresh \ to fall. But though he fill a h u1nble place, A brighter, better day is n~ar; Ey far than S~nior there again, He'd rather be a Freslunan here. A gray-haired man on a shady poTch, A trem hling hand and a trusty cane ; A Senior, true, with his frm~ty locks, For '' Senior \ now is a ti1nely name. The~·river Death is flowing by,_ He almost hears the boatman's call. '' For new and everlasting youth Let now thy title, • Senior' fall.\ Methinks I see him gently glide Across the flood, without a fear, And catch an Echo from the tide ' \ Than Senior there, 'tis l?etter here.\

An Engineering student had, in the early part of the year, tnade arrangements with the President and Faculty to complete the studies of the scientific course with a view to graduating A. B. He, of course, had not taken the regular ora tori cal course. He ranked high. Our an1bitious Senior goes secretly to the Profec;;sor of ()ratory and in- dulges in conversation prejudicial to his classmate's appointment to the stage. He also confesses to have seen the President with reference to the n1atter, and \vhen asked the nature of his mission, has no reply to make. Some of the facts leaked out and the indig- nation was great throughout the college. A meeting of the Senior class \vas promptly called, and after a dignified consideration of the evidence a resolution of censure was pass- ed against the gentletnan for having, in an underhanded way and for the sake of selfish ends, interfered with the work of a class- mate. We have stated the case as it IS. We desire to be just. vVhi le vve pity any person for such weakness in resisting ten1 ptation, \Ve must condeml: the act. He had a perfect right to desire an appointment to the stage, and to expect fair oompetition, but he should have acted openly. Only two effects could result from the course which he took, with the object he had in view, viz: either that an AN EDUCATOR of yonng men said to the writer that 1f Union College would only make her entrance exan1inations harder and turn irorn her doors those students· whom she is compelled to drop afterwards, the col- lege would go,up \like a rocket\ in the es- timation of educated men throughout the country. It is a well known fact that the entrance examinations are not as severe as the high standing of the college justifies, and this fact keeps rnany from COIJ?ing to the col-· lege who might otherwise be persuad~d to do so. Let us suppose a case. A young man decides to go to college. He has spent some years in preparation and is thoroughly prepared to enter any college. A con1panion of his, his inferior intellectu.ally, and some years beneath him in studies, (we have sev- eral cases of this kind in mind now,) comes to Union and enters. Even though he tnay be sifted out ~n a year and co1npelled to leave, the very fact that he had entered IS an argu- ment n1ore eloquent than words. The other does not look at the fact that his companion has been \plucked.\ He sin1ply vvill not cltoose a college which his cornpanion, whom he knows to have been insufficient! y prepared, 1\as entered. If this evil \vas corrected n1an y n1ore \Vould come fron1 the large cities near us. Union presents many superior advantages to them, 1: c I A t ' \ l: t ( s . 1 . 1 ( ) ( t f r c:: t t ,.. c l f ( ' ..

THE CONCORDIENSIS. I l 5 but this one fact throws discredit upon the whole work of the college. The argument :may appear puerile or falla- cious. It may 1ook upon its face as absurd. It can be readily answered by those who know whereof they speak when they say that the students of :Union are doing excellent work. Nevertheless it is a reason of great weight. If anyone does not believe it he has but to try and urge certain classes of students to come here and he will soon find the force of the argument. We would not have our n1eaning misunder- stood. The upper classmen are the equals intellectually and rnorally of the san1e classes in any college in the country. Fifty per centum is a large loss of n1embership in two years, but such is the actual loss, and the greater portion of these students are dropped because they cannot keep up w·ith their \v-ork. We have broken very tar away from the past, but this one retic remains. We earnestly hope, for the good of the colleg-e, that at the co1ni11g examinations the standard of admit- tance may be raised; that the requirements for entering the scientific course be made an adequate test, and that the ·examinations for the classical course be made n1ore thorough. PROBABLY the amount of active training in the gymnasium or the interest displayed in athletics generally has not been greater for several years past than during the present season. It would seem that at no other tin1e has there been so favorable indications of a fine athletic contest as this spring. We have several fine runners and walkers and n1an y other athletes who would have made almost any event exciting. Yet when two or three weeks before an announcement was rnade that the spring athletic contest would take place May 17th, no attention seems to have been paid to it and the appointed day passed without games. What is the matter? A screw is loose somewhere. Many good athletes have expressed a desire for a spring rneeting. The students thetnselves are to bl:ime. We do not biame them for not striv- ing for prizes which are liable to be tin, sil- ver, gold or brass Indifferently, but \Ve do blame then1 for not perfecting a college A tbletic i\ssociat1on in \vhich all n1ight place confidence. \Ve strenuously urg-ed such a step last season, and \Ve predict that no suc- cessful field-tneeting \vill be held so long as we have no stable association \V hich shall be run for the students and by the students. With a gy·mnasium excelled by few in the country, a campus excelled by none, a beau- tiful park, a fine race course, and plenty of good athletes-in the light of all this, such a failure as characterized the late attempt to have a spring meeting appears and is rnere nonsense. There 1s time for a contest yet, if the right course might only be pur.sucd. THE lecture course of the present Senior class is especially good. Pres. Potter's lec- tures in connection with the study of the Constitution have furnished much useful in- formation, and Dr. Coppee's treatment of International Law is highly appreciated by the class. The Doctor has addeci two lec- tures on Hamlet in his Shakespearean course. These will be open to the public. We hope to persuade him also to deliver again his lec- ture upon Rorneo and J u1iet. It -vvas given before in the morning, and few of the lovers of Shakespeare fron1 the city \Vere present. We can assure the Doctor of a full house and the audience a very pleasant hour if this lec- ture is repeated. Rev. Dr. Washburn finished his course oi four lectures upon ''Old English\ on the 23d inst. His subject vvas one which is each year gaining interest, and \vhich in itself would attract many hearers; but \Vith Dr. Washburn's scholarly treatment and excel- lent delivery, the lectures possessed unusual attractions.

Tribune, has been called to Europe, and will be unable to appear before the class. Rev. Mr. Griffis is also unable to deliver his lectures upon Japanese Art this year. Those gentlemen who heard hitn last year will be glad now they did not \vait for a better op- portunity. We believe that Mr. E. P. Tread\vell, of Albany, con1pletes the list of lecturers for this term. His subject is Decorative Art. This gentleman cornes to us with the highest com- mendations from 1nen who should know his ability. No doubt his lecture will be pleas- ing and valuable. qu1te a different thing if the positions were reversed. ., here are many things conducive to a poor throw besides lack ,of skill, and there are plenty of chances for a ball to pass a player, particularly upon the ca:rnpus, even when it would seem to be almost in his hands. The \vhole of the matter may be summed up in the following advice: Cheer on and en- courage your Nine, applaud their good plays, and do not dishearten them by con- tinued adverse criticism. THE GARNET. '\fhat long-expected issue, T/ze Garnet, has at last made its appearance, and is now before us.

It is with sincere regret that Vfe find our- selves called to record the lamentable and untimely death of Niiss Mattie W. Fuller, ot Troy, which has occurred since our last issue of Tke Concordz'enszs. This estimable young lady \'vas the daughter of Mr. Jos. W. Fuller, one of Dur Trustees, who has given the col- lege beneficent proofs of his interest, and the sister of 1\'lrs. Potter, the excellent wife of our President. Social, graceful and unusually accornplish- ,ed, she had a large ctrcle of warm and ad- miriug friends in her own city, and was known to ~many in Schenectady through her ready and charmiag participation in those si~mple but elegant entertainments which from ti:tne to tin1e have been provided for our students by Dr. Mrs. Potter at the presiden- tial rnansion. Thoroughly educated, and happy in the pursuit of general culture, she had profited by tours of travel in Europe, in the stu.d y ot modern languages and their literatures, and gave promise of a happy life of ~reat useful- ness. Our good Lord> who does all things well, had other and brighter things in store for her, and her friends are left to weep and \Vonder and bow in resignation to His holy will. 'fo thetn the tender words of Bryant recur \vith striking force: '' Death hath come Gently to one of gentle mould like thee, As light winds wandering through the groves of bloom Detacb the delicate blosso1ns from the tree. 01ose thy sweet eyes calmly and without pain, And we will trust in God to see thee yet again.\ CO~RESPONDENCE. To the Editors of 1 Ju Concord£enszs: There is a large chance that this rna v be ..1 considered by son1e of your readers as one of that class of comtnunications that \corrupt good 1nanners,\ but it is because I consider the columns ot your paper the best place in which to discuss college matters that I ad- dress you at this time. The Freshman \vho \vas hazed lately by some Sophon1ores, and \vho brought a suit-at-law against his torn1en- tors, has been published as a baby and is be- ing 1nade to feel the odium that attaches it- self to a student who carries a college n1attcr outside the college. Now l do not propose to defend his action in bringing a~ suit for datnages, for I think he n1ade a n1istake in ·doing so, but at the same time I \Vish to say --I think it downright brutality to tnake the tnan uncon1fortable because of an error he

,.; 118 THE CONCORDIENSIS~ . has committed. There is a sort of code of students~ ethics, which has never taken any form that is tangible, and it is wide enough to ~take in, as a breach of it, any thing that • happens to offend the student-mind. The whole \vorld is easilv divided into Union ./ College and things outside of Union College. Now this imaginary code says that this Freshman must not seek redress for his griev- ances outside of the college and, inside the college, he must not appeal to the Faculty or any of the college authorities. That leaves· htm to find champions for his cause an1ong the students, three-fourths of \vhon1 he knou's will be enlisted on the other side if he is a '' miserable Fresh\ and h1s opponents are Sophotnores. In short, this code provides that he shall not make any defence at all but shall just su b1nit to all forms of abuse, in which case he will be called a baby and cow- ard and come off no better, but rather worse than if he fails to regard this code and seeks any redre~s that he may fancy. Some Fresh- nlen have come off very well by providing themselves, as a prophylactic measure, with fire-arn1s backed up with enough grit to dis- charge them \vhen they thoug-ht the occasion demanded. I don't feel like recomtnending this in all cases, but it's the only way to avoid being abused that the code fails to touch, and has heretotore brought forth bet- ter results than anything else that has been tried. This code, as it now exists, is just rank nonsense and the rnan who vvill be gov- erned by it ought to be driven fron1 the col- lege. I don't uphold \peaching\ to the Faculty, but I do maintain that if a man con- sents to be governed by this intangible code, that is susceptible to n1odifications to fit any occasion, he renders his condition worse than that of any slave in existence or in his- tory.

It \vas then, in the third inning, that our n1en began to sho\v signs of fright--of utter dernoralization. which 111anifested itself in such a brilliant and long-continued series of wild thro\ving, pep- pered \Vith 111 uffing and fu n1 b lillg, as had nev-er before been \vitnessed in a match on our grounds.
