THE con1n1encen1ent exercises began Sunday even- ing, June z zd, with the preaching of the Bacca- laureat~ sern1on by_ the Rev. K. C. Anderson, of Troy, N. Y., in the First Refon11ed church. This discourse was thoroughly appreciated by all and was pronounced a 1nost eloquent effort. At three o'clock Monday afternoon the senior class 1narched in a _body fro1n the chapel to the College grove, where the following program was carried out : Music. Singing of Co-ca-che-lunk by the class. Ivy Oration,· G. F. Allison. Music. Ivy Poem, C. A. Kitts. The class then sang \It was My Last Cigar.\ Pipe Oration, J. Stoller. I I The College Pipe of Peace was then passed to slow 1 music. Pipes and tobacco were handed around, and ; the exercises, which had proved very enjoyable, came 1 to a close with the singing of the \Terrace Song'' and ! the \Song to Old Union.\ j In the evening, at the First Reforn1ed church, the ·Class Day exercises took place. Pron1ptly at 8 o'clock Parlatti's Orchestra rendered some very bea\}tiful n1usic, after which the president, Pickens Neagle, wei- coined those present, and then introduced the follow- ing gentle1nen : Orator, Poet, Historian, . Prophet, Addresser, Music. Music. W. A. :Moore. J. B. Hutchison. Dow Beekman. F. Dixon Hall. Daniel Naylon, Jr. Tuesday opened a beautiful day. Although the number of alumni present was less than in previous years, they made up in their enthusiasn1 for the welfare of the College what they lacked in numbers. The election of a trustee in place of rThon1as H. Fearey, of Albany, whose tern1 of office had expired, was the first I business to be transacted. It was half-past three o'clock before the tellers had finished the counting of the votes. They then announced as the result of the ballot that Dr. Alexander, of New York, had received 748 votes, and Judge Hooper C. VanVorst, of New York, 35 6 votes. rfhe Altunni then proceeded in a body to Memorial Hall. Judge Yates, '54, was chosen to preside and in the course of his re1narks referred to the rather informal lunch which had been provided. Prof. Vvells called upon the oldest graduate present, the Rev. J. R. Boyd, D.D., '22. Dr. Boyd said that \out of our class of seventy-seven men only five are now living. This is the second visit I have paid the College since my graduation-the first ten years ago- but my failure to co1ne oftener has been owing to 1ny ill- health.\ John H. Burtis rose to the call for '54, and after speaking for some time, moved that a com1nittee of five be appointed by Judge Yates, himself to be chair- man, to provide a banquet for next year, and to solicit subscriptions fron1 the graduates for that purpose. Ron. Le Mott W. Rhodes, of Troy, a trustee, apol-

A number of graduates, atnid 1nuch enthusiasn1, spoke briefly of the bright future of the College, and called upon the alumni to assist Union in regaining that position to which her reputation, her faculty, and her alu1nni entitled her. The song of \Old Union\ was then sung by the alumni, standing, and after the giving of the college cry, the alumni meeting came to an end. A large number acco1npanied the men1bers of the class of '54 to the chapel, where they listened to a very able ad- dress by Judge :Bennett, '54, of Chicago, and the fol- lowing poen1 by the Rev. E. W. Rice, of Philadelphia: TRICENNIAL DAY.- 1854-1884. \ Thirty years have passed,\ they say, Though it was but yesterday Boys, with swelling pride we bore Mystic parchments from yon door. We are young : the morning sun Lights the race \Ve 've just begun. Life 's a Rip Van Winkle dream; Actors seldom what they seem; Strange, these lads with heads of gray; \ Lawyers, Doctors,\ do you say? \Clergy Judges,\ grave and wise? Nay; they're boys; you fool my eyes! Call the roll. Where eighty trod, Part are here and part with God. With shattered ranks, on we tread, Weaving chaplets for the dead. In the thickest of the fight, One by one we drop from sight. Fierce the combat, right with wrong, . On, ye valiant, swell our throng : Riches, honor, place and fame Are but rattles round one's name; Life is earnest, life is grand, \Vhen for truth and God we stand. Times are changing: gold is god; Schools must pander to its nod. Classic culture; what a waste; Lighter learning suits the taste; Wealth for show, and greed for gain, Skill in tricks: such graces reign. Price of stocks in Greek sounds queer, \ Puts and Calls \ at Latin sneer, Gossip wails through Syriac, Fashion dies in Arabic. Sterling virtue shames such day) Truest worth is flung away. Honored men who trained our youth, Higher good and grander truth Pointed out from Ida's peak, Pearls on Zion's hill to seek, And if humble in the strife, Virtue, worth:, exalt our life. Sons of genius : men of brains, Ruled these halls, where science reigns; Few remain; the more above, Green forever in our iove. Mark the two from foreign clime, How they tnade their lives sublime.* He who measured depths in space, Weighed the worlds on worlds. which grace Starry gardens in the sky; Counts he now the worlds on high? t Crowned, thou Christian scholar rare, King supreme in Attic chair, Mighty time-worlds he outlined, God's creative week defined.t Blessings on thee, man of might, Master in the rule of right, Versed in science of the mind, Royal thinker of thy kind.

The prize speaking of the juniors and sophon1ores took place in the evening. Owing to a heavy shower of rain which had fallen early in the evening the church was comfortably filled. After the n1usic the following sophomores and juniors contested for the prizes : SOPHOMORES. Edwin C. Angle, Schenectady, James J. Franklin, Jr., Albany, J. L. R. Pratt, Kansas City, Mo., Music.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 1 39 co1ninencen1ent exercises, for four years looked forward to by the class of '84. The exercises opened with music by Parlatti's orchestra, which was followed by the singing of the I I 7th Psaln1 by the audience. The Rev. Dr. Payne and all present then joined in the recitation of the Lord's Prayer. After the salutatory by Wilber M. Judd, of Jewett, the following seniors delivered orations : John S. :Bishop, Lyons, John F. Delaney, Albany, An Unsolved National Problem. Wendell Phillips. James G. Greene, Clyde, The Problem of the Pole. Fred. Dixon Hall, Antwerp, Andrew McFarlane, Albany, Pickens Neagle, Washington, D. C., The Iconoclasts. The Irish Question. To the Victors Belong the Spoils. Harry V. N. Philip, New York, Marathon. James J. Ke1np, of Ballsville, V a. ; Herbert G. Por- cher, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Willimn G. Woolford, Princess Anne, Md., were appointed to the commence- ment stage, but were excused. Dr. Potter then introduced Professor Coppee, of Lehigh ·university, who delivered the Chancellor's address. This address, on the subject of health, was rich in thought and abounded in suggestions which it would be well for every one who heard it to heed. DEGREES CONFERRED. At the close of the address the graduating class marched upon the stage and honorary degrees were conferred as follows: A. B. upon n1en1bers of the graduating class; LL.D., D. S. Merrill, United States Consul at Jerusalem, and the Hon. Samuel Hand, of Albany; D.O., the Rev. William Elliot Griffis, pastor of the First Reformed church of Schenectady, the Rev. K. C. Anderson, of Troy, and the Rev. Edwin W. Rice, of Philadelphia. PRIZES AWARDED. /The following were the recipients of the prizes : Warner prize, for general excellence, a silver cup, Jan1es G. Greene, of Clyde. The report of the co1nmittee appo!nted to award the prizes to the successful competitors on the junior and sophomore stages was read by the Rev. E. L. Toy, of ~chenectady. The prizes were n1oney. The first junior prize was awarded to W aUace Foote, of Port Henry ; WilFam C. Mill, of Gloversville, second; honorable mention, Charles S. Stanton, of Albany. Sophomores : Jatnes J. Franklin, Jr., of Albany, first; Edwin C. Angle, of Schenectady, second. The Clark essay prizes, consisting of books, were awarded, first to C. Eggleston, of Gloversville; second to J. T. Morey. The report was read by John V. L. Pruyn, of Albany. Dow Beekman, of Middleburgh, received the first Allen prize for essays; R. B. McCown, of Darlington, S. C., the second, and J an1es Stoller, of Johnstown, ~ third. The prizes consist of n1oney. The report was read by Judge Danforth,. of l\1iddleburgh. The Ingham essay prize of 1noney was awarded to Dow Beelnnan, of Middleburgh. The report was read by the Rev. Mr. Snively, of Troy. The Blatchford oratorical n1edals were taken, first by John F. Delaney, of Albany, and second by H. V. N. Philip, of New York city; honorable n1,ention, An- /' drew McFarlane, of Albany. V Previous to the presentation of prizes the song of \ Old Union\ was sung with fine effect. The exer- cises closed with the benediction pronounced by Dr. I-Iarrison, of Troy. THE RECEPTION. Dr. and Mrs. Potter held the usual reception at 8 o'clock in Memorial Hall, to which all were invited. But owing to the escape of gas the reception was brought to a sudden close about 9 o'clock, as it was considered dangerous to ren1ain longer in the building. Those who intended to participate in the ball pro- ceeded at once to Washburne Me1norial Hall. About seventy-five couples were in attendance, but on ac- count of the coolness of the evening all danced with pleasure. It was not until late in the n1orning that '84's con1n1encen1ent ball came to an end. IVY POEM. BY CHARLES A. KITTS. COME, classmates, all, let joy abound, For we are soon to sever; We '11 let the pipe of peace go round Ere we part, perhaps forever. We're now to leave those sacred halls, Although we fain would linger; Leave campus, garden, those gray walls, Where wisdom lifts her finger. The golden chain of friendship bright, Which links our hearts together, Before we part we ·'11 bind more tight, That it may hold us, ever. Draw hither now at friendship's shrine, Her living emblem bringing, And plant the sacred ivy vine With happy voices ringing .. We '11 cleave the sod close to the side Of our dear al1na mater;

THE CONCORDIENSIS. With fondest hopes as its roots we hide, That our vine may soon grow greater. We '11 hallow then its earthy bed, The rich mold softly pressing, And leave it where bright heaven will shed In pearly drops its blessing. And as its tendrils to those walls Shall cling, much grace bestowing, So may our love for these dear halls Be ever warmly glowing. And when above this ivy vine The stars are shining brightly, Or when the pale moon's silver sheen Falls on its leaves so lightly. Then may kind Fortune upon us shed Rich gifts with fondest blessing, As through life's mazy paths we tread, With varied footsteps pressing. And as we leave this classic spot, Our faces homeward turning, May no dark cloud our friendship blot, Or quench its fires now burning. And when Time's shadows o'er us fall, And life's bright sun is setting, While far away we hear a call, This world the while forgetting. Oh ! then this emblem yet will twine Will speak of life immortal, Beyond the vail at Heaven's shrine, Within her shining portal. This day fond memory takes me back To childhood's happy hours, As out o'er life's unbeaten track, I gazed on fairest flowers. A world lay spread beneath my feet, With pathways far and near, Each leading on to joys more sweet And pleasures yet more dear. vVhen, truly, ignorance was bliss, More bright, more sunny still Than all the love of 'that or this That ere the mind could fill. Gladly I looked out o'er the field, My childhood's vision bound, Gladly I ran, my soul to yield, To pleasure's merry sound. My waking thoughts were day dreams bright, Tinged with a roseate hue, As onlyJancy in her flight Spreads out to childhood's view. How happy then the hours that passed, No clouds shadowed my mind, Life's brilliant sun his radiance cast, And each with silver lined. But soon this witching scene did change To one of grander view: Of wider and more varied range, While over me it threw Bewitching charms to lead me on, In paths unseen before, Where pleasure moved amid a throng Unnumbered as sands on shore. I gazed around, intent on what This vision did portray; And, lo! at this enchanting spot My childhood passed away. And youth, bright youth, I did behold Come springing, fresh and gay, While slowly up a curtain rolled Where, op'ning far away, Were vistas winding on, 'mid scenes Of wondrous beauty bright, And hope immortal shed her beams, Like dazzling rays of light. As one entranced, I stood and gazed, My soul with rapture thrilled, Till this bright scene my vision dazed, My bounding pulses stilled. Then when a footstep, soft and light, I heard- it sounded near- I turned and saw, like star of night, A beauteous form appear. A glow upon her features played, Her eyes were without compare, A crown of glory her head arrayed, With rubies rich and rare. \My son!\ she cried, \what holds thee here? Depart! Yon mountain climb. Its craggy base thou shoulclst not fear; Go! scale its peaks sublime.\ My soul then inspiration caught, I bowed at wisdom's shrine, And leaving other joys, I sought The riches of her mine. Glimpses of wisdom, glory, fame, Did my young heart inspire, Kindling within the soul and frame Sparks of immortal fire. Then when with joy on her I gazed - Old Union great and grand- I '11 ne'er forget the hopes it raised, When counted one of her band. * * * * * * * Four years have quickly passed away-- Our college course is run. It will not do for us to stay Where victory has been won. * *

THE CONCORDIENSIS. But let us forth to newer fields, And seek amid the strife Such fame as honest labor yields To crown .a worthy life. PIPE OF PEACE ORATION. BY JAMES . STOLLER. THERE was a time when these regions, now the seat of an effete civilization, were the ho1ne of a noble race of men. They were the children of the primeval forest, and they lived together in a simplicity and freedotn beside which the boasted democracy of tnodern titnes is a n1ockery. These noble n1 en, ever disposed to settle their differences by peaceful arbitra- tion, and not as in these degenerate tin1es by the red hand of war, were accustom.ed to assen1ble together in peace councils, and in token of friendship and affec- tion light the calutnet and srnoke the pipe of peace. . A sitnple and beautiful custom it was-one consonant with the guileless and childlike character of the people with whotn it originated. It is a happy thing that this custon1 at least has been preserved, that in the fragrant futnes of the peace-pipe college students can scatter to the winds their differences as did those worthy n1en of old. And it is to be hoped that this custon1 may not be pennitted to fall into disuse, that the students of American colleges n1a y perpetuate a custon1 distinct- ively Atnerican in origin, and exclusively An1eri- can in observance. But it tnust be confessed there are sotne doubts as to whether this is to be the case. For there seetns to be a growing dispo- sition on the part of college authorities to open college doors to both sexes, and when this titne shall have con1e surely the custon1 we to-day observe will be in danger of falling into disuse. For shall the fair lips of the girl graduate be polluted by the noisome fun1es of a noxious weed? We can readily in1agine how a quar- ter of a century hence the classes of Union College will be rent and torn by the discussion of this ques- tion. But after all, this custon1 is observed far n1ore on account of its picturesque character than because it has any of the significance which those old warriors attached to· it. For it is not generally true that college classtnates entertain for one another other feelings than those of friendliness and good will. To be sure, the class election of the fresh1nan year n1ay occasion so1ne acri1nony and subsequently, now and then, there n1ay be slight and temporary departures from the gen- eral good feeling, but, as a rule, long before the four years have rolled by all these petty differences are forgotten, and a generous, fraternal feeling binds class- mates together in unbroken friendship. And is it not the gladly-given testimony of every college n1an that : nowhere in life are friendships fanned so genuine, so : heartfelt and true as those made in college days? : And that these friendships are pern1anent, that they are cherished amid the absorbing interests of active life-is not this attested by the pleasure with which college men asse1nble together in class-reunion and on alun1ni-day? rrhere is something aln1ost touching in the honest, sincere, ahnost -boyish pleasure with which strong tnen, bearing the burdens and responsibilities of life, con1e back to their alnza tnater and greet the friends of their college days. Certainly the class of '84 has no need, in any literal sense, to observe the ceren1ony of the peace-pipe, for the n1en1bers of this class, now on the eve of separa- tion fron1 one another, have no differences to settle before they go, no anin1osities to be healed. That rock of offence, the class election of the senior year, was the occasion of no ill feeling in the class of '84. For who of us does not re111en1ber, and for whom will it not always be a pleasure to ren1en1ber, that evening last February in A1nsterdan1, when the n1e1nbers of this class resolved as with one voice to lay aside all differences, to cast out all factional spirit, all ungen.- erous rivalry, and to stand together in the bonds of friendship and fraternity? But let us, classtnates, out of respect to this good old custon1, and in order that we n1ay do our part to perpetuate it, sn1oke together to-day the pipe of peace. And as its futnes are dissipated on this woodland air, so n1ay there fade fron1 our 1ninds even the 1nen1ory of every ungenerous feeling we n1ay have entertained for one another. GOD'S POOR. CROvVDED into rooms, small and unhealthy, A couple live, the husband's parents, too, Who, with his children all too well foresee The father's death and, helpless, naught can do. Oh, who may try to tell what they endure, For these are God's own poor. The father helpless through his fell disease, The mother washing wears her life away, Providing scant, coarse food, but winter's breeze Had almost brought despair, when Charity Stretched forth her cold, hard hand. What does man more When dealing with God's poor. vVith some slight help the mother bravely toiled, And kept them all alive till warmer air Helped cheer her. \Mother Mary,\ oft she prayed,

I have done what I could; help, I implore, Help thou God's poor.\ Soon Mary of Seven Sorrows sent down death To bring to her a child, a blighted flower Which had fared hard and quick upon this earth. It closed its eyes, to wake soon in a bower Of the glorious beauty on the eternal shore, The home of all God's poor. With anxious heart the mother nursed her child, With vveary hands and aching head she watched, But vainly; for at dawn a wail- shrill, wild- Told how sore her life was desolated. Her's was the mourning of that deep despair, Well known amoHg God's poor. At length her pent up grief found utterance In broken speech. \Mother of God, is this just? Why must we strive 2nd starve amid-abundance? Through want and cold and sickness still we trust, And learn at last to scorn Almighty power. God pities not the poor. \For Eve's first sin we are all doomed to toil, But must the heart, the 'soul, be wrung for sweat To pay the price of bread? I have borne all, And suffered patiently and long. But yet The Lord will not my babe, my joy, restore; How can he love the poor? \ Anon she calmer grew. \Jesus crucified ! Thy mother mourned Thee dead. Then help my faith In sorrow's storm. Now mother, glorified! Keep thou thy child and mine; yes, keep them both ! \ Worn out, she slept and saw her babe secure In Heaven; no more among God's poor. Be ours that life of humble charity, Which speaks from a great swelling heart of love, And works in helpful deeds its he:utfelt pity, Ever making men better while we live. Of that glad welcome we may well be sure : Ye did it to My poor. 7ohn B. /Iutchison. HISTORY OF THE CLASS OF '84, BY DOW BEEKMAN. THE assertion that \history repeats Itself\ is cer- tain} y untrue in our case, for all the events in the career of the class of '84 are without parallel. We are the only class of r 884 that the world has ever seen. It is true that your historian of to-day tnay be some- what prejudiced, for it is best that a writer's heroes be under the ground; but we owe it to future ages to give a correct chronicle of what has happened within the last four years. When we entered the \ classic shades \ of Old Union, to drink deep of the Pieri an spring, we were sixty-five in nun1ber. We were probably as ga1lant and as green a class as ever entered college,-that is lnoking at it from this distance. We were conscien- tious, studious and steady, and every n1an thought that all life was worth living for was to lead his class; but as we advanced in mathematics, we found that it was contrary to the law of nu1nbers that sixty-five men should all be first. Our fresh1nan life opened with all the vicissitudes of that stonny period. A. salt fight in the sacred pre- cincts of the chapel, table gymnastics, \set ups\ and general indignities followed in rapid and disagreeable succession. The ·first man of '84 to gain distinction for his bravery was Artl~ur Harold Kasi1nir Jervis, our \red plumed'' knight. In all the changing scenes of that tin1e he stands as the central figure. The sopho- lnores had planned, in t~e classical language of the college, to \ put him on the table.\ When the event- ful hour arrived, all the heroic in his nature glowed about his radiant head. The sophs were storming the portals of his palace, but Jervis' motto was \A fresh- man's roon1 is his castle, and death to the sophotnore who attacks it.\ With his venerable derringer in hand, he fortified hirnself behind a pile of trunks, the relics with which he was sent from his paternal abode, and when the sophs endeavored to force an entrance, he deliberately fired three shots with murderous intent, and inflicted 1nortal i11juries upon the door. His noble spirit then relented, or perhaps he became frightened and leaped from his window, and sought refuge for the night in tlie Carley House. The feelings of a freslunan class when they first enter college, have ne\Ver been analyzed. Attempts have been made everywhere and by everybody, from the nursery to the department of zoology. Their confi- dence, their timidity, their knowledge, their ignorance, their n1onumental brass and their dodging shyness constitute a strange 1nixture of human nature. To give the details of all the occurrences, plans, in- cidents and hopes of our freshn1an year would take fron1 the present n1oment to the day when Schenec- tady shall have a new depot,-. a s1nall eternity. Fro1n the beginning!' several 1nen1bers of our class have manifested an extieme fondness for the beautiful, entertaining and co11fiding maidens of this ancient city. In this bare fact there is nothing wonderful, for it shows my classtnates' appreciation of the truly good and lovely. Undoubtedly, by this time, vows of ever- lasting fidelity have been exchanged by n1any. \Ever- lasting,\ to the young lady, signifies \lifelong but to the st - that r with: see1n I fem da1ns city :: recer \ she r Sco6 Ot his fi :first · n1an tion. first occa for c de fir oper refe1 \' .

A close examination has convinced us that the old ,cape was remodelled into that latter- day hat. , net was the next to follow ; he whose strong and stal- , wart frame seemed made never to succumb to the attacks of disease. Farther along in his course, and after we all had become attached to his n1anly quali- ties, Frank Parsons' young life was cut short while yet his ambitions were unfulfilled. His modest mien and During senior year, there have been fewer things worthy of 1nention, for events which were of great 1noment, during the past years of our course, dwindle into insignificance now. This year, however, has wit- nessed 1nany pleasures, among which was our Senate Banquet at Amsterdam. Here, I may retnark that Hall had grown so pious that he referred to that place as \An1stergosh.\ As we were the first class, as fresh- lnen, to have a banquet, so we were the first class whose senior officers have given a banquet, 1naking a total of four like occasions. It may, therefore, be concluded, that as we are a class of good livers, we are a class of wondrous good nature. This is true. , his acts of friendship will be long remetnbered. The last was Vern1ilye, gentleman, friend, scholar, Christian, noble exan1ple. But a tnonth ago we .followed him to his grave and laid hitn beneath the flowers of spring. May the earth rest lightly over them all. In athletics, '84 has distinguished herself. N aylon on the first, and Porcher on the second base, have been the mainstays of the 'Varsity nine, and aided us to win the championship in the inter-class gatnes last year. Philips and Heatly won the medals over all other classes on the race course, although son1e funds were lost, according to a false interpretation of the law of probabilities, at the inter-collegiate games in New York City. We will, however, always point with pride to these men. In all the events, experiences and tales of college life, the outside world never hear of a student's refor- mation-that is rare-or his hours of close study, which so1ne people think still rarer, or his mo1nents of \ gloo1n. The pleasure and glitter alone are seen. It , is tny sad duty to darken the page of our history with j a record of sorrow. Amid all our triumphs, our joys and our delightful tnetnories, let not our dead be for- gotten; we will pay the1n at least the tribute of retnetn- brance. Four of those who entered Union with us have left us and gone to their eternal hotne. When ahnost at the threshold of our course, the kind and genial Harry Miller breathed his last in a lonely dor- mitory room, hundreds of miles from his loving kin- dred, not only our class, but the entire college carried saddened countenances and bursting hearts. As we stood for the last time around the silent coffin of our departed classtnate who would have been our companion for four years, we _felt a startling realization that bright hopes were not proof against the arr-ows of death. While we are upon the eve of graduation, he sleeps beneath the palmettos of his native state. Ben- Within the last four years we have occasionally seen articles in the newspapers which has led us to believe that there has been sotne disagreement, some urtpleas- . antrtess between the President and faculty of this in- stitution. I dislike to chronicle this fact, but as Histo- rian I must \be just and fear not.\ In fact, to be more positive, I think I might be justified in saying that there has been .a fight between the President and faculty, something of the nature of that between the fabled Kilkenny cats. What terrible liberties brash re- porters have . taken with our dear old abna. mater/ The class of '84 have stood alo )f and let the \ heathen rage,\ and as far as I can learn, we are the only party that has come out of the difficulty with honor. The disaffection has served one good purpose ; it has been a source of conversation far better than the weather, and has supplied a first question to every tnan who has 1net with a student fron1 Union College for the '--' past three years. Lest by observations of this kind I should drop a remark that would cause the reassem- bling of the New York Legislature, I will draw the subject to a close. leaving every on~ to think I an1 on his side. Great changes have taken place in the Faculty dur- ing our course. Dr. Dean came, and left us; Mr. Lawrence severed his connection- with the college; Maj. McMurray, called by the despisers of the day of sn1all things, \ Little Mac,\ is, \though lost to sight, still to 1nemory dear.\ Every one lamented the illness which separated Prof. Price fron1 the classes so devoted to hitn as an able instructor and as a generous gentle- man. Prof. Webster filled a large place in the hearts of '84, and the circu1nstance·s which led to his with- drawal fro1n college were sincerely lamented by all. Prof. Alexander, so universally esteemed, was lost to us senior year, when his services were held in the highest appreciation ; within a few days, the resignation of our distinguished President has been received. He leaves many 1nonu1nents of his services to the college. We wish hiln abundant success in his new field of

THE CONCORDIENSIS . . BANQUE'T OF THE CLASS OF '54. Q:N Tuesday evening Men~orial Hall was the. sce~e . · where. I ha.ve dont! my utmost for the institution. I shall always he deeply interested in its weifare. · of a very happy gathenng. It was the tnenn1al reunion of the class of '54· Some had not seen their old cla~smates for 36 years. Many were the.laughable incidents of coll~ge life which were recalled and retold with added zest. Prof. Foster presided and called on his old scholars to tell the story of their lives, and in a humorous way insinuated that they had not forgotten their old tricks in wanting the professor to talk. The following were present and spoke : J. J. Bennett, J no. D. Hall, A. L. Ring, Dr. Benton Burtis, P. Furbeck, Prosper Miller, Dr. E. Nott, D. Westfall, D. Water-· bury, A. A. Gates, C. D. Nott, E. W. Rice, A. Wilson, W. D. Murphy, Woodward. Lette.rs of regre.t were read from the members of the class who were unable · ·to attend, while those present spoke sadly of their de- ceased classmates. It was very late when this pleasant meeting broke up, all feeling that for a few hours they had been college boys again. ClG\SS '64 enjoyed their reunion at the house of the Hon. E. W. Paige on the san1e evening. Class '8 3 sat down to a banquet at the Givens Hotel, fifteen strong, and like old graduates narrated their first experiences in \buffeting the waves of adversity, etc.\ THE COLLEGE PRESIDENCY. AFTER the acceptant;e by the board of trustees of President Potter's resignation, Judge Landon · was elected without a dissenting vote to the presiden- cy ad -interim of Union College. Judge Landon, as re-presenting the views of the majority of the trustees, will address a letter to President Potter acknowledg- ing the remarkable success and labors of his admin- istration. The complimentary resolutions presented by the majority and which their leader stated could justly be made much stronger, were passed unanimous- ly. The following is President Potter's resignation: GRANADA, Spain, May 1, 1884. To the Ii\on. Judson S. Lan.don, LL.D., Chaintta!Z of the Committee on flinance and Educat-ion, and to S. B. Brow- ·J1,ell, Esq., Sec., etc., etc., for the Board of Trustees of Union College: GENTLEMEN-Early in August, 1871, I began my administra- tion as President of Union College. In connection with my inauguration the needs of the college were urgently set before me. Progress in some directions has been prevented by the revival, of college trouble. But in view of what has been achieved, I conclude that I am nuw at liberty to retire from this arduous presidency. Under all the circumstances I have felt it my duty to accept the call received to congenial labors else- Let me place on t·ecord together with this resignation my thanks for the unanirnity with which my efforts were seconded during ten years of this adm,inistration, and for the supp..ort of the majority which I have since enjoyed. I can (D. V.) com- plete what remains hr me to do in this thirteenth year of my presidency, by the fin.t of August next, when this resignation is to take effect. Respectfully yours, EuPHALET NoTI' PoTTER. RESOL'UTIONS OF RESPECT. AT a .special me:eting of N u Chapter of ~eta Theta P~r, held Satltuday, May 31, the following resolu- tions were adopted[ : WHEREAS, Death has entered our circle and removed a loyal and beloved brother, and . 'iVHEREAS, It is fitting that we, whose intimate relations with the deceased enaqled us to know and appreciate his worthy character, should pay tribute to his memory, therefore be it Resolved, That in the death of Andrew P. Vermilye we have lost a friend, endeared to 11-s not only by the ties of our brother- ho?d, hut by his amia,ble disposition, his moral and intellectual worth, and his exemp1lary Christian life, and Resolved, That we sincerely sympathize with the parents and friends of otlr late brother in their bereavement, and Resolved, That we attend the funeral in a body, and that we wear the badge of mourning of our fraternity fur one month and Resolved, That these resolution be published in the city, col- lege and fraternity press, and that a copy be presented to the family.

·I THE CONCORDIENSIS. ( Con#nuedfrom page I 45) 1nusical jingle, who punches fro1n a yellow trip-slip for the spinc.le may be heard :in what was once the col- , a sc. fare, etc? Surely it is I lege buildings, and the cheese-box has beco1ne a : quarry for iron and for fine stone, yea, for variegated marbles and for spotted tHes. The idol alone re1nains unchang.~d, a grim monl!lrn.ent of Union's departed I greatness and faded glory. A short but solid man, wearing a smile of ineffable sweetness, is shown into your room. He presents a slip of pasteboard; upon it is written W. N. P. DAILEY, representing Parsons & Co., publishers. And so Dailey has become a book-agent, not one of those almost intolerable bores, a mere canvasser, but a mis- creant C2Llled a \general agent,\ who goes about from 1 school to school, from college to college, importuning young m:en to prey upon society as book-agents duriJ:?.g the sum\ner vacation. Look again at the card-it reads \ Parsons & Co.'' The Parsons is none other than D. L. PARSONS, knight of the flowing burnsides. The Co. is the old n1an, --ton, father-in-law of the festive Dwight. He married her for her money; she married hiln for that \too perfectly lovely beard.\ BARNEY has joine:d the Quakers, where he 1nay wear his hat at all times in peace. He is as prosperous and as sharp at a trade as ever. How could Barney be otherwise? Upon the bill-boards of the city see a familiar nan1e. \ Positively last appearance of the talented young actor, R. R. BENEDICT, in his grt\at success,\ Macbeth.\ \Dennis who gave great prvmise as a poet and dramatist, has become an actor. He does better now, but the words of Dickens will give' son1e idea of his Teception at the first. \Was there a great sensation? \ '' Why, yes ; there were. certainly a peck of orange peel.\ In th'~ office of the new and elegant hotel, of which the Ancient City is justly proud, behold that scion of nobility, that embodimen.t of all greatness, the hotel clerk. See how he lords it over the porters and bell- boys. ::-Ie gives the man in dudish attire first floor front. He sends the 1nan in granger-like garments to fifth floor back. How well he understands his busi- ness! His nmne is CHAS. COCKROFT. The 1nusical ring of the bell-punch makes us realize the astounding fact that Schenectady has a street rail- way. \Vho is the 1nan· who n1akes the aforesaid .. W. M. JUDD, the \Jerry\ of long ago. 0, Jerry ! that it should come to this. On the streets we see a man of aldermanic dimen- sions, having about him an air of success and quiet contentment. It is ·VANAUKEN, the prosperous architect, the s1nell of wh.ose pipe can be both seen and heard, yea, even by telephone. M'ENCROE is not the Mayor yet, but plays his part as a simple contractor. He is the self-appointed censor of the manners and customs of the day. In the busy, hard-working and successful physician you would never think of finding the MYNDERSE whon1 you used to know, but it is he. Then the Prophet spake, saying: \Tell me, 0, her- n1it, why do so many of these men re1nain in Schenec- tady?\ Then the hermit answered: \Nature is in1- partial in her distribution of gifts. If she makes a man remarkable in any respect, she leaves him defi- cient in some other. Thus one 1nay be strong at poker or billiards, yet most weak in recitation. He may work the boys for all his cigars and yet fail to pay the washer-woman. So these young men, sharp in other respects, have their weak point. It is their fail- ure to leave Schenectady.\ Thus he spake and, turn- ing the pages of the book, he read again : Behold the newly made elder of the Mormon church. Mark his irresistable smile. No man ever ' had a grin like the grin of that man. It is surely HIGSON. The number of his wives· is scandalously large. Won them on his smile. In order to support so large a family, he finds it necessary to exercise to the utmost his tendency for saving money. DELANEY went West immediately after graduating and engaged in stock-raising. He stays West. He is quite suc- cessful at raising stock and has much mamn1on of un- righteousness withal. WELLS, . sometimes called \Raytne\ and sometimes \Billy 1 tills the ancestral acres at Schuylerville. If in dispos- ing of the produce of his grange he makes a poor trade or is swindled by the nefarious middle-men, he consoles himself with the reflection that \it didn't say anything about it in the book\ l 1 ,, i I' ' ij ~ f.: li ' 'l ,,.

i ! 'I THE CONCORDIENSIS. MOORE AND CLARK are editors and proprietors of one of the great tnetro- politan dailies. The politics of that paper are red-hot, straight, out and o.ut Republican, of the old St. Law- rence county type, yet the editors are free from preju- dice, for in a recent issue appeared a leader coln- mending the appointment of the Hon. R. B. M'COWN as minister to England, McCown being one of the leading Democrats. HILL AND HALE_, bankers and brokers of Cleveland. Office hours from I r A. M. to I P. M. Work all done by confidential clerks. Nice easy time. Hill also son1etimes takes a hand in politics and is great on working a ward caucus. KEMP runs a large, elegantly-equipped livery stable. He is a great sport and bets wildly, but luckily, on all the races. \Count\ was ever a great ad1nirer of horse- flesh, and his stable bears witness to his good judg- ment. He likes nothing better than to go on a tear with the boys and, when about two-thirds full, always converses in French. ALLISON man.ufactures knit goods in the city of Oswego. BQsiery a specialty. George is famous as an athlete, ;...~.aving won the six-day chatnpionship over all the Os. Mcs. and Los. of creation. Moreover, the children of the tribe of Bunco watch with eager interest for his occasional visits to the 1netropolis. HUTCHISON, who was studying for the 1ninistry, becatne a tnisston- ary to the South Sea islands. But his Salvation Anny tactics followed hi1n even there; he would flirt with the native girls. On one of his expeditions he sought to travel under the natne of another n1.issionary. This, together with certain other transactions, caused J. B. to become so disliked that his health demanded a speedy return to America. The ten1ptation to use other men's names was still too strong and was the n1.eans of\ Hutch's\ being sent up for a term of years. He tends bar now, a task for which his s1nartness and agility fit hin1 in a remarkable degree. 1 I The highest of high-church clergytnen, drawing a 1 large salary, the pet of all the ladies, yet still untnar- I ried, is WOOLFORD. I He is contributor to the leading reviews, and as a literary critic knows no superior. Th.e man is clad in the flannel shirt and high boots of the engineer. He has a job on a Mexican railway. He is swearing with tremendous vigor at the swarm of unwashed Italians, over whom he rules as with a rod of iron. \Vho is the 1nan of unlimited Italian profan- ity? It is CHISOLI\I, than who1n no tnan has broken more fair Mexican hearts, and for whon1 more than one unsuccessful Mexican rival is earnestly looking. KITTS' well-known ability as a financier led him to becon1e a Wall street operator and, when he had achieved some success in that direction, he was 1nade Sunday-school superintendent. As night follows day, so does a hur- ried excursion to Europe via Canada follow a stock operator's pro11.1otion to S. S. Supt. Kitts may be an exception, but marvel not, 0, young n1an, when you hear of this excursion. All the concentrated sweetness of BISHOP, \S. E.'s,\ nature finds expression in the confecti011ery of which he is a fan1ous manufacturer. His headquarters are in New York, but he has branches in several large 1 cities and at all the sum1ner resorts. LEO has taken the vow of eternal celibacy and become a priest. A more conscientious priest, a n1ore rigid disciplinarian, one who n1ortifies the flesh with its affections with more severity does not exist. BISHOP, J. S. could not make money fast enough as all. engineer, or else he couldn't get a job, or son1ething of that sort. At any rate, he becmne a speculator in live stock-. one of those philanthropists who buys of the fanner his mosk skinny cow and then sells it as first-class beef for three ti1nes its first cost. Clad in the silken robe of his office, the judge chews reflectively the end of his pen. His face wears a look of the 1nost profound and well-nigh superhun1an wisdon1. He is hearing the case of th.e People vs. Jones, the illicit distiller. The counsel for the defend- ant is sutnming up, and as his voice rings loud and clear through the crowded court-roon1 we know that but one 1nan could ever 1nake himself heard like that, and that man is NEAGLE. Beside him at the bar sits his law partner, PORCHER. Porcher & Neagle, ever one and inseparable, are to- gether yet. The firn1 is well- known in the land and

THE CONCORDIENSIS. has an enviable Jeputation for legal acumen and 'SUC- cess. The judge r~ferred to is BEEKMAN. \Beek's\ promotion to the Supreme Court is only a matter of time. :MERRITT is a poet of the transcendental type. His hair is long and flowing, and he looks upon the world through one of those solo eye-glasses. His verses are \quite too perfectly utter ''-quite beyond the comprehension of ordinary tnortals, and for that reason are well received. that the deceased was slain by his :sorrowing friends to get the insurance. The house of Heatly & Co. is one of the largest dry-goods establishn1ents in the world. ]. A. HEATLY is the head of the finn. Here we have the store of TREADWELL MOORE, the great man-n1illiner. The ladies go to the store quite as much to ad1nire \Tweedy's\ shape as to pur- chase 1neans of personal adorn1nent. The Prof. of Gennan in one of the leading colleges lS STOLLER. He began as a preacher, but has found his true calling as a professor. The hennit ceased and was about to close the book, 1 when the Prophet answered and said: \Tell me, 0, hennit, have you nothing to say about The Senator from New York is MACFARLANE. This tin1e \ Mac \ did not resign. Senator is too good a thing to be thrown away. His nan1e will go howl- ing down the ages as the great American apostle of free trade. PRATT has the largest and most popular photographic studio in the city. All great n1en and actresses-espeCially actresses-go to \Zach\ to be photographed. JERVIS was evidently born to be a 1nanager. He is now 1nanager of the largest opera house in . A. H. K. n1arried a widow with five red-headed childred, and in that fatnily they need no candle, neither light of the sun. NAYLON, the ~successful business man, has just been elected to the Asse1nbly, on the Independent ticket, a co1npli- n1ent to Da:n's sturdy integrity and good sense: Life for a young _lawyer is mighty serious business.

FEW thnes in our lives are we more filled with that peculiar feeling, n1ingled with pleasure and dis- \ content, than the circu1nstances of our situation places ' us in to-night. Pleasure for what we have already i done, as well as for the bright promise of the f\lture. ! Discontent in the serious consideration of the new I responsibilities we are about to assume, and in search of the recognized results of ex1)erience and observa- tion, as to the ailns, directions a11d methods of future progTess and endeavor. is connected with a life insurance company, one of those conscientious organiz:ations which always :find ';['he four years we have just passed have been spent in receiving admonition and preparation for the broad field we are now entering. Standing here to-night wrapped in pensive thought, what a wealth of roman- tic scenery is spread out before us! How various the methods of success ! How diversified the callings of n1en t How tempting the prizes to be won in wealth

t e IS- dy of THE CONCORDIENSIS. and honorable distinction, the stimulus to . effort im- parted by each new su~cess ! A career of bright promise opens before us, if 'we but adopt the essen- tial of such a career, which is work. Men illustrious in every calling stand forth as inviting examples for us to follow. The great advancement of all ages have been made by working n1en. The question that particularly interests us to night and presents itself prominently for our consideration is : What shall be our future course and object in life? Each one of us n1ust select so1ue definite object of pursuit and put his best work there, recognizing that he who attempts to n1aster all subjects, though one 1nay become respectable in all, can be accurate and suc- cessful in none. The making of this selection is a n1atter of the greatest importance ; since by its results we are sup- posed to abide for life. Each person is the best judge of his own inclination and capacity, and can best choose for himself the profession or branch of business for which he is best adapted. Every one of us n1ay look upon wealth, and honor, and public use- fulness as his present possession or his probable gain. He is a proprietor, either in possession or expectancy. The field of enterprise and usefulness stretches out in wide expanse before us. Now may it be ·said for us: \The soul of man createth his own destiny and - power.\ No n1an can elevate hin1self above the mul- titude in any profession or calling in life without the labor proportionate to the elevation he seeks. No man can hope for success without his undivided and persistent devotion to the business or profession he has chosen. How can the influence of the exan1ple set by Washington be overesti1nated in giving a tone of unselfish devotion and integrity to our respec- tive callings ? Even then, standing on the threshold of a great future, his patriotic eye discerned the essentials upon which his country n1ust rely for its future safety and progress. His councils, wise and true then, are equally so and as valuable to-night; and it is well for us, in considering the safety and well being of our future course, to re1ne1uber from what 1naterials its strength was derived, and to what principles it owes its pern1anence and must depend for its future safety. Success, in this nineteenth century, glowing with knowledge, the f!2wers of hope and happiness spring- ing up on all sides, and the rich fruits of science and religion filling the garners of our land are sure to co1ue to the man of detern1ined purpose and perseverence. Horace well described the tnan of firn1 -purpose when he said: \The man of firm and noble soul, No factious clamours can cantrol; No threatening tyrant's darkling brow Can swerve him from his just intent; Gales the warring waves which plough, By Auster on the billows spent, To curb the Adriatic Main, vVould awe his fixed, determined mind in vain.\ Excess in every form, inordinate selfishness, factious and unnatural desires, in fine, all unscrupulous specu- lation should be sacrificed upon the altar of benevo- lence. Let us have a strong regard for independence and discountenance public opinion, which too often rewards the undeserving. Let us place ourselves in hannony with the conscjence and spirit of this enlight- ened age. Let us put our trust in the favor of cour- age and of truth, for courage and truth united consti- tute a mighty force. Let us spurn the idea of 1uachinery in public life, of political jobbery and the advancement of unscrupulous issues: All such systen1s ought to be hateful in the sight of every self-respect- ing and independent An1erican. Let us denounce all misconduct, for it is only by such a course the evils complained of are likely to be corrected and public life ilnproved. On the other hand, let us give cordial recognition to good conduct, which helps to good gov- ernment, and certainly will not weaken our hold on public confidence. Let us feel deeply how n1uch of what we are and what we possess, we owe to our A!JJta Mater. She has indeed given us a soil which yields ! bounteously to the hand of industry. She has given I ' to the world scholars, the achieve1nents of w hon1 we, ! · to-night, delight to recall as en1inent examples for our consideration. We can never pay the debt which is upon us ; but by diligence, by perseverence, by the cultivation of every good principle and every good habit. Sad 1nemories cluster about this parting clay. We, the me1nbers of the class of '84, are now to sever our connection as a class. No lo11ger will we be blest with the wise council, the kind words of encouragement, the well-tin1ed warning, and the efficient help in diffi- culty of those esteetned professors, under whose guid- ing eye we have spent the last four years. Our daily 1neetings in class-room will be no In ore. Now we may look for the last tilne, perhaps, upon the fan1iliar faces of our class1nates with whon1 we have spent the happiest days of our lives ; yet the many pleasant as- sociations we have had will never be forgotten; and wherever our lot n1ay lead us, there will ever be in1- pressed upon our men1ory, the recollection of those happy days, a kind regard for each other, and an

Delaney, of i Albany, was ddivered at the com1nencement, on Wednesday, and was accorded the first Blatchford prize of a gold medal : After a busy life, long in years, nearly fifty of which were devoted to the cause and progress of humanity against oppression, ~not only here in his own country, but wherever it existed, Wendell Phillips is at rest. Since his death preachers have spoken his praise, great ora- tors have honored h.is narne, the press has testified to his services for 1nan. I stand here to-day to call attention once 11lOre to this hero, Wendell Phillips; to point out the example of purity of purpose, of absolute unselfishness, which. his life affords to every citizen of this republic, especially to the young men on whon1 the government of this country will soon devolve, on whom depends its future progress and development. It behooves us especially in these times of self-seeking, of inordinate selfish atnbitions, both in business and in politics, to look upon the career of a great man who was self sacrificing, a1nbitious only to do good, who gave up all thoughts of honors or fame th.at he might devote hitnself entirely to the cause of the lowly and unfortunate. It is well that a man like Wendell Phillips should be spoken of often, that the lesson of his life may reach us all. It was a chance incident that made Wenden Phil- lips the Apostle of Emancipation. He happened one day, now nearly fifty years ago, to witness in the streets of liberty-loving Boston a scene common enough in nearly every city of the North during the great slavery agitation. There had been an abolitionist 1neeting, and. a howling n1ob had attacked it, insulting the noble wo1nen, beating the :brave 1nen who have cotne to- . gether to voice their conden1nation of slavery, to agitate its suppression. Wendell Phillips was at that · time a young lawyer of the greatest promise and with a young 1awyeT's ambition. But that riot c.onverted hi 111 to the cause of t11e slave. He saw why the North supported slavery. The North was bribed. The manufacturer and the merchant were bribed. Mer- cenary 1notives directed public opinion and stilled all agitation that n1ight disturb the trade which the North carried on with th.e South. Here then was a crying need for a censor of public opinion, and Wendell Phillips answered the demand. He put away all pro1nising prospects of wealth, of fatne, of political position, and took his stand with Garrison, braving · public opinion, courting social banish1nent. Hence- forth he was an Abolitionist, and to that cause he de- voted his great energies, his rousing eloquence, his fierce invective, and soon, in spite of his youth, his wonderful talents made him a leader in the agitation. The success that attended his labors was n.1arvelous. A great orator, with a noble cause, whose eloquence enchanted all who heard him, the truth and justice of the claims he urged could not but be soon acknowl- edged. History tells how public opinion under the influence of men like Phillips underwent a change; how, after a terrible struggle, perished that institution which shackled the limbs of the slave, the souls of the 1nasters, the Northern Brain. How tnuch of the great result was due to Wendell Phillips no man can say. It is idle to speculate on such a subject. Enough to state that Phillips espoused the cause and toiled for it when to be an abolitionist was to be considered a social outcast, a public enemy, a traitor to the Consti- tution, and that he lived to see Lincoln proclain1 Emancipation and the proclamation carried out. Thank God! this world has seen many noble men who have spoken and fought for the right. But most patriots have fought their own battles, encouraged in their struggle by the support of their countrytnen. John Py1n opposed the Stuarts, knowing that he voiced the feelings of progressive England. Daniel O'Con- nell spoke for Ireland, and Ireland worshipped hi1n and Irish public opinion was with hin1. Washington fought for Atnerica, and Atnerica was behind him. All these men were great patriots, and their nan1es to-day are loved and respected. Now surely Wen dell Phillips was a hero, for he fought the battles of others, he spoke in behalf of a race with which he had nothing in common save humanity, and he carried on the struggle antagonized, not supported, by public opinion. When the slave was freed, Wendell Phillips was in the prin1e of life, and his great work was done. But he did not, as did 1nany a brave 1nan who was his companion in the agitation, turn ·his attention to busi- ness or to politics now that the war was over. No; he still continued to speak in behalf of the wronged and oppressed, the victims of unjust syste1ns and un- equal laws, whoever and wherever they might be. His ·clients were the serfs of Russia, the peasants of Ireland,. tortured by centuries of 1nisrule. Till his death their cause he pleaded, and the progress which of late Russia and Irel~nd have seen was brought about only by indignant and aggressive refonners like hin1.

. 1ng ce- his his on. of the ge; the It to it a out. in on- hiin him. the 111 But s his busi- No; un- t be. of his ought like THE CONCORDIENSIS. • 1.15 We do not hold to view Wendell Phillips as perfect. He had faults, but they were the faults of a brave, . generous nature. He was, perhaps, violent in his advocacy of a cause which he had once espoused. · He demanded peaceful disunion before the war, that the North might be separat~d from the slave States. Yet it was the Union that freed the slave. Few of us will agree with his views on Finance or Woman Suf- frage. Yes, he was son1etilnes in the wrong. But he was always sincere in his opinion. His judgment n1ight err, but it ·was profoundly honest. His moral integrity remains unsoiled ; his :purpose pure ; his life was devoted with absolute unselfishness and with an1azing results to the service of the country and of hun1anity. Now that the prejudices of the contest are over and the past is seen in the light of reason, of calm reflection, the South as well as the North acknowledges the worth, the nobility of Wen dell Phil- lips, and the whole country to-day thanks God that this 1nan lived and spoke. To us, young n1en, the exa1nple of Wendell Pnillips has peculiar force. It adrnonishes. us not to live for ourselves alone, but for others, for the general good of the country. This is the need of the hour, that young men should, like Philips, look at great national questions of n1orality or politics unhan1pered by local or party prejudice, and act in the courage of their opinions, though it be at the sacrific of popularity, at the risk of public indignation. 'T is true the issues of to-day are not so mo1nentous as those which met Wendell Phillips half a century ago; yet there are always important questions to be considered; the cause of n1an which possessed such sublimity but a generation ago, possesses still the same physical and spiritual worth. The world to-day needs, as n1uch as it has ever needed, 1nen of plain living and high think- ing, 111en who have the power to discern the right amid all the wrappings of interest and all the seduc- tions of ambitions. We cannot all be Wendell Phil- lipses ; his great powers are given to but very few; great crises such as that in which he was placed come seldon1. Yet we can honor hi1n, and strive to be like him in devotion to duty, in love of justice, by n1aking one of the objects of our life the advancement of the principle of equality, the welfare of the country and of humanity. ~ FORMER MEMBERS OF THE CLASS.
