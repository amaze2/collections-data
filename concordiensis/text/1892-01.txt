Th~ 8tock used in the manufacture of this Cigar is tht most e;cpensive of any jive-cent Uiga1· lver put on the ma1'- ket. It is really a ten..,cent Oigi:tr for ji·ve cent.q. Oomp~­ tition drove us to it. A most excelhmt and agreeab-le tonic and appetizer. It nourishes and invigorates the tired brain and body imparts renewed energy and vitality, and enlivens the functions. DR. EPHRAIM BATEMAN, Cedarville, N.J., says: \I have used it for several years, not only. in nty practice, but in my own individual case, and consider it under all circumstances one of the best nerve tonics that we possess. For mental exhaustion or overwork it gives renewed strength and vigor to the entire , system. Descriptive pamphlet free. Rumford Chemical Works, Provid:ence-,; R~ I.
