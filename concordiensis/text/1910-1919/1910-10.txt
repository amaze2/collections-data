Prospects Unusua';ly B:right-:-Team Well Support- ed Supported by Students.· Foot!~all .prospects are the brightest thnt Union h3.S ever seen. With scarcely half the -men= 4>ark from :a-st year's team, Coacn :..Regnier and Captain MANAGER BAKE'R Brown, working together with the rnen whD re- t.P rned early, have turned out a teat~ ~h.at _will show tbe true Union spirit and that has a capaci- ty for \Winning .gan1es.- The--fi-rs-t- gan1e of the sea- son · ta;kes place to-morrow at Willia;n.stown . against the fast WilJiams. a,ggregri.tio:ri. Jndgin 9,· from the 8howing p1ade in the ear1y ~criln-1na-ges -. CAPTAIN BROWN and f1~om the way the 1nen have bc~e.n working in practic€, the Garnet eleven will give the Massa· chusetts t€am a hard game. ~ ·With· -the -team on the trip to-morTow, will go nearly two hundred earnest students, fiLed wtth the intention of yel'ling the Willja:113 men I:tenll- 1-y- off their feet. With sucll a lJacking the team ,,rur undoufJtedly make a showing that will be a srrprise for their opponents. Manager Baker has made arrangements for the trip and haB secured COACH REGlN[E·R the tickets at almost one way fare for the round trip. So far the work of the tean1 :1as been very gratifying to the coa_ch and to Captain Brown. Two ends. have appeared, both of 'Varsity ma- terial, the backfield, for which so many fears were fe It has proven to be much stronger than last

6 THE CONCORDIENS18 year.. With ·O'Connell, Brown, Dewey, Reilley, Sarvey and Micks in their places, there is little doubt of lJnion's ability to make .gains. On the line the a,bsenee of Brown ha3 not been felt near- ly as much as w::ts {eared. Sellnow, O'Connell, lVIann, Davis, Griffin, Atkin and Vedder are at their old places. Taken all in all,. the team at the present time seems to possess more strength than at any time last year. During the past week Coach Regnier has been .in~tructing the team jn a ~kries of f8-ke plays and pas5es that seem likely to be goon gro 1 1nd gain- ers. In addition to theae, straight plays, onside kicks and forward passes have been added to the curriculum. Notwithstanding that it Js the first game of the season, there t~. every indica.tiou that the team will win SaturiJay. Already the en- thusiastic stndes have awamped lVIiddlel)ury and H.obart, won from Stevens and Wesleyan an<1 ·buried Ham.Hton and Rochester under a load of tcnchdowns. Accidents have already weaken~d th~ team. \Ducky'' Webb one of the ·candidates f..or qu3r- terba,ck had his shoulder injured, but luckily there ar·3 other g{)nd quarters. Reilley has a baJ. shoul- der, which, 'however, will not interfere with hiS playing. O'Connell is in practically the same con- dition. Dewey is threatened with a \charley horse.\ Morgan, one of the ends, is also lame with a muscle bruise. The Line-Up. The line-up, which was given out to-day by Captain Brown will be essentially as foliow~. There is· a possibility that Coach Regnier will keep Brown himself out of the game owing to a bad shoulder: Center, Vedder, Atkin; guards, Sellnow, Josolos. ki, Griffin, Davis; tackles, O'Connell, Trapp; quarterback, McDermott, RileY: t'UilbacR, ··nan\ O'Connell (law), Congdon; right halfback, Cap- tain Brown, Reilly (law), left halfback, Sarvey, Dewey; ends, Morgan, La rk1ns. ATHETIC BOARD. - -. Assistant Baseball and Football Managers Elected. The re!gular fall meeting of the Athletic B0ard was held on Wednesday evening. At this meet- ing much i~portant b-usiness was transacted and several matters of interest to coi~ege athletics dis~ cussed. Kenneth E. Walser of .Cohoes was elected as· sistant manager of the 'varsity baseball team. The Ir.atter of hiring a coach f()r the baseball nine was -diacussed but no definite action will be ' . taken until later in the season. Baker, 2nanager ·of tne football team announced the resignation of Chatfield Bates, the assistant m.anager. Bates is intending to go to the medi- cal department next year and it was tlHn:lght that a student in one of the Albany departments would hardly be able to atteRd to the managing of the team. Wi~liam A. Rice of Parksville was elected to fill the vacancy. V\ 11 .thd raw From N .. Y. S. I. A. U. Saturday. This week Saturday Union College officially withdraws from the New York State Intercollegi- ate Athletic Union. 'The athletic board decided lc . .st winter that it would be for the best interests of the college to withdraw from the league, but according to the rules of the associati{)n it was impossible to do so unti:l the fal. meeting. Morland KiiJg', the ·president of· the athletic council will represent Union at the mee~ing of tl•e state league and hand in ·Ol.lr resignation. if pus- sible, Union will still participate in the N. ·y. ~.

The Concordiensis thinks that it may not 'be amiss at the beginning of the year to call attention to the growing importance of the Sund·ay Vespers of the Christian Association. If any men have been accustomed to look upon these meetings as a trivial occurren. ce, they will be surprised to know th~ t men of djstinguished ability and no small reputation are already scheduled for this ran. Pead on another page the announcement of a. few of these sveakers. The opportunity of hear- iJ1g such men :means an op•r;ortunity for a broad- ened viewpoint and a .deeper culture; and that is what we are all at cnllege for. The Christian Asso·ciation is to be congratulated for its good work in this direction. If for no othe,.. reason, these meetings at whicl1 1nen of prominence visit our college, often for the first time, ought to be supported by the student body merely as a matter of college spirit.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 9 for your own existence as a :nember of the col- lege ·community, yet every student, un1es·s rely~ ing wholly on his own resources to defray his col- lege expenses, shoul(l feel it his duty to take an ac-tive interest in some one of the various college activities. It does not matter whether you have hD.d any previous ex~p~rience or ~ hility of any kind. That is one of the .aJvant·ages of a col- lege of Union's size. You have a chance to en· gv.ge in some activity suited to your taste and deYelop ability. The training which is receivet\ outside of the curriculum work wi:I \be found very valuable in after life, and will contribute in no small degree to the pleasure of your college life. UNION ENGINEE.RS RECEIVE HIGH HONORS IN CIVIL SERVICE. Louis R. Bennett, a member of the pre·s- ent junior class of the general engineering depart- ment has been notified -by tbe New York State Civil Service .Commission. that in the recent ex- aJnination ·for rodman on barge cana.l work, he p<:tssed the exa1nination with the highest grade of any one iD:. the state and therefore ranks n.umber one on the list, which comprises about 250 candi- dates, of whom about one-l1alf passed the exam· ination. All of the Union College engineers 'vho COLLEGE OPENING. Union CoUege began its hundred and fifteenth ccLegiate year September 22, when more than three hundred students reported for the first reci- tation~ ,of the year. On Septembe!' 19 the fresh· 1nen registered and on the following three days took place the entrance examinations. The tnree upper elasses registered on the 21st and the first chapel exercises were held the following· day. Idol worship was the nightly progTam during the forepart of the week, which nearly the en- Ure body of upper classmen and many citizens of Schenectady, including a large proportion of the fair sex attended. On Friday afternoon took place the annual cane ruBh which was won by the sophomore class by the score of 11 to 5. The rP sh was witnessed by fully a thousand specta- t0rs,, who lined the terrace from North College to the Blue Gate. In the evening the first annual reception of the senior class to the freshmen w~s held at Silliman Hall. The regula-r annHal event of this killd will be held to-ni?;ht when the entire student body and faculty will be present at the h2ll to welcome the new men. The senior class begins the year with fifty-two members and the junior class num·oers seventy- t0ok that examination, six in number, passed and five. There are seventy-three in the sophomore were graded within the upper twenty-nine on the · class and the entering ·class ha.s a hundred and list, one being number six, with Mr. Bennett num- b~r one. Bennett has been en!gaged on the barge canal work since his appointment but intends to rPturn to complete his engineering course this year provided he- can secure a ~eave of absence from the state on October 15th, up to whicll ti:ne the faculty has granted him a leave of absence from college work. Another Union College ·man, B. lVl.. b'tarlc, who graduated in the general engineering cour~e in June of this year, has just been notified. by the U. S. Civil Service Comtnission that he has passed the' recent examination for junior assist- ant engineer on the U. S. Reclamation Service with a general average of 91.25 per cent., and stands at the head of the list for the entire United States. Mr. Stark has, since graduation in June, been engaged with the New York State Water Snpply Commission, ·but will d-oubtless soon leave for . a position on the U. S. Reclamation Service on irrigation in the West. nine. Since these figures were obtained from the c-olle.ge office there have been several additions to the entering class and also the total n1.1mber of t:tudents will be increased by several old students who will enter late. l\1any improvements to the campus are to be seen at the opening of this year. The iron fence 011 the Union .Street side of the mnnpus is coln- plete and the new roads and paths have been latd out and gravel:ed. A substant1~1 wire fence now enclo-ses the college pasture and all thor- oughfare through here stop.ped. The poruon Af South ·College that was damaged by fire last win- ter has been repaired and Professor Ha.le Is now occupying his a-partments. A new dormt tory has teen opened in north colonade where the se-v- eral recitation rooms on the second floor have been torn o·ut and in their place eleve.fl r.ooms have been. finished for the use of students. The new Beta Theta .Pi fraternity house is nearing completion r..nd other ·changes iu the :appearance ·Of the grounds are still going on.

The s·cope of The Optic will be unusually wide but further than this it d-oes not seem advisable to disclose at the pres- ent time; for it is doubtless the place of the editor to explain the details of the paper. It mtght be wel1, however, to say a word con- cerning Editor Site in order that his {lebut at Union may in no waY offenfi him. Mr. Site claims descent from the Spectator, the well lin own writer of the seventeenth century. At aU events his tPmpera:ment is much the same as that interest- in~ genCeman. Editor Site is a m.an of fe'v words, in fa-ct, as I. Site, the journalist, he is a mute. His manner of gathering news is by observation only, anJ his hobby is ob·s,curity.

Union, .aHhough ·defeated by Williams 29 to U in the first game of the season, put up a game that was much better than the s·core indicates. In the first and fourth periods, the Garnet eleven was fully the egua'l of the wearers of the purp1e an:j pusted them hard. The first ·score of the ~.~arne came early in the sec·ond period and -w·as the result of a forward pass· from the 15-yard line. Stevens scored another a few minutes later 011 a 75-yard run.· Three xnore wen~ 1nade h1 t11e third ·period and the1~ the scoring stopped. Union bra·ced up and drove their opponents back down the field. Every ·man on the Union team played a good game and the coaeh and the captain were well pleased with the showing made. \BH I'' Murray's Opinion. \Bill\ Murray, one of Union's former .coQaches, ,.. was on the field and expres·sed his surprise at: Union's showing. H€ stated that Union would win from \both their old enemies, Hamilton and Rochester. Union's season, indeed, promises to be a succesBful one. lVIost of Williams's. gaJns· were ma:de on a shor~ forward pa:ss over the center of the line. Union's secondary defense seemed unable to solve .. thiS play and it was worked time and again. Neitl1er team was able t'O gain rnuc.h through the line, the Garnet men holding es.pecially well. On the Williams team, Peterson, Stevens and Winter did the m-ost consistent work. The style of playing of the two teams was very different.

I; I ~ ' ' ' \ ;. \ ,: I' 6 THE CO:NCORD1ENSIS Coach Regnier and many new plays have \been developed. The :short forward pass that won so many yards for the Williams -eleYen last Sat- urday has been adopted and wiU doubtless prove I a ground gainer f.or the H.arn.et team to-day. Much work in strengthening the defense has been done and the team win play an altogether different game from those played on theh ,earn· pus heretofore. Many Changes in Line-up. There will be many ,changes in the line-up in to-·day's game, when three of the regular pl:tyers will be out of the game and substitutions will be made. ''Dan\ O'Connell and his · brotter, . \Scipio have given u.p football for the season. Larkin also will be unable to play. Doran Brown will ·probably be in the game if n.eedefi and Torn·my Fairbairn will doubtless direc:~ the plays in hi's old position at quarterback. in thiS case McDermott will be a good end and substi- tute quarter. Vedder is recovering from an at· ' - ta-ck of tonsilitis and may no·~ be in the .gan1e Saturday. Atldn will be used if such is tl1e case. Word from Middlebury. The following communication was received from the manager of tJ:le Middlebury eleven: \The team is rather light, but we hope to make this up in speed, and. if. our coach can whip them into shape we ought to give Union a ,good game.\ The only game which Middlebury has ]>layed Coll·ege o:.. Their line this season was with St. Miehael's Burlington~ Vt. The score was 0-0. up will probably be as follows: E:nds, Barnes and Smith; tackles, Bump anJ Fisher; guards, Downing or Hedges and W·ood- ward; center, M,cGonnell; half-ha·cks, Leonard and King; quai£erba·ck, Conovan; fullback, Pa}mer. --·---- FOOTBALL GAMES TO-DAY.

THE Rii 1 GHT SPIRIT A.T The students who THE FOOTBALL GAMES. attended the opening game at Williamstown certainly showed that they knew how to exhibit the true kind of co!lege spir1t at the football games. The team was well suppurted by every fellow ·present. and the ten- dency to cheer at the penalties and mistakes of our opponents was entirely lacking. Let us continue to show that same sort of true college spirit throughout the sea·son. In the game with Middlebury last year there was a decided tendency t(}wards muckerism -on the part of the Garnet supporters, and the Vermont players were made the objects of unsportsmanlike yells and cheers more than once. Football as it is playect now should be a game for gentlemen. The Union players are doing their be-st to play a good clean game, and the students who are supporting them from the side- lines shoul·d manifest the same spirit. Follow your cheer leaders. Cheer at the good plays ot the Garnet team, ·Cheer for a plucky opponent who has ·been injured while playing his best, a1iu let there be an absence of jeers and taunts at the opposing team. > ',,· ' . ·\~ ' ... , t I\ I l I ~ . .

Oooper ()f ::~·ew York City will be .a visitor on the ''Hill'' to·m·Orrow and will be the speaker at the Sunday ves:p.er service of Ule Christian Association. Mr. Cooper is widely known 'in the c·OHeges of the Uni:ted State·s and Canada, heing engaged in the work of promoting Bible Study .among .college me11. In. cenne·ction with his work as International Student Bible :Study Secretary, Mr. Cooper n1ade a six months' t()ur of the woriJ.d, returning to this country :a. little over a year ago. During this tour nearly all the great student centres .of Europe and the Orient were visited, parli-cularly those of Ceylon, India, North and South China, Japan and Korea, nearly a ID()nth being ·spent fn each country. Mr. Cooper was thus enabled to get at first hand a thorough knuwledge of men and affairs in the Far Eiast, a part of the world that is coming m·ore and moQre to be a fa·ctor 1n internaaonal politics. Since returning, Mr. Gooper has written an account of his ex·perien.ces and observations 1n a seri€~ of noteworthy articles on the \Co1lege· Man and the Bible.\ 'rhese arU.cles have ap- peared in the \Century past summer. Magazine\ during the CL~.A:Y 1 T 1 0N S. COOPER. Cooper as a College Man. Mr~ Cooper is in every way qualified to spea1c as a college man to ·co:l~ege men, having been graJ.uated from Br-own University with the class of '94. WhHe in college he was president of his class during the senior year, a fact whlch gave him a commanding influence among the unde1·~ graduates. After (~raduation Mr. Cooper attended Rochester Theological Seminary, graduating wit:h. the class -of '98, later taking a Ph. D. ~t Columbia University. After student days, he entered College Y. M. C. A. work and by his high i-deals, personal 1nag· netism, and ability as a scholar, won his way to his present im.portant position. The subject .of the address Sunday will be \The College Man and the Bible.\ The meeting wiH be held at the usual hol!lr, 5 p. m,, in the garden if pleasant, otherwise in Silliman Hall. THE NE'W \GYM/' The new \gym\ fund, which started in (lle sprin3 of 1909 has advanced rapidly ·since that lime. gach class is ex-pee ~ed to give toward. thls fund and in following out this idea, plans are under ·way to collect the subscriptions from the sophom<Jre and freshman classes some time thlS term. Meade, '09, and Potter, '09, concluded thew canvass of the alumni ,of New York State early thi'S spring. The committee now expects to do son1e of tts w-ork through the Graduate Council. To fill tne vacancy of Otto Faust, resigned, ·Tristran1 Coftin was elected to the n1embership of the cornmitt~B. There are now four undergraduates working on the \gym\ fund. They are Coffin, H. Baker, Schermerhorn and Wehb. The members of the .committee have been working hard anct as a r€sult a little over $30,00U has been pledged. This is certainly a good showing for one year's work and the prospects are bright of starting th€ new gymnasium withu1 two years.

JO THE CONCORDIENSIS ~lumni jlr\us. WHO WLL READ THES'E NOTES? Fifty-six of the alumni have, at ].)resent, suo- scribed to the Concordi. No doubt you will agree that it is a small number. T·here are many reasons why this is the .case and some of them may remain so for some time to come. If any change for the better is to come, it will be dae to alumni action. I • I have received several letters, in answer to the cir·cular sent out by the Graduate qouncil, in which the writers regret their lack of money with which to help \Old Union.\ Large gifts of money are not the only way, nor the best way to help the ·college. Your own active interest in what she is doing is worth much more. Interest in Union will .prompt· the most humbre to acts of servi.ce of the greatest value. To keep up your interest you must read ·coi- lege news. At present the Concordiensis offers the best to be had. You may find the paper ·poor in many reS'pects but write us and we will try to improve it. Remember it is partly yours. Send information about class1nates and even articles that you think will interest the alumnl. Take a hand in this little matter. In closing I pa'Ss to the slang oQf the campus.

Red.eeming he-rself for the defeq,t at Williams a'ld playing real football, the Garnet team de- feated the Middlebury aggregation iH the first home game of the season, the score being 17-5. Union earned every one of ber three touchdowns, while t11e one credited to the visitors waB gained on a fumb 1 e. King inter·CelJted a forward pass [ .. Pd ran eighty yards for a. touchdown. McDer- mott at quarterback ran the team well an<l crowded the visitors every minute. Middlebury made but three first downB, whi: e Dewey and Sarvey ably ai-ded by the quarter and the full, r~pped off ten yards at a clip. Unfortunate fum- bles also reduced the possible se·ore of the Gar- net team although Union made no attempt to run up a spectacular score, reverting to new plays after securing a good lead. The game opened with the ki-ckoff by Sarve:v. Ca.ssavant ran back fifteen yards. :VIiddlehu:ry v·as unable to gain and punted. FinaBy toward the end of the period, Union with the baL on Middlebury's thirty-yard line tried a forward pass. King intercepted the pass to Morgan and ran town the field for a touchdown. Middlebury failed to kick the go:1l. In the second period Union resorted to line bucking plays and end runs, in an of whic-h, owing to the strength of her line and the sr;eed of her backs, she n1ade snbstan- Hal gains. Fina~ly Dewey wao pushed over for a. touchdown and then kicked the goal, rnaking t~e final score at the end of the first half, 6-5 in favor of Union. Throughout the entire half the Garnet tea1n had demonstrate·d their superiority and had been kept from making two more touch- downs onlv by a scant margin. Several cu_:)Lly fumbles had been made. During the second period, O'Connell took J3:salowski's ,place at gPard. 'The third period op.ened auspicion~ly ant~ within five minutPs, Sarvey had c<:trried th0. ball over for a touchdown. Dewey misReil tbe goal nnd the srore was 11-5. During these five 1ninuto~. i\Iid· dlebury had the ball but once and then, unablB to TIJ ake first do·wns was obliged to p11nL On the kick-off, after Union's second to.uchd.own, S1nitl1, who had takken Cassavant's place ::tt quarterback for Middlebury carried the ball back ten yards. Union, however, got the hall on downs, lo.:;t it and got it again. Then with sca'~\ce:y a. hitch,. they again carried it over for a touchdown. The kicked goal added another point a·nd tbe score was 17-5. Straight football netted all of Union's gains in this period. Shortly after the second touchdown, time was called for the period. ..

'THE CONCORDIENSIS A ·co11.ple of costly fumbles, a mnffed ball and a blocked forward pass prevented the Garnet elevelil from adding more points to its score al- though in tne fourth peri·od Union was ]l:aying rnore for practice than to score. Long runs were again made \by Dewey and Sarvey and a forward pass to Morgan netted fifteen yards. Near the visitor's goal line, King again intercepted a for- ward pass but was stopped beillore he got away. Throughout the entire game Unio·n stuck more closely to tbe old rules and p~ayed straight foot- tall. Mi-ddle bury, unable to gain by line plays, resorted to fake plays and criso-crosses, none of which ~worked. King and Cassavant were the Middlebury stars, the latter especia:ly playing a fine game. For Union, the wltl·ole team wo·rl~ed well. Dewey, Sarvey, Congdon and Tasker, being r:erhaps the 1nost prominent. M·cDennott ran the team very well and was excellent at running bRck punts.

However, t·he Union team is in good condition now, :and should be .able to :put up a much better exnibition of footbaU than th~y gave in either the WilliamH or Middlebury gan:Je. \Paddy\ O'Connor, a student fro;n the .medical depa·rtment, wD.o played a. star game as guard on 1:1~ Cornell te3m two years ago, will be in the g~.me and add a grea.t ·deal of stren:;?;th to the 11ne. Captain Brown's shoulder is now well again, and he wn: be in the game to-day for the first ti·me this year. Morgan is out of the game fo1· tile ~eu­ s.on, due to having his upper .iRW .c~ved jn clnring practice l::'.st week. Brumn1 vvill fill his place at end. It is doubtful whether Goach Hegnier will consider ''Scipio'' O'Connell in suitable <:>onditio·n to go into such a hard game. Hugh Reilly frmn the :arw deJ)artment will, also, be allowed to play. :M·cDer:mott, .sarver·, 1 Dewe'Y, .Sellnow, Branson, ·vedder and Jas.alowski are all in condition to }Jt~t up a good game. Rochester Fast. Rochester's team is unusually fast this fall. s:1e won from George Ju·n.ior Republic, who always pnts out a snappy team, by the score of 19 to 0. Svra·cuse was able to score but one touchdown on Rochester, the score being 6 to 0. It may be seen that the latter team played remarkably well in this game, when rwe c.onsider the fact· that Yale had difficulty in defeating Syracuse by a 12-6 8core. ------- FOOTBALL GAMES TO-DAY.

The civil engineering ·Club was founded last spring for the purpose of promoting en~ineerjng knowledge among its members. H. Baker was elected president; C. Duchs-chere-r, vice-president; Van Patten, .secretary, and D. Brown, treasurer. The club adopted. the name of \The Gillispie Club,\ after an organization o.f similar character and name which existed at Uninn in the seven- ties and eighties. This club was first nan1ed after Prof. Gillispie, who was the founde:r of the engi- neering school at Union in the year 1845. The completion of the new engineeri~g build- ing gives a suitab~e place for the tneetings of t:1e members who are either juniors or seniors in the civil e·ngineering conrse. The :neetings take the form of prepared papers, discussions and lee· tures from members of the facu~ty and pronli- ·nent men outside of the college who are engaged in engineering work.

It is expected that about ninety Phar- lnacy students and two hundred Medical students will be in the parade. Each class will be headed by its president, and each department, by a grand marshal. The students of each departtnent will wear bands of garnet and white about their sleeves, which will all bear the letter \U'' at the top, with the word underneath: \Pharmacy \Law or \Medical to designate the department to which each belongs.

ROCHESTER WINS. BUT UNION TWICE CROSSES HER OP- PONENTS' GOAL LINE. Although Union was defeated by Rochester at that place Saturday by the score of 8-o, the Garnet after the first period showed that they were equal to the Yellow. Union also n1ade two touchdowns but neither could be .counted, while Rochester carried the ball over but once and kicked one goal fron1 placement after a fair catch. Brown, Sarvey and Griffin were the incli- vidual stars for Union, while Brown and Dunn did stellar work for the Ye How teatn. After the first period, the Union team seetned to brace up and especially during the last two periods had the Rochester aggregation .. on the run. At this point Rochester substituted numer- ous men in an ineffectual attetnpt to stop the Union pi ays, hut were t111successful. Both tean1s worked the straight footl)all for the most part, but Union tnade a coup:le ·G>f sucoessihtl attempts at the forward pass, m~eanwhile btocking every try th:at Rochester made. Emd runs were the greatest ground gainers for the Yellow, while Union held to skin--tackle plays and straight bucks. The Garnet line was ab 1e to open a hole almost every time and at the same time kept up a good defense. O'Connor opene~ the game by kicking to Roch- ester, who advanced the ball fifteen yards. By a series of end runs and line bucks they ad- vanced the ball to Union's five yard line, where they lost on a fun1ble. Captain Brown punted to Otis, who heeled the catch on Union's forty-yard line. Brown of Rochester, on a placement kick, scored the first blood by getting the three points for his team. With the way paved by a Union ftunhle, Rochester again advanced the ball to the Garnet goal line and then sent Slocu.tn over for a touchdown. The goal was n1i:ssed. With a score of 8-o against them the Garnet players took a brace and held the Yellow team during the second period and at times even crowded them toward their own goal. Then Brow11 of Union was kicked in the head and was rendered partially unconscious. Sarvey took his place. VVith Rochester hacked up to their thirty-yard line, Sarvey carried the baH over on <~ skin-tackle play. The touchdown was not al- lowed, however, as the runner touched one of the side lines in his dash. Tim_e was called with Union on the verge of a touchdown. In the second half, Union again asserted her superiority and threatened the Rochester goal time and again. At the beginning of the third perio(l, Brown catne back in to the game, while Sarvey took H. Reilley's place ,at rig-ht halfback. With this line-up, -union continued to plow up Rochester defence and in the last tninute of play Captain Brown carried the ball over for a touch- clown. This too, could not be allowed, the ref- eree holding that Brown slid the ball over the goal line after he was down. The Tine-up of the teams was as follows: UNION (o). ROCHESTER (8).

Cornell and Rochest·er Both Wish Debates. .An unustnl degree of interest is being shown in debating \vork this y(ar, and it is probable that Vnion's debating relations will be consider- ably extended. Cor11dl and Rochester have taken the initiative in attempts to arrange con- tests with our debaters. Heretofore Cornell has restricted her debating relations to the tri-league with Col utnbia and Pennsylvania:. She now feels, however, that she has been following a short-sighted policy and this year -vviH take on debates with other colleges in the State. During the past few years Union has earned .a high reputation for debating ability, and the Cornell orators feel that a contest with u.s would be an interesting one. The debate is not yet definitely settled, but if arranged, it will be held at Union early in the winter term. Rochester, a~so, wishes a debate this year. The Debating Co~uncil, while not as anxious to de- bate Rochester as Cornell, will probably agree to t~e contest if a suitable date can be arranged early in the spring term, and other arrangements can be made satisfactorily. There is, also, a pos- sibility of debating the Albany Law School in the latter part of the fall term. If these debates should be arranged, Union's de bating schedule will be the largest in her his- tory. The annual triangular debate will be held this winter on the last Friday in February under practically the same conditions as last year. The question will be decided upon before the close of the fall term. The annual Allison-Foote de- bate between the Adelphic and Philomathean societies wil:l be held on January 13. Regular weekly meetings are now being held by the two societies in preparation for that event. NEW BOOK :BY DR. HALE. \The Life of Seward,\ a new book by Dr. E. E. Hale, is now listed in the college library. This book is .a biographical sketch of William H. Seward, one of Union's greatest alutnni. Dr. Hale has referred extensively to original sources, and has spent two years in writing the book. A review of it will appear in a later issue of this paper.

In the last issue of the Ca,mpus, the official pub- lication of the students of Rochester University, there appeared an account of last Saturday's game between Union and Rochester. The article ts so unfair to Union a11.d its whole tone is so uncomplimentary to o11r :teatn that the editor can- not refrain from spea!lting of the affair in these editorial colun1ns. In criticising the Caa.l'pus., the Concvrdiensis wants its readers to rea'l:ize that it is not itself assunung in fallibility in m.a tters of journalism, for no one appreciates 1nore keenly than the editor the fact trat the C oncordiensis is not yet a model college publication. But whatever crit- icistn tnay be made of fhe Concordy, this much, at least, n1ay be said to its credit-the Concordy acc'Jrds fair and cr.aritable treatn1ent to all rival colleges. The Union svirit is one of fair play and a square deal at a11 ti1nes. The Rochester publication does not give the Garnet team credit for playing even a creditable game or making even a decent showing- against the Yellow, whereas the game was really a very close and hard fought one during every n1inute of play exce}:'>t, perhaps, in the first period. No n1ention whatever is n1:acle of the brilliant run and touchdown made h:y Sarvey, or of the one made by Captain Brown, neither of which, how- ever, could be allowe<L A quotation from ibe closing paragraph is illustrative of the ten{)r of the entire article: ''The game was delayed by constant argutnents between ·union men ancl the officials. What they

UNION COLLEGE UBRAR~~ THE CONCORDIENSIS lacked 111 football ability, they n1ore than made up in forensics.\ Whether these two statements are true or not, a proper regard for college spir1t should accord a rival te<ilm fair play rather than treat them in a sarcastic and \n1ud-slinging'' fashion. Whether we win or lose, let us never fail to stand for the well-known Union spirit-a spirit of fairness and justice even to keenest rivals. We are deeply anxious for athletic victories; we are more concerned for the good natrte of our NEWS FROM SILLlMAN HALL. At a n1eetirrg of the Advisory Committee of the Christian Association held Wednesday aft- ernoon, ''Chuck\ Waldron, \06 1 secretary of the Graduate Council, was uaa nim.ously made a mem her .of the committee. 'Jhe Advisory Board, as now constituted, is one d1at cannot fail to cotnrnand the confidence and esteem of the en- tire student body.

H. Potter, '12. has been held at Union in recent years. The ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ class of 1914 has taken up the idea with en- thusiasm, and with the aid of a committee ap- pointed from the Terrace Council and the junior class have planned an affair w·hich promises to be as successful as that of any parade given by the entering class of any of the larger colleges. For n1any years it has been the custo:;:n at Williams, Colttn1bia, and n1any other colleges for the freshtnen to hold a parade early in the fall at one of the n1ost important ho:11e f ootha;l gatnes, but the Union parade will be son1ef:ling un:que for both the students and t:-:e people of Schenectady. Many favorable cotnn1ents on t~1e idea have already been heard from the friend:; of the college tb.rougf:out t~-:.e city, and if all· of the plans for making the parade successful 1nature, the freshmen wiH bring the college to the not~ce of the townspeople in a new and Hnique way, and will deepen the interest which f ey rave already shown during the past few years. The parade will also show our visitors frotn the Albany department that the Union spirit is as alive as ever. It is understood that the Al- bany students themselves have planned a parade for the occasion, and it w-ould have looked ex- . ceedingly bad for· the college students to be outdone by their visitors. It is planned to have the freshmen parade an annual occurrence on University Day, and this should becotne an affair around which. a great deal of interest will he centered. The Concordiensis is glad that this institution w·hich has become so popular at rnany other active colleges is to beco1ne a regular cus- tOtn at Union.· SIL LI~1A~ H :'\ LL ~ever before has the 1\.s so cia tion building been so attractive as this fall. Last spring the \Valls were re-decorated, new mission furniture, sofa pillows, and curtains were added, and a new rug purchased for the assetnbly roo1n.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. as we mean to make it in the future. There is a place in this part of the State for a real univer- sity, and our adjacent departments should be bound together so closely that they will con- stitute a living organisn1 with living blood flow- ing through its veins.\ In introducing Dean Kirchwey, he said: \Our .first speaker is no stranger to Union University. For two years he was dean of the Albany Law School and rendered us a great service in that capacity. Since 1900 he has been dean of the· Columbia Law School, and I am sure that I express the feelings of everyone here when I say that we are grateful to him for taking so much time out of a busy life and coming here to bring words of inspiration to us.\ Dean Kirchwey's Address. Dean Kirchwey, opening his address 1n an tn- formal manner, said: \I must say that I a.m cheered rather than depressed by the prospect before tne. I had pictured to myself a chapel in which your worthy chancellor would be seated on the platforn1, and the dean and two or three faithful professors would be occupying a few seats in the front row. While I am agreeab:y surprised at the number of you who are present, T am also sure that the quality of the audience is in no degree lessened because of the number, for the rain to-day acts as a sieve through which only the finest can penetrate.\ Then beginning his address on \The Idea of a University,\ he said, in part, as follows: ''In beginning our inquiry into the idea of a university let us consider some of the vtews ·which are popularly held in our day. Cardinal Newman pictures a university as a collection of studies, or a place where all courses of study are presented. The German idea considers the university as beginning with an assembly of na- tions, and their university is now a place where national groups find instruction, usually of a pro- fessional character. Crossing the Channel into England we find that the idea is that of a col- lection of undergraduate colleges grouped under a more or less centralized form of administra- tion. When we cross the Atlantic, we find that the An1erican idea of a university is primarily that of a group of professional schools connected more or less intimately, though not necessarily, with a college of liberal arts. The Old Roman Idea. \Although I do not clesire to be tied down to philology, it may he profitable in this case to consider the derivation of the -vvord. The Roman term 'universitas' contains tre idea of a corpora~ tion, not a collection of single units, but an in~ tegral whole, an organism as distinguished from an aggregate of separate elements. On that old Roman idea I pin my ~aith. A university is not a collection of people, or of subjects of study, or of schoo~s loosely bound together-least of all, the last of these. Our American idea of a university as a college surrounded by profes~ sional schools bears not the slightest relation to the thought which dominates the idea that I shall endeavor to set before you. Influence of Political Ideas. \It is curious to observe how the political ideas of a people tend to dominate all their thinking. Thus the success of our federal government-if we may still, in the face of some of our popular notions-regard it as a success, has imposed up- on our higher education the ideal of a federal organization. \For instance, a collection of ten or twelve distinct schools may have a legislative council, a president with general administrative powers, and a variety of reserved powers will be invested in the different departrn ents. \Some one has said: \'For forms of go-vernment let fools contest, \Vhate'er is best administered is best.' \But if the question be one of administration, the serious difficulty is that our great institutions of learning tend more and more to become ad- ministrative entities, a.Rd to be accounted great and successful univers1ties by the administrative and political tests of bigness, complexity and or ganized m ul tifariousne ss. Administration Means to an End. \But in dealing with things of the mind and the spirit, administration is only a means to an end, and there is the gravest danger that this elaborateness of organization may in large meas- ure defeat the end, the only end, for which the university exists. You ask, of course: What is that end? Our Colu1nbia orators, in attempting to answer this very question, have expressed n1any different opinions, some of which are as follows: The cultivation of the humanitarian = v: tt e 0 0 v c t 1 (

THE CONCORDIE~SIS. 7 vil·tues; th€ cultivation of the ilnagi:nation; the training of men and women for practical service, especially in the applied sciences; the promoting of research work. The Cardinal Idea of the University. \All of these efforts, however lame and partial they may be, indicate the' conviction that back of the organization and administration the uni- versity has an idea and an ideal. The cardinal idea of the university is faith in the things of the mind and the spirit. A university should be the seat of human study, and it should teach devotion to truth. ''The university whose ideal is limited to fit- ting men to enter a profession is merely a trade school. It is not a university function to equip men for trades. The outside world is capable of doing that. The university is crippled spirit- ually because it introduces a purely commercial element which has no place there. To the univer- sity belongs that highest servi,ce of supplying a Who will show the world what needs to be done. Her function is, indeed, service, but not the cotn- monplace service which is performed hy the rank and· file of men, but the high transcendental service which dsks the loss of all n1aterial re- ward. The· university should trai'n rnen to serve willingly and in an unselfish spirit. The differen- tiation which makes the quality of an act-its fineness or its nobility-is the spirit or ain1 of the performance. An act done unselfishly and in the spirit of service is. a different thing- different in its effects, different in the scope and penetrating power of the achievement-than the sa1ne act performed sordidly or tneanly, 1n a spirit of gain or for a selfish n1otive.\ Union a Real University. In closing Dean Kirchwey said: \I an1 grate- ful to you for your hospitality and appreciate the privilege of speaking here. I will now justify your hospitality by plain speaking. I do not in- tend to say anything hard, because I do not think that you need it, as I am inclined to think that \The universities are the natural centers of the Union really is a university. Fine buildings and de1nand which does not yet exist. tnagnificent equipment are not what constitute a t~niversity. I fear that multifariousness of equip- nient n1ight often hamper the development of the true idea. Our political ideas also should not be applied to the university, and I a1n not sure whether Union will be more truly a university when she gets closer together. free and sympathetic organization of an educa- tional system directed to practical ends. It is for the1n to gather the best that emerges from the experiences of the past and incorporate it into the practices of the present. There is no roon1 in the university ror anything but scientific study, i. e., the study that relates the abstract to the concrete, that interprets life and its cotn- 111011 experiences in tern-;.s of the wider exper- iences of hu1nanity, still n1ore, perhaps, in tenns of philosophy. As Professor Dewey has said: Professor Dewey's Idea. \ 'It needs no argutnent to show that the lnod- ern university do~s ·not exist simply to rehearse the knowledge of the past; that it exists pre- cisely because there are so many fields in which, relatively, we have not got very far, but in which it is n1ost important that v-.re shall get farther; and in which the type of inquiry at-1d discussion that the university exists to fosterJ is the sole n1eans of advance.' Function of the University. \The law of supply and demand has no ap~ plication to the service of the uni' ersity. Her function is not to supply de1nands, but to create the1n. She is not to furnish n~cn to do the work which the world wants done. hut to furnish 1nen \Union should represent the true ideal of the scientific search for truth, the ideal of service which transcends ministering to the n1aterial needs of its students. The connnunity clen1ands that you furnish 1nen qualified for leadership in every departnl.ent to which you put your hancl, and that you prepare your students for the highest form of transcendental service.'' Hon. Alden Chester Speaks. Hon. Alden Chester, vice-president of the Board of Governors, was then introuclced as the first informal speaker of the afternoon. Judge Chester, whose address was brief, said in part: \After listening to the very interesting ad- dress of Dean Kirchwey, it seen1s too bad that the spirit of tl1e occasion should have come down to an informal address, for it will be entirely i11- forn1al, as I had no idea until this n1orning that T was down to say anything, either fonnal or ii~formal. However, I a1n glad of the oppor-

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. tunity to say that I consider the custom of bringing the student body of the university to- gether for one day every year an excellent one, and one which is pr0ductive of great good to the university. \I would suggest that if any or all of the de- partments are to keep up with the tilnes, each one must d.o its share. Since the founding of the different departments, wonderful advance has been made in the knowledge which the schools of law, n1edicine, and pharmacy, and the college respectively deal with. Each department must be constantly improving its equipn1ent and its methods of teaching if it is to prop~rly per- form its duty. Union University has had a won- derful past, but that great history should be sup- plemented by a ne\v care~r of usefulness.\ Dr. Vander Veer's Address. The last speaker of the morning was Dr. Al- bert Vander Veer, who spoke mainly in the in- terest of the tnedical department. In reviewing the many advantages which the tnedical college can now offer, he said: \This is now the fortieth year of my lecture- ship in the university, and I believe that our teaching facilities are now up to the maximum of any period of the departn1ent. We now have a new laboratory in physiological chemistry, which is attracting much attention; our chemical laboratory has been refurnished; and our anat- omical department was never in better condi- tion. We have a well-equipped departn1ent in the State Library devoted to the needs of out students. Also, in Albany there are many ex- cdlent hospitals, by means of which our students are able to gain a great deal of practical knowl- edge. \We have abundant reason to believe that our college and the courses of instruction offered are being appreciated. This year's freshman class is the largest in the history of the department. Every man in our junior and senior classes has returned, and we have an unusually large second year class. The capacity of the medical college is now crowded to its utmost. Our friends are 11ow exerting themselves in our behalf and we wtll have some new buildings ·within a few years. With additional buildings and equipment, I an1 snre that the medical college will not only main- tain her high reputation of the past, but that her sphere of influence and ber achievements will he stil.l greater in the future.\ Luncheon at Fr.a.ternity Houses. The exercises closed with the \Song to Old Union.\ The meeting then broke up and the visiting students from the Albany schools were escorted to the various fraternity houses, where they w,ere entertained for luncheon, while the tnembers of the faculties of the visiting depart- ments were entertained by Dr. and Mrs. Rich- ll:.ond. Jfoot mall WESLEYAN WINS FROM UNION IN A H.ARD-FOUGHT GAME Wesleyan, 6; Union, o. The game between Wesleyan and Union, which resulted in a 6 to o score in favor of our op- ponents, was well played by both teams. As usual, Wesleyan had a fast team, and the show- ing tnade hy the Garnet eleven was a surprise to everyone present. Not only did the Garnet team hold the Wesleyan hacks from making long gains, but outp~ayed the visitors in old-style football on the offense. In the latter part of the ga1ne, the Union backs broke through the \Vesleyan line for big g-ains. O'Connor and O'Connell at tacl~les were towers of strength and J=,roke up the Wesleyan line and not infrequently nailed the runner for a loss. Captain Brown at fullback tore up the line and 1nany times carried the ball through for good gains. Sarvey at half and Riley at end also dicl good work. Several tin1es V\Tesleyan made good gains on forward passes which the Union players did not solve. Wesleyan started the game by kicking off to {Tnion. Fairbairn returned the ball well, but could not gain on line plays. Wesleyan got the ba11 on a punt, but made no decided gains. In the first period the hall was kept in Union's territory for tnost of the time, and Vl esleyan \vas once within striking distance of the goal. When the twelve minutes were up, the visitors had the ball on Union's twenty-yard line. Line bucks advanced it to the ten-yard line, where Union held. As line bucks netted no gain Wes- leyan tried a forward pass, Eustis to McCarthy, = an Sc ca 011 p1:1 he \VI b<J R, tll T

Union took a bra:ee after being scored o·n and carried the ball down the fieid, only to ifose it on downs. The r:er.r1ainder of the perio~l was a punting duel between Brown and Bacon, 'honors being about even. Each side fumbled on.ce, but vvith no serious resuhs. McDermott took Fair- bairn's place at quarterback. Shortly aBer, H. Reilley took Dewey's place at halfback. D1-.ring the entire game a slight rain f.eH and this n1ade the gan:Te more uncertain than ever. The ball was slip·])lery and both sides f<t:tmbled O'CONNNLL AND SELLNO'W- · repeatedly. 0' Connor startecl the second half with a kick-off which sent the ball ag-ainst the goal posts. Twiee Union's goal was threatened; once Union was on Wesleyan's ten-yard line. In the last few rninutes of the third period, Un- ion n1ade a for-ward pass that nette<l: twenty yards. An onsid..e kick failed and Wesleyan got the ball in the center of the field. Time was called with the ball in the center of the grid- tron. ~ uring the labter part of the last period, the Garnet team pla.yed a snappy game in the face of in1pending .defeat. Taking the ball from the visitors Oli clowns, they tore OOW11 the entire length ·of the field, gaining on nearly every play. On their ten-yard line, Wesleyan pulled together and obtained the ball on .downs. For the rest of the period the ball was within twenty yards of the Wesleyan goal, with Union constantly threatenjng a touchdown. Union was unable to carry the ball over .and Wesleyan vvas unable to get it out of the vicinity of her goal. The period finally ended with Uni·on in possession of the ball 011 \V esleyan's fifteen-yard line. In the second p·eriod, Wesleyan tried to scor·e on a drop kick. Although n1any thought that the ball -vvent between the goal posts, the officials cl.ccided otherwise, and declared no goal. A few 1ninutes later, Brown of Union tried a placement kick, but the ball went wide. In the third period Brown tried a field goal. Again the wet and slippery ball went wide. After this neither team iT!8de an atte1npt for a goal. The line-up and sutnn1ary are as follows: ·uNION (o). vVESLEYAN (6). Riley ---------------~--------------- McCarthy Right End.

REPORT OF WESLEYAN GAME It is to be WITHOUT FOUNDATION. greatly la- mented that so many of our prominent news- papers allowed the publication of such a false account of the rela trans between Wesleyan and Union. For the Concordiensis has learned through communication with the Wesleyan au- thorities that the report was entirely without foundation and does not express the sentiments of their students. The following letter fro1n the manager of the Wesleyan tean1 explains their position: Editor of the Concordiensis, Schenectady, N. Y. Dear Sir: In reply to your letter of the twenty-fifth, I would say that the reports in the New York papers were entirely without authorization from anyone in this college. No action has been taken and I trust that none will be taken toward severing relations with Union College. * * * As to the decisions by the officials, I have no complaint to make, for we had opportunity to protest them and did not avail ourselves of it. We canont hold ourselves responsible for the reports which the ne\;vspapers have published concerning them. Again I as sure you that none of the reports in the New York papers of which you speak, have any foundation in fact, and so far as I have been able to ascertain, they did not come frotn any- one connected with this college. Very truly yours, W. R. MONTGOMERY, Manager. THE BASKETBALL SITUATION. Owing to the lack of funds this year, the Ath- letic Council feels that it is unable to stand the expense of hiring a basketball coach for the coming season, and the manager of the team is thus left to his own resources as to the best means of securing one. There is an abundance of good basketball material in college this year, but if the season is to be successful to any extent, an efficient ccach nntst be obtained. This year it is possible tG get a coach who has had wide experience in it. tercollegiate basketball.

Dean, the new Latin instructor, has started upon his work and has created a favor- able in1pression upon all who have come in.:to contact with hin1, either in his classes or e:lse- where. He has accepted this position for the year and will have charge of all the Latin classes under Dr. Ashmore until the latter is able to meet his class again, when Mr. Dean wilt act as his assistant. Dr. Ashmore, however, will not meet his classes until the winter terrn at least, and perhaps not until next year. Mr. Dean com.es with high recon1n1endatio1QS. He has had a thorough preparation for his work having graduated from Dartmouth with the de- gree of A. B., being sixth man in his class an & winning a Phi Beta Kappa key. Then he took a Master's degree at Pr:nceton, specializing ilil Latin. He was occupying a Fellowship chair in the Princeton Graduate School, one of the high- est honors attainable, v.rhen he accepted this in- structorship. In addition to all this, Princeton recommended hin1 highly in every respect. Mr. Dean understancl.s his work perfectly and is acquainted with every phase of it. He has a very pleasant, engaging tnanner and a forcef-1:11 character, w·hich often is shown in his classes. Union's Latin department has a reputation sec- ond to none and Mr. Dean seen1s well fitted to maintain the present high standit1g of a depart- ment noted for its scholarship. Fink, 'II, had an operation for appendicitis at the Ellis Hospital last week Saturday. The oper- ation was successful and he is getting alo11g nicely. THE CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. International Y. M. C. A .. Conv.....,ntion at Toronto. The thirty-seventh International Convention of the Young Men's Christian Associations· of North An1erica is to be held at Toronto, Can., from October 28-31 inclusive. This great tri- ennial gathering focuses the attention of the country upon an institution which has been a potent factor in raising the people of many lands to higher standards of right living and right thinking. The Y. M. C. A. now has so important a part in society that branches of it are found in' almost every country of the globe-· in the coun- tries of Europe, in China, Japan, in the ice- bound regions of Alaska, and in the torrid coun- tries of South America. Otto A. Faust, president of the Union College Association, left Thursday evening for Toronto as Union's delegate to this great convention. ''Chuck\' Waldron to Speak Sunday. At the Sun dey Vesper service C. N. vValclron, 'o6, secretary of the Graduate Council, is to speak upon the interesting subject, \The Un- popular Side of Christianity.\ THE PRESS CLUB. Mem ben:hip Rules Being Made Strict. With twenty-two regular tnembers and a bout thirty-five candidates for tnembership, the Press Club is indeed in· a flourishing condition. The roll will be kept as short as possible and all men, both regular members and especially can- didates, will be dropped if they are habitually absent from n1eetings and do not take an interest in the work of the organization. \What is the Press Club?'' does any of the. freshmen ask? \Push Club\ is a passable def- inition. The Press Club boon1s the college in every possible way-especiaLly through the news- papers. Then besides, wherever the college lacks anything, the Press Club provides for it wherever possible. The caps seen at the Wes- leyan gatne, for example, were handled by the club. It is one of the youngest but one of the strongest organizations on the \Hill and ad- vertises the college n1ore than anything else.

EDITED BY GRADUA l'E COUNCIL COUNCIL MEETING. The second r·egular meeting of the Graduate Council was held at the College, Friday, October 21st. Twenty-nine classes were represented and the interest shown by the men1bers in planning and debating tneasures, gave pron1ise of a suc- cessful futur.e. The purpose of the Cound 1 was to bring the aluntni together and secure s.ttpport for the college. Several important plans to this end were adopted, one of which deserves gen- eral attention. Mr. Clements, the treasurer, offered tlre fol- lo·wing resolution which was adopted by the CounciL The aim of the resolution was ap- proved by all, and the form and expression were carefully debated, for everyone felt that it should be so fra1ned as surely to meet the approval of the trustees of the college: \Resolved: That solicitations from the alumni for funds for the support of t:he college be tnade only by the president and trustees of the college, ur by or under the direction of the Graduate Council. That all funds thus secured shall be paid to the treasurer of the Board- of Trustees and used only for the rnaintenance of the Grad- uate Council and for permanent benefit of the college.\ The aitn of this motion, which is in keeping with the method employed at Princeton, where this alurnni support is rnost thoroughly develop- ed, is to protect the graduate from a constant stream of begging letters. There is to be one plan of giving to the college and in so direct a n1anner as to assure the giver that his rnoney will be properly handled. The way in wh.ich his gift is to be used he may still detennine, but the desire is to place at the disposal ()f the trustees a fund representing a constant graduate ~upport for Union's pennanent improven1.ent. Following this, another resolution was offered which will also be presented to the college au- thorities: \That no subscriptions for funds for CJ ny college purpose be solicited at Colntnence- m ent titne or at any other college gathering of a social nature.\ Without attempting to give a complete report of the meeting, several other n1atters deserve the attention of our alumni. Dr. Duane, Mr. M cE:lroy and. Mr. Oppenheim were .appointed as a comtnittee to consider the publishing of an alumni n1agazine. Nothing the Council can do in the near future, equals in itnportance work that brings the graduates in close touch with the college. While there is very little chance of the magazine being started this -·winter, and while the Concordiensis will ren1ain the best way to get news fr01n college this year, only by some such n1eans will we be able to keep alumni in- terested in Union's future. Those who attended the meeting were: S. T. Benedict, '6o; T. H. Fearey, '63; Judge A. P. Strong, '64; Dean Fiero, '67; D. M. Dunning, '68; C. E. Lawrence, '69; C. 0. Yates, '71; \--'· r-I.

RICHMOND AT ROCHESTER. For the first time in fourteen years the Asso- ciation of the Genesee Valley gave a reception to the president of the college. As has already been stated, this pro1ninent association has been inactive for some time past but the cordial way in which the men1bers welcotned Dr. Richmond, gives promise of a renewal of their past activ- ities. While in Rochester, Prexy was the guest of Mr. Schuyler Davis, and on the evening of Oc- tober r9th, a reception was held at the Univer- sity Club in the president's honor.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 14A CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM IS PREPARED FOR COLGATE Meet to Start at Three O'Clock. Union will meet Colg~te in a cross-country run for the fir-st time this afternoon. Both teams are in .fine condition and the run is expected to be a dose one. Four men from each college are to run and the points will be determined as foilows: The first man in receives one point; the second, two points, etc., the team scoring the least number of points winning the run. The course will be a road race, and the runners wHl not be taken through the fields, with the excep- tion of cutting across the corner of the Col-. lege property from Lenox Road on the return, the race ending with a lap around the track. The Union team will consist of Captain Travis, 'r I; Streever, '12; Rogers, '13, and La Barron, 'r 3. AU of the men but Streever were on the regular cross-conn try team last year. The Colgate team consists of W. F. Carney, captain; H. ]. Rowe, L. E. Pickard, and 0. F. Legeler. All of them are fast men, Captain Car- t1ey being an unusua:lly fast mile and two-mile runner. SOPHOMORE-FRESHMEN CONTESTS. Some Close Contests Expected. Union College will hold its annual sophomore- freshman contests on the college campus No- Yember 8th. These events are held to decide un- der-class supremacy. They are exciting con- siderable interest on the Hill and are sure to be \Ve ll contested. The events, all of which are to be run off on the football field, are as follows: roo-yard dash, half-mile tnilitary relay race, mile run, tug-of- war, wrestling bouts, and a football ~game. These eYents, together with the novice meets which are Robson & Adee . Bookmen now being held, are of incalculable value in de- veloping 'varsity rna ~erial. • The sophomore football team is unusually heavy and fast, and will have the benefit of sev- eral previous games. On the other hand, \frosh\ practice bas brought out a good squad and some 1914 men have shown up pron1inently as track candidates. On the whole, a close and inter- esting meet may be looked for. San1uel S. Martin of the Charleston Museum in South Carolina, was at Union ten weeks during the summer, classifying the collection of minerals and fossils in the library tnuseum. The students will be pleased to hear that two new sections of bleachers are soon to be set up. S. M. Cavert, 'ro, spoke at the opening ban- t; uet of the Boys' Bible Study Work in the Troy Y. M. C.

14:B MUCH INTEREST BEIN~G SHOWN IN MUSICAL CLUBS THIS YEAR Concerts Scheduled at Altamont and Cohoes. The musical dubs have by far the largest nu1nber of candidates this fall that they have had for many years. About fifty men are out for positions on the Gle·e Club, twenty for the Mandolin Club, and ten for the Banjo Club. This nun1ber will be materially reduced before the first concert, and it is expected that the best dub in the history of the college will be turned out. Manager Fink has announced a trip to Alta- nlont on November r Ith, and one to Cohoes on N ove1nber 16th. He has also partially arranged R Thanksgiving trip, which will be the longest in the history of the clubs. The Glee Club sang several se.lections at the s1noker of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers last Tuesday evening. The music was excellent, considering that it was the club's first 8ppearance this year. Atnong ·those out for positions on the clubs are: Glee Club: I9I r-· Miller, leader; Bentley, Duch- scherer, Fowler, Odell, Keckeley, Bowman, Cof- fln, Robinson, Tiebout, Leon, Hawley, Van Aer- naln, Gray--; rgrz-Churchill, Lawsing, Hequem- bourg, R\iley \Va1ser, Bates; 1913-La Barron, J\fale, Dewey, MacKnight, Bran1an, Lowe, Whit- tJey, Allen, Davis, Finley, Brate, :Hall, Fischle, Mayha1n, Allyn; r914-A.

The prospects for basketball this season are especially good. The tea1n pro1nises to be strong as all the old players are still in college .and in THE CONCORDIENSIS. good form., and there is much good material in the freshman ·class. Th.e armory wiH probably be secured again this year,. but the games wiH be played in the afternoon, instead of the evening as heretofore. The scheduie is a ·very good one and includes g-a1nes wi·th West Point, Syra.cus e, Colgate, Pratt, Rochester, Tufts and Massachusetts Tech. A coach must be secured for the team and in order to do this $roo must be subscribed, the A tihJetic Board being so short of funds that it i~ unable to pay for one this year. This amount will probably be obtained i11: a very short time through the efforts of the student body. The A thl:etic Board has decided that it would not be best to increase the amount of the athletic tax, ·so the money is to be raised :by subscription and voluntary offerings from the students and friends of the college. A dignified class of sen1ors had a heated de- hate in the class of philosophy as to whether \be1ng\ is or is not.
