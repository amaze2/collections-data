Be not disturbed, gentle reader. It was only the students celebrating the· <Completion of a successful basketball season in the form of a smoker held -at the Delta Phi house. Owing to the fact that the S. A. T. C. demanded that every one fbe in the land Gf dreams by 10:30 P. M., the annual Footh::t11 Smoker had to be foregone. But las~ night's event was a suitable reparation.

Nevertheless, it is rather unfair to the Greek language to judge it from Xenophon's standards of authorship, ami furthermore it is un- just to condemn it because it fails to produce such superlative emotions. Most students, incltl!dlng schoolboys, have enj.oyed the translations of Ho- mer, hut isn't it stretching the point to remark that any American boy would thrill over anything he wa:s told to learn?
