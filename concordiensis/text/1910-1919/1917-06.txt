Commencement week, th<).t season of all others when every Union ATHLETI·C GOODS man is proud of his Alma Mater is once more ushered in on the \high tide of the year.\ We wonder how many of Union's undergraduates are going to stay and do their bit to make this Commencement one of the kind RUBBER GOODS AUTO GOODS AUTO TIRES· that send the alumnus, who has given Allt·n.g Rubber Co. up several days of a busy life, home . . with a warm pride in hios heart at what old Union is doing. Perhaps, it '229 State Street. does mean a sacrifice to stay. Per- haps a iew days more at the begin~ ning of that summer job would put a few more dollars in the pocket- book against the ravages of next year's tuition. But we believe that our Alma Mater is worth the sacri- fice. Who said that Commeniement was g-oing to be a dull one this year? True, one or two of the usual festi- vitie.g have been given up, but they are of the sort that ought, perhaps, to be omitted at a time when frivolous and expensive things should be under the ban. To balance the account, there arc many new features, and some of the old onrs are more alive than ever. Surely, Commencement will be \vnrth staying for. . Steefel Broa. . ALBANY, N.
