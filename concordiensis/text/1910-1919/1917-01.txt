This was a familiar Revolution- ary sentiment. His most vigorous strokes, howevei-, are the ones which bring into strong relief the mental and moral qualities of those reckless insurgents ; his characters. They reflect his own passionate craving to live his own life, to give free rein to his emo- tions and finally they express his nature in their misguided mis- anthropy at the last. He immortal- ized in Manfred, in Cain, in Don Juan, and the other characters of l1is romantic poems that type of Re,·ol utionist, like himself, whose bold assertion of individuality and contempt for the bonds of con- vention and mo.rallaw leads them into an unbridled exercise of the passions. Cain is especially worthy of study, since it reveals the fact that the author, like the hero of his drama, is a religious skeptic. Byron here shows himself as a re- volter against the established teachings of the Church as well as against the established conven- tions of societ\'.
