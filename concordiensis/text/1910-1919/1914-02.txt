Place : A state road near Schenectady. \'Y ()U're a married man, Tom; you ought to be able to explain this thing somehow or another. She asks us to try and get her some dogwood daisies £rom that tree and the moment we turn our backs she's gone. She can't be kidnapped because even the faintest strug-g-le would have been heard over where W'f, were. That car which passed didn't stop, b-ut the only thing I can figure out is that she jumped on the running board as it went by. What I want to know is why t I know :a little about machinery, but that gets me. What do you say?\ '\That's the only way I can figure it out, BiU; she hitched on to that other machine, but how or v.vlly is too much for even a married man io surmise. Let's journey in and ramble back to town. I'll try to give you a little inside information about her on the way. She is just like this autmobile. You know wb.a.t a close friend she is with my wife-that's why I was so glad that you took a shi:ne to her. Misery loves conl- pany, you know. Riding nicely, isn't she?\ \Sure.

'\No no, self-starter; I understand per- fectly.\ ,/'She's geared too low for speed, but she's nice and steady; never slips with good gas. There's one thing you have to be careful about though-that awful temper. When she once begins to get hot around the radia ... tor you have to take her down a notch or two, and if she begins to back-fire I'd advise you to take the hill on high. As for lubri-., cation, she takes a tremendous lot of it\ and it's all high-class brands; but that should not make a great deal of difference to you. As well as I remember, when I was in college you used to take a glass once in a while yourself.\ \Oh that's all right about the lubrication~ what about the combustion?'' \Six good greenback-burning cylinders. The cylinder heads are riveted on rathet loosely and sometimes fly of£. I'd advise you not to use a heavy spark. There's quite a bit under her hood to be proud of, but it needs gentle management or it might strip the gears. She's awful hard on tires. You see she was brought up in the society swing and is accustomed to all manner of blow ... outs.\ \I suppose it would be well for me to take her for a little spin sometime and give her a little inside information about her- self. Probably she's never been told the exact truth in her life, but I want to marry

Come on!\ PROHIBITION CLUB. The Prohibition Club has not as yet done anything very definite, as a thing of this sort is rather a difficult proposition to han- dle. Material for discussion seems to be lacking, but a new book has been adopted by the club which is one prescribed by the N ati()nal Prohibition Association. From this book topics will be taken, upon which the club will discuss at its meetings. The meetings are held bi-monthly, on Friday nights in Silliman Hall. One is announced for February 27th. BLACK CAT. The Black Cat Club, as flourishing as tver, will hold its regular meeting on Fri- day night, the 27th. At this meeting the new members will be initiated into the club. DR. SWART WILL SPEAK. The vesper services for March 1st will be conducted by Dr. M. ]. Swart, who will speak on some of his interesting experiences in Siam. Dr. Swart was a medical mission- ary to Siam for fourteen years and made· a thorough study of the people and their con- dition. The Mission Study classes will close sometime during the second week ih March. Their final meeting wiU be in the form of a social gathering at Professor Taylor's resi- dence. MUSICAL CLUBS. On March 13th the Musical Clubs will journey to Albany~ where they will give what is hoped to be one of their most suc- cessful concerts. To do this, however, a full attendance at rehearsal is urged by \Stan.\ Smith and «'Dick\ Evans, leaders of the clubs. T·he Albany concert has been postponed to late in the season thisyear so that the clubs may be in the most perfected or- der before giving their concert. Meetings of the Glee Club are held every Monday night at 7 o'clock in Silliman Hall, and the Mandolin and Banjo Clubs rehearse every Thursday afternoon at 4 :30. T'HE LION AND THE MALE. When \Charlie\ Male was quite a small boy he went to a circus where one of the big feature of the show was a beautiful young girl with a trained lion. The girl walked out into the ring followed by the lion, and placed a lump of sugar between her ruby lips. The lion walked up and took the sugar from her lips with his teeth. \Great stunt, all right,.\ yelled \Charlie ''but I can do it, too!', \Of course,\ scornfully replied the girl. who did not relish having her act mini- mized, \but do you really think you can ?'' \Sure was the reply. \just as well as the lion can.\

l- a l- e l. l THE CON·CORDIENSIS 13 CORNELL DEBATERS WIN. Judges Give Unanimous Decision to the 1tlJ:acans. La.st Friday night, fiebruary 20, the an- nual debate between Cornell University and Union College occurred before a large au- dience. The decision of the judges went to the visitors; but th~ chairman of the board said later that, though the decision had to· be given on the w-Otrk of the teams .as a whole, the best debater of the- evening was D. A. ·Coulter of Union. The subject was: \Resolved That the states should adopt the principle of the minimum wage for women and children em- ployed in stores, shops, factories and by public service corporations, and the state itself.'!' Cornell, upholding the affirmative. was represented by : G. Bleecker Marq uet:te, '15; Louis Gaberma11!1 '15; William D. Smith, '15 (Captain) J a.nd Remington Rog- ers, '14, as alternate. Union's team was: Avrom M. Jacobs, '16; Raymond S. Blod- g-ett, 'i 5 ; Donald A. Coulter, '15 (Captain), and Mi'lton H. Sternf.eld., '16, as alternate. Some have said tha..t tbis was the best de- bate that ever took place in the chapel. Cornell argued that minimum wage was no radical measure, that employers could af- ford higher wages, an.cl that precedent was favorable. Union maintained that the scheme could be of no p~rmanent value be~ cause it would increase the problem of the unemployed, that it :is unfair in all par- ticulars, and that its universal adoption would be inexpedienL The rebuttal was particular snappy, and a.ll the speakers were on the j<>b. Attempts were made to refute all points on both sides~ except the part of Cornell's precedent argument deali!lg with England:1 and Union's main point, that where there is great competition of labor no law reg11lating wages cCln be of permanent value. During the debate Cornell showed especial proficiency in sarcasm and Union in gentlemanly conduct; but Cornell was also conspicuous for oratorical ability and Union for lack of it. This debate makes 'Cornell and Union equal in results-the first two contests were won by Union and the other two by the Ithacans. Probably the same teams will meet next year, which means another battle royal. The judges for the debate were : Robert J. Sanson of Amsterdam ( chair1nan), Wil- liam W. Farley and J. W. Scudder, both of Albany. By the way,' it might be in- teresting to note that the first and third affirmative speakers, with the third negative speaker, constituted the Schenectady High School team four years ago .. The team takes this opportunity of ex· pressing its thanks to Professor McKean for his unselfish cooperation before the de- bate. 1916-17 DEBATERS PICKED. The first of what is hoped to be made an annual event will take place March 4th, when the Sophomores meet the Freshmen in a debate: \For and against the commis- sion form of government for second-class cities of New York State.\ The Freshmen will debate the affirmative, the Sophomores the negative. At try-outs held Tuesday and Wednesday respectively the following team was picked: 1916-Foster Brown, Richard Taylor, Newell Smith, and James Taylor, alternate. 1917-Frankel, Tregurtha and Van Avery; alternate to be selected later. The judges at the try-outs were Prof. Mc- Kean and Ennis and Meneely of the senior class, and Coulter and Blodgett of the jun- iors. The members of both the underclasses should give the tea1ns their earnest support, as it is hoped that this debate will establish a precedent.

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS ON MARRIAGE. VII. I entered the, room in i ~~~~~~e time to hear Leslie read the following note to Hal : \Dear old Comrade :- Don't be surprised to get this note, for I've got to tell you something. I can't wait for you to answer my letter of three weeks ago. I told you then of some of my good times out here in New Eng- land, but I failed to tell you of some~hing I hoped might happen soon. It happened last night.! am married. Met· --;......- ' the finest girl you ever saw; fell in love with her at first sight. We were engaged just three weeks. 'Hoping you will take a trip up and meet the Mrs. some time soon, I am, as ever, \Your friend, \BOB.\ \Is he the quiet fellow you introduced to me last summer?\ asked Hal, after the let- ter was finished. \Yes my old schoolmate, 'Bob' Landon,\ replied Leslie. \He appeared to me to be a fellow who'd take well with the ladies,\ continued Hal. #(I dare say he is not as bashful as some people might think from his looks. How old is he?\ \Not more than twenty, if I can remem- ber correctly. He's two years younger than I, but he was as good a chum as any fellow of my age. ~ was around with him a lot be4ore I came to college, and I ought to know him pFetty welL\ ''''Do you think he is justified in getting married when he's so young, and especially \Vnile he's in college?\ I asked. '·Novv that'is a hard question to answer. from what [know of 'Bob,' he knew pretty well what sort of girl he didn't want, and he often to'lcl me that he vvouidn't take long to make up his mind when he found the girl that reaHy suited him. I venture to say that he bas found the right girl, and perhaps he has married her in spite of any OJ~position.'' \Do you think his parents objected to h. is marriage?\ asked Hal. \Without a doubt,\ Leslie answered, hint- ~tng also that perhaps his parents didn't know of the marriage until it ·was about to take place. \It's a wonder he isn't expelled from college. I've always heard that New Eng- land colleges are very strict about such conduct,\ Hal ventured. ''It would be extremely unfair to 'Bob' if such action \Vas taken about the matter. It's entirely a personal matter for any fel- low, and I don't see who should hinder him in picking out his better half and marrying her any time, so long as he is sensible and conscious of his choice,\ said Leslie with iervor. \This is a subject worth discussion,\ said 1 \Suppose you defend the married stu- dent and his views, and Hal and I will argue the other side.\ \We are agreed to do .so,\ said Hal. \Now show us some reasons to justify a fellow for getting married before he;s been away from his mother's apron-strings long enough .to get through college.\ \Well there are a number of reasons. In considering them, let's take 'Bob' for example. He went to a strange town to

She ean be the making of him ()r a great factor toward his ruin. I should say that all depends on th.e girl,\ said Leslie conser- vatively. \B.ut what is the relation of the married student to the other feUows ?\ I asked. \He isn't the same good fellow with them. He must lose a cle gree of popularity by getting mar.ried, must h.e not?\ '·'Doubtless :he will not join them in everything that college fellows are inclined to do, but he tnay serve as a dignified leader in student act~i vity if he's a fellow well liked,\ Leslie answered. u All this discnssion seems to deal with special instances,\ said I. \Now what should be our general conclusion if we were to think of every student alike?\ \You've beea listening to our argu- ments,\ said Hal, \suppose you sum them up for us.\ \Well frorn what has been said I con- chJde that marriage is an important step • in tbe success of failure of one's career~ Sucia a step should be deliberated thorough~ ly. lt would be weH to take a year or more tor :acquaintance, then some more time for a test of true love. In the meantime a fel- low can prove his worth; and there isn't one girl out of a thousand who wouldn't wai~-that is, if she really loved him. By looking forward to marrying.the finest girl in town a fellow is steadied into doing the best work while in college-to make a man of himself-a worthy husband. Such fel- low's sacrifice the pleasure and happiness of earli<er marriage, but they are justified in working for their higher aim. They look with syn1pathy on the poor weakling who has gone 'dippy' over some silly girl so that he can't study or do anything else. For suc:h is advised a stern order from 'dad' and a few years of waiting rather than im- me.diiate marriage.'' ''l~hat's my conclusion, exactly,\ said HaL \How does it appeal to you, Leslie?\ '.:1 confess I have followed such theory ever since I. have been in college. I wish 'Bol.)' Landon had got these ideas a year ago. Nevertheless, I wish him well.\

Spud wondered why .a depressed feeling came ~over him as he sauntered into the room one afternoon only to find it deserted. He sat down in his lazy fashion and prop- ped his feet up on the table. As he reached over toward the desk to get a match, an unfinished letter in the typewriter caught his weather eye. Rather casually he read. \Dear Dad-I may as well tell you now as later. I'm married to the sweetest creature in all the world. Her name is Sally, and-\ That was the extent of the note. Spucl wondered what would fit in to complete the sentence, but all that would come to his brain was-· \she lives down in our alley.'' He had been half dreaming, but as he real- ized what that note might mean he arose from his seat with a start. \Well that poor little shrimp of a Pete has been roped in and I didn't know a thing about it. Well, what can you expect of a freshman when the seniors set him such an example? Anyh·ow, I'll find him and tell him what I think about it whether he likes it or not.\ Without having the slightest idea where Pete could be found, Spud wandered down the street, and meeting quite a few of the fellows on the way, he informed them all that Pete had taken the oath of office for life. They were all anxious to congratulate Pete, and so by the time State Street was reached the congratulation committee num- bered about twenty, among whom were \Bill\ Mandeville, \Phil\ Mallen, \Bence'' Page, \Lynde\ Hokerk and \Charlie\ Male. all anxious to extend married hands fron1 n1arried hearts to their new brother-in- matrimony. \Bill\ spotted Pete as he was disappear- ing through the door of a drug store with I

Dr. John Dewey delivered his third lec- ture in the Chapel Monday evening. He considered language, developed by the social intercourse of men, becoming a means of preserving the results of the experiences of the race for the new-born individual and enabling n1en to become elevated above their physical activities and to learn to conduct themselves in an ideal world. The lectures next week will be delivered on Thursday and Friday evenings . The close relationship of thinking and language was noted in his lecture. An in- fant's gradu.al arrival at the power of lan- guage to communicate with other people was interesting-ly traced. Other things than language, which could be called a form of speech, gestures, manners, etc., were dis~ cussed. Dr~ Dewey said the language of a race and nation records the intellectual value that bas been gotten out of its ex- perience and its power to transfer it to an- other phase of life. Names, the speaker 'explained at some length, give one power over the things_, and as a developn1ent of this power man has attained an instrument of thought. He names the sun and the moon, singles them out of the physical flux and thus attains for himself a place in the realm of thougnt, of ideas.

FOURTH PSYCHOLOGY LECt'URE. Dr. John Dewey delivered the fourth of his series of psychology lectures T~ttesday evening in the Chapel. Tis subject was, HEmotionali ty and Rationality in Social E~e­ havior,\ and he treated it as some length. During his address .he said : \Emotional reactions lay hold (){ the primal, unlearned attitudes of men, tneir loves and hates, their hopes and fears, tbei~r elations and depressions. Because p()lities and religion, are, with so many men, hound up with these fundamental activities they are dangerous topics when the convention- alities require an agreeable and facile :inter- ;> course, skating upon the surface of things. \Emotional reactions implicate the entire organism in a literal sense. These diffel·- ences exhibit the difference betwee11 emo- tional and rational and routine behavior. \When we are enraged or elated or afraid, we are made pleased or scared all over. This 'all-overness' is the essential trait of emo- tionalized activity, while limitation an_d dis- tribution of action in selected channels is th(! essence of rationalized activity.\ Later he spoke on the \good old times/ as follows: \There is no more striking instance of the effect of our etnotionai reactions upon our intellectual attitude toward objects than is found in the postures we assume towar.d the past. The thought of the futility of tne re- action that might have been made calls out desperation and despair. T·he more the ]_)ast is thought of, the more intolerable it be- comes. But let a man c.ease to strive against the past, recognizing the uselessness -of Ids r-eactions, and idealization of the oppcsite kind sets in. We tend to dwell only upo1i those features of the past which chime with our present desires. From accepting it is but a step to dwelling on and cherishing:- it. It is the present, then, that is disagreeable, 19 because it checks our desires. The old times were the 'good old times.' Children today are not what they were in our day, colleges have deteriorated, the world is given over to frivolity, and things are going from bad to worse.\ THE SUPER MAN THE BAND. \Bill\ Mudge announces that there are about eighteen pieces being rehearsed by the band at the present time and that there is a good attendance at all rehearsals. This is indeed gratifying, and much credit· is due to the members for their spirit shown in playing at the games. This afternoon the band had its picture taken at White's. It will be used for the Garnet and in other publications. MATRIMONIAL MATHEMATICS. 1 plus 1 equals 1. 1 from 2 equals 3. 2 divided by 1 equals 0. 1 plus 1 equals company. 2 plus 1 equals 9,658. i \

THE CQN:CORDIENSIS 21 PRESS CLUB. The new standards that Dr, Hill has es- tablished the Press CJub under seem to be working out som,ewhat better than those heretofore adhered to. The club has been put on a new basis altogether and effective rules laid down, ,;vhich must be lived up to. The men are turning out to meetings in a good deal better form and there is a marked increase in enthusiasm now connected with the club. One new rule is to the effect that two un- excused absences will put a man on proba- tion, and a third absence will force his resignation from the Press Club. The new plan to have interesting outside speakers has met with approval with all the members and Dr. Hill is arranging a list that will come up to all that may be ex- pected. DR. HOFFMAN ILL. Head of Philosophy Dept. Confined With Bronchitis. Prof. Hoffman has a severe attack of cold which has developed into bronchitis. The trouble is not serious, but it is such as to necessi 1 tate his confinement to ,this ro:Om upon orders from his physician. Dr. Hoffman's illness is perhaps due in a large measure to the strain resulting from the extra work he has carri~d this year in addition to his already heavy schedule and to his incessently active interest in civic ma;tters and in scientific societies. The students hope that the Professor's ailment will be rapidly cured and that he will soon be with us again on the Campus. The following notice appears at his class- room: \Dr. Hoffman's classes will find on the board within, on days when their recitations regularly are held, questions covering the work he wishes the mto read. Room open 8 to 12 A. M.\ COLLEGE PLAY ASSURED. Ewens Writes Drama Written From Col- lege Life. The Dramatic Club will give a regular two and one-half hour play some time after Easter. The charming drama known as \Bargaining in the Future'' has been ap- proved by Dr. Hale and President Wads· worth and will be presented by the club's best talent. The author, H. C. Ewens, '14. has, with wonderful skill, written the play very close to college life, and it is bound to be a big hit not only with college men, but with all outsiders who know a good thing .; when they see it. The cast is a very large one and will furnish an opportunity for the dramatic talent which we know to be so rife at Union. T·he management hope to give the play in the \gym\ if the stage set- ting can be arranged. The club, however, expects very little difficulty in this direc- tion with so capable a director as 0. D. Lowell. Manager Meneely is a financial genius, hence, as President Wadsworth said in chapel, the play will be a financial as well as an artistic success. The name of the play is the best of a list which has been submitted, but the author reserves the right of changing the name as he sees fit_ NOT DUE TO SNOW STORM. Guthmann-Don't you run your cars on regular time anymore? Conductor-We're doing \Hesitation·· time now. SOMETIMES IT IS. When a woman hasn't any shape at all she blames it on nature. But when she has a good shape she regards it as a per- sonal achievement.-Attala Herald.

We believe that all institutions at Union that deserve boosting should receive espe- cial attention by the Concordiensis. As to whether the ''Marriage Market\ on the \hiU\ deserves bo~sting, we refuse to com·- mit ourselves by an affirmative or negative statement. The fact remains, however, that we have five (that we know of) married un- dergraduates amidst us. This is an unus~al social phenomenon wh:ic:h we feel should_ not pass unheralded: Hence, our \Married Men's Number.\ We Ita ve chosen tb.'e pen of jest and the ink of humor (the ,e[ean pen and the clear ink, if you please) t() write the glorious news into the Recorcls, not because we tvish to hold :anyone, personally, up to ridicule, but because the matrimonial state has al- ways been an objee:,t a:nd subJect of humor. However, while we ~may poke a little fun at our newlyweds in the other columns of our paper, we wish to say here, in an serious- ness, tha.t we are justly proud of our married students, and in this we voice the sentiment o the student body. We are proud .of them because they are students, real students. All of them have entered college in the single state and non~ of them, up()n leav- ing this state, have left their colleg-e spirit behind. The junior benedict is especially active in student af:fa.irs, and the seniors have certainly done their full share towards the support of stttclent activities. One senior has given much time and effort to the MaR do lin and G-1:ee Clubs, while two others :have given service in the field of athletics. -The most O()nspicuous and pleas- ing fact, however, is tlta t all of our married students, without exc~ption, are of high scholastic standing. Indeed, we venture to predict tllat at least two of them will be honor men this June. T·he Concordiensis ta.kes this opportunity to congratulate our married men upon being such fine students---a.nd their wives upon having sttch fine husb4nds. PLEASE.

US tvish al- fun of . them the leav- . . . ntors One to two d of leas- high to be . etng Of all the material things about our col- lege that we love, we take most pride in our beautiful campus and its surroundings. To have a towering smokestack rising dark and dour into the air is not only a pin prick in our pride, but is highly displeasing to the. aesthetic sense. Perhaps this ungainly obstruction to the western view cannot be eliminated, but it certainly can be made less shocking to the eye, The pain could be alleviated to a material extent; for instance, by painting the high brick-colored chimney a retiring gray. The United States Navy spent a lot of time and money to find a \battleship gray.\ Maybe our ingenious neighbors at the prodigious plant can devise, or know of, something even better for painting chimneys so as to make them as optically unobjectionable as possible. A pale, silver gray, with a faint lustre, is, for example, almost indistinguishable in misty weather while in bright, clear sun- light such a tint might help the unsightly stack to take on a semblance of almost atherial lightness and grace. Knowing, as we do, of so many instances of generosity on the part of the big cotn- pany, we believe that the only reason this matter has not been remedied is that it ha'3 not been taken up by the proper authorities . Perhaps_ it has not been called to their at- tention before.

WESLEYAN NOSES OUT VICTORY. Red and Black Triumphs Over the Garnet in Fastest Game of the ·Season. Wesleyan made a bold bid for the <;ham- p·ionship cup by beating Union Friday even- ing in the most spectacular game of the s~ason. From the start to the finish Dame F<>rtune favored the boys from Connecticut an<l frowned on the wearers of the Garnet. Union had several chances to win, but on each occasion the iron ring contracted and would not permit the passage of the elusive P'iU. Wesleyan started off :the first half with a rush, and baskets by Eaton and Win- chester quickly gave them a four-point lead. T:l1is was not to the liking of \Ernie\ Houghton and \Jake\ Beaver, so they at -()nee got busy, and with the help of the rest of the team, put Union in the lead, 11- '9~ when the whistle was blown to end the first half. At the beginning of the second half Wesleyan again started with a rush and g-ained a larger lead than Union could over- -c()me before the final whistle. The game was marred by personal fouls =o11 the part of Wesleyan. Twelve fouls were ~atled on the Red and Black and their two f~rst-string .-guards were .put out of the game for this offense. Winchester was the particular star of the game, niaking four long shots from behind his own center. Cleveland cannot be held entirely respon- sible for the scoring by his man, as he had difficulty in navigating, due to the fact that in the excitement he had neglected to bring his shoes with him.

From the score one may realize just what a good time they had. The score was 37 to 7 in favor of the wearers of the Garnet. Of these points, Haubner made 21, thereby bringing honor not only to 1917, but to Schenectady High School where \Joe\ learned how. \Teedy\ ·Woods and \Jake\ Beaver drew down 6 points each, and Cleveland and Girling each got two. \Erny\ Houghton and \Dave\ Beaver rested from the strenuous game of the pre- vious evening, but their places seem to have been ably filled. \Jake's\ description of the game and the court on which it was played was graphic enough to send the ~ollege n1eeting away Monday afternoon in very good humor. Haubner scored 7 field goals and 7 fron1 the foul mark. \Jake\ Beaver's points were made by 2 field goals and 2 foul goals, while Woods, Cleveland and Girting scored on field goals. The score: Union.

The election of officers of the Union Col- lege ;Christian Association will he held in Silliman Hall, Tuesday evening March 3, at eight o'ciock. About four weeks ago a Nominating Committee was appointed by the President to consider men for the of- fices. The report of the committee 1ol1ows: For President-. F. S. Randles, '15.. For Vic-President-R. Ainslee Orr, 'l6r l\1ulford D. De Forest, '16. For Treasurer-Raymond S. Blodgett, '15; H. Newton Hubbs, '15; Fred D. Cur-e, '15. For Secretary-David F. Chapman, '17; Milton M. Newell, '17. In addition to these nominations the name of anyone active in the work of the Christian Association may be nominated for any of the above offices, provided that such name is handed to the President or to the General Secretary not less than forty-eight hours preceding the time of the election. The constitution of the Association pro- v:des that active members may vote and hold office. Article 3, Section 1, reads : \The active membership of the Associa- tion shall consist of men, either students or members of the faculty of this institution, who are men1bers in good standing of an evangelical church and have applied 1for membership in the Association. Only active members shall have the right to vote and hold office.\ While we have no accurate list of the active mem hers of the association, still we do not feel that such metnbership would include men who have not been actively in- terested in one or more lines ·of our Asso- ciation work, without reference to financial contribution. We urge all those wh() have shown an active interest in our work to attend the election.

When I want to take in Junior Week, what do I do? I write home, ask a girl to come on, buy her mileage, pay the hotel expenses, send her flowers, call for her in a cab, have to take polite to a chaperon, and so on, for three days straight. But what do those married guys do? They 'phone down to wifie, 'There's a dance on at the 'gym' to· night. Now, for the love of Mike, don't show up late. And don't forget to bring my new pumps!' Now do you know why 1 want a wife ?\ \Ah these love-lorn youths,\ sighs George. \Do you know that in China you can get a good wife for fifty cents?\ \Well says Jimmie, \a good wife is worth fifty cents. But what have you got to offer me for a prospective bitter half wit l1 a comfortable dowry?\ [George drinks long and loud from the tin dipper which he has filled from the bucket of cocaine by his side.] \Here is a comely rnaiden,\ he announces. (He shows Jimmie a picture. Jimmie's eyes bulge out six inches.) \Some dame!\ he ejaculates. He reflects. \But how much of this world's goods dotl1 she possess?\ ''Five hundred dollars,\ answers George. \Have you anything a little better?\ asks Jimmie. ''Here is a skirt with a bank account of one thousand 'bones',\ advises George. \Not so bad,\ reflects Jimmie. \She has Syracuse hair,\ adds George \VVhad'da mean, Syracuse hair?\ de~ mands Jimmie. \Almost Auburn,\ answers George. 11 But what can you offer on your part.\ \Can't I jump twenty-three feet?\ G tb Q Sl cc n:: ht . at th cr \t th th as . tn ch te hi . ur vv SO to r : sa to

After questioning him as to the onset of the attack, the quack sin1ply said \plumbism.'' \Heine\ received some yellow piils, paid the fee and went avvay. Being a studious person and inter- ested in medicine, he searched the encyclo- pedia for the meaning of \plumbism\ and what lead pencils were made of. The next day \He returned to the quack and said: \You told me I had 'plumbism,' which is lead-poisoning, and I now find there is no lead in lead pencils, only graphite or plum- bago.\ \Oh replied the quack airily, \did I say plumbism is the cause of your lum- bism? I meant to have said plutnbago is the cause of your lumbago.\ \Oh said \Heine \but anyhow, your pillss are only bread.\ \Of course, of course,\ replied the quack; \don't you know that bread is the oldest and finest thing to remove pencil n1arks with? You didn't want me to give you India rubber pills did you?\ IN JACKSON'S GARDEN. Romeo Knight, '17-Won't you give me just a little love? Miss Practicable-I'm very sorry, but it's impossible. I left it home on the poano and forget to take the instrument with me. \Bense\ Page-l'm intoxicated with love. \Charlie\ Male-Then get married and sober up. Hubbard-What is the surest way to rob a married student of his good name? Hall-Put it in an numbrella.

32 THE CONCORDIENSIS ADVICE TO THE LOVELORN. Edited by W organ Milliams. My dear Miss Milliams-For some time past I have been much distressed. My sweetheart has seemed to me to be exceed- ingly cold. What shall I do? HART AWLEY. Buy her a hot water bottle-Ed. 1\tiy dear Miss MiUiams-Though I may seem to be unduly perturbed, I really wish that you would give me your candid opin- ion. I have been calling upon a young lady of my acquaintance for three evenings each week for the last six years. But, un- fortunately, because of the recent blizzard I was unable to make my accustomed call. Do you think she will be hurt? V. WOSBURGH. We should have honorable worry-Ed. My dear Miss Milliams-Ah! Wretch that I am. What buckets-yea, tubs of tears do I shed when I think of it! What a cruel ·monster I must be! Think! ! ! I forget to kiss her! What should be done with me? NEMO PAYLOR. Chlorformed-Ed. My dear Miss Milliams-For a long time have I desired a wife. I have \kale\ and a handsome form-yet no one wants me. I have searched this earth ; I have gone to Europe; I have gon~ to Asia-to Africa- to Cohoes- Troy ; I have scoured the deeps, but none could I find. Where, Oh where, Miss Editor, shall I go? CY BELMORE. Honestly, we'd like to tell you; but you know how it is-U. S. mail-general morals of the public. Oh, H-, we just can't use cuss words-Ed. My dear Miss Milliams-1 have been married only a short time yet I am wery heppy. Even now I see the cows twitter- ing in the trees and hear the birdies grazing in the pasture. 'Tis delightful to watch the clever ichneumon wend its way across the mead. Ah ! I am so happy. KYDNE:Y DE SPONGE. Well?-Ed. GEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING. Dr. Stoller-The geologist thinks nothing of a thousand years. Junior-Great Heavens! And that pretty geological student at Vassar promised to marry me soon. Flattering a young lady is merely con- firming her own opinion of herself-and thus establishing yourself as \the fellow who appreciates\ her. SANITARY. He-May I kiss you? She-Certainly.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 33 THE UNBMPLOYED--WHY~? Dr .. Robert 'f. Hill will go to New York City friday to attend the national confer- ence ~n the matter of the unemployed. Dr. F. S. Hoffman, who has been appointed chairman of the local commission to repre- sent Schenectady- at this gatherin~g, may al· so attend the c-onference if his health per- mits. Ma.yor J. T. Schoolcraft recently appoint- ed this commission to take up the question of Schenectady's unemployed, to investi- gate conditions here, and to represent the city at this national conference. 'The prob- lem of the unemployed is not a local ques- tion, neither is it associated with periods of depression alone. It is a national prob- lem of tremend<>us importance, (and one whi~h up to the present has not been met squarely. This conference in New York will undoubtedly do a great deal toward formulating some course of action, or at least of obtaining a wealth of facts which will for rna basis for further investigation and study. Schenectady's commission has been busied in obtaining statistics as to the unemployment here, and will represent the city, and also report for the city when called upon in the conference. A detailed report will be rendered the mayor upon the close of the n1eetings. Students of eco- nomics and government will find much to interest them in. the outcome of the national con:£erence in New York this week-end. Father-Jane~ are that young man's in- tentions serious? Da:ughter-I think so, pa; he says onr carriage shed could be easily transformed into a garage, and the attic would be a dandy billiard-r<>om and bowling alley.- Tb1ere are 111()re ways of winning a girl than by \stringing\ her-but there are fev.r 'better. STUDENT VOLUNTEERS MEET. Convention Held at Syracuse. At the eleventh annual convention of th~ Student Volunteers of New York State, Union was represented by the following men: Male, '13 ·; Story, '14; Orr, '16; Em- bree, '16; Gunning, '16; Fletcher, '16; Clough, '17; Coon, '17; Brandow, '17; Snell, '17. T·he delega.tion was joined Sunday by Baldwin, '14, and Randles, '15. The con- vention was held at Syracuse University on February 20th, 21st and 22nd. The number of delegates registered was over three hundred, representing twenty- five institutions. The purpose of the con- vention was to further the cause of the stu~ dent volunteer movement by giving irre- futable evidence that the greatest need is in the foreign field. Of the addresses, all of which were con- vincing, those of Dr. Samuel M. Zwemer. for a number of years a missionary in Africa, were probably the most inspiring. The fields represented personally by ex- perienced missionaries were Arabia, India, Persia, China and Japan. The Union delegation report that the con- vention was very successful and very in- .. sp1r1ng. TENNYSON REVISED. 'Tis better to have loved and lost Than ever to have loved and won. No matter how high a student's aim in life, he can always manage to reduce it to about five-feet-seven at the psychological moment. Even at the wedding the bride does not 1narry the best man. The things for which there is the devil to pay appears to be the only ones that some students always consider worth the price.

1. i '( I The Concordiensis NO. 13 VOL. 37 FEBRUARY 5, 1914 UNION DEFEATS COLGATE 20 TO lL He remembered vaguely that at some far-distant time Roland had rung that loud- mouthed bell in his ears. Yes, he remem- bered, becanse he had been dreaming that he was talking to a very sweet young sylph who had suddenly yawned. Straight- way that gentle pink-lipped orifice grew and grew and turned into a tremendous red bell that clanged and clanged and clanged. He supposed it was time to get up .... \Gonta make English t' asked a voice beside the bed. . . . . Aeons passed, centuries· glided by like seconds, whole lives seemed to have birth and death in a breathing time. Then he decided it was time to get up. So he did. As he was executing Mallen's special Au- stralian Crawl into his .X. Y. Z.'s a tremen- dous thought flashed through his clouded mind.. .This was one of those awe-inspiring thoughts that come at rare intervals to man. When you're falling down a long flight of marble stairs the thought will often flash through your head that you've left Uncle Dudley's nice new gold watch on the bureau. and you want to go back and get it right away. That's the kind of thought I mean -inspiration, you know-flashes of insight into strange unholy things-revelations. Well, our young man got one of these revelations. He felt it in his bones-he could tell by the slight tension upon the thorax and the titillation of the ligaments of his diaphram that he was conscious internally of a vague excitement! This was the day that some- thing was going to happen. Someth.ing was going to happen today. For the life of him he couldn't remen1ber what. He'd seen the \Quondam Queeas'' with Lulu Lightenstein and Dan Murphy, the \V. k. Hebrew impersonator, the day before. So he didn't have the burlequew to look for- \vard to. But that sense of \something today'' would not leave him . As he slid down stairs on a loose carpet- rod, struggling into a jersey and holding his books, hat, pad, sweater, fountain pen, regis- tration card, and Alpine Stock in the other, he reviewed the work of the day. He was in a complete state of ignorance concerning rnost of his classes, so there was nothing unusual to expect from them. That fluctu- ating of the heart might have been caused by the unusual fact of his knowing some lesson. But he was playing true to the dope and was right in mid-season form for unpreparedness. So it wasn't lessons. All day long he worried about th.at mys- terious sensation which still oppressed him frotn thne to time. He couldn't imagine v;hat was the cause of it, and soon gave up. But that evening, just at the close of the evening .meal, when the campus was veiled in the beautiful haze (of the drizzling rain

10 THE CONCORDIENSIS storm) ; when the gorgeous west was lit here and there by brilliant tints of scarlet and gold (when some fireman on the D. & H. left the boiler door open) ; and when, from low on the horizon, twinkling irrides- cent points of heavenly light showed where the night shifts were working in the Amer-· ican Locomotive Works; in the tnidst of all this pastoral twilight beauty, then the in- spiration flashed across his mind ! He knew what he had been trying to remember all day long 1 Ah, yes, dearly beloved reader; ah, yes, gentle at-long-distance peruser, he at last realized that that night was the night the \Concordy'\ came out l That was :vvhat he had been worrying about! That was the secret of his mysterious impulses! .... What he wanted to know was about the Colgate game ! Well, you see, this story is a myth. In the first place, the hero of the tale is the creature of a decadent, turbid in1agination. In the second place, everybody knows when the 'Concordy\ cotnes out. In the third place, everybody knows the result of the Colgate-Union game. What's the use of trying to pull old stuff? The Beavers, Houghton, \Teedy\ Woods and \Peck\ Cleveland played their usual snappy game. It's just a case of trying to invent new adjectives when you speak about the Union basketball team. Everybody knows what they do. So we'll let the Col- gate gatne go about like this : Colgate was lucky to drag down elevent points while lJ nion was getting twenty. We hand it to thetn for that. Now for a little French. First Stude: \What did 'Chuck' Wald- ron say about the intemperance of women?\ Second Stude: ~'He said that nine-tenths of the 'skirts' you see nowadays are tight.'' LAW SCHOOL EASY FOR S.ECONDS. Last Saturday evening while the varsity was trin1ming Colgate, the second team was staging a similar performance in the gytn with Albany Law 'School lbefore a sman but enthusiastic audience. It was perfectly apparent from the first ·whistle that the law school did not have a chance of winning. Playing with varsity form and wonderful passwork, the seconds 1olled up a score of 27 points in the first half, while the law school quintet 1nanaged to squeeze out 10 tallies. After the first few ,minutes of the second half practically a new team was on the floor for U n:ion, every man except Galbraith being replaced. T·his fresh teatn piled up 12 more points and the Albany boys added 3 to their score. The final score was : Sec- onds, 39; Albany Law School, 13. Other games are being arranged for the second tean'l and these deserve support from tl1e student body. J\. winning varsity is only made through a hard-working second team, and the seconds this year have been more than faithful. The score and line-up : Albany Law School (13) B.

Harrison S. Elliott, secretary of the Y. M. C. A. of New York, spoke at \1~ espers last Sunday. He spoke on \The Bible and Its Purposes.\ Before the V es- pers a meeting for next year's Bible Class lt·aders was held, and plans were discussed for the work. Secretary Male will start the work of next year's leaders during the spring term, so as to make the work for the next year less and the leaders more familiar with the series of lessons. At 7 :30 P. M. a cabinet meeting was held, at which time Mr. Elliott offerred ma~y suggestions for better efficiency in the asso- ciation. The Mission Study classes every Tuesday night continue to grow in size, and the stu= dents have taken a very great interest in them. Last Tuesd3:y night N. N. Iengar, 1 13, gave a very good talk on \Hinduism -vvith which subject he is thoroughly ac- quainted. Mr. Iengar was to have spoken on January 27th, but arrived in Schenectady ruary 25th. The Association is planning to send depu- tations out of town. There will be one either the last of February or the first of 11arch, and also during Easter week.

For vveeks the talk of the campus has been \prom.\ and soiree plans, house-party details, and how to ob- tain the \wherewithal.\ The Concordiensis ha.s already given the schedule of events and the general plans for both big dances. On lVIonday night Chairman Brunet called a 1neeting of the soiree committee and com- pi eted the arrangen1 ents for the 1916 dance. Thos. A. Dent met his \prom.\ committee yesterday afternoon and went over all the plans for the junior function. Now all i~ in readiness and only seven days remain before the first event of the best Junior \Veek Union has ever seen. too late. The delegation team that went to the Kan?as City convention are tto give a re- port of the convention at the First Presby- terian Church on Wednesday evening, Feb- The sophomore soiree will usher in the 1914 festivities on Thursday night. For this dance, as for the junior pron1enade on the following night, the gyn1nasium will be decorated elaborately with greens and south- ern smilax. Attractive dance orders and splendid buffet luncheons will distinguish the parties. Chair.man Dent has announced that the decorations for the junior dance will be .entirely different from those of the soiree, and that other changes will be made. Both committees will show the students what can be done with a setting such as the new gymnastum.

.•• t I: 12 THE CON:CORDIENSIS On Friday afternoon of the week, the musical clubs will give an informal concert tion with this, the Dramatic Club will stage a thirty-minute \skit\ entitled, \The Bishop's Comedy,'' dramatized by Professor S. P. Chase fvom a short story by the same title. After the program at the high school, the Sigma Phi fraternity will give a tea. The second of the college musicales will take place on Friday night preliminary to the \prom..;' Evan Williams will give the recital. Matinee parties and teas will be in order for Saturday afternoon, and at 8 o'clock the varsity will play Colgate in the gym. Sev- eral of the fraternities will hold informal house dances after the game; and Sunday the various house parties will break up. A complete list of the \crowds\ which will hold parties this year can not be ascertained as yet. Above is a rough outline of the events, and the committees in charge have been working for a long time ,to make1 (their plans meet the desire of a majority of the students for the best Junior Week \ever\ ! Now it is up to the felows to support the dances; to get in and help make the week a marvelous success. Everyone can help, and next week, above all times, its up to us Union men to show our guests what we have here, and how we can entertain. It will take a large number of the students to do this, and both dance chairmen have asked for cooperation. Next week a hundred or more girls will invade the campus and will bear away impressions, not only of the ap- pearance of the college, but of the atmos- phere of the place and of the student body. Let us see to it that they go away saying all n1anner of good of the college-and that means cooperation. ALUMNI NOTES. Mr. Willian1 J.

THE CONCO,RDIENSIS 13 (By Webb, '14) As I entered the Tower ~ Room I found Leslie read- ing his afternoon rna il. \fieUo Webb,\ he said in his cordiai manner. \fast got a letter from an o'1d schoolmate of n1ine. He's tn a New England college now. Says he's getting <Jn well for a freshman, bu. t writes of a problem 1 want you to consider. Just read this sheet.\ I took the part of the let· ter and read as follows: \You know, old comrade, I =--=::... 0 h d 1 . ~ · a a very c ean reputation back in my home town, but I fear certain reports are being spread an1ong my friends that I am sowing son1e 'wild oats.' \Now I am writing you and sotn e other good friends in order to deny absolutely any tale of imn1oral conduct or itnten1perate living on n1y part. I want you to under- stand the situation. '\iVhen I catne here it was my luck to becotne associated with son1e fellows who are 'sports' in the real sense of the tern1. ~rhey are good fellows and mean all right, but they take pride in boasting of their good times in cotnpany with loose wo1nen, and of other detnoralizing acts. In order to be a jolly fellow among them and to gain any degree of popularity, I have to tnake them believe that I atn one of tl1eir nun1ber in all these things. Doubtless some of the stories I have permitted to circulate about here giving me bad rep1..1te have found their way to tny home town ; but I am glad to say that they are false. and th.a.t by putting up a 'bluff' I have lived r·espectably and been quite popular, too.\ As I finished, we both sat staring for a .moment into the fire burning quietly on the hearth. Leslie was the first to break the silence. \Webb I believe the sentences you have read express the great problem that e-very student must consider. Roy's a clean, manly fellow, and I believe every vvord he has written. But I fear he can- not he a 'bluffer' always. He likes to be a popular fellow, and he spends his money freely.!'' \It's. natural for every student to seek popularity,\ I remarked. 'So it is,\ said Leslie thoughtfully. ''No student wants to be stiff and odd and un- popular. He is taunted by the term 'goody-goody,' and the way in which he is shtutned is most unbearable. But Roy if,n't sttch a fellow. He could be popular without throwing a 'bluff,' I believe.\ \Y ott mean he would be just as well liked 1 f he ca.tne out and told the fellows his prin- ciples?'' I asked. \Decidedly so, and in the end he will be more highly respected. He never will gain much by throwing a 'bluff.' He must draw a. line according to his principles and stand by it, or else discard his principles and be equal to his associates.\ \Wl1at do you say about picking one's co111pany? Isn't it possible for a student to find fellows for his associates who up- hold lil<e principles?\ I asked. 'Yes, this is generally true; and I believe one should be ·of strong character 1 who continues to associate with fellows not in symJ)a thy with his ideals. If he must do so, b.e should give thern the uplifting in- fluence of a manly life.\ \B tt t if he declares hitnself opposed to the conduct of his fellows he will become

. I : ll: . : ': i } 14 1~HE C·ONCORDIENSIS unpopular, will he not ?\ ''Perhaps so at first, but if he mingles with the fellows in the right spirit, humbly and patiently showing them his views, I believe he will largely win them to his way of thinldng; and in the end command their highest respect.\ \But suppose he fails to lead his fel- lows, and must forsake his principles or become unpopular in spite of his good na- ture?\ \Could he be respected for giving up good principles? And would his popularity be worth the sacrifice of character?\ said Leslie. What do you think? CONCERNING PREXY. On Friday evening President Richmond spoke at the alumni banquet which was held in Amsterdam. A number of the faculty fnom Jhere attended the banquet, after which college songs were sung, led by a few of the students who went especially for that purpose. On Sunday Prexy held the services at Wells Colege, while on Monday and Tues- day nights he attended alumni banquets in Rochester and Buffalo. FRESHMEN WIN TROPHY. The freshman basketball squad by hard and consistent work won the Wililam R. Joseph trophy. The freshman team went through their schedule without a single de-- feat. In the last games both sophomote and junior teams were ahead of the freshman team in the first half, but the second half told a different story, and the freshtnen won both games. , On Saturday, January 24th, the freshmen beat the seniors and the soph- omores beat the juniors. On Wednesday, January 28th, the seniors broke their string of defeats by beating the junior team. On the same evening the freshm.en defeated the sophomores in a hard-fought game. On Sat- nrday, January 31st, the season ended with a victory for the seniors over the sopho ..... n1ores, and one for the freshmen over the juniors. The season ended with the fresh_, rn en leading with six victories and no de ... feats. The sophornores came next with three victories and three defeats. After the sophomores came the seniors with two vic ... tories and four defeats. The j,uniors stood at the end of the list, with one victory and five defeats. The brightest stars of the tournament were Baker, '14; Goodman, '17, and Rozecrans, '17. · Never dive into the pool while full; ~in-· toxicated persons drown easily. CLASSICAL CLUB ACQUIRES SONGS. VVhether the Classical Club will branch out as a rival to Stan. Smith's Glee Club remains to be seen, but a novel part of th~ year's work so far has been the acquiring ot several well-known Latin songs. The club's repetoire at present includes \Lau- riger Horatius,\ \Integer Vital\ and \Gau- deanlus.\ At the meeting held last Tuesday hight, Dr. Kellogg read an interesting papet· on \Ancient Ephesus and the Ephesian Church,\ setting forth the contributions of that ancient tovvn to Christianity. Follow- ing the paper, Professor Bennett made sev- eral valuable suggestions for the future work of the club. '16: \Hey frosh, what the deuce are you wearing your pants wrong side out for?\ '17: \Well you see, I want to go to the Prom. and I've got to get the bulge out of the knees.\ The many friends of Mrs. Richmond, who were deeply grieved to know that she was very ill in the Albany Hospital, will be pleased to hear that her condition is rapidly improving and that we expect soon to have her with us on the \Hill.\ I .

I ' f \ I . THE CONCO&DIENSIS 15 THE S·OIREE IS COMING. .Do you really know what a good time is? Imagine yourself in a tiny, palm-hidden nook of a giant ballroom. Out through the green lattice work you can look across the glistening, mirror-like floor as it stretche·; away bewilderingly far and finally merges like a big, silent pool into fringing green banks about its border. From overhead a million bars of soothing amber light are filtering down through a 1ace-w·ork of hem- lock and spruce, while the delicious odor of ·forest and mountain creeps into your nostrils and smothers all thoughts of care from your £aged brain with its vague, mystic intoxication. The amber Hght-bars reflect ·'vveirdly in the silent depths of-but you'\Ve no eye for all this. All this is the mere setting, the mere frame to the real picture. Imagine yourself by Her side. Never have you seen Her more beautiful, more entrancingly lovely, than now. Covertly, with long, lingering~ glan~es, you drink in Her swirling hair, Her limpid, depthless hlue eyes; Her sun-kissed cheeks and full, rose-hued lips; the swan-Hke poise of Her graceful neck and the gleam of her dainty white shoulders ; vaguely at first, then irre- sistibly creaps in a wild longing to crush her in your aching arm~. You half rise from your seat; you-then, like the wild rushing of flood waters over some low- down plain, sweep in the first strains of a melody so resistless and magnetic that the cords in your legs commence to writhe and twist in sympathy as the sound waves flow backward and forward over the long, tempt- ing floor. Instinctively you glance at Her; instinctively she turns to you. Instinctively your arms slip about her yielding waist and. with her magic breath gently caressing your hot cheeks, you glide out into the maelstron1 of other Res and Shes to dance away bliss- filled seconds, minutes, hours, before the siren Rag-Time. It must be days later that you find your- self seated once more by Her side. Now you're in a whirling, reeling taxi that lurches madly along over creaking snow .. Through the frosty windows struggle wierd·, check- ered splotches from the wintry moon, while an occasional passing arc-light n1elts them an into one dun. glow as it slips by. It's in the high school auditorium. In connec- cold in the taxi and She's close, very close, to you now. Your brain and Her's are still whirling with the color and light of the ball- room-and it's very, very cold in the taxi. Instinctively you turn to Her; instinctively She glances up at you. Instinctively your burning {lips form a 'time-worn sentet.ce ' that's never said aloud. Then-a little whis- pered word, a little, m·eaningless struggle, and the first, long, lingering kiss. SWIMMING POOL OPENS. After long and tedious waiting, the event- ful hour of the eventful day arrived when the swimming tank was to be opened ; and ·what a splash! Freshmen, sophomores,. juniors, seniors and alumni, who were wait- ing impatiently outside, all dived in with a yell to flood· the welcome tide above the tiled brim. T:be freshmen were represented iu especially large quantities on account of the fact that '~Doc. Mac\ had just been giv- ing them their twice-weekly lesson in phy- sical torture, but the other classes were in evidence to a considerable extent also. Phil. 1tiallen and most of his water sprites were with the throng and showed considerable speed, taking into account the existing cir- cumstances. \Doc. Mac'' appointed his board of inspectors to see that no dirt should get int<> the pool along with the en- thusiastic studes. Luckily there were no accidents, and it is hoped that there will b~ n.one. Danger is reduced to its minitnum by the perfect set of rules which are being- enforced. and it is expedient that all using the pool shoald cooperate with those in charge to see that these rules are lived up to. Let's give a long yell for the pool!

THINK IT OVER. .\lthough it seems strange, it is never- theless a fact that the majority of men all over the country who go through a full four years of earnest work at college still fail to gather in, as it were, a very itnportant part of their education while it is so near their grasp. It might be well tu tnention incidentally that some of these rnen actually exist not a thousand miles fron1 Schenectady. T·here seen1s to be an idea prevalent an1ong men of the under- graduate age that they will be required to attend to all that is worth while,. and those things which are not forced upon then1 are passed with a glance and con- sidered, in the rnaj1ority of 'Cases, as things -vvhich take up valuable time without suf- ficient recompense. If young college men should observe a little more closely they should find that a great deal may be gained at little cost if they will take advantage of things vvhich take place about them-things at which their presence is not required. \Vhat may serve to strengthen a man's emotional nature better than the music vvhich may be heard at various occasions in the college chapel? What may serve to broaden his n1ind more than the va- rious views of great speakers, who come to us through the influence of various institutions or soc.i·eties existing within the college or directly connected with it? These n1en come to instruct us concerning subjects which they have studied exten- sively and about which they are as well informed as any. From them we may rece1ve instruction which could never reach us through the classroom, and with scarcely an effort on our part. To hear a good speaker who knows his subject vvell is a stin1 ulant to the 1nind, whether his subject be socialism, religion, psychol- ogy, anitnal life, Chinese customs, or what not. \Is it harmful for us to know these things.?\ That is the question which we are son1etimes asked, and we immediately a1tempt to answer with another query. ''\.Vill it do us m1.1ch good?\ This ques- tion is never worthy of an answer when asked by a man in his proper mind and ; . { ' : / ' '· ' I I ., I

Good ,fectures about the important issues of tbe day in various .countries af€ among the gre.atest benefits which a co][-eg,e man can take advantage of, and the man who does not avail himself of the greed oppor- tunities which are laid before him aiong this line saclly neglects a great ;part of his college education. Besides these highly intellectual lectures from noted men, there are other advan- tages vvhich students might avail theln- selves of if they could be made to realize their importance. A man who fails to attend such highly artistic n1nsicales 'as those Jw·hich ·:.have }been i:rendl~red in ithe college chapel during the past few years~ when the chance presents itself to him, is neglecting the finer part of '11is nature and stifling the emotional ch.a:racteristic of his soul. If he is an engineer, he soon becomes a \roughneck engineer:2'' and if he is an arts man, he sin1ply bec-on1es a ':ro-ughneck,\ which is much W()1'Se. Some studr:nts wake up to these facts by the time they become juniors.; a few. in fact, arouse themselves at .an earlier date, but, sad to relate, some a.re never awakened. Let us not belon~· to the latter class. ~f we are fresh1nen, sopho- tnores, juniors or seniors, and ltave been a~l-eep to the finer things going- on about us, now is the titne to get .right. 1\hink it over. A REMINDER. apply specifically to Union CoUege stu- 4 dents or to any other partiett~ar set of men. However several complaints have come to us during the past few weeks concern- ing another class of men who are rather careless about picking thin.g-s up when they are found lying around. No~r, fellows, laying aside all else which we rn~ght choose to call this, it is at least poor sp icit. It shows a lack of true brotherly feeling which should, and in most cases does, bind Union m·en together in a common cause, namely, the uplift of that which we love so dearly-our Alma Mater. If we lack this feeling, let us cultivate it; i£ we have it, let us strengthen it, for in it ties a vast atnount of good for Union, .f'()r our coun- try and the right. The Junior Week number of the Con- cordiensis will appear next week. The l\larried Men's number will be out on February 26th. Any one d_esiring extra copies of these numbers will notify the business manager at once. COOPERATION NEEDED. Editor Faust of the Garnet reports that things are progressing, but better progress is hindered by lack of coopet-ation of the student body. He makes a11other appeal for student contributions, the lack of which the Editorial Board feels most keenly as the time draws nearer for the annual to go to press. There has been, up to this issue of the \Concordy no classroom jokes handed to tlte editor, yet these occur every day on tbe hill. Fel- lows, it only takes a moment to write down that amusing incident you heard to- day in class; and it wil ltake only another moment to hand it to the editors. Do it Some fellows are awfully ca:r.eless about leaving their thing-s lying around. Now that's a general statement, which does not now \lest you forget.\

18 THE CON:C'ORDIENSIS . .., THE JOYS AND SORROWS OF THE SECTION GANG. (Spud \stands in\ with the Faculty.) Evidently Pete was rather disturbed as he rushed into the room and slammed the door behind him. \I'm out of luck, Spud; don't know what's the matter, but everything's wrong. Can't work, can't sleep, can't enjoy myself, haven't any appetite or any money. I guess they'll bust me out this term. And it's all because I can't get an even break in luck. They don't give n1e a square deal; think I'm lazy or devilish or something-! don't know what it is, but somehow-say, what are you smiling at, you fat boob?'' \Got a match?\ \Yes here; smoke yourself to death. You seem to think just because football season's over you have to keep that stove going all the time.\ · \ 'Tis better to smoke here than here- after, Pete.\ \Yes but I know some people who stand a pretty good chance of doing both.\ \Not mentioning any names, Pete?\ \No; but one is a big fat guy that looks sort of like you. He doesn't care a rap fer anything, don't know anything, a regular boob-\ !'Never mind the rest, Snicklefritz; I know who you're talking about.\ \Glad you recognize yourself, at least.\ 'Well, I may be a boob, but I wouldn't tell 'Chuck' Waldron that I don't know· what the Elastic Clause in the Constitution . \ 1S.

Pike attempted to take up the dialogue. '\Snch an act as blurs the grace and blush f d \ o tno esty.

As he passed Tubby, a clumsy foot was thrust into his path and the un- fort<ttnate \pet of the faculty ( ?) \ sprawled hin1self full length upon the floor. \Several seem to appear conspicuous by their absence, nevertheless we will proceed with our usual work.\ Some of the more or less sleepy ones yawned, stretched out and were soon in the land o'f slumbers .. \This morning I wish to give the class a few demonstrations of proper ges ticula- tion. Ah, Mr. Spud, will you stand before the class as an example? I'm sure you will be perfect. Now, just give us any quota- tion from Shakespeare which you thinks suits the occasion, with proper gestures. Anything whatever will do.\ Spud thought a moment, but his old luck was with him and, in grand form, he ad- dressed his audience, while pointing his forefinger· at Pike. \ 'You Cassius has a lean and hungry look,' \ he began. Pike was disturbed. He looked out of the window and fidgeted his hands ner- vously behind him. The class was in an uproar.

Pete found him smoking his Missouri meerscaum. \Well Spud, where's your fortune now?'' \You're not only dead broke, but you're in debt besides.\ \Thanks for the lobster,-· ah, well, let's go to 'slunch'; I think a good hash feed would make me forget all about it.

THIS IS A FACT. \Garry'' Woods tells a story which he says occurred in his \home town,\ Geneva. acarry\ was in the postoifice one morning during Christmas vacation when a 1nan came in with two little boys. One little fellow looked around for a moment, then he said, \Papa what makes the funny smell in here?\ His brother turned quickly and said, \'Shut up, Tommy, don't you know it's the dead letters?'' If Stan. Smith had been there there would be a different tale to tell. A NEW COLLEGE COURSE. A course in horse-shoeing will be started at Cornell this month, in connection with the Veter1narv College. THE CONCERT. Somebody said that this year's musical clubs are the best ever. He's right. We refer you to the local concert last Tuesday night. The high school auditoriutn was well filled when the glee club rendered the open- ing nun1ber about~ :30, and everybody was glad he or she cam:e. The vocal work was all good, and the men -vvon considerable applause. The heaviest piece they tried was lVIoore's \Wake Up, S-vv,eet Melody.\ Stan. Sn1ith sang a solo, \Down in a Dungeon Cell.\ His profunda notes irnprove every tin1e we hear him. The quartet also cntrihuted its share: H. Gun-· ning took \Garry'' Woods' place in the ab- sence of the latter. 'fhe banjo quartet appeared twice in light pieces and succeeded in amusing as well as in1pressing the listeners. But the real sen- sation of the evening, in the opinion of many, \Vas the rema;rkable work of the tnandolin club. 'The fellows showed their ability in everything they played, but when they swung into the \Chi rafferna i1 nio furore\ (sextette), from \Lucia di Lan1mer- moor,\ they carried everybody with them. It was great! Of course, Roger MacMillan's solo, De Bernot's ''Scene de Ballet,\ was ex- cellent, and, of course, the audience realized it. \1\lhile we are handing out the ap- plause, we n1ust not forget the spirited ac- companin1ent of \Bill\ Mudge in the solo nutnber. For every selection offered an encore -vvas demanded. Frosh : \Where are you going t' Soph: ''Over to Press Club.'' Frosh : \vV ait, take my pants along too. -vv ill you ?''

COSMOPOLITAN CLUB .. PROHIBITION CL lJB. 21 The Cosmopolitan Club will tneet next Wednesday evening. Mr. Eghuyan will speak on the subj;ect of \Easter at Jeru- salern.\ The next meeting after this will probably occur two weeks from Wednes- day,. The last meeting was a business rn~e~ing to draw up a constitution for the dub. The Prohil> ition Club met Friday even- ing (January- 30) in Sillima.n Hall to disc11ss plans for Jtheir ,fut~re :course of action. It VIas decided that the members should prepare papers on the various phases of the liquor question, to be read on~ at each rn·eeting. It was also dec-ided

,_I , \! ' I: ' I I: 'I I ' ! I 22 THE C·ONCORDIENSIS to adopt for thorough study Mr. Warner's ''Social Welfare and the Liquor Problem;' .. which is considered as the last word on the question. At this meet~ng Van Avery, '17, was eJected to the organization. Mr. Passage, who was elected secretary, is a member oi the class of 1917, not 1914, as vv-as erroneously stated in last week's \Con- cordy.\ The club has adopted the con- stitution used by the Intercollegiate Pro- hibition iAssociation, ;reserving the privi- lege of making amendments as they see fit. The club desires it to be known to the _ student body that it has no connection at aU with the P·rohibition Party, as the am- biguity of the names might suggest. Also no pledges are required of tnembers. HOW AB·OUT THIS. In 1830 or thereabouts there were seven \customs\ concerning freshmen at Harvard. They were as follows : 1. No freshman shall wear his hat in the college yard, except it rains, snows, or hails, or he is on horseback or has both hands full, or the like. 2. No freshman shall talk saucily to his senior, or speak to hitn with his hat on: but if he be graduate, \Sir\ must be put be- fore his name ; if an undregraduate, \Sir'' after his name. 3. No freshman shall laugh in his senior's face. 4. No freshman shall ask his sen ion an itnpertinent question. 5. No freshman shall intrude in his se- . ' n1or s con1pany. 6. No freshman shall wear his hat in his . ' h sentor s ·C amber. 7. Freshmen may wear their hats on at dinner tin1e except when they receive con1~ n1ons of bread and beer. Mary took her kid to schoo 1 ' A learned poet once wrote; The doggoned teacher kicked And that got Mary's goat. PRESS CLUB. it out ' At the suggestion of Dr. Hill, the faculty adviser, the PressClub has decided to try a new plan to get the college news before the public. An editor-in-chief was appointed at one of the last meetings. Also there were appointed the sub-editors for each day of the ~reek. The reporters are given assignments and are required to have them in on a speci- fied date. The typists have their regular days of reporting for duty as under the old system. The editor-in-chief has his office hours from 1 :00 to 1 :30 P. M. It is hoped that this change will make the club more efficient than ever before. There have been several freshmen taken into membership this year and the club is making a great ef- fort, under the leadership of President Wal- 'North, to become of more value to the col- lege. Plans for a new Union College Song Book have been considered, and it is hoped that one will be published a little later.

Greetings in the name of cold, grey Dorp, where sit m umchance (ensconced through- out the weary months), all of us, your humble swains-where we, the devoted pupils of the University of Woman's Eyes, perforce, are made to stew and quake and cram our listless brains with as much as- sorted knowledge as we can not resist. But for a short season, in the grim frozen winter, comes Eternal Spring to us; and we forget Stresses and Electricity and the ec- centricities of tbe \W :ill to Believe\ in the unforgetable, joyous, fleeting, but eternal moments of this Eternal Spring which blooms with such delightful regularity, and which we christen Junior Week. Then (for that short period) the iron-grey campus, un- yielding and pinched in the grip of Old Winter, blooms as never Captain Jack's Garden bloomed in the days of its fairest radiance-for the bloom is exotic, orchid- like, fleeting, ephemeral, rare, sweet ; and, above all, ladies, the bloom is You ! Yes, you lily-lipped gazelles, you Turkish Pomegranates, you sloe-eyed Fatimas ; blushing, bridling, smiling, sweetly frown- ing, glancing, glowing, laughing-eyed, happy-souled, poppy-breathing, soul-de- stroying, lotus-eyed, magicing witches,. with your rustlings and bowings, your glidhlg grace, your intricate devisings, your devious J ' ~ .... schemings (011, the ·eyes under th~ lifng •I'' lashes looking sideways !) , your tige~lne, sinuous tread, your silks, your satins, your powders-aye, even your powders, ladies[- frivolity, joy, sympathy, sweetness, even a touch of gentle malice, delicate ~inuendo masquerading as candor, small bickers, large making-up after the storm-ah, ladies, these are your bloom ! And these do we transport bodily to our storm-dusty campus for this short space of time, and these do we live for, and these do we remember long after the N. Y. C. & H. R. R. R. has plucked our gentle p·osies and transported them once more beyond our farthest ken. And for this reason, ladies, that you bring a little of the joy which transforms life to immortality to us among our books, and our tawny beards, and our shapeless lives, do we bid you sincerest Welcome to our little hole in the wall. One and all-svelte, purple-eyed Dispensers of Delight; tiny, delicate sylphs with golden sunshine for hair; ingenuous younglings, sophisticated, limpid-orbed, wise virgins, one and all- come, ladies, come-let us sport with Amaryllis in the shade of the Gymnasium Atumnorum; allovv us the pleasure of dis- cussing Shakespeare and the Musical

SOIREE OPENS FESTIVITIES. Junior Week Will Open This Evening With the Sophomore Dance i·n the New Gym- . nas1um. This evening the festivities of Junior Week will begin with the Sophomore Soiree in the gyn1nasium. For this initial dance, Chairman Brunet has spared no pains to decorate the building in a fitting manner for its initiation into the gayety of Junior Week. The decorations will be made up of evergreen boughs and southern smilax, and the \gym\ will lose its professional air temporarily and take on a bewitching and entrancing appearance, suitable to the de- lightful demoiselles who will swarm there this evening. A delicious buffet supper will be served during the intern1ission. The dance orders are beautifttl little pearl-cov- ered affairs and will make most appropriate souvenirs of the function. The patronesses will be, in addition to the Faculty members' wives: Mrs. J. C. Jackson, Mrs. W. F. MacMillan, Jvirs. F. B. Richards, Mrs. DeForest W. Weed,_ Mrs. R. H.

Tomorrow night the climax of Junior Week wiU take place in the new gymnasium in the form of the Junior Promenade. To- day's events, and the concerts tomorrow, will serve merely as a means of heightening for the 1915 function, \vhich will be the be-st ever held during a Junior Week at Union. Chairman Thomas A. Dent, fr., has reserved many of his plans from pubUcation, so that the event might exceed all expectations. The committee has secured a professional for the decorating and will work all day with him, utilizing smilax, evergreens, box- wood; palms, class banners, and what not, ir:n converting the main floor into an appro- priate background for the \prom.\ An elab- borate buffet luncheon· will be served from th,e south wing of the building during the intermission and the auxiliary hall in the north wing wiii be opened up for additional dancing space. Exceedingly attractive dance orders, containing a careful choice of popular dance music, will form another prominent feature of the party. But why tell more of plans? Suffice it to say-it's to be the biggest and best dance \ever and very appropriate as the initial \prom.\ in our wonderful new \gym''! P. ~Chase, Mrs. Walter L. Upson, Mrs. Charles B.

A most enjoyable afternoon is promised the house-party guests who attend the joint entertainment of the n1usical clubs and the Dramatic Club in the high school q.uditor- ium tomorrow at 2:30 o'clock. The Glee Club will sing three numbers; the Mando- lin Club will play twice, and the male quar- tet will appear for one selection.

After the concert a very informal thirty- minute \skit entitled \The Bishop's Comedy/' will be presented by the Dra- matic Club. Dr. S. P. Chase, assistant professor of English, dramatized this bit of comedy from Leonard Merrick's short story of the same title. The play, althoug-h short, is a clever dialogue and has several amusing situations. The theme of the \Bishop's Comedy\ cen- ters around the friendship of an English bishop and a popular actress. The bishop

12 THE CONCORDIEN.SIS has ventured to write a play for Kitty and meets with difficulties. These he tells to Kitty, who succeeds in pacifying him, and all goes well until the actress receives a call from the bishop's wife, Mrs. Meadows, who has come, \without the formality of an introduction, to talk with Miss Clarges on a tnatter of the utmost importance.'' What is said in the interview and the final outcome you ·will learn ton1orrow afternoon in the presentation by the following cast: Miss Kitty Clarges, an actress ......... . ..................

The plan for appointing a board of cen- sorship for the purpose of restricting the styles of dances at the Soiree and the Prom .. seems to be a very good one, and the fol- lowing men have been nam,ed to act in that capacity: Mr. Mach usa Clark, chair- man; ably assisted by Aeroplane Mudge, Bobbin Cole, Bunny Hug Jackson, Grizzly Eghiyan, Stichen Kink Naumann and Pump- handle Lewis. It is hoped that these gen= tlemen will realize the responsibility which is being placed upon them, and will not only do their duty in a material way, but also by setting an example to the students in gen- eral which shall be irreproachable.\ Cornell has 3,500 men pvailable for varsity teams, while Michigan comes next with 3,462. Columbia with 3,075, and Pennsyl- vania with 2,400, are the only other institu- tions having more than 2,000 men available . ., ' i. ' l ~ ' . , .·.; ' ,,

(Just a fable, with a prologue, to throw the ladies off their guard.) When most of us have danced all night and tried to bat up a few sensible remarks during the sunny hours we· become rather tired. Along with this comes a sort of reckless abandon. We have put Philosophy on the shelf and haven't anything to guide us. Just as likely as not in a moment of excitement our heart is liable to swell up and we fino ourselves telling sot?eone that we haven't much of a grip on the commer- cial world, that it will probably be a couple of months after we graduate before we will earn more than twenty-five dollars, not E. 0. S. (every other Saturday), but straight. But that if she wants to take a chance, why all right. We will become en- gaged. This is a sort of. cold-blooded for- mula of talk for the grand spiel of your life, but the romancers can rig up their own invitation. Its all right if she tells him to gather up enough collateral to keep one, before he talks about buying provender for two, or more. If she doesn't turn the young applicant down, then that is where the tobogganing begins. Father's front door locked, \no-help- wanted\ signs billed all over the town, mil- linery and dry goods wagons stopping every few minutes in front of the house. Most of us a:re safe, however. The Ladies Home Journal says (not in just these words) that the fair sex of today usually wants to see what is written on the outside of the last four or five pay envelopes before she lets the entreprenneur even open his mouth. This is the sad story that a man who gra.duated from Amherst last year told around. A fellow that packed up a marriage license with his 'dip' when he parted from his dear old walls. 'The story is entitled, uFrom Caviar to Crackers.\ Berty got a holiday on the Fourth, of course; every clerk, except a jail .registrar, gets the Fourth of July off. Bright and early he arose from the army cot and went o.ut on the front porch, or platform, to be more specific, which was added to the front door. Berty was going to make the easy chair early so that he could get the full value of a day off. Every thing was fine. The house faced the west, so that the house shaded the easy chair. Berty put the chair on the sidewaJk so that he could put his feet upon the platform. He got all the back newspapers, so that he could catch up on the sporting news, an advertisement fa:a in his hand, and last, but not least, the old pipe, filled to the very brim with P. A. You see it was a little early in the day to have any cool stuff in front of him. But he wasn't worrying.· Wifey had overlooked at the inventory the night before a nickel that he had tucked away in his hatband. Forecast for the day: This is going to be a happy day for the bread-winner. Noth- ing doing! When Wifey started to boil over the coffee for breakfast she began to think up a holiday program. Poor Berty was sort of dreading this, but he hoped that Geraldine would lack ingenuity and give up the planning for a real day of rest. When she finished doping out a plan for the day she was all worked up, ready to floor Hubby if he showed any sign of inertia. He was approached, but he couldn't see it at all. ''It's too bad when a man gets a day off that he can call a holiday that- I'm getting sick and tired of this shagging around with a lunch box. And I'll be- (N otice the rough stuff that has crept into Berty's vocabulary). He did though. They all do, when they are threatened with short rations or a cam- paign battle for the next two weeks. ''I won't cook another ·meal for you\ -you know, snapping the fingers, and so on. The lunch basket was hung on Be.rty 5 s

16 THE CONCORDIENSIS arm. The savings bank jimmied open. The:v ·were on their way. Was he happy? Sur~ he was. He was going on a church picnic, to a grove. The train was a little late, probably an hour or so. Everybody stood around on the platform, while the sun tried to bake the whole bunch. Of course, tl1ce dear little things were there playing arottn.ti trying to chin themselves on Berty's arm. vVifey. · B,erty stayed where he belonged. Just as soon as everybody had choked do\iVn a few sandwiches the train pulled' in. 'fhe party was over. Berty tried to fill in the time on his way Berty managed to lose his wife on the train, gathered a few low-browed friends i~a the party around him in the smoker for :a quiet, friendly game of poker, nickel a chi1;>, bank on the table, matches instead of chips., so that the game could be called noodles.. Just as everybody got their coats off and chests close to the table the minister dropp erl home by telling his wife what a rotten time he had, and who helped to make it worse. He was getting sick and tired of being panned out in front of everybody. He was getting nicely into his own when Wifey started to grind her teeth and open and close her hands. This choked off the de- bate. They finally met on the mutual ground that they could have had a better time sit- ting on the front porch with its fine view in on the opposite seat to kid the boys. This gummed the only bright spot in tie whole excursion. Pretty soon the train banged into tae station. Everybody pushed and shoved, as they always will when they see that tbe door is small and the crowd great. S<>tne woman picked up the wrong basket and g()t away with it. The woman that lost the basket didn't want to start anything, and at the same time didn't want to come sn()rt, so she looked unconcerned and grabbed tile one that looked as if it would fill her ~ill of fare best. You know this sort of tbing has got to stop. or go on to a rough finish. Someone made a flying shot that she dicl11't expect to find thieves at a church affair. Someone else took her up. with a comeb~ck about not being a lady. Squalls come ttp very quickly. The principals, second~ ,().nd sympathizers were just starting to mix: it up when Berty spoke up and said he -took the wrong basket by mistake. Then every- thing was hunky again. 'They all piled off the train. The yo11ttg-er unmarried people divided by twos. Berty tried the pairing-off stunt without his Nife, bnt th1~ 'vas n·ipped in the bud quickly by of the factory district.

WHY THE SUN ROSE EARLY. WILLIAMS WINS WHIRLWIND GAME. The :Ber;kshire Boys Overcome the Garnet Quintet in. Fast, Brilliant Game. Union's Customary Se~ond-Half Sprint Failed to Materiaili'ze, Making Final Score 24-14. The Williams College basketball five de- feated Union Saturday night at Williams- town by a score of 24-14. The game was a hotly-eontested one, in which fast, close play a bounded on both sides. The score at the end of the first half was 10-10, Union leading ·ttntil the last few minutes of play by a score of 8-2. Shortly before the whistle blew, Williams, by a wonderful burst of c~ever play, tied the score. The wearers of the Purple seemed to have hit their stride, and in the second half scored fourteen points to Union\s four. Play on both sides was furious, but com- paratively few fouls were called. The Gar- net playect somewhat the cleaner game of the two teams, for no fouls were ca.lled on Union till the second half. Except at rare intervals there was no chance to display the brilliant open pass-work which has char- acterized Union's game this and past sea- sons. Williams succeeded in holding dovvn the Garnet throughout, and it was seldom that the Beaver twins could get away with- in speaking distance . of the OJ.>}>Onents' basket. Williams' game was fast and shifty, but was marred occasionally by shots, which, if successful, would have been called bril- liant, bu.t which, as it was, seemed reckless. Union also suffered from this defect. The first basket of the contest was scored by Williams soon after the game began. This was followed in quick succession by baskets by Houghton and Woods .and by a foul goal pocketed by \Erny .\ For a short time it seemed all lT nion's game. \Teedy\ Woods scored another basket and Hough- ton three more foul points, while \Peck\

18 THE. CONCORDIENSIS Cleveland and the Beavers smothered their opponents in blocking and passing. Soon afterwards Williams rallied, and three field goals in quick succession tied the score. It looked at that time like a very close game, while the play of the Garnet assured Union supporters of a quick get~away in the second half, and victory by a comfort- able margin. The spectators were much pleased with Williams' work in standing-off the Garnet. Evidently reports of the team had preceded the boys to old Ephe Wil- liams' little college, and supporters of the Purple were nearly as surprised as Union rooters at the fifty-fifty split. The second half began, like the first, with a basket for Williams in the first few min- utes of play. This was scored by Captain Hodge, who played a fast and hard game throughout the two periods. Union evened up the score when \Erny\ Houghton drop- ped the ball into the basket from the middle of the court. This was a beautiful shot and brought a big \hand\ from the rooters. Two baskets in quick succession made the score 16-12 in favor of Williams. Houghton slipped another tally into the summary, and there Union's scori~g stopped. Williams rolled up eight more points, three field goals and two foul goals, before the whistle blew. The second half was enlivened by a lot ot tight play, when the officials lightened their grip somewhat on the teams and al- lowed a little scrimmaging to creep ip.. The two Beavers were smothered, as in the first half, only more so, and did not have a chance to get near the baskets. Perhaps the fact that in the first half seven fouls were called on Williams, with none for Union ,while in the second three fouls were called on each team, may explain the atti- tude of the referees. Individually, Captain Hodge played the best game for the Purple, scoring five field goals and two fouls. Garfield and Healy each put up a good game. \Erny\ Houghton played a brilliant game, keeping his man from scoring, and making the high score for Union with a total of ten. points. He was easily the star for Union. Snappy, shifty passing marked the Beaver's work. \Teedy\ Woods scored a couple of baskets, while ''Peck\ Cleye- land obliged with some good guarding and one back-handed stop that was dazzling. \Wally\ Girling got in the game for a few moments at the end of the second half, but had litHe chance to shine. Well, they won. The score was decisive enough to .make the victory no fluke, and we give 'em credit. If Union rooters felt dissatisfied occasionally with various mat- ters, so did Williams-and results are re· suits, after all. There's one consolation, anyway---we've a big chance to come back on the evening of March 7th! T·he score: Williams (24) F.B. F.G. T.P.

We ·choke. We gasp with emotion. The pen falls from our hands. It is enough that you are here. On with the dance, let joy be unconfined. What care we for the affairs of the world? Neither that 4 'stick\ exam. soon ·coming, nor the Mexican mix-up, nor Bryan's grape Ju.ice controversy, nor Johnny Bennett's re- maining dog can worry us. We had rather be dancing that divine Hesitation with you tonight than be sitting with the gods of Olympus with old Mr. Zeus himself pour- ing libations into our cups. You see, girls, we are temporarily crazy, and why not? Who dares deny that you are the jolliest, m:ost luscious aggregation of petite pemoi- selles who ever gathered here to pay devout worship to our Lady Terpsichore?· We are proud of you. We are crazy about you (as we said above). We just knew life would be stripped of all its happiness if you should not come, but now that you are here-well. vve wouldn't change places with President Wilson; Ty Cobb, or even Prexy. That's how much we like you. Do you get us? We hesitate to speak about the festivities which begin this evening. Here, too, words fail us. The phrase \best ever\ has become too hackneyed to be used, but let us say this: Never before have we had such an We cannot accomplish the impossible, opportunity to employ that phrase correct- I I ,• ( <, .I . l ~· . l I '

Never could a gym nasi urn be found ideal enough to be the scene of your rhythmic rotnpings, your tan- talizing tangos, your wonderful waltzes anq your lively one-steps. Still we feel that we have the best to be :found. Let it suffice. Oh! For a thousand tongues to sing our Junior Week girls' praise! And then we would leave half unsaid. The few days of concentrated bliss will slip ·away all too fast. ' Sing, dance and make merry, for Sunday you depart (Our Epicurean philosophy brought down to date). It is with a concen- trated, ~ublimated· quintessence of delight that we 'bid you welcome. Union belongs to you for the present. With one last, gasp- ing breath we raise our paeons of joy to the high heavens to bid you welcome. WHAT A FARCE. In another part of this issue there ap- pears an article under the· above title. We wish to call attention to it editorially. We urge every man in college to read it and think about it. Some may call it over- drawn. We feel that it is not. We feel very strongly that a reform and an imme- diate one is needed in the Excuse Commit- tee. Matters have grown steadily worse for three years. Protests have been made, but to no avail. No concessions have been made. We feel that it is high time that the student body take definite action to ,elimi- nate or to ameliorate this deplorable state of affairs. Lack of space forbids us to say more at this time, but we will have more to say on this subject later. We ask, how- ever, that you read the article and giv~ it ~arnest thought. STAFF ARTIST. We wish to announce that a competition has been OP,ened for the position of staff artist on th,e Concordiensis Board. We have felt the need of more illustrations in the body of The Concordiensis, and for oc- casional new; designs for our cover. Var- ious other im:provements have been made in the paper during the year, and we feel that it is in line with the spirit of progress to add a staff artist to the Board. The lack of such a pe:rson has handicapped. us con- siderably during the year, though various ,, designs and illustrations have been con- tributed by students. The com petition will open immediately, and all the m~n who wish to register for it should see the Editor-in-chief at once. The election will occur at the end of this term. DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW. Why Nat Meet the Student Body Hftlf Way and Seek a Mutual Understanding? In the course of a controversy between Faculty and students, the general opinion is that the latter are invariably in the wrong. People cannot understand how undergrad- uate students are in a position to uphold the right principle, in the face of contradictions from such a knowing body as a college fac- ulty. But, on the contrary, the fact is that in a great many of such differences the members of the Faculty are strongly biased. and entirely unwilling to see things from the students' point of view. Their word is final and the students must necessarily ' live up to it. We speak of ''student government\ in colleges. Planned out in theory, the system is a splendid one, and we can see a great many benefits to be derived from such self-

i ., ., ' l '' l I i , L! I I 22'\ THE CONCORDJENSIS government. But how about the actual operation of such a plan? Even with their representative student councils, the men have by no ~means a \carte blanche.\ Not even in their own activities. The Faculty interferes on every possible occasion. They say that students are not capable of con- ducting their activities w!ithout direction. They are net serious enough, not depend- able. How ,then are they going to develop the power to reg-ulate their own affairs? What will happen. when they lea.ve the guiding hands of their instructors and get out into the world? Who, then, will suggest tl~'e right path in every instance? Such rnen will have to ~start from tbe very beginning and form a basis to work upon. But all this should be accomplished dur- ing a man's college years. It should be a part of his ~course; for of what use is his education without such a working basis? What is the purpose of a oollege education, if n~- ~~JcfeC\te ~·spirit of self-dependence? ~\lt . 1 pQw .. is ;;ucrh· ,a thing possible wh_en there exist nard and fas~ r-ules for an enttre I . fitudent boqy? Freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors alike, ar,e all under strict surveillance. One can understand why freshmen, wllo are so easily influenced by e~vironmeat~ should be kept under hand; but ~~~!~ap.ply the same principle to upper- cl~ssmen? How are they to develop a sense of c~nfidence in their ability to manage their ow~; affair~ if they are not given the oppor- .. . r -- • - tunity to d() so? Seniors m:ttst endure all· the \red tape\ which tends to hold the newly-arrived fr~sh­ men in check. If seniors even, cannot be treated' like nen, the colleg-e has failed, and failed dismally, in its purpcse. Again, tn e faculty faits to compvehend the studen1s' point of view, regarding the election of llis studies; aad, even further, does not seek to know it. It is a known fact (and our own profes ... sors have admitted it) that students elect a subject for some one of three reasons. First, because in some cases they are forced to fill in the required number of hours for a course; secondly, because they desi\re a genera:!! idea of the subject, and thirdly, be- cause they really wish to make a deep study of the subject. Now, a professor may he truly conscien- tious in his work and try to give his class the best possible course in a subject, but ... he should always stop to con~ider the m~en in his class. There is a difference in the time which ·can be devoted to that particular su'bj ect by 'the various students. Some 'will study it in detail, while others cannot spare so much time. To be successful, the instructor must not outline an extremely difficult course, but should rather seek a \golden mean,\ by which all can profit. In a very few cases, however, do they realize the before-men- tioned distinction. All of these questions, and many more of the same type, are continually coming up among the students right here on \the I-Iill.\ But no decisions can be reached, and nothing can be settled, for, in most in'stances) the Faculty will not meet them even ~half way. Various members of the FacuHv ad1nit that these evils exist. What cc.~:.n we do about it? \He who hesitates is lost,\ VVas what one used to say, But just now, during Junior Week, It's quite the other way. The track committee of the University of Pennsylvania has set standard perfor- mances for the different events, and all mak- ing the required performance will be award- ed medals of proficiency. The move is an effort to stimulate track interest. I ',I

The fellow who has all the money he wants to spend is in dan-· ger of getting sidetracked by social pleasure.

He must sacrifice much pleasure for th~ sake of attaining his end.'' '-'This is very true, Leslie,\ said I. \I can see how the fellow who works is indus- trious, self-reliant and purposeful, but he misses much of college life that is of great benefit. He misses the training derived from the various studenl' activities which would tend toward culture. And perhaps his scholarship may be hindered by much outside work.\ \Any fellow could overwork in an unrea- sonable way; but a sensible fellow who works afternoons and evenings, getting his lessons early in the morning, has a bit of experience that his wealthier fellows may not have. He is on the road to real man- hood. He knows something of the hard ways of the world. He gains something where other students lose. He is worthy of great respect, because· he is willing to make his opportunities ; and when he is graduated he has the foundations for a suc- cessful career.\ , , .. \Yes your arguments are good, but I would say that much depends on the in- dividual student. Perhaps the ave'rage stu- dent who works his way through college becomes more successful than the average student of means. One thing I notice, how- ever. A fellow who spends much of his

THE JOYS AND SORRO·WS OF THE SECTION GANG .. Pete Proposes at the Junior Prom.-Almost. No wonder Pete was about half asleep as he sat on the railing of the arched porch. just above those magic words,, '~~Gymnasium Aiumnorum.\ He had thought over many things as he leaned against one of those gracious columns which he knew and felt· belonged to him and \Pr~:xy\ and the alutnni and to all good and loyal Union men. Yes, and that wasn't all of his thoughts, for that \lazy hunk of fat,\ as he now insisted upon calling Sp,ud, had stolen from him that divine bit of femininity which he was pleased to call \his ·girl.\' Maybe he hadn't stolen her for good, but the crazy lubber had engaged her about two months ahead of time for this evend·ul night of the first Junior Prom. to be he 1d in the new \gym.\ Now the orchestra was launching forth upon the cool night air the strains of \Hon1e and Country,\ but sti'll Spud hadn't arrived. There was a pause, a lull, and as the orchestra struck up \My Raggydore'' another sound came to Pete's anxious ears -the purring sound of an a·utomobile. A \seagoing taxi\ splashed through the wet snow, drew up in front of tbe \gym\ and stopped. Spud and Mabel stepped out. She dropped something; Spud picl<:ed it up; they We have hatded ten barrels of water, We have decorated the wall, We have washed clean all the windows, laughed merrily together ancl slipped up the steps. Pete muttered some anti-Sunday- school expressions under his breath and stepped cautiously into the g-allery to watch We have renovated the hall. Ah, yes, we are sore and.weary, But we giv-e one hearty cheer And offer thanks to Prexy, ~ Junior Week comes but once a year. TAKE HEED! \A st-u de-a book. A girl-a look.

It seemed hours later when, seeing Mabel sitting alone, his eyes wan<lered over the throng to find Spud at the other end of the rootn in a hot discussion o-ver his program. Now was his chance and he obeyed the im- pulse. \Good evening, Mabel.\ \Why hello, Pete; I've been looking for you and had almost given up hoping that

''Oh 1 Pete, I've been having such a lovely time dancing with all of those grand dan- cers. 'Bill' Smudge taught me some new holds and 'Nutch' Daumann is a second Harry Pilsner; where are we going?\ \W . ·h . . \ e are entertng t e swtmmtng room. \It's awfully dark. You needn't bother about helping me so much, I'm young yet.\ They entered the room and Pete slammed the door. lt locked ; she recognized the sound. \Pete what have you done?\ \vVell I 'U tell you. In the f,irst place, Spud wouldn't give me a dance, so I lied to you and g-ot one anyway. In the second place, I've locked myself in the. pool-room with you in order to say something which none but yo·u and solitude should· hear.\ Mabel was silent, but her thoughts ran somewhat like this: \Pretty good for a freshman, 'Pence' Bage didn't start off half so well, and ''Teve' Tory wasn't .much bet- ter.\ Pete was preparing for a fresh start when he felt a fr-ightened hand clutch his arm d . h. \L. ?\ an a scared votce w tsper : 1sten. From the ()ther end of the room cautious footsteps vver-e approaching. His muscles became tense; he thrustMabel into a corner and advanced. Something tall stood in front of him. H-e could not see to the top of it through the darkness, but it must have been a giant, he thought, and as a matter of fact is was pretty big compared with Pete's five- feet-four of skinny corporeality. '\Welt?\ said a voice up near the ceiling. \'Very well, thank you ;. how are you?\ \'Y ott' re of the class of 1917 all right; how ca·m e you here ?\ '\Through the door.\ '\Do you realize whom you address?\ '\Well whoever it is, I've a mind to knock you overboard. It's either Spud, Eddie or Doctor Smack. If it's Spud, he ought to drown ; Eddie is a good swim1ner, so he'd only get wet, and if it's Doctor Smack, I should worry.\ '\Do you know that I alone may roam these darkened halls by night and breathe the refreshing essence which permeates this atlnosph.:ere? My name, sir, is James Alumnorum; I belong to the I. M. It fra- ternity, and live in the sections within hear- ing distance of Spud and Pete, the rough- neck section gang.\ He moved slightly. Pete side-stepped in the dark; he slipped; a big foot helped him along in the proper direction, and there was a decided splash in the pool, accompanied by a shriek from the corner. The supposed Mr. Alumnorum made rapid exit through the door by means of his master key, and the flood of light, which soon followed, showed the door at the other end filled with the portly dimensions of Spud, shaking with laughter. '(:Oh, Spud, I've been so frightened.\ \WelL we'll try to forget it; you've only missed one dance and the next five are mine. By the way, Pete, I suppose you're a little dan1p; ~ake that 'sea-going taxi' and go home. Be 6Ure and send it back.\ \Like \ (a glance from Mabel) \Oh sure; I'll send it back; much obliged.\ Then to himself, \Ain't it the devil to be in love?\ Pink : \Who made the first nitride?\ Dome : \Paul Revere.\

I • '' '! ',l I i I : \ i : l 30 THE CONCORDIENSIS ALUMNI INTEREST AROUSED. At a dinner given by the Alumni Asso- ciation of Rochester at Rochester on Febru- ary 2, the association decided to give a scholarship to Union 'College. This scholar- ship win be open to students from Roches- ter, and the candidates will be determined by a competitive examination. The value of the scholarship is one hundred dollars. At Buffalo the largest gathering of alumni which has been held in recent years took place on February 3rd. 'l'he increase in at- tendance was due to the large number of Buffalo men who have graduated from tion at Hobart College during December. Student precedent and favor seem to have sanctioned general drinking c-ustoms which led to disgraceful bouts and riotous cele\\ brations on the part of some, but when Dr. Lyman Powell was inaugurated as presi.- dent,. in November, he at once made clear his disapproval of this tendency and set out to eradicate it. He is genera11y credited with the December announcement that here- after no drinking student will be allowed any financial aid from the college, and the faculty are supporting ·him steadily. Re- ports state that the students are very in- dignant, since many of them are now hold- ing scholarships, and will be affected by Union in the past few years. The Philadelphia Alumni Association of Philadelphia, Pa., will hold a dinner on the new ruling. February 28. The Associations of Schenectady and of Elmira are planning to hold reunions in the near future. 1916-1917 DEBATE ASSURED. The varsity team is busy. They will de· bate against Cornell on the twentieth. Here's hoping for an audience! 1917 has accepted 1916's challenge on the commission government plan for second- class cities of New York State. Van Avery, '17, is looking after the interests of his class, and Jacobs, '16, is doing the same for his. Professor McKean has a notice on the bul- letin board explaining the general arrange- ments. Somebody is going to win ten dol- lars, for that is the prize offered for the best .individual speech. The date has not been definitely decided, but the contest will probably occur on the fourth of 'M;arch. T'his is the first underclass debate at Union, and there should be something doing. A particularly outrageous drinking cele- bration, resulting in an official pronuncia- mento striking a sharp blow at student drinking customs, was the reported situa- ,0 0 \Jake Beaver: \Why don't you crawl out of that' shrubbery?\ \Stan\ Smith : \Whadya mean,?\ \Jake\: \I mean why don't you hack off some of that facial fringe?\ \Stan\: \I just got a shave last week.'' \Jake\: \Maybe so, but it's all worn off now.\ Agitation for a gymnasiutll, capable of accommodating a great number .of men, is being carried on at Harvard. Their present gym has a capacity of 200 men a day, which, compared with the size of the equipment at other universities, is considered inade- onate. l i,

Concordiensis VOL. 37 FEBRUARY 20, 1914 TEE FUTILITY OF COLLEGE THOUGHT. ·To confront a college student with the statement that he is incapable of thinking would only produce a burst of laughter from the freshman, a smile from the so ph- omore, a scoff from the junior and a sneer from that symbol of superior learning, the senior. Every college man not only imagines that he has the right to indulge in thot1ght, but moreover believes that he has the power of thought. The collegian labors under the delusion that Fortune has bestowed upon him an abundance of those forces whic:h constitute thought. Let not the word thought, as used here, be conceived as representing the physiologi- cal process of anabolism and katabolism of the cephalic organ as expounded by Prof. Hoffman, but as original perceptions or conceptions. Let thought represent the finer and least attained workings of the brain. Just as Edgar Allen Poe in his essay, \The Poetic Principle,\ puts forth an idea of Beauty differing essentially from that of the layman, let us create a meaning of thought different from that of the ordinary mind. When a man works out a mathe- matical problem he d~es not, under our new conception of thought, think. But when he regards the existence of a blade of grass as a miracle, he thinks. The rea~ons why a college man cannot delve into the mysteries of thought may be attributed to many causes, aH of which rE- vert in a condition in common, which is the lack of data on which to base thougn:t, or in other words, the incomplete stage cf assimulation of others' thoughts. The con- servative philosophers have never said that all thought is the result of reasoning, never- theless the fact holds true. Every thought is the product of an action of induction vr deduction. Even the most sim·ple thoughts conform to logical reasoning. The thought that the sky is blue is the result of a rap1d mental analogy. It is quite easy to see why man's capacity for thought is limited if but we read those lines of Pope, which run something like this: \We can reason, but trom those things which we have.\ Sinee thought is the product of reason it becom~s quite apparent why the college man can think with but little accuracy. Not that his mental mechanism is deficient, but because he has an infirm basis for thought. He is like tile child who reasoned since a. horse is an animal which has four legs, a head and a tail, a cow must be a horse because it also has four legs, a head and a taH. The effects of incorrect thinking because of insufficient assimulation of thought may be seen on every side. The socialist raises his voice to exclaim that he bas work«l

10 THE ·CONCORDIENSIS out a means to sooial equality. We do not deny that social conditions are not their best, but we can not believe that thoughts based upon insufficient data, are acceptable. It is inconsistent w1tb the laws of logic :that a deduction can be accurately made on in- sufficient particulars. Since thought is rea- son, it is misleading to thing without con- sideration of all attendant thoughts. 'rhe average college man is incapable to think not because of any lack of mental vigor, but because of his non-possession of other peoples' thoughts. T'rees grow from trees and thoughts grow from thoughts. Were it otherwise we would have a con- tradiction of one of the fundam·ental laws of the universe. Doctor Barnes exclaims to his freshmen classes,, \You have no right to think.\ Ruskin, in \Sesame and Lillies,\ says, \You have no moral right to think.\ Consider the words .moral right. It is hard- ly possible to conceive how, much is em- budied in these two words. · Tbe functions of the college student are not to indulge in futUe attempts of thought, but to gradually, in a consistent manner, assimulate the thoughts of others. He may, however, apply the thoughts of others in various ways, but he must abstain from try- ing to pass lightly over his thought prede- cessors and arrive in the dominion of tllought without a guidance. He must know that the realm. of thought, like any other worth-while attainment, can not be reached without a stn:tggle. C. A. Lewis, '17. ALUMNI NOTES. 1911-Announcement has been made of the engagement of Miss Yula Ashley of Gl-ens Falls and Paul Fasoli of Granville. Mr. Fasoli is the present manager of the Granville Electric and Gas Company. 1911-Theodore S. Ingham and Miss Dorothy C. Duryee were married February 6th in Grac-e Church, Albany. Mr. Ingham is connected with the switchboard depart- ment of the General Electric Co1npany. He is a member of Sigma Phi and the Tiger's Eye society. WHAT DID HE MEAN? The following was heard in Dr. Chase's freshman rhetoric class: \Since the instal- lation of the gas meter, I have had one p~t in myself.\ SUNDAY CHAPEL SERVICES. The closing event of the Junior Week festivities was a short service held in the chapel at 11 o'clock Sunday morning.. Dr. Richmond addressed the gathering and made a statement which we highly endorse -that it was quite fitting that the period of gayety should close thus. He preached a short but meaty sermon, and many were the expressions of admiration which were heard after the services, from those who had never heard him speak before. This service was instituted not by the faculty, but by the students themselves, and is some- thing which may well be made a part of Junior Week in the years to come.

One night, under the silver gleam of the n1oon, just as the wanderer was taking his first steps on a long journey that would lead him to foreign countries, so1ne of them sen1piternally covered with snow, others \ warmed forever by the caresses of Father Sun, where blue eyes like a bit of clear sky or black eyes like jet, would lovingly look upon him, the Queen of the Fairies· gave him a purple purse, saying: \For each true loving kiss that feminine lips give you into this purse will drop a pearl of inestin1able value; for each sincere tear that feminine eyes shed for you a diamond of 1narvelous beauty will drop also into the parse.\ VV andering onward he went from place to place; traversed seas, visited great cities inhabited by people whose talk was strange to his ears; small towns where people as- tonished looked at him; his silhouette walked beside him in the open country, and thus he ever went onward and onward. As the journey progressed his lips received n1any warm kisses, and tears were shed as he went away, but the wanderlust urged GAL 1'HR1\E him forward as the small boat is pushed steadily by the waves toward the shore. Only an exquisite phrase was all he gave for every kiss and a vain promise for every tear. Betimes his very heart assailed him, yet his mind clung to its purpose. Blue and black eyes threatened to captivate him, yet the Mind finally ruled the Heart. :One day the wanderer pondered his sit-

, - I ,, '' i :' !I ' . i I ' 12 THE ·CONCORDIENSIS uation. His purple purse must be full of pearls and diamonds, and certain of triumph he opened it. It was empty! ''No matter,\ said he, ''if women deceive there is still one who :bas never deceived me, she who for years has :loved me and is still awaiting me at home.\ Returning his steps, he again traversed seas, countries sempi tern ally mantled with snow, and still .other lands 'ever warm, where Spring plays a:l ways like a mischie- vous child. Thus he went, until one bright morning, when the sun, like a coquettish girl, raised just half lds golden face above the horizon, the traveler stood before his native town. His sweetheart, she who from childhood's happy hours had loved and understood him, and had shared his d,1-eams, came hastily to greet him. Tears of pl:easure fell upon her cheeks and against her virgina'l bosom she lovingly pressed him. Later, when together in the nuptial al- cove, the white bridal crown slipped from her virgin forehead, tlle true 1 oving kisses she gave him were .many, and many also were the sincere tears shed by her black loving eyes. When the next dawn greeted thern, he, this time certain of his triumph, ran to open his tta veler' s bag. There was the magic purse which under tne silver gleam of the moon the Queen of the Fairies had given him. His desire was to cover with pearls and diamonds the head of his. Beloved. The day of his triumph, he thought, had finally come. Exultingly he opened it. It· was empty! S. Escalante, '16. WITH OTHER COLLEGES. R. P. I. is contemplating an interclass bowling tournament.

We rntJst co-operate if we are successful. \Leslie knows you pretty well; you have been very largely his boss up til now; you haven'i gi-v.en me much chance in affairs; but if you expect me to be your partner. I tnust have something to say. \While Leslie's in college he must learn to come up here in my tow,er room. H·e must know me as a partner in the firm. I-Ie must take an hour now and then for reflection ,and listen to me as well as to cater to you. \You say there's ti1ne enough. Surely, he'll have plenty of time to seek my com- pany when he is old and gray; but he won't find me at his side then, if he doesn't acquire a taste for my company now. Habits are formed in· college,, and he should find a tower room for himself as soon as possible. \Y au ar\e the Leslie number one, who doesn't like to be alone with himself. You lead him to be busy always, with no time for meditation. Now if he learns to come up here in my room, perhaps he may learn to love truth as it shines from a clear sky. This fireside is always comfortable to my friends ; and no matter how fierce may be the storm of life outside, here, where I am, is a safe retreat-a quiet seclusion from the busy world. \Students are too busy to get acquainted with their own inner self. Some of them might be very lonesome without other com- pany; but if a college training teaches thoughtful,ness and meditation, as wen as to provide a wealth of thought material, every fellow will like his own company. And ~orne day he will thank his Alma Mater for this gift. \Now as Leslie number one, suppose you encourage your man to come up into his tower room once in a while where we three can become better acquainted·.''

The Editorial Board of the Concordiensis wishes to take this opportunity as the very earliest possible to retract two articles which appeared in the Junior \Veek issue. The articles referred to appeared under the following headlines: \What a Farce,\ and \Different Points of View.'\ It has been the conscientious desire of every member on the board to make the Concordiensis as good a college publication as any college has, and it has ,furthermore, been their desire to make it; so far as pos- sible, a medium of student expression. In th~ articles mentioned above we now realize that we have, in our enthusiasm for the learned to cherish, so blinded ourselves as to the actual facts that we have gone far in overstepping even our own purpose. We are thoroughly convinced that we are in error and that we have misinterpreted undergraduate sentiment regarding the re- lationships of faculty and students. We al- so realize that this mistake was somewhat inopportune, and for that reason perhaps doubly serious. In fact, we see clearly that our judgment has not been based entirely upon facts and that it has, as a consequence, been more or less at fault. We hope, however, that both faculty and students will consider this fault of the board leniently, and will remember that we are continually striving to make the Concord- iensis the mouthpiece of the student body. EVAN WILLIAMS SINGS. Gives a Delightful Concert B·efore a Large Junior Week Audience. At eight-thirty o'clock Friday evening the second of the series of college musicales was given in • the college .chapeL Evan Williams, perhaps the most famous Welsh singer in America, sang a most varied and difficult,. while at the same time very beau- tiful program. Mr. Williams has a splendid full tenor voice and the audience was so pleased with his rendition of the program that he was forced to give several encores. One of these was a Welsh song, which he sang in Welsh. Later he gave '~Annie Laurie\ in response to a request for a Scotch song. Perhaps the most difficult piece on the program was \Sound an Alarm,\ which Mr. Williams sang with ·wonderful volume and great accuracy. How- ever, some of his more gentle, softer pieces were received more enthusiastically by his gt or fe: ca or be: cl nt . 1n tt pl oi g~ \' . Sl C( oJ C< . lC aJ li H 1\' F 0 S< a· cl t1 t]

THE CON:CORDIENSIS 15 :.rudience. ~'he chapel was filled with Junior Week guests and the concert can well ·be called one of the most pleasing features of the festivities. The next and last of the series of musi- cales will be given by Madam Anna Gluck on March 27th. This recital will probably be held in the gymnasium, rather than the chapel, in order to accommodate the large number who will attend. That student total abstinence societies are alive and aggressive in nearly every Euro- pean university, that student and faculty sentiment is slowly turning against alcohol and promising to revolutionize foreign uni- versity life, and that this movement is be- ing favorably recognized and supported by the great foreign universities will be sur- prising news to many Americans, in view of the wide-spread impression that Europe generally is liquor-soaked and absolutely in1pervious to temperance sentiment. But recent reports show remarkable develop- ments along this line. In his late book on \The Anti-Alcohol Movement in Europe,\ Mr. Ernest Gordon states that the Univer- sity of Utrecht gives in its winter semester courses on \Criminality and Alcohol,\ and \Ethics and Alcohol\; that the University of Giessen has also given alcohological courses by professors in medicine, econom- ics and ethics; and that similar beginnings are reported from the Universities of Ber- lin, Bonn, Strassburg, Vienna, Tuebingen, Heidelberg, W urzburg, Kiel, Helsingfors. 1\1unich, Prague, Basel, Goettingen, Berne, Freiberg, Lemberg, Geneva, etc. Thousands of students are enrolled in total abstinence societies that are not only striving to do a'vay with student drinking, but also to change public sentiment with regard to the nse of alcohol. In Sweden and Finland these student societies conduct anti-alcohol lecture courses and study classes a~mong public school children with government backing and popular support ( 400 lectures by students being given in Stockholm alone in one wint,er) ; in Poland, they conduct miners' temperance institutes; in Germany, they lecture on university extension courses and in labor union meetings; in Switzer- land they operate traveling anti-alcoholic libraries, give temperance plays and festi- vals, distribute literature and conduct tem- perance restaurants. But the main object of these societies is to discourage student drinking and their chief efforts are directed in this direction. Personal conferences, ,, poster displays, lecture series, distribution of temperance literature, torganization of volunteer and credit study classes, temper- ance plays, press clubs, alcohol-free restau- rants : these are a few of the weapons these progressive students are using to lead their fellows and wipe out college drinking. All these organizations, together with the Intercollegiate Prohibition Association of America, are members of the Interna- tional Bureau of Abstaining Students, with headquarters at Zurich, Switzerland, which is working hard toward a world-wide stu- dents' temperance organization. FAITH CURES. The regular meeting of · the Classical Club was held February lOth at the Theta Lambda Phi house. The program consisted of discussions of ancient and modern \Faith Cures\ by Messrs. Loomis and Truax. Professor Bennett then spoke for some mon1ents on the subject, giving ad- ditional views and facts. It is planned to hold the meetings at the various fraternity houses hereafter, instead of in Washburn Flail. Highballs can't talk, but they will tell on a man.

The Junior Week festivities took thre€ days away fl.1om work last week and made it impossi·ble for us to gather any material for this issue tiU Monday and Tuesday. On this account we thought it wise to issue the paper on Friday rather than rush it through on Thursday and have it poorly edited. 'Thus our deia.y. COLGATE GAME P·OSTPONED. The basketball game with Colgate, sched- uled for [ast Saturday evening, was n.o1 played, for the Colgate team failed to ap- pear. The heavy snowstorm so completely tied up traffit that they were unable to reach Schenectady. .The game must be played, since it is a league game. Arrange- ments are being made to play it some time in the near future. Harry W.

:: .. I T'HE. :c·o,NCORDIENSIS 1'7 CORNELL DEBATERS READY~ tfomorrow night our debating team will meet the Cornell team in the college ~chapel. 1\~·he subject for debate will be: \Resolved: That the states should adopt the prin<:iple of the minimum wage for women and ~chil­ dren employed in stores, shops, factories, by public service corporations, and by the state itself.\ The team which has been chosen to uphold Union's side of the argu- ment is composed of Jacobs, '16, Blodgett, ·rs, and Coulter, '15, with Sternfield, 'i6, as alternate. The debate will doubtless be a hard-fought one for Union has won two out of the three debates with Cornel:l and the I thacians are ·comirug ,-determined to make it a fifty-fifty break on the series. 'I'wo members of the visitors' tearn are Schenectady men, and that will insu:re a Cornell sentiment in the chapel, which we must overcome. There is only one way, and that is by every student who possibly can, attending the debate. You should do it for the team's sake, for Professor McKean's sake, and, most of all, for union's sake. Won't you? ICHABOD SPENCER LECTURE. The first of the series of lectures under the Ichabod Spencer foundation for this year was given by Dr. Dewey of Columbia, in the chapel, Monday, February 16th. The general subject for the four lectures in the course is, \The Psychology of Social Be- havior.\ Professor Dewey outlined the background for his series of 1ectures, and spoke of original tendencies and their ef- fects upon social behavior. Special refer- ence was made to Professor Thorndyke of Columbia, who lectured here last year on original tendencies. Professor Dewey brought up the subject of attention, main- taining that it consists of many varied hair trigger responses which may be relea~ed on the least excitation, rather than a few highly specialized tendencies, as some think. Also a consideration of moti-ves was taken up with special reference to their eHect up0n the social behavior of the individual and group. All effort to i11 Huence oth-ers de- pends upon an insight .~nto the motives of those persons. These motives must be con- sidered ·collectively as ',influencing .. man\s life. He applied these collective motives to man's whole character, and to races of men in general. Tl1e subject for T'uesday night's lecture will be a consideration of the social method by which minds are form·ed under social in- 1 fluence out of the stock of original raw ma- teriaL' \Hello speaking.
