It is almost impossible to conceive of \\'ordsvvorth handling such a subject. If he had so chosen we would have found this rich-hued picture transformed in-- to a dull-toned wood-cut of \\.' ordsworth's own time. The Beadsman's breath, which \Like pious incense from a censor ~d . Seemed taking flight for heaven,\ would have become merely a steaming vapor in \\\ ordsworth 's verse. The w.onderful banquet mentioned earlier wouid haYe been humpish, indigestible rich food. \Ve undoubtedly would have found some philosophical discus- sion of the propriety of the love between Porphyso and Madeline, or on Io,-e's being a blessing from the infinite father. Scott would have treated this poem still differently. The histor- ical element would have interested him. The warfare between the two cslans, hinted at in one para- graph by Keats, would have given Scott the mate·rial for a whole canto. The dangers which the lover encountered in entering the castle would have been the sub- ject of a most exciting narrative. Scott\would not have been content to let the lovers fade away into the nig:ht. He would have carried them through their flight and es- tablished them, in the good old story book fashion. Had Scott chosen this plot we might have had another tale which could be classed with Marmion or the Lady of the Lake. Or he might merely have made a ballad like \Lochin- var.\ Keats misses the opportunity to use the superstition of St. Agnes Eve for more than an excuse for his story. Coleridge would never have done this. \Vith this much of the supernatural, he would have woven a tale which would have vied with Cristabel. How Byron could have used this tale to poke fun at conventional society! In his hands the simple tale of pure love could have been something vastly different. \V e would not have had a soft dream- like vision, would have had some- thing Byronic, something flashy and brilliant. How he could have intermingled beautiful sentiments with scathing jests in telling this tale, even as we see him doing in \Donfuan\! Shelley's treatment would have depended on his state • of mind. J n the picture of the guarded tower he could have registered a hitter protest against the strife and r<:>straint of society. On the other hand, he might have ap- proachc>d Keats' own treatment of the subject. In the latter eYent the picture would have heen more systematic. \Vhile the pictures would have been as beautiful there THE Turkish Cigarette That Murads are Better than many cigarettes 25 cent . lS NOT a mere claim . ••• ••• ••• ••• ••• Murads ARE better-because better 1 higher-priced tobacco goes into lV1urads. •••• ••••• •••• Ill • •• Ill Much of the tobacco used in many 25 CENT cigarettes could never get into the Murad brand.

The banquet was held at Delmonico's in New York City. Following is an extract from his speech : \The conflict with the wild- erness begun by our first set- tlers from the bleak rocks of New :England, through the dense tracks of forest and across the interminable prairies and the precipitous mountains of the west, to the arctic severities of Alaska, has been unceasing. The conquering of this vast territory has been an achieve- ment worthy to be sung by some great poet who can im- mortalize the deeds of heroes. \But this has not been the greatest achievement of this country. The most marvelous thing- we have done in this Re- public is the making of a na- tion, and the greatest problem we have had to face has been not the conquering of the sav- ag-e forces of nature but the overcoming of the natural an- tag-onisms, the jealousies and hatreds, the inherited antipath- ies of different races-antip- athies inherent in their very blood. The overcoming of all these and the welding and amal- gamation of these stubborn ele- ments into one so that they should constitute one nation- ality and acknowledge one flag, I say this is the greatest achievement of this republic. \The problem has not yet been solved but when we con- sider its almost superhuman difficulties the wonder of it is, not that we have failed to solve it completely, but that we have been able to solve it as well as we have. \We have not solved it. It will take years, perhaps genera- tions. But it will be done, if it is don~, in only one way: 'Not by an appeal to the belly,' as the Colonel says, 'but by an ap- peal to the soul ;' not by a mo- tive of a common interest in a !?Teat reward but by a motive of common devotion to a great idP~l. art seems a very hard task to g-et into the minds of men tl-t;:1t co-operation is the only hasis of prosper1ty or security. ball on t_he ice-cold sidewalks of end of his joui~ney.
