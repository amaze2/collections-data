THE CoNcORDIENSIS VOL. XXXIII UNION COLLEGE, .APRIL 6, 1910 No. 2.2 BASEBALL PROSPECTS. which is nece·ssary to put it in shaJpe for the hard schedule whic:h is soon to start. The dia· A Good Team Expected. mond will soon be ready to play on and then At this time it is rather risky to make any good hard ~ractice will set in and w'hich at the definite statements regarding the basebal~ team sa:;ne time will prove more interesting to every and its prospects. It perila:p.s would not he wise one, th.an the J)relhninary work so far done and to do so for .some reasons, not the least of which is, raising the hopes o:f the students to a higr1 pitch only to see the1n shattered lateT on as sucl'\' might possibly 1be the cas-e. A ro.mparison ot candidates so far as known at this ti:;ne with those of other ye,ars seems to indicate a strong team for Union this Srpring. It :s true that of t'he old players there are very fe'W who are loft or are available-,L,adue, Dunn, M1ckey and ,StP.w- art. The Freshman class has much prornising material in iL; in fact, more· men of abil!ty in this line than has been the case for some yean' past. The men froa1 the Albany departments, no doutbt, will be a big factor and a great help to t:he team this year. It ~s noticeable, alsc-, that the number is larger and the ability g-reater ·i:'han see1ns to have been the case for some time pa~t. 111 addition, there are some men in the Sopho- more class who, while perhaps not up to the mark last year, are giving a good ac~ount of the:;nselves and it would n-ot be .surprising if on: or more of these 1nen were found an1ong the regulars at the end of the season. It is pleasi.ng to note t'hat one thing wh!ch has been very destructive to the mak~-up of a suc- cessful team for some time past is absent and that is lack of competiton for the different ro3i tion'S. For instance there are four or five candl· dates who are catchers, pitchers and first h1.se men, respectively, to say nothing ·Of the other p::;3i t ons. Coach. Bergen in reviewing the pro3}Je~L­ i ye players recently flaid: \It will bP- so1ne task to pick the :;nen ·W:ho will represent us for the first fe1w games ·at least.\ It is urged that all me w'ho play ball at all, come out and stay out, at least for these first few weeks. It is oRly by having a .good scru? cut at all times that a. team can get the training under such adverse conditions. It is plan.ned to have a Union second tea:;:n w:th a view to giving candidates n1ore encour- agement to stay out anil besides to furnish a first class scrub foOT' the 'Varsity at all times. If this idea is carried out a schedule will be ar- ranged including both horne and out of town games. The material is such that a very credit- able second team. can 1be formed and one that ·will 'be wort'hy of being so called. This idea has been talked up a great deal and it is t~·nped a second team will result w·hich will appeal to all ca.ndid·ates and be worthy of the support of the Etudent body. · In regard to the Albany men it is hoped Lhat the fellows will get to know the:;:n and will mal\:e it interesVng for then1 to come ove-r here and play. It is dlfficuH for the 1nen to como ov ~r here and we should give them as much· enrmH- agement as po.ssible and in this way further the- feeling between the Colleg-e and Albany devart ments. These n1en are 1naking a big sacrific1~ in giving up .so 1nuch of their time and we should do all we can to help them. It is all for the team. and the glory of Old Union. COBURN PLAYERS HERE ON MAY 31. Arrange.ments have been made with the Cobnrn players for two outdoor performances o[ Sh:1kes· peare on the college grounds on t11e afternoon 2nd evening .of May 31. T•he plays· are to he given under the auspices of the ,Englis~ depart- Jnent. This summer the Coburn players intend to give several of the con1ed.ies of Shakespeare, the Canterbury PH~rin1st by. P~_rcy Ma.ckaye, and the Elektra of Sop];locles, and the selection of

THE OONCOHDIENS18 plays for the performance here will be made fron UNION CO·LLrEG·E CH'RI'STIAN A.S1S·OC:IAT'ION. thi.s listM During the past se.ai;on the Cnburn playex,s have given their open air ,productions. at Harv.ai··d University, Yale University, Oolum1bia University,. Radcliffe College, Bryn M.awr, Smith CoUe!;e, Brown Universrity and Barnard College. WhiTe their prod11:·ctions, owing to a decided .education_al value, appe·al in a special manne~ to coll~g~e students, they are by no means ·confined to tllat clasa, ·bu.t are also cal·culated to dhtarm tbe theater-goer who n1:erely seeks amusement. J,ll the open a~r the characters take on a new im- portance and seem to be living, rather ttan act- ing their parts. 'The singing by a quartet. of . men's voices t'l> furnish the incidental music instead <>f an or- che2tra is another feature that tends to add t() the unartificial atmosp·here of tlle perfor:;.nances_ ' . It was only after 1ong and assiduous resear-d'l that the songs sung by the choristers were f01unl and arranged. T'he cast for the performance has been selected w~th stpecial care from actors wllo are Shakespearean ent·husiasts and who add tl~e result. of much s.tudy to their art, ;naking a co.:rn:- vany of 'Players of unusual ability.

In. looking back over the work of ~he as.socia,. tion :during the past year the President desire~ es,pecially to render t1tan•k:ful acknowledgernent for the staunch support of the members of the cabinet. Where we have sueceeded, we have succeeded together. Where we have failed. we have failed together, but where 'tjb·ere has been failure it ha.s been .mainly the fault of the Presi- dent, be·c.ause he ha.s not made the 'best use of the faithful aliies around him. To certain of the members of the oabinet the President is so deeply indebted that they can never know 'bow n1uch he apprecta.tes the encouragement and the help that they have given him. We feel that we have been able to accomplish somet.!hing for the upholding· of that which we consider the highest and be.st in college Hfe. Yet w·e are conscious of many failures and neg- lected opportunities. May we not, howover, with some feeling of satisfaction, but at tb e same time in a stpirit of hnmJbleness take .some con- si.deration of the thin?;s that through cur feeble agencies have been somewhat instrumental in strengthening the spirit of Christ in our college? During tlhe year we have tried to have tbe strongest po.ssi,ble men to speak at our Sunday ·ve·s•pers on subjects that would be helpful to t:'H~ best life of the college, such men as Dr. Alex- ander and William J. s~chi.effelin of ~ew York, Ron. 'Thomas M. Os1borne of Auburn, and Dr. Rockwell H. Potter of Hartford. We have been. grati:fied to note that the attendance at the Ves- ver services has more than doubled during the year. Ye~t we feel that there is a grectt oppor- tunity for development in this line, as increased funds may mak~ it pos.si.l)le to secure more of tlh'e ablest outside ~speakers. In the department of Bible .study we have seen increoased interest. The regular attendanc·3 at the Bible study cl1asse.s S'hows a decided gain over previous years. Yet we have become con- \\inced that Bible study can not mean what it should at Union until we -can have the group plan that is meaning so much to the s1piritnal Jife of many other colleges. From the standpoint of the missionary c-om- mittee it is impossible to make a fair estimate now, for tlhe class in foreign 1nission;;! ~Yill not

Pte·sidents from about fifty colleges and universities in the East- ern states. 1The number of delegates who wHl be @resent at the conference is exiJe-ct~d to be about sixty or seventy. L.as~t year thi:s conve.nM(i)n w1as held at Harvard Unive·rsity and we tt.dnrk that it is a grerat privilege botri. for th.e Y. rl\1. 0. A. and the Oolle·ge to be allowed to have this ga.the.r~ · ing of men at our institution. It certainly wH 1 m·ean a great deal to the work of th·e Chrl.stian As:sociation for the Rext · year -and we hope ta·~ t the fellows will enter into the Sipirit of the con- ference and secure much benefit fron the mc,~t­ ings. The men will be entertaind largely on the Hill by t'he fraternitiers who have kindly consent- ed to help in that way'. We :;.nust ·do our best to make these men see tb.at our college ·in e\rp-ry way is one of the be,st 'fn the ·country and we can do that in many 1w•ays. Show them how -we can su,pprOrt the activities of the Associ :ttion and in that way as well as in many others they 'vH1 receive a good 'impression of our college and onr student .body. The results are for l:>oth t'he Y. M. C. A. and the college. ' FRESHM.AN The Fres.hman have already 1Je- BASEB,A,LL gun to come out for baseball hat aa yet only a few have answerul the call. It is necessary that all who pos3ibb can, come out at once. The schedule already in- cludes many rather hard~r game's and a good sq;rad will 'be needed out daily in order t() d~velor) a good strong team. It will be of great help to t)le college if fhe freshman team can win a. rnajority of the games on its .schedule but. tbis will be 1nade ·possilble only if tlle men get out early a.nd pra·ctice re·gularly. Show your class spirit a11d your college spirit by getting into the game at once and in that way be of help to yours,~lf and the college.

THE CONCORDIENSI.S VOL. XXXIII ··,UNION COLLEGE, APRIL 13·, 1910 No. 23 IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CAMPUS. Dr. Richmond's Suggestions .. Along with the new S'pirit and new buildings at Union come :;.nany ne-w plans and ideas for· the im.pr.o-vement of the gTounds. The improvements a:re made possible by the generos~ty of s·orne dtizens of Schenectady, who are subscribing a sum of money for this .pwrpose. Dr. Richmond is personally overseeing ~the work of i::.nproving the grounds and is plac.tng C.xe money that is at his d' spo sal, where it \\\r\i1i be used to the best ad- vantage. Many of the improvements will be com- rleted by commencement week and furtrier work along this line will continue until the ca·mpus . presents a nearly flawless ap.pea~rance. Perhaps the most striking i~provement will be the new fence that will extend from the Pu'blic Library to Library La.ne. This will be in ·place by June. 'The ·fence will consist of paneLs of p:lain ~ron pickets abo-ut seven feet high. These . . will be broken at iRtervals of 25 feet by cement posts wH:h stucco fin.ish. The posts will be about eigr::. t feet in height. ·The Blue Gate is to cnme in for its share of renovation, but it is not to undergo the marked changed that many have thought. The gate will remain unchangEd ~ith the exception of replac- ing the wooden secf.ons with wrougiht iron. The Payne Memorial gate i,s to be placed at the en- trance of Li,brary Lane. In time it is hoped that the fence, of ~htch these gates are a part, wiLl be extended along the Union Avenue side of the cam.pus. A ... novement is ·Oil foot to remove the telephone poles that now are on the campus and other unsightly objects are being done away wit;h. The trees mbout the ca.rnpus a,re being trilnmed and the dead branchea and in S·ome cases dead trees are being removed. ,)Jumerous chang;es in fhe road -on the ca ... 11pus are being plann€d, some of which are already noticeable. Dr. Richmond proposes to close the road that now passes South ·Oollege and- in- tends to ::have grass there as: well as between the athletic ·fields: Carriages and automobiles W·ill uae the Library Lar.te almost entirely in the future. The road that passes the chapel will be m·oved about twenty feet farther from the building in order to do away with much of the noise of pass ·ng vehicles. A number of foot- 1Jaths a~re in the process -of construction about the campus w 1 hich will put an end to J.nuch uf 1 the c111tting across the grass that is now done so much by the ·students. Dr. Richn~ond asks that the students take a person·al interest in the appearance of the campus and es.];ecially the members of the several fr&.· ternities that have houses on the campus to guard aga.inst unnecessary abuse of the grounds . HIGH SCHOOL DIAMOND f,N PASTURE. Last week the Schenec·L.ady High School were given pennission by ''Prexy\ to use a part of the Pasture for a baseball dia1nond. This will fill a long-felt need of the H;gll S.cho-ol students, who hitherto have always used the College dia- mond vvhen the College team was not phtying on it. .Tust what pa1rt of the Pastnre will be made use of is not yet detenni ned. Very likely ihe uiamond will be placed near Sevvard Place, oppo- site .South College. The grade schools are also to have t1le use of a .fteld in the Pasture for athletic 1)Urposes. COR·NELL UNIVERSI1\Y MEDICAL COLLEGE. A College degree is required for ad·missjon. Ad- vanced standing granted students presenting sat- isfactory credentials from accredited medical col- leges. Every facility ia offe•red to undergradu- ates se·eking the degree of Do·ctor of Medicine. Ample facilities are also offered qualified gradu- ates to pursue or~ginal investigation in any de- partment. •For further particulars apply to the Dean, Cor- nell University Medical College, First Avenue and 28th Street, New York city. )

IV'J,a,tters D·iscussed. ,.At a meeting of the Athietic Board held Mon- day, April 11, definite s.te;ps were taken regarding- our :relations with tae N. y·, S. I. A. U. The mo- tioR was carried to withdrruw from the Union in an branches of athletics and this motion will l'1e recommended to the student body next Mon- day morning for ratificat· on. If t;he .students act fav-orably upon the matter, our resignation will be formally presented at tihe semi-annual meet- ing of the Union next .faU, this being the first opportunity. Consequently, we will continue to b-e ~ne:mb·ers througtout the !remaining college year and will be 1bound by its ~rules during this per· od. T·b.is is a que.stion which has received serious consideration from the Atl1l:etic Board and was not acUon of a single night. It is, therefore, re·quested that the students treat t:he matter in th€ same light and g·ve it considera1ble thought before acting on it next M-onday morning. Rea- sons for the contemplated withdrwwal would ex- tend this notice beyord the columns of the Con- cordjensis, so they wHl be left for open discus- sion at college meeting. T11Js is a matter of in- terest to all and every/body 8hould be out at that time. It ·was furt'her decided last Monday even~ng ~t t!he regular business :;::neeting two weeks ago the club adopted a constita tion, several reports were read and plalils discussed fe~r the coming season. A very active eampai.gn has been, planned for the coming seas-on and the dub ex- peCits to lb-e .able to render a very good aecount of itself by t 1 lle close of the college year. A permanent rela t~onship has been estahUshed between tt.e -club and a number of -very im.portant pape-rs, good results should therefore be ob- tained. ----\'--- --'-\'\ -- !N,EW EVA.PORATING LAB,RATORY. :During the past few weeks there ibas been an almo.st co-mplete re:modelin.g of the old barn be- hind the che;nical lahratory. The ro-of has been repaired and new doors and windows placed in tbis building. Gas and water pipes are to be run into it and new desks and lockers installed. Part of the building i.s to be 1:1sed for the storage of the add carboys and the remainder is to be used as an evaporating ro.om. Previous to this time the fumes escaping firom the open desks and inadequate lhood.s have made it very disagree- ablie for ._persons working in the labratory. Now, however, the evaporating will be d-one, beg'n- ning with next term, in this new labratory. A covered passageway will pTobahly be built to con- nect the two buildings. This improvement snould to a great extent ~remedy the present conditions. to allow the base ball management to iss·ue a season ticket. There wiU be ·2i ght home games and these tickets will be sold for $3.00 a piece, good for one admission to each ·Of any of the home games. This is a saving of one dollar on the s€ason to the purcihaser and Manager HJyde is prepa•ring for an unusually large .sale. ------- PRES'S CLUB. 'The hone.st efforts of the club have, after a ~year of hard work, co::ne to tlie notice of the trustees, and tihey, after much deliberation, have finally made an appropriation of one hundred dollars to be used to help cover the expense of t~1e spring campa~gn of the club. Within a very few weel{s the club e:x1)ects to be installed in its new qua,rter.s, the old instrument room in Washburn Hall. The room is to be fitted up to meet tlle needs of the <1Iub, the old :fireplace is SUBJECTS FOR PRfZE ESSAYS. ·The subjects wh ~ch have .been chosen for the Inghan1 prize essay are: William E.

Dr. Mac spoke concerning the track situation, saying it is now not aB brigl)lt as was expected as :;nany uf the track men are back in their studies. lie believes no one is ·satisfied with the athletics at college. This :s due to several reasons. 'The1re is not ~enough available n1aterial I and son1e good material is lost or unknown. The loss of much material has been due to ''sticks,\ the fellows not seeming to take the proper interest. Also many of the men do not get the proper train:lng or at least do not do the am.ount of training that is necessary. Dr. Mac said t'he tracl{ team will not give up but w:ll do its best, yet if new :;:nate•rial is not olbtained he fears the resultb of most of the meets will not tbe favora.ble. He also urged some men to try out for the hammer t~hrow. or for the shot-put, claiming that the size of a man n1akes little difference. A similar can was ;nade for hroad-jum.:pers. Doe Mac also n•rged tLat each claas get its material in shape at once for tile inter-class 1neets which take place on the 9·oh and 11th of May. By so doing there \Vould be a possilbility of gain!ng Varsity maLerial. He claimed that the .situation was the saa1e for baseball as for ot-her sports. He remarked that several of the fellows were brealdng train-Ing at· ti:dles and asked that this be stopped. In con- cluaion he said that the fellows shou. 1 d not only l\eep up tihe Uni{)n S})irit but shon~d make it stronger. Hntch:ns led a long oheer for Ber:::·en. Be•rgen said he wouldn't prophesy about the coming sea- son 'but would see what he oould do with the material at his disposal. He made the old com- plaint that not enough :men are out. He said that :he c-ouldn't rely on men fro1n Albany and unless the fellows showed n1ore interest he would be in a ·bad position. Tom.my said that fellows virho ·were stuck and didn't stand a chance of makng the team should come out anyway to form a second team which should help the Varsity. He asked tfie fellows not to speak to nhe playetfs during practice as it greatly hindered his coach- in'?,\ work. He r;referred that they sit on the .. bleachers and cheer for the team at intervals. J:n regard to the We.st Point ga::ue he said that Unilon h:as always made a good showing .against West Point and that the team would try to do tJhe sa:me tilis year. He added that if so1ne of the students should go along with the team it would do much good. Be,rgen expects to win the game with Pratt, •but as Pratt will have a number o.f ro-oters at the game he asked that a campus :;neeting be held Friday, night to get the fellows in good spirit for the con test. Ferguson ·broug:ht before the students a recom- mendation of tihe Athletic Board to the effect that the baseball jersey be grey instead of garnet. 'This suggestion was ratified by the student body. .PDtte:r announced that all the fellows had not yet paid their tennis tax and asked thmn to do so th~s week. ,Faust said a few words in regard to the Y. ·lVL C. A. convention. He assured the fellows that they were well paid for entertaining the dele- gates at the fraternity houses, for all the visitors greatly appreciated it and it help.ed to advertise the college in the right way. Hyde announced that the baseball game with ~. Y. U. had been changed to April 28, the day of the opening of the new engineering building. Baker told the fellows of a book which bad. been written abont Union College bY a. member of the class of 1856. T!he book is now being sold for a dollar and the proceeds are to go towards tlie gy~nn fund.

Another matter which has not tended to ·make the pa1per any 'better is the fact that so few men from. t'he freshmen class have been working for the 'board. It is ne-cessary for the students, wbo care to do work on tJhe paper, to begin in their freshmen year, for in that way only will they learn the methods. We wish to thank all those who have belped us in our work the .past year, especially some mem.bers of the faculty who bave taken particular interest in t:he pape:r. 1\iow, as the new board begins its work, we hope that they will receive the proper support and encouragement from the students.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXIIL UNION ~COLLEGE, APRIL 21, 1910 No. 24 BASEBALL. Pratt Institute 5, Union 3. West Point 8~ Uni'On 1. In the first hom·e game of the year, Pratt d ~­ feated Union by the score of five to three. Pratt~ vic tory was won. by their excellent work in. tr1e field, their infield being a.n. especially stron~ a11 i fast one. Union'·s work wa~ rather ragged, but shows many signs of improving .later, when the nen will play a less individual game, and dis]_Jlay more team work. The fielding was very good, ta.k.ing the amount of vracti.ce 1nto consideration.. 'l'lle batting, however, appears to be cons1dera bly be· low the mark. Ste-wart :p:itched a gooc g.amc, al· though at first be was \Very wild. He s-ceadie1 down, however, ancl did fine work un\i:Jl the eighth inning, when Pratt touched him up for three run•:<. Hutchens' work behind the bat was fairly goocl, though he seemed to fi1-1d trou·ble in throwing down to second. At the bat, however, his worK was exctllent, two long hits going to his credit. Connors at first base played a star ga1n.e, Do~n at bat and in the field. His stealinE: second base and thEn ·coming hom.e with the first run for Union in the seventh inning was th·e t'2a~nre of the game. Our old friend, Weaver~ '11, hact j\~st started to wind U]_J when \Paddy\ started ror third. He was already rounding third wh\~n Wea- ver delivered the ball. The catcher th€n muffed it and \Paddy\ crossed the plate, thus< tying the s·core. O'Keefe at eenterft.eld did very good wol'l~, cutting off a run for Pratt by a sensatinllal catc~L The work of the rest of the team was good on the whole. Things looked Tather gloomy at the start, for Pratt reached third base in both tlTe firsl and sec· ond innings, while Un1on went out one, tVvu, three. Union's errors in the fifth inning gave Pratt one run. 111 the lucky seventh Union crossed the plate three times. Pratt came b~ek in the eJghth with three runs, obtained by two errors, and a couple of thnely hits. They increased their lead bY one more in the ninth. Tbe G arn·et tried hard to score in the last two innings, but were shut out. Weaver pitche.d a good g.ame for Pratt an(l was aided by a number of lucky bounds wb.icll cut off several possible hits.

Union met defeat in the first game of the se'1- son at West Point on April 13. The score was 8 to 1. Many of Union's players were varsity men for the first tilne and consequently sn.owect their lack of experience. The men from th ~ Albany departments had had little practice with the team and taking all into consideration ti18 Garnet nine made a good showing.

' '' , I 'j I ! 6 'fHE OONCORDIENSIS THE BO L TMETER. Remarkable J·nventio•n by s.tudent at Union. An invention, that is expecte-d to surpass. ttre most ·sanguine expectations, has recently been perfected by a student in the electri·ca.l 'engineer~ ing cmarse at Union. The inventor, individual, wishes his name withheid success of the appliance is assured. a :mode~t until .t.hf! The in- vention is caUed .a Boltmeter and has been de- signed to meet the needs of students at Union in partiC1alar, in that it will enable them to dis- cover the number of bolts that they are to have a,ccre·dited to them in any subject. 'l'be m.echan- ism of the bo~tmeter is remarkably ~1mple and it has heen so eompactly built that it w111 fota to fit the change po·cket in the trousers, or can be concealed in the bowl of a pipe or even a stamp box. The principal of the boltmeter has not yet heen made public, as there are patents pending that require secrecy until they are granL- ed. However, a general description and sue·· @inct statement of the us·es of the boltmeter has been given a representative of the Concordien·sis for publication. The boltmeter is an electrical contrivanc·t bY which a student may ascertain the number ot bolts, not that he has had, but the number ot bolts that the professor is going to -charge u~J against hi-m in any subject, but all unbeknown to th·e professor hilnself. The mechanism of the boltmeter is enclosed within a collapsable meta I case. To two ·sn1a1l binding posts are atta·ched a 1)air of invisible wires. On the top of th~ metal case of the bol tmeter is found a boltom·et2r whieh registers tne number of bolts as learned from the professor, as in the followin~ manne1'. Wlhen a student wishes to learn the number of bolts that he has against him in a Si.lbject, he approaches the profe·ssor in the usual Wfty, but having the bolt:rneter ·concealed in hi~ band or pocket. By skillful manipulation of a levtr on the meter ·case the two invisible wires will uncon from their position about the binding posts, anu when the student is within two and one-half feet of the professor they will fasten themselves about the pedal extremities of the said profes·sor. The principal of the attach1nent of the wires is nn important part of the invention. On tke tre~ - ends of the wit:es is a thin coating of ·\attracti~ lite,\ a metal that is founded upon a principal similar, in some respects, to the principal of the m:agnet. TheS'a wire tips mo·ve in a direction that is at right angles from the meter case,, toward an~ other ni·etal, such a·s the lace riJags on shoes or the metal parts of the Boston garter. If the directions have :been carefully folloWed, ihe meter will .a·ct immediately by exerting a slight pull upon the right leg of the professor. Note-If there has been son1e error In: t~te manipulation of the boltrrreter it may :pull tile wrong leg and the desired results wili not be forthGmning. Wlhen the bolilneter is handled ·correctly it takes but a minute t~ get results. The invisible wires trans;mit the unexprHssed thougbts of the professor and record them upon the boltometer. For instance, the students will approach the pro- fessor and then proceed to relate several hard- luck stories of sickness, accidents, etc., and the boltmeter dues the rest. Occasionally drop the eye upon the boltometer and if it registers higher than desired pGstpone the OIJeration until a more favorable tin1e. The boltJnet er is made in several stoles, vary· ing in strength as well as il\1. design. H one ot the weaker boltmeters refuses to bring the G9- sired results it will he replaced by one of greatel' strength. The inventor claims that thr boltmet~r will operate as successfully with tutes as profes- sors. It is thought that the student will find th~ invention indisiJensable, especially when desirou q of learning the number of chapel bolt's from Dr. Mac. A public demonstration of the possibili- ties of the boltmeter wili be given in Roo1n 3 ot Washburn in the near fnture. (Note-A special design of the boltn1eter has b-een made for use in dealing with \ba wlts.\) A BOOK REVIEW.

G.RE ETI·NG FROM. The curtain rises on a new The N E.W BOARD scene. 'rhe class of 1910 has laid 'down the responsibility of ·~diting ''The Concordy.'' Their mantle has fallen upon the ·shoulders of 1911. ,As we stand upon the threshold of another year in the man· agement of this paper, the new Board glad~y· takes this opportunity to explain definit~ly the position which it purposes to maintain. We intend that \The Concordy\ shall be fund a· mentally all that the title page iinpnt:s-\A Llt· erary and News Weekly Published by the Stn- dents of Union University.\ Goncordy\ must be: Therefore .. ;l'he ' Fii'st-\Literary.\ We shall strive to make it possible to print in these columns more original, literary material of real interest. To tl;lis end we ask for the cordial co-operation of all students who may have budding or latent literary anilitY. Second-.\Newsy.\ 'rhis is, pre-em.inently, a. ·college newspaper. We shall, therefore, aim ~o present in a clear-cut, unbia·sed way all live col- lege news. Again we ask your co-operation, tor if we are to print all the news all the time, all the students mt~st feel concerned to see t.•:at news items, whi·ch might be unnoticen re:ach tlle. editor's attention. Third-\Weekly.\ . Owing to a variety ot cir- cun1stances, \The .Concordy\ bas not always been publishe-d every week. Presen·~ financial diffic:Ji- ties may prevent an is·sue each waek this sprin~, but hereafter it shall be our constan~ endeaVL\r to have our pape1· as regular in its appearance as \The Outlook\ or \Life.\ Therefore, again we need your co-operation-in this instar-1c~, tinanciD._I support. Fourth--\Edited by thE.· Students.\ V\Te slla l.l make it our ambition to have \The Uoncordy'· really a student pubHcation. This must !:.1vo1ve two things. On the one hand, it mean3, again, co-operation on the part of the student body. TJ1 ·~ idea that all material should be contributed '-iY half a dozen men on the staff is illogical, if tl1is paper is to be in a real sens~ the organ or student opinion. On the other hand, it mean;, that we shall present current college sentiment and thought. To do this, the ·editor will try :.o use good com111on sense in praising that whicll

UNION COLLEGE i.\BR~\t·t_ 'i'HE CONOOI~DIENSlS n '@;} i·s praiseworthy and in eensuring that which is blamable. 1 FinallY: Criticize-· but ''Don't Knoclr!\' \Don't Knock\ has been our slogan in athletics. It ap· -plies equally well to \The Goncordy.\ No good ever came from mere knocking, but we welcon1e friendly critieism, unpleasant though it be. Fur- ther, come frankly to the editor Wlth your criti- . cisms in:stead of \knocking on the side-lines.\ Re· member, we need friendly criticism b1:1t-. \Don't Knock,\ please. Just a closing word. The e·ditor realizes that he holds this offi;ce in trust for th·e ·student body, and he shall try to see that the whole start merits ·the confidence that shall stand unequivo cally for true 1uyalty to the best interests or Union. ---------- UNliON and The action. that, was taken in N'. Y. S. I. A. w. College meeting Monday, when the student body by a unanimous vote decided to a,ccept th'e recommendation ot the Athletic Board that Union withdraw uncondi- tionallY from the New York State Intercollegiate Athletic Unton, was certainly an important step. The reasons that w·ere .o-ffered by me1nbers ot the Athletic Board were convincing .and The Con cordlensis believes that the action will result in no lo·ss J:lut. ~ather ·considerable gatn to Union in her athi.:.tic interests.

Triangl:llar League to Be Continued. On April 11, Prof. H. G. McKean, revresent- ing the Intercollegiate Debating Cound: of Union went to Clinton, where he nel'd a conference with Prnf. Lewis, representing Hamilton, and Prof. E. W. Smith, representing Colgate. It was unanimously agreed to ·continue the tri- angular debating league of the·se three colleges and preliminary steps were tak\3n toward forming a three year contract. Several suggestions as to minor details of arrangements were oftered, bnt the plan will be essentially the same as t11at which proved so satisfactory during the past sea· son. Prof. Lewis of Hamilton College was ·Cho-S'=D the executive officer of the league. The positton was held by Prof. Mc~ean .during the r1ast year. The average cost of Yale's Junior Prom festivi- ties was $1'212.90 for each man. One man spent $900, but he entertained ai a house party. Omit- tjng this, tihe average cost ialls to $105.25.

The current number of \The Cla·ssical Review'' contains an exc·eilent article bY Dr. Asl1more. 1.~ is a review of Cicero's \Tusculan Disputations,·· edited by H. G. Nutting.. This text was used bY· the Senior ·Class in Latin with Dr. Ashmore iast. term. ·An ad·dition to the library of unusual interest 1s a book of original manuscripts entitled '·Poems <.n-1 Various Subjects.\ The author is John V. Vee;:Ler, a graduate of Union in the class of 180:6. one of these rwems, \Lines vVritten on Leaving Col· lege,\ is deserving of the attention of all Union students. Dr. Ashmore is to deliver an address to-nig·b.t before the S.chenectady Historical Society on tl1.e subject, \The History of Clas·sical Scholarship i:l Schenectady County. The musical clubs are to give a concert in the High School Auditorium on April 29. As this will probably be the last appearan-ce of the club this year, every effort is being made to have the entertainment successful. The fact that Dr. Tayler Lewis and Dr. White- horne, former professors at Union, were classic9.. i students of great distinction, should intere·st the students in this lecture. The weeldy n1eeting of the Concordiensis Board will be held Friday at 4 p. m., in Sillin1an Ha! 1. E-very member of the Board is re=1u~red to be prasent.

PRESS. CLUB. With a list of members, all of whom are, taking an active interest in the club every branch seems to have gaine-d fresh impetus. The spirit shown is the be·st that has been exhibited by the fel· lows since the organization of the ·Clnn a year ago last 'fall. With new quarters and money to meet the necessary expenses of the work a very active ·campaign is assured for the coming spring term. A system of assignment by card has been tried and has proved very sati'sfactory. A number of photographs have been taken and are to ap- pear very shortly in several of the leading daiiies. On the evening of April 27th, a banquet is to be held for a general \get together\ of ah members. A CORRECT,l:QN. On page 7 of last week's is·sue there app·aared a short a·ccount of a former Union professor. A mis- take in the punctuation ·causes an incorrect state· ment.

THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXIII UNION ,C'OLLEGE, APRIL 30, 1910 No. 25 NEW ENGINEERING !BUTLDlNG H!,L\S AUSPICIOUS OPEN lNG Addresses by Prom'i nent Educators and Otherl3- Dr. Draper Adv()cates Munkipall Aid f~H- Union. On Thursday morning at 11 o'·clo·ck Union be- gan the exerc-ises in c-elebration of the opening of her n8'w Engineering Building. The progra.m started ·w.ith addresses in t1:te chape•l by pro•m- ·inent educa·tors fr.orn different parts .of the country. Dr. Richm·ond Welcomes Guests. President Richmond 1nade a s·hort address in w-hich he welcomed the guests. He mentioned that one of the best and shrewdest investments w·hich M!r. Carnegie ever made ·was the new En- gineering Build'ing. \Frexy\ spoke of Union as being the first ooll eg~ to offer instr11•ct:ion ~in en- gineering. This course ·was given in 1847 by Prof. Gillespie. Dr. s.w.a.i n's Address. Dr. Richmo.nd then introduced George F. Swain, LL.D., professor of ei.v'il eng1ineering in Harvard Univers:ty. Prof . .Swain apoke of \The Limita- tions of Efficiency in Engineering Education.\ H·e made the p-oints that an engineei'ing graduate has son1e defHnite ahJJl fn life, and tl:te old charg-e that he is fuH of theory is untrue. Most grad- ·' uates are very successful and are taken up im- n1edia.tely by practical 1nen. Often men have po- sitions before ·graduation. The en~ineer should have a sound ·physical, moral and ·mental train- ing. Often the rig-ll.t men are not -se·nt to college and so very little is accompllished i11 some cases. M'en should have tile vo·cation for which they are best fitted. It is better to he a good wechan'i.c than a poor engineer. 111 many colleges too n1uc.h -instruction is !5·i-ven by lecture. The recita- tion is· better s1: nee it po-ints out ·defects in the student which the pro1essor may correct. Stu- -dents oftentilnes are n®t taught to study in the right n1annet, and th-erefore waste much time and ac-complish less. Stu-dents should always work during the summer vacation. •This in brief were the points made by D1'. Swain. Address by Dr. 'Be,mis. Dr. Richmond then introd.ltced as the next speaker Edward W. Hem.is, A. M~, Ph. D., deputy water comm.issioner of New Y.ork ·City, ·who spoke of the Engineer in Public Life. Dr. Bem·is spoke of the favorable opportunities for an eng·ineer in p·ub:lic service, as ·in the employ of the govern- m,ent or State. He claimed that m·ore concrete results are obtained b:y an engineer doing public service work, and that every day fe·wer en- gineers are being removed from their posUions as a result of politi-cs. \Municipal Ai:d,'' Says Draper. After the applause had ceased \P1~exy' in tro- duced Andrew S. Draper, LL.D., Con1om.iss-ioner of Education of New Yorl{ State. Dr. Draper spoke of the eng1ineer as a man who a~complishes much. He believes that the succe2s -of the en- gineering department of the college will help the other departn1,ents. As one speaking for the 8tate, he said tha.t the S.t::t te was mueh in synTpathy with Union and believed tbat it is a great mistake if Union is not considered. one of the greatest co,11eges in the country. In the course o:f his address Dr. DTaper said: \Union should te at the renter of a syste:11 of 1nunicipal universities that would appeal to every city with in a radius of fifty miles. It would make it a real university and would in- clude A:lbany, Troy, Rensselaer, Cohoes, Hudson, Watervliet and other cities in this vicinity.

President Rich.mond next introduced Franklin H. Giddings, Ph.D., LL.D., professor of snctology in Columbia University. He ·made as his pri:n- eipal point that true •culture consists in doing things rightly. He spoke of •commercial civiliza- tion al<>ng with seveoral other kinds and remarked that the ·difference between commercial civil'iza- Uon and any ot1ler kind ·was the hum·bug in the com1merdal civilization. Dr. Giddings would not admit that engineers had a part in the com·mer- CJial .civilization. He concluded his talk by a very snappy illustrati-on, and was warmly ap- plauded. Letter Fro·m Mr. rCarnegie. Dr. Alexander read a letter from Mr. Carnegie in whi·ch the latter expressed h'is regret at being unable to attend the ce-remonies. He then for- mally presented M'r. Carnegie's gift to the col- lege. Silas B. Brownell, LL.D., president of the Board of Trustees, made a very suitable reply in behalf -of Union College. [n his talk he gave some ·hiistory of the eollege and said that the new Engineering Building was fo·r the benefit of eitizen·s and :should enable its .students to serve the COmiiD.Unity. Wollo·wing this add-ress, all arose and sang Alma Miater. Then the guests went over to the Engineering BuDding for luncheon. At 3: 30 the base·ball game- between New York Un'iver.sity and Unlion was played, and after the game Pres'iden t and Mrs. Riohmoud served tea for the guests.

NEW YORK UNIVERS·ITY WINiS GAME BUT UNION SCO·RES SlX RUNS Fai.rbafr:r,a and .Biche Lead in Hitti n·g and Fielding -Hits Com•e lnte•rmittently and Not at Favorable Moments. To cap the events on Thursday, the day of the opening of the new Enginee.ring Building,, the Garnet met ~New York University on the campus, and, after a hard fight, in whic'h gnod stick-work was in evidence, wa.s honorably beaten, the New Yorkers exceUling in practically- every depart- Inent of the game. At first, Union fottnd difficulty in meeting the ball, with men on ·bases. Fairbairn hit the :first ball .sent over for two bases. IBeyond a sacrifice by Giddings, Union could do nothing. The same .state of affairs held until the fourth inning. Meanwhile, the boys from Got'ham were scor- ing on account of a lucky :O.ahit fhey had of lean- ing against the ball for two or three bases,after a runner had reached first, usuaUy by errors. In this way they had obtained five runs by steady work, when Union momentarily \went u:p in th~ air'' in the sixth inning, and gave them thre~ run.s. Two men were already out when a ma:P. reached first on an error. 'The next batter hit a b.ot grounder, which Giddings smothered an<i threw to Fairbairn, who easily ha.d the runner on second. .A 'raw\ decision, however, called him safe and t'he three runs followed. Biche started the scoring for Union by send- ing a three-bagger down the left field line, and coming home on a wild throw, an after two were out. In the seventh, O'·Keefe, batting for Blodgett, and Ladue each crossed the plate .by hard hitting. ~stewart fo1;1nd the ball in the ninth for three ibases, and came home on a wild t'h·row. Fair- bairn was forced out at third, but tGiddings and O'Keefe came in later. ·New Y<:>rk then changed pitchers, and Biche ended the game by striking out.

A. E. Regnier, Brown, 1910, selected by Walter Camp as an All~A:.:nedcan end for 1909, will coach un:on's eleven next fall, according to an announcement made by Secretary Ferguson of the Athletic Board recently. At the close of the last football season, a c·ommittee composed of Dr. McCom·ber, Captain- elect Brown, and Manager Baker, was aiJpointed by the Athletic Board to procure a eoacil for the coming season. Regnier's relcord as a skilflul and exceedingly fast player made him the 1best of tt.te three most seriously considered candi- dates. Regnier's Career. 1R.egnier played on the regular team throughout his 'High 'School course, and would have played on the varsity w'hen he entered Brown b.ad Fresh~ men not been debarred. ~During the rest of his course he has been the most brilliant player on the team, playing quarter-back, half-back, and en.d.

The sele·ction of Hon. CHAN·CEL:L.OR .James Bryce as Union's hon- orary .C.hancellor io one that commends itself most heartily to every under- graduate and every alumnus. It is not too much to .say t'h-at no choice could be more acceptable than that o.f this great diplomat and statesnan, now ambassador from the Court of !St. James. Union men will all be interested in knowing more of this great figure of the lite·rature and history of to-day. To write a biography in brief of James Bryce has been comp·ared to trying to snapshot 'Niagara Falls w=.th a two-by-four camera. Just recall that at the age of twenty- four he wrote \'T'he 1Holy .Ro:nan !Empire,\ whi-ch is one of t1le great classics of history. Oonsider that his great book, 'The American !Gammon- wealth,\ is everywhere regarded as the standard authority on the political life of our country. Though only an observer of American life, this tl Englishman, who unde.rstands us, has greatly · 'h·elped us to understand ourselves. President Richmond w~ll not 'find the alumni or the students unappreciative of his service to the college in securing James Bryce as our honorary ·Chancellor. It will add new lustre to our already glorious alumni list to enroll as an honorary alumnus him who has been called 'the greatest states1nan in the world to-day.\ OUR NEW EIN·GI NE•E R·l N G BUJLD·ING T'hursday, April ·28, will will go down as another of Union's Red Letter days, for the ded~cation of our new Engineering Building was an occasion of great importance to the welfare of our college.

Last Wednesday evening was the term~nation of a succesisful season and ca1npaign for the Union College Press Club. The phenomenal development of the organization during the past year seems ;.narvelous, considering the fact that the club was severely 'handicapped by lack of money and sup.port from the general student body. The club is in excellent condition to meet the ean1paign for the coming year; its working equipment has been materially !ncreased by the addition of one ·nundred dollars to the treasury, new quarters, and a typewriter and telephone for the c-onvenience of club memlbers. At the meeting Wednesday evening, reports were read, covering the season's work of the various com.mittees, by the chairmen of these committees. 'F'oUowing t'his, the election of offi- cers took place. Officers f.or the ensuing year are: Pres~dent, 0. A. Faust; Vice-president, H. N. Trumbull; Treasurer, H. T. Gase; ·Secretary, A. L.

Members of the club ntet at Glenn's at eight- thirty~ directly following· the annual n1eeting, for a banquet and general \get-together\ tn celebra- tion of the year's work. The banquet was a rousing windup of a successful year.

Barnes o,n Illiteracy. Dr. Barnes spoke of the language generally used by the college student. He said that it was ' very foreign; that in fact it was in a class all by itself. He suggested that we all try to im- prove our Engli:sh, as the impression created by having Union men speak good ·English would do much for the college. .Short speeches from A. E. Kreigsman, the re- tiring preBident, and 0. A. Faust, the new presi- dent, were listened to and followed by a great deal of applause. Both congratulated the club on the work of the past year and prop'hesised great things for the future. After a talk by Cub Potter the banquet broke up and everybody expressed the opinion that a very enjoyable evening had been spent.

REVIEW OF TRAICK ·EVE·NTS PROOF OF P.ROFI·CIENCY. Creditable Work Done in all Branches of Track Work--Cross Country Te1am Str·ong-Out- look for the Future . Under the able managem.ent of iH. H. cGrover and the systemaUc and conscientious direction of Captain Dennis, Union's track and cross country teams have more than held their own during the past year. 10aptain 'Travis made the best of the possibili- ties found in some of the fellows -as cross coun- try runners and has developed a strong team in this 1hranch of track work. JThe first meet of the fall season was with Hamilton, at IS.chenec\la\:iy, on O:ctolber 3·0th. For Union's team 1Rogers took first pla.ce; Oaptain Travis was a close sHcond, with Coward and L-a Barron ·fourth and fifth re- spectively. •Cross Country With Ve:rrno:nt. On r.November 6th, the team me:t the Univer- sity ef Vermont at Burlington\ Vt., in a cross (mountainous) country run. In. the n1o1ning before the event the team was led over the course·. ;In speaking of the aff.:tir one of un:on's men said: \.No we didn't go in a·utornobHes. Who has ever seen an automobile ttat could climb hills through meadows, go througil swainps, and hurdle barb wire .fences? 1It certainly did dis .. courage u.s when we saw t'he course-four m.lies of steep hills, swamps, meadows, mud, and fences.\ In spite of the fact that Union lost to Vermont the team did creditable work. R-oger.s took first place, 1 Travis ·fifth, and Coward and La Barron s~xth and seventh respectively, making the score 13 to 15 in favor of Verm.ont. MANAGER GROVER Indoor Meets. During tte past winter many of the track men participated in indoor meets in the vicinity. On January 2·6th, in the Troy 1A:rm.ory, Malley, of thP Law Department of Union University showed up well in sprints. In the meet held in Albany under the auspi·ces of Company A the followh1g men from the University were entered and made an excellent showing: !Case, Lee, Malley, 'Spear- man and Rogers. At ·Troy on Washington's birthday a number of Union men were entered and in spite of the fact that they were 1natc:1ed against athletes somewhat out of their class they held their own in the contest. 'The men entered at this meet were: ease, Lee, S.pearman, Dewey, and La [Barron. Marsh took first place in the pole vault in the ~'ri~county games held at Alhany on April 6th. . 'l ; ',1 l ' ,.

' THE U()NC·ORDIEN:SIS 11 Meet W'ith Amherst. !The principal event of the winter was the dual :m€e.t with M.assachusetts Agricultural Col- leg.e at Amherst, IMaf!ch 7th. The races were run off on a board traek, to w'hdch Union's m.en were unaecustomed. 'The trip, to .Amherst had tired the Garnet team consi.derably, so that, taking into consider.ation the conditions existing on t:1e track and the condition of the men, Unio11 was at a decided disadvantage in the meet. The tea1n that made the trip consisted of the following: Oaptain. Dennis, Malley, 'Travis, Case, •Ruprecht, Smith, Streeve-r, Ro-gers and Spear,man. Of these Case, De·nnis and Malley :made t'he most points for Union. 'The meet, however, ended in defeat for the G-arnet. The s·core was 4,2 and 17. 'The result did not tend to discourage the team, but CAPTAIN DENNIS ratt.er was thought of as a means of bringing o-ut the weak po:ints upon which to lay extra stress in the future. Prospe,cts for Spring. The schedule for the spring :s an unusually good one and deserves the 'heartiest support from the studen body. A few fast track men are at the present ·Ume ineUgHble to cmnpete in inter~ collegiate contests because of conditions. It is expected, however, that these men will be able to get the conditions raised and will be regular members of the team in t~m:e for the important meeta. 18. M.

The Keen Kutter \Safety\ gives a true sliding strok.e. Goes together in the tenth of a \jiffy \ and works equally well, up stroke or down. It's the one razor made that's per- fectly adapted to easy shaving. Comes in a neat case, fully guaranteed, with 12 ready stropped blades. Silver plated in Genuine Black Leather Case, $3;50. Gold plated in Genuine English Pigskin Case, $5.00.
