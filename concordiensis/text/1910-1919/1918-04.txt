Art Press, FRIDAY, APRIL 19, 1918. The sudden bereavement that Dr. Franl< S. Hoffman and Mrs. Hoff- man have suffered, has thrown the entire college into tl1e deepest gloom and mourning. The occurrence is the saddest which we have experienced in many a year, and its memory will be hard to erase. 'The courageous at- tempts of several members of the Freshman class to avert the tragedy will illumine a page in the records of enion College, and though vain, will ever remain as an example of true heroism. The student body and all those connected with the college ex- tcncl their sincerest condolences to Dr. and Mrs. Hoffman and trust that they may he enabled t<l bear up cour- ag-eously in this theit time of tribula- tion and sorrow.
