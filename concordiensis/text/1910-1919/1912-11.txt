Publication Office: THE NEWLAND-VoNRITTERCo., 149 Clinton Street, Schenectady, N. Y. THE FOOTBALL SITUATION lT nion' s football season has con1e to a . VlC- torious conclusion. lTnfortunately \\Ve have not scored so many points as our opponents, due mainly to the fated contest at \VesJ:eyan, but as reg-ards g-ames vvon and lost our record is an enviable one. On comparing, before the gan1e, this same record \vith that of Hamilton, odds \vere found to be oyer\vhelm- ingly in our favor. Our opponents came to Schenectady full of spirit but hardly expected a victory over the Garnet. On the other hand, Union never once reckoned on defeat. The student body \vas bubbling over \vith en- thusiastn long before the game took place. Preparations \vcre n1ad~ for celebrating the victory and the tea1n \vas under high tension \vhen the battle began. The Garnet eleven had been kept in strict training all \veek ancl every 111an \YCLS confi- dent of success. In short, spirit \\Vas in 110 \Vay lacking, if anything could be said it '''onlc1 be that we \vere over confident. Perhaps t 11:e team shared this feeling or peThaps \Vas eren too \ve11 trained and too highly strung-. Rut \Ve needn't lament this now. \Ve won and \von a glorious triumph. Bnt \Ve must con- fess that the strength sho\vn by Hami1ton was a surprise to everyone. The ral1 ,·ino· . ,....., po\ver manifested by that team was \Vort'hy of note. Yet this only reflects more credit upon our own eleven. Surely Hamilton dicl not put up against her other opponents the game she did against. Union, but, as \Ve sa.,. . ) this can only add to the praise of Coach Da\\'- son' s tean1, for to defeat an aggregation of husky and fast football \ivarriors is a far bet- ter prize than victory in a one sided battle. The loss of senior n1em bers from the terun \vill naturally tend to weaken the eleven, but \Vith so n1uch 1naterial still left as a founc1a- tion and \Vith a coach and captain both of \\rhon1 have a notab1e past and a bright fut11TL', the students can hardly look for\varcl to next year \Vith any feeling other than a most op- timistic one. ---:0:--- REGARDING COMMUNICATIONS It is \vith regret that -vve reaEz·e that onr comtnunication cohunn has offered an outlet to some students for the expression of opin- ions not entirely in hannony \vith the ,g·cn- eral tone of the college. The cohunn \vas not instituted for such a purpose though nn- fortnnate1r D1('St of the con1munications thns far received Lave been pervaded \Vith a sligh11y radical sentiment. Since the co1nmunications haye prov~d unpleasant in many instances. the editors now propose to publish only sncl1 con1munications as they c1een1 conduciyc to te: to hJ lC~ to er (T T w tl t< C1 \\' I 1 ..:\ a 11 ,,

' vC s ' The C . d. . oncor, 1ens1s VOL. 36. NOVEMBER 2·7, 1912 No.8 FOOTBALL SEASON AS REVIEWED BY D'R. McCOMBER So much has already been written concern- ing the football season just ended so happily that it seems aThmost supetfluous to continue the discussion. The games themselves, therefore, -vvill receive but brief mention. On the other hand a survey of the general situa- tion may be he1pful. We fondly hope that the brilliant record of the season of 1 <J12 portends the beginning of a new era in Union College Athletics. It cer- tainly represents the first fruits of the adoption of a new system of coaching whereby a head coach of undoubted ability becomes a perma- nent factor in directing the activities and the po1icies of our athletic life. Union, s system for a long time has been unsatisfactory because of continual changes in the personn-e1 of her coaching staff and the results on the whole, particularly in football, have not been creditable to the institution. This has been due largely to financial restric- tions. Along \Vith tbe recent general improven1ent in the status of the college there developed a determination on the part of the students, alun1ni .Lnd faculty alike, to raise the s1 and- ard of athletic representation. Aided by the increased financial resources, due chiefly to a 1oyal spirit of self sacrifice on the part of the student body and partly to guarantees of supp~1·t from the alumni, the Athletic Board was enabled to secure the services of a com- petent bead coach to take charge of football, basketball and baseball. That Mr. Dawson was a happy choice on the part of the board has 'been amply demonstrated by the results of the season just ended. Mr. Dawsort has vV011l th.e confidence and regard of all Union supporters. He has inspired the team with COACH DA 'VSON his O\-vn indotnitable sp=rit. He has aroused a spi-rit of unselfish devotion to the interests of O~d Union and he is an earnest advocate of the type of clean sportsmanship vvhich has been for so long a time one of Union's best assets. Aside from the large percentage of games won.. the season has been note-,vorthy for the de-veloptnent of several significant factors

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS that are of gTcat in1portancc in th€ realization of our scherne to in1prove conditions. First an increased and helpful interest on the part of the alumni has been aroused. This inter- est has not only been demonstrated in the form of financial guarantees but it has taken a more personal character and we have had an unusua1 number· of graduates of Union, fatuous athl€tes of the days 'gone by, who have appeared on the field in suits and as- sisted in the development of the team and in inspiring tR.c fe1lo\vs by their presence. This is as it should be. It is to be hoped that this is but the beginning of the devel0;p1nent of a comprehe11sive system of graduate assistance to the head cqach Y\rhich is so general in our large universities. When busy men like Daley '92, Richards '95, Sn1ith '99, Carver '01 and Cronkhite '04, gladly take time frotn t1.:1eir bus-iness to co1ne and help in t11e coach- ing of our teams it augurs \vell for the future of sport at Union. The con1mittee on Under- graduate Activities of the G-raduate Council with E. S. Coons '92, as chairman is largely responsible for getting these men to con1e back and assist in the coaching being another concrete e:xarn p le of \VOrth of the council to the co11cg·c. .A scco11d i1nportant factor in the season's success ha.s been the largely inclieased pub- licity giyen to the tcatn 's activitieso Credit for this .is partl).r due to the enterprize of the Press Ch:'), but sti1l tnorc to the untiring effortf5 of an ahunnn~ of the co11L',~·e, l\1r. \V. Earl \Ve1- 1er <l\ the class of 1907. Ivir. \Ve1lcr has clone the college a. unique seryice by debTing· into the history of football and putting· the results of his labors into available forn1. Mr. \i\T el- ler' s first hand account~ of all ga1nes both at hon1L' and a\\\:ty have been notonlyn1ost help- ful in keeping students and alnm11 1 in touch \\Tith the \vurk of the teatn but, in addition, ha yc: resulted in arousing- a genuine interest in the success of our tea1ns on the part of the larg-e nun1ber of college men from other in- stitutions···w·ho are residing in the city. Such interest is of .QTcat value to Union and \Ve are deeply indebted to Mr. W cller for his unflag- ging exertions. An innovation of the season was the ex_ peri1nent of quartering the entir-e squad at one of the fraternity houses during the week of the final game. The generous response -vvhich the fraternities n1ade to Manager Whitney's request for a house \vas n1,JSt grat- ifying and indicated a high degree of broth- erly feeling among the fraternity men and a genuine college spirit as \vell. The Delta Upsilon house vvas selected by the committee as best adapted for the purpose and I wish to make due acknowledgement of our indebted- ness to Delta Upsilon for loyal service to the colle()'e c.\\:> • It is not the intention of this aa-ticle to dis- cuss the merits of the individual players. The n1aterial for the team was better than usual and Coach De:nvson \velcled it into an effective organization. Although at times exhibiting glaring defects in the \vay · of tackling and forming interference, the tean1 sho\vecl on many occasions that it could ptay sp1enc1ic1 football and time and again, put up snch a stubborn defense as to shatter all hope of victory on the part of onr opponents. The tea1n and the college n1ay \Vell be con- gratulated upon the leader of our victorious eleven. Captain Dev\rey has made an enyi- ablc record as a player ancl as a captain; a~ a student ancl as a sportsman. lie has fully n1eritecl every success that has co:ne to hin1 and to his tean1. Captain Dc\vey h:ts starre·1 at carrying the ball anJ his consistent 11unt- ing and kicking of g~oals have been all i nl- portant factors in the scoring. I-Iis loss to the tean1 through graduation \vill be keenly felt. Prospocts for next year are very encourag- ing-. Twelve of the n1en \vho vvere a\vardecl the varsity letter should be back .-~in· college next fall ancl a squad of twenty-five.1n~n who have h:td the benefit of Mr. Davvson's coach- ing should be rea:dy 'to ans\vcr the first call for candidates for the season of 1913. Our ne\v captain is a player of proved ability and

x- of h- ee to he ve on ch of m- as to all nc1 THE ·CONCORDIENSIS 9 should 1nake an efficient leader. Certainly we have every reason to believe and to ex- pect that Captain Sarvey and his team will not only equal but vd11 raise our present \vith brilliant plays and spectacular inci- dents. The season of 1912 is past and the verdict is ''well done.'' \Vhat about 1913? It is time to begin to plan for that no\v. \Vhat standard of excellence. The se?~son wound up \vith a fitting- clin1ax and the final gan1e \vith Han1i1ton proved a11 the thr111s that had been advertised and added seycral more for good measure. In spite of an unsuccessful season and reports of a \\ran- in~· spirit on the part of our opponents I Han1- i1ton can1e on the field in1tned vdth that' 'never say die'' spirit in \vhich she is famous \vhen pitted against Union and before the g-alne was over s11e had a1nply justified that reputa- tion. Exhibiting unexpected strength and 111alzing sp1cndic1 interference for her fast hcclYY backs Hcnnilton soon forced the· battle into 1)n1on's territory and \vhen the first hetlf \ras uyer the~ blue teatn had scored two touch- llo\YDS against one for the c;arnet. Failure help may \Ve expect from the class of 1917? Every Union College st11dent and alun1nus can help to an~nver that question. vVhat are you doing· to turn the thoughts of son1e sturdy school boy to~rard Union? Let every one of us constitute him~self a cotnmittee to boost the name and fame of Union \vhenever and \vherever \ve are able. Strike early. Don't \vait until some desirable feUo\v has 1nacle up his mind to go elsewhere but strive to interest h1n1 in l_Tnion no\V. t( J kick anr of the goals left the score t\Yclve tt 1 six \Yith Han1i1ton jubilant and t_Tnion de- tL·nninec.1. 'T'he second half \vas a nerve racking per- f<lrn1ance and \vhen Sarvey covered Hami1- t<J1l' s fatal alten1pt at a forw<lrc.l pass and aic1ec1 b~~ sp1enc1ic1 interference ran fifty-tl\\\e yards for a touchc1o\vn, the joy; of LT nion rooters knew no bounds.

But 'tis quite another 1Datter v1.rhen ath leties are not included in the inducen1en t. The 1ack of interest in such important co1- 1ege activities as debating is to be regretted, incleed, a lack of interest in affairs 1nost ad- vantageous. to the students and rnost conduc- iye to their broader education is most unfortun- ate also. \Tigorous exertions have been ~nack by- our president, the faculty and some student organizations to hay·t, 1)ron1inent men \\'isit t_T nion to address the students or offer then1 son1e sort of entertainment and the student body has absolutely rcfusec1 to be benefited.

The fact that there is a general up-\vard n1ovetnent of the land relative to the sea level in the middle northern latitudes, of course, substantiates such a belief. Accord- ing- to Prof. Sto11er it is also kno\vn that therL' are several local evidences of upward '\varp- ing- of the land.

16 THE CONCORDIENSIS the Council. This representative will meet \Yi th the Council during his senior year and is to hold office for the follo\ving five years. Those of us who live on the campus appreci- ate how vigorous College spirit is among the undergraduates. It therefore seems reason- able to expect the senior class to go out each year thoroughly organ-ized and ready to car-ry into the alumni body that enthusiasm which has justly given the student body a reputation. It is necessary, ho\vever, that attention be given to organization and the choosing of energetic officers. When v;e are scattered all over the country it is a considerable task to keep the spirit of the class intact. To ac- complish this, it has been found \vise to have a President, Treasurer, a Council represent- ative, ancl executive committee of three to five men. 1'his co1n1nittee should represent all factions if there are any and should par- cel out a1nong themselves the class that the burden of supplying them \Vith College anc1 class neV\rs, may be 1ightenec1. It is higbly desirable that every n1en1ber of the class take the :Nlonthly, and 1912 has set an exan1ple by doing so. It is also essential that the class have a bank account that the officers 1nay have funds \vith \vhich to pay for printing-, postage, etc. \,.. o1nnxes could be \Yritten on this subject but a class organized as sug-gested above \vill find it possible to continue as ahnnni the en- thusias1Tl of nndergTacluate days, \vhich is no\Y so g·reat an assistance to our Colleg-e. 'I'he in1proven1ents in Con1n1encen1cnt thne are tnaking c1ass reunions a rnatter of in1- portance. The costun1e parade, the cornpe- tition for the \Va1c1ron Cup, Ah1n1ni Night, anc1 in general the opportunities for a g·ooc1 t11ne offered b~~ the College are a strong at- traction and the alntnni arc finding it a p1eas- the student body should carefully prepare then1se1ves that when they leave College, in p1a:ce of becoming so much dead \Veig11t which has to be carried by still feeble alumni machinery, they \vill become a real strength to Union. The messag(:., the Council sends the student body is this:- Organize your c1ass according to our plans, that \vhcn you join us, your youth and spirit may be a so11 rce of strength to the Co11ege. We \vant your fine enthusiasm that it may spread to all sons of Union. C. \V. Waldron · Secretary of Graduate Council --:0:--- JOHNNY BENNETT, HIS CLASS (Some Class.) Johnny: \Vell, con1rade Dnane?

It hardly seemed as if the real Union team was playing Wesleyan on Saturday with so many regulars crippled and out of the game. With Sarvey, Jenkins, and Mallen on the sick Hst and Dewey, Starbuck, and Jackson half crippled, it could hardly be expected of the varsity to do its best. Union faced a team about 30 pounds heav- ier. But the fight that the team put up, is hardly expressed in the score. Faced by greater odds, the Union men went into the game heart and soul. No one in college is at all discouraged over the result. TNesleyan was somewhat taken off her feet by the first quarter. Union opened hole af- ter hole and Gilbert was able to steal two 5-yard tackle runs. Dewey sent a field goal over the bar and gave Union her only score. In the second period, Wesleyan made sev- eral changes in her lineup. She began to hammer the Union line relentlessly. By her superior \veight she was able to gradually \Vear the Union line to pieces.. After that, Union had to play on the defensive entirely. Though Wesleyan had the advantage, the 1Jnion team made her resort to the p·unt again and again. \¥ esleyan was able to force Keegan over the line in the second period and Eustic kicked the goal. The second half started with Wesleyan trying ·out two \subs\ but the hard attack of the Garnet men forced the regulars back into the game. ' ' The Methodists were also chary in their use of end runs,'' says the Gazette, ''relying almost entirely on their weight to crush through Union's light line with straight bucks. Most of Union's gains were made on skin tackle plays. The Garnet tried several foward passes but it was too much of a pro- position to get the ball over the heads of. the Wesleyan six footers and all the passes were incomplete. Union also lost considerable ground on every exchange of punts. Dewey's hip bothered him greatly and he was forced to allow someone else to do the punt- ing. The other players, unused to kicking, were keyed at too high a pitch to lift the ball very far and the results were that the Gar- net punts were not covering much more than fifteen or twenty yards.'' Credit was generally given to Gilbert and Dewey for fine work in the game for Union, while Yaggren, and Kenan and Bacon, up- held honot·s for Wesleyan. As the game was being played, the results by periods were sent by telegraph to the Press ·Club and then posted. The first bul- letin gave great satisfaction but the others were followed with silence.

The Cross Country team ended its season Saturday by defeating the Colgate runners with a. score of 20-35. The day was a typical fall day with crisp air and a sharp breeze. A large crowd lined the oval to witness tbe start and finish of the race. Gould of Col- gate was the first tnan to finish, Elmore of Union finished second, LaBarron, Rogers, Tremper and Vedder of Union crossed the line abreast taking third, fourth, fifth and sixth places. Bernstorm, Colgate, finished seventh, Laegler, captain of the Colgate team, was next to finish and then came Simons and Markhan1, both of Colgate. Gould made a pretty run and finished strong, his time being 20:13. LaBarr on and Gould ran close together for the first 2 -,1-2 miles and then Gould took a decided lead Mittel Parkinson Eustis right taclde right end Ulrich while LaBarron dropped back with the other four Union men. It was a grand sight for Story Union students to see those five runners finish- ing tog-ether and showed the excellent physi-

e ' e d 2 THE CONCORDIENSIS cal condition and team-work of the Garnet men. Last year's defeat was in the mind ot the Union men and they ran their best to retrieve themselves. This they did with a vengence and took the race by a wide, safe margin. Union has every reason to be proud of her cross country team which has 1ost only one race in the last five years. This is a showing of which any team might \vell be proud. --:0:-- FRESHMEN DEFEATED The Freshman football team journeyed to Pawling, N. Y., Saturday, where they played the Pawling School. The Frosh were played off their feet and the final score was 26-0 in favor of Pawling. Coach Riedinger accom- panied the team. One of the Pawling play- ers fractured his collar bone during the game. But this was the only mishap. --:0:-- MUSICAL CLUBS' TRIP The musical clubs will open their season on Friday evening, Nov. 8, when they will journey to Ballston. They are to be enter- tained there with a dance given after the concert by the young people of Ballston. The second engagement of the clubs is at Niskayuna, on Tuesday evening, Nov. 12. The management is contetnplating a Thanks- giving trip to Buffalo and vicinity which will possibly include engagements at Oneonta, Binghamton, East Aurora and Buffalo. There are twenty-five men out for the n1.an- do1in club, twenty-four for the glee club and seven for the banjo club. Seven doubles oc- cu~ between the mandolin and glee clubs, anq also seven doubles between the banjo and mandolin clubs. The management ex- pects to take thirty-five men on the trips this year, \V hich will be eight more than were taken last year. No cut wi11 occur until af- tet th·e seconcl. concert. The progress of the club is better this year than ever before and a more successful year than ever before is almost certain. Two of the best numbers, which the clubs are prac- ticing, -vvere written by Mr. Goggin. Leader Davis is to sing a bass solo this year accom- panied by the \vhole club. This is one of the most difficult things the club has tried as yet. There will be medley solos, by Dick- inson and Wood, and also a quartet. The picture ·of the clubs will be taken some noon this week immediately after ·lunch. More sophomores who are in the c1ubs are wanted to try out for assistant manager. There is still a good chance. --: 0 :------ FRESHMAN PEE-RADE The freshman peerade this year has all the appearances of a great success. The com- mittee in charge has worked hard and at the present date, about eighty parts have been assigned. The whole freshmen class has been given parts except the foot ball men and members of the Band, who of course will not be in the peerade. The 1ine of march will be similar to that of fortner years. The pee- rade will start on the afternoon of the I-I am- ilton game, the exact time to be announced later. The students are paying their tax well and, as moved in college meeting, the cornmi ttee has a list of those who have not yet paid . The freshmen are entering into the spirit of the thing splendidly and the committee is doing its best to make the peerade a success. --:0:-- A special telegram was received from Pawl- ing N. Y., on the freshmen game. \5:42 P. M. First half, Pawling nine- teen, Union nothing, Second half, Pawling seven, Union nothing, Three fumbles by Union gave Pawling three touchdowns.

Y.; J ==~====================~~= CONCERNING THE PRIZE CONTEST : · ·.·In another part of this issue of the Con- tordiensis appear the conditions, as deter- ·mined by the Undergraduate Publication Board, governing the contest for the best series of literary articles to appear during the year ~n the columns of this paper. Presi- ·dent Richmond has offered a prize of suffi- cient value to bring out some decidedly good literary efforts. Such a contest conducted under faculty censorship ought not to fail 1:0 give an impetus to literary interest at Union and to put in the columns of the Concordien- ·sis articles of general interest to its readers. ·According to these rules any student may submit to the literary editor of the Concord- 'iensis at any time and in any number, articles for this contest. As they are received, they are turned over to a mefn\hor of the faculty who reads them ·and returns the . best (' ones to be published. In 'order· to be .~ligible \ a student ~ust have at least seven articles . . . thus accepted and published. At.tJ?.e end of the cont~st, which will be May 15, t?~ sets of seven or more articles will be sent to a i • • . committee composed of faculty members and alumni, who will judge· the effort~,. and if one set is considered worthy, it will be awarded the prize. It is hoped that this contest will serve its purpose. Literary int~rest, it must be adn1itted, is not what it should be. The Concordiensis, besides publishing the series of articles by faculty. memb~rs, wishes to . - ., \ publish articles of intetest from the student body. Here is· a decided incentive; and an exceptional oppbrtunity ayailable to the un- d~rgraduate to assist and benifit our week1y publication. The literary editor is ready to receive any -contributions for this contest at . . any time. l _g ,, THE WESLEY AN GAME . ( - The football' team never showed f_iner spirit tha~ ~hey dld Saturday, when, with .only four ' ' . . regulars in the game-, they went down to de- feat before the Wesleyan eleven.. Playing in a crippled condition, against one of the fast- est elevens in the East and one which is ad- mitted to be the best team Wesleyan has had in years' they not only kept the score down but forced the Methodists to play their hard- est to win. The students know the condi- tions and are not ohe whit discouraged over the result. With Stevens and Hamilton yet to play, the team is confident of adding these two hard games to their string of victories. The !Fecord has been a splendid one thus far and if we finish the season with a victory over Hamilton and only one defeat against us, we will have a record of which we may '\lYell be proud. 11 ,, t1 . 11 tl s . 11 p s 0 0 , .... f. f t

1 THE CONCORDIENSIS 11 :C'OLLEGE MEETING At the coUege meeting on Monday, Cap- tain De\vey spoke of tlte honorable defeat which the team suffered from Wesleyan,. 1 uentioning the fact tl1at they vvere out- ,,rcighed about thirty po11nd s p.er man, and that so1ne of our best men \\vere unable to get into the game. He said that every man on the team did his best but that, owing to the superiority of the \Vesleyan tearn, defeat was inevitable. If, however, son1e of the '' crip- ples'' have been in con.dition to play, the score ·would not had been so large. Captain LaEarron spoke of the good \vork of the cross country tea~1 in defeating- Col- gate on Saturday. ''Tl1e victory,'' he said, ''was achieved not by incliviclna1 brilliant per- fonnance but by consisLent and s·ustained ef- fort on the part of all the members of the tean1.'' Captain La Barron made special tnentlon of the spirit sl1Dwn by those five tnen w·ho stayed out and ·vrorked all season al- though, with five Varsity n1en out, they kne\v there ·was very little chance to n1ake the tean1. It is spirit like this which vvins vic- tories no\v and in the future. Although nothing is definitely settled as yet, there 'lvill be son1e relay work this \vinter. Meets at Williamstown, Albany and Nevv York are being- consideTed. Captain LaBar- ron vvould 1ike to see more ha1f-and quartcr- 1nilers out as this winter work is essential to turning out a good team in the :;pring. - Manager Whitney announced at the college meeting that it had been decided to ask some fraternity to give up its house to the foot- ball team tor the vveek before the Hatnilton game in order that the team might be together and under constant supervision. Those fra- ternities \vhich vvere able to do this were re- quested to sen(} representatives to a n1eeting \vhich ·was to be held in Silliman Ha11 on \r ~dnes(1ay evening to discuss the matter. This see1ns to be a splendid chance to show that we a-re back of the team and the coach, and the fraternity vvhich obtains this honor wiH mos.t certainly receive the thanks of the en tire coHege. At the request of the Ten-ace Council, Dr .. MacCouber explained, at the college meeting, his reasons for omitting the \\vrestling match- es from the inter-class games on Election day. He said that this feature had been in- trodnced at his suggestion, four years ag-o to f1:1Tnish an incentive for fa11 exercise to those vvho ·were not training for football or track, 1b11t that preparation was considered essentia1. As no one had done any training, he \vas not prepared to take the responsibility of a1lowing any student to take part in this severe eontest, and that, if, next year, no tnore training was done for the other events than bas been done this year, these also would be omitted. Attetttion vvas again called to the fact that that there were still sotne wbo had not signed the Honor Constitution. TJ1ese ·will be given an opportunity at the end of the week. The J\{anager of the G1ee Club an- nouncea that three ne\v songs and some old ones wi11 be given out this \veek for the Hamilton game. Everybody was requested to learn the words and music as soon as possi- ble for the rehearsals \vhich will be held later. The n1.atter of having a lunch room in Sil- lilnan Hall was discussed and a rising vote taken ()f those who would be in a position to patronize it. This would b-e a great conven- ience tor the college and the p1~oject is decid- edly worthy of support. ---:0:--- BLACK CAT CLUB The Black Cat Club helcl a business meet- ing at Goodman's last Friday evening and initiatC!d two of the new n1en1.bers elected on Tuesday. The meml;>ers elected were: F. Smi tb, and Mandeville initiated Friday, and Cure, Starbuck and MacGl<ntghlin.

The races were easy for the second-year men, the freshmen win- ning only one event, the tug-of-war. The game was equally easy, the much- talked -of freshman team being unable to do a thing against the attacks of the sophomores. Thetug-of-war was the only freshman victory. The struggle lasted three minutes, in whicl1 time the freshmen pulled the sophomores about thirty--five yards. Clark '15 won the 100-yard dash in easy style, Hunter '15 was a close .~second. The time was 10 3-5 seconds, fast time for the course. Blodgett '15 and Rollins '16 fought out the mile run but Blodgett nosed out a ten yard victory over Rollins. Sauerbrei took the lead at the start but set too fast a pace :and dropped out on the third lap. The time was 5:10 4-5. The relay proved easy for the sophomores. They finished twenty yards ahead. Baldy 'l5 made a big gain for his class, running his lap in very fast time. The football game was won by the sopho- mores by a score of six to three. They scored their only touchdown on a f1·eshman fumble. Buckley '15 recovered the baH and ran for a touchdown. The sophomores, however, failed to kick the goal. In the fourth period, the freshmen scored on a pretty drop kick from the thirty- yard line. Pierson turned the trick, which \ .. as the re- deeming feature of the freshmen playing. :'l'he game was well played throughout al- tllough the freshmen were kept on the de- fensive by the fierce attacks of the second- year players. Scully, Beaver and Cleveland played well for the sophomores while Van Deusan, Berger and Vrooman starred for the frosh. The day was ideal and a large crowd wit- nessed the games. The classes were very enthusiastic and there were many detnon- strationts of class spirit. Both freshmen a..nd sophomores were out in force and backed tneir teams to the limit, both financially and ()tally. These contests do much to increase c1ass spirit among the men and are thus ben- eficial. The sophomore football team de- serves especial credit for its fine playing when it had had scarcely any signal practice and no scrimmage. Both classes showed uh well and both did their best. --:0::-- T. A. Fairbairn '12 is in the purchasing department of the Adam Meld urn Company, Buffalo. W. S.

This plan has worked out according to the ~is lies o.f _the coach as expressed Monday in ~~ college meeting-by ~1anag-er- Whitney. At that time he asked for sorn e fraternity on the Hill to volunteer its hq:gse for the use of the squad during next week.-~~Tuesday m)rning . .., representatives from the various fraternities met with the coach and manager and the re- . presentives of the team ,and it ~-was. d~cided to acce1)t the Delta U' s. offer oF: their hou:se. The chapter wi11 move Ot.:lt,'~ giving Coach Dawson absolute charge of things. They will be the guests of the Jarious other fra- ternities on the· 'Hill till after the Hamilton (• game. Coach Bawsol), wants to kee1) the men absolutely in stJliipt. t~aining for the week precei~ding the '1Iamilton game. He feels that with the men all in one house, he can see that they keep better hours and that they are in prime condition for the battle vvi th Hamilton. Hamilton's defeat at the hands of Rutgers last week added to the game lost to Hobart, makes the prospects apparently bright for Union, but Coach Dawson is tak- ing no chances and is doing everything in his power to end the season with a vic- tory over old Hamilton which 'vi11 wipe our defeat last year at Clinton. The team is playing better football than at any other time this season, and, although expecting a hard g-ame with Stevens Saturday, is confi- dent of victory. --:0:-- Charles Kilpatrick '98, former holder of the half mile record, made a visit on the Hill recently. F. L. Stiles '02 made a visit on the Hill Tuesday. He is practicing law on Long Island. PRESS !CLUB At its regular weekly meeting Wednesday 11ight, the Press Club showed its progressive spirit by working out a plan 'vbere by the re- ports or all out-of-tow11 games could be learned in the quickest P·0SsilY1e time. The manager of the team on a trip sends a tele- g-ram not exceeding twenty-five words to the Press Club at the end of each quarter and a bulletin is posted immediately in the Press Club -y-vindows. This plan is to be carried on during the basket ball and baseball seasons. Heretofore, athletic and general news has been covered by separate committees. At fhis mPeting it was decided to combine these two committees into one. Dr. Frank Coe Barnes of the faculty and Philip T. Hill '12 gave the Club most in- teresting talks. The plan of having men who are interested in practical journalism speak is to be continued during the winter. Election returns were received Tuesday even-ing, by the club and were posted on the Press Club bulletin. The club is increasing its efficiency this year and is doing much new work. --:0:-- Y. M. C.

16 THE CONCORDIENSIS COMMUN.'ICATIO:NS .(The eclite>rs are not responsible for any ideas or opinions expressed in this column and insist that ~11 communications submitted he signed.) To the editor: .After reading the 1etter pu bJished in the last iss11e of the Concordiensis, it seemed to 1ne that someone ought to answer it. Such sentiments ought not to go entirely un- noticed, so here goes ! In the first place, I can not see any noticeable lack of spirit on the part of the students. If the good old- fashioned Union spirit was not shown at the Rutgers ,g-ame, I'tn sure I never have seen any. And that campus meeting the night te- fore·! For pure, unadu1terated college spirit, that had anything else beaten to a frazzle. When some pessitnistic chap, with poor di- gestion sees some student not yelling as loudly as he might, he immediately cries out that the col leg-e has gone to the dogs and that Union spiTit is a thing ()f the past. I think the observation of any 1nan in college will show that while our numbers may be few, our coUege spirit is a thousand per cent pure, and, if be has visited any other colleges, large o-r small, he will notice the difference and realize that spirit like that s:1 common on the Hil1, is an unusual thing in the college world. 01.1r co11ege band deserves a whole lot of credit. They are practicing new music every week and when they lead the singing at games and play Alma Mater, as it should be played, the n1en sing until it vvould seem that their throats would crack. In fact, I consider the college band one of the chief factors in keeping the Union spirit at its present high pitch. But I do want to say a word of warning. I think that the college is becoming divided into cliques, and this is the one thing which effectually kills college spirit. Now, we have only abottt three hundred and fifty men here at the n1ost. If we all pulled together we could do anything we chose. But the ten. dency seems to be to form 1i ttle cliques and ignore those outside our own intimate circle of friends. This would be the worst thing that could happen to the co11ege and we had better stop the evil before it grows any big. ger. ·Let's pull together! Let's forget our own petty little disputes and arguments and remember that above everything else we are Union men. Why not revive the old night- shirt peerades? They may have been shock. ing but they DID help to make U ~ion spirit famous. The spirit in coBege is all right only it has become 1ess ex11berant and less riotous. It is no longer necessary to burn the chapel to celebrate a football victory or mob a theatre when some other Union tean1 wins. If the students would only get toget- her more often for a good old song-fest that would do much to raise the present higb standing of spirit. But above all things, don't be a \knocker.\ Don't go around bewailing the fact that the college is dead. Get out and put a little life into it. Then you won't have time to knock and you will find your own college spirit increasingly strong~ Another Junior. --:0:-- REBUILDING GREEN GATE The Old Green Gate, has after many years of usefulness, given away to a new and modern Green Gate. It was th'ought by many that this famous old entrance on N ott St., had outlived its services and so after in~ vestigation and consideration, the college has erected a gate of modern design. This gate, is in many respects like the present Blue Gate, being semi-circular in shape, having three entrances and being built of stone, wood and iron. These improvements to the gate along witl1 a new concrete wall on Nott Street, add much to the appearance of that part of the college g-rounds.

NOVEMBER 13, 19l2 UNION 1 14 STEVENS 6 Stevens starts 'Strong but weakens af.ter Union takes ;a brace. Garnet ground gains in second period give victory which is:made secure by further score in last quarter ly nion \von a g-lorious victory over Stevens on Castle Hill, at Hoboken Saturday after- noon bv a score of 14-6. ol It \'\ perf€ct football V\reather and the temns met undei n1ost pleasing; circumstances. The field \vas clry and fast and the teams \vere about evenly balanced in regard to \Yeig-ht. THE GAME De-wey 1cic1-ed off to Stevens and the Reds sta rtcd out as if for a frolic. Henry for Steycns ma·de the first gain on a hard drive through the Garnet line and Justin advanced the ball around the end to the t\venty yard line. It seemec1 for a ti1ne that we were up against it, as fne Stevens backs were either rmncturing our 1ine, or aided by interference were circling onr ends, aln1ost at will. At thi~ point of the game, that famous old ''hika yell,'' brought the tPam to their senses and they held, foreing Stevens to punt. Dewey \Yas nnable to find a \veak spot in Stevens' lint= and was ()bliged to kick. Again Stevens began a series of ]1ne bucks and thus carTied the ball \vithjn striking distance of the goal. Seagrave was sent through center for a touch- do\vn but missed an easy try for goal. TEAM TAKES BRACE This touchdown proved to be the thing- necessary to awaken the team, and they lined up with a grim determination to co1ne back. Henry made a poor kick to Union. The Garnet squad settled down to hard work, but lost the ball on a fumble. It was Stev- ens' bal1 and once n1ore they beg~an their ser- ies of long· runs and hard plunges, steadily advancing to their goaL On the next play Union intercepted a for\vard pass, just as the period ended. UNION SCORES In the second period Unio11 began her steady 1nachine-like playing that won the game. rrhere was nothing spectacular in the Union attack while Stevens' gains \vere mostly the result of individual efforts. Bea- ver went in for De\vey at qua1·ter and De\\rey dropped back to half. The Union backs be- gan to tear big holes in their 01)J>Onents line, steadily advancing the ball. Tlle Stevens de- fense could do absolutely notb.-ing against the onslaught of our backs. Time after time we made first do·wn. Dewey then made a forty- seven yard run, which brought the crowd to their feet. Union lost the ball but soon re- gained it, sending Gilbert over for the first count. It was a difficult ang1e so Dewey punted out. Gilbert made a perfect catch of

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS the punt out. Dewey tben booted the ball over the bar making the score 7-6. lTnion kicked off to Stevens, but the half ended \vithout further scoring. UNION SCORES AND IS PENALIZED The second half opened -vvith a11 exchange of punts. Beaver then sent the Union backs through the line a11d around the ends for long gains. In the next play Dewey carried the baU over the line in the n1ost sensational run of the game. The count \vas not allowed however, so insiead of six 13oints \ve were given a penalty of fifteen yards. De\vey then punted and Stevens re- turned the ball by a series of end runs. The period ended with the ball in S-tevens' pos- session in the center of the :field. STEVENS vVORICS FORWARD PASS Stevens put forth their best effo~·ts. to over- come our lead in the forth period, but to no use. They then executed the n1ost successful for,vard pass of the g-an1e. Gain after gain \vas made throug-h the Union d cfense, but lTnion spirit stetned and turned tke destruc- tive -vvork of the Red's backs and Stevens ¥.ras cotnpelled to punt. {Tnion once more rushed the ball do\vn the field, Dewey making the final touchdown. He kicked a difficult goal n1aking the score 14-6. The period ended \Vith the ball in Stevens' territory. GOOD TEAlVI WORK For lTnion; all ~rorked toge:tner, Ruth- steiner and Dewey played fine ball in the backfield while Beaver \vas on the job at quarter. Henry and Jus tin ·were the most prorninent players in the Steven_s line up. NOW FOR HAMILTON The outcome of this g·an1e was veTy pleas- ing to all. The large nun1be1~ of aJn1nni \Vho sa\V the game, showed true Unio11 spirit and cheered the team in a' 'whole hearted'' spirit. Union faces Hamilton Saturday with a n1ost enviable record with six victories to one defeat. This is the big- and the only game of the season that remains on the schedule and as Coach Da\vson says, ''We are going t . th t ' ' N 1 t' o vv1n . · a game. · ow · e s everyone get that spirit, get out for practice of some sort every night this week.

Publication Office: THE NEWLAND-VoN RITTER Co., 149 Clinton Street, Schenectady, N. Y. -------- -- ----- -- -- A NEW PROFESSION Being \Ye11 a\vare of our nnn1erous short conTings in proof reading, \Ve have noted \vith interest that Sir \V. H .. obcrtson Nicoll, a brilliant journalist and critic, has pointed ont clearly the advisability of pron1oting the ne\v profession of proof reac1inR-. I-Iis clain1 is that theTe is a pressing need for the estab1ish- n1ent of a firm \vhich vYi11 correct printers' n1istakes and also revise the author's o-vyn \YOrk. In discussing the idea SiT \V. R. N ico11 says ''a beloved author \vho died latelv has left behind hin1 a book \Vh ich S\V8.rn1s \Yith errors of every ki11cl. Tt1e \Tohnne co1nes from one of the greatest houses in the trade, ancl one n1ar\Tels that it \Yas not subn1itte(1 to a con1pctent scholar before publication.'' 1\ firm like the one sugg-ested \vould eli111- inate n1istakes of this sort and ·would ren1ec1 ,. the great fault of present \vriters \vhich is the lack of verifying the quotations used in their \Yorks. It vvoulcl insure greater ac- curacy 1n many of the standard books to \Vl1ich \Ye naturally loo1{ for correct informa- tion such as the Encyclopedia Britannica. The Atnerican edition of the Encyclopedia contains noticeable errors in the spelling of proper names. l\1oreover, the need of such an estab1ish1nent is urg-ent because the mis- statelnents arc not ah:vays made by incom- petent authors but very often by the n1ore cautious and better kno-vvn literary critics of the day, as for instance the errors appearing in the series ''Eng-lish Men of Letters.'' ''B '' 1 N k . ut, says t 1e . e\v Yor Even1ng Post, ''one's only doubt respecting Sir \V. Robert- son Nicoll's schetne is \vhether the \vriters \Yho n1ost need the assistance of a rev1ser \Youlc1 be \Vi lling to pay for it. Expert scr- yice of the kind sug-gested vvould require a considerable expenditun:~ of tin1e and skill, and \vould den1anc1 a corresponding fee. But an author \vhose literary habits arc slip- shod is not likely to prize accuracy very hig-h- ly, or be \vi11ing to pay for it at its proper value.'' --- :0:--- ARTICLE BY FACULTY MEMBER The Concorc1icnsis feels much indebted to l\Ir.

12 rfHE CONCORDIENSIS WH~A T SHALL WE WRITE ABOUT? The tnove1r1ent to improve the literary (rna1ity of our college paper-a movement \Yhicll has been encouraged by President Rich1nond \vith his accustomed generosity-is especially pTotnising i11 that it has originated, in part at least, in undergraduate circles. In such a n1atter, an impetus given to under- g-rachtate activity \v·holly fron1 the outside can amotJnt to 1itt1e: the vital impulse must cotne fTo1n \Yithin. \iVhen any man is really touched by the desire of Jiterary productive- ness, so1ne 111edium of expression \vi11 ahnost surely be found, if it is only a diary or a cor- respondence \\'ith a friend. For a comn1unity like o-urs the natural n1elliun1 is the college n1ag:az1ne. Those of l1S ''rho are teachers can cJo so1ncthing-, per11aps, to foster that spirit of unrest congcnizd \Yith inte11ectuzd a1n bit ion: but \VC can do 1nore in the \\·a v of helr:£ul g-uidance \vhen once the an1hition is formed. Such an opportunity has been kinc11r g-ranted to n!e be by the e·1itor of the Concorc.Iiensis, ·who has asked n1e to suggest different kinds of literary tasks \Yhich 1nig-ht profitab1y be undertaken in the present con1- petition. ..:\. serY'\icc~ab1e fornnl1a to gu ic1e us in our in- quiry 111ay be found in \vhat Haz1itt \Yrote concE.Tning 11oetry: I I there is no thought or feeling that can have entered into the n1ind of tnan \Yhich l1e \\'Ould be eag-er to con1tnun1- cate to otheTs, or \Vhich they vv-oulcl listen to vdth delight, that is not a fit subject for poetry.'' The 1natcrials nearest to our hands arc jusL those experiences vvhich have left such a fresh and lasting in1 pn;ssion on o1n· n1cn1orics that vve recount the111 in eagerness. It tnay te the ren1en1branceof some quick act by \Y hich a sudden c1anger \\ 7 as averted: it penings could be con1n1unicated by the rig·ht kind of te Bing. '\fherein lies the magic < lf literature: and in the humblest 1niracles of of this sort \vhich we attenl:pt, vve n1ay, lik~ the \vise man of old, use that rod that is in our hancls. I emphasize this point because a consicler- ablr.~ reacling of college magazines has con- vinced n1e that students do not sufficiently value as 1iterary material the kind of life the\T . kno\v at first hand. Gentlen1en adventurers of the (~adzooks tribe, gifted and impover- ished 1nusicians, and frequenters of semi-rep- utable Parisian cafes are altogether to allur- ing to the youthful hnagination. For fiction of the right sort there is certainly a place: but \vhether one, s ain1 is fiction or the c1Ps- crir>tive sketch, it \VDn1cl be \ve11 to Jet the i1na<.dnation play on fan1iliar types of people and snrroundings. Even the college life that is reflected in these periodicals, except \vherc· athletic sports are concerned, is curiously un- reaL One 1night SUJ)pose from reading then1 that a11 successful juniors are society butter- flies to \vhom the cob11ion is the most serious interest in life and the Ivy Hop tbe c1irnax of career. I should like to see son1e co11e,g·e stories in vvhich this affection of s1nartness is laid aside and the really ilnportant things in college arc treatec.1 \lrith dignity and genuine- ness-such things as friendship, the probletn of \vorking- one's \Vay, the difficult choice of a profession I the satisfaction that comes fron1 rccognizcc1 n1crit, t11c pan,g· of unc.1escrycc1 blan1e. Perhaps son1c of you haye reacl ex-Presi- dents Eliot's 1ittJc- book \John C~i11ey,\ \Yhich sho\vs ho\\' effective n1.ay be the sin1ple- cst account of \\rot-thy life.

The incident \vas significant to Dr. Eliot, ancl worthy of record, because it exen11)lified so con1p1ete1y that cheerfuL unquestioning- obedience to duty which is the cohesive force of society. Per- haps no such inspiring of faithfulness unto (leath has fallen under observation; anc1 surely, if it hac1, no one of us could te 11 it in lan,g·uage so si1nple and yet so n1oving- as Dr. Eliot's. But is there not stored in the n1em- 0ry of each one of us, and potent as an in- centive to the ·will and the in1agination, son1e record of a dcec1 \ve11 done, a ten1ptation faced, a hardship endured? I ,voulc1not, of course, irnply that a11 stor- ies or sketches in the Concordiensis should inyolvc a n1atter of conduct: indeed, I \vonld ntter a vvarning ag·ainst that dreadful type of writing w·hich seeks c1e1ibcro.tely to be ''in1- proving. rrhc person of rnora1izing bent, when he essays 1 iteraturc, should heed the : >- c~onncil \Yhich Minerva, in Lo\\Tc11' s p~,en1, gives to aspirants for her fayor: . \Discri1T1inate '' she said, '' bctitncs; The 1\i use is unforgiving Put al1 yo1.1r beauty in your ryhn1cs, Your rnorals in your 1i Y'\ing.''

But ahvays the line be- tween satire anc11ampoon, 1nunor and horse- pLty, n1ust be pn:ser\rcd. 1'he mirth pro- \~olzec1 should be, in (;eorge Meredith's fa- 1l1ons phrase, ('thoughtful laughter.'' Perhaps this list of topics bears an nnpleas- resemblance to a progra1n for freshn1an t11~n1cs, -docun1ents Yvhich, ho\vever useful ~~nd necessary, seldom n1ake exhilarating reac1ing. 1.\'he fact is, any one of these sub·· jects, if handled 1-~· ::. person \vithout literary sense, \vould turn as flat, stale, U11i)rufitable as the oridinarr run of fr~shn18J1 ''dailies.'' I have no desire to force the readers of the ·Concordiensis to share the saddening· toils of of any profession, for t1lere has been dis- covered no surer n1ethocl of blunting one's sensitiveness to s'Ly-:e t~-:8.n a vrolongecl t ex- perience ofthen\1e-rca:li11g.. Ho\v is this mys- terious possession, a 1 iter::ny sense, to be tested or cultivated? 1\!Iost college teochcrs, I think, rcconize that one reason \vhy undergraduates \Vrite so poorly is that their reading of gooc11itcratn rL; has been so scant)l81ld so perfunctory. rrhey l1ave a hazy 1nemory of the fey( ''classics' , reacl in the preparc:tt ory- school; their acqnai n- tance \vith Shakespere is derivec11arge1y frotn La1nb's 'TaJes, their kno\vlege of the Bible fro1n the c~ c:-~icca ted frag1nents of Suncl ay school quarterlies; they kno\v the Barrack Rootn Ballads, ancl verhaps a few stories of Kipling and Poe, and ther are likely to ha.ye con1mittcd to memory a stanza or t\vo of the Rnbaiyat of 01nar Khayyrrn1. Beyond these acquisitions, the Saturday Evening Post and Collier's \Veekly pTovidc t11eir tncntal pabn- 1un1, \Yit11 the occasiona1 less fati_~·uing· c1i\y- ersion of a novel br Mr. Oppenhcin1 or ~~Ir.

The hc1rc1C\st task before the teacher is to break do\:vn the' 'supren1e iceo- latio11'' (to borro\v Lo,vell's pun) in \Vhich the ''classics'' are encrusted in the underg-radu- ate n1ind; to itnpn:s~ students \Vith the tr11th of J.\-li1ton's eloquent vYord~: \For books an; not abso1utely c1e~cl things, but c1o contain a 11otcncy of life in then1 to be as active as tl1al soul \vas \vhose progeny-they-are; nay, they do vrescr\\TC as in a yial the purest efficacy and cxtr~1ction of that liying intellect that brecl then1.', rrhc students \Yill forg-iye 111C, I hope, if in Jny desi rc to point out a general tendency I have described the Ji1ni t of that tendency.

Both Elevens Score Again but Union Steals Vic- tory by Spectacular Field Goal. The football season is over. To Union's credit there are five victories, two tie g-arnes, and one defeat. In the \vinning- game against Hamilton on Saturday, the sixteenth, Union heaped up the hig;ha:st score it has made in any single g-atne this year-fifteen tallies. The ,vhole story of Union's success can be 111·iefly summed up by an expression frorn the Hamilton ,veekly ne,vspaper. '· U ni9n ha.s cotup1eted one of the mcst brilliant footba11 seasons in her history.'' Con1.parisons vvitl 1ast year's series of tn1sfortunes g·ive adc1ecl weight to the statcn1ent. BEFORE THE GAME Shortly before the \vbist1e b1e\V, the Ha.tn- i1ton contingent appeared .and j amed the sec- tion of the bleachers reserved for them. Fron1 across the field, they ~:ooked 1ike a mass of b1·ue; for practica11y e-yery man \vore their specia1blue hat. They too ga\.Te an exhibition of singing- and cheerin.g-, in \--vhich they \vere assisted by a ] ohnst('.Wll band. Then, at t\VO- thirty, the signal s<rundec1 for rHE CA1\[E The grrnet rooters \vere on the bleache1·s a full ha1f-hour before the g-atne started, and g-ave the spectators a sample of Union's abil- ity in sing·ing· and cheering. The band \\.,..~Ls Dev.rey kicked to the yictors, \vho itnmedi- ately beg·an ponnoin_g. But they couldn't make their yards and fhe ba11 \vent to Union.

Thirty seconds later a trht.n1phant shriek fron1 a. blue-clad \varrior announced vvhat had hap- pened. But Hamilton failed to make the goal, so the score stood 6 to 0. UNION RETALIATES Union began to awaken when Starbuck, running under a punt of Dewey's, came with- in a hair's breath of getting the ball, and made one of the best tackles in the ga1ne. The pigskin changed hands quicldy a couple of times after that. rrhe Garnet \Vas ad- vancing by attacks on guards and tackles, vvhen the -vvhistle announced that the first quarter was over. Rig-ht after intermission the same tatics \Vere renewed. Tvvo off-side plays by Hamilton in quick succession brought the ball right \\rhere Union \Vanted it. It took only a plunge or tvvo more, and Dave Beaver's anns \vere over the line \Vi th the ball in them. Dewey's attempt to kick the g-oal resulted in leaving- the score a tie. A COSTLY FUMBLE linion kicked off again. Hamilton ad- ,.,.anced \vith steady g·ains, bnt lost the ball after penetratin,~· far into our territory. Union -vvas unable to make distance and corn- pelled to try a punt. The bail \vas snapped back to De\vev and for the first tilne this - l year he fumbled. A I-Ian1ilton n1an \Yas through the line and fell on the ball. This play left the visitors one yard in front of the g-oal. The blue cheering section soon had ample reason to redouble its efforts, for the ball \vas over the line again. There seemed to be a strang~ fatality about place kicks Sat- urday, for ag-ain Han1ilton failed in its at- tclnpt. Thus the score \Yas 12 to 6, and nothing- occurred for the rest of the half to change the standing of the tY\.To tean1s. Clearly, the first be longed to the visitors. But the second was to e n1on s. b l T • ' INTERl\fiSSON Bet\\reen halves the LT nion rooters as usunl \Yent out on the field and fonned a great lT; and, as usual, they devoted the time ~o sing_ ing and cheering. The Han1ilton :£e11ows also came out on the field, formed a llil:tage I-I sang and cheered. Then they 1nade a \Yild run for the gymnasiun1, \vhence their cheers could be heard aU over the campus. By this time all the spectators., bot11 early and 1ate \:Vere on the spot and formed fhe lar- gest cro'\vd Union has had this year. Every- one was occupied in a tten1pts to keep vvann until all such efforts were forgotten, as the vvhistle announced it was time to see ~<1\Y UNION SCORES AGAIN The only important event in the thir~l pc'r- iod \Vas Union's secondtoucl1do\vn. As soon as Union got the ball, Hutbsteiner dashed through a hole for a five yard gain. Rut Hamilton dre\v up tighter and an incomplete forward pass \vas tried. After that tb:e ball chang-ed hands rapidly a couple of ti1nes. Finally Hamilton intercepted a forwarcl pass and netted a few yards on it. Bnt Vnion \vas to return the compliment in a short tin1e. \Vood, however, -vvas knocked out before anything i1nportant happened. lJnion' s line had tightened, and Hamilton had recourse to a forward pass. It landed snugly in Sar- vey' s arms. He stood dazed for a second, and then started off for his fifty-five yarcl run clo\vn the field over Han1ilton' s goal Jine. not a man stood in his \Vay. Nor did any- thing stand in the \Vay of side-line joy, for hats and n1egaphones \\rere smashed indis- criminately. The fourth failure of the day to kick the goal \Vas hardly noticed by the ju bi- lant G-arner supporters. The score vvas tied, and ren1ainecl so until the encl of the q11.arter.
