Seven football, seven track and six baseball captains have selected Yale as the goal of their studies, and Harvard comes next with six footbc-Jl captains, four track and three baseball. Princeton is to get three captains each in football and baseball and two in track, whil ~ Willi 3.ms gets OI\e in each of the three sports. Of the others two baseball captains are going to Dartmouth, wh] 3 Lehigh gets one football captain and Col.1mbia and Navy come in for one track captain api~ce. Two baseball and two track captains and one football captain have decided that ewy are not going to college.

For s:>metime past and even of late, especially after the football season, it was p=rfectly clear to everyone that s::>m~thing was radically wrong with our teams. This defect rn11st have inevitably come from one of three sources. Our Uni~n spirit must have waned somewhat, or our supply ()f varsity material must _have become very low, or our coaching system must have been faulty. Surely no Union man would adm.it_the :fir~t reason. The student body has always done its best to stay behind the team through thick and thin, through defeat as well as victory. Nor again could it be justly allo¥Ved that from an undergraduate body _as larg·e as Union's there could not be obtained good varsity material. ·Quite· the · OJJ].)osite seemed the case. 011r teams have been made up of individual \stais\, all splendid players separately but

'fHE CONCORDlENSIS 11 ~==~~======~============================================~====-- __;...;: ---- - lacking in team work. None of the teams worked tegether as a machine, and so we must admit the fault is to be found in our coaching system. Our purpose is not to 'C:Ondemn the work of former coaches, but to show r that the newly adopted :system ought to be much superior. Instead of having a coach for each different team, the college win hire one man to coach aU teams. This man will be on:e who has made coaching his specialty, his life work, not a man who will coach this year and go in another business next year; and one who ~s most proficient in that profession. He· will be at the college at aU times and so will become acquainted with an the students and secure the best material. In this way too,. the students will have his system of ·coaching all the while irrstead of changing from one system to another as was the case before. Doubtless he will keep more men in train- ing throughout the year and so cause an increase and great improvement in the varsity supply, besides unearthing much ability now lying dormant. Of course, the adoption of such a system necessitated a considerable increase in the athletic tax but such an increase has been willingly made by the student body because they felt it was for Union's ,good, realizing that it was of ·the greatest imp::>rtance to turn out winning teams both for the securing of good preparatory school men and for the satisfaction of our alumni and ourselves. The students have done their best to bring this new coaching system about, it now remains for the trustees and faculty to approve of their plans. H. '13 <!Iontrihution h~ ~~ ~arl ~£11£r, '07 \Originality in a College Paper\ is the title of an article by W. Earl Weller, '07, contained in the current issue of THE CONCORDIENSIS. Mr. Weller has been connected with the pap~r both as a member of the board of editors when an undergraduate and as a frequent contributor to its colun1ns since. In his article he brings out the neej of co-operation of the student body in order that the paper may be its best. This was urged upon the students in one of the first issues of the paper under the present board of · editors and the article of Mr. Weiler's is a further plea for the backing of the student body that the editors may pro:::luce a better CoNCORDIENSIS. Q Union's victories over Hamilton in debating and over New York Uni- versity in basketball were satisfactory records for a single week.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS ORIGINALITY IN A COLLEGE PAPER W. EARL WELLER, '07 Every newspaper, every magazine in the country is concerned with the solution of a common problem-· How to present in readable forn1 the material the pub- lic wants to read. The great da:Iies and the most specia 1 ized magazines are working at the same prob- 1 ern, but \the public\ which each aiins to reach and to please is different in each individual case. The daily with its large staff of alert reporters, clever cart(:)on- i sts and expert photographers, has for its public aU the thl<:Jusands of people within a day's journey of its presses. The specialized magazine with its one or two devoted editors has for its public only the few people interested in that one s1nall sprout of human endeavor. Now if a paper is to live it must solve this problem of \pleasing the public\. Even. the college paper- unique in n1any other respects-here meets on com- Ill.()n ground with every other publication in the land. 'The colL~ge paper has at once the easiest and the most difficult public to please; undergraduates to whom the published news is old and alumni in far away places who eagerly devour every bit of .college gossip and beg for more; men who revel in outdoor sports and men who find their pleasures between the two covers of a book; men to whom poetry-alas-is a joke and men to. whom a poem appeal3 like a drum beat. All these an::l many others bot1nd together by a common tie-~heir affection for their ccllege, fonn ·the J)Ublic of a college paper and, if the paper is to be the influence, it should. They must all be pleased. Now th.en, how? According to my way of thinking there is just one way of doing this-to make your c::ll2ge paper a true mirror of your college .l!fe wherein every undEr- ~raduate may see himself reflected and every alurnnus may catch gli1npses and n1emoiies of his own four years within the gates of his Alma Mater. This re- :Sult is to be accomplished not by the efforts of two or three, but by the united efforts of all. It is the ten- <lency to sit back in our seats, to let the Board of :Editors struggle with the problem of producing a pre- sentable paper and then, when they finally do bring -forward the result of their work, to grumble about . - now much better we coul:l have done it. Do n :lt say that this is not so at Union. It is. I did it myself . • Let me try to show you, Mr. Undergraduate, h.ow you can hElp your college paper. In the first r:I ace think of the thousand and one funny little things that are happening daily. These things 'lGok: remark- al::ly well in print. Certai,n coli ege pa~w,ers like the ''Harvard L3impoon\ make alm8st a sped alty of thc.·se little \collegegrams\ ani it is surprising- how many times they are quoted in ·other papers to tl~e creei t of the paper that gave thetn birth and of tlle· -coll:::ge that supports it Secondly, there are y0ur \scraps\ ani f0Ur \pranks\ which can be most dElightfully treated ~b your paper. A cold blooded news itern giving date, Ume and casu- alties cannot do justice to a college \scra_p''. It needs imagination. Now I would hate to :think that all originality, all imagination had been crashed out of you three hundred fellows on the \Hill'\. Surdy there must be some on the caapus who can ·see these epi- sodes of college existance in a sufficieutly distorted light to make good reaa:i Ng. A few week.s ago I hap- pened to stumble in the same day on two different descriptions of a stubborn man. One wr]:ter said, \It is i1npossible to budge hjm'=-. The other said, \You can move him abJut as far as you can !k i:::::k a steam roller\. One of these m.en said a comntonplace thing in a comn1onplace way, while the other gave a little freedom t::> hi3 im::1,5ination and pro(l:uced a bit of cl=verness. It was the same thJught but how differ- ent. Now this very thing-. this cleverness-]s the differ- ence between a successful and an unsuccessful ccllege paper. If a paper is cl:ver it is read. You will find yourself waiting for the next issue, cou11ting the days unt] it is to appear. J:f it is merely a paper it will not 1nake any esp:=cial difference t'J yau whether it comes out on Tuesday or on Thun;day or not at all. Cleverness is not diffi~ul t to acquira! Its other name is originality and that is merely be-irig- ourselves. _ yY\hen we talk -vve give a certain turn t() our words so that our friends, even when the words are repeated to them, are able in many cases to recogniz:e us from our words. But when we write-ah, then w-e must pour our words, oursel :res, into a m9l=l so we .se€m to think. It is n8t so. Write as you tal:c B~ your;;el£ always. It is not to be supposed that you always have some· thing t::> say that will be interc3ting to tlJ.e few hun- dred fastidious men, oli and young, that nnake up the \public\ of the \Conc:ordy\, but sttre.ly·- ·just . one thought must occur t~ y-ou a year that is worth elabo- rating, worth printing. Now one thougk t a year from each of you-what will that mean ? W .cU it will mean

This in turn m·eans bliss for your editors and a better paper for you. The editors have enough to do if they manage to corraH the college news and turn it out to you in terse paragraphs. They too must be careful to write them- selves into their work a:1d never consider sliovenly, stereotyped work good enough. It is nevEr good en~ugh. There is always a goal just over there. It is always out of reach but great good 'co~es from the mere effort to reach it. One ,more paragraph and then-good bye. ~sa cO'l- lege pager worth the labor of the 1naking, is it worth a!ll this originality.? D2cidedly yes. Each coH ege must look to its alumni for its supporters. If a college does not turn out :loyal alumni .it is destined to live a cheer- less sort of an existance. But what has a .college paper--successful or ctherwise-to do with the loyalty of the alumni? \Everything in the world\ one might answer. It is your weekly messenger, Mr. Under- graduate, to the one that has gone before. r t tells him what you are doing and he is glad or ashatned as the case may be. Now i£ you were to select a per- sonal messenger to gJ to a frien::l for you-j_:erhaps to ask a favor-you would not pick out any dull-witted, ~L>pp:ily clothed fellow as that messenger, would you? You woulj try to get the brightest, smartest fe.llGw you knew for the j sb. That i3 just exactly what you want your paper to be-bright and well groon1ed. Then. when son1e alumn:J.s reads it he will say '·Tnat's my college, and, by gee, I'm proud of it\ and you will find him readier with his he]p and his encotuagement. The good things of your paper will be noisecl abroad, subscriptions wi] come in, your paper will grow and your college will grow with it. Just a1bw 1n ~ t:> hr:n.-s everything I have said into one sentence. You all want a successful pa.per and I believe t\is se:1ten~e has the ke~note of success- HELP THE CONCORE:Y TO BE ORIGINAL.

Some of_ the greatest in the country have be·en made what they are largely because their gra:l- uates did not bse interest in them when they finished their colleg€ course. The loyalty that is shown only at Commencement time is not particularly val:.tatl~. What is 11eeded is steady and consistent work all through the year. \It shoulJ be the ambition of Union men to have their colleg:e known as one that is conspicuous for the practical byalty of its alumni. It should be their aim to constantly .strive to be of assistance to it. \A conbiderabb gain has been made abng this line of late, of which the organizatiou of the local asso- ciation referred to is one instance. The tnore rapidly it spreads, th.e more rapidly will the interests of Union be advanced.,, Among those present besides the speakers, were: Robert M. FuUer, '93; Vv. C. Vrooman, '78; B. H.

This was the next to la3t le::ture of the series which has been held during the past few weeks. Dr. Munsterberg began by tell· ing of the meeting he had just attended in New York, the purpose of which was to avoid ra:Iway accidents. In this meet~ng the railroad men w.=re appealing to the psychol:>gists to hel;> solve the gr~3.t a:::::ident problem. H ~ next spoke of the use of psychJbgy in adverti3ing, in window disphys and in the salesman's business. The lecturer brought out a number of interesting points along the3e lines, namely, that advertising shoul ::1 be suggestive, that beauty was not always the aim, that success often. depended upon background, color effects and contrasts. An advertisement de- pended for its value upon size, position, repetition and the attention and curiosity it commanded. The lecture was con:L1ded with a survey of the highest :fiel:ls of psychcl )gy, art and science. Refer· ence was made to symmetry and balance in works of art, aho to the effect that the framing of pictures had upon the attention and eye n1ovements. Mention was made of the cbse relation of astronomy to psychology. Dr. Munster berg finished by stating there were anum· ber of fiel.is which might still be discussed by him, one of the most important being the application of psychclogy socially. ,J i

PIANOS HOW SPORTS DRAW STUDENTS 5ome figures latEly dug out of the Harvard attend- ance records show how closely victories en the ath· letic field are rel1ted to gains in the number of s~u­ dents at that univenity. In 1901 1 after a severe de~ feat by Yale on the footbaU .field, 230 freshmen were enrollecL [n the foll:>wing year, after Harvard won, the entering numbered 293. In 1903, after Yale had won again, 24 7 freshtnen were recorded. In. 1905, after both Yale and Pennsy 1 vania had been victorious against the cdmson, only 205 entered. There are simi:lar contrasts for later years. A corresJ)onding reconl probatly could. be found at any other Arneri· can university. Presidents and faculties encourage sports because they draw students. From the points of view of the eli-fashioned scholar this is deplorable. But Inore and more the colleges are setting them selves to the task of turning out well-ro:.tuded men~ ·fit for the battle of life. This ideal is excellent. How· ever, scholars shoul::l always find a congenial atmos- phere in a great university. Undue exploitation of athl.3tics is undoubtedly demoralizing.

Three are classed as \lazy fraternity men, interested in nothing but passing away the time painlessly,\ eight were attempting an im- p0 3sible amount cr kind of work, and the ren1aining nine \should have been engaged in some simple, man- ual labor.\ Of the twenty highest, only one devoted himself to anything outside of his studies, and but two were fraternity men. Those who keep the \activitiesH going are evidently neither the \grinds\ nor the l:lafers.-The New York Evening Post. ---- - ------------- _,._, ______ ·--- B.

T<EAM Score of 27 ~9 Shows Superiority of Garnet Five in Locating the Basket-Victory Due to Short Quick Passeo, ExceUent Defense and Well Directed Th·rows from Field Union closed the basketball season on Saturday with a victory over Colgate. It was a victory far beyond the shadow of a doubt, the sc<Jre being 27 to 9.

Journalism a Profession-Increasing Demand for News- paper Men with College Educa· ion-Courses Now . Established in Many Colleges and Universities Is there a need for .a course in journalism at Union? We believe that those -who are familiar with conditions here will answer in tne affirmative. But first, what is journalism? Stormonth's says that \journalism is the profession of editing or writing fe>r a newspaper\. Only within the past two decades, perhaps, this vocation has been so classed. The rapid advance along literary lines and the uniquely important place that the press has held in the modern history of the civilized world give jour- nalism a right to stand on a level with the three ac- knowledged professioNs ()f theology, law and mejicine. In the past newspaper work seems to have been a stepping-stone to permanent employment. It has been the portals to politic~, secretaryships, foreign em· bassies, etc. This time has passed, however. With course3 and schools of journalism established at many colleges and universities throughout the country it is evident that this is a ,r>rofessio.l. that will soon require as formal preparation as 1 aw and medicine now de- mand. It will naturaHy follow that men specially trained in the work will continue in their chosen vocation. There is an increasing demand for newspaper men. This is stated by edito:rs and publishers throughout the country. But the berm \newspaper man\ does not mean the reporter with a grammar school education, who has worked up frC?Jtn a printer's devil to a news gatherer. The \eight-clolla'r-a-week .. reporter\ is rapidly disappearing and in :his place is found the educated man whose college training demands a salary equal to the average income of other college men. It is the college man that wiH be the reporter, editor and manager of the paper in the future. ALUMNI FAVOR CO·URSE IN JOURNALISM AT UNJO\I Three Distinct Advantages-· Press Club and Stud( nt Publications Bettered-Statements from Alumni The need for a course in journalism might be divid,,~d into three main heads. 1. To assist in the success of the Press Club. 2. To improve the literary style of the student pub- lications. 3. To furnish a course for students who are plan- ning to take up journalism upon leaving college. The Press Club is composed of members who, with an exception now and then, have had no experience in newspaper work of any kind. It is needless to say that with these conditions the organization is working at a great disadvantage. Stories sent out to scores of news- papers weekly are never used, and in all probability the reason in the majority of cases may be attributed to the fact that the style is not printable. The news is not of sufficient importance to warrant revision and -· stories find the short route to the scrap-basket. A course in journalism coulj, at its outset, furnish the fundamentals in newspaper story writing and the looked-for results would be immediately seen. The college publications come in for endless criti- cism of the poor .style of the reading matter, inac- cutacies, and countless other defects, that are seen (even by the editor) at a glance. What can the senior editors do when they are weekly snowed under by a mass of copy turned in for correction, which must slip through their hands with hurried corrections in order that the paper may be issued on time? If every story were verified to avoid inaccuracie~ and were rewritten to polish the literary style (presupposing, of course, that the senior editors are competent to do so) it would be far better to abolish the reportorial board and let the editors assume the entire work. Below are printed samples of stories that have. been turned into the editor as copy: \The attendance at the Press Club meeting last Wednesday night was rather small on ac- count of the weather. Only eleven members being present. Since a quorum was not pres- ent, no business could be transacted and only reports of the con1mittees were given. The new arrangement of sending out bulletins seems to be working quite well, although it has just started. Under this system, bulle- tins of news will be sent out as soon as it oc- curs, and only to papers which will use the news. It is expected that by this plan, more Union news will get into the papers than has been the case heretofore.\ w mat( cati< UJ jour year entE or h and a co . one incr life him for Ir abil con mr 1 Dal Tri

THE CONCORDIENSiS 9· \Thursday January 25, is set aside as a \Day of Prayer.\ There win be service in the chapel at 11 a.m. Rev. Hugh Black of Union TheolJgical Seminary will speak. Mr. Black is one of the most popular lecturers of the present day, he is al3o well known as an au- thor. We con3ider ourselves very fortunate in being able to secure Mr. Black. Mr. Black is Scotch by birth and has been in this country only about ten years.\ Would not a general course In newspaper writing materially aid in the betterment of the student publi- cations? Union has many alumni in the different branches of journalism. In nearly every class for a number of years back there have been graduates who have ,either entered journalism immediately after leaving coUege or have discovered a leaning towards that profession and have taken up the work later. What wou~ld not a course in j 0urnali3m have meant to these men? In . one instance it would have materially aided a ,man to increase his know ledge in what he had planned for .his life work. ln the other it would have discovexed in him ab]ity, which came out after graduation-too late for special preparation in the work. In answer to letters asking opinions as to the ad vis- ability of establishing a course in Journalism at Union come the following replies from alumni now engaged in newspaper work. The first letter, given 1n part, is from G. ~Herbert Daley, '92, who is now sporting editor of the New York Tribune. \In reply to your favor of March 2, can only say that in my opinion the colleges and uni· versities in this country are not doing th.eir full duty without some s::>rt of elective course, or possibly a lecture course, in journalism or newspaper work. The average underg.raduate should at least know the basic principles of news gathering and news writing, apart from essay or magazine writing. There is a vast difference. Union would do well to estab- lish a course of this kind, as I do n8t hesitate to say that a man coming out of college can as a rule earn his keep quicker and surer in the newspaper field than in almost any other line of endeavor, unless perchance he is fairly well preparea for some professional work. \I am glad that you are going to suggest an elective course in newspaper writing and trust that it wi] be approved. I may say, however, that while the way a story is written counts for something, what is in the story counts more, and that Union and Union men must do something of general interest before the pub- licity which is so necessary can be obtained. Your idea has a value far beyond getting a few stories in various papers, as it will pave the way for knowledge which will make for good among the undergraduates. \If y;ou decide on a lecture course I will be glad to go to Schenectady at some time :and read a paper on the making of a newspaper along primary 1ine5, as I did at Princeton a few days ago. . . . .\ G. HERBERT DALEY, Sporting Editor New York Tribune. F. R. Champion, '99, managing editor of the Schen- ectady Union-Star, writes the following on the. need of a course in journalism at Union: \The newspaper field today is not over- crowded with men of ability in that li:ne. Nearly every large newspaper is complaining of the inferiority of its news writers and of its inability to secure enough bright, intelli- gen~ educated and keen reporters. There are plenty of editors but there are not enough men capable of writing news in a clear, C0Jl- cise and attractive manner . \The remuneration for newspaper work has increased very rapidly in the last few years and I believe it presents more and prompter opportunity for the college graduate than any other so-called profession. Union College, I believe, would do well to establish a course in news writing. \I know very well that it is the ambition of most reporters to become editors but I know there is a broader, better, more interesting and attractive field. for new3 writer3. A col- lege education should include a general knowl- edf?:e of the world's history and politics. Fitted with ·such teaching a man is better equipped for newspaper work than one who pick j it up in a newspaper office. \A reporter equipped with the college in- struction I have indicated and with the ex- perience and broadened knowledge acquired in news writing, his contact with the world and his intimacy with passing events make for his becoming eventually valuable as an edi- torial asset. \I believe that a course in new..; writing would be valuable for many students at U n:i<>n College.\ [Signed) F. R. CHAMPION, Managing Editor of Schenectady Union-Star. A lecture course in journalism is advocated by Dud- ley Toll Hill, '07, news editor of the Sche~1ectady Gazette, in the following statement: \While I believe the demand for a course in journalism at Union at the present tim€ is not great enough to justify the College in g.J- ing into the matter th.:>r .)Ughly as some other educational institutions now do I feel certain that an opportunity of obtaining an elemen~ (Continued on page 12)

Publication Office The N ew-Hes-Mor Printing Co., Schenectady RaHway Waiting Room Building, 420 State Street 11Iast ~ssuc of tqc Japer ~unhr Jrtstn± ~narb With this issue of THE CONCORDIENSIS the senior members of the editorial board relinquish control of the publication. It is with a feeling of no little regret that our retrospection over a year's labors exposes many ,-~ shortcomings and that with the possibilities contained in the college weekly we have failed to reach the goal that seemed so easily attainable at our entrance into office twelve months ago. We have had the full share of un- favorable criticism accruing to the managers of a paper that is placed before the critical public for inspection. Much of this criticism we have doubtless deserved, and yet, some, we feel, has been made without just cause. It is needless to say that we have done our best and we feel that apologies and excuses for our failings are out of place. The new board of editors assumes control of the paper at the beginning of the spring term. The junior members have been named and it is with

• 'l'HE CONCORDIENSIS 11 - .... - -~... -- -- - . - -- -~--. -- -- -- -----~-~-- the belief that the resp~ctive offices h:1ve been fiRed \Vith the right men for the right places that we turn the management over to the editors for the ensuing year. At the beginning of the fall term the business management of THE CONCORDIENSIS comes under the control of the Undergraduate Publi cation Board. This means that the financial side of the publication vvill be so managed that there will be a sum of money at the disposal of the editor that will be sufficient to make many needed :irnprovements possible. It would seem that the future of THE CoNCORDIENSlS was never mc~e prom- ising than at the present time. There is one means of effecting a score of improvements in the paper that we connot leave without mentioning editoriaUy, even thongh it is the very evident th~me of this issue. Not until the :members of THE \CORDIEN- srs board have been trained in a special course of journalism wiU the poor literary style, inaccuracies and mis-statements be eliminated. Essay style is not CoNCORDIENSIS style any more than it is newspaper style. News must be written up to allow \parjng\ to fit space without effecting the sense or style. In other words the main facts or the climax, call it what you will, must not appear in the last paragraph, as in the essay style, for that is where the \ paring \ begins. The story is in the first paragraph and the succeeding paragr;::tphs contain an elaboration of story in the form of details. This and other details of newspaper work could be taught by a course along news- paper lines. And contrary to the belief of many, newspaper style d9es not exclude the ability to write essays any more than the writing of orations injures one's essay style. It is simply another branch of Hterary expression. 06 ~pnln_s~ ~tte ®ur ~eabers~ We wish to apologize to our readers, who are not interested in the sub- ject of journalism, for crovvding out matter of perhaps greater interest and forcing upon them this avalanche of journalistic data. We believe it is for a good cause and think that even our disinterested subscribers may find some facts that will cause surpris~ if they are not acq-uainted with the ad- vance that has been made in newspaper work in recent years. In the College World At the State Agricultural College of K.ansas an ex- atnination in s·pelling brought forth some inter- esting facts. N·o words were given the students that are not contained in tte fifth grade public school readers.

At Michigan the plan to build an infinnary is meet· ing with fav-.orable com- ment from the faculty as well as the students.

12 THE CON·CORDIENSIS tary knowledge of the subject should be af- 'forded those students who may desire to study it. \Newspaper men are born, not made. And there are comparativEly few of them. It therefore seems t()· ,rne that a course of a dozen lectures given during each year, by trained newspaper men, to members of the junior and senior classes, who are considering journalism as a possible profession, would be of considerable vallue. The members of the junior classes Vl()Uld learn, briefly but thoroughly eno-qgih., what newspaper work really is, and those who decided they were unfitted for it.could then give it up. Those who were interested would be able to pursue those studi,es most \helpful to them during the senior year, and could be further instructed in newspaper work. \What the profession needs n1ost is more real nevrspaper men properly trained. For them there is a great opportunity. At the present time too ·rn:any have drifted into it, found it interesting~ and remained, although lacking ability to itnprove the standard of the profession, or to work their way to the top. \I believe that i.f more of the intelligent men's thoughts are turned in the direction of journalism,. and its opportunities are made clear to them, man~y who are fitted for this profession, but wh() would otherwise drift along in other walks of life, would take up the work, and thus benefit the profession, as well as make thei1r future successful. The work is hard, and e:xacting, but it .offers a re- ward which is worth consideration.\ [Signed] DUDLE\Y TOLL HILL, News Editor Schenectady Gazette. ~ FAVORS COLLEGE JOURNALISM Editor of Brooklyn Daity Eagle Says College is Better Than a Newspaper C ffice to Study Journalism Dr. St. Clair McKelway, editor-in-chief of The Brook- lyn Daily Eagle, has written the following article for The Yale News on the ·subject of journalism: \The subject of n .. ewspaper making or jour- nalism is one about which newspaper m-en in it do not often write. Journalism is a thing apart and when it is not, those, who seek to pursue it as a step to or toward something else, do not let the root of journalism pene- trate the soil of their minds. They are not zlways to blame, for what is not in them will not or cannot com.e 0ut of them, and can with difficulty .be put in th-em to stay there. \I am far from saying, however, that jour- nalism cannot be ta\.lght in a university. It can be, and in cases. it is. Swift perusal and quick restatement of reading matter can be taught. Estimate of the important ()r the trivial in events can be trained. Enors of such estimate can be pointed out by those who know m()re about them than students can be presumed to know. The overt or the suggestive form of statement can be culti- vated. The l'ealization or the suggestive rorm of statement can be cultivated. The reali- zation of striking forms of ex:pressions as dis- tinguishabl2 from the duH can be encouraged. The plain duty of seeing occurrences i1n their wholes instead of merely in their parts ean :be both inculcated an.d i'ltistrated. In a college class room this can be doae. In a newspaper office this must be done. \A ·college is :a better place for preparatory fittedness for j:ournalism than a newspaper office is for C<lllegiate instruction, and a cui· tivated professor is a better monitor :and a more considerate inciter than an editor or a news manager when either one o:f then is more intent on going to press quickly than on being courteous, or patient, or considerate of the sensibilities -of others.'~ .. g AUTHORITIES ON JOURNALISM ADVOCATE COLLEGE TRAINING Special Courses in Newspaper Work Should be a Part of Every University a:1'd College is Consensus of Opinions Lack of space prevents the printing of articles in full which show beyond a doubt the need of a course in journalism in the universities and colleges to-day. But reference to some of them with a few abstracts may give a slight idea of the seriousness vvith which the subject of college journalisn is ·taken b>-day. In the Atlantic Monthly for January, 1911, Herbert W. Horwill is the author of an article \Trainin of the Journalist\. Mr. Horwill was a former minister in England. Resigning from the ministry he took up journalism and is now associate editor of ·the Forum and a member of the review staff of the Nation. Quoting in part fr()m his article we print the follow- Ing: \In the days when men drifted into journal- ism nothing was heard of any special schools for the education .of the journalist. You do not need lessons in navigation in order to drift with the current. But its recognition as a distinct profession has given journalism a right to a chapter in books on 'What To Do With Our Boys' and there are young men in college who of malice prepense are intending to adopt it as a life-career. NeT.v.spaper- writing has thrown off much of its ancient Bohemianism and become respectable ·. . \It ·is not surprising, \then that the questicn should be asl{ed: If the older professions, t t

]'HE CONCORDIENSJS 13 such as law and medicine, tra;n their novices in special schools, why shouU not t:1is new profession provide its recruit3 with ·oppor- tunities of technical preparation? \Whatever the particular curriculum fd- . lowed, it is essential that the education given be of a disciplinary quality. It must .quicken the intellectual conscience to the point of dis- gust with all scamped work, and of readiness to take pains in securing exactness of date or quotation; it must strengthen the nerves of the mind to grapple with subjects that are not superficially attractive.\ Mr. J. E. G. de Montmorency in the London Con- temporary Review writes: '' . . . In the case of certain editors and certain very well known journalists there can be no doubt that a deliberate effort is made to prevent the fouling of the [literary] well which is now taking place. But this is not true of the press generally. . \ Co·mmenting on this the Review of Reviews for Sep- tember, 1911, says: \The solution of the whole problem is in the hands of the journalists. In all other pro- fessions severe tests are imposed before a man or woman can practice. In journalism 'every quack is allowed to impose his quack- ery on the public'. No man or women should be allowed to exercise the profession jour- nalism until he or she has passed a searching examination in English literature and ,in the use of the English language.\ \The Place of Journalism in University Education\ is an article by Edwin E. Slosson, Ph. D., 1 iterary editor of the Independent, in which he clearly defines the need of college training for journalism. He writes, \Instead of asking if a university can afford to intro- duce journalism it should be, can any university af- ford to get along without_ it?\ In the North An1erican Review for May, 1904, Joseph Pulitzer writes at length on the practicability of a journalistic course for the college and university. He goes into the details of newspaperwork and shows that journalism is better learned in theory at college first than learned by practice only in the newspaper office. An article entitled \College Training for Journal- isln\ by Frank W. Scott, associate professor of E11g- lish at the University of Illinois and in charge of courses preparatory to journalism for several years. contains the following: \That the colleges should undertake to pre- pare students for journalism was as in- evitable as the idea of them doing so should be condemned by many journalists who got their training in another way. Journalism has long been a professon tbat every one out of it couilc.l improve ifhe -were in it.

Just now a number of students are interested in journalism. The Press Association,. and increased interest in 1'he Laurentian and The Hill News, are concrete results of their efforts. lf the new course proves such a success as it well may, and if the pres- ent interest in j.ournalism is maintained and, as ought to be the case, ii).creased, the present course may be just the beginning of a thorough course in journalism St. Lawrence has sent out men who have climbed to the top in the newspaper world,-and that, too, with- out any special preparation for it. Undoubtedly many of the students in future will aspire to journalism, and it will be a great benefit to them to nave a thorough course in preparation for this-·and with such a course could be coupled something of the nature of labora· tory work, such as is now obtained in a small way by memb2rs of the Press Association.
