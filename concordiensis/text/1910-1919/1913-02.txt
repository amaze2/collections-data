EUCKEN On Monday nig-ht in the Co11eRe Chapel Professor Eucken delivered a lecture on the '' Philosophy of Goethe ,., Professor Eucken rernarkecl that although Goethe dicl not pro- fess to be a phi1osop1rer, he expressed thro11.~.d1 his literature a remar1{ab1e philosoph~· of life. On this, \Goeth~'s confession of faith,'' as he tern1ed it, ' ' the g·olden age of c;efman literature 1 I cuhninated • Goethe sought to g-rasp the relation of 1nnn's life as a \Vhole to the nniyerse, in which the nature of 1nan is developed by contact with the universe, to which he in turn must give up something fron1' his inner- tnost soul. Because of this the universe re- flects the \\'Or kings of the soul. In obedi- ence to the la\VS of the ·universe success is attained. Goethe's great power, said Professor Eucken, lay in seeing and acknowledging, ''God in nature and nat11re in God.'' Nature presents a certain invisible continuity ex- empt from all sudden transforn1ation. Let man do what he V\ri11, he n1ust return, finally, to the path of his nature. Goethe embodied this idea in his literary characters, \vho adhere strictly to their individual natures. Each ln11nan aton1 shapes its O'Nn life in its own \Yay, yet all are integral parts constantly seeking and binding adjnstn1ent. In spite of constant activity, ho\veyer, there shonld be a sort of repose, lest life lose its significance, through one mere1 y engendeTing another. Goethe sought to emphasize the value of in- ner communion, for, he says, external forces exhibit themselves only vvhen absorbed by the soul. It was by projecting- his own soul and spiritualizing the ·world about hin1, said Professor Eucken, that Goethe vv~orked ·out his O\vn salyation and '~ras impelled to express himse1f by literature. But higher than natn re, Goethe felt, stands art. He took art as the very soul of life and asserted the independence of the soul. The greatest work of art is a n1an' s life, wr Or de· fo1 of 111 r-r th de . gT \V( lll en 111 of JC' Y1 1X p1 tll sc . 11 l oi p h: . 1r ti tl tl t1

( )ne cannot attain the inner soul \vithout \von- der, adrniration, and reverence; reverence for aH that is abor·c, around, and beneath 11s. -\ -\ -.: 0:--- THE SECON;D LECTURE Professor Eucken gave the second 1echJre of the Ichaboc1 Spencer Foundation cou1·se in the College Ch ape I on rl'uesda~· e\~cning·. I-Iis subject v\Tas \ Idealistn and Realism in the Nineteenth Century.'' He outlined ihe development of each of these 1110\'emonts, giving their orig-ins. ai1ns and prog-ress fn ihe \VOrld. In beg-inning he described idenl isn1 as orig-- inating in Geni1any and spreading over the entir~ civilized \VDrlcl. Men, living free ft-~ 1n n1ateria1 fetters, forget the caTe and n1is ery of everyday life, reg-arding as their main ob- ject the c1eye1op1ncnt of spiritualistic 1ncli- yidna1 ity. ;.J ext he told of a rea1istic reaction i 11 ov- position to the first, \\Thich \\·as originally rr- pressed in Germa11). bnt \vhich fina11y \\ .... cnt through all eiFi1ized nations.

PROFESSOR EUCKENS' LECTURES Professor Eucken, often Teferred to as G€r- ma?y's greatest living man, \i\·as greeted C()r- dial]y on both Monday and Tuesday evening·s as he entered the Colleg-e Chape1 to de1hrer those lectures on ''Goethe as a Philosopher\ and ''Idealism and Realism in the Nineteenth Century.'' The talks were uniquely inter- esting, instructive and scholarly and fastened upon the distinguished lecturer the constant attention of the audience which filled the seats, aisles and every available spot in the Chapel. It is not our purpose to discuss or give an account of these pbilosophic ad- dresses, that has been attended to in anotl1er part of the paper-but we do want to encour- age those students. who have been indiffert. nt to their great opportunity of hearing Dr. Eucken to atone for their thoughtlessness by attending the next two lectures, ''A Defense of Mora1ity\ and \Philosophy and Religion'' vvhich wi11 be deHvered on February 17 and 18. \Ve ask this of yon, not that your pre- sence is at a]J necessary to he]p make an audience, but, because it is to your own per ... sona1 advantage to absorb, as far as possible, tb.ese talks that abound in educational values. It is a decided favor to the coJlege to have Professor Encken visit us. He has visited several of the prominer..t. :instit11tions of the country and in every- instance has been greeted \vith unlimited apvlause and enthu~ s12sm. At Syracuse, the audience arose as a whole, and after many mingled shouts of \Veleo1ne all joined in a long Syracuse cheer for the foremost German scholar. As most of us know, Professor Eucken and Pro- fessor Be-rgson of France, are the leading philosophers of the day and surely therefore, \Ve tnnst realize that Union is honored by the presence of a man of Professor Eucken' s stamp and we are not ' ' np to the times '' if . \Ve disregard this opportunity for interesting enlightenment \Vhich is knocking at our ovvn door. ---: 0 :------- THE. CORNELL DEBATE Along a similar line is the de bate with Cornell on Friday night. It ought not to be necessary to urg·e the student body to appear in force that evening- because all of us knovv we want to mal{e three straig-ht victories over Cornell and should be anxious to se_e our hope realized. As in athletic contests, so in de bating vvork, student attendance lends encouragement and vim to the 1nen \vho rep- resent the College and stirs then1 on to greater efforts. The Ithacans are sending- the biggest \var- n<r tba llp< ref the to 11c ha- an on 111E ac1 w1- w1- th1 col tht 1e~ l'll po El tri Bt he I \'1

THE CONCORDIENSIS 11 riors of their debating can1p against ns, but that doesn't dishearten us any or n1ake us 1nse confidence in our O\V11 braves. We look 11 pon the situation in the Hg-ht that it \¥ill reflect the 1nore credit upon Union if she takes the scalps of the Corne11 Chieftains, and so we \vi11 enter the battle \Yith this thought forctnost in our n1inds. ---:0:-- FRESHMEN, ATTEND COLLEGE MEETINGS By request ,,~e ntake a brief ~tppca1 to to the first year 1nen not to bolt chapel on 11onday noons. Of late the freshman ranks have been noticeably thin at co11ege 1neetings and this is a practice which is not loo]{ed up- on favorably by the student body. At college n1eeting we receive the report of all college activities and discuss n1atters pertinent to the whole student body. Here the subjects in which there is a difference of opinon, are thrashed out and many \\·eak points in our college life are corrected or, in short, it is the place \vhere \Ve foster l~ nion spirit. Need- 1ess to say, freshn1en can't begin tuo early to cultivate true ·union spirit. ---:0:--- DR.

V'l e haye unt to look at the pictures of the usual, ne\vly constructed co11egc building- to see ho\v bare and desolate its snr- rond ing-s are in the absence of trees. The tra:ttsition from nature to the 1nan made struct11re is too abrupt. We are losing many of our trees. The recent high \vinds O\\er- turned some of our largest and disease has tal{en. off man}' more. Several of the frater- nities, in fact, are ahnost ab1e to keep then1- selY€S supplied \vit11 fire v;ood from the trees \vhich die around their houses. So far, vve have not felt this loss so much because of the abundance of trees. But ·while they n1ay die in a year or two, it requires decades to re- place them. 'Vou1d it not, therefore, seem advisable foT the spring tenn class in forestry to eon1 bine son\1e practical tree planting V\Ti t h their study of the identific:ation, character- istics and uses of trees? It is is not a very diffic-ult matter to gTO\V many trees from the seed and as n1ost of the members of the for- estry division are sophomores they \vould be here long enough to witness sotne results. Again; many evergreen varieties may be purcl1ased from the state for less than a cent a piece. The location and the planting of these as well as the knowledge of the ease \vith which it ntay be done will. be valuab1e to tb.ose who wish to beautify their o\vn cotn~ tl}Ufi. ities w bile at the same ti1ne our campus will be so 1nuch the better off for their action.

,. '' ,. 14 THE CONCORDIEN·SIS REAL COLLEGE SPIRIT For such intercollegiate discussion as takes the form of, \the character of the best col- lege spirit,'' the relative merit of large and small colleges is a never-failing topic. I maintain that a college is the better for be- ing small and pass at once to the strongest argument of the small coUege-the argu- 1nent that in it everybody kno\VS everybody else, and that consequently, \vhile the whole community may move as one man, the inc1i- vidual is never ignored. In a sn1a1l college the student who would be a recluse at a larg-e university is literary dragged out of his den to see football - or even to play it - and is humanized thereby. The spirit that brings all the students of a college together for a common purpose, the undivided enthusiasm of a whole college, is one of the precious ex- periences of education; for even when to middle-aged people the cause seems triva1, the spirit is patriotism to a common: cause. Human fellowship-the foundation of true college spirit, the real and great and perma- nent blessing of college life. Most every- knows, that if a man is interested in any- thing outside of himself, he \:vi11 get human fellowship in college, if he is not, he \vill not get it anywhere and the college spirit that exists will be that much better off without him. 'rhe best friendshi-ps are based on com- mon interest in work. Editors of a college paper, debaters in a college team, in athletics -or even by students working side by side in a laboratory. The relation between the student and pro- fessor can make or break college spirit. The relation between student and faculty is the best in a small college for the number being small affords a chance for close re1ationship. The best possible college spirit exists ,;vhen everyone works for a common good, as said before, and between these two bodies Df a college ought to exist a common cause, each striving to better the conditions of the other. The student should accept all the opportuni- ties offered him by the faculty---- such as cal- ling---where topics should be discussed in a free manner---if about co11ege activities, the professor, perhaps is enlightened on the student's viewpoint, and the student on the professor's viewpoint. Athletics has a tendency to play a more and more imporhlnt part in our college spirit of today, for one must grant that by athletics the good old spirit is aroused in alumnus, undergraduate, faculty member and to-vvn of \\vhich the college is a part more than any other stin1ulus. Older people can hardly ap- preciate the stimulus to every po,ver of mind and body in a great athletic contest. Here is work jn which youth itself is an advantage, in which the highest honor may be won by a young man who has missed all earlier op- portunities for doing anything- as well as he knew how, here :is a fresh chance to show what stuff---mental and physical---he is made and a cause that appeals to youth. I dwell on foot ball because its hold on a college is often misunderstood by persons who think of it m~rely as a brutal, tricky and sadly exaggerated pastin1e and not, in spite of its evils, as a test of generalship, physical and moral pro,vess, quickness of bodv and tnincl: and becau.se it is a good il1ustration of a visible and practical purpose, ~'crossing the enemy's goa.l line,\ fired by an ideal, '\the honor and glory of a col1ege.\ ~rhe full strength of college spirit does not come to a man until years after his graduation; but he knows something of it -vvhen he lines up beside his old college enemy. As years go by, his love of coJJege becon1es second to his love of OC)Untry. The college becomes more and more a human being-, for \\:vhom it is an honor to \1Vork, live and die. Indeed, every man who has once taken her name is in some sense bound to vlork, to 1ive, to die for her. In hu siness, in politics, in religion, in everything, it is she who cheers him, as he struggles to bold his standard high. He who devotes himself to the rounding out of his O\vn po,vers may he good for nothing, wh lo\ 1 n1r 1111 alt his car he1 l eo ;:.., lfi thE qu .

P. l. 8 •. ' ·«-- Garnet Quintet Ov~r~helms Trojans in first renewed relationship garne and gains the sixth\ straight victory of ~the season. For the first time in· seven years, the Union and R. P. I. tean1s n1et to contend for honors as basketball tossers. Naturally, the feeling and interest in this gan1e \vere at fever heat. The R. P. I. 1nen 'catne over here with their n1any follo\vers, with the. determination to shovv us, that they had only the friendliest feeling toward Union, and the Union sup- 1)0rters ·were just as anxious to treat R. P. I. on the square. Both teams practised hard I for th~_game and·both.were equally anxious to ~rin, this later fact i~eadily accounts for those fouls called in the forty 1ninn tes of the fastest kind of basketball seen here since the o1c1 days' of the sport. · · THE AUDIENCE 'rhe game \vas scheduled for 3:30 p. 111. but long ere this the anxious ones began to 1nake their appearance. By three o'clock the student bleachers 'vere filled and every reserv- ed ~hair \vas taken, then the crowd surged to the box office, through the doors and hurried for their seats. For fu11y half an hour, the throng poured in atnid the hearty cheers and . \:\ . f the loyal songs of the, two colleges. - Eac]il side tried its best to: excel the other and as a \ • ~ 4 :t result, the ,cheers Were StJ.appy and full o\f . ' . ginger. The college.band was there ~n all its glory; in fact, nothing was lacking. No one could help being interested in such· a game~ amid such an assembly. e • Both teams received thunderingapplatJse a~ . . they put in their~app~arance for -preliminary practise. The fives ·were in splendid physical . . . condition and the results of the tedious nights of practise were evident. In \Veight t()o, th'¢ . . te9-n1s were remarkably well balanced and everything pointed to a hard, fast game. THE GAlVIE Pron1ptly at 3:30, the players toq:4 theit respective positions, each man ''s\ tiervE; \strung \Vith great exciten1.ent; but their agony WaS lengthened just_ a 1nomen't, in order that the Concorc1iensis .tnight obtai~ a picture of the n1en as they were about to begin this mucn coveted g·a1ne. This inotnent uf <.1uiet \vas sud~ de111y interrupted by Referee ~ilden · s \vhist1e and the tecnns came together -vvith a clash. T'here was one grand mix up and then Captain~ Beaver, popped orit ·of the s~rugg1ing n1ass,· and dropped the leather pil1 into the basket for the first ta11y of ·the ga1ne. LT nion, then started right out for the gatne with a but~st (.)f speed that be\vildered their opponents and and kept thetn ~la\Vlllg- the air for a fe\\' min- utes. In another thirty seconds, Daye, \Vhu .. ·.- ' . ,.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS had he~retofore played forward, popped up frotn his position at guard and duplicated his shot. 'J'his was a little too much for the wearers of the cherry and black, and in their efforts to stop the work of the Union players, they overstepped the rules and were penalized 'vith two fouls, which Houghton cleverly turned into two more points for Union. With tile score· 6 - 0 against them, tte Trojans realized that they were up against \' 1 a rea team\ and then ensued some the R. P. I.'s score, bt1t Houghton didn't like this idea so he dropped in another and then on: a free throw made the score 9 - 4 in our favor. But Dewey, decided that a senior sbould share in the honor of winning the game for Union and came across with four of the prettiest and cleanest shots of the game in the same number of m-inutes. The only reason he didn't keep on, was because the ti,mekeeper' s watch said nay. At this time the score was 17-4 in our favor. The R. P. I. and lJnion Sqads taken just before the \vhistle for the game of the prettiest pass-work seen on the Armory court this season, but it was all done under Union's basket, for our defense was as a stone wall to their forwarcls. Union fou1ecl and McManus made the shot good and a minute after the toss up, he succeeded in evadin.g- his man and shot a pretty basket frotn mid-court. Woods was caught hold- ing and his error added another point to SECOND HALF As the players can1e back on the court a·fter their tbrief breathing SJ.)ell, they were \vannly greeted. on all four s1ides by one of the mo6t enthusiastic audience known in the history of local spoPbdon1.

SIXTH STRAIGHT 'Thus Union annexed its sixth straight vic- tory, and it is no exaggeration to say that Union is represented .by the fastest tean1 in her his- tory. ~ot only can the players open fas·t but they are able to vvear do\vn their opponents and close just as brilliantly. Victories o'rer Colgate, Rochester and \Villiams on strange eot:trts are achieven1ents vvell vvorth talking ahout. Add to these the three wins over Swarthn1ore, Pratt and R. P.

The debate V\'i th Corn en has come and gone and is novv among the things that are beyond courtesy of Hanigan's reibuke \vas a thing to rernem·ber wi)th pride in o·u.r rnen. VV e have ~ehe11 no·thing to regr·et so far as our toan1 is concerned. They exhibited once 1nore the best Union traclitqons. If we sho:Jlj dra \V any n1oral and any advice as to the future it \\'oulcl be C'{)ncer-ning the subject of ~the cle- bate and the judge.;. T'he suhject of the debate was the ~oose­ V('ltian policy of subjecting certain constitu- tional quest·ions to a popular vote. This policy has ~aroused strong feeling, and we are credit- ably inforn1ed that at lea$1t one of the judges expressed hin1scl£ as unalterably opposed to the affirmati-ve. It n1ay very \vell be that another judge \vas as unalterabl_ .. ; in favor of it, hut evidently 1the dehate could not proce·ed impartially under such conditions, and it was hardly vvorth while to have it take pla•ce. The outcon1e of the contest, in any case, seen1ecl to sho-vv clearly either that :3Uch a subject is not a suitalble on·e for deibar.te, or else that judges in such a c~ase ought to be ·chosen with changing. It h·as left, ho,v-ever, a certain extren1e careQ an1ount of soreness behind ilt,. and it may not ---:~o:--- be atniss to revie\v the situation, and, per-haps, to draw a moral. Tlhe teams did not seen'1 evenly matched, either in debating power, or, it n1ay be added, in •courtesy. In 'both, Union seetned clearly superioi-, and the decision for Cornell came \v]th a shock of surprise nort ·0111y to the audi- ence, but, :we are credibly inf.onned, to the 1najority of the Cornell team. We are, accord- ingly, proud of our n1en, both for their de- bating a!bilities, and, not less,. for their digni- fi·ed and very effective hearing and reply in me·eting the behavior of 1t'heir opponents, vv ho seemed \vvilling to adopt qttestionatble tactics to stave off their expected •def eat.

The renewed interest in debating ·vvas evident fron1 the unusually large n·umber of stu-clents .contesting f·or pla,ces on the teams. The question for debate is: \Res·olved That ·the present high ·cost of living in the United States '\vould be materially decreas·ed by ·Vhe a•dopti'on of ,a 'Tariff for Revenue Only.' \ Two teams were chosen to represent Union. The affirn1atjve team, \vhich \vill go to Clin- ton, N. Y., to debate againsit ·Ha-tnil'ton on Feb- ruary 27, is as ·fnll-o,·vvs : Theodore W.

Tro1nper '13, alternate. Althou•gh the two tea,ms chosen are consid- ered the n1ost fonniclaib1e to represent Union, there were several other ex-cellent candidates in the contest ·who did nort ·win places on the t·eams. A challenge ha·s been received f liOn1 NevY York University, \;vhic'h is very desirous of ~meeting Union in a single debate, or of join- ing the tri-league arrangetnent. N·o definite aJction has as yet been taken ·by 1the debating council, but it is .dou·btful \vhether the debate can ~be arranged, this year at leas·t.

CON:CORDIENSIS ·o·EBATE AWARDED TO CORNEL:L · ··On F·riday, Fe;bruary · 7, in the ·College Chapel, Union rwas d.~feated in· the annual CorneU debate for the first time in three years. The question und·er dis·cus.sion was taken from tJhe Progressive platform of the last election and is one of the \latest phases of our mo1dern poli ti·<:al situation. The proposition was, \Resolved 'Dhat when an act passed under the poHce pow·er is held ·UHdonstitutional under the State consdtution hy ~the ·courts, the peopLe, Cl!£ter an ample interval· for deliberation, S 1 ~a11 -have a:h ~~portunity to vote on the question \vl~efller rl1ey desire the act to becom-e a la'\V n~:t:w ithstancling such decision.\ The Union de!haters, arguing for the affirma- tive,- were· H11bert l\L Mann '13, Donald A. ,Coulter '15, Theodore W. I-Ianigan '13 and Robert F. Payne '13 alternate. The Cornell debaters, supporting the negative, ·were Harold Rie~lem.a:n '14, Al,bert H. Henderson '14, H. G. Wilson '12 and alternate, William D. Smith '15. The :first speaker for ·the affir•mative ex- plained the subject, . giving the definitions limitattions; et:c., o~f the debate a)]JJd outlined the clisc·ussion for his ~ide. . The first negative speaker, using destruc- tJv~ argum~nts, stated that in order ·DO maintain its -oon 1 b~:ntion,. the affirn1ative would have to show h~~ the propo~ed pl~n ·was an advantage o~er the ·pr~·se~t system, and just how it ·would he .. ~pplied to . oveflcon1e the existing evils. ·The. third Union speaker sfuowed the un:cer- tainty -of the present metl:rod of r·etned ying ·defecits, na.me1y, by am-end·tnent to the State <:o1nstitution. He als'O showed that by the new system, tlhe ·de.cision o·f ·the f ersistent majority w10uld determine the li1nitations of its own lib- ·erty, anld thus many evils in the present method ·would be eHminat·ed. ;T!h1e •last ·speaker for ·Corn..ell C 1 hallenged the point that the few cases -ci tetd by the affirma- tive pr'Ov·ed con·clusive t·he errors in the present system. He further showed bo•w the proposi- tion of the affif'ma1tive wo~uld destroy the stability of ~he courts. · The rebuttal, like ,the ~ma.in argument, was 'Spirit·ed and w·e11 contested. Both sides gave · w·ell defined and logitca•l re.fu.tati~ons. The stdk- ing poimts ·vvef'e revie\v·ed and argum~ents w•ere preseruted in a ·cl·ear, fqrcefnl n'lanner. The judges of award ·were: G. S. Do-wning, Ph. D., Albany, N. Y., Frank B. Gil,bert. E·sq., Al1bany, 1~. Y., and Fra:nk 'TaLbot, Esq., Glov- ersv:ille, N. Y. Their decision in favor of Cor- nell, \va·s bas,ed on the merits of the ·argum•enlts and their presentation, and not. up01n the n1erits of the question. Both teams w·ere com- n1,encled upon 1their good work, and it ·was a.din1itted 1that ~he burde:n 6,£ proof resting on the skle of th~e affirma6v·e, n1ade it much the harder side o-f the debate. The delivery of the •Cor11ell de:baters was de- •cicle'clly forcef.u!J. Hovvev·er the general bear- ing and ·delivery of the Union men WqS more pl1easing and fully as convincing as 'that of our opponents. The second speaker for the affirmative showed, by citil11g i 1 nstances, bow the funda-· mental liherties of the ·people ·were violated under the present systetn, and horw the estab- lishment of the pt 1 oposed plan would elin1inat·e ---:o:·--- The effort of the Union students to abolish Kappa Beta Phi seetns 1~at11er strange, es· pecia11y because of the charge that the society ridicUles learning.

The Concordiensis VOL. 36. FEBRUARY 20, 1913 No. 14 Union 38, Colgate 2'1 Garnet Five Cinch State Champion- ship by Defeating Colgate for the Second Time This Season Last Friday night's gan1e encled in the us- ual ,vay, w·ith Union in the lead, but before the game started, the spectators \\vere a 1i ttle doubtful 3;b~n1t the outcome. 'I'he Maroon quintet .surely dicl give a. fine exhibition of rea1 basketball \vork; the players could shoot, pass and make free thro\YS in splenclicl style. Of course, our n1en \vere on the floor too, and seetnec1 just as good eyer. Tbere vvns a large audience, and comments \Yere freely passed to the effect that the coming contest \vonld be ''some'' gan1e. The spectators were not c1isappointcc1, for \vhen the \vhist1e sonncled for THE FIRST HALF to begin things started \vith a rush. Colgate ren1e1nbered ber previous defeat at the hands of the Garnet, and put on a11 possible stean1 to 1nake the first basket. Union \vas deter- nlined to conquer the victors over Cornell and and st:trted in the same \vay. A foul for in- terrupting ~ dribble gave Houghton a chance to start the score for lT nion, but shortly after. Hammond repeated the trick for Colgate. To say the least, Vnion's pass\vork \vas ragge.d at this point, but \vhen Colgate 1an~ed a sid.e shot, the team ·woke up. Houghton missed a free thro\V, but poked the ba)l in t\vo secon<ls later from the fou11ine and tied the score, then Dewey untied it 'with another basket. Col- gate \vas never able to_ regain her lost lead . After D.- Beayer scored, there \vere in be- \Vildering succession, five excellent shots fron1 the Garnet, all of 'vhich should ha\'·e gone in. Connors caged the sphere, ancl fonl line honors vvent to both Han11nond and Houghton. Then Houghton tried four long- shots, one of then1 successfuL Dewey 1nade a fine one-hand basket, and J. Beaver added two more points. From that tin1e on it \\Tas give and take for the rest of the half. Col- gate scored, and \vhen Johnson came back after a fe\v minutes' absence from the game, SCJred again. l:nion added four points in compensation. Then Kennedy ancl Houghton shared honors bet\veen them, thus ending the half. The score stood: Colgate J 2·, l.Tnioh 20,-a point a n1inute for us. THE SECO~D HAI..F At I-Ian1ilton, l~nion played a defensiye gan1e in the second ha1f, bnt not so here: the Garnet \Vas out for a big score. I-Ian1- 1nond and 1-Ioug-hton opened the period by free thro\vs. After a little c~ever pass-\vork,

; ! ' ··' • (''• ~·I ,., .. • 8 THE CONCORDIENSIS D. Beaver and \¥ oocls both scored, then D'. Beaver again. A double foul netted the Garnet one point, but the Maroon nothing. 'rhen D. Beaver shone again. A foul for r-unning brought no score for Union, but a dribble, nearly the who1e length of the court, by Kennedy, brought the Colgate score up to three. Woods. however, dribbled half the length of the court and repeated the trick. A beautiful back-hand throw from one hand brought Connors into the lin1e light. Ham- mond and Houghton again exchanged foul line honors. Dewey passed to D. Beaver, who made good. Houghton failed in a free throw, but made up for it by a c1ever side shot. Dewey then tried to make a foul for interference with a dribble count, but did not succeed. Hammond did no better when a foul for a double dribble was called. Rich ·suddenly announced that he was in the game by slipping away from Woods long enough to bring the 1\1aroon score up to eight. But the seconds were becon1ing few i'n number. For the last time Hammond and Houghton exchanged honors from the foul line. Ham- mond dropped out and Bourne took his place, only in time to hear the final whistle blow. For the second time, Union had proved that \We're the team that shut the gate on Colgate,'' as the score of 38 to 21 will shO\\V. THE PLAYERS Hammond piled up Colgate's biggest score from the foul line, but Kennedy shone from the floor with his three baskets. The Bea- vers were as good as ever. I-Ioughton 's score of sixteen speaks for itself. De\vey put up a great interference) and increased the score by six. Woods was the only Union man to have the reach on his opponents, and he used it by adding- a similar number of points. The lineup and summary: Colgate 21 Hammond Borne Right For\vard Union 38 J.

The pitcher proble1n has been a serious one to solve and accord- ingly the workout of new men will be closely watched. Seven freshmen and two sopho- mores reported to Coach Pawson and were put through a light practice.

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS defeat superficiality. Man, struggling to res- cue his spiritual po,ver frotn the forces \vhich \vould crush it, looks to a higher po\ver. Thus comes a resort to religion. Professor Eucken then dealt \vith the posi- tion of philosophy tovvard religion. Philos- ophy, he said, could not recon1rnend a re- turn to the old forms of faith. Great changes have taken place. Ne\v energies have been put to use in the vvorld, \Ve have learned to kno\v nature as governed by sin1ple la\VS. There has also been an internal change, in \vhich life develops its ov·,,rn sources of action. the kernel of life has transforn1ed external organization into internal personality. Religion, declared the speaker, 1nust take a definite position. It 1nust enter in to the ne\v 1Jroblems of the tin1es, and oyercon1c them instead of turning a\vay. It must have an independent 1ife of its O\Vl1 into \vhich it can infuse its own life, or philoso-phy is in vain. Re1igion must give an account of its ai1ns and cannot dispense ·with philosophy. The latter searches the universe about us and finds that although there is a constant progress to-vvard perfection, there is nothing to sho\v man ho\\T to attain the inner con1- munton. In the soul must \Ve seek the basis of religion. Spirit11ality assnres ns a tra11- scendent life. It is this inner necessity which has made great personalities independent of their surroundings. Spiritual developn1ent is not a calm development but a hard strug- o·]e \Vi thin and without, ·which has been made c. more keen bv the progress of civilization. JVIan can endure much and not lose courage, but he cannot endure to have his life ain1- 1ess. Philosophic and theological ideas be- come living and actual religion only by a miracle. This 1niracle has happened in the great religious personalities of the past. and is con1n1unicable. Great creature persona1i- ties n1ay inspire, and to son1e extent guide, mankind for all time. In closing Professor Eucken said that an independent spiritual life is essential to a11, and, although man 1nay be driven for a titne to atheis1n, deeper thought drives him back to religion. '' Goc1 is easiest and hardest to kno\v; easiest \\Vhere the past is plain, hardest where the past is dark.'' At the close of the lecture Professor Hoff- man expressed the general appreciation of the public for the privilege which he had ex- tended to this city and expressed the hope that the lecture might see his high ideals realized in ... :-\1nerica. --- :'·0· :-- ALUMNI NOTES Governor Sulser has appointed Brigadier- General James vV.

Every- where \Ve are greet~d in the most cordial manner, \Ve are entertained in every conceiv- able ·way and \Vel corned by mayors and citi- zens alike, but especially by students. At Rutgers vte had a '' warm \ reception. The Lawrenceville boys turned out in great n1.unbers; a thousand Princeton boys greeted us as we entered their city. Bordentown Academy treated us to lunch, Pennsylvania University merely mobbed our small band. This afternoon another tnilitary academy greeted us. There are dozens of speeches made daily by members of our party, suffrage clubs are newly founded in ou1~ wake. At home -vve might doubt the possibility and prudence of woman suffrage, but when one has seen the thousands of enthusiastic people, met the intelligent and fo1~cefnl leaders and listened to the wonderful oratory of the enthusiasts, he is carried away on the stream of a -vvon- derfu1 forward progression. are putting out extra editions.

UNION HUMBLES WEST POINT Break Cadet's Winning Streak in Extra Period Game \\est Point had a clean record of vic-- tories until Saturday. ;I' he Cadets were nntch elated ancl very protld of their tean1 and· vvell they 111ight be. Princeton, \\. es ... 1eyan, Swartlunore, Rochester and Colg-ate all had fallen before the soldiers. A.t the rate they were going it looked as though it '\vere n1ore than probable that a list of uninter- rupted victories from beginning to end would be their season's record in basketball. Everyone ,at all concerned, after looking o\·er the A.nny's schedule of gan1es yet to he played decided at once on li nion to stop the slaug-hter if it vvas to be done by any tean1. ;\ncl VvTe did it ! 1'hc tean1 left Schenectady at 9 :40 Satur- day tnorning and n1ade that vv-eari~on1e trip down to \Yest Point with tnore than a few enthusiastic can1p-fol1o-vvers. :-\. nutn ber of ~tudes and ahunni, especially the New Y ... ork 1nen, taking advantage of the holiday, were on hand to witness the best and n1ost inl- portant game of the season. When the team canie on the floor, the old \hika'' yell was opened up with such a vi 111 that the Garnet wearers knew_ that the affiliations and hopes of the spectator vvere not all '\vith the :\ tn1y. It took the fello\iVS a little tin1e to get ac- quaint~d with 1ne Army court. It _is a lar_ge affair and has worn down tnany of \''est Point's opponents. The hard floor of the ''gym'~ did not gi\~e a fraction of a inch un- der a n1an · s foot and this in a \VaY \Vas a handicap to us. Long ~hots that \voulcl haYe dropped in on our local court, bounded off do\vn there ar1d the fellows realized that they would have to shoot higher. Presently the boys begar1 to drop then1 in in the ol(~ ·vva V and then. practice \VaS ended. rfh~ ga tne \vas on. FIRST HALF Benson and Thorpe, both of Colt1n1hia. were in charge of the gan1.e ancl vvorked 111 igh ty well. The fou1s they called \vere n1any and frequent but Just and in1 partiaf. For five n1inu tes neither tean1 -vvas able to ::;core. 'Then Sutton scored a point on \Voods's foul, I-Ioughton chalked up t\VO for t~nion on Roberts' and Sutton's fouls . .:\f- ter tnanoe-uvreing around for a whiie Sut- ton scored a field basket fron1 the floor and after he had scored another point on J. Beaver's first Dffense, the Cadets led by two points. vVoods would not stand for this and departed frorn Roberts' en1 bracing anns 1nng enough to score a pretty one frotn the cEnter of the court. vVith the score a tie, Roberts scored a field goal and Sutton added a point on Houghton's foul. He gave the Army a three point lead and it -vvas biggest and only one they had during the gan1e.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS Houghton soon cut down this lead to one point, but the Cadets jumped it to two on D. B-eaver's foul. Again Houghton came to the front with a field goal and tied the score. Sutton scored on a foul and Dewey put us in the lead again by a field goal. Then w,e lead by two points on Houghton's scor,e fro1n the foul line. At this point Sutton was ruled off the court on four personal fottils and Hobbs took the big guard's place. The teams left the court at the end of the first half with the score 11-10 in favor of Union. erect it is due then1 for playing an erroriess game. After the hardest sort of playing, the Cadets forced the score to a tie and when Roberts scored on Woods' foul ' SECOND HALF From a Cadet's point of view, prospects at the beginning of the second half were bright and encouraging for the Army. Many titnes before had they beaten out a team in the last half because of better physical con~ clition. In outward appearance the Garnet wearers do not look much hardier than other teams, but the Army soon found that for once they had met a team that had as much 'pep\ and fight in the second half as the first. Every time the Cadets opened up anything, Union was on hand with a receipt and in- terest. The Garnet quintet would not be played off their feet and persisted in break- ing through the Army's desperate defense. Metnories of how Rochester and others had been beaten in the last half gradually faded away as Union's speed and guarding did not slacken, but increased if possible. The last period was but a repetition of the first with the exception that once in the first the. Army had led by three points and how in the second Union had the same lead. Thorpe had his eye out for even slight of- fenses and it was not long before Houghton had enough personals to side-line him and Cleveland took his place. Within six min- utes Woods followed Houghton to the bench and Cleveland filled center with Schell tak- ing Houghton's position. These· men, cold and fresh from the bench, were placed in a trying position. Entering the game at this stage without warming up n1ight have meant defeat for Union and a lot of the Army led by a point. Then Union took the offensive and played the Arn1y off their feet but, although the shots were n1any, the baH evaded that two-point circle. Finally c·aptain Beaver tied the score on Boyce's of- fense for holding and the second period ended with the score 20-20. Intercollegiate rules provide that in the case of a tie at the end of the second half, five n1:in utes overtime shall be played. The figb.t in that last five tninutes was nerve- raoking. The pace was terrific. Presently Dewey fouled and the Cadets gained their twenty-first point. Union became desperate and forced the fight to the last ditch. Clean sh()ts evaded the basket tin1e after time un- til finally J. Beaver repeated his Colgate stunt. With fifteen seconds to play, he broke away from his tnan, received the ball on a pass and scored the two points that won the game. The contest was settled. The official score : ARMY (21). B.

'fhe relay took place between the halves of the Syracuse-Oberlin basketball game and was run on th.e indoor track in the Syracn~e gytnnasium. Captain La Barron discovered after the. race that the distance which ea.ch man ran ancl which was timed as a half 1nHe was in reality son1e forty yards too tnnch. 'fhe best ti1ne ,vhich had been 1nacle on the track was 2:04 and that by a ~Iichigan 1nan while La Barron ran his distance in 2 :03, which was about 1 :58 for the half n1ile. ~rhe Union 1nen did their best and that vvas enough to win 11110St races, but the Orange runners were all crack half-rnilers and sin1- ply took the race frorn the start. Captain I .. a Barron ran the prettiest race of the even- ing, cutting his opponent's lead consideral1ly. 'The race started with l\1 udge, '14, as the first 1nan. He put n p a ha.rd fight but lost a little ground. I-Iowell, '14-, the second run- ner for Union, made a pretty sprint, cut dovvn Syracuse's lead quite a bit but he hacl to slo\v clovvn before his half \vas run and g-ave the Orange rnan a longer lead. Tren1per, ·13, ran third and put up a splendid fight and cut down the lead a bit but he \Vas nearly a lap behind and it \vas in1pos- ~ible to overcon1e this handicap. Captain La Barron, vvho \iVaS fourth 111an, start eel with a rush. He ran a wonderful half and n1ade \vonclerful titne but his opponents \vas no snail hin1self and \Bob\ could only cut dovvn the lead enough to saye the tean1 fron1 being beaten by a ·whole lap. ~lis tin1e \vas the fastest· ever n1ade on the Syracuse track and that takes away son1e of the sting of defeat. In Chapel n1eeting- l\londay noon, he said that the track tea1n needed 1nore 1nen in the dashes, rnore pole vaulters and n1ore weight men.

THE SOCIOLOGY LECTURES broad education who has not n1astered at ' ~ ' least, the elements of tlti:s science which has to do with all the present day problems of modern life, and we feel it our duty to urge upon every naan in coUege that he owes it to himself to attend these lectures and get a broader and more enlightened idea of sociology. Those who are studying Dr. Gid- dings' text book in the sen.ior course will na- turally be most inter,ested but we feel strongly that an. hour taken from study even at the expense of some other college work, will be m:are than repaid by hearing Dr. Giddings talk on the subject with which he is most familiar and which lies closest to his heart. He is one of those alumni who never lose interest in his Alma Mater and although busy with his work at Columbia, he has found the tin1e to take an active interest in Union through his position on the Board of Trustees. The world honors Professor Giddings and through him honors his Alma Mater. Let us show our appreciation by attending his lectures not only because he is a great lec- turer but because he is a fellow-Union-n1an. H. H.

We feel confident that the men will bring honor to the college whether they win or lose and we have a strong hope that the defeats suffered a year ago in these contests will be retrieved. The subject for debate is the one used for the Allison-Foote debate and the men are there-- fore familiar with every phase of the pro- President Richn1ond treated us to a most pleasant surprise last week when he an- nounced the Giddings 1 ectures. Doctor Giddings is one of the prominent sociologists of the present and his enviable reputation has spread not only through America but to ·Europe. At the recent congress of L'Insti- tute International de Sociology at Rome he was elected president for the current year. We are indeed fortunate in having a 1nan of his eminence with us and in having the op- portunity to hear him talk on the subject of sociology. If there is one science more than any other, characteristic of the twentieth century, it is the science of sociology. Niod- ern, highly-developed, and artificial civiliza- tion has been doing its work and now the world is asking sociology to aid her in ad- justing the present complex evils of our social system. No man can lay claim to a position. Our debating season opened with

Until Sa.tu:t-day, n n colle.ge had been able to overc o:n'ie the ~peed and skill of the Cadets. Playing all their gan1es on their own court, they b.ad an added advantage over visiting fives a.ttcl had con1e through the season with a record un- hlottecl by defeat. 1'he Cadets heard o.f the strength of the Union tean1 and took IVJ.rn- tng. The gan1e vvas fast; faster tb:a n any they had played this season. Things hap- pened and happened in bunches. vV it1Q two of our regular men disq ual ifi eel for p~ r~ onal fouls, the prospect looked dark for Cnion, and when, after the score was tied anfl five tninutes were needed to decide the gatne, the . \rn1y scored on a foul, the gan1e s ee1ned lost but the tean1 snatched victory f1·o111 ap- parent defeat and can1e home chan1 p i()n s. \Vhen -vve defeated Colgate a wee:k a?;o. \\'e beca111e State chatnpions but not satisfied with thi.t, we hun1bled the Arn1y five· and ncnv have a clear clain1 to the Eastern chatn- pion~hip. True, 'V\T est Point intends to clai1n it also on the grounds that they have de- feated larger colleg·es than -vve have but their clain1 can s-carcelv be countenanced when ...; one considers the fact that we outscored then1 during the first half and then, with t·wo '\~arsit_v n1en out of the gatnc, defeated then1 nevertheless. Cotnpetent judges have declared that there is not a college tean1 in the East which could defeat the Garnet five and Saturdav 's game seen1s to testify to the truth of the staten1ent. \Vith but three n1ore gan1es to play, the teatn bicls fair to close the season with a record, clean except for the gan1e lost to Rochester by a one point tnargin and re- deen1ed a week latter by defeating that tea111 on its own court. \1\r e 111ay well be proud of the tean1 -vvhich has brought so tnuch honor and such an enviable reputation to their ,\ln1a ]\later and to an equal degree of the coach ·who has brought that tean1 into shape and coached it to its present success.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS Doctor Richtnond returned l\tlonday £ron1 Buffalo \vhere he attended the banquet of the Princeton alurnni of that city on the 21st. Here he was one of the principal speakers. Next n1orning he spoke at the University of Buffalo. The n1eeting \vas spoken of afterwards as a ''wild success.\ About three thousand people were present and gave Prexy a xnost enthusiastic t-ecep- tion. 1V1onday evening, Dr. Richtnond at- tended the dinner at the University club of Albany. President ~Iibbon of Princeton University and also the Pretnier of Canada were guestsg Prexy is much in demand nowadays as a speaker and, if he so desired, could give most of his tin1e to this work. He is admittedly one of the very first atnong the public speak- ers of the country and does n1uch in this -vvay to bring Union into eye of the public. But wherever he goes and whatever he does, he always fin· .. ds so1ne 01pportunity to dis- cnss lT n ion and to sing her praise in no uncertain n1anner. ---:tO·:--- UNION ADMITTED TO INTER- COLLEGIA T-ES Garnet Men Will Enter Fast Company in Meet at ,Harvard The annual1neeting of the Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of Am- erica was held at the Waldorf-Astoria on Saturday afternoon. The application of Union for n1embership was considered and the college was adrni tted to the association without a dissenting vote. Manager Gard- ner was present at the meeting and spoke in behalf of Union. The admission of Union to this associa- tion means that she must send a. teatn of at least three n1en to the championship meet, to be held at Harvard on Soldiers' Field, Decoration Day. It should n1ean rnore than this to those interested in track athletics at Union. This annual intercoUegiate meet is the most important event of its kind for the year. 1'he winning of the chan1pionship is the goal of all the large universities and col- leges belonging to the association. With this end in view, Union should also u~~ every effort to develop tl-1e best possible teatn, in order to n1ake a credibie showing- at this, its first start in big ,ootnpany. --: 0 :--------- CLASSICAL CLUB FORMED The Classical Club held its first n1eeting last Thursday evening in Professor Kel- logg's room, in vVashburn 1-Iall. An or- ganization was effected and Professor Kel- logg and~ Professor Bennett were present and gave short talks. The following officers were elected: liubert Mann, '13, president; VV. L. Cote, '14, vice-president; B. L. Loon1is, '15, secretary; L. C. Fletcher, '16, treasurer. Professors IZellogg and J3ennett and 1\J r. l\tlaxon are especially interested in the or- gan-ization, a classical club on the \Hill and if the students continue to show as tnuch interest as -vvas evinced at this preliminary meeting, the club ought to develop into an itnportant factor in college life. The club will be under the auspices of the Phi Beta Kappa Society and one of its ain1s is the eventual lowering of the. present high re- quirements for adn1ission to the classical courses here at Union. This would result in a numerical increase in the Arts cour:-;e and. would greatly streng-then the college thereby.

16 THE CONCORDIENSIS FIRST GII)DINGS LECTU:R·E Professor Franklin H. Giddings, Ph. D., L. L. D., of .Colntnbia University delivered the first of the series of lectures on Sociology, Tuesday evening, in the Chapel. The -gen- e1~ai sn bject of these 1ectures is '' 'The Orig-in and Nature of Social Justice,\ and the first lecture ,vas on '' The Significance of Social Unrest.\ President Richn1ond introduced Doctor Giddings ··who discussed his student life at Union for some n1oments before enter- h1g the subject of the evening. Dr. Giddings termed the social unrest an expression of a movement of mankind tnTough concerted action toward an im 1)1~oved life. He said that such unrest had existed all through the ages but had not broken out into open revolt until civilization 1·eacbed the stage ·where the individual beg-an to have sotne influence o The rev01ts in Turkey and Mex:.ico are forms of th-is underlying social unrest and in nine civilized countries this same hand of restlessness takes the form of socia1istn, anarchy, social reform, labor unions, etc, Behind all these is a deep feeling- that present conditions are just and that the future \vi11 bring better things to 1nankind. Doctor Giddings next disscussed tne labor tnovement in some detail as an example of this n1ovement. He said all social ·unrest is based in certain psydiological n1oven1ent through large masses of l1umanity. Fron1 the beginning- of life indiviua1s are going through a process of evolution. The indivi- dual becomes more related to otbers and it is the n1an \Yho does not adjust hin.1se1f to such a relationship vvho does not survive frorn this thought, he led to conclusion that in tl1e strug- gle to,i\rard a comtnon goal tl1ose \ivbo had sympathy, intelligence and lovalty to the group would survive, while tl1e rest would fail to attah1 this ideal. The fact that they were no longer indiffer- ent to conditions seemed to indicate that the best mental and moral value of man 'vould some day be attained by the n1.ass instead of being possessed by the fe\v as at present. The second lecture \\vas de1ivered last nig-ht It 'vas on ''The Meanin·g of Social Authorit\· Which Stands Over Against Social Unrest as the Embodiment of Social ·Control.'' The: Concordiensis went to press before this second lecture 'vas delivered so we are unap1e to giye it in this issue. --::0:-- At a special meeti11g~ of the senior class yesterday noon, the officers for the class-day ·were elected.
