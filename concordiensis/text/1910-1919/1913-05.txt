MAY 7, 1913 No. 23 MIDDLE,BU:RY 9, UNION 3 Vermonters Swamp the Garnet in Slow, Uninteresting Game After playing top-notch ba11 for seven inn- ing-s, lT nion \veakenecl and g-ave ~1iddle bury her first chance to end a baseball game be- tween the t\YO co11cg·es \Vith the score to her credit. It ·was 4:30 o~clock when the. un1pire ca11ed ont '~Play ba11h and then the battle \vas on. Middlebury was first at bat and Union started out wen by shutting out her opponents in the first. Malloy, a freshn1e11 in the Phannacy School \vas on the n1ound for Union and his assortn1ent of puzzles \vas too n1uch for the lVIiddlebury batters for they ·were retired in quick order ·without even a chance to see second base. Then Union took her turn \vith the stick but there \vas no scoring in the first . . 1nn1ng. In the second inning, ~1ic1dlebury n1a1utged to fill the bases w·ith but one 1nan out. It \vas a bad hole for the little pitcher, but he 1nanagecl to hand the next batter three strikes and then started in to cinch the gan1e. However, the batter was over-anxious and struck at a \vide one, which landed just back of ~econd base. This brought in t\vo runs and before the side \vas retired, t\yo n1ore 1nen had crossed the plate, giving Middle bury a lead of four runs at the end of the second inning for Union was unable to score. '[Tnion ho\\~ever, took a brace in the third innino· ,-, and carne back strong. Hutchens drove out a pretty single past second and stole secon<;1 \vhilc Jenkins fanned the air anc1 n1ade a neat slide for third on D. Bea\rer' s th:rd strike. \Vith- t\VO n1en out, J. Beaver hit safely, scoring Hutchens. Beaver stole second \vhile Naun1an \vas \vaiting- for a good one. ''Dutch\ hit to center field and \vas advanced to third on Barclay's hit to center on which Beaver scored. Houghton then laid one along third, which scored Nauman. This \vas the finish of a gatne rally for the next batter tnade the third 1nan out. Jenkins, the big fres~p1an \Yho replaced ~1a11oy, \Yhen he \vas injured in the second inning tr~ring to cover home plate, \vas doing wonderful \VOrk and there \vas no n1ore scor- ing until the eighth, \vhen the \ ... ern1ont boys seen1ecl to solve his delivery and added n1ore runs. .l\ bad error in the ninth tn~H1c the count for the visiting tean.1, \vhile lTnion had to be content \Yith the s1na1ler end of the score. THE PLAYERS The v·isiting- pitcher t\virled a rcn1arkable g-atne, striking out fourteen n1.en anc1 passing not one Garnet· ph1yer. Ma11oy, for l: nion,

Zimmer, at second, played bd:s new position remarkably well, having five chances and n1ade all of them good. Kehler, a nev.r con1er, seemed to fit right into third and played a hard position snccessfuHy. The rest of the players played their old positions artd each did his level best. More team work is necessary, and it takes time to peT- feet that, but -with the students behind the team as they are, it is to be expected that luck V\ril1 soon break for us again and victory \Vi 11 soon be on rs.

The meet is sure to be a l1ard one, in as n1uch as the teatn fn_)111 Worcester is a yery strong one, and made up of 1nen w-ho are first-class track n1en in every respe~t. J{ensse1aer must be seriously considered also, because they hayc several men in their team, who -will n1ake a gyod fight for places. Ho,vever\ having seen both teams in a n1eet this season, it n1ust be conceded that. V'{ orcester is far sup- ior to Rensse ]aer. The strength of our tea1n cannot be esti- nlated until \Ve have gone throug-h a good meet. The indications are that V{C shall be a hard proposition for any of the sn1aller col- leges, but tbere is one f~ctor that 1nakes ns ''reaker than n1ost other collC'ges. 'The tean1 this year Jacks, as a rule, good second and third place 1nen. It is con1posed of a fe\Y mighty g·ood 1nen, but aside fro1n these fe\v, there is scarcely any tnaterial in shape to cotnpete. We \vi11 have to depend larg·ely upon t11e efforts of abotit 'eight tnen and should anything- happen to any one of these, the tean1 \vou1d be tretnendously handicapped. it is prulxtbl~y safe to say that the absence of one of these n1en \vil1 determine which war the meet 'vill go. We are therefore in a precarious position, and our strength as a tean1 is going· to be \vhat it should, only on the gr( conditi In t shall d The ton '1 ( The 11udg-( The <~ers 'J ~ The Stolle1 'I'h€ Finch ThE Tht Bur\VI La~ to \Vi of 6-C l,.nio: set V\' -whicl ficien Tb F1 ·'\\Toe \7'· Ho\~ Ir \\'L'el stng thu~

This set ·was won bv \Voods from Hubbell, during ·which \Voods plainly sho,ved that with St1f- ficient practice he can deliver g·ood tennis. The ;;ets sun1n1arize as follows: SINGLES \T i~tor fron1 \iV ads worth, 6-2 ~ 6-1. Cutler fron1 Ho\Ye11, 6-1; 6-2. lluhbe11 fron1 vVoods, 6-3: 6-8; 6-2. Fletcher from \Vooda11, 6-1; 7-5.

In professional drdcs, they arc ca1h~(l ''fans,'' and n1aintain that distinction, because of the ro\V(1yisn1, ra111ery, critici~m and other Jn- sn lting n1ethocls they usc in attac kin.~· yisit- ing tecuns. Here, at co11e.~·e \Ye also ·hayc ''fans,'' bnt not often to the extent 'that they are nnhearab1e. 1'hey are of a nn1ch milder type, and give vent to their excessive spirit on con1parativcly fl~\Y occassions. Baseba11, like no otl1er .~·tunc, stirnn1ates a fervid cnthusias1n, cHH1 the n1anifestation of such spirit is exactly \vhat is expected of t11L' student body at a ga1ne; but when this enthu- siasm so overpo\vers a man, that it carries him beyond self control, then \Ve have a n:- grettable condition of affairs .. A fevv such n1en at a recent ga.tne on the Can1pus ~were guilty of slurring- remarks on 1nen1bers of the visitin,~· tean1. These cliscredi6ng expressions, canK· fron1 the bleachers, and it sce1ns an injustice, if not a CO\varc11y act, to affront a man in this n1anncr, \Yhen he is on the clian1o1Hi playin,~· to \Yin. T'he o1c1, unchang·ea b1e subject of coJlege spirit n1ig·ht here be introduced, as a fitting lecture for these n1en.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 11 .As a n1atter of fact, the fello\YS of \vhon1 \\T speak, are a1vtays strong in the cotnbined cheering, but it scen1s that they have sotn·e superfluous energ:y, and an insatiable arnbi- tion for the success of their tean1 ~ now, to take Coach Dawson's advice,. ''when vonr cheer- leader is not 'on the job,' and you fee1 as if ~·on simply had to yell for the team, ca11 for a cheer'' ond then with the combined voices of all the men, put every effort into the ye11, and make the tean1 feel that the boys are right there behind the1n. This side~line criticisn1 of V\rhich \Ve speak, 111ay be due, perhaps, to the fact that of late, we haYe been accustomed to cheer for a \vin- ning teatn, \\rhilc of late it has been up to us to back a losing tean1, yet no\v is the titne when a real juclgn1ent of \LTnion College spirit 1nay be obtai ned. These fe\V, or any future defeats, should be no cause for a change in our spirit, and surely, the games are \vorth losing, if they only serve to bring out the loyal S\l pporters our team, -and the trne V nion spirit.

THE CON,CORDIENSIS 13 ''A NEW PHASE OF THE 'LIQUOR PROBLE~M--- THE CABARET\ (Accepted for literary contest) The Cabaret is a bacchanalian institution fro1n \vhicb one graduates when he realizes he has made a fool of himself. The entrance requirements are two: evening clothes and a liberal pt:Trse, but in some resorts the former requirement is not enforced and only the pecuniary qualification is compulsary. The chief function of the Cabaret is ·identical with that of the comrnon cafe or saloon-the c1ispensing- of liquor: it differs fron1 the latter on1y in the prices charged for the intoxicants. The '' sho·w '' is a secondary characteristic of the Cabaret and its only purpose is to aux- iliate the initial function. rrherc arc three g·eneral classes of Caba- rets: those in \Yhich the actors pcrfonn on a stag·e cr~ctec1 for their nse and to \vhicl1 they are rest1·ictecl \Yhile pcrfonning; those in which t11e actors are not confined to the stage but dance ar.>und the tabies and sin~- in the ears of the g-uests; and those in which the guests are pern1itted anc1 invited to take pc1rt in the general frolic. To preclude contradic- tion, it rnay be \\'ell to mention that this classification is son1C\ivhat loose, for the Cab- arets, not unlike the sciences, observe, are always g:rowing-, covering 1arg-er fields, ac- quiring- ne\Y characteristics and thus ne'-essi- tating· ne\Y systen1s of classification. 1-Iow- e\·c .. , 1hong'1 th~se g-ronps 111.ay l'e 1 ose, they serve here th .. :ir purpose of acq ·a· nt ng the nn in1tiate:1 reader \Yith the ge :1e ,· _Ll typ~s anc1 ,vho otherwise r.;frain ftotn freqcnting cafes. They soon find themselves acquiring the drinking habit. In a fc\V years, the toll our country vviU pay the Cabaret, annua11y, in \vrecked careers will· be prodigio:ns. At these Cabarets polite and promiscuous people rub elbo\VS. Even to those -resorts which choose to can thernseThves '' fashion- able'', people of questionable character are admitted ; he it vlithou t the consent of the manage1nent or other\vise --generally, other- \vise. Thus, a fTequenter of s11ch restau- rants (if they rna: .. ~ be called restaurants) stands ever in the danger of being c )as sed in the same catagory \i\~ith pronlis:cnous people, vvho, if you please, are guests \vith him, on co1nn1on ground. But it is not on1y an injustice to oneself to \~is.it such places, it is often a cruc1injustice to the perfonneTs. The \Yr.iter. to get her \Yit11 n1anv others, lunched at a ,Cabaret at an early n1orning- hour, after a dance \Yhen ·when the other restaurants \vere dosed. 1\t that hour the schec1u1ec1 perfortnances \vcre o-ver. The tnanag-c·n1ent, ho\vever, desirous of holding the guests as long as possible ordered the actors to make their appearance and entertain the con1pany. ln a half an ho11r t\vo performers put in an appearance. rrhey \\Tere a singing and dancing- \ 'tean1, l) rfhe over\i\~orkec1 tnan who \VaS at the piano played \Yith no interest \Yhatsoeyer. ·His fing~ers hardly t\n1ched the keys of the piano~ forte and in his great haste he skipped n,>tes and ev·en n1easures. His partner \vas harclly n1ore st1ccessful in her bold atten1pts. Her vc)icc \vas \Yorn and fatig~ncc1, her gestures of such resorts. Tne g:reat danger of the Cabaret is f1at it encot\rag-es drinking:, the greatest L'Yi11n our ciYi11zation. It not only encourages drink- ing but rnakes drinking fashionable. rrhe Cabaret, generally does business under the \Yere forc(.~d, her sn1i l..:s \vere only feig·necl, hut no atten1 pt vvas n1acle to conceal the fact. In response to the encore they n 1ac1e another brave but vain atternpt to n1ake then1sehTes equal to the occasion, an<.1 then they n1ac1e a hasty exit. It ·was quite 1nan1fcst fhat they 11ac1 been con1pe11e<.1 to awake fn>n1 their slnn1ber to perfonn once tnDre for their in- considerate brothers and sisters. .r\ fter a f~\Y n1inutes n.nother '' tean1,,' vvhose sleep c1oak of a restaurant, but its real purpose is to serve as a drinking rendezvous. It exerts a sinister influence over young n1en \Yho fool thenl.se1y-es into patronizing-it as a restaurant,

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS had been rudely clisturhed for our benefit, \Yas ready to carry on the perfoTU1!ance. 1'his is not an incident. It is an event \Yhich occurs often in Cabaret-restaurants. '' In n1ost Cabarets in France, they have writ upon the walls, 'Dieu te regarde','; says Samuel Pepys in his ''Diary,'' September 23rd, 1662. A proprietor today, would not permit sucp a message on his walls but every one of tts ought to have those words imprinted in.his mind when in a Cabaret. The following quotation from Darwin (Descent of Man, chap. I) it is also ad vi sable to commit to n1emory. '' .A .. n American monkey, after getting drunk on brandy \vou1d never touch it again, and thus ,;vas wiser than n1any men.'' Some tnen scoff at the supposed re • lationship of tnonkey to n1an. It is \¥ell, that the n1onkcy can not express his opinions in the tnatter. A good \Vay to obliviate the Cabaret is to refrain fron1 frequenting it. No plea can be successfu1ly offered for patronizing such places. In the double function of furnishing a good meal and a good show, they furnish neither. The best perfonners appear only at the theatres ; the best rnea]s are served only at hotels and restaurants which do not find it necessary to resort to the aid of danc- ing \r en uses, \vhose profuse applications of cosn1etics have helped build the Woohvorth Building. It is yery plain, hoV\rever, that the above plan is a superficial one. It \vill not suffice to attack the \Valls ; the cabaret must be undern1ined. 1'he Cabaret is not a ne\v enen1y. It is n1erely a ne\v phase of the liquor problem, which is as old as civilization itself. The conflict between man and liquor is n1ore destructable than any other form of vvarfare but the strug-gle is so old and drinking so fashionable that the sight has lost all of its real terror, and we look upon an intemperate man without the feeling of disgust and ab- horrence \vhich his real character and true situation detnand. It is for this reason that the evil is so difficult to overcon1e. As a panacea for the national evils, rea] or fancied in our econotnic system, the modern cry is '' governn1·ent ownership.'' The drink evil presents the greatest economic evil as well as the biggest moral problem. Whv not apply '' government ownership '' as ~ means of abating this evil ? The city can not control the saloon, the state can not con- trol the saloon. The bre,;very controls the saloon! Why not have the national govern- ment O\vn and operate the brewery? The hope of absolute prohibition for the present generation is a idle dream. Temperance is the stepping- stone to prohibition. Govern- tnent ovvnership and operation of brevveries will bring temperance~ ~at once. The sale of poisonous drinks, like \v.hiskey, could he absolutely and in1mediately prohibited. In the 1neantin1e a1coho1 is fi11ing our pris- ons and oyercro\vding our asylums. \Vill the Cabaret be pennittecl to flourish and fur- nish more in111ates for these institutions?

The game was ·filled \vith hits, and briHiant plays were intenningled ·with n~any n1uffed easy chances. The ''reathet \vas n1ost unfavorable, it being so cold that n.one of the pitchers co.uld get properly warn1ed up, and considering all things, they pitched fine baseball. An icy wind sw·ept across the Can1pus and one needed more than n1ere ·enthusiasm to keep hin1sel f warn1. How·ever, a goo·d perc·entage of the students \vere out on th.'e bleachers, showing by cheers and yells thalt t'bey -vvere behind the team everv n1inute. no .tnatter vvhat the score \ might be. The \V·eather n1ade gooci playing almost in1- , possible and the f.eUows .are to be congratu- lated ·on the nervy fight they made against a more experienced teatn, bad luck and a n1ost persistent boo cloo. The gan1~e s,.tart·ed 'vith 1{ un1m·er in the box for Cnion. Colgate started at once w·ith 't\vo hard hits and scored three men before the third put out. Uni•on scored once in her half of the first but the tnen \V~Cre unalble to put the hall w:here the fast fielding of the Colgate players ·couldn't get it. In the second Ham-.. n1ond' s hom·e run, preceeded by two hits and an erro-r, scor·ed thPee more runs for Colga,te. Union n1ade her seoond tally in the fourth and could do no n1ore scoring. In the sixth, Colgate added five runs, to her score, hitting the baH allnost at ·will, but S1nith, taking Hunl- tner's place in the seventh, held thetn for t\YO innings and permitted only tvvo n1ore runs in the ninth. Had our hoodoo been on a vacation . Saturday, \V'e should have scored in the last three innings, when Brown relieved Croker. But he had a good infield and \vonderful luck behind hin1 and these overweighed tthe ease with which Union found the ball and prevent- eel any further scoring. Colgate solved Union's delivery for a total of fourteen hits vvhile Union poked out s·even. Colga·te \vas not content with n1er~e base hits but •ta:llied 'tvvo t\vo-bas·e hits, two three-base hits and a :hon1e run.

The action taken, natnclv, ·that a ''No Deal Systetn'' \' 1Jc established at Union upon its ratification by four-fifths of the stutlent body, \vas the direct result of a tnost acln1irable spirit of detnocratic relati·onship ·which has heen Inak- ing itself pron1inent in S 1 tuc1ent affairs. At present only one hundred and fifty n1en in the student body have ratified this systen1. The secretary of the I-Ionor 'Court has en- countered considerable inexcusable indifference to the syste1n throughout his canvass so far. He has also £ailed to obtain the signatur·es of several men becaus-e thes·e tnen do not beHeve the systen1 adequate 1to the conditions. vVe are sure that, if these last n1entionec.l n1en ·will consider the fa-ct 'that no better plan of ren1edying the pr·es·ent nnsaltisfactory con- ditions has been suggested and that this systen1 is the result of a ·careful preparation by the Terrace Council, 'they \\'ill not prevent the sys- ~ten1 fro1n at least a fair trial. vVe ar-e very glad to hear, however, that the nun1ber of n1en who are utterly indifferent as to \vhether the systen1 is put on 'trial or not is very s1nall. No truly l'Oyal Union n1an can justify hin1self for taking an indifferent position upon any subject which is so vital to the \velfare of his Aln1a ::.\later. \Ve hop-e that this ren1incler of the duty of every stuclent to the student borly as a \vhole will result in definite a·ction from each man. .And \Ve are sure that if the n1en look at this n1atter fairly, they \\·ill no longer retard af- tl.nna,tive action on this question, which tneans so n1uch to the college.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 13 TKE TAR:RIFF AGAIN (Aeeepted for literary contest) To 1nost of us the tariff offers but a dull and obtuse topic which vve seek to avoid rath- er than discuss. Bnt neve.rtlt-el·ess, the· tariff i5 tnostly intimately connected -vvith our na- tional prospe·rity, and it tnay he said, with our private purse and ot.:tght to receive our clos·e atbention and interest. At this tim·e it is e~pecially int~eresting and will for son1:e tin1e furnish the chief topi~c fo·r ·discussion in the national forun1. President \:Vilson \vas elected on a pl3:tfornl opposed to the p1·inciple of the protective tariff. lle pro1nisecl a speedy revision of the tariff atHl has ca.Hecl an extraordinary session· of Congress to cope with the external tax and n1ake good the party pron1ises. The Pre'siclent ought to he rotntnenclecl by all itnpartial citi- ?.cns for ~his action.· The people are apprecia- tive of the fact that at last this country is .going at the biggest subject in our national tnaterial ex-istence \'vithout gloves, -vvi thout hesitation, and vvi thout ti111 idity, The tari. ff tnust be changed. Contlitions that foster n1onor:oly n1ust be erected. The peo- ple ·cry f()r correction and their cry m·ust be heeded ; and ahvays 1s, tho1.1gh son1~etin1es tard- ily. But the party in power in l:tandling the tariff ought to keep ever in nTincl the history of our co-.:n1ry ancl the history of the tariff, particv h riy the connection of the two during the second adn1in1stration of Cleveland. In 18~3 \Villian1 L. \Vilson of \!Vest Virg-:nia in- tro~luc-ed a bill in congress providing for the ronoval of duties on all ra\V\ nlatet-ials. snch as \\ ooL irot£ ore, coal. lun1ber.~ sugar, and a con- siderable: reduction in the duties on n1anufact- urecl articles, sttch as china~ glass~ silk. cotttH1 and \voolen goods. The bilL pron1ptly passed the house by a vote nf t\YO h~1ncTrecl an0 four to one hundred and ten, but ,vhen i't reached the s·enate it v.,ras \held up.'' True it :was. the senate \vas Derno- crati·c, but the \coal senators\ of \7\/ est Vir- . . 1 \ . . ' f AI t, h gtnta, t 1e won senators o · a1:1arna , t e ,,.S · . '' f L . . h \1 b . ugar senators rotn · ou1s tana, t ·e um · er senators\ of 1\ti.ontana, all fough 1 t for the pro- tection of their \interests.\ Under the lead of the Den1ocratic Senator ·Gorman of Mary- iancl (said to be heavily in1Jeres·ted in the sugar trust) the \V·ilson bill .was mutilated beyond recognition_ with over 600 an1endtnents. ·The lower house yielded o·nly reluctantly to save a deadlock, but -president-· Cleveland refused to sign the bill calling it \party perficlity and dishonor.\ The vVilson~Gorman bill becan1e a la-vv, hovvever. \vitthout his signature. There is no need rehearsing here what follo-w·ed. It is the business of the present congress to s·ee to it that the satne consequences \vill not fol- lo\v again. The Den1ocratic party has been con1pared to a donkey; Uncle Sam n1a y be cotnparecl to the youthful n1aster of the donkey, and the ta~iff to a fly. In 1893 the sleeping owner of th~ donkey vvas disturbed by a fly. 1\he af- fectionate donkey felt that the fly n1ust be set- 'tled once for all. The anin1al appealed to the people standing by to unharness hin1 ancl per- tnit free use of hi~ rear appendages. The peo- ple did so. The affectionate donkey <lid not for ·a n1on1ent doubt his O\Vl1 wisdo1n. So far as settling the fly \Vas concerned his confidence in. hin1s·elf was justifi,ed. lle s~ett1ed the fly \Vith a heavy. well aitn-ed hlo\v. He also s·et- ltled the tnaster. The Den1ocratic party has a difficult task to accotnplish during the present achninistration. Tt n1ust kill the fly without hanning the tnas- ter. :\Ioreovcr, the Pr~siclr-nt opght to be al- wavs conscious of the fact that he is a tninor- \' ity Presirlent ancl th~t. althrJt~gh the pe·)ple \\'1 ~h to repudiate the tariff as it _stancb t0clay, yet the greelt n1ajority nf \·oter~-that i~. the con1Linccl R~epuh1ican and }~rogr-essive c~·cc­ tor~,,~e. l'·eEcYe in the p_rinciple. of a protect·ive tar1ff. Tt 1s true. ho\vever. that the pc·oplc are disgt.tsted with ·the present ta.riff. Tl1e people

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS ·cry for correotion and desire the tariff to be changed in sonTe respects. Bu~t let us hope that the changing and the correctiDn will be clone, thoughtfully, intelligently, and gradually, and that the country will surviv~e without too greaJt disturbance. If the Democratic party can accon1plish this w·onderful feat it will de- serve the thanks of all fair 1ninded ci:tiz:ens. ELIOT SAND. --- :-o :·------- TRIANGULAR MEET Worcester 57, Union 37, Rensselaer 28 The \vell balanced tra·ck aggr·egation of \Vorcester Polyt,echnic Institute found little difficulty in ·winning the triangul,ar n1eet fron1 Union and ·R. P. I. Saturday on the Renssela·er oval. The \V-orcester athletes scored in every event but the broad jun1p, rolling up a total of 57 points. The gr:eat work of Baker enabled Union to finish second \vit'h 37 credits, thus beating out our old rivals--1the Cherry ancl \Vhite athletes, \\rho scored but 28 points. Conditions for the 1neet \vere mos·t unfavor- able. The day was raw, cold and windy. The stiff northvvest vfind bothered the runners quite perceptibly, and the loose, heavy coating of cind·ers on the track n1acle nevv records im- possible. ''Ji111111ie\ Baker \vas easily the star of the n1eet, winning first honors in the 220, the high jun1p and the broHcl jutnp, and tying for first in the pole vault with Christie of Renssela,er. and Conneen of \V orcester. \Bake'' j uclged his ability and con1pet'ition tnagnificently in cverv instance. thus saving hi~s efforts for each ~ . succeeding ·ev·ent. · Captain La Barron vvas ''there\ ·with forn1, speed ancl finish in the 440. \V'inning that event handily in 54 4-5. 13ob also figured in the 880, finishing a strong second to l{ieth of vVorcester. Sto.Uer, 'lG. showerl excellent strength in the \veights. He finished second in the han1rner and the discus, and third in the shot-put. I-Iehnar did the best work for Rensselaer ' winning both high and low hurdles and plac- ing in. the b~oacl j utnp. Individual cr·edit for the success of the Worcester teatn can be given to no single n1·ernher. The Union and R. P. I. tean1s, however strong in so1ne ·ev·ents, showed a lana·entable weakness in other'S, and thus it w:as no difficult 111atter for the Wor,cester n1en, who \vere equally strong in every event, to carry off the honors.

Committees Should Be Com- mended for Their Success in Making the Day What it Should be. \Vith the freshmen, Moving- tJ p Day began Friclay night. A large cr<)\Vd guarded the Idol all ni,g·ht, \vaiting for the Sophs to sho\\r up, but they were disappointed and were forced to make several trips around town to satisfy their desire for adventure. During one of these sallies, t\VO stray sophomores \Vere discovered wandering on the streets. They \Vere quickly surrounded and conducted royally to the can1pus \Vhere they entertain- ed the freshmen for a time by displaying their artistic talents. But it \vas not until five o'clock Saturday morning that the Sophs could 1nuster up enough strength or courage to fight. \\Vhen the freshn1en went down- to\vn to eat at about 4:30 A. M., a few dar- ing- sophs spilled a little green pa-int on the Idol and \Vaited the return of the enemy. \Vhen the enen1y did cotne they can1e \Yith a rush and that \Vas the last of the sophon1ores. The Idol 'vas at once painted red and the freshmen enjoyed a fast gan1e of ball before breakfast time. MOVING-UP DAY EXERCISES In the old chapel filled with guests, friends and students, the first of the Moving Up Day exercises began at eight thirty o'clock Satur- day morning. After the regular chapel ser- vices at which the class of 1913 appeared for their last thne, the seniors sang their class song and started on a march around the chapel. In the second time around the jun- iors stepped into line, and both classes passed in revie~r before the Terrace CounciL This \vas continued for four more tin1es, each titne the outgoing council selected a junior for the Terrace Council next year. The men to re- ceive this high honor were George Edvvard Levvis of Marion, N. Y.; John Taylor Ho\\rell of Newburgh, N. Y.; Stephen Bond Story of Hartford, Conn. and Frank Dorn Barclay of Schenectady. The march around \vas con- tinued, the two lower classes fa]ling into line until all four classes had been around the chapel. The juniors now took the seats heretofore occupied by the seniors, the class of 1915 took the former juniors' seats and the freshn1en left tl1e gallery and seated the1n- selves in the places vacatec1 by the sopho- mores. The A11ouette Song \vas sung, and headed by the eollege band, the students in classes marched to the Idol \'\Yhere the sec· ond part of the festivities took place.

In \'iei.Y of the gross n1is- ::;taten1ents and the general 11ntrnth of the article, \\rl' feel it our dnt}' to the co11ege and to the stnc1ent boc1y to 1nakL~ tt1e real truth kno\vn. \Ve regret exceedingly that any n1e1nber of this Boarc1 should so far forget his obliga- tions to the paper and to his \'t\hna Matcr, as to take the fact of sitnp1e conference, c1 is tort it till it has lost all sen1blance to its forn1er self, then add a mass of staten1ents regarding the college \veekly, sorne of then1 true, but tnost of thcn1 \Vholly false anc1 should then print the story in a nc\Yspaper, unc1er a scare- head. It \voulc1 seen1 that such action on the _part of any Union undergraduate would be ba:c1 enough, but it is absolutely inexcus- able and distinctly conten1ptible for a n1em- ber of the organization \vhich \vas attacked. Secretary \Valdron of the Graduate Coun- cil sent to the nevvspaper in question, a state- n1ent of the truth, but that organ refused to correct its n1istakes, preferring to Jiye up to its reputation for inaccuraC\'. Such being the case, 1.ve n1nst give a few facts here to set the matter right. The Con- corc1iensis Board is not being ''investigated'' by the Graduate Council, nor has that organ- ization either the power or the desire to do this. 1V1r. \Va1c1ron did not state that the Council intendecl to chr:u1g·e either the policy or the forn1 of the paper. l-Ie denies it a bso- 1ute1y. No senioT w-as '\~on1pelled to resign fron1 the Board\ this year. It 1.vas clone voluntarily. In on1 \' one place \\ras the rig·ht place saicl. It \vas stated that nltH.:h con1n1ent \vou1c1 arise on the I-1111.

Every me1nber of the Bo~trd real izc~ the defects ancl short con1ings of the Concorc1ien- sis and c\·ery n1an is \vcnking hard to e1itni- natc then1. \Vhy then, since this is the case, should these defects be heralded in eyery paper in the vicinity, \vhen absolutely no 0'~ <...., ft s ~- OJ 1Y Sl a< a~ < ti u: I h; I· ti yt le 111 \' a~ f d1 }·.' ac ' II I a1 it it 1: p~ l tl !1 u ~ . f 1 1n hj '· 01 ; . lS h( \\ ~· ~ 111 J ·, ' . ; I fll ~ ' •· te t t f at '-\'\' l-~~· rc ll ,, l··· st ~·-: i• !' 1 ~ .\ )·- t• .. ,-, '/

f }·,, I I· THE CONCORDIENSIS 11 good can be done and .. when definitely harm- ful effects n1ay be produced on the college. Shall we call this college spirit, to injure one's Aln1a Mater withoutcause? The state- lnent of a truth is one thing, but that san1e sin1ple fact, t\visted and distorted \Yith the additions and e1nbel1ishtnents of a vivid 1111- agination beco1nes a tr·uly marvelo11s crea- tion. Thus it vvas .. with that story. Had the unadorned truth been told, no harm would have been clone, but as it is, no one can es- tilnate the effects of its \vide distribution. We have various plans formulated for next year and \Ve expect to carry them out reg·arcl- less of any notoriety w ·hich may be added by unscrupulous n1embE rs of the student body. vVe feel that the present Board is as capable as an other body of 1nen to edit the Concor- diensis. yet \Ve are ahvays \Yilling to receive achTice. \Ve do ask tl1is ho\\rever. \Vhen any one has any iclea to give us, please bring it to one of the editors rather than covcnng it \Yith untruth and publishing it in ev-ery payer \Yithin a radius of fifty miles. VVe think it \Yi11 stand a better chance nf reach- in,~- the proper indiviclna]s. If a n1an is sick, his doctor does not \Vri te to President ~Tilson or l{aiscr \iV11he1m, and te11 then1 \Yhat the is. H~.: is n1ore 1 k ~ ~Y t > be successft1l if cr r-: he tells the sick n1an hin1se1f, or his nurse. \Ve leave th~s to you as a fair analogy to this 111ost unfortunate affair and w·c trust that any future ''reforn1ers'' \Yi11 think t\\Ticc and count ten before they \vrite to the papers about any ''deplorable condition'' in co11ege. ---:0:-- Hereafter Cornell u P1)erclassn1en \Yi11 ca11 regularly upon freshn1en to see that they get started rig-ht.

The meet \Vas very closely contested and at the begin- ning it seemed that Union would be swan1ped, Hamilton easily capturing sixteen out of eighteen points in the dashes. Hamilton was also easily the victor in the weight events but in the distances and the jumps Union captured everything in sight. Baker '14, featured as greatest point \vin- ner, securing first in the pole-vault, broad jump and high jump and third in the 220- yard and 100-yard dashes. His vvork was exce11ent throughout, and he easily defeated Han1ilton's star high jumper at 5 ft 5 1-2 in. Lee of Hamilton \vas greatest point-vdnner for the Buff and Blue, scoring thirteen points, taking first in the 100-yard clash, the 220- yard dash and second in the broad jun1p. LaBarron captured first in the quarter and half n1iles, running the former in 53 sec., 3-5 of a second ahead of the Hamilton record. Rogers \vas in splendid form and took first place in the mile \vith LaBarron second \vhile a fe\v tninutes later, he finished second to '· Bob '' in the half. Tren1per \VOn t0e t\vo- tni1e race by half a lap easily. In deed he slo\ved do\vn and walked in at the finish.

About fifteen undergraduate n1en1bers of the society were present, together with Roy W. Peters, '12, and Professor McKean, who were guests of the students. Charles T.

The banquet was a success fron1 every view point and it is to 1be hoped that the idea will becom·e a fixe-d custom. T~ruax, '14, and Coul- ter.

i I : I 1 ) THE 'CONCORDIENSlS private edification; instead of being· read in the class like those of her cotnrades. Hovv- ever, it \:Vas not until she was twenty-ope that her education began in:earnest, \vhen she, like her contemporary, pursued a private course in reading and systen1atic study. Both \VGmen began their successful literary activities at the same age and i11 the san1e manner. George Sand began her literary career by the contributions to the French Re- view ''Figaro.'' Likewise, Geo1·ge Eliot in the infancy of her career, was a contributor to the HWestminister Revievr\ and later be- came connected with the magazine in an ed- itorial capacity. Both wemen assumed a masculine pseudonym and as fate would have it, each chose the surname \George'' for her ano .~tnous name. Both women attracted to thetnselves the friendships of eminent men,. ~lthough neither could lay any claim to beauty. George Eliot formed lasting friend- ships vvith Herbert Spencer, the great schol- ar, and other literary men, among the\Ql John Chapman, editor of the \\Vestminister Revie\v'' and (}eorgc Henry I...,ew··is, a disciple of Comte. Among the n1en of genius \vhotn George Sand attracted to herself \Vere Bal- zac, the great realist; Sainte- Bettve, the critic; Chopin, the n1usician; DeMusset, the poet; and other men \vho have left their n1ark in the \vorld Both \i\romen \vere careless of convention, disregarded universally accepted traditions, and set up their O\Vll standards of ethics. George Sand took trips to Italy or S\vitzer- land vvith DeMusset or Chopin regardless of recognized fortn or convention. Sh~ made the poet and the n1usician utte1·ly miserable by spurning them after a love affair. George Eliot forn1ed a union vvith George Henry Le\vis, a legal divorce from his first \vife be- ing impossible. She considered the union as equivalent to a legitimate marTiag-e. Both \VOtnen protested against social 'v1~ong and injustice and against the a bsoh1te indissolu- bility of mart iage. They clain1 that many of our moral laws vvere founded on false eri teria. On account of their vie·ws, both women feU into disfavor but emerged into high favor in their later life. Both writers exercised a \vonderful power of concentration, and were prolific in their producdons. The French George, however, \vrote without any definite preconceived out- line, ·w \hereas the English George planneGl her work to son1e degree. This may ac- count, in a measure, for the fact that George Eliot has enjoyed more lasting popularity than her contemporary. Finally each was the greatest woman writer of her respeeti ve country. The cornpatibility of their lives is is a proof of an old parable, '' great minds flow in the same channels '' and a ground for a new one, 4 'great lives tread the san1e path.\ ELIOT SAND --:0:•-- Phi Gatnma Delta held a formal dance Fri- day evening, May 23, at the chapter house on the can1·pus.
