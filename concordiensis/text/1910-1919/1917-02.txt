They thought, perhaps, that a circus had come to to;;n- for they could not know that the lordly sophomores of Old Union\ had ordered every freshman to wear a cap-a badge vvhich would disting·uish him from the boys of the town. \Let us set them apart by means of a funny cap,\ the Sophomores had said, ''and when they have acquired the co~leg~ 'tangue' in manners and apparel they may lay these caps as1de. So much for fact and theory in the past. . . Today the freshman cap serves only as a mark of d1g111t:f. It is no longer necessary to '''distinguish\ the freshman an- ficially because he has not assimilated the col~ege \atmosphere.\ Todav with a little taste and observat1on he may clothe himself with all the careful \touches\ of the most fashionable semor. Colleae tailoring is largely responsible for this, and Hart, Schaffner b & Marx are the recognized tailors of the college world. · Their Varsity Fifty-Five suits are the last ·word i.n fashion.
