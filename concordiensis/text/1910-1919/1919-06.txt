The Story of Your Study Lamp EDISON'S FIRST LAMP I F you were studying by an old smoky oil lamp and suddenly a mo.dem, sun-like MAZDA lamp were thrust into the room, the contrast would be dazzling. That instant would unfold the result of thirty years' development, research and manufacturing in electric lighting. And this development commem.:ed with Edison's first lamp-hand-made, when electricity was rare. The General Electric Company was a pioneer in fore~eeing the possibilities o-f Edison\s invention. Electric generators were developed. Extensive experiments led to the design and construction of apparatus which would obtain electric current from far -away waterfalls and deliver it to every city home. With power lines well distributed over the country, the use of electric lighting extended. Street lighting developed from the flickering arc to the great white way. Electric signs and floodlights made our cities brilliant at night, searchlights turned night into day at sea, and minia- ture lamps were produced for the miner's headlight and automobile. While the making of the electrical indus- try, with its many, many interests, was developing, the General Electric Com- pany's laboratories .continued to improve the incandescent lamp, and manufacturing and distributing facilities were provided, so that anyone today can buy a lamp which is three times as efficient as the lamp of a few years age.
