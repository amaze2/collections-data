The women of Stanford University are to erect a $25,ooo clubhou:se soon which will include a hall and stage, a dining-room as well as music .and entertainment rooms. An arrangements has been made between the University of Pennsylvania and the University of La Plata in :South America, where by these two universities are to exchange students every year. Columbia, following the example of Chicago University, has established a students' bank. The bank is connected with the bursar's office and . pays no interest. At the University of Winnipeg, the lecture sys- tem is used exclusively. This is the system used in many European universities, especially at Ox- ford., England. Work has been begun at Columbia on the con- struction of the new architectural school build- ing, following the announcement of an anony- mous gift of $330;000 presented for that purpose. The Cornell, Princeton and Yale crews wiii this year hold a triangular race on May 20 over the Lake Carnegie course at Princeton. Prince- ton has never before had an eight-oared crew, and Yale has not rowed Cornell for many years. Cornell recently received two gifts of $so,ooo and $3oo,ooo respectively for the erection of new bt~ilclings. The first gift is for a fireproof hous- ing for the machine shop of Sibley college, and the second from Mrs. Russell Sage, for a dormi- tory for the women of the university not quar- tered in Sage college.

THE CONCORDIENSlS. IS THE RETURN OF THE SPECTATOR. Union, 7; N. Y. U., 6. II. 1 n1ust indeed confess I am infinitely delighted with my phases of twentieth century life; yet I cannot but feel, on more intimate acquaintance with it, that my presence· is rather in the nature of an anachronisn1. This sentiment of mine was some\vhat strengthened last week by a most tact- ful letter which came to 1ne fron1 one of my new friends, rallying tne upon my style and humor. I shall give my reader a copy of his letter below: Dear Spec-Your recent article was pretty fair, but that Rip Van Winkle stuff don't go here. Be- lieve n1e, Spec, N ebuchadnezzar the First or the city of Scotia haven't much on you as the dead- est things on the market. A ton of dynamite n1ight help you some but I've another little hunch that will give you just as effective a jolt and put you i,n right. The baseball team goes to New York this week and I run the show. I'm the man that can introduce you to the Big City right and show you a lot of swell places. You'd better come with us. * * * * Yours ever, Nackey. I1aving journeyed to the city by boat, we found A stately and dignified gentleman, by his attire a s,ervitor, by his face a peer of the reahn, greeted us and began to minister our wants. \Ve could not but blush at such a personage's performing menial offi·ces for us. \iVith some difficulty and the aid of a:H, Manager Slyde finally recognized roast beef ancl potatoes upon the elaborate but intricate ·Parisian n1enu and these we supple- tnented with demi-tasse-cups of cafe noir (spec- tacular French). Our ben.-efactor brought these viands, glancing down his nose n1eanwhile with an expression of extren1e scorn, as I thought; but I grossly misjudged him for he graciously re- fused the two nickels and a din1e which were proffered hitn for his services. We decided that henceforth we would adorn a less pretentious table at the famous (if not notorious) cafe d'un Enfant. Yet ~ ackey naively expressed the sen- timent of our party when he said: \It's a d-n pity the Cucutnberland isn't a little larger so that everyone who comes to New York can stop there.\ After lunching in such regal fashion, we en- deavored to reach the catnpus of our opponents via sub-way. One learns many things in a metro- politan tunnel. A down-town express will sel- don1 afford the quickest n1.eans of conveyance to Cniversity Heights. It is not considered the best form to ren1ain upon the threshold of a car un- til the gate is mechanically closed upon one. No nice person is impertinent to the patient guards. All questions are courteously ignored. Guessing is equally certain to following an I-know-all- about-X ew~ York frotn Hackensack, N. J. * * * * ourselves, about mid-day, a dazed and breathless group, huddled close beside the curb before that imposing lodging house, the Cucumberland. The ghastly up-town trip was but a hideous recollec- tion. We could even smile-though weakly. Manager Slyde was the first to recover and seem- ingly at his ease, herded us past a crimson- liveried Cerberus into the great hall of the hos- telry. Straightway we were assailed by a host of Enifonned youths bent on pilfering our luggage. I was very well pleased at the sturdiness with vvhich some of my companions defended their property, Valser being especially resolute so that none could wrest his carpet bag frotn him. ::.:-ext we were crowded into a little cage, called a lift, and dropped up seven stories in direct perversion of Sir Isaac's principle. Upon gain- ing our new quarters, roll was called and Van Keef alone was found lost. Him, a searching party located presently in the lift where he was prolonging the pleasurable sensation of leaving Here my editor, with somewhat the same bored indifference with which Mr. Andrew Carnegie separates coupons from IO I per cent. interest bear- ing honds, has severed the tnost brilliant and witty portion of my paper and relegated it to a receptacle containing other wasted paper. I gathered fron1 some nouveau perishe (more French) shade in Hades that the United States once protnulgatecl freedom of the press. His staten1etlt, I regret to state, was not justifiable. * * * * Having won our victory and lost our heads in our subsequent hilarity, we proceeded to cetc· bra te. I ndeecl, I was so far carried away by my enthusiastn and high spirits (Editor's Note: Mr. Addison does not refer to the exorbitant prices of certain n1etropolitan dram shops.) that I de- himself behind. When we had again descended to the main hall, we were ushered into a luxurious banquet hall.

College life doesn't differ very much the world over, once you have forgotten the peculiarity of language, names and dress. And here, in this Atnerican coHege in Syria, \The Syrian Pro- testant College\ by nan1e, you will find very 1nuch the same sports that are found in any col- lege at ho1ne. Here, however, there are no inter- collegiate rivalries for there are no other col- leges near enough to rival, so contests have to be held bet\iveen departments; but with more than eight hundred students divided amongst the four departn1ents there is ample scope for the n1ost intense college spirit. The chief college sports are association foot- ball, basketball, track and field events, and, after Easter, swimming. They are all out of door sports for the weather pern1its outside gatnes all of the year. The students enter into these sports with as much enthusiasm as ever inspired a foot- ball game or track meet between Union and any other institution. There is som,ething in the genus student that, given a fair stretch of foot- ball field or a quarter tnile cinder path, n1akes hitn take to the1n as naturally as a sophomore to books or a junior to society. An athletic team here is made up of various races. Just at present the best man in short runs is a Greek, Costas Georgiou. He runs the one hundred yards dash in ten and four-fifth seconds. The best half miler is Othrnan Abaza, an Egypt- ian; and in the mite an Abyssinian, Mikhaim U ghbaghaber, holds the honors. The high jutnp is carried off by a young giant from Mount Le- banon, Fuad Taki-ud-Din. Photographer'' WHITE, 229 State Street Near {!3arney's A fi.eld 1neet in Beirut has plenty of local color. That is true, of course, everywhere but there is more of color in this part of the world than na- turaHy prevails about Old Dorp. The athletic field itseH is on a bluff just above the wonder- fully bhte Mediterranean. Only twenty miles away rises the crest of the Labanon Mountains, J ebei Sun in, capped with snow, dazzlingly white in the bright sunshine. The field is green and there are wild flowers in ,every corner. A great crowd of n1ore than a thousand people gather for the events. There are government officials in bright unifonns and medals. There is the society of Bei~rut resplendent in dresses a la mode de Paris or according to the fashion of Syria. And everywhere there is the red tarbush (fez) with its black waving tassel, making the whole scene look like a great field of bright red popptes. And then there are the contestants themselves. The Greek in regular running suit, spiked shoes and all, yet an athlete ready for the Olympic gatnes.; the swarthy Egyptian or Syrian strong of muscle and clean of litnb, hurling the graceful jareed; and the shiny black Abyssinian with running suit of white and beautiful pink socks to set off his ebony hue. But as said before, forgetting the colors and the names and the languages, college students are much the same the world over. So the ban- ners and songs and college yells quite make a field tneet in Syria very closely resetnble similiar events in Schenectady. Fallowing is the college yell: Rah·! Rah! Rah! Rip Rah Reel Boom-la Boon1-la S. P. C. And the chorus of the college song, Look before us! Shout the chorus! See the banners wave- S. P. C., to thee all glory, Make us true and brave. 5 - - - c ...

THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. 34 APRIL 4, 1911 NO. 21 CAPITOL FIRE OF INTEREST TO UNION COLLEGE STUDENTS The Capitol fire of last week proved to be a spectacle interesting to many Schenectadians, in- cluding practically the entire studenthody at Union. The first news of the blaze that was re- ceived on the campus was brought by \Beefy\ Leon, who was an eye witness of the start of the fire. He arrived on the Hill early in the morning and gave the information. Scarcely had the first word been heard before the campus be- gan to be vacated by the students. During the day almost every fellow on the Hill found time to spend at least a few hours on the scene of excitement. Albany was alive with Union 1nen. On every corner could be seen groups of undergraduates gathered in interested conversation. As a n1em~ ber of one of the Albany departments of Union put it, one would think that the dream of the Al- banians had come true and that Union college was at last located in Albany. As the day drew to a close, however, the fellows began to wander back all glad to find a night's rest in Old Dorp. ALUMNI OF EASTERN NEW YORK BANQUET ON BEEFSTEAK. The annual reunion of the Union College Alumni of Eastern New York was held Tuesday evening at the Hampton Hotel in Alba~y. About forty-five members were present, hut although s1nall in nun1bers their enthusiasn1 .was not lack- ing. A beefsteak dinner was served; dur.ing which 1nany college songs were sung. Charles H. Mills, '72, presided. Amo·~1g the chief speakers were Charles H. Peck, '59; W. P. Judd, '73, and President Richmond, who reviewed the work of the college in 1833 as co1npared with the present. Charles N. Waldron, ;o6, s·ecretary of the graduate council, spoke of the work of the various alt1111ni associations. PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESSFUL INTERSCHOLASTIC DAY BRIGHT. The prospects for Interscholastic Day to be held May 20 appear very bright. Answers to the invitations to compete have been received by Manager Cavert from nearly all of the Jast year's tea.ms, and in addition to these, Corinth, Utica and Bu.ffalo high schools will be strongly repre- sented. As the 2oth conflicts with the respective dates of the Troy and Cambridge high schools meets, these teams will be unable to compete. The plan is being discussed of giving the sub- freshmen visitor's buttons instead of ribbons as has been done in the past. A button is a sou- venir which would be kept by the students while a ribbon is usually lost before the day is over, thus 1naking it impossible for the track and base- ball managers to distinguish the sub-freshmen. A neat two-page program will be printed and given free, not only to the sub-freshmen, but to everyone else as well. SOCCER FOOTBALL TO BE PLAYED FOR SPRING PRACTICE. A new step for the advancement of athletics at Union is 'the spring football practice. This will probably begin about May Ioth; lasting two weeks. There will be punting and passwork, and an important department is soccer football which will be played. The main point of the spring practice will be the attention to past injuries such as weak ankles, sprained wrists, etc., and also to the class standing of the team candidates. Coach Kuolt is also desirous of instituting a new style of pass which will greatly strengthen team work. It is hoped that the spring practice will prove as successful here as it has in other colleges. The big chimney on the rear of Washburn I-Iall was torn down last week. It had caused 1nuch anxiety of late because of the high winds and it \Vas thought safer to have it out of the way.

b 'fHE CONCOH.DJENSlS. A NEW DEPARTMENT. The following co·rrespondence explains itself. The Concordiensis is to try this new departn1ent n1uch as an experiment. We feel confident that it will prove satisfactory and interesting. After the first installn1ent has appeared we shaH be glad to hear frorn our readers just how the inno- vation is received.-·· Editor's note. Mr. Editor :-Several weeks ago I was so fGr- tunate as to happen upon an issue of your es- teetned paper, The Concordiensis. On reading it through I noticed that no space at all was devote<l to cnttctstn. My interest being aroused, I took the· pains to read several other copies and in not one was I able to find an article of 'this sort. I, Mr. Editor, am a critic. My business is to go fron1 college to college and whenever I see any- thing that does not seen1 just right I knock. So1netitnes I knock hard and then again I give but a gentle tap. It is my firm belief that the only way to better conditions in our American college is to find fault. Praise flatters and causes slackness; criticisn1 cuts and incites bettennent. And, Mr. Editor, n1y proposition is this. For two hundred and fifty dollars ($zso) I will agree to ren1ain at Union college for a period of ten (I o) weeks. In other words if you will pay me twenty-five dollars ($zs) per week for ten con- secutive weeks I ·will take up rny residence amongst the students of Union. It will be tny duty in fulfilling my part of the contract to criticise whatever I may believe is deserving of cnt1ctsn1. I also agree to write little essays in various topics of my own selection and now and then I shall write humorous happenings that con1e to 1ny attention. Knowing sotne few students at Union college I feel that I cannot help to cause sotne fun. May I hear from you in the near future and know what you think of n1y proposi- tion, I am, s1r Your obedient servant, WOOD B. A:CDISON. My clear Mr. Addison :-Your letter of Feb- r ary 30th is at hand. Your idea is indeed a new one and if it is all you say I catinot help but believe it is an excellent one. I n·ave talked your proposition over with my staff and wr have d~dded that we will s_ign a ·contract with you upon the following con.ditions: (r) You rnust furnish credlentials andre- ferences as to past .experience. (2) You n'lust agree to take all blame and stand responsible for all cen- sure that n1ay foHow your writings. (3) You must furnish bond for ten thou- sand dollars ($Io,ooo) that will prove to us that you are respon- sible. U ncler these conditions we shall be pleased to have you with us for a periocl: of ten weeks. Very truly yours, Editor of Concordiensis. My dear Mr. Editor:-Your letter received and as per your contract I am furnishing the things required. You perhaps wilt notice that I have been etnployed by n1any of the leading colleges of the country and have some very flattering recommendations. I was to spend sotne time at Han1ilton college, but I fear the Hatnilton boys are a little hard pressed for 1noney-perhaps be- cause of social responsibilities at \Ut.\ or be- cause they feel that an attem})t at criticisn1 would he useless. Any way the co11tract was cance lied. To con1plete tl:e contract and to get a better idea of n1y work I shall come to Schenectady on Sat- t:.rday. I remain, sir Your obedient servant, \iVOOD B. ADDISON. UNFAVORABLE WEATHER HINDERS EARLY BASEBALL PRACTICE. The baseball teatn will open its season with New York University at New York next Satur- day. As this is the fourth game for the New York tean1 and as the Garnet men have been kept frotn practice by bad w,eather, this will be a hard initial struggle. However, with a large per cent .of last year's teatn back and several fresh- n~an players to strengthen the teatn, it is not too nn·.ch to expect success. Coach Bergan has hacl the n1en out for light practice only, such as .batting and fielding. This week, however, it is expected that an infield will be laid out on the site of the old skating rink where practice will be held until the regular dia- n1ond is ready for use.

T;HE NEW With this is.:Hi,e of tb·8 Oon\cor BOARD. diensis the newly elected editorial hoard for the season. of T9II-I9I2 assutnes direction of the publication for the first time. The retiring head of the hoard has worked unceasingly to raise the standard of the paper, and in spite of duties along many oth·er lines of student activities and innutnerable difficuhies in connection with publishing the weekly the results of his efforts have been seen in a n1:ore attractive and interesting weekly. As each st.uceecling board carefuHy lays its plans to improve the paper during its short tern1 of office so the present boarcl intends to di:rect its effort. How- ever, we shall tnake no protnises as to th:e future 1ssues. J\' ew conditions require readj ustn1ents and as each n1ember of the board is now filling an entirely new position in relation to tlite paper sotne little tit:ne must necessarily el'a.pse befor~ the best results are forthcoming. OUR It is the intention of the present POLICY. hoard of editors to adopt a distinct policy, or perhaps it tnight better he called a de fi·ni te ain1, that is, the Concorcliensts will endeavor to n1ake steady progress towards the bettern1ent of certain undesirable conditions, which, as in other colleges, exist here. Just what this policy will be has not yet been de- cided and it is probable that it will not be an- nounced until the first issue of the fall tern1. We do not wish to appear infected with the .:'radical reforn1\ germ, although several college ·publica- tions have shown sympton1s of being so afflicted, but it does seetn probable that by concentrating its efforts towards the accotnplishtnent of a par- ticular end a student paper rnight be the n1eans of making its presence felt in a profitable tnan- ner. Several plans are already under considera- tion, but it will take son1e little titne to select the tnost feasible. OUR Upon our readers, particularly our READERS. undergraduate readers, falls a great responsibility in the publication of The Concordiens-is. It lies with you i 11 a great 1neasure whether or not the p~per is alive ancl oreezy-and even a weekly 1nay have both of these qualities. A far better publication would result fron1 the co-operatiot1 of the student body. == B y v fi t< s t e b v t 1 t c

I know that Orpheus with magic strain led rocks and trees and beasts to follow hin1 and so en- thra:lled the underworld that angels gazed thereon with envy. I know that Timotheus with won- drous n1elody subdued the riotous Alexander, awoke within his haughty soul etnotions high as heaven ancl instincts low as hell, and with a skil- ful change of chord displaced upon the n1onarch's lips a sigh of pity with a curse of hate.

I know that w·hen Cecelia sang angels were fascinated and n1en enraptured.

SUGGESTIONS FOR \THE CONCORDY.\ Schenectady, ::-\\. Y., March 29, IQ I r. Ecl.i tor of \The Con corcliensis.\ If a rnere freshn1an would be allowed to put in a word in regard to the policy of the \Concorcly I would suggest that it strive to fill the office and perfonn the duties of a student's weekly and not of a daily newspaper. In n1y opinion, it would he better to give very briefly the college news of the ·week, which was already published in the c1.aily papers; and give rather fully news of in- terest to students that we can't expect fron1 the local papers or such news that they have failed to give us. In tny opinion, the \Concordy\ should be of the character of the ''Cornell Widow\ and not of the ''Corn ell Daily Sun.\ In our case, 'tis bet- ter to be the head of the fly that~ the tail of the lion. It oug-ht to be n1ore of a literary and co1nic weekly than a news weekly. Our splendid \Gar- nets\ give a1nple proof of proficiency and n1any poen1 and prose writers and pen sketchers; and if the \Concordy'' urged and frequently asked students for contributions I think there would be big results. I earnestly hope that the \Optic\ will be re-

I I i I f ~ ~ THE CONCORDIENSlS VO'L, 34 APRIL 11, 1911 NO. 22 UNION PLAYS WINNINQ- BALL A,GAINST NEW YORK UNIVE,RSITY And Scores Seven Runs to N. Y. U.'s Si:x,......,Fair- bairn and Shaw Feature. The game with New York University was a very pleasant d.isappointment to the stucl.ents, es- pecially as there have been doubts in the minds of even the most optimistic as to the result of the first ga.me, which came before the nine had a single outdoor practice. It was gloomy out- look Thursday night when the team left Sche- nectady withoHi its captain. The usuaHy string- ent faculty rules gave. way in the extre~ity and J it was voted to allow the teatn to start the trip twenty-four hours earlier in order that it 1night be possible for the players to get its first outdoor practice. \i\fhen the two nines lined up on the Ohio field Saturday aJternoon the little crowd of Union rooters, which though small nearly equalled the N. Y. U. Sl.tp})orters, }:lad many misgivings as to the outcon1,e, thoug-h their cheering did not in the least boetray their feelings. The New York tean1 had played several games this season and was in shape t() play its best ball. Alpert started the gan1e in the box for lJnion and in the seven innings that he twirled al- lowed the N evv Yorkers but three hits. .Owing to an accident in sliding to hase in the seventh inning he bad to retire from the game and Dan O'Keefe t()ok his place. Nauman was then plac- ed at center field. Dan showed himself to be in excellent condition and ended the game without allowing his opponents another hit. Fairbairn and ·Shaw prayed the best quality of ball for Union.

'h THE CONCO,RDIENSlS. GARNET TO BE PUT ON SALE THE FIRST OF MAY OR BEFORE. More Than Three Hundred and Fifty Illustra .. tions to Fill the Pages-Albany Departments Not Included This Year. More than one-half of the 1912 Garnet has al- ready been printed and the remainder will be rvn off during the Easter recess. In1mediately after the vacation, the work of binding will he co111111enced and the book will be on sale before the first of May. This is nearly a m .. onth behind the t.in1e scheduled for its appearance, but many unforeseen circumstances have combined to pre~ vent its earlier publication. The book will be the 1nost elaborate that Union college students have yet issued. Its three hun\'\ cl.red and fifty pages will be illustrated with more than that nun1ber of photographs and drawings and a decorative border will be used on each page. For the first ti1ne in many years, there wiH be a colored frontispiece. Every department of the book has its full page head cut while s1naller drawings and photographs of the carnpus are liberally scattered throughout. M. E. Untermeyer, 'r2, is responsible for most of the drawings and his brilliant ideas may be traced through the entire book. The book itself will be bound in Garnet leather and the cover design will be stamped in gold on the outside cover. The first edition will consist of three hundred copies and more will appear as demanded. The editors have felt that the Garnet is no longer a university book and with this idea in n1ind, have omitted much of the Albany copy. Its place will be taken by material which seems better fitted to the Garnet as a distinctly college book They have felt that this is a change which can work only for the betterment of the Garnet and that it is a step toward having an annual of which we may be justly proud. FIRST ANNUAL INTER-UPPERCLASS DEBATE WON BY THE JUNIORS. Both of the upper classes were out in force to witness the first annual interclass debate, which took place in the college chapel Wednesday af- ternoon. There has been considerable rivalry :between the classes in regard to debating each one claiming the better team, and a deep interest was n1anifest in the interclass debate. The question was: \Resolved that woman suf~ f:rage shouid be granted in New York state.\ The juniors were ably represented by Peters, Mann and Potter. The seniors by Gordon, Bray and Cavert. Doctors Hoffmann, Bennett and Hale acted as judges,, and rendered a decision in favor of 1912 who upheld the neg:ative side of the question. PRESIDENT TO HAVE BUS·Y MONTH.

Cap- tain-l\1anager Fairbairn is to he congratulated upon the list of lTJatches arranged for the spring term. Tbe schedule favors the student consicler- ah1y by including five and possih1y other matches on the hon1e c::n.: .. rts. The opposing tean1s indude some of the fastest c0Hege tennis organizations in the country, notably Wesleyan, Mic1igan and ~yr;:c;.:;;e. T~:c ga:-ne, as ~n int:::rc.Jl!egiate ::port, is cotnparatively new at Union and for that rea- son, among others, should :be well supported by the stuclentbocly. The tennis tax, that was levied upon the students by the action of the student body, is not exorbitant, when the expenses of managing an organization where no admission is charged at the gan1es, is taken into consideration. EYery student, who has not yet paid the tax, should, at the earliest opportunity, turn the m.oney over to ti~e manager. Tbos~ t~oll~g~ B~Hs. Those college hells, those college bells, Cnti1nely titne their tolling tells- And at titnes they are not tolled at all. There- by hangs a tale, which, when told, n1ay perhaps have a telling effect upon the toilers. Such is our atm. On Monday afternoon of last week the failure to ring the bells, or at least the failure to ring then1 sufficiently long to ·b.e heard in a north-central roon1 i 11 \Nash burn Hall, had a near-disastrous effect upon a 1i ttle group of toil- ers and their professor_ In brief the case ts as follows: The professor narrowly, if not quite, n1issecl reaching· a State street structure during banking hours, a toiler all but broke an engage- 111ent with the Concorcliensis board, and the re- citation was pro!onged 11 fteen n1inutes. This is not the only tin1e that an irregularity has been noted in the ringing of the bells for recitations. Irregularities have occurred frequently-alto- gether too frequently. Faculty n1e1nbers and students alike are inconvenienced by tl1e careless- ness on the part of the bell-ringers, which is en- tirely avoidable.

TIIE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 In the college library are to be £ound records of Union that date back to the founding of the institution in I 795- Among the catalogs and ''laws of the college,'' as they we.re called then, there are many curious and amusing rules and custon1s that will doubtless be of interest to readers of the Co11cordiensis. When possible space will he given for printing a few of the rules and regulations as they appeared in the old records. Only the most interesting of the paragraphs will he printed. The original style of printing ancl spelling will be followed as far as our n1odern type will permit. The following extracts are taken from \Laws of Union College'' published in 1802: CHA.P. I. Of Admission Into College. Sec. 2. Candidates for ad1nissi,on shall be ex- amined by the President, or by two, at least, of the other Officers. It shall be the duty of the Oftl.cers of the College to attend at the annual examination of candidates, unless necessarily otherwise en1ployed in the business of the Col- I ege. K o one shaH be admitted into this Col- lege, unless he can with facility and accuracy, read, construe and parse, at least, six books of Virgil's Aeneid, four orations in Cicero, and the four Evangelists in Greek; and shall have learned English Gratnrnar, and Vulgar Arithn1etic, and shall exhibit suitable testimonials of his good n1oral character. Sec. 12. The price of tuition, for each of the students, shall be twenty dollars per annum, a proportional part (according to the length of each session of business) to be paid in advance to the Treasurer or Steward, a i the comrnence- n1ent of the session. In addition to which each student shall pay four dollars a year for room- rent, to be paid as above directed; except those students, who occupy roon1.s in the fourth story, who shall pay two dollars only.

Basketball took a new lease on life in Sche- nectady this winter owing to the record of the Union CoHege teatn. The season was closecl with a I9-IS score over the fast aggregation from. Syracuse University. The tean1 played an un usuaHy hard schedule fron1 the standpoint of the ability of 1ts oppon- ents and has established a standard of excellence not soon to be surpassed. The tean1 was fortunate at the start in having four experienced n1en who had played together for two years, and their strength was augmented by McKinstry of the pharn1a.cy depart1nent, who proved by his brilliant work as forwa.rd that he had an aptitude for the gan1e. His accurate shooting, wonderful speed and ability to outguess his opponent were 1narked features of his work. Coward at guard with his team n1ate Fairbairn tnacle a wonclerfully efficient combination and a n1ore aggressive pair of guards would be hard to nP.cl. Cowa.rd's experience as a forward had n1ade hin1 a so1:1rce of continual surprise to his oppon- ents and his unexpected onslaughts on the enen1ies basket were a strong factor in the scor- . In g. He has shown ability in shooting fouls, scoring nine out of ten atten1pts in the seco11d Colgate game in which he alone 1nade n1ore points than the entire Colgate tean1. Fairbairn always cool and alert was the most aggressive 1nan on the teatn and his work at all tin1es was brilliant and cons is tent. Heque1nbourg, although greatly hatHlicapped in weight ancl strength fitted well into the tearn play. As the season advanced his accuracy i11 shooting improved and in addition to being the hest dribbler on the teatn, he has gotten awa::y fron1 his opponent repeatedly for open shots a.t the goal. Captain Micks was an all itnportant factor 111 the developm.ent of team play. Tall and seldon1 outjtunped he has consistently contributed to the effectiveness of the com bi nation work, particular- ly in the Colgate game when repeatedly goals were scored within a very short tin\le after the hall was put in play.

After the pub rica tion of the correspondence be- tween Mr. Schermerhorn, and myself, which ap- peared in last week's issue of the Concordiensis, it is hardly necessary to state who I am and what my purpose is.

Reni!ernber. that, although my name is Addison, it :is not Joseph Addison; though I would copy tne style of this great 1nan, I ant but mediocre. · To any student of Union college I cordially extend the invitation to write me and ask whatever he would. I shall endeavor to an- swer hin1 as best I can and perhaps in this way we may co-operate and do a slight service for a grand old Alit'll.a Mater. My first contribution will appear in the next issue of the Concordiensis. Wood B. Addison. FRESS C~UB PLANS. A new plan has heen adopted by the Press club, which will be put into use at once. As usua;l, weekly reports will he sent to 1nany newspapers and particular! y to one newspaper in each county of this state. In addition to this, a daily bulletin will be sent to tnany papers in the east. During the past week n1ore than fifty special bulletins have been sent out to newspapers in New York state. An extra appropriation has been 1nade by the college to meet the expenses of the Press club for the re1nainde1· of the year. \TOMMY\ IS BASKETBALL CAPTAIN. .Lt\t the meeting of the basketball \aUa\ and \U\ men last -week, Thomas S.

Knapp, agricultural eli- rector, who has been in charge of the Farmers' Co-operative Demonstration Work in the agricul- tural departn1ent for the last nine years, died at his hon1e in Washington, D. C., on April rst. Dr. Knapp was one of the foremost experts in the department of agri.cnlture, and was respon- sible for the American rice which has developed until it is now worth over two million dollars a year. His work in connection with in1proving the corn crop of the south has been of the greatest in1portance, and uncler his direction this section produced last year one-third of the total An1erican output. A recent article on the work of :Cr. Knapp appearing in Su-ccess gave hin1 the credit of increasing our national wealth twenty n1illion dollars per annum. Dr. Knapp's death con1es as a shock to many of us at college as we 1aw hirn in excellent health at the Washington dinner less than a month ago. MUSICAL CLUB CONCERTS. The Musical club will give the last two con- certs of the season on April 21 in Albany, and on May I in the First JVIethodist church in Schenec- tady.

Having often received an invitation frotn the nntl ti-great-nephew of n1y worthy friend, Sir Roger de Coverley, to pass a fortnight with hirn at his college, I last week journeyed thither. It was with a feeling of sotne uncertainty, if not ap- prehension, I tnust needs adn1it, that I anticipated the visit; and I accepted rather out of regard for the n1e1nory which I cherish of Sir Roger him- self than because of any desire on my part to break the peaceful tnonoton y of my life as a shade. My good young frie11d's communication. assured n1e that he led the quiet and fruga-l life A a student and that he was well acquainted, through his perusal of 111y fonner speculations, with my retiring humor and would leave rne as much to tny own devices as I should think fit. It has aln1ost escaped 111e to n1ake n1en tion of the nan1e of tny worthy friend's descendant and likewise the institution at which he pursues studies of a higher nature. He is called Tris1tran1 which is indeed a good old name though I .Jnust adn1it n1y disappointm.ent that posterity has fail- ed to perpetuate the non1enclature of n1y worthy contetnporary. Tristrarn attends Union college at Schenectady (which appears to 111e a very quaint natne for a town). I find 1ny young friend cotnfortably set up in a very interesting abode, which he calls \The Lodge., (though in truth it is very little lik:e the quiet lodge on Sir Eoger's estate) and I a tn al- ready nntch at ease in tny new surroundings. Here I intend to fonn several ensuing specula- tions.

I f ouncl the play rather unusua 1, \a burlesque'' it was called, and sotnewhat lighter than the \Distressed Mother'' of lVIister Philips.

How- ever, I was touch.ed with a. secret joy at the sight of my young friend, who seetned to thor- ou.ghly enjoy this re1axa tion fro1n his duties. I even prevailed up()n hin1 to dr.ink a little ale :1 which he did with. relish. The lad seen1ed in- ' cleedJ so well pleased with these new diversions that I detennined to encourage hi1n in the future not to apply hitnself so rigorously to his books. The ale was of a very good quality and the evening passecl very entertainingly. I was surprised to perceive day to be breaking vvhen we reached hon1e. Tristram was very hag- gard and worn and.very red-eyed. My wits have begun to put two and two together.

T:-e Garnet nine clecisi vely defeated Trinity, on t:1c CH11pus, last Saturday by the score of seven to one. The hon1e team has been working hard cl.uri ng the vacation and Saturday's ga1ne showed that Union has a well balanced and heavy hit- ting team. 0 'l<eefe was the star of the, ga1ne, striking out foP:rteen tnen; bringing in tw·o runs by two hits ancl scoring once himself. His hotne run in the llr:;t inning vvas the feature of the gan1e. \Ht 1 tch '' also played a fast game, not a Trinity r:- an stole a base on hin1. ?'\ atunann, the only new 111 ember of the tea1n, showed up well and will proba hly make a regular position in right t1elcl. Trinity did not score until the seventh inning w·hen \Hutch\ let the third strike get hy hin1, ancl I~rainarcl reached second. He scored when TPrner n1acle a hit for two bases. LTnion scored two runs in the first inning. Fair- h~~.irn was hit hy a pitc~1ed ball, and can1e hon1e on 0 'Keefe's hon1e run. I 11 the second inning the Garnet tean1 scored three titnes. ''Hutch\ reached first on an error and was forced to second when Dennis was hit hy a pitched hall. :\autnann put a pretty bunt along the third base line which advanced each of the runners. \Hutch'' scored on Shaw's long ily to center field. Fairbairn reached first on an infield error, and Dennis scored, O'Keefe singled to left field and Ton11ny scored. In the fifth Union scored once. Biche hit to left field, was advanced to second on 0 unn' s .sacrifice and can1e h0111e on ''Hutch's\ hit. The seventh inning was the last in which the Yarsi ty scored.

Mr. Kellog vvas graduated from. Yale in the class of 1895, receiving the degree of B. A. Three years later he recei·vecl the degree of Ph. D. fr01n the satne institution. The year following his graduation he w·a s as si stan t in Latin at Yale and the next year i111ecl the position of instructor. Frorn 1899 to 1900 he studied il.~ Berlin, Munich and R on1e. In I goo he returned to Yal~ and for three years filled tl1e position of tutor in Latin. Fr01n 1903 to 1905 he was assistant professor 111 Latin and Greek at Willimns, going thence to Princeton.

TH £ CO:\CORDIE~SIS. 7 \THE A\DDIS COLUMN. There is an o!ld and co1nn1on saying that hon- esty is the best policy. And this, in~leed, ts a great truth. For if a 1nan be di:sli1onest who respect hin1? He may drink to ex,cess; he may be what is popu1 arly called wild, or he n1ay use language that is not fonnd ·in the vocabulary of a gentlen1an yet if he is iknown. to be an honest man the world forgives him. It seems to me, Mr. Reader, th.at this quality should stand fore- most in the n1ind of a co:Ilege man. For he is destined to lead. It is his duty and his privilege, because of his advantages, to help raise the tonr of our modern life. And I have often wonder- ed ,if col_lege men realize the importance of prac- ticing honesty in every act There seen1s to be a tendency to dev,elop a trait that is called clever- ness; a tendency to profit at the expense of others in tnatters see1ningly insignificant 'fhis fact is (letnonstrated every once in awhile :by class con1- mittees. It seetns to be a privilege and an un- questioned right for these n1en who are sup- posedly repres en ta tive n1en of the class to o·et b a little \rake off.\ And this is entirely wrong. It is an injustice to the comn1itteem·en who are most apt to countenance such action in bio-o-er bb things and it is an injustice to the dass or col- lege. Such a spirit should not exist. I also un- derstand that here at Union there is an honor systen1. This I consider a good thing-. For although a perfectly honest 1nan has not need of such a syste1n, having one of his own, it re- moves the tendency for a fellow to feel that his acts are q_uestionecl. The hope of the future rest in the hands of the educated n1an-ancl edu- cation coupled with stri:ct honesty ·cannot help to tnake this a better nation. \Nood B. Addison. CAS1'S FOR GREEK ROOM. Two large casts of sections .of the Parthenon frieze, copies of the Elgin Marbles i11 the British Museun1, have been added to the wall adorn- n1ents in the Greek redtation room!, The sec- tions are copies of slabs fron1 the frieze of the cella, representing in low relief the great Panath- enaic procession. President Richmond was 111- · strumental in procuring the casts. BASKETBALL SEASON REVIEW FROM THE PEN OF DR'. MAC. (Continued fron1 last issue.) The outcome of the season seven victories out of nine ga1ne·s is a source of gratification to every follower of Union's progor,ess. Union was fortunate in securing the services of Coach Kuolt who evolved a syste111 of four 1nan defense with liberal use of the dribble in ad- vancing the ball. The effectiveness of this sys- tem was n1ade apparent when Union scored .a 13-12 victory over \Vest Point to the surprise of all. When in the next gatne Rochester's fast five was beaten, followed by a decisive victory over M. I. T., the followers of the team realized that Union was playing hig-h class ball and winning on 111erit. The first defeat of the season administered by Colgate by the very close margin of four points on the latter's small hon1e court, but served to prove that on the regulation size court Union had the better team. This had abundant confir- tna tion later in the season when Colgate appeared in Schenectady and even with two full teatns in action, using eleven men in all was overwhelnl- ingly defeated. The gatne ·with Pratt was rough and n1arred by many fouls, but ·union was an easy victor. In the return game with Rochester the Garnet five suffered the only decisive defeat of the sea- son. It was an off night for the entire tean1 and Rcchester clen1onstrated her ability to play a good game on her hon1e court and won by a large score. Tf:e tean1 has been particularly strong on de- fense and by close covering has made it a dif- ficult n1atter for its opponents to put the ball through the metal ring. The majority of the points scored against the hon1e teatn have been made off fouls or long shots fron1 deep in court. The score at the end of the season stood l!nion, 204; opponents, 160. Botner Tinkelpaug-h has been elected captain of the freshn1en baseball tean1. A game has been :;checluled for next Wed·nesclay with the Sara- toga High school at that village.

Tb~ C~ncordi~nsis mana~~tn¢nt. Why is not the Concordiensis a better and tnore attractive paper? This question has been fre- quently asked. The query is natural, relevant, and, we think, not entirely unanswerable. Upon investigation we feel j·ustified in asserting that but little blame should be attached to the editorial department for the questionable. quality of the paper. Censure is n1ore justly placed upon the business n1anagement because of an unfortunate precedent that was established we know not how long ago, which has been unerring-ly adhered to hy each succeeding tnanager. So, in justice to fonner editorial boards and believing that knowl- edge of the inside workings of a student publica- tion is a prerogative of the unde,rgraduate sub- scribers we wish to state conditions that have ex- isted for some years back in connection with the business n1anagement of the Concordiensis. The business n1anagement and the editorial board have been entirely separate and inharmonious de- partn1ents; the one working for the financial and the other for the literary success of the paper. The unquestionable and unquestioned attainment of the former has made the attainment of the latter an utter impossibility. FoHowing are the facts. The business manager has always assutn- ed the financial risk of the publication and as his reward has always pocketed the inevitable pro- fits. The natural tendency of the manager has been to be as \suecessful\ as possible. Thus a precedent has been established, with the foHow- ing results. The editorial depart 11nent has had no n1vney for incidentals such as paste, paper and postage. No tnot~ey has heen available for cuts. The ousiness :tna nager has aUotted certain space for reading tnatter. H H:J.or:e advertise- nlents have been obtained this space _has been curtailed. If the editorial board has rnore n1at- .. ter than the space wiU pennit, t:l1 e articles have necessarily been cut down or cut out. An extra sheet (four pages) or a half sheet has been out of the question. ~ f i1t has been desired to itn- prove the appearance of tre pape~r by a better cover the nun1be'r of ~issues of the paper (which is to few to cover the college year in the first place) has been decreased to tneet the expense. The 1nanager and his assistants have exerted then1- selves to increase the nt11nber of advertisetnents and they have ohtaine~l the space. 'f'he editor and his assistants Hkewise labor to increase the an1ount of reading nl.atter and the space has been denied then1. Is such a state of affairs an incentive for increased efforts on the part of the editorial hoard for the improvement of the Con- cordi en sis? These ar.e strong expressions of ex- isting conditions, hut they are facts. E<1cL vf the assertions made above are specific: instati.ces in the experiences of recent editors. Should these condition exist? A brotl-:er of a .former tnan- .ager of the Concordiensis states that with effici- ent managen1ent the Concorclie nsis affords a tninimutn profit of 11 ve hundred clo Uars. He de- clined to state the maximum profit. One-fifth of the mini1nun1 profit would be suffieient to enable the editorial department to n1atedally improve · the publication. Due to the active interest of tnen1bers of the class of 1911 an<:l certain men1- bers of the faculty a publication board will, in the near future, regulate the financ:es of the paper. The paper does not come under tl~e fi.nancial su- pervision of this hoard until the fall of I() 12; but its influence has already heen f e1 t. Beginning with next fall the manager-elect, although under the same system as at present, bas signified his intentions of turn.ing over for editorial uses sums of n1oney each week that will rneet the needs of the departlnent to a great extent. With the graduation of the class of 1912 the entire paper will fall within the scope of the pu 1 blication board and the opportunities for a far better Con- cord.iensis are unlimited. - Tl of l Se stan gent fast in t: o'clc o'clc and 1ng If at his < o'dc not mak, fron: shall Se to p ficer best, PRE Tl 0 ffi C1 deta ai1d club potn quet hein P. :f:\ L. :E cessl a.~ a Sa tac~y SU111

Last Friday lnorn,ing Presideu.t Richn1ond was spokesman of a cot:n,mittee of three appointed by the Schenectady Cottnty Historical society at a conference with Governor Dix. The object of the conference was to induce the state to take over the historic :Glenn-Sanders Mansion of Scotia. The same night J>resi•dent Richn1ond was the vrincipal speaker a:t the dinner of the Upper Hudson River Sch'oolmasters' clu.b at the Ten Eyck in Albany. His address was on \The Bi- products of Education.\ On Saturday he spoke at the luncheon of tlre Classical club of the Upper Hudson at the New Kenmore in Albany. Sun- day he preached three times at the Madison Avenue PresbyteriaE church of Albany. Monday he went to Buffah where he spoke before the Ahtn1ni association at their banquet. On the twenty-ninth he will speak at the dinner of the local alun1ni. SAMUEL M. CAVERT, UNION 'og, TO BECOM~ MEMBER OF FACULTY. Satnuel M. Cavert, :Union 'oQ, will enter upon the duties as a n1e,1nber of the lJ nion college faculty at the begi:nning of the next collegiate year. He has been engaged as an· instructor in the classical depa..rtment. While an under- graduate Mr. Cavert established an enviable re- cord as an earnest s:tudent and an energetic parti- cipator in many coil ege activities. He is a lnen1- ber of Kappa Alpha fraternity and Phi Beta Kappa society. During his four years at college he was actively eH gaged in oratorical contests and debating. He was a member of the Con- cord.iensis board for three years and in his senior year was president of his class, of the Terrace Council, of the studentbody and of the Christian Association. During the past year l\1r. Ca vert has been general secretary of the Christian As- sociation. FOUR MORE ISSUES. Owing to the fact that the n1anagetnent provides but fotlr n1ore issues of the Con- cordiensis for the remainder of the year, the future nutnbers vvill necessarily appear at infrequent intervals, in order to span the space frotn now an til con1n1encement week.

10 ALBANY HEARS MUSICAL CLUB, SCH'DY CONCERT TO BE MAY ~- Fri€l_ay night the Musical club gave a concert in Albany at Centennial HaH, which proved most st.ccessful in every way. Both the Glee and Im- ::- ~r~c1n:ental ,clubs vvorked hard during the past MANAGER FINK week in pr,eparation, and the enthusiasm show1n by the large audience e1nphasized the fact that the c~ubs gave a concert worthy of their past reputation. On May rst the association gives its annual horne concert in the First Methodist church .. This concert will conclude the season which has been the most prosperous in years. Much of this GLEE CLUB LEADER MILLER success 1s due to the fact that a large proportion of those on the clubs were old and experienced 1nen. The clubs have been ably managed by Fink, who has run the organizations on a good financial basis owing to the clever arrangement of his trips. Ratto, 'r r; Camp bell, '12, and Harris, 13, were delegates at the annual convention of the Delta Phi fraternity, which was held in New York, Thursday, Friday and Saturday of last week. GYMNASIUM PLANS COMPLETED. Plans hav·e been completed for the new gymRa- t;;. mn by George B. Post & Sons, of New York, who built the new buildings of the college of the city of New York, including the gymnasium. The plans call for a large central building with . two wings. The central building according to estimates will cost in the neighborhood of sixty thousand doHars. Up to tlile present time the total promised or subscribed is about forty thou- sand. President Ricmmond intends, after receiving the definite plans and building estimates from contractors to put the whoJJe matter before the trustees in order to discuss the rais.ing of further funds. PHI ALPHA BANQUETS. The eighth annual dinner of the Phi Alpha fraternity was held at the Mohawk Baths hotel last Wednesday night. Before the dinner the fol- lowin·g were initiated: Van Rensselaer Tremper, 1 I3; Stanley Walworth, 'I4; Thomas Leland En- nis, '14; Sidney :C ej onge, 'r4; J, T. Gidley, '14; R. H. Vaughn, '14; C. B. :Elmore, '14, and D. P. Anderson, '14. The dinner was one of the best at tended that the society has ever held. D. V. Garnsey acted as toastmaster, and called upon th~ following: Otto Faust, B. R. Butler, Van Rensselaer 'fren~per and C. B. Elmore. The menus were in brown .leather with scarlet lining, having the symbols of the society em- bossed m gold on the cover. FIRST SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE IN HISTORY OF UNION ATHLETICS.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. II --- ~~================~==~==~=====~==================~========= BASKE''rBALL OF Y'ORE. {Contributed.) The banal saying, \There's nothing new under the sun,\ like so-me of our favored superstitions, receives at time confirmatory force from circum- stances tending to strengthen the belief of those who wish to believe. That· the game of basket- ball was played centuries before Columbus land- ed on America's coast, and eons before Cortez visited the coast of Yucatan, seetns to be estab- lished by some recent discoveries. Some few years ago, a large exploring and archaelogical party, while excavating in Yucatan, uncovered the site of the ancient JYfaya,. city of Chichen-Itza. In the centre of the ruined city there stood-yet stands-a vast temple of stone, of an architectural type indicating that centuries ago there had lived, prospered and died, a people of cultivation in art, architecture and allied ac- quirements. When in 1519 Cortez landed on the coast of Yucatan, he found but a ghostly remainder of the once vast multitud-e that had peopled the Maya districts. Whether it was internecine wars, pestilence, or other ills of n1agnitucle that re- duced the once great people to a tnere band of deteriorated survivors, will ren1ain forever un- known. The ten1ple referred to was built upon an eminence high above the surrounding city, and stood ;8 feet above ground and is I/5 feet in length. l t is in a fair state of preservation considering its extretne age, and has tnagni ficent courts, al- coves, rootns and altar places, with massive stair- ways and elaborately decorated panels. Next to, and near this ternple are ruins of a group of structures known (now) as the ''Ball Court.\ These ruins are described by Mr. Sylvanus G. Morley in a recent article, thus: \This group is cotnposed of two parallei n1asses of solid masonry, each 272 feet long 1 27 feet high and 16 feet wicle, placed I 19 feet apart. These two great walls forn1: a ·col..Ht 300 feet long by . ' . 119 feet wide. \High on the side of each, at the n1iddle point frotn end to end, there is attached a stone ring four feet in diameter, the center open for eleven inches. These rings are fastened to their respec- tive walls by tenons of stone and are placed so that the surface of each is perpendicular to the vertical face of the wall. The arrangement is very sin1ilar to the baskets in our n1odern game of basketbal1, except that the ancient 'baskets' have theii· openings perpendicular to the ground. To n1ake a b-asket, it is evident that the throw was 1nade horizontally as in baseball pitching.\ Of course rio recorcl. or sign of the manner of playing ren1.ains,. but that the ball was not hard is evidenced :by the fact that the rings on the inner side .are sn1ooth from frequent contact with the ball, and the onter surfaces are in no wtse datnaged, chipped or broken. If the \Press Club'' of those ear'ly days sent the results to the ''Daily Brick\ or \\Veekly Papyrus\ those accounts are lost in the clinu1ess of intervening years. SITE FOR GYMNASIUM CHOSEN AND ACCOMMOD·ATIONS FOR CHAPEL. According to the :latest announcement in re- gard to carnpus plans is that the new gymnasium will be placed at the eastern (Lenox Road) end of the coHeg-e oval. The original plan was to have the bui:l ding in the pasture and to have the athletic field in front of the terrace wall. The athletic field, includiag football fields and base- ball diamonds will be constructed in the lot bounded by Lenox Road and Lovers' Lane. The new p1ans also call for an enlargement of the central ~ection of Washburn Hall, which will be used as a chapel. This building was formerly used at the c::ollege library.

12 THE CONCORDIE~SIS. THE AUDITORIUM AT NORTHFIELD NORTHFIELD CONFERENCE PLANS FOR SUMMER NOW UNDER WAY. K. E. Walser, Chairman of Committee, Will Fur- nish Details of Trip. To you who will soon be 1naking plans for the cotning sun1n1er vacation, the Concordiensis would suggest the N orthfi.eld Student Confer- ence, June 23 to July 2, as a place for passing ten days of healthy, dean and thoroughly enjoy- able life. Northfield, to those who have been there, stands pre-etninent atnong sutntner vaca- tion resorts. Fro111 a scenic viewpoint it is an ideal place, situated as it is an1ong the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts, overlooking thf beautiful Coh-- necticut valley. There gather here every year, from seven hundred to one thousand ·men fron1 the universities and colleges of New England and the J\1iddle Atlantic States. It is a fact worthy of note that these n1en are representative. One ~--...,..-----------·--------, r···--- ~-- I EAST HALL, NORTHFIELD finds for exatnple athletes like Tad Jones, of Yale, as well as men who are noted for scholarship or literary ability. The conference is, of course,. a place where the spirit and ideals of Christianity .are pron1in- ently in the foreground. But it is not the over- zealous, fanatical kind of Christianity; but rather the sane, healthy, nonnal type. Amorfg the speakers this year w·ill be Robert E. Speer, whon1 tnany of the Concordiensis readers will remen1- ber, and John R. Mott, the tnan who has been called one of the greatest leaders in Christian work to-day. In addit~ion to these adclresses by the leading n1en of the day, there are dasses in Bible Study and in lVIission Study as well· as discussions on vocational pursuits. These classes are entirely informal and discussional. Each afternoon is given up to recreation and sports. A baseball league and tennis tournament furnish plenty of interest and excitetnent. The larger colieges usually have fast tean1s entered and there is always a keen rivalry for first place. Then there . is the big celebration and bon-fire, when the various delegations vie with. one an- other in inventing fantastic costumes and getting up original stunts. Nor tnust we fail to mention the Field Day with its obstacle race and tneet between hastily in1provised track teatns. Taken altogether Northfield is well worth con- sidering for the n1an who wants a live ten days~ outing at a nominal cost. Anyone interested may get further particulars fron1 I(. E.
