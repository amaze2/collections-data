\ I The Concordiensis VOL. 36. JUNE 13, 1913 No. 27 UNION SHUTS OUT H,AMILTON In Errorless and Consistent Game, Garnet Nine Out-play th~ Buff and Blue. Union evened things vvith Han1i1ton on May 31st. when our baseball nine white washed the visitors to the tune of S-0. Both teams played fast baseball but Hun1mer was pitch- ing in wonderful form and struck out thirteen of the twenty-eight Ha1nilton batters who faced hi1n. Hamilton never sa-vv third base. Our infield played air-tight baseball and never gave Hamilton a chance. Hummer stopped what looked like a possible rally in the last of the game, by a difficult double play to Giddings. This killed Hatniltons only chance to score. Royce, Hamil tons' pitcher had eight strike outs against thirteen by Hummer and Hamilton secured two hits to lJnion's five. The Garnet team's ability to hit the ball -vvas largely responsible for the victory, coupled \vith Hun1mer' s splendid pitching. lJnion scored two runs in the first inning, one in the third and the last two in the seventh. Every man on the tEtam played good steady base ball and V\ 7 hi1e little spectacular work was done, every position was played as it should be played. Hamilton was fast in the field, pull- ing down \Vh~t 1ooked like perfectly good hits at times, but their inability to hit handicapped them greatly. The score: D. Beaver, c. J, BeavPr, 1£. Nauman, ss.

UNION 4, RUTGERS 3 * Garnet Nine Takes Revenge in Fast Game Union defeated Rutgers by a 4-3 score in a \velfplayed game on thecan1pus Memorial Day. The n1en were detern1ined to repay the visitors for a defeat earlier in the season and this they did. Gilbert's stealing home in the ninth, \vith the score tied, two men out and two strikes on the batter, \vas the feature of the game. The game \vas scoreless till the fonrth inning when Rutgers scored twice. Uni( n follovved in the sixth ·with a lone tally. In the eighth, Rutgers ·again scored but Union in her half connected \vith the sphere and tied the score. Then in the ninth Jenkins Wc1lk- ed, and Gilbert ·was chosen to run for him. Gilbert stole second, was advanced to third by D. Beaver and after Nauman had accum- ulated two strikes, stole home and won the game. The men played a consistent game a11 through the nine innings. rrhe infield \VaS in fine forn1 and supported Jenkins in wonder- ful style. G·iddino·s ao·ain on second 1nacle b ' b . ' a big difference in the teams, his experienced playing being an as~et to the team. ] enkins sho\ved his usual speed' the balls fairly smok- ing when they sizzled over the plate. ] ennings the Rutgers pitcher was on his toes all the time, striking out thirteen men and allowing six hits. It is difficult to give any one man credit in the game for the men got together like a machine and played like veterans. Coach Dawson's predictions that we had material for a fast nine began to sho\v in the gatne. He has developed a tean1 out of practically all green material and what success the team has had, is largely a result of his careful and vvatchful coaching. The score: D. Beaver, c J. Beaver, lf.

Jenkins, p. 1 1 2 0 0 Jenkins, who was on the mound for Union, performed very credibly, and should have g-ained the victory with proper support in the field. Giddings played an exce11ent g·ame for Union, both at bat and in the field. In the opening session, Jenkins walked t\VO men, and a combination of errors enabled Fordhan1 to tally three runs. Giddings open- ed at bat for Union and lined out a clean single. He \vas sacrificed to second and around to third by Hutchens and Nauman, respectively. Barclay \came acros,s'' with a Justly double to Jight field, and Giddings scored. This ended the scoring however, for !iutchens \vas out at the plate and Woods fanned. U nton was retired in one, t\vo, three order in the second inning, but in the third, \Vith three men on bases, Woods \vas out on an in- field fly, and Union's real opportunity of the gatne was l~st. In the fifth, Jenkins, ag·ain passed two men, and Fordham was presented with another run by Union's blunders in the field. In the lucky seventh, the Garnet men started a little rally which netted another run. Jenkins opened V\rit b a clean two- bagger, and scored on Nauman's single.

Two of the five victories have been scored over the hardest tean1S on the schedule, rfufts and West Point. The Cadets, in particular, have lost but two games out of a long schedule and one of these defeats was due to \lTnion. Next season only Hutchens and Giddings will be missing from the varsity and De\vey from the second string, If the incon1 ing . class rnakes any sort of a showing, Union is due for a chan1pionship team next spring.

COMMENCEMENT With the granting of the degrees to the graduatlng class at tlle cotnmencernent exerc-ises \Vednesday morning, the one hun- dred seventeenth Com1nencement of U11ion was bro11g-ht to a close. Sixty-three lnen H~­ ceived their deg-rees, one of the larg-est classes to graduate in the hi.story of the co1- 1eg·e. Our hearts are filled \vith the mingled. feel-ings of reg-ret and satisfaction. Satis- faction because our friends in the c1ass of 1913 nave completed their co11ege course and are now prepared to enter the struggle of lifE' and regret because old friends 1nust part, close acquaintance must be destroyed ancl because \ve m11st bid farewell to the Senior class, a class which has done so much for ()ld Union. Commencement Week is al·ways a time of reminiscences \vhen \Ve hear the a1un1ni of ten, tv,renty or thirty years stand-ing tell of their college days and describe the college life ancl11ranks of the old days, at such times we can but think how many changes have occurred both in the outside world and in the college since the first class \vas graduated. lVIen have come and gone, wars have been fought and \VOn and the nation has gro·wn to be the acknowledged leader in the \vor1d's progress while old Union has gone steadily on with her accepted task-to train n1en to be good citizens and to be successful in their chosen \Va1ks of hfe. Ho\v \ve11 she has succeeded \Yill be shown by a perusal of tbe lengthy list of Union graduates \Yho have attained high honors both in public service and in private 1ife. And such men are stil1 being sent forth from these\ Grey OJd Halls'' to bring ne\v~ honors to the A1n1a Mater. How many men in their c1ass of 1913 or among those sti11 in our 1n idst vvi11 sotne- day reach positions of po\ver and high in the country ? How many men who1n we 1ningle every day ·will day bring high honor to old Union by honor \~it h ll SOUle their success in life. It is the training- of these collegE} days \vhich is e 111iping then1 for their labors. It is the spirit of fairness, the spirit of den1ocracy and the fair n1indecl attitude in viewing matters ·which is part of the at- mosphere at Union, which becon1es in1bedded in their 1ninds and aids them so rnuch in the world. Onr college years are mere years of pt·eparation. It is not so much what \Ve le: --vv. lS hE tb p1 la tr a1 Cc n h \\ 1] l1 c a s t l t t l ] 1

Only those 111en \vho haye \Yorkccl so hard for the llC\Y builc1- ing- anc1 those clnsscs \vho have been in co1leg·c since the o1c1 building has been so useless can n:alize the acute need of tl1e co11ep:e for a real gyn1nasinn1.

Dr. Richn1ond's final charge to the 111en1bers of the senior class is as follo\:vs : 1 'Gent1e1nen of the graduating L-1ass; this is a mo1ncnt of no common si,g·nificance to you and to us all. You have finished the course, you have kept the faith. The course has, no don bt, seen1ed to you severe enong·h, although your humane teachers l1ave ofte-n, unperceived by you,. tempered the \vind to the shorn lamb. At a11 events. your discipline has been vi,g·orous enou,g·h to test the vigor of your minds and the sincerity of your purpose. 1 'And now there lies before you, not success, for no n1an can comn1and success, and, in the large sense, no 1nan ever :wins success; btlt before you lies opportunity, above all, oppor- tunity of choice. If ·we have been ahle to do anything for you it has been to show yon the di ffcrence bet\vcen the second .best and the best. \Ve have tried to set your faces in the right direction. and you vdll find that this is about all one man can do for another. No lllan can be hands' a no brains' and heart r or another tnan; each of us 1nust n1ake his journey on his O\vn feet. But let n1e urge upon you at this itnpressive n1otnent, as a n1an speak- ing to his friends, an older to a young·er 111an, keep the straight path, follo\v the star. If riches increase, set not your heart to seek upon then1; if po\ver becon1es yours, harden not your heart to seek n1ore pO\\Ter, for this is the \VCl.Y of men. The best gifts are love g-et her at least one beautifn11esso-n, vd1atl ver \Ve have failed to learn, vve have 1earned to 1oYl' lT nion CoHege.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 15 CLASS DAY EXERCISES The throngs gathered around the N ott Elln Monday afternoon witnessed an inova- tion when President Richmond, who entered four years ago \Yith 1913, was elected an honorary men1 ber of the class. Some also thought iL an inovation ·when he relieved Joe Mohair of a part of the contents of his JUg. But the other events went off reguarly enough -vvith intennis:sions of music. Grand Marshall Mayham introduced Presi- dent Th1ale as n1aster of ceremonies. In his ·welcon1ing words ''Charlie'' explained that 1913 has become famo11s despite 13, 23, and Friday hoodoos, fo1lo,ved the class. vvhich have persistently Giles Clark, class histo- rian, recounted the famous deeds to which the president alluded. Class Orator Hanigan then re-echoed t11e cry of the great world around us ''God give us men; men -vvhom tl;e Just of office cannot buy, men of honor, men who \i\ri11 not 1ie. The pipe had 1nean\vhile been lit, and this token of peace as \Veil as the jug \vas circula- ting freely \vhen Don Hutchens delivered the ivy ovation. His fina1 appeal was: '' As the ivy \vhich \Ye plant spreads its roots anc1 leaves, let · the n1ernl:ers of this class s~:attcT in various raths, conscious that the true loya11 y to Union 1ies in striving to f(a- lize the high purposes of her ic1ea1s.'' Harold 1-I. Dickinson then delivered the class poem -vvhich appears in another part of this issue. Since Thon1as M8rsba11 could not be present to deLveT the pipe oration, '·Bob'' La Barron finish eel the spenking· vvi th the class prophecy.

Dearest Hope of Union Men at Last Reali2ed At four o'clock Monday afternoon a great throng congregated on the coUeg e oval to \Vitness the laying of the cornerstone, and the formal presentation of the ne'v $100,000 gy1nnasium. The croYnl; cotnprised of old an11nni \vith their fami1ies, younger graduates undergraduafes, and in fact everyone interest- ed in the prosperity of lTnion, manifested great enthusiasm over this tnost auspicous event. Before this very anin1ated body, Dr. Frank Bailey, Treasurer of the College, conducted· the ceremonies of the occasion. He opened the exercises \Vith a short speech on the pre- sentation of the gymnasum. He also made several observations as to the purposes and utility of the building, and closed \Vith the prophecy that \vithin a decade the equipment of the gymnastnn would be inadequate for the College, according to the present rate of . tncrea e. Henry Le\vis, president of the class of 1909 \vhich started the 'gyn1' movement, \vas next introduced. He gave a history of the origin of the n1ovement, \:dth the resulting cam- paigns and eager responses by alumni and students.

The president spoke vvith his usual eloquence and aroused an intense spirit throughout the assen1blage. l-Ie said, \It is not the classes, not the president ancl not the trustees, \vho are building this gy1nnasiun1, bnt \Ve are all buiJding it, and therefore \Ve are all rejoicing.'' He predicted tl-:1e nun1.erous acl vantages of the gym and explained its various utilitarian and ornamenta1 features.

The Garnet is bound in soft green leather -vvitb the \VOrds '' Garnet \ and ' ' 1914 '' intertwined on the front cover. The usual depart1nents are present together with many original drawings and cuts of the Campus. The ·,general appearance of the book is very creditab1e and the editors are to be congratulated upon their successful efforts. They declared their intentions to get out a book which would be a true year-book, con- taining all the records of college activities for the past year. How well they have succeed .. ed can be decided by a brief perusal of the pages. The Junior Picture Department is particularly good and the write-ups are not the ordinary kind but are novel and original. The paper is of better quality than last year and takes the cuts better. Taken all in all, the class of 1914 should be congratulated on . ''G \ 1ts · arnet. --:0:-- D. K. HUTCHENS Winner of Daggett Prize ---:0:-- NEW ECONOMICS PROFESSOR Dr. Robert Tudor Hi11, Ph.

22 THE CONCORDIENSIS ALUMNI NIGHT \YOtdd be caug11t up in a \Yhir1, \vhich S\Yayed round and ro11nd the circle. The shouts and At six o'clock a croV\~d began to congregate upon the ca1npus, ·w·hich eclipsed by far, any assetnblage that ever before throng-ed the ~-rounds. An unbroken line of auton1ob1les con1pleted the circle fro1n the east to the \Yest bleachers, and entirely encon1passed the base ball dic-unond. Bounded bv this mass of aln1ost ten thousand persons, the alu1nni and undergraduates, went through their im- prolnpttu program of all conceivable orders of antics. The campus was a '' blaze of light '' every effort having been made to change night into day. Searchlights fro1n the ba1conies of the l..;ibrary cast their beams upon the revelers. The Payne gate and the Library Lane were brillantly illun1inq,ted. North and South Colonnades, the Library and other bui1dings ·were clothed \Vi th incadescent lig-hts, and glittering arc lamps gleamed an about the campus; \vhi1e large bonfires added their glee to the animation of the evening, There were no order of events or progr a1n as everything else which restricted the men in any possible mode of celebration. Alumni forgot the1r age and were ''stu des '' aga1n President Richn1ond \vc11 explained their actions \vhen he said '' Alutnni are 111ore rcspectflble on Con1n1encen1ent Day.'' The different classes tried to hang togeth- er as much as possibJe and perforn1 her stunts separately. rrhere \VCfe numeroUS inter-class calls a~d song·s. and the old \Hika\ yell from the co1nbined voices of all. The class of '81 brought forth its May Pole, and to the blaring music of the brass bands these old alumni of forty years or more, danced about the pole with the viva- city of school children. The class of 1910; in their grotesque clown attire, went through all sorts of freak performances. But of a sudden, panden1oniu1n would reign and no one class could maintain the field alone for any length of time. U nexpect- edly there would be a swarm a rush, and a old alumni and young under graduates yells were ear-piercing-, and the noise could be heard fro1n afar. The unclergradn ates not to be out don:e by their older colleagues also executed a variety of antics. The coBege wagons \vere brought upon the field of action, and chariot races \Verc run, \Vh ile the :excited bystanders cheered thcn1 on. Another class npl1elcl its reputation and in- troduced a n11mber of the gyn1 \\'heel- barro\vs in a series of relay races around the course. ()ne class, Tis king a sentence of twenty years imprisonn1ent borrowed(?) son1e of the busts and statues from the college build- ings and decorated the ca1npus with them. The police on hand were simply tortured to death, and the climax came when t11e men of '08 garbed as convicts carried the officers fro1n the field. It was iate in the evening before the cel- ebration began to waned even in the slig·ht- est, but finally the men assembled in the forn1 of a large U, and reverently doffing their caps, sang, \Vith a11 due ceremony the three verses of our \ Alma Mater.

The Ven- dome Hotel was the place and Saturday evening the time. The Senior class \vas there in force. and a most enjoyable banquet \vas served. Professor John L. Bennett '90 acted as toastmaster and during the F con rse of the evening called on several Seniors to speak. They were: Don K. Hutchens, Philip N. Riedinger, Hartley G. Dewey, Charles T. MaTe, David R. Finley and Joseph Mohair. After the banquet a business meeting of the class was held at which it was definitely decided to present to the College as a clabs memorial several section of fence, simalar to that by the Blue Gate, along the ate1etic field. This will fo11o\v the action of 1912 in giving this servicable forn1 of n1e1norial to the College. It is hoped to eventually build this fence around the Campus where it borders the streets. The banquet was from every standpoint an unusual success in the point of numbers and of enthusiastn. The .committee who had charge should be congratulated. Steefel Bros.
