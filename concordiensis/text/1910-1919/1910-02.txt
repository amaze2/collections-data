In a game ·of basketball played at West P.oin:t last !Saturday afternoon Union met defeat at the !hands of tl:re Army five. The score was 43 and 23. The game was played before a large crowd of cadets .and officers, many of who~n were ac- companied by their frienJs of the fairer sex. Clean ,playing and excellent treatment character- ized the contest and trip in general. Union was 'handicapped in the game by the use of the inter-collegiate out-of-bound rule, to which they were unaccustomed, and unscreened baskets put our team at a further disadvantage. 'ln tlhe first half West Point ran a way from the 'Garnet ·five and piled up a score of 32 points against Union's 13. In the second half it was a different story. Our fellows were getting ac- customed to the court and rules and came back at West Point with the whirlwind finish, with which they played Rochester to a standstill in tte second half. The defeat by a heavy score in the first :half o ffereJ no dii3couragemen t to the Union five. Instead with all the spirit of a ·winning tean1, we kept after the Army team, hold- ing ti::te.n d·1wn Lo 11 points and ourselves scoring 10.

One of t.he . doings. of Junior Week will be the basketball gan1e -to be GAM E.. held on Saturday evening in the Armory. It will be witt: New York University anJ will be one of tlhe hardest of the ho~ne games. The game is to be ~ailed at 7:15 sharp, so as to give all an opportunity to attend and also have t~me to attend wiratever other functions that have been arra:nged for later in the evening. It is hoped that a large crowd will be present, for an exceUent game wHl be seen and ample Ume will be given to reach the thea[re or dance at the close of tlie .game . The matter of aholishing t'he use FLOWERS of flowers at all of the Junior Week festivities is not something originat~ ing here f.or it has been done at several otb.er institutions this yea.r on similar occasions. One of the principal colleges where flowers were not worn this year is Yale whose Junior Week has but recently ended. And now that the stu lent body at Union has de·cided to do away with fl·owers everyone who attends any of tJhe functions should not act contrary to the resolution, but should do as the majority will do. It ·iJ.as been r·un1ored that some say they will have ftower.s just the same. That is not exactly the way to do and everyone will be expected to live up to the resolution ado.pted by the students in regaru :o tlhis matter, as he should do. This year E1e Terrace Council BNOW8ALL thought it a wise step to regulate SCRAP. in some way the annual snowball s·crap. The plan that they thougfbt best was submitted to the students Monday in college meeting anJ no objections were raised so it seems rthat it is favored by the stud€nt body. Of course some have brought up object~ ions since then but now everyone sh-ould do his be·st to help carry out tbe schem·e as submitted. If every;one will do that it wi~l resu.l~ .successfully an·d will be mu·ch better tJhan the old system. ::

'i'HE CONOOI{DIENSIS TH:REE FORCEFUL COLLEGE SERMON'S. On Tuesday evening Dr. Potter spoke on \The ---- Deepest Problem in Life\-sin. ·H·e spoke from D·r. Potter's Stirrin·g Message to Uni·on M·en.. the text \·God made Him to be sin, who knew no sin,'' explaining it as follows: The first half of last week was one that will \A 1over always idenUfies himself with the be remembered by many Union m·en beeau.se of object of his love. For example a man's love the three wonderf.ul sermons that were preached for his college is measured by the degree in. which by Dr. Rockwell Harn1on, Potter, Union, '95, in\ he loses sight of self in .b_is love for the collage the .college chapel. and ,puts 1l.imself in the place of the college. So T'11ese meetings were obviously stuJent nleet- ings in every way from beginning to end. The meeting M1onday evening was opened by Cavert, '10, president of the Y. M. C. A., who ask- ed D·ean Ri:pton to introduce the speaker. This the Dean ·did in his delightful and pleasant way. After speak~ng of the pleas.ure of visiting his col- lege again, nr. Potter announced his first sub- ject, \The Highest Motive in Life.\ His theme was the story of the rich young ruler who wanted to follow Christ but wasn't willing to gi-ve up all that he had for the privilege. The gist of his talk is as follows: \The higheat motive in life is loyalty to Christ. If a man is going to be a true son to his 'illO.ther, there are some things that h·e must do and some things that he must 'cut out.' In the same way, lF a fellow would really follow Christ, there are s·ome tt .. ings that he must do and some things that he must refrain from doing. To have seen your duty and to turn your baek upon it, that is Hell. There never was anyth:ng worse and never can be.\ \What is it to follow Jesus? It is not to accept some theory about him; not to imitate hiln in appearance or habits. In the realm of the in- tellect, following Jesus is to love the truth; in the realm of the affe·ctions-to love things wortf:\t while; in the realm of 1'he heoart-to l·ov-e one ·woman purely and receive her love in return; in the realm of the will-to set yourself to do righteousness, even tho' the heavens s.hould fall. To follow Jesus is all that ! \ \All that a man has and all that a man is, must he given to the satisfaction o.f his i,le·al. But it i·s worth the price, if 'he nas that highest ideal -following 'Christ.\ God identified Himself with us, the object ·of His love, and .sympathizes with man in his sin. God juJges us not by what we do, for we often fail, but by what we set as our ideal, and really strive to do.\ 'Dr. Potter's last talk was on \Tr Greatest \Vork in Life.\ He spoke from the text, \Ye are the body of .Chriat.\ He depicted the busi- ness of a great corporation, and tll.en showed that the wor·d corporation comes froiD the Latin 'corp·us,' and so rendered his text \Ye are the corporation of Christ.\ The greatest work in life is •to work for the corporation of Christ. ·The business of this corporation is to do what ito fou11Jer did-go about doing good and teach- ing men about God. Dr. Potter made it clear tha·L he was not urging men to go into the min- istry. \Don't go into the ministry, unless you ran't keep out,\ was his advice. \T:he ministry is overcrowded with men of second rate ability r nd seeond rate spiritual life.\ He closed with n stirring appeal for college men to g-et in to the work of some church, where they c-an work for the corporation of Jesus in teachiNg men about GoJ. This is the first time that sucri a series of .meetings has ever been held at Union. The in- terest of the students was clearly manifest, the attendance being about one hunJred each even- ing.

10 TI-lE (jONCOltDIEN~lS ELl PH.A.LET NOTT, D. D. LL. D. Reminiscences. By Judge N. G. Giffin. One of the most unique and remarkable char- acters of the last century was Elipt.lalet Nott, for sixty-two years presi-dent of Union College, located at Schenectady, N. Y. It waB the writer's privilege to be a student at that institution as a n1ember of the class of 1859. Dr. ~ott was born in 17 73 at Ashford, Conn., and died in 1866 at the a Jvanced age of 93. He was a preacher of greal eloquence and power. Some one said of him be- fore his death, ''He is one of t:he ihistorical n1onuments of his country.\ He was not only a great preacher and a grc F t educator but a great financier and inventor. It is siated that the records of the Patent 0 'lice stow that thirty or more patents were is.susd to him for th·e a,v- vlication of heat to stea2n engines, ·che economical use of fuel and other 1natters. One of his great- est efforts was a sermon or oration on the dea~..h of Alexander Hamilton, who was killeJ in a duel with Aaron Burr. It is said that this oration made hin1 president of Union College. In it he attacked the practice of dueling with such rower that it produced a profound impn~ss'on through- cut the country and is thought to have bP.en one of the greatest f::tctors in bringing about legis- latio nto do a way with that custom. His long service as President of Union College cause! him to he frequently spoken of as the father of Co!- 1ege Presidents. He had whRt was considered 1·ecnliar methods for governing a college. Xo student was expelled from Union for a first of- fense. He frequently got two, three or n1ore trials and then ~nstead of expulEiion was some- tirnes quietly rusticated for a year. The pnnish- ment was kept secret from the other studPnts tmless the culprit hin1self revealeJ it. It is said of one of America's greatest statesmen, that dur- ing his college course at Union he was rust1c:tted for a year and ~pent the time teac 1 bing in the ·south. The ilnpression among h~s fellow students was that his absence was voluntary and tfiat he had taken a year's vacation to recuperate his funds. In after years he became one of Dr. ~ott'·s greatest favorites among the Alurnni. Dr. .:\fott seen1ed to 11ave a wonderful insight into or verha:ps we should say foresight of coming events. It was a great mystery an1ong the students :how he managed to Jiscover their plans and purposes. It was claimed by some that his wonderful knowledge of human nature enabled htm to select fron1 every new class such. students as he might be a.ble to make use of as secret agents and spies. Whether this vvas so or not he certa~nly had a wonderful faculty of dis.cov· ering things. To illustrate: A half Jozen stu- dents had put their b.eads together to pay a practical joke upon the Doctor and felt perfect· ly .sure t;hat their schen1e could not possibly leak cut as no one bttt those engaged in the affair l{new about it. ·The Doctor had a very fine closed carriage. The plan was, about midnight to take this carriage from the carriage-house, draw it to the edge of the woods on the campus, remove the wheels anJ other parts and hang then1 in the trees. Tlhey proceeded to carry out their plan and just as they arrived at the edge of the woods the Doctor opened the door and sa~d, \~ow youn.s- gentlemen, i1' you pleas(, you may draw me hack again,'' and bacl' theJ 1rew him, leaving the carriage as they had found it in the carriage-house. This was all the dis- cip:Jine whic:l1 they received for their conduct, but H served to answer the purpose. (To be ·continued.) COLLEGE MEETING.

He was public spirited, and supported every measure he deemed for t:he welfare of the com- munity in wh:ch he lived. Intensely interested in the public schools, he always advocated a.le- quate remuneration of tea~bers and those en- gaging in school work. !He was a ..sincere, ea~·nest worker in the church and his advice and counsel in all matters relating to poUty were sought after and followed.

Y., last July, Dr. Ste!lLnetz sJ)oke on this subject, and in Dr. Ash- more's article several quotations are given from this speech, one of which says, \It is my ·opinion that the neglect of the classics is one of the most serious mistakes in modern education, and n1ore so in the case of the engineer than in .:nost other professi-ons, for the reas-on that the avo-cation pf the engineer is especially liable to n1ake the man one-sided. The ..stu-dy of ~Greek and -Latin will broaden his horizon more than anything which •can be accomplished otherwise by s'h·owing him relative values more in their .proper proportion and less Jistorted by the trend or thought of his time.\ Although none of ihe other speakers agreed wit~1 Dr. Steinn1etz, he gave it as his opinion that

T·HE CoNCORDIENSIS No. 17 V:Q.L. XXXIII UNION COLL~EGE, FEBRUARY 9, 1910 ' New York UniV·ersity, 16; Union, 12. Before a large crowd, in which the fair sex: was well repres.ented, N. Y. U. defeated Un~on at ·i_he local Arm.ory by the score of sixteen to twelve, Saturday eve•11ing, ·February 5. The gan1e was the fastest and hardest fought thal the -Garnet five has put up this year. lVlucb of the apparent roughness was due to the fact tr~at both teams play€J the same style of game ; and, consequently, the guarding wa.s close, and. collisions frequent. The c!heering was not at all up to the :nark. So many fellows were :·n. the balcony and scat- tered .around, that the r·2mainder, seated upon. , the students' bleacllers, made a very poor show- inb. The game was called a!\ 7:15 sharp. During the preliminary practice it became evident that X. Y. U. woul\'l. have hard work in locating tbe l·aslu;·~s, and Unto11' s sl~ooUng was not ali th11t could be asked for. 1:\. Y. U. star led the scoring on a foul t'nrow ing a foul. T!hen the tide began to turn. Co-vv- arJ, while rece:vi·ng a long pass, was knocked oul, but resu1ned play shortly after. Gird.ansky shot two baskets in quick succession, and Broad .. nead got another .before being removed, L·ong- worth replacing hin1. With thirty seconds to play, He quem bourg was substituted for Coward. Each tE~an1 had just secured a point on fouls, when the whistle blew .. r~..,or Union, Fairbairn playe ..

This, however, was the sole purpose of Dr. Ashmore to strongly uphold Dr. Steinmetz' .:3 posi- t'on concerning the value of the classics for t!1e engineers. The dtrongest reason in favor of Greek and Latin is that they afford vam.ame training· or discipline to the student as t'hey are synthetic languages, and not, like the modern tongues, analytical. 'That is, in Greek and Latin, the relation of one word to another is i·ndj cated by its terrnination which generally changes in accorJance with the meaning, while in tile mod- ern languages the relatio•n of different words are shown by certain auxiliary or determining wordB.

'The c --.n1 ::nittees which were in charge of all :festivi t! es. the Soiree, the Prom, the Musi·cal Club ConC(Ol t anJ the .basketball game, deserve the heartiest ttiam.ks of the students, for the success or the week was due primarily to tii1eir efforts. \Ve feel certa~n that our gue~ts ha.d .as enjoyable a time as. we did and we .are glad that we have such a tim,e when we can entertain ·our friends and the friends of the College. But now that the· festivities are ·over let us remember that we lra.ve more serious m·atters be~ore us and let us vut our best efforts in the direction of our col- lege work for in that way we will appreciate more the pleasure~ of the :p:ast week.

During that time our te,ams have not been especiaily successful as winners ·of games but the interest in t!h·at sport has not been allowed to wane.

T:hat game -was certainly am excellent exhibition of basketball and shows hard and efficient work on the part of the eoach .and s.quad. We think that all the stu dents will agree when we say that we were ple:ase.i wit!h the game with IN. Y.

One of his latest effnrts is the alumni committee '\ which held its first meeting last Friday. T!his committee origi 1 nate.i under th.e guide of Dr. Richn1ond and th.e purpose .of it is '~o strengthen the bond among the alumni in such a way as to work for their good an·d for the good of the College. It will be ~ :neans of bringing the alumni more in touch witlh each other and in such a relation to the College .as will r:esult in material benefit for the institution. We are glad to see such a comm~ttee ·organized and apprec- iate tlie work of Dr. Ri-chmond in bringing it about. Another matter whioh Dr. Rich- STUD,ENT n1ond has been .considering seriously FUN D. is that of a \·Fund for the Aid of ~ eedy Students,'' It :s something tlie use of which 1 he readily saw and for. which he tl.as been working.

The talk was in general a :pJea for the best interests of the chilJ, and a word of caution against the 1nem.beDs on the rmnarkable progress of Union dangers of too extended and too intense a com- in the past few years.

THE CoNCORDIENSIS i' :' VOL. XXXIII UNION COLLEGE., FEBRUARY 16,1910 No. 18 B-ASKETBALL.. Hobart, 17; Union, 22. For the second time this season the 'V.arst~y basketball five .iefe.ated Hobart. ·The fi.rat gane, pl-ayed at the Armory on January the eighth, re- sulted in a victory for Union by tlhe score of twe·nty-five to sixteen; wfhile last Saturday H·obart again suffered defeat, at Geneva., by the score of -seventeen to twenty-two. The team left for Geneva Saturday morning. Those wll1o made the trip were Capt. Charest, Cowa.rd, Anderson, Hequem bourg, F'airbai rn, Smith and Mana.ger Zimmer. As has been the ha.bit of the tea::n this ypar, Union played rather slowly at ·first, but took a gGod braee in the se,Bon.i lh:alf. Througb.out the first half, the ,~·core' was very close, until the end approac;hed, when Hobart took the lead. F'or Union, He-quembourg and Anderson each m.ade a ba:sket, and these scores, togetter with four fouls, gave Union eight point;:;, Robart secured eleven on baskets by Barm·ore, Falmer, and Paton (·2) and fouls slhot by Hancock and Barmore. Uni·on started off well in the seconl half, and. soon tied the score. About the middle of the half, Hobart took the lead; but the Garnet five made three baskets in rapid successjon. The~e ended the scoring. Thenceforth, the Union team contente.d tt.emselves wit!h· guarding Hobart's basket, and Hobart ·could not bring the ball be· yon1 the ·center of the court. This ha.lf resulted in Union's favor, fourteen to six, making t!he final score twenty-two to seventeen. Ahout the mid·dle of tJhe second half, Ra.nd was substituted for Paton. Union :nade no substi· tutions, keeping the same line1rp in the whole game. The score follows: :HO'BART. U·NION. left forwaL-d. E-se'hman . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Only som·e diabolical form of amuse:fle Jt C.:!.J. now keep the· 'Varsf.ty ba.sketball playe-rs· from going stale, as ·tJhe new trainer, Emil Klein, is at work, and his efforts are already putting new en- ergy into the men. This is espe~ially noticeable when the apparent physical condition of the men during the Golgate and Bo·ston \Te~h\ games is compared. Kllein, with a we::tlth of experie·J.ce back of him, is about as good a trainer as c::m:d be furnished the men. For two seasons ·he has trained the East Higlh School f·ootball men with m.arked suc- cess. The· advent o.f Klein will compensate, in a m.easure, for the los.s ··of Coach Powell. Tbe ex2e1- lent condition o.f the men this week is due l::lrgely to Klein's work, and his presence for the remainder of the season cannot hel!) having a beneficial effect-Rochester Oamvus~ February 10, 1910. G·R·ADUATE C01ACH SYSTEM. For some time pas 1 t :son1e of the Ahnnni have felt .that the football tea.m has not received all th·e support that the Alumni should tender it. \Bill\ Smith, of New York, and several other of our New York Alumni have been agitating !the ques- ti-on of a graduate coach system for Union. Such a course would undoubtedly prove most advan- tageous to the- college and the team. However, as yet nothing definite has been -done. FOOTB·ALL ·C.APtAI~N·S FOR 1910.

THE OONOORDIENSIS 7 R0 1 CH EST·E·R LOOS·ES B·AS·KETBA!L.L COACH. · 'There W·as ld·ee·p--fel.t grief in the has~etl\\ball quarters last Saturday night w'hen, to ad.d to the disapp~o.in,tment or\ the Colga.te defeat, Arthur Po.wen, -whose efficient coaching ana conscientious efforts have been in .suCih a· large :measu-re res·pon- sible for the team's wonderful record, announced 'h.·is intention of -dep:a.rting for the West to recuper .. ate his )lealth. Though unknown to most of the students, Powell .has be·en far from well for some m·onths, but .so- wra.p:ped up has he be-en in the interests of the team that 1he kel)t his illness a secret. Only ·those who have carefully followed the pro.gre-ss of the team·'·s work this year can realiz·e to the tu.ll eX'ten;t what the loss o.f Powell ·means. His system of co.acbing is a perfect one; his w-ay of handling the· ·m-en 'has bee·fl instrumental in inciting them on to ·their best efforts. For the rest of the s·eas-on Captain Harman will take the squad in hand and i.t is expected that, with the n1ethods t:hat Powell has t::tu'5ht, the· rest of the sc'hedule will be taken care of.-Rochester Campus, February 3, 1910. TRUE .COLLEG·E SPORTSMANSHIP. Last Saturday Syracuse ran a r•elay race with Columbia at Boston. In the last lap the two men on the Syracuse team failed to- m·ake the relay ·and as a result the ra.ce went to ·Ce>lumbia officially, although Syracuse, led by a.bout twenty yards at the finish. The Colum,bia runners, ·however, re- fused to accept the prizes, ·as they considered them~selves fairly beaten.

Perhaps to outsiders the club appears to be in son1ewhat of a dormant state. However, sucih is not the case. M,embers of the club are working and planning new way.s of helping old Union anl bringing it to the notice .,of the country. The Board of Trustees, after much e-ffort on Prexy's part, has finally evidenced some interest in the club, and the prospects of this infant organiza;tion are of the brightest. A constitution will very shortly be adopted; in fact, one has alre,ady been drawn up. When tJhe club moves into its n·ew quarters next term. everything s-hould be in the best running order. Every n1em·ber sh·ould make an effort to attend meetings of the club from now on, as several very im·portant ques·tions are to be decide-d upon in the cou~se of the next few months. The presi·d·ent of Monmouth C-ollege ha;s orler- ed the· abo.Ushment of the fraternities there·, :be· cause they violate·d some college statutes.

We think that such a system would re- sult in ve·ry material benefit to the team. It would bring in the assistance of more than one man and for that reason the team would be helped greatly for thus mO:re time could be given to the se-parate team as they are diviled on the gridiron. The plan has been succes·sfully adopted by many large eoi.le.gea and there is no reason why it could not be m.ade to succeed at Union. Tr.~.-e·re are ma.ny men among the alumni who would be capable of giving valuable a~d and many who are willing to lo so.

rrHE OONC·ORDIENSIS 1~ .DR. CAD·Y'S ·LE.CTURE. ·Colilege ~Chapel, Friday, Feb. 11, 1910~ T'11oe first of Dr .. Cady's serie:S of three lecture.s was given in the Chapel last Friday afternoon at 4:30. :rhe subje1ct ,(>.:fthe talk was ''T~e River Nile and the opening of the Soudan.\ The lecture was very int!3resting· and gave to the audience many new ideas about that region of the old world. Dr. Cady used many lantern slides as illustrative of the -subject, ho·tll1 of the land and the people. He said, in part.: \Much has been attempted to f?.:::t d out the con-dHlon.s which .govern the rise and fall of the Nile., but not much has been accom- plished. Very li-ttle was known of this great river until ten or fifteen years ·ago, and there are stiil some questi.ons to be se·ttled. The rise and fall of th·e Nile are affe·Qted by the south west mon- s,oons which govern the rainfall of that region. Fifty years· after Christ it was rep.orted that a man had found tbe source of .the Nile, and said it was in twin lakes, surrounded by snow-capped n1ountains.\ Dr. ca.dy sai-d tha·t ·such was :proba- bly not the case, but that such a tradition ~has been C'Qfi.\lm .. on for m·any centuries·. He ·said that in 177 2 an explorer fo-und the source of the Blue :~il e but that not much more was kn·o·wn until ' 1858; the source of the White Nile had not been reached, nor the great lakes, although many lives •h.ad been lost in the· attempt. Dr. Cady said: \In 1859, Burton and Speak, starting out from the east shore of Afric::t, dis- covered Lake Victoria, and in 1875 this was cor- roborated by Stanley as the source of the \rV'hite Nile. Then, May 24, 1888, Stanley discove·red th·e real source of the Nile to be south of Lake Vic- toria. The river is 4,0·00 miles in length and the ·dis.tance from the source t·o its mouth by a straight cnurse is 2,95() m.il~~s.\ H'e spoke of (how the natives of EgyiJt used to w-orship the Nile and called it their god, because they did not know of its origin an·d c-ould nnt e:xp-lain its phenom·ena. He said, \The river is not very beautiful itself, but in the evenihg, when the ·st-ars are shining, it posses·ses an indescribable charm.\ He further gave som·e description of the country o·f the Soudan and sho·wed slides of the mud 1 huts and als·o o.f th.e ·people, many of which are over six feet in he1ght. He stated that there is not much religion among those people, but that they are friendly :to :EJ,urc>Jleans a.nd .~re open to Chris- tianity. .H~ ~also gave· short mention of tlhe W·ork bein,g carried on t.here by the Bri·~ish governmen!, which owns and controls the Soudan. The sec'()·nd lecture by .D:r. C-ady will be given il). . . the Chapel on F'ri,day of this week. The general topic will b-e, \Physical and Archaeological Fea- tures of Northern Galilee and .Syri.a.\ He will use about seve-nty-five slides, whie1h will be very inter- esting to a.ll. A C.OMtM U N-lC:A TION. New York, December 20, 1909. Editor Gonc()rdiensis, Sell ene·ctady, N. Y. Dear Sir-In your issue of December 15th you quote an interesting article fro.m \The Intercolleg- ian\ on th.e \Growt1h of Fra·ternities.\ In the· course -of this runs this sentence, \The original Uni-on triad, so-called, began as senior societies, bilt quiclt1y extend·e·d their privileges to the Jower classmen.~' .So far as Sigma Phi is concerned, this is an err()r. Of the four founders of the society, two were seniors, one was a junior and one a sophom·ore; and of the twenty initiated before Oom·menceme-nt in 1827 (the year in which the society was founded), ten were seniors, six were juniors an.d four were sophomores. Sigma Phi, therefore, extended its privilege·s to lower class- n1en fro:m the very start. Very truly yours, Alexander Duane.
