A Gateway-Electrical O NLY a forty-foot gateway bounded by two brick pUasters and ornamental lamps, but unlike any other gateway in the entire world. For back of it is the General Electric Com· pany's main office building, accommodating 2300 employees. And just next door is its laboratory with the best equipment for test- ing, standardizing and research at the com- mand of capable engineers. Then down the street-a mile long-are other buildings where everything electrical, from the small- est lamp socket t() the huge turbines for electrically propelled battleships, is made by the 20,000 electrical wor~ers who daily stream through. What a story this gate would tell, it it could, of the leaders of the electrical industry and business, of ambassadors from other insti- tutions and from foreign lands. The story would be the history of electric lighting, electric transportation, electric in- dustrials and electricity in the home. This gateway, as well as the research, en- gineering, manufacturing and commercial resources back of it, is open to all who are working for the betterment of the electrical industry.
