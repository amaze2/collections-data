This action resulted from the :fact that both Bunyan ex-'19, and Baird ex-'19 have entered the army so that no Juniors were on the business board of the paper from v.rhom a business manager for next year could be picked. Hartman tried out for as- sistant manager last year and Dou- gall has been hitherto an Associate Editor. McGarty, '19, manager o:f The Garnet, at this ~eeting ;presented the bids which he has received for printing and binding the Garnet, and by a vote of the :Board ratifying his recommendations, the contract was awarded to the Eagle Publishing Co., of Pittsfield, Mass. Four amendments to the by- laws of the Board were adopted and will be submitted to the student body for approval at the next student meeting. These amend:rnents concern the custody and disposition of the funds of THE CONCORDIENSIS and Garnet. It is provided that the profits of THE CONCORDlENSIS, if any, shall be divided between the business manager, the editor-in-chief and the Publication :Board, the. man- ag-er and editor each to receive forty per cent., and the Board the remain- ing twenty per cent. The other amendments are intended to co-ordinate thE treasury depart- ments of the Garnet and THE CON- CORDIENSIS.

The schedule of the inter-class basketball games has not been ar-. ranged .as yet, although Dr. Mac- Comber states that one g;ame at least will be p~ayed next week. The schedule has to be made in such a manner that it will not conflict with varsity practice, inter-fraternity games, military drills, and other times when the gymnasium is being used. The Seniors were out in force, and had a practice game, Thursday after- noon, and a number of the Sopho- more team were also out. The Freshmen had a large squad out earlier in the afternoon, and had a short scrimmage. This year, com- petition will be keen. A new trophy will be at stake, and the Sophomore team, which has been playing against the varsity, hopes to take first honors. As the rules of basketball are slightly different from those of last year, it is advisable for the members of the different teams to hunt UIJ a rule-book and study the contents diligently, as it is rumored that the referee this year intends to call fouls on the slightest pretext. literally it should be interpreted. Thes speaker portrayed two sides of Christ's character, his meekness and his outspokness, and explained the apparently opposing elements by showing- that the Saviour taught meekness and humility and Rove toward one's fellowman, but boldness and courage and severe punishment against the evil in man. The emphasis of the Dean's talk :fell upon the doctrine of \ love thine enemy\ as applied to states and the Wars of states. He declared that if a man is a christian, believing in the Christian doctrine of love toward all beings, his aim should be the g·rowth of his government toward this su- preme word of Jesus. Carrying- this idea further, Dean Ripton showed that states, by following the teach- ing of Christ would wage wars for worthy ends only, and with no hatred or injurious intent toward the enemy. Such a course would· justify w:irs, is justifying this present war, and has ennobled our own Civil War, par- ticularly through the influence of Abraham Lincoln's guiding thought of \malice toward none and charity for all.\ Dean Ripton commenced his discus- sion by quoting as his text a passag·e from Matt. 5 :38-42, in which Jesus says, \I say to ye, ye shall not resist him that is evil. When a man smite thee on the right cheek, then turn to CHEMISTS HOLD TWO . him the left also.\ The question be~ MEETINGS TO HEAR PAPERS. :fore us, said the Dean, is whether we The annual meeting of the Section of Eastern New York of the Amer- ican Chemical Society will occur Fri- day evening, December 14, at 8:15, in the Chemistry building.

It is difficult to answer that point. al- though men, such as Tolstoi and Wil- liam Penn have advocated an im- plicit obedience and faith in the first, most evident meaning. The speaker then went on to quote passa;ges, re- ferring to Jesus's meek and unre- sisting attitude toward His pers- ecutors, both at His anest, when He reproved Peter :for attempting re- sistance, and at His ·trial, when He showed remarkable forbearance and self-control. These quotations, as the speaker noted, show but one aspect of the character of the Lord.

' After the Terrace Council has once been formed and the elective mem- bers chosen by the Student Body, 'any new addition must be brought about through some action of the Terrace Council. Election to the Terrace Council has always been of course an honor. There are still four of the ten mem- bers composing the 1918 Terrace Council, in college. One third of the year has gone by and student life and activities are well under way. The four members of the Terrace Council remaining in college feel that they can carry on th ework of the Tenace Council a tpresent, now that it is well under way. If there is no real ne- cissity in such an election now, there surely would be little honor connected with it. There will perhaps arise before the end of the collegiate year, conditions which will necessitate another elec- tion. In such case the election of more members will be accompanied with the honor that is due it. Sincerely yours, PIERRE HOAG, President of the Terrace Council.
