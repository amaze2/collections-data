Garnet Five Easily Keep Pace and Wear Down St. Lawrence ·~Boys by Superior Endurance In two basketball gan1es of the fastest sort, Union annexed two more victories to· her long list and with but' one n1ore game ·on the sched- ule, her ·chances for the title of \'Champions· of the East/' look very bright to her many s_up- porters. -In the St. Lawrence game;·. Union atoned for the defeat of·last year ·Ctnd ·the R. P. I. game removed every doubt· as-to· the ·bet- ter team. THE ST. LAWRENCE GAME St. Lawrence came down from Canton with a most ·exc-ellent record, having suffered but two defeats. They were determined to- break the winning streak -of the Garnet iive, ·but alas, our title of \Champions\ ·we1;s not to be taken from us at this stage of the schedule.· Union has a hard· working team crnd early in the sea- son they decided this one ·gam·~ w~s- to be theirs, but it took the hardest kind of playing to break on the right s-ide. · There \vas a great ·deal of ·interest in this gan1e and as a result the · biggest crowd tha:t ever saw· -a· lJ·rtion Jl)isketbalt ·te·am play w1n-- ning ball,. was on hand Friday evening. The gan1e was, without a shadow of doubt, the fastest on the Armory ·court this year. The visitors played with wonderful form, secured a good lead in the first few minutes of play and held it £or, half ·a period, only to lose· it to Union in the latter part of the last period, for the terrific speed of the Union players was too much for them, though it must be admit- ted that St. Lavvrence ·was far from a slow ag- gregation. They w·ere fast on their feet, had their basketball eyes with them and excelled. Union in pass work, but alas, that~ whirlwind pace of Union was too .much for their larger and heavier opponents. They were game for . a while -but they could not keep it up for forty . minutes. It ·was the fighting qualities, that \never say die spirit,\ the .grim determination .. \to win that game,\ .that ·wore- down the St. Lawrence players, for·ced them to call for time and won the game for \Old Union.-\ To those who saw both gatnes, West Point and St. Law- rence, there was a great likeness but; alas, no . such climax. At the _beginning of the game St. Lawrence took the lead and before it, could be realized they had_ t.all~ed a . field basket. On. the jump · Griffin outstretched Woods and tipped the ball . . to Canfield who quickly passed . to \Vheeler , under the bas~et and he in turn dropped . it in. Again they worked the same trick~and as. quick-. . , ly they made another two points. . This was all , .. done so _fast that man;¥ could .hardly- beLieve ~ .

8 THE CONCORDIEN:SIS that it \vas possible and others lost hope at this stage of the gatne, but Union was only teasing, for on the next play Devvey can1e through \vith a pretty basket from one side. Cald·er of St. Lavvrence [ost his tnan and made the score 6-2 in their favor. Then followed so1ne of the prettiest passing and fastest sort of basketball. and his men were right after then1 every min_ ute. The visitors instead of wearing out the Garnet players as they ha-d hoped, only shot their bolt without worrying Union in the least. In the second half it was the Union players who set the pace and it proved to be too fast for the v1s1tors to follow; hence, the victory. Throughout the co.urse of the ,game it is safe to say that Union had three shots at the ring to ,~ ... Fo-r five long minutes neither team could get yvithin shooting distance of their basket. In this dine, however, Union fouled once and St . ; Lawrence thrice anrl just as many titnes the pill l ·dropped through the basket. This left the . one by the visitors. A hot game is always pro- ductive of ·\hard- luck\ shots and there were lots of them in Friday night's battle.\ score seven to five \vith Union holding the small. ~tid. \Voods then made his initial tally· anrl these two points tied the score.

I I • But St. Lavvrence was over-anxious and three times they \vere caught holding, which meant three more points for Union, for Houghtop '\vas at his best on free throws. This ended the scoring for this period. SECOND HALF In the second half 1Jnion came back fresh and strong, while the Reds wore a rather tired expression to say the least. Union was just starting, while the St. La··wrence strength was gone. They put up a staunch fight for a few 1ninutes but soon it was all over, for D. Beav- er scored on a hard earned try. Then came the \'break.\ Union had a lead, small it is true, but, s-on1ehow, all doubt seemed to· vanish fron1 the· tninds of the onlookers for St. Law- rence began to· play listless, losing ball. Point by point, the Union team forged ahead until a safe lead of eicht points was pi1 ed up, and then the ·whistle ended the argument. A Press comn1ent on the game reads : \St. Lawrence left the floor a thoroughly beaten tean1 rather to its surprise. The visi- tors had co·unted on 'their speed to vvin, but had not figured with the staying powers of the Un- ion players.

It is certain that no such gatne as last year is in store for the Union followers and \\ 7 hile the outcome is still uncertain, yet we have hopes.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 9 UNION 28, R. P. I. 13 Union Wins Second Game with R. P. I. and Makes it Ten Straight The basketball management took that \team of no gr·eat reputation,\ accDrding to the Cor- nell Daily Sun, on a trolley ride over to Troy to see the ne\v '87 gymnasium and to return R. P. I.'s favor of February 8th. A cro~;vd of stu·dents and supporters of the Garnet five vvas on the Union bleachers and the singing and cheering fron1 ·both sides waxed warn1 as the game proceeded. The gan1e was in charge of \0. K.\ Kuolt as referee and rrilclen as umpire. They had their hands full in applying the intercollegiate rules. The tean1s lined up ·\ivith regulars n1issing on both sides. Schell and Cleveland were playing guard and forward respectivelv for T_Tninn. while Captain Barr ·was absent fron1 the R. P. I. line-up. VV'ith the sound of the whistle both tean1s started off at a furious pace. There was, however, no scoring for nearly five min- utes of play. Kinlock broke loose and scored the first basket. . Almost i1n1nediately he re- peated the trick and with the score four to noth- ing against us, Coach Dawson decided to take no- further chances but sent out the Beavers to replace Cleveland and Schell. Immediately the contest assun1ed a different aspect. \Jake\ tore off the 1nost sensational shot of the game when he heaved the ball in from the center of the court. 1-Ioughton's injured arm had been hothering his foul shooting up to this tin1e, but now he ca1ne back with his first successful try for a foul. However, Rensselaer did not propose tn be thus easily caught up with and started off on a little ·whirlwind spurt and when, like the whirlwind, they had blovvn themselves out, the score stood 9-3 in their favor. After R. P. I. had ·ceased their noisy appreciation of this feat and the ~Cherry tean1 had recovered its wind, Referee Kuolt again put the ball in play and the real gatne started. With the Union defense stiffened, the tean1 ~;vork improved and Houghton once more husy in a systematic con- version of the results of R. P. I.'s football tac- tics into Union counters, the climb began and when the timer's \V'histle sounded the end of the half, Union had added seven points to its score making the count 10---9. The second half was all Union. Houghton did the first scoring with three successful , thro~;vs from the foul line. R. P. I. earned a field basket and scored on a Union foul making the score 13-12. Woods scored from the field and Union's score increased to 16 on Hough- ton's foul. I-Ioughton scored fron1 the field and after R. P. I. had added its last point on a foul, repeated the trick. Huff politely hand- ed the ball to· Dewey jttst to show· that there ·were no hard feelings and another basket was chalked up for Union. Brilliant bits of team work results in t\vo baskets by Woods and Houghton scored his fourth basket just before the whistle blew ending the half. The score: R. P. I. (13). B.

Y. \ UNION'S REPUTATION -NOT GREAT\ vV e should like to know how Cornell has come to the conclusion, voiced in the Cornell Daily Sun, that Union's team bears no great reputation, if the fact is not that soreness and prejudice have d~splaced her logic and reason. Her rash statement runs something like this: \Colgate suffered a 38 to 21 defeat at the hands of Union !College ·whose team bears no great reputation.\ N ovv if we recall that Con1ell was defeated by Colgate 34-23 and then put along side of this that Union \\Vhose repu- tation is not great,\ defeated this victor over . Cornell, \vhat shall we conclude to be the rep- utation of the vanquished Itha-cans? Will it be sufficiently honorable so as not to cause a smile to creep over the countenance of the college men of the country -vvhen Cornell lays claim to the Eastern cha1npionship? It appc\'rs amusing :to us since we twice defeated her Maroon conquerors, and again because Rochester trounced Cornell and we in turn d·efeateGl Rochester. Bt 1 t Cornell admits that Willian1s is fast, still \Villia1ns fell a victim to Union on \Nil- 1 . ' 1ams own court. And is C-ornell aware of the fact that \Vest Point received the only de- feat she has experienced this season fron1 our whirl vvind Garnet quintet? Perhaps Cornc:U doesn't notice either that the Arn1y has in turn defeated several of the conquerors of the Cor- nell fiye, \vhich reflects the tnore credit on Union. \Tv~ e n1ight keep on and boast of t .. 1r long list of ten consecutl\'e -victories indnd- ing the setback given to swift St. I~aw-. renee and con1pa re our record with that of 1·he Ithaca quintet for we show up \veil by coln- parison, but \Ve \iYill n1erely point out a fact or two to which The Gazette has already directed our attention, nan1ely that though we hear no great reputation the basketball n1anagl'- l 1ents of both Yale and Syracuse have ask eel f,)r games with Union this season, ·which in- d:cates that even though the fan1e of the State c}Jatnpionship five may not have reached Cor- nt-11 it has spread to son1e of the larger and less prejudiced institutions of the country. \V e truly regret that no contest can he played \\ ith ·Cornell this season for our quintet is n1ore trt'ln anxious to shatter the hopes that the I thacans are cherishing for the Eastern chan1- pi' >nship. But we would desire to schedule a gan1e for next season and hope the Cornell buys \vill see fit to acc~pt our challenge. ---:·o:--- Yale offers a ne-vv course of tra1n1ng for the consular service.

TliE CONCORDlENSlS 11 UNION LOSES BOTH DEBATES nv d-cfeatiqg Union at Schenectady and 1 Ia 1 ~·ilton at I'Ian1ilton, N.Y., Colgate won the [ 1 11.1r Lh annual triangular debate between these ,·lilleges. Union suffered a· double defeat, be-- iilg also beaten by the Hamilton tea.n1 at Clin- -t1Jl1. 11 antilton used her strongest co1nbina- t i, :n against the Union tean1 at Clinton and tive tariff. ny so clo.ing, the con1petitiori fron1 abroad ·would increase itnportation and thus prices would, of neces3it.y, fall. Union's second spea1:er. pointed out the im- sent a vYeaker tean1 to Hatnilton, N. Y ., to_ de- hate Colgate. Thus, Colgate, whose teams were n1ore evenly balanced, \vas able to carry off Loth cle bates. The proposition under discussion was, \Re- solved) That the present high cost of livit:g l 1 1 the United States \vonlc1 be 111ated8.lly recluced lJy the adoption of a tariff for re,~enue only.\ E;1ch collfgc debated both sides of the question, arg- 1 Ji:•g the negative at hin1e ancl upholding the ctffirn1ative abroad. AT SCHENECTADY The n1en representing Union Thursday night were Charles T. l\lale '13, Ray1nond S. Blod- gett '1~, Do,nald 1:\. ·Coulter '15, and Van Rens- scLtcr Tren1per '13, alternate. The opposing Colg-ate te an1 consisted of Alphonso \ 1 . Drisson '14, Frederick R. l\euhaucr '13, Bernard C. Cl~n1sf'n '15, and Pe·rTy S. Stevenson, alternate. In opening the clebat e, Drisson, the first speak- C'r for t11e affinnative, clcclared t11e subject to 1:e one of fact, rather. th8.n of policy or theory. 1\fter explaining the qncsti.on in general, he defi.11cd various tcrrns in the proposition, and then took up the n1ain argn1nent. proving that the prices of con1rnoc1ities are higher because n1ecliate results of the adoption of a tariff for revenue only. He -$hO\\~ed, that if prices \Yere lowered by co1npetition fro1n foreign n1ar- kets, the A1nerican producer woulrl seek .to ... . . ... .. .......... cut down vvages, tbus. proving a det~·iment .to the high cost oJ liv1ng, rathef· than a benefit.

In-support of this he gave statistics to prove th~ t high tariff and high wages c~o not ncce~sar:ly g·o together. · The last Union speaker showed the pennan- ent results of a tariff for revenue only.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS rgainst these men, and gained a. victory, which, however, was by no· means easHy \VOn. The 1-Ialni:lton team was as follows: Roy A. Porter '13, :H.amilton C. G.ris\vold ., 13, Donald E. Stone '13, and William H. Cole '14, alternate. Union, which in this case, argued on. the affirmativ-e, based its argu1nents on the ~ffect of the tariff on prices and wages. They held that a lower t~riff would tend to teduc·e prices, quot- i?g figures to shtJW that 'the present tariff im- poses a tax of a hundred do.Hars annually on e.very fam~ly in the lanrl. Regarding wages they argued thnt production would be increas- ed through ·the lower tariff, thus raising wages. Hamilton _admitted that the tariff might be one of th~ severa:l causes of the high cost of living. Their argument, an1oqg other things, was, prote~ted commodities ; that prices are not fixed by the tariff so much as by the fact of m-onopoly pt·Odnction; and the extortion by various middlemen. The mem:bers of both teams showed the re- sults of careful stndy and exceHent training, Hanigan, the last Union. spealcer, summed up for his side in excellent fashion. The ease of t~ e Hamil ton men in presenting their argu.:. men~s, and their convincing Je1i very\vere noted by many in the audience. The judges of award were: Judge George B. Turner of Auburn, N. Y. ; Timothy Sander- son, Esq., of Walton, N. Y., and Charles Schumacker, Ph. D., of Oneonta, N. Y. Judge Tnrn er announced the decision. . The debating season at Union is practically ended, with the exception, perhaps, of a debate \Vith N. Y. U. ·which is being considered. Al- 'though the results of the schedule show three ·defeats and .no .victories, the c()lJege has no rea ... Eon to feel disappointed in its teams. In each instance the men used every effort to win. Unio·n was represented by sotne excellent de- baters this season, and great credit is due to the n1en who consistently devoted their titne and ener.gy to uphold the :College in ~cQate. SECOND GIDDIN:GS LECT·URE, The second lecture on sociology was given in the Chapel, Wednesday evening. ProfessDr ·Giddings exp[ained as follows the meaning of \ . ]' 'h .·• \ socta aut onrty: \Against an socia] unrest of all ages, stands a pow:er against which this unrest must con- tend if it undertakes to make its great changes. This power is social authority. In the human cons;ciousness, this power can never be destroy- ed; it bas always ·existed and ever will exist. With iit in mind we must n1ake our plaRs. It may be tl tought of as government, as the state or as the wiU of the people to do colleetively that to \vvich the individual must yield. Many feel tha..t 1 his pow.er is more than mere might and thai i.;. is the authority of moral assurance and strenf th. .. \Mil1i0 as of laborers today feel clissati-sfiecl and hope, desire and expect the world will give them gre-·vter riches, fullness of life and op- portunif; .. s. A much smaller numher feel the influenc:t of social unrest, share a cornmon op1n1on and assent to a program of action. Finally r,niy a minority supplement their intel- lectual ~1greement by s·elf sacrificing action. Gener~ ~izing what is taking place in the labor movew:en1t, we may say that while tnany suffer under ,existing conditions and feel a necessity of rf'{orn1, only a few will assent to a definite plan of action; while of these still less -vvill givf the:ir. strength, and m-oney and tin1e to. push their cause. This general principle holds true in religion, politics, recreation and in every form of un:,ted human activity or \tean1 work.\ J n this way the authority of the state comes into ·exi.stence. A little group who are \doing things,' bring pressure to hear on another larger ·group who up until now met-ely assent to this action. This second group in retunt act on CLnother larger and less interested group until a large number, many of who·m pre- viously had no intention of taking an active part are brought to think and act ·with a single 1nind.', ·f'Ie ple to has it a elver know sourc CO·ltCe a plat will .c nattu trol t \It obed] whicl 1TIOfl1 tions rem a state actio: to de ditioi \1 of st num two ts a1 nun1 resu. tow A1 side1 rcpu whe wel nan1 \] 111or ly, ( anol effe1 resu a f:: left acti1 or, ~ \Vhi

!HE CONCORDIENSIS 13 .f{ere Dr. Giddings introduced an exam- ple to show how the state and social authority has its origin and growth. Suppose a catnp of adventurers is situated in some hitherto un- known part of the wodd-rich in natural r,e- sources. Som,ething arises which 11:ecessitates cO·ltcer·ted action. A few meet ancl agree on a plan to m·eet the emergency. This little gr.oup will ·come to don1inate things and f tom its very natttre will become powerful, rich and will con- trol the larger interests of the com·munity. \It will shape a body of laws a.nd con1pel obedience to then1. This then will be the state which can never be destroyed because from the 1non1ent when tnen try to better their condi- tions a new state is forn1ed from the shatter-ed remains of the old one. The beginning of the state is but the w·orking out of a psychological action by which those who can act are permitted to do so by those who desire to see their con- ditions bettered. \There is a great difference in tlite character of states, according as a very few or a large number con1pose the governing body. If hut two or three get together to a·ct, one of these is apt to becon1e a despot or tyra..nt. If the nun1ber is con1paratively large an aristocracy results, while if there are a great many willing to work, we have a republic or democracy.\ At this point Dr. Giddings stated with con- siderable ,en1phasis that we think we have a republican government in New York State but when the tnuhitude allows the bo~ses to rule ' we have an oligarchy in fact and a. r.epublic in nat:ne only. \If a vast multitude are widely different 111orally, educationally, politically and religious- ly, and is composed of races which hate one another, its divisions cannot get together for effective action, and social chctos and anarchy result. Two things may then happen; either a failure of collective action with. ev.erything left to individual enterprise and no effective action for education or suppression of crime, or, since the individuals are in a sta.te of nature \vhich is a state of war, there will be a call for an ''iron hand,\ and they will get it, :with the result that a despot will organize and rule the governn1ent. Both. of these conditions are to be seen in M·exico at present. If on the contrary, the people are fairly ·equal and are willing to concede na•tu ral dgh ts to each other the governmental organization will be a re- public or democracy. \The question a: rises\ what does this social authority do? By crin1inal law, it elin1inates those who differ too widely from the establish- ed standard and in a l~ess crude way by educa- tion, enlightenment and sanitary law for re- moving causes Df weakness or sickness, it brings n1en to· a more equal plane. \As an example, the rule in ancient Babylon and Egypt which forced men to \\rork, wor- ship and fight together, -cruel as it was, was really helpful by creating in ·mankind the habit of collective and effectual action. \'Ci vilizadon is commonly regarded as the sun1 of human achievement. The original m.eaning of citizenship was loyalty to the clan and later to the city, primarily a blood relation- ship and then a pledge of loyalty of men work- ing together for a common end. Loyalty to comtnon enterprise has 1 been obtained by ham- mering n1en into types and social authority alone enables men to do this wonderful thing.'' --:0:-- 1910 BANQUET 'rhe Schenectady members of 1910 at Union held a dinner at Glenn's last Friday night.

UNION'S CHA~MPIONSHIP TEAM '' Basketball Chatnpions of the Eastern Colleges!\ Sounds good, doesn't it? Sort o' rolls trippingly off the tongue and even when oft repeated. it does not pall the taste. '' Basketba11 Cnatnpions!'' and why not? Championships based on comparative score's are usually debatable and always unsatis- factory; ho\VL'\~er, since that is the on1 y way that the n1ooted question can be settled, Union's claim to the honor is as vvorthy of consideration as is that of \Ves1eyan, Corne11 or the Artny. i\ searching investigation of the records of the four tean'ls certainly con- vinces every Union supporter that we may justly clain1 the title and enjoy the distinc- tion. \~I e can scarcely hope to convince the follo,vers of the other teams. Corne11' s three decisive defeats by co11eges outside the Inter-collegiate League, speaks volun1es regarding the ca1ibre of the tean1s cotnposing that organization and easily dis- poses of Corne11's championship clain1s ex- cept -vvithin the restricted confines of the league. rrhe records of both \Vesleyan and the Anny are better than Cornell's, each having· defeated a greater number of different teatns. Then the Artny defeated Wesleyan- Union won from the Army. Enough said. Union leads. Artny claims sl1e lost because Sutton was ruled out. Union won in spite of ·the fact that two of her .regulars were ·ruled out. Then too V\re must remember that the Arm~· tean1 always has the decided advantage of playing all games on its o'vn court vvhich is of unusual si~e and has a floor as unyielding· as granite. Again I repeat it, Union, bas· ketball chan1pions of the eastern colleges. It sounds even better than it did before. .As for Rochester's one point victory in the first o·an1e of the season that \vas not a defeat h11t b in the language of the Scotc1l comedian.

THE CONCOROIENSIS 9 caliber provided it has the n1atertal and coach- ing, plus one other all-important factor, con- dition. We have had an three of these in a rnarked degree. We have won because we have trained conscientiously; because after the first gan1e the team vVa!? in splendid con .. clition and playing at its best at the very end of the games; because there was not a man on the team who knevv the meaning of the word quit. Here then, is the lesson \\re sho·uld derive from the season's record. The personnel of the tean1 \vas of a high order, physically, mentally, and n1orally. At the suvper after the last game, vvhen the team broke traininK (or perhaps I might say only 'benttraining') not a man indulged in the cup that cheers and only two of the seven players even sn1okecl. The team's record is a ~er1non on. the value of c1ean living. We are setting new athletic standards here at Union. Those standards can be best at- tained and maintained by clean living on the 1)art of every candidate for every tean1, in season and ont of season. The men con1pos- ing· the basketball team are men \vho are in condition all of the thne. Let the candidates for other tcan1s take the lesson to heart and 1.:: nion's na1ne shall be written high in the athletic history and in the records of \V\Orthy achieven1ent among- the foremost colleges of the land. It is not the intention of this article to analyze the playing abi1ity of the n1c1nbers of the team. The n1aterial has been first- class. Mr. Da\vson has amply de1nonstrated that the coaching of our tean1,~ is in safe hands. Captain beaver has set a standard for lTnion team captains that \vi11 be a n1odcl for vears to con1c. The tearn has \YOn tc~ ., cause it did it's best and deserved 1o \Yin. It has been well 111anaged and an is \YC11. .

Prospects for next year are most hopef u1 and \Ve should be on the schedu1es of several of the colleges who ililO\V think themselvc~ justified in disputing our elain1s to the sl:- pren1 e honors. S.

A REPRESENTATIVE CONCORDIENSIS After this week's issue the Coneordiensis will be under the direction of the new board, as the two senior ·editors \Vill then turn over the charge to their worthy successors. \Ve feel tha't our publication is to be guided by con1- petent, enthusiastic and active men, but we regret one condition which it is \vithin the po·wer of the students to re1nedy. Recently the ~tendency has been to allo\V the issuing of Con- corclensis to becotne a rnonopoly in the hands of a very few 1nen. 'rwo or three fraterni- ties have all the representatives on the board and this seen1s an unfortunate state ()f affairs. \Vhile ,ve do not \vant a large boanl we vvant one whose 1nembership at one 6n1.e or another will represent all of the fraternities and the neutral body. It is clear that n1ore interest would be aroused if son1e of the fraternities 'vho for several years have sent no men out for 1 Concordy competition 1 would begin at once to do so. A greater amount of live and inside news could be obtained and a better paper vvould be the result. Therefore, ·we ask that the fellows consider this matter and decide \V hether or not it is 1the proper and fair spirit to urge their brothers or associates to enter this ficlcl of journalisn1. The san1e old argun1ents still hold true re- garding the advantages of newspaper work. The training derived is valuable as a compan- ion to the courses in Rhetoric and English. This training supplements English work and shows some tangible results of the latter. Con- cordiensis reporting tends to make a n1an ac- curate in staten1ent, pron1pt in the perfonn- ance of duty, alive to the topics of the day, especially to those of student inter·est, and ori- ginal in n1atters of thought and expression. It is a field ever open to the 1nan -vv ho wants to assist his Alma Mater in son1e large way, and in this light, appeals to the man who can not play on the athletic teams but who does not want to go 'through college as a recluse or without hav- ing given his Alma l\!Iater some recompense for the innun1erable blessings she has showered upon him. The ·Concordiensis Board has suffered this year through several of its members leaving c·ollege and this has given an unusual oppor- tunity for upper class1nen to make the board without preliminary competition. There are still some sophomore positions to be filled and there probably will be more in a short time so that we \vould desire to hold this up as an in- ducen1ent for underclassmen to con1e out for the board at the beginning of next term. In conclusion we remind again those f rater- nitics who hav.e no representatives on our ,red their they petit that will \\'e fact yan' mat' cent per eel ' u l Ch~ of 1 snt Poi ' def the 1 e() ,._, def lll ibl \Vn tht by ph ~lC on te1 1at w1 R< l)f st· pc fe it

The manager of ·Concorcliensis receives forty per cent of the net profits and the editor twenty per cent. 'rhe ren1aining forty per cent is turn- eel over to the Publication Boa rcl. ---:o:--- UNION CHAMPIONS OF STATE AND EAST P.J.. nun1ber of tean1s l1ave laid clain1 to t11e Championsl1ip of the East but a careful stu(ly of records wi11 show that only four have a substantial claim and these arc t:nion, \Vest Point, Wcs1ev·an and Cornell. \Vest Po-int has a clean record, save for the defeat frorn usl and she bases her clain1 on the assertion that she has played larger col- leg·es than \Ye have and that -vve \Yere once defeated by Rochester \V hon1 she o-vercame in easy tnanner. That sounds slig-htly plaus- ible to one \vho isn't aware that the gan1e in \Vhich \YC were defeated by Rochester \Yas the first ()ll.C of the season, that \VC 1 ost by 111ere1 y one point and that R.oche~ter b::ul played three contests before trying ccmC'1u- ~ions \Vit h tl: C (;arnet five, and that after one 1nore ~-arne, Union journcyL:d to Roches- ter and c1efea ted the ·y c11ow qn i11 tet on tbc latter's O\Vll collrt. l\1oreo\·er, the contest in which the Artny triun1phed O\.L'r I(ocLe~ter wa~n 't ~uch a g1oriuus yictnry becau~e tbc Rocheslcr boys had played gan1es on the t\YO 1)receedi 11g· days and this to get her ·with t11c strain of tra-veling put the y·ello\v fi\·e in poor condition. Still if \Vest Point has t1e- feated teams repTesenting-larger institutions, it cloesn ,t me~n th~t ,,,re co11l(ln 't defeat those same ao·o·reg·ations some of our y1cti11 ~ '; <:::>b . ' have defeated then1. And it doesn't ovc1 co1ne the fact that the Cadets fe11 heavily be'· fore the Union bo-ys, and it can't be made t•> atone for her defeat. vVest Point n1ade three field baskets to Union's eight and was clearly outplayed in every phase of the game except in the thro\VS fron1 the foul line where the Army had the advantage because our free throvvcr had been taken out of the gan1e t'hrough personal fouls. w~sleyan has been playing excellent ball, yet she hasn't hit the Union pace. She has stun1bled at \Vest Point and ag-a1n at Syracuse, the respective scores being 29-24 and 30-19. The \Vest Point gan1c \Yns the fourth on her s~hedu1e an(1 the Syracuse something like the un1nck~' thirteenth \Yhich sho-ws that ~he hasn't kept the con~~istC\nt steady speecl of th~ lTnion tL'~lln.

Cornell, at first \vas, rather loud in her c1ain1s for the chan1pionsbip bnt her record rcvca1s four defeats ancl that appca1s to ns as a considerable.nun1ber fur a chan1pion quit- tet. Coach Shaxpc has cyiclently realized this and a~serts that Cornc•ll \Yi11 put in no clain1 to the chan1pionship. T\vo c>f tl1c~L!

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS the strongest and most logical claim to the cha1npionship? If there isn't a team vvith as good a record as ours, we certainly deserve the laurels. The press of the ·country has taken notice of our Whirh.vind Quintet and \Ve certainly can't see ho\¥ they ~an hand the honors to any other team, especia11 y after vie\ving our record in another part of this lSUe. ---:o:--- JAK'E BEAVER ELECTED CAPTAIN A vote of the \T arsity and second basket- ball team, taken on Tuesday afternoon, re- sulted in the choice of Jacob Beaver '15, for captain .of next year's quintet. J akc suc- ceeds his brother Dave and no one doubts but that he vvill steer the team through a victorious season and try hard to equal his brother's record. --:0:-- NO DEAL AGREEMENT TO BE VOTED UPON IN SPRING TERM In a special n1eeting of the student body held on Tuesday noon, Rogers '13 explained to the students the nevv '' No Deal Svste1n '' which has been recently dravvn up by the Terrace Council. The idea, \vhich is basic in this proposed syste1n is that the san1e sentiment whicl1 rnoved the stnc1ent body to establish the Honor Systetn should n1ove it to establish this systen1. The Honor Court in accordance with the purpose for which it -vvas established \v111 act as the comn1ittee to take charge of the \Vorking of the nevv system and to try any cases of its violation. The syste1n is to be voted upon by the student hoc1y each year \vithin one month of the opening co1lege meeting and if there is any necessary ratifi- cation the Honor Court \vill conduct such ratification. The agreetnent in short is that as students of Union we pledge ourselves not to attempt to carry out any understand- ing by which we will support any undergrad- uate for any undergraduate office in view of some consideration for such support. Eaeh student \viH he required to sign his name to this agreement as he did to the Honor System shon1d it be passed by the student body. The penalty for violation of the agreement to be that the student \vi11 forfeit his eligibi- lity for any undergraduate office or cornn1it- tee and also his privilege of voting in any undergraduate election. The natne of the student violating this agreen1.f'nt to bL' broug·ht up in student meeting by the Honor Court. ------: 0 :-- HITCHCOCK CHOSEN EDITOR-IN- C'HIEF BY UNDERGRAD~ UATE BOARD Other Members of Concordiensis Board Also Selected H. Herman Hitchcock '14 is the'ne\v ed- itor-in-chief of the Concordiensis. He has been a men1ber of the board since his fresh- lnan year and has always evinced a keen interest and offered generous assistance in the maintenance and the betterment of on r publication. Having had as good training as can possibly be desired from journalistic work on the Concordicnsis there is no doubt but that the new editor \vi11 issue a paper that wi11 be attractive and a credit to L.,.nion. Hitchcock is a n1e1nber of Delta Upsilo11. The new assistant eciitor, Raymoncl v·an Santvoord '14, has heen doing lively \vork during the past year in cotnpetition for thi~ office.

OvJing to the n1arked improvement in tTnion''s athletic abiJ!ities, which consequently causes a larger portion of the Concordiensis to be devoted to athletic. ne\VS, it has beeu deemed a wise plan by the Publication Board to appoint a man to have charge of this de- partment. Roblee H. V aug \han '14 has been elected ath1etic editor. He has taken charge of a considerable portion of the athletic ne\VS during the past year and this experience, together with additional ne·wspaper training of a similar variety made Vaughan the choice for this new editorship. He is a n1ember of the Delta Phi fraternity. The Publication Board also beli~ved that it would be a beneficial addition to Concorcli- ensis to elect an alumni editor since there are so n1any alumni subscribers to the paper who are deeply interested in this coh1n1n. This department wiH, therefore, receive more careful attention in the future undr the di- rection of Arthur D. Sherman. Hughes '15, W. C. Baker '15, D. A. Coulter' 15, H. N. Hubbs '15 and E. R.

At present it appears that Concordy conflits in a fe\v instances \vith the Press Club to the disadvantage of the latter. It is bc- lieyecl that a plan of concerted action can be adopted whereby each ,.si11 be benefited ancl the interests of lTnion fn rthcr promoted.

14 THE CONCO~RDTENSIS CLASSICAL CLUB CONVENES The Classical Club of Union Col1ege met 1n \IV ashburn Hall, Tuesday evening at 7:15. After sotne pre1in1inary business, the 1nen~bers sang se\~eral stanzas of the old Latin song '' Lauriger I-Ioratius.'' Next ca1ne a papeT, ''Three Ancient Quacks\ by Professor Kel- logg. The three gentlemen discussed \vere Alexander, the false prophet, Peregine and Appo1onius of Tyre. Professor Kellogg's charact~rization of these three c1Cl;ssic fakers, c3rried 'vith it a thread of hutnor, \\rhile by his com1)arisons he gave to present day hocus- pocus a very time honored aspect. In the course of the reading, he established the fact that the first \vas preeminently tl1e ·worst de- ceiyer of the1n all. The second 1vas son1e- thing of a skeptic, \vhile the third \\Yas un- doubtedly demented by a thirst for popular applause. On the \\Tho1e, Professor Kel1ugg' s lecture 1 vas snc11 as to stimulate interest in classica reading and research for the s~ke of the re- \vards \vhich such activities yield. At the conc1us.ion of the paper, Professor Bennett talked a few n11nutcs on p~)ints in the lecture \Yhich appealed to hin~ particu- larly in a vein that \vonld lead one to believe that the fakers are not all dead yet and that I' John '' is in the habit of so1netimes testing- his o\vn g-enuineness. l-Ie re1narked that he felt '' \:vound up '' and that there ,,~ere t\yo 1 h • I C lk l l 1 voices, one that tole 1111 to ta · 011 anc - the other to \stop.'' 1}nfortunatcly, the hour for the concert ·was at hand and the speaker obeyed the latter voice. .1\mong· other rnen1 bers of the facn lty \Y ho \Yere present, vvere Dean Ripton, Professor March and Professor Chase.

THE ·CONCORDIENSIS 15 GLEE CLUB SEASON IN RETROSPECT Our Glee Club season during the current colle:~~e year cann:)t be ·said to have been em- inently successful or satisfactory. We had an excellent club with which to start the year and the outlook at that time was indeed prorn- ising. Prospects were good for a schedule of c )ncerts ab0ve the ordinary and a thor- oug·hly efficient organization seemingly ex- isted. This situation gradually, howeve1·, resolved jtself into o:1e of extreme difficulty for the 1nanager and leader. The n1em bers of the Club failed to grant it the degree of loyalty required of them, th~ systemof coaching cre- ated an unfavorable in1pression ·upon our audiences, and faculty regulation disqualified son1e of our men. These are are the reasons for the litnitaton of Glee Club activity this year. These disagreeable factors can all be elim- inated by the student body, acting as a \vhole, and by the individual members of this organization in their official capacity as n1embers. Our Glee Club, one of the finest advertising mediums at the comma.11d of the students, should demand the same degree of loyalty as any other of the major College or- g-anizations. Cutting rehearsals an..d concerts f->r the sake of imn1ediate pleasures, or thru C)n1paratively minor causes, sh.ou1d be- come a thing of the past. A U njon tnan' s own 1)ride in his college and all its activities should impel him to put his \vho1e loyalty into whatever line of activity he espouse~. A 1 u 1\:ewarn1 in tercst vvill never react to his O\VTI or to his Aln1a :\!later's ad\Tancctnent. It is because of this situation that it has been deetned advisable to cancel the N C\V York t1·ip, the concerts of \vhich have in the past been of the very highest q_t1a1ity and which is most important in reflecting either to the henifit or to the injury of the co lege. c;~nerons praise should be given to those n1en w·ho haye stood by the Clubat all times, \vho have been faitl1ful to their duty, and ·who have thus evidenced honest co11ege spirit In their own sense o£ having done ' ' the right thing ' ' these men find their greatest satisfaction and ~eward. -----:0:-- THE LAST MUSICAL The last of the fourth series of musicales, under the auspices of Union College, was held in the Chapel, Tuesday evening, March 11. Mr. Reinald \Verrenrath delighted a representative audience with his rich baritone vo1.ce.

16 TfiE CONCORDIENSIS JUNIOR QUINTET CREATES WRONG IMPRESSION The junior basketball tean1 is deserving of censure from the student body for playing with several tean1s in this vicinity and sched- uling their contests under the name of Union College. This name was intentionally inde- finite but led the opponents of the juniors to believe that they were playing Union College and therefore caused them to be n1ore an xi- ous to schedule games. Manager Lutz '14 is subject to discipline by the faculty and ath1etic board for a11o-vving his team to create such a wrong impression vvherever it \vent. An account in a Cooperstown paper, which ,\vas kindly sent us by H. G. \.,.an Deusen '10 reads in part as follo\vs. \ C. H. S. Downs Union \ \The C. H.
