:: T • - The Concordiensis VOL. 35. MAY 1, 1912 No~ 22 PROGRAM OF THE PAGEANT Thirty -five Students To Take Part of Indians The plans for the pageant have now been com- ' pleted. The various con1:mittees have been selected also many of the players who are to . take part and the rehearsals have begun. The officers who are directing the pageant are: Mrs. Joseph Clements, Jr., chairman; Mrs. Hueston, treasu~e.; Mrs. Charles Alexander Richmond, secretary. Committees have been organized to take charge of organization, print- ing, costumes, advertising, art, music, and finance. Miss McKay has arrived and has begun work in coaching the players. The art committee, of which Mr. Mott Smith of the Schenectady Dramatic Club is chairman, has designed a poster for advertising the pageant. It represents an Indian standing on a cloud and overlooking Schenectady and the Mohawk Valley. At his side is a totem pole from which floats a streamer curved in the form of the letter \S\. A call has been issued for thirty-five students to take the part of Indians. Hiawatha will be played by Daniel Glen Smith, '12. The costumes will be pro- vided in par~, at least, and if it is found necessary for the students to procure any part of their costumes , the cost will not exceed a doltar ancl twenty cents at most. Photographs have been taken of several scenes of the pageant and will appear shortly in the New York newspapers. An -effort is being made to obtain per- mission to use the old DeWitt Clinton locomotive, the first stean1 locomotive to operate successfully in this country. The program of the pageant is as fellows: Traditional Life. 1. The kingdom of Schonowe and the passing of Hiawatha. The Early Se~~lement. 1. The coming of Van Curler. 2. The.massacre. 3.

ACADEMICS TRIUMPH OVER E'NGINEERS lN DOUBLE HEAD'ER Classical Men Prove Their Superiority on the Diamond by Scores 30-27 and 14-S ---- The annual spring baseball craze has again struck the college and the general demoralization of work which always follows it, has struck us with it. In fact, everybody struck Friday tnorning, and a double· header on the campus was the result. The junior en- gineers bolted \Johnny\ Callan and the academics bolted \Spike\ and for about two hours these two divisions bated for honors on the diamond. The first game which was won by the academics by the score of 30-27 was close and exciting throughout. The classicals secured a big lead early in the game, but in the seventh, errvrs by the infield coupled with several timely hits enabled the engineers to tie the score. In the ninth the classicals got to Cronin for three doubles and a single and sewed the game up. The second game was also extren1ely interesting. The urn pi ring of Dr. Callan featured for the engineers, while the- entire academic team shared in the honors of dis- puting his decisions. At one time, it looked as if he would be forced to retire to his rooms in the En- gineering building but the timely appearance of \Opy\ and \Joe\ Wolf prevented violence. We almost for- got to st(!te that the academics won again by the score of 14-5. Let us hope that this noble pastime and the attendant bolts will live long and prosper.

MVSICAL CLUBS ENTERTAIN AT CANAJOHARIE AND FORT PLAIN Saturday afternoon the Musical Clubs made a trip to Canajoharie aud ~ort Plain, giving a concert in Canajoharie in the. afternoon and one at Fort Plain in the evening. AU the m~n who made the New York trip, were taken on this one. The concert at Canajoharie was given in the Wag- ner Opera House and was well attended,. the house being packed. In addition t<;> the regular program, a new idea was tried out. For the first number the men all carne running on the stage with suit cases in their hands as if just arriving from the depot. After rush- ing around for a moment, they got in line and opened the concert. This little stunt met with great applause from the audience. All the men did remarkably well and the concert was favorably ·received. In the evening, the Clubs gave a concert in the Fort Plain Theatre. Although the audience was not so large as the one at Canajoharie yet the atte:.1dance was good. The banjo and mandolin clubs rendered some fine music and their work did much to make the concerts successful. After the concert the men left for Schenectady on the 10:30 car. , SOPHOMORE COM'MITTEES Several .sophomore committees have been appointed just recently, they consist of: Cane Committee-R.

THE CONCORDIENSIS .9 F A!MED SONS OF OLD UNION \ Thy sons in life have done thee honor, And spread afar thy name.\ -· · Union .Ra!lly Song. There is perh~ps no small college which can boast as many distin~uished alumni as c:an Union. Union College has sent out into the varying activities of th.e world men. of intellect and ability; her' sons have re- flected honor and glory on their alma mater. From Union's gray old walls have gone forth to far di- verging interests men who have won fame in their work. Well does our song express the thought: ''If true sons are jewels a mother adorning, Resplendent Alma Mater's brow with light.\ Union's halcyon days have always been regarded as those before the Civil War, the advent of which called to their homes the many Southern students who were at Union. The fame of Union and her great presi- dent, Eliphalet N ott, attracted men from distant states. The names of Union's far-famed graduates are well known to us;. as we look back on the records of Union's past we find there men of fame in every line -great scholars, statesmen, soldiers, diplomats, au- thors, theologians and educators. For decades men have worked to set the stage for the Uni~n of today. It may be that the recital of the achievements of some of Union's noted sons may prove tiresome and trite. But it has occurred to the editors that it would not be out of place to give briefly a series of short ac- counts of the liv:es and achievements of a few of the men who have won honor in their work in the world. During the next five numbers of THE CONCORDIENSIS will appear accounts of many early graduates. It is intended this year to cover the great graduates of the earlier history of the college, while next year will be taken up the li¥es of the later graduates. H COLLEGE MEETtNG In the college meeting of April 29, announcem.ent was made of the Schenectady pageant to be h.eld on May 30, 31 and June 1. A request was made for thirty-five students, large men preferred, to take the part of Indians. Such n1aterial ought not to be dif- ficult to secure. · Track men were urged to come out every afternoon in preparation for the meet to take .place on May 11. It was stated by captain S.treever that while much preparation ·was needed, pro~pects for victory were very :favorable. C. L. Hequernbourg reported that a petition to the faculty would be drawn up asking for a re-instatement of the old bolt system beginning next fall. DR. HOFFMAN SPEAKS ·AT VESPER SERVICE At the Silliman HaU vesper service last Sunday, April 28th:,. Prof. Hoffman gave an interesting talk on tne religions of this region. The Shakers are a communistic sect, founded by Ann Lee, in Manchester, England, who came to this country in 1774. In 1776 they bought land at Nis· kayuna, in the township of Watervliet, near Albany, and settled there. Here they formed a community with Mother Ann, as she called herself, at the head. A spiritualistic revival at New Lebanon, New York, sent many penitents to W atervl,iet, which afterwards led to the establishment of a bishopric at New Leba- non. ·Many communities have been established in the East and South but few of them have endured, and in 1908 there were only about 1000. Spiritualism originated in a family by the name of Fox, about 1848, at Hydesville, Wayne County, N. Y. They were bothered at times by knockings, which on investigation proved to be made by some intelligent source which would make raps as requested, and. communication being established, the rapper professed to be the spirit of a murdered peddler. Thus Kate, and her sister, Margar2t Fox, became the first spirit- ual mediums. At Rochester, where they went to live, Spiritualism was developed to its present forn1, and lost relatives and spirits of eminent men are thought to have communicated with them. The common name given to the Church of Latter- Day Saints, is Mormons, a religious sect founded by Joseph Smith, Jr., at Manchester, N.Y., in 1830. Since 1848 it has centered around Salt Lake City. Smith claimed to have had revelations and visitations of .angels, which .enab!ed him to locate son1e gold plates, on which was inscribed the Mormon creed, but which soon after they had been translated, disappeared. Along with the gold plates were found a pair of silver framed crystal spectacles. With the aid of these the mystic .characters on the plates could be read. A book said to contain the translation of these gold plates was published, but which was later shown to be the revised romance originally written by Solomon Spauld- ing, In conclusion, Prof. Hoffman made a comparison between our Christian religion and those of these three sects. a . . ' Harold S. Vroman, '15, was taken to the hospital this week to be operated upon for a severe case of appendicitis.

There will be more high school men on the hill and there will be new attractions to interest them. It has been a splendid change to make the medals this year in the form of watch fobs having the idol stamped upon them. This will present and keep before the new men one eccentric characteristic of Union for which she is known far and wide. It certainly will tend to arouse their curiosity and will afford a means of stirring up interest and a desire to come to Union, in those men who are at al~ inclined ·to possess a combative spirit. The Union men will be given an exceptional chance of coming in closer contact with the high school students as their guests will take dinner at the various fraternity houses this year. It, of course, will be a considerable benefit to the visitors to have this courtesy extended to them, for, aside from giving them an opportunity to get better acquainted, it will do away with their taking dinner down town and will make it more pleasant for them to ~ stc: a , be thl he th OV m pt id T n< a1 .rr rt: fc 0 b 1= ( ( ]

rrHE CONCORDIENSlS stay for the campus meeting in the evening. This meeting ought to make a vivid impression on the sub~freshmen. Up to the present time there has been ·a larger registration than ever before, but this is oniy an index of success. lt falls to the lot of the men on the hill to make success certain. See to it that all the rnen registered get here!~ See to it that they receive a hearty welcome! See to it further, that there are no men in your home town who might be here but who have been overlooked through your negligence! Surely there must be more prospect- ive college men than_we manage to entertain here, and if each and every man would keep his eyes wide open and feel an individual responsibility and pride in this matter, U.nion would certainly profit by it. Now that a permanent coach has been secured we must make it our ideal to have first-class teams and to develope a permanent winning streak. The .most strenuous efforts are being made to' bring out any athletic ability now present in our institution, and doubtless more or less success will attend these attempts, but we need more athletes ! Consider what . loss we .must suffer by graduation, and let this, together with numerous other reasons, be powerful incentives for inducing every true Union man to put forth his best efforts for the benefit of his Alma Mater ! ~4e mcrrace ~nnss Since it has been definitely decided to revive the old Union custom of coming together on the campus to sing the old college songs; the plan should be carried out in good form. It is a distinctive custom, a custom to be proud of and one worthy of consistent support. This will not only be an opportunity to sing the old songs and incident- ally practice a few new ones, but it will also afford a chance to improve our yelling. It has been considerable time since the students have given any yells in the open and the rest is noticeable in the calibre of the cbeeTs. There is just a little room for developn1ent and we ought to take advantage of this means of improvement. . u~ JffztttltC~S ijloftraro ~lt5tUCSS cVlffrtt It would only be a \square deal\ on the part of the college men if, when making purchases of various kinds 1 they used a little discrimination in re- gard to the different places of business in and out of town ,;vhich they pat- ronized. All Union students would do well to patronize the business men who advertise in any of our college publications. This spirit of fairness per- vades most colleges and is generally in evidence at Union, yet there are times when the men grow careless. It will not be asking an especial favor of the students since the best business houses are the ones that place their advertisements in the college publications, it will only be asking the fellows to pe more careful about doing the fair thing. li \'

12 THE CQN,CO'RDIENSIS ======~~==~======================================================================~ .. ~.~ UNION ALUMNI ASSOCI:ATION DIN:£ AT TENEYCK The Union University Alumni Association. beld their annual election and banquet at the Hotel Ten Eyck, Albany, on Saturday evening. The affair was prob· ably the nost enjoyable one ever held. WiUiarn: P. Rudd, supreme court justice of Albany, acted as toast- master and called up.on five speakers. The first was Dr. Mosher, '86, who was one of the organizers of the alumni, who proposed its first by-laws and acted as its first secretary. He .spoke of the standard of medical excellence upheld by Union and of the development of the medical profession. Irving W. Wiswall, '81, dwelt upon the splendid record of Union graduates and of the efficiency t>f the university and its faculty. Alexander N. Campbell, '81, spoke at length of the Roosevelt-Taft controversy. Dr. John I. Bennett told many college happenings in his usual humorous manner. Dr. Richmond was the principal speaker of ihe evening and gave a most interesting talk which was in part as follows : A Leveling Process There is a leveling proces$ going on tn the world today which is felt in every range of life. It is no doubt true that the general level of human life has been raised, but we have had to pay the price. There has been a leveling down as well as a leveling up. The conditions of modern life are not favorable to the development of great individualities; and this is a loss hardly to be made up. It has been said that the his- tory of a nation is a history of her great men. Cer- tainly the progress of civilization has been marked by the strong impression which great individttals have made upon it. Great masses of men do not elevate themselves any more than a man can lift himself by his boot straps; when they are elevated it is because some great man has reached down from above and lifted them up. \' Now the colleges of the_ country have made a record in producing such men. When one considers the relatively small number of college men in this .country the record is remarkable. To speak only oi Union, one of the smaller colleges; among our products are one president of the United States, two secretaries of state, two secretaries of war, and several other mem- bers of cabinets; twelve United States senators: 132 members of the house, including two speakers; a large number of governors of states and foreign ministers; one-fifth of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals; judges of New York State; seventy-six · c-ollege presi- dents, including Princeton, Brown, Mic:higan; Vassar ' Smith, besides tnany others whose names are writ large upon the history of this nation. Capable Leaders Needed What we need, what we always need, is leaders-- men capable of large views and able to bring to the tasks which lie before us in this country, a trained mind and statesman-like spirit; and it is out of the political principles to public questions as they arise. The security of a government like ours is only to b@ found in the ability of the ·great tnass of the people to think for themselves and to test the truth of the ques- tions which affect them. Millions of our voters do not think. This is whst gives the fishwife orator his chance. Billingsgate is better for his purpose than the soundest reason. It is the business of the educated man not only to think for himself but also to expose and resist the . . demagogue; and it is the mission of the college to add year by year to the number of the men who judge and act by the light of intelligence and conscience. There is especial reason why Albany should take pride in Union. The first petition for a college in this part of the country offered in 1779 came from 542 in· habitants of Albany couty. Three of the presidents . . of the colleg~ have been taken from Albany. The professional departments of the university are all situ· a ted here and many of our most distinguished gradu · ates have come from this city, including John C. Spencer who became secretary of war, and Francis Waland the great president of Brown university. Important College Center I want to call your attention to one very important fact; nearly all the great colleges of this country are located at important centres of population, and in all cases a large majority of the students come from a radius of fifty miles, taking th.e college campus as a centre; this is true of even the m 1st celebrated of our universities. The immediate locality is the element which gi~es greatest strength to a university. Now we h<:tve here an ancient and honorable institution. The college founded in 1795, became a university in 1873. Th€ organization, somewhat loose, needs strengthening, and this will come about. We have a natural centre for a great university--some day this will come to pass. Here in Albany, a place of Capitol importance, with a population of 100,000; Troy with 76,000; Sche- nectady with 73,000; Amsterdam with 31,000; Water· vliet with 15,000, besides many smaller towns, making a total of nearly half a million within easy reach. It opens to us a prospect which ought to stimulate local . pride.

This scored Weaver and left Williams on third. Jones seored Williams on a single and Mulcahy sent a warm one .over second. Stillson Union lost to ·Middlebury Saturday in a game which bore every evidence, until the very end, of a garnet . fanned but Vail pounded out a double bringing home Jones and Mulcahy .. Vail came home on McMahon'·s error in right field and Ellison ended the rally with .a. grounder to second. Union made a strenuous effort to overcome the leacl - victory. The hopes of the Union rooters grew brighter and brighter as. the game progressed, until the .eighth inning, at which time they were almost entirely shattered. A spark of hope was kindled in the ninth when a rally was started but this too died of their opponents in the last two innings but one run was the best the team could do. out shortly. A Bright Beginning Union made a sensational start by netting two run~ in the first inning. Bische sent a warm drive to the shortstop who found some difficulty in handling it and consequently he reached first in safety. Naumann, the next man to bat, saw one of Stillson's benders coming just about where he wished it and he met the ball squarely. The sphere sailed neatly through the air and landed some distance back of the 1eft fielder. By the time it had been recovered Naumann had made a complete circuit of the bases bringing Bische home also. Alpert Strong in Tight Place it l.)oked a little dubious for Union in the fourth inning when Triggs started off with a three bagger. Weaver sent a long drive to center and before the baU could be returned Triggs crossed the plate. The next two men hit safe, and it only required a hit to make the score even or more than even. But that hit was not forthcoming. Alpert recovered himself im- mediatEly and pitched himself out of this hole in a 1nost credtable manner. Lucky \Fifth The fifth inning proved a fortunate one for the gar· net team as a· stol~n base aided by two hits added another tally to the score. Fa tal Eighth The game then went on quietly until the fatal eighth. It began well but ended disastrously. Triggs fanned. Weaver singled through short. Williams drove one to deep center which Geddings would have captured, as he did the rest that came his way, had Creditable Playing of Union and Visitors Except in one ·ol!· two instances the playing of tbe gar~et team mu~t be commended. They put up a game fight a~d deserved to_ win. This is especiall'Y true of Alpert who pitched in go9d form and had the Middlebury men guessing the whole time except b.1 the eighth inning which proved an unfortunate olle all around. The team had to contend with· an es· pecially capable pitcher. Stillson certainly was master of himself throughout and served some drops that were very deceiving. It was a pitcher's battle all the way and the num· ber of strike outs was large. Twelve by Stillson and. ten by Alpert. Only one base on balls was doled ot:tt.

Visitors Win Close Game by u Scor·e of 1-0 Last Tuesday, in one of the most closely contested games ever seen on the campus, Rochester defeated Union by a score of 1-.0. The winning run was made in the beginning o.f the ninth inning by Scheon, who got to first on a hit, was advanced to third by a hit by Skiff, and came hom.e on a sacrifice fly by Benzoni. In the last half of the ninth Shaw got to first but was put out at second trying to steal. Each team made but one error~ A Pitchers' Battle The work of both pitchers was remarkable through- ' out the gaille. Dan O'Keefe struck out ten men and gave only two bases on balls while Harding struck out nine and walked but one. Four hits were made off O'Keefe a:nd five off Harding. Kaiser of Rochester made the onJy two-base hit in the game. ·Both pitchers were given good support, the fielding being excellent if not sensational throughout.

Inter-Collegiate Committee-Hummer, '15.' Educational Bulletin Committee, which sends out a . weekly bulletin of Union College new~ to educational magazines-Dr. Hale. Each chairman under the new assign1nent system, is to post his assignments for the day on the bulletin board in the Press•Club rooms. Each member of the club then goes to this bulletin, signs up for his work for the day and gets the same ready for the type- writer assigned to take care of his article. In this way the machinery of the club will work with the . greatest efficiency and without discord and trouble. The change from having one man assign all the news to having the chairman of each committee as- sign the items which come under its head will help to cover all the affairs ·Of the college more complete1y and to get this to the papers which will use the news while it is still live and interesting reading. FAMED SONS OF OLD UNION Tayler Lewis Tayler Lewis is regarded as the leading scholar of his day in this country-. Indeed it has been stated that by means o:ii his scholarly works he made a deeper impression on the history .of his time than if ~ he had led the victorious armies of the North in the Civil War. 'Tayler· Lewis was born in Saratoga County, New York, on March 27; 1802. His father was a captain in the Revolutionary army; his m.other was a niece· of John Tayler, lieutenant-governor of New York. Bie prepared for college at Salem, N. Y., and entered Union in 1816. While here, as was natural, his. scholady ability was evident. He led his class from the beginning and in 1820 was graduated. He had specialized in the study of Latin and Greek, and was elected to membership in Phi Beta Kappa. It had been the intention of the young man to enter the law profession, and to thi£ end he read law for a year in Albany. But it proved far from congenial to him; his sche>Tar's taste asserted itself, and by 1830 the call of learning had,. become insistent. Leaving his law books he became principal of the schools of Waterford, New York. It was in. a Phi Beta Kappa oration at Union in 1839, entitled \Faith the Life of Science\ thai: the really great powers of Tayler Lewis were seen. Through this effort he received calls to professorships in several institutions of higher learn- mg. \Plato vs. the Atheist\ is regarded as a great contribution .to the literature of philosophy. In 18491ay-ler Lewis returned to his alma mater, . this time a professor. He had accepted the chair of G:reek and Latin, and later, of Oriental Languages and Biblical literature. Among the students of the fifties and sixties th.e name of Tayler Lewis stands out, a beacon light of culture and learning even among thE' famed names that Union's faculty then boasted. In the outer world his learned treatises shed an added lustre to his own name and that of Union College. As a scholar tbere was none his equal in this country; as a man he was loved and honored by all who knew him. Among some of his works are \Six Days of Cre- ation' , \The Bible in Science\ \Heroic Soldiers of the American Army\ •'State Rights\. These writings, published tluoughout the country, had a great in- fluence on thinking people. In lateT ]ife he was afflicted with deafness, but this did not check his zeal as a writer and speaker. Union College was the scene of his last public appearance; here he deH vered the Comtnencement Address in 1876. He died in Schenectady on May 11, 1877.

Orr, '15 'Publication Offic~ The New-Hes-Mor Printing Co., Schenectady Railway Waiting Room Building, 420 State Street ~n <Qlreat ~~sf£m at ~ttion THE CoNCORDIENSIS has always considered itself the students' organ of speech. It has always endeavored to point out defeGts and suggest methods of improvement .for our college life, but has never done so through any love of criticism. We now beg to suggest the advisability of adopting the No Treat System. Such a system has been in vogue for a brief time at Cornell and is working admirably. Why cannot we take a stand in fay-or or such a beneficial movement? This system insists that no man shall treat a fellow student, but that every man pay for his own drink. We might seem to be attempting to encourage drinking, esp~cially in party form. Not _so! But since the evil (lo-es exist we cannot overlook it. We urge the adoption of the system for several reasons, but mainly because it will tend to do away with excessive imbibing. A man will not drink so much when he is buying his own drinks.. This is known to be a fact by people who have tried it, and their convictio11 is that the No Treat System will moderate though not extirpate the indulging in· intoxicants. =

THE ,CONCORDIENSIS It doubtless will be an advantage to the students who have not very much money at their disposal. The \setting up\ for the crowd is done away with as well as· the necessity of the return treat, and a man may take what he wishes and then stop without being a '\quitter'' as is the case some· times at present. The men who do not drink at a~l can come together for the celebrating, .after the victories on the campus, without feeling out of place and need have no fear of losing the name of \good fellows\ for joining in the spirit though not in the spirits. Naturally this will increase the social side of college life and will accomplish it in a mild way ; and though good fellowship and drinking are closely allied in most peoples' minds we offer the adoption of the No Treat System as a means of regulating and moder- ating drinking without necessarily lessening the good fellowship but rather augmenting it. ~lhan~ ijlrip for ~sfrriuom~ Qllttss Again we beg to offer a suggestion. Ottr suggestion is one that may interest the class in astronomy. It is .. not ·ap attempt to find fault with the present course of instruction but rather is a plan suggested for the purpose of adding more interest to the study of astronomy. We believe it would be a good idea for the class to make a trip to the Dudley Observatory in Albany. Here are the best instruments available and with them the planets , ' and heavenly bodies, the conception of which may before have been .. vague, · would become real. It would be combining practice with theory and the impressions made upon the students would be more vivid. Most of the men taking the course are probably entirely unfamiliar with the construction of telescopes and such instruments not to mention the appearance of .celestial phenomena. It would be the means of the students acquiring a consider- able store of general knowledge and the subject would quickly become more interesting. It .can hardly be denied that at the observatory where the heavenly bodies are clearly visible a greater amount of knowledge would be obtained in a few minutes than could be gained in .several lectures. Again this trip would make the course more attractive and would serve as a splendid advertisement for it. Moreover Dudley Observatory is a part of Union University and there is no reason why we shouldn't derive some benefit from the use of it People in Albany, and indeed from greater distances, pay frequent visits there and find it well worth the while and why shouldn't we, who. are nearby and especially interested in astronomy, grasp this most favorable opportunity? 11

,. ,, I• 12 THE; ·cOiNCORDIENSIS ~=======~============================~~============================~~==========~= HISTORY OF TERRACE COUNCIL - 'HH~--- --~ Change in Election to Mem-bership ;Honorary So~iety Founded in 1906 Which Has Steadily Incr-eased 'lts Influence In the spring 0f 1906, several members of the senior el'ass decided. to organize a senior society. It was to be an honor society and its purpose was to show the appreciation of the class to those who had worked bard for the colleg-e during their course, by electing them members of it. First Council Members The class held the first election in April and the following fifteen men were chosen: Casler, Chapman, , .• l Last year the question of election to membership. arose.. It was. decided that the Council, itself, should elect four :men, the senior class two men and the senior class president should make the seventh mem. ber. Aims of Society Though the purpose of the Council has been changed considerably since its foundatiQn in: 1906 it has always been a means of fostering coHegespirit, of serving as a meditator between. the faculty and the students, of supervising and regulating college cus- toms. and of looking after the general welfare of Union locally and in the college world. PRESENT TERRACE COUNCIL Cook, Dann, Hagar, Invrie~ King, Moon, Nutt, Peebles, Putman, Reed, Rider, Vedder and Waldron. Name of Terrace Council Adopted It was these members who finally decided to call the new society the Terrace Council. The men elected choose seven men from the class of 1907. From then until 1911, four men have been elected· by the Coun- cil and the remaining three by the senior class. Insignia Selectea Immediately after the first meeting of the members, a pin was chosen. It was patterned after one of the stones in the terrace wall and on it were the letters T. C. This pin b.as h~wever, been discarded and a watch fob' of rough silver has been put in its place. It is oval in shape and has a cut of the Idol and the words Terrace Coencil on it. Attempts To Show Originalty Besides regulating customs the Council also en~ deavors to start new customs and promulgate new ideas such as will be beneficial to the college. 1\1emhership a Gecided Honor Membership on this Council is granted only to those who are most loyal to Union and who are 1nost capable of toiling for her best interest . Election to this executive and honorary body is one of the great~ est honors that can be bestowed upon a junior and, of course, is a position coveted by most of the more popular and ambitious members of the class. The present Terrace Council men are: T. A. Fairbairn, president; J. E. Riley, J. H. Potter, H. A. ?chermer- horn, C. L. Hequembourg, H. N. Trumbull, B. B. Webb.

Nevertheless, in spite of the unpleasant weather and, a rather small character and his whole life, Cavert, '10, in concluding the discussion gave an outline of what the ten days vacation at Northfield is like, and said that Northfield had ·meant so nntch to him. that he could think of no other thing in connect- attendance, there w·as a great deal of Northfield en- . ion with his college course that had been of so much th11siasm. evidenced. 'The six ,students who spoke on \'What Northfield H'as Meant to Me\ told of the Stu- dent Conference in such enthusiastic terms that there was a general impression that an eve-nt which had meant so much in the lives of other college men ought not to be overlooked. The first speaker, Faust, '15, said that although he had heard much about Northfield he had never half realized what a wonderfur p~ace it was until after he had gone· there tast year. He valued most the new conception that the Conference had given him of the reality of Christian lives. Ennis, '14, said that last year he went to Northfield not knewing much about it, but thinking that he would \take a chance on it\. He s.poke of the good-; fellowship of the place, the new ideals that he had received there, and the won~ • derful spirit that on comes into contact with there. It had meant so much t0 him last year that he was going again this summer. Bates, '13, had found that the main value of North- field to him had been that it was an \eye-opener\ a 1d had set him to dGing some thinki'ng for himself about . the greatest things in life. In fact, it had meant so much that he wanted all the fellows· in college to go and to find out for themselves what a great place Northfield is. Macmillan, '12, sp()ke especially of the wonderful vacation that Northfield had afforded him, the ath- letics, the out-door life, the college spirit, the all- around good time in such an atmosphere of manly Christian living that a fellow felt that his life was stronger as a result of having been there.

THE CONCORDIENS1S 9 M:R. ·OWEN JOHNSON'S PRIZE OFFER There is perhaps no question in education more vital and more discussed than the problem of the social organization of the university and college. Each university in its social system has features of excel- lence and features open to criticism, due sometimes to local causes, ·often to an evolution from economic lack of dormitories and dining halls. At every university, among the faculty; the trustees, and especially the older alumni, is a quickened sense of the need of pro- gression and correction due to loyalty, to a perception of the :overshadowing importance of thorough and in- spiring education and a mote sympathetic and in- forming democracy. At Harvard, Freshma~ dormitories are being plan- ned to augment the excellent democratic influence of the Harvard Union; at Princeton, great reforms have been accomplished in the Freshman and Sophomore eating clubs, and the bringing of those classes as in. tegral bodies into a common dining hall; at Yale, the S1phomore societies have been abolished and the ]ul1ior societies increased anJ. the beginning of a scholarship test has been put in force, while the 1ninor details of the visible fonns of the Senior Secret Society- System are under important discussion. The extraordinary thing is that here, where the social organization plays so important a part, it has developed in a dozen different forms. There are four distinct variations: The closed clubs of Harvard, the open clubs of Princeton, the Senior Society system of Yale, and the general fraternity system of the State un: versities and the s1nc:ll colleges such as Amherst, Williams, and Wesleyan. Beyond these four distinct manifestations are innumerable combinations and 1 )Cal evolutions. Believing that a mutual knowledge of the merits and defects of the systems in vogue, as well as the ar- guments pro and con, would be of larger public in_ terest and service, I should like to propose through your columns a competition for the best construct ive plan for the social organization of a university or college. I shall be very glad to offer a prize of $150 for that paper which shall be adjudged the best sub- mitted by an undergraduate, and $100 for the best paper from a graduate. There will be not the slightest limitation to the nature of the plan submitted, except of its possible effectiveness in the safeguarding of education and democrqcy. I hope that strong papers may be submitted in be- half or all existing systems, (with suggested improve- ments in the matter of detail,) and that equally- there may be plans submitted for an entirely d i:fferent sys- tem of division, as wdl as plans that would argue for no systems at an. The manuscripts shoul:l b~ submitted in typewritten form and signed by a noin de guerre, tbe real name being inclosed in a separate envelope.. In any case where, for obvious reasons, a contributor does not de- sire to reveal his identity, his preference will be con.., sidered, even in the event of his winning, the prize. The competition wiU dose June 2, and the an- nouncement of the winners will be ,made in the Sun- day Times of June 9. I am glad to announce that the Hon.. Otto T. Ban- nard, Mr. Norman Hapgood, and Prof. Henry Fair· field Osborn have generously contributed their ser· vices and will act ail a jury. From tiiDe to time, as the answers warrant it, The Times will publish them during the pr<>gress of the competition. OWEN JOHNSON.

This will be a novel event and a thoroughly interesting one especially t() the older residents of the city, though it appears impossible to conceive hovr anyone can possibly be dis- interested in such an attractive affair. Stra11gely enough such seems the case, and the fault is centered mainly upon the students. Most of us have been inclined to evidence a lack ()f interest. A call was issued for thirty= five Indians. To this first call the men on t:h€ hill paid no heed. A second summons for braves was sent out and a few men condescended to answer the call of duty. These men are deserving of credit, but what shall we say of those who can well give up part of their time and yet lack the spirit to do so? Perhaps they dori'~ realize that this is their pageant-their pageant inasmuch as it is for the benefit of the new Union gymnasium. For what nobler an object should the students make sacrifices? When it was a question of financial support for the 11,ew gytnn the response was almost phenomenal, why now this sudden waning of interest?

'THE CONC'OI-<DIENSIS 11 -==-====~~======= ============================~=== Too busy is probably the excuse of the majority. This is a common fault with college men, but then ·~Oesn't €very man take some recreation each day? Surely some diversion must be sought by even the busiest students, and here is the most pleasant sort of a diversion that could be desired. What reason can be advanced then for not seeking it in th:is profitable and loyal manner? Why no~ lend our support to make the pageant a success. There are many position yet to be filled, come out and fill one! We shall derive the benefits from it, shall we then allow someone else to do all the work? ·~·~ ~~ Jlri~£ 0Cnmp£titinu fnr ~uinu 4ittt Possibly some of the students who are in the habit of reading the New York Times were attracted by an article which appeared in Sunday's College Section. It was an ofier by Mr. Owen Johnson of Yale, auth():r of \Stover ·Of Yale\ to start a prize competition among college graduates and undergraduates for the best constructive plan for the social organization of a university. Mr. Johnson considers the social organization a problem of paramount interest, and one about which all college men should have strong feelings and rath ~r well defined views. Assuming that this is true, he has deemed that the best plan for improvement along this line, condng from an undergraduate should receive a prize of one hundred and fifty dol- lars, while a plan from a graduate should receive a hundred dollars. Doubtless Mr. Johnson is correct in maintaining that this social problem · is a vital one. It may come home more forcibly to the men in the larger institutions of Yale, Harvard and Princeton yet we can feel that the question is one that does affect us here at Union also. Union stands for democracy, has always stood for it and we hope it ever shall. It was founded on prin- ciples of that sort and its ,name is suggestive of this policy. · Yet in spite of traditions and principles the question of social democ- racy will assert itself. Our Monday college meeting, our terrace songs and the size of our institution are conducive for promoting a feeHng of equality. B·ut still this so-called class distinction is bound to ~orne into evidence) and we desire to caU the students' attention to the fact that fhere is room for improvement on democratic lines here at Union and the fact that this is so gives any man on the hill some splendid data to enter Mr. - Johnson's cotnpetition and suggest a plan of improvement. The conditions of the contest appear in _this week's issue of THE CoNCORDIENSIS. Such an effort on the part of any undergraduate would ~ertainly have a broadening effect personally, and it would be of great benefit to Uni()n to have one of her sons join in the contest and perhaps have his article pr-inted in the Times or even be the successful competitor.

The operation was deferred for over a week because of a high fever '\Vhich had set in, but .when this had abated so1newhat the doctors thol!ght best to act at once. Mr. Vroman apparently went through the operation successfully and was get- ting along so splendidly that his father was permitted. HAROLD STANTON VROMAN to leave for home believing his son past all danger On Friday Mr. Vroman had a sinking spell from which he was unable to recover and passed away at eleven o'clock. He was -vvell known and liked on the hill, and the freshman class as well as the Delta Phi fraternity feel great sorrow at his loss. He had just been elected a member of the Concordiensis Board and was doing excellent work on the publication. His home is in Middleburgh, N. Y. The following resolutions have been drawn up by his classmates: Whereas, God Almighty in his providential way, has seen fit to take from us our late fellow member, Harold 8tanton Vroman, and Whereas, this affliction will fall most heavily on his · bereaved family, be it therefore Resolved, that it is but a just tribute to the memory of our Departed Member to say that regarding his re- moval from us we mourn for one who was in every w'ay worthy of our greatest respect and esteem. Resolved, that by the death of our classmate we have lJst a true friend, a gentlemanly associate and a leading member of the clas~. Resolved, that we sympathize deeply with the family of the deceased in their bereavement, which it bas pleased the Ahnighty to inflict upon them, and be it further Resolved, that a letter of condolence be sent to the family of the deceased. Resolved, th~t our heartfelt sympathy be extended to the Delta Phi fraternity in the loss of one of their n1embers, and be it further Resolved, that this testimonial Qf our sympathy and our sorrow be forwarded to the Delta Phi fraternity, and that these resolutions be published in THE CON- CORDIENSIS, and a copy be kept with the records of the class of 1915.

In fact, so firm has the grip of it was necessary that new members be elected.

Roy Fin- 1 'Y, T~eodore Haniga::1, Don Kin~ Hutchens, Robert ·La Barron, Van Rensselaer Tre1nper. At the. meeting :h cld Friday evening, ,May third, Robert P. Patterson, '12, read a paper entitled: Studies in the Georgics of Vergil. Mr. Patterson's remarks were largely on the poet's ideas regarding nature. The me1nbers fully appreciated the paper and one of the club spoke of the essay as \comprehensive detailed, and in every way commendable.\ Mayor George R. Lunn was the speaker at the :Black Cat meeting, May tenth. His subject was Social- ism. He believed that capitalism is a worn out sys- tem, and must fall as feudalism fell. The mayor ex- plained briefly the rise of combination; admitted its advantages; and showed that the profits go to trust COMMENCEMENT REUNION PLANS TO BE COMPLETED SOON At Commencement this year, the classes of '72, '77, '82, '87, '92, '97, '02, '07 and '09 are to hold reunions. Each of these classes is working through a committee to make this the best reunion the class has ever held. None of the classes has yet made definite arrange- ments concerning costumes, etc., ~xcept 1902, which is to march in the parade on Alumni Day as sailors. One other class is considering the costume of ballet girls but has not made final arrangements. All the lans will be completed in about a week. tator. The poor man, when unable to secure employ- ment, is locked up for vagrancy. If work is secured, v~:ages arc determined. by a man's necessity. A man must give his services at starvation wages, for if he refuses to work for p:ractically no compensation, an- other man is ever ready to take his place. The Social- ist remedy for these evils is government ownership of natural resources. The mayor then recommended a few books on Socialism. He concluded his remarks by noting tha~ the Socialist strength lies in the working class; the college Socialist's duty is to guide his less informed brothers in the right path. The Buffalo Club bas been making preparations for sub-fresnman day. It has decided to present a silver cup to the Buff3:lo student n1aking the highest number of points.

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS FAMED SO:N.S OF OLD UNION William Henry Seward The class of 1820 has in its roll a name as great in the political history of this country as that of Tayler Lewis on the pages of scholastic fatne. William Henry Seward was a statesman whose works have left a great impression. Seward was born in the little town of Florida,. Orange Co. Of his boyhood little is known. In Dr. Hale's biography we read that he was attracted to Unio:n College by the great and growing reputation of its president, EHpha:let Nott, and while here received from Dr. Nott something of the stamp of character that remained with him through life. While at Union he was an active member of the Adelphic Society, then an important college institution. In his junior year he was elected to membership in Phi Beta Kappa. Seward ran away from college in his senior year, but returned the next year and received his degree in 1820. In 1823 he began to practice law in Auburn, N. Y., and gradually gained prominence in pol: tical affz..iL. Seward's political career was long, and his activities in this line were manifold. In 1830 he was elected state senator. In 1836 he was the unsuccessful can- didate for governor on the Whig ticket. Two years later the Whig party in the state was stronger and this time Seward wa3 elected governor; two years later he was re-elected. In 1849 he became United States senator. By this tin1e he was prominent throughout the country, and in 1860 was an unsuc- eessful candidate for the Republican nomination for president against Lincoln. However President Lincoln chose Seward as his Secretary of State. Throughout th~ Civil War Secretary Seward rendered invaluable aid to Lincoln both in domestic affairs and in the set- tlement of foreign affairs with England and France. William H. Seward will be remembered longest as the ad vocate of the purchase of Alaska. In the face of violent opposition he took up negotiations with Russia, and, practically on his own initiative, bought this ter- ritory for seven million dollars. His wisdom and far- sightedness are. now evident; Seward's action has been vindicated, and Alaska is pouring forth great wealth. In 1869 Seward concluded his services as Secretary of State, and the following year made a trip around the world, meeting in a semi-official way the great statesmen of the nations of the world. On October lOth Seward died at Auburn. E. L. Baker, '14, acted as news editor for this issue of THE CONCORDIENSIS. DR. WILLIAM M. SLOANE CHOSEN HO:NORAR Y CHANCELI..;OR President RichmoJ:?:d has announced that Profess 0 r William M. Sloane; A. M., Ph. D., L. H. D., LL. ]), of Columbia University, will act as honorary chaneel1 0 r at Commencement this year. Professor Sloane is. the Kaiser Wilhehn Exchange Professor of the Universi,ty of Berlin for the present year. He has a remarlcable record of attainment and is one of the men very :high in his profession, He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters~ Chevalier de Ia Le_gion de Honneur and of other learned societies. He wHl deliver the chancellor's address at the Commen:ce- ment exercises. ~ SENIO:R CLASS SO·NG Our labors now are finished here And past are the joys as well Beneath these gray walls that we each revere And the charms of their mystic spell For Pheobus' steeds do not stay their pace Though fain we would linger still And to others must be resigned the place That we no more can :fill So let us join in song Now as we gather here Beneath the sheltering walls Of Alma Mater dear As into lifes' highway We are about to delve We pledge ourselves to be ever sin.cere To Union and nineteen twelve Forever the years that may come Shall render a value high To memory's tablets that graven stand In the shrine of these years passed by And the precious records inscribed thereon Nor dimmed nor erased shall be But a fairer luster shall grace each one And deeper solemnity And many the themes that they bear Triumphant, mirthful and glad But nothing of bitterness enters there And nothing is harsh nor sad And many are witness of victories That honored old Union's name Where our stalwart champions strove and won A fair highway to fame Presently as we pass and go To near or to distant fields Our constant fraternal unity Steadfastness and courage yields For friendships unfaltering loyalty Has forged with masters art A bond which the vandal hand of time Can never force apart ~ fE~k~ dot Accorno --- E~ Among field thi to go distance, part ·of t to the ning oiJ Commet {let this <::> .Associ a both N< EaglE 1

The Concordiensis ---------- VOL. 35. MAY 23, 1912 No. 25 Union 15, N. Y. U. 8 'Garnet T earn D.evelops Exceptional Batting Streak and Rolls Up Big Score-O'Keefe P~itches Winning Game and Adds Many Strike Outs to His Credit-N. Y. U. Loses Nerve in Sixth Inning and T earn Goes to Pieces In a game featured by heavy hitting, and numerous errors on the part of N.Y. U., Union easily disposed of her rivals last Sat- nrday by the score of fifteen to eight. Union was never in danger after the fourth :inning when she jumped into the lead by a margin of four runs. Lucky Sixth The sixth inning was by far the most eventful, for after two men had been put out by N. Y. U., the Garnet team ran wild and secured seven runs before the final put out. Shaw -vvho was first up was an easy out, his fly being captured, Giddings fol- iowed with a grounder, which was quickly picked up and thrown to first. O'Keefe then made his second hit and Captain Bis~ che followed with a two bagger. Dunn hit a grounder to -short which was poorly fielded allowing Shaw, who was running, for O'Keefe and Bische to score. Naumann walked, forcing Dunn. Fairbairn then filled the bases with a slow grounder. Hutchens walked, forcing Dunn. Dennis sent a single to right field, bringing in Naumann and Fairbairn. Shaw then made a pretty hit into left field, sending in Hutchens and Dennis. Giddings, the last man up, was out on an easy fly. N. Y. U. Dispirited This poor showing completely disgusted Capt. Nixon and in fact the entire N.Y. U. team and from this point they played under a disadvantage. Star Playing For Union, Capt. Bische starred, driving out five hits and fielding in faultless style. For N.Y. U., Brennan also a first baseman did good work, being responsible for four of his team-mates' runs by making two three base hits. Union Uses Substitutes After having safely tucked away the game Capt. Bische made numerous substi- tutions. O'Keefe and Hutchens were re- placed by Smith and Gilbert. Cote played left field and Barclay took Dennis' place in right field.

'Sub Fresll~ma .. n Day a iDistinct Success in Every Respect Interscb:()lastic Day was a tremendGus success. Tlte sub-freshmen began to ar- rive Frida-, ~evening and by noon Saturday, the camptts was filled wjth them. The day began wifb fhe Moving Up exercises iu the chapel. Bere the seniors first ·appeared in caps and ,gowns. After the usual services, the senier:s left their seats and marched around tne ~cnapel singing their class-song .. After marclling once ar()und, the Terrace Council s-tepped out and the juniors then left their seats and took up the march around th~ chapel. As the juniors passed the Terrace Council eacll time, one junior was picked for next ' council. Hartley years Dewey, Charles Male, David Finley and Don Hutchens were the four men chosen .. When these bad been selected, the \ . JUntors, sophomores and freshmen moved to the Hartley Dewey seats previously occupied by the next higher class. The exercises were brought to an end with the painting of the Idol by the two lower classes. Everyone adjourned to the back of Washburn Hall and with much Charles Male ceremony, the freshmen and sophomores gave the Idol a new coat of paint-white, this time, to signify that at last 1914 and 1915 were at peace with each other .. Directly after the painting of the Idol, the first events of the interscholastic track

' meet were started. Seventeen schools, wece represented by eighty-five men. NicnQ]s school of Buffalo sent twenty -two men, six- teen of whom competed. The Nichols schooili start~d off strong and David Finley they did not let up until they had forty-two points to their credit, fourteen points ahead of Schenectady high school which was second and thirty-two points ahead of Qg- Don Hutche::s densburg which was third.

The basketball quintet moTe iban atoned for its mishaps by striking a winning pace that was unique but which soon became a fixed character- istic of the team for the remainder of the season and novv the baseball squad has made go()d after its temporary :lack of form and snap. :Surely these three incidents are evidence in fa-vcr of the old ])roverb that history repeats itself. It is 'general knowl- edge and belief that any and every athletic team has its '~off days\. \Hit the toboggan'\ is the popular way of stating it. We have D R. Lunn claims that history doesn't re- peat itself, but in spite of this authori. tative op1n1on it appears that historical repetitions do frequently occur. We make this statement upon the basis of Union's athletic repetitions. Our basketball team commenced the season in a winning man- ner and then slipped back into a rut losing several games. Our foctball team · had a similar experience, and this is exactly the predicament of our baseball nine. We be- gan the season with a victory but then fell victims to our next three opponents. Yet

. . . d·' '' ff .. d \ n.d· are we now experience·· our :o·• · ·ays a!-\·· ' ···, ·. hope, back: in good condition again, ready to turn the remaining games into victories. The contest with New York University was indeed a marked success. The coach may feel assured of the future since the recent decided victory wiU serve as an impetus to further g~ory. Another incentive is the pennant which at present floats from the Union backstop. Champions For The Season 1911 is a fair group of words for the proud Union gradu- ates and undergraduates to behold as they come on the ~ampus. It certainly makes our opponents feel as though they must play to the best of their ability for they are to do battle with the strongest team in the State ·Collegiate League. This same pennant ought to arouse a feel- ing not only of pride but ambition in our nine. Their ideal ought to be to retain the trophy, to keep it waving over the garnet field for another season. True we have seemingly made a bad beginning but as the unfortunate spell is broken why may we not assume the old motto \Let bygones be bygones\ and struggle from now on with all our mig:1t and n11in to keep the cham- pionship flag right here for another year? · O.f course such exhortation may be out of plc:ce, it surely would not be necessary if we always were prompted by true Union spirit. But then, defeat almost always means a decrease in enthusiasm and soon we find ourselves prone to criticise. Fault finding is seldom justifiable in athletics and should therefore be carefully guarded against. If we could realize that the men on the team feel a defeat much more keenly than those who are ever prompt with adverse criticism we should have fewer objections to offer. 11 NEW COURSE IN FORESTRY ·-··-· -·. QOUBTLESS many of the men on the · · · hill are not yet aware of the unusual opportuni~ty available to them of taking a practical course in forestry. This course bas just been instituted and is meeting with marked success as far as it has already progressed. The men pursuing it speak of the pleasure and advantages they feel in being able to distinguish the numerous varieties of trees right on our coUege cam- pus not to refer to those scattered in many other interesting localities. This study as taken up by Dr. Stoller is acknowledged to be very heipful, interesting and at the same tirn.e rather distinctive from many other courses open to students. The privi- lege of enjoying this course is extended to Ph. B. juniors and B. S. sophomores, and as it is now time to file elections for the com- ing year we feel it is especially apropos to direct the students' attention upon a new elective course. u TRACK TEAM TRIP TO ROME ·THE students have now an exceptional opportunity to show their spirit and loyalty for Union. There is an urgent need of sending our track tean1 to the Inter- collegiate meet at Rome, May 30. The regular track money has been expended, as is generally the case, on the two big meets of the season and there is no further financial support forthcoming. Sometimes the alumni lend their assistance but as their aid has been spent elsewhere this year the question of whether or not the team goes to Rome must be answered by the students. Never was the track team in better con- dition than at present, never were our prospects of victory -brighter. it will be a decided gain for Union to be represented and this is not possible unless the men on the hill subscribe a fair amount of money. This is not a tax and is not compulsory, it is merely a test of your feeling for the college.

'• On Thursday evening, May 17th,' the College Band held its first annual election in Silliman Hall. The result was as follows; Leader, Chas. T. Male, '13. President, D. R. Finley, '13. Vice-Pres., W. A. Mudge, '14. Treas., W. C. Vosburgh, '14. Secretary, R. A. Orr, ''15. During the past few weeks the band has been working on several new pieces, most of which are for the pageant. It will play a prominent part in helping along this good work for the new gym. Some new horns are expected soon, and candidates are requested to learn them in order to keep up the number in the band which will be decreased by graduation. Last Concert of Season Held In Schenectady High Sthool The Musical Clubs gave the last concert of the season in the high school auditorium on Tuesday night. The concert was with- out doubt one of the finest the clubs have held this year. After the concert, the fel- lows adjourned to Silliman HaH where an informal reception and good time were held.

i ;: ! ,. !' '• . \ ~ .: ' i' ,, ·'' 1~ ' l , ' ·,· '. ,, !J• ·, THE CONCORDIENSIS Chester Alan Arthur Chester Alan Arthur, twenty-first presi- dent of the United States, was born at Fairfield, Vermont, on October '5, 1830. In 1845 he entered Union College. It is said that young Arthur was remarkably popular at college, and was prominent in 1ds schol- astic work, being graduated with high honors in 1848. After graduation he at- tended law school, and in 1853 entered as a partner in a law firm in New York City. Among his important earlier cases was the so-called \Lemmon Slave Case\ in which he was successful, and which settied for- ever the question as to the right of a slave- holder to take slaves into the State of New York. Tbe remarkable service of organizing and equipping oveJ:- seven hundred thous- and soldiers for the Civil War, was per- formed by Arthur in his capacity ()f quar- ter-master general of New York. Among other public offices entrusted to Chester A. Arthur at this time were those of inspector general and collector of customs for the port of New York. For several years also he practiced law, but the call of public life brought him forward again. In 1880 Ches- ter A. Arthur wc:s nominated fer the vice- presidency on the Republican ticket which James A. Garfield headed. The Republicans carried the ccuntry, andArthurwas elected vice-president. But it was destined that this Union College graduate was to rise higher. On July 2, 1881, President Garfield was shot by the assassjn Guiteau, and died September 19, when Arthur became presi- dent. President Arthur's administration was nJt eventful, but dignifie1 and wise. He was a president who gave evidence of loyalty and patriotism throughout. Presi- dent Arthur did much to check the systen1 of political removals, introduced in Jack- son's time, by which the smallest sub- ordinate places· were distributed ··as a re- ward for po~itical service. The Civil Ser- vice Act of 1883 began the movement toward the abolishment ·Of the ·''Spoils Sys- tem\ and the establishment of, competitive tests for government positions. President Arthur recommended a better plan of governing the Indian tribes and more strin ... gent laws concerning polygamy in Utah. He also opposed extravagance in appro- priations, especially the river and harbor bills of 1882, which he vetoed, and for which act he was greatly commended. Early in his administration Chester A. Arthur said: \My sole ambition is to enj:oy the confidence of my countrymen\. He will be remembered both for what he did and for what he refrained from doing. President Arthur died suddenly of apo- plexy on November 18, 1886, in New York City. CHAt'NCEY H.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS Union Loses Game To Rutgers By 10- ~ Score Garnet Team Not in Usual Form, Making Seven Errors Which Prove Costly--Splen- did Fielding of Rutgers Robs Union of Many Hits In a warmly contested game in which the score does not tell the true story' union suffered defeat at the hands of Rutgers Sat- urday afternoon. After a close game the day previous with Michigan, the Nevv Jer- sey players were out for Union's scalp and the score is much in evidence of no great disappointment to Rutgers. Union Changes Pitchers Smith started the game with Tasker at the receiving end. By a score of errors, hits and a most unfortunate decision at home, three runs were piled up with only one man down. Dunn relieved Smith but was unable to check the avalanche for two more innings but held the game well in hand during the remaining six innings. Rutgers scoring only once during that period. Garnet Scores in Third Inning Union's two runs came through a combi- nation of hits by Dennis and Hutchens in the ·third and later a score on Naumann's and Biche's hits in the seventh. Union hit hard throughout the game but Rutgers field was invincible. In the last six innings Dunn pitched well and his s~pport during that time was nearly errorless, the game ended Rutgers 10, Union 2.

Coach Dawson called the roll of the list posted, only about half of the men posted responded. The coach was very much surprised at this, as he could not understand why the men did not report. He said he had heard a lot about Union spirit and had hoped to see some of it displayed by a large number of men turning out. He strongly urged the fellows to get after the men who were not present. He briefly outlined the work for the team and impressed on them the importance of get- ting into shape during the summer. All prospective football men were requested to get a copy of the new rules.

Whether she will be a university or merely a colle..g.e will be decided in a few years. Most Union men are aware that the J>roposition o:f uniting the Albany depart- ments more closely to the college proper in Schenectady is one of foremost interest just at this time. It is rather difficult to view the matter from the standpoint of the Union college student or of the old Union graduate be- cause their ideas will be prejudiced by fond · memories of old college days in Dorp. But put aside sentiment, forget your jolly old s2at of stone, the grey old walls so dear and judge the issue from the stand- point of its being for Union's good and be- cause the decision may determine her future. Sentiment doesnrt mean so much after all unless there is some strong finan-· cial support back of it, and if this powerful aid is not forthcoming our institution may have a vital problem to solve. Let us on the other hand look at the proposition as the Albany men see it and try to assume a fair minded attitude. The city of Albany is an excellent place for a university because it is centrally located, is the state capitol and far sur-

:: - ur so ld- oe- 1er lCh an-· ful 1ay at ~ it ace ally sur- •, '' THE CONCORDIENSIS li passes Schenectady for educationa1 ad- vantages with its large and complete libraries.. The people of Albany are eager to have a college in their midst and will support it and take more pride in it than the people in the average coUege town. Now this eagerness on their pa~t wiU be the means of a university being founded in Albany in a few years' time and when this occurs our departments, the Law School the Medical 'College, the CoHege of Phar- macy and the Dudley Observatory will soon be incorporated in this new institution. Can Union afford to lose these branches and become a small college on the banks of the Mohawk? We aren't too large now and with this loss we may gradually be- come smaller and smaller. Then this new institution will be a strong rival to Union and will hurt it in numerous ways. It will receive state help which 111ight be given to us if we removed to Albany. Now the question is, shall the college proper go to Albany or shall the Albany Department come to Schenectady. The Albany men say we must go over there be- cause they simply can't come to Schenec- tady. Their arguments are very pertinent -almost impertinent in some respects. The law and medical colleges would lose Albany with its librari€s, hospitals and citi- zens, they would lose nearly their entire faculty by changing and these instructors which are the leading men in their respect- ive professions could not possibly be re,. placed by equally proficient men in Sche- nectady or indeed in almost any other city. Remember their instructors are profes- sional men practicing in Albany who give only a portion of their time to lecturing. Consider also that the Albany schools are very old institutions, each with a rem:trk- able history equal to that of Union. The ]aw school has had many a graduate on the Supreme ·Court bench, has had sever2.l United States presidents and is still turning out graduates of high character. This school gets 33 1-3 per cent. more of its stu- dents through the bar exams than any other law school in the state. The other departments have made equally remarkable records but space pre- vents us from rehearsing then1, the point is, is not their claim stronger than any ~ 7 e can offer for the university's being situated in Schenectady? Possibly there are engineering advan- tages, yet the General Electric Company is not of s~ much importance as is sometimes thought, and intercourse need not he greatly strained by a few miles' removal Bring the classical courses to Albany any- way, for these work in harmony with the Albany departments and both may then enjoy the libraries and the many common advantages. There are just as pleasant sites in Albany for a campus as our present location and many of these sites overlook the river. The college property in Sche- nectady is still valuable and the college need suffer no financial loss by removaL The grey old walls are still dear but they have done service for many a year, and are not so beautiful to people in general as to Union men. Now an agitation for new buildings for the Albany schools is being started and the time for reflecting carefully upon this mat- ter is ripe, therefore the sooner we can come to a decision the better, only we should remember that we ought to consider Union's welfare rather than our own senti- ment. If any Union men have opinions on this subject and wish to express the same TIIE CoNCORDIENSIS will be pleased to receive and print the same just as far as possible.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS Famed Sons of Old Union Cnailes Emory Smith Charles Emory Smith was born in Man- field, ·Connecticut, on February 12, 1842. His early education was in the Albany Academy. In 1857 he entered Union Col- lege; during his student days here he was remarkably active in the college interests paper had made it one of the most reliable and consistent advocates of RepublicaR principles in the country, Mr. Smith had been its guiding spirit; and his work for his party had made him one of the greatest and highest in Republican national circles. ·Charles Emory Smith died on January 27, 1908, in Philadelphia. Coeducation of that day, and was also foremost in the scholastic worlt, winning membership to Phi Beta Kappa. In 1861 Smith was grad- uated. During this period at the beginning of the Civil War:, Charles Emory Smith was appointed military secretary by General Rathbone, and in this capacity vvas instru- mental in the organization cf many New York State regiments. Later he was made judge advocate general with the rank of He started the lesson with English, A feminine gender noun, Superlatively modified- general. For a time after the Civil War, Mr. Smith was a teacher in the Albany Academy, but in 1870 gave up this professorship to c:ccept the position of editor-in-chief of the Albany \Journal\. Jn 1880 Smith was offered the editorship of the Philadelphia \Pressn one of the most influential papers of the country. He accepted, and in this capacity he ren- dered great service to the Republican party by his efforts in this paper. In 1890 Smith was appointed Minister to Russia, and he held this di};lomatic office until 1890. At this time President McKinley decided that Charles Emory Smith was the man fitted to be postmaster -general on his cabinet, and Stnith was called from Russia. This office he held until 1892 and while in this capacity did his greatest work. His tenure of office was marked by the prac- tical establishment of rural free delivery and the creation of mail service in Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines. In 1902, Mr. Smith retired from the office of postmaster-general and returned to his editorial W()rk on the Philadelphia \Press\. His work in connection with this news- The prettiest girl in town. Sociology soon taught him, Companionship is sweet From Economics he learned to make, A date for two quite neat.

General topic, \Progressive Idea in Politics.\ Scintillating Wit The trend toward instruction in the style of journalism is manifest. Schools are be- ing founded all over the country; noted journalists are advocating courses to teach this branch of writing; The Concordiensis recently spread upon its chaste pages proof that such courses are necessary and indis- pensible. The die is cast, the Rubicon is passed. So be it! But to return to the subject. To look in the pages of some of the metropolitan dailies one would think that the· only topics of interest are the edifying adventures of \Rhymo the Monk\ · or \Ignatz\ and the ever-present brick. But what of it, evi- dently it's what the people want. So why should we not institute a course to teach the elements of this sort of journalism. Evidently there's a great field open; success awaits the devotees of this style of writing. Now to illustrate our point. There is a peculiar type of humor that is sweeping the country, nay, more than peculiar. So let us give a couple of examples, it is the scin- tillating wit, humor \ne plus ultra\ that shines forth. And the best part of it is that it does not take a genius to originate them; this is why we say that there is a field op2n, even if one's style is not briliiant, diction not elegant, phrasing not superfine. Example One Mike Stiffdresser, the undertaker, was driving his hearse slowly over the bricks, leading the procession of spongers. Just as he neared a beer saloon the bartender rushed along side with a frothy seidel. Mike dove from the box and as he passed the beer man's listener, whispered dryly: If the wheel spoke with the wagon's tongue would the whiffle-tree leave. \Tangway fellows it's. the Queen.\ Example Two Oscar Bunkhauser, the millionaire con- ductor, had stopped his trolley and had planted himself on a near by street edging to separate his tin from the company's. Suddenly a bloak hitting a bench in the bow of the car softly piped: If \Morland\ was \King\ in Sweden could \ Hale\ reign.
