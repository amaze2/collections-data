WAR TOPICS TALKED OF BY PROMINENT EDUCATORS Brown President . Points Out Courses That Will Be Valu- able In Post~Bellum Life. At the beginning of his talk Prof. Bennett said a few words about money making, averring that the Christian man is not necessarily a poor man and advising his hearers to Thake money, so long as they make it lionestly. ''It is not wrong to make money,\ he said. \It is wrong- not to make it. A man should have a house and lot, a wife and children, all of which are costly, and also a College presidents and professors, . considerable balance in the bank, in common with nearly every one else, which will enable him to be a liberal are constantly talking about the war. man.

President Faunce, in addressing the B1·own students, is reported as fol- lows by the Brown Daily Herald: \I may wish you all a Happy New Year, happy in that it may bring the return of peace. No one can tell what the year will bring forth. Meanwhile every man must do his bit right at cause.\ \Make money,\ he continued, \but make it cleanly. Use it well and set not your heart upon it. The love of money is not the root of all evil but it is the source of m1..1ch good. Pov- erty causes more evil than money. Even moderate poverty impoverishes character. It is not necessary to be poor in order to be a Christian.\ The speaker then passed to his t~ting the short pass, close students I The coal shortage in Wi~li~U:stown of the game should have every op- last week approached a crrs1s and a portunity to compare the different meeting was held Saturday afternoon styles.

THE CONCORDIENSIS takes ad- vantage of this day, on which the Service Flag of the college is unfurled with appropriate patriotic observ- ances, to make tardy but none the less admiring recognition of the mem- bers of its Board who relinquished their college life to serve their country. The Day of Prayer. thrmag-h the leadership of our edu- cated men, the couliltry may he led well and wisely through all the dangers that surround it, against all the foes that menace its well-being. Our Prayer Day this year is domin- ated by thoughts of war and peace,; of glory and defeat, of life an.d death .. We cannot but have uppermost in our minds the thought of those that have gone from our midst to hardship, suf- fering, perhaps even death, all for the honor of our country and the safety of the world. This is a day when we most strongly .feel the unusual con- ditions we are in and think with some regret, surely, of those who were here at last year's Day of Prayer, but who are now making ready for days, every one of which will be a Day of Prayer to them, a prayer for strength, en- Union Theological Seminaf·y Broadway at I 20th Street New York City The charter requires that, \Equal Priv- ileges of admission and instruction, with all the advantages of the Institution, shall be allow·ed to Students of everv denomination of Christians\.

They believe that the educated man should hold in his heart a love of religion and of teachings that cannot but uplift and ennoble his soul, his in- tellect, his entire being.

Dr. Cady is a member of the Royal Geographical Society and one of the best living authoTities on the Holy l Land. He is undoubtedly the most famous living explorer, who is a Union graduate. He isalso one of the first white men of modern time,s to visit the Dead Sea and the sur- rounding country.
