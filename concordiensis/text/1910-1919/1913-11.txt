:! The Concordiensis VOL. 37 NOVEMBER 7, 1913 NO.5 THE JC YS AND SORROWS OF THE SECTION GANG. (Pete writes some poetry for Chister Sac e.) Spud blew into the room about nine P. M. on a certain Sunday night and found, to his surprise, that his rootnmate was sitting studiously at his desk puffing away on a long-stemmed pipe, which emitted dense fumes of burning P. A. Pete's hair was ruffled up in an uncouth fashion, as if his hand had been run through it many times, and vast wads of yellow paper seemed to have sea tter.ed them selves promiscuously over the desk and upon the floor about it. Spud was awe-struck. He tiptoed softly across the room and stood behind Pete's chair, st~aling a cautious glance across his shoulder. Pete didn't budge, but stared blankly at the book which was before him, and at- ten1pted to make son1e marks on a paper with a hlunt p~ncil. \Got a knife, Spud?\ he asked, suddenly turning around. Spud never n1oved. hut with his lower ia w hang-ing loosely down on account of the shock which he had received, stood tremhling with amazement, his eyes riveted npon the book lying open on Pete's desk. In a slow frightened voice he read the first line-''Prithee, fond lover, why so pale ?\-and with a sickening groan sank into the green morris chair. Pete looked up anxiously. :'you sick, Spud?\ \No Pete, old man; are-are you in- in-in love, Pete?\ \Well I sh()uld say not!\ \Then why aU this poetry stuff? You nearly scared rne to death!\ t'You see, Spud, Chister Sace said that whoever would write a corking good piece of poetry for the tGarnette' could get out of exams. Now I don't know a darned thing about poetry, but I know a good deal less about the 'History of English Literature,' or words to that effect. Do you get me.?\ \Sure Pete., I get you, and you have my sympathy. Rave you made a start yet?\ Pete shook his head, and Spud, picking up a piece of the crumpled paper from the floor, straightened it out and read: 'tvVith apologies to E. A. Poe.\ HAh, how well I recollect, Better than you could expect, When I thoughtfully reflect T'hat dreadful night before exams.,, \Very sad, Pete, most tearfully so. I guess you ·n bave to give it up. Oh! by the way, why don't you get someone else to write it for you-someone who ha~ a

Now, Bob's a smart feHow, and if anybody in these sections can write poetry, I think it ought to be Bob.\ \You're all wrong, Spud; Bob's a fine fellow and he's good on the technical stuff, but when it comes to literature-nothing doing. It's got to be some dreamy-eyed fellow, you know the kind.\ T'here was a long silence. Pete cast his eyes upward in a thoughtful manner, as if looking for an inspiration from the clouds, \Vhile Spud buried his forehead in his cl1ubby hands. \Say said Spud suddenly, \How about }foot Nubs; he has a dreamy look in the eyes and l've heard that some of his dis- tant relatives knew a fellow whose father Jived next door to Tennyson years ago.\ \Great hunch, Spud; you're a wonder. Corr1e down in Hoot's room with me and we'll fix it all up.\ Hoot was writing a letter to his girl, but as soon as ~ete and Spud entered he ceased this laborious pursuit and welcomed them very cordially. \Say Hoot,\ Spud began, \can you write any poetry ?~' \'You see,\ put in Pete, \it's this way- I'n1 trying to get out of English exam. by writing a rhyme and its an impossibility for me, so I've come to you for a little help.\ Hoot put on an important air, and rising from his desk strutted about the rootn with one hand thrust into his pocket while the other ran~bled madly through his hair. I-I is eyes became dreatny and wandered about on the wall, as if looking for an inspitation. St,tddenly he fixed his glance on a picture and for a moment stood mo- tionless. l t was a ptcture of .: September Morn.\ After that it was easy. He sat down at his desk and wrote six stanzas of the most beautiful poetry imaginable, and folding the paper handed it to Pete, modest- ly a voiding the flowing words of praise and gratitude from the latter. Pete didn't open the paper until he got to his roo01 and pre~ a:red to ·copy it on the typewriter. \Here Spud, you ~dictate.\ The foUowing is t!lite first of six verses of the '''Ode \'to Septemb:er Morn:\ ''Sly, coquettis'll_ Httle pig thief, Hiding 'neath a.. spreading fig leaf, Like the nymph who charmed the Big Chief Of the Sioux tribe long ago ; Soon the ·cold w:ili drive thee thither, Where the greea ~eaves never wither, On ancl on w:e iltnow not whither, On to where 'tis never cold.\ Spud looked up, t~ying hard to conceal a smile. \Pete he said, \I guess you'd better take the e:xam.\ \Durn it all, Spud.,.

WHAT THE OTHER COLLEGES ARE DOING. Realizing that in order to properly train for spring track meets, Colgate has de- cided to build an outdoor board running track. This will tenable the runners to gradually work into outdoor training, which is in1 possible at the present tin1e. Col. C. P. Townsley, superintendent of the \Nest Point Academy, shows in his an- nual report that he is against the con- tinuance of foothall at the academy. \Ex- perience,\ he says, \seen1s to indicate that football is likely to produce more lasting injuries than riding or gymnastics. In vievv of the comparatively small number of cadets who play football and the very high percentage of days lost in the hospital fTotn footfall injuries to days lost in the 'hospital from all other causes during the football season-· forty-six per cent-I re- .gard it as questionable whether the value received frorn football justifies the result- . . . '' .ant tnJunes. ']'he follo\iving clipping fron1 the Colgate .. :viad\ is self-explanatory: '''The G niversity of California has struck a forvvard note in the training of students f()r n1odern citizenship. V\/ith the opening of the year, the Departn1ent of Education launched a one-unit lecture course on \The Social Aspect of the Liquor Proble1n,\ to consist of fourteen lectures, one a week, on various phases of the problem, with the personnel of the lecturers comprising pro- fessors of California and Stanford U niver- ~.ities, prorninent professional men of San Francisco, and David Starr Jordan, Chan- cellor of Stanford. The course is open to ~tudents and citizens, but credit is given only to students who attend, pass an ex- at11ination on the entire course. and write a 1,500-\vord thesis on the subject of any l-ecture. The course has proved very pop- nlar, the first lecture being attended by 152, the second by 255, with an average for the first five of 200.\ The buildings of the new gradttate col- leg·e of Princeton Cniversity were dedi- cated a week ago yesterday. President Hibben of Princeton presided, ex-President \\l. H. Taft delivered a men1orial address on Cleveland. Dean Andrew vVest of the graduate college spoke on behalf of that in- stitution. and sev~ral other prominent men delivered inspiring addresses. T'he \LTniversity of Michigan has adopted a law by which it is an offense, punishable by dismissal, to take part in any hazing during the school year. There are 5,300 students registered at the University of California.

SUNDAY VESPERS. lVIost of us know in a vague way what the College Christian Association is and what it stands for, but how n1any have any de-finite knowledge of, or interest in, that association? vVe all read in the Handbook that \the association stands for all that is best in college life,'' but how n1any of us have found out for ourselves the truth of that stateJnent It does not seetn right that an organization which represents and has an active interest in the whole college should be supported and its work carried on hv a n1ere handful of men. l\ o one will \' attempt to deny that the Y. NL C. A. is a splendid thing, but when he is asked why he does not take an active interest in it, or even a passive one, he changes the subject. 1\'he Christian Association holds a vesper service every Sunday a.fternoon. The meet- ing is well adv.ertised around college. The speakers are always good and sometimes exceptionaUy so, yet when the tin1e comes twenty, thirty or perhaps thirty-five stu- dents attend. Why is this? If the associa- tion is not worth while, why let it exist any longer? If it is of some value to the college, why not support it, at least to the· extent of attending its vesper services? The Secretary and President Story work hard to secure good speakers. They could often secure better ones, big men in the world and rnen whon1 people consider it a high privilege to hear, but if such a man does con1e to address the college he finds a 1nere handful of students, and usually the n1ajority of his audience are townspeople. Do you think such a man is likely to visit Union [again ,and give of his time and thought to perhaps thirty men from a stu .. dent body of over three hundred and fifty? Would you if you were in his place? Dr. Richn1ond has occasionally secured very pron1inent n1en to address the asso- ciation. They come expecting an. audience of several hundred. They find one con- siderably less than one hundred. T'hey feel hurt. Can you blame them? \IVhenever a n1an is announced as speak- er at an Association Vesper Service it is a sure thing that he is worth listening to. An hour spent in Sillin1an 1-Iall on Sunday afternoon is better spent, considered in a purely edncational way, than an hour ,.. '~ . ~.:

r r ,.. '~ . ~.: 'THE CONCORDIEN:SIS 13 spent in ,class. As an educationa:l organiza- tion alone, the association is well worth while. But that is only one of its secondary purposes. We all owe it to ourselves to support the Sunday vespers. Most of the students, it's a regretable fact., do not attend ,church. If that is the case, they owe it to th~mselves to at least give one hour of Suaday to the Christian Association. It cannot hurt one of us. It will help lots of us. Let's try it. We support athletics. We support other activities. Why should we n~t suppo~t the association. Give them a. larger at- tendance and they will give you more prom- inent speakers occasionally. Is it not worth a try? You owe it to the college, to the association and to yours e.Jves. Pay all your debts at one sweep. Attend the college vespers. You will find them worth while, vve can guarantee that. GYM READY JANUARY 1. Dream of Union Men at Last 1o Be Rea- lize-d After Years of Waiting. The \Gymnasium Alumnorum,\ other- wise known as the '•N ew Gym/' will be turned over by the contractors to· the Trustees on the first day of January, 19.14. Such is the authenti~ated staten1 ent. whi~h heralds the realization of one of those dreams every Union man ha~ felt since Shakespeare grad~ated. Then, frotn the 1st of January until about the- 5th, the -Board of Trustees will be· busy wit'h their broom and Dr. McCotnber's vacuum cleaner, house-cleaning for the opening- of college. A.nd-'finally the basket-ball team will prance out_ onto the court along about tlte ninth of January and christen the new· edifice from a utilitarian standpoint with-let us hope- a victory. ?uch· are· tb_e plans, which may we 11 be taken as Iinal The formal opening, with speeches and other thin.g-s, will take place on March 27th, when Madame Alma Gluck will sing in the auditorium. Students are encouraged to overcome their shyness; however, before that date and not to wait for a formal in- troduction to Miss AI umnorum before get- ting acquainted vvith her nurnerous and dazzling charms. Students, in fact, will be urged to do so at the earliest possible mo- ment. The history of the New Gym is nearly as old as Union. That is not paradox, but fact. TlJe Class of 1860 were rustling round in the old days raising funds for the New Gytn. But the Gym you ar~ now go- ing to hear about dates back to the me- morable faU term of 1908. In that year Theodore B. Brown, '98, carried the tnes- sage to college. from a number of alumni that they~ the alumni, were prepared to undertake a campaign for a gymnasium for Union. Members of the faculty, certain students, Mr. Brown and other alumni met and made plans for forming a Union Col- lege Gym n.asium Association. On Decetn- ber 4th; at college meeting, the students were. informed of the schetne. Such was the enthusiasm and so pressing did the need appear that in less than an hour near- ly nine thousand dollars had been pledged by studer1ts alone. Four classes rose to the occasion splendidly. In a few days the amount of student contributions was aln1ost ten thousand dollars. Never was there a n1or~ enthusiastic gathering in the old chapel nor one that was richer in self-sacri- ficing devotion on the. part of the student body,\ writes Dr. McComber in the Alun1ni Monthly for February, 1912. '~Such a dis- play of coUege spirit was a direct challeno-e • h to the alumn1 ... \ As I was saying, the New Gym will be open on the 1st of January. If you want a new gym, ()r a new necktie, or a high-ball, go out and challenge an Alumnus-directly,

14 TiiE CONC·ORDIENSlS mind you, d,irectly. ~Organization proceeded and the ca1npaign w.as soon in full career. Class after class- as far back as '35-swung into line, and the fun.d soon reached proportions such that de- tails of the conten1plated building could be arranged. On the tenth of June, 1913, Silas B. Brownell, '52, chairrnan of the Board of Trustees, laid the cornerstone that made Cnion's New Gymnasiun1' a reality. Work proceeded throughout the sun1n1er tnonths not only on the Gym itself, but also on the nevv Athletic Field, the g-ift of George Alex- ander, '66, till today the erection of the build- ing is con1plete, the sodding of the baseball diarnond has been finished, and the track is ready to p11t on its spring overcoat in March. The fence around the fieJ d is laid, the level- ing and drainage systen1 of the outfield is done, and it will be only a few days before IJr. ~T ac n1oves in for good. 'The gyn1 has been described to you al- rea<ly any number of times. The easiest and n1ost ~atisfactory thing to do is to take a little walk up College Lane and enter upon a touT of inspection for yourself. 'I'hen you \vill ~.ee that the building is in the same quaint style, the same cool grey, the same four-square solidity as our dearly-beloved .S<'ct ions. Yon will see the delicate reach of the arch e~ and the choiceness of its location. '(ou vv ill see it n1ore as a great new country clnh, with Turkish bath additions that Union College is soon to open up, than as an ordi- \. ,, :n cli-y- gynL Fron1 the upper porche~ you g-et a view of the- d ia111ond and gridiron, which retninds vnu of a box at the Polo Grounds, as an en- ¥- thn~iastic alun1nus ventured recently. But it is within that you realize the careful plan- ning and arrange-1nent that has n1ade the gvn1 ~uch a gen1 of architecture. Down- , stairs the \~'all ace T. Foote 111e1norial pool- 75 ft?\et long- and 28 feet wide-a prize in it- ~eH. This pool has been made after the new- e-~t a PJ)ro,red rnet hods. with a life-rail gutter which enables the swin1n1er to catch hol'd and rest at any spot, no n1atter how deep along the sides of the tank. A special fea- ture will be the inlaying in this tife-rail gut- ter. of figures telling the depth of the pool at the spot indicated. By means o£ these handy re1ninders a swim1ner ca.n see how deep he is going and j uqge his safety ac- cordingly. Foote, '85, will be remembered as long as Union lives by grateft..1l students. T'he main floor is a model of :careful ar- rangement. Not only are strict:ly athletic n1atters, such as the quarters tor hotne and visiting tean1s, offices for Dr. McCotnber and others, a faculty dressing room, a trophy rootn, weight roon1s, innumerahle sho-wers and \vhat not, scientifically pla..nned, but facilities have been n1acle for clearing the n1ain floor for dancing in a very short space of tin1e by trap doors to store r()Olns. 1\'he architects had in tnind n1any other activities beside-s athletics when they drew up their p1ans. The gyn1 floor is so planned that it can be turned into an auditorium for recitals or lectures, and it could, indeed,. be trans·· formed into a little theater witlll. dressing- rooms adjacent to the stage. Dances can well be held there, and dressing-rooms are numerous. The addition of a k:itchenette makes possible luncheons-such .as the an- nual Alumni luncheon. Thus we find a btlilding capable of various u~es where originally a n1ere gy1nnasium was planned. So, on January 1st, the college will reap the results of hard work begun hy the stu- dents in 1908, fostered by the Board of Trus- tees under the direction of Courtland V. Anable, chairman of the gym con1mittee; and tnade possible by President Richmond and persuasion. Perhaps a few words fron1 Dr. Mac may well end this article. \The new Gym,\ says Dr. Ma.c, ''is for the nse of the student hody as a whole. \.\'bile it will be very irnportant fo-r the var- sity men. yet it will have even fitter results

d j THE CONCORDIENSIS 15 if it stim1;.1lates the stttdent body in general to get out and take regular exercise. 1'he nl'en who need· tra·inrng most are those who are least inclined to· take it, and as director o£ the gym! r am going to lnake a special effort to aro·use an interest on the part of the non-athletic student in exercise. 'The wide range of activities wl1ich a fully equipped gy1nnasiuro provide-s should give incentive for the ordinary student to take some thought to a regular special kind of exercise for hin1self. In the co~urse of time swi1nming vvi 11 be n1ade part of the compulsory gym requiren1ents for advancement an1ong stu- dents. A.t present cornpulsory gym work is ... confined to the Freshrn an class, but when an as~·i stant can be procured the work is to be n1ade con1 puTsory for Sophomores also. ·~rrhe gytn 1<vill be a splendid opportunity for organizing class and fraternity tean1s, both for such sports as indoor relay racing and for various acquatic sports. Of course, the advantages to the college from a social standpoint need not be emphasized. The Senior Ball, the Junior Prom and the Sopho- nlore Soiree, as wen as dramatic events, concerts, lectures and the comm·encen1ent dinner will be held there. \The close eonnectio0n of the gym with the athletic field and the utilage of the verandas as grandstands all add to the genetal attrac- tiveness of the sche1ne and already prove a striking transforn1ation of the east end of the can1pus. \It tnay be well to mention that as yet there has been no f11nd raised for equip- ment of the gym nor for the indoor track which circles the bal<:ony. These still un- snpplied necessities will doubtless be ar- ranged for in the near future. At least. we have not failed in getting what we want so far, and don't intend io hereafter.'' ''vVho is the gretes1 inventor?\ \Pat Pending, I g-uess. I see his name on all those new £angler articles.\-. Ex. USE THE LIBRARY. A feature of the college library activities during the past few weeks has been the in- creased interest taken in it by the members of the freshman class. The general run of students co1ning to Union have not been accustomed to using a large library such as we have on the campus, and usual1y it takes a terrn or more for the new students to learn to employ reference books to good ad- vantage in their work. The '17 n1en are \waking up\ earlier than the average entering class, according to lihrary authorities. It behooves the yet dormant \frosh '' to get busy and find how useful our collection of books can be to then1. UNDERCLASS GAMES. Freshmen Defeat Sophomores in the Field and Hold Them to a 7-7 Score in Foot- ball. The freshmen easily outclassed the sopho- mores Saturday in the annual underclass athletic n1eet by the score of SS-45· The freshtnen won all the races except the mile run. in which Rollins, '16. outstripped his opponents by ten yards. Two of the three football g£nnes had been played previous to Saturday-the first \vas a no-score game, the second a 13-0 victory for the sophon1ores.

16 THE CONCORD.fENSIS were taken by the first-year men. Morrison, 'I 7, won the race in I o r- 5 seconds, with Carr and I-Iickok following him across the line in succession. This event gave five points to the freshmen. The sophomores gained five points by winning the mile run, which Rollins ran in 5 -minutes 4 2-5 seconds. Embree, '16, was a good second, while Harvey, '17, came in third. The military relay added ten more points to those of the freshmen. Each class team consisted of eight men. 1917 won by .a 40- yard lead and in the time of I minute 33 I- 5 ....._ seconds. Captain Sexson and his twenty-five sturdy freshmen pulled the ~'sophs\ in the tug-of- war about thirty-five yards. In vain did the \sophs\ attempt to hold their ground, but found the \frosh\ too strong.. By ~inning • this two-n1inute struggle the fres~11;1en made the score stand 45-35 in their favor. The Game. ! . . The football gam~, wh~~~ w~s the deciding event of the series, opened by the \sophs\ ' ' punting to the \frosh.\ At the very begin- ning of the gan1e the \sophs\ carried the ball . . down the field toward the freshmen goal. Within the first ten minutes of the game, Danner, 'r6, carried the pigskin passed the freshtnen line for a touchdown. Finch, 'r6, kicked the goal. Again in this quarter the \sophs\ threatened the freshmen line, but did not obtain a touchdown. In the second quar- ter the freshmen came back with lots of \pep and the ball was in the middle of the field most of the time. During this quarter Sammons, '17, broke his nose, and Boyle, '17, his ankle. The half ended in a 7--o score in favor of the sec.ond-ciassrnen. 1917 opened the second half with a lot of snap and the \sophs'\' goal was soon in dan-- ger. The ~'frosh\. tore th:rough the \soph'' line for long gains and when on their s-yard line Travis, '17, carried the ball over the line for a freshmen touchdown·. Rosecrans, '17,. easily kicked the goal. During the last quar- ter the bail was in the freshr~;en territory and their goal was threatened once or twice,. but at those times the freshmen held like a stonewall. The game ended with a tie score, 7-7· This gave each class ten points, inasmuch as each game w.;;t,s ~w.enty points for the win- ner. i .. The line-up and summary : I9I6.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 17 GARNET CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM lS BEATEN BY CLOSE SCORE. Williams' Harrie,rs Have Advantage of Training Over Hilly Course and Win 26 to 29. Only the advantage of having practiced over their own hilly course gave the Wil- liams cross-country team a victory over Union's representatives Saturday. The purple team had been trained to take the n1any steep grades at a fast pace, and gained considerably at these points. Even at that, the vVilliams men only won by three points, and it is thoroughly believed that on our o¥.rn level course the garnet runners would have gained the victory. The Race. The start was promptly at 2 :30 P. M. frotn the Williatns gymnasium, and the course followed the hilly country roads about vVil1ian1stown, ending with three- quarters of a mile on the Weston Field tra.ck. 1\'he run was made in 23 minutes 29 seconds, but this belies the true titne of the race, as the distance was sotnewhat over four miles. Corey and Acting Captain Oltnsted jumped into the lead for Williams at the start and lead till the two-thirds mark, where Olmsted dropped back, and Corey drew away fron1 the rest of the field. Fri- day and Newton of lTnion maintained an e·ven pace _throughout, and n1ade a \blanket\ finish for ~econd p1ace. \Vith the exception of these two n1en, the 1Jnion team was at the heels of the entire \Villian1s squad after covering the first mile of the race. But on the leveler course the Union 1nen lengthened out ~nd passed the purple ''hill and dalers.\ The men cro~sed the finish line in the fol- lowing order: Corey (\V), first; Newton (lT) and Friday (Lr), tied for second; New- ton (vY), Protl (vV), Oln1sted (\iV), Hoff- man ( l.J), Mudge (U), Scoly (U), Frazier (vV), Shen11an (l_T), Kidder (W), Kepner (W), :Gunning (U), Manager Case is arranging a race with Hamilton, to be run at Clinton on the day of the \Big'' game. The garnet runners are still in hard training under Coach Mac- Conl ber and Ca~ptain Mudge, and when the college goes \On to Hamilton\ there will be a double victory to cheer for, when the fes- tivities are over. FIRST ·G;LEE CLUB CONCERT. Seas.on Opened With a Most Successful Performance. On the ·evening of October 29, \Bill\ 1\!Indge, with his army of forty or more \harmony sharks,\ invaded the town of Amsterdam and there held the first con- cert of the season in the Second Presby- terian Church. The affair went with un- usual snap and was well appreciated by a large, enthusiastic audience of music-lovers, who demanded several encores from the perforn1ers. \Lucia di Lammennoor,\ be- ing especially well rendered by the l\1ando- lin Club, was received with the highest de- gree of enthusiasm, while the greatest hit of the Glee Club's program was \Wake Up, Sweet Melody,\ a new and very catchy song. The leaders of the clubs regard the An1sterclam concert as an excellent begin- ning and look forward to a very successful season. 1'he quartette is hard at work and will be in fine trin1 for the Thanksgiving trip. \Bill~· tel 1s us that the Christmas trip is very likely to materialize and that he has begun negotiations for a nntnber of con- certs. The ne:xt concert will be given at Ballston on Friday, November 7. The Cosmopolitan Club held a banquet at .Glenn's last v\ 1 ednesday evening. Prof. 11cKean gave the metnbers an interesting· talk. The clab expects to have other af- fairs of this kind during the year.

ASSOCIATION NOTES. The Hallowe'en social held at Silli1nan Hall last Friday was a great success.

A., and his assistant, Mr. Brasefield. 1\tfr. Ross was introduced by \Charlie· after which he gave a few words to the stu- dents. After everybody had- received their fill of cider and <;loughnuts, a general good time was entered into, in which the guests Bible study started last week; the nor- mal class 1neeting Tuesday afternoon at 4:30, and groups meeting later in the week. Every student is urged to participate in Bible study. There are two classes for the neutrals held in Silliman Hall at 4:30 on \iVednesday and at 7:00 on Thursday.

The Garnet Team Celebrates Last Home Game by :Smothering the Hobq.ken Eleven in Every Stage of the Game- Captain Sarvey Plays .a Most Spectacular Game. Saturday's dusk brought to a fitting cli- tnax the· use of the old Campus field when Union won its most convincing victory of the year: The Garnet crushed Stevens In- stitute by a score of 39 to 7, and showed its supporters a brand of play that was as sparkling as it was fast, and as sure as it was · overwhelming.' With one more game to play ere he passes into the ranks of \Former Football Stars,\ Captain Sar- vey hung up a record of four touchdowns and three goals from touchdowns. The work of· \Dave\ Beaver in gettirig off his long spiral forward passes,' as well as his general management of the team, and the fast play of \Wally\ Girling were of the highest ·order. The team was \there.\ Carefully heeding- Coach Dawson's latest -\a g-rim silence''-we merely remark that -it looks like rain 'next ·saturday. well, doesn't if? · · - Every pl'ayer ori the Garriet team de- serves special mention and a little· blue rib-' bon for ·playing- the ·game of his life, but as the \Concordy\ does nof qualifv as a Snnday-school superintendent, it ·passes· it up. Uji. Suffice it to say that Jenkins' battering- ram plunges from tackle~back formation, Hokerk's steady passin'g and y()e man work on the i ine, the clever iriter~erence and tackling of Starbuck and Story, tbe defense of Page, Jackson and Price, as well as the peppery offense of the whole backfield, merit lots of praise, and they got lots of applause. Sarvey's sixty-yard· run through a broken field for a touchdow111., Girling's run of twenty.:.five yards througb the whole red team for another, and' a forty-five-yard canter e>f Jenkins', around leh end, that brought the ball within scoring distance of the Stevens goal, were features · of the game. These star plays· were made pos- sible on a whole by· the sterlrng interfer- ence which Coach Dawson has developed recently, and by the aggressi·,.re work of \Dave\ Beaver at quarter. The game· was played in ·a drizzling rain, which did riot interfere with the enthu- siastn of the cheering sections led by \Buck\ Meneely, nor did it keep the crowd aw·ay-, for the east· and west stands, as well· as the side lines ·and parking places, were filled ·to their utmost. First Quarter. · Stoller ran back the kick-of-f ten yards, · but Union ~could not ad vane e the ball. Girting's punt was returned after ·three plays, and Union· found herself. Sarvey hurtled around' left end 'f6t nin'tC yards, and

10 THE CON'CORDIENSIS Starbuck made fifteen more on a pretty forward pass from Beaver. On the next scrimmage another pass netted eight yards. Then Jenkins butted into the Stevens line for twelve yards. Sarvey scored the first touchdown on a fifteen-yard run. It was scored on a long ang-le from the goal and the punt out was unsuccessful. Stevens kicked off again and Jenkins ran the ball back. Girling wafted the pigskin on the end of his toe over the Stevens goal line for a touchback. Stevens then fumbled on their twenty-yard Ene, and two forward passes in close succession, with Sarvey on the receiving end of the last, brought an- other touchdown to the Garnet. Every- body evoked a facial ripple. But just after that Stevens put up the strongest play she showed during the game, and the ripple rolled away for a while. Union had kicked off and the team from the wrong side of the river marched down the field, relent- lessly battering at the left of the Union line for five first downs. Almost on top of their own goal the Garnet team braced and held for two downs. A five-yard penalty following that, set the ovoid within a yard of the crossbars. Everybody wiped that smile off like so many freshmen. Twice more Union held that one yard, fig-hting grimly, but on the third assault Stevens managed to shove Seiler over the line. Union's plucky brace, when for five downs in succession they held the red team o a single yard, was thus rendered useless by a penalty. The quarter ended soon after the tou chd,own~ Score: Union, 12; Stevens, 7. Second Quarter. The rest of the game was just one touch- down after another. Stevens never got any nearer to the Union g-oal than to see 11- throug·h a transit. Stoller ran the kick- off back five yards. A steady advance, teeming with brilliant forward passes and wide end runs, brought the pigskin within a yard of the red goal. Roof, who had taken Stoller's place at fullback, dove across the line. Play wavered around the field in an undecided sort of way tiU Jen- kins slid through the very heart of the opposing line and came out the other side ten yards to the good. He repeated the little trick on the next play for twenty yards, with Roof's assistance. Then Jen .. kins opened up an orifice, a chasm, a can- yon in the line, through which Sarvey ambled for another touchdown. \Sarve~' obliged with a goal kick, too. The quar- ter ended thereupon. Score: Union, 25 ; Stevens, 7. Third Quarter. This period was marketd by Captain Sar- vey's trickle down the field and GirTing's no less spectacular run. I-Iokerk kicked off and after three plays Stevens was forced to punt. The boot went about fifteen yards, and it was Union's ball very nearly where Stevens had had it a moment pre- vious. Girling hit the Hoboken line to no advantage. Then Sarvey sifted between tackle and end, came through clear, shook off half a dozen Indians (Redmen, of course-perfectly apparent!), and ran sixty yards to the Stevens goal. He kicked the goal. After a number of tight scrim1nages Union forced the pigskin down within a foot of the Stevens goal posts, only to lose it. However, Girling made up for this unsuccessful attempt by chasing twenty- five yards for the last touchdown of the game. Sarvey lifted the , ball over the cross-bars for the final point. Score : Union, 3 9 ; Stevens, 7. Fourth Quarter. This period was played without result. Neither side was capable of bringing the ball dangerously near the other's territory and the period ended uneventfully. Final score: Union, 39; Stevens, 7.

The Hoboken aggrega-- tion had lots of fight in them, but seemed very heavy and slow in comparison to the wearers o.f the Garnet. Thus ended the life of the old Campus field-in a fast, clever, spectacular battle, with the right team winning. What more could any field ask before going into re- tirement? On to Hamilton !

It is sincerely hoped that the publica- tion of the \Union College Song Book,\ which has been hanging fire for some time, can be put through this year. Any stu- dent who knows any old Union song, or songs, which are good, or any student who can write some good song, is requested to hand it to the Song Book Committee, of which \Doc\ Howell is chairman. The success of the book depends entirely upon the support which the students give to the project, and if the students do manifest an interest in this matter a mighty fine book can be published . MISS HOFFMAN'S WEDDING. The Hoffman home was the scene of a brilliant wedding Saturday night, when Miss Emma Louise Hoffman, daughter of Professor and Mrs. Frank Sargent Hoff- man, and Ransom Rathbone Micks of Seneca Falls were married by the former president of Union College-Rev. Dr. George Alexander of New York. The house was very artistically decorated, with vines covering the doors and archways. After the ceremony and reception the members of the bridegroom's fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi, sang, as a serenade to the bridal couple, some fraternity songs. Mr. and Mrs. Micks left by automobile for Alhany, on their way to New York. They will reside in Seneca Falls. Mr. Micks graduated from Union in 1912. uon to Hamilton!\

J\1anager Meneely of the Dra- matic Club announced a meeting of last year's cast for Wednesday night at 7:15 c/ clock, just before the campus meeting, in the chapel.

ENGINEERING NOTES. T'h.e-re has recently been installed in the General Engineering laboratory a Rhele tesung machine having a maximum force of 200;000 pounds. This machine may be used for either a tension or compression test and may also be used for determining the transverse strength of steel or concrete beams up to five feet in length. It is also fitted with an .automatic recording device which plots the curve of the distortion as a factor of the force. A 70 H. P. motor furnishes the power for the machine. A 35 H. P. motor has been received by the Engineering laboratory and will be used to drive a battery of pumps. Smith, '14, has started a class in wireless telegraphy, which is open to anyone inter- ested in this subject. At first, time will be devoted to the study of the Continental wireless code, while afterwards practical work will be done at the electrical labora- tory. The class meets at the electrical laboratory at 3:30 on Wednesdays and 10 :00 A. M. Saturdays. The n1ain power line of the electrical laboratory is being fitted with circuit break- ers, so arranged that in case of acc~dent a man sitting at the tables in the front of the room may throw off the power frow the entire laboratory circuit.

Y. \On to Hamilton!\ DON'T BE A GOOP. Come lay aside, ye Union lads, your ever constant pens and pads, and get aboard that special. The Concordiensis is a conservative sheet. Rarely is there seen anything rabid and radical within its covers and only once in a while does it burst forth into wild perturbations of expression. For a time it is off its feet; it has sb.aken off its mantle of reserve. Until the 15th it is insane, and thereafter will do proper penance. The English Department will shudder and rend its hair at the murderous 1nassacre of our musical language. You all have heard Fred Dawson, the charge d'affaires, and other celebrities' of our little world, outline the Hamilton trip in all its various phases. They have done well. Now it is the ''Concordy's\ turn, and slang is the twang by which we harangue the n1ultitude. With prophecy aforethought we realize that we have sounded our death knell. Without a doubt we will be brought before the high.,. est courts of impeachment on the Hill. But what care we? We are happy, we rej~oice in our punishment, if, in any sn1all measure, we succor the I-Ian1ilton migra- tion, and our only regret is that we have .but one \write\ to give for \On to Ham- ilton.\ Gentlemen, yes, and even you who are not going Saturday, we are so full of en- thusiasm over the Hamilton trip that we choke as we write. We cannot give proper expression to appeal through a lack of serious 111ental deliberation. We are caught up and wafted along by anticipatory thoughts of Saturday, and what it will bring. May the \stay-at-homes\ be few, and woe to them if there be an en1bryonic Demosthenes among us to hurl a philippic or two at them in our next issue. It is the duty of every single, solitary Union man to throw aside for a while minor details, like the Mexican situation, curricu- latory activities, and affairs of state. They can wait. The special will not. You owe it to the team, if not to yourselves, to make the trip. If we ever had a team with the ''pep'' and \punch we have it now. We are proud of them, we are back of '. ~ .. ., ~ ,,.1 . ' ·l I~ '

They may come on the .field in dirty, tattered old uniforn1s, they may not have thick, wooly blankets in which to wrap themselves and keep warm when not in the thick of the fray, but we'll keep them warm in heart, at least, by some real singing and cheering, such as they have never heard before away from home. By the way, where has the old Number 1 disappeared to? Stand before your mirror, \Buck and revive it until the oscillations of your arms are rhythmic. And let not exuberant enthusiasm carry i' us away when we invade the h0stile coun- try. In this we indorse the coach heartily. Be silent. Be grim. Be determined. Keep your knowledge under cover. Let others do the talking and use the tin horn. We are confident, we are practically sure of victory, but given Hamiltpn credit, fel- lows. No matter how disastrous a season she has had previous to the big game, and how successful Union has been, whenever the Garnet and the Buff and Blue meet, there's a battle royal. They do not know how to give up, and take all manner of punishment. They fight us to the last ditch and beyond. Yet, though we are willing to stake our all on the Garnet, we must maintain a grim silence and show by action that we are there. The impossibility of persuading any back-slider to join the triumphant army of the 15th appals us; its magnitude is too great for our infant ef- forts, but with our last gasping breath we cry: Don't be a GOOP. _ _,_ __ \On to f-T ami1ton !\ UNION TEAM MARKS COME-BACK WITH DECISIVE VICTORY OVER HOBART . Garnet Team Outplays Geneva Aggregation in Last Period and Scores Two Touch ... downs. Our team journeyed to Buffalo Election Day to play Hobart on a neutral field. It returned victorious, and the college was jubilant over our first win in many weeks. Not that we think less of our boys for los- ing, for we know just how far \hard luck\ figured in all our defeats, but it seems en- couraging to register a win over our old rivals from Geneva. The field was wet and slippery, but, then, the Union men have grown quite accustomed to playing in a \sea of mud,\ so they hit the line hard, and, showing greater strength with each new period, put on a final spurt and scored two touchdowns in the very last quarter. The game proved a decided attraction, for, de- spite the threatening weather, there was a large crowd on hand to witness the struggle. Union the Aggressor. Union was the aggressor most of the time, the Orange team playing on the de- fense almost throughout. Neither squad used the wind to advantage, except when Union changed her style of play in the final quarter, and worked its forward passes for long enough gains to win the game. Old- style football was the issue, with the playing a little slow. The fourth period was the best of the garne. Girting ran 25 yards for a score, after having received the ball .on a long forward pass from Beaver. Sarvey inter- cepted a Hobart pass and ran 65 yards through a broken field for another touch- down. Union's backfield, Sarvey, Girting, Roof and Beaver, featured the contest ' while Furgason, Hall and Jenkins showed n p we 11 for Hobart.

18 THE CONCORDIEN:SIS SENIOR ENGINEERS WIN 13..;0 VI~C­ TORY OVER ACADEMlCS. Everyone on the \Hill\ was in. a high state of nervous tension. It was Election Day. Some could hardly await the names of the newly-chosen municipal officers, but most of the \studes\ were interested in the outcome of the big footbaH game at Buffalo. 'The score, by periods, would be received over the wire at the Press Club, but something real exciting was necessary to keep the fellows \on the ground,\ as it were, until the returns came in. Our most eminent senior class came to the rescue. A spirited football contest be- tween the \Engineers\ and the \Acad- emics,\ with lots of '•pep\ on both sides, and a startling display of trick formations and forward passes, afforded splendid amusement for the crowd, until the report of a 14-0 victory over Hobart was an- nounced. A most heteroge!lous collection of foot- ball toggery, \relics of the old days,\ was relegated to use, and after a brief \re- hearsal,'' the teams lined up. Eut wait- there was another matter to sett'le before the game could go on. \Doc\ Howell and Kenworthy, two of the veterans on the academic team, had gone home t() register their votes and the \B. S.-A. B.\ combina- tion had tried to \slip over\ a couple of \sophs\ as ringers in their places, with strenuous protest on the parts of the en- gineers. After considerable wrangling, the B. E.'s consented, and the ~'sophs\ were given important places on the academic teatn. The engineers kicked off, and at once recovered the ball on downs. Then, by a series of line plunges, Hager brought the ball to the Academic 10-yard line, where Barclay skirted right end for a touchdown. It seen1ed like a \walk-away\ for the En- g-ineers, but the Academics buckled up, and there was no further scoring ttntil the fourth period. Most of the boys had been out the night before, and so the intermissions were neces- sarily quite longer than usual. On two occasions Captain Barclay of the Engineers felt indisposed, and ''time-out\ had to be called until he recuperated. Big John Hall, B.. E., and \Red\ Schaffer of the Academics had it out at center, while \Lute\ Hager seemed to bear a general antipathy toward little ''George\ Truax, who led the Academics, in their Greek sig- nal plays. In the fourth period \Dutch'' Nauman replaced Barclay at quarter, and the Engineers scored again on a forward pass to Gidley. \Dutch\ kicked the goal and the score was 13-0. Mudge, \Pink\ Sherman and Vosburgh starred for the Academics, and with \Chuck\ Sherman and some of the \first .. string\ men in the line they would have worked their plays to far better advantage. The Academics feel confident that they can turn tables on the Engineers, and have challenged them to a return game. Capt. Truax is perfecting some new \calculus'' plays for the occasion. The summaries : Score by quarters : Engineers ................ 6 0 0 7-13 Academics ............... 0 0 0 0- 0 Touchdowns-Barclay, Gidley. Goals from touchdowns-Nauman.

THE C'ONCORDIENSIS 19 INDUSTRIAL CAMPAIGN. Students Show ~reat Interest in the Work to Be Started Among Foreigners. The work of the industrial comtnittee of the Christian Association has met with the instant and somewhat unexpected approva~ of the whole college. Secretary Male, whiie confident that the men would take an interest in this form of industrial work, was not prepared for the spontaneity with which the students have rallied to the 'vork. Two years ago the Association carried on a certain amount of industrial work at 11 ong the foreigners in the city, chiefly teaching them in English and Civics. The work was not started last year for some un- known reason, but it has started now, and has started with a rush. Fred H. Rindge, Jr., Secretary for the Industrial Department of the International Committee of Y. M. C. A.'s, arrived in town Sunday afternoon at 2 :30. He spoke at the Sunday Vespers on the \Extent and Aims of Industrial Work.\ Monday morn- ing the industrial committee, just to show they were in earnest, met with him at 6 :45 A. M. to talk over the work. At 10 o'clock Mr. Rindge addressed Dr. Hill's Economic Class, and at noon he spoke in Chapel. In both these talks he emphasized the value of the work to the teachers themselves, and particularly to engineering students who would come into contact ' with just such foreigners after they left college. President Richmond was so much in sympathy with the idea that he added a word of emphasis to Mr. Rindge's talk in chapel. Monday afternoon Mr. Rindge and Sec- retary Male, together with Mr. Bracefield, Assistant Secretary of the city Y. l\ti. C. A., canvassed the foreign sections of the city for definite openings where classes rnight be started. They were amazed to hear the editor of the :Polish w-eekly say that there were thirteen thousand Poles in Schenec- tady, exclusive of the other Slavish people. This fact went to show more clearly than ever that the men on the Hill have un- limited opportunities to do work among industrial workers. Monday evening, at 8 o'clock, a detnon- stration class was held, in which the method of teaching English to these for- eigners was explained and tried. Over fifty students were present at that nleet- ing. The industrial committee, under the ieadership of Blodgett, 15, has been work- ing to definitely organize the different kinds of service under competent men. At present over forty students have volun- teered to take up this work and teach these classes of foreigners. T'his looks like about the biggest thing the Association has undertaken this year, and it gives the stu- dents invaluable experience in handling men. That the men has recognized this fact is shown by the way in which they . have come around and asked to be gtven classes. GLEE CLUB'S SECOND CONCERT. Under the most favorable conditions, the Glee and Mandolin Clubs gave their second concert before a well-filled Ballston house.

All the arrangements for the Hamilton trip have been completed. Announce- ment was made at chapel meeting Monday that the Union Special will leave the local N evr York Central Station at 9 o'clock Saturday morning and will arrive in Utica about 10 :45. Cars for Clinton from Utica can be taken at any time between 11 and 1 o'clock. Returning, the special will leave Utica at 12 o'clock midnight. The ex- penses necessary for the trip amounts to three dollars and twenty-five cents, not including meats. The Faculty has granted the petition of the Terrace Council that all those who attend the Hamilton game be excused from classes Saturday morning; but requires that arrangements be made witb the professors to make up the work missed.

You know evening in the c~apel, which vvas probably Clark College has tried for many years to have athletics without inter-collegiate competit ... on. The result is that it is im- possible to get the students even to take the proper amount of exercise.

'The students all showed the grim determination, 1l()t over-confidence, how- ever!' to fight hard, which spirit Coach Daws{)n demanded in his talk Monday at chapel meeting. Iian1ilton is sure to put up a stiff fight; the game will not be over until the last whistle blows, and every n1a11 tnust sup1Port the team to the last ditch. A tax of ten cents was levied upon each i' student so that the band can make the trip and lead tlhe songs at the game. EN'GLISH CLUB.

M ey lan, director of physical educa..tion at Columbia Univer- sity, is quoted as making the following argument in favor of football: ~''fh e game of football is the. best of all American athletic sports. It develops as no other game can the manly qualities of strength, rugg:e dness o.nrl aggressiveness. It is perhaps a logical cr1ticism that foot- ball is not a game for the average man, but every sport takes a man a little bet- ter than the a.verage. It takes a com- petitive team 1:o arouse interest among men and make them take exercise that The class of 1917 ~ t Princeton U niver- sity numbers 430, the large-st in the his- tory of the school. It is interesting to note that of fifteen of the big college teams of the east five are captained by men playing an end p·osi- tion on their teain. Men playing guard are next numerous, with three captains, . ' while the back field has only four repre-· sentatives. Last year the average was decidedly different, over 75 per cent of the ca.ptains holding backfield positions. At R. P. I. each member of the A. A. is allowed to wear a button, which serves to distinguish t~e men who are supporting the institute athletics. Phi Gamma Delta is building a new house at the University of Pennsylvania. F. and M. has an endowment fund of $358,000. Certain freshmen would do well to re- member that while in Rome it is wise to be a Roman candle. Hamilton College is to have a co-ed summer school in English next summer, according to the decision of the Board of Trustees at their fall meeting. Michigan Aggies have a negro football player who scorns all kinds of headgear. He says his \head is hard enough to stop anything.\

Muddy Field Halts Our Fast Open-Work Plays and Stops Captain Sarvey's Brilliant Long Runs ·Fighting as hard in defeat as in victory, but apparently without the old-time \punch''; stumbling, sliding, slipping over a field that was ankle-deep in mud; attempting unsuccessfully plays that on the previous Saturday had worked like charms; urged on by frenzied cheering that drowned the shrill piping of Hamiltonian support- ers, Union fell before Hamilton Saturday in grim defeat. 12 to 0 was the final score, the total of two touchdowns. It was in vain that the two hundred and fifty Union men who had travelled to ·Clinton that morning cheered and cheered-calling, pleading for an exhibition of the sort of play the team had been showing during the last three games. It was in vain that the Garnet team struggled against the offense of Hamilton and fought in defense. The field, forty parts mud and the rest savvdust, offered no chance to introduce suc- cessfully those spectacular open plays which have been so typical of Union's game this season. Hamilton's weight and mass plays, and the impetus they acquired in getting off their formations, were too much for the wearers of the Garnet. Time after time \Dave\ Beaver called for the forward pass formation that had wrought such deadly effect against Hobart and Stevens. Time after time the Union rooters sank back in their seats happily sure of the spectacular forty-yard gain which

! ' ... ! : . l ' 10 THE. CONCORDIENSIS was so certain to follow. Time after time the ball was snapped into play fast, with pre- cision-only to fall from the finger-tips of the backs, who had circled Hamilton's line to receive the ball. The hall never fell far fron1 the waiting han.ds, seldom more than a foot, but that foot was enough to spoil the play. However, it was not the far-famed work of Coach· Samp of Hamilton, who had been putting the Buff and Blue through such strenuous efforts in the last week endeavoring to find some way for breaking up Union's forward pass formation, that caused the faiiure of this play. It was the con- dition of the field that spilled the attack every time. Hamilton, an endowed college, may thank the parsimony of its trustees or the \spirit\ of its alumni for its victory over Union. How true the saying is, that \Hamilton's field is good for fifteen points for Han1ilton,'' has been shown, but the sportsmanship of the college may well be ques- tioned after the boast is made. The impression is that Union was not \there\-that the team was cowed by the Buff and Blue aggregation. But individually the play of each man on the team was as. spirited and strong as at any tin1e during the season. Only it was not as sure, as steady, as precise as heretofore. For Union, two seniors played their final game of football-and they played welL Captain Sarvey had no chance to break loose with his extraordinary runs that have S() often brought victory to the Garnet. But his play was strong, as fast as any play could be under such conditions, and when knocked out he came back with all the spirit of more successful battles. \Steve~' Story vvorked harder than at any time during his career. Many times he weaved in behind I-Iamilton's line to throw the runner for a loss. He was in each play with all the strength of his lithe body and will. And Vi.rhen in the last quarter, worn with his efforts, his face and body one plaster of mud and sawdust, he stu111bled off the field to sink down, inert and sobbing for breath, art the bench, Union supporters then, and only then, realized how· their team was playing and how much was at stake. And then, just as the team was fighting their heads offj so the stands yelled, roared, sobbed their heads off. Jenkins played like a wild man, taking out two men at every play, his body .a mass of vibrant humanity that struck I-Iamilton's line like a steel spring, only to re- bound and slip through the mud before Hamilton's only advantages-greater weight and practice on that kind of a field. The whole Union line fought with just the sa1ne spirit-and the same success. Starbuck doing the impossible in getting after forward passes and spilling Hamilton's defense ; \Garry\ Wood, working n1ightily, in every play till the last man went down; Gardner, fighting his head off; Hokerk, a tower of strength, enspiriting the whole team with his energy and defending his position till E[amilton saw it was impregnable; Jackson, creeping in behind and dragging down his man often. Thus for the line, and the substitutes played the same kind of football. '' t

to a up on- nts the as. as S() the for 011. . offj .a re- ' · ' and ,, '' t THE CONCORDIENSlS 11 In the backfield \Dave'' Beaver ran the team with all the cunning of long practice and knowledge of the game. Three and four times in succession he would caH !or the forward pass formation, only to find it unsuccessful. But he kept at it throughout the game, steadily heaving the slimy pigskin, only to see the receiver over-run in the mud. Girling made the one play of the game that brought the stand to its feet. 'I'his was with Beaver's help, when he caught a forward pass in the last quarter. The pass sailed forty yards down the field and \Wally\ ran five more ere he was tackled. The only good the pass did, however, was to prove that it was not Hamilton's \forward pass defense\. that had so often blocked the play, but the uncertainty of play on the im- possible field. Roof played a steady game, but his weight was not sufficient to plow through the inertia of the Hamilton team. But when Stoller took his place in the sec- ond half, increased weight and freshness proved valuable to Union. Stoller's plunges vvere spectacular. The two hundred and twenty-four rooters who took the Hamilton Special Saturday morning were augmented by a number of anto parties which saw the game. The Union delegation arrived in Hamilton at various times during the day, some taking the 12 :30 car from Utica, some going right to Clinton. But at two o'clock the whole crowd gathered in front of the Gym preparatory to marching on the field. At 2:15 the Ham- iltonians, led by what \Hamilton Life\ calls the \Fife and Drum Corps,\ 'but which consisted exclusively of a bass drum, marched onto the field. Five minutes later Union's forces, led by the faithful Band, formed into line for their own entrance. Union outnumbered Hamilton on the field and overwhelmed the petite grandstand placed at its disposal. A mass of Union rooters crowded the sidelines, room was found on the players' bench for a number more, and even the roof of the stand was turned into an observatory for the game. \Buck\ Meneely and his henchmen got off a few preparatory cheers just to warm the throats of the crowd. Hamilton began the day, as they finished it, by doing the unusual. In this case the team entered the field about ten minutes before the visting team appeared. They were greeted by cheering from both sections. At 2:45 Captain Sarvey led the Garnet boys onto the field on the run. T·hen beginning, and keeping up long after the game, the Union stands raised such cheers as to drown all efforts of the Buff and Blue. Throughout the game the Union bleach- ers were not still for a minute. Frenzied, calling for cheers, Union's supporters rasped their throats tirelessly, bringing all their enthusiasm and strength into their voices, and filling Steuben Field with sound as probably it has never been filled before. The gluttony for yells kept Meneely and Truax working all the time, and even in moments of the greatest gloom Union cheering was \there\-heartening their tea1n, showing that they were behind them, encouraging them, and huriing defiance at the Buff and Blue.

I \ • ' ' I ,' , I I : i . .. i I . i 12 THE CONCORDlENSIS Between the halves Union invaded the field and the rooters could see for them ... selves what condition it was in. Marching two by two they circled the field,. then formed in a U, and the volutne of sound that rolled from Union lips while singing Alma Mater rnade Hamilton and their ''Carissim.a~' blush at the contrast. .A..fter the game Union took possession of the campus, first forming be tore the Gyn1, and raking the last spark of noise out of their throats for the individual members of their team, for ''Fred'' Dawson, for Manager Telfer, and again for the team and every man on the squad. For £orty-five minutes the Union rooters waited in mass forma- tion outside the Gym, and the sound of the Hamilton chapel bell, pealing wildly in victory, was silenced by the hostile cries of the invading army. Not content with cheer- ing, they ''raised their vo]ces in song,\ and soon the Hamilton campus was echoing with \The Terrace Song\ and other old favorites that have cheered Union hearts in victory or defeat for many decades. Next the Victory bonfire 1nust be assailed, so forming in march formation, two by two, Union marched round and round the few Hatnilton supporters and the tremendous fire, still cheering and singing for Old Union. The line of march was soon broadened, and Union serenaded Hamilton from fraternity house to fraternity house. Long before their vocif~rations had ceased the Victory Bell had become silent. Thus did loyal Union rooters strive to turn the sharp knife of defeat. THE GAME IN DETAIL. Firs.t Quarter. Hatnilton won the toss and chose to de- fend the south goal. Hokerk sent the ball far down the field and LaForce ran it back a few yards. Sarvey got hi1n. Two plays gave Ha1nilton 7 yards, and a penalty for offside to Union made it first down. Here Union held and Hamilton was forced to kick. Sarvey caught the ball and ran it hack 10 yards. Union w4s unable to ad- vance the ball and Girling kicked. Beaver fumbled the slippery ball for a 12-yard loss. Girling tnade- 4 yards. Unsuccessful for- ward pass attempted, Beaver to Starbuck. Girting kicked. Starbuck got his man in his tracks on the kick.

LaForce kicked off to Jenkins, who car- ried the ball back 10 yards. Jessup, Ham- ilton's star tackle, slipped through the line and tackled Sarvey for a loss. Girling punted. Starbuck was on top of Bristol almost before he caught the ball and fold- ed him inside of three or four layers of dirt and oatlneal before he could move. Ogden gained 3 yards and the whistle blew. Second Quarter. Union caught a poor punt but could not gain. Girling kicked out of bounds on Hamilton;s 15-yard line. Hamilton could not gain either and pun ted.

Pope recov- ered the b(!ll on the 18-yard line. Three plays put the .pigskin over the goal. 1~he goal-kick was not successful. was thrown for a loss on the kick, and Cap- tain Robinson could not gain.

Then Gir ling received a for- ward pass 40 yards down the field and ran 5 more. This was the most spectacular play of the game and came in the last two minutes. Just at this time Union was playing the same consistent ball she has shown before. A fun1ble gave Hamilton th_e oval, however, and the quarter ended w1th the ball in the middle of the field. Score: Hamilton, 12; Union, 0. Hamilton kicked to Jenkins. Stoller went in for Roof at fullback and imme- diate~y plowed through the line for 9 yards. Jenk1ns made first down. A forward pass was intercepted by Hamilton. First down was made in four plays. Hamilton punted on fourth down. Again Union attempted three forward passes, each unsuccessful, and kicked on the final down. Hamilton The fight and vim present in all Union- Hamilton games was in evidence Saturday, and the rivalry was at all tin1es good- natured. For Hamilton, Captain Robin- son, Jessup and Ogden starred.

CALIBAN. PREXY GIVES ADDRESS. Dr. Richmond was the principle speaker at the banquet of the New York Historical Society, held Tuesday evening, to celebrate the 109th anniversary of the founding of the society. President Rich1nond spoke on \The Safeguards of American Democracy.\ He said in erasing: \There is much loose and loud talk about Democracy, uncrowned kings, and the like-what Carlyle calls, 'Considerable rumbling of the rotatory calabash,' a favo- rite device of shrewd and designing tnen whose business is the exploitation of the people for revenue only. But the people themselves are not corrupt nor wanting in sense, excepting when they are driven in herds to the political sha1nbles, then, like other gregarious animals, they lose their identity in the herd and cease for the mo- ment to be rational. A great piece of work remains to be done in this country ; our success in doing it will detern1ine our final success as a nation. If we can do it, and do it well, every other vexing pro ble111: capital and labor, trusts, tariff and currency, will be va~tly helped to its solution. I mean the reassertion and the re-establishment of the sovereignty of the people under the restraint and rule of the sovereignty of the law. Some political or- ganization will have to do this-son1e old one or some new one. It will never be a party that chooses for its leaders men who are themselves law-breakers, or men who look upon the law as an inconvenient check upon their personal p~easures or their political ambitions. And it will never be a party organized upon the basis of spoils or of specia1l privilege. It will be a party that not only has a reverence for the law in its heart, but also the fear of God be- f . ,., ore 1ts eyes. Y. M. ·C. A. NOTES. The Industrial Work among the for ... eigners has been moving forward in great shape. Several classes have already been started and are doing splendidly. Two Bible Study classes have also been started at the city Y. M. C. A. Several :more classes in Bible Study for the students will be organized very soon. Over one hundred students met in the various classes last week. Dr. J. A. Ely, of St. John's College, Shanghai, China, gave a very interesting talk on \China\ at Vesper Service, Sun- day. Clancy D. Connell, State Secretary of the College .Y. M. C. A., will speak at Vespers this next Sunday. The Seventh International Convention of the Stu dent Volunteer Movement will be held in Convention Hall, Kansas City, Mo., beginning at 2:30 Wednesday after- noon, Decetnber 31, 1913, and closing on the evening of January 4, 1914. The purpose of this convention is to bring together representative delegations of students and professors from all the important institutions of higher education in Canada and the United States, - and leaders of the foreign missionary enter- prise, for helpful assGciation and confer- ence concerning the questions with which these earnest workers must contend. This session is expected to be the greatest stu- dent gathering ever held; no less than eight hundred institutions will be repre- sented.

Matters of concern to every college in the country are discussed, and it is of great importance that each institution should be represented. Our college is en- titled to three student delegates, one fac- ulty member and the general secretary. It is hoped that we may be able to send our full delegation, and a strenuous atten1pt will be made to do so. HEARD ON THIS END OF THE WIRE. Hello-Hamilton? This is Union speak- ing. Thought I'd call up and let you know I got home all right the other night. What's that-go to church Sunday? Well I should say not! Don't believe they had any Sunday down here. I sure don't remen1 ber anything about one n1yself. Little bit disappointed about the game? Well, you can just bet I'm disappointed! I'n1 keeping it pretty well to myself though, b'cause I've no kick coming. You trin1med me fair and square, and that's all there is to it. But just wait 'till next ti- Aw, please cut the apologies about the n1ud ! I'll adtnit that's the only reason why my forward passes didn't run up forty points on you; but how the deuce you go- ing to help it if the sky wants to leak? I can't blame you for that, you know. Say, Hamilton, I hadn't thought of it be- fore-suppose it rained twice in succession up there? Your field would run over sure as fate, and it w' d be a shame if all your fine old buildings should float down into the valley. If they ever get started down that hill, I'll bet my bottom sinker they'll go right through-say, what's the name of it there where the trolleys get cold feet? What's that? Gee, you're hoarse yet, aren't you? Try again, old tnan; I don't get it. Clinton, you say? Well, you'd ought to put up a sign-post or a saloon or something there. I got on the wrong side of the road coming down and walked right by. The first thing I saw was Ut-what'd you say? Oh-the show. Som-mm-me show, believe me i! fiaven'[ llad such a good tin1.e in years. One ~thing I didn't ~ust exactly like, though. lten1ember that red- headed guy that got up on the stage an.d yeHed, \Who heat Union?\ That showed kind of rotten spirit, 1 thought- Here, wait a n1inute! Don't get excited, old man-I didn't aim that one at you. Of course, I know you're j 11.st as sorry he yelled that as I am, and probably he was himself after he got a good sleep, but the point is you'd never ought to 've let him get up there in the first place. Guess one or two of my men got a l~ittle bit excited Saturday night, too. I'm sorry-Huh? Hard feelings? Not by a long shot ! The longer we scrap, the better friends we get -'aint it? Well, guess 1'111 ring off. Got to get down to biz and do a little studying from now on-sure, haven't been doing enough to hurt me lately. Well, good- what's that? How much do I weigh now? Som-mm-m-me sh-some sharp-witted guy you are, Hatnilton. You run over here next Fall, and I'll show you how heavy I'm getting! And say, old man, I've got a new corner of the camptls for you to look over-so drop around as soon as you get a chance. See you later, Hamilton. Good-bye . ENGINEERING NOTES.

To tpose who dj9. 1~ot go with the team, we have only one thing to say : \We wonder at your remarkable lack of college spirit.\ To those who did go (and this includes nearly the whole college), we can only say that we are proud of you. The score says that we lost the game, but in losing the game we won a finer, a n1ore priceless thing, real, true Union spirit. We · once heard Union spirit defined as \that loyalty to Uniop which tn~k~s the student~ tear their very throats out in encouraging and standing behind a Union team which is making a losing :fight.\ We do not put this forward as a11 ideal definition, but we do say that it fits the case of Saturday. It is easy to yell and cheer wh~ll the score is in our favor, but. it is a far finer spirit which encourages and backs a team when they are fighting unsuccessfully against odds. It is this very spirit, which exists here on the Hill, that has become famous as \Union ~pirit,\ and Union certainly has reason to be proud of the way in which her sons showed their loyalty and undaunted faith in the face of a losing battle. ' '. Any words whic~ we can say to the n1en who played in that game for the honor of old Union seem so inadequate. We are proud of that team and of every single man on it. J ttst how proud we are we cannot tell you with mere words. Yott ' know how hard you fought, and we know it, t9o; and Union has every reason to f~el that, although the game was lost, you played a game which made sp·ectators say, \Those men love their Alma Mater.\ When we saw strong· men, taken from the ~arne because of sheer , in?-bility to play lQnger, come to the side line~ with tears runping down their cbe~ks, we realized as never before what a team we had, and we can only say that we could not be prouder of you if you had won by a hundred points. Yoq ?ave Union the best yo~ had in you C;Lnd, if conditions made that best futile, it was no fault of yours. W ~ voice the sen- timent of the whole college when we say to Captain Sarvey and his men that they defended the honor of old Union in a won-

20 THE CONCORDIENSIS of the greatest ideas they had ever heard of,\ and as a proof that they did hear it they removed their fife and drum corps fron1 sight soon after the Band appeared. Rumor has it that the corps died of envy. We do not vouch for the truth of this, howev·er. But,· be that as it may, the Band was a great factor in making the day as wholly Union's as it was. The tnen deserve lots of credit for t1ieir steady, un- rewarded work along this line, and it is certain that the students are glad we have a Band. Despite the opinions of the musical members of the Faculty, we still assert, and assert loudly, that the Band did some splendid work Saturday and was a credit to the college in every way.

l I i .· THE CONCORDIENSIS 23 A REVIEW OF THE FOOTBALL SEASON. By Dr. McComber. The football season of 1913 has becon1e a part of Union's athletic history, and the results from the point of view of the athletic fan are, on tl1e whole, disappoint- ing. The number of games won was, alas, too few, while the teams vvhich were defeated are not the ones best calculated to afford th~ greatest a1nount of satisfac- tion to the supporters of the Garnet teatn. While there were many bright spots in the gan1es with Hobart and Stevens with the splendid open-field running of our backs and the startling effectiveness of 0ur use of the forward pass, still, I believe that the tean1s best football was show·n in the gan1es with the strong \i\1 esleyan and Rochester elevens. In both of these gatnes Union's play, both on offense and defense, was of a high order and gave protnise of the final developn1ent of a tean1 that would be considerably above the average of Gar- net elevens. The disastrous ft11nble which allowed Rochester to score was a fluke due to the n1uddy field and in no sense detracted from the general excellence of the team's work in that game. The absence of Cap- tain Sarvey from the line-up in the last quarter of the Wesleyan game made the speedy Deetjen's progress toward our goal line decidedly less difficult than it other- wise would have been. The decisive victories of the next two garnes gave rise to most hopeful anticipa- tions of a victory over our old rivals at Clinton 111 the final game. Such a victory n1eant everything to Union, while a defeat by Ha1nilton meant a real catastrophy. The unexpected happened. Hamilton played a steady, plucky, consistent game, can1e back after a series of humilitating de- feats and hutnbled the Union team by two touchdowns, and great was the rejoicing in Clinton. ''\Vhat was the matter at Hatnilton ?\ This question has been asked n'lany times since the game. The chief thing which was the tnatter was Hat-uilton's persistent deter- mination to cross our goal line. Hamilton adapted her style of play to the slippery cond]tion of the field, she sntothered the speed of our backs and, presenting a splen- did defense against our forward passing, spoiled all but two of our many atten1pts. It is undoubtedly true that the muddy field \Vas a desided advantage to our opponents, and it was so admitted. On the other hand, the Union team lacked the \punch\ that yields first downs, the blocking and tackling \vas poor, the team work was noi up to standard, and we failed to diagnose our opponents' offensive plays. Hatnilton played better football and deserved to . Wln. Fortut:ately, scores of games are not the only· valuable assets of athletic contests. Including the class teams, over fifty stu- dents have received the benefits of the exercise and the discipline of football at Union this fall. Much excellent material has been discovered for next year. Only two of the 1913 eleven are to graduate next June, and while Captain Sarvey and \Steve\ Story will be greatly missed, we shall have left a splendid nucleus for next year's team. We should learn all we can from the experiences of the past and then direct our n1inds and our energies toward the future. The time to begin to build for next year is now. We have seen a totally inexperi- enced freshtnan develop in six weeks in- to an excellent player, with much pron1ise . for the future. There are. n1any who might : have made good, but did not even try. Vl e have seen fellows out doing their best to aid the team by playing on the scrub. Self-sacrifice and devotion and hard work are the best indications of the real college

' ; 24 THE CON,CORDIENSIS spirit. We have seen a loyal group of over two hundred U Eion students accept humiliating and uae:xpected defeat with such a spirit of tru~ sportsmanship as to evoke the outspoken ~commendation of both the students and the iacuJ.ty of our closest rivals. Verily ther~e is victory in defeat. HOFFMAI\l 'CONCERT. A very entertaini:ng concert was given Tuesday evening in the Chapel, when Miss Grace May Ho&fman, assisted by the Glee Glub, rendered a most pleasing pro- gram to a large au<lie11ce.

The \Hamilton LUe\ said in an editorial last Saturday: '~Of the thirteen gam.es that have been pl_ayed between the rivai colleges on the gridiron there have been . seven victories for Hamilton, two for Union ancl four tie ga.roes.'' In getting that record Hamilton blandly ignores the fact that the two colleges played five games of football previous -to the thirteen men- tioned in the edito1ial As far as they go their figures are correct, but they happen to stop just ahead <l·f the 1894 game, the score of whi~ch was : Union, 96; Hatnilton, 0. The two teams also n1et in 1890, '91, '92 and '93, Union winning three of the four. The complete record of games played between Ha1nilton and Union shDuld read: Games played; 18; Hamilton victories, 8; Union victories,. 6; tied, 4. That is the record, exclusive of the latest Han1ilton victory. In the slang of the day we can only say to \Life\ : \Have a heart.\ THE STEVENS GAME. T'he Stevens ga1ne, the last home ga1ne for the 1913 team, was a case of \drean1s con1e true.\ For several seasons now Union players have been wishing for a chance to \walk all over somebody,\ as one member of the 1911 team put it. The Garnet has won ga1nes during the seasons that this bloodthirsty idea has been the unspoken wish of dozens of young huskies, but the wins have been by narrow mar- gins. It is a fine thing to win a hard- fought battle, but once in a while it is a ren1arkable restorer of self-esteem to be able to \rub it into someone.\ This rub- bing-it-in process was the key-note of the Union-Stevens game. Captain Sarvey and his men celebrated their last appearance on the local gridiro11 by running up a 39 to 7 score against the 1nen from the Jersey Heights. Stevens played a good game- every whit as good as Rochester did two weeks before-b-ut everything seemed to break just right for the Garnet. Forward passes went incredible distances and drop- ped \kerstnash\ right into waiting Union arn1s. Garnet backs and ends displayed a superhun1an ability in diving through a tangled mass of Stevens legs and sorting out the pair that were carrying the ball. Captain Sarvey enjoyed the distinction of crossing the Stevens goal line on four dif- ferent occasions. Girling and Roof, the t\vo fteshtnan backs, each butted into the sun1.mary with a touchdown.

e e e s s e s e e e a e e THE CONCORDIENSlS THA1' HAMILTON ~GAME. The Harn.ilton gan1e-· their classic and our cfassic-was p'layed at 'Clinton on Sat- urday, N o-vernber 15, and. the date is n1arked with a deep black band on the calendar of every loyal Union rooter. It tsn't .so bad to lose sotnething that one never had, but to lose that Hamilton game after it had been conceded a Garnet vic- tory by everyone-that is, by everyone ex- cept Han1.il ton-well, that was a cruel ' cruel blow, indeed. With colors flying, with hearts beating merrily and with songs of victory ~'soon to be\ already on their lips, about 300 professors, alutnni and un- dergrads left Schenectady .on a special for Utica. Thirsting for the expected victory, they shinned up the cliff that seperates Hamilton from the rest of the world and Clinton. Sorne who had been there before cast a knowing eye towards the chapel belfry and rnuttered, \Gee I hope you don't get a chance to ring to-night.\ There is not 1nuch to say about the garne. It was play-ed on a 1n uddy field, through which both teams slipped and floundered. The followers of Captain Robinson were a wee bit b-etter slippers than the wearers of the Garnet. Twice the aforementioned Captain R()binson managed to slip over a certain white mark, there by annexing twelve counts and incidentally slipping one over on Union. We do not know, but we are of the opinion that we have managed to get hold of the short, sticky end of a practical joke. To explain : In the Stev- ens game (joy) Union showed remarkable speed. Speed is one thin~ on a dry field and anotl1er thing on a wet field. Under ordinary a n<i usual autun1nal conditions a rlirt-covere<l field is more likely to be wet and slippery than a sodded field. Now ~n ~ \Vet slippery field a light, but fast, tean1 is handicapped, while a heavy team is still able to us~ its weight to good advantage. Sounds like a recitation in Geo111ett'y, but we are carefuUy approaching our point. Union this season was light and fast. Hamilton was heavy. Hence a wet field would be an asset for the Buff and Blue. At Han1ilton they play baseball on the same field on which they ptay ~football. Next season they are going to- have a \skinned'' diamond at Ha~1nilton. Now ' having led by easy stages to our conclu- sion, let us go back for a rn in:tt.te and sun1 up. A wet field would fa.V()l. I-Iamilton and a dirt-covered field was likely to be wetter and slipperier than a grass-covered one. With these tvvo points firmly in mind and reme1nbering that the diamond occupies certain parts of the football field, kindly read the following frorn \Han1ilton Life,\ published N ovetnber 15: \The work of skinning the baseball dia1nond is almost completed.\ It really looks as though I-Iamilton had two laughs corning, although one must of necessity be sub rosa. If they did skin that diamond just before th.eir big game just to ensnare the elusive plays o£ the Union eleven, by gum we're just about ready to laugh with them, if it is on us. As the Union contingent toiled slowly down the h:ill with colors stiH flying but with hearts that lay like lead, and with the songs of victory still unsung, there came softly stealing through the twilight the pealing of that chapel belL For Ham- ilton it was ringing a merry note, for Union it was tolling. A WORD FROM CAPTAIN SARVEY. The year has been one of surprise and reverses to many teams, and we may vvell include ourselves in that number .. Owing to breaks of all kinds, climatic conditions and injuries, the team did not display the . form of the well-oiled machine that it really was. When the friction lay in the line, the backfield was in perfect condi- tion, and when the line was invulnerable, the backfield was not at its best.

: ; t i j . I .. I ' ' .: ' I ' I I :i t '·' I<\ ! . I 26 THE CONCORDlENSIS To be sure the season did not produce a long list of victories, but to me it does not appear to be an entirely unsuccessful one. The teams we met, with the excep- tion o:£ per haps Wesleyan, were not our superiors, but si1nply the inevitable breaks which may happen to any tea1n struck us and landed us defeat. In the use of the forvvard pass, I think we had the advantage over any of our opponents, but muddy fields all Fa11 checked us to a great extent in open play. But it is far from my inten- tion to offer a word of regret or excuse. The team played its very best every min- ute and learned more football than any team for many seasons past. For the last time, I want to thank the student body for the support given at every game. Though it may not have produced many touchdowns, doubtless it helped a whole lot in staying many oppos- ing advances down ,the field and turned the tide in our favor. Next year, with the exception of t~o men, the squad will be back in its entirety, and with the addition of material from the incomi·ng- class, and with the experience and knovvleclge gained this season under a system that is bot1nd to prove successful, I predict the season of 1914 to be one worthy to initiate the new gridiron on \Alexander Field.\ I wish Fred Dawson and the captain- elect every possible success. D. V. SARVE-'l, '14. COLLEGE SPIRIT VS. DEFEAT. \V e feel that the football season just closed has been productive of something deeper, something with a n1ore irresistible grip, sotnet11ing with longer life than mere victory. \V e do not gainsay the fact that victory is sweet; vve do maintain that at Union there is son1ething that removes the hitter from defeat, not an humble, sub- missive, spirit-btoken acceptance of de ... feat; far from it. Bunker Hill and Bull Run were only beginnings ; behind them ca1ne a driving force that swept every- thing before it. So, too, we feel that this something-this Union Spirit-· com- ing, as it does, not from the temporary stimulating effects of victory, but from the love and loyalty of a body of men for their Aln1a Mater, has behind it a gathering, g-rowing force that cannot ultin1ately be stopped. The men here have realized that their team is not a body of athletes brought in from the outside ·to be their champions on the field. They know that the team is picked from the very fabric of the student body. First of all, a man is a \Union man\; then he is selected to wear the Garnet. Hence, we see the close relation between the team and the college body- each dependent upon the other for moral and physical support, the ideal of each being identical. We all have faith in our institution, and _we love her, and we are bound together by this cotn111on devotion. This belief in our college has produced an irresistible desire to gain for her the best in everything. This desire has finally burst into a demand; and we see this demand taking forn1 in the surging, swell- ing force of our college spirit. A defeat may check the tide momentarily, but noth- ing can withstand its sweeping power when it is fully under way. And already it is gathering to carry the remainder of the academic year to a triumphant close. FRED T. DAVVSON. '17-I hear there was a big fire in one of Princeton's new d'ormatories.

Three concerts have been given. Amster- dam, very good for the first concert of the year. Second, Ballston; people of Ballston said it was best performance ever given by the Club in that place. Last at Scotia; a good concert, hut a very sn1.all audience. The outlook for the Club this year is better than ever before. Competition has been very keen, and a goodly number of freshmen have turned out. Some very good voices, and the work has had more snap and ginger to it than in past years. The n1en keep up their mettle and nerve through a concert, and by so doing make known to the audience that it is a College Glee Club performing, and not a choral society. Good fast, snappy work, with lots of laughable stuff, has been the motto in forming the Club so far this year. A quartette has been organized, consist- ing at present of N anmann, '14, first tenor; De La Vergne, '14, second tenor; Wood, '15, first bass, and Smith, '15, second bass. The prospects are bright for moulding these four into a good quartette, which will add much to our concerts. Light music will be predominant. Much of the credit so far this year has been due to Mr. Mausert, who stands in a class by himself as a Glee Club coach. He has excellent judgment in picking out catchy music suitable for the Club, and his personality adds rnuch pleasure to the work for the fellows. Our chief desire this year is to make the Club mean something to Union Col- lege, and a big advertising medium and drawing-card for next year's class. S. M. SMITH, '15, Leader. THE FOOTBALL SMOKE·R .. About a hundred students were brought together Monday night at the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity house, t.he occasion being a football smoker which the fraternity .gave to all those who have Union football in- tetests at heart. After an informal hour of songs, smoking and refreshments, the boys listened to some short, snappy talks by Captain \Dal\ Sarvey, Coach Dawson, Professor Opdyke, Dr. \Mac \Bill\ Cronkhite, '\'Steve\ Story, Charlie vVald- ron, and Charlie Male. More smokes, songs and \eats\ brought the evening to a close. The custom of smokers is an old insti- tution at Union, but has not been followed out for several years. Monday evening marked the revival of this custom, and it is hoped that it will not be allowed to die out again, for such informal gatherings O'f the students should prove invaluable tn the social life of the college.
