The· Concordiensis VOL. 3'6. JANUARY 15, 1912 No. 10 ROCHESTER 26, UNION 2'5 lnabil:ity to Score Fouls Gives Game to Rochester Friday night, January the tenth, in the Schenectady Armory, Rochester increased its group of victories to three. Cnion's sea- son ca1ne near opening in the same fashion as th~ football season; had it not been for an unfortunate foul in the last 111 inute and a half of play ancl an accurate free thro\v for H .. nchester, the gan1e \vonld have been a tie. \Vhen judg·ing this g:.11ne, \VC n1ust of course, take the abo,,.e fact into consideration, that it \vas Rochester's third appearance and l,.nion's first, so the \'\isitors natnra11y hac1 a l'L'rtain adyantag;~. 1\nother a(h,.antage \Yas rather noticeable; \vhen it ca1ne to a toss up bet\veen t\YO n1cn, the Rochester player \\,.ou1d often 1nake a quick reco, ... ery because of his superior height. The college ban(1 clid its usual g·oocl \York, but the cheering ,, ... as not up to the standard set at the 1912 footrall g-an1es for the si111ple reason that the fL' 11o\YS did 11ot bunch to- .~·ether enoug-h. I-Io\veycr, \vhen the rooters starte(l to give a siren for the tean1 a section uf ~he bleachers broke do\\,.n, tnuch to the amusetnent of all not concerned. houy forg-ot that little i nciclent whistle ble\v fur But every- \Yhen the THE FIRST HA L.F to start at 8:27. The players of both tea1ns beg·an the contest cautiously, and at last Rochester becan1e so cautious that a foul was called for delaying the garne. Union 1nissec1 her free thro\Y, and the ball \vent quickly to De\vey \Yho triecl a long shot \vithout success. 1\ second foul ·was called on Rochester, but again lTnion fail~d to take adyantage. But that \Yas for- gotten \vhen J. Beaver, 1nade the first basket of the season for his tea1n. \Vhen, ho\yeyer, t\VO Garnet players \\Tere on one Rochester 111an, the foul \Vas taken ach,.antage of an(1 the score stood t\vo to one. De\Yey quicklr n1ade it fonr to one, and Foulcls retaliated by adding t\\r() lTIOre pointS. rrhen the \.,.. el}O\\' tried a little shoy-ing, and ·enion again lost her free t11rO\Y. E\·ents beg·an to n1oye n1orL' S\viftly, and D. Beaver neatly dropped the ball in the basket. But to n1ake np for their speed, both tea1ns ,QTe\Y a little ch11nsy and a clonble fonJ \\'\aS called. rfhat ac1dec1 another point to the Rochester score, but De\vey c1 ic1 not 1nake it do the san1e for (Tnion. \\\'hen a personal foul \vas ca11ec1 a n1on1ent later. Beaxer did no better than De\vey. But DL'\Yey and D. Bea\Tr retaliated h~· adc11n.~· t\VO points apiece to the t'\nion t()ta1.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS a similar 1nishap on the part of the local players netted the visitors another point. It be- came evident directly that the Union men were not \vatchi ng their opponents as carefully as they should, for Rochester caged the sphere in the most leisurely n1anner imaginable. But a pass diagonally across the court to Dewey resulted in another addition to the Garnet score, to which Rochester r,eplied by a similar action. Then Beaver and Houghton both scored. The passing for Union becan1e ragged for a tin1e. Beaver surprised every- one by making good on a free thro:vv. I-Ioughton began to follow Schell's example in guarding his n1an carefully. The playing became a bit \vild. Four fouls alternated betvveen De\vey and Rochester, but none \vas utilized. Schell ·was out of the game a fe\v minutes. J. Beaver finished the half by a successful shot. Thus the score stood : Rochester 13, Union 19. But the Garnet had missed eight free throws, \vhich re- minds us sotnc\vhat of a certain ga1ne 1ast year. THE SECOND HALF opened tnost auspiciously for Union. J akc Beaver, in qnick succession, 1nadc t\vo suc- cessful shots, hut the vello\v five did the so1ne thing i1ntncdiately after. T'hcy had been n1aking 1ong shots c1nring the first half, but no\v those long ones can1c n1ore into the litne light than ever. T1H:y had a bit of hard lu~k, for three fine long shots \vobb1ed on the edge of the basket and fell out. But some clever pass \VOrk n1ade the fourth trial a success. A foul for holding -vvas called, but as usual in this ga1ne it did Union no ,g-ood. Union then had a r>eriocl of hard luck exactly like that of Rochester; three fine shots fe11 on the vvrong side of the basket. Dewey was then compe11ed to go out of the game for a fe\v minutes. Shortly after that in- cident, a glance at the score board shovved that four n1ore points had been ac1c1ec1 to Rochest- er's account, a11 on long thrO\\~s. The score \vas a tie. J. Beaver quickly broke the tie hy cagin,e: the spl1crc again. But it \Vas no use. Neary raised his tean1's record by two points. Minute and a half to play ! Foul on Union! Successful free throw! Wood enters the game, but only in time to hear the vvhistle blo\v for the end. The Rochester team gives a college yell of triumph, for the score is 26 to 25 in their favor. The second half be1onged completely to Rochester. Undoubtedly Neary's consistent guarding·, long shots, and pass \vork made him, tl1c Rochester star, Both Beavers clio the1 r usual g-ooc1 \vork. De\\rey made three good baskets. Houghton made a brilliant sh()t. Schell guarded \vell but made no scorL'. However, considering that this was the first ganle, the playing of the team, with the ex- ception of free thro\vs, \vas exce11ent.

The student body recently voted:, upon the recon1menda tion of our Athletic J3 oard, to the effect that Union resum.e athlebc relations with Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst;i tute. For a nun1ber of years past, tnese two in- stitutions l1ave not battled for ath1e~Hc suprem- acy owing to causes ''rh ich are no1v history and a11 but forg-otten. The t\YO coBegcs have endea Y()Tec1 for a number of yen_rs to 11nite the broJ<en bonds, ln1t it \vas only lnJelr that this was tnade pos- sible through the efforts of Prof. 1-rtJ. L. Robb, of the R. P. I., ancl Dr. Mc;Cornber, of l T • '111011. That lTnion stuc1ents \Verc hea.rtnyin favor of such, \vas self evident fron1 the recent yote taken on the subject in co11ege meeting·. Both of these o1d ti1ne honored institutions are to be cong-ratn1 1 ated for this )€arty and unselfish actioil, for certainly t\vo colleg-es, so closely related in a geographical \vay, can onlr acccnnp1ish b~st re:;ults thro~t.~h friendlr 1)(mc1s. \Vm.

The Sohee and the Prom are two of the best, if not the very best dances of the year. Junior Week is the recogni~ed social season of the coDeg-e year as is evident from the fact , that the faculty sets apart the \Yveek end for this p1n·pose. It ~ is possible that the faculty might reca11 this favor if they believed that too :£e\v students ,,,.ere taking advantage of it. These hops, cotning as they do so early in the term: a \vcek earlier than usua1, ·will notal- lo\V the argutnent of interference ·with college \vork.

It's too soon after Christ1nas vacation to go home ag-ain and if yon rea11 y must sec her, have her co1ne and enjoy tl1e dances \vith you. It is a splendid means of retnrn- in,Q,· social cotnp1iments and \vi11 form in your 111emory a happy epoch to \vhich, during- the remainder of the year, and even long·cr, yon \vi111ook back ·with pleasure. ----:0:--- THE LITERARY CONTEST The conditions of the Prize Contest 1n literary articles appear again i11 this issue. Lack of acquaintance with these conditions, press of \vork and social attractions at this tin1e of the year probably account for the small nun1ber of contributions received hitherto. The first article accepted appears in another part of this issue. The fact that th,is is a lnetri- cal effort should not i1nply that this forn1 of literature is more desirable than pTose articles. In fact it is probable that poe111 articles will be very fe\V. rfhe form of one 1 S effort is quite unli1nited and literary excellence is the prin1e requisite. It is hoped tl1at this tern1 ·will \Vitness a decided gro\vth oi interest in the con11)etition that DL Richtnoacl' s gcnerons offer has n1ade possible. .MISSION CLASSES ORGANIZED The usual Mission Study courses of the winter are being held on Tuesday evenings frorn 7:00 to 8:00 P.

Beaver, Hesselin right forward Whirlwind Finish and !Union's Inability to Score on Free Calder Throws Bring Defeat-- The Beaver Twins Make a left forward D. Beaver Saccessful Debut in Varsity B-all. G 'ffi. n-n Hequembourg center The whirlwind finish by the visitors proved to be Canfield Union's ''finish\ in the two home games last week. In right guard Fairbairn both the game with St. Lawrence and the one with Rochester the Garnet held their own during the first half and closed the first twenty minutes with several points in the lead. A brace by their opponents, and in the game with Rochester the inability to gain points on free throws lost the two games. The St. Lawrence Game St. Lawrence played here on Thursday and won by the score of 26 and 15. The Canton five came to Schenectady after winning a string of honorable vic- tories in New York and vicinity and it was with the greatest confidence that they lined up against the Gar- net. It did not take the visitors long; however, to realize that the game was not to be a walkover. Union played rings around them for a few minutes and scored with little difficulty. Greater weight of the St. Lawrence men was found to be a big disadvantage for Unicn and this was seen in the second half when, towards the last of the game, the visiting five turned the tatles on their opponents and cut circles around the Garnet. A rapid succession of scoring quickly rolled the score up to several points in the lead and then St. Lawrence tried to play for time. Union was right on their heels. however, and it kept the leading t€am on the move to prevent the loss of their advan- tage in points. Calder, for St. Lawrence, gave a splendid exhibition of free throwing, scoring seven points by this means. He also made the total score for his team in the first half by tallying three field baskets. The Beavers, freshmen, played excellent ball for Union. The twins are much the same in general appearance and conse- quently were somewhat of a puzzle to theif opponents, who frequently became confused in picking their man. The line up and summary follows. Logan Coward left guard Summary: Score-St. Lawrence, 26; Union, 15. Score, end first period-Union,. 10; St. Lawrence, 8. Baskets-}, Beaver, 3; D.

Union outplayed the visitors in all branches of the game. Rochester took advantage of the fact that Union could not make the fouls count and piled up a total of 14 misplays, many of which robbed the Gar- net of baskets without th~ compensation of a point on a free throw. The game was remarkably free from rough work and showed basketball at its best. The Garnet five showed up well, the two Beavers giving every indication of developing into remarkable forwards. The shooting of Union's forwards and the fast work of Neary for Rochester were the most noticeable features, but the defensive work of the Garnet backs and centre also deserves mt>ntion.

Waldron, a ·member of the class of 1848, died at his home in Waterford, Sunday after- noon. Mr. Waldron was one of the most loyal sons of Union and his love and enthusiasm for his Alma Mater is shown by the fact that since his graduation he has failed to attend but two commencements. His absence on these occasions were unavoidable. In one instance he was prevented because of an important session of Surrogate's Court and once he had a motion on in · court which he could. not induce his opponents to put over in spite· of the fact that he offared to pay aU costs incidental to the postpcmement. For many years the commencen1ent exercises have been looked upon as complete only by the presence of Mr. Waldron. Last year his erect figure little showed his eighty-two years and it was inspiring to see hhn marching in line at the alumni dinner, the single rep- resentative of the class of '48. His just pride was un- bounded when he received the cheers of his brother alumni of more recent years and the visitors, who watched him parade with the others hol:ling high his card reading Class '48. Madame Gluck, the MetrJ- politan Opera singer, was among the many to com- ment upon his bearing rand hi3 rnany years as @.11 alumnus, when she realized th~ span of years that marked the time since his graduation. Mr. Waldron was born in Lansingburg, July 23, 1829, and went to Waterford in 1830. He wa3 educated for college in the cld Waterford Academy and ent2rcd Union in 1846, graduatin~ in July, 1848. He took 1:1p the practic:; of law and has been a prominent member of the County bar throughout his life. He has hc:ld many offices and was a n1ernbE:r of nearly a score of secret orders, honorary societie3 and other organiza- tions. In 1856 he was married to IVIiss Caroline M. Waite, by whom he is survived, and also one dal:lgh- ter, Mrs. John D. Sherer, and cne son, Frank A. Wal- dron.

SPEER TO SP~AK AT UNV'ElLING OF TABLET It has been announced by the committee in charge that Robert E. Speer will be one of the chief speak- ers at the unveiling of the tablet to Samuel :N ott, on February 20th. Although the other speakers have not been secured, the committee is in communicaticn with several prominent men and will announce the complete list later. WILL CARLETON STORIES When Will Carleton, the poet and lecturer, was a guest of the Schenectady Pre3s Club recently he en- tertained the gathering informally by relating anec- dotes that had come within his personal experiences. Mr. Carleton is a 1nember of the Authcrs' Cluh in New York. Here may be found a group of 1 eaders in liter£;tture. Some of the members were discussing the scarcity of good short stories. Henry Mills AldeD. editor of Harper's Monthlf, in speaking of it said, \It is hard to get short stories to-8.ay, that is, good short stories; but WE get them\. A wit took advantage of the opening and slyly a.sked, \But Alden, what do you do with then1'~? Later the subject of present-day ignorance came up and Mr. Carleton told of a case of almost inconceivable lack of knowledge. A man of mature years recently witnessed for the first time a production of Hamlet. He was deEply interested in the tragedy and later said that the scenery was wonderful \But who\ he asked, \put the r;lay together\? When tcli that it was one of Shakespeare's plays he said, \I never heard of this n1an before, but whoever he is, he has a bright future ahead cf him\.

From Saratoga the cars will go to Glens Falls and thence to Lake George arriving at the Fort William Henry hotel about six o'clock. Coffee and sandwiches will be immediately served and then the outdoor recre- ation will be enjoyed.

To do away with hazing seems to be striking a blow at one of the traditional customs of colleges. To non-college men and perhaps to some of the older alumni, whose memories of college life declines with their increasing age, hazing seems absurd and an evidence of the \cad age\. Of course hazing may be carried to excesS when it might easily become an objectional side of college life because of the danger of bodily injury to freshmen. Properly regulated, however, hazing is not only harmless but is in reality a benefit. It puts a much needed restraint upon the members of the entering class, who begin the college course with an .ex- alted idea of their own importance. The loss of direct home influence, new environment, and self-responsibility all tend to give free rein to first year

THE CON!CORDIENSIS men, while hazing, with the rules and restrictions connected with it, tend to put a check on the conduct of the bnt recently graduated schoolboy. A change in the head :of the job department of THE CONCORDIENSIS publication office is responsible for the delay in the appearance of the paper. It rs expected that no further irregularities will occur. Junior Week is to begin February 8. Don~t forget it is your pleasurable duty to help make the event its customary success. ·~.~.· ~~ A trip to Lake George is a novelty in the Junior Week program. Those wno have never seen the \Lucerne of America'' could never have a better opportunity. With Other Colleges Princeton and Syracuse have added compulsory swim- vcing to their curriculums. The University of Cali- fornia is building a running trac1{ which will cost $20,.000. 1'he University of Wiscon- . sin has abolished gymnasium for the freshmen and sub- stituted compulsory football. Colum.bia has the largest enrollment of any Atnerican university this fall. Harvard, Y ~~le and Princeton all have a larger registration in the entering class than last year. Rowing will probably be instituted at the University of Virginia in the near future, as a plan is now on foot to build a lake similar to Prin- ceton's at an approximate cost ·of $50,000. Cclumbia's popularity in China is evidenced by the record-breaking number of 45 Chinese undErgraduates at the university this year. Wesleyan has an annual athletic tax of $15 which every undErgraduate ts re- quired to pay. The two Cornell publica- tions have decided to elimi- nate liquor advertisements. -Union-Star. Rutgers is having its trials in organizing a dramatic club. Two years have been spent in fruitless efforts along the line. Union was longer in perfecting its or- ganization but now has one to be proud of. We wish Rutgers success. The Juniors at the Univer sity of California, have gone back to the old custom of wearing derbies (which they call \Beanies\) on all occas- · lOllS. At the German universi- ties last year the enrollment totaled 54,678 men and 2,552 women. The largest univer- sities stand in the following order with respect to num· bers: Berlin, Munich, and Leipsic. With the official opening of its new building, the PriJ.ce- ton University Press recently observed the one hundred and twenty-fifth anniv~rsary of printing at Princeton. The new structure, erected and equipped at a cost of $125,- 000, was presented by Char- les Scribner, publisher, of the class of '75. 11

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS ·- ================================================================================= UNION DEFEA 'TS ST. LA WREN,CE PRESIDENT RlCHMON,D HAS IN D,EBATE HELD AT CANTON MANY ENGAGEMEf'4:TS AHEAD Seven Hundred Peop'le :Hear Arguments For and Against Sherman Law-Decision o.f Judges Unani- mous in Favor o·f Visiting Debaters-Professor McKean Addresses St. Lawrence Students. President Richmond will be busy for the next few weeks, as r.is plans for speeches at alumni meetings and dinners are extensive. On January 18 Union won the first debate with St. Lawrence University at Canton. The debate wa-3 held in the town hall and about seven hundred towns people and students were present. The members of the team were entertained at the fraternity houses and every possible attention was shown them. Pro- fess?r McKean accompanied the team. On the morn- ing following the debate he gave an address in the chapel to the students. The question debated was: Resolved that the Sher- man Anti-Trust Law should be repealed. St. Law- rence held the affirmative and Union the negative. The teams were: St. Lawrence-William E. French, '13; Wright W. Huntley, '12; Harry F. Landon, '13. Alternate, Louis D. Schwartz, '12. Union-Herbert Mann, '13; Kenneth Walser, '12; James H. Potter, '12. Atlernate--Roy W. Peters, '12. The Rev. Almon Gun- nison presided. The judges were: Judge Joseph Mc- Connell, Watertown; Hon. F. E. Cubley, Potsdam; Prof. C. Michell, Potsdam. The decision was by ballot and was unanimously in favor of the negative. The first speaker for the affirmative told of the benefits derived from large combinations in business and stated that the law should seek to regulate, not to destroy them. The second speaker endeavored to show the defects of the Sherman Law which, he said, was inadequate and indefinite. The third speaker proposed a system of trust regulation by a business court, modelled after the Interstate Commerce Com- mission and by voluntary federal incorporation. The first speaker for the negative gave a brief his- tory of the law and showed the effect upon it of the various Supreme Court decisions. The second speaker spoke of the underlying principles of the law and en- deavored to show that they were sound and just and that the law had been effective. The third speaker proposed amendments and supplementary laws to remedy the defects of the present act. In rebuttal the advantage was decidedly with the negative. They were able to admit many of the ob- jections of the affirmative. They pointed out that no very serious defects in the law had been brought up and attempted to show that all the objectionable features could be overcome by amendment or supple- mentary legislation. On january 22 he spoke at the dinner of the \Men and Religion\ movement in Schenectady at which about 200 will be present. The following day he was present at the Trustees' meeting, and in the \ evening he was one of the speakErs at the dinner of the University Club of Albany at the TenEyck Hotel. On January 25 the President will attend the dinner of the Burns Club in Albany. On January 30 the din- ner at the University Club of New York City given by Dr. James Alexander for President Hibben of Prince- ton will occur at which Dr. Richmond will be present. On February 1 the President will be a speaker at the dinner of the Union College Alu1nni Association of PhiladElphia, and on February 3 at the dinner of the Union Ccllege Alumni Association of Washington. On February 7 he will speak at the Elks' dinner in Amsterdam, and on February 8 will deliver an address before the Albany Historical Society. On February 9, Dr. Ri:hmond will attend an in- formal dinner in Schenectady given by the Journal Club, composed of schocl principals. On February 12 he will be a speaker at a dinner in New York City given by the Graduates' Club at which President Taft will be present. On February 22, Dr. Richmond will speak at Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Penn.

Considerable ac- tivity is now being shown towards putting out a win- n1ng football team for next year. The Graduate Coun- cil has taken the matter in hand and is now endeavor- ing to solve the .coaching problem. It is hoped to es- tablish a permanent graduate coaohing system by which the regular coaches will be assisted by the coaching of the younger alumni who have been foot- ball men of ability during their college course. Many students are attending the meetings held by the \Men and Religion\ movement during the week. i I' l ·.; I i. :I, I

., 14 THE CONCORDIENSIS SUGGESTIONS C:ONCERNIN,G CLASS ORGANIZATI'ON Study the Class Roll, learn all you can about the for Class needs. Make a little list and send to each a personal letter as~i!lg for a larger sum. men, and pick out five for the Executive Committee. This is the most important part of the j.ob. Get those who will best supplement the Class Of- ficers, who are ex-officio members of the Committee. Some good counselors and some good givers are de- sirable. Prmnptness is more important than nearby residence. Carbon copies of communications can easily be made for all the Committee, and all sorts of Class questi0ns have been satisfactorily discussed and settled by this method. If there have been factions, try to have them represented, but avoid drones any- how. If the Class has no President or Vice-President to appoint the Five, let its G. C. mall do it. Notify the new Committee that the Class .ts organ- ized under the G. C. plan, giving names and addresses of the Officers and the Five.

ARE DEFEATED BY THE GARNET The f.ormer at WiUiamstown Fall with Score 25~19 -The Latter Eruily Vanquished on Home Court The following account of the Union- Williams bas- ketball gan1e was printed in the Williams Record January 2'5: Williams lost to the Union basketball team in the Lasell Gymnasium last night by the score of 25 to 19. This is the first .defeat of the present season and the fourth which a Purple five has sustained since 1908. Poor guarding on the part of the Williams forwards enabled Union to gain a lead of six points in the first half, and every attempt of the home team to consist- enly maintain an offensive position in the second per- iod proved futile. The Purple five was noticeably weakened by the absence of Freeman whose consist- ent co-operation in team play was by no means du- plicated. Ragged passing, uncertain shooting, and a decided lack of aggression characterized the play of the Williams team. Their opponents demonstrated particular superiority in team work and in constantly retaining possession of the ball. Union assumed the ofiensive at the beginning of the contest. Coward scored first on a foul and Victor's tally gave the Purple only a temporary lead. Well- earned- baskets by Houghton and Dempsey followed in the . order named. The Union tea1n at this time had little difficulty in evading the Williams defense, Hequembourg and Coward scoring six points in rapid succession, the latter tallying twice. D. Beaver se- cured the next basket from a clos.ely-guarded position a.1d the visitors' score was nine points greater than Williams' after the two-minute intermission. Wallace started the play with a long, sensational basket from the middle of the floor. This was followed by a similarly successful throw by Nagle. Coward then made his last tally of the period frmn an easy, un- guarded position, and Houghton's second basket ended Union's scoring for that half. Wetherell scored on a tarow from the foul line. Both teams scored five baskets in the second half Coward tallied first for the visitors but Victor took the 1 hall down the floor a few seconds later for his second :basket. The play increased in speed and brilliant 'Shots by Houghton and Wallace followed each other in quick succession. Poor guarding made possible a second tally by Beaver but Nagle's clever shot from a toss-up left the score 21 to 15 at the middle of the half. After Hequembourg's easy goal, Wether ell made a peculi~rly successful shot from a difficult angle. The Union center tallied last for his five from a closely- guarded position and Victor ended the scoring with a clean basket.

Earl Weller The Var~·ity basketball five did not have to extend themselves to defeat the: M. I. T. quintette by a score of 23 to 11. The Garnet took the lead at the very out- set of the game and were never headed. The visitors played a cbse guarding garne and were holding almost constantly, their aim bting to hold the score as low as possible. Schar was the \star\ of the Massachusetts f1ve, scoring nine of their eleven points. Freedman al:3o played a good game for the visitors. The fact that the Garnet players were not hard pressed at any point of the game had the effect of rather slowing the game. There were flashes of fast playing, however, when the Varsity demonstrated their ability along the lines of passing and shooting

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS One especially brilliant piece of work occurred early in the first half when Coward, Hesselin and D. Beaver worked the ball up under the M. I. T~ basket by the snappiert sort of short passes. Union's defense was almost an unpassable barrier to the M. LT. forwards and few indeed were the shots afforded the visitors. The Garnet players on the other hand were shooting at will and i:t was only the way luck broke that kept the score at 23 points. Individually all the Union players were on a par. The two Beavers continued their good work at for- wards. Coward came into his own again in the mat- ter of free tries and also contributed two field goaLs to the score. :Hequembourg, Hesselin and Houghton ex- perienced little difficulty in outplaying their respective opponents. Houghton rather resented the holding tac- tks of the M. I. T. man that was pitted against him. and had two personal fouls called on him for his .ef- torts to discourage the aforementioned holding.

T!HE LAKE GEORGE TRIP All Wishing To Be On First Car Leaving Schenectady Should See Garnsey, '13, Immediately There .seems to have been some misunderstanding in connection with the trip to Lake Gecrge during :the Junior Week festivities. 'Fhe plans include a total ex- pense of $6.85 per couple. This includes carfare, lunch and dinner at the Fort William Henry hotel, and the use of the toboggans, .skates, snowshoes, etc., at the hotel. There will be absolutely no further ex- pense .connected with the trip. There can scarcely be a more reasonable expense for the closing evening of the week. Even a theater party with a supper after will exceed the total cost of the Lake George trip. The pleasure of the ride to the lake and the enjoyment of the Adirondacks in winter should be the greatest of inducements to both those who are familiar with the beauties of Lake George and those who are still strangers to this region. It is fully intended to run one car to the lake and possibly more. Because a few fellows have other plans for Saturday evening there is no reason why the rest cannot enjoy the moonlight excursion to the lake. The trip is still on. It would be advisable to see Garnsey at once so as to have a place reserved for you on the first car. Those who have planned other arrange- ments for that evening have tried to keep the trip from going through by consistent knocking. If you cannot take in the trip why try to discourage others from enjoying it?

The game Saturday night in the armory was but a poor exhibition of the game at its best, but the fact that Union won with twelve points in the lead helped to cover up the slowness of the contest. The M. I. T. men seemed to have but little idea of the game as now played and even when in possession of the ball and a clear field ahead they could not follow up their ,....,. advantage. Union played consistently and showed excellent form. Coward \came back\ in the free try sphere and added materially to the total score. The season in basketball is still young. Union's winning ability seems to have returned and the successful season anticipated will doubtless be realized.

= THE CONCORDIENSIS . . . Public sentiment will. influence the majority of peopl.~. I_t is the same principle upon which mob psychology is based, -n~m.ely, the power of sugges- - . . - . .. . . ~ . .. tion. This is seen daily in the life ·of every human being.. . When the senti- ment is constructive it should be expressed; but more frequently the senti- ment of the public is destructive. Selfishness and the ''dog in the manger~'­ attitude often enter into the desire to influence public opinion. Thus we have the \knocker'' incarnate. No one wishes to be called a knocker yet there are but few students who fall without the sphere of that word. A strik- ing example of knocking with the ''dog in the manger'·' attitude is the action of many students in regard to the Lake George trip for Junior Week. Un- fortunately the trip was planned after some had made arrangements for other events for the time scheduled for the excursion to the lake. There are, however, scores of fellows who would be glad to take the trip, but who have been deterred from expressing their opinion because of the general knocking fest on the part of those who will be prohibited from enjoying the event bec1use of conflicting plans. Misunderstanding in regard to the trip has been spread abroad with the intention of dampening the enthu- siam. A continual undercurrent of criticism of the Junior Week committee for trying the plan has been felt on every side. It has been shown that the expense on the trip will be less than theater parties and suppers and less than a dozen or more other evening pleasures. It can be put through and the Junior Week of February 8-9-10~ 1912, will long be remembered as introducing an innovation in the regular program. If the knockers will kindly refrain from the expression of ad verse opinion the students body will be relieved of a no slight burden. If you cannot make the trip don't endeavor to put it out of reach of those who wish to enjoy it. The special issue of THE CoNCORDIENSIS for Junior Week will appear Friday or Saturday of next week in order to cover as many of the week's events as possible. ~n the College World Australia will send an eight- oared shell crew to the Olyp· ian games in Stockhdm, Sweden, next summer. Fifty-six foreigners are numbered among the under- gni:O.uates at 'the University : . . .. of Louisiana. Porto Rico, w{tlt::.tw.enty-six, has the lar- gest number, while Cuba comes next with seven. There are many students working their way through th~ various colleges. Among these institutions Columbia has made a record for the amount of money earned by its students. The employ- ment bureau of Columbia which secures work for stu- dents states that Columbia students earned more than $75,000 last year. Students tried thei~ hand at every kind of employment from acting as a secretary to a National Reform Board down to laying bricks. Nearly one- half of the total earnings by the students were made during the sum- mer vacation of 1910 when the students earned $7,877.94 with the aid of the com- mittee, and $24,438.61 with- out its aid. The students made $43,392.40 during the -academic year. 11 -· 1

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS DR. MUNSTERBERG BEGINS SERIES OF EIGHT LECTURES Plan of Procedure in Course Explained--New Psy .. chblt>gy in 1878~Future- Lectures On Monday evening in his first of eight lectures on applied psychology to be held in the college under the Ichabod Spencer lecture fund Dr. Hugo Munsterberg, professor of. psychology at Harvard, addressed a large audi~ence made up of students and Schenectadians. Dr. Munsterberg explained his position in accepting the invitation to deliver the series, stating that he carefully considered the course that he would follow in the lectures. There were three possible methods of procedure he said and after eliminating the discourse of theoretical psychology and the relation of psy · chology to philosophy, as subjects that have been dis- cussed for generations, that he would turn to a side of the subject that is new each day, namely the phase of the study known as applied psychology. The speaker talked only in a general way on the subject at hand diverging at times with personal in- cidents that have come under his own observation that related to his work along psychological lines. ln the course of his remarks he arraigned the press for the misrepresentation of facts. Throughout the lecture Dr. Munsterberg explained the purpose of his future lectures. He said that there is now no field that psy · chology will not touch and that the investigation along all lines has advanced in far greater proportion in the past generation than in many generations previous. In 1878 was the inception of the new psychology. In that year the first laboratory work in this science was established. \I have not the slightest doubt,\ said Dr. Munsterberg, \that twenty years hence every insti- tution of learning will provide a laboratory for ex- perimental psychology.\ On Tuesday evening Dr. Munster berg gave the second lecture of the series. This was too late to be covered for this issue of THE CONCORDIENSIS. The other lectures will occur February 5 and 6, February 19 and 20, and March 4 and 5. The lectures are open to the public. SPEAKERS FOR FEBRUARY 20th Dr. George Alexander, Union '66, Robert E. Speer, and Brewer Eddy, .will be among the speakers at the unveiling of the tablet in memory of Samuel Nott, one of the first five missionaries to leave America. The unveiling will take place in the chapel February 20. PROF. STOLLER TELLS OF GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS Last Friday evening Professor Stoller lectured be .. fore the students and a number of Schenectadians. Professor Stoller opened by giving an outline of the structural geology of the region about Schenectady, which gave the chronological order of the rocks in the various ages. This was followed with lantern slides il- lustrating what had been given in words. He next gave an account of the Glacial period as af- fecting the geography of this section. An interesting point was the post-glacial lake, Lake Albany, as it is now known, which extended from the gap in the hills just north ·of Schenectady on the west to the present Hudson River on the east, and from Rhinebeck on the south to Fort Edward on the north. The ice sheet in receding to the northward formed a dam across the natural outlet for the water and thus a lake was formed. Fragments of many different kinds of rocks can be found around here which were broken off fron1 their natural formations and brought down and left by the ice. Professor Stoller gave considerable attention to the various kinds of fossils which can be found in the rock native to this section. The many outcrops of the large beds of Trenton Limestone give ample oppor- tunity for one so minded to obtain many good speci- mens of the various representative types of fossils found in that formation. He showed many interest- ing slides illustrating the various types of fossils found in the Trenton Limestone. ·~ DAY OF PRAYER SERVICE The Day of Prayer service at Union College was held January 25 in the chapel. The service was well attended by students and townsfolk. President Rich- mond, Rev. Fred W. Adams, Rev. Thorntcn A. Mills, and Dr. Hugh Black took part in the service. The service was opened with a hymn. Rev. Mills then read a passage of scripture which was followed by a prayer offered by Rev. Adams. President Richmond then introduced Dr. Black, in a few appropriate words, mentioning the fact that three years previous he had talked over the matter of ac- cepting the presidency of Union College with· Dr. Black, who had urged him to do so. \For that reason,'' said Dr. Richmond, HI always connected Dr. Black with Union Ccllege and hope that his acquaintance with us will cause a deeper interest in all that he does, now that we have had the oppor- tunity to meet him.\

This rule shall ap· ply whether the student has completed his examina· tion or not, and shall hold within and without the ex· amination room during the entire Hme in which the Dr. Black's remarks were very pointed and his whcle discourse was an appeal to the student to really un;derstand the spirit of the college and live up to its lofty ideals. His fundamental argument was that students comprised the only really privileged class, and that everything they received was at great sacri· examination is in progress; that is, until the time fice in the lower ranks of life. He therefore pointed specified has expired. out the necessity for the student to n1ake his course Art. V, Sece 1 (proposed to read}: No student shall of life unselfish and noble, in the service of others. With the text: \Y e know not what spirit ye are of,\ Dr. Black showed how impossible it~as to define any- thing to meet universal acceptance. He showed that the most vital and lasting conditions of life: environ· ment, heredity, and the past, are intangible and vague. From this he urged that no one allow himself to be swerved from meeting the religious i~ssue in thinking that religion was vague and impractical, since it could not be laid down in black and white. 0 CONSTITUTION AMENDMEN·TS PROPOSED FOR HONOR SYSTEM The Honor System as it exists to-day i~ the work of th.e Terrace Council of the Class of 1909, and was unanimously adopted by the student body. This being the case, its ultimate success or failure depends en· tirely upon the attitude of the undergraduates toward it. For some time past there have been evidences of an increasing laxity in the observance of the Consti· tution of the Honor System. After considerable deliberation the Honor Court has arrived at the conclusion that the trouble is due mainly to the ignorance of a large number of the stu· dents concerning the Honer System. Too many do not realize that it is entirely a student affair; that the faculty had nothing to do with it at its inception other than to approve of it. Perhaps this belief is somewhat natural as each succeeding class comes less and less in touch with tl;lose who were in college at the time it was adopted. In order to bring the Honor System to each man as a personal affair of his own and to keep his duties in connection with it before him, the Court has submitted several amendments to the Constitution to be acted upon next week by tl.-le student body. They are as follows: Art. I, Sec. 1 (proposed to read): In order to make his examination or test valid, each student shall at the end of his paper sign the following declaration: I be admitted to ally examination in Union College un· tit he shall have d.uly affixed his signature to the copy of the Constitution to be kept in the records of the court. (Also, to be recommended to the faculty for approval). a $5,00·0 TOWARDS GYM It was announced at the winter term meeting of the Board of Trustees of Union College held at Albany last Tuesday that a gift of $5,000.00 had been received f.or the gymnasi l!lrn fund. The donor was not named. A resolution was also passed by the Board endorsing still further the gymnasium project with the latest modifications and changes. With this latest gift and with others that may be expected soon, the outlook for a gym in the near future seems much more promising.

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS COLLEGE MEN AS WRITERS The statements recently made by Owen Johnson to the effect that college men are poorly represented in the world of letters seems to be contradicted by the following statistics, says the Yale New·s. ·It was found that· from a list of 759 American authors, 58 per ·Cent. were graduates of colleges. In making these lists an effort has been made to classify the anthors in to three groups: writers of fiction, essayists (in which class were included writers of travel), and writers on scientific subjects. From this latter category were excluded compilers of text books and such authors who wrote solely for men of their own profession, and not for the general public. Of college graduates, 159 were writers of fiction, 256 essayists, and 27 of scientific artides. Of those who did not go to college there were 176 essayists, 120 novelists, and 24 writers of science. Harvard leads the other colleges with 83 authors. Of these, 51 were essayists, while 28 were writers of fiction. The leadership of Harvard may be due to the particular emphasis laid on good writing there and on the importance Harvard puts on daily theme writing. Harvard's novelists are not so well known as her es- sayists; prominent among the latter may be mentioned Henry James. Yale is easily second with a total of 28 well known authors. Of these, 10 are novelists~ while 28 are es- sayists. A THiLETIC BOARD MEETS The·Athletic Board niet Wednesday evening, Janu ary 24th, at which time a committee was appointed to look ,into the matter of a football coach for the corning season.

In it he says: \There are three kinds of reporters in just about every metropolitan shop. There is the old time news· paper man, who has often sprouted up from an office boy; shrewd, careful men, who can write convincing, straight-forward stories and whose news sense is the despair of the youngster just out of college. There is the college man wTio isn't sure whether he wants to stay in the game permanently, but who is going to learn to write if hard work will do it. And there is Next in order come those who were educated solely the college man who is con'iinced that he is a litera- in foreign universities. They number 2 2, most of · teur. He approaches the job casually as a dilletante; whom were students in the great German universities. Twelve are essayists, seven writers of fiction, and three of science. Then follow Columbia with 17, Pennsylvania with 16, University of Michigan, 14; Am- herst and Cornell, 12; Princeton and Williams, 11; Dartmouth, 7, and Brown with six authors. In every case but one the essayists outnumber the novelists, the exception being Williams, with seven novelists, three essayists, and one writer on scientific topics. A surprising number of writers are graduates of the smaller colleges of this country. The small Eastern colleges have a representation of 45 authors of novels, 65 essayists, and 24 on science. The Western repre- sentation is smaller, with 34, 43, and four in fiction, essay, and scientific writing, respectively. Of the above graduates of colleges, only 17, or a little less than 4 per cent. are members of Phi Beta Kappa, and of these, seven are writers of fiction. Dr. Tom James, medical missionary to West Africa , gave an interesting talk before the student body at chapel Monday noon. he wanders in and out of the office with a condescend- ing smile on his face and the works of an obscure Victorian poet, between limp covers, in his side pocket. He a~ks you whtth<:r ycu like that poet's \Lines on a Young Lady's Forehea<i\ and he's surprised when you can't place it. He grows a waxed moustache. He wonders how long it will be before the boss realizes that he knows infinitely more about the Drama than the critic. He points out the faults in the best re- porters' work and he can't understand why his josh stories are thrown on the floor. And as a newspaper man he's a stranger to efficiency. Men like that drift into the offices, bask awhile in the sunshine of their own optimism and finally droop and wither. What they don't r 2alhe is that if it's worth doing at all it's worth doing to the limit of a man's ability. They fail to see th.1t there's nothing casual about the newspaper busi.1ess, that there's no such thing a~ \wandering aro and looking for news\ and \absorbing the atmosph=re of the office\ without work. They think a st; le is going to come out and shake hands

They overlook the value of the small, detailed, straightaway stories as guides to news sense. Like many others they don't see that everything is done by assignment, that everything is definite and accurate as it is il). any other business. They don't ·know that at least three requisites are the ability to call a few of the principles of rhetoric by their first names, the willingness to work harder than they ever thought they could work, and the assump- tion that the truth is what the newspaper wants.\ A number of Yale graduates have started a move- ment to raise the funds necessary to erect a memorial to the late President Noah Porter. The amount of money needed wiU be at least $15,000, and contri- butions will be received not only from Yale alumni but also from friends of Dr. Porter. .. Steefel Bros.
