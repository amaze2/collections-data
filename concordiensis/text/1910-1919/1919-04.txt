Some of us pride ourselves on our convictions when perhaps we should speak of our opinions or our prejudices or even our obses- sions. There is a difference. A man with true convictions is not static; he is dynamic. He in- spires in others opinions that har- monize with his convictions. Most people have not mental or emotional energy enough to con- vert their opinions in-to convic- tions. The Moving-Up Day scraps have finally been arranged to take place from 6:45-7 o'clock in the morning of that eventful day. The scrap commit- tees of the two lower classes have agreed that no one of either class will be forcefuly abducted before the scraps, as is the usual custom. The scraps will be strictly confined to to the fifteen minute period, and paint wiH be in evidence. The contest promises to be bitterly waged, because it is the \rubber as it were, since the Sophs trimmed the Frosh to a frazzle in the fall scraps, while the tables were turned on them at the time of the unusually success- ful Frosh banquet.

The members of the Graduate Conn- dl have broken the ice this morning in preparation for the biggest com- mencement in Union's history--'a war commencement. While class reunions and other alumni activities at this time of the year seem to hold but little of interest to the undergraduate, this is on·e commencement when as many of the students who can do so should remain. Many of the former members of the college are coming thousands of miles for this event and it is hardly asking too much of the stude11ts to remain those few short days to welcome home the older ones. Union isn't a college with her student hody absent and her fraternity houses closed. Regardless of how many alumni return, there is a space here which only the life and spirit of the undergr:aduate can fill. He ought to be here to give vent to the renewed spirit of Union. He must be here to cheer on the team, to make some noise in the stunts, to welcome back former members of his fraternity. He is the connecting link between the col- lege of the !)ast and the college of the presel'lt. His presence is next to in- dispensable if the best results of the efforts now being made are to be real- ized. Rushing. Rushing is usu.ally looked upon as ;t purely fraternal activity. On the other hand there is such a thing as rushing men for Union and it is more or less the duty of every loyal student to urge yotmg men whom he knows would be an asset to the college, to enter ur> next fall. ·There remain about six weeks o·f college-unques- t;onably the six weeks of the year when Union is most favorably pre- sented hy its natural endowments. Of a]! months, May is Union's tushing season,-th e time when every one is attracted by the beauty of the campus. It is also .a time when many students coming from preparatory schools will he looking around without having any definite notion of what they are going to do. If the student finds a good pm=tioil a-railable he may take that-if not he mi~ht come to college. If he is a good man Union wants him, anrl if he is told some things he will want Union, Phi Beta Kappa key than a letter in · athletics.\ Des~ite the fact that Phi· Beta Kap_!)as are more plentiful and . a thle~ic letters fewer in proportion ·at Princeton than they are at Un!on, it is • interesting to conjecture what the ,' sentiment here is with regard to the 1nat~er. The constant decline in the .· number of students p.ursuing the course of Bachelor of Arts would seem to in- dicate that keys are not sought for • with the dil:gence which was evid- • enced when the first call for baseb.aH candidates yven t out this S.Dring. . A recent edition of the \Alumni · Monthly'' contains some interesting statistics which offer a very striking rebuttal for those who maintain that \key men never get anywhere after they lea Ye colleg;e.\ It doubtless is true that the memory of a successful college career is sometimes a hard' thing to combat in business, just as it was- painful to step from the com- mencement platform in the home town high school and become a Freshman who had to wear a green cap and smoke a corncob. But a Phi Beta Kappa key is not the sure sign of failure in life that son1.e would like to make it. ltlninn Olnllrgr SCHENECTADY, N.Y. UNDERGRADUATE COURSES Leading to Degrees of A. B., Ph. B., B.
