Please do not take this as an attack on the Honor System. Good points in th(' Honor System. I have passed by for the reason that we are all familiar with· them. A11d in mentioning the two stock objections which I have mentioned, my purpose has been in part to provoke express:ons of under- graduate •opinion and so to learn whether. undergraduates think those objections serious. Just one l>Oint, in closing, about the proctor system. You say, \it is readily app.an~nt that the proctor sys- tem is another which courts disaster without getti11g at the real point, which is rather to insure fairness h1 examina- tions than to prevent a violation of ethics.\ For all I know, this may be true in the majority of institu:ions in which_ the proctor system obtains; but I have my doubts. From my own undergraduate days under the proctor system (though they were long ago, I. can remember something about them, for they lasted seven years!) and from my experience as a teach~r under the proctor system for five years, I can recall hearing of only three instances of d1ishonesty in connection with ex- aminations, None of those instances occurred in classes wl1ere I -was pres- ent either as teacher or as student (this I say to clear myself!); and in each instance the offender was immed-iately expelled froin college. During those twelve years I never saw anyone try, successfully or uttsuccessfully, \to give or to receive aid\ in an ex:am.ination. This of course doesn't prove that the proctor system is the system we ought to have; and I have fa.iled to mention tmfavorable criticisms of the proctor Brucker, 2b. _______ 5 1 2 1 1 1 Huested 15, by Kobak 9.

If 10n as to their significance-all this and mor·e, accordi11g to your perspec- tive-withal, ve.rse so fr.ee both in form a·nd thought, so original\ so piquant, so full of exquisite inspiration that we often wonder whether the majority of our songsters might not £allow the exampl'e of the illustrious composer .of the \Song Without Words\ with- out amy 1naterial detrhHent or loss to their productions ..

In view af the Peace Treaty, no-man's-land, over there, and over the top no longer arouse burning enthusiasm. Even the merits of our gallant Allies, Lafayette, the Maid of Orleans, and the lilies of France are becoming a hit passe.

STUDENT VOLUNTEERS To Observe Workings of Charity m New Y ork-Mr. Murphy Talks to Economists. Mr. John J. Murphy, secretary of the Tenement House Committee of the Charity Organization Committee of New York City, visited the College Thursday afternoon and gave a talk before the Senior conomics class o.n the history and work of his organiza- tion. Dr. Kellogg s.ome t>ime ago re- ceived a communication from this so- ciety asking if any of the students at Union would be interes~ecl enough in the work to go to New York and study it. As several announced their desire to go, Mr. Murphy was sent here to outline the course. The organization was founded about 50 years ago to carry on relief work in Manhattan and the Bronx Its ori- ginal purpose was to constitute a clear- ing house in which to study the merits, records, and )1istory of the cases presented to public charities for aid This led to a regulation of hous- ing laws, which at the time were not no-to-date, with respect to fire protec- ti-on, sanitation and lighting. Later a school of philanthropy to educate students of settlement work was founded. Its main purpose is to help families adjust themselves to new surroundings, and to see that children of exceptional ability are given a chance in the world by supplying the few dollars the child might be a1Jle to earn while it goes on with its school- ing. The nresident of the school a few years a~o developed a plan of giving Spring Haberdashery that's \ Different\ S PRING HABERDASHERY that's \different.\ Shirts, cravats, gloves, hose, hats and all the new little things in· keeping with the new season.

Only Those Who Have Com- pleted Original Theses Eligible to Full Membership. Acting tt!Jon the suggestion of the nat:onal society the Union Chapter of Sigma Xi has voted to take part in · the movement tww going on in the so- ciety at large to change the basis of election to full membershir> into the fraten~ity. Beginning with this year the chapte~ will elect to full mem- bership only those members of the Senior class who have completed a p:ece of original work, who have pre- pared a t.hesis on their work and who are otherwise eligible. The chapt~r will elect to associate membership those members of the Senior class who have marked ability in those pursui.ts which it is the object of the society io promo~e but who have not done a pie<:·e of original work. The associate'merJJ.- bers may be advanced to full member- shi!1 when they have met the require- lnents, which the national society is 1ow insisting upon, namely that th.ey rave carried out some research work. There is a slight difference in the in- signia granted to ihe active and ass.o- ciate members. The active members a.re rriven the right to wear the usnal Sigma Xi Key. The associate mem- bers are given the right to wear a k.ey somewhat different in design which bears U!JOll its face the Greek letters of the so.ciety and on its reverse side tbe I r:ame of the college and date of elec- tion. ence E.

Tbe tean1 has been rounding into for111 very rapidly. The weak points in tll.e distance runs and field events ha-ve been eliminated to a great degree. In the 100-yard dash Union has Pot- ter, Graubart and either Lyman or SteveHs. All four of these men are running better than ever. In the 220- yard event Graubart, Stevens and either Mosher or Zehfuss will wear the Garnet's colors. Stevens' defeat of Graubart in the inter-class meet last Saturday was particularly gratifying to all followers of the track team, as it assures two first-class men for all the sprints. Potter, Graubart a.nd Stevens ·in the 440-yard dash afford perhaps the best en try in the meet. In the 880-yard run Zehfuss, the b-,est half-miler on last year's team, has re- covered from his illness and will have a final chance to win a letter. Eddy of the Sophomore class has been run- ning well all year, while Houck show- ed that he has the necessary stuff by defeating Eddy in the inter-class meet.

Dawson Speer.) leave everything to the man's honor.\ Aye, there's the rub. It is the heart of the new sy·stem; it was not the heart of the old,. and hence the change. Mr. Speer has struck the keynote of the whole matter in the above article when he says that this spirit of honor must be so instilled in the students of the college that they will not toler- ate a man who falsifies. No tedious enumeration of penalties, no lengthy clauses will succeed if everything can- not be left to a man's honor. The suggestion of reading and passing up- on the constituion each year is a good one. Anything which will aid in driv- ing home the point that ·everything depends on the personnel of the stu- dent body should be resorted to. Spirit will be the determining factor, not words. It must be fully realized by each and every undergraduate of Union College that the honor system is his most price!.ess heritage and ·possession. \Honor is without price.\ We here at Union have the divine right of a sovereign people-that of self-govern- ment-and in order to preserve this right we must prove that we are com- COMMENCEMENT PROGRAM. petent to rule ourselves.

I~ must be clearly understood that this is not tale-bearing but that it must be done in order that the system shall live. A man who is a liar and a cheat is not wanted at Union College, and the sooner he finds out about it the better for all concerned. Often if a man is caught the first time and prop- erly punished it will make a man of him.

SATURDAY, MAY 31, 1919 The Garden. A short time ago an article appear- · ed in THE CoNCORDIENSIS, telling that Union was to come to her own next Fall and enter her Golden Age. The college does seem at the eve of an era of unprecedented progress. Students have returned, buildings have been built, the faculty enlarged, and the endowment .increased. It seems as if everybody ought to be satisfied. But it seems that one place has been neglected,-one place which cannot well be neglected,-the Garden. ·To be sure, some hasty efforts have been made in the last week to get it in shape for Commencement, but a few weks cannot rstore the neglect of a few years. The Garden has been declining for some time, partly as a re- sult of reckless invaders who have tramped down the flower beds, and partly for want of gardeners to keep it up. 1'he fact remains, the Garden is not what it used to be and not what it should be. · Perhaps peopel nowadays are not so sentimental as they formerly were, or perhaps they merely do not talk so much about it. It nevertheless re- main.s a fact that few if any persons have ever entered Jackson's Garclen without being impressed with its rus- ticity and beauty. The massive Nott Elm, which experts say has stood the storms of four hundred and seventy winters; the beds of Chinese peonies, brought here by Captain \Jack the historic spring, ,must arouse a feeling llot alien to the spil'it of tradition so strong in Union men. Speaking of that spring, the writer was informed the other day that in the construction of the memorial of the Class of 1906. the inlet was stopped up so that it now remains only a stag- nant well where refuse is thrown by disrespectful visitors. Many of the walks also need to be trimmed up and crushed stone put on them. . Of course, it is easy to find work for others to do and there may be good reasons, doubtless are good reasons for this work being left undone. Union has never been blessed with a surplus of endowment and this may explain a good many things.

Naturally such men are necessarily frugal as regards the use of bank- notes, but strange to s.ay, not so much so in the use of language.
