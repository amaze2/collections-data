Union's first baseball defeat on the new Alexander Field was registered Saturday afternoon, May 22, when Rutgers scored a 5 to 2 victory. It was a pitcher's battle in which Jenkins' pitching for Union, had a shade on Rutger's veteran moundsman, Jennings. Both men pitched remarkable ball, 1:;!1 t Rutgers' support was infinitely superior to Union's. Errors on the part of the Garnet were directly responsible for the loss of the game. Jenkins struck out thirteen men, and al- lowed only two bases on balls, while J en- nings fanned eleven men and allowed four passes. Both teams got four hits. For the first three innings J enkin.s was invincible. In the second three men were out in succession on strike-outs, and in the third, two more died the same way. But in the third, Gillam the first man up, laid down a bunt which Dave Beaver threw wild to :first, allowing Gillam to take second on the play. Browning, the next man up., hit safe, advancing Gillam to third. Hallett and T,ving were out on infield pops but Berg's single brought hon1e Gillam and Durand, who ran for Browning. In the sixth another run was scored on a base on balls, a sacrifice and a wild throw. In the eighth Rutgers scored two more runs on a base on balls, a fielder's choice, and an error. Union was unable to hit Jennings with any freedom and there was a great scar- city of hits when hits meant runs. Only two men reached first until the seventh in- ning. Zimmer got a clean single in the second, and Friday a base on halls in the sixth. But in the seventh Jake Beaver dis-- played a streak of inspired base-running, and scored Union's first run. With one down, Jake singled. A moment later he went down to second. He took a big lead off second and got third on a pretty delayed steal. Berg let one of Jennings' slants get by him a moment later, and Jake can1e hon1e. In the eighth Union was robbed of at least three runs by a circus catch by Browning, Rutgers' first baseman. That catch was easily the star event of the after- noon. Zimmer singled to start off, but was out stealing. Tubby Rosecrans drew a base on balls and went down to second when Bill Friday singled. Tubby stole third and Bill second. Jennings whiffed Jenkins, but the catcher muffed the ball and Jenkins was safe on first, Rosecrans going to third and · Friday to second on the misplay. The bases were full with one out when Dave Beaver catne to bat. Dave Beaver fanned. Then temporarily, Jennings lost control and walk-

The hall rose, floated up and over-a Texas Leaguer in short right field, and anybody's ball. Right, fielder, second baseman, and first baseman started for it. It looked like a sure hit. B'rowning, the first ?aseman, running at full speed out toward right field, twisted rtOund and saw the ball up over his should- er. With his mitted hand turned upward ,. behind his back he caught it. For a thrill- ing moment it juggled round in his glove, but stayed there finaUy-and the inning was over and with it Union's best chance to even up the score.

A Shut-Out for the Visiting Team. 1\!Iiddiebury went down to a defeat by the vvhitewash route Saturday, May 29th, here. The score was · Union 10, Middlebury 0. Hummer pitched a good steady game, allow- ing only six hits and the team fielded per- fectly behind hin1. From the results it looked as if errorless ball tneant victory, for Middlebury made nine errors. McLaughlin started in the box for Middlebury but only lasted two innings. In that period Union garnered six runs off his delivery. He was replaced by Crippen, '\vho was more successful in checking Union's hitting. But in the sixth and sev- el1th innings the Garnet scored four more runs. In the opening inning Dave Beaver was safe on first on an error by Dewhurst at third. He advanced to third on a wild throw, Moy- nihan being safe on first. Jake Beaver then lined out a double that scored both men. He came home on an error that put Woods on first. In the second Hummer walked. Dave Beaver singled. A double steal and an er- ror brought Hummer home and put Dave on second. Moynihan scratched a liner and was safe on a fielder's choice that failed to get Beaver. A muffed fly brought both men home. In the sixth three hits gave Union two more runs and in the seventh two hits, an error and a sacrifice were responsible for two more. to cb m tu te D M J. \:\ fi Zi R F: H B D L B E R ru J< L c u lV T J.

Not only did he pitch air-tight ball, but he clout- ed out a three-bagger that was as long a hit as has been seen on Alexander Field this season. Union's seven runs were the result of ten h1ts, a few errors, and fast base running. 'rhe Beavers and Galbraith, who went in at second for Tubby Rosecrans, who had a bad ankle, each stole a base, 'vhile Dave Beaver cut down all C. C. N. Y. men trying to purloin a bag. Four strike-outs in one inning was the rather unusual record Jenkins made in the fifth inning. This followed three strike-outs in the previous inning. In the fifth the first man up breezed, but Dave Beaver lost con- trol of Jenkins' final spitter, and the batter . was safe on first. The next three men all died on strike-outs. Until the sixth inning the two teams went along evenly. Union had been touching Rosenberg freely, but the hits all went straight to fielders. The team was not fol- lowing Willy Keeler's famous advice t<> \hit 'em where they ain't.\ In the sixth inning, however, Dave Beav- er singled. He went down to second when Moynihan was safe on an error. Jake Beaver lined out a two-cushion wallop to right on which Dave and 1\1oynihan scored. He scored a moment later on Toody's hit to

12 THlt CONCORDIENSIS left. Teedy went to second on the throw to catch Jake. Then Teedy scored on a wild p-itch~ In the seventh a solitary tally was rung up. This belonged almost altogether to Jenkins, who lined out a long triple to cen- ter. Tucker at third threw Dave Beaver''s grounder wild to catch him at first, and Jenks crossed the plate. Two runs bisected the pan in the eighth. Jake Beaver singled, advanced on Zimmer's hit and scored with Zimmer on Galbraith's single. Jake Beaver made three hits during the p~stime, and Zimmet maintained his average with two clouts. Farrell, C. C. N. Y. 's first baseman, did the best work for the New York team. He got the one and only hit against Jenkins, started off two double plays, and accepted all his chances without error. c. C. N. Y. A.B. R. H. P.O. A.

In Close Score Game.-Errors Greatly Re., sponsible for Defeat. Rensselaer vanquished Union in a close game here last Saturday by a score of 5 to 4. Each team garnered nine hits off the opops-- ing pitcher, but R. P'. I. bunched the bingles with better success than did Union. Errors played a large part in the run-getting. The game was not decided until the last inning when Union had a chance to tie up the score. With two down, Dave Beaver got his third hit and stole second while Fer- ris was fanning Moynihan. Jake Beaver, however, could only produce a fly to left and the game was over . Union started the scoring in the second inning. Woods was out on a foul fly to third, and Houghton died the same way& Zimmer pickled the ball for a single over second. Rosecrans slammed the bail down hard toward short but the fielder ma·de the play to second to ~atch Zimmer. Both men were safe. Friday hit down the first base line and was safe when Folan threw to third to catch Zimmer, who nevertheless was safe. 'fhe bases were full with two men down and Hummer at bat. Hum did not have to hit, for Ferris hit him, torcing in the first runa Dave Beaver, with the bases still loadedr obliged with a single which scored Rose·\ I,~ ) . ' .1 i . ,, ,''If I'' : /. cr.

L got two more runs and Union one. This put the Trojans ahead and was enough to win the gan1e. O'Connor started R. P. I.'s rally by singling. Johnson laid down a pretty sacrifice to pitcher. After Folan had flied out to left, :1\ticManus singled sharply. O',Connor took third on the play. Haher brought both n1en home with a double. Union's run in the seventh. was the result of a hit, a couple of stolen bases and an in- field out. D. Beaver, who scored two of Union's runs and fattened his batting aver- age with three clean hits, got his second hit. He promptly stole second and third, and same home when Johnson fielded Moyni- han's grounder to first. In the third inning Houghton laced out a triple to center after two were down, but died on third when the nex:t man was out. The score follows : RENSSELAER. A .. B. R. H. P.O. A.

Two errors by Dave Beaver, am error by Rosecrans and four free passes in orne inning. gave Stevens three runs and victory in Tuesday's return game with Union on the R. C. Alexander Field. The final score was 3 to 1. All the run n1aldng took place in the first two innings, Union tallying its lone point in the second when Moynihan reached first on a single to center, took second on a wild pitch, went to third oa a grounder to· first by Rosecrans and scored on Friday's· single to right. In the following seven in- nings the Garnet boys se~ured but one hit, this a 1\\exas leaguer by ''\Teedy\ Woods in the sixth.

When a college o£ nearly 500 sends but two dozen men to a neighboring town as a cheering section tor one ot the biggest games o£ the year, it is nearly time for that college to suffer a rough awakening. We have been proud of our clean athletics 'but have closed our eyes to many glaring shortcomings. Is this instance a sample o£ our famous tJ nion College spirit? H. L. WOODS. HUMMER ELECTED BASEBALL CAPTAIN. Eugene Hummer, '16, of Ravena, was elected captain o£ the Union College base ..... ball team for next year at a meeting of the \U'' and \A. U.

Colgate carried away the victory with 17 points more than Union. The track was heavy, but fairly good time wa:s made in the dashes. Mallen took three firsts by win- ning both hurdles and the broad jump. Morison took the 220 yard dash and Stoller won the hammer throw for Union.

HAMILTON TRACk MEET. Urtiort Line an Easy Victor ·Over Old ~ival With Seven Firsts. On May 29 the Garnet track team hum- bled Han1i1ton on her home field in one of the fastest meets ever held between the two institutions. Seven firsts, a tie for first in the high jump, and a goodly sprinkling of seconds and thirds made up our 66 points and gave the victory to the Union athletes with a margin ot 15 points. The sprints were very close and in then1 a record of eCt:ch college was equalled. Hamilton show- . ed up well in the longer runs, save the half mile, and made a clean sweep of the 440 as Union did in the shot put. Both the hurdles were Union victories in spite of Phil's mishap in the 220. The broad jump was easy for Mallen, whb was the greatest point-winner of the meet, closely seconded by Butler with 11 1-2 to Phil's 12.

The An1erican National Red Cross has granted Union's application for a charter and the (J nion College Life Saving Corps is now a permanent organization with au- thority to instruct and examine candidates for metnbership and to recom.mend those passing the tests for membership in the national organization. It is a real privilege for any person to be associated with an organization of such ex- tensive influence and such high ideals of ser- yice to hun1anity as the Red Cross, and such association carries with it a duty on the part of its members to do all in their power in the way of financial aid and personal ser- . vtce. In addition to lessening the appalling loss of Eves through drowning accidents the work of the life saving corps affords a splendid means for bodily development and for varying the pleasures of swi mtning. and allied recreations. The life saving work is to be a regular elective of the course in phy- sical training. Union College enjoys the unique distinc- tion of being the first college to acquire a charter for this work under the Red Cross and it is hoped that another year a large number of students will avail themselves of the opportunity of becoming members. The following list of officers of the corps have been appointed by the official organ- izer, Comn1odore W. E. LongfeUovv: Presi- dent, Dr. S. A. 1\ticComber; vice-president, A. D. Wilson, '17; secretary-treasurer, Mr. C. S. Parker; medical officer, Dr. S. A. Mc- Comber; captain, J. J. Beattie, '18; instruc- tor, E. C. Felthousen; mate, C. 0. Anderson, '18; board of examiners, C. 0. Anderson, E. C. Felthousen, C. S. Parker, S. A. M c- Comber. In addition to the officers the other charter members are: J. D. Brown '18, A. J. Golder '18, W. D. Karker '18, C. J. Mo- nette '18, F. K. Toth '18, E. H. Steele '18, K. W. Stillman '18, W. R. Cantrell '18, J. E. JYicintvre '18. j \' Nathan H;ale of the Schenectady High School and Harry Smith of Schenectady

18 THE CON·CORDIENSIS have also been admitted to active member- ship in the corps. In addition to the above the examination was successfully passed by the following, who are eligible to membership upon pay- ment of the initiation fee and dues: I. Al .. pert '18,. J. Epstein '18, L. E. Hinsie '18, T. L. Madden '18, W. H. Matern '18, G. M. McCarthy '18, E. R. Slade '18, A. K. Reed '18, M., E. Morris '18, P. A. Dussault '18, C. H. Underwood '17. TO ORGANIZE BASEBALL LEAGUE. A movemnt is on foot among several of the smaller colleges to form a baseball league next year. The proposition is being backed by Stevens, and if adopted the new organi- zation will include about eight institutions. The teams would in all probability be even- ly matched, and would consist of Hamilton, Stevens, Union, R. P. I., Worcester Tech., N. Y. U., Rutgers and C. C. N .Y. REVIEW OF UNION'S 1914-15 ATH- LETIC TRIUMPHS. Many Victories Won. The football season of nineteen fourteen has gone down in history as the most re- markable one through which a Union team has ever passed, and the members of the nineteen fourteen squad will ever be remem- bered as veterans of the clean slate band. The ordinary observer, in looking over this all powerful aggregation, would find no rea- son for judging them as anything more or less than just a good bunch of athletes and would wonder why their success was so phenomenal. ·The reason lies in the fact that good, earnest, industrious at1d con- scientious effort on the part of an efficient coach together with excellent co-operation on the part of every member of a football squad composed of good material will in- variably mould this material into the form of a steady and effective fighting machine, which cannot be defeated save by a foe highly superior in strength. The football team of the past season gives us a shining example of a clean and effective athletic machine and its methods of proceedure as well as its brilliant results are remembered with pride and will be so remembered throughout the years to come by every loyal son of Old Union. Captain Starbuck's motto was: \Ever f game a victory.\ and his team made this motto a reality. 'tfhe basketball season of nineteen-fifteen brought forth another grand triumph. Un- defeated except by Cornell, Captain Hough·' ton's bunch brought home victory after vic- tory throughout the season, winning the Northeastern League trophy, beating West Point and wresting a hotly contested game from Princeton's fast team. To the four seniors of the team, Houghton, Woods, D. Beaver and J. Beaver, great credit is due. Fred Dawson did wonderful work as coach, Mudge and Haubner rendered excellent ser- vice, and a fighting scrub helped out to a huge extent. It was indeed a grand season and from all points of view-a successful one. The track season just past brought forth very gratifying results. A great deal of ex- cellent material was found in the freshn1an class and this taken together with a good- ly supply of hardy warriors from the other three classes gave Union a well balanced team which succeeded in beating R. P. I. and Hamil ton and came out in second place en. the intercollegiate meet held at Utica. Cap- tain Dent, Doctor McComber and the squad deserve to be congratulated. 'l'he baseball team has just finished its career and the season has been one of grand success. Old Gene Hummer, good and steady as usual, has been the mainstay of the Garnet nine throughout, while Jenkins of the speedy spitball fame is a close second on the pitcher's mound. Captain Woods has a team to be proud of and a coach to ; \ I I ' .},/ ·,, H •'il :1 ' ~ ,. ; :~ :·.- ' ! \ l ~. . : .

CIVIL ENGINEERS TAKE INSPEC~ TION TRIP. Interesting Trip to Ashokan Dam ;E.njoyed By the .Seniors. On May 24 a very instructive inspection trip to the Ashokan reservoir o£ the City ot New York water supply vvas enjoyed by Prof. Lyon and eight of the senior civils. · The party vvas met at Kingston by Prof. Lyon's friend, Mr. Lewen F. Searle, the sec- tion engineer in charge of the project, and lvir. J. P. Clapp, assistant engineer. TJ nder the very able guidance of these gentlemen, the party proceeded by automo- biles up thru the heart of the beautiful Catskills to Ashokart; and thence over the forty 1niles of city highways surrounding the reservoir. After inspecting the several exceptionally flne concrete highwa.y bridges en route-one of extraordinary interest be- ing a three-hinged single span concrete arch 175 feet in height and with a span o£ over 200 feet-the party proceeded to the mess hall, where Contractor Winston had a de- licious dinner in readiness. After this sumptuous repast, the more interesting features of the work were visit- ed. Especial interest centered aroun<i Ashokan dan1, a concrete stn.tcture over 200 teet in height and 1,000 feet in length. The miles of enormous dikes, the spillway, the valve house, the gate house, the aereating tank, and the 15-span wire bridge exhibited unusual ingenuity of design and excellence of constructio.n. After dinner at the Stuyvesant, Kingston, and visiting such historic places as Wash- ington's headquarters, and the State House which was once the capitol of the state and in which the :first state constitution was adopted in 1777, the party took the 9 :00 P. M. train for home, very grateful to the en- gineers in charge for the kind atten6on they had shown. .IMPORTANT PUBLICATION BY :PROF. LYON. Professor George J. Lyon, M., Am. Sec, C. E., has just sent to the printer the conl- pleted tnanuscript of Water Supply Paper No~ 3 71, which is being published by the \;Vater Resources Branch of the United States· Geological Survey, with which Pro~· fe')sor Lyon has been associated several years. 'This publication contains the standard plans and specifications for the erection of structures used in the measurement of the flow of water in the United States and its insular possessions. These plans are also used to a large extent by the engineers of the Departmertt of the lhterior, o£ Canada, as well as by the Federal Bureaus of many of the South American Republics. About one hundred thousand dollars worth of con.., struction is based on these plans each year. The records obtained from such stream gauging work furnishes the basis for the construction and operation of all water power, domestic water supply, and canal work, in the United States. District Engineers of the United States Geological Survey who have assisted in the preparation of this publication are located in the following cities : Boston, Mass,; Albany, N. Y.; Atlanta, Ca.; San Francisco, Cal.; 1\tladison, Wis. ; Portland, Ore.; Denver, Colo.; Santa Fe, N. M.; Salt Lake City, Utah, and Honolulu, Hawaii. Professor Lyon has done a rna terial work in advancing the interests ot Union College through this publication by keeping before the engineers o£ the country the fact that the Engineering Department is constantly carrying on work of real value in connection with the State and Federal service.

20 THE C.ONCORDIENSIS PAN SOTER. Classical Club Plays to Full House. .The Latin play, \Pan Soter,\ given by the Classical Club at which the Aeneadae and Agora of the Schenectady High School v.rere guests of honor, was produced in the trophy roo1n of the gymnasium on Tues- day evening, May 25, before a large audi- ence. As the program informed the appre- ciative classicists who composed the audi- ence, the play was a comoedia Chiliologi. The action centered around a student of Universitas Concordia and a member of the l. 0. U. fraternity, Aristius Fuscus by name. This role was played by John Y ounie. Aris- tius on the night of the Junior Prom finds hin1self embarrassed, both pecuniarily and otherwise. He is on probation and the faculty have forbidden him to attend the dance. This is his dilen1ma. It is heighten- ed by the in1portunate demands of bill col- lectors, his tavern keeper, his tailor, his florist, and his washerwoman. His friends taunt him in his predicament. Enter, Au- gustinus, with pipe and bathrobe, a costume which mingled the student with the saint of yore. The wily Augustinus suggests the scheme 'vhich is to lead Aristius out of his complications. Augustinus is to supply the money and Pan Soter, the fer ox canis of the young Aristius, is to frighten the faculty into passivity. Enter, the faculty~ composed of Benedictus and Chiliologus. Pan Soter becomes fierce as Cerberus, the faculty flee. Augustinus produces the necessary 'denarii.' Ambrosius enters ac .. co~tered for the Prom. The curtain drops am1d great rejoicing. Aside from the clever construction of the play, and the pat application of Latin to n1od:rn affairs, the play was worthy of credtt for the ability of the actors. The leading role was played with great merit. Ignatz Stein, as Dama, the negro servant, acted with much ability, adapting his Latin to. the negro accent and to modern slang w1th marked effect; 4is rendering of \Way Down Upon the Swanee River\ in Latin brought down the house. The execution of a dance by Ambrose Clark to the latest Chiliologian air, \Euge! I'm a pa-pa!\ met with rounds of applause. Ketchum as inn ... keeper was also a leading star.

Faculty Tennis Court and Other Improve· ments. At last the chapel will have pews to re- place the present incongruous seats. The pews, which have been ordered, are of ·dark dull finished oak to match the interior ~n­ ish of the chapel. The new seats will be a vast in1provement over the carved and kick- scarred seats now in use and will give a more fitting appearance. Also, the floor is to be covered with \battleship\ linoleum. One can easily imagine the richness which these i1nprovements will give to the chapel and the greater attachment the students will have for the old building. During the last few weeks the colleg~ authorities have had many small trees an.dl shrubs p[lanted along the fences and in~ front of the gymnasium and other build.{ , ings. Evergreen trees have been set out inr f:ont of tihe new gym and the old gym, andf hlac bushes have been planted around th~f heating plant. The source of the new ver-r dure is the\ nursery near the athletic field~ which con. tains nearly two thousand small! trees and, hushes .. These are be~ng raised~ to transplrant about the ca-mpus 1n the fu-; tu~e. Realizing the great improvement ini the appearance of the campus during Dr) Richmond's presidency we can believe the: surprising fact that over three thousand: trees and shrubs have been planted during: the last two years. Along with the other improvements n1ade during the past term must be includ- ·ed the new faculty tennis court. The court is situated near the gymnasium and in front of the electrical laboratory. It is a cut stone court, the surface being of stone dust. It has been· well built and promises to be a very fast court. ENGLISH CLUB ELECTION. Wednesday evening, May twenty-sixth, the English Club met for the final time this year. At the business session many matters were taken up, among them the decision to study American poetry next year. Dr. Chase read a paper on \Nonsense Poetry,'' which included the study made by the club o.n mod ern poetry. Dr. E. E. Hale was elected president of tme club for the next year, Dr. Stanley P. Chase honorary scretary, and Paul Howen- stein acting secretary. SHOCKING. \I was terribly shocked last evening.\ '\How awful!

Parker Senate of Delta T·heta after having petitioned and received favorable consider- ation was installed on Saturday Evening, June 5th, as Rho Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha, a national fraternity of twenty-three chap.., ters. When the present organization be- came affiliated with Delta Theta Phi, the latter was in part a general fraternity, but since that time it has become entirely of le· gal character, and with the exception of the chapter at Union college, have no chapters outside the law schools. It was therefore best for all concerned that Parker Senate resign from Delta Theta Phi and become a chapter of a generai fraternity. Lambda Chi Alpha has chapters at the following colleges and universities: Maine, Dartmouth, Mass. Agricultural College, U. o£ Penna., Penn State, Brown, M. I. T., Michigan, Rutgers, Bucknell, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Cornell Californias w-ashington State, Rhode Island State, l.,.ouisiana State, TJePauw; Illinois, Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Boston University~ Knox, Georgia and Union.

Columbia abolished her cane rushes only after a young 1nan was killed in one of them. Shall Union wait until a similar case brings up the folly of her course? With the steady grovvth of our entering classes there goes an ever increasing danger of fatal results in these contests. A brdken neck is not more unlikely than a sprained ankle in the press and melee of a rusl~ and only sheer lttc:k has saved us thus far from a catastrophe. Last fall a man from the freshman class was sent home with hemorrhages of the stomach received in the fights of the opening days. The un- dergraduate recklessness which is responsible of his loss of a year would also have been equally responsible had he lost his life. The excuse that firn1 friendships are made in - these fights is sheer nonsense. Owing to the haste and excitement you are not likely to recognize your opponent if you meet him next day unless he is so disabled as to rend- er him conspicuous. The college spirit we really want 1s in no wise fostered or in- creased by class s€raps which are destructive rather than constructive. Neither do they serve to train the fre5hmen and teach them their plac-e because the entering class is as apt to· win as to lose.. 1£ a· man needs such a form of amusement to keep him from worse he would best join the football squad where he will have consistent training and his bruises will count toward a definite end. In short no valid argument save the ap- peal to precedent, which is no argument at all, can be advanced in favor o£ these fights .. \Ve unreservedly advocate the abolition of them in their present form. In their place we would suggest that, if some form of a fight is still wanted, each underclass select an equal number of men and match them against men of equal weight from the other class in boxing and wrestling contests, only after they have been thor- oughly trained. Hereby all those men who feel the keen joy of manly contest would have a chance to offer their services to their class and contest on equal grounds; the man who feared cowardice more than danger would no longer feel compelled to enter a fight which his intelligence revolted against and a far more accurate way of determining class superiority would be inaugurated. Here is a plan and a reform. Let those ·who hold. Union's welfare highest consid ... er. The strongest compulsion thus tar brought to bear upon us is our own sense of responsibility. Whatever our course, let us remember that we must always some time reap the rewards or-suffer the consequences. TH~ NEW UNION SONG 1'3001{. \Students alumni and friends ot the College are asked to send St1,ggestions for a proposed new edition of a book ot the songs of Union College to Lester T. Hubbard, 22 7 Arkay Building, State and Pearl ~treets, Albany, who has been appointed by the Graduate Council for such purpose. It is proposed to include songs old and new) with the cheers and other data, with brief tnention of the song \\tvriters and songs of the College\';

26 THE CONCORDI:ENSIS The above notice was sent to the editor by Mr. Hubbard, who is renderin:g inval- uable service to the college in compiling the new book of Union songs. Such a book as this will be when complete is one of the most effective means of fostering colleg-e spirit and should therefore appeal especially to us Union students, as well as to the alumni and friends of the college. It serves to unite the past with the presnt and to preserve in song and ballad the tales and traditions of Old Uni.on. We earnestly urge all those who have any ideas on the subj:ect to communicate them to Mr. Hubbard. \HARMLESS HAZING. The First Incident in Two Pilgrims' Prog- ress. Once upon a time there lived two boys. They dwelt in the Backwoods. The soli- tude of those Backwoods would make the Sahara desert resemble a crowded mart of civilization, and the verdure of those boys would make the color of the unripe apple resemble a deep and ruddy crimson. Their father, being endowed with a recent desire to see his young hopefuls receive a better education than he had had, betook himself to his library, consisting of an illuminated family Bible, Locke's \Essay on Human Understanding,.\ an annotated edition of the exploits of Nick Carter, and a World Al- n1anac, and consulted the last of these. The magical words \Union College\ having a particularly euphonious sound, like unto the Music of the Spheres, he forthwith sent for literature concerning that institution of learning. In due course of time there came into his hands a Union College Handbook, known as the common or garden variety of Freshman Bible. Perusing this work, he at length came to page 11 and read: \Only hazing of a harmless and unobjectionable nature exists at Union.\ \Ah !\ quoth he, \the very place for my boys!\ Accordingly, on the n1orn of September 14th we find two more freshmen in our midst. As the two innocents emanate from the treasurer's office a delegation of sopho- mores meet them, who pounce upon them and extract from their jeans whatever change Mr. Dewey has been. careless enough to leave them. \Harmless Hazing'' is the answer to their protestations. Then they are divested oi shoes and stockings and de\' livered to another hungry mob who balance them on a barrel, make them walk a tight rope and pick up red hot coals with their teeth, all the time affectionately walloping them over the domes with baseball bats and engaging in other such childish pastimes. Then issues forth from the mob a burly sophomore who bids one of the innocents wrestle with him. \Why wrestle?\ he makes bold to inquire. \You never did any- thing to n1e.\ HHow careless on my part,\ answers the sophomore. Whereupon he bi.ffs the freshman in the jaw, furnishing the desired provocation. An instant later they are groveling in the dust, and as an upper-classn1an slaps the sophomore on the back, the freshman hears wafted to him sweet and low on the wings of the breeze tl1at. n1elodious refrain \Harmless Hazing.\ Now pandemonium breaks loose: \He must paint! You put hirn down! He must p(Jint !'; Whereupon an infor1nal reception to the freshman takes place. \'Go ahead, paint the idol!\ he is ordere·d. '\But it is painted already,\ he replies. (Nine sopho ... mores pounce upon him and spoil his face.) \Paint it anyway,\ they say. \Anything to be agreeable,\ he replies, \where is the brush ?\ (the sophs break one ar1n and a couple of his legs.) \Use your hands for a brush,\ they order. \How absurd,\ says he. (More anatomy rendered useless.) But ....

.... THE CONCORDIENSIS 27 he paints! And how he does paint! And ever and anon there rings in his ears the same refrain \Harmless Hazing.\ But what has become of Brother aU this time? Having managed to escape the man- eating sophs, he wanders to his boarding house. As he is about to enter it he meets a moving van. Immediately he is sur- sounded, bound; gagged, handcuffed,. shack- led, etc., etc. They hang him to a tree. '\this suspense is awful,\ he remarks. Hliarmless Hazing,\ they reply. Then he is taken far out into the country. A barn is reached. \To-day is Monday,\ he is told. \On Friday the cane-rush occurs. Until then, you stay here.\ He stays .. Let us skip the interval of the next few days. Brother Number One may be ob- served continually wandering about the campus in search of a stray ear which a sophomore has carelessly removed. Broth- er Number two is languishing in the barn, sans eats, sans drinks, sans pants, sans dignity, sans anything. Friday dawns. A group of freshmen re- turn the lost ear to its owner and rescue their classmate from the barn. \How lucky we found you,\ they say. \Now you can enter the cane rush !\ Now., gentle reader, you would not ex- pect an untutored savage to give a scholar- ly dissertation on the fourth dimension. Neither would you expect our two young heros to be familiar with the intricacies of a rcane rush a la mode. They enter the pas- ture, line up, and charge. They walk first into one bag of salt, then into another, then another. A tomato assails them in the rear. trhen more salt. Then more tomatoes. A whist[e blows. The cane rush begins. They are plunged headlong into that whirling vortex of under classmen. The whistle blows again. They are dragged to the idol. They paint some more. \The frosh have won the rush, is announced. \Hurrah shouts a freshman, \Now we can carry official canes a year from next June. \Will they let us live so long?\ asks Brother Number One. A soph chokes him. He feels himself be- coming weaker and weaker. His breath comes in short gasps. He whispers a few words, and a close listener might make them out as \Harmless Hazing.\ He gasps again, quivers and all is still. No, gentle reader, he does not die. On the contrary he is around bright and early the following year. Already he has earn- ed distinction among the class-mates by drawing and quartering four members of the entering class, to say nothing of having murdered several more in cold blood. And for this we send our sons to college! A. M. J., '16. ENGLISH AS IT IS SPELLED.

• i . I 30 THt CONCORbt:€NSlS THE PHILIP SPENCER CASE. John Clark Spencer, class of 1806, Union College, was secretary to Governor Tomp- k1ns of New York; was elected to Congress in 1817 and was Secretary of War in Presi- dent Tyler's cabinet. He was Secretary of the Treasury in 1843-4. His son, Philip Spencer, entered Union College in 1839 as a sophomore, and left college in 1840 to enetr the U. S. Navy as a petty officer, a post to which his father, the \V ar Secretary, had appointed him. Philip Spencer was assigned to the brig ot \Yar \Somers comn1anded by Alexander Slidell 1\iackensie. Mackensie openly op- .. posed the placing of young Spencer on his ship, and for reasons never understood, seemed to dislike the young man. Im1nediately after Spencer's assignment to the \Somers Mackensie applied for his transfer to so1ne other vessel. This request vvas refused as no valid reason was alleged for the change. Whatever the cause, Mac- kensie manifested his dislike for Spencer on al1 occasions. The \Somers\ left New York September 12, 1842. Soon after that date while on -· shore leave, Spencer became involved in a quarrel with an English sail()r and \beat him up.\ For this Mackensie was about to courtmartial him but was prevented do- ing so by orders from Washington. Again Mackensie requested the transfer of Spen- cer and was again refused. Matters between the n1idshipman and his commander did not improve. On Novetn- ber 11th, 1842, the ship had left Palermo in- tending to stop at St. Thomas for provi- sions and stores when a sailor named Wales told Comamnder Mackensie there was a plot to mutiny, kill all the officers and throw such sailors as would not acknowledge Spencer as chief, into the sea. Wales' story-never confirmed-was that on a night when he, Wales, was on duty Spencer approached and leading him aside told the details of the proposed m ut1ny ~nd murders, supplementing the sta1iement with pictures of piracy, booty and '''good eatin's\ that Penrod might have told to boy friends. in the barn. Wales was then sworn to secrecy-the way pirates always are-· and a.clmonished that a betrayal would result in death. Wales story was tinged with ap_. parent in1probabilities and lacked convinc-- ing details. Mackensie listened and seeming to believe the existence of a plot as described by W ales 1 he recalled that Spencer \was ·very friendly with •·the crew; that Spencer drew more to ... bacco and spirits than any other officer and that Spencer had been overheard. to say that he wished he had such a ship as the 'Somers' under his command.'' He also had noted that the members of the crew showed a strong liking for Spencer and see1ned to be \under his influence.\ Such suspicious acts and conditions were established in Mac- kensie's mind; none more criminal were al ... leged at the time. Mackensie at once assembled his officers, told then1 the tale Wales had related and stated his own suspicions. Mackensie stated, later, that his officer$ counselled \immediate action.:, He took their advice and went beyon<l it, as was shown. That day, at drum-beat to quarters, Spencer was arrested, placed in irons and orders issued that he was not to be allowed to speak to any person. Spencer was searched but n()thing relat .. ing to a plot was found on him. His room was then searched and there was found what Comtnander Mackensie characterized as \A cipher record in strange characters,\ con- firming his suspicions. The i'cipher\ was proved, at Mackensie's trial to be a daily record of events, in Greek. Spencer had told Mackensie that it was Greek and of no importance, and the commander said \why did you write in Greek if you were not afraid I would see this bool< ?\ On this (. 1

(. 1 THE CONCORDIENSIS 31 flimsy evidence a court-martial was ordered. Sn1all and Cromwell, two seamen, had been seen with Spencer frequently and both vvere ordered under arrest and placed in irons. Later, four other seamen were ar- rested but only one of them was held. During the trial of Spencer, Mackensie Sf.11d that the crew were sullen, discontented and almost insubordinate, all, he alleged, ovvTing to the plot. It is probable that con- ditions were due to the injustice of the com· mander. Spencer was found guilty and Mackensie says his officers advised: \That the best course to pursue was to give the prisoners tin1e to prepare for death and then execute them in a manner best calculated to have a beneficial effect on the disaffected.\ 1\he n1en-Spencer and three seamen- vvere hanged at the yard-arm. Spencer ask- ed that he be shot but the sentence was hnnging. The brig was witnin t\vo days of New York and delay might have saved Spencer, but no delay was allowed, though pleaded for. On the arrival in New York Mackensie was ordered under arrest on the charge of murder. rrhe order was issued by tlie fath- er of Spencer, then Secretary of War, and after a trial lasting forty-four days, Mac- kensie was acquitted. The witnesses who would have testified in Spencer's favor had been hanged with hin1. President 1\\yler confirmed the finding of the court, but made some comments on the finding which created anger among the friends of Mackensie. * * * The Concordiensis wishes to express its indebtedness to Mr. Clinton for the interest- ing article given above. $35,000. 1'he student meeting of Monday, lv'Iay 24, was an enthusiastic one in the making of pledges toward the General Education Board fund. We simply regret that there was not more enthusiasm, materially shown. As it was the speeches of Prof. Opdyke, Charlie Waldron, and Foster Brown called fo1·th pledges totalling $1,300. It seems that the students must have been taken too much to heart the speakers' sound advice not to pledge more than they could pay for, the average amount pledged was the extremely small sum of about $4.00 per man. In as much as the final payment need not be made until 1917, it seems that we should be able to reach an average which would see us much farther on the way toward the re- quired $35,000. Let's all do our part and see what inspiration we can give the alumni at commencement to finish the job. We want that $75,000 from the G. E. B. Everybody in it ! A deep \dig\ for 0 ld Union !

Landreth; (for the sopho- mores) R. L. MorisGn and J. H. Tregurtha. COMMENCEMENT VESPERS. Five o'clock Sunday afternoon saw a crowd of about three hundred assen1bled in Jackson's Garden to attend the commence- ment vesper services. 'rhe day was ideal a11d many outsiders were present in addi- tion to a large contingent from the student body. The sertnon was preached by Rev. \\'\illard D. Brown '00, on the text, \The Carpenter of Galilee,\ depicting Christ, the man. Rev. Brown is pastor of the North Reformed Church of Passaic, N. J., and has been a delegate to the I-Iague Peace Con- ference. Rev. Brown was assisted in the ser- vice by D. Putnam Cady '85, of Montclair, N. J., who led in prayer. Blodgett '15 read the scripture lesson and Carroll Gunning '16 furnished excellent music on his cornet. The services were in every respect success- fuL BACCALAUREATE SERMON. Sunday evening, June 6, the Baccalaureate services were held in the First Presbyterian Church. Dr. Richmond preached the ser- mon. At seven thirty the seniors in caps and gowns n1arched into the ·church and took the places reserved for them in the. front of the building. The faculty, also in gowns, occupied the seats behind them. Rev. Dr. A. Russell Stevenson, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, pronounced the invocation, and the Rev. Dr. B. W. R . Tayler, rector of :St. George's Episcopal Church, conducted the responsive reading. After the singing of a hymn, Dr. Tayler read the scripture, Rev. Dr. Eugene A. N able, pastor of the First Methodist Church, of- fered prayer, after which the collection for the sending of Union students to the an- nual Northfield College Y. M. C. A. con- ference was taken. The singing of a hymn followed, and then President Richn~ond de- livered the baccalaureate sennon. His text was Acts XVII-26, \And hath made of one blood all the nations.\ Broth- erhood was the theme of his address. \Down under the deep antipathies, under the national jealousies and misunderstand ..... ings and rooted prejudices that divide na- tion from nation, there rernains always that human consciousness of kinship, 1nan reach- ing out for the hand of his brother man.\ Dr. Richmond's final charge to the grad- uates of the class of 1915 was as follows: \Gentle1nen of the graduating class:- The time has come for the last word. To me it is no mere formula, custo1nary and there- fore sui ted to the time. I want it to be something that will express the deep and af- fectionate solicitude we feel for you-the parting counsel of an elder to a younger brother. The four years we have spent here together have developed in us son1ething stronger than a casual friendship. \IV e have learned to trust one another and admiration has deepened and beautied our trust.

But we shaH have failed in the main point if the years you have spent with us have not broadened your sympathies and deepened your understand- ing of life. If we have not quickened your sense of duty and bted in you the habit of obligation, we are sending you out in to a world distracted, the very foundations of civilization have been rocked by the violence of the storm, and the end is not yet. \This year-· which you will call your year -· will be known as the memorable year, another annus mirabilis. It will be r·emem- bered in history as a year of convulsion and horror. But I believe it will be r.emen1- bered also as a year when the souls of men were rnoved as they have rtever been moved before by the spitit of pity and brotherly kindness. \After the storm and the earthquake will come the still small voice the voice of God calling to duty, ealling to love mal-sing a way for a measureless peace. And the heart of the world will respond. And in this re- construction you young men will have a part. Let it be a part worthy of yourselves and ot this college. As you go out to take your share in the work of the wotld, you will be called to bear your share of the bur- dens of the world and of its inexorable suf- ferings. Let your minds be kindled by the thought of the men who have gone out be- fore you and who have laid. their gift upon the altar. May your gift be even greater than theirs. You will remember this place. Your thoughts will often flow back to it with a kind o£ yearning~ May the men1- ory of it bring you strength and 1nay the God of Peace attend you.~' Now is the time to buy thermometers ; they'll soon be going up.-Ex. CLASS DAY EXERCISES UNDER. NOTT ELM. On Jvionday afternoon, the Senior :c[ass Day exercises were held beneath the Nott elm in the garden. The seniors first song the class 'Song. 1~he first speaker in.-.. traduced hy Garry Wood, the class mar- shal, was Lyhde Hoke:tk, the class 1u:esi= dent, who welcomed the ciass guests. T\he class history \of things worthy and thihgs erratic'' was recounted by Harold J. Delchatnps. Then followed the pipe ()ra~ tion by Edward P. Culver. Chuck praised the ptpe as an ancient symbol of friend'Ship and spoke of how friendship had grown up among the class of 191'5. The speaker spoke briefly of the service of pipes in the class career-. \1~iUy\ Elughes read the class prophecy containing several very clever hits on. the graduating class. He was followed by the ivy orator, \Dome\ Agart. The oration_, on comradeship, began with a discussion of n1odern tendencies and led to a summary of Union's services, Mr. Agan said in clos- ing! J \Let us then as we plant the ivy, pl~edge fahew our love and support to 'Old Union., Let us be ever true to her traditions and her customs. Let us represent in our :fives the vigor and strength ot her high tn(}ral- ity. Let us give to every Union man the friendship o£ a Union man that the ties o( brotherhood may widen and the depth of brntherhood may deepen. Classmates nev- er lose the Union spirit. Never cease to sing her songs and love het nan1e, and re- member always the words of your dear old mother, \First bf all, be men.' ;, · Raymond S.

34 TilE c·oNCORD.JENSlS The concluding speaker of the occasion was \Ernie'' Houghton, the class orator. The oration dealt with the preculiarly hard situation which faced the college graduate of to-day and paid a tribute to the college .tnan. •'There are other reasons why we are sure of success. We are prepared to £ace the world. In the first place the morals of a col- lege man are of the best, his contact with professors, alumni and fellow students helps him realize that the true mission of a col- lege is to turn out men. College men are the cleanest set of men morally bn the face of the earth, and as boys come to college and spend their critical four years in contact with college men, they cannot but absorb the true idea of the mission of man, and , cannot_ help but get a solid foundation in true ethics. This is what makes us distinc- tive as college men, we know the right and choose it, we cannot present ignorance as an excuse and thus must follow the right or receive the condemnation we would de- serve.\ The oration was concluded by a tribute ,to Donald Coulter. During the exercises the class jug, pre- . pared by Bens Page and the class pipe, a replica of the library were circulated. With the class sat Master Faust, the class baby. 1915 CLASS DAY POEM. By M.

TI-lE 'CON·CORDIENSIS 31 ALUMNI PARADE. At 10 :30 the costume parade started from 1\J orth Ferry Street, came up Union, and formed a block U on the central campus. Here they were reviewed by the judges tor the \\Taldron ctlp. Practically 250 alumni were in the line-a record number. Cos- tun1es included French Zouaves, Indians, /;'Made..:in-Amer1ca'' Uncle Sams and Charlie ~haplins. The alumni ranged all the way from the 1912 class back to ;54. The \plug hat'' brigade of '95 took the Waldron ·cup, awarded for class attendance_, by strength of numbers. One section ot the parade which was especially interesting was the one made up ot 14 Civil War veterans. Edward H. Ripley '62 acted as grand marshal -vvhile Samuel P. McClellan '81 headed the parade as adjutant. Next came the band, behind which Thomas H. Feary '63 led his 14 vet- ~rans. After this, followed the \Old Guard\ of about 50 non-reunion alumni and then the other alumni and reunion classes. TltE Al.,UMNl DINNER. At no.on Tuesday, the alumni_, faculty and guests assembled at the new gym for the alumni luncheon. The enthusiasm was so great that Edmund T. Perkins '65 who pre- sided barely kept order, through the vig- orous use of his silverware, a hammer and a basketball whistle. A number o£ interest- ing and witty speeches, in which Prexy par- ticipated, followed the ·dinner. Among the most interesting to the practical Union man was the announcement of gifts by the treas- urer. They are as follows : $1;000-To provide a prize for work in chemistry, by Robert M. Fuller, '63, of Sche- hectady. A sum sufficient to perpetuate the Good- rich-Duane prize. A sum to provide £or a prize in history, by Freling H. Smith, '65, of New York. The income from $10,000, given by Wil- liam C. Saxton, of Albany, to provide scho,larships at the Albany Law School. An additional ,$5,000 from H. Melville! I-I anna, '59, of Cleveland, to apply on the general fund. 1'he confirmation by the courts of the legacy of $100,000 given the college by the late Gen. Daniel Butterfield, to provide a rnemorial building, to be erected in the course of the year a.11d to be devoted to the . sc1ences. The income from between $40,000 and $50,000, left the college by Mrs. Katherine Spencer Leavitt of Washington; to be ex- pended by Dr. Richmond to help worthy students. An additional sum, given by Robert M. Fuller, o£ Schenctady, for use in chemistry. $15,000-The income of which to provide for three scholarships in electrical sciences given by the General Electric Company. $800-Given by the class of 1905 to apply on the general fund. A memorial gift of $150 from the class of 1915, to apply on the general fund. $500-Given by the class o£ 187 5, to ap-- ply on the general fund. $500-Given by the Chicago alumni to apply on the general fund. ALUMNI NIGHT. The festivities of Alumni Night (Tues- day) were in more than one sense a howling success. Beginning with the Ludlow song contest and endirtg with the singing of Alma Mater at 10 o'clock, the program was an en- tertaining one made up of many clever \stunts\ by alumni and undergraduates alike. The song contest for the Fitz-Hugh Ludlow song trophy was again won by the class of 1917, which sang an original song, the words and music of which were written by H. Ralph Knight of Glens Falls. Last year Miss Helen Ludlow, sistel'\ of the au-

' i I . l ·. ! ' \ I I I : I ' 38 THE ·CO.NCORDtENSlS thor of Union's Alma Mater, Fitz-Hugh Ludlow, offered the trophy for the first time. The class of 1917 was the winner in that contest with an original song by Mr. Knight. The prize banners for the cleverest class stunts were awarded to 1912 for its Charlie Chaplin antics, and to the class of 1916 for the pantomime baseball game which it staged. MRS. RIPTON'S DEATH. The sad news of the death of Mrs. Ripton, of typhoid fever, at the Ripton home, 38 Union Avenue, on Tuesday, cast a gloom over the commencement celebrations. The death of Mrs. Ripton at this time has re- called to many a similar sad bereavement to the family of a high official of the college, the death the day before commencement in· 1907 of Mrs. Raymond, wife of Dr. A. V. V. Raymond, who was then president of the college. The students of Union College extend to their friend and Dean the deepest sym- pathy over his bereavement. COMMENCEMENT. .Union's one hundred and nineteenth commencement was held in the First Pres- byterian Church Wednesday morning. After the preliminary religious exercises can1e the following orations: \The Evolution of Religion,'; by D. Beav- er. \'rrue Athletics,\ by J. Beaver. \Religion and Ethics,\ by H.

Then came the Chancellor's address, by the Honorable Henry Cabot Lodge, United States Senator from Massachusetts. The general subject of his address was the realization of world peace by centering power in the hands of the non-warlilte na ... tions. After the Chancellor's address degrees were awarded to the graduating class of 1915, which was followed by the presenta- tion of Master of Science degrees to fifteen n1en taking the post graduate cottrse in electrical engineering. The following honorary degrees were awarded: A. B., to James M. Andrews and James A. Ellis; A. M., to Thomas H. Feary, Francis T. Vaughn, Edmond H. Ripley; L. H. D., to Charles C. Lester; Sc.

THE CONCORDIENSIS A REVIEW OF TH.E TRACK SEAS.ON. By Captain Dent. To sum up the past season in track would be to give the scores of the meets in which .Union participated and then to say \nuf:f said.\ But to start at the beginning and give everyone a full and comprehensive view of the work of the team it is necessary that we review the work of the team d ur- ing the winter. It was proposed at the be- g-itJ.ning of the winter to have a meet with R. P. I. Candidates were called for and a large squad appeared. It was at this time that the various men were trained and hard- ened for track work. In my 1nind the whole success of the season lies in the fact that all the n1en trained sincerely throughout the winter, and although not meeting R. P. I. at that time we accomplished the desired re- sults and laid a firm basis upon which to work in the spring. Early in March spring practice began, so that by May the team was in excellent con- dition and overwhelmed R. P. I. to the tune of 87 to 36. Our next event was the Inter- class meet. Great spirit was shown in this meet, partly inspired by the awards of silver and bronze medals. It was due to the Ath- letic Board, who made the medals possible, that the first REAL Interclass rneet was held at Union College. At the Intercollegiates we made a very creditable showing, Colgate beating us out for first place by but twenty points. This was the best record Union has made in the Intercollegiates in many years. Our next meet was with Hamilton and although not in the best of form we won by a goodly number of points. Thus we closed a victor- . 1ous season. In ciosing, too much credit cannot be given to our coach, Dr. McComber, and we extend our heartiest appreciation for his ef- forts in our behalf. This article would not be complete with- out mentioning the name of Phil Mallen. Our sterling swimmer proved an excellent track 1nan and it was due to his efforts that many of our meets were successful. He closed the season with two new records to Iiis credit. In closing we give our heartiest congrat- ulations to Captain-elect Jimmy Butler, a good leader and a conscientious worker. We all feel assured that next year's team will bring further victories to our Alma Mater and assure Jimmy the sincere co- operation of all the members of the team and the support of the student body.
