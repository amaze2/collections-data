T The Conc~ordiensis VOL. 36 .. JANUARY :22, 1913 No. ll UNIO~ 28, COLGATE :22 By w-hirlwind p'laying Garnet Fiv-e steals victory from heay;ier team. After a hard week of practice a11Cl with the memories of defeat still fresh in thei.r minds, the Garnet basketball team, took a little west- ern trip, to try conclusions with the Colgate five at Hamilton and Roc nester at Rochester. Reports came in from Hamilton that Col- gate was represented by one . of the fastest teams in the history of the college and this fact coupled with the tradition that Colgate had gone do\vn to defeat b-ut twice on its own court in four years might well ha-v~ shaken the confide11ce of the 1nany supporters of the speedy Garnet quintet. However, the fact is now properly recorded tbat the la:St aggres- sive Union team met and admi.n..istered a stinging- defeat to the mucb hearldecl Colgate squad and on their ow11 pecu1iar 2::x 4 court. The game was not \NOD so easi1F as that however. Outweighed man for 1nan and ·with odds against them, the U ni()tl players jumped into the ga1ne with a rush a.ttd played such whirlwind basketba11 that they held the lead at the end of the first half 20 to 7. This \vas due to excel]ent passing and shooting. In the second half~ Colgate sent a 11e\v team on the floor \\rith the exception oi Captain I-fatnn1ond, and this combinat1()11 \vorked better tl1an the first squad, se o1·ing fif- teen points to Union's eight. The superior team work of the Union five had given them smch a lead, however, that even a sensational SJ!Urt in the closing minutes could not stave 0 if the effect, though Union was taking things €.asy and saving her strength for the game on ~tile next night with the old rival Rochester_ 'The team worked wen together and all de- 'S~rve great credit.

8 THE CONCORD[ENSIS UNION 23 ROCHESTER 21 Ga.rnet gets back at Yellow and Black in exciting contest. The ·o]d saying, ''He who laughs last, laughs best '' seemed to vindicate itself Sat- urday, for though fate was against us last week, yet Union n1et and defeated Rochester Saturday, in one of the closest games eve:r played -in the city of Rochester. After the hard game of the night before and a long tedious journey out of Hamilton . ' it was a tired looking lot of boys that lined up against the fresh Rochestet five. From the toss of the ball both teams fought for aU that was in then1. By a series of quick passes and fake formations, Union worked the pall into her territory and then· Captain Beaver came across \¥ith a pretty field ba.sket from mid-court. This was fol- . lowed by a foul on Rochester which Hough- ton cleverly turned into another point. Then ensued one of the fastest games of the season. The Rochester team was heavy. Beside them, the Union players seemed like young- sters. The one tean1 had the weight, the other steam. And Union never once less- ened that speed from the opening to the clos- ing w h1s.tle. Rochester took the lead early in the game and the first half ended with the score standing 15 to 10 in her favor. But t11e whirlwind pace of the Garnet players was too much and Rochester was completely mystified throughout the last half. The Union players were here, there and everywbere, evading their guards and bring- ing forth groans from the Rochester audience as they tied and then passed their opponents' score. It was a losing game for Rochester from the first. The early lead gained by the Yellow and Black was only temporary. It was only a matter of methods and time. The local boys had set their hearts on turn- ing the trick and there was no gainsaying them. The more the Rochester team block- ed, held and rode their opponents, the more the same opponents pounded a\vay, crashed smashed and broke down the other's de- fense. It was a game of gam·eness, Ro- chester big physically, the superiors it would seem, always responded,. but with the same tactics Union never let up her speed, wearing down her opponents in time and then play- ing rings around the1n and finishing on the offensive. FAST FINISH So evenly matched were the rival fives that it was impossible for one team to holct a lead of two points, but afte~ a toss np, a scattering of players, a mix-·up and then a rush at the threshold of the Union basket ' the Garnet managed to cage the ball tieing- the score. It was the work of but a fe\v seconds, however, for· the big end of the score to shift under the Union ·column, and then Rochester again started on its way to obtain the lead. Both teams see-sawed back and forth like this as the timer's watch tick- ed off the minutes and finally with the score a tie, 21-21, with only a minute to play, the yellow jackets' supporters began to urge on their team and then as a last resort at- tempted to sing their Alma Mater, but the excitenlent was too great. The seconds ticked of£ 20, 30, 40, 50 and then by one of the prettiest shots of game \Jake\ Beaver caged the ball and won the game for ''Old Union, '' amid the g-roans of the Rochester supporters. It was all over, for the three seconds that remained were \V\ell taken care · of. It \vas Union's game. INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS ' Every man on the Union team showed 11p in excellent fashion. The Beavers, Captain ''D '' d''Jk '' . ave an a e, were 1n their usual good forn1. Houghton completely outplayed his opponent and De-vvey was able to keep his opponent on the defensive during the entire last half. \Voods played at center and shoV\red hinlse1f to be just the man for that position. n J j 1 l ( ]

As coacli Koult said to \\\Voods last year, stick to it and always be in condition, for when your chance does come, it \vill be un- expected. The Garnet team has a hard schedule this week. ~ast night they played Williams, at Williamstown, Friday, Swarthmore are our opponents.

UNI,ON WINS AGAIN Garnet Team Defeats Williams Five by 15-11 :Score Union made it three straight when she de- feated the Williams basketball team on its own court. The fina1 score was 15-1]. ''l',vo field baskets by Dewey in the last two minutes of play changed the game from a tie to a victory for Union. The game was rough and poorly refereed, for the New Eng- land players were out to '' get '' the Beavers and fouled them repeatedly ~rithout being censured by the refe-ree. But the G-arnet men succeeded in repeating the performance of last year in defeating Williams and so feel quite satisfied. The game opened with both teams playing a careful, guarding game. indeed, so closely did they guard that five n1inutes had elapsed before a foul called on. Hay was scored by Houghton, making first point in the game. Ho-vvever, play went on as closely as ever, but two minutes later, Victor made a basket on a long shot, over 1ta1f the length of the court. Union scored a field basket and another foul while Williams did the same and the half ended with the score, Wi1lian1.s 5, Union 4. SECOND HALF Between the halves, the Garnet me11 de- cided that they really wanted this game and that they would have to play fast and hard to get it. So the second half started with a rush. Union played fast trying to get her opponents bewildered and rush them off their feet. But Williams team could also play a fast, hard game and Union would lead by a point or two only to have the score immedi- ately tied by some fast -vvork of the Purple players. The score 1vas tied three tit\lles and when the last half 'vas near1y ended it looked like a tie game, the score then standing 11- 11. But Dewey \vanted 1he game recorded as a victory and not a mere tie, so, \vith but (Continued on page 11)

COLLEGE RIFLE CLUBS The Concordiensis llas recently received considerable information from the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice re- garding the formation of ri:fle clubs at the vario11s colleges and universities of our conn- try. This National ]3{)ard of Rifle Practice is a part of the War D€partment at Washing-- ton and so we feel it ()l..lr duty to bring this subje·ct to the attention of the students as re- quested. The TN ar De1)artmen t has deen1ed it a prudent plan to foster shooting 111atches among college students , and this for nun1erous reasons but especially\becat.tse it considers the ability to handle a gun an advantage to every war must rely in no small measure upon vol- unteers. 'Twenty-eight institutions of learning in the United States, including the large and more prominent ones, such as Harvard, Princeton, 'Columbia, Cornell and Wisconsin have or- ganized teams and these teams, each consist- ing of ten men or less are now organized into two large leag11es known as the Eastern and the Western Leagues. A schedule has been arran~ed for each league V\rhereby a match is held every V\reek for each team. The en- trance requirements are in general a fee of five dollars per tea1t1 and that the members of the team be undergraduates who are maintaining the necessary hours of \Vork and standard of scholarship required by their institution. As a prize, there is presented to the w1n- njng tea1n the championship trophy and ten spver n1etals, to the tea1n finishing second, a trophy and ten bronze medals. There are minor details concerning the fortnation of a team which will be gladly fur- nished by the Concordiensis to those inter- ested in rifle shootin,g·.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 11 can indicate it, the manner in which our 1'rojan friends view the situation : \Every R. P. I, man knows the reason for the long break between the two schools and it is not our intention to rehash it here. Be- cause the identity of the painter of the Union idol was never discovered tbe whole student body has been obliged to bear the odium of his thoughtlessness and lack of sport$man- ship, and it is a burden of whirh the present generation of 'Tute 1nen are by no means proud. That the rene·wal of intercourse gives us an opportunity to prove our sportsmanship and courtesy should be. as nn1ch a cause of pleasure as the fact that we are rega1n1ng a most valuable rival. ''The action of the Union men 1n so over- whelmingly agreeing to this measure (the vote was 290 to 8) is a great credit to them, and if we can rise 'to this occasion as well, there can be no doubt but that a long stretch of friendly ri-·valry is ahead.'

And then the vvhistle blew and the score stood 15-11 in favor of Union. GARNET FIVE AT DISADVANTAGE The game vvas particularly hard on the Garnet team fot the Williams court -vva~ but thirty feet wide or about fifteen feet nar- rower than fhe regulation basket ball court. This \vas quite a handicap to the men who had been used to the large regulation court of the Armory but they becan1e accustomed to it in time to overcome their handicap. TEAM PLAYS WELL The line-up r~ln'lined unchanged through- out the gatnc. 1\.lthoug-h Scully and Schell were taken along as extra players, Captain Beaver saw that the men were playing to- gether well and decided that no change was necessary. Woods at center, played his us- ual steady, consistent game and guarded his man closely. Houghton showed his skill at shooting fouls by caging three or four at- tempts. He also scored one :field basket. D. Beaver starred for Union, scoring three field baskets, while De\vey, with his two baskets just at the end of the game saved the day for Union. The Beaver twins were here, there and everyw heTe. It -vvas im pos- sible to guard them closely. Williams used three different men against ''Dave'' but to no advantage. He scored in spite of all they could do. Few fouls were called throughout the game but this was perhaps due to the referee. Four were called on Williams and two on Union.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS THE ALPHA OF N.EW YORK OF THE PHI BETA KAPPA The New York Alpha of the Phi Beta Kappa Society was instituted on the first day of May, 1817, by the concurring resolutions of the Alphas of Connecticut, l\1assachusetts and New Hampshire. A charter, signed and sealed by the president, the vice-president and the corresponding secretary of the Alpha of Connecticut was on that day transmitted, \vith a preamble and consitution, to the Hon- orable Chancellor l{ent, of Albany, the Rev- erend John Chester, of Albany and the Rev- erend Andrew Yates of Schenectady. The charter incorporated and established the gen- tlemen designated, with such others as they might associate with themselves in conformity with the laws of the Phi Beta Kap1)a, into a separate and distinct branch of tha society to beknown and called by the name of '' The Alpha of New York;\ and it granted them and their successors all the powers and priv- ileges and benefits thereunto appertaining in as full and ample a manner as the brethren of Connecticut, Massachusetts and N e\v Hampshire enjoyed the same. By virtue of the power vested in then1 the I-Ionorable James Kent, LL. D., Chancellor of the State of Ne\v York, the Reverend An- dre\v Yates, S. T. D., a professor in Union College, and the Reverend John Chester, A. M., minister of the Presbyterian Church in Albany, met at the house of Chancellor Kent, in Albany, on July, 1817 (the day not re- corded,) and proceeded to the business as- signed to them,by the Alphas of Yale, Har- vard and Dartmouth. At that titne they elected t\velve gentlemen to share the initial membership with the1n, an1ong- them the Reverend Doctor Eliphalet N ott, president of Union College, and Thomas C. Brownell, A. M., of the class of 1804, then a professor in Union College and later President of Washington, (no-vv Trinity) Colleg-e and Bishop of Connecticut. At an adjourned meeting, held in. Schenectady, on July 2 2, thirteen members \vere elected fron1 the sen- ior class of Union College. On July 24, twelve members vv:ere elected fro1n the dis- tinguis~e? class of 1818, among thetn Sidney Breese, George Washington Doane and Alonzo Potter. At other n1eetings, the or~ ganization of the Alpha was completed by the initiation of members elect, the election of officers, the adoption of by-la\ivs, the election of hon :->rary nl3mbcrs an :l the drafting of a form of initiation. Under the constitutio:1 transmitte-J by the Alpha of Connecticut and the by-laV\rs subse- ql1.ently aclopte:.l activity was c1ntem·)1atcc1 as a literary society holding n1onthly n1eetin,Q·s through the college year and an annual ex- hibition on the afternoon preceding com- n1encement to be addressed by an invited orator. The New York Alpha so began anc1 so continued for many years. The literary exercises prescribed by the constitution were written debate, extemporaneous debate and declan1::ttion. These were performed with varying assiduity. The subjects discussed vvere in general those of current interest-po- litical, moral, theological, literary, educa- tional and scientific-· \vith a sprinkling of the favorites of m:tny generations of youth. It is interesting to note that on March 18, 1820, 'iVilliam H. Ste\varcl, then a senior in Union College, debated on the negative and 1osirtg side of the question, ''Ought the territory of Missouri to be adn1itted into the ·union ·with- out the proposed res~riction?'' The question '' Arc cau~us n 1n1inations by representatives of a state consistent with the liberties of a free people?\ \vas proposed at the meeting· of May 8, 1824. It never arrivei at discussion. ' This question is still before the house. It does not appear that the Ne\v York Al- pha as an undergraduate literary society ever met with favor equal to that accorded to the other tn8re inclusive literary societies one of vvhich was older than the colleg-e itself. The most active interest \vas the elec- tion of n1embers, conducted, seen1ingly, vvithout n1uch 1nterference frotn facnltr or other .~·racluate n1cn1bers : contention \vaxed \YDX111 at tin1es and tncctinp:s \ven: ac 01 fr fe fr m 01 e1 u· at ft sc c: t (' \, o! c lE s1 B a 11 p a t r ( l' l ] t l

Union was a1nong the first of Amercan col- leges-probably, in fact, the first-to relax the rigidity of the classical course; a mo:re modern alternative to that course was offered from the founding of the col1ege (1795), a scientific course was established in 1828, and course in engineering in 1845. Prior to 1854 no express discrimination lay against any course in determini 11g eligibility to Phi Beta Kappa; but in that year it vvas voted that election to the society be restricted to t bose whom the faculty deemed entitled to a Latin diploma as classical students.

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS FR'ESHMAN BANQ U:ET Frosh Hold Annual, Dinner U ft;molested ~By Second-Year Mem The long-expected and much-talked-of Freshman Banquet is now a ma..~ter of history. The class of 1916 made its formal bow to the College Satu Jday night when it held vYhat is generally admitted to have be€n one of the best banquets in the history nf the College. There are four things necessary to the sucess of any Freshman Banquet: N()n -interference by the sophomores, good atte-n.dance, a good dinner and good speeches, aad 1916's ban- quet excelled in every one oi these. The Banquet Committee had been Dnable to se- cure a hotel,. bttt finally the Rensselaer Inn was procur-ed and terms mad_e whereby the n1.anager guaranteed that no unruly sop ho- 1nores sho-uld find their ways into the festive hall or get any opportunity to &reak up the ban- quet. Chairman Jackson kept things quiet, not a whisper of the affair g;ot aronnd the Campus uniil Saturday afternoon. Even then, it -vvas difficult to arouse any interest an1ong the second-ye~rr n1en for they had been fooled so often that tbey \vere get- ting skeptical but, when no f-reshn1en \Yere to be found on the Campus and ihe upperclas- tnen departed immediately after dinner, they realized that the report must b.e true. A crowd of the n1o-re daring spirits b()arded the first available Troy car, resolved io do what they could. Tvvo or three fresh1nen were found on the car, \\vho were treated io half-hearted hair-cuts. but nothing else of interest Dccu rred till the cro·\Vd reached the In_!l. The main entrance being- unguarded for the moment, the sophomores all walked in but, like the boy in the story, they \ walked right in, t11rned around a11d walked right out again'' for four big husky Troy cops met them and requested (?) that they ''beat it quick.\ \ Beat it \ they did and that was the end S() far as the sophornores were con- cerned. At nine-thirty the banq11et ball was opened, A bout seventy-five plates were set. Between the courses of a most delicious dinner various speeches were made. Male '13, president o£ the ~senior class, acted as toastmaster. He introduced the following men, who spoke at greater or less length: Brown '16, ·sarvey '14, Pierson '16, president of the freshrnan class, Mayham '13, Barkley '14, president of the junior class, Davis , 13 and Fisch1e '13. Pres1dent Pierson and Brown '16 had gone to Troy Friday night so as to be sure that nothing should keep the president a\vay. About eleven o'clock, Vaughan '14, assi~t­ ant n1anager of Basketball, received a tele- gram from Rochester giving the score of the Rochester-Union game, 23-21. What a ye11- ing and cheering- ensued ! It just topped off the banquet in splendid style. The cabaret singers visited the ha11 at frequent in ter.vals and their songs \vere greeted with great applause. A little before midnight the banquet broke up and the men . began to leave. A large cro\vd of R. P. I. students \vere in the cabaret and the two colleges yelled for each other again and agatn. The fact that the men can n1eet in this \vay is atnple proof of the con1plete reconciliation bebvecn the t\vo institutions. It was late ·when the uppcrclassn1en a11<.l freshmen reached the '' Hill,'' but it \vas unanimously agreed that the banquet ha.<1 been a huge success and that any delay in holding it had been fully recompensed by the style in vvhich it \Vas \ pulled off.\ The com itt( e in charg-e \vas : Jackson, chairman, Bro\vn, Hopkins and Danner. ---:0:-- The band has been recently reorganized after the loss of three or four of its best n1en1- bers as a result of the fall term exatninations.

GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS In the present period of civilization, an era of speed, excitement, new thoughts, Social- ists and Suffragettes, V\re know not with what manner of salutation to greet our fair guests. Shall '\Ve address you as cotnrades, which you mustkno-vv is the prevalent term of g1·eetingin Socialistic Schenectady, or perhaps as fello\v voters which is also an accepted hailing sign in the west and in certain exclusive· secttons of our city, or, may it merely be girls. If '\Ve chose the latter as the favored one we seem to be hopelessly lacking in originality but yet, \vhere can the man be found who has ever succeeded in adopting an original nomenclature for the female of the race. It requires the mind and hand of a genius or pastmaster ~o write about women and be so exhausting in his dealing of the attractive subject that his readers, after delving into the deep recesses of the study of woman· kind are . supplied with an abundance ·of ap- peHations for the g-enus feminae. Indeed we feel that we have gone beyond our depth in attempting to discuss the sub- ject of girls, sHU this is your issue and if we didn't n1a}{e an attempt at feminine fan- cies, \Ve fear yo11 might feel slighted. In glancing over tbe remarks of a R 11tgers friend, we find hin1 to be nigh unto the pro- verbial pessin1ist. His assertions are that g-irls are like t:>hi1'osophy-the more yo11 stndy then1 the less yo1J Jcnow, but that n1en keep on trying to know t'hen1 just the san1e and tl1af s the reason so many fellows are grouchy a good part of the time. He believes that there are several prominent types of girls. Son1e girls beHeve what we say and others are sensible. . Some girls are sentitne11ta1, and others reaHy Ti.ke us when they say so. Some girls smile because they \vant to, others have studied the effect in their tntrrors. Now be s ams up the matter and tells us about the species in general. Gir1s are like the sancl-;vve n1ake an itnpression upon thetn for a shot-t tilnc ~ but a nevv love comes in with the rising tide and n1en1ories of us are vvashed a. way in the overflo\v. Pardon us for vvandering so far into the realms of the unkn<nvn, long ago 've should have made known t() you our joy at your presence an1ong us a.nd to have expressed to you a most hea1·ty and cordial -vvelcome. Doubtless you ha-ve observed that our insti- tution was formed by the coming together of people of various rn..inds and talents. \Ve have always stood for union in one way or another and have ever detested solitude. It has beco1ne inheJ-ent with us to desire con1- pany and the older we grow the more potent becomes that deshe. The Faculty have kindly consented to pertnit us to forget study 0 1< s ,~ r a: Sl 01 h 01 p n H b: 01 a1 fc he A U] a1 tc nJ of 1)( at ex to q1 G Ol ar ty Sl

Vv e sincerly hope that your short stay at T_Tnion n1ay be a pleasurable (i)ne and even if, as our pessimistic friend olairns, the in1pves ... sion :which Union vvill n1ake UQ)011 you may be only te1nporary, -vv:e trust it vvtH be a favora- blc one and that you will visit ·us again in order that the in1pression shaH be 1nade more permanent, for psychology assures us t11at repetitions oftimes render irnprcssions last- ing. ---:0:-- EVE·RYTHING READY FOR PROM The J unioT Promenade 'vill be held in the ball room of the TenEyck Hotel at Albany, on Friday evening, January 3[.

THE CON'CORDIENSIS (The editors are not responsible br any ideas or opinions expressed in this column and insist that all communications submitted be signed.) THE SlfFFHAGISTS To the editor: .rr~hcre has been C()nsiderable criticisn1 on the 'I hill '' lately of the recent. '' hike '' of some suffragists fron-w New York to Albany and also of the propo.sed \ivalk from New York to Washington, next month. The Woman Suffrage question is one of present day im- portance, especially as it will probably come before the people of tbis · state· in· -1915 .. for\ their direct yote. Since there ·appears to be son1e misunderstand:lng as to the purposes of these '' pilgrims '' rnay I say a fe\v words in their defense? It takes many sorts of -people to make up this world of ours. and, among others, there are those who think that they have grasped a great idea anc1 they are so anxious to see this idea put into e-ffect -· . that they are willing- to give time and energy, . and receive severe eriticisn1s and undesired -publicity in their efforts to· help make their idea effective. Th_en there are the n1ore conservative people v\rho take these ideas · ' n1ore slo\v1y and ca1nl1y at~cl give then1. ·such - support as they n1ay, through conventional channels. A much si1nilar .case to our pres- ent one \vas the abolition tnovetnent before the Civil \var. Those barely spirits -vvho start- ed that movement \Vet:e subjected to all sorts of ridicule and conte1npt, but they felt that they -vvere right and persisted. At that titne vv-e were fighting for the emancipatation of the colored race. No\v we desire the free- dom of '\YOtnan, not tl1e freedom from home life and family responsibilties so tnuch as the opportunity to help in the elimination of such conditions and institutions as n1ay harm the life and welfare of the fatnily and the future of their children. I believe, that a ]arge part of the n1en of this country are \villing· to give 'von1an the ... .. . po,ver of .sufftage·, but, 'like a hhndred otheT good ideas, th-is thought is held~ back, by a lack of kno\vledge of the facts, ·an inertia and lack of in.it1ative, a conservation \Vhich ofte~ prevents them from .supp.orting, their . ideal. If -vve -vvere aU teasoning.creatur~s,_ the qtles- tions of right and expediency would soon be sett1ec1 b·ut n1ost of us a1'e still. guided by emotion, popular opinion and an etn·ulation of popular leaders, and so, it seems to me ) the leaders of the suffrage n1ovement. are taking advantage of real psychological facts .in pursu-ing their present co-urse.- __ First of a11, the walkers \vi11 have an opportunity. to address 1:housancts·of·peopl-e;ov. the \:vay; the suffrage I' literature'' \vilr,.be ~histribnted · for • \' -TO I , a. few days it \vill be~a su1]j;ec\tbf co~versation ' • ' • I ~ .. • ' • ~ in the -waysid~ homes: :the ~criticism vd11 . . __ ,,. i . - . . arouse its supporters .in_ the.-\many fatnili~s . . - r· J. • . to a defense .of their, . posit'ipn ·,j and result in ... . . -~- ,. . . ;1 .· the vvinning over. or .tnfiny ~~people. to the n1.oi~e reasona bl~ vi~w '9f.'ikle 1t.atter. .
