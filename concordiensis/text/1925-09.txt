And there are engineers of the General Electric Company especially assigned to mining problems and requirements, just as there are others special- izing in all major applications of electricity. A new series of G-E advertise• ments showing what electricity is doing in many fields will be sent on request. Ask for book- let GEK-1 Mesabi Range, renowned iron ore deposit, is yield· ing its mineral wealth at the rate of 16 tons for every bite of an electric scoop. A man_ with a shovel wou1d work a whole day to mine and load ·eight cubic yards of iron ore which this 300-ton electric giant moves in one minute. Of course, all mining is not done on the surface. But there are many mines in which electricity has changed our conception of mining operations. Wires, pene· tratbg even to the deepest shafts and galleries, have brought light, power, ventilation and added safety to thos~ who must work in the very bowels of the earth. Electricity's contribution to mining may be of partie· ular interest to the student of mining engineering, but it is of general interest to all coli egc men as still another example of how electricity is simplifying the world's work. 7•51DH GENERAL ELECTRIC GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY, NEW YOR.K President Ip.comp1E Thi BiSHOP List Is M< nowne Col Beginning 27, chapel > Sunday in ' the college begin at 11 required of body excep· cuses for President C has outlinE alre<!!dY sec vices.
