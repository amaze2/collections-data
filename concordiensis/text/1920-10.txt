Properly applied, it drives giant locomotives across the continental divide, tows ocean liners through the Panama Canal, or propels huge ships. Through good light, safe signals, and illumin- ated highways, it is making travel better and safer and also is increasing the usefulness of transportati()n methods on land, sea or in . the air. In short, electricity is revolutionizing trans- portation, making it quicker,safer,more eco- nomical and reliable in all sorts of weather. And back of this development in electric transportation, in generating and transmit- ting apparatus as well as motive mechan- isms, are the co-ordinated scientific, engi- neering and manufacturing resources of the General Electric Company, to the end that electricity may better --\\~\\\ serve mankind.

In the days when it was only necessary for one to gird his loins and hie himself · around the corner, where the buxom OCTOBER 24 to 27 U ndouhtedly there is a slight ebbing away from the Republican strength, which was at high tide three weeks ago. That is due not so much to Democratic gaitlS as to Republican loss of interest. Elec- tions are largely a matter o:f crowd psychology, and it is hard to keep the interest oi the crowd at top pitch ior five weeks. The Republican campaign ripened too early. It is like a crowd in a theatre. If a play were so constructed as to come to a climax at the end of the second act, with the plot all clear and the outcome easily apparent, under such circumstances i.t would be diiiicult to keep the crowd in the theater and their interest on the stage during the last two acts. In one section oi the country this ebbing oi strength is enough to turn what might have been several Republican victories into genu- inely doubtful fights. The Republican claims about the border states and the South have been beyond what the facts have justified ~t any time. The Republicans have talked about carrying North Carolina. I have made no survey oi th~t state. I asked Josehpus Daniels about it, and he laughed in a way that seemed to me to have evidential value. I don't think the RepubE<:ans will carry Tennessee either or even come close to carrying it. But undoubtedly there was at one time, and to some extent still is, a condition in Tennessee that justifies the Republicans in ex:pecting to do better there than ever before. There are several elements in it, but one of the most substantial is quiet ·disaffection of a good many Democratic business men, large and small. They disappro\·e of many features oi Wilson's Administra- tion. The other day I overheard a Southern business man, who had been whipsawed between the failing price of cotton and the rising price of coal, say to his neighbor; \If you make money, you're a profiteer, and the Government prosecutes you and takes it away from you. If you lose money. what are you? A lositeer then, and cloes the Gov- ernment give it hack to you?\ That kind of grouch generally ex- presses itself in a \·ote against the party in pO\ver; and among busi- ness men there is almost as much of that kind of resentment in the Southern and border States as elsewhere.

P. T. Remember that a pointer must be turned down over each candidate for whom you wish to vote. Begin at the left end of the ballot and turn down one Pointer in each office column and you will not miss any. Remember that there are TvVO questions to be voted on. So be sure to turn down TWO question pointers. Be sur;e to leave the Pointers DOWN in their voting positions. The machine will turn them back as it registers your vote, and be- fore it opens the Curtain. As the vote is not registered until the Curtain Lever is moved to open the Curtain, you can change your vote as much as you desire while the Cur- tain Lever is :in its \closed'' position (at the right). As the machine prevents you from turning down more than the proper number of Pointers for each office ' there is no danger of your spoiling your vote.· Machines will be on publ-ic exhibi- tion in several places and for several days before election. Be sure to call . and practice on one until you are sure you know how to operate it and where to find the names of the candidates you wish to vote for and the ques- tions. By ~oing this you will save much time and avoid much trouble on ele-ction day-both for yourself and for other voters. wwfotptobco(kS Albany .Street, just abo:ve the Armory SUNDAY TO WEDNESDAY OCT. 31 TO Nov. 3 Constance Talmadge in SEARCH OF A SINNER Also a Two Reel Special Comedy THURSDAY TO SATURDAY NOVEMBER 4 TO 6 LEW CODY in The Butterfly Man Also a Two Reel Special Comedy 1,200 Seat~ Symphony Orchestra MUSICAL ATTRACTIONS YOUNG MEN'S TOGGERY _HATS AND CAPS ARE TO BE -FOUND HERE As soon as produced.

Would be politicians are attempt- ing to explain this fact by the sug- gestion that the more. mature judge- mellt of the faculty leads them to take the wiser course. Strong-willed stu- dents reply that they d<;~ not wish to depend on any more promises of the Democratic party, that they did not like the way they were kept out of war during the present administration and that they do not favor an entaug- ling nation league. Even in co-educational institutions where there is a comparatively large woman vote, the Democratic candi- Q.ate lacked much in popularity. This is taken as an indication that the wo- man too, while not wishing further war, have little faith in 'Wilsonian policies as advocated by the Ohio governor. Varsity Faces R. I.
