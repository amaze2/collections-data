In predons vears the \C\ award in track was made for winning five points in at;;: one meet of the season. The avowed purpose of'l this change to ten points in the entire season, is to make it easier to. win the coveted award. Figures 'voulcl disprove this claim. Of the 1 six letters awarded for the first time last year, two of the men woulcil not have received them under this new ruling while no further award would han l1cen made. To \·in ten points in a season of four track meets, without winning a first place, it is necessary to gain three seconds and a third. But this move tn give the letter for a total effort is a good om for it furnishes an incentive to the hard working mnner who is phys- ically incapable of doing more than placing. The plea for men to come ont has been eloquent in the past few years, but the response has not been encouraging.

To arrang-e a curriculum in a course for the cultivation of Inanners could easily he made a matter for grave consideration. ft is to be hoped that these high school pupils will not only he taught to find \what is the 1natter \vith this picture?\ There is no question hut that it is of importance that people should know how to eat corn on the cob. and whether or not it is proper to allow the waiter to pick. up the fallen fork. I But manners have a function not limited to the \part(' or the \social\; any course in manners, su-ch as instituted in the New York schools, should purpose first of all, to teach individuals the best \Vay of being friendly. :\fan is essentially a social being; the structure oJ society is so inclusive and pervading that the individual has prac- tically no Jife outside of it. Most of the time people live in crowds, and in order that the cro\'\'d be friendly the individuals in the crowdl nust be friendly. l\lan cannot escape from his life as a member of a crowd, and accordingly a proposition to teach manners should be a movement to teach the individuals in the .crowd how to be more friendly. I The establishment of amicable relations between man and man 1s a worthy aim. A school in manners that will teach men to keep off other people's corns \vill do much toward increasing ou-r love for the proYerhial neighbor. A good curriculum in the subject should include a course in the consideration and forgiveness of the other man's faults. A little regard for somebody besides ego should be axiom number one for the student of manners. There is much exclaiming- no\vaclays over the misfortune that young- people are not as pol·itc as their fathers were bef0re them. Such complainers are usually equipped with poor memories. Young- sters in all titnes ancl climes have had one universal failing-they \'\'.ere young. People ought to be glad that this present generation do not lack boisterousness, vigor, and even occasionally a J.ittle mis- ·Chief in their makeups. Then later, the youngsters blossom out into young men and women, and during those trying days it is a:Jl import- ant to know exactly what should be done on certain occasions. Cor- rectness at this awkward age makes all the difference between misery and pleasure. Then it is that they must be taught that higher man-. ner, which is associated with sympathy for, ancl understanding of, the other fellow. There should be in every school a course in teaching individuals indirectly be construed as fishing for app ause. amongst this modern youth.

The members of the 1922 season team caB retire feeling that their season has bee11 a success-the splenclicl victory over Hamilton more than makes up fur any deficiencies which might have been encountered in earlier games of the season. \Vinning not only by the largest score of its schedule. hut also over its closest and most friendly rival, the team is truly in line for the congratulations of the students who supported the players throughout the season. The concluding victory of the football team is a note of encour- agement for the next sport on the program-basketball. A chance for continued student support presents itself here from the very firs.t. The majority of the contests will be played at home, according to te:ntath•e schedules. The result should be 100 per cent attendance at every game of the student body. He who must rest from attendaBce at athl.etic contests has nearly a month-but let ·him he ·in Union's cheer- ing- section from the first, and then on. THE RED CROSS APPEALS In its sixth annual roll call, the Red Cross again comes before the public for members, which it must have in order to effectively carry :forward the relief 'vork which it conducts in all parts of the world. Although no special drive is being made among the students at Union, they are urged to contribute through the enrollment booths which are located in the downtown section of the dty.

Pitt, Jr., '24 Tuesday, November 21, 1922 RESUMPTION WITH Rf..NSSELAER In student body meeting yesterday the motion was made, sec- onded, and passed that Union college should take steps to renew\ athletic relations with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. There was 1 no question uf the sentiment or attitude of the students suppqrting, this movement for renewal; the enthusiastic reception tendered alii the speakers favoring the motion bears witness that the whole under-1 graduate body is in favJr of such resmnpti0n. Already the Terrace I Council has taken the steps necessary for the formal presentation ef 1 the attitude and desire of the union student body in connection with the furtherance of relations \vith R. P. I. That this step toward resumption was made with unanimity is significant and eYiclences a highly desirable attitude. If relations are to lw resumed-and that is the hope of every Union college man -it is essential that this reconciliation be ·wholehearted. Unanimity of pnrpose is essential to permanency. Had a single student yester- day helieYed that this action constituted btt t a temporary patching up of an essentially irreconcilable dissensio11. it is certain that the motion for rene\\·al of relations would ne\··er have been made. One of the speakers brought up the fact that Union and Rens-1 selrter have broken off eight times within the past twenty years. This fact was not used as an argument for non-resumption. On the con- trary. it sened to emphasize the necessity :for establishing this re- sumption on a sound ba·sis. Speake.rs characterized this apparent 1 : inahility to compete amicably as \babyish.\ And despite the evident desire of all the speakers tl;at relations should be resumed, the stu- dent body was asked to vote the proposition down if it was feh that,, relations could not be maintained on a permanent basis. By their vote Union students have .e:x;pr.essed the opinion and the desire that there should be an enduring connection between these bNo institutions of higher lean1ing, situated so closely together. All propagati.da to the effect that proximity is a bar to cordial relation- ship, or that the men of one institution are superior to those of the other,-all such is nonsense. It is not nonsense, however, to remind stuclen ts that in every group there is always an irresponsible element, whose members do not represent the set1timent of any hut themselves. It is an encour-. aging predilection that the vote in favor of res ttmption was unanimous and that there are no \hitter-enders' here at Union to form a dis- :sentious element. Both student bodies have been at fault in the past in attributing the actions of individua:ls to the entire group of which the individuals happen to be members. Union is not unique -or mille-nial in this respect,-unfortunate1y it must he admitted that we possess an element by which the student body as a w.hole does not ·desire to be judged. Union mert should i:udge as they would be judged-. J;iot by the spirit shown by the conspicuous, hurrahing, trtitiotity but by the good wiU evidert·ced by t'he maJority. Breaks in relati·onship have been regretted in the past because of a too hasty assumption o.f guilt.

THE ACTION OF THE ATHLETIC BOARD' The action taken by the Athletic Board in regard to the pro-\ posed changes in the by-laws has met with general satisfaction on i the campus. The provisions dealing with a new basis for making awards in the major, minor and class sports have received commen- dation in most quarters. The chief problems confronti·ng the Ath- letic Board for decision 'were (1) the advisability of awarding a· etandardized sweater for all sport in place of the present award of a distinctive sweater for each sport; (2) the clarification of the dis-, tinction between the minor ancl major sport sweaters; (3) the definition of elig-i'hility for class numerals; (4) the eligihilitv of \L'\ and \aU a\ men to vote for team captains: (5) the creatio;1 of per- manent executin~ and awards committees; and (6) the basis for the award of the track letter. The changes aclupted and the decisions made all tend to the separation and differentiation Df the various sports. In every instance it \\\as voted that differences shoulcl l)e j recognized and proper distinction made where it existed. 1 ' The .\thletic Buard voted clmvn the proposal to standardize the award for all major sports. The man \Yhu desires a distinctive re- ward for \\'hat is clistiinctive effort expresses a perfectly natural in- stinct. .-\nd nnder the proposed change wherein lies the distinction of the two or three letter man? Certainly differentiation makes tuwanls desirable definition and encouraging distinction. The same arg-ument substanbiates the action taken in clearly emphasizing the distinction between the major and minor sports sweater. The minor sport sweater will nmv be either black or white ·with a garnet Gothic: \l\'' on the breast and the small letters indicating the individual! sport outside of the \C.'' The very fact that sports are distinguished 1 as minor and major \vould naturally assume a distinction in award. The difference in the work undertaken by a major and a minor sport team makes it only fair that the award should be deiiruitely different. 1 The new by-laws dealing with the award of numerals clarify a matter which has heen a source of irritation ever since the one seme- • gtcr rule went in to t'ffcct three years ago. Numerals have become: ~o common on the campus that they mean little, and the diversity of ways in \vhich thq· have been earned heretofore has long been a matter of mystery. Certainly the men on the freshman football .ancl hnskethall squacls deserve some substantial recognition for their' work <tncl under the new plan they will be awarded their numerals complete, Le .. 1926. The only others eligible for numerals are the 1 rnemhers of a winning inter-class team. who will be given the last tv;o figures of their d<Jss numerals, i.e., '26. .I EXHIBITION OF FINCHLEY CLOTHING AND HABERDASHERY i I \ SUITS OVER-GARMENTS GOLF SUITS At Washburn Hall Monday, November 27 Tom Carlson, Representative WHITE OXFORD AND MADRAS SHIRTS, COLLAR ATTACHED NECKWEAR TUXEDO AiVD FCLL DRESS SUITS WOOl.
