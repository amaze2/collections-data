Solid Comfort RJ.clic AT LA.fAY~EfTE ;Harold Anson Hruce, head of the department of physical training and coach of track -and field athletics at Lafayette College, for the past 15 · year.s, yesterday afternoon presented . to J ohH Henry MacCra9ken, president of Lafayette, his resignation, which will be presented t·o t·he board of ·trus- tees for their consideration at the ne~t i . meeting. Dr. Ma:cCracken ex.pressed his deep regret ever Mr. Bruce'1s de- cision to leave Lafayette and stated that the college would suffer a great loss. The announcement of Bruce's resignation wiU come as a great sur- prise to aU those conne<;ted with the .institution and his many friends there ·in Easton. He had become one of the real figures associated with Lafayette College and his manifest love· for .the coHege ,seemed to remove any .p<>ssi- ·b.ility o.f his ever leaving there. .Two years ago Union College offi- cials conferred with Coaoh Bruce re- garding his coming to their institution as the head ·Of the ·phy.sical depar.tment, but at the latter's sug.gestion, negotia- tions were dw.pped. Several weeks ago when it became known that Mr. Oliphant would leave Union to 'enter business at the end of 1 ! the present college year, Bntce was 1 again approached regardin,g the posi- tion and the offer made was s·o attrac- tive that he felt ·he could not afford to ignore it. His departure from Lafayette Cor- lege will mark the passing of one of . the institutio11s most illustrious fig- · ures in the past fifteen years. The friend of all the undergraduates and the friend of hundreds o0f .alumni, through his close personal touch, Bruce was perha;ps the most wi<lely known · figure personally connected with L,.a- . fayette. Harnold Anson Bruce, the son of the late Winslow Lewis Bruoe, of Bos- ton, Mass., and Mrs. Margaret Jane Bru.ce, of New York City, came to ):_,a- fayette in 1909, following ·his gradua- tion from the Sargent Normal School of Physical Taining that year. While he completed :his work at the Sargent School he was instructor in Physical Training at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. TICK! TI....? .... CK! TI....

There is a great opportunity to interest the fathers in the well-being of the college.
