I t was somewhat after noon on one of the ~ hottest days of last September that my friend and I found ourselves at Shokan, a sn1all village situated on the Ulster and Del- = ,. . aware R. R.. \Ve at once· betook ourselves to the only hotel in 1 th·e place and ordered dinner, which the land-laHy dssured us would be ready in five minutes, if we wished to take a train which was due in a quarter of an hour; or could riot be served in less than half an I1otir if we were riot going to take the train. · As \ve had no intention of taking that or any other train we waited the half hour rather impatiently as we had that morning walked about fifteen miles and had generated appetites which seemed to us e-minently cal- culated to produce a fatnine in Shokan . After spending the half hour studying our guide books and in drinking an incredible . amount of ice water, (it was a temperance hotel) dinner was announced and while we are doing it \ample justice\; I'll atternpt to explain who we are, and why we two youths are thus found traveling on foot at such a distance from our anxious n1ammas. The heroes of this mild adventure are two students from different colleges who have turnetl amateur tramps and are spending the last week of their vacation in \doing\ the Cat .. skills on foot; they have \sworn off on\ railroads, and regard horses and wagons with disdatn. The subject of tran1ping was one of my friend's favorite hobbies, and when he had once gotten fully astride of it, I think that anyone would grant that his equestrian skill ·twas not to be sneered at. He was also possessed of a firm faith in the efficacy of long vvalks to cure any malctdy that is cura- ble, and stood ready to back up his convic- tions \Vith arguments whose length rendered them quite irresistble. The season before while in the Shawan- gunk Mts. we had demonstrated our ability as rnountain climbers, anrl without any hesi- tancy we had now atternpted a generally considered impracticable route to Slide Mt. frorn the east. Shokan is situated in the sou the astern part of the Catskills in the narrow valley of the Esopus Cree],<. In the southwest at about an equal distance fron1 the village rise

Almost directly west, on a line which would cross the sumtnit of Mt. Cornell, yet two or three mires behind that mountain stand Slide Mt., the highest peak of the Catskills rising to a height of 4.,200 feet. This tnountain receives its natne frorn an enormous land slide which on its southern side extends from summit to · base. According to the guide books it_ is impossible to reach Slide 1\tit. from Shokan, except by going up the Esopus Valley to Big Indian and then down another valley to the foot of said mountain. This is the usual route, and would make the distance frotn · Shokan to Slide· M t. about thirty n1iles while in an air line it is not over ten. I believe that discretion is one of the about the hotel concerning the tnost direct road to Mt. Cornell, having at last found an old wood~-man, we were informed that there was· a woodroad which had not been used in · about I 5 years which ran about half way up . Mt. Cornell; and that if we would take the road which led out of the village toward the west. and turn ·off at a certain saw mill we would have no difficuity in finding this wood- road. As it was already after two o'clock and everything seemed to indicate that we could not reach Dutcher's hotel by supper tiLne, I bought a pound of cakes for a lunch, and strapped them firmly with a rubber coat, which with two umbrellas was the only bag- gage we carried. For the first four n1iles the road which we had taken followed the general direction of a strean1, which frotn the breadth of its bed and the height of the bridges ·which crossed things that con1e to a fellow along with a it, we judged was at times a seething torrent. bald head and a family.

After \' ing to the guide books-and I would take having walked about an hour I stopped along this opp0rtunity to remark that it is my the,vay and inquired the distance to the n1i1l firm convtctton based upon experie~c-es of which I have spoken.

As we didn't feel inclined to retrace our steps, we followed this beautiful clove along whose sides rose per- pendicular mountains to the height of from 2 ,ooo to 2,500 feet, until its junction with the Esopus Valley at Phceniccia. After dinner at the Tremple House we rested a couple of hours and then, not feeling any the worse for our night's experience, \Ve walked fifteen rniles through the Stony Clove to Tannersville. Although very tired I was not sleepy, per- haps it was due to the fact that a few bears and wild cats still lurk in these mountains. As we were at least -six miles from the nearest house and had no more effective weapon than a club, I did not care to give either of the said anin1als the advantage that they would have if they should attack us when we were asleep. Once I heard a crash in the branches of a tree near by, as if made by some heavy object in springing from one branch to another_ I grasped my club and waited breathlessly.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. LIBRARY NQ·TES. AU communications, inquiries, suggestions, &c., concerning this departm,ent, shouldbe addressed to H. 0. Mandeville,. P. 0. Box 4:60, and .if of sufficient importance will be published or answered in these cnlumns. WHAT IS PROPOSED. It is a recognized fact that, while our col- lege library contains, with the accession of the libraries of the literary societies, some Jo,ooo · volun1es, comparatively few students ever avail then1selves of its resources. This con- dition of affairs comes, it is believ~d, from ignorance as to the resources of the .. library, and the methods required in consulting and reaching them. The purpose of this depart- ment is to thoroughly explain the tnethods of its classification and catalogues and the most practical tnethod for their use by readers. It will aim to explain the ntost convenient and best tnanner of finJing everything the library contains on any given subject, will give aid to readers in methods of cross refe- rence and will strive in every way to make the library of practical benefit to the students. ·ro this end it will open its colrZJnns for any reasonable inquiries or coJnJnztnications con- cerning the library and will pu bli~h in each nurnber such n1atter as will best advance the aims above stated. The working power of a library of this size is itnmense, if properly understood, and should not be lost by so great a proportion of college rnen. Men working up essays, orations and debates, men having problen1s to solve, detnonstrations to deduce or any subject to look up, will find the library of great utility. the desire of the Library committee that the library be of actual benefit to the students and not a mere accumulatio a of books. As the library is to benefit the student, suggestions or criticisms concerning the library or its n1anagement, either signed or anonymous or any evidence of active interest will be received a5 favors. THE CLASSIFICATION. The classification of the library is known as the Dewey decimal classification and is essentially as follows. All books and mss. on any given subject stand together on the shelves. A printed alphabetical index fur- nished on demand at the hb~ary, ·.gives at a glance the number of any subject These numbers are largely rnnern.onic, thus greatly simplifving their use and aiding the memory; e. g. 942 covers as vvill be seen by reference to the printed classification, the subject of English History. Each figure has its n1eaning, 9 is I-Iistory, 4 Europe, 2 Engl~nd. In the same way 5 r 6 means Analytical Geometery. These are simply decimals, the library being the unit. The n1ain classes are I Philosophy, 2 Reli- gion, 3 Sociology, 4 Philology, 5 Natural Science, 6 Useful Arts, 7 Fine Arts, 8 Literature, 9 History. Each of these classes are again sub divided and by a continuation of this sub-division the classification is made to include the broadest generic and the most specific heads. No study of the scheme is required and the reader has only to open the alphabetical index to any ot the nan1es. by which the subject he wants is known and its number is found. The entire library, excepting the books of the literary societies which have just come in, is arranged according to this plan and the different classes follow e:ach other nutnericaly on the shelves. The privilege of handling the books thetn- selves and of working freely with the whole · literature of subjects is, if rightly used, an education in itself, and it is hoped, that by explaining the resources of the library and the methods of reaching them, this depart- ment n1ay, in son1e degree, contribute to· Explanations of the n1ore special features of the classification, with suggestions for its use will be gladly given at the library and will be more fully treated hereafter.

THE CONCORDIENSlS. 7 The Castaway. (A. l'i!teral translation from the Gertnan of 11eJine.) • OPE and love, all in ruins lie ; And I, like a dead one · Whom the angry sea casts forth, Lie upon the strand- A barren, desolate strand. Before me rock the watery wastes, Behind lie woe and sorrow only. And over me float the clouds, The gray, shapeless daughters of the air, Who from the sea in mist The wr~ters draw, And wearily draw and draw And ag·ain emptv them into the sea- A hope ess, toilsome task Unprofitable as my own life. The waves murmur and the seag·ulls scream, Old memories float before me, Forgotten dreams and vanished forms, Painful yet sweet appear they. In the northland lives there a woman, A beautiful, queenl~· woman, Her g·raceful, slender form A tempting· white robe clothes. The dark abundant locks Like a l0\ 7 ely night. flow down From the high tress-crowned head, They curl themselves dreamlike Around that sweet pale tace, That sweet pale face from which, Large and piercing·, bt.:am eyes Like dark suns. 0! ye dark suns, how oft I How oft, en· aptured drank I from you Inspiration's wild ardor ! And reeled with mad transport! 'I ill dovelil{e swept there a smile Across those baught y lips, And those proud haughty lips Breathed words sweet as the moon-lit eve, And tender as the perfumes of the rose, And my glad soul soared up As flies the eagle toward heaven. Be silent waves and gulls! .All is past, happiness and hope, Hope and love ! I lie upon the earth, A wretched, shipwPeck man; And press my burnin!Z' face Into the sea drenched sand. The Lawn Tennls Tournament.

EDITORIAL. llJITH this number of the Concordie1zsis we VV hope to enter on a new era in the ex- istence of the paper. Heretofore the position of editor has heen anything but a sinecure, and the paper itself hardly the student's organ. Other colleges have representative sheets which are supported well by the students, why not the satne interest at Union? The last board of editors went out from their work on this paper thoroughly disgusted. Why ? Because they had been elected to the position and when they endeavored to get subscriptions or help in the literary.way, they were met by men \vho showed no interest and almost ignored the fact of the existence of such a paper. Now we hope lhe views of the students have been changed by the talk of the Business Editor in Chapel. We pro- pose to represent the College's interest if the THE beginning of the new College year brings with it changes in t~e Faculty by which we lose a Professor who has been for twenty-five years identified with interests of the College as student, alun1nus and pro- fessor, and· through all a warm friend of Union ; and an adjunct Professor who was with us but a short time but who in that short period showed a deep interest in the ~ffairs of the College and students. Case Institute, of Cleveland, is the gainer by the acquisition of a Presid~nt, both a thoroughly practical, scientific scholar and a n1an nf no mean faculties of financiering, two things necessary in th~ head of such an institution ; besides possessing a warm-hearted friendship toward young men in the pursuit of practical and theoretical knowledge in professional callings. ·We are sure that we voice the sen- timent of all who have been associated with him at Union, when we wish hirn success in his nevv field and express regret at our loss. To Prof. DePuy we extend the same expres- _ sion of regret and wishes for his success in the profession to which he has returned. ,. l f. l t:
