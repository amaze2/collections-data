There has been no dearth of such advice and information 1'or the neophyte in tht! past two weeks, much of it contradic- tory, and ~his because different peda- gogues endeavor to exemplify in their lives different phG~.ses of the value aml purpose of a coHege education. Thete is the type of student, as yon will find, whe> devotes all his time to his books; :r~ any rate, he devotes his time to nothing else. He aims at <~rship only, and having achieved , is satisfied. If you seek his advice, he will tell you that the purpose of college is an intensh·e study of the several cours-:s prescribed in the cur- riculum; 0nl_,. that, and nothing more. Remember his words. Then th~re is the other type, who tells you that tbe fourth grade diploma is as satisfactary as the first grade one, and that the man who studies all of his time misses a lot of things which will be of more use to him in the fu- ture than a par~icular day's lesson. He'll tell vou th,lt ihere's a lot of knowledg;·: not ~ontained in books. He will douht- 1r-ss subordinate the fame of the class- room to the ~ <•me of the gridiron, ::!.nd place greater emphasis upon gaining t 1 .e admiration of th& student body than +hat of your rlass committeeman. Re·· member his words, also. Everybody loves to give advice anc1 you'll get lots of it. Some will tell you that you've- lived your whole life wrong. They will assail your views of religion, of ethics, of every conceivable principle in yottr life, and try to con- vince you that heretofore you have been in error. Ponder their 'words, bet! don't act on the spur of the moment. Whether or not you have realized it, your life to 1be present time ha~ be:::n controlled ],y certain momentous prin- ciples, which vou will do well to adhere to until you find yourself. These laws, which have rontrolled you until now have not all been wrong; remember that. They were probably laid down for you by yoer parents, and a f(!w short years of college cannot generate a mind capable of propounding a moral code of equal value with that one, which they have taught you is right. -Remember ftll you hear and see, and ember abo that nothing comes of aos.

They play a man's game, or they don't play. But, des- pite the fact that most students realize this, they don't always express it. Football is not a classical game; there's no need for classical restraint from the cheering sections. Yet the Dnly noises from these sources that seem to have made a lasting impres- siDn upon anylbody were some re- marks which true sportsme'1 feel ar:.! uncalled for. If a \raw\ decision is given, Union men forget it and con- tinue the game. Such a platform may 110t find substantiation in logic, but such is Union spirit. It is the spirit that permeats every fibre of the true Union man, athlete or spectator. It takes cognizance of the fact that all humans are prone to ·error, even ref- erees, and if that error counts against is pleaesant to find an imperfection in a great man, for we can usually find the same one in ourselves.
