Union among its 22 members, served to focus attentiOn on our campus to the growing association or inte1·ctependence, if you will, of the small independent college and the business world. The sum that Union will receive from this g-Ift is a modest figure in our ovel'all finances, but the h·end th.at it illustrates is one that can no longer be ignored. It is part of a movement that has numbered among its more important participants in recent weeks, groups such 2s tl1e Columbia Broadcasting System and Gener::Ll Electric. Realizing this interdepend- ence, these col'porations luwe taken positive action to help alleviate what all realize to b(; a prol>lem of immediate con- cern. \The Strength to Grow,\ an illustrated brochure pub- lished by the EmpiTe State Foundation for distribution to prospective contributors, keynotes this problem: in 1940-41 the income from endowment was sufficient to bridge the gap behveen ope1·ating expenses and income, but by 1952-53 it was entirely inadequate. These school::;, all 1·esidential li-beral a1ts colleges in :.:ew York SLates, are private institu- tions under the direction of independent boards of trustees. Receiving no tax support, theh· income must come from stu- dent fees, endowment yield, r..nd gifts. In the years since 19-10, while attempting to Lala.nce their budgets, they have raised tuition some 70 percent. Ove1· the same period, dor- mitory and board cll!1.rges hm'e risen 50 percent. The col- leges feel that \further increases 1.vould price the opportunity for a college education beyond the reach of too many stu- dents.\ They tum to business for their answer! Pointing out interdependence in the pamphlet, the Foundation stresses the fact that each gmduation finds. its member institutions provicling an infinite variety of hvsiness concerns with ap- proximately -1,GOO young men and women whose basic train- ing ha~ been of the l1ighe::;t caliLre. These graduates, as those who have prrceded them, m·e to be the future leaders of our hu~ine~s \\'orl<l. Such a.re the eircumstanecs tlwt have resulted in the formation of the Empire State Foundation and similar groups: the existi:'nce of \a community of interest, intent and responsibility\ Lhat enables 22 schools to ask for $1,500,- 000 a year, to be rle\·oterl primarily to teaching salaries. The cohcet·n on the part of hw;iness finds groUps such as the Bristol :\Ieyers Funrl, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, lnc., R. II. Mary and Company, Inc., National Biscuit Company, and the :-.Jew York Life Insurance Company listed as contri'butors. The forementioned note of the General Electric Company as a recent participant in aid to education is worthy of spe- cial interest to us at Union, due in part to our close connection with G.E., and to ll1e pec-uliar natme of their grant. The General Electric Erlvcation and Charitable Fund has agreed to match any gift up to $1,000 m.arle by an employee to the college from which he grarhmted. The trustees of the fund have voted $200,000 to initiate the pmgram and to cover possi'ble gifts by the company's 2~.000 college graduate em- ployees for 1955. Union, \vith so many of its graduates g·oing to work for G.E. each year, should stand to benefit considerably by this fund. It is apparent that both the ~liege and the community have made important steps in a healthy direction.· We feel that this interdepenrlence is to play an inereasingly import- ant rol€ in the future as our schools .expand to meet the needs of a growing- populace, more ahd more of whom will demand a college education. Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., Chairman of the General Motors Corporation, expressed the role of the colleges when he Baid, \Give us educated men. We can train them ourselves. But we cannot educate them.\ This is why you, the Union student, will benefit more and more from outside contributions by business in the years to come. -J.I.H. FRIDAY.

The poem which provoked the comments of Mr. Rea:r<er \VIoa.s nothing more than a satirical ver- sion of the general ribbing Vllhich \\C L.A.'s inflict upon the engineers as a \\'hole.
