A Janus Exit It is traditional for the outgoing Editor-in-Chief of the Concordiensis to suggest refoJ'DlS and changes which should be instituted on campus. In the past. long stretches of time have o·one by in which very little of a positive na- ture has been\' affected at Onion, and editors have felt it te be their duty to gently p1·od the College Community into action. This past year, however, has been an unusual one, and a very satisfactory one, in that refOJ:ms long campaigneq for in the editorial wlumns of the ConcOl'diensis have been established. We think it worth}·. the-refore, to look back- wards as \Veil as ahead in this editorial The Year in Review The biggest news story of the ucademic ;rear 1958-59 to date was unquestionably the donation of the money- for a new library building by i\lr. Henry Schaffer. lt •has long been noted that the Nott .Memorial Library is woefully in- ad€quate for the needs of Onion College. ln addition to the lack of space to house the many volumes the College owns, space is also at a premium for study purposes. The new liln·ary should solve these diffi<.!ulties. We only hope that the minor problems of the exact site for the library, and the types of rooms it will contain, will not detract from the munifence of Mr. Schaffer.

Still another proposal accepted this year was that of unlimited cuts for juniors and seniors in good academic standing. Assumed on a trial basis last year, this practice was made permanent this past autumn, and is one m.ore step towards the realization that college upperclassmen a1·e mature enough not to extend this privilege.

French Film Is F eatttred Thi·s Evening By Gerald Bock The fllm, Children ():t Paradise, v.hich will be shown tonight in EE22, is one ()f the mos·t am- lbitious, most expensive, and long- est (i.wo and <me-half hours) movies that the French have pro• duced. It tells the story of the- atri<lal life in Paris 'i.JJ. 1848 and is crowded with pecrple, city noises, .brawling, an:d lovemaking. American mov:iegQer:;;, unaccus- tomed to such concentrated mix- tures of -sex oynicism, and sym- botism should enjoy 'the picture's sharp, witty individual scenes. The overall theme seems to lbe that life is a tragic oCOmedy. whether viewed from the top of the heap or from the !OWI!st seg- ment of humanity. The story is eJroellenttly por- trayed by several of 'Fran~e's ou~ standing actors and adresses, and provides an evening of worth- while entertainment.

Deuteron- omy warns man that sin wiU be J•um,;hed and \a grea~ dark~es~ shall enter man's hfe 'if he Slns. An ancient s.:holar of Jerusalem some 2200 years ago questioned th1s warning, wondering how th<- darknesll of sin could possibly af- fect a blmd man, to whom the hght of aoonday is indistinguish- able from th£ darkest m'idnight. But this sage WIUl reassured of his faith in God when he encoun- ttr·ed a blind man carrying a tor~h on a dark night over a l'ough road. Questioning the bhnd man abo,ut his reasons for .canying the torch, the ancient \'as answered, \It is true: the torch gives me no .right. But can ying this torch enables others to see my condition and to help me a.void the pitfalls which I might othcr\o\i:de' encounter.\ Stresses Faith Applying this simile to our age of !\;ctcntific and technological l<.dvancemcnl, Rab'bi Rubinget· charged hi.> audience to acknowl- edge rcaltty and to accept faith as a staff m the quest .for ultim\ ate truth. ··u we are blind to reality, how ron we find solace in faith?\ the speaker asked. \Faith gives us a sense of 'indi- \iduality; it helps u;; to pierce the unknown. Blir.d as we of this gertE'tation are, we ·can achieve some enlightenment through faith, even thoug'h we 'can never com- prehend ultimate truth in its en- til·ety_\ Having received degrees from St. Jo·hn's University and John Carol Un'iversity, Rabbi Rubinger ·was ordained at the Yavneh He- :Jlrew ':l,'heological Seminary. He presently serves as Executive Vi-ce-President of the Rabbinical Conference of Ameri-ca. and as .Secretary of the Capital District Board of Rabbis, in addition to his affiliations with Temple Ohav. Sholom and Albany State College for Teachers. ~IBIIIIIBIIIIIBIBiiiBIBIBII':i • • = FOR CAR TitOUBLES : : SEE A UNION MAN : • • • • • • !William H.
