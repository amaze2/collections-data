This may have been due to the perfect weather or the excellent food but it was also caused by the exciting natm·e of the disct~ssion and the good humor displayed. Eighty-three faculty members participated, and the arguments carried on for many hours after the regular sessions had ad- journed. The largest amount of our time was spent in discus- sing problems of student activities and morale-the status of the fraternities and ways in which Acting Dean of Stu- dents Thomas Cartmill can help them to put their financial books in order; student moxale in a wide variety of areas and how the faculty and administration can help raise it to a higher level ; honors courses, independent study, and other techniques by which tJ:le superior student can be encouraged to STRETCH himself - the Inter-Depart- mental courses and the \Extendibles\ program received sympathetic treatment. One device which I suggest to strengthen student morale is a monthly dinner meeting of representative stu- dents with representative members of the faculty and ad- ministration, for the airing of problems of mutual concern. The College will be happy to be the host for these meet- ings, and we stand ready to schedule the first one as soon as the Student Council and House Presidents Council are prepared. ,----· -· ---··----1 I FRESHMEN: Avoid the necessity of writing letten h~>me!
