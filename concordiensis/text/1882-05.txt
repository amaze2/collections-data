Much is life's current like to thine That from some secret spring in yon deep moun- tain wood, \''here yellow 1nossen flowers shine, Begins and flows and widens to a mighty flood. And yet few streams of life are free, Transparent, glad as thine, that maketh fresh and bright Thy banks unto the great deep sea, Where waters heave a restless roaring day and night. Our little streams begin to flow From passion's sprmgs,-from 5elf, from pride, from love, from hate, Which muddy all life's after flow, And make our actions lose the name of being great. When swollen into sullen ruar, 'Tis not the rageful issue of thine- own sweet will; And thou art busy ever-more To purify and love thy limpid channel still. But man and his ambition leap From selfish motives, courting no congenial sun; And oft where virtues should flow deep, We find their waters shallow and have ceased to run. What golden heritage is mine, If having cramped the soul into some narrow bound, I rise not on a sea divine, But sink thro' vulgar weeds into unwholesome ground! TAYLOR LEWIS, LL.D.

.. THE CONCORDIENSIS. 1 49 , The Seniors regret having to resort to such a measure, but they feel in- duced to do so fron1 many considera- tions, and their course has been ap- proved by almost every one. A great objection to the sending of flowers is that this has now become so general a practice, that the good people down-town seem to feel th etn- selves obligated to make up at least a boquet for any one who might see fit to write them an invitation. The students on this account feel a deli- cacy in sending invitations to n1any in town, \vho they wish to invite, but from 'vhon1 they would ordinarily · expect no flowers. In this way too a painful distinction is n1ade between the student who has gone n1uch in society during his course and another who has made but fe-vv acquaintances down town. T'he former is loaded with flowers, while the latter, far more deserving perhaps of honor, leaves the stage \Vith a few slim boq uets. Another objection is the confusion caused during the exercises. The very persons whom the speaker most wishes to appreciate his effort, are busied passing about their own flow- ers and commenting on those of others. We fot1nd it almost in1possi- ble at the last co~1nencement to pay any attention to orators. And after all the trouble the orator's friends have taken in n1aking up the beautiful baskets and boquets he can get very little enjoyment from them. After the first thrill of triumph as he sees the ;marshals com- ing up the aisles loaded with the bright offerings, these later become a trouble rather than a pleasure. And the next day as he is about to leave for home, he looks upon them piled a heap in the corner of his room, and thinks it all but a foolish wast of nature's sweets. We are very much pleased at the atte~mpt of Professor Perkins to make some.provisiL n for the proper treat- . ment of our sick, and only wish he had it in his power to fix things up more elaborately. He has fitted up three rooms in North College co]on- ade as a hospital; one of them con- taining two beds, a bath tub, earth closet, and other conveniences for the accommodation of the sick man and, if necessary his chum ; and ano~her for the nurse, having arrangements for cooking, etc. We have always needed something of this kind, for the ordinary college room is no place for a sick man. l\he noise in the halls as the boys clatter up and down the stairs, the starnping over head, and the shouting and singing (?)all through the section is son1etimes enough to drive any one crazy. And then even if he has a chum, the latter has little time and

As Harvard Advocate has struck the for nourishrnent, it is hard enough nail on the head when it says that for a strong healthy man to live on a the Carmina Concordiae is out of date. college boarding-house fare. We need some fresh tunes to infuse life and vigor into our singing. One truth was made painfully Every one loves the songs that evident at the reception which ·Presi- dent Potter gave the Seniors a few evenings ago ; and that is that the class cannot now sing old Union's songs any better than they did first term Freshman, and probably not nearly as well. And it is true not only of this class but of the students generally that their knowledge of and fondness for the college songs is decreasing at an alarming rate. We fear the time may soon come when no one can be found able to start up the dear old\Terrace Song.\ How often do we now hear swelling on the air of night, or rising in grand chorus from the terrace the notes of ''Here's to Good Old Union,\\ 'Twas Friclay morning,\ \Commencement Ode,\ \Co-ca-cha-lunk Dog,\ etc ? It see1ns as if stern Minerva has sent the heavenly muse of song into everlasting banishment. Is there no longer any musical talent in col- lege ? There must be more good singers now than there were formerly among a much sm::tller number of students. The trouble is that there is nothing now to call out our talent. The chartned our ear when \as Fresh- tnen first vve came to college\; but as the Duke in \Patience\ savs ... although candy is very nice, yet candy for breakfast, candy for dinner, candy for supper, and nothing ~ut candy, is too much of the good thing. Do not let us discard the dear old songs that have become a part of the very life and soul of our Alma Mater, but let us have some new ones with them, for \ variety is the spice of life.\· And why could not Union take the lead in this, issuing a second edition of the Carmina Concordiae? If a few of our musical artists, say one from each class, could organize themselves into a com1nittee fur the purpose, and devote a year perhaps to this object, it would be a most excellent thing for the college at home and abroad. The terrace would no longer be deserted,and once more merry voices would float: in song and shout across the can1pus. \Ye Union boys whose pipes are lit, Come forth in merry throng, Upon the terrace let us sit And cheer our souls with song.\ cc . 111 at oi at C< L .A h t< e t: v c c ..._ h . 1~ c f ' (

There have been class regattas at Harvard, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania. Several colleges are endeavoring to arrange an Inter,.. co~legiate Regatta to be held on Lake George, some titne this season. As yet Wesleyan and Bo\v<foin only have agreed to send crews, but hope to induce others. especially the west- club may yet be organized and much practice be had before college closes. Won't snme of our sporting men look to this matter? 1'he class of '82 seems determined to take the lead in making innova- tions in connection with the com- mencement exercises; and so far t bes.e changes have all been good ones. The festive rites they purpose ern and New York Colleges to join celebrating in the grove will be very them.

Why should we be behind them? It is true our course of study is very severe, per- haps more severe than that of any A1nerican college, but we must train our bodies as well as our minds. Our intelligent Facl.llty are fully alive to this fact, and vvill never put the slightest unreasonable obstacle in our way. Though it is. too late to do any thing in this season's races, a bering a mass of words which no one but the Latin or German professor, as the case n1ay be, can comprehend. vVe would favor one more step in the n1atter, and that is that the salutato- ry address be included in the con1pe-. 1 tition for the Blatchford medals. A chance at one of the medals is gener- ally more acceptable than the honor of delivering the salutatory, and there is no reason \vhy the latter should preclude the former.

We have heard several of our most esteemed Pro- fessors express hearty disapproval of chapel exercises, and certainly the farcical turn that the exercises occa- Union, as its nan1e indicates, is the college for all denorninations, and therefore it seerns to me hi·ghly im- proper for it to have special, obliga- tory religious exercises. If the col- lege professed any religious prefer- ences ~r n1ade any pretensions to particular fonns of worship, I should have nothing to say ; but, professing nothing but \Christian Unity,\ it conzpels an assemblage of protestants, catholics, infidels and jews to attend chapel daily, (Sundays excepted, )and pray after the manner of whomsoever presides over the exercises,-son1e tin1es a layn1an, some ti1nes a clergy- Inan,now a methodist or presbyterian with his exten1pore prayer, and the next day, perhaps, an episcopalian blending sentences fro1n the Book of Common Prayer with the flights of his own fervid eloquence. .1\nd tell rne, pray, what the average student is doing in the t.neantime?

Ask the Professors who, fro1n lofty seats, take note of the absent ones, and. presently appal the poor delinquents \Vith yellow enveloped documents purporting that Mr. 's attention is called sionall y assur:n e is enough to make any one disapprove of them. What is to be done? I desire to see chapel service abolished, but if that cannot be done the oblz'gatio1t- to attend ought at least to be removed. Other colleges, Harvard, A1nherst and Cor- nell for exam pies, thrive without chapel exercises. Why cannot Union do the same ? There is not one good reason against it. To those who favor these forced prayers I would recall the shocking persecutions that stain the annals of all our christian sects when religion was forced on men by the rack and the burning stake. This age is too enlightened for coercion in religion, for in plain Saxon what else is obligatory chapel worship? and enlightenn1ent on this point should certainly extend to our

I make not the slightest objection to prayer .meetings and religious or- ganizations arnong the students, which they are invited, not forced, to attend. Indeed, I dare say much good may be done by such organization provided they be purely optional, but the moment the element of force enters into religious matters they assume very different aspects, especiallv to _, persons whose religious opinions are such that they cannot enter into the feelings and utterances of the preacher. Some may argue thatour chapel exercises are mere matter of form, and one need only to be pres- ent, without actually participating. This n1ay be true, but religion is too sacred to be made a 1onnality of; and yet by the rules of this'' christian unity\ college many young 1nen are forced either to do violence to their convictions or to assist with cold formality at daily religious services. In this day of reforms let not this much needed one be neglected!

After the banquet Peoli, Drowne and others entertained the campany for a short time with instrumental and vocal music, and at 1 I :30 the boys took their departure, highly pleased \Vi th both the entertainment and recep- tion.

One marked in1proven1ent is that it contains statistics and re- ports \vhich are, because of their cor- rectness, valuable to every friend of the col!ege, and the catalogues of names are of association that do in reality exist, and not alone in the minds of the editors. It contains life-like pictures of President Potter and Professors Staley, Whitehorne and Wells, a picture of the editors in a group, ~fine view of the colleges and grounds, the blue gate, the new Metnorial building, besides many small views and pictures among which is the picture of \Aumie.\ It con- tains also a few college and class songs, a tribute to Dr. Lewis by Emerson ~83,and n1any other features valuable to the Union graduate. The editorials are well written by the Historians of the classes. On the whole the Garnet for this year is a book that should be owned and read I by every alurnnus and student who has any interest in the college. It is as large as two ofany forn1er years. It reflects great credit upon its editors, and especially upon the ch icf editor, Mr. Burton, who has been faithful in his attempt to make the publication a success, and also to leave out everything that \vould cause any but the rnost pleasant feel- ings to all, in both of which he has succeeded admirably. Credit is also due to Mr. Chas. Burrows of this city, the printer thereof, for the neat typographical appearance of the book. The evidences of his skill and taste are manifest, and materially assist in making a handson1e number. -1'he commencement invitation cards will be out May 25th. -According to the new catalogue the following is the representation of the students bv states : .I New York, 145; South Carolina, 16; Louisiana, 5 ; Massachusetts, 4; Mary land, 3 ; New Jersey, 2 ; Dis- trict of Columbia, 2; Kentucky, 2 ; North Carolina, 3; Indian Territory, I; Iowa, 1; Delaware.

The fail- ure of his voice in 1835, compelled him for a tin1e to leave the pulpit. After devoting fifteen years to teach- ing in Marion College, Missouri, and in the Raritan f\'ernale Seminary, at Perth An1boy, N. J ., he renewed his labors in the pulpit.

Editorials, so called, are of the same nature and we fail to see the advan- tage i_ f the division. 'fhe Berkeleyon, the Occident, and Arclzvngel continue to bring us ne-vvs from the far distant Pacific. All these are very welcome, despite the many 1nean aspersions cast on the little Art,·hangel, and the severe bouts between the Berkeleyan and some of its eastern exchanges. ]'hese papers have the merit of being unique. They are very unlike us .of the East, not much like their \Vestern broth- ' ers, and entirely unlike one another. The SuJ.zbca71Z, ofWhitby, Ontario, comes, as its name indicates, from the ladies. It is neatly gotten up, but lacks the flash and \vit that we naturally expect from its title and sex. The Exchange column is far superior to the others, and handles capitally several papers that have criticised too severely their sister of Whit by. A little more spiciness in \ Locals\ and less soberness in \ Editorials\ would be very improving. • Since our entrance into the field of college journalism it has been an unsolvable enigma \vhy one of the finest co11eges in the country has not a better paper than T/ze liniversity Magazine, of the U nivcrsity of Penn- sylvania. We thought for a long time it was one an1ong several rivals, superior, perhaps, to itself; but neither in it nor in any of our ex- changes have we seen notice of other University papers. Forced thus to conclude that it alone represents over a thousand students in a time-honor- ed college, vve naturally expect much from it; hut disappointn1ent is our share from each of its bi-monthly is- sues. We do not object to any par- ticular feature or department, but the paper as a whole is decidedly media- ere. It is far inferior to papers of much sn1aller colleges, the Argo of \Villian1s, the A1nlzerst .... ~'tudcJZt, the l_)rz',;cetollia1l, for samples. These journals are not without defects, but their better parts are plainly percept- ible.

On Tuesday afternoon, April 18th, the first college game of the season was played between a nine picked fron1 the Senior and Sophon1ore classes and another selected from the Juniors and Freshmen. The result is shown below : at one tirne to allow a snow storm its innings. The Union nine was under great disadvantage, both N aylon and f\nable being unable to play. The Inclemency of the weather rendered the playing exceedingly poor. The game, \vhich was called at the end of the seventh inning, was I 2 to 10 in favor of the Albanians. SENIORS AND SOPIIS. The first time Union's men ap- peared in their Iegular positions was in the game with the Strains of Albany. rfhe Albany nine were confident c.f , success, probably j.udging from the game played with the Alphas.

The long expected game between the Sophon1ores and Freshmen, for ·the Yates championship cup, came off Saturday afternoon (April 22). The weather was very cold and every one suffered accordingly. i\nable's pitching was quite wild, probably on account of the cold. The gan1e was very interesting, and most of the persons were satisfied with the result (Sophomores excluded). Delaney's pitching was severely punished. T'he playing of Jervis on first base was so good that we think it deserves special n1en tion. The catching of McCauley was very fine; he made one very fine foul catch with one hand.
