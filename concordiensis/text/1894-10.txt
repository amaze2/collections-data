'I THE G~NG®RDIENSlS. VoL. XVIII. UNION COLL3DGE, OCTOBER 10, 1894. No. 2. alike; it is the one divine attitude of hurnanity. . And only because man is divine in this respect, · ean he come to knowledge of the all-divine. Man ki!lows that an Infinite, Eternal, Self-sustaining B.eing exists; knows it absolutely, without aid of evidence, by n1eans of immediate, rational intui- We have been. accustomed to be told in the past that the primal good in the religious world is faith; again we have been taught that the supren1e end of the human world is love; and now we would clain1 that the greatest thing in all tl1e world! is that whi(jh once was lost in the utazes of a clark philosophy, but now has sprung into the full light of I'ecognition, bearing the proud nan1e of , tion ; and aU because there is this :reason in the world. W eU that the reign of reason bides through eternity. 'To this king there can be no successor. :But reason relates to the hu1nan as well as to the divine. It is a palpitating, quivering, sensi- tive, living thing, and as such it has its human part to play, adding link to link in the flawless chain of demonstration, the Inighty doctrine of Evo~ution moves on its inevitable way. Already it has stretched its ring of steel in unalterable suc- cession fro1n the fo:nnless pulp of the lowest germ that lives to the lofty structure of humanity, and now would lay its pitiless grasp upon the very per- sonalty of mankind. But no! At this highest point in the evolution of the world, the greatest thing in the world leaps in, severs the chain which would fetter 1nan to brute, and binds man to God Reason. Faith, that great stronghold of the popular re- ligion.. which has stood through the centu):ies a to,ver of refuge., a bulwark of defense for the grand- est hopes and aspirations of n1ankind, is at best but a confidence founded upon the authority of another. l!.,aith does not :give knowledge, it gives belief; and in exaet n1easnre as knowledge stands .above belief so reason towers over faith. It is the one organ of tbe hu1:nan soul, which, by n1eans of an inner subjective necessity, knows with such utter certainty, that the belief which -would con- ti·avene its dictates becomes n1onstrous in the vain atten1pt. .And love, i;bat source of aU the grand sweetness in the universe, that energy of life, which, by the nutgic of its matchless magnetism, has charged this world of man with altruistic sympathy-what is love? In the terms of an .exact distinction it is free- will in obedience to reason; and only as such ·can it be called the goal Qf the world-process. To say that God is love is but to say that His will is in harn1ony with Hi~ reason. And the love that has stolen forth into the world and done its beau- tiful work has but fulfilled the mandates which reason imposes upon man's will. Thus reason is the basis of love; for without this. foundation upon which to build, love would beco1ne the mere nat- ural affection of the brute for its offspring, the mere instinctive eonceruof the parent for his child. As it is, love is a n1oral thing, living its life in the spiritual sphere, owning no superior either in the here or in the hereafter, saving the reason, which is at once its foundation and its law. May we not now lower love and faith from the proud position of supremacy which they have usurped so long? It is for the greatest thing in the world; and not for the greatest thing in the world alone, but for the greatest thing in the universe as well. For reasQn is the property of God and man instead . And where can that be found which is of higher · authority for the glorious work of hurnan emanci- , pation than reason? It gives to the world the , 1na.thematical axiorns upon which every science · rests; it gives to the world the fundan1ental truths of logic upon which all reasoning is based; and therefore it is the foundation of the scientific reas- oning which forged the evolutionary chain. What reason has given, reason alone can take away, unless there be a greater yet than reason in the world. :But that there cannot be, for the partial glilnpse of reason with which centuries of striving have at last endowed mankind, has given to man a dhn conception of what its wondrous Inagnitude must be; a conception that reveals ·this supreme th.ing of the world absolute in its suprmnacy from its beginning in mankind until in God it finds its final consun1mation-fi.nds its sovereignty to be for tin1e and for eternity.

4 THE OONOORDIE;.NSIS. REV. DENIS WORTMAN D. D. The Rev. Denis Wortm.an, D·. D., who was elected Life Trustee of Union College in 1882, was born at Hopewell, Dntche~s Co., N. Y., April 3(:), 1835. His father, Dr .. Denis W ortn1an, was for 46 years one of the leadiing physicians of his county ; and his mother, El:i.zabeth Brinkerhoff Rapalge, was a won1an of rn.anr talents.

He -was i.mmediately licensed by the Olassis of Poughkeepsie, N. Y., and was ordained by the U. Classis of Long Island, and installed pastor of the So. Bu.shwick Refornted church of :Brooklyn,, January 17, 1860. In :No- venlber, 1873, he becan1e pastor of the Third Reformed Dutch ch11rch of Philadelphia, as suc- cessor to Georgf\ W. Bethune, D.

Ray1nond, President of Union College, at the Presbyterian Memorial church of Brooklyn, yesterday morning, I had occasion to ask him where a telegram would reach him to-nlorJ'OW. He said at the University Club of New York. Dr. Raymond is not only one of the youngest and ablest of our college presidents, but an ea1·nest and eloquent Presbyterian divine. I wondered to nly- sel.f what would have been said if a Presbyterian minister of fifty years ago had given a club as his

There is a strong resen1blance between President , Rayn1ond of Union University and Senator Gor- ' man of Maryland. This has already led to a little perplexity. While in New York city a short tiine since a gentleman shook President Raymond by the hand in front of the Hoffn1an House, and cong-ratulated him on his excellent work and his. healthy look. The speaker's language was so genial that Dr. Rayrnonq thought that his reference was to his assurnption of the duties of· president of the , college. But the speaker had reference to Senator Gonnan's work in the Senate. Finally the two n1en caine to an understanding, laughed, shook hands again, and went there respective ways.- .A.lbany JottTnal. ELI PERKINS INTERVIEWED. The September number of the Unive1·sity Maga- · zine contains an interesting interview with '.' Eli Perkins,\ Melville D. Landon, '61, and a loyal1nern- · ber of Beta 'Theta Pi. When the hu1norist was asked how n1any books he had published, he said: \ None; but I've written seven. It takes three men to write, print and publish a book. A lady, Susan B. Anthony, came to George W. Carleton and asked hirn if he would print a book for her. 'No,' said Carleton; 'but I'll publish it.' 'What is the difference between printing and publishing?' asked Susan. ' There's a wide difference, n1y dear madam,' said Carleton. 'Now, if I should print a kiss on a young lady's lips, that would be printing. But if I should go and tell anybody that I did it, that would be publishing.' ' Yes, and the n1eanest kind of publishing, too,' said Susan, blushing for the first tin1e in her life.\ CSI]e Bu tt~rfi~ld [e<:ture ~ours~.

R. c. A. worth $600,000, a splendid endowment which has practically supported the col- · lege for forty years and the value of which to-day is estitnated at three times that a1nount. This the enemies of Dr. Nott called ''restitution,\ but his friends and the friends of the college have always called it a splendid donation. Said the Ne·w York Tin~es of January 12, 1854, in an exhaustive editorial by Henry J. Ray- nlond, ''So far as the interests of Union College are concerned, it makes no dif- ference what verdict may be pronounced by the Legislature upon the charges made against the venerable President;· whether it be the discharge of the debt or a dona- tion, the college has the money. The only motive his persecutors can have in insisting that this is the discharge of a debt and not a donation, is to blacken his character, torture the last years of his long, useful and honorable life, and throw a cloud of suspicion upon his integrity in after ages. His own conscious purity of purpose will foil the most 1nalignant part of their object; and the noble friendship of John 0. Spencer has defeated the rest.\ Such was Union's lottery, such its last- ing benefits and such the mental anguish which its various ramifications caused the aged President who devoted sixty-two years of his noble life to Union College. The integrity of his purpose and the sincerity of his devotion to the college is evidenced by the fact that for more than ten years after this attack he retained his hon.ored office, constantly increasing the value of the endowment he had given, and carry- ing with him to the grave the confidence and affection, 11ot only of the Trustees and Faculty, but of the whole body of alumni and students. Such a guerdon of personql loyalty as was his, and such a degree of devotion on the part . of the thousands of his pupils, has probably not a parallel in college history. And even to-day, nearly thirty years after his death, in any gathering of the sons of Union, T~e Dramatic ~lub. Tuesday, the 9th of October, saw the · birth of a new organization in college, known as the '' Urn ion College Drarnatic Club,\ and '~omposed of ten charter mem- bers. This .is another step in the right direction, and indicates that Union is a wakening from her long lethargy in fields other thanathletics. THE OoNCORDIENSIS, in its arti·c1e last year on the minstrels, expressed -the hope that in the future something more artistic might be under- taken, and at last a response comes in the institution of the '' Union College Dra- 1natic Club.'' The object of the club is to present at different times during the college year\ bUCh dramatic work in the way of light and breezy farces. as 1nay be adapted to the talents and capabilities of the membei's. The Hasty Pudding Club of Harvard, the Masque at Cornell, and the Columbia Club are as well known as the colleges they represent; and many of the smaller colleges, in which category, of course, Union finds its place, support dramatic organizations in every way creditable to the1nselves. What talent we have at present in college is a question the future only can determine; but the projectors of the club mean to spare no pains to render its productions bright and original. ~be club 1neets every Tuesday evening for the purpose of rehearsals and the transaction· of business.

It does not consist of one college or group of departments, but ernbraces all colleges, acadernies, high schools, state libraries, and muse- urns.

The University is a hranch..of the government and is created and 1naintained by the Legislature This educational system is not the work of any single individual. For sou1e tirne jt was thou.ght that to Alexander Ha1nilton was due the credit of its forruation.

The Board of Regents consists of nineteen nlem- bers, elected by the Legislature. These officers · are of every p~litical belief and serve without pay. Thus is seGured a class of n1en above par~ty preju- dice, and the hope of en1olurn.ent. In addition to _ these the Governor, Lieut..

In speaking of the practical value of the lecture in an educational point of view, he alluded to the new advanced and the practical system-introduced at Union by Dr. Rayrr1ond in the college course of instrnction in electrical science, being coupled with visits and lectures upon the machinery and construction at the great Edison plant in Schenec- tady. He expressed his belief that in time Union College would stand at the head of the world's universities in thorough instruction in electrical science. When the conteinplated step was taken of corubining practical exan1ple and application in mechanical science and principles with visits and study at the great locomotive works in S<;henec- tady, the college in tlJis. the lOOth year of its exis- tence, would lay the foundations for still greater and n1ore successful work in producing ''all- round\ men, in thPk education fitted for success Jn any path in life.

For- · tunately the need of :a higher class of dra- matic work at Union has been seen by our local ~alent; and }rom the list of offi- · cers announced by the new club we go ' so far as to p~rophesy the success of the , movement. PERSONNEL OF THE DRAMATIC CLUB. No piece of news whi,ch has con1e to nty ears, . since the last issue of THE CONCORDIENSIS, has given n1:e ntore genuine delight than the fact that Union is to have a dra1natic club. And I was particularly de1ig1ited, when, upon looking over the list of officers, I recognized the nan1es of several old friends, 'vhose dran1atic ability is unquestioned. MR. PEMBER'l'ON, THE PRESIDENT OF THE CLUB, has the two-fold advantage of looking like an LEr:t, the battle C!Lf be ''On to Ridge- •. actor, and feeling like one.

Upon these one hundred men rests a moral obligation; and if they have not college spirit enough to meet that obligation, then let then~ take the responsibility if the team suffers defeat. With the p±~oper kind 9f encour- agen1ent Union can win. Lack of en- couragement has been the trouble all along; and if the eleven can feel on Satur- rlay that every Union man is with them, heart and soul, and that every inch of ground covered by -them with the ball is appreciated, and applauded to the echo, it will n~ake a difference in their playing' that will astonish even themselves. Union, be on your m€ttle. Let there be but one cry, Victoryt MR. ROBINSON OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, is an invaluable n1an, inasrnuch as he is capable of playing a part rarely a tteinpted with success by n1en. That is, tbe role of the sweet and winsorne daughter of the pig and pork millionaire of Chi- cago, who is the object of the persistent atten- tions of the foreign bankrupt noblmnan; and who brings down the gallery gods when she cries in ac- cents wild: \I an1 a woman! and will obey the dictates of n1y own conscience sooner than the 1nandates of an unjust paternal ancestor:'' thus · flinging defiance into the teeth of her rnueh be- whiskered pater. Mr. Robinson rnakes up as an . ideal wornan. His fairness of forrn_. and syn1metry of figure showing off to best effect when petticoats have been assun1ed in place of trousers. That he will satisfy the taste of the rnost critical eye, and win the plaudits of all admirers of the fair sex, is a certainty. MR. BEATTIE, WHO WILL MANAGE THE CLUB, is a man of many talents.
