The football season on the ca!mpus was closed last Tuesday afternoon in a game with the University of Vermont in which Union was victorious by the score of 22 to o. The Ver- mont eleven came down confident of victory and put up a stronger gatne than any team has put up against Union on the campus this year, but the effective coaching of '' Bill\ Smith showed itself and Union easily defeated her rival. Ver-· • mont played the guards and tackles back forma- tions and made n1ost of her gains through the line. In the first half Union made most of her gains through Vermont's line, but in the second half the Union players skirted the Vermont ends for large gains. The University of Vermont had a shade the better in the first half, although Union scored twelve points to Vermont's five. The ball was in Union's territory throughout the greater part of the half. In the second half Union played a far superior game than the Vennonters and had the ball in the visitors' territory almost throughout the entire half. The first touchdown was made in the fit·st twenty seconds of play. Burbank kicked off to Union's fifteen-yard line to Cronkhite who sup- ported by good interference t·a n down the field for a touchdown. The second touchdown was made in the n1iddle of the first half. Burbank tried for a goal from field on lT nion's fifteen- yard line, Cronkhite caught the ball on the ten yard line and supported by gcod interference ran down the field for a touchdown. Union made her third touchdown in the first part of the second half. Thebo was given the ball on Vermont's ten-yard line and ran around the left end for a touchdown. The last touchdown was tnade at the very last of the second half. Paige was given tha ball on Vennont's one-yard line and by a line buck brought the ball over the goal line. Vern1ont made her only touchdown in the last part of the first half. Ven11ont had the ball on Union's eight-yard line, Strait was given the ball on a double pass and ran around left end for a touchdown. Every man on the Union eleven played an excellent game. V ennont had great difficulty in making her gains through the line and made very few gains around the ends. Cronkhite was the star of the day on account of his long runs and excellent handling of the ball. Paige tnade good gains by line bucks and Mallery and Gnl- nac through the line and around the ends. Finegan and Collier advanced the ball for large gains. Shaw and Bryan played a strong gam~ and made some excellent tackles. Bryan, al- though he had hita knee sprained in the early part of the gatne, pluckily played throughout the entire game. This was Olmsted'~ first ap- pearance in the gatne this year. He played a .good game, especially when the fact ot his hav- ing only one afternoon's practice this season is taken into account. His tackles were sure and he 1nade good gains. Orton, Gerish and Strait played a strong game and did the most ground gaining for Vermont. Robinson played a good game at quarterback. FIRST HALF. Union won the toss-up and chose to defend the north goal. Vermont kicked off to Cronk- hite on Union's fifteen-yard line. Cronkhite supported by good interference ran down the field and deposited the ball behind the goals. Paige kicked a clean goal. Vermont kicked off to Cronkhite on Union's fifteen-y~rd line and Cronkhite ran the ball back twenty-five yards before downed. After two downs Paige tried to punt but the punt was blocked by Orton who fell on the ball. Ver- mont advanced the ball to Union's ten-yard line where the Garnet obtained the ball on downs. Paige punted to Union's forty-five-yard line and

At a recent tneeting of the students of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology it was decided, by the small majority of two, to dis- band the football tean1. There is consid€rable di&satisfaction over the tnatter and over the way in which it was decided, but in all probability the action will be final. The move was taken on the recomtnendation of Professor Pritchett. ,·,, ' ..

,I, ,. . ' THE CONC·ORDIENSIS. 7 THE FQESHI\'lAN BANQUET. The freshrn.an class celebrated their banquet on Monday night, November 4, at the New Kentnore in Albany in a n1ost successful and enjoyable tnanner. The menu was quite elaborate and was all that one could wish. · The freshman had been unusually quiet about the afl'air and ha.d succeeded in keeping it from the sophon1ores until a day before it took place. The sophotnores either through lack of energy or class spirit failed to accomplish any- thing whatever in the way of breaking up the banquet. A half dozen were seen about the hotel in the early part of the evening but even they disappeared. The occasion was unique in that it was the first fresh tnan banquet held outside of Schenec- tady in a good many years and also the early date at which it was held, it having been custon1ary for some years past to hold the ban- quet during the winter term. The members of the freshman class supported the undertaking well, there being son1e forty freshmen present with about twenty guests. All of the class -officers were present, the committee and toast- master. T'he co1nmittee having the affair in charge was composed of Karl F. West, presi- dent of the class, George B. Alexander, Alexander J. Thomson, Jr., Thomas M. Holmes and Morland King. The toastmaster was Eric T. King and the following toasts were responded to : '~When the Century was New,\ Karl F. vVest, I 905. \The Reign of Law,\ Prof. John Ira Bennett.

JUNIORS AND SOPHOMORES TIE. The juniors and sophomores played a tie game last Thursday afternoon. It was after five o'clock when the game was finally begun. Darkness was so rapidly coming on that the game had to be called in the tniddle of the second half. The gatne was a good exhibition of pluck and skill. 'I'he sophotnores put up a strong offensive game throughout and if the gatne had not been called would certainly have scored. The juniors played a good ofl€msive game making repeated gains through the sopho- n1ores line. In the second half their playing was not up to their work in the first half. Hoxie kicked off to the sophomores' thirty- five· yard line. The sophomores advanced the ball to the centre of the field where they were forced to punt. The juniors obtained the ball on the punt on their thirty-yard line. The juniors advanced the ball to the sophomores' forty-five-yard line where they lost the ball on a fumble. On the next two line-ups the sopho- mores were thrown back for a loss of fifteen yards. The sophotnores punted to the centre of the field. Then the juniors advanced the ball to the sophomores' twenty-yard line when time was called. Langlois kicked oH' to the juniors' twenty- yard line. The juniors advanced the ball to the centre of the gridiron where they lost it on a fun1ble. 'I'he sophotnores obtained the ball on downs and were rushing it down the field hav- ing advanced it to the juniors' twenty-five-yard line when the game was called on account of the darkness.

8 THE CONOORDIENSIS. ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. Devil's Own Fraternity.

A most delightful evening was spent, quite in keeping with the tnonthly gatherings of last year. The fraternity suppliei a long felt want in the school, bringing together month by month representatives of the various sections and departments of its activity. AT T'HE MEDICAL.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 AN AMUSING SITUATION. The following is taken from the Harvard Crimson: Concerning eligibility rules, a rather amusing situation has presented itself lately: A postal card notice, presumably intended for a member of the baseball squad, w.as wrongly addressed to Dr. Lytnan Abbott, who is editor of the Outlook and Preacher to the University during the current year. The postal card bore the follow- . tng: '' B. Wendell is anxious to have you come out for fall baseball practice.\ Dr. Abbott sent the following reply to Presi- dent Eliot: \My dear Dr. Eliot: \ I am very much gratified to find from the enclosed postal card that I have been selected for the fall baseball ' squad.' Do you suppose that my work as University Preacher will inter- fere with this latest appointn1ent? \Moreover. I am not quite sure that my record and standing as an undergraduate tuakes me eligible for the nine. Do you suppose that Captain \tVendell has looked this tnatter up thoroughly before selecting tne? I should be extremely sorry to have any suggestion of pro- fessionalist1l attach itself to the nine for the cotning season through my selection, and I should like to have the manager and captain understand that I am quite ready to withdraw frotn the ' squad ' if it is for the best interest of I-Iarvard athletics that I should do so. ~ ~ I should have preferred to be in football ! ~'Yours sincerelv, \\ \ Lyman Abbott.\ SENIO~S, 5; SOPHOMORES, 0. In an interesting game on the gridiron, Tues- day, October 29, the seniors defeated the sophomores by a score of 5 to o. The sopho- nlores lacked team work, but at critical moments gamely held their heavier opponents ; twice the seniors held the ball on the sophomores' five·yard line, but were unable to bring the ball over for a touchdown. The seniors played a strong offensive and defensive game.. At the end of the first half the score stood o to o.. In the early part of the second half, Mahar punted fro.m the sophotTlores' five-yard line to their twenty-five yard line. Grout picked up the ball and made a pretty run through the sopho- more team for a touchdown. Sherrill kicked .ofl to Anderson on the seniors' twenty-five-yard line. The seniors advanced the ball to the sophotnores' forty-five-yard line where they were forced to punt. Glutzbeck got the ball on the sophotnores' thirty-yard line and was downed immediately. The seniors ob- tained the ball on downs and after tnaking five yards lost the ball to the sophomores on downs. The sophomores made a gain of five yards when they were held for downs. The sophon1ores imtnediately got the ball back by holding the seniors for downs. The sophotnores punted to· their forty-five-yard line.

CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, TERMS: $2.00 per Year, in Advance 10 Cents Address all communications to THE CoNCORDI- ENSIS, Sillitnau Hall, Schenectady, N. Y. Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 4:14: State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. OWING to the cessation of alt work on Electiot1 Day, both by the editors and the printers, the paper comes out a day late this week. THE Vermont game on Election Day was highly satisfactory to Union students. The practice that the team has been getting and the excellent train- ing of coach ''Bill'' Smith never showed itself more plainly than 1t did in the game on Tuesday. Every man on the Union team played football. And it is not to be understood from this that Ver- mont did not play a good game, for she did. Ver- mont played a good game, but Union played a better. SINCE the game with Colgate two weeks ago several articles which very evidently received their inspiration from Colgate undergraduates have ap- peared asserting that Union's players were guilty of rough playing. The Ma<lisonens.is in its account of the game says that it was one of the most un- satisfactory in the football career, that the treat- ment Colgate received was unsportsmanlike, that Union resorted to the roughest kind of tactics. lt further says that at that period of the game when Union made three touchdowns in rapid succession the Colgate men forgot football and simply tried to protect themselves. We have no doubt that Colgate regarded the game as highly unsatisfactory. In fact that that is the animus of the statements which have been made by Colgate is plain to every one. Colgate expected to win and being disappointed soug-ht relief in malicious accusations against her oppo- nent. The statements to which Colgate men have given rise are absolutely without foundation. The rough play of which they spoke failed to reveal itself to the umpire and we n1ay mention that Colg-ate brought with her the man who acted as umpire for one-half of the game. On the other hand Colgate wa& guilty of the only offensive thing connected with the game and that was a highly indiscreet remat·k made, as we understand, by Colgate's captain to a Union player. It is apparent that Colgate men have done noth- ing less than to circulate malicious stories to hide and to relieve the disappointn1ent which they feel at being defeated. It is in1possible to place any other construction on their actions. Colgate did not acknowledge her defeat after the usual manner of sportsmen but seeks revenge by trying to spread false stories about her opponent. Such an impres- sion is all that could be gained by reading Col- gate accounts of the game especially·by tl1ose who saw it. The inftamatory stories have evidently gained currency among Colgate undergraduates. It is needless to say that Union men do not relish the spirit that has been manifested. THE subject referred. to in this editorial should be carefully considered and meditated upon by every fair-minded man in college, regardless of of his fraternity affiliations or personal prejudices,

THE OONOORDIENSIS. 11 and it is with the sincere trust that every such student of Union will appreciate the situation of affairs and judge from the natural tendency that these seemingly bold and unwarranted references are not groundless. Union, like all small colleges, depends to an in- estimable degree upon her fraternities and is, of course, an ~xample of a college wherein fraternity life is strongly emphasized and is very instrumental in stamping the college whetherfavora bly or other- wise. So far, it ha.;; been the former. College life at large develops men more as a unit collectively. But the fraternity takes the untutored, sometimes uncouth, idividual freshman and draws out his httent talents, rounding him out. Naturally here, as elsewhere, there is a very strong rivalry be- tween all the fraternities for men, for honors, athletic and intellectual. This is not at all to be decried, if kept within the proper bounds. But just so soon as any one fraternity resorts to any actions that may be construed as unfair, this strong rivalry begins to be a menace to the whole college and gives occasion for the stren~ous oppo- sition to fraternities manifested by many non- college, and a few college men. Can they be called not justified? The fraternities alone are re- sponsible. In the several organizations in college, athletic, musical and litera;y, each fraternity is anxious to have as many as possible of its ovvn men repre- sented. Heretofore, as a generality, it has ceased there and there has been a singular freedom from partizanship in the choice of men for these teams and clubs. It should be so and has reflected credit upon the college and conduced to the existence and continuance of harmonious relations between the several fraternities here represented. But if any one fraternity, because for a certain time, happens to be in power in a particular organization and, consequently, has the selection of all the members of that organization practically in its own hands,. uses that power to the advantage and aggrandize- ment of itself, disregarding the precedent of choos- ing the men from the college or university best fi. tted for the places-then a strong protest should be made. Such should never be the case. No fraternity should use its position arbitrarily, either in emphasizing itself, bringing its members inordinately to the front or tn showing personal likes and dislikes, thereby probably losing men to the teams and clubs for future years, who digusted, would never try again. Not that the latter course is commendable, but such would be the tendency. Give the deserving tnen the places, irrespective of their fraternity or whether they have fraternity relations or not. In that way college spirit will be fostered and increased. The opposite course of procedure conduces to the destruction of this same college spirit and love for the college, to loss of respect for those who are guilty of the indis- cretions. It is to be hoped that this will appeal strongly to all the men in college and that they will realize what an opportunity there is for such evils to creep in and one and all denounce partisanship in the choice of athletes, of musical men, of literary men. Let Union be represented, at all times, by the best possible teatns and clubs, and fraternity and personal grievances be eclipsed by the desire that all organizations be representative of Union, not alone of one fraternity or a clique of fraternities. THE MESSAGE. (From tile German of ,Heine.) Gird up I and rein thy noble steed, My trusty dauntless vassal, And spur with more than 'customed speed To Duncan's royal castle. Then slip within a stall and hide Until the hostler passes, And seek of him, who is the bride 'Mong Duncan's bonnie lasses? If the btutlette he then shall name Haste thou to me the message, But if the blond another claim- T'will be a woeful presage! .And thence to the rope-maker's shop And buy for me a halter, Then ride back slowly, speak no word Yet pray thee, do not falter.

,il 'I 12 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ACCIDENTS OF FOOTBALL. (From the Boston Herald.) One of the New York papers has already be- gun its annual crusade against football. It prints a list of players who have been injured so far this season, as well as the announcetnent of the death of two boys who were victin1s of the game. No one doubts that football is a rough sport, and it would be in1possible for two teams to meet in a hard struggle without sotne slight injuries to the players; but it is not fair to print a long list of those who have tnet with minor accidents, and frotn this argue that football is too dangerous to be permitted. · Men have been killed and are often injured in baseball matches, and yet no one would propose to do away with the game on that account. In fact, in the whole list of outdoor sports, there are very few that have not caused injury to players at one time or another. As a rule, in :ft)otball tbe most serious accidents happen to players who are not trained and seasoned in the gan1e. In the long list of matches that have been played by the big four of college football-Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Pennsylvania-we do not remember a single fatality, and surely these contests are among the stiffest held on the gridiron. There is in the public mind ~ tnistaken idea as to the way football injuries are received. They are generally blamed on the n1ass plays, ·where the men are piled up by rushes through the center of the line, while it is really in the open playing tbat most tnen are hurt. When a rnan running at top speed is thrown by a hard tackler he runs greater risk of injury than does the back who, with lowered head, plunges into the opposing rush line. Just as long as football is played hy athletes, there will be accidents ; but if the game is kept within the rules by an efficient umpire and the men are trained in good physical condi- tion, there is not danger enough in it to warrant its being taken frotn the list of college sports, where it now stands in the first position. Captain Gould of the Yale eleven has said that, halfback Morley of Columbia is the best man for such a position on the gridiron this year. CAMPUS NOTES.

News of a personal nature, about any alu1nnus, will be glat!ly received a1td printed.] ~ ~~· ~-''The Rev. Cornelius Van Santvoord, D. D., died October 31, at his redidence in Kingston. Old age caused failure of the heart and he passed away quietly. \Mr. Van Santvoord was born in 1813, and was, therefore, 88 years old. He graduated frotn Union in 1834, and becatne a clergytnan of the Dutch Reformed church.· At one time he held a pastorate in Scotia and from 1858 to 1S6r he was acting pastor of the First Reformed church of this city. When the war broke out he went to the front and was chaplain of the 12oth Regiment, New York Volunteers. He later held pastorates in this state and retired from active ser~ sotne years ago. \ Mr. Van Santvoord came of a fatnily long prominent in Schenectady and vicinity. In the early part of the I 8th century, one of his ancestors was pastor of the First Refonned chur,ch of S~henectady. His father, the Rev. Staats Van Santvoord, Union 18 r r, was a clergyman for 70 years, and, at the age of 90, delivered the benediction in Dutch about · 20 years ago at the 2ooth anniversary of the found- ing of the First Refonned church. ,_ Semour Van Santvoord, Union, '78, the den1ocratic candidate for mayor of Troy, is another relative. A grandson is in the Schen- ectady postoffi.ce, and a son was for some years on the editorial staff of the Daily Union news- paper. \ The deceased is survived by his wife and one daughter, Gertrude, both of whom reside at Kingston.\-Daily Union. '42.-Eliphalet R. King, who died on September 2, at the home of his son, Roswell H. King, in Brooklyn, was formerly a promi- nent resident of Troy. He was a brother of Harvey J. King, '48, and an uncle of Edwin A. King of Troy. He was graduated at Union College in 1842, and was admitted to the bar, and for a number of years was a partner .of Judge Buell in Troy. Subsequently he gave up the practice of I'aw and entered into other pur- suits and removed from Troy more than twenty years ago. He was a trustee of the State Street Methodist church for a number of years. '48.-· In the Contributors' Club department of the Atlantic Monthly for October there is an article on the \ Honesty of the Late William J. Stillman.\ The author of the article expresses hitnself as singularly conscious of one quality in the article upon reading the essay on \'Beauty\ in the Septetnber number by the late WilliatnJ. Stillman. This quality, the author continues, was prominent in Mr. Stillman's essays on J ournalisn1 and Literature in the Atlantic last spring and also in his ''Autobiography of a Journalist.\ This quality was Mr. Stillman's intellectua~ integrity. The author says : \But both the autobiography and the essays have left me wondering whether honesty is not after all, one of the rarest equipments of a writer.\ Continuing to speak of Sti1lman he says: \He was on good terms with his own conscience, whatever ill forfune he tnay have suffered in his brave adYentures in a fast-changing world; sure- footed in traversing the Adirondack wilderness and the maze of European revolutions and the unblazed paths of intuitive philosophy, because he was first of all sure of himself.\ '6I.-In the issue of November 2, of the New York Times, in its Literary Review there is an article by Dr. William H. McElroy on \The Late William Carey.\ The article is an appre- ciation of the tnan by one who knew him intimately and one who was best qualified to write such an article. Dr. McElroy says in part spe&king of the man, ''Disparagement was not to his taste-such was the generosity and tolerance of his nature. His golden heart was reinforced by an uncommonly alert and brilliant intellect. He was a wit of the first order, a keen and racy cotnn1entator on men and things. His admirers used to say that not infrequently

Many of his mots are the delight of the clubs, mots free from the alloy of rnalice. He was con- stantly hitting the hull's-eye, but none of his arrows were poisoned.'\ \ His long connection with the Century Magazine brought hitn into close relations with the authors of the cou n:try. He was a great favorite with them, a fact attested by his library, which abounds with presentation books and manuscripts.\ Continuing Dr. McElroy offers his eulogy of the kind and unselfish friend: '' When such a soul withdraws, the world is impoverished. \He took our daylight with h itn, The smiles that we loved best. '' '76.-The Utica Saturday Globe, of the issue of November 2, contains a sketch and portrait of Prof. Olin II. Land1~eth, the head of the engineering department at Union. The article gives a brief review of Prof. Landreth's success in his chosen profession with his many honors and responsible positions which he holds and has held. '77.-A most interesting golf contest took place on the links of the St. Andrews Golf club, L. I., on October 30, when college graduates cotnpeted for honor. The affair was at 36 holes, medal play and W. K. Jewett of Williams won with a net score of I 56. Oscar H. Rogers of Union had a net score of 177. All the principal colleges in t~e United States were represented and some fine playing was done.-New York T~1nes. '83.-B. Cleveland Sloan has been awarded the prize of $100 offered by the Bdggs Real Estate Con1pany to the salesman selling the n1ost lots in the Boulevards tract. Mr. Sloan, immediately on receipt of the satne sent $20 of the atnount to swell the fund for the benefit of the Rev. Horace G. Day. '88.-In the death of Williatn Gibson GH- IUOl;lf, which occurred at his residence, No. 215 Union street, on October 31, the loss of one of the city's best known and most estimable yonng men is recorded. The deceased was taken ill about a week previous with an attack of pleurisy. It developed into pneu1nonia and on the following Tuesday his condition becan1e serious. OL Wednesday, however, his condi- tion seemed good, and there were bright hopes of his recovery. About ten o'clock on Wednesday night he began to fail rapidly and death resulted a fe\i\r minutes before seven o'clock the next morning. Willian1 Gibson Gilmour was a son of the late John Gilmour, '57, and was born in this city in 1866. He was graduated from the Union Classical Institute with the class of 1883, and entering Union College, was graduated from that institution with the class of 1888. He took up the study of law and attended the Albany Law School and was adn1itted to the bar in r89o. He never actively engaged in the practice of SWELL CUT GARMENTS.

The Concordiell sis VoL. XXV. UNION COLLEGE, NOVEMBER J4, 1901. No. '6 .• ~OCHESTE~ DEFEATED. In a Snappy Game Union Wins Her Third and Last League Game of the Season. Union won the football pennant of the New York State IntercoJlegiate League for the second successive season last Saturday by defeating the eleven of the On iversity of Rochester at . Rochester by the decisive score of 23 to 5· The game throughout was tnarked by lightning fast formations, perfect interference, clever general- ship, crisp and snappy play on the part of the Union players. Rochester put up a strong game but at no time was tbe result of the gatne in doubt. The Rochester supporters were con- fident that Rochester would win or at least hold the G&rnet down to a small score, but their hopes were doomed to disappointment. Almost all the play throughout the entire gan1e wai in Rochester tern tory. Union's backs were faster than those of Rochester, and the Garnet line was far superior to that oi its opponents. Union repeatedly held Rochester for downs while Rochester obtained the ball but once on downs. Union's interference was excellent. Fumbling was ft~equent on both sides. Mallery was easily the best man ofhoth teams. He did the tnost ground gaining for Union. Cronkhite again exhibited his wonderful quick- ness and accuracy. Griswold played an especially strong game and through his quick- ness tnadethe last touchdown for Union. Paige, Gulnac and King made good gains for Union. Finegan and Collier played an excellent game at left and right tackle respectively. Baxter and Zitnmer were the best players for Rochester, n1aking good gains and tackles. Gladwin was the strongest man in the line. Hyde wa~ a good ground gainer. FIRST HALF. Rochester kicked off to Union's twenty-five- yard line and Union brought it hack fifteen yards. After two downs Paige punted to Rochester's thirty-two-yard line. On ·Oster- houdt's fumble it was Union's ball. On the next two plays Union brought the ball to Rochester's two-yard line where an off-side play gave the ball to Rochester. Then Rochester advanced the ball to their twenty-five-yard line where Osterhoudt punted to Union's forty-yard line. The ball was brought back twenty yards and then by line bucks and end plays the ball was brought to Rochester's twenty-yard line. A centre play, line buck and end play put Mallery over for the first touchdown after eight and one-half minutes of play. Cronkhite punted out and Paige n1issed the goal. Rochester kicked off to Union's thirty-five- yard line. Union was forced to punt and Paige punted to Rochester's fifty-yard line. Hyde made five yards and then Union obtained the ball on downs. Mallery and Olmsted gained ten yards. Rochester obtained the ball on a fumble and then advanced the ba11 to Union's twenty-yard line where Lawton futnhled the ball. Union advanced the ball to Rochester's forty-yard line where Rocheiter obtained the ball on a futn ble. Rochester brought the ball over the centre line when Hvde fumbled the \' ball. After a few short gains Mallery was given the ball on a double pass and with good inter- ference made a run of £fty-five yards for a touchdown~ Cronkhite kicked out and Paige kicked the goal. Rochester kicked off to Union's ten-yard line and Union advanced the ball to the forty-yard line where Rochester obtained the ball on a fumble when time was called. Score, Union, I I ; Rochester, o. SECOND HALF. Union kicked off to Rochester's ten-yard line when~ Osterhoudt picked up the ball and made

6 THE CONC·ORDIENSIS. a run of sixty yards. The ball was then ad- vanced to Union's twenty-five-yard line, where Rochester lost the ball on downs. Union ad- vanced the ball fifteen yards and then Paige punted to the centre line. After three downs and no gain, Osterhoudt punted to Union's fiye- yard line where it was Unior1's ball first down. Paige attempted to punt, but punted into the line. The ball rolled behind the goal line and Zimmer fell on it, scoring Rochester's only touchdown. Osterhoudt failed to kick goal. Union kicked off to Rochester's twenty-yard line. Rochester advanced the ball to Union's forty-yard line and then pnnted to the seven- yard line. The ball was brought back fifteen yards. On the second line-up, Mallery, aided by good interference, ran around left end for a touchdown. Paige kicked the goal. Rochester kicked offout of bounds and on the second attempt kicked the ball to Union's ten- yard line. Gulnac brought the ball back twenty yards. Union advanced the ball to Rochester's thirty-five-yard line when Paige \vas hurt and King took his place. King made several good gains and the ball was brought to Rochester's three-yard line where Union lost the ball on downs. On two line-ups Rochester made no g~ins, on the third line-up Rochester fumbled the ball and Griswold picked it up and brought the ball up for a touchdown. Mallery kicked the goal. Rochester then kicked off when tin1e was called. Score, Union, 23 ; Rochester, 5. The line-up: Union. Position.

In the November issue of ''The American · Monthly Reviews of Reviews\ appears a very in- teresting artide about Dr. D .K. PearsonsofHins- dale, Ill.,. who is known as the \ friend of the American small college.\ He ranks with such men as Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rocke- feller in his beneficence and philanthrophy to edu- cational institutions, indeed, the results have been far more reaching as he has made his endow- Inents to the smaller colleges. Dr. Pearsons is a Vennonter by birth but a Chicagoan by adoption. He prepared at Bradford Acadetny for Darmouth in which he ~pent one year. Though educated for a physician, he practiced his profession but little. He went to Chicago at the beginning of the heavy boom in real estate. He rented a space in a law office and \ hung out his shingle.\ His scrupulous honesty and business actunen soon brought hitn all the business he could handle. His expe11ses were very light and he and his wife lived very 1noderately so he was enabled to save almost all his cotntnissions. He always gave assistance on a fairly genero.us scale to worthy causes but it was not until r89o that he gave anything to an educational institution. His first gift in this way was to Beloit, College located at Beloit, Wisconsin, which inaugerated a career of judi- cious giving to the stnall col1eges of the West which will make his name famous forever in Atnerican educational annals. His gifts to col- leges up to date atnount to $3,4oo,ooo.oo and his gifts were so conditioned upon the. giving of others that he has brought into the treasuries of these colleges not less than $~,ooo,ooo.oo. Dr. Pearsons has been asked whv he cho&e the . J small college as the object of his beneficence? He replied that the small college rather than those of the great universities tnake up the moral backbone of the nation. He believes, further, that the moral and intellectual life of the students of the small college is conserved by the greater intimacy between the instructor and students and atnong the student body. Like Mr. Carnegie, Dr. Pearsons is a Scotch ... Ameri- can but one with an infusion of good Yankee blood. ·' ...

Hawkins, ex-rgoz, passed the State Bar examinations recently held at Syracuse. He will be sworn in at the next term of the AppeUate Division to be held at Brooklyn. The cancellation of the Union-Syracuse game was a great disappointment to the school, as ex- tensive preparations were under way for having the Law department represented on the campus by a large body of\ rooters.\ A movement is on foot among the juniors looking to the organization of a \ debating union\ for the discussion of legal and semi- legal topics. At a well-attended meeting of thost h_ terested, held on Friday evening, Albert E. Bryan, Harcourt M. Taylor and Leopold Minkin were appointed as a committee to investigate the matter, and report a plan of organization. In order to accommodate the rapidly increas- ing number of students cotning fron1 states that do not follow the '\Code s,·stem\ a course of lectures on Cotn111on Law Procedure, by Mr. Lewis R. Parker, has been added to the curri- culum. Me.tnbers of the senior class are allowed to choose between this. course and that on \ Code Procedure \ delivered by the dean. At present there are students from Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Illinois, Kentucky, Kansas, and other states, so that for thetn this course should prove ·most advantageous. 1904, 11; 1905, 0. In the third game of the inter~class series played on Thursday, the freshmen were defeated by a score of I I too. Their opponents, 1904, averaged in weight about the satne but played much fiercer football. Lack of practice showed most of all in the avidity with which 1905 futnbled the ball, since the sophomores made their second score on a fumble. No members of the 'varsity squad were allowed to play. Manning, Nutt and Vedder made good gains for the freshmen. 1904's backs were united in doing efficient work and were ably supported by Bradley, their right end. When the game was called, the sophomores won the toss, and chose the kick-off. Imme- diately after the ball was put in play, I 905 fumbled and lost the ball. End plays netted the sophomores four yards but Watson failed to gain his distance through the line. The fresh- men secured the ball and promptly lost it on a fumble. After a couple of line bucks, Langlois circled the left end for a touchdown. The goal fol- lowed. Score, sopl1omores, 6; freshmen, o, after four n1inutes of play. On the kick-off Sherrill advanced the ball fifteen yards. Watson and Glutzbeck made two or three yards apiece and behind good inter- ference Bradley advanced the ball seven yards, but lost the ~all. 1905 failed to gain and punted. Small gains obliged the sophotnores to return with a kick. With the ball on the fifteen-yard line the freshmen punted. A fumble occurred and the freshmen recovered the ball on the sophomores' twenty-yard line. R~tymond and Holmes made gair.s but fu1nbled and Glutzbeck !

Entered at the Post-office at Sehenectady, N. Y .• as second- class matter. Ctas. Burrows, Printer, 414: State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. ON the college oval next Saturday will occur the fall inter-class athletic meet. The manage- ment is especially anxious to have all of the man- agers of the class teams to use their best endeavors to have their classes well represented at the meet. This mee4:: is intended principally to bring out any latent qualities that may be in the freshman class. Now is the best possible time for them to try their powers to see what they really can do. Let every man in the freshman class show up and every man in the other classes, who thinks he can do anything on the track. Trips will be taken in the spring, one has been positively decided upon, that to New York University in May. If a sufficient number of men show up on Saturday and the quality of their work will warrant it, a coach will be secured who will carry the candidates through a course in THE game with Rochester on last Saturday com- pletes the list of League game's for this season with Union again the victor. Union has well earned the pennant for the season of 1901 which she will receive in due time. Colgate stands second to Union in the number of League games won for the season, having two to her credit and having lost one. Hobart won one game and lost two while Rochester did the same. Union won her games fairly and justly and has just cause for feeling pleased with her record. It is with no feeling of crowing that this is said for there are two things we learn to do at Union and those are to take defeat and victory alike in a true sports- manlike manner. When Union. is outplayed and is beaten it is acknowledged, and not a long list of excuses made in explanation of it, nor do we \ indulge in any attempts at belittling our victorious rivals by giving exaggerated ac_9ounts of the game to the public press. CLASSES IN BIBLE STUDIES. At the Vesper service Sunday evening last, H. L. Crain spoke of the reorganization of the Bible classes conducted under Y. M. C. A. direction. The invitation was cordial for all the students to join one of the classes of which there will be two. The work taken up will be a continuation of that of last year, employing the same books: ~'Studies in the Life of Christ,\ by Shannon, and \Studies in the Acts and Epistles,\ by stevens and Burton. The president wishes it clearly . understood that the course involves personal study by each member of the class. Plans are being perfected for the work to begin at once. It is optional with the student which course he may choose to pursue. However, it may be stated that the \ Studies in the Acts and Epistles'' is the more advanced.

THE CONCORDIENSIS.· 11 COLLEGE NEWSPAPERS AND MAGA- ZINES. We hear a goo~ deal nowadays about the in- fluence and the freedom of the press. College students have found that the old adage, '' The pen is mightier than the sword,\ is true of · nndergradtu1te life, and instead of breaking windows and committing other lawless acts, they make known theh grievances in the regular college organ, thus bringing the matter before the faculty in a legitirnate way. Except in some rare instances th~ freedotn granted the college press is remarkable. This by no means hnplies that the faculty is always in syrnpathy with the views expressed. Far fron1 it. With the decline of oratory and debate the literary life has found its only expression in the college tnagazine. The matter found in such publications as the Yale Literary Magazine, the Nassau Literary Magazine, the Red and Blue of Pennsylvania, the Amherst, Williams, Wesleyan and Dartmouth literary monthlies, the Uni- versity of California Magazine, and tna111 .others, shows that the ability of the student to express his thoughts in clear, vigorous English is not on the decline in our collegiate institutions. According to the best information obtainable, the oldest publication is the Yale Literary Magazine, which was established in 1836. The next is probably the Nassau Lit., of Prince- ton, having been founded in 1842. In no paper in the country can be found a better class of hurnor than in the Harvard Lampoon, the Cor- nell Widow, or the University of Michigan Wrinkle. It is the kind that does not leave a bad taste in the mouth. Yale was the £rst college to· have a daily paper. Ever since the first issue in 1878 the Yale daily news has stood well in the lead, hav- ing a circulation at the present time of nearly twenty-five hundred. The Californian, the Car- dinal of the University of Wisconsin, the Daily Princetonian, the University of Michigan Daily, the Pennsylvanian, and the Harvard Crimson are reported to have a thousand or over. The Brown Daily Herald and the Cornell Daily Sun, thongh not having so large a circulation, are well edited papers. It is needless to say, being .. true of tnost publications, that they are issued only during the college year. In one instance a Sunday edition is printed, with, however, an omission of the Monday's issue. This enables the students to get Saturday's news while it is still fresh, and does away with the Sunday work for Monday's paper. From a journalistic point of view Yale is the foremost college in the country. At New Haven there are published Yale Altunni Weekly, Yale Courant, Yale Daily News, Yale Scientific Monthly, Yale Review, Yale Record, Yale Lit- erary Magazine and Yale Medical Journal. Possibly the first and last mentioned might not strictly belong under the head of college journal- ism. Harvard, Michigan, Princeton and U ni- versity of California are exceptionally well represented by student publication. According to the latest reports there are two hundred and sixty-six collegiate periodidals printed in the United States. This is exclusive of all fraternity publications. Of this number one hundred and fifty are monthlies, sixty-five weeklies, eleven dailies, twelve quarterlies, ten bi-weeklies, nine semi-monthlies, three semi- weeklies, four tri-weeklies, two bi-n1onthlies.- Ex. STUDENT VOLUNTEE~ MOVEMENT. D. Brewer Eddy, Yale, '98, who is traveling this year in the interests of the Student Volunteer Movetnent for Foreign Missions gave an address in chapel last Friday afternoon on the work. Mr. Eddy expects to go to India as a missionary within the next few years, his mother being there at present ai principal of a school for the children of missionaries. He has also a brother in the mission field. Mr. Eddy during his undergraduate life at Yale took a prominent part in college affairs. He was for three years on the Yale Glee Club. He.has traveled quite extensively in Palestine, Egypt, India and England and gave a very interesting appeal in behalf of the great work.

A number of Union alumni who are in the test department of the General Electric Com- pany attended the test banquet held in Albany at the Stanwix Hall on last Friday evening. Chiefly through the agency of the manager of the baseball team, L. W. Bloch, the baseball pennant of I goo has been secured and is now displayed in the trophy room in Silliman Hall. lNTE~·COLLEGIA TE .. A book entitled \The History of Athletics at Princeton\ has been published. The Berlin Academy of Science recently elected Hon. A. D. White an honorary member. The faculty of the University of Iowa are seriously considering the giving ot credit for work done in intercollegiate debate. The total nutnber of candidates at the June entrance examinations at Harvard was I,425, as against I ,461 in 1900 and I ,369 in r899· At the University of Minnesota the question of allowing one semester's credit for a year's work in the Glee and Mandolin clubs is being agitated. Princeton defeated Cohunbia in their annual Tennis Tournament, winning five of the six tnatches in singles and all three of the matches in doubles. Several of America's largest colleges have en- rollments as follows: Harvard 5,740, Michi- gan 3,8r3, California 3,216, Cornell 3,ooo, Pennsylvania 2,583, Y gle 2,544· Michigan University is the first college in the country to atten1pt to support two daily papers. The U. of M. Daily and the Varsity News are the nan1es of the two c01npetitors. The freshn1an clasR at Harvard numbers 553, and at Princeton the entering class has 400 members. In both of these institutions these numbers surpass all previous records. Harvard won the team championship of the Intercollegiate Golf Association, defeating Yale by the score of I 2 to 3~ points. By this victory Harvard becomes the permanent possessor of the Ardsley ~up. The Pennsylvania debate committee has chosen for the debate with Columbia the nega- tive side of the question: \Resolved That any amendment to the constitution of the United States providing a change in the method of treaty-tnaking is undesirable.\ Pennsylvania will probably support some change which will tnake it more difficult than at present to make treaties.

THE CON·CORlJIENStS. 13 THE ABOLISHIN·G OF HAZING BY WESTERN COLLEGES. It would seem as if the time-honored customs established in the· colleges of this country were to be generally revoluntionized in the West. Last year twelve students of the sophon1ore class at the Universtty of Iowa were expelled for kidnapping the president of the freshman class on the eve of the freshman banquet. These students were atnong the best in the university and had voluntarily confessed to the kidnapping. Lately, twenty-nine students of the University of Mh;souri were suspended for '' setting up\ a freshman. They \'rill not be allowed to enter again unless they individually apologize to the victim of their sport. The freshman was taken into the woods, stripped and n1ade to dance. The faculties of a great many western colleges and universities have strictly prohibited all practices of hazing and rushing between the two under classes. The cane rush is a thing un- known to many western college men. ~ESULT OF LEAGUE GAMES.

Union was defeated bv the Brown eleven last ., Saturday at Providence, R. I., by the score of 24 to 5. Brown played a steadier and more cons1stent game than Union except in the first part of the seeond half when Union by fencing in her ends, and also in sending some well- directed formations against the weakest spots in Brown's line sent the backs and ends down the field for eight and ten yards gains, until Captain Mallery went over the line for a touchdown. The Union team was considerably weakened by the absence from the gatne of Paige at full-back, and also by the absence of Bryan in the first half and Collier in the second half. Union had considerable difficulty in her punting as the absence of Paige nec'essitated Raymond's punt- ing. Brown outweighed Union slightly. Union by far excelled Brown in team work, playing a strong garne from start to finish, and \ it was only by line drives of the fiercest kind and end runs of a telling nature\ that Brown made her touchdowns. Brown men showed much better form than they did early in the season,· and there were several exhibitions of good individual playing. Brown obtained the ball on Union's forty-five- yard line on a punt and by end plays and line bucks Brown brought the ball within a few yards of Union's goal line when Greene was set_t over for a touchdown after nine tninutes of play. After obtaining the ball on her fifty-yard line Brown advanced the ball twenty-eight yards and then Greene made a run of thirty-two yards for her second touchdown. Brown obtained the ball on Union's forty-yard line on a punt and by end plays and line bucks brought the ball over for a touchdown in the first part of the second half. After a run of twenty .. three yards Webb made Brown's last towchdown toward the latter part of the second half. Union made her touchdown after six minutes of play 1n the second half. The Garnet obtained the ball on the middle line on a fumble and by line bucks and runs around the ends brought the ball to Brown's five-yard line when Mallery went through left tackle for a touchdown. Thebo made good gains and played a good gam.e throughout, and Olmsted a strong game at right end. Mallery and Collier also played a strong game. Finegan played against the strongest man in Brown's line and succeeded in keeping Savage in his place. Greene was the best ground gainer for Brown and made several brilliant tackles.. Denico played a strong game and kicked the four goals in the absence of Captain Bates, who did not play owing to injuries received the week before .. Union won the toss-up and chose to defend the west goal. Brown kicked off to Union's thirty-yard line and Mallery was tackled imme- diately. Raymond punted to the middle of the gridiron. Greene made seven yards through left tackle. Brown lost the ball and Union tried the left end for no gain. Mallery went through right guard for five yards and Finegan circled right end for six yards tnore, bringing the ball to the centre line. Gulnac went through left guard for fourteen yards, and King made a few yards through centre. Raymond was forced to punt and booted the ball to Brown's forty-yard line. Den1co brought the ball back seven yards. Cann went through the line for five yards and after another unsuc- cessful attempt, Denico punted thirty yards. Raymond returned the punt eighteen yards. Denico ran the ball back twelve yards. By short gains the ball was brought to Union's three-yard line. when Greene was sent over for the first touchdown. Denico kicked goal. Union kicked off to Greene, who brought the ball back sixteen yards. Brown brought the

.. : , I•' i 'r 6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ball up to her four-yard line where she was forced to punt and Denico punted twenty yards. After two downs, Raymond punted and Denico brought the ball back eighteen yards. Union obtained the ball on a fun1ble and Raymond punted over the goal line. Denico punted out trom Brown's twenty-five-yard line to the middle line. After a few s,mall gains Union lost the ball on downs. Then Brown made several end runs and Greene n1ade a touchdown by an end run of thirty-two yards. Denico kicked goal. Raymond kicked off and Scudder returned to the thirty-yard line. After a few small gains Denico punted to lTnion's forty-yard line. Mallery made a short gain around left end and Collier ran around right end for thirty-five yards. Raymond then punted when time was called. In the second half Union kicked off to Scud- der. Brown advanced the ball to the middle line where Union obtained the ball on a fumble. Thebo and Bryan clipped the ends for six yards each. Mallery made an end run of twelve yards and Finegan bucked the line for a couple of goal gains. Bryan and Thebo again circled the ends for small gains. Finegan made three yards around left end bringing the ball to the five-yard line. Mallery went through left tackle for a touchdown. He missed at a try for goal. Brown kicked off to Union's ten-yard line and Thebo ran the ball back six yards. Gulnac and King circled left end for short gains and Raymond punted twenty yards. Denico made five yards and Farbell twelve yards. Webb and Savage each made short gains. Brown received ten yards for off side. After a few small gains Farbell went over for the third touchdown and Denico kicked goal. Raymond kicked off to Brown's twenty-yard line and Scudder brought the ball back fifteen yards. After a few short gains Union was penalized 10 yards for off-side. The ball was brought to the twenty-three yard line and Webb went through the line for a touchdown. Denico kicked goal. Union kicked off and Crowell brought the hall ba·ck twenty yards. Shortly after time was called. The line-up : Union. Positions. :Brown. Thebo .............. left end ..............

'ritE CONCORDIENSlS. SENIO~S, 2 ; JUNlOQS, 0. In an interesting game on the campus Wednesday, November 13, the seniors defeated the juniors by a score of 2 to o. The in- clemency of the weather hindered a fast and snappy gam·e. There was a very strong wind blowing throughout the entire game, as a result fumbling was trequent, especially on the part of , the juniors. The juniors made most of their gains through the line, but when they had the ball on their opponent's five-yard line, the senior line stood firn1 and the juniors lost the ball on downs. The seniors made most of their gains around the ends. At the end of the first half the score stood o to o. In the latter part of the second half the juniors had the ball on their fifteen-yard line and being unable to gain the five yards in two downs, Pritchard punted. The ball went straight up in the air and the strong wind blowing at that time sent the ball to the north behind the juniors' goal line. Pritchard fell on the ball and was itnmediately tackled by Hawkes, thus making it a safety for the seniors. The seniors won the toss-up and chose to de- fend the north goal. The juniors kicked off to the seniors' fifteen-yard line and Anderson brought the ball back fifteen yards before downed. On the line-up I 902 fum bled and lost the ball. The juniors advanced. the ball to the seniors' fifteen-yard line where they lost the ball on a fumble. Carver punted fifteen yards and Staeber carried the ball back to the seniors' five- yard line. The seniors line held firm and the juniors lost the baH on downs. Carver punted to the centre of the field. The juniors advanced the ball five yards and then lost it on a fumble. Griffith m~de a gain of twenty yards around the left end but the ball was brought back ten yards the seniors having been off-sided. Time was called. The seniors kicked off to the juniors' fifteen- yard line and after a gain of ten yards Pritchard punted to the centre of the field. The seniors fumbled the ball and lost it, but itnmediately regained the ball on downs. After two downs and no gains Carver punted to the juniors' three- yard line. The juniors advanced the ball to their twelve-yar4 line and were forced to punt. Pritchard punted the ball behind the junior goal line and fell on the ball, m~aking a safety for the seniors. The juniors kicked out from their twenty-five-yard line and soon after time was called with the ball in the juniors' possession on the seniors' forty-yard line. Line-up. 1902. Positions. 1903.

!' ! . THE CONCORDI~'NSIS. ALBANY LAW SCHOOL. John L. Cummings, of Middletown, N. Y., has entered the junior class. Morris H. Shedd, of Low·ell, N.Y., a former memb~r of the class of 1902, has re-entered the School. Tibbitts Walker, ex-1901, of Albany, and Robert M. Eames, Union A. B. '99, LL. B. of Albany, were admitted to practic.e at the November term of the Appellate Division, Third Department. Mr. B. Learned Hand, the latest addition to the faculty, is a rising young attorney and well known as a deep thinker and a brilliant student. His lectures on '' Quasi-Contracts\ will add greatly to the curriculum. At a recent meeting of the Board of Trustees Lewis E. Carr, Esq., '64, was elected a trustee to fill the vacancy caused by the death of the late James W. Eaton. At the same meeting Dean Fiero was chosen treasurer of the Board, that place having been formerly held by Mr. Eaton. The following are the juniors who have joined the legal fraternities: Phi Delta Phi- Hugh H. Leland, Ottawa, Ill. ; Edward M. Fuller, Chicago, Ill.; Dwight W. Marvin, Troy; Porter L. Merriman, college 'o1, Albany. Delta Chi-General W. Sayles, Rome, N. Y.; Charles A. Dunn, Whitesboro; Lincoln W. Morrison, Thompsonville, Conn., William Rooney, Ballston Spa; William B. F. Rogers, Kingston. At a meeting of the juniors interested in the formation of a legal debating organization, held on Friday evening the 15th inst., on adjourn- tnent from the previous. Friday . ev.ening,_, it was resolved to make a practical test of the ' scheme, and Friday next was set as the time when a regular discussion of some legal topic will be had. Mr. Taylor, the chairman of the meeting, was in~tructed to make all the necessary arrange- ments. There is much need for the organiza- tion of a society of this character, and it seem.s to be left to 1903 to take the first step. COLLEGE CALENDA~. FRIDAY, NovEMBER 22. 3 :30 P.

THE, CONCORDIENSIS. 9 · THE MEDICAL. CAMPUS- NOTES. The attendance at this year's session of the Albany Medical College is very gratifying to the dean, Dr. Albert VanderVeer the registrar, Dr. Willis G. Tucker, and the other members of the faculty. The extension by law of the course from three to four years and the increase in the mental req uirernents for admission have very naturally contributed to the reduction of the very large classes that were formerly grad- uated frorn this institution. One notable result of these bars about the profession, is that the students as a class are better equipped for the study of tnedicine and are capable of greater endeavor and higher accon1plishments. The course has been improved and the students dur- ing their last year at college have more practical work and when graduated are better prepared to begin their careers as practicing physicians and surgeons. The seniors are preparing for what protnises to be the most interesting upper class election of recent years. The most sought for offices of president, valedictorian and alternate valedic- torian will furnish the chief sources of battle. The eligible list con1piled by the faculty was made known Friday. Frotn this list, which will not be made public, the chief officers will be selected. No natnes are spoken of for office, but the beginning of the week will show the little groups ''getting their heads together\ in the corridors and elsewhere, to select their choice. T'he \sophs\ are patiently awaiting the upper- class elections, theirs being next in order. Freshmen so thickly populate the city that the sophon1ores are at their wits' end to know how to arrange for a class spread undetected. Where freshmen go is dangerous for sophotnores, and freslunen .are so plentiful, they are seen in all parts. Freshn1en, especially, are longing for November 27, when their first vacation will begin. Lectures will be resumed December z, and continue until December 23, when mid- winter vacation will begin. Clark, ex-1903, umpired the Senior-Juniot football game last Wednesday. Professor Ashmore attended the Episcopal convention in Albanv last week. \' Ostrander, 'oz, Gillespie, 'oz, Hoxie, 'o3, and Drees, 'o4, visited friends at Williams College last week. President Raymond delivered an address be- fore theY. M. C. A. of Johnstown last Sunday afternoon. The date for the next J ~nior Hop has been fixed for December 6. The hop will be given as usual in Nott :Nlemorial Hall. The com- mittee intends to give the best dance. possible. The college quartet has been selected and is composed of E. T. Grout, 'oz, leader, first tenor; W. G. Craig, 'o4, second tenor; S. D. Palmer, 'o4, first bass, and A. H. Hinman, 'oz, second bass. The following young alumni have been on the hill during the past week: W. H. Swann, '98, S. G. H. Turner, 'g8, A. 0. Casey, '99, W. F. H. Breeze, '99, M. M. Price, '99, C. J. Potter, 'oo, and E. W. Sylvester, '99· Pearse, 'o3, has organized the class for study- ing the \Acts and Epistles.\ The class has no stated leader and is not in the fonn of a lecture. · The n1e1nbers of the class tneet once a week and discuss the points they have derived from a week's study of the lesson. Through the efforts of some of the ladies of the faculty and the city and the Woman's Auxiliary of theY. M. C. A. under the leader- ship of the president, Mrs. William Wells, a fine upright piano has been placed in Silliman Hall for the benefit of the College Y. M. C. A. A committee consisting of Hawkes, 'oz, and G. Donnan, 'o3, from the Adelphic Society, and Adams, 'oz, and Gillespie, 'oz, of the Philotnathean has been appointed to arrange a debate with Rutgers College to be held some- time during the winter term, at Ne_w Bruns- wick, N.J.

Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Ohas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. Saturday, November 23, New York University vs. Union, at New Yor.k.. IN accordance with the usual custom during vacation week there will be no paper issued next week on account of the Thanksgiving recess, IN the game at Providence on Saturday it is the concensus of opinion that Union played poorer football than she has done this season. With Paige out of the game entirely and Bryan being able to play only one-half the game, and Collier, Cronkhite and Finegan being unwell, it is not surprising that the team did not show up to its played a strong game from start to finish an(.} it was only by line drives of the finest kind and end- runs of a telling nature that her men were downed to the tune of 24 to 5.\ It says of individual players: ''Thebo, the light-haired left end on the Union team, was a tower of strength. He played as good an all around game as anyone on the field. Captait1 Mallery and Finegan also kept their ends of the fray red hot.'' The Boston Globe in ali account of the game says: ''Olmsted of Union was one of the best ends seen on the Brown gridiron this year. Mallery and Collier also played a strong game for Union.\ THE Concordiensis is in receipt of a charming volume of verses entitled \In College Days. Re- cent Varsity Verse\ from the publishers, Knight and Millett, of Boston. The selections are chosen by James LeRoyHarrison, editor of Cap and Gown, With Pipe and Book, etc. The book contains 273 poems, specimens of recent college verse collected from magazines of colleges from all over the United States. The collection, as a whole, is very good and contains charming bits of verse. It is with much regret that it is seen that the name of Union does not appear on its pages, while colleges com- paratively insignificant have their representa- tives. The interest in writing and in literary production, among the undergraduates, it must be confessed, is dying out at Union~ With more truth it might be said that it is dead and has been for some years, in fact it may be said to have de- parted with the class of '99. A very occasional bit of verse in the Concordiensis and a few poems in the Garnet represent all that the undergradu- ates produce in this line. In the volume of the Garnet gotten out by the present senior class there were a batch of poems and a half-dozen prose articles and even these were contributed, for the most part, by men who were taking the engineer- ing course. The decline of the literary spirit may have been caused by the discontinuance of the literary monthly, The Parthenon, in 1899. It was the aim of the editors at that time to make the Concordiensis a combination of the weekly and best advantage. A Providence paper says: \Union monthly papers. With what success their. efforts '.~ I .. ,.

s TilE CONConnlENSlS. 11 w,ere crowned may be judged from the present state of affairs, with the Concordiensis entirely a news- paper and Union represented by no literary n1.aga- zine whatever. THERE exists in a great number of .American colleges what are known as Sectional Clubs. To explain, all men in college from a certain State or city, or ·section, get together and organize a club. The purpose of these organizations is twofold, first, in getting men in a co11ege from the same neighborhood to know one another better and secondly, in getting students for the college by working mainly among their preparatory schools. Such clubs cannot but be good for a college and there is no reason why there should not be several such clubs at Union. Although here the large majority of the students are from New York state, yet a good many come from certain sections, from certain cities and certain preparatory schools. There are at present twenty-one men at Union from Albany alone and at least twelve from Troy, and there are seventeen from Schenectady, doubtless a large nutnber being U. C. I. men. Theri there are seven men from South Carolina alone, and ten in all from the South. There is no reason, to repeat, why the organization of such clubs should not be effected at once and work be begun in earnest for the college. FO\QTHCOMING CONTESTS ON THE GRIDI\QON.

It is strange that with the thousands of men who are being graduated each year from our colleges and with the large number of prominent literary men who have been college graduates. there is no description or story of college life that belongs to the realm of true literature. If, as we have so often heard, the four years spent at college be the crucial period of life, the time when character begins to take on its final aspect, when the tastes, inclinations, and friendships of a life time are being formed, it must be one of the most interesting periods of life to study and one about which a master might write one of the world's great books. Of course, we have Harvard, Yale, Bryn Mawr and any number of other \stories\ which are interesting in their way, but which no one would think of as great. Then there is \Tom Brown at Oxford,\ but that is too little read, especially by college n1en, to deserve serious consideration. Yet there is a book whose greatness no one questions and which, though not dealing to any considerable extent with college affairs, yet because of its spirit and general character tnay truly be called a college man's book. I refer to Thackeray's \Pendennis.\ It is true that \Pendennis\ appeals to n1any per- sons who have never been in a college class just as the \Complete Angler\ appeals to many persons who never fish. Univet·sality is a requisite of all true literature, yet as the \'Com- plete Angler\ .does not appeal to a person who has no sympathy with out-door life, so \Pen- dennis'' never appeals to one who does not sym- pathize with college life ; who has not some of the college man's spirit in his or her breast. This statement is borne out by the fact that so few young ladies are able to appreciate the character of ''Pendennis,\ while there at·e few college men, so far as I know, who have read the book and do not like it. ''Pen dennis is a conceited fool, and none too good either,\ sotne one may say. Well, he is conceited, he does not exhibit any unusual brilliancy and he certainly isn't an angel, but he is, nevertheless, as humble, as wise and as good

I; 19 . 'THE CONCORDIENSIS. as is the a~verage young man. It is because he is a typical college man that the book is so attractive. There is nothing unusual in his life. He has his boy's love for a girl far be- neath him, for whom he is willing to die,. but he gets over his passion, as we aH do, and goes to college. There he spends too much money, is a trifle wild, neglects his work, and is finally \ plucked.\ Then he goes to London to read law, falls in with Warrington, another college man of the rare type that is in one's good fortune to meet occasionally, and we have de- lightful description of their Bohemian life which, so far as I know, is the best thing of its kind written. What an ideal life they lead, not a strenous nor a wicked one, but a charming·, easy-going style of living, savoring of beer and tobacco as well as of true manhood and friend- ship. They have no particular responsibilities nor restrictions except ~elf-imposed ones. They stay out all night if they please; there's nothing particular to do in the · morning, wandering around the city, watching the people, singing in the \Black Kitchen,'' and talking about everything conceivable. Pendennis is sorely tempted and does not come out with any great glory ; at one time he becomes worldly wise and rather blase, as we all do some time or other, and almost marries for her tnoney a shallow society girl. Y ... et through his weakness we see his real manliness; if he is vain and foolish he is also kind and noble and whatever he does you feel that his heart is right. There is, as has been said, a spirit in the book, an understanding of the life of a young man with its hopes and aspirations, its tern pta- tions and weaknesses which tnake the book peculiarly attractive to college men. It is the life of a young man much like the rest of us having similar tastes and experiences, and if we are inclined to be too hard on Pendennis or our college mates whom he represents, let us ren1ember the words with which Thackeray closes the book : \We perceive in every man's life the mahned happiness, the frequent falling, the bootless endeavor, the struggle of Right and Wrong in which the strong often succumb and - the swift fail ; we see flowers of good blooming -in foul places, as, in the most lofty ~nd -s'prendid fortunes; flaws of vice and m-eanness ~tnd:·stains of evil ; and, knowing how m.ean th-e best of us is, let us give a hand of charity to Arthur Pen- dennis, with all his faults and shortcomings, who does not claim to be a hero, but only a rnan and a brother.\-The Campus. JUDGE LANDON TO :QETIRE. Hon. Judson S. Landon, one of the trustees of Union College, and judge of the Court of Appeals, will retire frotn the bench on January 1, 1902, on account of his having reached the constitutional age lirnit. Judge Landon is not incapacitated, however, for V\'ork on account of his age and it is to be regretted that> the state will lose the service of this able legal mind be- CRuse of the constitutional litnit in regard to age. Judge Landon has won an enviable record for hhnself as a jurist. His service on the bench has extended over a long period and has been marked by close and diligent application to duty and a demonstration of ability that fevv Judges have been able to reach. ] udge Landon has been a trustee of Union for some years having been made one in r 878. From 1885 to 1888 he acted as president of the college performing the duties of the position in a most satisfactory manner. SOI:REE MEETING.

The Concordic11.sis VoL. XXV. UNION COLLEGE, DEOEMBE.R 5, 1901. No. s. ,. PUBLIC SERVICE AS A CAREER. First Lecture of the Year. Ron. George Frederick Seward, '6o, former Consul General to China delivered an instruc- tive lecture on ''Public Service as a Career\ before a good sized audience in the chapel Fri- day evening, Novetnber 22. In introducing the speaker, Dr. Rayn1ond said that it was fitting that the subject should be discussed by a Seward as the fatnily has been prominent in national circles for many years. Mr. Seward said in part: '' I hope you young men won't think I am too old to say sensible things to you and I hope that what I say will be of some service to you. ''There is no more interesting problem for· a young man than the question of v,r hat is to be his career. It is equally true that the predi- lections of young n1en are not always wise. It is a serious problem to choose one's vocation and it is more serious because it tnust be done when the experience of the individual is slight and his judgment itnmature. '' The idea of a career in the public service is captivating. Love of country is one of the noblest sentiments which can take possession of our n1inds. The desire to serve one's country is akin to it. I doubt not that every young man before me is ambitious to gratify so noble an ambition and I commend him for it. Ambition is the tnain-spring of action. It is ignoble only when perverted. The atnbition to be useful in your day and generation is an ideal to live up to. The ambition to do one's duty waits on no distant reward ; the reward is ever present. The fundamental idea of service is permanent employment. \ The public service of our study for this after- noon is what is generally called the civil service and it is limited to the executive civil branches of government, national or st~te. It has been the object of civil service reformers in this country to bring all permanent employes of the national governtnent under civil service rules, yet they have fallen short of the object, for more than roo,ooo higher paid places are reserved for nomination by the president, and it is among these roo,ooo excepted places that the spoils system finds free play. \The public service is not attractive at first view-· less so on further study. A government servant if he loses his position has nothing to which he can turn n~r has he acquired any ex- perience that tnight be valuable to him in the business world. An office not covered by the civil service offers no pennanent caree1·. The public servant settles down to a life devoid of atnbition. It is as if he heard, ' Leave hope be- hind, all ye who enter here.'\ Having so far presented only the discourag- ing side of the public service, Mr. Seward then went on to say that there was another and better spirit in which it should be regarded, and that it is the duty of every citizen not to despair. Young men should rnake it their object in life to serve their country and not be men of affairs tnerely. '' Be tnissionaries, but be wise. Study the systetn of governments cotnparatively, the n1erits and failures of our own system, the system of protection, how to gather revenue, the issue of currency, the supervision of corpora- tions, the problem of taxation. All of this may be done without the holding of office and will ultimately result in successful organization which will defeat the politicians who seek the spoils alone. ''You young men will soon be on the ground. Begin your public service by a private career, doing whatever rewards best. honest effort. Do the nearest duty first, and above all things preserve the sanctity of the home. \ The great men who have left Old Union to hold high places in the public service have blazed the way for you, and it is your high privilege to follow in that way.\

THE OONCORDIENSIS. UNION, ll ; NEW YOQK, 11. The game with New York at Berkley Oval, New York, on the 23d shou]d have been a victory for Union and a tie score does not represent a true con1parison of the teams. In the first half New York University was unable to make her distance but once and Union held the ball practically all the time. New York's scores were made through luck and poor handling of punts on the part of Union-· the same thing that was responsible for two of the scores made in the Cornell ga n1e. At one tin1e Union had the ball on New York's four-yard line. The ball was given to New York. They punted to their fifty- yard line where Cronkhite dropped the ball after it had bounded and a New York man fell on it. New York again punted to Union's twenty-yard line where tbe sarne thing happened and Trede catching the hall on the bound ran for a touch- down. In the second half Union had trouble with punts and New York made some con- sistent advances with the ball. A delayed pass by New York gave them fifteen yards around Union's right end and brought them to the four- yard line. They finally got the ball over. Both of Union's touchdowns were made in the first half and were the results of irresistable attacks by Union's backs, ends and tackles. Mallery made several long gains, Gulnac was strong on tnass plays through the tackles, Ohnsted got around the end nicely and Collier several times ploughed through from seven to fifteen yards. Paige also shot through the line for good gains. Union clearly had the stronger team both on offense and defense and had she been surer on punts could have won easily. FIRST HALF. New York kicked off to Mallery on the fifteen- . yard line, who advanced to the twenty-yard line. Gulnac made seven yards, Paige two and one- half yards, Oltnsted five yards, Finegan three yards. New York then got the hall and Trede made three yards, Cleverdon two yards. New York's right tackle on the third down tried a drop kick for goal but was unsuccessful. Union took the ball on her twenty-five-yard line. Mallery made five yards through the line and twenty yards around the end. Collier five, Olm.sted seven, Collier two, Paige four and one- half, Mallery two, Gulnac no gain, Thebo ten, Olmsted two and one-half. 1Yl allery then took the ball straight through to Ne'v York's three- yard line. Paige could not gain and in two downs Mallery carried the ball across the goal line for the first touchdown, made in twelve minutes. Paige kicked the goal. New York kicked off to Olmsted on the fifteen- yard line and he brought the ball back fifteen yards. Collier made two, Mallery one and Paige three and one-half. Union got ten yards for an off-side play. Gulnac then made four and one-half yards, Paige three, Mallery four and one-half, Thebo no gain. Gulnac made seven yards, Mallery two and again two and one-half, Paige three, Finegan five, Collier fifteen, Thebo seven, Gulnac two, lVIallery four. This brought the ball to New York's four-yard line where the referee gave it to New York for Union's off-side play. New York then punted to her fifty-yard line and secured the ball. Another punt carried the ball to Union's twenty- yard line where Trede caught it on a bound and made a touchdown. No goal was kicked. Paige kicked off to New ):.,.. ork' s five-yard line and New York returned the ball on a punt to Cronkhite on Union's fifty-yard line. Finegan n1ade seven yards, Collier eight, Mallery nine. A double pass was attempted but was unsuccess- ful. Ten yards was given to Union for off-side play by New York. Collier made three yards on a tnass play through New York's right tackle. Gulnac made three yards and one yard on mass plays, Mallery four yards on a line buck, Thebo made no gain, Collier four yards, Gulnac one yard, Mallery no gain, Collier six yards, Mallery on a line buck four yards for a touchdown. No goal was kicked . After New York's kick-off to Ohnsted who made twenty yards, time was called for the end of the half with the score Union I I, New York 5· SECOND HALF.

New York tried a drop kick but Bryan broke through and blocked it and Union got the ball on her forty-five-yard line. Olmsted made one yard, Paige five yards, Mallery one yard, Paige three and one-half yards. Union fumbled to New York and Trede made ten yards and three more gains of three yards each.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. THE FOOTBALL SEASON. A Brief Qeview of the Work of the Team. Union closed one of the most successful seasons in its history with a game with New York University at New York on November 23. The schedule of this year was larger and heavier than in former years, Union having thirteen games on the schedule, eleven of which were played. Seven victories, two tie games, and two defeats is the result. Although about the same teatn as of the 1900 season presented itself at the beginning of this season, nevertheless there were many obstacles which had to be overcome. The weakest point which presented itself was the position of quarterback. Union had not had a good quarterback since the graduation of \ Bill\ Smith, '99, and the graduation of Weed, 'oi, n1ade the 'varsity tninus a quarter. This obstacle was soon rernoved by Coach Smith by the selection of Cronkhite, 'o4, for that position. That he fulfilled every hope and expectation is no exaggeration. He generalled the team well, ran back punts in good shape and was an excellent tackler. The filling of the position at right end was another troublesome question. The inability of Olmsted to play at the beginning of the season made Coach Smith and Captain Mallery a little uneasy, but their uneasiness was soon dispelled by the selection of Hawks, 'o2, and Patton, 'o5, for that position. Hawkes played a good snappy game. Patton was a fairly good man, but was lacking in experience and energy. He undoubtedly will develop into a good player. During the latter part of the season the team was considerably strengthened by the reentering into the game of Ohnsted. That he played his usual good game goes without saying. The report that was current in the early part of the term that GriRwold, last year's center, would not return to college was seemingly another setback to the efforts of Coach Smith to put out a winning teatn. Raymond, 'oz, carne forward for that position· Although he had not played for the past three years, nevertheless he played a good game. Griswold returned to college however, after the first gam·e had been played and filled the positions ~t centre and left guard when Bryan was on the sick list with credit to himself and to the college. The return of Bryan of the Law to his position at guard strengthened the team wonder- fully. He was undoubtedly was the strongest man on the line. During the latter part of the season Bryan was unable to play a whole g~me on account of a very bad knee, from which he is still a sufferer. Shaw started into play in his usual position at right tackle, but it was soon found that he played a better and stronger gi}me at right guard, so was shifted to right guard where he play~d a good game. Collier played right guard the first part of the season, but was put in at right tackle later on. He played a better game at tackle than at guard owing to his strength at gaining ground with the ball. Finegan played a good game at left tackle. His weak point, if it may be called weak, was a tendency to be off-side too often. Thebo played a sotnewhat erratic gatne. In some games he played ball excellent while in others he played a much poorer game than he is wont to. Mallery played an excellent game at left half- back. He is undoubtedly one of the best half- backs Union has ever had. Gulnac played a good defensive game, but was rather poor on the offensive. He was slow in getting off. He followed his interference well. E. King, a freshtnan, as substitute half and fullback, exhibited tnany, signs of the good n1aterial in him. Another season will greatly improve his usefulness .. · The strongest tnan on the tean1 and beyond a doubt the best fullback Union ever had, was Paige, college, 'oo, Law, 'o2. He played a superb offenRive and defensive gatne. He is a wonder- ful man j n the interference and at line bucking will be found to have fe·w equals. On the de- fens_e he vvas in every play a11d an aln1ost sure tackler. He is now confined to his bed suffering I f

THE CONCORD!ENSIS. 9 fro,m injuries received in the New York game. As was frequendy noted in press criticisms Union's strong point was her teatn work. The number of plays was small, but evet·y play vvas executed with retnarkable accuracy and speed. Every man was in his place on the instant. This is the secret of Union's offensive work. On the defensive Union was practically strong and titne and again it happened that Union seemed in imminent danger of being scored on when the teatn would take a stand that was un- yielding. Union has for the second consecutive Jear won the pennant of the New York State Inter- collegiate Le~gue. She won every league game by a decisive score·. She defeated the st1·ong Laureate Boat Club eleven before the team had gotten into any condition to play. The strongest eleven that Cornell ever put out rnade but four touchdowns against her. The Ithacans made three touchdowns against the Indians the fol- lowing week and rolled up the same .score against Columbia and the University of Penn- sylvania. The Garnet twice defeated the Rensselaer Polytechnic Inl:ititute by a large score, and easily autplayed Amherst although neither side \cored. l'he University ofVern1ont eleven· proved to he a snap for her. Union received a bad defeat at the hands of Brown. That team although somewhat weak in the be- ginning of the season, grew stronger as the sea5on progressed and the week before the Union game held the strong Lafayette eleven down to the score of I 1 to 6. In that gatne Union's team was so badly crippled that it was an impossiblity to have put up a better game. In the last game with New York Unh·ersity the score catne out r 1 to Jl. New York had a far heavier team than Union. It was tnainly owing to U nion.'s inability to handle punts that New • York scored at all. Cronkl;ite manifested the same weakness at Ithaca and that was responsi- ble in a considerable measure for two touch- downs. Cronkhite is a brilliant player and could he cover the' ground a little better on punts would have overcotne his only weakness. He should show sotne improven1ent next year. New York made her distance but once in the first half. One of the most encour~ging signs of the season is the good scrub which was on every afternoon on the campus to line up against the 'varsity. No little of the success of the season is due to their willingness to be knocked about by the ~trong 'varsity eleven. To Coach h Bill\ Stnith and Ca pta1 n Mallery much praise is due. To their untiring and p:tinstaking eflorts the greater p<~rt ( ,f r he success of the season is due. Captain Mallery handled the n1en undt r hin1 in an t.ffic1ent manner and by his earntst and reli(:l hie playing set an exatnple which the other men could have safely follo\ved and u nd<)uhted ly did f<)llow. \Bill\ Smith by his endeavors showed his enthusiasm and love for his alma mater and has won the esteen1 and thanks of every loyal son of B Old \ Union. Before closing the review of the season it must not forgotten that thanks are due to Manager Woolworth for his efficient lll~Jnage­ ment. At all times he has labored for the teatn. He has n1ade one of the best foothall mana<rt·t·s :-. Union has ever had and through his efforts has carried the season and schedule to a successful close. The season's scores are: Sept. 28. Oct. 5.

THE football season of 1901 has come to a most satisfactory close. There was a possibility for an improvement, but taking it all in all, the obstacles which had to be surmounted and mishaps which come in the regular order of things, the judgment can only be that it was a successful season. The team, one and all, played good football. There were some mistakes made and these are recognized and should be avoided in another season. Dr. Towne gave to the tean1 the benefi. t of his splendid ~ experience in athletics. Captain Mallery captained his team in a most praiseworthy manner. Coach \Bill\ Smith came back to his Alma Mater and has by his labors this season increased the debt which every Union man owes to him. May his re- turn be. yearly and may it be fraught with the success which comes· when he is with the team. Ta:E necessity arises that the time-worn protes!t be made concerning the small 1number of under- graduates who take the trouble to attend the lectures which are given in the chapel at intervals throughout the college year. Pitiable is the con- dition of the student who is so short-sighted that he cannot see the immense amount of good that is to be derived from attending these lectures. If he have no appreciation of the trouble and expense that is incurred in securing lecturers, if he have no sense of the common courtesy that is due a lecturer who comes for the purpose of giving of his knowledge for the benefit of others, then let him, at least, attend from merely a selfish motive. Often times the lecturer, is a gradua~ of the college and yet that does not seem to inc~se the number. Discouraging, indeed, must it be to an alumnus who comes, learned in the school of years, back to his Alma Mater to give words of counsel and wisdom to the sons still in the mother's care and • finds a mere handful of underg!aduates before him. DEBATE WITH :QUTGE:QS. Concerning the debate which Rutgers pro- posed earlier in the term, the following action ·has been taken: The cotnmittee- W. H. Adams, 'o2, and W. H. Gillespie, 'o2, of the Philomathean, D. C. Hawke~, 'o2, and G. W. Donnan, '03, of the Adelphic, met and decided to notify Rutgers immediately of the acceptance of the challenge, and is now considering terms. The debate will probably occur during the latter part of the winter tenn. · ~. P. I. BASKETBALL SCHEDULE.
