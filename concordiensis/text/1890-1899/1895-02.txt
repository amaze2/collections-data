The address now and then takes on the character of sermonizing, and the speaker urges. his hearers to guard well their good character, as such only is consistent with the nature of the society. He demands that the exercises be al\v-ays conducted with decoru1n, and that their hall be nothing but the scene of lofty literary labor. Woe then to the flagrant offender who has spent late hours of the previous night in mirth and pleasure, and appears on the scene of debate with brain ben1ud- . ,dled, and forgets his piece. With what scorn such culprits ·were punished is only open to conjecture. We of the present day n1.ay well exclain1 '' te1n:1_Jora rnutan- t~~r.\ The opening of the address would per- haps provoke a srnile from the reader; and shows that in one trifling respect the Gustoms of our college world are similar to thos~ of the past. His are the same (perhaps not then but certainly now) well- worn words which presidents n1ust needs use in assun1ing the duties of office-the extreme fear of thei1~ inability to do jus- tice to their duties; the overpowering sense of inefficiency; their desire, how- ever, ·to do their best, etc. But this sn1ile, if such there be, quickly passes away, ~or the speaker is in all earnest- ness, and clearly betrays those qualities which rnust have eminently fitted him as a presiding officer. Fron1 reading the address it is at once easy to perceive that there was an ele .... ment present then which does not exist now, a social aB well as a literary side. These two elements, then inseparable, continued so for a· long time, despite the gradual accession of the Greek letter fra- ternities w'\hich were· destined to absorb the social life to themselves. The union of the two elements was probably the reason of the societies' long and flourish- ing existence. Of late, however, the social elen1ent. seems gradually to have w€akened, and upon the revival of the' societies, ceased to exist, they now being formal debating societies. 'Though at present they play but a minor part, both societies are rapidly ac .. quiring strength; and a duty rests upon the college to insure their success. The · presence of a well-ordered debating society is a course of elocution in itself, and .. should, it see1ns, be considered as such, and hence carefully fostered. Although in the more~ exciting and pleasant diver- sions of college life theiT importance is apt to be lost .sight of, in after life it will sat·ely be felt. W. A. J., '95. Day of pray~r. The usual observance at Union of the· annual day of prayer for colleges, was attended with services of great benefit · a11d interest to all who participated. The morning service at the chapel was largely attended by the faculty, undergraduate body, and a nutnber of their friends. The Rev. Dr. Sawin, pastor of the First ·Pres- byterian Church, of Troy, preached the sermon, Dr. Ray1nond assisting in the .. · service. The speaker selected as his text verses 64-66 of the sixth chapter of John's gospel. Throughout his entire discourse his hearers listened with the closest atten- tion, and expressions of their appreciation of his remarks have since been signal and nu1nerous. In the afternoon a praise service was held, at which, after a brief, pointed ad.: dress by President Ray1nond, the open n.i.eeting was participated in by many of those present, ·' & <j_ ' i ' -:l.;. .. , ' ' i ' 1~·1:· ' : J ' ,. ~~ . ~ ' f \

Y., was the speaker, and he told of his recent visit to the late home of Tennyson, and many reminiscences of the deceased poet. Prof. Riggs quoted several verses from '' In Memoriam\ and others of Tennyson's poems. He said, the works of Tennyson will continue to have great. influence over ·the nations of the world. Tennyson breathed on dead bodies and brought thern to life. He was not a copyist but was ever in touch with the passing events. He knew of the affairs of the people, and by the purity of his divine power placed music in everything. Side by side .with his contemporaries, the body of the poet laureate lies in Westminster Abbey with the simple inscription, ''Alfred Tenny- son,\
