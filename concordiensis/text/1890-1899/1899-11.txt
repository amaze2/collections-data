Two events of recent occurrence tnark a new phase in the developtnent of the colored suffrage question in this country. One is the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States affirm .. ing the validity of the suffi·age clause of the Mis- sissippi constitution, thereby acknowledging the right of a state to litnit the exercise of its suffrage, although the restrictions irnposed are expected to apply to the colored race only. The other is the election of Novetnber, r898, in North Caro- lina, and the spirit in which the result has been received throughout the country. 'I' he election is acknowledged to have been revolutionary. in its character, but there is no disposition tnani- fested to interfere or question the pennanence of its result. The question is rapidly ~earing a crisis. The South, impatient under the rule of ignorance and incompetency, anxious for the vYelfare of their country, and goaded to desperation by the tnaladministration of negro control, have risen in protest and are endeavoring by legal means to free thetnselves frotn the hated yoke. \ The whites must rule,\ is the battle cry to which all the South is rallying. Already many of the southern states have passed constitutional atnend- tnents placing educational and property qual ifi- cations on the right of suffrage, aitned directly at the disfranchisement of their negro popula- tions. Mississippi took the first step by fratning a new constitution, the suffi:age clause of which can be so interpreted as to· dissen1inate against the ignorant colored voter and in favor of the ignorant white voter. South Carolina followed in 1895, adding in addition to the educational test a property qualification, and in 1897 Louisi- ana vvent further than either of the other states by lin1iting the application of the tests to those fan1ilies who had not had the rig~t of suffi·age before r867, thus openly and without even the setnblance of justice depriving the negro of his constitutional rights. 1'o us of the North, itnbued as we are with the spirit of political equality and the doctrine of universal suffi·age, with no parallel environ- n1ent to warp and bias our judgtnent; such tneasures are without support in law or justice, directly contrary to the fund~tnental principles of a Republican govern1nent. But is this true? Is universal suffrage the foundation of a govern- n1ent of the people by the people and for the people? Suffrage is not a natural right; nor a legal, political or general result of freedom or citizenship. The large tnajority of citizens do not and cannot vote. Ignorance and poverty in whatever class, without distinction of race or color, ought to be and must eventually be excluded frotn all share in government. U ni- versal suffrage has no foundation except in the popular intelligence. It would be a great relief for sotne of the ballot-box evils, if the example of New England, where the electorate is of the highest order, were followed by all the states. Massachusetts requires of voters a prepaytnent of taxes, and voting and officeholding are limited to those who can read the constitution in the English language and vvrite their own names .. If then a property and educational qualification for sufliage is considered necessary in those states in which the average of intelligence is so high a~Hl in which there is no clearly marked distinction of classes ; how much more necessary are such tests in the South, where the distinction between poverty and wealth, intelligence and ignorance is so tnarked and where such an in1passable batTier exists between the thriftless,

6 THE OON0'0RDIENSIS. illiterate black on the one hand and the pros- perous intelligent white on the other. Although we cannot but condetnn class legis- lation, has the disfranchisen1ent of the negro no justification? Of aU the i In portant constituant parts of our rfation the negro is by far the most ignorant; nearly half of the race are absolutely illiterate, only a tninority of the other half have a cotntnon school education while but a remnant are liberally educated. The negro has not been, either by apprenticeship, nor political education, nor inteUectua.l culture prepared for the electoral franchise. Colored suffi·age was a wrong to the nation, to the states, to the white and black races and eS})ecially to the blacks themselves. Negro suffrage as a rule is a farce, a burlesque on elections. Tl1e negroes vote as puppets, as machines, without the least con- ception of the significance of the act they are perfonning. Is it just, t11en, that the right of suffrage should be left in the hands of those who neither l{now nor are capable of knowing the responsibilities which accompany it? Is it just to the South, is it just to the nation that ignor- ance and superstition should have an equal share in the governtnent with intelligence and reason? Should there not be some educational qualification for suffrage which will secure the South from the rule of 1nen who can neither read nor write ? Yet such a condition of affairs exists in many districts of the South today. In tnany instances local administration is ahnost entirely under the control of the blacks. What is th~ result? The reins of governn1ent are loosed, law and justice are suspended, riot and critne are rife, and social and economic disorders overrun the com- tnunities. In Wilmington, for exatnple, which was the center of disturbances in North Caro- lina, all the principle offices were in the hands of the negroes. What was the condition of the tnunicipality under such a 1·egitne? There was no security for person or property, foreign capitalists were afraid to invest their n1oney, business interests suffered and the pr.osperity of the city declined. Are then cotnmercial interests and municipal \Vvelfare to be endangered by the maladministration of negro control? Up to the present time the black has shown himself utterly incapable of governing. All his efforts in that direction have been failures. As long :as he continues shiftless, ignorant, incompetent and superstitious, is there not justification in the refusal to give the Negro absolute con,trol over invested capital and tnunicipal affairs. Again the negro of the South, living as a rule frotn hand to mouth, lazy, thriftless and unpro- vident, contributes little or nothing to the support of the state. Should then the non-taxpayers have an equal share in the government with the tax- payers ? Our forefathers fought for no taxation without representation ; is not the corollary as just, '' no representation without taxation ? \ ·• Yet such is the result of colored sufferage that in rnany districts of the South the negroes, while furnjshing nothing to the public revenues, have entire control of the raising and expenditure of these revenues. Is this just or fair? No. Justice and fairness both demand that sotne tnore equal distribution of po\vers should be n1ade. But what ? On the one hand the welfare of the South requires that government be in the hands of competent men; on the other, the casting and counting of his ballot is the negroe's constitu- tional right. This is the problen1. What then is the solu- tion ? Either the government will fail in the South or it tnust be tnodified in fonn. It is just that the white should rule but it is neither just to the black, nor advantageous to the white that the poor black be deprived of his right of suffrage, while t~1e poor white retains his. Deny the franchise to the black alone and we confess that our vaunted schetne of universal suffrage is a farce ; disfranchise ignorance and poverty in both classes and the principles of political equality are sustained, justice is reconciled and the welfare of the South preserved.

I·' THE CONCORDIEN81S. INTERCOLLEGIATE FOOTBALL. SATURDAY A DAY OF SUQPRISES ON THE GRIDIRON. Last Saturday's football gatnes furnif-,hed some of the biggest ·surprises the gridiron has known in a long time. Two of the large 'varsity elevens, confident of success, were outplayed and beaten by teams not supposed to rank in their c~ass. Cornell; itnaginecl by everyone to be espectally weak, took \Old Nassau\ into .. camp by a score of five to nothing, while Colutnbia, a new eleven of this single season's standing, duplicated Cornell'R score by defeating Yale in a rattling game. This latter result, while unexRected, still cannot be cotnpared with the Tiger's upset at Ithaca. Hard, active and sincere preparation for these gan 1 es by the victorious elevens is undoubtedly the cause of the' unlooked-for defeats. Columbia, undet: the supervision of an old Yale player- a discredited coach of this year, has been doing the hardest kind of work ever since August with the main object in view of n1aking \Old Eli\ hustle when the two elevens should tneet. yale's defeat cannot be ascribed to any particu- lar weakness on her part, but rather it 1nust be attributed to the superior aggressiveness and general tean1 ·work of the New Y.,.. ork eleven. The great enthusiasn1 of the Coh11nbia under- graduates at the garrte 1nay also have served as a decided stirnulus to the blue and white. Cornell has had both poor n1aterial and strife about her rnanagetnent to contend with Rince the beginning of the season. That she has done so \vell is indeed ren1arkable. Princeton's general weakness in the gatne is said to be due to. the sultry weather prevailing in New Jersey during the past week and to the consequential loss of snap and vigor atnong her 1nen. This excuse rna y go for the titne but it will not do to urge it on November 25, when t,he Yale- Princeton gatne occurs. It would seetn at present that both these elevens are very evenly matched. Their work from now on will cer- tainly be very keenly watched on all sides. The Carlisle Indians succeeded in being the first eleven to score on Harvard this season. The crirnson naen, however, proved themselves easily the superiors of the Indians in strength and endura~ce. Not a Harvard man was hurt in any way, w bile several of the governtnent school tnen had to be helped off the field. Con- sidering the Indians' ren1ark~ble showing to date, it must be adtnitted that Harvard, to all appearances~ has now certainly the finest aggre- gation of football players in the country. Pennsylvania braced up on Saturday and, despite the tiresotne effects of a thousand n1ile journey, carne very near defeating, in fact should have defeated, the strong eleven of the U ni- versity of C'hicago. Her supporters are very tnuch elated over her itnproYed showing. Considering Wesleyan's strong showing against Union and West Point's defeat of Dartmouth, an exciting struggle can be predicted \Vhen the New Han1pshire eleven encounte1·s the Connecticut teatn. VVesleyan certainly appears to have excellent chances of success. vVilliatns defeated Syracuse on Saturday by a sn1all score, but her work would not thus far indicate that she will be a strong factor in the triangular league chatnpionship. But two gm-nes now ret-nain for Union this season unless the faculty consent to an arrange- tnent for a Thanksgiving Day gan1e. Colgate and Han1ilton \vill be her opponents. Both games will be on theca tnpus and good struggles are anticip2ted. 1'he Garnet should certainly triun1ph over Colgate but the issue seen1s n1uch 1-nore in doubt in regard to Han1ilton. It will be retuetnbered that I-Ian1ilton was the only eleven that defeated ''Bill\ Smith's aggregation laf,t year and then it was by a score of seventeen to ten. Both elevens so far appear to be evenly matched and a hard tussle should certainly ensue. Bryan and Robinson have both proved thetnselves strong additions to the eleven and ·with Willis back this \veek further strength should be gained. Union's defense th_us far has been unquestionably weak. It is to be sincerely hoped for that a <.~ecided improvement ta~es place at once. Ha n11lton encounters the Car!tsle Indians at Utica this Saturday and a good tdea of her strength n1ay be ascertained by the result of that gat-ne.

THE. OONOORDil!NSIS. THE WESLEYAN GAME. Her Strong Eleven Outplays the Garnet at Springfield. Union's trip to Springfield last Saturday was unsuccessful in many ways. Not only were the Garnet representatives beaten in a thorough tnan~ ner but the mhnagetnent was not even able to defray expenses and lost tnoney to the extent of over one hundred and twenty-five dollars. Previous to starting, no one on the eleven would have believed that Wesleyan would have been able to run up a score of forty-one points to Union's nothing. That she did so, cannot be wholly traced to her superior playing, although it can be in a great n1easure. The Connecticut eleven played a strong, fast, snappy gatne, w l~ich carried the Schenectady n1en before it with rapidity. Union stood finn a nutnber of ti tnes throughout the gan1e but seetned to lack statnina at the proper tnoment. A more ilnpar- tial referee would have undoubtedly decreased Wesleyan's score and at the same tilne tnight have allowed Union to increase hers by at least five points. Referee Davis was by no means fair and several times tnade Union suffer by unjust decisions. Disapproval of his actions was tnanifested not only by the spectators but by the Springfield press of the following day. Union seemed discouraged aln1ost from the start and, after the ball had been taken away from her toward the end of the first half, played in rather a half-hearted tnanner. 1\'be ren1ark~ ably snappy play of \IV esleyan, and the utter failure of the Union eleven behind. the line, with the exception of Paige, to get into defensive play tells the whole story of the defeat. The day was rainy, foggy and as disagreeable as it could be and in consequence but two hundred people paid the adtnission fee despite the fact that the game had been thoroughly advertised. The n1uddy field and the slippery ball made fumbling frequent on both sides. The first half was fought in both eleven's territories. Union at one time succeeded in reaching Wesleyan's ten yard line only to have the ball taken away frotn her. Gordon bucked the line, got up, and the referee gave Wesleyan the ball, no one knows why. Wesleyan ran up a total of seventeen points in this half. In the second, the Garnet was ploughed through for a total of twenty-four n1ore. Wes- leyan's largest gains were n1ade by tneans of the quarterback running with the ball and by several double passes. The line up : WESLEY AN. UNION. S. Dodd ............. right end ...............

SCQUB vs. SCHENECTADY. The Second Eleven Victorious over the. Local Team. rrhe second of the series of gatnes between the second eleven and General Electric teatn of this city took place Saturday afternoon on the catnpus. The weather was datnp and sultry, but this did not keep the crowd away as there was a large repre&entation of rooters who were rnade happy by fast snappy football. During the first half, the chances were about even until near the close when the town teatn began to show signs of \veakening. During the second half, the scrub had everything their own way, vvhich was owing, on the one hand to superior all around work, and on the other to their opponents' loss of players through injuries. The playing . was fast at all titnes, and the features of the game V\'ere the tackling and gains of Stnith and Tilden for the Electrics, and the . excellent game put up by Anderson, Woolworth and Rayn1ond for the scrub. ' , ..

' )\ c THE CONCORDIENSIS. In the 'first half Union had the kick off, and after the electricians' advances of thirty yards Union secured the ball on downs. The leather soon catne again into their opponents' possession, who gained about thirty yards tnore through center rushes, but finally lost the ball on a fun1ble. Union now settled down to work and was rapidly car·rying their opponents before them when titne was called. In the second half things assumed a brighten- ing aspect for the scrub. By steady line buck- ing they brought the ball frotn their twenty yard line to the Schenectady's five yard line. A fun1ble gave the ball to the Electrics but they failed to n1ake any gai~s, and after a lively scrimn1age the ball rolled over the line and Woolworth falling on it made a touchdown. No goal was kicked, and the half ended shortly. rrhe line up follows : SCHENECTADY UNION'S FOOTBALL TEAM. SECOND ELEVEN. Glen (Capt.) , Brown .. left end ..............

The senior class football eleven, in vie'v of their approaching inter-class gan1es, met the tean1 representing the Union Classical Institute on the can1pus Friday afternoon, and defeated the high school boys by a score of 28 to· o. The superior weight of the seniors represented by such sturdy warriors as vVinterberg and ''Chicopee\ Smith, was too much for their juvenile opponents and the running up of a large score was the result. The best playing for U. C. I. was done by Steele, the left half, and Smith, the plucky little quarter back; while for 1900 the runs of Law- ton and Ripley, and the effective line bucking of Tuggey were the tno.st itnportant features. The gatne throughout presented tnany humor• ous spectacles, atnong which were: the sensa- tional run of \Chicopee who, with the pig- skin ( ?) csnugly tucked under his belt, sprinted down the field for forty ya:rds ; the resigned attitudes of the 1:900 subs., Loucks and Potter, who stood on the sidelines eager to see son1.e unfortunate classn1ate laid out; the confusion of the players caused by the appearance of a second ball ; and the beautiful run by the dog Dan. A large crowd of students both of the college and U. C. I. were present. Among the latter were a bevy of the fair sex vd1o cheered their heroes on to glory and defeat.

ON SATURDAY we shall have an opportunity to do some yelling, and let everyone come out prepared to root. This \vill be the first game on the home grounds since the appointment of the cheering leaders and everybody is anxious for son1e good systematic yelling in this, the first league game of the year. Incidentally, it would be well to tnake a good display of garnet penants. THE FOOTBALL managen1ent is in need of funds, and the advisory board reports that there is still in the neighborhood of.$400 of subscriptions remain- ing unpaid. Now these are two conditions that ought not to exist. The football team is certainly deserving of financial support. The men are giv- ing up valuable time and many pleasures for the less congenial work of training, and on every hand there is to be heard nothing but praise for team and managen1ent alike. But words are cheap, and perhaps the very men who are so anxious to express their satisfaction have not paid in their football subscriptions. Praise is all right, root- ing is all right, it's all very well to pound the backs of the seats in chapel meeting, but just at present the team needs some tnore substantial sup- por in the shape of funds. Fellows, pay up. THE CONCORDIENSIS hereby announces the open- ing of competition for positions on the editorial board as follows: from the class of 1903 five men will be appointed as reporters, to serve during their sophomore year; and from the class of 1902 there will be four appointments as associate editors 1'7 to hold office during their junior year. Competition I will begin at once and the appointments, which will be announced on· or about the first of May, 1900, will, in every case, be made on a basis of work submitted. The attention of sophomores, in particular, is called to the fact .that any member of the class may try for a position as associate editor. The mere fact that a man has \made\ the paper during his freshtnan year is in itself no reason why he should be retained; and the five sophomores whose work, as regards quantity and quality, is most satisfactory will receive the appointtnents for next year. All students who intend to take up journalism as a profession or who are in any way interested in literary work, should avail then1selves of this opportunity offered. Those desiring to compete for these positions are requested to register their names with the editor- in-chief. Northwestern University has ~n endowment fund of n1ore than $4,5oo,ooo and an enrollment of more than 3,000. Being exceeded in number by Harvard and Michigan only, makes it the third largest in the United States.

'ritE CONCORD!ENSIS. 11 CHAQLES M. JENKINS, '29. Sketch of. the Life of Union's Oldest Living Alumnus. Atnong the alutnni of ahnost every college in the country there is being waged a friendly con- test as to' which one shall hold the tide of \Oldest Alutnnus.\ This spirit of generous rivalry is quickened and increased by the annual alumni banquets and reunions at which these alumni assemble, and for a short hour live over their college life, telling of their own youthful days and reviewing the past, until as the man grows older he co111 es to realize the respect and distinction that is attached to the tenn, and is filled with the desire to hold the contested title. Yale, Harvard and ·tnany other of the older ·colleges have alumni living who were graduated in the early years of the present century and in whom the undergraduates and alun1ni ·take pride and respect, but none have more just reason to glory in this fact than has our own alma mater. The tnan who has the honor of being the oldest alumnus of Un-lversz\tas Concord-lee is Mr. Charles M. Jenkins, who graduated in rS29. Mr. Jenkins was born in 181>o, at Rensselaer- ville, Albany County, where he received his early education. Later he attended the acade- mies at Greenville and Lansingburgh where he prepared for Union. Entering this institution at the beginning of his sophon1ore year; he graduated with honor in 1829. Frotn college ·he took up the study of lavv at the Litchfield (Conn.) Law School, in which the only instructor was Judge Parker, father of the present Judge Parker of this state. Since graduation Mr. Jenkins has been practicing law in Albany under the finn na111e of Cooper & Jenkins and has had a large and lucrative practice. Mr. Jenkins has always been a warnl. and loyal alun1nus of his ·aln1a 1nater and has atten- ded a large nutnber of banquets and reunions. As .. a lawyer he has been signally successful and has been connected with a number of itnportant cases and settletnents of estates, notable a 1nong the latter the settlen1ent of the Van Rensselaer estate which was one of the old Patroon .grants. Mr. Jenkins is a greatly respected n1e1nber of the Albany Bar, and is connected with a num- ber .of legal organizati~ns. While in college he was a tnetnber of the Kappa Alpha fraternity, and on graduation vvas awarded a Phi Beta Kappa key. Mr. Jenkins' hotne is at Rensselaerville, his birthplace, where in the tnidst of a grqve of locusts stands the old fan1ily hornestead, and where, surrounded hy his children, grand chil- dren and great grand children, this Christian character is quietly enjoying the evening of a life of usefulness. Special interest attaches to Mr. Jenkins at the present titne because during the past week he has been atnong us. Probably fevv of the students were aware who was the oldest living graduate of the college, and not many realized that the venerable son of Old Union was on the campus last week. Mr. Jenkins ca1ne partly on business and in part for the pleasure of seeing again the old college he loves so vvell. Friday afternoon he visited the grounds, going the rounds of the buildings and on Friday evening he attended the Kappa .. ..t\.lpha initiation in the latter's roon1s over the post office. It is certainly a rnatter of regret that the whole student body was not aware of his presence in titne to show hin1 the respect and honor \vhich is due hin1.

The college correspondents for newspapers, and other students interested in journalism to the ntunber of about twenty, met in the chapel on Friday afternoon for the purpose of organiz- ing a Press Club. The advisability of forming such a club was discussed, and all present were greatly in favor of the schetne. It was argued that all the preparatory schools within a certain radius could be kept in touch with the college by such means, and further that all the metro- politan papers should have correspondents at Union-a condition of affairs not now in prac- tice. By exercising a control over all news sent out from the college, many false reports can be done away with. These and other reasons made it apparent that the club should organize, which it did by electing the following officers : Presi- dent, Philip L. Thomson; vice-president, Gardi- ner Kline; secretary-treasurer, Arthur S.Golden; censor, Lester T. Hubbard. A committee com- posed of the president, C. P. Wagoner and P. L. Merrin1an was dire~ted to draw up a con- stitution to be presented at a subsequent meeting. DR. MULFORD'S ADDRESS. The regular vesper service was held as usual in the chapel Sunday afternoon, and the good sized audience present had the pleasure of listen- ing to the Rev. Dr. H. D. B. Mulford, professor of English at Rutgers. Dr. Mulford spoke of the bon~ of •interest between Union and Rutgers and paid a high tribute to Dr. Raymond. He then treated the merits of the book of Proverbs, adducing some valuable lessons frotn it. He pictured vision in three ways, first treat- ing its nobility, then its necessity, and finally its naturalness. In conclusion the speaker said that there has been lately a great change in the manner of study and that to everyone the need ofvision is appar- ent. We should live so as to appreciate vision, not only for this life but also for the life to .come. MONDAY'S COLLEGE MEETING. In accordance with the sentitnent expressed in htst week's Concord i en sis relative to the tnanner of exit frotn chapel, a committee com posed of the presidents and vice-presidents of the classes drafted a set of resolutions, which was adopted by the student body. It was to the effect that order of rank should be observed ; the students standing while the faculty leave and then the other classes following as their seniority give thetn the privilege. The election of the assistant track manager was the next piece of business acco1nplished and Joseph H. Cletnent, Jr., 1901, was unani- mously chosen for the office. It was the sentiment of the students that another university banquet should be held as in '98, and a committee has been appointed to arrange for it. A protest was made against the fellows crowd- ing on the field during games, as it seriously hinders the play. It is to be hoped that care will be taken in this matter in the future. Messrs. Raitt, Potter and Winterberg were appointed to petition the faculty for a recess the Monday preceding election day. 1

It would seem to be the prevailing, opinion at Union that the departments of Greek and Latin are at present equipped in a manner that is com- mensurate with their relative importance to the college. Of course no one would claitn that the ancient classics are fully provided for at Union College-that they have at their back all the books arid apparatus and teachers necessary to their fullest exposition in the light of modern standards and discoveries. But the idea is pre- valent that they are as well supported as they should be, relatively speaking. Other depart- ments of instruction in the college have their ·just claims, and to do tnore for Latin or for Greek·would be to rob the modern languages, or tnathetnatics, or history, ot engineering of their dues. Moreover the Latin and the Greek, though in theory much appreciated at Union, pdncipall y on the ground that they lie near the foundation of literary culture, attd because their place in the college curriculum is for this reason a part of the eternal fitness of things, are never- theless regarded practically as merely orna- mental studies.. They do not properly belong to the age in which we live. They have sur- vived, in a kind of half lifeless fashion, the old· time culture of a period when the revival of hutnanistic studies bad nothing to draw upon but the a11ciont literatures. The fact that classical studies, in the nineteenth century, have kept pace with and in many respects outstripped those in other branches seetns to be lost sight of at Union. The proof of this is that no provision is made for the correlated topics that have sprung into being within the last half century, and which constitute an integral part of the whole subject. But not only that : it is also true that these correlated subjects ptoperly belong now to a college course as distinct from a course at the university, and should be placed thet~e as certainly as anything else. This may be said to be a matter of opinion-yet it is admitted by college authorities, the land over, that such subjects as Classical Philology (in· its narrower sense) and Greek and Ro1nan Archre- ology and Epigraphy can no longer be confined to post-graduate courses without doing injustice to the higher education, and-to speak broadly- without seeming to disregard the den1ands made upon educators in general by the advancement of science and the growth of knowledge through- out the world. At Union the Greek and Latin languages and literatures have formed a part of the curriculum of studies since the foundation of the institution. It may be doubted whether any other subject can rightly be said to have pre- ceded them. For three-quarters of a century at least they were !·egarded as the chief source of literary culture in the college, and they were provided for as liberally as other studies. But within the last quarter of a century, while the growth of tnodern literature, the advancement of science, the spread of historical knowledge, and the itnportance of English, of Mental Phil- osophy and of Economics have all been recog- nized by those in charge of educational tnatters at Union, it would seetn as if the enormous accumulation of antiquarian lore and the vast additions to classical learning which are equally characteristic of the period referred to, had been intentionally overlooked or at best forgotten. We are content at Union to have our work in Greek and Latin limited to the translation of text books in the recitation room exactly as we were satisfied to do twenty-five years ago. No special literary facilities are afforded the student undergraduates who are at work in these subjects. No money has ever been set aside for

6 THE OONCORDIENSIS. the purchase of the latest editions, ot: of the Corpus of inscriptions, or for the acquisition of any part of tha.t extensive literature which has grown up of late in connection with philological and archaeological investigation. Union College could afford to spend two thousand dollars to\ 1norrow in equipping her departments of Latin and Greek with books and other apparatus, and that too without doing injustice, relatively speaking, to a single other departtnent ~n the institution. She could afford to do it for her own reputation. The meagre equipment of the Latin departn1ent alone - especially in the 1natter of a library-is a standtng tnenace to her reputation as a college. This can hardly be said with truth of any other department, except, perhaps, the Greek. The menace comes frotn within. It is not wholly a tnatter of appear- ances. When students fully realize that the only departn1ents in Union College essentially behind the times are those in which the classics are taught, they will give other colleges in which this is not the case, a decided preference. There is nothing that would so strengthen our college in the eyes of the students and of the world as a classical library. And there is nothing that would better repay the college for the expendi- ture of tnoney needed to fonn at least a nucleus for such a library. There are ·colleges in the country whose libraries contain as many as ten thousand volumes (besides patnphlets and peri- odicals) devoted exclusively to classical subjects. At Union it has been said that Latin and Greek are comparatively dead subjects, and that 1noney devoted to the purchase of the literature on a· dead literature would yield a less valuable return than that which is expended on the purchase of books written in the interest of the '' living\ tongues of Germany and France. If there be any truth in this view of the matter, it does not hold good for Union. It is not to the advantage of Union College to give the study of antiquity any- thing but a first place in the curriculum, or to allow the means required to place it there to fall short of full and adequate provision. That Union should be behind the titnes in the equip- ment of her classical departn1ent 1n.ust weaken her more than a corresponding deficiency in any two of the other departments of the college~ The truth is that Latin and Greek studies at Union should long ago have been furnished with a reasona\bly full library of classical works and a fund for maintaining the same, together with such other apparatus in the way ofcomrilentaries, monographs, foreign periodicals, casts, photo- graphs, lantern slides, facsitnilies of manuscripts and the lil{e, as would render it plain to all concerned that Union means to have her Classics as well taught as anywhere in the country, and as well cared for relatively to other subjects in the curriculum as their long and historic con- connection with the institution itself most emphatically demands. SIDNEY G. AsHMORE, Professor of Latin. WITH THE GOLFERS. As the golf links in the \pasture'~ have been given up, all of the playing is now done at the. Country Club. Little interest in the game has been shown this year by the students and the . only ones noticed on the links have been C. D. Stewart, 1900, and Wagner VanVlack, 1900. The faculty have been tnore generously repre- sented, and President Raymond, Prof. Perkins, Prof. Hale and Prof. Bennett have been going the rounds very often this fall. The college rnade a good showing in the tournament just held, as its champion, President Raymond, won possession of the Whitn1ore cup over nearly a score of candidates. 1901 CQOSS-COUNTRY CLUB. At a meeting of the junior class held Thurs- day afternoon in the chapel, a cross-country teatn was organized. The following officers were elected: President, R. H. Robinson ; vice- president, W. E. VanWormet·; captain, Gardi- ner Kline; secretary, John McNab; treasurer, T. H. Wight. It was decided to have a cross- country run once each week, with a fine imposed for non-participation ..

~HE CONCORDiENSiS. COLLEGE MUSICAL ASSOCIATION. Prospects for the Coming Season. The tnembers of the musical clubs are now hard at work, and the prospects for this year are very bright. The cotnpetition for places on the banjo and n1andolin clubs is not as sharp as could be desired, but the tnen have turned out in good shape for the glee club. The directors of the clubs are anxious that every man who has any ability at all shall try for a place. 'rhis will help the clubs greatly, and as the directors are all cotn pete11t musicians good practice is sure to be obtained. Last year the season closed with the associa- tion free frorn debt, but it :must have the support of the college at the beginning of the year to make it an assured success. The first chance which the students have of giving public expression to their interest in the clubs is at the Schenectady concert, and that will probably be given in the VanCurler, Dec. 8. Among the cities in which conce1-ts n1ay be given on the western trip at Christmas are, Lvons, Rochester, Batavia, Newark, Buffalo ol and Auburn. At least four of these will be visited, so that the clubs will get a. good trip. The next conLerts will be given at different titnes throughout the winter term at the River- side Club, Lansingburg, Canajoharie, Albany, Atnsterdam and Troy. During the Easter vacation the New York trip will be taken and concerts will be given at various towns along the Hudson, ending with a per.fonnance at New York. A trip through new territory is also being planned, and if arrangernents can be tnade Binghan-:1ton, Eltnira and several other towns will be visited. The Glee club this year is an assured success from present prospects. G. LeRoy Shelley, I 901, the director, has had considerable experi- ence in training clubs, and as he has excellent material to work with will certainly make a creditable showing. The competitors are : First tenors, vVeed, 1901; Crim, 1902; Hunt, 1903; Grout, 1903; and Shelley, rgor; second !enors, Weed, 1903 ; Barrett, 1901 ; Moeller, 1903; Bahney, 1902; Clute, 1902, and Read, 1900; first basses, Hinman, 1902; Green, 1903; Palm,er, 1900 ; Van Loon, 1903, and Crain, 1902 ; second basses, Stiles, r 902 ; Daley, I 903 ; Ripley, 1900; Slack, 1901; Robinson, 1901, and Macfarlane,. 1903.

PHI BET A KAPPA CAT A LOGUE. rfhose familiar with the rapid growth of the scholarship fraternity, the Phi Beta Kappa, know that for several years the work of pre- paring a general catalogue has been in progress, ·containing the nan1es of the 1nembers of each chapter. In preparation for this 'tvork, the secretary of the united chapters., Dr. E. B. Par- sons of Williams College, presented to the last National council five volumes, partly in print and partly in various fonns of n1anuscript, con- taining a nearly con1plete catalogue of the society. From this tnaterial the secretarv is now pteparing for press a general catalogue. It will be an address catalogue, the natnes with titles, occupations and addresses of living metn- bers, as many as can be obtained accurately, being arranged in alphabetical order under each chapter. The book will also contain a brief history of the society, the constitution, officers and important minutes of the united chapters, and the officers, statistics and customs of each of the fifty chapters. There will also be a list of the distinguished deceased metnbers of the society.

TliE CONCORDIENSts·. THE P~ESS CLUB. Constitution Adopted and Plans Laid. At a meeting of the Press afternoon, the following adopted: ARTICLE I. Club held Friday constitution was This organization shall be called the Union College Press Club. ARTICLE II. Membership is open to all students connected with the undergraduate publications, college cor- respondents of newspapers, and any others inter- ested in journalisn1. ARTICLE III. The purposes of this organization are: to pro- ... mote journalistic spirit in the college; to insure correspondence for newspapers and preparatory school publications; to prevent the circulation of untrue and unauthorized reports injurious to the college; and to promote the interests of the college through the press. ARTICLE IV. Meetings are subject to the call of the president or at the request of three metnbers. ARTICLE V. The officers shall be a president, vice-president, secretary-treasurer and censor. The duties of the first three are those which customarily pertain to these offices; and it shall·be the duty of the censor to suppress any reports which are deemed detri- mental to the institution. By right of his position he is privileged to examine and if necessary revise articles for outside publication. The Press Club can assure proper and concerted action with regard to a piece of news only when the censor is givetl due notification by the interested party. ARTICLE VI. _ This constitution may be amended at any meet- ing by a two-thirds vote of the members prese11t. Plans were discussed looking toward closer interests between the college and preparatory schools. The schetne finally adopted to bring about this end was as follows: The individual ·students will be asked to send their Concord i- e n sis to the preparatory school from which they respectively come. In case the school has a publication, the Concord i ens e s should be sent to its editor&, who should be asked in return to reprint notes of interest about the college. To carry out this plan the following members of the olub are appointed a committee whose business it shall be to speak to every n1an in college and if possible obtain his co-operation: Messrs. S. S. Read, 1900; H. P. Dunham, 1900; C. P. vv·agoner, 1gor; Gardiner Kline, 1901 ; A. S. Golden, 1901 ; and l). E. G.riffith, 1902. THE FIQST LEAGUE GAME. Union Defeated in a Hard Struggle on the Campus. One of the most interesting football games that has been played in Schenectady for a long time was that between Colgate and Union on Satur- day. The excitetnent was intense throughout for almost to the end the issue was in doubt. L. Waite's touchdown on a quarter back kick; Embody's s·ensational run of eighty yards on a double .pass; and Union's loss of the ball three times when almost upon the Colgate goal line, all berved to bring the spectator's feelings up to a high pitch. The score, twelve to five in Col- gate's favor, is a strong disappointment to the Garnet's snppottet·s who had hoped to see Union win out by a safe margin. Both elevens have many things to be said in their favor but it must be said that, in general field work, the Union men were superior. Colgate won the game on her trick plays which were very cleverly executed, and outwitted the Garnet. The day was a splendid o~e for football, but the field was rather muddy and slippery on account of the heavy rain of the night before. A fair sized crowd turned out to the struggle. The cheering was good but not as enthusiastic as it might have been. The play of the Garnet was considerably better than in the Wesleyan game but still was lacking in -endurance. The tnen seemed to experience little difficulty in advancing the pig- skin a considerable distance every tim·e they • '>' ,( !···':: I .. ; \ '~ l t :

Colgate's faculty of bracing and holding firm at the critical motnent showed that she has plenty ofstamina in her 1nake up. Union showed a great deal of improvement in her plays directed around the. ends and tackles. The placing of 'Carver at right half in offensive and ·.at his regular position of end in defensive play proved an excellent move. As usual, he played a strong game. He frequently stnashed around Colgate's right tackle for good gains. As in the Wesleyan game, Weed's lame shq,ulder prevented hitn from playing. Anderson, the plucky little captain of the scrub, played a good game at quarter hack. Some splendid breaking through the line and tackling was done by Bryan. Paige played his usual snappy game at full back. He made one very clever tackle in the first half. For Colgate, L. \Vaite and W. Root did son1e good advancing. Jones n1ade several brilliant tackles. Moore at right end broke up the interference well. Colgate made her first tally almost at the start o~ the gatne. Union did not wish to kick off and accordingly kicked out of bounds twice within the ten yard litnit. Colgate evidently did not understand the rules and she tried the satne tactics. The ball went past the forty-five yard line, however, and Bolles dropped on it. A futnble gave the ball to Colgate. But two plays were sufficient to secure the five points. L. Waite circled Thebo for fifteen yards; quarter back Root kicked, L. Waite caught and dashed thirty yards O'\~er the line. On the kick off, Colgate secured the ball on her forty yard line, advanced it five yards past the center of the field and lost it on offside pfay. Bucking through the right of Colgate's line by Carver and Gordon netted thirty yards. Colgate regained possession, advanced to her fifty yard line and kioked out of bounds. Line bucking shortly brought the ball up to the line and Gordon was pushed over. Paige missed his goal. Score, Colgate, 6; Union, 5· The rest of the half was very ~xciting. Carver at one time made forty yards around Colgate's . right end and brought the ball to the fifteen yard line. Gordon bucked for five more and Colgate was given the ball on holding. L. Waite shortly after tnade a pretty run for thirty-five yards. The ball changed hands again and time was called with the ball in U ni:on's possession on her thirty-five yard line. In the second half, Union twice advanced to Colgate's ten 'yard line only to lose the ball on downs. Colgate's points were made on a double pass in which En1body carried the ball eighty yards for a touchdown. The line up and su1nmary : COLGATE. UNION.

Y ., as second- class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. The sad news reaches us of the sudden death on November 4th of ~obert C. Alexander, student, alumnus and trus- tee of Union College, whose love and· loyalty to his alma mater endeared him to everyone connected with the institution. In recognition of the high esteem in which he was ·held, next week's issue of The Concord ie n sis will be a special memo- rial number. • ' ... v._ • ·- ~ . - . - - . . AFTER ITS great success in the presentation of a .. \Proposal under Difficulties,\ last June, it would ' . \ be a great mistake for the Dramatic Club ~ot to reorganize. Surely there is en'ough talent in the college to make up a large club and several plays ' .. might be given during the year, or the club might ' .. work with the Musical Association on its trips. The interest shown by the students last year and the enthusiasm with which they received the play is a sure sign of the reception further productions along that line would meet with; so it is to be hoped that a reorganization will soon be effected. WE WOULD remind contributors that no material is published in these columns from anonymous sources. The editors have no objection to printing a bit of verse or other matter with merely a letter or an assumed name at its end, but the one invar~­ able rule of all newspapers and magazines is that the writer's name must accompany his production. The Concordiensis at present holds several anonymous contributions received within the past few weeks. VoL. VI, No. 1, of the Palladium, published at the Union Classical Institute, has come to our table, and The Concordiensis congratulates the board of editors upon the appearance of the paper. Surely, if the standard set in the first number be maintained, U. C. I. will be well represented in this field. The publication is a sixteen page tnonthly and it devotes the space mainly to matters of importance and interest in school life, not for- getting to draw attention to athletics. We are particularly pleased to see that this branch of sport is in future to have due recognition in the institute, and in line with this thought we wish to express our hearty approval of the action of the . college authorities in granting the use of the campus to the U. C. I. football team for practice. The move has already brought about a closer feeling between the undergraduates and prep. boys, as is evidenced by the two games played ; and the manner in which the priviledge has been respected is a very potent reason why it should be extended to other forms of athletics in the future. ij. THE ATTENTION of the students is called to the action taken by the Press club at its last meeting, an account of which is printed in another column. A committee of six has been appointed to make a thorough canvass of the students, artd get the great. ' I ,.

This movement is a step in the right direction and should meet with. universal support. It does not necessarily mean that every man in college is sup- posed to give up his paper. But among the frater- nities in particular, where a dozen or more copies are sent to one house there are many students. who can better afford to have their paper sent direct from the printing office to the high school. Those students who are not so si i!uated may have the paper tnailed first to their rooms and then after perusal it may be sent on to the prep. school. The business manager will be glad to make any such changes on the mailing list, and the committee, to have the volunteers hand in their names, together with the new addresses. Don't wait for the com- mittee to ask y0u. but signify your willingness by approaching them. FOOTBALL SCO~ES. WEDNESDAY, NovEMBER 1. Cohnnbia, 4-5; Stevens, o.

As has been the custom in preceding years, it is the duty of the junior class of Union College to publish .a book that records the story of the past year. 'fhis task now devolves upon the class of 1901, and they are making earnest endeavors to fulfill it with due satisfaction. 'From the beginning each volume has excelled its predecessor, and although last year's Garnet is one of the best yet published the i n1 proved condition of affairs demand a supetior produc- tion this year. To accomplish this, the whole student body must co-operate and do its best in all lines of this work. It is needless to say that among the enterprises of the college, the Garnet holds a prominent place. Within the confines of the i~stitution it is of value, as it gives the student a vivid account of the events and doings of the past year, thus fonning a volume of l1istorical importance to every one at Old Union. To the outer world it shovys what the old college really is, and what position it holds in the social, ath- letic and intellectual world. Viewing, as it does, our alma mater fron1 all sides, it forms one of the best advertising agencies the institu- tion possesses. · Being of such importance, it should command the interest of every student. As an incentive to work of this kind, the Garnet board offers a prize of ten dollars to that student handing in the best n1aterial, (quality and quantity con- sidered) including pictures, stories, prose or poetry, \ grinds,\ etc., and a Garnet to every one doing creditable work. As it is the wish of the class to publish the book earlict· in the year than heretofore, imtnediate attention to this notice is requested. The Garnet board is composed of the follo¥t- ing : Editor-in-chief, John E. Pat·ker; Busi- ness Man~ger, LeRoy J. Weed; Literary Edi- tor, John McNJtb; Art Editor, Harry A. Bar- rett ; Athletic Editor, Arthur S. Golden; Secre- tary, Herbert L. Fuller; Asst. Business Mgr., George Hackett; Asst. Literary Editor, Roy E. Argersinger; Asst. Editors, Richard F. War- ner, Michael J. Thornton and James W. Miller, Jt·.

In '' The Progress of • the W orld·t the editor gives a full exposition of the British and Boer sides of the quarrel, respe<;- tively. The subject is also treated in the depart- ment of\ Current History in Caricature,\ and Mr. Stead contributes a character sketch of\ the man of the month\ in South Africa, Cecil Rhodes. President Schurman's thoughtful ad- dress to the Cornell students on \The Problem of Territorial Expansion \ appears in a reY;ised and authorized form. President Schunnan' s position as chairman of the Philippine commis- sion just about to meet in vVashington gives special importance to his expressed, op~nions of this subject. Brilliant as the aututnn tints of the woods and fields it loves so well are the pages of Outing for Noven1ber. The buck of the northern hills, the hear of the Rockies, the moose of Maine, the grouse in Michigan, duck on Lake Champlain; sport in Tennessee, and the wild yak in far-away Tl1ibet, all yield their tribute· of enthusiasts v.rriting for their kind. Football has its prophet in Walter Catnp, lawn tennis its historian in James P. Paret, golf its chronicler in Charles rfurner, and ' 4 Travel in China,\ \A Race 'Round the Horn,\ and \Yachting on White Bear Lake\ are described by well-known pens. rrhe illustrations are retnarkable, even for Outing's high standard of sporting pictures, and the Editorial Review of the tnonth's pastimes is by the foremost sportsn1en in their respective lines.

The subject of M1·. Smith's address was, \The President of the United States,\ and he spoke of the delicacy of President McKinley's position in regard to the Phillipine question. In closing he said that it was the retnarkable distinction in President McKinley's career that, \having been tnost conspicuously identified with the full realiza- tion of our hotne industrial n1astery, he should now be the nation's appointed le~der in its suc- ceeding outgrowth of its corn mercial and civil- izing expansion.\ The speech in full was reported in ~he metropolitan press, and it is well worth the perusal of every Union n1an.

Alexander, '80, Passes Away. Hi.s Life and Death Recorded in Heart- \ felt Tributes. The whole college comn1unity was saddened to learn of the recent death of the loyal graduate and trustee, Robert Carter Alexander, editor of the Nevv York Mail and Express. In recog- nition of the high regard in which he was held by everyone connected with Union College, this issue ofT he Concord i ens is is made a special I n1emorial number in his honor. MR. ALEXANDER'S CAREER. Robert Carter Alexander was born at West Charlton, N.Y., July 5,1857. James B. Alexander, the clerk of Schenectady County, and the Rev. George Alexander the pastor of the University Place Presbyterian Church of New York, are his brothers. He is also survived by his father, a sister, and another brother, William, of West Charlton. ; He was graduated from U. C. I. in 1876 and entered Union with the class of 1880. He took a great interest in all undergraduate affairs and was an active member of the Adelphic Literary Society. He won both the Inghatn and the first Blatchford prize, and was elected to iP. B. K. on graduation. In 1881 he was graduated from the Albany Law School and was admitted to the bar in the same vear. worked for its advancement but he kept up his interest in the students. He founded the Alexander Prize for Extemporaneous Speaking and was a regular attendant at commencement. It was he who revived and set on a firm footing the New York Altunni Association. He kept the college before the world through the columns of the news- paper, and it was by his influence as class presi- dent that the custom of holding decennial reunions was given new life. After practicing law at Elmira for three years he took up his residence in New York. He became counsel for Mr. Elliot F. Shepard and negotiated for him the purchase of the Mail and Express. As secretary and treasurer of the corporation he fan1ilia!'ized himself with every detail of newspaper work and in 1897, in association with Mr. R. E. A. Dorr, the publisher, purchased the Mail and Express. He was active in its manag-ement, and this took up so much of his titne that he could do but very little outside work although he was emi- nently fitted for a leader. He contributed several articles to magazines and was the author of the History of Union College in the Bulletin of the U. S. Bureau of Education. He was a close friend of President McKinley and wrote several influential letters frotn the national capital during the first part of his administration. At the time of his death he was a member of the University, Alpha Delta Phi, Press and St. Anthony's Clubs, the Adirondack League, the Union College Alumni Association, the American Geographical and the American Forestry societies and Phi Beta Kappa. THE FUNERAL. The funeral services of the late Mr. Alexander were held in the University Place Presbyterian Church at New York, Tuesday afternoon. Men of high distinction in many walks of life were preset1t to pay a last tribute to his memory, and the mute tnessage that flowers convey was expressed by wreaths sent by his friends and associates in busi- ness and college life. As the funeral party entered the church, the organ played a funeral march. After the choir had sung the anthem, ''Thy Will Be Done,\ the Rev. Henry Van Dyke, D. D., offered prayer. Reading from the Scriptures and a contralto solo In 1883, three years after his graduation, Mr. Alexander received, in course, the degree of Master of Arts, and in 1890 was elected a life trustee of Union, being up to that time the youngest alumnus ever to receive that honor. He not only took an interest in the college as a whole and ~ followed. The Rev. Dr. A. V. V. Raymond, presi- 'l

6 THE OONCORDIENSIS. dent of Union College, then delivered the following appreciative address: ''He was my dear friend and tny heart is so sore in this hour of loss, that tny place seems to be not here, but among those who are sitting in silence with their grief. Of memories that are precious, and sacred, I would not speak even if I could trust myself to do so, but to tell of the character that disclosed itself in the intercot1rse of many years is a privilege which I cannot forego, as it is a character I would that all knew and honored. And yet I hesitate even in this, fearing lest I tnay be unfaithful to the memory of one who in life shrank from the tributes we &o often longed to offer. It was a part of the charm of his personality, and certainly it was a mark of his nobility, that he sought not praise, that he was unconscious of i.he virtues that won our confidence and love. He could not understand that what was so natural to him could be in any way exceptional or attract the notice or call forth the comments of others, and so now I would not by words of eulogy offend that fine spirit, I would not transgress the bounds which he himself set. And yet I may speak of him, if it be not so .much for his praise as for our good and the praise of his Lord. ''To have known Robert Alexander as I knew him and as tnany here knew him, is to realize how much there is that is above gold. To know him as we knew him is to realize how little a man's power depends upon outward circutnstance. I have asked myself many times during these last few days what it was that so drew us to him and held us. It was not his ability, marked as that was; not his accomplishments, varied as they were ; not even his virtues, so apparent, so persistent. Many men have all these, and yet lack his power, his influence. What was it? His spirit, the indefinable essence of the man, that permeated all that he was and all that he did. It was this spirit that drew us and touched us and made us glad that we knew him. It was this spirit that reaching through intervening distances, made our thought of hin1 wherever we were an inspiration to noble livit1g. ''How can we characterize this spirit? Can we say it was his character? Yes, if we give the largest meaning to that word character. His was not the virtue merely of resisting evil. His integrity was beyond question. It was so 1nuch a matter of course that he would be honest and honorable and just and true that we seldom gave this phase of his life a second thought. Character? Yes, if we recognize the positive, the aggressive element in character; and that, I think, ·which separated our friend and brother from n1any besides who are honorable in life was his spirit of devotion to truth and to righteousness, \This brought him into touch with the world of righteousness and with all those large concerns which belong to the kingdotn of righteousness upon earth. It identified hiln with every great cause which tneans good to humanity and brought hitn into fellowship with the great men of his time, many of whom sought him for counsel and help. He could plan broadly, as he could work persistently. He belonged to the world of large affairs, the world of great causes, because he had the instincts of a statesman, the heart of a patriot and a great capacity for friendship. Men trusted hin1 because they knew he was loyal. What a word that is ! How it describes him, and how it stmnps hin1 with nobility! \We have not said all when we have spoken of his spirit of devotion to truth and to righteousness. There was something more-a kindly spirit, a gentle, helpful spirit. Had it not been so we. would not have loved him as we did. It was an instinct with him to relieve others, even at cost to himself, and so, few of the burdens that he carried were his own. As the years passed, as his interests enlarged, these burdens increased. Was it this that at last crushed him? \He seetned so strong, he was always so willing, we never hesitated to go to hin1 for help. Perhaps we did not realize what virtue had gone out of him whenever we left his presence relieved of our anxiety and with new hope and courage. We did not think that what we left behind he took upon himself. This spirit of kindness and of helpfulness was strong in him even to the end, when his own burden of suffering and of dread foreboding might have well absorbed his thought and energy. Some of the memories that will linger longest in our hearts are metnories of these last days when in physical weakness he still ministered to us. \What a lesson is this for us, my brothers, in view of the self-centered living that makes up so much of the world in which we move ! What is the great end of life? We cannot help but ask that question today. Will any object if I say gratitude, or, to use a larger word, friendship, or a larger word still, love? For what are we striv- ing if not to win something that ·will endure when our hands are empty? And what will endure? Love only is immortal, the gratitude of hun1an hearts. This is the treasure laid up in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, the treas~ ure that is ours when all else fails ! But to win we must serve. To live for others is to live in the1n. ''What is the glory of Christ? The praises of those whom He has redeemed, for whom He lived and died. If we are to share that glory we tnust share on earth His life of ~ervice, of unselfish ·v I , I I ;.

It was the Christ Spirit in Robert Alexandet that won for hin1 his large inheritance of gratitude and love and, as I say this, I feel that he would have me say also that he caught that Spirit as he learned of Christ in the home that gave him to the world, so that, if today praise is to be given to any n1ortal, let it be given to the father and mother who so lived the Christ life that their children could live no other.\ At the close of President Raytnond 's remarks Dr. Van Dyke followed with a prayer and the services closed with the benediction. Atnong the friends of the family at the church were vVilliam Brookfield, Cornelius N. Bliss, ex- Secretary of the Interior; Col. D. C. Robinson of Elmira, Augustus D. Shepard, Edward P. North, Hon. St. Clair Mcl{elway, Judge George L. Ingraham and n1any others. The following trustees of the college were present: Silas B. Brownell, Rev. Dr. William Irvin, Hon. John H. Starin, William H. H.

The Mail and Express employes attended to the number of nearly one hundred, including the full strength of the editorial staff. PRESIDENT RAYMOND'S CHAPEL ADDRESS. When the students reassembled at chapel Wed- nesday morning, President Raymond told them of Mr. Alexander's death and spoke as follows of his life: \In his death Union College lost one of her n1ost loyal sons and the State one of its noblest citizens. Despite his· years, Robert Alexander was the trusted friend and adviser of many of the Nation's great men. Many tributes have been paid him, but I want to add just a word as to his relations with the college. \Mr. Alexander was essentially a Union College man; he honored her past, he believed in her present and he was confident of her future. He was the best-known and best beloved alumnus in the eyes of the undergraduates, and was continu- ally giving his energy to the furtherance of their interests. \As a student, he kept the heritage which he brought with hin1 to college, a clear brain, a pure heart and a quickened conscience, and he easily took the first place in scholarship in his class. In college, as in after life, he had a vigor hard to restrain, yet he never overstepped the bounds. No grad nate of another college ever loved his alma mater more than did Robert Alexander. But this was not a n1ere sentiment. It manifested itself in his tireless devotion. \Not only was he himself a regular attendant at commencement, but he was always influencing others to return. It was he who revived and set on a firm basis the New York Alun1ni Association; it was he who kept the college before the world through the columns of the press; it was through his influence as class president that in 1890 the cust01n of holding decennial class reunions was given new life ; at his own expense he published for many years an alumni l6ulletiu; it was his warm interest in the athletics of the college that was the means of securing the first physical instructor here ; and as the natural result of these and tnany other tnanifestations of his interest he was elected in 1890 a life 1nember of the Board of Trustees. In this duty, as in every other, he was faithful to his trust, faithful even unto death. \Such a life makes its own appeal. God grant that we may live as nobly, as loyally and aR worthily as did Robert Alexander.'' THE BURIAL SERVICE. All college work was suspended at 12 o'clock, and on the arrival of the special car containing the funeral cortege the entire student body and faculty were assembled at the depot. The procession then moved to the cemetery, where the retnains were buried in the Alexander lot, President Raymond officiating. The exercises were brief, but impres- sive. Dr. Raytnond 's words at the grave were as follows: ''To this place, sacred to human sorrow, we bring the body of our beloved friend for burial. Metnories tender and loving throng upon us as we stand around this open grave. His presence meant

8 THE OONOORDIENSIS. tnuch to us all, for his life was large and full and free, rich in friendship, abounding h1 ministries. It will be hard to live without him, and yet it will be easier to live nobly because we knew him. Such a life never ends, even upon earth, for it sur- vives in the lives and institutions that have felt its quickening touch, in the influences set at work that perpetuate th.etnsel ves from generation to gen- eration. '''Why seek ye the living atnong the dead? He is not here. He is risen. ' But his highest tnark of honor in college con1- petitions is in the fact that his own spirit was so great, so generous, so free from all selfish rivalry, that we all felt that we had won when Alexander received a prize. Superior scholatshi p, however, was but a part of that which made hitu the leading n1an of his class. Recognition of his sytupathy with every college interest united with his undoubted literary gifts to 1nake hhu an editor ofT he Concord i- e n sis ; naturally, he became our senior presi- dent. He had a singular con1prehensiveness both of intellect and of affection. Others \vill \As this was said of the Lord of Life, so tnay it be said of all who live in Hiln as He Hitnself taught. 'Because I live ye shall live also.' Let our thoughts then be rather of life than death, and while we cover this tabernacle with the dust to which it must return let us follow the spirit that has been set free for larger service and even now knows the tneaning of its welcome to the eternal world. '' 'Because thou hast been faithful in a few things I will make thee ruler over tnany. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. ' '' HIS UNDERGRADUATE LIFE. The first nan1e on our class-lists during all our college course, was that of Robert C. Alexander. At graduation his was the first nan1e in the list of honor tuen. Frotu that tirne to this, the class of '8o l1as been, in a very unusual sense, ''Alex- ander's class.\ Our first recitation in college was in Professor \Vhitehorne's class, and I remember well how on the first day I adtnired Alexander's calmness as he walked to the appointed place before the stern professor, and the ease with which he read and expounded his . portion of Greek. And all learning seemed to be easy to hitn, unless perhaps it \vere in mathernatics. It was con'ltnonly understood that he considered tnuch study in tnathetnatics to be a weariness to the flesh ; but Greek and Latin were his delight. Probably other n1en in the class studied the classics as n1uch as he did ; perhaps one or two acquired as rnuch classical learning; but I think that no other enteted so fully into th.e spirit of Greek and Rotnan liter- ature, or tnade so fully his own the great inherit- ance of ancient thought. The study of English literature, too, was his constant pleasure, and he was easily first in writing and public speak- ing. I need not speak of the prizes he took; they are a part of the records of the college. . tell of his later life, but I tnay be pern1itted to relate an incident which illustrates this h·ait of his. Last sutntuer, while in the city of Frank- fort, he found in a book-store an early printed copy of a Greek text, bought it, and sent it to a classtnate who was, he knew, interested in classical studies. While fighting what he knew to be a losing fight with a tnortal disease, his tuind was still keen with interest in his old studies, and he retnetnbered that the old book would bring pleasure to his distant friend. And as we have known hitu latel v, so he was in \' college. His mind grasped everything, his heart went out to everybody. And with what tneasure he gave, so was it given to him again. He was, withal, a man of striking physical and moral courage. One night during our freshtuan year son1e upper classtnen fancied that it would be a fine thing to \put the freslunen to bed.\ Arriving at Alexander's roon1, they found it locked and barricaded. Alexander refused to open. Finally the door was battered in, there was a rush to enter, and a sudden halt; Alex- ander and his roon1n1ate appeared in the centre of the rootn with leveled shotguns and words of warning. There was a hasty departure for the stairway, after a titne a cautious return ; nego- tiations followed, a treaty of peace was rnade, and Alexander went to bed at his own time and in his own way. Doubtless Alexander was a hard student ; such scholarship as his does not cotne without labor. But '~the still air of quiet study\ is not a phrase descriptive of his 1uanner of life in the south section of south college. Alexander was ·tr . ~··

fond of fun; perhaps his fun was not always offici ally approved by the faculty of that day, but they all remembered him with re5pect and affection. We tell oyer to one another the storv of his college life ; we tell it with pride, with laughter, with gratitude, with e1notion as we think of the years of co1nradeship now fast receding into the distant past. And we tell it all ; in his college life there was nothing to hide, nothing to cause regret or sorrow.. As he entered college, so he left it, and so he continued to the end, pure in heart, upright in life, unstained by the world's evil. B. H. RIPTON, 'So. DR. ROGERS' TRIBUTE. I have been asked to write son1ething of tny recollections of Robert C. Alexander since we left college, but \Vhat at first seemed an easy task, so full is the tne111ot·y of his Christian character, his genial nature and his firm friendships, proves to be a burden. The sense of personal loss is so keen, the thought that our friend is no more, that never again in this world shall we see him or hear his hearty greeting, itnpresses me so profoundly that the attempt to write of his lasting college friendships and the influence they had upon his life is likely to prove wholly inadequate. Notwithstanding the good natured rivalry which exists between the various classes and the boastful clain1s n1ade by each, no one will gainsay that in thirty years there has been graduated by Union College no man so imbued with loyalty to his alma mater, no man so atnbitious of her welfare, no man who has devoted so much of his own life to her interests as Robert C. Alexander of '80-no man who loved his classmates 1nore or who labored more successfully to maintain a class organization than did he. At the same time there was never a tnan who retained the respect and friendship of his instructors, who has so few enemies,-no, not enetnies for he had none,~who had so few acquaint- ances that did not appreciate his worth and who kept the love of his classmates as did the man known to all the boys as ''Aleck. '' Frotn the date of his graduation he began to perfect our class organization. He corresponded with each tnember, he knew their wives, could call by name their children, and when in1883 he issued a Triennial he not only inaugurated a new era in class organization, but, as always, with the interest of Union at heart, he rekindled in the hearts of his classmates the flickering flame of enthusiasm in the college and its interests. In 1885 he follnwed with another bulletin which recorded the brief history and address of every member of our class but one, a feat never equalled by any other than Alexander. When in '90 we gathered for our Decennial reunion and accepted his hospitality at Lake George where for days we revelled in recollections of college days and reminiscences of boyish pranks, it seemed a culmi- nation of loyalty to '80, yet evidence of his friend- ship did not cease here. In spite of his growing responsibilities, his larger cares, his work for and interest in the college, fron1 the day of his graduation to the day of his death his classtnates were dear to him as brothers. Perhaps none had nl.ore frequent opportunities to enjoy his society than I and there never was a dinner complete which did not include over our cigars a retrospect of the history of the boys of '80. News of each was regaled with as much gusto as any hit of gossip in society. How many titnes in the last nineteen years he has gathered around his hospitable board a lot of classmates would be hard to say. He never seemed so happy as when he was host, and when on Novetnber 7, nine of the class of '80 gathered at dinner, the thoughtful care that placed a vacant chair at the table and laid an extra cover, was but one one manifestation of the sense of irreparable loss we had experienced. Alexander was an enthusiastic fellow. He could not keep quiet, and before grim disease laid its heavy hand upon him nothing seemed to dampen his ardor or restrain his vivacity. No guest of his ever complained of ennui,-they had no time. He was the best correspondent a man ever had. His letters to his friends were brimful of humor and sprightliness and I am greatly impressed by the fact that so many of us have treasured his letters for years. One of our class tells me that he has every letter ever received from him. Three years ago I had the pleasure of entertain- ing him at my home and of paying an election bet made at Lake George in 1895, and I violate no confidence in quoting fr01n a letter received after his return to New York. \Vhen we consider that at that time he had just learned that he was afflicted with an incurable disease and that a certain depression tnight be natural, his letter, so like himself, shows no trace of ought than a desire to make a pleasant return for hospitality. * * * * \vVe arrived home safely at eleven o'clock and before the midnight hour were safe in bed. Tonight we had corned beef and cabbage and it seemed like coming down with a thump fron1 the diet of snails and terrapin and grouse with which we had so recently been regaled. It was a noble gorge, a repast which eplcures would have

However, when yol!l come to New York we will g-ive you_ some :fine corned beef and cabbage. \It was a pleasure to us to visit you in your roomy home and the pleasure will be completed when we have a chance to 1nake you at horne in ours.

No one who knew Alexander can fail to see h.is generous nature in this letter ,-it is characteristic of the best friend that any '80 tnan ever had. It is not idle talk, no mere platitude or convertti()n when I say that no n1an could 'know Bob Alexander and fail to be a better man. liis life, so short, has not been in vain. The remembrance of his frien.d- ship, the recollection of his virtaes and the memory of his life work will be incentives to all of us. No man had a better friend and it is a source of g-reat personal gratification to 1ne tl1at I have a son who bears his na1ne, and I can wish for no greater happiness and hope for him no greater success than that he may be like our beloved friend and c1 ass- lnate Robert C. Alexander. F. T. ROGERS, '80, M. D.' 117 Broad Street, Nov. 10, 1899. Providence, R. I. WILLIAM H. MCELROY'S TRIBUTE. (FROM THE MAIL AND EXPitESS.] Writing of the passing away of the young English poet, Arthur Hugh Clough, Mr. Charles Eliot Nortonbore witness, that \to vvin such love as he won in life, to leave behind so dear a metnory as he left, is a lot that falls to few mor- tals; he was loved by friends whose affection is better than f~une and who in losing him have 1net with an irreparable loss.\ Those who knew Robert C. Alexander will find in these significant sentences a eulogy which his character tnight l1ave inspired. The metnory he has left will ever be fragrant itl the hearts of his friends. They will find joy in recalling his strong, sitnple unsullied nattn·e, his forceful brain, his tender heart and rare unselfishness., his pron1pt and generous t~espon se to all the claims of friendship, his instinctive hatred of evil in any of its n1anifestations, his resolute championship of whatever things are pure, lovely and of good report. Thus to portray hitn is to suggest what man- ner of man he was, but still the irresistible chann of his personality eludes the pen. In him strength and sweetness of character were exquisitely blended. He was practical without being narrow. He had to a ret;narkable degree the courage of his convictions and yet no one could have been n1ore free from dogrnatism. He was a sagacious and successful man of affairs, pron1inent in n1any activities; although but a stalwart fighter in the battle of life, he :kept hitnself unspotted from the world.

CLAIR MC KELWAY'S TRIBUTE. [Ii'ROM TJIE BROOKLYN E.AGJJE,j \Robert C. Alexander was conscientious, earnest and cultivated. He did not have a fair chance fully to indicate his decided abilities as a WTiter or thinker on public questions, for his best powers were absorbed by the business requirements of the paper. Those who k11ew him well loved hin1 1nuch. He was very attractive in manner and in character, refined in taste, religious in life, and faithful to duties and to friendships. The Mail and Express staff and constituency will sadly miss him. The altnnni of Union Uni- versity have lost in hhn one of the most devoted supporters of their educationaltnother. The work of newspaper making is deprived by his death of a tnan who brought to it right ideals and who did not deviate fron1 them. His fan1ily and kindred and his associates in service will have the sincere sympathy of their friends in the sorrow that has cmne to them. For him sorrow need not be felt, for recovery was impossible and release from pain and weakness was far better.\ ' . ·, '· ~ ·~ ' ~· ' l ( l .,

'' Today all that was tnoral of Robert C. Alexander, the late editor of The Mail and Express, was laid to rest in God's acre, near the college fron1 which he was graduated and for whose welfare he labored so faithfully. His body reposes bestde the fon1:1 of his little child, whose spirit preceded and beckoned him to the better land. It is exquisitely :fit that this should be so ; that having dropped the things of time he should sleep his last sleep with n1uch com- panionship. ' Except ye become as a little child ye cannot enter the kingdotn'-that is the supreme test. President Ra ytnond of Union College, Mr. Alexander's lifelong friend, in the tender, discritninating tribute which yesterday he paid to his tnemory, testified out of a full heart, as all testify who knew him, that in character and achievement, in what he wus and what he did, he was essentially a child in what- ever the term implies of stainless purity, artless goodness and sympathetic harn1ony \vith the Divine life. In bidding hitn fond farewell we have the cotnforting consciousness that his tnetnory-a constant incentive to good living- shall grow greener with the years.

His gentle yet for-ceful character, his kindly and modest manner, his unselfish fidelity to friendships, made for him a permanent place in the hearts of his fellow workers, and to them the memory of his personality must ever be an inspir- ation for the highest ideals of the profession in which he labored so earnestly and so well. It was pre-eminently true of Robert C. Alexander that ''None knew hitn but to love him, None named him but to praise. '' As an officer and a tnen\lber of this board his counsels were always wise and safe, his judgment just, and to his work as editor of the Mail and Express he brought unusual capacity, conscientious devotion to truth and justice, sterling patriotism and an intuitive sense of the right. For these high purposes he steadfastly contended, having no cause to serve but that of his country and his fellow men. He labored that he n1ight do good for . others when he imperatively needed rest, and thus gave proof of the nobility of his character and the sympathetic impulses of his heart. More than · friend and colleague his loss is immeasurable. ROBERT E. A. DORR, HENRY L. STODDARD, President. Secretary. FACULTY RESOLUTIONS. At a tneeting of the faculty of Union College held on Monday, Novetuber 6, 1899, a con1- tnittee of five was appointed to draw up and publish the following resolution: We have learned with deep regret of the death of Robert C. Alexander, a trustee of the college and an alutnnus of the class of I88o. The blow con1es to us with special force, in view of his great usefulness to the college during a period of nearly twenty years, when his ability as a man of affairs and his active interest in everything that was taking place on College Hill rendered his services peculiarly valuable. As an alutnnus he -vvas sincerely loyal; as a scholar he tnade good use of his acquiretnents for the benefit of his alrna tnatet·; and as a nwn he was an exatnple of that high character which is a source of strength to all who feel its influence. Our deepest and truest syrnpathy is extended to all his fan1ily. But to Mrs. Alexander in particular, we desire to express our appreciation of her husband's tnerits, and of the Joss that vve have sustained in comtnon with herself; and to his brother the Rev. George Alexander, -vvhose services to the college and sincere friendship for all connected with it are not to be 1neasured in words, we vvish no less to convey our sytnpathy and to declare our deep sense of his sad bereave- ment. Signed by the Con1mittee, MAURICE PERKINS, HENRY \VHITEHORNE, WILLIAM WELLS, BENJAMIN H. RIPTON, SIDNEY G. ASHMORE.

The earth has claimed its own, but the me1nory of Robert C. Alexander will ever live. ON SATURDAY the football season ca111.e to a suc- cessful close. But while in the ma1n successful, there were at least two causes which make it in part an unsatisfactory ending. We refer to the Sweetland incident and to the n1atter of the referee. The former has been so grossly exaggerated in at least three newspapers that a word of e.:xplanation is necessary. Several times dut·ing the first half lVIr. Sweetland was on the field near his team when the ball was in play. This he well knew was contrary to rules, for he was ordered by the officials to stay within the side lines. Mr. Sweet- land, though warned, deliberately persisted in dis- obeying orders, and it was when in consultation with a Hamilton player at the critical n~on1ent of the game that he was removed. It it 11ot true that he was ejected by students, and caned as well. There was not a cane on the field and Nr. Sweet- land was removed by a police officer acting under orders of the management. His mackintosh was not torn, nor was it stolen. These are the facts and they can be backed up with proof. The newspapers in question tnade much of the fact that the last ten minutes of play was in dark- ness. Very well, but who was responsible for this? Here is the explanation. On the Monday preceding the game the Hamilton management wrote to Manager MacCulloch informing him that according to custom they desired the name of our official in advance. The letter also called atten- tion to the fact that by the rules no one connected with either college should officiate. On Thursday Hamilton received MacCulloch 's letter nan1in~ our official, but they neglected in turn to send theirs, appearing in person on Saturday with their official, an alutnnus ~d ip§tpi'll!ltor at Hamilton. Captain Fenton, of course, protested but Hamilton refused to play under any other consideration. This it was that caused the delay, and it is only to be regretted that Fenton did not hold to his point, for such a sorry exhibition of refereeing has never been seen here and will, we hope, never be repeated. Union has always endeavored to act according to the rules, and expects her opponents to do likewise. We cotnn1end the investigation already begun by the student body. FOOTBALL SCORES.

Lack of space prevents an extended account of an interesting address delivered in the chapel at the vesper service Sunday afternoon by the Rev. Mr. Conrad of the First Baptist Church of this city. \Bill\ Stnith of Columbia Law School, cap- tain of last year's foot ball teatn, was on the hill the latter part of last week assisting Prof. Pollard in coaching the 'varsity for the Hamil- ton gatne. He was given a rousing reception in front of North College Thursday morning. The whole college greeted hin1 and incidentally bolted part of the first hour recitations.

THE CONCORDIENSlS. 13 A TIE GAME. Neither Side Scores in the Sea- son's Last Contest With Hamilton. Perhaps as fierce a contest as Old Union's carnpus has ever known, last Saturday afternoon kept a crowd of about three hundred students and townspeople in constant excitement; n1ade them forget their wet feet, the chills creeping up their backs and the rain drizzling on their heads; and brought thetn to the very bubbling over point of enthusiasm. It was a struggle gallant enough to rnake a tnan's blood boil and wish hitnself in the very thick of the contest. Hatnilton, confident of success and having tnany reasons to believe victory would be hers, was held down, her strength broken, ane saved frotn defeat by the shortening of the titne. Aided and encouraged by the efficient coach- ing of\ Bill \ Stnith, two days previous to the game, the Garnet warriors exhibited the best style of play they had shown throughout the season. Every tnan on the eleven played a strong, steady and consistent game, and every tnan deserves the highest kind .of praise. Car- ver played a wonderful game, alway~ smashing the Buff and Blue's line for good .gains anu breaking up interference and tackling in a beautiful manner. Paige bucked and tackled splendidly, '\Vhile \i\t\' eed handled the ball and chose his plays with coolness and dexterity. The line, to a man, dropped under and held back the plays like a stone wall. Finnegan, in particular, though badly crippled, played a strong gatne in his position. Hatnilton's representatives gave a dashing exl1ibition of football. They were outgeneralled however, for the Garnet had planned for a kick- ing game in the first half. The bait was seized upon and the Clintonites began to loose strength in the second, while their opponents were still fresh. The first half was tnainly in Hatnitton's favor, but the odds changed considerably in the second. Approaching darkness~ with nine 111in utes still to play, determined the officials to have no titne from then on counted out. This decision shortened the second half by at least six minutes. For Hatnilton, Ward, at right guard, gave Bryan a good deal to take care of. Her tackles, Lake and Howell, with good interference tnade several fine runs, while little Mason proved himN self a very slippery personage. Peet, too was fast on his feet, and several brilliant runs are credited to him. Keogh, Union's last year's full back, formerly a Law School tnan, played the san1e position on the Clinton eleven. His defensive play was good but when on the aggressive he bucked with little effect. Several tin1es, when called upon to kick, he fun1bled on an easy catch. There was but one incident that marred the good feeling of the afternoon. It was caused in considerable tneasure by the excited nature of the crowd that becan1e provoked by the uncalled for actions of Hamilton's coach. A tninute or two before titne was called, Mr. Sweetland was brought in to the side lines. Notwithstand- ing the fact that coaches Pollard and Stnith refrained fron1 going upon the field except at the sound of the whistle, Mr. Sweetland was several titnes by his tnen when the ball was in play. On this particular occasion, he went upon the field when the ball was in play and g·ave advice to his men. It was not true that the crowd surged upon the field in the second half. While past the ropes, everyone was kept behind the side lines except in this instance. This fact is stated inasmuch as a Sunday Albany paper contained a particularly false and garbled account of it. Paige started the garne by kicking to the thirty yard line, where the Hatnilton man was downed in his tracks. Mason and Stowell, by gains between Shaw and Carver, carried the ball to the center of the field. Keogh fun1bled on an attempt to kick and it was the Garnet's ball on downs. Carver punted to Han1ilton's thirty-five yard line and on the next play Union secured the pigskin on a ftnnble. Fenton and Paige tnade five yards apiece. \Biddy\ tried a place kick for goal but owing in pai·t to a slippery ball 111issed his mark by several yards. Peet picked up the ball and advanced it to Hamilton's fifteen yard line. Lake, Mason and Stowell, by the hardest kind of plunging about the tackles brought the ball to within six yards of Union's goal line but Captain Fenton's 1nen n1.ade a detern1ined stand and held the Clinton- ites for downs. Carver punted to Union's thirty- five yard line and a fun1ble gave it to the hon1e eleven again. At this juncture Bryan t\visted his knee badly but in the face of these odds pluckily played on and continued his brilliant game. Carver punted to Hamilton's forty yard line and, as before, Union gained the ball on a futnble. Three successive titnes Finnegan threw high to Carver for a punt and Union lost ground to her twenty yard line. Carver then kicked, Peet caught and stnashed ahead to lJnion's twenty-five yard line. Stowell and Lake

U~IO~· ·Co· L· LE·G·E B·ooK S·T· o·~E At this po1nt tune was called. . . . . • . . • . After Keogh's kick off in the second half, · · 1 Union quickly forced her \Vay to the centre of the field where a futnble gave Hatnilton posses- sion of the ball. Two gains of five yards and a pretty run by Mason around Union's right end brought the pigskin to the ten yard line in the northwest corner of the field. l{eogh lost five yards on a fumble and then tried without suc- cess to kick a goal. A touchback was the result. Carver had a fine punt at the twenty- five yard line and Peet got the ball as far as the center of the field. Mason tnade fifteen yards through the right of Union's line. The ball at this point changed hands four titnes, twice on downs and twice on a futnble. Peet tnade thirty yards around Thebo on a double pass. Keogh's attetnpt to kick \Vas blocked and the ball came into the Garnet's possession. Union was given ten yards on ofiside play and frotn this time on her three backs, Carver especially, gave a beautiful exhibition of line bucking. The line men opened up the holes well and Harnil- ton was forced to give way as far as her fifteen yard line. IIamilton stood firm for downs, but Keogh's forced kick 'vas blocked and the half ended with the ball in Union's possession but seven yards frotn her opponents' goal line. At the conclusion of the gatne the enthusiastn knew no bounds. The chapel bell was rung and in the tnidst of cheers Coach '' Bill\ Sn1ith and Captain Fenton vvere carried around the campus on the shoulders of the crowd. Shortly after the gan1e the n1ernber.s of the teatn met and elected John P. Carver captain for next year. 1'he choice was a unanitnous one and everyone recognizes in \ Pat \ just the n1an for the place. T'he line-up and summary follovvs: HAMILTON. POSITION. UNION.

: . THE CONOORDIENSIS. SCRUB vs. GENERAL ELECTRlCS. The third and last game of the series betvvecn the General Electric tean1 and the second eleven was played on the can1pus election day and one of the largest crowds of the season was present. In the fir~t half the scrub played better football than teeir opponents, but were unable to score. In the second half the General Electrics gingered uP. and crossed the line after a series of steady gatns. The locals kicked off and the scrub forced the ball down to their enemies' thn~e yard line \Vhere, on a futnble, a Union man dropped on the ball behind the line. But ·the play was decided a touchback and so counted nothing. No tnore scoring was done the first half and when titne was called the ball was in the hands of the second eleven. In the second half the General Electrics pushed the ball by steady center and end plays to the scrub's ten yard line and after forced the ball· over the line. Eisen- menger failed to kick a goal.

A neview of the Year's Work With Son1e of its Lessons. With the Hatnilton gatne on Novetnber the eleventh, the Union College football season catne to a close. The finish was a satisfactory one, inasrnuch as the defeats earlier in the fall were considerably atoned for by the excellent showing against the BuH' and Blue. The 'varsity record is far from being brilliant, yet it is from every standpoililt a creditable one .. One victory, one tie game, and five defeats is the way it stands. At the beginning of the season many obstacles presented thetnselves to those in charge. 'Vith Sn1ith, Price, Gulnac, Mallery, Keogh and Willis n1issing at the :first roll call in Septetnber the prospects were cet-tainly not of the brightest. Every n1an behind the I ine was gone and how to fill the places was a question that gave Coach Pollard and Captain Fenton much uneasiness. In but a short time the uncertainty was retnoved in regard to the vacancy at full back. Paige was selected and that he n1ore than fulfilled every expectation is no exaggeration. Paige had played end for one gatne on ''Bill\ Stnith's eleven and had been forced to retire the rest of the season by reason of a badly twisted knee. His retire1nent did not appear to trouble hin1 this year, for he played throughout the season with a virn and dash rarely seen in 1nen of his age. Gordon, a freshrnan, and Slack were the half backs duTing tl1e greater part of the season. Gordon sho,ved hin1self to be a good line bucker but failed to get into defensive play as much as could be desired. Slack: was not fast enough and after the Wesleyan game Carver was called back ii·otn right end to take his place at right half, still retaining right end on the defensive-, however. ,.l'he move proved an excellent one. The brilliant game he had been playing through- out the season was more than etnphasized in the contest with Hatnilton when the spectators were enthused over his retnarkable exhibition of strength and endurance coupled with skill. Weed, who was 'varsity end two years ago, filled the quarter back's position with consider- able skill and good judgtnent. At full on the defensive he rarely failed to strike his man. On the whole, the problen1 of the half backs was the hardest to solve. The selection of line tnen was Ina de with 1nuch less difficulty. Throughout the season, opposing elevens found line bucking against the Garnet of little success. In this part of the eleven Bryan, from the Law School, was undoubtedly the strongest man. There are few tricks of football that he does not know and he used every one of thetn with seldotn failing suc- cess. A ntunber of blocked kicks are placed to his credit. Bryan is the only real 'varsity cripple of the season. He now is confined in bed with a very bad knee. Finnegan played an excellent gatne at center, handling both tl1e ball and the tnan opposite hin1 in splendid style. Shaw suffered from a weak back most of the season but got into the plays with a great deal of success. Right guard Collier, a freshtnan, exhibited many signs of the good tnaterial in hitn. Another season will greatly improve his usefulness. Thebo, during the first three quarters of the season, failed to come up to the expectations of those who saw his brilliant game last year, but a decided in1provernent in fonn was noticed in hitn in the last two gatnes. Clark and Dunning at right end both showed good signs of what may be expected from them next year; and Bolles should do good work in the line in the cotning season. To Andrew C. Fenton, the captai» of the Garnet, tnuch praise is due not only for his

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. earnest, always reliable p1ay, but also for the conscientious exatnple he set and for the efficient manner in which he handled the men under him. Union's strongest point this year was in buck- ing the line, while her weakest was on defensive plays outside of the tackles. The half backs are n1ore to blan1e for this than anyone else. One of the n1ost encouraging signs of the sea- son is the good scrub which was out upon the catnpus every afternoon that the 'varsity wished , practice. The best tnaterial at hand sotnetin1es neglected to cotne out, yet there always was an eleven of fairly good men to be relied upon. In fanner years it was often necessary to go with- out a scrub on account of a lack of men enthusiastic enough to be knocked about by the big men on the 'varsity, but this year college spirit was not behind hand and exhibited itself in a practical manner. Three gan1es between the scrub and the General Electric eleven were fought out with varying success. Anderson, r9oo, captained the scrub throughout the season in a very efficient n1anner. Football material has also been developed in another way. Exciting and closely fought inter- class gatnes have brought several future heroes of the gridiron frotn their retreat in titnidity. As by being buffeted about, one learns how to take hard knocks, so by experience one comes to understand n1uch better what is best to do in the future. There are many lessons of the sea- son which cannot afford to be passed over. Individual defects ; lack of knowledge as to what to do on the defensive ; the failure at suc- cessful end plays ; the lack of well executed trick plays,-all these faults point to one spot and to one need of the future. The eleven for three successive years has been coached by as earnest a tnan as ever stood upon the gridiron. He has not coached with any tnercenary end in view for there has been none, but has gone out on the field in the spirit of pure enthusiasm and with love alone for the college of his adoption and practised in the newer styles of football play. 1'i1e wish is not to relegate Mr. Pollard to the background but to secure another 111an, capable and efficient, to co-operate with him in the building up .of the eleven which John P. Carver is to captain. A well defined moven1ent is already on foot to secure such a result and will be actively broached on the advent of the winter tenn. It has been considered that the students are doing all that can be expected (rom them when they pay seven hundred dollars for football expenses and consequently the following scheme is .advanced. It is thought that one hundred alun1ni can be secured who will pledge five dollars apiece for three consecutive years-the 1110 ney to be devoted in part or wholly to the payment of the salary of a new coach. It has already tnet with tnuch enthusiasm. Three loyal '98 men are the starters of the fund and expect to enlist with thetn several others of the younger alutnni. THE SEASON'S SCORES. Sept. 30. R. P.

Last Friday afternoon Manager Weed of the freshtnan football !earn received a telegram frotn the Troy Acadetny manager who desired a gatne at Troy the next day. At first it was thought irnpracticable to go to Troy or anywhere else, for the best part of the freshman team were to go to An1sterdan1 with the scrub. However, eleven men were hurriedly gathered, and the aggregation went over to Troy, where the Academy boys defeated the unwary frosh by a score of seventeen to notl1ing. The gatne was practically won by Smith, Troy's fleet half back, who eluded the Union tackles and outran every one upon the field. The whole gan1e seemed to depend on which side had the ball. When the freshmen were on the offensive, large holes and steady gains were n1ade until a furnble or offside play gave the ball to the Trojans. Then the pigskin would be given to Stnith, who would protnptly tnake a long run about the fresl11nen's left end. Gordon, while bucking the line, sprained his ankle badly. The line up : FRESHMEN.

After a fierce and pro~onged series of delay Wednesday afternoon, in which the contestants were so evenly matched that it looked as if an outco1ne would never be reached, play betw,een . the Sophs and Frosh was finally begun in a drizzling rain on a slippery field. Wells kicked off to Griffith, and then followed the sensational run of the day. Dodging one man, tearing loose fro1n another and wrenching hi1nself free from a third, the stalwart player sped down the field for a touchdown pursued by both teams. Woolworth completed the good work by kicking a goal. On the next kick off the So phs were 1 ess lucky, and after trying the other line in several places and making no gains, punted to Garret- son who n1ade a pretty run of thirty yards. Good runs were n1ade by Wells, Hoxie and Garretson in this half, and the freshman line held so well that the Sophs were forced to punt very frequently. When titue was called, the ball was in the possession of the freshn1en, four yards frotn the sophotnore's ~oal. In the second half V\; oohvortl1 kicked to GaJ·- retson, who advanced the pigskin ten yards and on the next play t\iventy 1nore. The ball was carried up the field by steady gains mostly through the Sophs line, but the Frosh finally lost it on downs. Then Raytnond by several long runs, and SnHtll by steady gains, advanced it to within IO yards of the goal. 1\he ball changed hands several times but when time was called the Sophs had it seven yards from the line.

8 THE CONOORD!ENSIS~ LECTUQE ON SHAKESPEA~E. The college chapel was crowded last Friday night by an audience which had gathered to hear Williatn H. Flemtning's lecture on Shakespeare. 1 Mr. Flemming is Secretary of the Shakespeare club of New York, and has edited a number of · the great author's plays, so that he was well qualified to treat that interesting subject. His remarks were illustrated with stereopticon views wl1ich added interest to his words. Among the pictures thrown on the screen \\\'\ere the Dros- chout print of Shakespeare, Ann Hathaway's cottage, and interior views of his home and of the theatre in which he played. The lecturer began by tracing the life of the great poet frotn the earliest authentic records of his baptistn., to his death, and spoke at length on his theatrical and dratnatic life. He said that there were many conjectures and myths as to his early environtnents but that they deserve little credence. Mr. Flemtning next spoke .of the state of the nation as regards literature, politics, religion, as well as the condition of the stage, at the time when the great writer was born. Forceful arguments were used to refute the idea of some that Shakespeare was illiterate and coarse. The lecturer also refuted the argument that Bacon wrote the plays, declaring that no great play has ever been written by anyone not skilled in stage-craft. Shakespeare cotn bined genius, inspiration and craftstnanship. Further Mr. Flemming said that rightly to study Shakes- peare we should take up his works in the order in which they were written. To this end they may be divided into four classes which repre- sent the stages in the developtnent of his genius. The first division includes the works frotn 1588 to 1594, frotn Titus Andronieus to Richard III. ; the second frotn r 505 to I 6or consisting rnostly of comedies; the third fron1 r6or to r6o8 repre- senting the maturity of his genius, and the fourth in which the itnaginative element reaches its height in the Ten1pest. In conclusion Mr. Fletnming quoted the following frotn the Tem- pest: \These our actors, as I foretold you, were all spirits and are melted into air, into thin air : and, like the baseless fabric of this vision, the cloud capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples., the great globe itself, yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve and, like this substantial pageant faded, leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff as dreams are tnade on and our little life is rounded with .a sleep.\ SC:QUB vs. AMSTERDAM. The scrub team was defeated Saturday by the Atnsterdam local football eleven by a score of six to nothing. The Atnsterdam team failed to make its appearance on the field until after four o'clock and, in consequence, the gatne had to be called in the early part of the second half by reason of the arrival of darkness. Z. L. Myers, Union's crack half back in '96, the coach of the Amsterdan1 eleven, officiated for his side. He tnade a nutnber of questionable decisions, twice taking the ball from the scrub when the local goal was in danger. The first half was called with the ball in the scrub's possession on the opposing men's five yard line. Atnsterdam's score was tnade thirteen minutes after the first kick off by tneans of dashes about the tackles, Phillips and Osgood proving themselves fast on their feet. A considerable atnount of slugging was indulged in by the winning eleven under cover of the darkness. The second eleven held well on the line plays and when the ball was in its possession bucked for constant gains. The line up is omitted through lack of space. FOOTBALL SCHEDULES.

THE OONCORDIENSIS. ILLUSTQATED LECTUQE. Mr.. Walter B. Snow, on \Heating and Ventilating.'' Thursday afternoon Mr. Walter B. Snow, of Boston, gave an interesting illustrated lecture · on '' Heating and Ventilation.\ Mr. Snow lectured here last year, so his ability is well known in the college and he had a good audience. I-Iis first chart showed the proportion between the loss of heat and the thickness of the walls, for of course this is an important factor in heat- ing large buildings. The fan system of ventila- tion is tnuch better than direct discharge because as the revolutions increase the velocity is increased twice, the pressure four times, and the horse-power eight. Air is a vehicle of heat and the coils are the most conunon and compact way of transmitting it. The heating surface is the essential point and the best result can be obtained by the coils. As the depth of the heater is lessened there is a loss in heating surface but a gain in velocity. In factories there is usually a greater detnand for heat than for ventilation, so the fans draw their supply ft·om the space to be heated, thus saving tnuch heat by using the air over and over again. The best tnethod is to have the heater at the center of the building and pipes, under the floor or overhead, carrying the hot air around the walls and discharging it downwards at head-level. Son1etitnes the air can be discharged with great velocity frotn one side so that there is no need of conductors. In round-houses and siinilar buildings different n1ethods are used, and interesting views were exhibited illustrating the various tnodes. In churches, theatres and halls there is as great a need of ventilation as of heating, but still there must be no draught. The tnost appro\.red n1ethod, that of the Castle Garden Theatre of Boston, is to have the heat carried I throughout the building and distributed under each chair, ab well as in the lobbies and ante- l·ootns. Hot and cold air are sent through a 1nixing datnper so that but one set of flues are necessary. By using a fan the velocity and tetnperature can be more easily controlled and the humidity can be greatly increased if it is desired by throw- ing spray into the hot air. The lecturer presented many tables which on explanation proved mathetnatically the advan- tages of the various systems advocated. These were of course of interest n1ainly to the students in the engineering courses, but the lecture proper was listened to by tnany not from a technical standpoint. FOOTBALL SCO~ES.

EVERYONE is glad to see the enlarged choir in chapel; and a marked improvement in the singing at chapel service is already a manifest result. But we would suggest, in line with this, tl1at one or two substitute pianists be arranged for. There are plenty of men in college who have the ability, and one of these could fill the place of the regular incumbent in case of his absence. AFTER THE paper went to press last week, an error in an editorial was discovered. The state- ment had been made that Referee Dudley of the Union-Hamilton game was a professor at Hamil- ton. This was found to be untrue and so, to avoid any semblance of unfairness, the words \and instructor\ were erased in every copy of the paper sent out. The Concordiensis takes this oppor- tunity to officially correct the error. THE NEED of ushers at chapel lectures was never morenoticeablethan at Mr. Fleming's lecture. S01ne time before the hour set for the lecture, the lights were turned off and the first picture thrown upon the screen. Those who arrived after this change not only did not have the benefit of a light on the outside of the building but on arriving within found the room comparatively dark and the seats in the body of the chapel occupied. There was no one to show the visitors seats and they were left to find them as best they could. We hope that this condition of afiairs will not occur again, and take this means of calling the attention of the proper authorities to it. As WE GO to press the Hamilton Life of Nov. 18 con1es to us. It is our opinion that its effusive, and rather puerile treatment of the Hamilton- Union game ill becomes the dignity of the institution that it represents. We notice that in the midst of investigations at both colleges, one is filling the press with vituperative attacks, while the other maintains a dignified silence pending the result of the investigation. If the charges of Hamil ton are not substantiated before the joint committee of the two colleges, the editors will be somewhat at a loss to explain words like the following: ''And if unable to evolve from your consciousness a pattern of gentlemanliness, an ideal of conduct, come to Hamil ton where cleanliness is a cardinal principle. '' WE CLIP from Sunday's New York Tribune the following, under the head, \Unsportsmanlike Coaching.\ \An extremely disagreeable feature of the Cor- nell-Lafayette contest, and, in fact, the only unpleasant point of the afternoon, was the tactics of Coach Hamilton, who, it was credibly reported, repeatedly coached his men, not only from the side line, but even rushed out on the field occasionally. Foster Sanford, Columbia's coach, was an offender in this same way in the Yale game a few weeks ago, and in the Union-Hamilton game, on Novetn- ber 11, it was declared that Sweetland, au old Cornell man and Hamilton's coach, had to be hustled off the field by Union, his actions were so offensive. It is worth while tnaking note of these instances, for the only way to eradicate similar

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 1i offences is to have aii the facts made public and to have football enthusiasts appreciate just what this side line coaching n1eans. ; ' ln so far as the Union-Hamilton game is cotl- cerned, we can assure the writer of the above, that the course he suggests is the one Union proposes to follow out. OwiNG TO the quantity of material handed in for last week's metnorial issue, much matter had to be held over to this week's number. This fact will also explain the non-appearance last week of considerable tnatter which under ordinary con- ditions would have found a place in the paper. In this connection the editors would like to say that up to the present time, athletics have been of such paramount interest that we have given special prmninence to that branch of college life. There is, of course, a limit to the space allowed us weekly, although the business manager is giving us tnore than nineteen columns as against the ten col tnnns allowed last year; and accordingly as the space given to football was increased, some other department has had to suffer proportionally. This has been the literary side of the publication, but after this number the editors intend that no one side of undergraduate life will be neglected to the gain of another. We hope this explanation will be satisfactory to the many students who, during the tern1, have contributed in one way or another to the literary side of The Concord iensi s. In case a Mss. is rejected, if its importance warrants, it will be returned to the author, together with suitable criticism. This is our regular rule, and if it has not been strictly lived up to thus far this term, the editors would call attention to the fact that up to December 1, there will have been no literary editor of the publication, and consequently the worl{ of that department has had to be attended to by the other members of the staff, each of whom has a fair share of work in looking after his own department. At Cornell University 6r 2 new students have matriculated. This is an increase of I 18 over last year.. BIBLE .STUDY IN THE Y. M. C. A. The officers in the Y. M. C. A., and especially the cotnm ittee having the tnatter in charge, at·e much pleased with the way in which the tnen have taken hold of the work of the class in Bible study. There seems to be considerable ;enthusi- asm among the students in regard to this matter, and the project, although practically a new departure in our association, bids fair to be a very successful one. Surely the place to acquire a habit of systematic and careful Bible study is the college; the place where a man has ,corne to develop himself and form habits of systematic work in all lines to fit hirr1self for future useful- ness in the world. He fonns the habit of \vork here which will cling to hitn throughout his life. The study of the Book of books should be one of the habits so fanned. Graduates uniformlv J testify that students make a great rnistake when they neglect this branch, fancying that they will be afforded better opportunities for pur- suing it in business or comtnercial life. A knowledge of the Bible is a necessary part of a well rounded education. One cannot call bitn- self educated unless he has such a know ledge. The place to acquire it, or to forn1 the habit of study which will place one in the way or acquir- ing it, is here. It is hoped that many more of the men will take advantage of the opportunity now offered. The class, as it wa~ organized this fall, is under the leadership of Prof. Frank S. Hoffman. The meetings are held each Thursday evening from seven to seven-forty. The attendance is good and the men take an active interest. It is needless to say that Prof. Hofftnan is interesting and earnestly devoted to n1aking the meetings a success. The course is that outlined hy the International Committee of the Young Men's Christian Association. The books used are Sharman's \Studies in the Life of Christ\ based on the \Harmony of the Gospels'' by Stevens and Burton. The great design of the work is to give each man a chance to do personal study, and the object of the leader is merely to direct, in a careful and intelligent way, the thought brought out by the study. The n1eeting thus supplements and con1pletes the work of the individual.

12 THE OONCORDIENSIS. THE UNIVERSITY.· The social league of the En1anuel Baptist Church of Albany gave a reception to the stu- dents recently. There was a large attendance from the Law School, Medical College and College of Pharn1acy. The Rev. Dr. But- trick tnade an address of ~ 7 elcotne to the guests, to which E. G. Galusha of the Law School responded. AI .. BANY MEDICAL COLLEGE.

' .......... .._ UNION AT THE TQUAX BENEFIT CONCE~T. The benefit given Miss Louise Truax in the VanCurler, Friday evening, Nov. 17, was a pronounced success in every respect. AU the selections were rendered exceptionally well, and in a way which attested thorough preparation on the part of the actors. The program opened with a selection by the orchestra after which the Union College Glee Club sang the \Union Marching Song.\ For an encore they sang the \Union Drinking Song.\ It was the first public appearance of the Glee Club this year, and the enthusiastic way in which both selections were received by the audience should be an incentive to still greater energies on the part of the metnbers of the club. · John H. Cook, 1901, pleased the audience with several impersonations and recitations. All the other nutnbers V\rere heartily applauded and many encores given. Much credit for the fine entertaintnent must be given to the tnany ladies of the city who worked so hard for its success. CAMPUS CHAT. A Variety of Topics Gathered on the Hill. Dunham, 1900, has recovered fi·om a week's illness. Bishop, 1903, entertained his tnother for a few days last week. H. B. Jones, 1900, is spending a week in New York City. Finnegan, 1902, and Acheson; 1903, spent Saturday in New York. President Raymond addressed the Y. M. C. A. tneeting last week Tuesday evening. Walter vV. Clark and J.

His eye was bunged out and his arm in a sling, And he walked with a cane-he was lame; And his swollen up nose was a pitiful thing; He'd a tooth broken out, and his back had no spring, He was happy for. all, just the satne. Broken teeth, broken arms, broken nose, broken head, Tho' bruised up for life he appear- He looked up and grinned, as he cheerfully said, \Now patch up my body, then bandage my head, I '11 be ready for football next year.''

There has probably been no man in An1eri:can history,. who has at the satne titne excited so much adrniration and censure, who has been hailed with joy and shunned with fear by such great audiences and so vast a reading public, as Robert G. Ingersoll. l-Ie \Vas certainly a tnan of wonderful powers, a man who by the force of his argutnents and keen satire could sway his hearers as he chose. Yet in spite of all his popularity, in spite of the vast and applauding audiences, which so eagerly listened to his oratorical flights against the Christian religion, he has left no real and lasting influence upon the religious thought of Atnerica. It is true that tnultitudes have l1eard his keen satire and scathing ridicule, have believed and applauded, and continued in their lives of sin and degrada- tion. I say continued, for the greater part of his audiences have been persons seeking an excuse and justification for their imrnoral lives; though curiosity has led thousands to taste, a'Qd sotne few to swallow and die from the fie1·y flood of his eloquence. Yet the mighty river of Christianity rolls on and the influence of Inger- soll is but a straw, which, borne onward by the swift waves vvill soon be lost forever in the boundless sea, which must sooner or later cover the whole world with love, peace and Christian faith. We can by no tneans criticise Ingersoll for exercising free thought and following l1is own convictions, but we should rather praise hitn, for such is the road to scientific advancement and discovery. The men who get out of the ruts made by others and think and reason for themselves are those tl1at tnake the tnost of fife and bestow the greatest blessings upon others. The only question is, was Ingersoll true to his own convictions,. did he honestly and actnally follow \Vhither reason lead hitn? There are good grounds for supposing he did not. In his boyhood he was etnbittered against the Christian religion by son1e petty persecutions which befell his father, a Congregational clergyman. Young Ingersoll attributed the w bole blame of the per- secutions to orthodoxy and came to treasure against it the most bitter hatred. We all know that the love and friendships we forn1 in childhood are the tnost enduring; that throughout life we love to look back on those dear associations ofour early days. Friendships forn1ed later are unstable and subject to change, but those of childhood are seldom so. Is it not fair then to suppose the same to be true of hatred : that Ingersoll, early stung by the bitter pangs of hatred, ever afterwards remained a slave to its fury? He found plenty of tnaterial upon which to feed his wrath and strengthen his pre- judices. The same narrovv and unintelligent religious views that had persecuted his father, have found expression back in all ages and history of the religion. By such vie-vvs n1a rtyrs in vast nutnbers have suffered untold tortures and death ; long and bloody wars have been raged with a fiendish fierceness, and even Christ hitnself was maltreated by Pharisaistn. Thus bred in hatred and thirsting for revenge he becatne as narrow and intolerant as the most faulty religious sects and creeds that he attacked. His lecture on \Hell\ bears proof of his intoler• ance ; for he begins with the statement: ''I have no respect for any human being \Vho believes in it.\ Can such a man look fairly at both sides of the question? Will he be likely to put him- self in the place of the man for whom he has no respect and try to support th~ views and con.w duct of that man by sound arguments? It is much tnore in harmony with hutnan nature to suppose that he would blindly turn aside from

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. such a cout·se. It has been truly and well said : \ He could as little comprehend a Christian as Torquemeda a Protestant ; Land, a Puritan ; or Cotton Mather, a Qyaker.\ He fancied he was attacking the church of God when he was n1erely assailing the faults of its bigoted and into:ler~nt adherents. Certainly, if we judge everything by its faults, there is nothing in this vvorld that will leave a very favorable itnpression upon us. No tnan as snch has ever yet been able to understand the Bible in all its teachings. Can we suppose that Ingersoll, a slave to prejudice and hatred, was so far above other n1en as to be equal to the task? On the contrary, of all men he seen1s to have been the n1ost unfair in his judgtnents. He took passages out of their places, disregarded all circun1stances and connections and read in thetn whatever n1eaning he chose. He interpreted fig11rative passages literally, exaggerated stater:nents a hundred fold, read God's approval in everything with which his disapproval is not itntnediately and expressly stated ; and in spite of the statetnent of Christ to the contrary, he n1ainta ined that the whole of the Mosaic law if ever true is true at the present tin1e ; when it was only intended for a crude barbaric people. Although Ingersoll l1as been almost uni- versally condemned by feligionists as a dema- gogue and a tnonster, ,:yet he has many redeem- ing qualities. We must not ourselves fall into the same 1nistake of intolerance of which we accuse hin1. He was a true and noble son of his country in thne of need, an effective jury lawyer, an honest and loyal politician and states- man; and, above all, one of the mightiest orators this country has ever known. Though he was an infidel he was not an atheist. He nowhere says there is no God. He only says: '~There may be one God, there 1nay be a million, I do not know.\ In his last published verses we have a beautiful sentin1ent of hopefulness expressed: \Is there beyond the silent night An endless day? Is death a door that leads to light? We cannot say. The tongueless secret locl{ed in fate We do not know, we hope and wait.\ In these lines we hear the desperate cry of the human soul against oblivion. 'Ve see that even Ingersoll was not satisfied with his statement when he said : \Life is a narrow vale between the lofty peaks of two eternities. We strive in vain to look beyond the he.ights. \V e cry aloud and the only answer is the echo of our wailing.\ Like all mortals he trembled at the echo of that empty wailing, and could not resist the gentle voice of hope which whispered in his longing heart words of love and comfort. The attacks of Ingersoll and countless others upon the Christian church 1nay be compared to the repeated dashing of the waves upon the tnighty rocks of Gibraltar. Again and again from far and near, with all their feeble vengeance, they dash against those stalwart walls only to fall back helpless and exhausted, their sole effect being to wash frotn those walls the sedi- tnent and grains of foreign f!latter which rnay have accumulated there and dimmed their glory; while that mighty and towering colutnn of rock still stands out, brighter and purer than ever, the hope of mankind and the enduring \vork of God. And we heartily voice the sentiment of another, when he said : ''Every tritHnph of Ingersoll will in the great revolution of God's design be found to be a sermon for the truth.\ L. N. BROUGHTON, 1900. FQESHMAN HARE AND HOUND RACE. Inspired by the music of the bugle and the cheers of the Sophs., the class of I 903 enjoyed the first \hares and hounds\ of the season last Tuesday afternoon. H. J. Brown, 1901, was leader of the hares and took his fleet band over a course of about three miles. Griswold, I 903, the chief hound, showed \dog-sense'' in not following a false trail dropped by some knowing Soph. who doubtless ran many tniles thinking that the \Fresh\ were following. Dickinson, 1903, acted as \whipper-in.\ Although it was the first time the freshmen have been out, good time was made, the hounds finishing only half a minute behind the hares. There are indications of some good track material in 1903, and it will doubless contribute as many men to general athletics as it has to football. ., J \ ' I ' .:~~ j . I l

j . ' -~ ' THE C'ONOORDIENSIS. 7 THE TQACK TEAM. Plans for the Coming Season Outlined. It has been defin,itely decided to give up the fall track tneet and in place of this, to hold a mid-winter meet in the gy.tnnasium during the early part of the next terrn. This meet will continue through three days. The preliminary contests will be held on the afternoons of the first two days and the finals will be run ofl' on the evening of the third day. The tnanagement has decided to engage .a cornpetent and expert coach in the spring, and this decision of the managen1ent is to be heartily commended, since coaching is a prin1e necessity to the success of a tea1n. There is abundant rnaterial to be found in college at any time and competent coaching is all that is required. Without it a teatn cannot succeed. This fact was very clearly den1onstrated last spring. The lack of those finishing touches which come only through an expert coach was apparent every- where and was the only obstacle that prevented our having a first rate team. This year's team will greatly miss Ex-Captain Price who was our most successful poin.t win- ner. Atnong the others whom we lose are l\1edberry, Huntley, H. K. Wright, Hegeman, Hinman, and Gulnac, 1902. In the sprints this year there will be Kline, Vv ... ells, 1903 ; in the hurdles, \Veed, Dunning, Griffith, Weed 1903 ; in the distance runs, Merriman, Hoadley, Broughton, vVight, Hawkes; in the field events, Capt. Davis, Finnegan, Oakley, Weed, Ache- son, G.iffith, Weed 1903, R. Donnan 1903; in the bicycle lvlackenzie, 1903 ; Gordon, 1903 ; Garretson, 1903. There is without doubt much other good material in college which would have been brought out had there been a fall meet. In lieu of this fact it is hoped that every one who thinks he can do anything in track athletics or has any inclination that way, will take part in the mid-winter n1eet. Diffidence often keeps good talent unknown ; therefore there should be a large nutnber of those who make trial at the mid-winter n1eet. ADELPHlCS AND PHILOMATHEANS DEBATE. First Inter-society Struggle a Decided Success. The first of the monthly inter-society debates took place last Thursday evening in Adelphic hall. Considerable interest was shown, and the rootn was filled with students. The subject under consideration was: ''Resolved, that the Boers have sufficient cause to justify war with England.\ The Philomatheans argued for the affirmative, and the Adelphics had the negative side of the question. Willard D. Brown, 1900, opened the debate for the affinnative, referring to the treaties between England and the 1'ransvaal, particu- larly that of r884, by which England relin- quished all clai n1 to suzerainty over the Boers. He etnphasized the fact that after thirteen years England is again claiming the right to interfere in the afrairs of the Transvaal. C. J. Potter, 1900, started the battle for the Adelphics. He dwelt upon the fact that eighty per cent. of the population of the Transvaal is English, that they pay ninety per cent. of the taxes, that the resources and wealth of the country have been more developed by English- men than by the Boers, and that therefore the English residents should be given citizenship and a share in the governtnent. 1'he other speakers were, S. S. Read, 1900, and L. W. Bloch, 1902, for the affinnative, and E. c. Roger&, I900, and E. L. vVinterberg, 1900, for the negative. The n.1ain trend of the affinnative argun1ent was that the Boers had n1igrated into the 1'ransvaal frotn Cape Colony in order to be free ; that England by treaty acknowledged the independence of the Trans- vaal and bad no right to tnake dernands on the Boers ; that the latter were fighting in self- defense which is always justifiable. On the other hand the negative contended that the population is largely English, that they pay the greater part of the taxes, that the Eng- lish have been the greatest factor in the develop-

8 THE OONOORDIENSIS. ment of the country, and that therefore England has the right to protect their citizens wherever they are. Prof. Opdyke, who acted as judge, was of the opinion that the affinnative had shown con- clusively that the English have no legal right to interfere in Transvaal matters. He therefore rendered his decision in favor of the affinnative. The next inter-society debate will probably be held the early part of next tenn. THAT HAMILTON CONT~OVEQSY. At the invitation of the investigating comtnittee appointed to look into the charges preferred by Hamilton regarding the Union-I-Iamilton gatne, a comtnittee frotn Hatnilton composed of Mur- ray H. Andrews, '99; F. Cookinhatn, 1900, and Henry C. Miller, 1900, came to this city last Friday afternoon and united in a joint sessio~ with the Union committee con1posed of Clinton Jones, r9oo; Philip L. Thotnson, 1900; George E. Raitt, 1900, and A. C. Fenton, 1900. Prof. Howard Opdyke and A. ]. Dillingham were also present, representing the Athletic Board. At the session the charges of Hatnilton were stated and a considerable amount of written evidence was presented in answer. After a long discussion the details of which were not made public the representatives of both institutions agreed to subtnit the reports to their respective colleges. The tneeting sent the following statement to the Associated Press: \'The joint Union-Han1ilton cotninittee, in session at Schenectady, regrets that n1any unofficial and decidedly biased accounts of the U nion-lla tnilton football gatne have found their \Vay into the press, and in justice to both colleges we desire that nothing tnore be published until the work of the investigating con1n1ittee is finished and a report submitted.

ANDREWS, for the Hamilton Corntnittee. . ·......:..;.- THE AQM,ST~ON:G BEQUEST. $150,000 Comes to Union by Decision of the Court of Appeals. A wave of joy swept over Union College Wednesday tnorniag when President Raymond announced the decision of the Court of Appeals, affinning the judgment of the lower courts con- cerning the will of the late Thomas Armstrong of Plattsburg. The case has been in contest for over three years and during that ti1ne has been vvatched with interest and anxiety by every one connected with this institution. The entire property, as set down in the will, atnounts to about $15o,ooo, consisting of personal and improved real estate. The testator died in Decetnber, 1895, and his 'vill was probated in the Surrogate's Court of Clinton County in May, 1896. 1'he will was immediately contested by Em rnett ArmstronO\ o' a son of the deceased, and Harriett, a divorced wife. In respect to the latter, the judgtnent divorcing her was found to be valid. The son then contested the validity of the will on the grounds that his father was of unsound mind and therefore incompetent to tnake one. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury rendered a ver- dict in favor of Union College. It was then carried to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and next to the Court of Appeals, and in both cases the sa me verdict was reached. In addition to the benefits to be derived frorn the provisions of this will, the testator has at \'arious titnes deeded other 111oney and property to lTnion College, as in I 89o, when he conveyed by deed certain real estate, the incon1e of vvhich arnounts to about $6,ooo. The history of the life of this benefactor is a sad and unfortunate one. l-Ie came to this country a friendless boy, and comn1encecl to work at his trade as a tailor. At1er his n1arriage in 1842 he took up the study of law, and in r847 was admitted to the bar. When the civil war broke out, he entered the ranks and served as colonel of a volunteer regiment. In the course of his life he accumulated a large estate; but this did not give hitn due happiness, as his I !

I ! THE CONC·OBDIENStS. PRESIDENT I(A YMOND ON BIBLE STUDY. At the usual vesper service held last Sunday afternoon, those present had the pleasure of listening to an interesting talk by President Raytnond. dotnestic relations were greatly strained. His son was at one time a student at Union, but he ' did not foster habits of industry, and disap- pointed his father's expectations, so that in r883 when the tnother and father became separated, he went to live with his mother. Soon after this separation, Mr. Armstrong becatne inter- ested in Union College, and through the friend- ship of Judge Landon willed tno st of his prop- erty to the institution. ': After the reading of a portion of the one :hundred and nineteenth Psalm, Dr. Rayn1ond developed his theme on the study of the Bible. ''There are always two things to be considered IlVlPROVEMENTS TO THE \GYM.\ The college gymnasium has been undergoing sorne needed repairs during the summer and fall, and by the winter term will be in a splendid ·state of readiness. A portion of the floor has been relaid ; new screens have been placed in the vvindows ; the sashes and baseboards have been repainted; and the stairway from the locker rootn to the gytnnasiutn proper has been enclosed with a vestibule on both floors. The defect in the heating apparatus by reason of which so tnuch coal-gas was thrown off has been remedied and the ventilation hereafter will be perfect. The locker rootn has been renovated in every particular. Those pieces of apparatus needing it, have been repaired, and all the mattresses will be remade. In view of all the improvernents which have been made, Prof. Pollard purposes to enforce sotne rigorous rules in regard to the use of the gymnasium. During the winter tern1 \Gym.\ work will be required of both the under classes. The sophotnores \vill exercise two hours a week and the freshtnen \vill have three hours of work. Prof. Pollard has cotnpleted the 1neasuren1ents of the freshn1an class and \vi II organiz·e the gyn1nasi un1 classes as soon as possible. 1903 has chosen a regula- tion garnet anu black \ Gytn.\ suit. INTEQCOLLEGIATE. The track managetnent at Cornell have plans under consideration for sending a Cornell team to the great World's 1neet, to be held at Paris . 111 1900. : in Bible study : knowledge of the Bible as a book, and the spiritual interpretation of the Bible. It is possible to interpret it spiritually. Every educated tnan should be acquainted with the Bible, as a book, at least. Fatniliarity with the Bible and the diflerent books should be acquired. The ignorance of many people of refinement is not atnusing, but surprising antl to be deplored. It is a reproach for a tnan not to know the different books of the Bible as they are classified-poetical, historical and prophet- ical and the Gospels of the New Testarnent. \In reading the Bible through, the historical books should be read first, as one would interest himself in any narrative. r.rhe Psalms should be used for devotional reading and worship. After that, a special study should be made of the great characters in the Bible, not so tnuch of the early tnen, Abrahatn and Isaac, but of Moses, with whom began practically the civil- ization of the Jews, of Joshua, Satnuel, the first of the prophets, of David, and Solomon, in whose reign Israel reached the height of her pt·osperity. Then, a critical search through the Gospels, would reveal everything regarding the characters of Peter, who represented one dis- tinctive party, the Jews, and of Paul, who was the great Gentile n1issionary. \The study of Christ's character should be separate from the others, and when each attribute of Christ is sacredly and conscientiously traced out, He becotnes most to us.\ Next Sunday Dr. Raymond's subject will be, \Principles which will guide us in the study of the Bible and will enable us not only to talk intelligently on the Bible, but also will aid us spiritually.\

CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, TERMS: $2.00 per Year, in Advance 10 Cents Address all comn1unications to THE CoNCORDI- ENSIS, Box 213, Schenectady, N. Y. Entei'ed at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class matter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. THE business manager announces that subscrip- tions are now due and asks for a speedy settlement of this obligation. THE ANNUAL fall tenn concert of the musical clubs is announced to take place in the Van Curler opera house on the evening of December 11. It is the duty of every man to attend. WHERE is the Junior hop c01nmittee, and where are the editors of the Junior annual ? Last year by this time the hop comtnittee had not only orga- nized but had given a successful dance. If the cOtntnittee from the present junior class is expect- ing to follow custotn and give a hop before the holidays, we would advise an imn1ediate meeting. And too, last year the Thanksgiving vacation found the work on the 1900 Garnet well under way, while the 1901 board of editors have not yet held a meeting this tertn. If the Junior class would devote sotne of the energy which it spends in yells at college tneetings and on the campus, to the legitimate junior organizations, such action would meet with universal approval. THROUGH an oversight in the football review of last issue, all mention of Manager MacCulloch was omitted. We therefore take this opportunity of showing our appreciation of the earnest and zealous manner in which he carried out his duty. Few undergraduates realize the time that the manager of a college team expends, and the trouble he incurs throughout a season. Many thanks are due both Mr. MacCulloch and the Advisory Board for their devotion and work for Old Union. WITHOUT appearing to fill the editorial columns with matters of trite importance, we feel that there are some things though seemingly trivial, yet which as the organ of the student body it is our duty to bring to the attention of the proper authorities. In the present instance we refer to the absence of light in the bath and toilet rooms of the gymnasium. The old method of illumination-kerosene-has up to within a few weeks ago been in use, but since that time even the faint gleam of the two oil lamps has been lacking, and but for the kindly beams of Luna the rooms would have been entirely dark. But this star has now filled her engagement and though a return date is promised for next month there is an interval of three weeks during which light is a necessity. We would remind the college superintendent that the building is in part lighted by gas, and an extension of the pipes to the west end of the structure could be accomplished by little time and money. If this suggestion is acted upon by the time of our return next Tuesday morning, the vacation will certainly have been one for Thanksgiving. THE EDITORS of the Hamilton Life in carrying out the policy they have adopted relative to the trouble arising out of the recent Hamilton-Union football game, have, in our opinion decidedly over- stepped the bounds of propriety. In their issue of November 18, they have stooped so low as to declare directly that college spirit, false, base and ugly finds its almost perfect embodiment in Union college. They have taken a stand of which no other college publication in the country would be guilty, a stand which will do more harm to the name of Hamilton college than years of athletic

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 defeats. And why this bitter attack? The facts are too well known to be repeated-an alleged .grievance, but at the same time a disposition on the part of both colleges to clear up., if possible, the misunderstanding. Both institutions appoint investigating committees. The Hamilton repre- sentatives \Vrite to Union suggesting a joint con- ference, that charges may be presented, answers made, concessions allowed and the whole unfortu- nate affair cleared up. The suggestion is gladly accepted by Union. After this request of the Hamilton committee was written and before the meeting takes place, the Hamilton life, makes its appearance, its columns filled with abuse; though not one word of the charges on which it is based had even been preferred. We agree entirely with the sentiment expressed in another column of the same issue of the \Life\ from which we quote: ''.A college student, we n1ay say without e:x:agger- ation, is the most responsible person in the \vorld. It is he, more than anyone who is answerable for the honor not only of his college but of his race. He is considered an example, looked up to as a guide.\ Now can any fair n1inded judge view the course of the editors of the Hamilton Life as con- sistent with the doctrine they have professed? We think not. But is it right to suppose that the senti- ments expressed in the issue referred to, are representative of the student body of Hamilton ? We hope and believe not. We give the students of Hamilton credit for better judgement. THE UNIVEQSITY. AT THE LAW SCHOOL. The junior class of the Albany Law School has elected the following officers: President, Cl1arles J.

Windsor, Albany. A VICTOQY FOQ THE JUNIORS. At Schuylerville last Saturday afternoon. the junior class team met and defeated a team repre~ senting the Schuylerville athletic association, by a scot·e offive to nothing. The tean1 ]eft early in the n1orning and were so well entertained and impressed by the generous treatn1ent they received that in all probability a return ga tne will be arranged for next year. Soon after arriving, the visitors repaired to the field where tl1e teams lined up, the Juniors kicking off. During the first half the ball was mostly in Schuylerville's possession while their superior weight and a slippery downhill field made the situation look dubious for 1901. But in the second half the Juniors played better ball and by a quarterback kick and a double pass made the only touchdown of the day. Soon after this titne vv-as called. The best playing \vas done by Robinson, Brown, and Slack, although the line held firn1 at critical points and the teatn work of the collegians was strong. About two hundred people witnessed the struggle. A COMMUNICATION. Editor of Tke Concordiensis: If I am not mistaken several years ago a prize 'vas offered for the best exhibition of the several styles of football kicking. These included punting, drop kicking, and place kicking. Now this year there has been no lack of good kickers on the team, and as the season is over would it not be a good plan to revive these contests? ALUMNUS. In June, 1895, the local alumni of the college presented a cup to be contested for annually. The conditions governing competition were that the student securing the highest average in the three styles of football kicking should have his name engraved on the cup. It was contested for at the Centennial Con1mencement in 1895, and the first name placed on the cup was Howard Mallery. Since then there have been no further contests. The present whereabouts of the cup at·e not known but it is supposed to be in the hands of the \Union College Athletic Association\ -Ed.]

' President Rayn1ond will deliver the sennon at the Thanksgiving service in the First Refonned Chutch. .. Thomas G. Delbridge, 1903, \Vas con1pe1led last week to return to his home in Batavia on account of sickness. Dr. Jacob Fry, '5r, a professor at the Luth- eran Theological Sen1inary of Philadelphia, was on the hiU Monday. Neil G.

The Thanksgiving recess begins at noon on Wednesday and continues until Tuesday, Decem- ber 5, when the students are expected to report at chapel. At a tneeti ng of the Hudson River School- masters' Club held at the Albany Acaden1y on Saturday, Pr<)f. Frederick R. Jones delivered an interesting address. George B. Young~ 'g6, delivered a lecture on \~1'urkey and the 'I'urlo/' last week Monday evening, before the n1en1bers of the ho1ne depart- nlent of the East Avenue Presbyterian Sunday school. On 1'hursday evening of last vveek the consis- tory board of the First llefonned Church decided by :a unanin1ous vote to ask President H.aytnond to continue indefinitely the services to the t_;hurch which he has been rendering since Septetnber last. President Rayn1ond ha~ the 1natter under consideration but we are a.uthorized to say that no arrange1nent \rvill be tnade which will con- flict in the least with his duties to the college. It is probable that he may consent to preach for the church during the next six months. UNDE:QG:QADUATBS TO FEAST. Plans Perfected for the ·university Banquet. Two years ago the first university banquet was held and was pronounced by all who attended a great success. The different depart- rrJents at Albany were well represented and it did n1uch to unite the undergraduates by creat- ing a \university spirit.\' It has been already announced that action has been taken to have another banquet this year, and the final arrangements are being made. Messrs. A. B. Lawrence, E·. C. Rogers, and C. D. Stewart, represent the :college in the banquet comn1ittee, and representatives frorn the Medical College and Law School are cooperating with thetn. The banquet will probably be held the second or third Friday of the winter term at the Edison. Over one hundred frorn Schenectady have already pledged themselves to go, and many are expected from the departments at Albany so that a large attendance is anticipated. Each departn1ent of tbe university will be represented by a speaker, vV. D. Loucks responding for the undergraduates of the college. The graduates of the colleg·e who are now in the professional schools are helping the com- mittee to a. great degree and the following clipping will sho\v ·what an interest in the banquet is being taken at Albany. .''There was a tneeting yesterday of the seniors and juniors of the .. l\..lbanv Law School to n1ake . . arrangen1ents for the university banquet to be held in Schenectady in January. Messrs. Her- rick, I-Iintnan and Burke were appointed a cotn- nlittee to look after the la\v departtnent's part in the affair, .which pron1ises to Le a very brilliant one, and in 'Yhich all departn1ents of Union U nt versity \'viii participate.'~ Every man in college· ought to make up his tnind to attend.
