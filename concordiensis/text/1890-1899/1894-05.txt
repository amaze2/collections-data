It rnay be that the study of the ancient classics is less generally popular to-day than in the past ; that in proportion to the popu- lation the nurnber of persons in thi.s country _ engaged in antiquarian pursuits is sn1aller at · present than at any time since the first ·school was established in Ne\v England; and that the president of Harv&rd University, through , the -extension and expansion of the elective · systenT, has seemingly done tnuch to din1inish · that number not only at Harvard, but in n1any acaden1ic institutions where the effect of exam-ple is seen, yet thP. fact ren1ains that the actual nurnbcr of specialists in ancient lore was never so great as no\v, either here or in Europe; that the nun1ber ~is steadily in- creasing, and that the zeal, energy and enthu- sianl of archmologists, classical philologists, and students of antiquity in general, as \vell as the sum total of hutnan knowledge in things ancient, must be indicated by a higher figure in this our day and generation, than at any previous period since the revival of learning. Nor is it fair to impute to the distinguished educator just tnentioned a policy intended to discourage the study of Latin and Greek. The splendid equipment of the classical department in the institution of which he has long been the head is in itself sufficient to disprove such an in1putation. It is not then surprising that the ancient drama should have been rnany tin1es revived in this country as . well as in England, and that Greek and Latin plays should be placed upon the stage at llarvard, in Nevv York, and at the University of Pennsylvania. Such revivals are of the utmost value .to education, and go far to inl- press upon the public n1ind the fact that the \dead languages\ are in son1e sense at least still living; and by bringing the life of antiq- uity more vividly into view make it easier to understand ho\v much of ·what is ordinarily believed to be modern is little n1ore than the bequest of an earlier, yet no less active civili- zation. . This is the first tin1e that a Latin play has been put upon the stage in Atnerica \Vith so much regard to truth in the representation, and such careful attention to the testin1ony afforded by ancient monun1ents and texts. It is true that arch~ological accuracy has been apparent in the representation \.f Greek plays in this country and elsewhere-notably of the Oedipus Tyrannus, given at Harvard in I 88 I, of the Acharnians of Aristophanes _,(brought out\ by the students and faculty of the Un-iversity cf J>ennsylvania in 1886,. and of the Antigone 1:vhich was acted by the young ladies of Vassar last May. But the acting of plays selected fron1 the Ron1an drama has been generally of a n1ore perfunc- tory character, even at the public schoois in England, although the Captivi of Plautus, as given at St. Francis Xavier's Roman Catholic College in New York, in I 890, and afterwards at the vVorld's ~--air, is acknowledged to have been a very creditable perforrnance. The Phorn1io of Terence \vas selected on the present occasion on account of its adapta- bility to n1odern conditions, its coxnparative free do n1 fron1 references and allusions not \vholly in keeping '''ith modern taste, and in general for the \Veil-rounded character of its plot. Being easier than rnany other plays to represent, it \Vould render a faithful and accur- ate reproduction n1ore feasible-though it may be doubted ·whether the Captivi or the Adelphoe \vould not have answered the pur- pose as \veiL Prepa.ration for the perform- ance began a year ago, and it is said that the caste had been determined and the parts dis- tributed before the summer vacation. Re- hearsals commenced in October ancl \vere continued \Vithout intern1ission until the time of the perforn1ance. 1'he university theatre in Men1orial Hall, \Vhere the play 'vas given, is well suited to the purpose. It is constructed in part on the lines of a Roman theatre of the tirne of Pon1pey and later. It has the low stage \vith a permanent back-wall, the latter being decorated \Vith carvings and a Latin inscription. The scene, \vhich presents the fronts of three houses, rises only to a point about half way up the \vall, \vhere the tnusic- gallery, projecti11g fro111 the \Vall, suggests the roof \vhich in the ancient theatres over- hung the stage, but did not protect the audi-

The charac- ters and costumes are likewise Greek, and it is Greek life and Greek manners and cnston1s : and thought that are, in the n1ain, depicted .. Allusions to things exclusively Rotnan appear not infrequently in the plays of Plautus ; but in the dramas of Terence they are generally to be regarded as exceptional. This theatre has also the semicircular orchestra, fi Bed with . benches, not chairs ; and back of this are the · qualtuordcciln or dines, or fourteen rows { \Vhich \Vere reserved by the la\v of Otho for the knights), arranged in wedges (cuuei), \.vith the : stairs (scalae) between-all in accord with Roman custom and precedent.

At Rome the seats in the orchestra 'vere assigned to persons of senatorial rank and to guests of the state. At Harvard this part of the theatre was filled with the tnost disting- uished guests of the University, including n1any college presidents.

These did not come into · general use until after Terence's death, and wouid have conceal:ed fron1 view that play of the features which even the Ron1ans n1issed \iVith regret in the later days of the dran1a. A bountiful supply, h:o\vever, of false hair and paint on this occasion,, as frequently on the Rornan stage, took ;the place of the n1asl<:s, and produced a very si n1 ilar effect. The costutnes represented the Greek dress of every-day life, and were as accurate in every particular as it was possible to rr1ake them. Both men and vvornen in ancient Greece wore t\vo garn1ents., the tunic and the mantle. The ,mantle n1ight be of a bright crin1son tint, especially if the wearer \vere a youth of birth and fortune. Of such description was the pal!iu11z of Mr. Oliver, while thait of Mr. Slater, who played Phaedria, 'vas conspicu- ous for the richness of its purple. The other characters, with the exception of Nausis- tra ta the wife of Chremes, wore garn1ents of a n1ore sombre hue. Each actor had on the conventional soccus, or shoe of comedy. The caste of the Phormio requires fourteen actors, including the speaker of the prologue. Now in the Latin con1edy we have the New Con1edy of Athens, and it is interesting to note a difference here between the \ New\ and the \Old for when the Acharnians was given in Philadelphia it \vas necessary to enlist a company of no less than 70 perforn1ers. The task of costutning and training this large nun1ber tnust have been stupendous; yet this was largely offset in the _Latin play by the greater difficulties incident to the cor- rect treatrnen t of the metres and the rhythrn, especially in those verses known as .Scpte;tarii and Octo!larii. These vvere recited, not sung, to a musical accotnpanitnent. To do this in a nat ural vvay, with a certain degree of con- versational tnanner and gesture, rnaintaining ahvays the rhythrn of the verse without spoil- ing the sense or the syllables,-to do it too in dialogue where often .. as many as three in- terlocutors deliver parts of one and the satne line, is no easy tna tter, but one requiring even n1ore practice and skill than are necessary to the correct delivery of the dialogue parts in the Greek con1edy or tragedy. Yet this difficulty was ably overcome by the young gentlen1en who were trained for the I)horn1io by Professors Greenough, Allen, l\1ason and 1-Ioward.

SIDNEV G. ASIIJ\lORE. REMINISCENCES. The eighteenth lecture in the Butterfield course was delivered Friday, April the twen- tieth by the founder of the course Gen. Daniel Butterfield, '49. Gen. Butterfield's lecture as put down on the progran1me \Vas to be on \ College Education as a Prepara- tion for the duties of Life;\ but as he \Vas called so suddenly to deliver it, he decided to give a lecture on \Ren1iniscences\ and one on the other subject at sotne future date. President Rayn1ond introduced the Gen- eral giving a short but interesting sketch of his life, telling how he gradually rose to the position he occupied at the close of the \Var and of the grand \Vork he did for the Union during the great Rebellion. He also told hovv he had since the \Var occupied many positions of trust and had become one of the most prominent men in the country. Before the introduction the mandolin and guitar club rendered son1e very sweet selec- tions as a greeting to Gen. Butterfield. The lecture \vas one of the most interest- ing of any in the course, and at its close cheer upon cheer announced to the General \Vith \vhat pleasure he had been listened to. It abounded in witty and spicy stories, concerning President Lincoln and all the great Generals of the \Var. During the lecture Gen. Butterfield said : The true history of the civil \Var will not be written till the next century, after the jeal- ousy between the two parties incurred has been s\vept away. In order to understand and unravel history it is necessary to under- stand the workers. One of the stron_;est features of a great soldier is sincerity and directness. \Vellington always pr,eserved sincerity and directness in both high and low lrfe.

But 'when 'Grant carne into con1mand he knew there \vasgoing to be trouble, He had served \vith Grant on the Pacific coast, and he kne\v that he was a tough custotner. He knew how to play poker, and he always risked his last cent. This was proved at the seven day's battle of the wilderness. The first day the Confeder- ates thrashed him and they supposed he \Vould be gone in the morning; but when light ca. rne he was still there and remained six days, although he got beaten \vorse every day. Mr. Lincoln always closed his arguments with an anecdote. The n1any tales about his vulgar stories are false ; f::lr all of his stories \Vere full of cleverness and point. At the ti n1e when Mr. Hunter, a southern en- voy, \vas talking vdth Mr. Lincoln concern- ing tern1s of peace, he told hin1 that Chas. I. offered better terms to the English confeder- ates than he had been offered. Mr. Lincoln turned sl ')\V~y to Secretary Seward and said : \Mr. Seward, you are a learned man, I believe. But did'nt Chas. I. have his head cut off?\ President Lincoln \Vas a gentleman in every respect. Fie would deny hitnself any- thing for the sake of a friend. He vvas court- eous and gentlemanly at all times, and a great deal of his strength rested on these qualities. The house at the blue gate is being reno- vated, in preparation for its occupancy by President Raymond.

Dr. Wells' lecture on the 24th was an in- troduction to the early Vikings of the Norse- la nd. The Vikings were lords of the strean1s and rivers and spent their tin1e in fishing, hunting and war. Their ovvn ·waters offered little opportunity to satisfy their sea faring instincts and so they set out for other lands. They settled in Nonnandy of France, made invasions in Britain, visited northern Africa, and even went as far east as Constantinople. But vvhile these things were taking place, other Norsemen sailed westward to Iceland, Newfoundland, and northern parts of the ' United States. A model .of one of the ships . used on these voyages has been discovered , buried in Norway, and from this a ship was built and exhibited at the Columbian Expo- sition.

April 23d, the Union College Glee and Mandolin clubs gave a con- cert in the college chapel to a large and appreciative audience con1posed of college students and the music loving people of the city of Schenectady . During the afternoon previous to the con- cert a large and comn1odious stage had been erected which elevated the players so that they could be easily seen fron1 any part of the house. An electric lamp had also been suspended fron1 the chapel ceiling gt vu1g abundant illurnination, an essential which fanner chapel concerts have lacked. Draperies \vere hung in the galleries and with the other decorations which were placed about the room,. consisting of potted plants, ferns, athletic en1blems, &c., n1ade the old college chapel a very pleasing place in ~which to hold this concert. 'The people began to arrive early in the evening and were quickly and quietly ushered to their seats. The check systen1 of seating had been adopted and under the careful supervision of Mr. Bro\vn and the intelligent work of the ushers who were attired in full dr~ess, there were few if any errors made. Easy chairs had been placed on the right side of the chapel to ac- con1 n1odate the patronesses and the St. Cecelia vocal society. The concert was opened by the glee club which sang the \ Hunter's Joy\ in a n1ost creditable n1anner. In fact the glee club did \vell in all their selections. There is, however, great room for improvement. There is no reason 'vhy Union should not have an excel- lent glee club. The St. Cecelia vocal society. by their pleasing and well rendered selections added , much to the enjoyment of the concert. The feature of the evening, however, was the playing of the Mandolin and Guitar clubs. They did excellent \vork and quite aston- ished the audience. Mr. Skinner's double selection was encored. He has \vonderful talent in this line and his selections vvere greatly enjoyed. The concert \vas a great success through- out. Much credit is due Prof. W. F. Rost, who condt1cted the vocal part of the concert,

The tean1 went to Troy last Friday atter- noon and met the strong professional teatn of that city. The ga-rne was not so loosely played as the score \vould seem to indicate. Owing to an unfortunate error in the first inning the professionals \vere enabled to score six runs, but after that our team played hard and steady ball. Tillapaugh's pitching was the feature of the game. A little more life on the bases, a little more judicious coaching on the lines, and our team vdll be at its best. ME£TINti OF THE ADVISORY BOARD. At a rneeting of the advisory board, held last Tuesday afternoon, protests \vere re- ceived from the Sophomore class against W. A.

The protested men par- ticipated in the class foot ball game recently played by the Freshmen and Sophomore tearns, and it \vas claimed by both classes that the above players were not eligible to play on their respective class teams.

It is very n1uch like the German, and was first cultivated and put into practice among the Danes. If any of the old Norse language is left, it exists in Iceland. The difference between the langua- ges spoken by the Norwegians, Swedes and Danes is very slight. The people of these lands are great readers and are able to speak French, German and English. The Danes possess a very fine literature, and have pro- duced some renowned authors and poets. JUNIOR HOP. The last hop given by the Junior class took place at Fuller's hall on Friday evening, May eleventh. This is the first departure this year fron1 the custom of holding the hops in the \ gyrn \ but as the floor vvas in excellent condition and the hall a very good one for a small dance, the success \vhich has thus far attended these events was not \vanting on this occasion.

The \Vi:lliatns college correspondent of tbe Albany Ez,ening :Journal says in last Satur- day nights' issue in referring to the co n1.i ng athletic n1eet at Ridgefield that Williams \vi:ll have \Excellent opportunity to wipe out the. disgrace of last year's defeat.'' This dis- courteous statement has given rise to much indignation among Union men; and so we take tll1is opportun.ity to inform our friends that the idle chaff of a newspaper correspond- ent should t1ot be taken as assut~ance of the genera:1 feeling at \Villiams. It would be doing Williarns men a great injustice to allow for an instant that such discourteous state- ments are sanctioned by thetn. And vve, who have ahvays enjoyed courteous treatn1ent at their hands, should be the last one to doubt their -generally accepted da·in1 for being gentletnetl. When one college invites another to engage in friendly contest on athletic fields it is absurd to talk of \disgraceful defeat.\ The Willia~rns college correspondent forgets that \N~ meet our betters every day in life and that there is no such thing as disgraceflll defeat in honest, earnest com petition. \tV e wish to be1ieve that the staten1ent made by the Williams college correspondent of the 7ounzal \Yas made thoughtlessly; and that it did not appear to him in the distasteful light in whicl1 it appears to the public. If \ve did not so believe ·we \vould be com_pelled to con- fess that l1e did not understand the first principles of con11non courtesy. A COMMUNICATION.

But Union Distanced Syracuse, Winning the Pennant .in a Walk, with Hamilton and Colgate Third and Hobart and Rochester Not in a. L:1st Wednesday morning when~ the Union .men at Syracuse arose frotn their downy couches at The Vanderbilt they discovered that it was still raining, but they took the situation cheerfully and hoped that it \vould clear up. They were confident, that rain or shine the Union team \\~as going to \Vin that pennant and cup, and their faith in the sturdy athletes fron1 the college in Dorp was unshaken by the abundance of moisture. Nor did they lose courage at all vvhe.n,on reaching Kirkwood park, they found the track a literal sea of mud. · Had the day been fair and the track good, several records would have been broken. The ti111e of the several events is fast taking into consideration the weather and condition of the track. Scofield, of Union, broke the Inter-collegiate record for the running broad jurnp, going 20 ft. 6 1-2 inches, the fonn·er The final was run off by the first three in the trial heats, and Fikes \Non in I 1 seconds, Hoyt second and Root third. Score : Union, o, Syracuse, 8. The fifth event, the mile walk, in this case kno-vvn as the 1nile wade, was called next. There \vere four entries, McEwan and Pollock, of Un,ion, and Whiteside and Kraus, of Syra- cuse. Pollock, McEwan and l{raus kept well tDgether tHl the stretch was reached -vvhen Kraus spurted by Pollock who foHo-vved hin1 closely for second and McEwan third. 'Titne: 10 minutes 2 seconds. Score : Union, 4, Syracuse, I 3· A shallow spot was now found in the n1ud for the shot put. A rnan \vas also found \vho consented to dive for the shot after each trial and another had the contract to -vvipe off the sphere -vvith a blanket. Ford, Colgate, managed to n1ake the \vinning cast with a distance of 36 ft. 9 inches; Barnes, Union, second ; Monroe, Colgate, third. Score : Union, 7, Syracuse, I 3· In this event Colgate won .8 points. While the shot put was deing contested the sprinters were taken in the boat (hack) to the 440 yard line. This was a very pretty and most interesting event of the day. Do\vn the stretch they came, IZilpatrick leading, with Fikes about ten feet behind. As they neared the finish Fikes gained on Kilpatrick and 'von by about two feet with O'Neill, Union, third. Time : 54 seconds. Score : record being I 9 ft. I r I -4 inches. The attendance was good. The Syracuse tnen vvere there in large numbers having in charge any quantity of co-eds. Union was represented by the largest visiting delegation and they were not afraid to let the co-eds and .. their escorts knovv that they were Union men. The first event, the roo yards dash was called at 2:30 sharp. The track vvas about three inches belovr a top dressing of saturated solution of dust. The entries \vere twelve in number, and the contestants \Vere all there. They \vere tal~ en in a hack to tl1e sera tch. In the first heat Fikes, Syracuse, won with Root, of Hamilton, second ; Hoyt, of Syracuse, , third. In the second heat Walker, of Union, . first ; Holleran, Union, second, and Van D u~ er, Union, third'! Union, I I, Syracuse, 18, The hurdles \vere now placed along the fence and held do\vn by vveights and the men varied the usual monotony by jutnping a hurdle and swimtning to the next, perhaps after clearing three or four they \vere fortu- nate enough to find a shallo\V spot in which they tnight again run instead of s-vvimming . Holleran, Union, finished first, with Twiford, Union, second, and Risley, Colgate, third. Tin1e : 20 4-5 seconds. Score: Union, 19, Syracuse) 18~ At this point Union took the lead and kept it~ The pole vault \vas held alongside the grand stand under the projecting roof. Mc- Clintock, Union, vaulted 9 ft. 2 inches, with Naylor, Hamilton, sec.ond, at 9 feet. Hoyt~

Score: Union, 30, Syracuse, I g. The two rnile bicycle race \vas the event of the day. Twelve n1en started to ride around the oval four tirnes in three inches of slush. Three men finished, the rest wrecked their wheels or becan1e tired of faH ing off every ten feet. Feek, of Syracuse, won in 1 5 n1in utcs. l-Ie had ropes tied around his tires so that ·when they struck hottorn the wheel did not slip. Brown, Syracuse, finished .second and Burtis, Union, third. Score: Union, 31, Syracuse, 27. In the broad jump under the roof of the grand stand Scofield, Union, \von, breaking the record, \vith Myers, Union, second, and Briggs, Colgate, third.

Shepard \VOn in the dra\ving for second. Score : Union, 52, Syracuse, 3 2. In the mile run every rnan entered ran but few finished. Kilpatrick \Von easily in 5 minutes 39 r-5 seconds, Burke, Harnilton, second ; Lewis, Syracuse, third. Score : Union, 57, Syracuse, 33· 1'he 220 yards dash \\'as very close and ex- citing. l{oot, of Han1ilton, and Fikes, of syracuse, were the favorites and the rooters for both rnen went wild as they seerncd to cross the line together, each ho'\Tcvcr claitning the race. The referee a\varded it to Fikes \Vith Root second and Van Duzer, Union, third. Titne : 24 I -5 second~. Score: Union, 58, Syracuse, 38. It \Vas now 7 o'clock and. the han1n1cr thro·w was· the only ren1aining event. The cro\vd left, it having becon1e painfully evident, to Syracuse at least, that Union had won the pennant, .and the hammer throwers repaired to the place n1arked for the event.

The day was an ideal one, the rain of Friday night- having put the track in excellent condition. The team went dh·ectly to the Ridgefield grounds and were soon followed by a large crowd wearing on cane, un1 hrella, and in button-hole the color of the favorite team. Ladies were noticed with garnet dresses and carrying garnet parasols, and \vhile the royal purple · was displayed by many of the fair ones present, yet the wearers of the garnet and the friends of\ Old Union,\ composed by far the larger part of the attendants. The grand stand \vas shortly filled with a pleasant, good 'The numbers were excellently rendered by each of the quartettes and all \vere con1pelled to respond to an encore. The Union 'quar- tette was encored twice and they in every vvay sustained the record rnade by the athletes during the day. The Union quar- tette \vas composed of Gillespie, first tenor; Kelly, second tenor; Auchampaugh, first · bass, and A. J. Bran1an, second bass. Too much cannot be said in praise of the excel- lence of the Syracuse Glee and Banjo C:lubs. The Glee Club ':vas obliged to respond to two encores. The Syracuse men were present in a body and their college yeU \Vas n umerou.:; and loud. The Union 1nen, however, were not at all bashful and n1ade enough noise to tnake it evident that they were there. After the concert \vas concluded President George H. Bond came forward and tnade a short speech about the attention paid to athletics by the Greeks and Rotnans and their importance at the present day. l-Ie presented the banner to Capt. Holleran of the Union team, and then called the natnes of the winners in each event and they can1e forward to receive the prizes. Syracuse made much noise, but Union also n1ade much, and as Union received rnost of the prizes U 11 ion n1ade noise oftenest. After the ex.ercises vvere concluded the Union men repa.h-ed to the Vanderbilt where they had a short cele- bration, boarding the I I :zo train for hon1e. Reaching Schenectady at 3:45 A. lV1., they natured throng, who patiently waited the a\ppearance of the contesting teams. Shortly after 2 o'clock the Williatns' tean1 en1erged from the club house, and irnmediately after them can1e the Union tean1. Both teams presented a fine, physical appearance and \vere vigorously applauded. The Union men looked especially neat in their ne\V athletic suits, garnet caps and sweaters. The judges and officers of the games took their positions, and the clerk of the course called up the opening event, the roo-yards dash. The following is a sumn1ary of the events and points vvon in each : One hundred yard dash-Patterson, Wil- liams, first; Deyo, Willian1s, second ; Allen, Williams, third. Titne 10 }'6 seconds.

THE CONCO·RDIENSIS. 7 UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER, 2; UNION, :21. Union played her second gatne of the series for the chan1pionship of the N. Y. S. I. C. league in H .. ochester, May I 7, and like the first one, \von \Vith ease. 1\he team has great1ly in1proved since the fore pa.rt of the season both in batting and base running; as the store below testifies. Although considerable rain had fallen the night before and also on the morning of the I 7th, the afternoon \Vas perfect. Rochester having beaten Syracuse . by the score of I r to I, Union n1en \Vere look- ing for a close ga-tne. The attendance \Vas . small in the grand-stand, but at least a thou- sand watched the garne from the outside of. the high picket fence surrounding the · Rochester University grounds. A. 0·. Masser, . I ... ehigh, '90, called the game at 3:30 P. l\1. Daley was in the box for Union and did v·ery effective work, holding Rochester do·wn to six. base hits and striking out six n1en. Rochester made one run in the first inning and one in the seventh. Union seemed to be able to n1ake runs at will and felt of the ball for nine- teen safe hits. Every man on Union's tcan1 played ball. For Rochester, the running one- handed catch of Menzie in right field and the double play of Wynne to Reynolds ·vvere features. The ti tne of gan1e \Vas hvo hours and a quarter.

The third garne of the season for the league chan1p-ionship \Vas played by Union and Hobart at Geneva, 1\1ay 18th. It had rained so as to prevent every ga·me which Hobart had advertised so far this year and it looked as if rain \vould also prevent this one, but the good luck which Manager White has enjoyed this season did not fail him and the weather pern1itted six innings to be played \vhich \Vas ail Union men desired to send six n1en across the plate. The Union tnen had their batting clothes on and touched Davis, vvho is con- ceded to be one of the strongest pitchers in the league, for nine dean b(}se hits. Union played an errorless game. Hobart played a plucky gan1e from the first, but it was of no avail, for Captain Howard's men vvere deter- n1ined to win .and only in one inning did they let more than four of their opponents go to bat. Murphy was in the box for Union and held Hobart do\vn to four base hits. Klein played center field and accepted two very difficult flies. 'fhe rest of the Union men played their usual steady gan1e. The coach- ing of Enders was a feature of the game that much a n1 used the grand stand. For Hobart, Case played the best game, having two base hits and one of them was a nice two-bagger. The team and management were n1ost favor- ably impressed with the treatment they re- ceived and speak very highly of the I-Iobart students. FoUowing is the score : UNION. A.B. R. LB. S.H. P.O. A. E.

WILLIAMS, 8; UNION, 7. The Willian1s team came to Schenectady Wednesday, May 23, 'vith the intention of repeating their victory of the Saturday before Beattie did not play his usual game either. Capt. Howard, ofcourse, did the star work of the game, taking every possible chance vvith- out tnaking ari error. Enders played an errorless gatne at first. Daley pitched a steady· game for Union, especially at critical points. It must be understood that Willi:uns is a hard hitting team, and Daley did not allow them to pound hin1 very hard. While Union lost the garne she is not at aU discouraged by the showing ~he n1ade. It is the closest scor·e she has played Williams in n1any years; and 'vhen the next game is played she has hopes of adding another victory to her list. Following is the score : \VILLIAMS. R. II. P.O.

At a recent joint ,meeting of the Adelphic and the Philomathean Literary Sodeties,there \vas introduced for discussion the subject of instruction in elocution. Opinions \vere fully .expressed by members of both societies, and as there \vas a unanirnous feeling in favor of the establishn1ent at Unior1.of such a course of instruction, a con:1 n1ittee -vvas a ppoin.tecl to take such steps as it savv fit in order to ascer- · tain what n1ove the Faculty would n1ake to meet the detnand. The Adelphic Society was represented by R. H. J?otter, '95, R. Guernsey, '96: and the Philotnathean by G. A. Johnson '95, W. H. I-lall '96. The con1- rrlittee consulted Prof. Truax, and a summary of the report presented to the follo·wing society tneeting is as follo\vs: '93· Ed\vin D. Conde, \vill represent the Associated Press at the State Camp at Peeks- kill this season. '66. Rev. Dr. George Alexander has been elected vice-president of the Phi Beta Kappa Alunu:li in N C\V York. '49· Gen. and Mrs. Daniel Butterfield have closed their to\vn house, No. 6r6 Fifth avenue, and have opened Cragside, their beautiful country place at Cold-Spring-on-the-1-Iudson, . where many distinguished foreigners have in times past been delightfully entertained. An1ong the names tnentioned for the Republican nomination for Governor of this state are several prominent Union men. l--Ion. Warner Miller, '60, l-Ion. John H. Starin, '59, and Senator Charles T. Saxton, a Union man by adoption, are included in the list. Senator Saxton is also mentioned as Republican candidate for the presidency in r ~2?· · On the Detnocrati~ si?e Secretary Dan tel S. Lan1ont may be mentioned. In order to make this movetnent successful · in any tnarked degree, the services of a pro- fessor of elocution and oratory would be necessary. This, the present financial string- ency in affairs renders impossible, for the present at least. Prof. Truax suggested, ho\vever, that thcs~ who \vere interested in giv- ing special time and attention to this line of \Vork should form a class, when he would sug- gest a plan of action. This class could organize ·with officers, the head of which should be the critic. The \vork undertaken is not to conflict or to run parallel \vith the present literary societies, but is to be devoted exclusively to oratorical and elocutionary \vork. It tnay be stated here that student~ who desire the proposed study will do well to state the fact to any one of the cornmittee named or ... to the president of either society. The work is open to all students, and only such men are ·wanted as purpose applying then1sel ves here as in any other regular study. A further discussion of the n1atter ·with Prof. Truax was arranged for, but owing to the unfortunate circumstances that have in- terfered, it is impossible that anything further than preparation for elocutionary work can be done this year. It is to be hoped that success will be met -vvith in endeavoring to provide opportunity for such instruction.

We respectfully ren1ind the Juniors that they are not Seniors until they pass up their Junior exatninations. The base ball team returned victorious from the western trip, defeating Hobart and Rochester. The Syracuse game 'vas not played on account of rain. The boys have been playing good ball this season and they are vvorking hard for that pennant and championship. They will win it, is our prophecy. At one of the college meetings held during the month the students teceived \vith great applause the very satisfacto.ry report of the comrnittee a la bztrte. I-Iere's to the health of Q:ld Union'! THE CoNCORDIENSIS is delighted to recognize the fact that one of the best long distance· runners of the world is a student of Union college. The way in \vhich Kilpatrick ran ~ast year at Chicago and his victory at Mott Haven recently have rrrade hitn fatnous. I-Ie is acknovvledged to be one of the stron:gest, speediest runners in the Atnerican · colleges to-day. THE CoNCORDIENSIS sin- cerely hopes that Kilpatrick may gain many n1ore honors for hi.mself and Old Union. The r,esnlt of the fi.eld meet at Syracuse May 30, is certainly gratifying to all who ar·e interested in the welfare of Old Union. For the past four years the . college has been rapidly advancing in all branches of athletics. Championship after championship, pennant after pennant has been won in foot ball and base ball, and the climax \vas reached on Wednesday last, \vhen the athletic team from Union n1et and easily defeated all con1ers. The only contesting college which 'vas \in it\ to any extent with Union, was her old time rival Syracuse, and she 'vas not in it very n1uch as the score shows. Great credit is due to the athletes and their trainer, Zach Cooper, their instructor, Dr. Linhart, their manager, A. E. Barnes, their captain, 1-~'. E. I-I olleran, and to the students ·vvho loyally supported with funds and their presence and cheers at Syracuse. INTEBCOLLEGRATE GAMES AT BERKELEY OVAL. Union sent her crack runner Kilpatrick dovvn to New York last Saturday to cotnpete with the other large colleges of the country in the intercollegrate games. Barnes and Burgin accompanied hhn but vrere unable to score in the events against the other athletes. Kilpattick,. however, was able to sho\v the sprinters frotn Yale, flarvard, Columbia, Princeton, etc., how to run a half mile win- ning easily in I n1inute 59 I-5 seconds. Charley took n1atters coaly while one of his opponents fainted in the arms of his trainer at the finish. One of the New York papers said he won in a canter.
