THB ®NG®RDIBNSIS. VoL. XXIII. UNION COLLEGE, SEPTEMBER 27, 1899. No. 1 .. TH'E NEW Y. M~ C~ A. BUILDING. GENEROUS GIFT OF A LOYAL ALUMNU'S. The Plans in Full, Now Published for the First Time. As was announced by President Raytnond at con1tnence1nent, Union is to have a Y. M. C. A. building, the gift of an alumnus, whose name at his own request is withheld for the present. The plans have not been fully decided upon, but we are able to present in this number of The Concordiensis a handsotne cut of the building and diagrams of the different floors, according to plans drawn by A. W. Fuller, architect, and which will doubtless be adopted without any radical changes. It is expected that work will be comn1enced within a short ti1ne ~nd be well under way this fall. The new building will occupy a site on the can1pus between South college and Professor Hoffman's residence. It will be constructed of pressed brick of a greyish color, with marble trimmings, and will consist of two stories with a basement and an attic, both of which can be finished, if at any time desired. The exterior will be finished and attractive from every point of view, and there will be easta11d west entrances. The building when cotnpleted will be an im- posing structure, and not out of hannony \Yith the other buildings on the campus. The basement will contain boiler and coal room, toilet 1·oo1n, and possibly a kitchen. . The ground floor will contain, as shown in the dia- gram, a large reception hall in the middle, on one side of which will be a parlor with a large alcove, the latter to be used as a tr<,?phy room. On the west front will be a porch with a veranda on each side, over which will be a balcony. On the east front will be an entrance into a second vestibule, on one side of which will be a cotn- tnodious hat and coat rootn (or co1n1nittee room) and on the other side the stairs to basement and also to the second story. On the south side of the building will be a re~d ing rootn with an alcove for writing purposes. The second story has a reception hall similar to that on the first floor. Over the parlor is a meeting room connected with the reception hall by large sliding doors, making in effect one large auditorium for general meetings. Over the reading room will be an oflice which, it is hoped, will be the future headquarters of The Concordiensis ; also a room for the general secretary, who will reside in the building. Con- nected with the secretary's office is a bath and toilet roo1n. There will be open fire places in each story. The building will be heated through by steam and lighted by either gas or electricity. It will be seen that ample provision has been made to meet the wants of the whole body of students, not only in reference t() their religious life, but also to their social enjoytnent, presenting at attractive place where all the varied interests connected with the college can rneet on equal and friendly terms and demonstrate that heart's good fellowship is not inconsistent with a high moral standard.

\ I I I 6, THE CONCORDIENSIS. THE SOUT'H COLLEGE P~OJECT. Class of '99 Working Hard for a Modern • Dormitory. The class of '99 have undertaken to leave behind them as a metnorial of their love for their alma mater, a dormitory in every respect modern yet surrounded by ancient traditions. With this aim in view, of giving Union a dor- mitory equal to the best in the country, a com- mittee was appointed and plans have been formed to remodel South college. It is planned to tear out all the old woodwork and floors and leave nothing but the old walls standing. Then the interior will be remodelled and made up-to-date in every respect. A cellar seven feet high \Yill be constructed for steam- heater apparatus, bicycle rooms, coal bins, trunk and general storage rooms. The floor in each room and in each hall and the plaster as well will be torn off and hard- wood floors will be laid throughout and the walls will be re-plastered. The replacing of the present wooden stairways with iron ones will leave room for a bathroom in the rear of each section on each floor, giving one bathroom for every four men. The window frames will be changed, one large pane being used in place of the four small ones. Electric lights and steam heat will be put in each room and paper or paint on all the walls. The external parts of the building will be put in first class shape but the appearance will in no wise be changed. The window sills and jambs will remain the same, thereby preserving the names carved on them and at the same time helping to keep alive the sentiment attached to the old building. New doors of modern pattern will be hung, the walls and ceilings, after being re-plastered, will receive th1·ee coats of paint, and all hall, vestibule and bath room floors will be tiled. A picture rail and suitable mouldings will be put in each room, and wherever the plumbing is exposed the pipes will be nickel- plated. The board of trustees, at their meeting in June, passed resolutions gratefully accepting the cffer of the class of '99 and expressed their high appreciation of its generous and loyal feeling. Each suite of rooms can be rented for at least $20 a term or $6o a year to each occu- pant. As there are 22 contemplated suites, this will mean .a total income to the college of at least $2840 per year. This sum assures a con- siderable net income to the college after paying for beat, light and care of rooms. There can be no better investment for the alumni than the construction of habitable dormi- tories, for the better the dormitories, the better will be the class of students almost regardless of the cost or standard of education. The co1nmittee of the class of '99 have not been idle during the summer months and have made headway already. A neat booklet has been printed giving information in regard to theil' plans and containing a cut of the plan of each floor as it will appear when remodelled. These booklets are being sent to the a]umni with a printed slip to be filled in with the. amount each is willing to give and some have ah·eady responded. In the words of this booklet: \If evet·y alum- nus will give as much as he deems he can afford to a project of this kind, and will give that large or little atnount with a free hand and willing heart, the members of the class of '99 of Union college will consider that they have done one duty at least toward their alma mater in calling the attention of the alumni to one of the crying needs of the institution which we all love and cherish.\ The committee consists of the following men : James N. Vander Veer, chairman ; F. R. Champion, secretary; E. W. Strong, W. F. H. Breeze, W. B. Davis, M. M. Price, F. H. We:ston, Jr., A. B. Lawrence, J. Mark, LeRoy T. Eradford, F. H. Fisk, Jr., D. W. Noel, E. LeC. Hegeman, B. E. Huggins, F. Schmitter and Prof. Opdyke. Complete plans of the dormitory as remodelled appear on another page. I I;

The class of I 903, for whom the reception was in a large part held, was largely represented, and besides these were a great many of the other undergraduates. College songs were sung during the evening, and refreshn1ents were ser\Ted in the dining room. The reception furnished a deltghtful opportunity to the class of 1903 for becoming acquainted with the tnen1bers of the faculty and the students, and it was enjoyed by all present. ' ' •

.I· !. I. THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 SUNDAY APTE:QNOON'S SERVICES. Mr. Qobert E. Speer Delivers a Powerful Address. A large audience gathered in the ,chapel on Sunday .afternoon and had the pleasure of listening to Mr. Robert E. Speer, secretary of the Foreign Missionary society of the Presby- terian church, and prominently 'identified with the student volunteer rnovement. Mr. Speer is a graduate of Princeton and while there dis- tinguished himself in athletics, and in scholar- ship he was the second highest man ever graduated from the university, Aaron Burr being the first. Mr. Speer is a young tnan, but has travelled nearly all over the world in the past few years, and this, cotnbined with his natural ability, makes hin1 a speaker well worth hearing. He chose for his theme lying and truth telling -a subject well suited to these, the opening weeks of another college year. There is, he said, an unborn hatred of a lie which shows itself in early childhood even among the heathen. Bv a lie is not tneant tnerely the act of telling a \' falsehood. A man's \-Vhole life tnay be one lie. A lie is never justifiable for God and the truth are so closely linked together that it is impossible to serve one and not the other. We owe a debt to our past not to lie. Each one's reputation is at stake as is also that of his family. We owe it to our present not to lie, and we owe it to our- selves. We owe it to the world and we owe it to Christ. \ Be true to Christ,\ he said, \ for Christ set an example for everyone, and he who does not try to follow in His ways is not true to Him. There is a God within every man, who tells what is right ; and were a man to live according to his conscience he would be true to the past, the present, himself, the world and Christ.\ ''Be true, be true, be true, Hate lies, hate lies, hate lies. '' Harold S. Fiske, 1901, has passed all of his examinations for West Point and is now at the academy. SUMME~ HAUNTS OF THE FACULTY. Nearly all the students and faculty have by this time returned and all are ready for work after vacations spent in various ways and a variety of places. Below is published a list of the different localities where the several m,em- bers of the faculty enjoyed the summer. Dt. Raymond made his headquarters at home but visited a great many neighboring towns and cities in the interest of the college. Dr. vVhitehorne has for several years remained in this city and this summer has been no excep- tion to his custom. Dr. Wells, too, in accordance with his custom, has been spending his sumtner at the University Club House, Lake Placid, where a number of college professors and other literary men meet and associate for the summer. Dr. Perkins enjoyed a few weeks in the North woods but the greater part of the summer he spent in ''Old Dorp.\ Prof. Ashmore spent the summer in Europe. Most of his thne he· was at the Bodleian Library at Oxford, the British Museum at London, and the National Library at Paris. He was especially concerned with the University Extension move- ment at Oxford. Dr. Truax also spent his vacation in Europe and is now on his way home to resume his duties at this college. Profs. Wright; Hoffman, Ripton and Land- reth retnained in the city. Dr. Stoller spent part of his summer with a former instructor at Union, George V. Edwards, at River's Head, Long Island. Prof. Hale, as usual, spent his summer at his father's hotne on Long Island. Profs. Pepper and Walker remained in the city. Inst. Pollard spent his summer in Kenne- bunkport, Maine. The other members of the faculty are either out of town or could not be see_l- in time for this issue. L. M. Blootningdale, 1902, took a trip through Yellowstone Park last summer.

THE new board of editors made its apologies in the commencement number of the paper, so that we are able to spare our readers at this time. Like every other board, we have made many plans for the year's work, but as for the realization of these ideals we have no promises to make. If the publi- . cation has not been what it might have, this state of affairs is partly, at least, due to the lack of support given. Now at the opening of another college year we ask for the hearty cooperation of students, faculty and alumni. To the latter in particular we appeal at this time. Of the three thousand alumni living, less than ten per cent. are readers of The Concordiensis. This condition of affairs should not be. The publication in its new i' ' i f. I.

These are all silent proofs that Old Union has a\vakened from her legarthy, and that her alumui have now are- newed interest and confidence in the old institution. The new Y. M. C. A. hall means not only a hand- some addition to our campns and a cotnmon meet- ing ground for all the students-a centre of under- graduate life heretofore lacking-but it n1eans more. Now that one alutnnus has created a pre- cedent others should follo\v his generous example. The the Hall of Languages, the Science Building, and the new Gymnasium v.:ill not be idle dreams, but stern realities. THE new board of editors made its apologies in the commencement number of the paper, so that we are able to spare our readers at thi8 time. Like every other board, \Ve have made many plans for the year's work, but as for the realization of these ideals we have no promises to make. If the publi- cation has not been what it might have, this state of affairs is partly, at least, due to the lack of support given. Now at the opening- of another college year \Ve ask for the hearty cooperation of students, faculty and almnni. To the latter in particular we appeal at this time. Of the three thousand alumni living, less than ten per cent. are readers of The Concordiensis. This condition of affairs should not be. The publication in it8 new \ ' !

We want you to subscribe, not not out of a sense of duty, but because the invest- ment will be a paying one. A blue pencil mark at the margin of this editoria'I indicates that you are not now a subscriber and that we would be glad to add your name to our mailing list. THE pleasure of seeing new faces and grasping new hands at Old Union makes the heart of every student beat more rapidly. It is a treat to kno·w that what our alma mater has been to us, will not fail to make the same indelible impression on the minds of our new comers. It is many years since Union had the same pleasing look, the same assur~nce in the success of present efforts, and the same bright outlook for the fn ture. A new era has sprung up in the history of the old college, and has brought with it all the freshness of youth. It is very encouraging to note the freedom and ease which the members of 1903 have taken on their first approach at the blue gate. The sacred memories that surround the institution have not failed to raise the spirits of these strangers, and it is our earnest hope that 1903 will do much toward up- holding a high standing in all lines of college work. Besides the deep satisfaction of intellectual advancement, the college offers other branches of work. The athletic side must not be neglected, as the well developed muscle is as potent a factor as the cultured brain in the reputation of a college. Let 1903 come to the front and prove their worth in this all important branch, and so win renown for their alma mater. The literary side is another which has a call upon the students, and it is on.e which, we hope, will receive more attention in tbe coming year than it has in the past. Then there is the college from the religious stand point, which no man can afford to neglect. We are here for advancement intellec- tually, morrally and physically, and he who fails to emphasize any one of these is not getting the full worth of his college course. You who are entering upon your college career must realize that the four years ahead will be just what you choose to make them. In proportion as you enter into the several branches of student enterprise, just to that degree will college return the benefits which it offers. In the name of the students, The Concordiensis bids you a hearty welcome and expresses hope that your connection with Union may be alike a benefit to yourselves and an honor to the dear old institution we love so well. THE CANE ~USH. Freshmen Win by a Narrow Margin. The campus was the scene Monday afternoon of one of the liveliest encounters that have yet taken place. The usual preparations of salt and tomatoes were carried out during the day, and despite the disagreeable weather everything pointed to a good contest. Both classes turned out the majority of their members, but in point of numbet·s the freshmen had the advantage, the ratio being about three to two in their favor. The preliminary meetings were held at two o,clock-the sophomores assembling in the chapel, and the freshmen in the North college . At three o'clock the sophs came forth with a shout and took a position on the catnpus to await the frosh. Presently the new class-yell rang across the field, the opponents met and the battle was on. For ten minutes the air was alive with fruit and salt, until Refet·ee Fenton threw the greased '' bone of contention\ into the midst of the struggling mass. Then the argument be- caine a heated one, which was strongly con- tested on both sides. At the call of time, the number of hands were counted and the referee proclaimed the freshmen victors by a score of ten to nine. A shout of joy from the frosh followed the announcement, and after futile eflorts on their part to form a parade, and the affair became a thing of the past.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS. FOOTBALL P~OSPECTS. The Schedule of Games For the Season. At the beginning of the football season the prospects for a good team, while not of the brightest, are still of a much more encouraging nature than they were at the same time last year. The eleven has lost every man behi~d the line but on the contrary has five veterans 1n the line. ~everal disappointments have n1et the n1anagement thus far. Mallery, Gulnac and Keogh, our crack trio of backs, have all le~t college, while Willis will be unable to enter h1s class until the latter part of October. A good amount of promising tnaterial in the new class, however, coupled with some developed last fall, it is hoped will fill the vacant positions in a satisfactory manner. Captain Fenton has had a large number of candidates out on the gridiron throughout the week and Coach Pollard and he have been working hard to round thetn out in good shape. Among the more prominent can- didates the following may be mentioned: Fenton, Finnegan, Carver, Thebo, Dunning, Shaw, Paige, Slack, Best, Weed, Woolworth, Bahler, Hawkes, Anderson, Acheson, Griffith, Welles, 1903 ; Dickinson, 1903 ; Hoxie, 1903; Robinson, 1900; Peck, 1903; Griswold, 1903; Donnan, 1903; and Parker, 1903. Manager MacCulloch has arranged a good schedule of games for both the 'varsity and scrub elevens. The schedule may possibly have one or two changes in the near future, at present it is as follows : Sept. jo. R. P. I. at Schenectady. Oct. 7· Columbia at Albany. Oct. 14. Williams at Williamstown. Oct. r8. Amherst at Amherst. Oct. z8. Wesleyan at New York. Nov. 4· Colgate at Schenectady. N Ham ilton at Schenectady. ov. I I. N 24 Hoba rt at Schenectady. ov. . Clarence T. Lansing of Gloversville visited friends at the college last week. MODEQN BIBLE STUDY. \The Bible,\ as the Greek signifies, is not one book but a whole library in itself. In one small volume which can be carried in the pocket or hand, is bound all the classic liter- ature of one of the world's greatest peoples. But a high price has been paid for this compact- ness, for it has destroyed the whole literary structure of the Scriptures. Modern scholarship, appreciating the beauty of the ancient literature of the Bible, has given it to us in its true literary form and structure. This has been accomplished to a large extent through the efforts of Prof. Richard G. Moulton, who has published ·a series of books called the \Modern Reader's Bible.\ Prof. Moulton's great aim has been to present the different parts of the Bible in the literary setting in which they first appeared. Where the writing is dran1atic, natnes of speakers and divisions of speeches are given; where essays occur titles are attached to them; the great lyric poems are presented in their true literary form ; history is distinguished from story, and the great orations are printed in their connected form. The text is that of the Revised Versions and all questions of author- ship are excluded from the work. During the last two years Dr. Truax has con- ducted a large class of students in a course of study based on Prof. Moulton's work. The text-book used was \Biblical Masterpieces,\ and the work for last year was on Isaiah and was most interesting. Isaiah was found to be an orator of wondrous power, who had at his command the whole annory of rhetoric. It has been said that no more precious legacy of thought has come down to us than the conception of Isaiah of a golden age to come. The classic thought of Greece and Rome took an opposite course. Their golden age was in the remote past. But to the corruption and discouragement around him Isaiah holds up a picture of a glorious future to follow a purifying judgment. He was the great prophet-statesman of his time, and dealt with all the problems of his age. Many of them were the same as those that perplex nations : r l I l I I· I ~ I·. tod bri1 nes ful on hisj . tn : ges I spe by Mo of 1 Trt '] by for' pre: of J l 1 . spu Nor Uni the H.: E. 1 Hul At J Chr all c . an 11 was one~ T who Am~ Mot P.

THE 0'0NCORDIENSIS. 13 today. Some of the questions he treats of are bribery ; unjust judgment ; oppression ; drunken- ness; usury; anarchy; short-sighted and deceit- ful diplomacy; and ideal statesmanship, based on the moral principles taught by Jewish history, and looking toward a union of nations in a movement toward a world-civilization sug- gested by the victories of Cyrus. Isaiah's wonderful oratorical powers as he speaks on these problems are frequently obscured by the ordinary text, but with the aid of the Modern Reader's Bible and especially by means of the clear and forceful explanations of Dr. Truax, they appear with great strength. The past year's work was highly appreciated by the members of the class, and they look forward with pleasure to the course for the present college year, which will be the Drama of Job. G. ERNEST RAITT, 1900. UNION AT THE NORTHFIELD CON- FERENCE. The student conference for Bible study and spiritual uplifting was held as usual at East Northfield, Mass., from June 30 to July g. Union was as usual represented, this year by the following delegates: W. D. Brown, 1900; H. B. Jones, 1900; E. L. Winterberg, r9oo; E. M. Sanders, 1900; S. S. Read, 1900; L. T. Hubbard, 1900; and Frazer Metzger, 1902. At Northfield students are thrown in touch with Christian men from all denominations and from all colleges, which in itself cannot help but be an inspiration, and the conference this summer was fully as successful as have been previous ones. The speakers of the conference were men who need no introduction into the college world. Among them were : Robert E. Speer, John R. Mott, D. L. Moody, H. P. Beach, Robert P. vVilder, Rev. R. A. Torrey, and Rev. J. Wilber Chapman. Gardiner Kline, I 901, spent a month at Hono- lulu this past sumn1er. FIQST COLLEGE MEETING. Training ~ules Adopted and Money Sub- scribed for Football. An enthusiastic college meeting, the first of the year, took place on Monday morning. Prof. Pollard explained the first business of the day, the adoption of a fixed set of training rules. Formerly the captain has been allowed to ·use his discretion in regard to the conduct of his men and this fact has been conducive to a decided lack of regularity in the men's system of training. The strict enforcement of the new rules which l1e suggested and which were unanimously approved, will, however, insure a uniformity in the men's system of training, will improve it and will at the same time give the captain no option in carrying out the regula- tions. On the adoption of the resolutions, Captain Fenton rose and was greeted with a storm of cheers. He told of the plans for the season and gave a very encouraging opinion in regard to the situation. The rules adopted are as follows : 1. In no case shall any member of a team in- dulge in tobacco or intoxicating liquors, except when latter is prescribed by physicians. 2. Members of teams shall be in their rooms at or before eleven o'clock at night. 3. Under no conditions shall members of teams attend dances or be out after ten o'clock on nights before games. 4. Members of teams shall report promptly for practice each day, and in case of inability to be present, shall report same to captain. 5. On trips members of teams shall promptly acknowledge the dictation of the captain and manager in regard to ''turning in, '' ''sight seeing,\ etc. 6. It shall be the duty of the captain to remove a member from the team after two violations of these rules. The next business of the meeting was the matter of subscriptions toward the financial support of the team. Mr. Pollard called for cash at first and soon secured one hundred and ·· fifty dollars in greenbacks. Pledges were then
