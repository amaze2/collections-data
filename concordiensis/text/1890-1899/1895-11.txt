It 1nust b@ · remembered that Princeton has one of the sti·ong- est tearr1s on the field, and if Union can l1old the score down to 22, we think there is nothing to be complained of. The tean1 is doing excellent work. THE CROSS-COUNTRY runs have been started, and if any one intends to try for a position on the t1·ack team he should go on every one.

THE S'rUDEN'l'S are greatly indebted to Dr Ray- mond for giving them a recess on Monday before election day so those who could 111ight go home · and vote. Those who could vote, and many that could not, availed themselves of the opportunity. Dr. Raymond is always doing whatever he can to u1ake the life of the students an enjoyable one, and they all appreciate it .. THE LIBRARY should be open on such days as last Monday of all days. For it is in these recesses of one or two days that the students n1ost desire to use the library to read up for essays or for regular reference work. It has been the regular policy of the college to close the library at such times, and it has ahvays caused a great deal of dissatisfaction an1ong the students. When there is no regular studying to be done, it is the thue the students most wish to use the library; and it is a great hardship to always find the doors locked. This matter should be attended to, and the students should be given a chance to use their library when they have the tiine.

THE OONOORDIENSIS. 11 AT THE last college Ineeting there was a con1- . n1ittee appointed t0 ·confe1· -with the faculty on the , subject of having lights put in the sections. This 1 i,s one of the first itldngs that should be attended • to ; it is a great inconvenience and really dan- , gerous for a person to go up and dovvn stairs in · the sections on a dark nig:h t, as it is irnpossible · to see anything.. The students have taken this · rnatter in hand, .and it shoald be pushed through. EVERYONE will be pleased. to see in this issue · an article fron1 the pen of Dr. Wells on ''Echoes of the Centennial.'' Dr. WeUs' ·articles are always both interesting and instructive, and a better authority on the subject tl1at he ha.s chosen could not have been found, As ·chahu1an of the coin- Inittee on the Centennial ])inner he showed an unsurpassable ablity, and bis work on other .conl- Iuittees added g:ueatly to t;he successful .carrying out of the whole order of exercises. Not only in . this undertaking, but in evt€r .other, he has shown · his loyalty to Old Union, and he will ever be re- llletnbered as ont.J of her h·uest sons. Long live '' Uncle Billy ! \ the pleasure that ,comes from the rnerry dance drowns everything else.

His Utterances at Cl1atta11ooga P1·aised by a Leading Southern Ne-wspaper. The Atlanta Constitutlon, of Sept. 19, said.: General Butte1·:field's speech yesterday at Chat- tanooga, in response to the call of the veterans for '' General Hooke1· and his Arn1y,\ was an eloquent and a patriotic address. The General himself aided in n1aking history at Chattanooga, and he spoke with soldierly feeling of the heroic leaders who ·Confronted one another on the famous battlefield. His tribute to Hooker's pluck, audacity and strategy was a deserved one, and he spoke as appreciatively of the Confederate counnanders. He gave them full credit :for ability and courage, and spoke of the brilliant strategy A MATTER vvhich ought to be attended to, and attended to at once, is tha,t of the library being open on tirne, especially .Ln. the afternoon. As posted on the door the tirne for opening is at two o'clock, but severa.l times within the last week the library has not been opened until an hour later. This is a great in:eonvenien.ce to the students. for they expect it .to be open on thne, .and they go around only to :find the doors locked.. Besides losing n1uch valuable tirne -they have the pleasure of standing around until some one cor11es. This iH a serious matter, and it :should receive the iut- lllediate attention_ of the JVerson who has such 111atters in charge. , and tactics of that great cornn1ander, General Joseph Johnston, the courage and skill of Long- street, the vigor and force and soldierly qualities of Bragg, Hood, Stewart, Cleburne and others, THE SOCIAL season at lJnion was forrnany . opened by the first Junior- hop Friday evening, October 25. The hops this year will occur at intervals of abou i three weeks, and the s.eries will close with a Juniol' \pron1 which will occur just before or after Lent. We wish to impress upon the students, and especially the new rnen, the benefits that are to be derived from attending · these hops and soeial gathe:l'ings in general. After a hard week's work at oJt:e's studies and other duties, there is no n1ore helpful and enjoyable · recreation than is f o be found at one of these hops. H er·e one forgets all his cal 1 8S and anxieties, and ' . and said that to rnention all of them would be aln1ost to read the Confederate roster. l-Ie ex- pressed his gratitude over the fact that the Federal laurels are not tinged with bitterness, . n:taligity or unkind feelings, and that both sides are now reunited under one flag, harn1oniously, shaping the destinies of one country. General Butterfield's patriotic words will make hin1 as popular with the old Confederates as he is with the Ar1ny of the Cun1berland, of which he was one of the bravest leaders. It was in the speech .above referred to that Gen- ei·al Butterfield, in speaking of Hooker, said: \Lee was never outflanked when opposing forces were equal, save when Hooker commandedagainst bin1.\ Also that '' Hool\.er two weeks in advance designated Gettysbu1·gas the place for that battle.'' It was privately reported at the time that the plan by which Lee was outflanked in Hooker's crossing before Chancellorsville was the same sug· gested by Butterfield at Burnside's council of war, whe1·e Butterfield, as junior, gave the first opinion.

12 T·HE OONOORDIENSIS. oh I come befo11e them, and then called upon the · ve P. pl]a proui:r]Ge ~OI)V~l)tiOQ of pl]i . chainnan of :the com.mittee on crede·ntials for a The Ne·w York Beta Beta Chapter of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity entertained the Alpha • Province Convention here in this city on Thurs- · day and Friday, Ootoher 3 r and November L : This province includes the New England States, , New York and PeNnsylvania, and while all the · chapters in these States are comparatively young to those of other provinces, vet it can now : rightly be considered one of~ the strongest. , Many of the delegates arrived on Wednesday, and they continued to arrive all day Thursday ; I the president of the province told our reporter . that it was the largest convention of this province I since his adtninistration, which is equivalent to ''ever held.'' This ·is due undoubtedly more or · less to the attractioR that \ Old Union\ always . holds out to college rnen in general, and the curiosity and interest of the visitors was skown by their visit to tl1e college grounds on Thurs- day morning and. they evidently appreciated very highly the opportunity to see \ Union\- the home of Greek Letter Fraternities. The opening session was held Thursday afternoon at 2 : 30 <1' clock in the halls of the local chapter in the Fuller ·Builing on State Street. The Rev. Walter H. Waygood, pastor of the East Avenue Presbyterian Church of this city, invoked divine blessing upon the proceed- ings of the convention, after which Mr. Walter L. Terry, president of the ~hapter at Union, delivered an address of welcon1e replete with that warm fraternal expres'sion so characteristic ofhim. Mr. J .. Cla1·k Moore, Jr., of Philadel- phia, president of the province, responded on · behalf of the delegates, and very appropriately expressed the honor which they felt upon being entertained in convention at Union College, the birth place of so rnany honored fraternities, and particularly that of the pioneer K. A. At the conclusion of his address he appointed the various cotnmittees of the convention, and then declared a short recess for their organization. When the convention was recalled to order he briefly rehearsed the business which was to report, who announced that all the chapters of the province were represented with three excep- tions. The president then called for reports of the delegates as to their respective chapters, which cortSl!Uned the remainder of the afternoon session. Tl1:ey were most gratifying in every particular, and it eertainly speaks well for such a young province to have .eight of tbe thirteen chapters represented living in houses. If any of the1n were to be particularly noted as of especial interest, we would mention Mr. H. W. Slater, of Cornell, who announced that their new chapter house was under roof and ·would be ready fo.t· occupancy in the spring. The greatest encouragetnent wag brought out in the reports frorn Syracuse, Amherst, Williatns, University of Vennont, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania and Lehigh, all of which are comfortably housed. JYfr. C. E. Zeigler, hom Dickinson, showed the thriving condition of his chapter by announcing that by another year they would have erected on the campus .at Dickinson a handson1e lodge, the first of the · soci~ties of that institution. The other reports, including that of Mr. H. M. West, of the local chapter, gave evidence of the very n1arked · advance upon all lines which characterized the others. All tnatters which were to be referred to the Grand Council at the National Convention next year for final decision, but upon which action was necessary by Alpha province, were brought up and disposed of at the evening session. Friday morning they were again assembled at 9 : 30, at whkh session only provincial matters were discussed. In the afternoon the delegates and metnbers of the lo~al chapter met at Talbot's Studio, where the group was photographed. They were then conducted to the works of the General Electr~c Company, where the afternoon was spent, but the plant had so much attraction for them that the vi~it seemed altogether too short. President Raymond, assisted by the members .and ladies of the faculty, tendered them a recep- tion at his home at 8 : 30 in . the evening, and

Eta, was called upon to propose a toast to the \ Psi Girls,\ and it was not hard to see that he knew whereof he spoke. The next Province Convention is to be held at Brown University. and therefore the delegate, Mr. G. F. Greene, of R. I.

The Detnocratic notninee for tnayorof Albany, John Boyd T'hatcher, favors retnoving Union to Albany. If he is elected, he is ready to lead the representative citizens of Albany in the moven1ent to secure a large appropriation frotn the State to unite our whole university at Albany. When notified of his notnination for mayor last Tuesday by a cotnn1ittee of Albanians, he said: ''Much remains to be accotnplished for the advancetnent and prosperity of our city. Its affairs must be tnanaged intelligently and economically. Among many new projects which invite our attention is one of immediate importance. The united newspaper press of the city has inaugurated a 1novernent to· bring to Albany Union College. This is an old and honorable educational institution. Its law, medical and scientific departtnents are already in Albany. Its acaden1ic halls are in Schenec- tady. If the entire college were located here, it would bring to the city probably not less than 1 ,coo students. ''Albany is admirably prepared to offer an. . adequate site on the south, north and west ends, and each tnay vie with each in aspirit of friendly emulation in securing the location of this great · university. That which benefits a part of our city will benefit the whole. Our rnerchants, storekeepers, proprietors of boarding-houses and citizens generally should unite in this endeavor. If the journals which have unanirnously ad- vocated the removal of Union College will sug- gest some plan of action, I will, should I becotne the chief magistrate, do all in my power to carrv it into execution.\ Ex-Mayor Thatcher, . of Alhany, evidently has the good interests of \ Old Union\ at heart, and should be elected next mayor of Albany he vvill not forget our college or university.

A glance at a chart of the world shows that tl-1e canal line lies in direct route between Liverpool and Mel- bourne, Australia, Hong K-ong, China, the East Indies and Japan, with, an advantage in distance of at least 2,500 mBes.

There are four good nets now on the couuts, and the probabiliites are that they will remain out all winter.

THE ARTICLE by Henry D. Merchant, '93_, con- cel·ning facts taken frorn a lecture by ,.(;Father'' ,V. G. Brown, '95, is a very interesting one. It is carefully prepared, and gives one an e::xact repre- sentation of the state of things connectel with the great canal which is as yet unfinished. The n1an who is practically at the head of the €nterprise, Warner Miller, is a Union man, and he :expects to see the canal finished. We .are sure the article will be of interest to all. WE WER~J very glad to see an. increa.se in the · nun1ber of students at the last Junior hop. These hops are a college institution, and w hila we do not advocate a strict exclusion of every ()De except students, we think the students ought io be in a great majority a,t them. They are a g:rea t aid to the student in n1any ways, and if once a person gets into the habit of going, he can g~t a great deal of enjoyn1ent out of the111. 'The Ia.st hop was an excellent one, and a person could not help having a good thne. At the neKt one,. which is to be given on Deceu1ber 13, we hope t() see a still greater increase in the number of studen-ts. THE RESULT of the game with Williams in Albany on Saturday, Nov. 10, was a disappointn1ent. which we 1nake no atten1pt to conceal. No one ques- tions that the superiority of our tean1 was shown in the first half, or as long as opportunity was afforded for real foot-ball. The fact that the second half was pla.yed in the dark made it any- thing but a trial of skill, and opened the way for serious misunderstandings. We appreciate the difficulties that beset the referee. When it was · hard to see the ball a few yards away, and we cannot question hi:s desire to deal fairly with both sides, but two of his decisions at least were in such direct opposition to the rules governing the game that it is only natural we should feel that we are suffers, either through his ignorance of the rules or his confusion of milld ~ critical moments. If it were only a question of judgment, no reference whatever would be made by us to these decisions, · but there is no unreasonable complaint in our claims that had the accepted rules been followed the final score would have been materially different. 'THE CoNCORDIENSIS has been obliged to drop the four extra pages that were added to the paper · a few weeks ago, and for this reason : When we made the addition it was for the purpose of giving the graduate depart1nents of the U nivers1ty a representation, believing that they would appre- . ciate it enough to give the paper in return some support, if not very much. We have tried every means to get the students of the Medical and Law departments interested, and our representatives there have worked hard and earnestly for the same result, but there seetns to be no enthusiasm at all concerning the matter. Out of both de- partments with a list of students numbering about 300 we have five paid subscriptions. Ever since the present Senior Class has been in college, and we do not know long before, there has been a constant cry from the Albany departments for a . closer relationship between the college and them- · selves. The college, too, desires it, and that fact to a great degree led us to suppose that we would receive the support of the Albany departments. As we said in a forn1er issue, we hoped THE CoN- CORDIENSIS would be able, by giving them a · representation, to draw all the parts of the uni- versity into a closer relationship and establish a fraternal bond that would be lasting. We tried the plan, and when the Medical and Law depart- ments were called upon to give us their support, they refused. It is well enough to talk about a closer relationship, and all that, but as long as they will not support a University organ it cannot and will not con1e. We regret very much that we will not be able to continue to run the fou1· extra pages, for we realize that it makes the paper won- derfully better, but if we did so, it would be at a great loss to us. We shall, however, try to make up in quality what we have dropped in quantity, and we think we can do so. We shall give the graduate departments some space, for we feel that it is to the int~rest of the University to do so ; but hereafter they will not be represented as before.
