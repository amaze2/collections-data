THE CoNCORDIENSIS. VoL. XVII. UNION COLLEGE, FEBRUARY 14, 1894. No. g. REV. A. V. V. RAYMOND, D. D., A(}cepts the Presidency of Union, and There is ReJoicing on the Campus. Seldom, if ever· before, has an An1erican College President been called to the presi- dential office with such absolute unanin1ity of voice and sentiment as that which on 1'ues- day last summoned the Rev. Dr. A. V. V. Raymond to the presidency of Union College. Not onlv did he receive the unanin1ous vote \ of the Board of Trustees, in the largest n1.eet- ·ing held for years, but the selection has ,rnet with the spontaneous and enthusiastic ap- proval of the faculty, alun1ni and under- graduates. The eminent and natural fitness o~ the young Albany clergyn1an for this re- sponsible office seems to have impressed itself upon the rninds of all Union College n1en with the force of an inspira6on. san1e position in 1874 as in I 894, and the ball was driven through one of Professor Perkins' windows in South Colonnade. After graduating from the N r.:.w Bruns\vick Theological Sen1inary, Dr. Ray1nond preached in Congregation churches at Plainfield, N. J ., and New Brunswick, ~· J. Five years ago he was called to his present pastorate, that of the Fourth Presbyterian church of Albany, N. Y., where he has since labored \vith \Vonder- ful success, declining many flattering calls to other churches and institutions. He received the degree of D. D. in 1886. And revv Van Vranken Rayn1ond \vas born in,central New York thirty-nine years ago, and is, \vith one exception, the youngest man ever elected to the presidency of Union Col- lege. The exception was Dr. Eli phalet N ott, who was elected (like\vise fron1 a Presbyterian pastorate in Albany) at the age of thirty-one, The President-elect is a graduate of Union, class of I 87 5, and has ever since his gradua- tion been actively and zealously interested in the advancen1ent of the interests of the insti- tution. He stood high in his class at his graduating and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society, which is at Union, as else- where, a n1ark of the highest classical and literary attainn1en t. A qualification which especially endears hinl to the undergraduates . is the fact that he was in college a splendid athlete, and while playing a match gan1e of . ball \Vith a rival college, made a tren1endous . strike \vhich not only saved the game, but established a record for long-distance batting . which has never been beaten to this day on a college diamond, and probably not in base ball history. The students of to-day can better guage this wonderful strike, \Vhen it is explained that the hotne plate was in the . and served sixty-two consecutive years in the executive office. Tl~e call of Dr. Rayn1ond's abna 1natcr therefore comes to him in the plenitude of his physical powers and in the ripening n1aturity of his great intellectual forces. I-I is character and his training have alike fitted hin1 for the presidential office. He is a born leader of men,-brilliant, ener- getic, resourceful, enthusiastic- and possess- ing withal a winning personality which at- tracts friends and holds tht:n1 as by hooks of steel. He is modest, yet self-reliant; original, yet not erratic; a n1an of firm and settled convictions, yet \vith a tnind so broad and a heart so big and kindly as to embrace n1en of all opinions and beliefs under a tnantle of tolerance and charity. Dr. Raymond is a preacher of rare force and eloquence, and a pastor whose ministrations have endeared hin1 to all his people. He has a ready wit and a versatile comtnand of facile yet vigorous Eng-

H~is speech at the Holland Society i dinner a fe\v \veeks since convinced old New York diners-out that a new star had appeared in the firn1ament of after-dinner oratory. It \Vas pronounced by all who heard it as the speech of the evening. Dr. Rayn1ond is a natural educator, having a generous sympathy with young men, together with that rare quality of being able by personal contact to stimulate their an1hitions and ele- vate their aspirations. Already the students · of Union know and love him, and his accept- \ ance of the trust will be hailed with delight by every undergraduate. I-le has also the respect and affection of the faculty, n1any of i whom \vere his o\vn instructors, while as Presi- ! dent of the General Alutnni Association for the last four years no alun1nus is better known to the great body of Union graduates through- out the land than Dr. Rayrnond. With Presi- dent Webster, \vho, by reason of the in1pair- ment of his health, retires after five years of : excellent service for the college, his rf' lations are especially cordial and inti rna te. With Dr. Rayn1ond's acceptance of the presidency \Old Union\ will start out next year upon her second century of existence ) with every augury of a future n1ore brilliant and successful than even under the adnlinis- tration of Presidents N ott and Webster. R. C. A. ----------·- ------ --------- ----·---- ------------ --- SEC\RET OF S.Ucc~ESS. On Tuesday afternoon, Jan. 30, Dr. ,(has. D. Nott, of the class of '54, delivered a most interesting and profitable lecture on ''Secret of Success.\ In opening, Dr. Nott said, \lle is wise that recognizes the truth and acts upon it. It is a terrible thing and one that never pays, for a man to be less, and to be content to be less, than his possibilities would have entitled hin1 to be.'' The speaker took for the key note of his lecture the word~, ''Time and chance happeneth to them all.\ He said that God sends a chance to every man, it is God's business. And it is our busi- ness to be re(:l.dy for those chances. And \voe to that man who is not ready at the tin1e appointed.

The registration for the several prizes to be awarded at commencernent was held in the English roon1, the first Monday of the tnonth. Prof. Truax said he had one or two in1oortant .L announcements to make, and that the first was in regard to the prize kno\Yn as \The Veeder.\ He said that for eight years Dr. Veeder, of Schenectady, had given this prize of fifty dollars for the encouragetnent of ex- temporaneous speaking, but circumstances were such that the Doctor had been obliged to withdraw his offer. But the Faculty were unvvilling that this prize should be dropped and so the matter was brought before that enthusiastic alumnus, R. C. Alexander, and he immediately volunteered to continue the prize, with the same conditions as before. So this prize will be known hereafter as the \ Alexander Prize.\ The next announcement was that hereafter all prize essays must be type-written. This is rendered necessary by the difficulty ex- perienced in securing the right men to act as judges where so much Hn1e has to be spent in readitlg tnanuscripts. The prizes and those registered for them are as follows: I nghatn prize for that Senior 'vho shan offer the best essay on one or t\VO subjects in English Literature or History.

BRAIN ANU MUSCLE. February 9th occurred the sixteenth lecture in the Butterfield course. It \Vas delivered by Dr. Wtn. A. Hammond on \Brain. and Muscle.!' 1'he spE'aker \Yas introduced by Gen. Daniel Butterfield, who stated that the purpose of the course of lectures \vas to enable the students to learn something that could not be learned in books. So.mething practical; from rnen who have n1ade their tnark in the vvorld. Dr. Han1mond said: \There are three points necessary- to be grasped in order to obtain a clear understanding of the lecture : I. There are nerve centers to provide force. 2. Nerves to transn1it that force. 3· Muscles to mani- fest it. Muscles are useless unless there is so.tnething to excite force. This is done by the gray matter of the brain and spinal cord. The white substance of the nervous systen1 is by far the largest part, but tnerely the servant of the gray ; receiving and transmitting its tnessages. The brain is not ·the only originator of n1otion. But there are abundant exatnples to prove that quite extensive force can be exerted even after the head has been removed· Evidently then there is a force that comes from the spinal cord. So there are two·kinds of physical exercise, one in which the whole n1ind is occupied and another that is merely mechanical. Then what a very stupid thing physical exercise for the mere sake of exercise is. We struggle ~vi:th Indian clubs and lifting machines 'varran:ted to bring every n1uscle into action. I--I ovv much better vvould be a day spent in hunting ·0 ran hour in \valking atnid ne\V sights and .sce111 es where the tnind could ever be employed. Nothing can be n1ore be.neficial than to en- gage in athfetic contests that involve an ap- plication of mental effort. For this reason such .exercise as fencing and sparring are par .. ticularly to be recon1 n1ended. And especially that of fencing. Nothing gives one such a graceful bearing and gesture ; such a keen eye and quick: perception of the intentions of others as the n~an ly sport of fencing. l~xeroise keeps the mind fron1 rusting. Therefore it should not be a n1overnent of the muscles only, but of the tnind as well. There is no record of a great athlete being a tnan of great tn,ind. vVe don't go to the prize ring for the presidents of our colleges. The man who uses up all his nerve force in merely contracth1g his muscles \vill likely not have enough left for other etn ploy men ts.\ THE KIRMESS. The [(.irmess which is to be given under the auspices of the Children's Home and the Athletic Association of the college, vvill be presented in the Van Curler opera house Gn the afternoons and evenings of February 26, 27 and z8. It \vill be a very brilliant affair, given on a large scale, as over three hundred . persons will take part. Sixteen spectacular dances and fancy drills, beautifully costumed, \Viil be given under the beautiful effect of changing colors of a calciutn light. The affair will be directed by Captain Charles W. Eddy, of Hoosic Falls, 'vho has had much experience in entertain tnents of this kind. The executive committee consists of MrsM DeRer11.er, Mrs. Westinghouse, Mrs. DeCamp, Mrs. G~ibson, Mrs. Yelverton, Mrs. Truax and Mrs. McQueen. Capt. Charles W. Eddy is conducting the rehearsals.

All men who intend to con1 pete in these events should register and train in order that class cotnpetition vvill be sharp and points close. The undergraduate dinner should be at- tended by all the students \vho can possibly be there. It is a college affair and should be n1arked by the college spirit and enthus- iasn1 which characterizes Union gatherings. The acceptance of the presidency of Union by Dr. Raytnond \Vas hailed with delight by those who have been anxiously awaiting his decision. A majority of the students already know our president-elect, and for those who have n~t had that pleasure it \vill not take long to form the acquaintance of a man so genial and pleasant. We are confident that D·r. Raymond already has a large place in the hearts of the students and will receive a hearty welcome. The minstrels have come and gone but the entertainments given by the \dusky and horny handed sons of toil \ were a decided success. The troupe gave good perfonnances cals at Union. We have learned through various sources that the people in this city think that out of the receipts of the rninstrel sho·w given last week, n1ore ought to have gone to the poor. It seems that out of the total an1ount taken in, only about $so went for charitable pur- poses. Now, the facts of the case are these. When the project \vas first undertaken in January, everything seemed againist the c0n1- n1ittee. The Edison \Vorks and the Locon1o- tive ·works were both closed, and if the show \Vas to have support it was to come from the richer class of people. The conunittee had nothing to gain if it \Vas a success, and every- thing to lose if it was a failure. To rid them- selves of as much responsibility as possible, they consented to pay fifty per cent of the receipts to the opera house. This is where most of the money \vent. There was also a great expense connected with the entertain- ment besides, including costutnes, music and an instructor for the past four \veeks. We think if the people will look at it in this light they \vill see their mistake. Not a cent ot the money \vent into the pockets of any one connected vvith the entertainn1ent ; and it is unjust to the college as well as to the students involved to intin1ate any such thing. \How did your son do at college last year, M W 'lk' ? \ rs. · 1 1ns . \Very \vell, indeed.

THE CoNCORDIENSIS. VoL. XVII. UNION CO~LLEGE, FEBRUARY 28, 1894. No. ro. 'MODERN SCIE~N,.ii;FIIC INV:ESTH~ATIONS. In the discussio·tl of any branch. of science, one soon realizes the difficulty and almost impossibility of eHn1inating entirely that \vhich is technica 1'. Technical terms at times are the only ones which adequately express a rneaning. The:r1 again, frequent use has taken a\vay the strangeness, and unconsciously he who makes a speda:lty of scienti:fic investi- gations cotnes to regard then1' as fan1iliar to the people at large. Fortunate indeed \rill I consider n1yself, if it be possible to convey at least certain general notion_s or ideas of the I tnethods of mod ern research work. I A la\V in general has beP.n defined as a \ rule of action 'vhich is prescribed by son1c superior and tvhich an inferior is bound to obey.\ Nat ural Lavvs are those in accord with \:vhich, n1aUer v:vas created, \vhich lirnit and control its ex~isten ce and behavior. As for instance the La\Y of Gravitation, by \vhich every body in th.e universe attracts every other; or the t ... a w of the Conservation of Energy, ·which affirms that the nature of thE' force n1ay be c:banged without any diminu- tion, as \vben by chemical action the latent energy of the coa:r and air is changed to heat, fron1 heat to e'lectricity, and then from elec- tricity to light. A natural l.avv must be universal and co-- existent 'vith rnatter itself. By \universal\ is not to be u~d erstood that it is to apply to all n1atter, but rather all of that particular character of w11ich the law is affirn1ed, as when we say that one of the properties of iron is its expansion w l1en heated. This would be a natural law of iron but not necessarily of aU 1 other suLstan<:es. In fact \Ve kno\v that \Vater I at certain ten1peratures contracts instead of I expands under heat. . 1 N O\V the object or purpose of the investi- : gator is to discover, first, facts which tend to sho\v the existence of some law ; second, to deduce that la\v, and third, to verify it by other facts dh·ectly or indirectly connected with it. The object \vhich is so often overlooked is not the n1ere accumulation of material, but rather the proper treatrnent of such material . as \Vell as its judicious accun1ulation. vVhen a new con1et or satellite is discovered it is het~alded through our ne\vspapers, and straightway he who ha.s n1ade the discovery comes to be regarded as one of our great astronomers, when in fact from the very nature of the \Vork it requires no great train- ing or knowledge, and what is more, no great n1ental effort. A few years ago in one of our large obser- vatories, one of the assistants detern1ined to discover a con1et. In order to discover a cotnet, by the \Vay, all that is required of a man is to take a short focused telescope of four or five inches aperture, and gradually sweep the heavens back and forth until he happens on son1e suspicious object which may be either a con1et or a nebula. If it be a comet it will gradually change its position with reference to the surrounding telescopic field, if a nebula it \vill remain stationary. Well, as the story goes, this assistant after trying patiently for about three n1onths, de- cided that he could spend his ti n1e to better advantage. The janitor of the institution \vho had watched the process occasionally, asked pennission to continue the search. On the second night he discovered a comet. 'That time has long since gone by, when great and lasting discoveries can be rnade without both the proper preliminary training of the investigator and the steady, patient toil over the details of the work.

Thorough- ness and accuracy are the essent~al features. Work done in the san1e manner in which it \Vas done even a hundred years ago, \vouhl bring upon the investigator the n1ost hutnilia t- ing criticism. Science as \Ve know it is the prcduct of n1odern thought. The Ancients had but a very superficial knowledge of only the n1ost apparent phenomena of nature. \IVith the revival of learning, the invention of the tele- scope, and the extension of mathematics, the entire field \vas so changed that no longer could the military splendor of a Rome or Greece restrain; no longer a dissolute, bigoted, and intolerant priesthood of the n1iddle ages opiJress. Although born an1id such surroundings, nurtured \Vith such care, its triun1ph was nevertheless so con1plete that both philoso- phies and theologies have fallen before it. It ; has given us a truer, clearer, nobler concep- tion of our God. Ofttimes I have pictured to my fancy that house \where says lVIilton, \I found and visited the famous Galileo, grown old, a prisoner of the Inquisition, for thinking on astronotny, otherwise than as the Dominican and Franciscan licensers thoue-ht.\ Here U' ' blind in his old age, a prisoner of the I nq uisi- tion, but still tenderly cared for by the loving affection of his daughter, he lingers forth his last days. \Veep not, Oh learned sage ! \7\ ou have seen what no other n1ortal has seen. H-ang up your rough tube, it has done its work \\-'elL The truth has gone forth, they can no n1ore . restrain it than they can stop the fto\v of the , n1ighty Tiber. . .l\bout a century and a half letter, in 174-1, with the English .1\_stronotner Bradley, began another epoch, a new period in instrun1ental astronon1y. The accuracy of his observations led to the discovery of nutation and aberra .. tion of light. To use the hotnely illustration of Bradley hilllself, \with a gun barrel and a cart wheel for instrun1ents he could n1ake better observations than had ever been n1ade before.\ And in thus characterizing the pre- vious instrumental work, he was not far from the truth. I have no wish to belittle in any way these edrly .efforts. A man tnust be judged not sirnply by his \vork but also by his surroundings, by the age in which he lives. Let us consider what constitutes a good observer. He should know thoroughly the s ubj ect which he is in v e sti gating. It is a hn o s t .absolutely necessary for hin1 to have read ,everything that has been done before in that particular line. I-Ie will profit by the rnistakes and failures of others, and \vill also avoid an unnecessary duplication of \Vork. Such tirnc is well spent. 'rhe ·want of a proper founda- tion has in so tnany cases, led to failure aud lack of recognition fron1 the scientific world. A \Vord right here to n1y fellow amateur, let not he who \vishes to contribute, think for a n1ornent that he possesses a keener mind than that possessed by other n1en, that at one glance he can see that \vhich has escaped the attention of. the professional whose every thought is devoted to the study of these same problems. You are badly handicapped, for you can devote only a sLnall portion of your tin1e, in n1ost cases it will perhaps take a nun1- ber of years to get that sarne prelin1inary training that the professional starts out with. If perchance you had a high grade chrono- tneter to repair surely you would not expect to go out in our streets and select one of the laborers there who only kno\vs of the exist- ence of such an instrutnent by nan1e, to be a suitable person to repair your instrutnent for you. If special preparation is required in a trade, how n1uch n1ore ought to be necessary in the highest of all professions, in pure science ? So we can justly put down as the first re- quiretnent of the observer, a knowledge of both his subject and kindred subjects whihc

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. No\v let us turn our attention to the accu- racy of modern ·work. One-two hundred thousandth of a grain of sodium can be de- tected by means of the spectroscope. An instrun1ent \vhich has proven itself of immense value in the last fifty years. By its aid it is possible to analyze the light of the distant star, and to assert son1e facts in regard to its constitution, although it n1ay take years for the light to travel fro·m that same body to the earth. The nearest fixed star is about four light years. Light \vill travel around the earth seven times in a second. Conceive if possible, ho\v far it \vill go in a year, and remember that this is your unit of measure- ment. This rneans that if by one stroke, in an instant, if every star could be blotted out of existence, it would be four long years be- fore the first star \Vould fade. By the displacen1ent of the Fraunhofer lines of the spectrurn, it is no\v possible to measure the rate of approach or recession of the brightest stars. Perhaps it tnay be excusable to dwell more at length on this instru 111ent. As has been said, it is no\v playing and will continue to play such an in1portant part in the advance- nlent of human knowledge. If a bean1 of I sunlight. falls on a prisn1 of glass, the light · which has passed through is separated by the difference of refraction into the \Vell known colors of the rain bow. This is called a spec- trurn. No\v if the light had first passed through a narro\V slit before falling on the prisn1, \Ve would have the essential features of the spectroscope. Across the spectrun1 \Ve will find dark lines which are called Fraun- hofer lines. These lines are found to be characteristic of certain particular substances. For instance the t\vo broad lines in the yel- 1 low indicate the presence of salt or srxiiutn, 1 and hence are termed the sodiun1lincs. Cer- ! tain other lines correspond to l1ydrogen, about one hundred of the lines of the solar spectrun1 have been identified \Vith iron. And so every kno\vn substance having its / own characteristic lines. Now one step n1ore, the light which \vould correspond to any one line has a particular \Vave length,. and it is by this :means they can be separated and identified. Have you ever no:triced how the pitch of a band of music that is coming toward you, is raised ;. and ho\v it is lo\vered wh:en the band. is going from you ? Pitch depends upon the frequency of vibration. A greater number of vibrations per second reach the ear when the band is approaching, a less nun1ber when the band is receding. Now the same principle \vill apply to light. If a star he approaching the earth a greater n un1 her of light \vaves will reach the ear~h; and the result will be that all the Fraunhofer lines will shift toward the blue. By determining the an1ount of shifting either one \vay or the other \Ve can determir1e the rate of approach or recession. A curious illustration of this la\v was dis- . .. covered a little n1ore than a year ago. '[he lines of the spectra of a couple of stars were found at times single then again double. The cause of this doubling was very evident, the stars \Vere really double although the most po\verful telescope \vas unable to sepa- rate them. At certain periods as you \vill readily see, in the.ir revolution around each other, one \vould be approaching and the other receding·. The lines due to the one \Vould shift in the one direction and those due to the other would shift in the opposite. We \vould then have the doubling of the lines. At certain other periods, they would be moving in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the earth. The result would be no shifting of the lines and they would ap- pear sing·le. The tin1e is rapidly approaching when we shall kno\v tnore of the relation of our sun to the other stars of the heavens. \Ve know now that our whole· system is drifting through space at a rate of about fifteen miles per sec- ond. \Ve kno\v that other stars have similar '\'· rnotions. Do they all belong to one tnighty

Does this not seem ahnost like reonq uering · the will of our Master and Creator, to thus fath:onl the depths of space and reveal the hidden n1ysteries beyond ? But rather it is only the natural and logkal development of the human race. A fonv:ard step in the ne\v rapid progress of evolution. Science has for its goal Truth, Truth pure and si rnple, Truth unadorned, unbedecked by superstition, pas- sion or prejudice. Surely truth ought not to offend anyone. God has endo\ved us with certain faculties of the n1ind ; \VVe \vould not be working out his purpose, if \Ve \Vere not to use our reasoning powers to the b·est of our ability. 'The scientist \vho spends n1o~lths and even years on such a problen1 as the variation of latittl'de although it is finally proven that this quantity in only about one-tenth of a second of arc, a quantity less than the error of observation in refined \vork, he neverthe- less needs no defense even if his work ac- reality there is hardly a :single line of investi- gation ·which has been carried out to its full- est extent. Of course long since all the surfa·ce discoveries were made and it is the worst ldnd of foolishness to expect to add anything more \vithout long, difficult, and patient labor. SIDNEY J. LOCHNER, A.
