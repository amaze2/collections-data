Rarely is the writer of biography called upon to sketch the life of a rnan of n1ore marked character- istics, and of 111ore nunterous acconlplishinents, than the su bjeet of our pre~ent article, Col. Chas. E. Sprague. A linguistic genius, able to comrnand · the chief languages of ancient or ntodern Europe · for philosophical or literary uses, one of the ntos-t , expert accountants in the United States, the I'e- sponsible bead of a great financial institution, v<:~t­ eran of the late war of the rebellion, and prorninent , in the social eircles of New York, Col Sprague com- ; bines the qualities of the scholar, the financier, the , patriot .and the gentleman. Col. Sprague was born in Nassau, N.Y., Octo bel· . 9th, 1842. He prepared for c,.>llege chiefly by his • own efforts and has the distinction of being the : youngest student ever admitted to Union, or pos- sibly to any prorninent college-thirteen years the · records show. He was graduated in 1860 'vith high ' honors. While in college he joined the Alpha Delta · Phi fraternity, and upon graduation was elected to the honorary society of Phi Beta Kavpa. He held tbe N ott prize scholarship, and read .an orig- · inal Greek poeru at the Couun encernent exercises · of his class. In June. 1893, Union College bestowed upon him the degree of Ph. D. He enlisted early in the war, and a.erved in the 44th N. Y. (People's Elsworth) Regt., in the fa1nous \Dan. Butterfield\ brigade. At the second day of Gettysburg, he received a wound fron1 which he has never fully recovered. He was considE'red by the surgeons too far gone for an1putation; the re- sult being the saving of the ahnost useless aru1. But he carried away from the battle a shattered shoul- der, the discontfort of which he. patiently bears- a daily tribute of suffering, so 1nodestly endured, few suspect the hero. Though only a sergeant when wounded, his bravery won hiln a brevet coin- rnission as colonel, which he received fron1. Gov. Fenton. In 1870, Col Sprague entered the Union Dhne Savings Institution of New York as the junior clerk. He becan1eSecretary in 1878, Treasurer in 1891, and President in 1892. While in college h€ acquired a knowledge of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Gennan and Spanish; the study of which, and Inany other languages, he has continued since his graduation. Tht-> Atlanti})· a, newspaper published in the Greek language, re- cently contained a gTacefulletter fron1 Dr. Sprague in that tongue. At the challenge of David Dudley ,

TO THE ALUMNI. MANAGER ALIJEN, of the base-ball tean'l, says that the prospects for a strong nine next spring are very encouraging. At the present mon1ent it looks as though all of last year's team will be back again; and in addition to this, the manager is on the track of several good players who will enter vvith '98. IN ORDER that a sn1all college be suc- cessful on athletic fields it is necessary that every n1an in college be an athlete. Even though you have never seen a foot- ball, apply to the manager for a suit, and help swell the ranks of the second eleven. We want twenty-two n1en on the campus every afternoon to line up against the ''larsity, aud give then1 good sharp prac- tice. The best players who ever kicked the pig-skin, or donned a canvas jacket have been developed in this way. ALL Freshmen who intend taking up journalisn1 as a profession, as well as all others who are interested in literary work, should carefully read the extract fro1n the laws controlling the management of THE 00NCORDIENSIS, published in another col· JFe shall continue sendin(f THE CONCOHDIEN~ Ul11ll.

And the fact that Union's faculty possesses three men who have recently produced such works with a marked degree of success, is a matter for self congratulation.
