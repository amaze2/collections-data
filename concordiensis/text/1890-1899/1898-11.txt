Si:m:ce the last issue of the Con:cordiensis the board of editors has received several complaints to the effect that there has been a lack of variety in the published accounts of the season's gam:es. :Our complaint says, '' The scores. have been to() . . a· , one-sided to make 1ntereshng rea tng. In reply we would beg leave to state a fact not generally known. This paper has b~en reporting the continued success of a t~e.atri<cal company, an all-star cast headed by Wilham J. Smith, which has been giving a continuous per- formance every Saturday afternoon since Oct. 1, with a matinee on Wednesday, Oct. I 2. Last Saturday's gatne was but a repetition of the five that have preceded it except that the wearers of the garnet had the closest kind of a. call frotn being scored against. It was an occa- sion when cool, nervy playing was the all itnportant requisite. Every man on the team realized this, and the result was that though Rutgers had the ball on our two yard line, they did not sc'ore a touchdown, and Union still holds the unprecedented season's record of I 13 points to o. The day was just the kind for a football game and when the team arrived at the Ridgefield dub house they found a large assemblage anxi- ous for the struggle to begin. Along the ropes and in the g~·andstand were many Union alumni, and also a goodly representation of the gentler sex. Another feature and one which argues well for a closer university feeling was a large crowd of students from the medical college whose, '' Rah, rah, rah ! Rah, rah, re! U . u . 1 n1on, n1on. A.. M. C !'' vied in friendly rivalry with the \ hikas\ of our own '' rooters.\ Although the scarlet was conspicuous here and there, still the garnet was much more in evidence, and, as the score shows-very properly. Rutgers was the :fi:rst on the field, but was · shortly followed by Union, and after a pre- liminary ·''warming up\ the two elevens t()ok their positions, Union kicking off. Then fol- lowed the ·most exciting five..tninutes play in the game. Conger caught the kick and was downed on the 25 yard line. McMahon was sent against the line hut tnade no· gain. Rut- gers then sprung a trick that cotnpletel~ daze.d Union for a minute o1· two. It was 1n this fashion: the centre passed the ball to the quarter back who stood in his usual position and kicked the ball toward the side lines ; McMahon, Thompson and Conger were after it in a second and the last nam·ed, catching it, and well guarded by interference made 25 yards. When the play was made again it was good tor 35 yards. Then Union was penalized for holding, and the next moment the ball was on our 2 yard line. Captain Smith's quiet word of encourage- ment could be heard and then the Rutgers' backs hurled themselves at our line. It resisted like iron-not an inch was gained. Again the same play, and, ''No gain,\ shouted the referee. The signal was once more given ,-a rush, a clash, a struggling 1nass of humanity and the ball was over the line. ·One by one the players were extricated from that pile and there at the bottom of it all was Thebo with the ball held tightly in his arms. A toucl1back counts nothing, so the score remained the same. Union lined up on her 25 yard line and kicked off, and play was once more begun in earnest. Rutgers made 10 yards on a double pass but then were forced to kick and Price got possession of the ball. By this time Captain Smith and his men were in high mettle and they at once set to work to play foot- ball. Keogh kicked 30 yards and it was Union's ball on a fumble. Carver circled the left end

At this point Eckerson succeeded Rapa1je who· sprained his ankl!e. Then the rush began anew, and after Gu~nac's 7 yard gain, and Fenton's 8, Pri~ce 'Crossed the line for a touchdown, and Keogl1 kicked the goal. No scoring was done in the rest of the half and neither team had a decided a<lvalltage. Just before the close of the half Mallery had to give up and was carried off the field. He was replaced by Dunning. In the second half Union was continuaUy the aggressor, though Rutgers had the ball part of the titn,e. On a futnble at the centre of the field Dunning picked up the ball and made 10 yards. Thebo then made in succession runs of 10 and 15 yards around the right end, and after ·good gains by Fenton, Gulnac was sent over for another touchdown. The trial for a goal failed. After the next kick-off Union did not lose the ball once, and Fenton, after a 45 yard run ' crossed the line for the third and last touch- down, from which Keogh kick:ed a goal. Score, Union, 17; Rutgers, o. Captain Smith was as usual right in the game, despite the fact that he was partly crippled. Fenton was the best ground gainer of the day, but Carver and Thebo were much in evidence in circling the ends, and the other backs in hitting the line. Finnigan put up a strong game at centre and the rest of the line was uniformly good. Captain McMahon did the best work for Rutgers, and Mann's kicking was certainly one of the features of the game. The only matter of regret in the entire game was Mallery's injury. He was examined by a physician who declared the ligaments of one hip to be badly torn, and this is of such a seri- ous character as to keep him from the football field the rest of the season.

' The Sophomore class ~at Princeton has passed resolutions abolishing hazing. The resolutions outline the privileges of the upper olasses, such as wearing the college colors, golf, duck or crash trousers, sitting in the 'varsity grand stand, snowballing, etc., and privileges which have corne down from former years and have been denied the freslunen. These resolutions are not binding upon thetn unless the faculty return all the rights and privi- leges to those members of the class who have been suspended for hazing, and close all action of such kind against any men still in college. If all the suspended and expelled me~ have not been returned to college by November r 1, these resoluti<>ns will not be valid.-Pennsylvanian. The Philon1atheans have now resumed their work for this year and at the first meeting, Oct. 27, the following officers were elected: President, Dix W. Noel; vice-president, Melvin T. Bender ; treasut·er, S. S. Reed ; secretary, Leroy Weed. On Nov. 2, the following subject was debated: Resolved, That the United States should establish a protectorate over Cuba.

~HE CONOORDIENSIS. White the 'varsity was ,covering itself with glory last Saturday at Albany, the second eleven was woTking hard but in vain to defeat a team representing the Reynolds' business school of · \) Amsterdam. ·This :eleven was made up of the best players in Am:sterdam and their average weight was from ten to tw,enty pouNds heavier than the second elev:en. Doubtless the weight and strong interference of the Amsterdan1 eleven won the game for them, as every inch of ground they ~nade was sharply contested for. The ga n1.e was caHed at 3 : 30, Amsterdam kicking off. The ball was returned a few yards and lost on downs. Assisted by .strong inter- ference Cregg was sent through the right tackle for a touchdown,. Stover missing the goal. Union then kicked off and Stover caught the ball and returned it 15 yards. A:msterdam again got the ball on downs and b:y a series of · end rushes worked the oval down to Union's 10 yard line when Selmer went throug 11. :the center for the. second touchdown. Soon after, time was called with the ball well in Union's territory. In the second half the scrub \braced up\ ' and kept their opponents fro1n augmenting their score. During this half the ball changed hands several times and when time was called neither ~ide had the advantage. The line up was as follows : UNION, 0. AMSTERDAM, 11.

Chas.13urrows, Printer, 4I4 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. Errata. There were two errors among the alumni itetns in the last number of the Concordiensis, which we wish to correct: Rev. Putnam Cady entered college with the class of '85, but did not graduate. Rev. E. T. Root was a tnetnber of · the class of '87, but left college at the end of his freshman year .-En. A FEW aluruni have accepted our invitation extended a few weeks ago, requesting contribu- tions to our alumni column. We are willing to devote a whole page to alu1nni notes if they will send us information concerning themselves or other graduates. Other coUPge papers devote a great deal of space to alumni news, ~ncl there is no reason ·why the Concordi- ensis should not do so. Any one would think from the reluctance with which information is given by the alumni, that they have forgotten that they are graduates of Union. WHAT HAS become of the college political organi- zations? It is prope1· that college students should show some interest in politics, for they must :Se- come affiliated with one party or another after graduation, and now is the time for the students to form some opinion on political issues. Why not organize a Roosevelt clu.b, and a VanWyck clu.b? Union had a strong Republican club a few years ago and it should have one now . THE CONCORDIENSIS desires to collect informa- tion concerning Union college men, graduates, non-graduates and undergraduates, who enlisted in the war with Spain. The desired information consists of : Name ; college class; name of mili- tary organization or naval vessel; date of enHst- ment therin, or assignment thereto; record tl1erein, including all promotions, casualities .or sickness, with exact dates; record of regiment or vessel during party's connection with it, including camp- ing places, campaigns, or engagements, with dates; previous military or naval experience. Any other details in connection with the service. \\Ve cannot make our request too urgent, that those who know of the service of any Union man should send to us aU the facts which they have, in as exact form as possible and at an early date. We ask for the aid of all, students, alumni, friends, and especially the help .of those who enliste~. No other attempt has yet been made to gather these records, and the Concordiensis thinks that sorne steps should be tal(en to perfect a history of the Union men, for future reference. As a matter of record, it will be very valuable, while the publica~ tion of the facts will be interesting to thousands of men 'Who have attended Union college. in : fut1 tea' con losE .she tirr wh he< rea ID2 th: ye: Uil th thl co: ha pl ga re to ac a I . 11 s . ]~ ]\ I tl 0 I t 1 r ( 1 1 j

The Collcordic11sis VoL. XXII. UNION COLLEGE, NOVEMBER 11, 1898. No. 8. UQiOQ Loses to }iamiltoQ. The first league gam'e for the representatives of :Old Union took place last Saturday.at Cl:inton and resulted in defeat for the wearers of the garnet. The result of the game was a surprise t() everyone, and Union's defeat can be ascribed t() the homely fact that H was an \ o.ff-day '' fot· the team. With a record of s1x gan1es won and none lost, Captain Smith and his n1en had Uttle fear that Hamilton would be the winner, and possibly this confidence was in part responsible for the result. At any rate, we were beaten, aud the final score was not due to any one or. two particular plays, or as they are caBed in football parlance, \:flukes.\ It must be acknowledged that Mallery was sadly tnissed back of the line, both in defensive and offensive play, and many tin1es did Union's ends miss tackles, which netted large ~ains for Hamilton. To be sure, the field was' ~in a condition altnost unfit for a· game, but then tl1is was as much of a dra whack to one eleven as to the other. All these excuses might be brought forward b ' : ut there is no need of this. Union was beaten ' :but not for a minute l1as the team lost confi- dence in itself nor have the students lost faith in the team. The season is not yet over; the pennant is not yet won ; and as far as Union is concerned she proposei to keep at it so long as there is a fighting chance. THE PLAY. Hamilton won the toss and chose the south goal. Union kicked off. The ball was blocled by Btone, on the Io-yard line, and advanced to the 2o-yard line. Mason went around Union's left end for a gain of 30 yards. Stone tnade a gain of 20 yards around the right end. Stone went around the right end again, and with crood • ·0 Interference and a cleat· field started for Union's , goal. On the Io~yard line the baU sli pp'ed from his grasp, and bounded off upon the .ground. Mason snatched it up and scored a touchdown. Cunninghatn kicked a goal. 6 Hatnilton kicked off. I<.eogh returned the ball by a punt to Hamilton's 25-ya.:rd line. The teatn lined up with the ball in Hamilton's possession. Mason was sent around left end for a run of 6o yards, and a touchdown. Cun- ningham kicked goal. Union kicked of[ Robertson caught the ball on the zo-yard line and returned it to the 35- yard line. Cunningharn gained '25 yards. A few 1nore plays followed and time was called with the ball on Union's 25-yard line. In the second half Hamilton kicked off to Union's ro-yard line. The ball was returned to the ro-yard line. Union \braced up\ and played faster. Gains through tl1e center and around the end advanced the ball to Hamilton's ro-ya.r~ line where the ball was secured by Hamtlton 911 downs. The ball went to Union on a forward pass, and Carver was pushed over for a touchdown. Keogh failed at a goal. Score: Hamilton, 12; Union, 5· Union kicked off. Stone secured the ball and advanced it to Hamilton's 25-yard line. Mason after a magnificent run brought it to Union's IO- yard line. Cunningham then went over the line for a touchdown, but tnissed the goal. Score: Hatnilton, 17; Union, 5· Hamilton kicked oft. Fenton advanced the ball to Hamilton's I 2-yard line. Hamilton secured the ball on downs. Ctinningham and Mason advanced it to the middle of the field. Union got the ball on downs. Keogh punted to Hatnilton's 15-yard line. Hatnilton lost the ball on downs, and Fenton went over the line for a touchdown. Keogh failed at goal. Time was called ~Tith the ball near the tn iddle of the field. The line up and score follow:

Last Saturday the Second Eleven was de- feated by the Johnstown Y. M. C. A. by a score of r6-o. Considering that this was the longest gatne the scrub has played this year (two 20 n1inute halves) and that the opposing teatn was made up a.lmost ~entirely of ex-college players, the tea1u is to be congratulated on keeping the score down as well as it did. The Johnstown men played together remarka- bly well. They had a large nu tnber of formation and trick players and it V\ 7 as on these that they made their pt·incipal gains. R. H. Robinson kicked off for Union. The ball was advanced to the middle of the field and three minutes later Johnstown had scored the first touchdown. King missed goal. Union kicked off and the ball swayed back and forth across the field till near the end of the half when Johnstown scored again. No goal. Score I o-o at end of first half. King kicked off for Johnstown. Eames carried the ball five yards and Union advanced twenty yards n1ore by the line- bucking of Weed and Robinson. Johnstown gained the ball on downs. Soon after a formation play around Union's left end re- sulted in a touchdown and goal by King. Score 16-o in favor of Johnstown. During the rest of the gatne our boys held their own and time was called with the ball in Johnstown's territory. The line up was as follows : J OHNSTO'\-VN, 16. SECOND ELEVEN, 0.

,. 1 The second eleven met defeat on ~eleotion ~ day at the hands of a team re.presenting the Reynold's Business college of Amsterdam. The gan1e was played on the campus and was ; the return game for the one the second eleven played at Amsterdam two weeks ago. The g;atne was won through the superior weight a·nd experience of the Amsterdatn eleven, which \\Vas made up of the best players in that city. The ganl.e was called at 3 : 30, Union kicking off. Selmser caught the ball and tnade a bril- liant run of 25 yards. By end plays the ball was rushed to the center of the field. Here Union took the ball on a fumble, but soon lost it . on downs and again received it on do,vns at their ten yard li~e, barely preventing their · opponents from scoring. Soon after, time v·vas called with the ball in the center of the field. In the second half, A1nsterdan1 kicked off and the ball was advanced 2 yards by Eames. By another series of end plays the ball was carried to Union's. ro yard line, when Cregg was sent around fhe left end for a touchdown, Spoor kicking the goal.

THE FACT that Union did not win the game with Hamilton last Saturday should not lessen our confidence in the 'varsity, whatever may have been the cause of that defeat, for a football game is as ' upcertain as an election or a horse race. That de- feat will only strengthen the team and make the men more determined to win from Colgate. At present our chances for securing the pennant are just as good as any colleg~ in the league. Ar ... L MEMBERS of the freshman class desiring positions on the Concordiensis and Parthenon boards are req nested to register their names with the editor-in-chief by December first. All fresh- men who intend to take up journalism as a pro- fession, or are in any way interested in literary work, should avail themselves of· the opportunity that is offered, and begin their work in the com- petition at once. Appointments will ~e made on the basis of work submitted for publication. 1'::EE: FIRST concert of t he Musical Association will be given at the Van Curler, December first, and i:t is the duty of every man in college to attend aad do all h.e can to secure the attendance of others. 'There are few more important influences for there- fine:rnent and culture of the .college student than that r():ffered by the musical side of college life. No other organization places tbe college in such a fa-v()rable light before a critical and refined audi- ence.. Notb.ing appeals more strongly to the parents of pr()spective students. Therefore the under- graduates should support the association and help make the season a successful one. FoR. THE benefit of those who are competing for positions on the Concordiensis and Parthenon, and tnose who have already received appointments on the staff, we will state that the fundamental reqaisite is proof of ability to work. The fact that a man. has secured a place by work in his fresh- man year, by no means insures him a position in his junior year if'he ceases to work. Furthermore if sotne student should prove his e~cellence and worthiness during his sophomore or junior year, he -w.ill be given a fair opportunity. We call ·the attention of all competitors to the rule govern- ing the college publications, that no candidate is eligible for the position of editor-in-chief, unless work is sub.mitted for both publications. ~lumf}i tlotes. :By orders issued from Washington, Major Allan H.

Harroun of New York, ;tt~easuret· of Union ooll:ege: Dear .Sir: General Joseph: Whee.Ier, United States an11y, is exceedin.gly interested in the· subject of the education of 1 Cuban young 111en, and the General fully believes that the Ameri- can colleges could airl very materially in build- ing up a good feeling between Cubans and our people by each college offering to educate two or n1ore voung rnen from Cuba, who could be J • ::found anxious to secure .~ college course in this country. Gen. Wheeler is so hnbued with the idea that our nation, as well as the Cubans, could 'Secure a great benefaction if such a course was carried out, that if you will signify your willingness to care for and give to two or tnore. young Cubans a free course in your college, Gen. Wheeler will assist in every way in his .. power in selecting proper candidates for your institution to receive on th~is basis.

The CoJlcordieJlsis VoL. XXII. UNION COLLEGE, NOVEMJ3ER 18, 18'98. No. 9. tlQiOQ, II; ~ol~ate, 0. The second game ()f the series which is to decide who will hold the football pennant during the coming year took place last Saturday and resulted in another victory for Union. Colgate has been playing a fine game this year and as Union has been son1ewhat crippled since the game with Rutgers, some apprehension was felt as to which side would gain the victory. However, the 'varsity played up to the season's high standard and at no time was there any danger of our being scored against. Perhaps the lesson of two weeks ago had something to do with the victory, but at any rate with Mallery back in his place the wearers of the garnet cer- tainly put up a very strong gatne. run around Colgate's right end for a touchdown. Keogh failed to kkk a goal. After the ball was kicked to the :middle of the field Best, who was playing his first 'varsity gatne, got it and n1ade a 70 yard run, and in the next play Carver wai · .sent over the line for a touchdown. Keogh As has happened several times this year the field was very n1uddy but even then, few fumbles were made and the tean1 played a steady game,. Our treatment by Colgate also deserves lnen- tion. It is a pleasure to refer to the gentle- , manly conduct of tll'e Colgate undergraduate body in general and the team in particular. l1 nion won the toss and chose to defend the south goal. Ctam p of Colgate kicked off to Mallery who· returned it to the center of the field by a kiek. Union foTced the ball down the field to Colgate's IO yard line and then lost it on downs. By a number of pretty runs Colgate carried the ball as far as Union's 20 yard line and then lost it on downs. Union was quickly taking the ball down towards their opponents' goal when time wa& called with the ball near the middle of the field. In the second half Keogh kicked off. and Col- gate worked the ball back as far as the 45 yard line before losing it on downs. Union again punted and after a six yard gain by Colgate the ball . was returned to Union for offside play. Carver was then given the ball and mad~ a long kicked the goal. During the rest of the half neither side scored and when time was caHed the ball was at the n1iddle of the £eld in Union's possession. The line up was as follows: UNION, 11. COLGATE, 0.

The University ofPennsylvania is erecting a large Vivarium to facilitate and stimulate Zoological work; t11e desire being to introduce the study of living creatures in schools and colleges, instead of dead ones, as is the custotn now. This Vivarium is the first of its kind in this country and so far as known no university in the world is provided with such a building. The \live\ house, as it is called, will be so arranged as to enable bugs, beetles, marine anitnals, small vertebrae, etc., to be kept alive, and their daily habits investigated, a departure .. which should be of much assistance to student,• in experimental and research work.

. I . I I . ' ', l I . I i 6 THE OONCORDIENSIS. The football season of '98 can1e to a grand ·triumphant dose on Thursday afternoon when Union adn1inistered defeat to Hobart. The victory was just the kind with which to finish up the work of tb.e year, and it marks the end of the most suc~essfui football season that Old Union has ever :enjoyed. All honor to Captain Smith, and the men who with 11in l1ave worked so indefatigably for the glory of our Alma Mater. It is only fitting that the men on the team after their labors should he able to boast of success on the gridiron, the equal of which U n_ion has never before had. 711!e season of '98 will go down in the history of football at Union as one never to be forgotten. Thursday's g~rne was a league game and this makes the -victory doubly important, for the standing of the teams is now as follows: Hamilton ................................. . Union ................................... . c·oigate I • I •• 1 .. t. •t e 1 • t 1 • t • I • I • I • • I • I I • I I Hobart .. I· ••••• , • • • • • ·I ~· • I •••••••••• I ••• Won. 2 2 1 0 Lost. 0 1 1 3 Colgate and Hamilton played a tie game the early part of the season and this is to be played off at Utica on Thanksgiving Day. Upon the outcome of this game depends the championship of the New ~ork State Intercollegiate Athletic Union. It will be seen that in case Hamilton wins on Thanlisgiving Day then the pennant will go to the pigskin kickers from Clinton. But should Colgate win, then Hamilton, Union and Colgate vvili be tied for first place. The weatl1er on Thursday was· anything but pleasant, but despite this, Schenectadians turned out in goodly numbers to witness the season's last contest. Sh.ot·tly before three o'clock the teams trotted cut on the field; Union first, followed by 1-l()bart. It was a few minutes past the appointed l1our when the referee's \Vhistle sounded ancl the gatne began . Union had the south goal and Hobart the kickoff. CarveT caught Folger's long punt and was downed on_ the 20 yard line. On the third down Hobart got tl1e ball on a poor pass to Keogh, but shortly lost it on downs. Then followed an e~xchange of punts .and the ball was Union's again. The Hobart line was attacked and the plays netted large gains. Schmitter, · who had previously taken Fenton's place,. was then sent around the right end for 35 yards and Carver then crossed the Hne for a touchdown. No goal. After the kickoff Union made several gains but the ball went to Hobart for offside play. The latter then began to pliay with a will and Union seetned unable to check their advances. After gains by Lockwood,. Wilcox and Folge·r, the latter went over the line, and the goal was kicked. Time was then ca.lled for the first half. Score : Hobart, 6 ; Union, 5. Not the least daunted by the fact that Hobart was in the lead, the \rooters\ continued to make thetnselves heard till play was again resumed. Union kicked to Hobart's 20 yard line and soon had the baH on downs. Carver and Schtnitter made good gains and Thebo went over the line for anotl1er touchdown. No goal. For the next ten minutes o(play Hobart put up a stubborn resistance, but they weakened at the rushes of Gulnac, Mallery, Schmitte1· and Keogh, and Carver went over the line. Again Keogh failed at goal. The next and last touchdown was made in less than five minutes. Union did not lose the ball once and after gains by Schmitter of 10, 5, 5 and 35 yards, and short gains by Carver and Mallery, the latter crossed the line and Keogh kicked a pretty goal. Score: Union, 21 ; Hobart, 6. The line up was as follows : UNION. HOBART. The bo ............... left end ..............

THH1 CONCORDIENSIS. 7 l Q:tereo llEl~iate. Brown is to have a new athletic field and cinder track. Secretary of State John Hay gradua.ted from B . . . , 8 town 111 5 .. There are 40,625 univet·sity students in the United States. The receipts of the Princeton basebaH asso- ciation last year w~ere $ri,481.45· Over six million dollarR have beert spent on the new site of Columbia university. The Carlisle Indians netted $zo,<>oo as a result of their football season of 1897. Andover has raised all but $I2,0(;)0 of the $5o,ooo needed for the new g)7mnasi:um. An exchange estimates that the a-verage cost of fitting out a player on a big 'vat·sity eleven is about $40. Exeter raised $r 200 this fall for tb.e support of the football tean1.. The nun1ber of men in school is 246. U. of P. has recently received p1;operties to the value of $4oo,ooo by the will of the late Col~ J. M. Bennett. 1. The report of the tt·easurer of the Princeton Athletic association shows a net profit of $2,648 for the past year. The flag presented by theY ale undergraduates to the cruiser ''Yale\ has been returaed to New Haven and will be preserved as a trophy. . Darhnouth proposes to charge every student in the tr~asurer's hill a fix:ed yearly a~mount for athletics. The ~mount suggested is ten dollars. The University of Chicago con.:ferred the degree of LL.D. on President McKi:nley, while he was attending the Jubilee celebration in that city. The Hon. George M. Bowers ()f the Fish Comtnission has presented to Cornen university a large collection of 1i 4 esh and salt water fish, consisting of almost five thousand li-ving speci- mens. A committee has been appointed to prepare plans for the celebration of the two· hundredth anniversary of the granting of the charter to Yale college. The celebration will tak~ place . tn 1901. Columbia university has a new gytnnasium and swimming pooi which is claimed to ·be the largest owned by any educational institution in the world. The running track is made for ten laps to the tnile. The library fund of Wesleyan university has been increased by $3o,ooo, .a bequest of the late Rev. Dr. Albert Sanford Hunt, of New York. Dr. Hunt also bequeathed his private library of several thousand volumes. By a recent regulation passed by the faculty of Amherst colle.ge, no student, who has n1ore. than one deficiency, or whose work in the current tenn is so unsatisfactory as to call for special action on the part of the iaculty, shall take part in any public game or entertainment given by any club, association or team of students. A new n1ethod of electing tnembers to the Phi Beta Kappa society has been inaugurated at Amherst. The choosing .of a certain per- centage of a class has been abolished and a rank standard substituted, 88 and 85 per cent. respectively for the first and second drawi_ngs. The faculty is no longer to elect tnembers, but will recommend students for tnembership for the final election of the active chapter. Cornell is to have a medical college in New York city which will cost $6oo,o\oo. This addition to the university is made possible. through the generosity of Col. Oliver Hazard Payne of Cleveland, Ohio. The donor has also created an endowment of over $4oo,ooo, so that the entire gift represents about $1 ,soo,ooo. The college will occupy a plot 200 by IOO feet at First avenue and 27th street, and will have five fl.oot·s.

SoMETIME ago a committee was appointed at a c<>llege meeting to petition the proper authorities, ()n behalf of the student body, for the re-instate- ment of the \copper.'' As far as can be learned little has been done in this direction, and a college policeman is necessary in order to keep undesir- able people off the college grounds. There are tnany reasons why a :POliceman should be main- tained, none of which need be mentioned here, and tbe students hope that some action will be taken to re-instate the former official. UNION has been asked to participate in .a dual athletic meet with Williams next May, and the matter is now under c<>nsideration. The two col- leges have not met on the track for some years, and this invitation for a renewal of athletic relations o-ught to be accepted, oecause of the many advant- ages that accrue from the association of colleg~s with each other. Such relations put new spirit into athletics and awaken competition. Let the invitation be accepted by all means, and there will soon be a restoration of that old time enthusiasm·. THE CONCORDIENSIS again makes an urgent request for alumni notes. The difficNlties attend- ing the collection of items about the older alumni must be apparent to all.

- THE OONOORDIENSIS. 9' 8~GOI]d EI~\1'9Q, 5 ; 'fi, ft.·~., 5· An interesting game of football was played on the college campus last Saturday afternoon between Union's sec0nd tealn and the eleven representing the National Afhletic ~club of Sche- nectady. The Nationals are ,composed of town men and include Chas. Messm,er and R. H. Cooper, who played for Union last year. The two elevens were very ,evenly :matched and the result of the ga1ne was a tie, each tearn. ~coring a touchdown and each in tu:t·n. failing to kick a goal. The Nationals made flJOst of tbek gains around the ends, while the scrub excelled in line bucking and tearn work. The best work for the Nationals was done \by Bagnall, whiJe A·. Robinson, Weed, Tuggey a.nd R. Robinson put up the strongest game for ,the second eleven. The scrub defended the south goaJ and had the kick-ofr. The ball changed hands frequently and was punted freely. Glert made a skillful run around right end and Bagnall was rushed over for a touchdown. No ·.goal. In the second half the scn:1b was strengthened by the addition of French and R. Robinson. The scrub kicked off to Cooper, \:Vho advanced the ball ·several yards. Messn1er and Bagnall rnade large gains for the Nationals. Ag:lin the ball changed hands several tin.'les. The Nationals punted and A. H. Robins() til caught the pig skin and made a pretty run around right end for a touchdown. The ball was. kicked out and caught. Yawger tried for a goal but Bagnall ran out rapidly fron1 between the goal posts and cleverly blocked the progress of the ball. The line up follows : NATIONALS, 5. 'S11COND ELEVEN, 5.
