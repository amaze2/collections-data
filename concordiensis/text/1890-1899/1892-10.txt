The place \vas secured for him by Dr. Wells, who takes -a great pleasure in rewarding his faithful and success- ful pupils in this way, regarding it as a corn- plitncnt to Union and his departn1ent here. · Mr. l .. ec Felthousen, '86, has also tnade the tnodern langnages a specialty, and after ex- tensive travel and study in Eui·ope, has been successfully engaged in teaching them in this country for several years. He has also been recently pron1oted to a professorship in the famous Milton Academy at Chester, Pa., through his o\vn faithful \vork, and good words fron1 his alma mater.

I enclose a skeleton biography of General JVlichie, taken fron1 Cullun1's Register, which, according to its cust01ns., cuts off all senti1~1 en t and eulogy, and gives the clear, brief record of service, action and work. One would hardly read bcb\·cen the lines as I do fron1 long personal knowledge and acquaintance with General Michie, his strong force of character, his great energy, pov'f'erful mind and his sterling and adn1irable character. It is a personal honor to 1ne to clahn hhn as a friend. He is one of the first and high- est of the trained scholars and instructors in the land. He loves his aln1a n1atcr of vYhich he may be justly proud, as the first and best institution of its kind on the globe, as well as proud of being dean of its facul- ty. When he ci1terecl the acadcn1ic board years ago, it ·was with a fixed and RctHecl purpose to ·which he has steadfastly adhered and by '~'hich he now stands so high among the educated men of the \vorld. General Michie has been in 111ost hearty and earn- est sympathy \vith the course of lectures which he opens, from its first conception. He has been n1y adviser and friend, and I o-we n1uch to him. He suggested that the honor of opening the course be conferred upon s01ne of his distinguished and per- haps more widely known, in the poliHcal world, com- peres. I dissented at once considering hi1n entitled to the post of honor, and did not consent to let his unfeigned n1odesty take him fron1 that position. He understands and appreciates fully the under- lying purposes of the course, for special good to educated 1nen and students. * -x- I desire that the students may thoroughly a1)preciate how strong and able a n1an is to address thcn1 and receive hin1 with Old Union's usual cordial \\velconlC for a gallant sol- dier, a pure scholar anc1 true gentleman.

Y. .Gc1ltlc11LC1l : I have just glanced over the September is- sue of THE CONCORDIENSIS and wish to ex- press n1y sincere appreciation of the very de- cided improverncnt in the paper. It is the best number by far that has con1c to n1e for several years, and it is so especially because of the local and personal nc\vs. It \vas full of inforn1ation which a graduate likes to get. We like to kno\v, for instance, \vhcre the fac- ulty spend their vacation-everything that concerns the president, faculty and students of the college. We do not care especially for long discussions or extended accounts of a thlctic contests, ·while we always like to kno\v the result of such contests; but \Vhat \Ve care about especially is the inforn1ation g-iven about the college itself. Excuse n1e for \vri ting in this \Vay, but I feel that you deserve a word of encourag·c- n1ent. 'fhe paper is the representative ofthe college, and should be the best that you can tnakc it. I enclose n1y check for $2.00 in pay- tnent for my year's subscription. Respectfully yours, i\. v. v. H.AVl\IOND. N E\VS con1cs that Colgate has withdrawn frotn the foot-ball league. The object of the \vithdre:nval, the Colgate tncn say, is that a university tean1 xnay be put in the field and thus have a heavier ·eleven and secure g:uncs outs,idc this state. ~vianager Lines will pro- bably endeavor to secure a date for aU nion- Co1gate gc:une, notwithstanding the with- drawal of the lattct fron1 the league.

NE\V YORK, Oct. 8-Union College is the only educational institution in the country which will be represented in the great naval parade of Tuesday next by its distinctive vessel. Cotnrnodore John I-I. Starin, one of th~ trustees of the college, has placed the Laura M. Starin at the disposal of the New York alumni association, and the proffer has been accepted.

It was not until Saturday morning, Oct. 8, that the students avvoke to the fact that the generosity of one of the trustees of the col- lege, John H.

For once they appreciated living in a college to-vvn. To be a U11ion tnan was a great privilege then as n1any N e\v Yorkers found, when they tried to pay their fare for a trip on the boat. No one but loyal Union men were ''passed\ and there were plenty tirne nc).n~' realized \vhat a great nun1ber of the boys had arrived in New York, but they . kept coming in little bands, ten or a dozen at a tin1e, until they took cotnpl.ete possession of the upper deck of the ''Laura M. Starin.\ 1 As might be expected, they were not a very I q uict crowd either, and the college yell was I n1ingled \vith delicate inquiries as to the diffi- culty with every \veil known personage \vho can1e on board, and in every case N e\V York was assured there was no difficulty with thetn of then1. The ''Laura M.\ was beautifully decorated vvith flags and garnet buntin£. She was so I thorot1ghly labeled that no one could fail to tell where she can1e fron1 and who was aboard. Even if their eyes failed then1, if they had any excuse for cars they could be fully in- forrned that she was a Union College boat at all. Not only students but the Union alumni and their friends, wives and daughters flocked to the hospitable decks of Comn1odore Starin's steamboat. There are over five hundred 1 \ Union alumni in Nevv York and Brooklyn, I and it seemed to the two CoNCORDIENSIS \ n1en that they were all con1ing. 1'he ladies \ forn1cd no sn1all part of the con1pany and here the good taste of all Union men was n1anifestcd, for a prettier collection of the gentle sex than those \vearing the garnet, could not be furnished by any college or university in this or any other state. and had Union College students son1ewhere around her. A goodly .supply of horns had been purchased and these together \vith one hundred pair of lun2\S succeeded in rivalinF ~J ~~ the whistling of the tugs in th~ harbor. Pron1ptly at the appointed time the boat cast off and started dovvn East river. Every- body was happy except a little band of I students, who, coming on a late train, arrived at the pier just a fe\V minutes too late. The firevvorks do not need to be described as the daily papers devoted n1uch space to then1 and, indeed, description is useless if not in1- possible. Suffice it to say that after a very pleasant hour's entertainrnent the \L M. Starin\ returned to her pier, landed her passengers, and the students separated to find their hotels or, \vhat was more probable, to see New York. It \vas, ho\vever, a con1paratively quiet time going down East river and in the harbor, for everybody was busy taking in the sights. The few \vho kne\v '''bat they were talking about had all they could do to correct those who didn't. One Freshn1an, nevertheless, edified his con1radcs by pointing out the '' Pe\v-til-lizer\ building. When the great naval parade \vas on€c fairly started, the fun began. As we sailed up North river the piers and every point of vantage \verc black \vith hu.tnanity. Every fe\V n1inutes a· crowd would be discovered \vho had never heard of Union College and the speed \vith \vhich they were enlightened was amazing. There is a wild \Vestern yell well known to college boys coxnmencing \Waxy-co-wax-co-wax which adn1its of being played on horns with a beautiful ef{~ct. It \vas a very refreshing change from continual yeliing and it was generously ap~ plauded by every excursion boat which approached near enough to appreciate its beauty.
