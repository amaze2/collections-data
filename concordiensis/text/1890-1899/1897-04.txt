The men boarded the Troy boat on Tuesday, March 30. Arriving in New York City, hotel accomoda- tions were found at the Ashland Hotel, 4th avenue and 24th street. On March 31, Union crossed bats with New York University at Uni- versity Heights; on Thursday, April 1, the team played Fordham at Fordam; Friday, April 2, Manhattan College on the Manhattan College grounds; Saturday, April 3, Princeton at Princeton. . and l st base ; Thatcher, left field, pitch and 2nd base ; S. H. French, 2nd base ; Purchase, short stop; Davis, 3rd base; Smith, center field; Edwards, right field ; Wiley, 1st base, and Delehanty, Medical, catch. . C. Stewart's right hand was severely injured ' in the N. Y. U. game. Hegeman was sent for .• from Newark, N. J. and caught in the Ford .. ham game. Delehanty arrived Friday morning and caught in the games with Manhattan and These games constitute the first experience of our men as an organized team. They were ab- solutely lacking in good team work, the essen- · tial feature of every successful baseball nine, and quickly lost confidence in their own indi- vidual ability. The certain re1ult was a series of severe defeats, which it is hoped will impress upon every Union man the necessity of most thorough outdoor practice and regular team work in the future. Manager Williams expects to secure a professional coach at once to take the place of Coach :White, who has resigned. To Manager Williams' credit; the team re- · turned from its New York trip financially ahead. The team arrived in Schenectady on Monday and immediately entered into training. '!'here is at least some promise of more life in the games to follow. The standard of the team work in the future remains with the tnen in col- lege. A large representation of college n1en should therefor engage actively in the afternoon practice of the team and should also lend en- couragement to its success ? If such a con- dition of affairs becomes manifest, the results of the New York games will become history, never to be repeated. The players and their positions on Union's team were as follows : C~ Stewart, catch ; · Princeton. The first game on the campus will be played · with the Empire Athletic club of Schenectady, on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. A game will follow on Saturday, April 17, with St. John's Military Acade·my. Tt)e tnusieal flssoeiatioq. The Glee, Banjo and Mandolin Clubs, assisted by Cook, 1900, impersonator and reader, have given seven successful concerts during the past winter and have distinctly shown that they could do credit to Union College by taking a trip somewhat more extended than has het·etofore been undertaken. Such a tour has been arranged by the management to take place the week immediately following Easter. Tuesday evening, April 20, the clubs will appear in Cohoes; Wednesday evening at Hudson, Thurs- day at Saugerties ; Friday at Newburgh and the final concert of the trip will be held Satur- day evening in Mendelssohn Hall, New York · City, under the auspices of the New York Alumni Association. Will any student who wishes to register for a position with the Albany Teachers' Agency, please confer with the business manager of THE CoNcoRDIENSIS ?

The managing editor of both publications shall in the fature be selected from a list of as- sociate editors, which sball qualify for position on both paperi. The following board of editors has been chosen to serve during the year 1898 : At a recent meeting of the officers .of the editorial staff of THE CoNCORDIENSIS, several slight changes were made in the constitution governing the management of the college publi- cations. Managing editor of CoRDIENSIS and PART HE- . NON-Perley Poore Sheehan. Owing to the creation of THE PARTHENON as a literary monthly, and to the establishment of the weekly CoNCORDIENSIS, it was deemed advisable to create in connection with THE PARTHENON, another editorship of the same · rank as that of the pt·esent 1 iterary editor of THE Co~coRDIENsrs. It was thought that the identity of the two publications could better be preserved by main- · taining the present condition of affairs as re- gards the editor-in-chief. Thus there will be .· but one chief editor for both publications. The successful business management of the two papers demands that they should be con- ducted together, thus no change has been made • . in the business management. In formal lan- guage., the changes made are as follows : The present .editor-in-chief of THE CoNCORDIENSIS shall i1;1 the future· be known as the managing editor of the Union College student publica- tions. The present literary editor of THE CoN- CORDIENSIS shall in the future be known as the news editor of THE CoNCORDIENSIS. A literary editor for THE PARTHENON shall be chosen each year frotn the Junior class, to serve in such c~pacity during his Senior year. The selection of S!-JCh literary editor shall, after 1898, be chosen according to the rules governing the choice of the present literary editor of THE CoNcORDIENSIS. The salary of the literary editor of THE PARTHENON shall be the same as that of the news editor of THE CoNCORDIENSIS. Thus a competition is now opened for the literary -editorship of THE PARTHENON for the year 1 8g8, and also for the three associate editors which shall be selected from the· Sopho-. more class and from which, in 1898, shall be News editor of CoNCORDIENSis-Carl Ham- mer.

Black, '6o, died March 25, at Augusta, Me., at the age of 58 years. He entered Colby University, and afterward came to Union where he graduated in I 86o. He studied law in Schenectady but afterward re- nloved to Augusta where he became a lawyer of prominenc,e. For the last three years he has been a United States Pension Agent. Rev. Dr. Henry Tullidge, '3o, died at his home in Philade~phia, Pa., March 18, at the age of 85 years. He was born in Portsmouth, England, in 18rz, but a number of years later his parents emigrated to America and settled in Albany, N.Y. He graduated at Union in 1830 and entered the ministry. His first charge was at Galena, Ill., but most of his ministerial labors were confined to Pennsylvania. He leaves a wife and three children, one of whom is Rev. E. K. Tullidge, Rector of St. Paul'il Church, Philadelphia. Prof. Ashmore's revised edition of ''Terence A del poe \ is being used this term by the Sophomores.

' THE CONCORDIENSIS. 5 Eli Perkins, an alutnnus of Union, will lecture in the chapel, Monday evening, April rg, for the benefit of the new athletic field. Mr. Perkins who is now in Chicago was approached by a representative of the Chicago Inter~ Ocean who reported the following characteristic inter- . VlCW. \ Certainly you may come in and interview me,,' he answered, rousing himself from his abstraction. \I was just thinking what old Clinius, the father of Alcibiades, asked Aes- chines. \ 'What good does education do?' Clinius asked. \ 'Well, an educated tnan can always asso- ciate with himself.' \ Mr. Perkins had evidently been associating with himself. \'What good will it do to give Alcibiades an education?' asked Clinius again. \'When he goes to the theatre you can tell him from the benches,' answered Aeschines. \ 'What will you charge to educate him?' \ 'Sixty dracluna.' \ 'That's too tnuch. vVith 6o drachma 1 can buy a slave.' \ 'Well, you'd better go buy one-then you'll have a pair,' retorted Aeschines. \nut Clinius didn't hire him, and Alcibiades went into athletics instead. Well, in a couple of vears Alcibiades can1e to old Aeschines and ... said : 'I can kick higher than any boy in Athens.' \ 'So can a jackass/ Aeschines answered. '' 'And I can switn farther than' any boy in Athens.' \ 'So can a bulifrog .'' \'But I am handson1e-look at n1e! I'm an athlete.' \ 'So is a bronze statue, but it has no heart or brains,' old Aeschines said. ''Those old fellows used to have a good deal of fun,\ continued Mr. Perkins, nursing his knee. \A while after Alcibiades was making a speech--he was an orator, like Bryan, all wind, you know-~nd oid Diogenes came along and stood behind Alcibiades and held a big dried fish over Alcibiades' head and waved it back and forth, back and forth. The people all begun to laugh, and then Diogenes said : '' 'Behold how even an old dried fish is more interesting than Alcibiades.' \Imagine continued Mr. Perkins, chuck- ling, \son1ebody waving a big dried codfish over Bryan's head.\ flmusemel)tS at tl}e VaQ ~urler.

BURROW~, PRINTER AND BINDER, SCHENECTADY, N, Y. A FEW days ago a number of students and alumni were discussing the result of the recent trip of the base ball team. In the course of the discussion an alumnus asked, or rather exclaimed: When will the men on the hill learn to profit by experience ! The above exclamation contains in an extremely terse form, a citation of the cause of more than half of the trouble a,nd ill feeling which has bee.n developed in connection with our athletics during the past few years. It certainly does appear as though we never would learn from experience the ;folly of trying to compete in athletics with insti- -;tutions that have four or five times as many /Students from which to select their athletic ma- ·.terial. Certainly no one would say that we were. \in any way warranted in sending a team to Ptince- ton to compete with their players when our own team had not been in the field more than th.ree or four times in preparation for that game. Had such a game been scheduled a.t a later date in the season, there might have been some chanee of the team acquitting themselves with ,credit. It is to be hoped tbat i:he loot ball management will profit by the experience of past years, and that the games schedul~d for next fall will be in accord with our ~bility. Disastrous defeat never reflects credit upon the defeated team. A FEW defeats, however, should not discourage the tea1n; neither should it paralyze college spirit. Conscientious t1·aining and the determination to gain victories where there is a fighting chance, will do much to retri·eve the fQrtun.es of the base- ball team. Manager Williams announcement tl1~t the· ex- penses of the trip wer~ ~es$ tlu~n the reQeipts is certainly gratifying. There is .every reason tC> count on a fair degree of suceess for the remainder of the season. ANOTHER column contains th.e announcement of the nam.es of the .successfuL contestants for position on the editorial .staff of THE Co NCORDI- ENSIS and PARTHENON. We wish to call partieular attention to the fact that there has been created a l:iterary editorship of THE PARTHENON and that the office will have the same financial consideration attached to it as there is to the news editoJ.~ship of THE CoNCORDI- ENSIS; namely $50.00. Conrpetition for such office is open to the \\\>hole college. The literary editor for next year will be chosen fro1n the Junior class on the basis of work subm,itted. No person will be selected for this office \vho does not sub- mit material of such merit as would warrant pub- lication, and in quantity equal to at least one full page for each succeeding issue of the magazi~e. In case no one should qualify, the office will be filled by appointment made by the officers of the present board. On the basis of material sub- mitted, three members -will be selected from the Sophomore class to be known as associate editors from which, in their Junior year, one will be selected to serve as literary editor in his Senior year. THE undergraduate body will shortly have an opportunity to show their appreciation of the efforts that are being made by a few of the alumni to establish and properly equip an enclosed ath- letie field. Mr. Melvin ]). Landon (Eli Perkins) has volunteered to deliver a leetu.re in the chapel on April 19. The proeeeds of tbe lecture will go to the Athletic Field fund. The students can show a just appreciation of Mr. Landon's offer only by attending the lecture in a body. There can be no excuse except sickness, whieh would justify any- one connected with tbe college from attending this lecture.

\ THE CON·C·ORDIEN.SIS. 7 UFJi.oQ (1epresel}t·ed at tl]e Se;t}ool- master's DiQQer. The annual dinner of the Hudson River Schoolm·ast~rs' Club was held at the Kenmore, at .Albany, April 2, 1897. President A. V. V. Raymond and Professor Ashmore were present . from Union. President Raymond delivered the principal address of the evening. H.e first made refer- · ence to the rapid growth of interest in education in the last twenty-five years for which student life was in part t•esponsible by its enthusiastic demonstrations, which attracted wide spread attenti'on, but the more important cause was the growing recognition of the. need of accurate scholarship. Every advance in civilization creates a demand for higher intelligence. President Raymond then referred to the tendency toward specialization. So far as this leads to greater efficiency it is to be commended, but so · far as it depreciates the importance and value of the development of the subtle and more spiritual faculties, it fails to realize the true end of educa- tion. The speaker then traced the influence of the studv of mathematics and languages, showing how~ these opened the n1ind to the great world of truth. He then called attention to the most important factor in educational work-the per- sonal influence of the teacher. In closing, he touched on the superior value of culture studies, as these may be differentiated from the techni- cal and professional studies. Prof. Hale spent the vacation. at New York. Mr. Harwood Dudley, ~75, was in town Mon- day, April 5· Dr. Reeves was in Balthnore during a portion of the vacation. ·Hewitt, '97, preached at the Reformed Church in Scotia, April 4· Noel, '99, spent his vacation with friends at Canastota, N.

On the finish. Wright and Price led and were closely followed by Huntley and Strong. The ground is still very muddy as was shown by the appearance ()f their suits when they returned. The quartette of the Union College Glee Club, comprising Green, Hintnan, MacMahon and Eames with Cook, 1900, reader, gave a concert during vacation at the Albany Business College. They have b~en .getting up a great deal. of new material and thetr concert was a success 1n every way.

-------ADV.ERTISEMENTS.-· --- 9 In .a recent number of Harper's ·Weekly, Casper Whitn~y argues that cross~country run- ning .should he one of the chief features in college athletics.. He regrets that this spott has not . created more interest in America and that .there are so few good ~ross-country runners here compared with England. How,ever, he says, this year will undoubtedly see an awakening of interest in this sport, which will be felt all over the country. Athletic clubs and colleges are beginning to n1ake it an event in their meets. To be stlre this branch of running does not offer that chance for display that the others can, but it is truly indicative of the merit or demerit of the competitor and is one of the most delight- ful of exercises. A renewed interest is being manifested here as well as elsewhere.

The classes ~re developing separate teams and much spirit is being aroused. 'The object of this extra amount of practice is the cross-country race will take place about May 1. It will be an inter-class race in which each class may enter ten men. The course will be in length as near as possible to fiv.e miles. At various points there will be men: stationed to mark the route to be f<>llowed. As there will be forty men in the race the first man in will receive forty points, the next thirty- nine, etc., so that each competitor can make at least one point. The reason for having it so early is to allow the members of the track team time to do a certain amount of track work for the spring meets.

The Concordiensis VoL. :XX. UNION COLLEGE, APRIL 17, 1897. No. 26. Dr. ~aymoQ·d's CQ~apei SennoQ. Dr. Raymond used as his subject Sunday afternoon, \The Will,\ the reference being found in J o l1n 5, 40. H·e said, }{nowledge opens the way but does not save, for the will is the citadel upon which all our actions wait and there is no possible action without it. We may have the ability and knowledge but we cannot obey until we will. Each one as a free moral agent has a moral responsibility and the choice is always individual. Free agency is a gift of God which differs in extent with different individuals. Where is the great difference ? Inheritance is a potent factor but not so highly important as the use or disuse of will power. This is one of the most im- portant departments of education. Necessity and poverty have a strong influence in teaching men to will and choose, while others who are better educated but have less will power will fall beside them. So·metimes children exhibit strong wills and we :seek to break them. It is a fatal mistake for thet·e is no virtue in compulsory action. In the same way higher education is a training in power of volition. In college work the faculty are our teachers but we are the choosers. If we ' are not, it is because we have spoiled our will- power earlier in life. Our wills are controlled by desit·e, and desire acts through the mind while the mind is actuated by longing. Hence the first prospect of virtue is virtuous thoughts.. Decision clears the mind as the wind clears away a fog. A decisive will exercises the mind in the right direction and is a preventative of insanity, while irresolution acts in exactly the opposite direction. profes$·Or pross~r'g Geoloqieal Exljlbit At the fottrth annual reception and exhibit of recent progress in science, held in the American . Museum of Natural History, of New York on April 5th and 6th, Professor Prosser exhibited a portion of his collection of rocks and fossils · collected\9y him while in Kansas and Nebraska. His exhibit appears in the catalogue as fol- • lows: 4· PERMIAN AND CARBONIFERous RocKs AND FossiLS FROM KANSAS AND NEBRASKA. Exhibited by Prof. Charles S. Prosser, Union College, Schenectady, N. Y. a. A set of the Permian rocks of l{ansas accotnpanied by some of their characteristic fossils. The Upper Coal Measures and fossiliferous Permian formations of Kansas, which have recently been named and described by Prof. Prosser, consist of the following formations arranged in ascending order : W abaunsee, Cottonwood, Neosho, Chase and Marion. b. Carboniferous Rocks and Fossils of Nebraska. A partial representation of the Car- boniferous rocks and fossils of southeastern Nebraska. The rocks of southeastern Nebraska have been referred to both the Carboniferous and Permian systems; but in a recent paper Prof. Prosser correlates them with the W abaunsee and Cottonwood formations of the Kansas Upper Coal Measures. See Yourn. Geol., V, Jan.- Feb. No., p. I, and Feb.-Mar. No., p. r48. c. Fossils from various New York formations. See especially Hatnilton flagstone with wortn- tracks from Otsego county, and fish scales and bones from the base of Chemung group of Otsego county. A competitive examination for house surgeon was held at the Ellis Hospital, Tuesday evening. Dr. Latcher, of Saratoga, a graduate of the Albany Medical College, '97, was the success- ful competitor and will fill the position during the coming year.

The convention was of the college Y. M. C. A. presidents of · New York and New England, with the addition of University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers and Princeton, and was the best ever held by the association, fifty-five colleges being represented. Similar organizations have been started in the universities of England, Germany, Norway and Sweden, India, China, Japan, Australia and South Africa, and reports showed that these were in fully as prosperous condition as the great movetnent here in the United States. Rev. J. V. V. Wemple, '92, was in the city . several days last week.

THE OONCORDIEN.SIS. On April 7th, the Cornell Dally Sun was changetl f1·om .a four page to a six page paper. _ An agreement for two years has been tnade · between ,Cornell and Lafayette in base ~ball and foot hall. The Yale-Princeton and Harvard--Pennsyl- vania foot ball games are both scheduled for the · same day next fall. By a recent decision of the Supretne Court, the p1~operty of Brown University has been exempted _ft·om taxation. Those members of the Senior class at Brown University whose class standing has been sufficiently high wiU be exempt from final ex- aminations. The authorities of Brown University have de- cided that the students must either give up the use oftobacco or leave college. The faculty of Bost<>n University has passed a like rule. The Pennsylvania state legislature has been asked to approp1·iate $I ,ooo,ooo to enable the University of Pennsylvania to improve its several departments of study. The United States is not the only place where football wars occur. There is a lively discus- sion going on between the International Rugby Board and Wales, and it is all about that satne old question, ''What is an amateur, what is a profes~ional?\ Tlie annual eight-oared race between the crews of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge was rowed Saturday over the Thames championship course of 4 1-4 n1il~$ frotn Putney to Mortlake, ancl won by Oxford.

Har- vard will have a second 'Varsity this year with a schedule almost as long as that of the first team. The Columbia College Law School, in order to elituinate the large class of half-educated : special ~tudents, now requires that special students must possess the same qualifications for admission as candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws. President Stryker, of Hamilton College an- nounces that a friend of the institution has donated $z5,ooo to be devoted to the erection of a hall of languages, for which plans are now being prepared. Fifty thousand dollars was recently given to Han1ilton to found a profes- sorship in history, and the latest phase of the Fayerweather will case is favorable to Hamil- ton's securing the $14o,ooo bequeathed it by the will.

IT IS the duty of every student in college to purchase a ticket to the Eli Perkins lecture which is to be delivered in the chapel next Monday even- ing. Mr. Landon kindly volunteered to deliver this lecture fo1· the purpose of helping along the athletic-field project. Every student should show h1s appreciation of the efforts that are being made in this direction by contributing the price of at least one ticket. The lecture will be interesting and no one should miss hearing it. EVERY student in college knows that the base ball team needs encouragement, yet there are but few who show anything like a proper enthusiasm. The game Wednesday afternoon indicates the potential ability of the men who are working for the interest of tbe college team. ..A large number of enthusiastic .:'rooters\ would enliven the after- noon practice and would also tend to induoe -others to try to make the team. There is only one way for the students to get a base ball team and that is to n1ake it themselves. If we produce a team which pla.ys creditably and wins games, it reflects honor ~I!Hl the student body as a whole.; if their playing is~ rned ioc:re the shame lies not with them but with t11e student body who failed to encourage the e:fforts <>f the faithful. WE l;J>NDERSTAND that there is some misunder- standing· ainong the students 1·eg.arding the com- petition for positions on the C()Uege publications. We therefore reiterate in part what was stated in the last issue of THE CONCORDI.ENSIS regarding this competition. The students who have entered the competition for the position of managing editor must qualify by submitting matter for both :publications. This applies to Sophomores and Freshmen already ap_ pointed. All students who desire to ,q_ u.alify for the posi · tion of riierary editor of TILE PARTHENON to be held during their Senior year-1nu.st qualify by sub- mitting matter for publication. in that magazine. This is open to all the students except Seniors· Matter intended for publicati@n in the April PAR- THENON must be submittedim.lll.ediately. ON WEDNESD.A. Y the library was re-opened and the new rules and regulations which have been adopted by the library com·mi-tt.ee were put in active operation. An extended account of the new systein .appears in another colurnn of this issue. We consider the plan of operation a good one and are confident that it will pro-ve .an efficent remedy for the abuses which have existed in the past. The managing force of the library has been aug- mented so that there will be no difficulty or delay in procuring books for refel'ence or for general reading~ THE 00NCORDIENSIS wisnes to impress upon the minds of all students the fact that the new regulations have been adopted so as to enable them to more fully enjoy the advantages which a well equiped and well administered library affords . .And furthermore these cha:P·ges have been made with scarcely any interruption in the regular library privileges at a time when abuses existed which -would have warranted th.e college authori- tiesin closing the doors to the st11dents until other more e:fficient rules could ha-ve been instituted. The .successful operation of the new systein depends not alone upon the librarian and his assistants. Eve1·y student has b.is part to perform and upon his honesty and care depend in a large part the success of the new r·egnlations.

,8o.-Mr. Robert Carter Alexander, editor, and Mr. R. E. A. Dorr, publisher, have become proprieto1·s of .the New York Mall and Ex- press, wlJ.ich they have already made one of the ablest aad most influential of the great news- papers. of the land. It is an exponent of the best Republicanism; board minded, patriotic, charitable, clean, fearless. Its,editorial page is conducted with an ability thrat i~s scarcely sur- passed by the great Dana himself. Mr. Alex- ander is a man of individuality. He was grad- uated from Union College in the class of '8o and is only about 38 years of age. He has reached his present position by no freal( of fortune, but by force of ability and industry. A trained and experienced lawyer, he has been connected with 1nany important enterprises outside of journal- ism. He was the chief promoter and organizer of the Adirondack League Club, (with its I ro,- ooo acres of forest preserve) of which he is now the president. His versatility, culture and scholarship are equalled only by his tireless energy. In1bued with unyielding Scotch honesty, he is a foe to political trickery and sen- sationaljournalisn1, and will tnake his paper re- flect his own integrity and l1igh character.

'85.-Representative Foote, of New York, has had the reputation among many of his admirers of being the handsomest man in the House·, but there is another representative from Tennessee, Mr. J. Wesley Gaines, who aspires to pluck the laurels from the New Yorker's brow. Mr. Ga.ines is one of the new members. His ambition to displace Mr. Foote was illus- tt·ated the other day when he entered a well- known gallery on the avenue,. where photo- graphs of members of both houses are kept, and asked t<> see Mr. Foote's picture. It was shown him, and Mr. Gaines looked at the likeness for a long time, taking it to a mirror and carefully arranging his h.air so that it would 'T look .more like the picture. This neces&itated the parting of his locks in the middle, as Mr. Foote does, instead of on the left :side, and re- quired some time. After the task was com- pleted, Mr. Gaines purchased one of the photos, and passed out, saying : '' Folks say I look like· him.\-From the :JVashlngton Post. £ocal aQd persoQa.l.

Mr. Landon comn1enced by drawing ·. ended. the dividing and defining line between wit and humor with perfect exactness. Humor is truth while wit is defonned truth, falsehood or hyper- bole. We do not laugh at regularities or any- thing exact ; we laugh at deformities or those things which differ from the ordinary. The humorist is able to produce laughter by rr shnply relating so.tne common incident of every · ' day life just as it happened, and then closing . , with a slight exaggeration. Sarcasm is used to magnify a fault. It calls attention to that fault and is ~he great weapon of the newspapers. Ridicule, another forn1 of humor, is used princi- ... pally to condetnn truth and is often and success• fully practiced in law courts, where it overcomes pathos .. Eve.ry argutnent was plainly illustrated by numerous comic stories and anecdotes. Mr. Landon has several times traveled around. the world and has lectured in many countries. He once spoke before a crowded house in St. James Hall, London. He has so many phases of humor that he is appreciated by every nation no n1atter how stern.

'.fhe concert was held in the National Bank building and was well attended, all the numbers being enthusiastically received. The clubs were up to their usual high standard, notwithstanding the fact that two ·of the leaders were absent .. In place of MacMahon, Greene, '99, acted as director of the glee club; and Baker,' 98, took the place of O'Neill as director of the mandolin club. After the concert, the clubs were entertained by the ladies of the city at the Reformed Church. Great credit is due Hubbard, 1900, whose eflorts were untiring to make the concert a suc- cess. The comtnencement exercises of the class of '97 of the Albany Medical College were held last Tuesday night, in Odd Fellows Hall,. at 8 P. M. The address was delivered by Rt. Rey-. W. C. Doane, D.

4: THE CONOORDIENSIS. The college Y. M. :C. A., which was organ- . ized here in '94, ha& now developed into orie of · the most important factors of the coUege. The n1embership has increased to ']o men. htieet- • ings are held every Tuesday evening at 7 o'clock . in their rooms, in the middle section of south . college, under the leadership of one of its active : me~mbers, and Sunday afternoons in the chapel ' the fellows are given a short talk by Dr. Ray- : mond, or a minister from the city. · The different classes have engaged in Bible study, meeting once a week. For next year's work many new plans have been adopted. President Hoxie who was pres- ent at the Convention of Y. M. C. A. P,resi- dents at Boston, last week, has brought hack a detailed report of how Y. M. C. A. work is conducted in the various colleges of the east and of New York state. In presenting his re- port T.uesday evening, he gave interesting sta- tistics ·of how Y. M. C. A. work was develop- ing all over the globe. \ Twenty years ago there were less than 30 ·Christian ot·ganizations · of students in the colleges of the United States while now the thirty has incre~ sed to 550 and the membership is now 33 ,ooo. Five thousand men have been influenced to becon1e tninisters of the gospel, and more than Io,ooo students are connected with Bible study study classes.\ The committee for getting out the hand book has been appointed, and these will be sent to the students who intend to enter Union this fall. In addition to this the preparatory schools will be visited by delegates representing Y. M. C. A.. work. This branch of college life needit the co-oper- ation of every student. The twenty-fourth annual meeting of the Alumni association of the Albany Medical College was held Tuesday night. The address of welcome was delivered by Prof. James P. Boyd, M. D. Reports were made by the historiansoftheclassesof'47, '57, '67, '77and '87. The musical association made a successful beginning to their series ofconcerts, in Hudson on Wednesday evening. A large and very select audience greeted the clubs, an<l' under the inspiration of such lovers of 111usic., the fellows did their best. Although Mr. McMahon vvas absent,, under Mr. Greene's leadership the glee club sang exceptionally well. All w-ere tnuch pleased with the mandolin and guitar clubs, but the most takirtg part of the J?rogramm·e were :the negro melodies hy the quartette. Mr. ~Cook always attracts, and Wednesday evening was no exception. But few receptions have been given to the clubs which have passed off more pleasantly than the one tendered by the young ladies of . }Judson, and all present expressed their appre- ciation for the efforts of Mr. Clowe, the n1anager of th.e association last year, and the ladies. After some ridiculous experiences on ferry b,oat and stage, Saugerties was reached early on the afternoon of-Thursday. Rivalry ran high when the ferry la.nded. Two rival stage drivers were at ha11d to carry us to the hotel, and amid the pushing and haul- ing, a reasonable price was determined upon and a great triumph scored for competition. Saugerties also appreciated the W()rth of the association and the concert was entirely suc- cessful. The wl1ole association greatly appreciate the efforts of Mr. Clowe in arranging the Hudson concert, and also express their gratitude to Mr. Moulton for his management of the Saugerties concert.

OHA8, BURROWs, PRINTER AND BINDER, SCHENECTADY, H. Y. Now that a good sound nucleus for an athletic field fund has been established through the gener- ous action of Eli Perkins, it is to be hoped that interest will not flag until the project is com- pleted. WHILE the questions of reform are being agi- tated, why not begin on N ott Men1orial Hall? Those wooden window-patches would be only half-bad, were they painted some sober, incon- spicuous shade. IF' the students who can write passable English would take as much interest in THE PARTHENON as they do du~dng the present contest for literary editorship, it 'vould be a great blessing all around. We regret to say that we as yet have been unable to evolve any permanent scheme of inspiration. THE degree of college spirit that led to such an enthusiastic display at the station last Thursday morning should not be lessened by any amount of , defeat. Such spirit should not be a fluctuating quantity to be a.:ft'ected by every wave of fortune or misfortune any rnore than Fhould a man's patriotisin. The team did its best, and eYen the Inost pessirnistie will grant that that best is rapidly growing better. THOSE undergraduates wl1o are now seeking earnestly to insti.tute reforms in the student body are not con:fi.netl to any one class, nor should any one class undertake a n:1.onopoly of such reforn1s. But the fact tha.t the Senior class had taken the initiative and proceeded with no selfish interest to the development of a plan for a permanent honor syste1u, should have met with the. hearty accord of everyone. · But if the other classes take such an interest in the plan, as to wish. to n1ake it a college affair~ so much the better. This will, no doubt, give the Seniors the very opportunity they desire, by which they 1nay prove that re- forn1, not vainglory, is what they are seeking. l..IQiOQ Coses to )'iamiltoQ. Union was defeated by Hamilton ·in baseball last Thursday afternoon on the campus of the latter college by a score of 16 to 12. Union seemed to have had the game won on several . occasions, ,but a final relapse on . her part, re- sulted in the above score. Sweet for Union pitched a good gatne, but his support was very weak. The majority of errors fell to the lot of the infield. The day would have ·been perfect for the gatne, but for a high wind that made accurate throwing impossible. 1'he line up was as follows : UNION. French, 3b. Srnith, c. f. Thacher, 1. f. Delehanty, c. Parsons, 2b. Purchase, s. s. Hegetnan, r. f. Edwards, rb. Sweet, p. HAMILTON. Baker, zb. Robinson, s. s. Lee, p. Rose, 3h. Rogers, c. Millhatn, 1. f. Holbrook, c. f. Chrestendon, I b. Heyl, r. f. The Fresh111an base ball team has received challenges fi~om several of the preparatory schools, including U. C. I., Albany High School and others. / )

) THE CONC'ORDIENSIS. The University of Wisconsin has a ,Varsity . ~ . .. Girls Bicycling Club. Cornell has challenged the Universitr of Wis- consin to a boat race. It has been estitnated that the contetnplated American University at Washington will need $ro,ooo,ooo to erect the buildings. The University of California is so over- crowded that to accomodate the nurnbers two tents have been erected on the campus. Ernest J. Corrin, '98, Williams' most promis- ing candidate for pitcher and one of the brightest men in his class, died at \Villiamstown last week. E. R. Sweetland, Cornc;!ll, who played for two years at right tackle on the 'Varsity foot . ball team is now a candidate for the 'Varsity crew at Cornell. The Princeton faculty has ref used to allow the proposed wrestling match betvvee,n Yale and Princeton. The contest had been entirely arranged for and the date set. President McKinley has nominated Jatnes B. Angell, the president of Michigan University, to be ·envoy extraordinary and 1ninister plenipoten· tiary of the United States to Turkey. Harvard has, a new Professor in Psychology, Professor Munsterberg, who is perhaps the leading experimental psychologist of Germany. He was professor at Cambridge University for three years, returning then to Freiberg, where he has devoted himself to the writing on ethics. Haverford College has recently come into possession of an estate aggregating $9oo,ooo, through the death of the widow of Jacob P. Jones, of Philadelphia. This amount, added to the present endown1ent of $4oo,ooo, places Hav- erfotd in the front rank in the matter of re- sources. Yale and Harvard have appointed a com- mittee. to supervise all athletic differences that may arise between captains and managers in the future. Walter Camp is Yale's representative and Ex-Capt. James J. Storrow, of the crew, Harvard's. In case they disagree, a third mem- ber will be appointed . HONORED BY CAMBRIDGE AND OXFORD. The intrepid Arctic explorer Dr. Nan sen was recently given the honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Cambridge University. Two days later Oxford gave him the honor.ary degree of Doctor of Civil Law. LANGUA:GES MORE POPULAR THAN SCIENCE. It appears from the report for I 896 of the New ): ..... ork Exan1ination Department . of the University of the State of New York, on about 4oo,ooo papers submitted by academic students, that the increase in the subjects taken is greater in languages than in science. Not only do Eng- lish and modern languages show an increase, but also Greek and Latin, whereas six of the eleven branches of science show a decrease. A POSSIBLE SYRACUSE CREW. It is said that there is a strong sentin1ent grow- ing at Syracuse University in favor of having a crew next year. The situation of the uni- versity, not far from Onondaga Lake, makes the idea a feasible one, providing enough funds can be raised for the support of such an under- taking. If Syracuse makes a good showing this year on the diatnond and on the track it is thought that enough money will be subscribed to tnake a Syracuse crew a possibility. The Supre1ne Court of Massachusetts has gJven a decision inimical to the interests of Williarns College, in the case of the assessors against the college, thus reversing the decision of the Supreme Court. The suit was brought to test the legality of the collection of taxes on property belonging to the college, consisting of three professors' houses and the athletic field. The case, with the decision, is an important one as it may establish a precedent which will be followed by other courts in similar cases. Yale is now defendant in a case very similar. The decision seen1s to threaten the immunity from taxes of donnitories and recitation halls.

The great object, among various minor ones, is to gather large co11ections of fossil specimens of the Myocene period, and also to fill in the Virginia gap of the Eocene collection of the university, which collection, by the way, is one of the best in the country.
