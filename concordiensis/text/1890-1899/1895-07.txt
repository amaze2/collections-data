Th!~ celebration of Union''s :Centennial was opened on Friday everting at the First Preshyterian ·Church by the pri.ze debate between the Adelphic and Phiio- mathian LiteTary Societies. 'The prize, whick is a new. one, was given by Mr. Georg~ F. Allison, '84, and Hon. Walla<3e T. F~-oie,. '85, and consists of $100, $50 to go to the society, as a whole, that presents the strongest argun1€nt ; and $50 to th~ :debater that makes tbe best in<li- viduaJL speech, regardless of his society relation. The question was, \Resolved That Ooin''S Financial School anta:g:onizes tbe · true interests of A1nerica.\ The Ade[- phic~ had the affirmative, and the Phil()- mathians the negative. Rockwell H. Potter-, '95, was the first speaker for the Ade[p:hjcs, and he analyzed the book's line ()t thought, and sho,ved that the country· is in a prosperous condition undeT the present system of mon()- meta1ism. Fo1· the Philomathians ~'heodore F. Bayles '95 was the first speaker and ' ' . ' he claimed that silver cannot be hoarded as g()ilid., and should therefore be used as a standar-d. Ormon West, '9.5, Adelphi~, claiined that the fTee coinage of sil Yer means that the United Btates must pay $1 foT .50 cents, and thus the destruction of our national credit. Orlando B. Persh- ing, ':9'7, Phi1om:athian, came next, and · he sallid that the question was no-t one of fancy,. but of political econo!n;Ly, since it invo]ves the national credit. z_ L. Myers, '9,6, Adelphic, said that Coin was trying to deeei ve the people by false .argun1ent, and that he was .misleading. James M. Oass, '95, Phifomathian, did u.toBt of hi1s talking on the effect that the fr·ee coinage of silver would have on the d.e;htor class. This closed the first section, .and in. the second section the order was tb:e reverse, and arguments about the saa1e. Prof. Truax, after they had finislted, intro- duced the Oorrnnittee of awa~·ds, which was composed of Mr. A. P. Strong, Mr. J. ,V_ Kirkland ·and JVIr. T. J. Johnston, vybo awarded the society prize to the Adelphic, and the personal pri.z~ to R. H. PotteT, '95. !T. F. Bayles and Z. L. Myers: also rec~ived honorable mention. SATURDAY. t>t)e ~lass Day Exerei:~€'€5. On Saturday afternoon, in the First Presbyterian Church, occurred the Class Day Exercises of '95. The exetlcises were ope11ed by the president's address by George Linius Streeter, of Johnstown, who thanked the citizens of Sehen~ctady for their kindness and·hospital~-ty. James A. Collins, of Arnste:rdam, the class orator, was then introdticed, who spoke a fe-vv· well chosen remarlts on what characteristics are necessary foT success. The elass poem was then read by Henry Ravenel Dwight, of Charleston, S. 0., which referred touchingly to U nion''s

The general subject was discontent, and tbat the prospeTity of the ''Wealth,\ and the special subject, chosen country is thereby injured. The last by the committee, composed of Prof. J. speaker, L.

I I I l ' ,I I i ·I I i • 51:1~ Ba\calaureate SermoQ. The Rt. Rev. William Croswell Doane, Bishop of Albany, preached the BaJcca- . laureate sern1on Sunday evening at, the First P~esbyterian Church. His text. was 2 Timothy, 2:20~21. He said that these words appeal to strength, the glo~y of young 1nen, and urges him to keep him- self fro In being entangled with the allifairs of the world, from being satisfied with the near horizon of earthly things, :and gives two tests by which all cha~act€:r is shown, the outwwed and in ward. The three great. principles brough~ out by this text are the infinite wisd~mof the Maker, the responsibility of life with rrefeT- ence to the liver, and the use each peT.son can be in the world. The value of this training time is to find out the materia 1s of which one is made, and the place be is to fill in the world. Life lies open before us, and hencef(])Tth there is no such thing as liberty, for all the activities of life aTe so interwoven that no life ean be alone. One's occupa- tion in life is God's calling, and one will have ·to serve according to his material. The speaker then outlined very clearly the business and political corruption of to-day, and said that the only cure for these ills is a conscious and responsibjlity . of that service. ' The learning of the lesson of lif€ is merely learning the lesson of whaJ is one's fitness, and this is a long and ·deep proble1n. And here the discrirnina.tion ends for there is no difference between ' gold and wood, between silver and eaJYth, because for every faithful servant wh()se work is well done there is the joy of the reward of his Master. He said that he·hoped our motto, ''Don- cordia,\ might be e~tended and perpetu- ated in all things and closed by saying : ''God g-uide and guard you, m,y young friends, and make you vessels unto honor. God bless ' Old Union. ' \ :MONDAY., Monday was devoted wholly to the educational conferences, the morning and afternoon sessions being held in the chapel and the~ evening at the First Presbyterian Church. At the Inorning exercises '' The School\ was discussed, Melv.il De\vey, Secretary of the State Board of Regents, presiding. Prof. W. H. Maxwell, Super- .intendent of Schools, Brooklyn, N. Y., was, the first speaker, and he outlined the different school systems of. the world, saying that the United States syste1n is the control of schools by the Sate, in con- sequence of which there is a great variety of methods. He then treated the subject of the school curriculum, and told of the n1any kinds of schools now in use. In conclusion he said that the l110vement to surpass all others is the study of the human child. Mr. 0. F. P. Bancroft, Principal of Phillips' Acade1ny, Exeter, Mass., said that the n1otion for the establishment of a new school system was three fold- huinanitarian, Christian and the supply of the State officers who should. be com- petent. The typical acaderny, he said, was not for the rich, nor is it a benevolent institution. ''The College\ was discussed at the afternoon session, President Scott, of Rutgers, presiding.
