The first league gam·e of the season was '\' played Saturday, April 29 on the catnpus, . and Colgate was the victitn. They were nine good looking men who carne to Schenectady fron1 the little village qJ Hamilton and they · didn't look like victin1s either. It was not • until the second half of the eighth inning that they bore any resen1hlance to victims, but after that time sorrow and disappoint- . ment reigned supreme on the Colgate coun- tenances. They were good ball players, how- ever, and perfect gentletnen. \iVith the exception of that notable eighth inning the story of the game can be told in a few words. In Colgate's half of the second, two hits, a base on balls,- two stolen bases, one passed ball and several misconceptions on the part of the Union infield as to where to throw the ball, yielded three runs to the enen1y. In Union's half of the third Renwick was hit by the pitcher. He started to steal second and the Colgate catcher tried to stop hin1 but he rnisj udged the height of the second baseman and the ball went, sailing ·down in centre field, kicking the clover if

THE CONCORDTENSIS. I I G:ive the base ball manager an early and favorable hearing when he requests your subscription. Who said that third tern1 senior \vas a \snap?\ He never had an exarnination in Professor Hoffman's department. A large number of the students are receiv- ing printed extracts from the la\VS of Union College concerning chapel abs~nces. The vocabulary of the l{ochester base ball n1anager is son1ething wonderful according to the reports brought back by tlie nine. \' Son1e sttJdents have not enough loyalty to their college to attend the ball games on the campus. Such men are unworthy of Union College. Williams won of Darttnouth by the san1e number of runs that she won of Union. We vvould like to ti·y conchlsions with Dartmouth ourselves. It is generally believed that the condition of Rochester's grounds \vas not their only reason for not playing. They-thought they could not play ball. A little n1ore ·attention to the schedule of class base ball games is desirable. T'he official dates are announced in our calendar and every effort should be made to play the ga.mes. 1 A telephone for the use of the students 1 should be placed in one of the college build- ings. The office or the library \vould answer and it would be a very highly appreciated · in1provement. The students genet~ally admit that THE CONCORDTENSIS is a pretty good paper; but when it con1es to paying up their subscrip- l tions, they thi~k that makes no difference. It don't-to them. The executive committee of the tennis association should arrange fot the spring tournan1ent ·without delay. The third court could be put in condition with advantage to the tnetnbers of the association. It is very gratifying to notice how well the good people of Schenectady avail themselves of the privilege of attending Dr. 1 Wells' cur- rent history lectures. These talks are always interesting as \Vell as instructive. 'The vvorld moves. If you don't believe it · just read the extracts from the rules and regulations of Union College of a half-century ago, published in this number. The last two games on the campus have taught the base ball men never to give up a game until the last man is out. Both the Colgate and the College of the City of New . York games were won in the eighth inning. The very best exchange we receive is the Un£vers£ty Courz'er, of Pennsylvania. It is the most wide-awake, bright and enterprising college periodical we have seen. One more nLunber of THE CoNCORD lEN SIS to which freshn1en con1petitors may contri- bute will be issued. The five successful can- didates will be announced June 1. The editors of the Ha1nilton L£terar;' Mont!zly and the Syracuse Unz'vt::rsi~y Ne1-os are quarreling over the awarding of the athletic pennant last year. Neither Hamilton nor Syracuse need worry about first place this year. Union had five tnen entered in the roth battalion gatnes at Albany last month and four of then1 won a prize. Williams had

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ------------------------ fifteen entered and not one secured a place. We are going to n1ake it interesting for those Massachusetts people when \Ve go to Albany Mav 20 . ... As we go to press it is reported that Wil- liams '\:vill refuse to go on \vith the arrange- ment for the n1eet \Vith Union at Albany. The Williams men claim that the Ridgefield club will not n1ake satisfactory arrangements as to finances and that they can not afford to depend upon their share of the gate receipts to defray expenses. The real reason of the reluctance of Willian1s is probably the terror inspired by the share Union took in the Tenth Battalion meet at Albany, April 29. E. M. Z. Hawkes, '87, writes the base ball manager as follows: ''I have been watching the base ba.ll prospects in T'HE CONCORDIEN- SIS with much interest and have been lead to think that Union \vill make a good showing this year. Of one thing there seems to be no doubt, every effort is being made at the col- · lege to bring success. vVe younger alutnni who met vvith only athletic failure \Vhile at college may feel skeptical about the success of the nine, but we are certainly compelled to respect and admire the push and <;ourage that is displayed. If success does not con1e it will not be for want of work by rnanager and men. I arn very glad for the opportunity to aid financially. Don't feel any diffidence about asking subscriptions. Every alumnus ought· to consider it a pleasure to contribute and, if he does not, should be n1ade a ware that it is his _duty.\ ATHLETICS AT ALBANY. At the Tenth Battalion games in Albany, Saturday evening, April 29, Union rnen won as follows: 50 yard dash, I.J, C. Baker, '95, first in 5 ~ sec.; hitch and kick, Z. L. Myers, '96, first at 9 ft. 2 in.; standing high jump, L. C. Baker, '95, first at 4 ft. IO in.; one-mile walk, G. E. Pollock, '95, second.

14 THE CONCORDIE .. NSlS. '45. Robert H. McClellan, of Troy, die.d at his home in that city April 21. Mr. McClellan was born in N aE:sau, Rensselaer county, December 28, 1826. He was a son of Dr. Samuel McClellan and a grandson o£ Captain Hugh McClellan, who \Vas in the Massachusetts service in the Revolution, having charge of a company of minutemen. R. H. McClellan was prepared for col- lege in the Nassau academy. He graduated froni Union in 1845. and received a Phi Beta Kappa key. Union also conferred upon hhn the honorary degree of A.M. After his college course Mr. McClellan pursued the study of medicine in his father's office, but soon abandoned it for the law, which he studied at the office of his brother-in-law, Ron. Anson Bingham of Nassau, w.ho was district attorney. Mr. McClellan was adtnitted to the bar in October, 1848. In the following January he went west and became one of the pioneers of California. There he took part in the election of delegates to the constitutional convention and the adoption of the constitution. Mr. McClellan also fought earnestly against the exten~ipn of slavery to California. ··· :·- Returning to Nassau in rSso, he resumed his law practice in his preceptor's office. Mr. McClellan was married October 12,1852, at West Stockbridge, Mass., tJ Jeannette E. Tobey, daughter of Abraham Tobey. In the spring of 1854 he was elected supervisor for Nassau, and he was re-elected in the following spring. In the fall of 1855 Mr. McClellan was elected surro- gate of Rensselaer county, discharging the duties of the office in a manner which was entirely acceptable. He removed to Troy in 1856. At the close of his term in r86o Mr. McClellan reco1nmenced his law practice, which he continued to the time of his last illness. For the last six years his son, Samuel P. McClellan, had been associateg in business with ex\\ Surrogate McClellan. Among Mr. McClellan's more important' works is '' McClellan's Executor's Guide,\ intended for lay- men. The book has gone through three editions. Another notable work is \ McClellan's Surrogate's Court Practice,\ a. treqtise on the duties of executors, administrators and guardians, Three editions of this book have also been published. Mr. McClellan's grandfather, Captain Hugh Mc- Clellan, was in active service at the battle of Bemis Heights. His company was under Gates a short time before the capture of Burgoyne. Captain McClellan was afterward promoted to the office of colonel, which he held at the time of Shay's rebellion.

Mr. IvicClellan gaveattention to the general prac- tice of law, although most of his work was confined to litigation in the surrogate's court. In many cases of importance he took part with distinction. Punctu- ality and :fidelity were strong characteristics of Mr. McClellan, while his effective manner ip_ presenting a · cause, together with courage, honesty and self.·- reliance,. made his services valuable. He never gave : up systematic study. In 1877 Jvir. McClellan was elected a trustee of Union, and in later year~ he pursued with pleasure the classical ·studies which were a part of his work in school days. Mr. Mc- Clellan was genial and sympathetic, an_d in private and public llfe always enjoyed the confidence and respect of the community. Mr. McClellan was a prominent member of the Second Street Ptesbyterian church of Troy, and while in health was a constant attendant at the ser- vices. As a member of the Rensselaer county bar he was honored and esteemed by all his fellow- lawyers., and his death will be a severe loss. His large frame was matched by his.J'talwart and rugged honesty, and his heart was full of genial kindness. The deceased is survived by a widow and a son, Samuel P. McClellan. '62. Rev. Henry L. Teller will be installed Tuesday evening, May r6! in the pastorate of the First Pres_ byterian church of Ballston Spa. The installation sermon ,vill be preached by Rev. William Durant. Rev.

THE CoNCORDIENSIS. VoL. XVI. UNION COLLEGE, MAY 24t 1893. No. 16. A REMI:NISCEN:CE. \ · But while we ripped about and tore [With apologies to Prof. Hoffman and the Other Five.] j' Who said that third term senior was a 'snap?'

Upon my n1ail before me laid, Before n1y daily grind conu11ences, I n1ake a quick, det'ennined raid And find my last CONCORDIENSIS. The dear old n1agazine brings back Some days that 1vere,. with strong suggestion~ And read but half, it n1akes me laugh At one sharp, half-indignant question. Not I, dear editor, not I ; And pray you heed n1y protestations, For in the senior days gone by I .. also had examinations. And one, lik~ ills \vhich 'round us lurk, And, th~ugh we've\ had 'etn,\ keep us fearing, Sotne way or other failed to \York And came back for a second hearing. Before we knew what lav in store ., For six of us poor luckless sinners, We thought.our college fight \Vas o'er And -vve, forsooth, had con1e out winners. We thought the lightning never struck [ T\vice in one place; so with elation We -filled us up with joy and-truck And had a high old celebration. But \vhen we six found out in fact _ I-Iow Huffy'd made us €ach a victim, Each n1an with courage and with tact (\Vithin his mind) Just promptly licked · hin1. We used the English language rough, And vainly sought to· beg or horrovv' Son1e Swear words that were long et~ough To half express our rage and sorrow. To n1ake disgrace seen1 son1ewhat lesser; .i\nd while we delicately swore About the merciless professor; And when we n1elted into tears And then got mad again and stuffy ; With face unmoved and deafened ears Serene and cool and caln1 was Huffy. He gravely diagnosed our case And said his first dose didn't cure us; That we were \veak in that one place He took great pains to reassure us. l-Ie said but one thing could be done And that thing \Vas again to fill us ; And this should be a larger one Quite strong enough to cnre or pill us. No ultimaturn offered he. Between us and our graduation Naught under heavens could we sec But thi's one last exatnination. We took the bitter dose again, And though 't\,vas longer, harder, stricter, vVe can1e out vindicated MEN- Each victim changed into a victor. I say in view of this n1ishap {And do not hesitate a minute) That third tenn senior is no \snap\ With our Professor Hofftnan in it. The catalogue I think is right, And who will give it sorne attention Will find it clearly out of sight But third term \snaps\ it doesn't mention. So -vve say hail, Professor, hai1, Keep up the standard of the college, Still stick your students when they fail To grind the proper grist of kno\vledge. The practice has already shown The looked for, well deserved fruition, \No senior snaps\ henceforth be known In Union College as tradition. F. S. RANDALL, '86.

The weather was. all that could be asked. The games were advertised to begin at 2:30 o'clock .in the afternoon but the Williams n1en did not reach Schenectady until 2:12 P. M. and it \vas after three o'clock before the first event was called. The little n1otor cars, of the Schenectady street railway were responsi- ble for.part of the delay. They had a way of running off the track and of getting too full which certainly suggested that they were cele- brating Union's victory in advance. It \vas a good natured crowd, however, and after the games had been started the splendid rnanage- n1ent of the con1n1ittee effectually barred all con1plaints. \VILLIAl\IS TAKES THE LEAD. Things went the WillianJs \vay at first. Patterson, of vVilliams, beat Baker in the I 00 yard dash and Allen 7 of Willian1s, came in third. Baker did not get a good start. First and second in the half tnile run were taken by ing this event. Williams only managed to get a third in the bicycle race, although the race for second place between Campbell of Union and Pinkerton of Williams \Vas very close. Mulligan and Nutting were tied in the running high jump and the Union man and the Willian1s 111an each . took four points. Myers kept third for Union and then the score stood 48 to 33 in favor of Union. \VILLI AlVIS IMPROVING. The 440 yard dash helped Willian1s' score to the extent of nine points for not a Union man took a place. The throwing the ham-- nler \vas delayed by breaking handles and was not decided untii after the last event, the 220 yard dash. It was known, n~verthe­ less, before the .supply of handles was exhausted that Union would have at least six; points with a chance of eight. In the 220 yard hurdles Willian1s won first and second and Holleran of Union took third. The next four events were quick- ly decided. Union won everything in the

This }\las especially n1arked at the Willian1s meet. President Wright has presided over the last college meeting held under the leadership of the class of '9:-1·'- The burden of the tnanage- nlent of the student o1·ganizations novv falls on '94. l\1ay they prove equ~al to the task ! • 1\'he Casey School of Applied Sciences, at Cleveland, vvill becon1e a Union institution shortly. Professor Cady Staley, forn1erly Dean of Union's faculty, Professor Chas. W. Vanderveer, our ex-gytnnast and in next Septetnber Professor A. S. vVright are Union's representatives. Make your plans now to remain for com- mencement. The nun1ber of students, espec- ially underclassmen, \vho stay during conl- tnencement week has been discreditably small of late years. The Union enthusiasn1 which pervades the atmosphere on that occasion will be a benefit to any student. Then, you ex- pect to graduate yourself, son1e time, and you . wan·t to know ho\v. Union \vishes to meet vVilliarns on the athletic field again next year and desires only the friendliest relations to exist between the two colleges. The great joy shown by the Schenectady students over their vi.ctory was a con1pliment to the worthiness of their op- ponents. Union congratulates Williams on be gentletnen and athletes, to tneet whom is a pleasure for any college. A cerfain undergraduate recently remarked to the editor-in-chief that THE C.ONCORDIEN- SIS was \getting dry.\ vVe agree ·with hitn and assure hin1 that the only reason for the aforesaid \dryness\ is the sn1all number of ·students who have paid their subscriptions.

After this lucid explanation we hope that the above tnentioned undergraduate \Vill deetn it his duty to reimburse the coffers of THE CONCORDIENSIS to the extent of two dollars and to persuade others to do likewise. We understand that there \vas son1e dissat- isfaction an1ong the sophornores as to the account given by THE CONCORDIENSIS of the mid-winter meet. No such rumor reached our ears until very lately and now \Ve can not understand the grounds of complaint. Every word \Ve said about the mid-\vinter tneet we stand by no\v. This paper is not a class organ and because the sophomores win the athletic banner \Ve do not propose to purchase a cut of a rooster to adorn our editorial col- umns with as a .third-class country weekly after a political victory. The sophotnores vvon the n1id-winter at:d spring tneets fairly and that much has been distinctly stated. If tb~?rc is anything n1ore to be said \Ve would like to kno\v its nature.

12 '!liE CONC0RDiENS1S. BAS'E BALL FUNDS. The n1anagement have been extremely un- fortunate of late in choosing dates for games. Rain has interfered 'With most of the scheduled gatnes, and as a financial experiment the base ball season has been a failure. Money has been lost on every game played this year. Each trip has cost more than it produced. The need of money is, therefore, apparent and if we are to win the pennant that need n1ust be supplied. The students have responded very generously as a \Vhole, the freshtnan class . being proportionately lower than the other classes. 1'he subscriptions to date are as fol- lo\vs : Pr~viously acknowledged ........... $4 I 4 oo THE CONCORDIENSIS-Associate ed- . 1 tors . . . . . . . . . .

A New York daily paper, taking up the idea con- veyed in Flammarion's exciting novel,' ''Omega : The Last Days of the World,\ has interviewed a number of the leading men in all professions as to what they would do if science were to predict to-mor- row that the end of the world wou]d arrive \vi thin the next thirty days. The answers are various and curious, and heighten the interest l'thich is felt in the second part of Flamn1arion's great novel, which appears in the May CosJJzopolz'ta1z. It is a question which everyone will find interesting to ask of him- self: What would you do if within six w.eeks the end of the world were certain? Probably no novel which has ever appeared in an A1nerican magazine has been more elaborately illustrated by more distinguished artists. Laurens, Saunier, Vogel, Meanlle, Roche- grosse, Geradin and Chovin all contribute to the · explanation of the text. A clever story of another kind is that of the new English novelist, Gilbert Parker, in the same num- ber. \American Society in Paris\ is an article of another kind, 'but one which will interest all who have had occasion to make even ashort residence in the French capital. The Cos7nojolz'taJt scores a suc- cess in producing in its May number, aln1ost simul- taneously with the daily papers, an elaborate descrip- tion of Prof~ssor Gray's 1narvel1o11s ·invention, the Telautograph, which produc.es the handwriting, or the work of the artist, sin1ultaneously, thousands of miles distant from the place where the writer or artist is· sitting. Mr. Howells' purpose. in \The Traveller from Altruria\ is, month by 1nonth, becom_ ing more evident, and is now receiving -wide atten- tion at the hands of the critics all over the world.
