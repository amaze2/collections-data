The men may make fun, just as much as they please, Of our ''bangs\ and our \kinks and such things as· these, * From proof sheets of \Kings of Platform and Pulpit,\ by Melville D. Landon, Belford Clark Co., Chicago. * ChaHncey M. Depew was born on a farm near Poughkeepsie, in 1833· He cam,e of poor but respect- able parents. When a boy he worked on the farm, and the great railroad magnet, who now makes presi- dents, talks politics with Gladstone and jokes with the Prince of Wales, has many a time driven the cows home in the ra:in. Mr. Depew graduated at Yale College, studied law, was admitted to the bar, and afterwards became President of the great New York Central Rail- road. His aim in life seems to be to make everybody happy. He is Democratic in all his ways, takes every man by the hand, is loved at the Union League Club and is the honored guest at the Union College Alumni dinners, and of the St. Patrick, St. Andrews and New England Societies. Depew, Horace Porter and Inger- soll are perhaps the best after-dinner speakers of the age, and Depew is, perhaps, the best ''all -around\ extemporaneous speaker in this country. But they'll find after all, we're not quite so ''fiat,'' As they seem to suppose fron1 the style of our hat. Mr. Philander Sq~u.ihbs thinks himself\ very smart,'' But he shows himself stupid in aesthetic art, Which imparts such a charm to both person and face, As to constitute half of our beauty and grace. He makes a mistake if he thinks that our spine Was made to be curve:leis and straight as a pine, Or that our plain foreheads would look half so fair, As when covered with bangs made with gum and f21.lse hair. Just think of a bevy of pretty young girls, With \nary a bang,'' either straight or in curls! But with locks all combed back in a barbarous style, How n1any young beaux do you think they'd begt1ile? No, these beautiful ''gimcracks\ and'' cute thingum- bobs \ ' According to Oscar, the prince of all snobs, Are quite .indispensable things to maintain, Showing aesthetic taste, and a weH cultured brain. As for past generations-old grannies and such, We have lots else to do, so don't think of them much, Nor dwell on their fate which he seems to deplore, 'Tis a theme that we rather prefer to -t\gnore. No doubt they were frightfully horrid and plain, Devoid ofall taste .and ar._ aesthetic b1·ain, Not even a \pin-back\ or \sweet water-fall\! 'Tis a wonder, they ever got married at all. Your jeers at dear Oscar, are cruel and mean, Had you known him you would have shown less of · vour spleen, Why he taught us benighted Americans here, Aesthetics worth full fifty thousand, one year. Sometime the sweet darling is coming again, Like an angel of mercy in sicknes~ and pain, For his mission is two-fold, as Shakespeare foretold, For the taffy he gives, he is blessed with our gold. Now Mr. Philander, in spite of your sneers, Notwithstanding you1· slurs and your crocodile tears,'' Bangs, reddingotes, ulsters, sombreros and plume, Shall make us look gay as a sunflower's bloom! '' So there now- Yours aesthetically, ARAMINTA MEL YIN A HoLLYHOCK. Mr. Depew has an eye like an eagle and a smile which throws sunshine all around him. He is never too ~usy to see a friend, even if he has to say\ hail and farewell\ in the same breath. I say never too busy, but I now remember calling on him once when he sent out word that he was engaged with two rail- road presidents and could see no one, \not even on business.\ I told Buttons to tell Mr. Depew that I hadn't any business at all, only a new joke. \All right, Eli,\ said Mr. Depew, laughing through the door, \come right in. But first,\ he said, \let me tell you my dog story. \When I was about fourteen years old, my father lived on the old farm up at Pough- keepsie. One day, after I had finished a five acre field of corn, my father let me go to town to see a· circus. While in town I saw for the first time a spotted coach dog. It took my fancy, and I bought it and took it home. When father saw it, his good old Puritan face fell.\

It wori't produce any laughter to-morrow, and, I believe, if any one should go to the Judge to- morrow and ask him in the most polite manner the distance to Toledo, I believe he would pu:Jl out his revolver and--'' Another screarn from the audience drowned the sentence. Well, it was all very well that night, and would have ended in laughter had the Judge been perfectly sane, but he had incipient insanity, egotism, and when I got onto the train the next morning, to go to Toledo, the Judge came down with a big hickory cane, to chastise me for the joke. Five n1onths after this the Judge went to an insane asylum. This story is absolutely true, and I appeal to every tnan, woman or child in Napoleon to substantiate it. It is so different with Depe\V. A good story on anybody, even at the expense of himself,· is his deTight. The day after his return from Europe the last time, I was .in Cornelius Vanderbilt's room, in the Central Railroad office, which is next to Depew's, and told him a little story ab;..out Mr. Depew's experience on the steamer. I didn't know that the great original was listening to the story through the half open door. The story as told by the br:okers in the street ran like this: \ It seems that every evening, on the ' City of Rome,' a dozen or so genial passen- gers clustered in the smoking saloon to tell stories and yarn about things in general. Every soul save one in the party kept his end up. The one exceptional member of the party did not laugh or indicate by even a twinkle of the eye any interest in the funniest jokes, and was as silent as a door-knol;> at the best stories. \This conduct began to nettle Mr. Depew and the other spirits, and when the final seance came around they had lost all patience with the reticent and unresponsive stranger. Mr. Depew was finally selected to bring him to terms. They were all comfortably seated and in came the stranger. \'See here, my dear sir,'\ said Mr. Depew, \ 'won't you tell a story? '\ '' ' I never told one in my life.' ., \ ' Sing a song?''' '' ' Can't sing.' \ \' Know any jokes?'\ persisted Mr. Depew. \ ' No.' \ \ Mr. Depew and all were prepared to give it up when the stranger stammered and hesi ... tated and finally made it known that he knew just one conundrum. \ 'Give it to us,'\ said Mr. Depew and the others in chorus \. What is the difference between a turkey and me?' \ solemnly asked the stranger. \ ' Give it up,'\ said Chairman Depew. \'The difference between a turkey and

After the toasts had been made the Song to Old Union was sung and the alumni of the o1d college dispersed with a hearty resolve to return every year to their annual banquet and cheer for their loved Alma Mater.

I 5, the members of the class of '91 met for their annual election of class officers. As is not usually the case with an election of Senior Class officers, this election passed off without dissensions or ill feelings, and in almost every cas.e the following men were elected to their offices by a unanimous vote. At half past seven the real enjoyment of the evening began, namely, the filling of the inner man. Over one hundred Union Alumni sat down in the large dining room of the ICenn1ore to discuss the elaborate n1enu which had been prepared for them. The tables were arranged in excellent taste and were handsomely decorated with potted plants and flowers. The college colors adorned every breast, and the way that the famous '' Hi kah ! Hikah! Hikah !\ of Old Union rang out fro.m throats of these one hundred alun1ni showed that they had not fargotten how to give their college yell. Col. David C. Robinson, of Elm ira, acted as toastmaster, an u after the banquet proper had been finished, he called for the following toasts, aU of which were very ably and interestingly responded to, and • James W.

JIIITHOUT meaning in the least to dis- -~ parage the present managers of our foot ball and base ball teams, the question bas arisen in our minds as to whether the way in which our different athletic teams are now managed is the best way. It is only the financial part of the managerial affairs that we wish to criticise. As it now is, all of the money subscribed for the maintenance of our base ball team, for instance, and all of the money taken in at the gate at our base ball games, is handed over to one man and that man has the entire control and management of this money. He is obliged to consult no one but himself as to how he shall expend it and what seems to be the .wor:;t evil of all is, that he is not asked or expected to make any - sort of a report of the finances at the end of his term of official duties. Any one who thinks for a moment can see that under the present circumstances, base bal1 money or foot ball money could very easily be .mis-spent or n1isused to a very great degree and the college in general be none the wiser for it.. The mistakes which have been made in the past, and there have been many such mis- takes, in the management of college finances have never, we believe, arisen from any act · of dishonesty on the part of any manager, and it is far from- our thoughts to imply that any such thing ever will happen. No, these mis- . takes have been the results of the faulty system that \Ve have. One man having all this money in charge, and having no one in authority, with whom to consult, uses it in a way that fte considers is for the best interests of the college, and after he has so used it, he find~ out perhaps, that the majority of the students are severely censuring him, it may be for his extravagance, or it may be for his too extreme carefulness in not sp.ending money on this, that, and other thing, that it would have been policy to have done. In truth no one ought to find fauit with him for no one but hin1self knows how n1ucb money he has in his control and is therefore not in a position to pass judgment on his actions. This fault finding generally takes place during the base ball or foot ball season, but immedi- ately after the season closes, very few students trouble themselves at all about the n1atter. This sudden lack of interest arises from the fact that too often the expenditures of an athletic season have exceeded the receipts and the students are afraid that, if they are observed to take an interest in the n1atter, they will be asked to unloosen their purse \ strings and he1p the management out of its difficulty. All this is not very pleasant to record, yet such are the facts in the case. We feel sare that there is some better way than the one now in vogue, for disposing of this money question. We have some ideas upon the subject, but we want, if possible, to get other opinions than ours and so we will continue this discussion in our next n utnber,

THE ,CONCORDIENSIS. ss when we hope to be able to present sugges- tions on this n1 a tter from quite a ·number o nJen in college. In connection with this we are very glad to say that the manager of the foot ball team has· in'formed us that he intends, as soon as all of the foot ball subscriptions are pa.id in, tornake a complete report to the college, of the past season's rec-eipts and expenses, an.d the base ball manager has sig.nified his intenti9n .of doing the same thing at ·the close ,of. the :base ball season next spring. This is at least a step in the right dir~ection and the\se.tnen are to be very highly con1mended for taking this step.

ss THE CONCORDIENSIS. A TRIBUTE TO THE LATE _JUDGE VAN VORST. 1!T the last annual meeting of the New: ~York State Bar Association, Judge Noah . Davis made a most eloquent n1en1orial address on the late Judge Hooper C. VanVorst, who · graduated from. Union College in 1836 and who died in October, r 889. As Judge Van Vorst was one of Union's tnost weU-known . and honored sons, it certainly will not be out of place to print in this paper a few extracts • from Judge Davis's address. He first • sketched the hi'5tory of Judge Van Vorst'.s . practice in New York Ciiy, and spoke of him as ''a most painstaking, ,diligent, and faithful ju~ge, animated simply by an earnest desire to ad.minister justice according to law, and governed only by his conscientiou) sense of duty and right.\ Continuing Judge Davis said : \ In private life Judge Van Vo ast had many distinguished characteristics. In his religious faith he was firm and decided, yet unobtrusive. ·As a member ofthe clvurch to which he belonged, he was exemplary in zeal · and activity. In the charities of the areat • b ctty he took an active part. He made him- self a teacher in the work of the Christian ~id Society, taking charge on the Sabbath and some times on other evenings,. of one of its large schools and doing all in his power to lead the children who thronged the school into the paths of a pure, moral life. At the . time of his death Judge Van Voast was one of the vice presidents of the associat:ion and stood high among its honored members. It is fitting, there fore, that some memorial of his life and services be ente~ed upon its records, and that his associates and friends ' who knew him so well. should speak of him, that most complete eulo~um that can be spoken of any man : ' H.e had so lived that he was fit to die.''' -College journalism began at Daritmouth in I8oo.

OME people object to them. Indeed, .,_ ~ they cry out against them in unmeasured / terms. They say that they are brutal, that they run riot over everything., that the col- As a tnatter of fact, college athletics, to be justly treated, must be treated in a calm and unbiased way. Such a treatment will, we think, force upon us two convictions . I. They area uecessity. One might as well oleKe with the best foot-ball or base-ball tea-m draws the most men; in short, that 1nen go to college in these days for ath[etics, and not for study. This unreasonable opposition may be ex- plained in two ways: on the one hand, the opposers do not understand athletics ; they have no sympathy for them ; and it is an easy, and, perhaps, a natural thing for a m:1n to OJlpose that for which he has not the slight- est sympathy. If athletics are not in the blood-and in the blood of some men, strange 1 to say, they are not-you may ahnost always set down such n1en as judges that are partial , and unjust. ~ ! :Qn the other hand, the opposition is un- reasonable because it is directed not against the thing itself but against its abuse, and a degree of abuse, it n1ay be said, that in the main does not exist. Of course it must be, and is, acknow I edged that college athletics are in some quarters abused, but what good thing is not a bused, and especialJy in con- nection with the abounding spirits and vi- tality of youth ? But this is nothing against the thing itself. Take, for exatnple, foot ball, which is so soundly berated ·as rough and brutal. Foot ball is only such when played in an imper- fect, amateurish way. When scientifically played-. and our best colleges are fast re- ducing it to a science, it is never brutal, while even roughness is reduced to a mini- mum. try to sit down effectually upon a volcano as upon colrlege athletics. Ever since the time of Virgir's youth, vvho engaged in such fierce and earnest contests, have the youth of every generation been doing the sarne. Rather can we not go back to the first pair of boys? Cain and Abel probably raced and wrestled, and contended, just as boys always have done and always will do. In coBeg.e this athletic tendency reaches its climax. It cannot be otherwise from the very physical ,make-up and condition of young men. This fact might as well be admitted. It\ must be admitted in order to form an in- telligent judgtnent of the case. 2. TJzey are an advantage. They benefit the competitors then1selves. Men who other- wise ·mig-ht waste their strength by dissipa- tion, are ~con1pelled to increase and develop it by training. They must be temperate and well controUed ifthey are to stand any chance of success. Many a man has fe1t the benefit of this training all his life. Then college contests of various kinds af. ford to all the students an outlet for the over- flowing spirits and vitality that cannot be repressed. Better- to have this overflow into good channels than into bad, and college athletics when properly managed are pre- vailingly g-ood. Another thing is to be said in this con- nection, £. e, that college athletics tend to benefit the cause of education. The Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, at a recent Princeton dinner, put this point in his characteristic way; \1'he athletic contests of the col-

102 THE CONCORDIENSIS. leges,\ he saici, \have become the comrnon discussion and enthusiasm of mercha.nt, me- chanic, farmer, cowboy and miner. He b~ts his money on them. That leads tbe faculty to think that they ought to be discontinued, · but it calls the attention of all those classes by an indirect and athletic 111etbod to the • benefits of a higher .education. 1'he result · is that they all determine to send their boys to college, not for athletics, but for the learn- ing that they can receive there. This ac- counts for the fact that the extraordinary in- crease in the admissions of the Freshman class in every college in the United States commenced with an interest in college cHh- letics, and they have continued _to increase as the c~ntests of the undergraduates upon the field or with the oar have become more famous and widely published. But of course this article assumes a proper n1anagement of college athietics, and three evils are to be n1et and in great part over- come before they can stand upon a solid and enduring basis. Their abuse must be guarded against. Extremes are to be avoided. rfhey are not in themselves an end in college education, only a means to an end. 'The colle.ge is first of all to turn out men and not muscle, schol- ars and not atbletes. That this can be done is shown by the well known fact_ that fre- quently honqr men and leading christian men are athletes too. Another evil is the importation of men as special students because they are needed for · this team or that. This evil is an unmixed one. It degrades college at~letics, and, if· persisted in, will injure them in a permanent way. Indeed healthful college athletics can never exist until this custom is stamped out, and that for good. A third evil is the betting that bas become so con11non. This is not only nothing but an injury to all concerned, but it is an en-· tirely unnecessary thing. College contests are interesting and exc:~ttng enough, if it were only known, witbo.u t betting of any kind. Why can not :professors and students co- operate ag-ainst these evils, and so give a more healthfu 1 tone to athl etrcs? It is (:ertai:nly a hopeful sign that the for- mer are showing an increasing interest in college contests. Let this ~continue and grow. Let professors· fr,equently be seen upon the field and mingle ·with the students. Let them be made in some degree a part of the actual management, and the same with the better class of stud en :ts. Here, too, the signs are hopeful. Witness Stagg of Yale, the crack pitcher, at the same time prayerfully preparing for christian vvork; and Speer and Hector Co\van of Princeton, terrors on the foot-ball field, at the same tin1e training for foreign n1issionaries; while from Harvard come the following words: \Very rarely in recent years has Harvard sent a Mott Haven tean1 toN ew Yo:rk that has not had among the prize winners :several active mem- bers of her religious societies. The presi- dent of the Athletic Association during the past year was also president .of the St .. Paul's Society. The crew and th. e eleven usually have several representatives kom the Chris- tian Association and St. Paul's.\ Now that Union has taken_ a fresh start in athletics, and at a single leap has reached the front, let her by all means rnaintain her lead and even increase it; but let her do it by keeping in the van for a species of athletics that shall be clean, and fair, and enduring.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. !03 HERBERT D. HOBBS. (An Incident of Li.fe £n El Paso.) [Ever since the class of 'So graduated from col:Iege, information has been wanted of H. D. Hobbs, one or the mem hers of that clas~. After he left college it is believed that he went dc;wn hill at a rapid rate, for he was always a wild young fellow, and ''full of the old Ni,ck. '' Not one of his class mates, though, had heard or seen anything of him, and it was an undecided ques- tion as to whether or not he was yet in the land.of the lidng. Recently, however, two or three of the members of his class, much to their delight, ran across the following little sketch which told them that their old Hobbs was still alive and kicking. This story, which is true, by the way, will, th=refore, be of interest both to the members of the class of '8o, because of the information it gives, and to others of our readers, as it shows the way in which one L\?tion man gained a royal lit le .-Ed. J HE recent arrest of young Yturbide, bet- . ter known as Prince Yturbide, in Mexico, his mind, for the beautiful garments and flash- ing jewels of Mr. Hobbs filled the popular idea exactly of the attire of royalty. Seizing that gentleman's valise, he led the way to the sacred apartm,ent known in western hos- telries as \the bridal chamber,\ and rever- ently bowed him in. When he returned he beckonerl to the ;porter and, pointing to the real Yturbide, he said, \show this man to 4-11-44,'' indicating one of the dens of the garret. The news soon spread that a live prince was in town, and a crowd of tuft-hun- ters congregated at the hotel to get a look at him. Consequently when 1\f r. Hobbs ap- peareci he was the subject of such adulation as he had never before known. At first he attributed this to his beauty, but gradually the truth dawned on hin1, and when it did \ he played it'' to use his own expression, ''for all it was worth.'' Presently one of the bolder of the group pressed him to join in a bottle of wine. He promptly accepted. An- other and another followed in quick succes- sion~ and such a popping of corks and fizzing of Heidsieck were never before heard in the house. Meanwhile the autograph fiend put in an appearance in numbers. Dozens of plush bound volumes were thrust into his hands, and, nothing loath, Mr. Hobbs called for a oen and \vent to work. He had no idea J. 1 ecalls a curious episode in which he figured sotne years ago at El Paso. Those who have had the good fortune to encounter his royal highness rem em her him as a rather beefy, stolid young man, with a decided taste for plain English fabric in dress, and a bad habit of speaking of ''me brasses y' know,'' when he alluded to his trunk checks. However, he is a good fellow. In r 888 he came up over the Mexican Central, and stopped for. the day at El Paso, putting up at the Grand Central Hotel. 1\ mong the passengers on the train was a gentlen1an be~r!ng the ple- bian natne of l-Iobbs. Mr. Hobbs was the proprietor of a faro bank at Chihuahua, and t l? e proprietor also of a 1 ux u rian t black mous- tache, a five-caret diamond Ijn, and a very gorgeous suit of clothes. He, too, was a good fellow. They both arrived at the Grand Central at about the same time and regis- tered tog-ether, Mr. Hobbs inscribing his plain, every-day natne on the leaf and the other scribbling the royal abbreviation \Yturbide.'' rrhe clerk whirled the regis- ter around, and then rapidly sized up both guests to detern1i ne which was the prince. He had no difficulty w-hatever in. making up how to spell \Yturbide and simply made a hideous, undecipherable scrawl, bearing down as hard as he could, and permanently disfiguring each book. Some he embelished with such good old chestnuts as'' vVhen this you see, ren1 en1 b er me,'' \ Last but not least\ and \ Your's for health.\ It was that more than anything else which made the people afterward want to lynch him. While all this was going on Yturbide was prowling up and dow:·; the office, gruesome, morose and astonished at the universal neglect. When dinner was announced Mr. Hobbs was escorted to the dining room and seated at a t~ble by himself. The cook had risen to the •

To, tell the truth, Mr. Hobbs was by this time pretty well loaded, so to speak, and be- gan to put som.e vivid coloring in his royal ro~-e. He made strange, ornate jestures; he . punched the waiters in the ribs and shuffled · a pile of butter dishes through his fingers like a stack of poker chips, while Yturbjde sat among a lot of New York drummers, gnaw,ing a tough sirloin and cursing acoun- try :that had no respect for princes. As desert was being served a party of dis- tinguished M exica11s frotn Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grand, put in an appearance. They had heard of the prince's presence and carne to pay thei.r respects They were led in to the dining room an cl advanced to the tab1es, hats in hand. '~ I s this P ri n ce Y t u rbi de ?' · as ke cl t h e spokesman. '~You bet it is,\ saiu Mr. Hobbs, jocose1y. \ My father was the King of Clubs, and n1y mother was the Queen of Diamonds.'' ''Senor!'' exclaimed the Mexican, turning to the landlord, \this is an impostor.', At that mon1ent a florid young n1an pushed his way through the crowd, and remarked: '' My name is Yturbide, gentletnen. What can I do for you?\ The scene that followed was a painful one, and is easier imagined than described, Suffice it, that 1\tlr. Hobbs' effects were removed from the bridal cham- ber and deposited on the sidewalk, and the subJect is a sore one to this day to the genial landlord of the Grand Central. It may be well to add that the foregoing_ is not a fairy tale, but a narration of facts, and that there were several bun1ps that night on Mr. Hobbs' craniura that \\!ere not in his phrenological chart. -The members of the Psi Upsilon Society gave a very enjoyable dancing party in their roon~s Monday evening, February 9· ELI PERKINS ON AMERICAN HU- MORISTS. 11 THE JI,Fi_WKEYE :IVIAN, 11 (Biog·raphy a 11d ReminisceJtses.)

There were several \rery comforting things on that paper. For instance, Jerry and I al- ways knew on Monday that we would not have money enough to pay the hands off on Saturday, and we never had. The hands knew it, too, so their nerves were never shocked by a disappointment. We ran that way for a while, getting n1ore deep] y in debt all the time. At last, one morning, I entered the office and found Jerry looking rather sol en1n. \'Jerry said 1, you want another partner.'

At an early hour in the morning the parry broke up, but not before the Psi U's with their guests had serenaded at a n urn ber of residences in the city.

THE 'C0N'C0RDIENSIS. 109 ---~ ----- --------------=~========== - ~--- -------- THE COLLEGE BANQUET. N Friday evening, Fehruaty 20, the first 'Old Union, J. W. Ferguson. annual banquet of the undergraduates of Union was held. The affair, though the in- _ itia1 one, was a complete success. Between fifty and seventy-five students went over to Albany early jn the evening, and attended the \Brass Monkey,'' then playing at Jacob's theatre, and varied the applause with cries • of U -N-I-0-N, Hikah! Hikah! Hikah! _i\f- . ''Still through the coming time, Stand thou, in streng~h sublime, Crowned with th v fame.'' The Twelve Apostles. B. C. Li!tle. \The devi'l takes care of his own.''

During the repast there was hardly a mo- ment when the room did not resound with the songs from Pinafore, college songs, class yells, and a good old Union yell. The ban- quet was served in the Ladies' Dining Room of the hotel. The tables were formed in U form, the Seniors occupying the part crossing the head of the room, the Sophon1ores and Fre~hmen the outsides of the U, and the Juniors were between, separating the two usually belligerent classes. After the inner man had been satisfied, all set back from the table and awaited the \Feast of Reason.'' After a few very appro- priate remarks the toastmaster, Mr. Thon1as Lytle Walker, '91, called for the toasts which wers as follows: G. H. Daley. '·A child of our grandmother, EYt~; a female, 01~ for thy n1ore sweet understanding, a woman.\ 0 u r- College Victories, - A. \V. Hunter, Jr. \T'hus far· our fortune keeps an upward coun;e, And we are graced with wreath~ of victory.'' Syria in Union,. J. F.

Daley, '94· The banquet was, altogether, successful be yor. d every one's expectation, and the con11nittee of arrangements deserve a great deal of praise. The tnenus were novel and very tasteful and pretty, and all the details were thoughtfully n1ade out. The banquet broke up about three o'clock in the morning, and every one left the table with the thought that never before at any ban- quet had he enjoyed himself so thoroughly. The undergraduate banquet is a ''go.''
