Perhaps the n1ost noticeabl~ bit of college enthu- siasm during the last month was n1anifested by the Alumni of Union College, on the trip of the Laura 1vL Starin when it followed the naval parade in the recent celebration, enjoying trustee John I-I. Starin's hospi- tality. All Union was there with 111any Union sisters, and by cheers and every other n1eans they showed their appreciation of the ttnselfish and persistent work for the college interests of trustee Robert C. Alexander. . . . . . . . . Comn1odore Starin did a generous act in placing this vessel at the disposal of the alutnni, and when, in the course of the parade, the boat on \\vhich he chanced to be drew near the Union boat, he was - discovered standing near ihe pilot house,. and cheered and cheered to the echo. For n1any n1inntes every possible demonstration of affection and gratitude was given hiln across the waters. It has been my lot to observe and enjoy all sorts of college entertain- ments and college excursions,. but it is not often that the president of an institution has been willing to lay aside his duties and his interests to encourage the students by his own presence, as did President Web- ster on this occasion. It lent dignity as well as in- terest to the trip, and I venture the belief that he enjoyed it as much as the youngest undergraduate or the oldest alumnus present.-Editor of ''Peripatetic\ in.

EDITORS:. -------------- -- ----· -·-- -- - -- . All thinking n1en agree that the great ene1ny of our intellectual An1erican life is the low tone and diluted slang and trash of out newspapers. In a college paper one 1night naturally look for a beginning in journalis1n leading to better things. Instead of this, it really seen1s as if 1nany a n1an · supposes, that -vvhen he becomes an editor he must cease to think and speak as a gentletnan, and put on as a unifonn the veally, slangy, vulgar, familiar sn1artness of a fourth-class paper published in some little western town, whose uncultured editor gathered his editorial qualifications frotn setting type in a print- ing office, and beHeves that his bread and butter de· pep;ds upon his '• catering'' to the tastes of the lower strata of his readers. The editors of a college paper have the right to be smart i~ they choose;, but lo¥al~y to the college does not reqtnre the alumni~) to ass1st1n the production of literary n1atter, of which they dis- approve. I enclose a clipping fro1n a college paper, frorn the \Agricultural Department\ of the Ariel, the weekly paper published by the students of the University of Minnesota: vVith this edition of the A riel the present editor o£ this department, having a very generous feeling for my fellow students, and not wishing to see any of them miss the advantage to receive the benefit that is always desired from a good honorable position, and having held the position for over one year, could not conscientiously hold it any longer, thereby standing . in the \vay of some fellow student, therefore I resign. and have the pleasure of introducing to the readers of the A riel Mr. 'l'homas A. Haigh, a bright and ener- getic young 1nan of the class of '94, who no doubt will fill the position better than it has been for the past year. \Ve all wish him succes:s in his new \vorlc. ED. AGR. DEPT. Gramn1atically considered it is indeed incon1par- ably worse than anything ever seen in TIIE Co.NcoR- uiENSIS ; Efn tone, and thought, there haye been many such effusions in n1any college papers. But a letter ·which yon have published, I confess dmnpens the hope which your circular kincllecl. ''Snap\ and \rush\ are the very things which it is sn.icl highet education will repress ; and the glo,ying . \ assurance of your correspondent, that \ all rivals\ of the college itself \'Zui!l be laid out\ by the simple , expedient of '' borro\ving smnething of'' Snap and \ Rush, is the kind of loose assertion and silly gush that we expect a college training will n1ake ridiculous. Yon say in your circular of the r 6th ul t., that you will be pleased to have the a1ntnni ''give the· paper a trial.\ The proposition is a fair one and I accede That your correspondent sees fit to write such a letter is no concern of n1ine, but lest Snap and Rush and Gush shan constitute the editorial management of THE CoNCORDIENSis, I reserve the right to turn on then1, if I can, the battering of the alumni associa- tions and the ridicule of our best ne\vspapers, that to it. I have been a subscriber in tin1es past and when in college struggled to maintain a college periodical, and have \vritten more than once to new boards of editors in regard to the manage1nent of TuE CoN- coRDIENSIS. But like tnany of the alun1ni, I stopped subscribing, because I believed that the paper as con- ducted, was prejudicial to the literary and intellectual life of the college. i they may be retnoved in due tin1e to a less mandlin state of existence. I remain very respectfully, etc., etc., CHARLES c. N OTT. P. S.-1 regret to observe that your correspondent omitted- and I atn deeply grieved that n1ore careful editorial supervision did not supply the omission in brackets -1 regret, I say, to observe that he omitted from his list of ideal editors the nan1e of Spunk. , Spunk _is a great fellow and anybody can ''borrow __ .,

A n1id-\vinter exhibition \vill be held in which can be seen the results of this training; and such men as sho\v themselves worthy of· it \Vill be still further trained for the spring · gan1es. There ought to be at least three men Let every t:nan try to do his best for his coHege. If you \'ant to. see a successful tean1 next spring put yourself ,in training if you have any taste for athletics at all, and find out what you can do. This is the only way we can n1a.ke ()ld U nion'.s tean1· a success. in each even,t in the inter-collegiate contests. No n1an, unless extraordinary, can do his best in n1ore than two events. I fe rnay do well in n1ore; but if he \Vot.dd lirnit hirnself to t\vo, he ·would stand a better chance of winning. Let every tnan \vho has any athletic ~ateria.l in- bin1 put hirnself under training. \ 1 here ts no telltng \vhat he may develop · into. Chan1pions are made only by constant training. Even if one does not succeed in the first contest, the training and experience \vill help him in the future. Everybody is not expected to vvin the first time. L,et everybody take an interest in athletics. The success of a tean1 depends rnainly on the united efforts of all the students. 'I'ake a sprinter for instance.
