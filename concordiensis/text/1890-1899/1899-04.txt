One of the most important sales of college property in years was consutnmated on Thurs- day, March 30, when the trustees sold to the General Electric cotnpany seventy-six acres of the land lying to the east of the college buildings at a purchase price of $750 an acre, a total of $57,000. When the trustees decided to sell some of the large real estate holdings of the college, among the first bidders was the General Electric com- pany. The l?roperty they desired to secure was the tract nortl1 and northeast of University Place. The easterly portion of the tract runs directly north fro1n the intersection of University Place antl Union a-venue, and extends through the college woods to upper Nott street. 1.\he 76 acres purchased include all the woods from the western line to the extretne eastern end of the woods, except son1e little land that is owned by private parties. It is hardly necessary to state that the General Electric cotnpany has not purchased this land for manufacturing purposes. It has been pur- chased by the company in order that its officers and leading employees might be able to pur- chase suitable sites, on which to erect homes. It is not an investn1ent or a speculation, but a move of the concern that has at heart the best interests of its officers and employees. The protnoters of the plan have not yet formulated any definite plan, bnt that the tract will be laid out and large villa lots sold, is a certainty. It also is a certainty that on these sites there wiil be erected handsom,e hotnes, and the entire tract of woods will be converted into a residential section, not for General Electric people exclu- sively but for any who are willing to abide by the terms that will accompany the sale of lots. <St}e Evolutiol) of tl]~ Boo~. The final lecture of the winter term was delivered on Friday, March 24, too late for publication in the term's last issue of The Con- cordiensis. The lecturer was Mr. George Haven Putnam, the well-known literary man and publisher; and his thetne, \The Evolution Of The Book.\ Any inscription, Mr. Putnam said, which carries a record is in a general way a book, but a broader definition is any intel- lectual conception recorded so as to be of value to others. It is supposed that the first book, exhumed in the plains of Mesopotamia, dated back to 4000 years B .. C., though so1ne archreologists declare that these were produced in 5500 B. C. The earliest incentive to write books was to record deeds. The Greeks used to carry their thoughts from mouth to tnouth without writing the1n and it was 950 B. C. before the Greek poetus first took shape. This state of affairs called for the ext!rcise of memory in the hearers and of intense power of attention and discrimina- tion, more, in fact, than is found in the most intellectual audience of today. The earliest book that con1es fro1n the Egyp- tians was the Book of the Dead, which was published at the death of a man and buried with hin1. Hence the first publisher in Egypt was the undertaker. With the dawn of the fourth century came a developtnent in the shape of papyrus. This disappeared in the seventh century A. D. The part which Alexander played in the develop- ment of the book was next touched on by Mr. Putnam, who said that it exerted a large influ-

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ence upon the Roman book. In 401 occurred the destruction of Rome, and \ r.rhe City of . God,\ St. Augustine's book founded upon this · destruction was prominent in the literature of : the age. Great stress must be laid upon the contribution of the monks to the evolution of the book~ They kept alive the sparks of learning at a time when there was an absolute lack of literary activity. Casiadorus and Alcuin were mentioned as types of the tnedireval scholars who patronized literature. Alcuin it was who introduced the Roman script as the imperial text of the empire of Charlemagne. In the fourteenth century the great work of keeping written records was turned over from the monasteries to the universities, prominent among them Bologne, Paris, Prague, Oxford a.nd Heidelberg. After the universities came the great change from the script to movable type and the printing of books. The Chinese had printed books away back in legendary history, but Trajan never reached China and hence the invention of print- ing in Europe was postponed many centuries. Mr. Putnam closed his lecture with a descrip- tion of the work of Algus, the great Venetian printer' who did as much for his era as did Casiadorus for his. Mr. Putnatn said the his- tory of the book covers such a great period of time and there is so much to be said about the different stages in its growth, that his time per- mitted only a partial treahnent of the theme, and he had hence chosen the early history as his lecture.

One of the brilliant events of the season was the 1narriage of Miss Emeline Westinghouse, daughter of Mrs. Jay Westinghouse of this city, to Mr. Clark Winslow Crannell, '95, of Albany at the hotne of the bride on April 4th. The handsome residence was transfor.m,ed into a bower of loveliness by the profuse decorations of Easter lil:lies, palms and roses. Green and white were used to play an itnportant part as the wedding was decidedly an Alpha Delta Phi affair. 1:'he parlor had been beauti£uUy adorned with pahns, and lillies, and_ ribbons stretched from the staircase to the doorway served as an aisle for the bridal party. At eight o'clock the Rev. A. C. Sewall, pastor of the Reformed church, descended the staircase followed by Mr. John C. Van Voast, '87, Mr. G. A. Johnston, '95, Mr. E. S. Cran- nell, and Miss Ethel B. Smith, Miss Mary Lan- don and Miss Clara Westinghouse, the maid of honor. The bride followed, leaning on the arn1 of her uncle, Mr. George W esti ngh.ouse, and at the foot of the staircatie the party were tnet by the grootn and Mr. Ralph M. Crannell as best tnan. After the ceretnony a delightful reception was held, Mrs. Westinghouse receiving, assisted by Mrs. W. W. Crannell, the tnother of the grootn, and at 10 : 30 the couple left for the west. Mr. Crannell was a tnetnber of the class of '95 at Union and was editor-in-chief of the Con- cordiensis. Immediately after his graduation he took a position on the Mail and Express and his success since has been marked. During the present legislative session he has been the special representative of that paper at Albany, so the newly married couple wiil make their home at the capital city until after the close of the session when they will reside in New York. l-Iarvard has the largest faculty in the country.

'I'he Rev. Dr. A. C. Sewall, pa:st~r of the church, performed the ceremony before a la1-ge gathering of friends and relatives. The church was beautifuHy decorated, palms and Easter lilies being present in profusion. The ceren1ony was short but itnpressive accord- ing to the ritual of the Refonned church. The wedding tnarch frorn Lohengrin made a fitting prelude to the fortnal so1ernnization at the altar. A classmate of th.e bride at Wellesley, Miss Flagg of Portland, Me., was the n1aid of honor. Those assisting her as bridestnaids were Miss Hubbard of Syracuse, Miss Easton of Cam- bridge, Mass., Miss Hawley of New York, and Miss Ing~Hs of Sanely Hill. The best man was Guy Miller, '94, of Herk- imer; the ushers, Messrs. Richards, '95, and Sawyer, 'y5, of Sandy Hill, Harby, '95, and Phillips of New York University. Following the cere1nony at the church, a bridal supper was served at the ho1ne of the bride's parents, No. 238 'Union street. That the good wishes of all Union men go with \Father\ B1·own and his bride need ha1·dly be said. While in college as captain of a winning football tea1n, senior president, and ·manager of the initial glee club and in various other ways he distingu1shed himself. He was a. member of Psi Upsilon. Since leaving college, he has been engaged in the legal profession in N€w York, as well as at all times proving him- self a loyal alumnus of \Old Union.\ President Ray1nond in chapel Tuesday morn- ing, welcomed the students back and urged that there should be no lack of attention to classroo1n work in the midst of the many college interests. He said he hoped that there would be a large nutnber of contestants for the various comtnence- ment oratorical and essay prizes as com;mence- ment this year will be an especially important one. He announced that Hamilton W. Mabie, editor of the Outlook bas accepted the invitation of the board of governors of the universitv to be honorary chancel!lor, and that Gov. Ro~sevelt has promised to attend co1nmencen1-ent exercises .. Frank Bailey, '88, the president of the general alumni association is making speciai efforts to have a large number of alu1nni here during the week. President Raymond also announced two lec- tures to be given this ter·m. The first is on Friday of this week by Prof. Ira N. Hollis of Harvard, who lectures on ''0tJr Navy in the War with Spain.\ Ptof. llollis is a graduate of Annapolis and was once a professor at Union. Tbe second lecture will be on next week Fri- day by Prof. Walter A. Wyckoff of Pdneeton on \Some Phases of Industrialism.\ Prof. Wykoff is the author of \The Workers,\ and is remen1bered as having traveled throughout the United States in the guise of a common laborer. In concluding President Rayrnond said that although the work of last term was not so aood b as that of the term previous, yet it was entirely satisfactory and gratifying. He said that of the work of the freshn1.an class 93 per cent. was above the required standard ; of the sophomore class 98 per cent. ; of the j unio1· class 99 73 per cent., and of the senior class Ioo per cent.

IT IS WITH pleasure that the Concordiensis announces the recent marriage of two of the best known of Old Union's younger sons; Clark Wins- low Crannell, '95, and William Grant Brown, '95. The former was editor-in-chief of the Concordi- ensis during his senior year, and is now dis- tinguishing himself in journalistic work. The latter, always to be remembered as \Father Brown,\ who captained the famous '94 team on to victory, is now engaged in the practice of law with a bright future before him. rn behalf of the student body the Concordiensis ,e:xtet1ds warmest congratulations. the General Electric Cotnpany was a most happy business transaction. While the tract takes in part of the college woods, there still remains enough of that picturesque retreat to satisfy those who at first may have been greatly chagrined by the action of the board of trustees. The transfer takes in the land lying east of a line drawn from the intersection of Union avenue and University place, to Nott street, the northern boundary line of ·; the college grounds. The fact that this property will soon be built up with many beautiful hon1es . guarantees the most pleasant surroundings for the college. It will not be long before other residences will rise and this part of the city will rapidly build up. This will demand an extention of the trolley line, and then it will be about time for Union to complete her athletic field. We do not As WAS anticipated, the 1900 Garnet made its I like to paint visions, but now that the trustees appearance on Friday, March 24, and that it was have at last broken the ice, we feel that that bright in every way up to expectations was admitted by all, not excepting the editors of last year's book.

! I THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 ?;IJ~ pabHc par~ :Proj~ct. Several weeks agosom,e of the 1·esid.ent alutnni and protninent citizens of Schene-ctady set in movernent a project to have the ci:ty petition the legislature for pennission to acquhe the college pasture and transforrn the san1e into a public park. Petitions signed by over z,ooo taxpayers were sent to the council and that body appointed a cotn1nittee of aldern1en to investigate the rnat- ter nnd report its advisability. It was found that the college would lease the pasture for a long tenn of years at an annual rental of $5 ,ooo. The .comtnittee tendered a hea1·ing to the public last Monday e-vening and tnany good argutnents were presented on both sides of the questio11. T'hose who appeared for the scheme argued that the college brought a large atu·ount of rnoney into the city and that it was the duty of the city to appreciate this yearly benefit. 'There is great need of a park inasmuch as the city is rapidly growing 1nore populous and extensive, and such a park would add greatly to the cit) 's appearance and health. The opposition contended that although the city needed a park the collt\ge pasture is not very well adapted for this purpose as it is not thickly wooded. Further it was argued that the debt of the city is already too large to adtnit of any such addition as the affinnative proposed, and that this increased expenditure of n1oney would make the tax rates too high. After considerable deliberation the comtnittee decided, in view of the city's financial condition, that the park project be laid aside for the present. Thus the plan that 'vould have given to the col- lege sotne financial advantage and to the city a great source of attraction and benefit is to be given up for the titne being but not, it is to be hoped, permarrentl y. At a recent tneeting of the students of the four colleges of Syracuse university, the indebt- edness of the athletic association of $r,Soo was practically cancelled. John D. Archbold, the Standard Oil tnagnate and president of the university trustees, contributed $500 to the fund. A erew will be formed in the university. p~rsoQals. Professor Elton D. Walker has been appointed a nletnber of the side-path comrnission of Sche- nectady county. At the February tneeHng of the board of trustees Instructor John Ira Bennett was pro- moted to the assistant professorship of Greek. Mattice, ex-'1901, who was in the volunteer army, was on the hill exa1ninati.on week. He expects to resun1e his work with the class of 1902 next fall. Professors James R. Truax and Edward E. Hale, jr., attended the semi-annual n1eeting of the Hudson River Schooltnasters' club, which was held at Albany recently. President Ray- n1ond delivered an address on colleges. The freshrnan class held a meeting the last Tuesday of the tenn, and elected Frank T. Ostrander 1nanager of the baseball nine and James E. Finnegan captain. The freshmen have received a challenge from the Williatns freshrnen to play a gan1e duri11g the spring at either Schenectady or Williamstown. Eugene A. Son1 mer, '96, of '\Tonavvanda was in t9wn the last week of the tenn. At the annual 1neeting of the IIolland society, vvhich was held at Delmonico's, New York recently, Hon. Seytuour Van Santvoord, Union '78, of Troy was elected a vice-president to represent Rensselaer county. The current issue of New spa perdon1 contains an excellent likeness of vVilli::un J.

'The first lecture of the spring term was deliv- ered in the -cltapel last Friday afternoon and was listened to with interest by a large audience. 1'he speaker was Professor Ira N. Hollis, head of the deparbnent of engineering of Harvar.d university and a form·er member of Union's faculty. Prof. 1-IoUis is a graduate of Annapolis and his perfect fatniliarity with naval affairs enabled him to speak in a most entertaining S . ,., tnanner of '' Our Navy in the War with pa1n. Prof. Hollis chose a broad field for his dis- course. The work of the anny during the late war was contrasted vvith that of the navy. The speaker attributed the cotnparative inefficiency of the arn1y to the lack of suitable organization and training. \The knowledge of naval affairs,\ said he, ~'has become a profession, but many of the officers of the arn1y are appointed without regard to their military qualifications. The navy is tnuch better trained than the army.'' Mr. Hollis then expressed his views on the Phillipine question and gave argum.ents to justify Dewey's course in occupying Manila after destroying the Spanish fleet. \'Dewey he said, \ had been ordered out of neutral ports and was 7 ,ooo miles frotn home, while sotne of his vessels had a coaling radius of but 4,ooo 1niles. Again, who would have been responsi- ble for the lives of the foreign residents at Manila after Dewey had destroyed the fleet which was their sole protection?\ The professor then dilated upon the diffi·culties which beset Sampson at Santiago, expressing the opinion that his task presented 1nore ob- stacles than that of Dewey. The events of that metnora ble Fourth of July were rehearsed in detail and a glowing tribute was paid to the courage and zeal displayed in our navy. more ·coolness and preparatiou. Both officers ; and m;en tnust be caTefully drH1ed. The effici- ency of the naval acadetny is due more to the fait11fulness wal~ wi~ich the work is perforrned than to the exact scl~edule of studies prescribed. The atlnosphe11e, not the studies, rnakes the n1an. ,, 1'he speaker then dwelt upon the necessity of improving our navy in order to protect our interests among th·e nations and maintain our position as a world power. A navy is an expensive luxury but it is really a necessity. By its e.tfectiveness it may make war impossible. JuiiJ i or }-iop. 'The last junior l1op of the year was given last Friday night ~t Yates' boat house and was an ev·ent thoroughly appreciated by the many young people present. '1\'his hop was the £t·st social event of the spring tenn and tl1e first college dance since the soiree, so a larger number of students were p1·esent than usual.

On Saturday evening, March I r, the Coopers- town Literary association closed its pleasing course of lectures for r898-99, with an especially fi.n.e paper on \Greece by Dr. Sidney :G. Ashmore, professor of Latin in Union College. The doctor took for his main thought the ·effect of archeology on the study of Greek, hoLding that archeological research plainly shows that ~Greece was the ultimate source of most of the literary efforts of Rome. The speaker forcibly brought to mind the fact that the foundations of much of our art, literature, and even politics may be traced to the ancient Greeks. That archeology, with its broad avenue of research, demonstrates clearly the advantages to be gained in the study of the language, cuRtoms and life of a people who have left such strong marks of their individuality upon the nations which have followed them. The lecturer held the close attention of his audience for an hour, during which titne he touched upon the most important points of his very wide subject.-Otsego Republican. LIQiOQ v5. UQiversity of VertnoQt. Under conditions of favorable weather, and in the presence of an enthusiastic crowd, Union and Vermont university opened the baseball season here Wednesday, with a game on the campus. It was not with expectations of victory that Union avvaited the game, and the good showing that the teatn put up in the face of odds is surely an encouragement and an incentive to greater eflort in the future. While the game was one-sided, it gave ample opportunity for finding out the defects of the team, which may be remedied. The excellent work of the pitchers, the brilliant playing ofPurchase, and the phenomenal catchei of Capt. \Bill\ were the features of the game for Union. The work of the Green Mountain boys, both in fielding and in batting, is deserving of · much credit. The game began with Union at bat. From the start the boys ''had their eye on the ball,'' hut failed to make any great irnpression. V:ermont quickly started to make runs, and in. the first inning by a series of ~errors some of then1 entirely inexcusable on the part of Union, netted three runs. In the second inning it was practically the sa.me story, Y ermont making three tnore runs. At the end of the third inning the score was 7 to o in Vermont's favor. In the fourth, how~ ever, Union saved themselves from a shut-out. Purchase hit to White, and by an error reached second, Sn1ith and Grout both went out on fouls, but Lawton rnanaged to reac11 first and put Purchase over the home plate. In the fifth inning Mallery succeeded Edwards whose pitching had been excellent throughout. The rest of the gatne had the same story, Union failing to score and Vermont piling up 14 runs.

Burrows, Printer, -414 State Street, Schenectady. N. Y. THE SEASON'S future in track athletics was settled on Monday morning at chape1 meeting, when, only a few weeks after having given $500 for baseball, the students responded so quickly for their part of tile $250 necessary for the track team. It is certainly gratifying to feel that the student body is so deeply interested in the success of the college on the einder track this year, and now that the necessary financial support has been given let there be reg-ular and conscientious training on the part of every man in college with any athletic ability. There is an old proverb about, \saying nothing and sa.wing wood,\ and that's exactly the attitude of ''the inhabitants of that old Dutch settlement just outside of Fort Orange.\' AT THE very opening of the baseball season, a few remarks may be in order regarding the attitude of the student body toward the team and the games played on the campus. No support is better than that given by attendance at the games, and by hearty systetnatic cheering. It is the duty ,. of the students, then, to advertize the games as much as possible, and use their influence to 'B.ecure .a large attendance of city people and be Jlresent ;: themselves. Furthermore, they should gather together in groups of thirty or forty and ch<;er the team and individual players at every opportunity. 'I' he college yell, strong, enthusiastic and con- tinuous has been as a stimulant to a teau at a critical point iu the game, and has helped win many a victory. Come out to every game and show devotion to Union athletic interests. A·t such a time, college spirit should be strong enough to n1.ake study monotonous. Victory is far m.ore pleasant to recall than defeat, and let every one encourage the team by every legititnate means, so that the players may feel more keeuly their responsibility, and see that the students have con- fidence in them. I..~AST YEAR the athletic association, realizing- the great importance of preparatory school athletics, promoted and held an interscholastic meet, the first of its kind under the auspices of 1Jnion college. A large number of invitations were sent out to the high schools and academies of the state and twenty schools responded and sent Tepre- sentatives. The idea of bringing the preparatory schools together in friendly contest was a.. most happy one and the meet was a decided sttccess. These n1eets create athletic spirit in the prepara- tory schools, and develop material for the college tea1ns. The athletic successes of other coileges prove the very great value of athletic act~vity in preparatory schools. The larger colleges and universities are every year receiving 1nen who have taken a prominent part in high school athletics .. While the smaller colleges are drilling a lot of green material, the larger colleges are putting on the finishing touches. Union draws her students from a large nutnber of schools at no great distance from Schenectady, and the greater incentive given to high school athletics by means of an annual interscholastic athletic meet between the schools who send men to Union every year, will go far towards strengthening the college teams and placing our athletics on a higher plane, than the 1:.

The success of this plan depends in a great measure upon the personat interest taken by students already in college in the athletics ·of the school from which they came. They should use every means to persuade their old schools to take part in the second annual meet which is to be held in May. There should be a larger number of schools entered than last year, for the more schools participaUng, the greater the interest. The reward will be well worth the effort ·expended if Union can in this way develop a stronger interest in preparatory school athletics in The annual conference of the newly elected Y. M. C. A. presidents of the eastern colleges was held at Hamilto11, N. Y., April 6th. This conference ·is held eacl1 year for the purpose of bringing together the leaders of Christian work in the colleges, to discuss ,methods and plans for this part of the state. persoiJa Is. John T.

Next Thursday, the 27th, the Musical associa- tion start on their second long trip of the season, the New York trip. The first concert is to be given at Coxsackie and from there they w1ll go to Newburg where they will give a concert Friday night. Saturday morning the clubs leave for New York where the principal concert of the trip will be given at Carnegie lyceun1 on the evening of the 29th. The prospects for this-concert are very favorable at present since our alumni in New York are .taking a lively interest in it and are working hard to make it a success. the co-ming year. Mr. llarry W. I-Iicks, who visited tTn1on a short ti rne ago was in charge of the conference. Delegates vvere present frorn n1ore than sixty colleges including West Point J\11 r. J. C. McCracken, the well-known athlete frorn U. of P. waf:> one of the speakers. He is president of the Y. M. C. A. at that university. The sessions of the conference were tnost interesting and instructive, and the interest n1anifested by the delegates as well as their reports was indicative of the influence the asso- ciation is exerting in the colleges of this country. Union was represented by George E. Raitt, 1900. Raytnond D. Fuller, 97, was on the hill Monday. l-Ie is .studying law at Rochester. Rev. Clinton VV.

Wyckoff of Princeton, author of ''The Workers,\ addressed the students in . the chapel last Friday afternoon. Prof. Wyckoff chQse as his Fiubject H Some Phases of Indus- trialism.\ His ready, forceful handling of the topic showed how wen he understood it and how deeply he hitnself wa.s interested in it. His · own personal enthusiasm forced itself strongly : upon his audience. ·The lecturer divided the development of· modern society into three distinct stages-the ancient slave order, medireval feudalism and industrialism. The latter is but in its early stages of growth, having had its beginning but a short hundred and fifty years ago. \It is the en1ergence of contract as the relation between men of free competition and of the free play of the law of supply and detnand.\ Forty or fifty years ago the social relation was greatly different from what it is now. Many itnportant social probletns have arisen as a result of the recent startling growth of indus- trialistn. Prof. Wyckoff mentioned as promi- nent instances the pro hlems of the unemployed, of increasing population and of the sweat shop systetn. No one of these is however, the gen- . eric social problem. That of the unetnployed, he claitned, is purely a local problem and can • be 1net by local remedies; that of population does not yet concern this country; and that of the sweat systetn adrnits of ready solution by the means of honest, capable business men beating t]1e sweaters on their own ground. The present tendency toward the centraliza .. tion of capital and labor is what is bothering so many people today. '\The centralization of capital has come to stay and we tnust adapt our- selves to it. As labor becomes educated and responsible the friction between it and capital becomes less. Organized capital deals as a · unit but not to a unit. When labor becomes unified the friction with capital will practically cease. \ At the conclusion of the lecture in response to a request from .Dr. Raymond; the lecturer gave an interesting account of how the idea of his ce}:ehrated trip ac1~oss the country originated. '' I have seen you spoken of in the newspapers as an amateur tramp,\' said the president later. ''I cannot aspire to have reached the condition of a tramp,\ came the quick reply, .u but I can say like Robert Louis Stevenson in his descrp- tion of his experiences among steerage pass- engers that, in all my Journey, I wai never taken for a gentle.man.\ fUumQi Notes.

There were six candidates all of them recent graduates of the Albany Medical college, and the best paper was submitted by Dr. Waltet :Ew Huggins, '96. Dr. Huggins also tried for a position in Dr. Strong's sanitarium at Saratoga, ~nd there too he received the a ppointrnent. The latter was the better position and he ttccordifigly resigned as house physician at the hospita.l in thi$ city.

A. ·elected the following officers for next year: President, George E. Raitt, 1900; vice-president, Willard D. Brown, 1900; recording secretary, Stephen S. Reed, 1900; corresponding secretary, W. E. Wormer, 1901 ; .treasurer, D. E. Griffith, 1902. On Saturday last Union played the second game of the season on the campus with the Schenectady Citys, a local amateur team. The game resulted in a victory for Union, and though loosely played was interesting. Union's teanl.- work was a noticeable improvement over that in the game with Vermont and made it evident that steady and rapid progress in that line may be expected. Edwards was in the box for Union and his pitching was very satisfactory, although both he and Fredericks were hit free! y. Parker was behind the bat and his work as backstop was without a flaw. Hegetnan held down the initia] bag in place of Wiley, and Lawton was on second in French's place who covered left field. The only other change was at right field where Mallery played Robinson's position. In the first inning Scheaectady on two singles and a two base hit secured three runs. Union did not score in the first but after that the order was reversed and from the third inning on, there was little doubt as to the result, Union sending in runs every inning while Schenectady did not send another man across the plate until the sixth . . 1nn1ng. In the second inning Parker made a single and came in on a wild throw to first. In the third, singles by Hegeman, Mallery and Law- ton, and a three nagger by Grout netted Union three runs. In the fifth the Schenectady pitcher weakened and Union brought the score up to I I-3· In the sixth Clark went into the box for Schenectady and DeFreest was substituted at second. In this inning Schenectady made three runs. The seventh resulted in no score for either side. In the eighth the Schenectady fielders made several costly errors and Union secured five tnore runs, n1aking another in the ninth. In the last half of the ninth Schenectady ,made one more run, and the gan'l:e· closed with the score 17 to 7 in favor of Union. The score in detail : UNION. A.B. R. lB. P.O. A. E.

''''To six thousand men Union college has been :something more than a name. To three thousand , not yet wrapped in eternal silence, it is .still a synonym for four years of intellectual struggle and Some V\reeks ago there appeared in the New York Sun a maHcious article directed agatnst Union college in which the writer announced that the college was in \ financial distress'' and was likely to close its doors unless its income was increased :at once. The tone ·Of the whole article was one of hostility, and it attracted con- s.iderable attention. The New York Mail and Express of April r8, takes violent exception to the Sun's report and devotes nearly a column in answering the · distorted facts in the Sun. In part it says : ' intellectual joy, <:>f growing discernment of the vague outlines of the world ·of thought, of dawning enthusiasm for noble ideals, of delightful human companionship, of ·communion with as rare sur- roundings of natural beauty as ever gladdened the heart of prosaic man, and helped shake off some grains at least of its earthiness. \It is high time the truth should be sent out on its pilgrimage. Let it be known, therefore, that Union College is not 'in distress. ' It has not been 'standing still for ten years.' The number of undergraduates has not been 'falling off,' and President Raymond has not 'publicly announced that the college must close its doors unless its income be increased~ ' ''The facts are that in all that makes a college useful and honorable, Union has been steadily advancing during the last decade. The standard of attainment both at entrance and at graduation, has been raised until it stands on a par with any institution of its rank and size in the country. Th.ere is no college faculty in the land more loyal, more devoted and tnore efficient. There are over two hundred and fifty students, as many as can be properly cared for under present conditions. Among the board of trustees, faculty, alumni and students there is the utmost good feeling and per- fect harmony. The old college on the Mohawk, just entered upon the second century of its existence, is doing better work than ever since its 1· birth, and it sees no reason why it should not go !' on_ with undiminished usefulness and prestige through its second century. , ''Union ' is indeed a smaU college,' as Daniel Webster said, with quivering lip and choking voice in the defense of his own alma mater before the supreme court of the United States, 'and yet- and yet, there are those who love it. ' '' The Troy Times commenting editorially on the matter says : \Union college, located in our neighboring city of Schenectady, is an institution held in such high esteem, not only in this vicinity but throughout the country, that its friends will read with great pleasure an authoritative denial of reports recently put in circulation regarding its financial con- dition. The article from The New York Mail and Express republished in another column of the Troy \Times\ today is based on intimate knowl- edge of the facts. The college has a long and honorable record, and under its present excellent management and able faculty has a bright promise for continued and increasing usefulness. Syraease OQ tl]e Water. A sudden interest in aquaties has been taken at Syracuse university, and a fully equipped navy is springing into existence. The faculty and trustees recognize the part that is played by boating in bringing the institution before the public and making it popular ; hence they are \Like every other institution of learning, it ' needs money. Like every other, it is always in a I receptive attitude. Its executive ofiicers habitually practice the most rigid economy consistent with th.e maintenance of the high standard of educa- tion. But Union college does not approach her alumni and her friends in forma pauperis. Her splendid domain at Schenectady is without a dollar of debt. It possesses an endowment, not large enough to enable it to do all it wants to do, but substantial and growing. It has a large and loyal body of alumni upon whom it could con- fidently call in case of 'distress.'

These evening gatherings near Memorial ON NEXT week Friday wiH occur the annual spring athletic meet. The meet will be held on the :college oval and there should be a large attend- ance. There will be no admittance fee, so that there should be a large nunber of city people present who are interested in the college. As this meet will determine in a great tneasure the material which will be chosen to defend Union in the two intercollegiate meets, competition for places will be close. Every athlete in college should enter this. meet and do his best. A great deai depends upon the outcome of the Albany and Schenectady meets. The eyes of the alumni are centered on the college, and they are watching the spirit with which the students are devoting themselves to athletics. Victory means much for Union. There is one thing that the college would prize highly and that is an athletic field; a fund has a1ready been started for that purpose. The alutnn.i will be willing to push this athletic :field to completion, when they see that the college is playing a prominent part in intercollegiate ath- letics.
