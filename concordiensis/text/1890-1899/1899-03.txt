E Franklin, '83, wrote to president Eames of the Musical association, saying that l1e was very much p'leased with the way in which the boys had rendered his song, ''Union beside the Mol1awk Vale,\ and that he felt that another verse could be added appropriately. The song with the new verse added, is : UNION BESIDE THE MOHAWK VALE. Come now to the campus, all true sons of Union With one accord in song your voices -raise : Proclaim loud their glory, those walls <>ld and hoary, The college where are spent such happy days. CHORUS. Then come, Union's sons, ne'er let the glad chorus fail, That tells in proud measure how f<lndly we treasure Old Union beside the ).!ohawk vale. If true sons are jewels, a. mother adorning Resplendent Alma Ivlater's brow witb light, Her children wide-scattered are ev'ry-where loyal To Union, to our country and the right. CHORTJS. 'Tis there that are nurtur'd both knowledge and honor To strengthen us for life's uncertain ways, .And there oft in mem'ry those rare da;y.s l'ecalling, We'll tul'n our thoughts to sing Old Union's praise. CHORUS. We certainly feel very grateful to Mr. Frank- lin for this additional verse to the song which is by far the most popular of Union's songs and which has been used as the opening number at every concert of the Musical association since its organization. It is hoped that all the students will learn the new verse as soon as possible. The Ohio Wesleyan Transct·ipt prints a list of the faculty who do not cut chapel.

The athletic council of Wiliams College has taken the following action : ''In accordance with the resolution adopted at the college meet- ing on the r8th of January, the WiUiams Col- lege athletic council h~er.e by votes to withdraw from the New England in:tercollegiate triangular league, the withdrawal of the football and track athletic associations to take effect immediately, that of the baseball association at the conclusion of the schedule previous! y arranged for the sea- son of 1899·\ During the baseball season Williams will be in two triangular leagues, the old one with Am- herst and Dartmouth, and the new one with An1herst and Wesleyan. This means a season of unusual interest, witl1 six championship games on Weston field. The Dartmouth gatnes will be regarded with unusual attention for the very reason of the rupture, and the interest in the new ~member of the league will naturally be given full expression at each Williams-Wesleyan game. UNION VS. WATERVLIET. The college basket baH team again met defeat last Saturday night ; this time at the hands of the VVatervliet Y. Mi C. A. The game was hotly contested, only two baskets being thrown, one in each half. Union did not score, thus giving the gan1e to Watervliet by four points.

THE CONO·ORDIENSIS. 'The work being done by the Cuban Educa- tiona[ Associatio·m brings frequent inquiri;es fro.tn different parts of the United States, and the Association pr·esents the foHowing in response 1 . . . to sue 1 tnqutries: First. A large number of applicants from Cuba and Po·rto Rico ask fot· allotment to the educational institutions of the United States ; tnany of these applicants exhibit intelligence to a marked degree, but unfortunately they are de- ficient in the EngHsh language, besides having very little money. Second. Parents, guardians and friends of these young men a1·e doing all they can, even to the extent of offering to go under bonds, or to mortgage their land, in order that these appli- cants n1ay cotnplete ·their education in the United States. Third. A large nutnber of educational insti- tutions in the United States, through their presi- dents, professors and boards of trustees, have offered to receive and instruct these young men, in the tnost cordial way, without a dollar's com- pensation. Fourth. Frorn two to three hundred dollars will be needed to give a student his boaxd and incidental expenses during a first year's school- ing in the United States, besides the free tuition scholarship he is to receive. Fifth. T'o rneet the etnergencies, the Associa- tion suggests the following plan: In each city or town which has an institution willing to receive one or two of these young tnen let there be fanned a cotn1nittee who will stand sponsors for the boa1·d and incidental expenses of each young man for one year of trial work at school. As soon as such committee informs this Association they are 1·eady to receive a student, we will allot to the1n one whom we believe to be a competent and reputable student. Sixth. Persons who do not care to engage directly in the work and wish to aid, can do so by giving the tnoney direct to the Association, and with such gifts express their preference for the institution where they wish the money ex- pended. These gifts should be sent to under- signed, who will acknowledge the rece~ipt and furnish anv informati:oti); 11egarding the work \ being done to aid these young n1~en. Address, G. K.

The editor, in '' The Pro- , gress of the World,\ discusses the Phiilippine situation and Arnerican prospects in those islands, as well as the bearings of the ratifica- tion of the Spanish treaty on the future of the Filipinos. Col. Willian1 'Conant Church, editor of the Army and Navy Journal, contributes a sketch of Gen. Elwell S. 'Otis, whose efficiency in subjugating the refractory followers of Agui- naldo is winning the adrniration of the world. There are two articles on Philippine native types and characteristics, one of which was written by Senor Caro y Mora, editor of the Voz Espanola, of Manila. These articles are both illustrated fron.1 a remarkable series of photographs now published for the first tirne. Dr. William Hayes Ward, who has 1·ecently returned from an extended journey tht·ongh Porto Rico, con- tributes an article on present-day conditions in that island, with special reference to the effect of American occupation on the welfare of the people. Several of the young Cuban leaders in the reconstruction of their country are sketched by George Reno. This nutnber of the Review also contains articles on the late President Faure of France, on \An American Farmer's Balance- Sheet for 1898,\ and on \ Characteristics and Possibilities of Middle Western Literature.\ The Yale glee and banjo clubs have given to the treasurer at Yale university the sum of $86o, taken from the receipts {)f their concerts during the se:ason of 1897-98, to be used in assisting needy and deserving students.

A special meeting of the Managing Commi~t­ tee of the Americaa School of C~assical Studies in Rome was helcl last Saturday at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York, and a number of representative professors of classics £rom Amer- ican colleges were present, among them being W. Gardner Hale, of the University of Chicago, ·Ch~ir.man; S. B.

President Raymond's titne for these days is fully occupied as will be seen frotn the nutn ber of places at which be is preaching and speaking. Returning from a trip last week: and only stop- ping here for a few hours he left Schenectady early Tuesday n1orning and attended a meeting of the Board of Trustees held at New York on that day. Fron1 New York Dr. Raytnond went to Boston to represent the college at the annual banquet of the New England Alumni association on Wednesday evening. Then he left :fo.r a southern trip and will attend the session of the Elorida Chautauqua at De Funiak Springs, Florida. I-I ere Dr. Raytnond will deliver a sermon and two lectures before the association and he will, in all probability, remain south for a week or more so that he will not be back when, on March 10, St. Clair McKelway lectures here on \ The Makers of Modern America.\ 1 ~Q Old :Boo~ of SoQ~S. A copy of the'' Songs of Union,'' compiled by Edgar B. Van Winkle, '6o, was recently presented to the college library. It is a boo~ of twenty pages with papet covers, and was printed by C. Van Eenthuysen, Albany. The compiler states that he had two ~main objects in 1naking the collections : '' First, to preserve the songs, which if handed down fro.m ciass to class soon hecotnes rnutiiated or entirely lost. Union's few songs deserve a better fate. Second, to strengthen and increase the iove of college songs, and that spidt of song writing, which so far has only flasl1·ed brilliantly at intervals among the students at Union. For nothing serves to unite fello·w students like sing- ing together old college songs.\ Among the contents are the following: \Ode to Alma Mater,\ by J. W. Brown, '32, which was sung at the first sen1i-sen,tennial celebration of the college, July 22, r845; \Ode by H. P. Tappan, '25, which was sung during the dinner at the first setni-anniversary of the Philomathean society; ''0d~,\ by E. H. Sears, '34, sung on the fiftieth anniversary of Dr. Nott's presidency, July 25, 1854; \Alumni Song,\ by F. Lud- low, '56, whicn was sung to the air of \The Sta.r Spangled Banner.\ ''Burial of Logic,'' the '56 class song ; '' Dirge,\ of the class of' 56 ; \Dirge of the class of '57· The three last have for their themes pleasant recollections of Whately's Logic. The book also contains the two songs of Fitzhugh Ludlow that are still sung ; the ''Terrace Song\ and the '' Song to Old Union.\ Be~ides these songs, distinctively Union, there are a number, which, although originating else- where, soon becatne popular in all the colleges. Books of this character give us glimpses into various phases of Union's past history, and we commend the spirit which protnpts the alumni to preser..t to the library material of such his- torical interest and value.

'fhis is the first time in some years that the meet has been held in the '' $\ym '' and everyone should be present fi.Hed to the neck with college spirit. After the meet there wi11 be a basketball game, which in itseif ought to draw a large attendance. p. L. J\IERRI:MAN, 1901, w. L. SHEEHAN, 1901, ,• SHALL the basebail schedule be ratified? Cer- tainly not, unless more money is subscribed. Not qutte three hundred dollars have been raised, and at least two hundred more are necessary in order to carry out the schedule. The students have been very slow in subscribing, and do not seem to realize the necessity of prompt action in the matter. A magnificent series ()f games has been arranged, the best in years, and we do not believe that the students would care to see the schedule curtailed. But unless two hundred dollars more can be raised some of the gatnes will have to be cancelled. The situation is rather discouraging for those who are training for the team. They cannot enter into the work with much enthusiasm vvhen so little support is being given them. A number of tnen are trying for positions and the prospects are bright for a very strong team. The work done by the team last year ought to be sufficient evidence of a suc- cessful season this spring, because nearly all the men who composed that teatn are now trying to make the team again. There is no reason why Union should not have a successful season at base- ball provided the students are willing to give their financial support. Every one who has not yet done so should subscribe now. Every one can afford to give something. Don't let a little sacrifice stand in the way. Remember that it is for the glory of \Old Union\ that we are striving. 0. P. WAGONER, 1901.

Burrows, Printer, 4!4 State Street, Schenectady. N.Y. ON :BEHALF of the student body, The Concordi- ensis wishes to thank Mr. C. E. Franklin, '83, for giving to us a third verse of his already popular Union song. It may not be generally known that Union is one of the very few colleges that possesses two characteristic college songs. Any number of colleges are constantly complaining because they have no song that they can call their own. Every college yearns for a song that can draw out a feel- ing of love for Alma Mater, and that can bi11d men together as brethren . The reverential strains of the ''Song to Old Union'' written by Ludlow, will ever thrill the hearts of Union men ; and the charm of ''Union Beside the Mohawk Vale,\ can never weaT away. They both bring out that good feeling character- istic of Union men, that Mr. Wheelock spoke of a few weeks ago. We assure Mr. Franklin, that through the loyal sentiment of his song, he has made for hhnself a warn1 place in the affections of every true son of Ut1ion. The canvass of ea~h class has been delegated to the class collectors, and they should make a special effort to see all the members, and urge upon each one the necessity of giving a subscrip- tion. But we hope that every student will look ~t this matter in the right light, and not wait for the class collector to come to hhn but pledg-e himself voluntarily. 1 l 1 ' , : ( ~ 1 1 ~

The service it rendered in lighting up- the Round Building for the sopho- more soiree is an example of its great u~efulness. It is not very often that the outside world sees the need of Union College, but here i3 an in- stance where, through true friendship and gen- erosity, the facilities of one department of the -college have been greatly increased. Waiter B. Snow, mechanical engineer of the B. F. Sturtevant company of New York, addressed the tnetn bers of the engineering divisions in the college chapel last Friday morn- ing. His subject was : '' The Influence of Mechanical Draft Upon the Ultimate Efficiency of Steam Boilers.\ The lecture itself was a most interesting one, and was rendered the more so by a series of steriopticon views. · Margaret Jeneson, who died in r88r. In 1865 Mr. Wilkie accepted the Principalship of the Oak Park schools, and remained there nine years, going to the Englewood schools, of which he was made Principal. He was appointed Superintendent of the schools of the Town of Lake at the same time. After five years of work on the South Side Mr. Wilkie returned to Austin, being appointed Superintendent of the schools of that suburb, which position he filled for seven years. In I 886 he gave up his educa- tional work, going into the employment of the Provident Life and Trust company. Two chil- dren, Albert C. Wilkie and Bessie M. Wilkie, survive him. lQterGolleQiat~.

6 THE CONCOR!>IENS18. f'( eUT EQ~ Ia Qd JllUfl\f}i BaQqu.et. The ann:ual reunion of the Union ,College Alutnni Association of New England was held Thursday evening, March 3, at the hotel Bruns- wick, Boston. The gathering was an enthusiastic one, and the hopeful words spoken by President Ray- mond, and the cheering songs rendered by the college quartette called forth much applause and genuine good-fellowship . . It was '' l:adies' night,\ it having been voted at the last dinner that the wives of the alumni should b:e invited to share in the pleasures of the . occasion. In the abbence of Pres. Hurd, of tne associa- tion, who was prevented from being present on account of illness, the secxetary, D. D. Addison, '83, presided at the dinner. The first speaker of the evening was President Raymond, who outlined the work being done by Union College students, clinching his argu- ment of an excellent studious condition by stat- ing that in the last report of the registrar it was shown that more than ninety-seven per cent. of the students' marks showed a standing above the required mark. The president then passed to a consideration of the financial condition of the college, tracing the growth of the annual income-derived from property owned in Long I5land City, which was long the sole source for current expenses-to the present satisfactory conditions, under whi,ch expenses a11d revenue are more nearly equal. The president also reported the recent receipt of two legacies, one of $I5o,ooo and another of about $35,ooo. Some of the property near the college catnpus in Schenectady, N. Y., will also sQon be sold, the president said, which will bring $z5o,ooo or thereabouts. Some hope was also held out for securing sotnething frotn the Fayerweather estate, now in litigation. Plans for future college work are to be con- fined to legitimate undergraduate courses, the president said, and no attempt will be 1nade to do university work. President Raymond spoke rather disparagingly of the prevalent college ambition to secure large numbers of students, and indicated his desire of limiting Union's roll at 400 tnen, at the ,most, with a capable, well paid faculty of 40 or 50 n1en for this number. He closed by saying that the outlook for Union was never brighter than at present. The next speaker, Prof. Ira N. Hollis, of Harvard, who was fonnerly connected with Union, said he was in thorough sympathy with the views of President Raymond, and showed that the tendency of the universities was to ' adopt the English system of dividing into .small · . schools or colleges, which still retained their connection with the university in the fullest 1neasure. He said education is not that which is acquired from books or lectures, but is the upbuilding of character frotn the personal con- tact with and inspiration of the instructors. l-Ie instanced the N:aval academy at Annapolis, where the cadets are brought in contact with men who have accotnplished something for their country, and where the achievernents of naval officers who have acquired lasting fan1e are ever fresh in the 1ninds of the students. Dr. De Witt C. Durgin, '56, formerly presi- dent of Hilldale college, spoke pleasantly of recollections of his life at Union, and made a strong plea for leniency in dealing with the indiscretions .of which the undergraduate is somethnes guilty. He paid a high tribute to Dr. Nott, and made 1nuch of his ability in deal- ing with young men. He closed by saying that he hoped the day might not be far distant when wotnen might becotne stnden ts at Union on equal terms with tnen. The following officers were elected for the . comtng year : President, Theodore C. Hurd, '56; Vice- Presidents, A. W. Archibald, '72, De Witt C. Durgin, ~56; Secretary, D. D. Addison, '83 ; Treasurer, F. T. Rogers, '8o; Executive Com- mittee, F. G. Noyes, '53, A. L. Bennett, '87, G. A. P. Codwise, '82. St. Elmo Goetz, ex-1900~ who has been ill with diphtheria in New York, has returned home. Neil G. Medbery of Ballston and William F. Sheehan, formerly rnembers of 1901, wete in town last week Friday.

Ba$~et Ball. RuTLAND Y. M. c·. A., 54; UNION, I6. {From the Rutland Herald.} The Y. M. C. A. basket ball team defeated . the Union college team in the association gytnna- sium last night by a :score of 54 to r6. The ; Rutland boys played a rattling game, hut had · to work hard for every goal. The members of · the Union team seemed ,to lack experience,. this being the first year that the college has had: a basket ball team, but they made .a plucky 'fight in the second half, when the game was hopeless. Thebo was said to have been the only oue of ' the visitors who had played previous to this year, and he certainly played the best game for the visitors. At the end of the first half the score stood 25 to 8 in favor of the local team. The second half was mainly a repetition of the first, and the final score was 54 to 16. The visiting team was given a light lunch after the game. Here is the way the teams played: Rutland. Field. } Royce. · Botsford. Hulett. } Hulihan. Fot·war.ds. Center. Guards. Union. { Thebo.

At the end of the first half the score was 16 to 2 in favor of the home team, and it was evident that the association boys had . the game well in hand. In the opening of t~1e second half the visitors made a rush an.d by clever passing made several baskets, but were not able to check the association team, who finally won by a score of 28 to IO. The gam·e was characterized by ci·ean playing on both sides. Both teams were in excellent form. The line• up of tiil.e- .teams was as follows : Union. Thebo. } Anderson .. Paige. Fenton. } MaBery. ·. !Baskets. Center. Guards. Glens Falls. { Coon. Dow d. Miller. { Smith. Burnham .. The first regula•· 1~ehearsal for the minstrels was held in the ,c liliapel on Thursday evening under the direction of Robert M. Eames, '99, who is to have charg-e of the ,musical part of the undertaking. The ~rehearsal was held at seven o'clock and lasted 2r1 l~our and those in charge feel much encourag-ed at the outlook. The chorus will be co~nposed of the glee club and its substitutes together with the following men: Potter, 1900; Morss, 1902; Bahny, 1902; Mal- lery, 1901; Argersinger, rgoi; Hackett, 1901; Enoch, 1902; Bothvv·ell, 1902; Lawton, 1900; Crim, 1902; DuRfia,m, 1900; Hawkes, 1902, and Merriman, 190'1. Rehearsals will be held every week from now on until the perforrnance is given. Clarence W. Da:rHng of Syracuse received the first award at the a:nnual intercollegiate oratori- cal contest which was held in the Rochester Y. M. C. A. Music hall Tuesday night between representatives of Syracuse university, U niver- sity of Rochester .a.nd Union. Mr. Darling's theme vvas \Christ and Mohammed,\ and his oration was a brilliant effort. '' Imperialisrn or Union\ was under- taken by S. Fraser Langsford of Rochester, and the subject of H. J. Hinman of Union was \Use and Abuse of Power.\ The con1n1ittee of award was Joseph Connor, associate editor of The Post-Express; the Rev. Murray Bartlett, rector of St. Paul!Js church, and the Rev. J. P. Silvernat of the Roc hester Theological setninary.

THE FACT THAT Union was defeated at the tri- college oratorical contest at Rochester on Tuesday evening should not be ground for discouragement. We cannot always be winners and we are perfectly satisfied with the decision. Every Union man knows that our representative did his best, and that such was no mean effort is proved by the attitude of the Rochester press. He reflected credit upon the institution, and, after all, isn't that about the most important thing? IT WAS certainly gratifying to note the ready response to the call for baseball subscriptions at Mon. day's college meeting. The advisory board in estimating the season's expenses put the figure at the lowest possible mark, $500. Two-fifths of this was raised by subscription prior to Monday morning and at that time the necessary remainder was forthcoming. This means that the schedule will be immediately ratified. The undergraduate body has now done part of its share towards making the season a successful one and for the present the responsibility rests upon the men who Address all communications to THE CoNCORDI- ENSIS, Box 213, Schenectady, N.Y. are trying for positions on the team.

Subscriptions to the Concordiensis and Parthenon are now dt.te. All the Alumni who have not paid for their papers will help the management greatly by doing so at an early date. ATTENTION is called to the fine course of lectures to be given during the remaining two weeks of the term. Dr. St. Clair McKelway's address on, \The Makers of Modern Atnerica,\ is to be fol• lowed by an illustrated lecture next Thursday evening by George Edward Graham, the corres- pondent of the associated press with Adtniral Sampson's fleet.

The students' actio11 on Monday morning showed their faith in the team and now . there should be no stone left unturned to carry out the fine schedule which Manager Gatnbee has arranged. marri~d. Miss Lydia A. Bullock and Mr. Armon Spencer, Union '95, were married at the home of the bride at Schenectady, February 28. Mr. Spencer is now located at New York city, where he is engaged in business. On Tuesday, February 28th, occurred the marriage of Ellwood G. Blessing, ex-'94, to Miss Anna B. Coonley of Altamont. The cere- tnony was performed at the home of the bride's parents by Rev. Frank F. Blessing, '89, a brother of the groom. A number of Union students and alumni were present at the ceremony.

'The following clipping taken from the edlitor- ia~ column of the New York Tribune of Feb. 27 has come to my attention, and, as a rnatter of general college news, 1 take the Hbertr of : sending it to The c·oncordiensis. ATHLETIC MORALS. We have discovered a new theory of morals. ].t has been promulgated by the undergraduates of Hobart college, and comes to us in the colutnas of a Western .New York newspaper. Just at p~esent it is applied to college athletics, but there is no reason why the principle is not equally sui;ted to politics and finance. Hobart is a small college with a large athletic ambition. It has not a student body suffici~.mt to furnish athletic teams of the strength de~~~ed. Therefore, there has been some temptati<>a to iutrod uce '' ringers '' into the college teams. A ' 'ringer,'' we believe, is a professional or eih.er athlete who enters the college simply to pla.y and not to study. The faculty, however, would_ not tolerate \ringers hence the tears of the Ho\bart boys. They wanted to put a well known local baseball catcher into their nine, but the faeulty said he was not prepared to enter college, an.d-th.ey would not allow the deception of calling llbn a collegian. This decision, reports the newspa...}i)er, ''has been received with great disfavor by the majority of the undergraduates.'' They h·ave also another ~rievance. ''Last f.all Manager 13re~den was unable to procure a coach for the foot baH .tea.m, owing to a lack of funds. But this could ea~ily have been remedied, for Norton, the Cornell cen.tre of '96, offered to come to Hobart and pur.s-ue a course, providing his expenses were paid. He was to coach and play. But the faculty refused to even consider it, and because of this several of the ·men stopped training. '' The sentiment of the •Geneva students on the subject is summed up br one authority as foUows: ''Athletics at Hobart sb.ould not be expected to be as pure as at large institu- tions. There is some excuse for Hobart, with about eighty students, to play 'ringers.'\ How beautifully these hopeful young men ·might apply this theory to banking. Your bank is a small one, therefore, you should not be expected to be as honest as in a large institution. Y()u can't succeed if you are. How beautiful it is in poliUcs! You are behind in the game. If you don\t cheat you can't win. It suits life in general. Yoa. ·must cut your ideas to suit your circu'mstances. The There has long beetil! a fiction that the obJect of college athletics was to improve the men. They seem not to be so regarded in Ge11eva. If the Hobart boys are correctly reported, it is evident that there was need f0r the ~aculty to take hold with .a strong hand and inj,ect some notions of morality into the student thinking on athletics. ALUMNUS. psi U. Smo~er. One of the tnost pleasant evenings of the season was that spent with the Psi Upsilon fraternity at their lodge last Friday. The smoker given by them was in every respect a success as their many guests can testify. The evening was pleasantly spent in smoking, cards and biUiards until the refreshments ·were served about eleven o'clock. After that aU adjourned to the parlor where college songs were sung and a prolonged game of \ hot tomale \ brought the evening to a fitting close. The guests present were Messrs. Champion, Eames, Gayetty, Doran, Hegeman, Hotchkiss, Ro\vell, Noel, 1-Iuntley, Vander Veer and Weston, '99; Davis, Dunhatn, Edwards, Francis, Lawton, Lawrence, Pike, Potter, Raitt, Read, Rogers, Tuggey and Winterberg, 1900; Bahler, Bennett, Brown, Cheesborough, McNab, Miller, Parker, Wagoner, Warner and Wight, 1901 ; Gulnac, Small, Coffin, Finnigan, W. Yates and R. Yates, 1902, and from the faculty, Professors Ashmore, Hofftnan, Walker, Truax, Pepper, Opdyke, Bennett, Pollard, Jones, Tracy and Eddy. Prof. Truax anneunces a two hour a week elective for next term on the study of the orators. The text book will be a new one, \ Modern American Orators.\ The juniors elect·ing Anglo-Saxon with Prof. Truax have finished the Anglo-Saxon reading ia the course and next week will take up the study of Sweet's First Middle English Pritner.

N~w tt:ol)ors for a U~Q~ioQ JnaQ. .Acting as the representative of the administra- tion, Charles Emory S,mitb., '61, Postmaster- ·General, will make a trip to Cuba to investigate ' the conditions there, and on his. return stop at , Thomasville, Ga.,. where the President will be, :to report the result of his observations. Mr. Smith will start next Wednesday and will land at Havana. While in the island he will visit Manta.nzas to confer with Gen. Wilson, who is in command of that :military depart- ment. Mr. Smith, most of all, wants inforn1a- tion respecting the present condition of the people of Cuba, the n1anner in which they adopt thetnselves to military gov·ernment, etc. It is presumed that his conclusions will be used for the future guidance of the President. The journalistic instincts and training of Mr. Smith are expected to be of great value to hitn in this hasty investigation, and his selection is coniidered fortunate. l51}~ tgoo ~arQet. Nearly a year ago the 1900 Garnet Board was organized and since that time it has been steadily at work on the annual, until now, its labors ahnost completed, the board announces that in all probability the book will be on sale next Friday. This news w:Hl he greeted with delight by ~11. Of course the book is \ away ahead\ of any previous issue of Union's annual. That goes without saying. The editor-in-chief is Seward H. French, and upon hin1, more than anyone else, rests the credit for the Garnet's success. The business part of tl1e venture has been looked after by E. M. Sanders, and his assistant is Howard P. Dunhatn. The secretary of the board is Philip L. Thomson, and the two asso- ciate editors, Frederick M. Davis and Leland W. Boorn. Wagner Van Vlack is athletic editor; Melvin T. Bender, literary editor; G. W. Featherstonhaugb, assistant literary editor, and George E. Raitt, art editor. The Garnet this year has .many features. It is first of all distinctively a university book. The literary deparbnent is £uH of good things, among the contributors be~ing : \'Father\ Brown-Foot- ball ; '· Cal.'' Enders-· -Baseball ; \ Maj.'' Twi- ford-Track Athletic·s ; G. A. John , -\The Last Plug Hat Parade;'' and \Joe'' O'Neil-\ The Beginning of the Banjo Club.\ Special attention. has been paid to athletics, this department cove:ring ten pages more than last year. The typographical effect will he a pleasing :change, and the art department stands out prominently in the book's merits. There are a number of new clubs enrolled, and readers of last year's Garnet will be glad to see number two in the series qf \unknowns.\ The grinds are sharper than ever, and the book closes with an accurate calendar of last year's ·events. The first edition, which is to appear on Fri- day, is of a limited ntnnber and will be dis- tributed only to those whose orders are in the hands of any member of the board before Thurs- day night. The price of the book is the same as last year, $r.25. DAVID MuRDOCH, '45· Rev. David Murdoch, '45, died at his home at Peekskill from. heart disease on March 13.

Burrows, Printer, ·fl:.4 State Street, Schenectady, N. Y. THE FEBRUARY number of ''New York Educa- tion '' has come to our table. The tnagazine is edited and managed by C. E. Franklin, '83, of Albany. As the name implies it is devoted to the educational work and interests of New York state. This number contains a very interesting article on ''The Pronunciation of Latin,'' by Prof. Ashmore, which should be read by every Latin student in college. A copy has b.een placed on file in the Library reading room, where it can be found at any time. The magazine is replete with other good things and is well worth reading. THERE is probably no greater nuisance about the college than the poor condition of the walks during wet weather, especially the patl1 betwe~n South colleg~ and Washburn hall. This path is more frequently used than any other yet it is in the worst condition. Any quantity of cinders has been spread over it, but constant use has ground the cinders to powder, and just as soon as the path becomes wet, the walking is very disagreeable. The ground is so low in part~ that the water lies· in pools along side the path, and keeps it continu- ally water soaked. The ·grade of this path could be raised about a foot at a smcall expense, and the amount of travel that goes on at that point daily, warrant its speedy repair. AT PRESENT the outlook for the college seems to be very bright. The Schenectady alumni are con- sidering a scheme which includes the lease of the pasture for a city park. If this .offer should be accepted by the trustees, the money, together with that about to be realized from the contemplated sale of other college property, ought to go far towards putting the college finances on a sound basis. Moreover, the college will soon have the use of the Armstrong bequest, which will bring about $250,000 into the treasury. While the Concordiensis does not wish to thrust any of its immature ideas iRto a question of such importance, yet, as the organ of undergraduate sentiment, which will soon ripen into alumni thought, some expression of that sentiment will no doubt be pardoned. The plan of the city alum.ni to lease the pasture for a city park seems commendable. A park neatly laid out would greatly enhance the view from the higher level of the terrace. It would add directly to the beauty of the college grounds, and the students would have a quiet place for rest and study during the spring and autumn months. The landscape would be far mot:e pleasing to the eye, if it were made into a park than it is in its present condition, or would be if the land were cut up into building lots, for, in the latter case, the view that would be presented would consist of nothing less than. the back yards of the residences that would ultimately be erected, with their ash barrels, weekly washings, wood piles and other regalia,-a prospect not very attractive, and still less inspiring to the student mind. The Schenectady alumni would do well to enter into their project with heart and soul, for if the plan should prove successful they will have done an. excellent thing for the co11ege.

·~ ·~ I . 1 The Coi)cordiei)sis VoL. XXII. UNION COLLE·GE, MARCH 25, 189'9. No. 22. ·<i:eorQe Edward (i,ra:t}am's r.e~eture. On the evening of Thursday, March. 6, the chapel was crowded with an audience eager ~o h1ear George E. Graham's lecture, '' On the J3r,idge with Schley.'' In a few words Pres. Raytnond intvoduced the speaker as one especially fitted to tell us about the naval operations of the late war, for he was not only present at the scene of hostilities but it was his business to see and he had all the facilities possible under the circumstances. Mr. Graham opened his lecture by contrast· ing ancient modes of naval warfar·e with those of the present time. In the days of Ron1an supre1nacy battleships cam.e alongside for engagements, a bridge ~ras dropped between them and the crew of one boarded the other and fought a hand to hand battle. In those days, of course, there were no shells nor iron-clad vessels. When the shell was finally Invented and put to use it was made in the form of a hollow sphere filled with a high explosive with a fuse attached. The trouble with this was, that explosion usually occured too soon or too late, depending on the length of the fuse and the distance of the enen1y. These served their pur- pose very well for ships of wood or thin iron plating, but could not injure the steel battle- in. the 13 inch shell thei~· destructive force is terrific. The largest shot fired at the battle of Santiago was the 13 inch sheU, while Dewey used nothing larger than an 8 inch at, Manila. · Mr. Graham showed his audience some dia- grams and some pieces of sbells :from which one could get a very fair idea of their size and appearance. He a[ so had two ''grains\ of powder on a string. The striking feature .of these so-called grains was their size, each being · about the size of a one inch cube. The lecturer spoke of the signal practice which the gunners took and of the great success which was due to this. At a distance of six and one-half miles the Indiana fired a shot into the 1n~dst of the city at the third trial. In fifty tntnutes the whole fleet had the range and con- sequently had the city at his mercy. That satne night the non-con1 batants were removed from the city and two days later Santiago had sur- rendered. Mr. Graham was on the battleship Brooklyn from March 28 till August 20, when the flying squadron arrived in. New York at the con- clusion of the war. He proceeded to give an account of the war from day to day as seen from the flagship. To aid hitn in this he used a stereopticon which was well supplied with views ships of today. In the Spanh;h war our navy used the type of taken by him during the campaign. The first picture was one of Sch4ey boarding the Brook- lyn, then followed views of the officers of the ship. He told of the various mascots, the most interesting of which was '' Old Billy,\ a goat, the special pet of the tars. The marines bad a fox terrier. The ship started out with a fawn on board but it broke its leg and had to be left behind. shell vvhich is now used by all the best navies of the world. The shell is cyHndrical with a cone shaped point. The conical part is made of solid steel while the body of the projectile is hollow and filled with an explosive. In the base is a \plunger\ which explodes the shell when its flight is suddenly checked. Around the projectile are two brass bands which, being On May 4, news was received of Dewey's of soft metal, do not injure the rifling of the victory and a picture was thrown on the screen gun. These instruments of destruction are fired showing the sailors as they \cheered the ship\ from the gun with a velocity of 2,100 ft. per sec. , when Commodore Schley announced the result and as the weight runs as high as I, 100 pounds ofthe battle.

THE 0'0NO'ORD1ENStS., It was not until May I3 that the squadron got orders to proceed to sea, an order which was :gladly received by all on board. They sighted ·Cuba on the 2r st and a dreary sight it was. This was near Cien£ugos, over £our miles fro1n our nearest coaHng station, and it was here that the first atten1pt was made to coal at S'ea. After maintaining a week:' s blockade at St. Plague, Schley proceeded to Santiago where, on May 29, he sighted the Christobal Colon in the harbor. A blockade was for,m,ed by the whole Atlantic squadron and maintained :for nearly five weeks. A picture was shown of Hobson and his volunteer crew and others, taken on June 3, relating to the sinking of the Merrimac. Also other pictures iUustrating the damage done by the frequent bombardments along the coast during the blockade. Morro Castle was seen to be practically unharmed, while the audience was amused by a picture of two of its guns· · bearing the date 1678. Mr. Graham next gave a thrilling account of the remarkable battle of July 3, in which the pride of Spain's navy was hopelessly wrecked by the gallant sl1ips under Commodore Schley. He gave special praise to Captain Wainwright of the Gloucester for his plucky fight against the two torpedo boats and his brilliant victory. After witnessing the great loss of life on the Spanish side, the commander of the hospital ship was astounded, as was all the world, by Schley's report of'' one dead and two wounded.\ Mr. Graham had been struck by the calmness of the tnen during battle, the deliberatness with which the gunners took airn, .and the disdain of both officers and tnen for the aim of the Spainards. This battle put an end to the fighting in Atlantic waters and the squadron left Cuba for New York without any further exciting inci- dents, arriving in port August zo, six days a.fter the signing of the protocol. Mr. Graham's lecture was certainly one of the best which has been heard in the chapel this year. His delivery was excellent, every word being distinct and intelligible to every one in the house. He seemed to hold his audience frotn beginning to end without any trouble and frequently excited applause. He is now stationed at Albany, berng the head of the Associated Press Bureau at that place, and it is to be hoped that he will find tim,e to give us another talk sometitne in the future. After the lecture delivered in the chapel last Thursday evening, the sophomores assetnbled at the Edison hotel to hold their annual banquet. The affair was entirely sopho1nore, for the main purpose in view was to arouse a more earnest class spirit, and interest in all the .affairs of the college. From ten o'clock, when toastmaster GardJler Kline opened the proceedings, until four o'clock in the tnorning, the tirne was tnost enjoyably spent. Proprietor Brown gave a delightful menu after which toashnaster Kline called for the following toasts : Herbert Fuller .................... Welcome to 1901 Everett T. Mallery ........... 1901 on the Gridiron W. E. Van Wormer ........ 1901 and the Fair Sex Leopold Minkin .............. 1901 in the Minstrels Arthur S, Golden .................. 1901 in Society John E.

W. Miller, Jr ........ 1901 at the F~osh Banquet The toasts were all bright and sparkling, and the responses by toasttnaster Kline were always to the point. Besides the regular toasts, each member of the class was called upon to give an impromptu speech, which he did with good will. At the table there were seated some former members of the class of 1901 ,-Sheehan, Cooper, J\1estner, Keller and Schumacher. Col- lege spirit was . manifested throughout the pro- ceedings by songs, and Jells, and the affair was . tn every way .a success. Much credit is due to toastmaster Kline for the success of the affair, and also to the com- mittee,- Fuller, Merriman, Golden and McNab. . ,. .;j .. ·.=.· ';.

Although edited by the junior class, it is a book pertaining to the whole college. It is a history of the students for the present year. Every freshman especially ought to have a copy, for in no other succeeding annual will there be found represented all the classes that are now in college. METHOD is everything. And when we discover a good method we cannot refrain from saying a good word for it. There are some courses of study that ~can be pursued by the single text- book method, but there are ever so many more that require collat- eral readings along special lines, in order to gain a comprehensive knowledge. This latter method has been adopted in some departments of the col- i lege, especially those of History and Sociology. r: There are some who do not appreciate the valae of these library assignments, and. look upon the work 1 with no other thought, than how to cover the read- ings in the shortest time possible, and remember ' enough to pass an examination. They seldom take into consideration, that the thorough reading of well known authorities will broaden their con- ception of a subject. They do not appreciate the fact that the instructor has spent a great deal of time in arranging the material for readings, so that the student can get the ~most benefit from it. Although the benefits resulting fron1 this method may not be appreciated now, there may be a time i when almost every student who has neglected this i' opportunity of becoming acquainted with the fore- i most authors, tnay regret that he took so little i: interest in the work. The work that is done along these lines should cause the student to think more profoundly than he has ever thought before. The question is a practical one, and the work is practi- cal if regarded in the right light. It is not the reading merely that is of value, but the ideas that are set in tnotion thereby. The reading is only a means to an end. Collateral reading pursued in a systematic tnanner on special topics cannot help but impregnate the mind with new ideas, and cause a desire for further knowledge. And along with this desire the mind grasps the application that these ideas have to practical life. The future can be governed only by a comprehen- sive knowledge of the past and present. And it is through the writers who have studied past and present conditions, that the college student is enabled to bec01ne acquainted with causes and results of phenomena, and to reason frotn them. But too much of a good thing defeats the very purpose for which it was intended. Assignments for reading should not be of such length, that the student only has time to cover the readings, and none left in which to form opinions and make com- parisons. 1N e do not believe that ability is to be measured merely by the amount of work that any class may be able to do. Ability is measured by the quality of work done as well as by the quan- tity. It seems far more important that a class should have a clear understanding of a subject, than that it should cover a large quantity of read- ing matter. We are glad to note a disposition tending toward a reduction in library readings, and we hope that the change will produce better results. ; I' ! I ~ ·~r· ~~ • •

; I' ! I ~ ·~r· ~~ THE :CrONOORDIENSIS. In the last issue of the 'Con.cofdiensis a com- munication was published taken fron1 the New ' York 'Tribune, and criticising the athletic mo~als at Hobart coll:ege. For the benefit of those who have not read it, Hobart's answer to the accusation, wh~ch appeared in the Tribune on March 3, is published below. To the Editor of the Tribu1ze: SIR:- Inasmuch as your editorial ''AthleHc Morals'' published in the T,ribune of Feb. 27th, holds up the student body of Hobart College to ridicule, justly deserved if the facts are as alleged, you will no doubt, be willing to hear the the other side. For some time past articles discrediting the ath1etic standing of Hobar~t CoUege have appeared in a Rochester paper, culminating in a despatch from Geneva, February 22, representing the students as incensed against the pt·esident and faculty because a well known baseball player was refused admis- sion because unable to pass entrance examinations. This decision did not produce any illfeeling between the students and faculty and the students are indignant at being misrepresented. The undergraduates of this college feel the need ·of purity in college athletics. The college is a member of the only league in the state where such purity is required, and there is not a college in the United States where athletics are on a purer basis than at Hobart.

[Brooklyn Eagle, March l.] Under the auspices of the committee on educa- tion of the C1vitas club, a ,meeting was held yesterday afternoon at the residence of Mrs. T. Alfred Vernon, chairman of the committee. Dr. Frank S. Hoffman, one of the faculty of Union 'College, was the .speaker of th~ occasion, and he gave an interesting and comprehensive talk on \Municipal Life in Gern1any, '' basing his own observation on several years' residence in the Gennan empire. The German cities, said the speaker, were growing more 1·apidly than the cities of any other ,country, not except- ing those of the United States. They began to develop about 187o, and their growth was the result of a serious, scientific study on the part of the people .of the plans of a city,. and the adop- tion of a plan which com hines the rectangular and radial systems. This has proved en1inently satisfactory. Concerning the schools Dr. Hoff- man said the secondary institutions were in the same stage of development as those of the United States, but in the matter of technical schools the Germans were the superiors of the A~mericans. The theatre and the opera are looked upon as valuable adjuncts to the schools, and as the cities support the theatres, the actors occupy a different position in that country to what they do in this. The method of caring for the poor was explained in detail, Berlin being cited as an example. This city is divided into 250 districts, with a corps of especially appointed persons to attend to the needs of the poor people in these districts. The method of draining was also the subject of con1ment and in conclusion Dr. Hofflnan said that the differ- ence between German cities and those of the United States lay in the fact that the former enjoyed hon1e rule, this plan of government having been in force since r8o8.-Daily Union. In Germany one man in 223 goes to college ; in Scotland one in 520, in the United States ·one in 2,ooo and in England one in 5,ooo. '' : i ' I I l l i' I, I ! I 'I ' ,, I
