To the Editor of The Concordiensis :- },rom my point of view lessons for collegians taken from the study of lives whieh cross thei1· paths are often advantageous, particularly when such lessons tend to show for unse]fishness in the world's work daring a long and successful career. The study of a record thus made brings a benefac- tion to young men, leaving an impress which is not effaced.

THE preliminary oratorical contests from ·which -were selected the contestants for the prize speak- ing. which is one of the features of commencement Vireek, revealed a marked decline in the interest -which heretofore has been manifested in this line of eollege eff0rt. For some unknown reason the number of men who appeared in these contests was very much smaller than in former years. Only two men appeared for the Sophomore contest and both of these \'ere so poorly prepared that the committee refused to appoint either candidate. Five Juniors appeared and while from the stand- point of preparation they were much ahead of the Sophomores yet neither the interest manifested nor the number of contestants were such as. it should be. The number of contestants for the e4· tetnporaneous was smaller than ever before. Such a spirit of indifference should be combatted by We again wish. to remind our delinquent sub- scribers of their obligations.

'' Despite the disagreeable weather, the at- tendance at the 46th commencement was quite inrge, the fair sex predominating. Seated on : the platform were the faculty and board of, trustees, the Hon. Amasa J. Parker, president : ·of the board, presiding. As an overture Hold- ing's orchestra rendered ''The Wizard of the Nile.'' The Rev. Edward G. Selden, pastor of the Madison Avenue Refonned church, offered prayer. Alexander E. Menzie delivered the -salutatory, taking for his subject ''David Dudley Field and His Contribution to Jurisprudence.\ His ren1arks were practically an appeal for the New York state code, and the subject was !' . decidedly well handled. Herbert J.

Each Ha1nilton rooter brought . four girls with l1im and their part of the grand- stand was a mass of blue.

BURPtOWa, PRINTER AND BINOEft, ICHENEOTAtH, tt. Y, Now THAT the faculty has ,conceded to the request of th~ student-body fo1· a regular hour for college meetings and removed the badly -trampled fifteen-minute rule, the students should emulate theil· courtsey and not abuse the privilege . .. THE musical organizations with characteristie zeal and faithfulness are getting into better form than ever for the commencement concert. New rnusic is being rehearsed and the event bids fair to outstrip the high standard already established. The prospects for next year under Mr. Sinclair's management are very bright . WE wish to call attention to the article among College Notes, headed \No Vandals at Harvard.'' Such acts of vandalism as are deseribed in this article are of too frequent occurrence on the Union college campus. Our own student body would do well should they follow the example of the Har- vard students in compelling a.ll sueh offenders to· leave the coll~ge. WITH the changes about to occur in the faculty, we shall lose sev~ra'l mentbers of that honorable body whoin every student shall regret to see leave. Professor Patterson has been a power in the re- organization of athletics as well a..s in the class room, and in both lines of activity has won the sincere admiration of those with whom he bas came in contact. Professor :Buck and Doctor Reeves have also attained a warru. place in the und.ergraduate heart. 'V e wish the1n all success in their new fields of accomplishn1ent. So MUCH has been said in the past concerning the library-and that too, of an unfavorable nature-that it is a po~itive pleasure to assu1ne a different tone aud indulge in a little ,gratulation. The librarian,. -with the efficient assistance of Mr. Lynes. has reduced comparative chaos to ordered intelligence in a remarkably short tilne. This is son1ething for whicb every student should be g1·ateful and should strive to perpetuate. A col- lege is known by its library ahnost as much as by the men it makes. And in bringing the level of the former so neal'ly on a plane with that of the latter, the library corps has done a great work. It is for the under-graduate to co-operate. No MORE deeisive victory has beenaccoinplfshed in years than that of the Utica meet. In a J splendid contest with Syracuse, Jiamilton and Colgate, Union carried off a round majority of aU possible points. Every contestant whether suc- cessful in his own event or not, sho11ld be proud, for his college is proud of him. Next to the true- blue spirit that showed itself on the track and in the grand-stand, the success of our athletes is due to the untiring efforts of :1\fr. Cosgr-ove. His guid- ing experience made itself felt in every event. Participants and onlookers are unanimous in his prais~. Another decidedly pleasant feature of the occasion was the hearty acceptanc~ of the result by the vanquished, and the treatment of our men generally. 'l'he outlook for the new league is cer- tainly propitious. IT IS very lamentable that there should be such a decline of interest in oratorical matters, as evi- denced by certain preliminary contests during the last few weeks. The personal benefits of parti- cipating in college oratory are certainly so potent they need not be dwelt upon here. Everyone knows the advantage of being able to say \\Vhat he wants to when standing on his :feet. Eut apart f.rom selfish motives, our oratorical inte.rests should

THE ·c·ONCORDIENSIS. 7 not be reckoned less than tho-se of track and field . .Just. as surely as every athlete should strive to win renown for his alma mater, so should every : student with an iota of ora.torjcal ability go and do like'Wise. When the orator appears it is almost always before. some large gathering, and for the time being he is considered an official representa- tive of the college. So pride, if nothing else, should be an incentive to more enthusiastic effort in this department of th~ college work. Union has won more than one laurel wreath in the past through the efforts of those who speak well, and to sink back now to anything like a lower .standard, should not be t()le:rated. The students themselves are to blame and with them lies the remedy. NO V,ANDALS AT HAll.VARD! STUDENT BODY ACTS Q.UICKL Y IN DISCOVERING EVIL-DOERS. Three.tnen have now left Havard University at the request of the student committee, which investigated the painting of the statute ofJohn Harvard after the base-ball victory over Prince- ton on Saturday night, May 29. The report of the Student Investigating cotnmittee states that they found that the painting, of the statue of John Harvaxd, and other acts of vandalism, were ~done by four men. The principal, a first- year special student, and two of his associates, . mem hers of the class of 1900, have been dis- , C()Vered, but it has been thought best not to publish their names. These resignations from d1e coll'ege, which were detnanded by the com- -rnittee, have been received and accepted, and the men have severed their connection with the WITH the advent of increased facilities for literary effort, much laten.t talent is beginning to stir,. and blossom into lif·e .. a.fter a long, long sleep. We l'lave felt all along that there was a plentitude -of literary energy in the potential which lacked • but the opportunity to become kinetic. Last month we expe1·ienced the unprecedented phe- · nomenon of having more Mss. than we could use. If the student would only realize that a story or poem printed in the Parthenon is as substantial a testimonial to his good wo1'k as is any first grade on. a term's report, this phenomenon would be experienced oftener. .And a better magazine and fewer gray hairs on the editorial head would in_ evitably result. Don't look fo1· a plot among books and old tnagazines, and don't go to your dictionary for big wordf5. Don't try to steal the literary style of Bertha. M. Clay. It's too well- known. In shol't, be yourself and write of things you. know about better iihan someone else. As far as possible all Mss. wiH be returned with sugges- tions and corrections, if such are necessary, and • subsequently published if their merit permits it. Ne:xt year the Parthenon shall probably contain more space and the demand for good copy shall be even greater. Besides, it is the present intention to secure for it a wider distribution among the various prepar~tory schools, 1·endering it all the more iinportant that the magazine be a good· rept·esentation of the students' interest in matters non -athletic. The Phi Beta Kappa Society has donated $100 to the college library. The money is to be invested in books, which as soon as they are ' prop~rly labeled, will he placed on the shelves. Similar gifts·· will · prdbahry: ·be made by ·:the soci~ty in succeeding years. : · University. It was learned that the men also did the . painting, after taking part in the celebration that night on Soldier's Field, went down to Cambridgeport, where they purchased a can of ct·irnson paint. This they used on the side- walks and fences along Cambridge street until they 1·eached Mernorial Hall. I-Iere they painted two ]'arge spots on on.e of the window sills, next they painted the large bell, which was temporarily on the walk outside of Memorial Hall, and then one of them painted the statue. Speaking of the affair, the Cr-imson expresses itself editorially as follows: The cornmittee appointed for the investigation ()f the painting of the John Harvard statue deserves the sincerest congratulations for the success of their proceedings thus far, for al- though there have been some who were opposed to the appoinhnent of the committee, as is al'\\,.ays the case· with new institutions of. this kind, its tnembers have unselfishly undertaken an unpleasant task, and have worked hard. to accomplish it, all because it was thought to oe for the good of the University. The action of the committee is not i~ ~tself alone anything to take the. elightest pleasute. in;

The Concordien_sis VoL. XX. UNION COLLEG-E, JUNE 19, 1897. No .. 3.5. The Rev. AJ,exander McKenzie, D. D., of· Cambridge, Mass., father of Instructor Kenneth ' McKenzie, Ph. D., of Union College, delivered, a. highly instructive and learned lecture on : 'i' Imagination'' in the college chapel, Friday . his best nor accon1plish anything unless he has imagination, a man that is looking into t11e future and seeing it with his mental eye is the man that wins. We sotnethnes call it propl1ecy and desire but whatever we call it, it makes us strong in what we have to do. The lack of it is the ill of all ills. The tnan who has not it has not the spring, the ambition of life. College men used to write and orate on the disasterous results of am hi tion and instanced Napoleon Bonaparte as an illustration., but to-day a man might better be out of the world than attempt to check the a1nbitious imagination of young men. A man who would teach the doctrine of .curbing imagination, or ambition.; fort hey are much the same, ought to be dis- charged at once. The imagination sends us on to better things. afternoon, June r 1. ~r. Rayn1ond introduced the speaker in . a felicitous manner and spoke of his wide reputa· tion as a preacher and scholar; he also tnen· Honed the tnany appointments Dr. Kenzie had and expected to keep during the ten days begin- ning with the previous Monday. He attended ithe meeting of the board of trustees of vV ellseley 'College, ~hen hastened to Andover and was present at a similar assembly, next he delivered his lecture here, on Sunday last he preached the baccalaureate at Cornell University and then returned to his hotne to attend the meeting of · :the board of ove1·seers of Harvard. The lecture began with very clearly and con- . cisely defining the term 'imagination' as a long word for seeing or mental vision. Itnagination is a higher, loftier quality than n1ere optical vision, for a blind man tnay and does possess a nobler n1ore exalted n1ind than an idiot. Mental and optical vision may be compared to a parable and a fable, one is true, the other false. The imagination often leads us to n1istakes yet they are profitable and teach us to be 1nore pains- taking and careful. We may see a cloud in the . distance and imagine it is an iceberg, but ·vvhen we draw near and see that it is only a cloud, we <lo not after that believe that every cloud we see is an iceberg nor do we believe that every ice- berg we see is a cloud. We are careful and more painstaking from our experience. The imagination is directly applicable to life and affects it in many ways. A nature that can- not be touched or n1oved in any other way often yields to the imagination. A man does not do In art, a person must have vision before he can paint, he must produce the vision of the unseen. A tnan n1ust be possessed of genious before he can see the unseen, before he has ideas in his mind to put on the canvass . Amateur art does not fail on account of infet:ior brushes or paints but it fails from lack of in1aginatio~ or rather natural ituagination. An atnateur patnts unnatural ships sailing on super- natural seas. The imagination plays a large part in beautifying our hotnes. . EYery ad~ance. in. science is made along the hnes o~ the tmagtnahon. The scientist imagines a certain theory and moves on to see if he has guessed rightly. The imagination is a science of first in1portance; it is the way discoveries are made. The imagination is of great in1 portance in !heol?gy.. Not a sermon is preached in which Jmagtnatlc:n does not hold a pron1inent place. Mathematics a~·e useless in religion, in fact they tnake havoc wtth ~very truth they touch. The speak~r 1ntr~duced tnany hu1norous anecdotes and 111 ustrattons and closed his lecture \vith sevet:al imaginary poetical pictures which n:ost admtrably portray the important periods in htstory. He also dwelt upon the necessity of thorough ruditnentary education and made an eloquent appeal for patriotistn. ·

THE OONCORDIENSIS. The base ball team concluded the season of I 897 last week by a trip to Burlington, Vt., where two games were played with the Univer- sity of Vermont. I:n the gam,e on Friday, Union lost by the score of I I to I. The batteries were : Union, Thatcher and Delehanty ; Vermont, Dinsmot·e and Agon. The score by innings follows: Union. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . .. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0- 1 Vermont ......•............. 2 0 0 2 0 50 0 2-11 ·On Saturday the teatn was shifted around somewhat in the hope of doing better but with no avail. In the fourth inning Vermont started in to make runs and despite our strenuous endeavors she succeeded in sending twenty-one men around the plate. The batteries were: Union, Parsons and Delehanty; Vermont, Winn and Johnson. The score follows : Union ...................... o o o o o o o 1 1- 2 Vermont ................... 2 0 4 21 0 3 4 0 0-34 While the record this season shows an alarm- ingly large number of games lost, we must remember that the team was composed almost entirely of new men who did the best they could. Next season the experience gained this year will undoubtedly show itself in a much more satis- factory t·ecord. The summary of games played and the scores is as follows : M.arch3r, Union vs. New York University, won by New York; April r, Union vs. Ford- ham, won by Fordham; April 2, Union vs. Manhattan, won by Manhattan; April3, Union v:a.

(1\usieal ~labs <eoQ~ert. It seems fitting that <>ur victorious Musical Association should occupy an evening of com- mencement week and especially that it should occur on alumni day. The :clubs have ·had a sea- son of unqualifi-ed success; this has been acconl- pHshed only by engaging competent leaders for whose services the clubs have had to pay well. The clubs have, heretofore,. had but a slight reputation and have bee.n compelled to give concerts for bare expenses. The consequences are that at present the association finds itself minus. Up to this time an assessment has been made at the beginning of each college year to start the season. The inten- tion of the present managem·ent is if the com~­ mencement concert is well patronized by the undergraduateii, not to levy any assessment next fall. It will be poor encouragement for arranging a series of concerts for the ,coming year if the alumni men now in college do <not lend their support to the association at the concert on Tuesday, June 22. The committee in charge of the cotnmence- ment ball is working hard: to make the affair a success, and all who attend may be assured of a good time. Memorial haU is a delightful place for a dance and it has the advantage of a per- fectly smooth even floor, something that will be appreciated by those who have come in contact with the footlight board at the Van Curler. A large number of the fairer sex will come from other places and with. the usual attendance of the maidens of Dorp will make the dance one long to be ren1embered. The following Sopho- mores will act as aids: Robert M. Eames, E. L. C. Hegeman, Harold J. Hinman, Morton M. Price, Clayton J. Snyder, Paul J. Kruesi, Arthur B. La~rence. Albert E. Casey and F. Roy Champion. The Freshman class was photographed Thurs- day afternoon on the campus by Wheaton.

THE Senior class song, which is printed in an- other column of this paper. comes from the pen of Willian1 Allen Johnston. It is very appropriate, both in air and words, and is much superior to the one sn bmitted by the :first committee. Reprint copies of the song may be obtained from· the comm.ittee or from 1nernbers of THE CONCORDIENSIS' board of editors. THE concluding event of Commencement week will be the Senior Ball. The comn1ittee which has this matter in charge has worked assiduously during the past three months to make this affair the most enjoyable feature of the week. The dance will be held as usual in the N ott Memorial Hall, and everythingpossi~le will be don~ to ma~re this dance a fitting conclusion to the social affairs which have in the past been under the auspices of the Class of '97. Gioscia, with a large number of supporting mu- sicians, will be in attendance. It is needless to say that his music will be most acceptable. The catering is in charge of Owns, of Utica. . A just appreciation of the work of the committee can only be expressed by a large attendance on the part of the students. In fact, there is but .srnall excuse for any student to absent himself on :this occasion. WE understand that Dr. Linhart has accepted a position at Trinity College as a lecturer on physical ·culture. His many friends in college and in the city most sincerely regret that he will not be ·with the1n ne.xt ye&r. His many year's connection with this college has resulted in Inuch benefit to the individual students who have followed' :his in .. structions. Ha1npered as he has been by poor facilities, he bas accomplished rnuch, and would have accon1plished more had our gyntnastic equip- tnent been sufficient. VVe all of us wish. him con- tinued success and regret the loss -of a most cour- teous friend. IT is the earnest desire of the President and other officers of the college that as many as pos- sible of the students should remain in Schenectady until after the conclusion of the Commencement exercises. By far, too many of the students hasten home as soon as they finish theh· examinations. A far greater spirit of loyalty to the college would be manifested if the students should all remain and take part in the exercises of the coming week. Not only is it desirable for them to do so from the .. standpoint of loyalty and of duty to their \alma mater,\ but it is essential that they should become fa1niliar with the usual programrne which is here followed during Commencement week. Juniors, Sophon1ores and Freshmen will in time becorne Seniors, and their duties as such will set more lightly upon their shoulders if they have listened to the crowning efforts of their older collegiates. WITH the publication of this issue of THE OoN- CORDIENSIS the official duties of the '97 board of editors are drawn to a close. THE CoNCORDI- ENSIS, as it now stands, may or it may not be an improvement upon the publication as it was when the present board of editors first assumed control. We, as editors, however, have rnost earnestly striven to raise the standard of the college publi- cations. A comparison of the present CoNCORD! .. ENSIS with that of last year cannot properly be made without including the PaTthenon, ·which was revived as an additional and suppletnentary publication. As all of our readers are doubtless aware, the changes which have been made; namely, that of publishing a weekly news sheet instead of a bi-weekly cornbination news and lit- erary paper, and the establishment and successful publication of a literary monthly, have greatly increased the labors of the present board over that of last year. The object in making the change was two-fold. We desired to place the Union College publica- tions in favorable comparison with those emanating

THE OONCORDIENSIS. 1 from other colleges of the sa,rne size and standing as our own. We also, with the development of the depart,ment of rhetoric, desired to. furnish the student of a literary bent an. opportunity to see such work as he might produce in cold type, thus giving him the ben~fit which a college literary magazine always reflectS' upon those who take ad- vantage of it. gymnasium locke1~s placed in suitable condition for service next fan. It would be advisable to make arrangoments with a trainer immediately so that there need be no delay .in the fall. A little . careful managen1entnow may greatly improve the · prospects for next season. It may not be the duty of the advisory board to do more than advise but in our opinion there should be someone connected with the institution 'vhose duty it was to direct these affairs so that victory would be more certain and defeat less discreditable. The greatest disappointment has been, not in what we have produeed, but in the lack of diversi- fied support which o1.1r efforts, particularly in con- :: nection with the Parthenon, have received. We ! believe, howevet·, that a. gr-eater interest will be manifested tb.e coming year. With this as a fond hope, and wUh the feeling that our efforts have been appreciated by some if not all of our fellow- .students, we turn ov:er the management of this . publication to the in.coning board of editors, wbo · in the past have so .earnestly assisted us and in whose future 1nana.gement we have assurances of a greater success. A WORD concerning the foot ball season of '97 may not be out of place in this number of the Ooncordiensis. We do not wish to be over critical of those who have, either directly or indirectly, interested themselves in our college athletics. Everyone however who has kept tract of the games of the base ball and the foot ball teams, since the new regulations went into effect is well .aware tha.t the suecess of these teams· has in no way been remarkable. The vigorous measures taken by the faculty to purify athletics was indeed necessary but it see1ns as though something was wrong when such action results only in the development of tearus whose existence has, through bad judgement, and poor playing brought only discredit upon thjs institution. Such however has been the case. The students or at least a cer- tain number have earnestly endeavo1·ed to make these teams a credit to the institution but have failed. The athletie spirit seems to have become paralyzed and the judgement of somebody in authority always seems to be at fault. Such has been the condition of things the past two years. It is time that there was a change. If the '97 and '98 athletic teams are not controlled by a strong will; if' the faculty and the alumni or somebody does not interest himself in this branch -of student effort more than simply to criticise, the Union teams in the future will eneounter defeat after defeat as they have in the past and the col· lege will gain only discredit by their existence. Arrangements should be made at once for the early training of next season·'s foot ball team. The suits for practice should be collected, and the Obituary. CHESTER H. UTTER, '98. It is always grievous for us to part forever with those who are dear to us. And it is doubly sad when those taken away are young in years with the pron1ise of a happy life before them. In the death of Chester H. Utter every- one who knew him will feel that he has lost a true friend, a man of rare personal charm and of true nobility. Mr. Utter had been suffering from consump- tion for some time and soon after the winter term commenced was obliged to leave college. He went to Denver but steadily grew worse and came hon1e knowing that the end was only a matter of time. It came on Tuesday at his home at Albany. The funeral was held at two o'clock yesterday afternoon from his hon1e at I4. Chestnut street. Chester Hoysradt Utter was born August I 2, r874, and was therefore not quite twenty-three years of age. His schooling was limited but while employed in the State Library he pre- pared himself for Union, entering with the class ·Of '98. He was a member of the scientific divi- sion and expected to study law. In the Fresh- man year he was a member of his class foot ball team and a year ago won the second prize for Sophomore oratory. The following resolutions were adopted by his sorrowing classmates : WHEREAS, It has seemed good in the Divine Providence to sununon from us our friend and classmate Chester H. Utter, and WHEREAS, He has endeared himself to all of us by his kind, affable and cordial disposition and by those other qualities of mind and heart which are the marks of true nobility, therefore be it · Resolved, By the class of 1898 of Union College that in his death we have lost a true comrade and a sincere friend, and be it further Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions as a. token of our sytnpathy be transmitted to the family of the deceased and that a copy be printed in the Gonoord~lensis.

8 THE <JONCORDIENSIS. VANDALISM AT HARVARD-FINAL INVESTlGA- TION REPORT. The committee appointed to investigate the painting of the John Harvard statue has finished its work by finding out the last one of the four men itnplicated in the affair. He too is a Freslunan. His resignation fron~ the coUege has been accepted, but since he is less blame- worthy than the other three men it will not take effect until June 22, when he will have com- pleted his final exatninations. BARTLETT HARDING HAY:EES, J. E. NoRTON SHAW, CHARLES GRILK. The Crimson convents editorially as follows : The final report of the student investigation committee, puts an end to an episode which has been intensely disagreeable, to say the least. To the tnembers of the co1ntnittee the thanks of the whole university are due for their satisfactory perfonnance of a most distasteful duty. Their success has been a service to Harvard which can hardly be over-estimated. It has accom- plished two things. It has shown to the outside world that college sentiment is done, once for all, with mere dissatisfied toleration of such stupid behaviour, even on the part of the most unsophisticated members of the university ; and . that, in the future, it will handle like offenders · without gloves. The affair is also calculated to furnish a signi- ficant object lesson to new students. Incoming classes will do well to re,m.etnber, that in obtain- ing for themselves the privileges of a course in Harvard University, they voluntarily becon1e metnbers of a society whose good name must necessarily be affected by their individual acts, and that every principle of good breeding, or rather of comn1on decency demands that they jealously guard the reputation of the institution to which they owe so much. The work of the comtnittee, therefore, will not have been in vain, if it has served to etnphasize to schoolboys entering college, and to the general public that Harvard men consider that their first duty is to Harvard.

The men who obey this law are the strong men, the men of great achievements, who do not becotne weary in well doing, know- ing that in due season they shall reap if they faint not. D·r. Raymond then addressed a few words of, advice to the graduates and the services were concluded. Mr. Crichton was the :first to speak. His grace- fully delivered oration was entitled, ''A Question of the Day.'' Every nation has at some time in her existence, he said, been compelled to face some great problem. The problem which is to-day dis,. turbing Europe, a11d disturbing the peace of every European state is the Turkish question. And the solution to this problem, said Mr. Crichton, is the disintegration of the Turkish empire. He was roundly applauded. The next speaker was Mr. Putnam, who had chosen as his subject, ''Gladstone.'' Mr. Put- nam's peculiarly forcible delivery was weU adapted to his theme. He dwelt upon the life and Of all the cotnmencement exercises none were as picturesque as those held in Capt. Jack's garden. The natural beauty of the spot, the ahnost sacred associations attached to Dr. Nott's eln~, the black robed Seniors placidly smoking the calumet of ' peace, and the pretty maids clad in all the colors of the rainbow, conspire to make the .scene one that will 1i ve long in the memory. i characteristics of the great statesman who has played such a protninent role in interna~ional politics, and especially upon those qualities of mind and heart that have been evidenced in all his work. The oration was a :fine bit of character study and was warmly received by the audience~ At 3 o'clock Monday afternoon the class of '97 led by Grand Marshal Multer entered the garden and seated thetnselves around the old elm. After pipes were ligl1ted President Frey presented Elory G. Bowers who detivered the ivy oration, telling in an interesting way the true meaning of the exer- cises. The ivy poem was then read by Abel Mer- chant and Frank T. Cady gave the pipe oration. After singing the class and college songs the ivy was planted with due ceremony and the exercises were over. The music was by the incomparable Gioscia without whom no college exercise is com- plete. juQior priz~ Oratory aiJd fll~xaiJder prize 8p~a~iiJ9· The Juni6r prize oratory and the Alexander ex- temporaneous speaking contests took place this year, as usual, on Monday night. The Sophotnore oratorical contest, which is generally held in con- nection with these events was this year on-,.itted. Three Juniors presented themselves as contestants in the first event. They were Messrs. Thomas A. Crichton of Wellsboro, Pa., John G. Putnam of Schenectady and Perley Poore Sheehan of Hamil- ton, Ohio. The third and last speaker was Mr. Sheehan, who delivered an oration on the subject, \A Florentine Monk.\ Mr. Sheehan was in full sympathy with his subject, and the oration was well written and well delivered. Savonarola is reverenced to-day for the part he played four hun- dred years ago in the I tali an renaissance. ' When the appointed judges in this event, re- turned their decision, it was found that the :first prize had been won by Thomas A. Crichton of Wellsboro, Pa., and the second prize by John G. Putnam of Schenectady. The decision was greeted with applause. THE ALEXANDER EXTEMPORANEOUS CONTEST. The Alexander extemporaneous contest was then opened by the announcement of the special subject: ''Is the Recognition by our Governtnent of Eellig- erent Rights properly a Legislative Function?'' The speakers were at liberty to speak for six minutes on either side of the question. The con- testants· were as follows: Francis E. Cullen, '98, of Oswego, affirmative; Peter Nelson, '98, Mar- quette, Mich., negative; Malcolm G. Thomas, '98, Pine Plains, negative; Lester L. Hubbard, 1900, Cohoes, affirmative; Han1,ilton K. Wright, '99, Pulaski affirmative; William D. Reed, '98, Albany, affirmative; Perley P. Sheehan, '98, Hamilton, 0., negative; and Walter M. Swann, '98, Albany, negative. 'fhe speakers handled their subjects with ease and fluency and showed a perfect familiarity with the subject and considerable oratorical ability. After a selection by the orchestra, the judges who were the Rev. F'. A. LaRoche, '77, E. D. Ronan, '67 and Clarence E. Akin, awarded the prize of $50 to Francis E. Cullen, '98, with honorable men- 111 tion of Harrison K. vV right, '99.

The class of '87 celebrated its decennial anniversary Monday evening by a banquet at the Edison hotel. It was of an informal nature, the president, Charles B. McMurray of Lansing- burgh, acting as toastmaster. Among those present were : Dr. Henry A. Kurth, John C. Van Voast and Prof. Albert H. Pepper of this city; Charles F. Bridge, Edward M. Cameron and George L. Flanders of Albany; the Rev. Alden L. Bennett ofWaltham, Mass., the Rev. George W. Furbeck of Stuyvesant and Dow Vroon1an of Tonawanda. The annual meeting of the New York Alpha of , the Phi Beta Kappa society took place 'Tuesday morning with a large attendance. An additional appropriation of $75 was made for the college 1i brary and .officers,, were elected: president, Dean • B. H. Ripton; vice-president, Dr. William L. Pear- son; recording secretary, Instructor Kenneth Mc- Kenzie; corresponding secretary, Instructor John I. Bennett, Jr.; treasurer, Robert J. Landon. Gl]e 8iQma Xi rneetiQ~. The Sigma Xi society held its annual meeting Tuesday morning. Lynn M. Schofield, Dann L. Wood and Monte J. Multer of the class of '97 were elected to membership. It was decided to appro- priate $50 to purchase books for the college library. Instructor Howard Opdyke was elected recording secretary in place of Professor Patterson, resigned, and Prof. Charles S. Prosser was elected treas_ urer in place of Prof. Stoller, resigned. The General Alumni association held its annual meeting in the chapel'. Tuesday morning. The committee in charge of raising subscriptions for repairing Dr. Foster's house was appointed as fol- lows: Robert Earl, H. B. Silliman and Joseph B. Graham. The following were appointed a com- mittee to raise $2,000 to buy the library of Tayler Lewis and. present it to the college: Robert Earl, 7 Dr. H. V. Mynderse, A. J. Thomson, G, K. Har- roun, Wnt. J. Hillis. The newly elected officers are: president, Surgeon General Rufui Tryon, '58, U. S. N.; vice-president, Frank Baily; secretary, Dr. Wm. T. Clute; treasurer, Allen H. Jackson; executive committee, Alex. Thomson, James Heat- ley, B. C, Sloan, J. B. Y. Warner, Frank Cooper; member of the Athletic board for three years, Wtn. C. Roberson of New York. Mr. Edgar S. Barney, '84, principal of the He- brew Technical institute of New York, was unani- mously elected alumni trustee for the ensuing term. At 1:15 Tuesday afternoon occurred the principal event of the day, when the alumni banquet. was held in Metnorial hall. Seated at the honor table were Dr. Wells, President A. V. V. Raymond, Surgeon General J. Rufus Tryon, '58, of the United States army and president of the General Alumni association, Silas B. Brownell, '53, of the board of trustees, and Honorary Chancellor St. Clair McKel way. Around the other tables were grouped the faculty, trustees, the classes from '37 to '97, and the Sophomore quartet which sang col- lege songs. An elaborate banquet was served by Caterer Owens of Utica. The assemblage was then called t0 order by General Tryon and the Rev. Dr. Rankin offered prayer. Then General Tryon gave an interesting address, thanking the alumni for his election as president of the association. He said that as the babies in Pinafore were mixed up, so he intended to stir up the alumni. Necessity stirs the college authorities and their wants should stir the alumni. We must summon to our assistance wit, words, worth, wealth, and love for Old Union. Wealthy alumni should be reminded of their debt to the institution which fostered them in their youth and they should hasten to repay their obligation. There has been great progress in educational work dur- ing the last few years and public sentiment demands new courses and new modes of instruc- tion. Let Union be a pioneer. The alumni should unite upon a fixed method to serve the college. More attention ought to be paid to original research and the instructors should be given the time and the money to conduct it. The good people of Schenectady ought also to be stirred up. During over a century their obligation has been accumulating for the wealth, prosperity and education gained by Union's residence here. We have the right to claim substantial recognition. At Union College were fostered Seward, Arthur,

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. Bigelow, Rice, Lamont, Benjamin Lo01nis, James C. Duane, Foster, Lewis, Potter, Pearson and Raymond. Here have we learned lessons from the past; here let us learn lessons for the future. Tennis S. Hamlin, '67, said that his class had entered college becau.se Queen Victoria had promised that their thirtieth anniversary should come on the day of her diamond jubilee. He deplored the existing ill-feeling between England and America and hoped that the way might be paved for a better state of feeling. The Rev. Andrew D. Archibald, '72, told some interesting stories and made a plea for concord. A letter of regret was read from ex-Secretary Daniel S. Lamont, '72. F. Packard Palmer, '97, said that his class was young but intended to do as great things as its predecessors. Prof. Franklin H. Giddings, '77, referred to his class as jewels by nature. He heartily welcomed the younger alumni and hoped that all might co-operate in having a larger number of students and a longer list of instructors. There is no place where a man can be more sure of a progressive education than at Union College. Stephen K. Williams, '37, whose weight of years sits so lightly on his brow that he is an enthus- iastic rooter at Union's athletic sports, made a speech telling of the changes that had taken place in sixty years. He referred to the increased expense of college life and thought that while the younger alumni might be better educated, they could hardly be better men. St. Clair McKelway was then called upon and he well vindicated his reputation as a post-prandial orator. His remarks bristled with humorous anecdotes and sparkling flashes of wit and he was enthusiastically applauded. The new banner of the New York State Inter- Collegiate Athletic union, won by Union at Utica June 5, hung in a conspicuous place and the alumni seemed heartily gratified by this proof that the present students are not behind in their love for Old Union. Tl]e Board of 5rustees. The board of trustees held two sessions Tuesday, lasting nearly all day. The financial condition of the college was the main question discussed, but nothing in regard to the conclusions arrived at was made public. A. A. Tyler, who has the degree of A. M., from Lafayette, and Ph. D., from Columbia was selected to take the place of Prof. James H. Stoller as professor of biology during the latter's absence in Europe, and John W. H. Pollard, Dartmouth, '95, who since his graduation has been instructor at the preparatory school of the Univer- sity of Chicago, was elected physical director to succeed Dr. Charles P. Linhart. Prof. Thomas W. Wright, professor of applied mechanics and physics, was asked to assume charge of ,the depart- ment of mathematics during the coming year. He will be furnished an assistant in his department. ~tass Day Exereises. The Class 1 Day exercises of the graduating class were held at half past three Tuesday afternoon in the First Presbyterian church. President Frey of the class welcomed the audience to the exercises and introduced Arba M. Blodgett of Ingleside, N. Y., the class orator, who gave a fluent oration based on the accomplishments, aims and ambitions of the graduating class. After a seleetion by the orchestra Howard R. Fur beck of West Copake, the class poet, read the class poem and Orlando B. Pershing of North Madison, 0., the class historian, told of the evolu- tion of the class of '97, numbering ninety Fresh- men, to the graduating forty-three men. The history abounded in humorous references and several members of the class suffered at the historian's hands. Albert C. Wyckoff of Leonia, N.

10 THE CONCORDIENSIS. Tt}e Fraterqity fieuQiOQ5. 'Tuesday evening of cotnmencetnent week is known as ''fraternity night,\ and is usually oc- cupied with informal reunions or banquets at : the various fraterni;ty houses. It affords a pleas- ant opportunity for the alumni and the active members to tneet and around the festal board re- hearse the past and present glories of their . soci!eties. The Phi Delta Theta ftaternity held a banquet at its new chapter house at 404 Union street, and the Phi Gatntna Deltas did the s~u11e at their house on the hill. The Alpha Delta Phi, Sigma Phi, Chi Psi, Delta Upsilon, Delta Phi, Psi Upsilon, Beta Theta Pi and Kappa AI pha fraternities held informal reunions at their various chapter houses. 5t}e <i radua tiQ~ Ex~r<:ises. The commenoemen t exercises proper took place in the First Presbyterian church on Wednesday morning. At 10 o'clock a procession, headed by President Raymond and the honorary chancellor,. St. Clair McKel way, and consisting of the board of trustees, the faculty, the Senior class and under- graduates marched from the college to the church where a large asl3emblage had gathered. The platform was filled with the faculty and trustees. Giosca 's orchestra played several selections and the assemblage joined in singing the 117th Psalm. Th:e honor orations were then delivered as follows: ''The Spirit of Our Age,'' Howard R. Furbeck of West Copake; \ The Nineteenth Century in Europe,\ Ira Hotaling of Albany; \Principles Fought for in the American Revolution,'' William A. J ohn~Ston of Palatine Bridge; ''The Moral Grandeur of Nations,\ Abel Merchant, jr., of Nassau; \Modern Culture,\ Arthur H. Winn of Albany; \ The Development of the Spirit of Free Inquiry,\ Dann L. Wood of Mansfield, Pa.; Valedictory, \The Evolution of Genius,\ Edgar R. Cumings of North Madison, Ohio. Theses in engineering, which were not read, were as follows: ''An Investigation of the Sub-surface Waters of the City of Schenectady,'' Pitson J. Cleaver of Unadilla; \Design of Foundation and Super- structure of a Two-Spain Railroad Bridge,\ Lynn M. Schofield of Norfolk, Nebraska; ''Locomotive Draft and Blast,'' Stephen Elmer Slocum of Schenectady. After a selection by the orchestra thehchancellor's address was given by the Hon. St. Clair McKel- way, editor of the Brooklyn Eagle, Regent of the University of the State of New York, and honorary chancellor of the university. As Mr. Mcl{elway arose he was given a most cordial greeting, the applause continuing for several minutes. 'The subject of the chancellor's oration was '' Colleges and Men.\ He began his oration by returning thanks for the honor conferred upon him. \ The orator is a past product and a receding figure,\ said the chancellor. \The apostles of course are becotning fewer 5ince the masses have taken charge of their own opinions.\ The speaker was of the opinion that the old class of students tnight be called the unhelped while the new way he called the helped, as the former had to do everything for themselves to secure their education, while the later had about everything done for them. '' Effort to 1nake ordinary questions do duty for extraordinary ones has been tnore earnest than successful. Try as we will, the service question in government has not been lifted above the clerical question in business or the kitchen or farm or stable question in home life. Labor as we may, the issue of international arbitration has not been held in academic solution. * * * We have arbitrated differences as they arose. The suspicion was inveterate that what farther differences may arise can as well he arbitrated by exten1porized tribunals as by a hard and fast cotntnitlnent to tnechanical methods. * * * '' Strong hopes were entertained that the ques- tion of a municipal party for municipal purposes could carry in it the ethical arousal which would purify politics and ally education with a public interest. The hopes have not yet been realized. * * * The endeavor to shift city thinking on public questions fro1n political lines could hardly be more successful than one to shift any think- ing on religious questions frotn denominational lines. Men are partisan in proportion to nutn- bers or nearness. Men are likewise partisan or politics is competitive in proportion to the value of the prizes in contest. * * * '' Traversing the circle back to the primary proposition, that the initiative of learning and of intellectual stitnulus is with the people to-day,

TBE CONOORDIENSIS. 11 we can well inquire : How do the products in manhood and in \'Totnanhood under the new n1ethod compare with those unde1· the old ? What is the gain or loss in individual. cases of the substitution of the competition of students with one another for the conquest by the young of the hindrances that aforetime st()od in their way? * * * ''John Wesley defined and denounced An1eri- can slavery as the sum of all villainies. Yet it had its cotnpensations. Its pastoral and patriarchal influence on society gave us tb.e Vir- ginia leisure class from atnong whorn Washing- ton, Jefferson, Madison and Motn<oe were ' picked. That influence bore. thetn and trained thetn. They were valuable tnen in a planter-led rebellion against royal assutnption and arrogant · paternalism. Yet in another part of the :colonies detestation of slavery was part of the faith and part of the force of John Adams, of :Sa n1. Adams, of John Hancock, of Joseph Wanen and of J an1es Otis, as well as of Benjatnin Ft~anklin and Dr. Witherspoon and Thotnas :Pa:]ne. They were revolutionary factors. He would be reck- less who contended that one of these groups was less necessary or more efficient than. the other in the vindication of the revolution, or that the lettered class to whom both groups under diver- sity of educational influences belonged was to be ranked above the Israel Putnatns~ Anthony Waynes, Daniel Morgans, Francis Marions, Ethan Aliens, John Starks, Nathaniel Greenes and Nathan Hales who went up frotn between the plow handles to an imtnorta1ity of fame through fire. Between the children ot culture and the sons of thunder who re-builded the union on foundations of liberty, the parallel could be as luminously run. Su111ner and Seward were the flowering results of consum- mate training in the school of study. Lincoln and Grant were prodigious pupils in the school of life. * * * ''The average moral sense of aU now exceeds the ethical vision even of the pt-ophets of the past. For that, of course, the prophets are to be thanked, but on that the people aTe to be con- gratulated. So, if we find a destitution of per- sonal leadership, the cornpensation is seen in the general moral uplift of the people. If we find that penury has decreased among the people of the educable classes, and with it, its incitements . to heroic ambition, we can also find that the . percentage of learning has appreciated, its area infinitely multiplied, its facilities made univers.al and its beneficiaries enutnerated in tens of mil- lions, where they were enumerated in tens or at most in hundreds of thousands. A great people are preferable to a lot of great tnen. Those· who live on high table lands need not co~et the plains.rnen their occasional mountains. Right here I recognize that some 1nay doubt the statetnent that schooling is free from obstacles. They should not, however, charge the needs and hardships of bread winning at hon1e on a system of education which is free. Education is free, whether those for whom it is free are free to avail th.emselves of it or not. Their cas.e should not be confounded with the situation from which that case may bar them. A n1an may poignantly thh·st on the bank of a river if he has the lockjaw and cannot drink water. A paralytic, unhelped, would starve in a bakery. Schooling is free to all. All are not free to schooling. Others are able to enjoy it only a little. But the enforcement of personal circum- stances should be distinguished from the whole- sale liberality of state provision of education. Happily the proportion of the prevented every • year grows sn1aller. A splendid state paternalism compels the putting ot tl1e child out to learrtittg, if only for a while. It obliges him to serve a tneasure of apprenticeship to knowledge. The parent is punished if to his offspring this right is denied. * * * \Too tnany of the rich are trying to get the governn1ent to make them richer. Those whose lot in life is humble, and whose conditions in life are hard naturally also come on the govern- ment for relief and recuperation. The poor can- not see why their debts should not be cut in half by the degradation of the currency if by govern- t.11ent action and legislative bounty the resources of trusts and con1binations can be trebled. The wild recourse to paper currency, to free silver coinage, to government bounty on exports, and the proposition that farm lands and farm pro-

A large ceiebra- tion was afterward held on the campus. Wellesley has abolished compulsory chapel attendan~ce. The result is, no falling off in attendance, and more spirit in the exercise. The Central Debating League has been e~tab­ lished in the west, co1np1·ising the Universities of Michigan, Chicago, Wisconsin and North- western. V\Talter Camp, of Yale and Tracy Harris, of Princeton, have been asked by their universities to decide upon the place for next year's Yale- Princeton game. Darttnouth, by winning last Saturday for the sixth time the New England inter-collegiate championship, has an undisputed claim to the beautiful cup offered by the assocition. Edward Carter Perkins of Hartford has been elected captain of the Yale track team for next year. He is the best hurdler among the colleges and has come close to the world's record. It is announced that a new fraternity, kn.own as Theta Chi has been established at Cornell, the metnbership in which, is confined to students in the College of Agriculture and the State Veterinary College. The committee which is raising funds for the memorial to the late Thomas Hughes, the author of \ Tom Brown at Rugby,\ has issued a circular letter to all Atnericans who wish to contribute towards the memorial. President Eiiot's name appears in the committee. The question of\ cribbing\ i~ receiving the attention of the Y.,. ale students and faculty. A long letter appears in the Tale Alun2n£ Weekly of recent date, explaining the conditions as they are at present and offering suggestions for remedying the evil. points. 'The meet was notable for the fact that new records were established in three of the field events., and that Wefers was beaten in the 220- yard run. Windsor of Pennsylvania added two inches to his record jt.unp of 6 feet I inch made last year ; Johnston of Yale surpassed by seven- eights of an il1.ch the pole vault record of I 1 feet 2% inches.,, held jointly by Hoyt of Harvard and Buchois o:f Pennsylvania; and Woodruff of Pennsylvania threw the hatntner 7~ inches farther than the best in the intercollegiate throw, 1nade by Hickok in I 895. The titnes in the track events \\V·ere all affected by the stiff wind which blew dh-ecHy up the hotne stretch and added fractions of a second to tin1es in the high hurdles, 440-yard and 220-yard runs, which might otherwise have endangered intercollegiate records for t.n e distance. A feature of the games was the strong show- ing made by Princeton, which. college, for the first tilne in :years, was a prominent factor in the intercollegiate and came within a fraction of a point of tieing Harvard for third place. The victory of Pennsylvania was due to the presence of star atheletes on her team, rather than to any pronounced superiority in the all- around development of the tearn itself. Yale lost expected points in the\ shot and hamn1er events, particularly, and in the 1nile walk, in which all four of her representatives were dis- qualified in suc.cession by the judges of walking, Mr. Din1se. Mr. C. H. Sherrill, Yale '89, pro- tested the event on the grounds that the judge had not warned the Yale men sufficiently. The matter was referred to the Executive Cotnmittee of the Association for future consideration.

WITH this issue of THE CoNCORDIENSIS the board of editors for '98 appears with due humility before a generous public. The board fully appre- ciates the responsibilities of its position, and will ' strive to its utmost, to maintain a standard com- mensurate with the desires and expectations of the supporters of Old Union. The board makes no other promise, and asks only the kindly consider- ation accorded the efforts of the board of '97. AND we feel that no small amount of praise is due the retiring board for the work of reorgani- zation which it has so successfully accomplished. To Mr. Palmer, editor-in-chief, to Mr. Todd, liter- ary editor and to Mr. Draper, business tnanager, is owing the heartiest approbation of all who have at heart the welfare of the college. Through their untiring zeal, Union now has a- monthly literary magazine and a weekly newspaper of which any college of this size might well be proud. WE wouLD for the last time call the attention of delinquent subscribers, particularly among the , alumni, to the fact that this year of THE CoNCQR- DIENSIS is completed at1d that all subscriptions are long overdue. The retiring management has not yet been able to settle up its debts and the incom- ing board will be greatly hampered unless this can be done .directly. We feel that we have been extre1nely patient in the matter, and that the delinquents should show their appreciation by a prompt response. THE hundred and second commencement of Union college exists now only as a memory. But it has marked the close .of a year which was pre-eminently one ,of substantial progress and material gain. Not t11at new buildings have been erected nor chairs endowed-these are matters apart from our consideration-but within the blue gate, on the campus, in the college meetings-in fact, in all things having to do with the undergraduate body, there has been given an impetus to a progress that cannot be otherwise than lasting. This has been due, more than to any thing else, to the 1i beral financial and spiritual support of the students themselves. It found fruition in the track team, the musical organizations and the college press especially this year, and there is every reason to believe that next year it will make itself equally apparent on gridiron and diamond. THERE is one topic which was not touched upon at the recent alumni dinner, but which should have received the earnest consideration of everyone present, and that is \substantial loyalty.\ This we learn, was to have been the topic of several of the speakers had not lack of thne withheld the opportunity. The patent truth that Union cannot live by words alone, or as one prominent alumnus expressed it-on the anti-fat of after-dinner speeches-is not always present in the minds of her loyal sons. Loyalty in the abstract is all right. No college could exist without it. But loyalty in the abstract should merely be the vapor, so to speak, which may be condensed to sound and permanent substantiality. Had the earth always existed as a nebulous mass, there would have been no cmn1nence1nent last week. But since natural laws forbade a continuance of such a state, it is for us to learn and to pro:fi t by such an example. A cloud at sunset is a beautiful thing after a fashion, but when one is thirsty, one wants water, clear and condensed and close at hand.

THE CONOORDIENSIS. AT THE last tneeting of the '97 board of editors several important appointments were made. Walter M. Swann was appointed to the position of Literary Editor of the PARTHENON and the nomination of Charles V romnan for Business Manager was confirn'led. With these appointments the '98 board of editors is cotnplete and is as follows: Editor-in- Chief, Perley Poore Sheehan; Business Manager, Charles Vrooman; Literary Editor (CoNCOR- DIENSIS) Carl Hammer; Literary Editor (P ARTHE- NON) Walter .M. Swann. According to the constitution governing the man- agenlent of the college publications the Editor-in- Chief and Literary Editors for any one year must qualify for such positions by ·work submitted dur- ing their first three years in college. On the basis of such work those best qualified atnong the Fresh- men are appoh'lted to positions on the Reportorial Staff. From the Reportorial Staff is chosen the Associate Editors and .from the Associate Editors the Editorial Board for any particular year. Since the establishment of The Partlzenon it has become necessary to make some changes in the method of appointment. Work on either CoN- CORDIEN SIS or Parthenon is necessary in order to obtain an appointment on the Reportorial Staff. Work on both papers is necessary in order to obtain an appointment on the Board of Associate Editors, unless it is definitely understood thatonly a literary editorship is being so-ught. The following men have been appointed Associ- ate Editors: Leroy 'l'. Bradford, F. Roy Champion and George C. Rowell. The above appoint~ents are virtually the same as those tnade last year. It has been thought advisable however, not to tnak.e the above appoint- ments final but to leave the competition open to the class. Appointments to the Reportorial Board are as follows: Fred. R. Davis, Douglas W. Paige, Philip L. Thomson and Louis Tinning. FoR MANY years the library question has oc- cupied the minds of those who have had the in- terests of this college most closely at heart. All who interested themselves in this departmentof the college have been a ware of its needs. Faculty, alumni and students have exei\ted a varying degree of energy in supplying its needs and in rectifying, such errors as became manifest in its management, and such abuses as have heretofore existed in its use by a careless student body. When we con- sider the changes for the better which have been made during the past four years, we can more readily appreciate the efforts of the few who have been most instrumental in its accomplishment. Immediately after Dr. iR'aytnond assumed control of the affairs of the college, he placed the library buiLding in a much better condition than it had ever been before. E1ectr1:c lights were supplied and an adequate systetn of steam heating pipes was run on both sides of th.e main hall throughout its entire length. At the same time the number of open hours was increased so that the efficiency of the library as such was greatly increased. This was a great improvement and paved the way for such changes, as have followed. The oid system admitted .of many abuses which had to be rectified. It has been the policy of this paper throughout the past year to denounce such abuses as accompanied a careless and dishonest use of the library privileges, and t(])· urge a complete change in the library system. 'l'he faculty recognized the necessity of a change i:n this direction and the 1i br ary cotnmi ttee appointed by them after careful consideration devised a system which promises all that is desired. The conditions are now most suitable for progress along the lines of better equipment. Already a start has been made. The donation by the Phi Beta Kappa society p~aces in the 1i br ary forty volutnes in literature, bistory and philosophy. The instructors club [;}.as added twelve more volumes of currant fiction. Other donations should follow and, it is reasonable to expect, will follow if the interest already maRifested is not allowed to die out. As has been suggested by some of the alumni, class donations to the library would be a means of supplying tnany valuable and much needed volumes. We should not dismiss this subject without men- tioning the reading rocnn and its equipment. All the important magazines, newspapers and reviews may be found here. .At present the library is not suffering any great waRt for this class of litera- ture. The only de:ficieacy, if any, is along the lines of technical publication_s, .A yearly fund, however, should be devoted to this department for the pur- pose of binding the :files of magazines and papers. This could be done mttch more readilyfrom year to year than after a lapse of a number of years, as in the interitn many magazines and papers may be lost. In conclusion we wish to say that no department of the college has received more substantial im- provement than has the library. Much has been done in the past and tnuch more should be done in the future. Dr. Truax has received a number of volumes of the Union Centen-nial issue, and its long de- lay in publication has been n1.ore than compen- sated for by its completeness and handsome appearance. The work has been under com- pilation for some time by Dr. George Alexander of New York, and reflects great credit both upon him and those associated with him in the work. The dedication is from the pen of Dr. Truax.

. I i I I I I I l I I 1S THE CONCORbiENSlS. Throughout the college world there is proba- bly no question which receives more attention from the general public, and which has been the subject of more universal discussion than that of college athletics.. In nearly every institution in the country the relative merits and demerits of this form of student effort have occupied th.e at- tention of faculty, alumni and students. All dis- , cussion along this line has been for the purpose of finding out the true relative hnportance of athletics to the regular work of the college. Public sentiment seems to be strongly in favor of . the present condition wherein athletics occupy a large proportion of the time and thought of the student. The opip.ion of experts is certainly much more in favor of the present state of things than of that which existed thirty or forty years ago when rioting and dissipation were far more ' prevalent than now. Nearly everyone recognizes tl1e importance and value of collegiate athletics, provided they are well controlled and properly · administered. Under these conditions the voice of protest is silenced and loud is the praise in favor of college athletics and the college athlete. But it is right here that the question comes home to us. Have Union college athletics been a benefit or a detriment to this institution ? If not, why not ? To those who are acquainted with the condi- tions as they existed in the past and as they exist at present these questions are easily answered. In the past our athletics have not been well con- trolled. This condition, however, has been char;ged. Now, under the vigorous application of the new regulations the student is compelled to recognize the true position of athletics and n1ust apply hhnself accordingly A It is true that this change was not brought about without fric- tion between students and faculty, but that feel- ing has long since given place to another which recognizes the action of the faculty as one not only for the best interests of the student but also of our college athletics as well. The second condition is one wherein we tnust acknowledge failure. That our athletics have not been well adtninistered is known to all. And now that we know wherein lay the fault the remedy can be applied. Already a step has been taken along this line. The development of our teams and general oversight of our athletics is to be placed in the hands of Mr. George Pol- lard, who comes to us highly recommended by the authorities at Yale. Mr. Pollard is a grad .. uate of Dartn1outh and is thoroughly familiar with all forms of college athletics. The most hnpodant step, however, which has been taken, is that towards the procuring and equipping of a new athletic field. A large num- ber of the ahunni have interested themselves in the proJect and already a little OV€r six hundred dollars has been subscribed. 1~-· --.-1~---J~--· ...._I GR:A.ND STAND. DIAMOND. FOOT' BALL FIELD, TR.ACK· DIAMOND, FENCE LINE, PLAN OF NEW ATHLETIC FIELD. It will take two thousand dollars to place the new field in good condition. The money thus expended, however, would be well invested and would then enable the athletic interests of the college to become self-supporting. This is the plan which has been laid before the college authorities and the college alurnni. It is one which cannot fail to impress all as being the only.solution ofour athletic problem. Too often has the refusal to subscribe to this fund been backed up by the excuse that the results obtained by our athletic teams have not been worthy of such reward. Such an argument is shnply a begging of the question. It is reason- ing fro1n the standpoint ot results gained in the past and ignoring the cause of those results. Give the college the means whereby good results may be obtained and these results will certainly follow.

[Edward Wetmore at Harvard Dinner.] The college has expanded into a great uni- versity. It was her manifest destiny that she should. But it is not upon a past reputation, however .great, that her supremacy depends. It depends upon preserving unchanged through all changes, keeping pace with all her growth, that traditional spirit that puts deeds before words, that seeks realities and not shams, that no defeat can discourage and no success in- toxicate, that maintains an ideal of courtesy and scholarship, of simplicity and honor, of truth- fulness and patriotism, that is ready, if the call cotnes, to follow the right, even to martyrdon1, but is in ideal only to be felt and striven for, not to be paraded and talked about. (Cheers.) It is needed, too, that a great university keep in touch with the spirit of the nation. The thne is past for cloister education. More and more in view of the requirements of the society in which we live is the value of a university train- ing measured by what it does in the making of the citizen. Harvard was brought forth and nourished by the party of freedom. She is no home for the breeding of any creed that despairs of the republic ; that finds in our country no place for a gentleman, and sees in our politics only a field of activity for knaves; that stifles the generous enthusiasm that ever hopes and strives for the best, and, for the faith that never falters, would substitute that paresis of mind and heart alike, whose victim considers , our society in decadence and our Government a failure. (Cheers.) Harvard can only keep the proud place she has won by drawing her support from the whole country, and she can only receive that support because the country believes that her teaching and her influence · develop true American tnanhood. Let that belief be lost and all the tnillions in our treasury, all our departments equipped for instruction in every branch of learning cannot save our leader .. ship. [Continued on page 21.]
