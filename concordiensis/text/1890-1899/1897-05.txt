Thornton New York alumni and their friends in the visit of that city, who is a trustee of the coUege. The concert in the evening was a decided sue- of the clubs to that city· cess, both for the clubs .and for the athletic asso- ciation of the Newburgh Academy, under whose auspices the concert was given. A very pleas- ing article appeared the next day in the New- burg11 paper, lauding the concert in every par- ticular. An added feature to the usual program was a banjo solo by C. Stewart, accompanied by his brother, J. Stewart, which 1·eceived hearty applause. After the concert, a pleasant reception was tendered the clubs by Mr. Anthony at his home. 'Ihe next morning an early start was made for New York wbere the clubs were domiciled at the Murray Hill Hotel. The concert was given at Mendelssohn Hall, one of the finest halls in the country for such purposes, its acoustic properties being unequalled. A large and enthusiastic audience greete~ the first ap- pearance in New York of the Uuion College Musical Association. Encores were demanded for every number. The Mall and Express published in part the following article, which is very good endorse- ment ft·om the Metropolitan press: '' The results of good training and hard work were shown by each .of the three clubs, and it would be difficult to say which carried off the honors.\ '' The quartette, consisting of Messrs. Greene, Hinman, Mac Mahon and Eames, rendered 1:'he result of the recent cross country run- ning culminated in an interesting four--mile inter- class race Thursday afternoon. Much interest was manifested by the student body, and class spirit ran high when the contestants were finishing. At several places where the roads intersected the course groups were gathered which cheered as they passed. The only classes to enter more than ten men were the Junior and Freshmen classes, and th~y were easy winners. The score of points made by classes was as follows: Freshmen, I 93 ; Juniors, r 27 ; Seniors, IOI ; and Sopho- mores, 97. The first men to finish were Multer, '97, first, time 22 min. 21 %'. sec. ; Hart- nagel, '98, second, time 22 min. 39 sec. ; Raitt, 1900, third ; W allbridge, I 900, fourth ; Broughton, 1900, fifth; and Miller, 1900, sixth. This race has brought out some material in the under classes which should be developed, and the wholesome interest manifested then, should be continued so that Old Union may win the · inter-collegiate rneet at Utica, June fifth. The new material can with proper training be readily developed in time for the meet and the result of this race should be to quicken all track athletics.

'' .. THE CONCORDIENSIS. fl £eeture By j1amiltoQ W. {t\abie. A lecture of absorbing interest was given in the chapel last Friday afternoon by Mr. Hamil- ton W. Mabie of New York, the literary editor of the Christ·Z:an Union. Although many of the students were away on the musical and base ball trips, the chapel was filled to overflowing. A large nutnber of the clergytnen attending the Troy Methodist conference in this city were present by special invitation. Mr. Mabie chose as his subject ''Literature,\ and for over an hour held the close attention of his hearers while 11e treated his subject in a • masterly manner. It is impossible in our lhnited space to do more than call attention to some of , the more striking points of the discourse. :I\tir. Mabie said, that the most valuable thing in all college life is the four years of close asso- ciation with books and the opportunity and necessity of their almost hourly use. The only kind of books worth discussing are great books and the sum of these makes litera- ture. But what are the qualities of a great book? Beauty is an essential characteristic, but the most important all-pervading quality of true literature is its vitality. By vitality is n1.eant the rapid, energetic movement which you will find so prominently in all great books. Life is not degenerate and morbid as Ibsen and Nordau would have us believe, but is healthy, vigorous, full of bouyancy. The Odyssey, Homer, The · Canterbury Tales, and Thomas A. Kempis' '' Imitation of Christ,\ are works that have sur- vived when others perished, simply because of their naturalness and vitality. Ulysses was a • typical \young man.\ Even in old age his vitality was as fresh and untouched as in his youth. Our ideal is too often to become what we call \.independent\ as early as possible. But in this we are wrong, for man was made for action. Why do we adtnire Shakespeare? Because he . was a sound and wholesome active man. From \Romeo and Juliet\ to \The Tetnpest\ his '\Vorks breathe forth the same im1nortal vitality. Another use of great books is that they freshen our ideals. Great books are the custodians of ideals and filled to overflowing with them. As long as great books exist man will never lose his faith in something higher. fl]e UlesterQ Base Ball Trip. The western trip of the base ball team last week resulted in three defeats. After losing to Hatnilton, as told in our last issue, the second game was played with Syracuse on Friday. In spite of sotne good individual plays Syracuse won by a score of 8 to 3. Wild throwing and inability to run bases \\\rere the reasons for the defeat. Saturday afternoon the team again niet defeat at the hands of Cornell. Purchase was not well enough to play and as he failed to send any word to the team, the game was played with a substitute short-stop. As a result the s·core was piled up against us until the Cornell men were too weary to make any more runs. The score was 44 to 5. Although the weeks' record was very discouraging it ought not to be dishearten- ing. Good steady practice and enthusiastic support by the student body may yet give a better ending of the season. Let each one feel that he is personally responsible for a part of the season's record, and the tea1n will thus be enabled to do the work that it can and we all hope will do. For ~ommeQ\emeQt JiOQOr5.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 5 Obituary. '111 DR. JOHN R. FRENCH, '~ Syracuse University has suffered a great loss in the death of Dr. John Raymond French, Vice-Chancellor of the University and Dean of the College of Liberal Arts. Dr. French had been ill for a long time ~nd last 11onday he passed peacefully away. The funetal took place at his horne on Wednesday. Di·. French was born at Pulaski, Oswego County, April 2:1, 1825. After attending the Mexico Academy he taught school for several years, preparing himself m:eanwhile for the Senior class at Union, which he entered in 1841. He becan1e a tnetn ber of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity and graduated with honors in 184-I. After teaching in several places, he practiced · law for five years and in 1864 hecatne professor . of mathetnatics in Genessee College at Lima . When Genessee and Syracuse were united Dr. French was made Dean of the College of Liberal Arts. He received the degree of A. M.. from · Wesleyan in r852, and of L.L. D. frotn Allegheny in I 87 I. Last year he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society and was made Vice-Chancellor of the University. The Yale \Navy\ is in a great state of excite- ment over the resignation of Simpson, who pulled stroke on the 'Varsity crew. The date for this year's Harvard-U. P. foot ball game has been fixed for Saturday, Nov. 20, and it will tal{e place in Cambridge. The Yale- Harvard game will probably be .. Nov. 13. A new science building, called Williams Hall, has recently been completed at the Uni- versity of Vermont. It is the gift of Dr. Edward H. Williams of Philadelphia and cost $6o,ooo. At the invitation of Lieutenant Peary, Pro- fessor Hitchcock of Dartmouth College is organizing a party among the younger members of the faculty to go to Greenland this summer. Yale and Harvard will meet for the first time since their reconciliation, May 15, at New Haven, in track and field games. Beside the fourteen regular events there \vill be a relay race. The board of trustees of Johns Hopkins University has passed resolutions authorizing two undergraduate students, James Thomas and Edgeworth Smith, to publish a college gaper. If it is successful, it will be given over to the whole student body. Rutgers College has recently been brought to the attention of the public by the celebration of Charter Day~· the one hundred and thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the college, ten . years before the birth of the republic. The guest of honor at this natal celebration day was the Hon. Garrett A. Hobart, an alumnus of Rutgers, whose recent election to the vice- presidency of the United States conferred additional honor upon that institution. LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY AT HARVARD. The comic opera, \Fool's Gold,\ which has just been presented by Harvard students, has drawn considerable attention on account of the name of the author, Vivian Burnett, the original \Little Lord Fauntleroy,\ now grown to be a strapping young fellow. It is an interesting coincidence that while the son, a student at Harvard, is making his first attetnpt at writing, Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett, the mother, has a very sttcc~ssful play on the boards at one of the leading New York theatres. Ex.presideQt potter Ceetures. Former President Eliphalet Nott Potter, who has recently t·esigned the presidency of Hobart College to take up his residence here in the near future, is spending a few days as the guest of Prof. Sidney G. Ashmore. Yesterday morning he delivered an address before the Senior class in sociology, taking as his subject \Archi- tecture.\ The subject was treated with that degree of eloquence so characteristic of Dr. Potter and was a welcome variation frotn the routine of recitations.

WE CALL the attention of our readers to a conl- munication, appearing in this issue, that treats of our present athletic troubles in a peculiarily strik · ing manner. The writer certaiuly appreciates the existing conditions and proposes the only sure manner of bettering them. AGAIN the management of THE CONOORDIENSIS is compelled to call upon the subscriberrs still in arrears to pay up. Many have claimed that ac- cording to precedent they ought not to pay until the third term. Now is the ti1ne for all such men to pay their subscriptions, and they will not only oblige the management by so doing, but will aid materially in making the paper a financial success. This can be done only by an in~mediate remita tance by all who have not as yet paid their sub- scriptions. THERE is an organization in college of which every Union man ought to be proud. At a time when our athletics are not quite as flourishing as we might wish, the Musical Association is busily engaged in spreading the na1ne and fame of old Union as it has never been spread before. The recent trip to New York ·was a new departure and proved a fitting culmination <>f this year's work. At e-very place 'vhere a concert has been giv.en the press has given the association unqualified praise, and at Albany and New York the concerts-were Inost favorably compared with those given by the musical clubs of other colleges. It is noteworthy that the fine record of the Musical Association is directly traceable to four causes; energetic, capable management, the untir- ing efforts of trained and carefulleader:s, a feeling of personal interest and responsibilty on the part o.f every member, and good, hard, earnest, prelimi- nary training. We would reco1nmend these whole- sonle characteristics of the Musical Association. to the attention of every organization in Union college. Y:m UNION boys whose pipes are lit, Come forth in merry throng; Upon the terrace let us sit And cheer our souls with song; Old Prex. may have his easy chair,. The Czar may have his throne, Their cushions can get worse for wear, But not our seat of stone. Every son of Old Union knows this song and the customs it characterizes-one of the best that was ever established for bringing the men in college together to unite their voices in the songs that breathe the spirit and enthusiasm of this grand old institution. It is a custom that should be preserved, and every man in college can do his part by coming out on the next warm night and swelling the chorus. Thou grand old seat of stone, Thou jolly old seat of stone, Then here's to thee right merrily, Thou grand old seat of stone. THE recent trip of the base ball team has caused much comment among the undergraduates and alumni of the college. And from the outcome of the games played the nature of the criticism is far from favorable to the team. In· justice to the men who constitute the team, and in order to en- lighten those alumni who enquire, \Why do you allow such an aggregation to represent the Union\ it seems fitting that a statement of the case should be made. The athletic organization of the college ha.s not had tin1e to recover completely from its disor-

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 ganized condition of last spring,. and the most sanguine Union man cannot exp~ct to see this year~s Varsity, composed as it is almost entirely of green mate1·ial, play ball with the ability and ac- curacy of veterans. But the base ball team is able to play a better game, and to do it they need good hard practice, and plenty of it. That is the only means by which they can gain the experience and · confidence necessary for winning games. And the only way in which the team can be influenced to this kind of practice is by such a revival of college spirit as will cause the \Old Gray Walls\ to echo •· and re-echo the victorious Hik.ah. o~e l.J f}iVer5i ty ~atalo~ue.

ScHENECTADY, N.Y., April 27, r897 .. Editor of The Concord·iensls :-· I tal{e the liberty of offering a little professional advice at a time when it seems much needed. Al>out one year ago the athletic organism of Union College was prostrated from an over- dose of physic administered by excited students, who had been incited by the faculty to itntne- diate and radical action. The recovery from such heroic treatn1ent is necessarily slo'v and accompanied with tnany discourage1nents ; but it is safe and sure for the proper method has been adopted to bring it back to health and strength. After the thorough purging, the con- stitution of the patient was treated with great care and foresight. But, you will say, the organs are not fulfiling their functions as effic,iently as they did before the purification. Certainly they are not, and why? Because the body previous to the treattnent was kept up by stimulants that are no longer administered. Some of those stimulants are now wisely for- bidden, but the convalescence of the patient would be rapid and joyful if it should receive large and copious z\nject-lons of college spirz\t. Hoping that those interested will assist in carrying out the prescribed treatment before there is another collapse, I am Yours truly, A. RooTER, M. D. The Theta Sigma society of the Union Classical Institute gave a delightful entertain- ment and dance at Arcade Hall last night. Q!.tite a number of the students were present and an enjoyable time was had by all. North College and South College played a game of base ball on the campus last Saturday. North College won by a score of 26 to 21. The batteries were: North College, Reynolds and Jones ; South College, Merchant and Tuggy.

. ·The Concordiensis VoL. XX. UNION COLLEGE, M.AY 8, 1897. .No. 29. The college spirst and enthusiasm which has been so remarkably characteristic of Union in the days gone by, was revived if not equaled, by the display of college patriotism which took place in front of Nott Memorial Hall, on Wed- nesday evening. Dr. Raymond announced two days before that there would be a gathering there, but its nature was not disclosed. Shortly before 7 o'clock the students assembled in front of South college and then marched to the centre of the campus where the faculty and their families had already seated themselves. College and clas_s yens were given for the various professors, and Union songs were sung. Drs. Whitehorne and Wells were missing from the faculty and the students divided themselves into two parties, one of which went for Dr. Whitehorne and the other for Dr. Wells. The former succeeded after several hearty yells, in inducing the vener- able professor' of Greek to come out. The party formed itself into two long lines, one on either side of the walk and allowed the ex-dean to pass through the center. He was then escourted to the can1pus. The party who went for Dr. Wells prevailed upon him to come out and he was escourted to the campus. The exercises then began. The students seated themselves on the lawn directly in front of the west steps of the round building, the alumni, faculty and ladies occupied seats farther back, and the musical clubs rendered several pleasing selections frotn the st~ps. Dr. Raymond called the informal gathering to order and made a very interesting address on the days when he was an undergraduate, and described the celebrations of the class of '75· Dr. Whitehorne was then called for and spoke on the present spirit of harmony, justice and fellowship which prevails at Union, and repeat- edly thanked the students for the honor shown him on the occasion. Dean Ripton was pre- vailed upon to address the gathering, and gave a laughable account of his college days and the experiences of the class of 'So, in Dr. White- horne's room. Repeated calls were heard for Dr. Perkins, and .at length he took his position on the steps and gave some humorous remarks, many of which were at the expense of the Dean. Todd, '97, Williams, '97, Birch, '97, Cr.ich- ton, '98 and Herring, '97, made speeches, and the whole programme was interspersed with songs and selections by the musical association, and the Sophomore quartet. Cook, '98, also gave an impersonation. At the close of the exercises a parade was made through the principal streets of the city. flQ Opii]iOIJ ~oQeerQiQ~ Dr. Wells. A recent .nutnber of the Northern Christlan Advocate contained the following complimentary notice concerning Professor Wells : ''One of the most pleasant features of the recent session of the Troy Conference was the address of Prof. William Wells, of Union College, on Thursday morning, in which he indulged in a most delight .. ful strain of reminiscences, alluding affectionately to some of the prominent members of the con- ference as his boys. He was greeted with an ovation. He has not only been eminent as an educator for nearly half a century, but his grace- ful and prolific pen has made his name fa1niliar throughout the Church and the country. He is now seventy-seven years of age, but though his hair is white, his form is elastic and his eyes are as bright, his smile is as winning, and his tongue as fluent as ever.

THE o·ONCORDIENSIS. It has come to our know ledge that there is more or less uncertainty as. to jnst what the new athletic field is to be, and what is to be ac- complished by its construction. One of the main reasons why our athletics have not ·of late been more beneficial to the student body and to the reputation of the college has been first, the lack of facilities, and second, the consequent lack of funds.. . This has prevented the greatest development of our tnaterial, has rendered our arrange- ments for the season very uncertain, made our policies often inconsistent, and caused a frequent and almost permanent call upon alumni for financial assistance, in return for which thev receive most discouraging results. .. By means of this new athletic :field it is intended to obviate these two main handicaps, and incidentally benefit athletics in manv other ol ways. The plan calls for a field with two base ball diamonds, two foot ball fields if possible, a good sized well-made and drained track, with grand stand and also uncovered seats, the whole to be enclosed by a suitable fence. Careful estimates have been made by alumni thoroughly in touch with athletic affairs, and there is every reason to believe that with this improved equipment, every one can be made to pay instead of only those who are willing, as now, then with the subscriptions and the grand stand receipts, and the normal increase in atten- dance that will result from suitable accommo- dations, the total receipts will be at least double the present receipts. This will terminate the calls upon alumni for financial assistance, and will assume such support as will enable those in charge of athletic affairs to provide all the neces- sary equipment and trainers to turn out the best teams we can produce. · But of great moment, perl1aps, is the fact that with this new field, there will be oppor- tuniti'e·s for every one to get out in the open air and enjoy the healthy out door sports in the many impromptu games that will surely take place, and the whole athletic ground will not he reserved for the members of the various teams, as is now practically the case. This will neces- sarily bring about a greater interest in athletics, a greater devotion to tbetn during spare time, and not so much to less beneficial ways of spending the hours of recreation. The teams . will be better, the honor of playing on them greater, the desire to play stronger, and hence a greater desire not to be barred from playing on account of deficiency in scholarship. Then athletes, that comtnon meeting .ground . for the divers interests and tastes of under- graduate life, will be what they should be to the student body, and there will of necessity be a great advancement in w.hat is perhaps. best expressed by the Frenchman's esj>rlt de corps. If this can be accomplished by .a new enclosed athletic field, is not the object worthy of our best endeavors? Surely every alutnnus asked will give liberally, promptly and once for all, to such an undertaking, and we are suve the under- gradnate body will heartily co-operate. Every one of the classes from '75 to '95 has made some progress in the raising of ~heir quota of the necessary funds, and several of them have exceeded the minimum amount. A neat sum was realized from the lecture with which we were so kic.dly favored by Mr. Melville D. Landon, '61, \Eli Perldns.\ And there seems no good reason why the .new field should not soon be an actuality, At the proper time THE CoNCORDIENSIS will start a fund to help out the cause. Prof, William Wells commenced on Fridav a series, of lectures to the Junior classicals o~ '' German Literature.\ His Uiual spring term lectures on current topics will be omitted tbis year. E. E.

Brown, have been in attend- ance at the 56th annual convention of the Chi Psi fraternity, held at the Holland H<>use, New York, during the past week.

THE. ,O'ONCORDIENSIS. 5 No department of Union's athletics has a more promising outlook for the future than the field and track. Too much encouragement can- not be given to this branch of athletics. It is, and should be an important factor, and now under the stimulus of a proposed new athletic field, not only this but every branch of athletics should be enthusiastically supported. In the past our nien have worked with a de- termination to n1ake Union famous in athletics, and accomplished what they sought. If the present team work, with the same detennination and ~nthusiasm, the result need not he feared. The popularity of track athletics here is well attested by the number of men trying to tnake the teatn, which in its present condition i:s very strong. We will send not only a strong, but a winning team to the inter-collegiate n1eet at Utica, June 5th. The Freshtnan class is train- ing a large n urn ber of .tnen, several of whom will undoubtedly be winners in their events before they leave college. There is a large number of men training for all the events. The following is a partial list of the competitors for the events: Milen.in, Multer, '97, Hartnagle, '98, Wright, '99· Half-1nile; Hinn1an, '99, French, '99, French, 1900, Raitt, 1900.

The present '.good condition of affairs and bright prospects for the future have been brought a bout by the efficient services of mana- ger Herring, assistant manager Cox, and captain O'Neill, while at the same time the supervision of the athletic board and the enthusiasm of the students, have influenced it in no small way. In the bicycle and relay races, shot-put and mile walk, we are sure of first places, and some others are doubtful. With these firsts and a good average in others, Union should easily win the meet. We are proud of our past records. May we not be likewise of those we shall n1ake in the future. ScHENECTADY, N.Y., May 6, 1897. Erlitor of The Conoordiensis :- My Dear Sir: While not a teetotale1· on \rooters I venture to suggest that the maxim '' a place for everything and everything in its place,\ is quite applicable to them. The place for \ rooters\ is not near the third basen1an of the opposing team, nor yet near the first baseman, but well hack from all the players. It is possible to win games by \ rooting\ alone, but it is not permissible according to any decent code of student ethics with which I an1 acquainted. I dare believe that the games would be more enjoyable to a considerable part oft~e spectators if the \rooting\ were conducted With a keener sense of the fit and proper. Yours very truly, ALUMNUS.

Y, THE college \yell\ when ·well given is an agree- able and strong demonstration of enthusiasm. When poorly given, it is likely to be the flatest kind of a cheer and rarely encourages the con- testants in .a college base ball ga1ne. Union has a good number of rhythmic ''yells,\ and when they are well given are adrnirably suited to encou1·age the college teams. A PROPER amount of enthusiasm is a good thing when it is well directed. Enthusiasm however which Inanifests itself in wild and uncontrolable excesses, is generally of short duration. From its very intensity it is apt to burn itself out. It re- flects but little, if any, benefit upon the students affected or the interestsitisintended to encou~age. Honest enthusiasm which springs from the heart will generally remain within proper bounds. It is the sham, the make-believe article which over- steps the bounds of propriety. What we want is genuine enthusiasm. ~ THE ''rooting\ which occurred during the game Thnrsda.y afternoon was the best which has been heard on the ca1npus fo1· a long time. It however, 'Was not well directed. The question is the subject of a letter which we print elsewhere in this issue. THE 00NCORDIENSIS would suggest, that . the cheering be conducted. in a manner similar to that in vogue in some of the larger colleg·es. One man should act as a conductor and the entire student body should give the yell only when be directs. If such a plan were adopted suitable va1·iations in the ''yells \ could be indulged in and the harmony · and usefulness of the ''rooting'' materially in- creased. THE new wave of college spirit which has recently manifested itself is indeed encouraging. We are glad to note also that it is on .the increase, and every one interested in the college most sincerely hopes that it may r:esult not only in good returns from the spring games and the spring meets but also that it will be evident during the foot ball season next fall. College spirit to be effective however, most be both active and un- selfish. No student, no matter how loudly he cheers or how much he talks, has a proper college spirit if he falters when he is asked to become an active participant in the undergraduate a.ffairs of the college.. There are many men in college who bave never identified themselves with the various college tea1ns for the simple reason that they were too lazy. 'Ve know who you are, every one on the hill does, and no amount of talking or cheering can cover up laziness. .Successful athletic teams are simply the result of work. Dr. §aw:i f]' s C~etur~. The Rev. T. B. Sawin, D. D., of Troy, who so acceptably preached the sertnon on the day of prayer two years ago, gave a lecture in the chapel Friday afternoon on ''Some Illustrations of Browning.\ The undergraduate attendance wa& deplorably s1nall but it was off.C)et by the unusually large number of ladies who graced the occasion with their presence. Dr. Sawin read the poems \Paxinrotto \ Home Thoughts from Abroad,\ \ Meeting at Night,\ \Parting in the Morning,\ \By the Fireside,\ '' Clive,'' '' Appearances,\ and \Natural Magic.\ Each poem was analyzed and explained in a scholarly fashion and no one who heard the lecture can fail to take a warmer interest in Browning and his poems.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. . '~ - . ' - ,· ' . ' . . 7 THE HOME TEAM EASILY DEFEATS COLGATE BY A SCORE OF 18 TO I 2. Thursday afternoon a large crowd assembled on the campus to witness the base hall game between Union and Colgate. The jollification tneeting the evening before had served the purpose of raising a proper amount of college enthusiasm and the result of the ''rooting\ so encouraged the hotne team that each player, as he stepped to the plate, felt con- fident of his ability to safely place the ball in the outfield. The confidence of the players was not born of conceit as the result has shown. In the first inning Union found the ball and repeatedly sent it scudding across the diamond or batted it far out into the outer field. They succeeded in bringing safely home two runs before they surrendered the batting to the Colgate nine. The enthusiasm of the student body knew no bounds. Their hearty cheering raised the spirits of every one, and when Thatcher stepped into the pitcher's box, he confidently fondled the ball until Umpire Enders signaled to re- commence the playing. The Colgate tnen tried hard to find the ball which Thatcher knew so well how to tnanipulate, but succeeded only in touching it once for a slow grounder before three men were put out. In the second inning the Colgate team did better, as three of Unions batters were put out on their run for first base. The in-fielding of the Colgate players during this inning was excellent. Colgate however failed to score during this inning, though they did manage to find the ball several ti tnes. In the third inning Union hamtnered the ball unmercifully and succeeded in bringing in five scores, but Colgate also raised the stock of the visiting team by scoring three runs. After this both teams improved in their batting or the pitchers were becoming exhausted. In the fifth inning the home team got five more runs but Colgate returned the compliment by hitting the ball hard at the important time and run in seven scores. From this inning to the end of the game the playing on both sides was more steady, but the lead which the hon1e team had taken was too much for the visitors and the gatne closed with the score r8 to 12 in favor of Union.

Whether it was the result of playing on the home field or of better playing on the part of the team, it is itnpossible to say, at any rate we won and are correspondingly jubilant .. The game itself abounded in errors and the visitors were so demoralized from the start that making runs was with Union only a tnatter of form. Thatcher, in the pitcher's box, kept Hamilton guessing and Guy Vroman, '98, a new- comer on the team, played second base in a way that was the admiration of all. Hamilton was completely outbatted and her frequent changeii in the positions of her players added to her dis- comfiture. The score follows :

The Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity has beea · suggested to inaugurate atnong the coUege · fraternities of America a movement by wltich a fund may be raised to assist natiYe Greeks in . America to return to their homes. In view of the present war in which their country is en- gaged with the Turks, the Greeks are naturally anxious to participate in the trouble. The · tnoney subscribed will be used only for trans- portation purposes, and will not buy ammunition • or arms, thus violating the principles of national neutrality. It is desired that this matter be brought before the attention of all fraternities and their re- spective chapters.

By a vote of 17 to 9 the Michigan state senate has passed the bill to suppress glove contests and foot ball games.

When the bill was put on its passage Senator Merrilnan, thinking his amendment might lose the measure some votes., asked that it be re- called, but the effort to save foot ball failed._,.

The Concordien_sis VoL. XX. UNION COLLEGE, MAY 15, 1897. No. so. f~of. Sidnex Q-. Ashm<;>re gave an interesting and instructive lectute on Ro1ne in the coUege 'thi\pe.~, 'fhU.rsday evening May 13. The lecture -w;~s ill}\strat~d by large, clear lantern slides w.;bic4 were o:pet·a:ted by Prof. Howard Opdyke. ~rQf~ A~hmor~ p:t;\efaced his lecture by read- ~~.~~ a, ~chp.larly paper concerning the Romans and the relics they have left us. We, to-day, in our nineteenth century of progress and inv~en­ tion fail to realize that the Romans followed the same lines of civilizalion. They have [eft numberless specimens of sculpture, memorials and architecture every one of which bear valu- ~ble inscriptions whicl1 are of great use to us in studying their laws, customs, history and ln- stltuti<>ns. The paper wai expository rather than historical. The illustrated portion of the lecture began with a lat·ge clear picture of the Roman forum as It appears to-day since the debris of centuries has been removed. The level of modern Rotne is· thirty feet· above that of the ancient city. The lecturer carefully pointed out and explained every portion of the picture. Views of the forum from different directions were thrown on the canv:~ss, and then pictures of the restored structures of home were taken up. The colis- $eum, the· great theatre of Rome, was portrayed and its·. general structure, arrangement and uses e-xplained. Various other views to the number Qf·aboutthir.ty were shown which illustrated the temples and: other structures of the ancient metr.p.polis·. €er:tahdy no one left the lecture without feel- ing, wAll' repaid for attending and a much closer acquaintance· with the ancient people and their institutions. lt~v. J e:>hn J. Henning. '81, of Green Island, W~i on ·the hiil Saturday afternoon.. On Monday ~vening of this ~eek th:e fQt\~ fraternities which constitute the '' Q.uad\ as:sem~ bled at the Yates boat house for the putpose of fittingly celebrating the conclusion of the series of whist and bowling gatnes which occupied theix attention during the winter term. Nearly eyery 1nem ber of the Quad was· present and with b11:t few exceptions all brought ladies with them. Music was furnished by Gioscia and refresh- ments by Doberman. The evening w.~s delight- fully cool and every one entered into the spirit of the occasion and danced until the early qours of the morning. By common consent no ca~ds were made out and not more than two ()r three . dances were engaged ahead. The result was a greater diversity in the partners for the various · dances. The new plan worked well and was particularly appreciated by those who came to · the dance without ladies. The dance proved so successful that it has been decided to hold another later in the season. West poiQt 8, UQiOQ 7· Last Saturday the base ball team played the West Point team on its home grounds and Union was defeated by the score of 8 to 7· In the second inning Union made four runs and victory seemed certain. But although our bat- teries were good the ragged fielding held the score down and West Point slowly crept up. At the end of the eighth inning the scor~ wa.s. tied and West Point won by one run in. the· ninth. The score follows: R. H. E.

Through the courtesy of Professor Charles S. Proiser we have recently received a copy of The · University Geologlcal Survey of Kansas. The book is an extremely valuable one. It con- tains over 308 pages devoted to a description of tJ:le geological formations of that state. It is em- bellished by many illustrations and the descrip- tive portions of the text are extretnely interest- ing. Professor Prosser who fonnerly was con- nected with The Unz'versz'ty o.f Kansas has contributed l40 pages, descriptive of fhe Upper Permian and the Lower Cretaceous. His work forms the major portion of the volume. The American Geologz'st for April recognizes the work, of Professor Prosser in this connection .and gives him complimentary notice. Sheehan, '98, who was summoned to his home in Hamilton, Ohio, by the death of his father returned Monday. The second base hall game in the series be- tween North College and South College was played on the campus last Saturday. At the beginning of the game South College obtained a long read and North College was unable to catch up, the score being 30 to 14. As each coUege has won a gatne a third will be played to decide the championship. 'f'lle value of these games is greater than one wou~d think. They fill the campus with an ex- cited crowd of students and do more to keep up colleg9 spirit than almost anything else. Besides this they develop new material and are of direct aid to the 'varsity. Manager Herring of the track team has secured the services of John Cosgrove of Albany to coach the tea1n .. The coach is a well- known all-round athlete and is well suited to his position. The management also has re- engaged Louis Cleary, last year's trainer. There is now no excuse why every man in college should not get out on the track and see in what events he can excel. With an efficient coach, a trainer, and plenty of good material, there is no reason why Union should not win the meet at Utica. ~~UT Boo~s for t~~ Cibrary. The German alcove in the library has received. a gift of 162 volutnes of Gennan works from the library of one of the students. The gift includes the works of Gustav Schilling, 72 volumes, Thier's French History, 40 volumes, 15 bound volumes of'' Die Segenvart,\ \Mexico Repub- lic an<l Empire\ by Arthur Storch., 4 volumes, the Austrian National Encyclopaedia, 8 volumes, Meyer's \Universum l5 volumes and some miscelLaneous works. Sawyer, '95, was in town Monday and at- tended the '' Q..uad\ dance.

THE. OONCOEDIENSIS. 5 The success of the last campus tneeting and the enthusiasm it instilled in the students _prompted them to undertake a similar affair for the future. It was decided to leave the whole matter of arrange1nents .and date to the follow- ing comtnittee which was appointed by Presi- dent Frey, of the Senior class ; O'Neill, 97, Mattison, '98, Champion; '99 and Ban1ber, 1900. The committee met on Friday afternoon and decided to hold the next campus tneeting on \Vednesday evening, May 19, at 7 o'clock. Several 1nembers of the faculty have been in- · vited to deliver speeches and they have kindly . . consented to help the affi\tir along. The Musi- 'cal association will take a protninent part in the progra1nme, and the Sopho.more quartette will r,ender several selections. Cook, 1900, is pre- paring a serious lecture on comedy which be will then deliver for the first titne. Several ex- tetnporaneous talks may be expected from the undergraduates. The Seniors are to appear in cap and gown and the Freshmen are to furnish a large bond fire during the exercises. The students will all illu1ninate their windows and the faculty are requested to do the sa1ne. This will probably be the. last catnpus rneet- ing of the year and the committee are n1aking every effort to make it the best. The Tennis committee was appointed recently, and cotnprises Daley, '97, Hoxie, '98, Sawyer, '99, and Lawton, 1900. The committee has had the courts put into excellent condition and practice will begin itnmediately for the annual spring championship. The contest will probably occur early in June, and the indications are that it will be of unusual interest. No steps have been taken as yet toward an inter-collegiate contest, but such will be arranged in the near future. The committee requests the fellows to keep of the courts unless provided with proper shoes. ll)t~r .. ~:lass Bas~ Ball (iames.

A dozen picked men will probably represent this institu- tion there. Excellent headquarters have been secured for Union. The Amsterda1n Sentl1zel says : A move- tnent is on foot to organize a base ball team to play Union college in this city at some future date. There is good base ball material in this city, hut lack of available playing grounds will put a damper on the scheme. Saturday afternoon Professor James li. Stoller of Union college, presented a paper on \The Educational Value of Nature Study\ be- fore the spring meeting of the Montgomery County Teachers' association at the Central Grammar school on Spring street, Amsterdam.

''IF THE treatment wnich Colgate received at , Schenectady last week is any indication. of the I future l'ela.tions of the two colleges it appears that an era of good feeling bas already begun. Never has Colgate been better treated by U uion,, both on the grounds at the hands of the umpire and the enthusiastic crowd, and off the field by the manager and the college men in general.\ The foregoing quoted from the Madisonensis the official paper of Colgate University distinct'ly shows that the undergraduat~s of that institution appre.ciate a display of enthusiasm and college I spirit such. as was made by our undergraduates during tl1e, game with their base ball tea,m last . week. In another portion of the same paper ap- 1 peared the following. '''The fact that Union won the game at Schenec- tady is '\due to a great extent to the manner in 'vhich the students conducted the cheering. In this way defeat is often changed into victory. \ What better proof can be offered in favor- of systematic cheering? We now appreciate the value of encouraging our athletic teams in this manner and at evexy future opportunity we should make use of the lesson learned. Subscribers are requested to n1ake checks pay- i able to Edward E. Draper, Business Manager~ IN THIS same connection we wish to call the attention of the students to the ever brightening prospects for the athletic season of '97 and '98. Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N.Y., as second-class matter. OHA8. BURROWs, PRINTER AND BINDER, SCHENECTADY, N.Y. WHILE the athletic interests of the college suf· fered materially from the lack of intelligent man- agement during the closing months of the reign of the class of '96, a far different effect has been noticed in connection with the musical and literary organizations. The new regulations which of necessity were imposed upon athletics by the faculty caused many students to turn their attention to other branches of student activity. The result has been that a greater interest has been taken in the work of the two literary societies, and the:various musi· cal organizations. Union never had better musical clubs than she has had this past season. A large number of concerts have been given and wherever they have gone they have given universal satisfac· tion and reflected much credit upon the college. Mr. Todd as manager deserves unstinted praise for the intelligent and efficient manner in 'vhich he has conducted the affairs of the clubs. The various leaders and the men themselves have acquitted themselves as becomes students of a.n. old and time honored college. , The requirements which have been placed upon the aspirant for athletic honors will in the future make it an honor to be envied by all to be counted a member of any one of the athletic tean1s of the college. We have noticed however that there is a ten- dency among many of the students of the college and pa1·tieularly among the n1embers of many of the leading fraternities to avoid the severe physi- cal training which a connection with anv one of .. these teams makes necessary, these students shrink from the performance of a duty because· they find it easier to lounge about their rooms in friendly conversation with the me1nbers of their fraternity or ·with other friends equally as indiffer- ent as they are thernselves. Such a condition of a:ffairs is not in harmony with the best interests of the college. Fraternities should urge their nlem- ber to become active participants in the affairs of the college. If such was the sentiment throughout the col- lege ; if every able bodied man in this institution was earnestly striving for the privilege of wearing the initial letter of the college on his sweater then victory wou.ld be the rule and defeat at all times honorable.

Fiske, of New York, has given $240,000 to Barnard College for a new • building. It will be called Fiske Hall in honor of her husband. The reception given the Bro\-vn base ball team on their return home from the recent game in which they defeated Harvard, is said to have been the most enthusiastic in the history of the college. By the unanimous decision of the judges, Princeton won the annual debate held with Yale. The judges were Josiah Quincy of Boston, George E. Waring of New York and Carroll D. Wright of Washington. The annual Yale-Harvard Dual Athletic Games will be held Saturdav afternoon at Yale ., Field, New Haven. The C()ntest this year pron1ises to be most hotly contested.

There are six players on each team and the following colleges are represented : Yale, Harvard, University <>f Pennsylvania, Princeton and Columbia. It is teported that a prominent and generous Princeton alumnus has recently cornmunicated with the exectitive committee of the University Athletic association inquiring if it would be of any advantage to the foot ball players to be able to row during the spring. If such was the case HARVARD'S N,EW DORMiTORY. Har\\\ard will soon have a new dormitory to cost $I so,ooo. It will be a brick structure arranged on three :sides of a hoUow square ..

The Concordien_sis VoL. XX. UNION COLLEGE, MAY ·22, 1897. No. 31. 1'1re base ball team was scheduled to play the Rutgers College tean1 at Ridgefield, last Satur- day and accordingly arrangements were made an<l: tickets sold for the game. The team, accompanied by a large number of the students, went to Albany to play the game, but the Rutgers team failed either to appear or to send an.:y wot~d to the management. Although Union was in ·no way responsible such affairs place us in a11 unfortunate position. We do not wish to stigmatize with :epithets the conduct of the R1:1tgers management but it seen1s to us alto- gether inexplicable. 'f'o satisfy the crowd a team was made up of Co()k, '99, and some Albany High School and :Ridgefield pia yers and Union was defeated by this heterogeneous collection by the score of I r to ·~· 1JlSION.

UfesteriJ fllllfl)IJi DitJe. The annual banquet of the Union CoUeg~ Alumni Association of V\ 7 estern New York '\iVas held Friday, May 14, at Rochester. Covers were laid for thirty-five. The Sophomore Q}lartet, consisting of Messrs. McMahan, Green, Wiley and Hinman, enlivened the crowd with college songs. Dr. Little, '55, president of the association, presided. Among others present were Stevens K. Williams, '37, a former trustee of the college; ex-President Webster, the Rev. Dr. Millard, '53, Dean Ripton and Allen, '95. Dr. Little in his opening speech referred to the condition of the dormotories at Union and begged the Alumni to come to the support of this urgent need. Dean Ripton spoke of the increase of students and professors in the last six or eight years, and also of the increased number of courses. The Rev. Dr. Millard referred to the Centennial Commencement of '95, saying that at that time he heard of the past glories of Union, and was now glad to hear of her present glories. Allen, '95, informed the alumni that the College Mu- sical Association intend to take a Western trip next year. The enthusiasm throughout was great. Col- lege songs and yells were given again and again.

THE CON0'0~DIENSIS. Dr. J1aymoQd's 8ermoiJ. President A. V. V. Raymond delivered a · highly interesting and instructive sermon before theY. M. C. A .. meeting in the chapel last Sun- day afternoon. His text was taken from • Proverbs xxix, 18, \ Where there is no vision . the people perish.\ The sermon follows in part: The whole meaning of the text turns on the • word, 'vision,' which means a communication from God. Prophecies were called visions. It :, is any divine revelation by which religious truth, distinguished from materialistic truth, comes to man. Many to-day question the practical necessity of spiritual things for two causes, the excesses of religious m.en and the hypocrisy of those who pretend to be devout. We have a discouraging idea of a holy man, we : believe that he must be a religious specialist, a ; monk or a minister.. We forget that the dis- ciples and apostles were every day, practical men.. We are on the lookout for hypocrisy for we know of so many backsliding Christians. If we get beneath the surface of man and find where every day life and spirituality meet, we come at last to morality as the basis of peace, prosperity and social life. Sin is the only weak- ness; it makes cowat·ds and failures in life. Morality is not separate from spiritual life. The accomplishment or the attainment of what we deem the best things and the sacrifice of all else in the path leading to those ends, is a great law of life. Therefore, all depends upon what we think is best. If you eliminate God, what do you find bind· ing about '' Thou shalt not steal?\ Why should I be bound by society? If you say, '' Honesty is the best policy,\ I may 1·easonably reply, \you only say so.\ Eliminate God and you cannot establish that principle. Every command gets its authority from its source. It would be a great relief to have the de- formed in body and mind put out of the world. We have courts to judge the sanity of men, why not to judge their usefulness? The sacredness of the law of life given by God forbids it. This is a righteous law given by a righteous law giver. No moral law can abide without spi·ritual sane- tion. There are various ways of increasing the spiritual good, not by legislation or education, but by the proclamation of the gospel of truth. Moral principles get their sauction from spiritual considerations. It is the light of a single sun, not the light of the theorist or philosopher, but the light which shines from the face of Jesus Christ. 8t. Cawrei]Ge 10, tiiJiOQ 6. The finest game of base ball that has been seen on the campus for two years was played Tuesday afternoon between the St. Lawrence University and the 'Varsity. The gan1e was characterized throughout by snappy brilliant playing and was full of hard clean hitting and good fielding. Although Union played a good hard game, St. Lawrence won by superior play- ing. The score follows : UNION. AB R 1B PO A E French, s. s. . . . . . . . . . . . . .... 5 1 1 2 2 2 Smith, c. f ........

Afte1· parades, war dances and prodigous howlings the classes gathered in front of Memorial hall, where a large crowd of ladies and others were seated. President Ray- n1ond, Dean Ripton,, Professor Truax and In- structor Bennett gave addresses, as did also Todd, '97 ; Herring, '97, and Willian1s, '97. The Sophomore Quartet sang several selections in its inimitable style, and the -entire assemblage joined in college songs and yells. The corrnnittee in charge was O'Neill, '97; Mattison, '98; Cham- pion, '99, and Ban1ber, 1900. rJi\Qety.SeueQ ~OIJduets Its cast ~on~~e rn~etif]~. An extended and enthusiastic college 1neeting was held Friday rnorning after chapel exercises. A large a1nount ofbusiness was transacted and college songs were sung with spirit and fervor. The election of tnen to fill the offices which will be vacated by rnernbers of the Senior class was the first order of business. The result of the election is as follows : Secretary of the athletic board, Walter M. .Swann; assistant foot ball tnanager, Harold J. Hintnan ; repre- sentative to the N. l:r. S. I. C. A. U., Francis E. Cullen. Another campus meeting with its various ac- companin1ents of song, speeches and good fel- lowship took place Wednesday evening. It is safe to say that never in tecent years has so m\.ICh college spirit and healthy enthusiasm been displayed as at the meeting. North and South college were both brilliantly illuminated, and Greek fire cast a ruby light upon the scene. In accordance with the old custom President Frye of the Senior class turned over executive function to President Crichton of the Junior class, and the Seniors n1oved back to the seats they first occupied when they entered college, allowing the other classes to assume the posi- tions they will maintain during the retnainder of the term and the next college year. After the college meeting the Seniors held a conference and jubilee, the selecting and rehear- sing of class songs being the 111ost important business transacted. This meeting was ad- journed to the steps of the '' Red Building\ where the Senior class in cap and gown were photographed.,

It is to be hoped that these organizations will creditably represent us there. Friday's exhibition of our men in the field and on the track gives us every reason to hope for success. The n1erits of the musical clubs need not be ques- tioned as they have already repeatedly shown their ability to creditably represent the college. A large number of men should accompany the team when it goes to Utica. We mention it now so they may have ample tilne to prepare for the trip. WHILE we regret to record a defeat for the Union nine in Tuesday's game with St. Lawrence University, yet it gives us supreine pleasure to be able to say that the home tearn played welL After our '' off day \ game with Ridgefield we were pre- pared to expect almost anything. Tuesday's game was a credit to both tean1s and Union's defeat is certainly one not to be mourned over.

Edito1· of The Concorrdiensis :-- A few inte~ested persons who went to Albany to assist in the \' rooting \ last Saturday desire to be allowed to express themselves through the medium of the college paper. It is said tl1at there are a good Inany students as well as towns-people swearing over the result of the gan1e which Union played last Saturday at Albany on the Ridgefield grounds. There is not the slightest nse in swearing in our opinion unless there is something to swear at. No one should be so heartless ,as to swear at our poor little nine· which is trying so hard to lift the base ball inter- ests out of the bog of hoodooism where it was cast by a few future B1-yanites of the class of '96. Now, \\Yhat our colleg·e. nine needs is a little encourage- ment, a little college spirit that will yell then1 on to victory. An alutunus 'vho used to play base ball a few years ago, said, u What the Union nine needs is a few men who know how to play ball.\ He evi- dently thought l1e knew all about it, but he is mis- taken. vVhat was really needed was a little more turbulent college spirit, the kind that howls. College spirit which brings men out on the dia1nond in hard earnest practice is a n uisanee. Nine men are, enough to play baJl, and \\Ve have them so -what 1nore do you want? There is n()t the slightest sense either, in swear- ing because the Rutgers nine failed to put in an appearance. And as for swea1·ing at the team which beat us, we have forgotten their name, that would be positi:vely rude. They played to accmu- modate us, and they absolutely had to beat us. They couldn't do anything else. A SENIOR AND Two JuNIORS. After a gr·eat deal of hesitation we finally con- clude to give the above letter the space asked for. Not howeve1· because 've wish to subscribe to the sentiluent therein expressed but because we note therein a genuine spirit of interest in the athletics of the college notwithstanding the general sarcas- tic tone of letter. In it there are certainly ex- pressed some good ideas. The most important is the t•eference to \turbulent college spirit.\ The sarcasm here may not be uncalled for. Indeed ·we are Inucb inclined to tbinl\: that noisy college

If they a.re sincere they are probably out on the diamond every day if not they are the carping critics their letter show·s them to be. The annual spring meet at the .Driving Park, on Friday afternoon, May 21,was weU attended considering the inclemency of the weather. A high wind was blowing continually and carried dust into the faces and eyes of the spectators as well as of the contestants, yet the college records in the mile walk and one mile bicycle race were broken. The events were run off with prompt- ness and too tnuch credit cannot be gh·en to Manager Herring, Captain O'Neill and Clerk Todd for the general good management of the meet.

TI-IE CONOORDIENSIS. Syraeuse 15; UQiO·Q 7· The base ball ga1ne last Saturday betw:een Syracuse and the 'Varsity had been ea;get·ly awaited by the students and it was hoped that the defeat of a month ago could be wiped out. . Things certainly looked favorable for our side · · the first few innings, but son1e costly errors on our part brought in the runs which ultimately ·-,won the ga~me. The attendance was the best of -the season and many strangers from out of t()'\iVn were present, especially large numbers of the . · fair sex. The game was called protnptly at 3 :I5 with Union at the bat. In this inning Union tnade two runs, but Syracuse follo'\ved with three ;: in the next inning, however, Union n1ade four t·uns to Syracuse's one and the score stood six to four in Union's favor. Syracuse now took a brace and but one n1ore run was scored by Union, while Syracuse n1ade severa 1 on account of some ragged fielding on our part, the final score being Syracuse 15, Union 7· 1\he features of the g:r.me were the heavy hatting of Delehanty and the brilliant fielding of Lipes. The score follows: UNION.

The spring tneet of I--Iatnilton CoHege was held on May 20, and as H:ilnliilton is regarded as Union's strongest rival for the Inter-collegiate tneet on June 5, a cornparison of the records tnade there with ours of the follo,ving day is in- teresting-. The Ioo, 220 and 440 yard dashes will be closely contested although Hamilton's time in each ofthese runs was slightly better -than ours. The thne of the half-mile run has not been made public. I-Iartnagle's tin1e was 2 :16. Wright ran the mile in 5 :03. He and Multet· ought to have no difficulty in winning this event, as Hatnilton's time was 5 :I I. The two hurdle races wiil be close, but at present Hatnilton has the better chance of win- ning both. In tl1e 1nBe 'valk Union ought to finish three n1en before Ilatnilton. Lee's tin1e was 30 seconds slower than Cotton's. The satne ,may be said of the bicycle race : Kelsey's tin1e was 6 :30, Catnpbell's, 5 :46. Hamilton has not published the distance of the high jump but Union should win the run- ning broad jutnp. Robertson's distance was 19 ft. I in. ; Davis', 20 ft. 2 in. In the other three events Hamilton has the advantage,, viz : Pole vault, Cunningham, 9ft.; Sylvester, 8ft. 6 in. Shot put, Cunningham, 34ft. 5 in.; Hoxie, 32 ft. 8 in. Hatnmer throw, Stone, 91 ft. 5 in.; McMillan 82 ft. 8 in. It should be considered, however, that our spring meet was held on a cold raw day with the track in bad condition and that out· inen can certainly n1ake better time than at the meet. Good hard training will be very necessary if we win tl1e meet and the team ought to be ·given every encouragetnent.

THE subscribers to the college publications are again reminded that it is absolutely necessary that the management be provided with sufficient funds to carry on this branch of student effort until the end of the college year. A large number of students have not yet paid their subscriptions. We adjure .those of you who have been ~eglectful of this duty heretofore, to remember us as soon as they receive their June check. DURING the past two weeks the attention of the student body has been centered upon college politics. At the last college meeting an important election was held. We congratulate the student body upon tbe wisdom of their selections upon this occasion. and also wish to compliment the ·various political factions, which had sprung into existence, upon the ·fairness of the campaign ~nd tb.e generous and manly acceptance of the results. Factions in ·college politics .are not always of benefit to the institution. Ill will and lack of interest on the part of one or another of these clicks is apt to be the only laE- ting result. If, however, on]y 1nen of u.nquestioned merit and ability are placed in the field fu:t: college offices the effect upon the college, as a ·whole, would not be bad; and when a fair, honest fight is made, followed by a generous acceptance of the result, no harm is likely to result. Such was the character of the past eiection and the result :points to a most efficient management of ·college affairs in the future. The writer of this article has o bse.rvf\d the recent drift of college politics, ar1d notes that keen interest is at present being taken in class elections and that there is likely to be shaTp :factional fighting. To right .an erroneous impression. v;hich seems to have become current the. statement is here tnad:e that the Quad does not intend to support or to advocate any of its members for college office un- less they have the requisite ability for such office, not,vithstanding any statement to the contrary. And furthermore the Quad is not avers~ to sup- porting for office any student regardless of llis affiliatio:ns ·who has the ability to perform the required duties. This is the spirit which should pervade all college elections. With it stadent affairs will progress, \vithout it they will rapidly become discreditable. FRIDAY Inorning the Seniol' elass completed their tern1 examinations. They are now at liberty until the exercises of co1nmence1nent \Yeek. These ceremonies will begin Sunday, June 20, and will terminate with the Senior ball on Wednesday of that week. A large number of the class will spend their Senior vacation at their home or at the homes of college friends. Some contemplate making a visit to nearby colleges where they will become acquainted with the members of other chapters of their respective fraternities. Some of the unfor- tunate members of the class will remain in Schenectady and finish up some of their college work which they have left undone. The duties of most of these however will not be arduous. The college grounds, the garden, and the beautiful Mohawk make life most enjoyable for those who have the tbne and inclination to enjoy them. The old Duteh town also has its attractions. The Dorpian maiden is not lacking in any of the usual feminine charms and four yea.rs acquaintances is not unlikely to create friendships so ~gree~ble that the few remaining weeks from now until tba last days of June will seem !hort indeed.

In discussing the position of the corporation toward athletics, Dr. Eliot said in part that the n1embers of that body approved of sports, but wanted those which called for brains and tnoral statnina. In this connection he said : \ They would like to ,see the Harvard crew row a good hard race, even though it lost, but they object violently to the sort of processions which they have seen.. * * * ''They like to see a track team do as well in cotnpeti:tion as in practice. Failure to equal the records made in practice seetns to denote some discouraging moral failure under adverse condi- tions.\ He then went on to criticise the continuous cheering at the games. \What is this ' support' of which ·we have heard so much? It is to cheer, to yell, to howl, and to howl the other crowd down.\ * * * \ Such support as is popularly de1nanded does not cultivate the right kind of spirit. I have read for many years about this 'support' of teams. That is just what they ought not to be given. The team ought to do as well at New . Haven as at Cambridge, even if there is not a Harvard man within one hundred tniles at the time.\ Referring to his personal experience in athle- tics, he spoke of the value of physical training to him in his work. He advocated sports in which players do not come in personal contact, such as boating, tennis, hunting ~nd fishing. He spoke a good word for golf and discouraged foot ball. In concluding he spoke in an optimistic vein of college athletics. The lessening of promi- nence given to the financial side of the question, the practice of playing games on college grounds, and, in general, the progress toward a pure1· amateur standard he commended. The Junior class held a meeting after chapel Tuesday a~~ elected Perley P. Sheehan, toast- master. William C. Yates, Orrin G. Cox and Carl Hammer were appointed a committee ot arrangements for a class banquet.

D., '55, as. tnod~rator of the Presbyterian ·General Assen1bly. It seen1s fitting that we should take further notice of one of our most honoured alumni. The story of his life reads like a romance. Born at MinaviUe, not far fron1 Schenectady, he graduated from Union in 1855 and fro1n the Princeton Theological Sen1inary in 1858. After his ordination he was married and preached in Texas and Wisconsin. During a part of the ';ya:r he was a member of the Christian commis- sions in the army hospitals. So far his work had not been extraordinary. assist him and guaranteed their support out of his own means. During this decade Dr. Jack- son traveled over 6oo,ooo 1niles in missionary service, winning people by his sirnplicity and his rough and ready ways. His field was widened to include ,every thin()' frotn Nebraska . b to Nevada and frotn Mexico to Canada. His work in these ten years won him the titles of the \ wild rider of the Sierras,\ and the \Euf- falo Bill of the Presbyterian church.\ About fifteen years ago he was sent to Alaska where a tretnendous task awaitecl hitn. Tl1e government was corrupt, the people were star- ·. ving. It was the work of a sl1:ort titne to reforn1. the for.mer but the latter was a more serious business. But Dr. Jackson i.tnported the Siberian reindeer and induced the Alaskans to raise then1,. thus providing food and means of support. Many of the Alaskans have been con- verted to Christianity and their phys.ical condi- But in 1870 he was appointed superintendent of · missions for Iowa, Nebraska, Montana, Wyo- ming, Dakota and Utah.
