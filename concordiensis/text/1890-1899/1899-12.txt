6 THE OONCORDIENSIS. UNION TO BE A MEMBEQ OF THE INTEQCOLLEGIATE GYMNASTIC ASSOCIATION .. In response to an invitation sent to all the prominent colleges of the country by the under- graduates of Columbia, the first tneeting of the Intercollegiate Amateur Gymnastic· Association of America was held in the Columbia University library on Wednesday, Noven1ber zgth. There were present Messrs. Savage, Amherst; Otis, Yale ; Jenks, Haverford ; A. H. Mitchell, Princeton; Belcher, New York University; W. E. Mitchell, Colun1bia and D. M. Dunning, Jr. of Union. It was decided to give each college one vote, and that the institutions represented at the first meeting should form the association, and other colleges must apply for admission. The following officers were elected : President, Mitchell, of Colun1bia ; vice-president, Otis, Yale ; secretary, Jenks, Haverford ; treasurer, Mitchell, Princeton. A corntnittee composed of the president and Messrs. Otis, Belcher and Dunning vvas appointed to draft a constitution. This committee met on Friday in the quarters of Columbia's football team, 435 West 117th street, New Y ot·k city. The proposed constitution provides in sub- stance as follows: The object of the association is to secure control of gyn1nastics, and to regu- late them throughout the leading colleges of the country. Annual gymnastic meets are to be under the direction of an executive committee, consisting of the president and four others, who shall appoint managers and officials and decide protests. The events to be included are horse, Swedish horse, parallel bars, horizontal bar, tumbling and flying rings. Places are to count the same as in track athletics. rl'he man win- ning the most points is to be called the all 'round intercollegiate gymnast, and the college winning most points will receive a prize. A copy of the constitution will be sent for consideration to all members of the association. After the constitution is adopted, application will be made for admission to the A. A. U. The constitutional comn1ittee will meet again in the early part of January. TEA FROM INDIA. An Alumnus' Gift to the Ladies of the Faculty .. The following letter, which is self explanatory, was recently received by Prof. Landreth from Mr. ]an1es N. Gowenlock, '75, whose warm interest in the college has been manifested from ti tne to titne by various library additions. He was especially interested in the book club on the Hill, and sent the tea spoken of as a gift to its m'embers: Care MESSRS. JERH~ LYON & Co., 4 Lombard Court, Gracechurch St., London. My Dear Landreth :- I am dispatching an Monday, next, to your address, taxes and all other expenses paid, a chest of 79 or 80 pounds of Derjeeling tea for our friends in Schenectady, and as I find it would be difficult for me to distribute it I venture to ask you to kindly undertake that duty and charge me with the cost. It is rather early for the Xmas greetings, but later on the tea season will be over and I might not be able to obtain so good a sample as I hope this to be. We wish each member of the Ladies Book Club to have two pounds, and also send additional pack- ages for the new members. I am glad to see that the Columbia is likely to 'Win the yacht race for I don't like the idea of sport and sentiment being reduced to a huge business advertisement as it seems to be with the owner of the Shamrock. Interest in the race here .has greatly diminished since the outbreak of the war; over which the people, with the exception of a few Irish irreconcilables, are very united in the opinion of their cause and the necessity of a war which this country has done all possible to avoid. It will probably result in the disarmament of the Boers and their independence being reduced to merely a local self-government, and quite right too; as they have shown themselves by :political corruption, injustice, and oppression of aliens, as quite unfit for any form of independence. Mrs. Gowenlock joins with us in sending kind remembrances, and asking your acceptance of a share of the tea with her compliments. With thanks for your assistance which I know will b.e readily granted, I remain, sincerely yonrs, J. N. GOWENLOCK.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 7 LITEQA.~Y NOTES. There is much in December Outing which appeals to college men and all who are inter- ested in amateur sport. There are ten pages of football matter alone, comprising dates, scores, and a concise descripHon of all the important games played in the East, Middle West, and South, finely illustrated. It is just this 1·ecord matter which makes Outing invaluable. It is in the handiest form for reference, and is to be found nowhere else. The Christmas cover of Ev'ry Month is attractive in its sitnple beauty, and the contents carry out the promise of the cover. A novel article on the \Human Side of a Big Departlnent Store,\ profusely illus- trated, is followed by '' Hostesses of a By-Gone Day,\ a description of some celebrated New York women who were the foremost enter- tainers in metropolitan life a generation ago ; \ Forest Giants,\ an account of the famous Redwood Trees of California, illustrated by several special photographs; \Scenes from the Plays of the Month,\ a page of illustrations of the most dramatic situations of the newest plays. The magazine also fut·nishes three short stories. The music, consisting of 4 pieces or I.i- pages, goes beyond the usual in popnlarity and desirability, and comprises \ Lotta, !7, Valse Lente, by Wil- liam Furst, whose \Babble Waltzes\ and intermezzos are known by every musician ; '' In the Shadow of the Rockies,\ a genuinely pathetic ballad; \Jasper Johnson's Jubilee,\ Cake Walk and Two-Step, an irresistably attractive march; and\ Sweet Savannah,\ by Paul Dresser. The Christmas number of The Saturday Evening Post marks a new departure in periodi .. cal literature-the first successful attempt to give for five cents, stories, articles and pictures by the same writers and at'tists who tnake the high-cost magazines. For example, the open- ing story in the Christmas Post is by Rudyard Kipling, and the tale tbat of Private Ortheris and his dog, Garm ; Joel Chandler Harris tells '' Why the Confederacy Failed,\ a stirring story of the Secret Service; .and Ian Maclaren, Justin McCarthy, M. P., John Luther Long, M. E. M. Davis, W. C. Coup and W. S. Harwood co a tribute stories and articles. The verse in the nutnber is by Edwin Markham, Frank L. Stanton, Mary E. vVilkins and Clinton Scollard. Th:e half-tone page heading illustrating Chriit- mas in History, are by Charles Louis Hinton, Frank and Joe Leyendecker, W. S. Lukens, George Gibbs, F. L. Fithian, Mmlen McCon- nell and Harrison Fisher. The handsome colored cover is by Henry H utt. The Christ- mas Post will be on all news-stands Dec. 21.

At the vesper service Sunday in the college chapel Dr. William Elliot Griffis, of Ithaca, and at one time a professor at Union, gave a pleasing address. 'I'he speaker read as the scripture lesson, the fiftieth chapter of Isaiah, taking as his text the verses I o-r I. In opening, Dr. Griffis spoke of higher criticism, especially in its relation to the Bible, as bringing out the charactet·s, works, and epocl1s of the church in a truer light. The Bible is a growth corning down through years of inspiration by different \\<vriters. A little criticism is dangerous as tending toward scepti- cism, but n1uch produces it as a new book The particular lesson of the age of the great prophet, was the suffering servant of Jehovah. A true servant of Jehovah l1as a hard duty, with very little of so-called fame. He has to walk in darkness and through unbeaten paths. So it is with the servant of the people ; he tnust not kindle fire with his own sparks, but must seek God's way, without shirking duty. Men in every age have tried to pictu1·e a time when the world would be free from cares and anxieties ; yet the greater the 'number of inventions for lessening labors and difficulties, the harsher the trials to follow. If one set of difficulties are surmounted another lies itnmediately beyond. 1 ·,,' . c· !.

The def~ats administered to the Gar- net last spring should certainly not be the cause of discouragement for the future. IN THIS, the last number of the term', the editors wish to call attention to the new rule whereby literary matter for The Concordiensis may be accepted as a substitute for regular essays and orations. During the fall term several students · have taken advantage of the privilege, and in every case the arrangement has worked very satisfactorily. In the winter term the plan is optional to every student in college and it is to be hoped that many will avail themselves of the oppor- CONCORDIENSIS, Single Copies, $2.00 per Year, in Advance tunity offered.

Entered at the Post-office at Schenectady, N. Y., as second- class rna tter. Chas. Burrows, Printer, 414 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. NEXT WEEK being examination week, there will, as usual, be no issue of The Concordiensis. A MEETING of those interested in chess was called in the chapel last week and plans for the formation of a club were discussed. No definite action was taken, but it was decided to try to arouse interest among the students and then to hold a meeting and elect officers. Many colleges already have chess clubs and their teams compete in tournaments for the intercollegiate champion- ship. It is a standard game and there ought to be enough students interested in it to warrant the forming of a club at Union. WE ADMIT that it is rather late to soliloquise upon the omission of the annual fall track meet, yet it seems to us that there has been neglect of duty in regard to this matter. These meets in the past have been the means of bringing out valuable freshman tnaterial, and we do not see how those in IT rs TO be regretted that the class football championship has not been decided. In the early part of the season there was much entl1usiastn dis- played over the interclass games and several ~on­ tests were held. But two of these resulted in a tie and the only decisive game was that between the sophomores and the freshmen. Since then, no games have been played and the fault seems to lie not with the teams but the management. It is the duty of the various class managers to get together and arrange a schedule of gatnes which should be duly published. Then, if, at the appointed time either team does not put in an appearance the game should be declared forfeited to the opposing ' class. There remains now but little more than a week before the end of the term, but there is no reason why during this time the series should not be finished. Interclass games are still being played at other colleges, and here on our own campus there has been waged many a contest when the gridiron was covered with snow.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 THE FII{ST ECLIPSE. His Highness, the sun, rose early one morn, Now and then he took such a notion, And peeped a look Cl;f his royal self In his looking glass, the ocean. And he saw with pleasure his jolly face~ And he laughed in boisterous glee, While o'er his road he passed along With none for company. His pale-faced spouse set after her lord As he disappeared over the line, And she gazed with delight as her figure she saw In the ocean's '' deepy brine. '' But he laughed at her as he saw her come, For, like a heartless knave, He never cared what pain he caused Or what distress he gave. But for all that, he loved his spouse Till on ~a fateful day As smiFng, looked he in his glass, She stood before his way. And then he swore that by his side No more his bride should be; And so they go their way about, And soon as each they see, They haste to hide themselves in hate And find a refuge out of sight, The one from darkness seeking day, The other seeking night. -A. H. KESSLER, 1903. '95.-Frederick M. Eames of Albany has been appointed an examiner in the department of the civil service comtnission at a salary of $r ,zoo. Mr. Eames graduated frotn the Civil Engineer-- ing department of Union with a Sign1a Xi key·. After graduation he taught for a year in the York Collegiate Institute at York, Pa., and then can1e back to LTnion for a year's work in mathe- matics, physics an_rl tnodern languages. From Union he went to Harvard, where he special- ized in physics and tnathetnatics, receiving the degree of A.M. in 'g8. Last year Mr. Eames served as a teacher of mathetnatics and science in the Franklin Academy at Malone, N. Y. A NEW FQAT'EQNITY. Phi Delta Phi Reestablished at the Albany Law School. A new fraternity, Phi Delta Phi, has been organized at the Albany Law School. The chap- ter house is located at No. 135 Jay Street. The new rne,mbers of the fraternity are : J. Ralph Hilton, 1900, Yale '97, of Newburgh; Walter R. Heriick, 1900, Princeton '98, of Albany ; Samuel G.. H. Turner; rgoo, Union '98, of Eltnira; H. Bradley Carroll, 1901, Rochester '99, of Rochester; Charles J. Herrick, 1901, Yale ~99, of Albany; James V. Coffee, 1901, of Troy ; William H. Hurley, 1900, of Seneca Falls ; E. B. Partridge, 1901, Hobart '99, of Phelps ; John V. Whitbeck, 1901, of Hudson; Clarence Cormant, 1901, Yale '99, of ·Carnden, and H. Edward Machold, 1901, of Amsterdatn. Phi Delta Phi is a purely legal fraternity. It was founded at the University of Michigan in 1869. The chapters are all named after some prominent figure in legal history. The present chapter is a reinstitution of the Jay chapter established in 1884. The custom of the fraternity is not to antagonize the existing social or literary societies in the law schools or universities it enters, and its policy in regard to extending its chapter list is conservative. It adtnits members of all college fraternities and the majority of its chapters have been formed by their aid. 'fhe fratern1ty is only notninally secret. ''American College Fraternities\ says that \The character of its rnetnbership is very high and its tnembers are fast taking prominent positions in public life.\ '97.-.
