THE CONCORD,IENSIS. ======-~ A CHANGE IN THE PRESIDE·NCY. TilE RESIGNATION OF DR. WEBSTER FINALLY ! Rayn1ond, pastor of the Fourth Presbyterian church, of Albany, \Vas unanitnously elected President of Union. ACCEPTED. \ I i D.r. A. V. V. Raymond Unanimously Chosen by the \,\. Trustees to Succeed Dr. Webster. The board of trustees of Union College at their semi-annual meeting held at the Medi- cal College in Albany, Tuesday afternoon, accepted the resignation of President Harri- son E. Webster. The resignation presented by Dr. Webster a year ago on account of poor health was not then accepted by the board in the hope that the president ·would recover, but the fact becoming apparent that he could no longer do hirnself or the college justice the resignation was a·ccepted. Dr. Raymond entered Union College in 1872 and graduated in 1875, taking very high honors. He \vas elected a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, and is a n1ember of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. In I 885 he received the degree of D. D. After leaving Union he pursued a theological course at N·ew Brunswick, N. J., and in 1878 \vas ordained to :the n1inistry. In 1887 he was called to the pastorate of the Fourth Presbyterian church in Albany, to succeed the late D·r. flenry The trustees showed their appreciation of the services of Dr. Webster by the unan itnous adoption of the following resolution : ''The board of trustees in accepting the resignation of Dr. Harrison E. \Vebster, as President of Union College, desire to express their appreciation of the ability with vvhich he I has conducted its affairs and the success which has attended his efforts. \During his administration the nutnber of students has been more than trebled, new life has been infused into all the departrnents of instruction and the interest of the alun1ni in \ their Alma Mater has been greatly revived. j' The curriculun1 has been revised and ex- tended. The college buildings have been put ! in repair-- by moneys raised by hi n1. The I college has been singularly free fron1 disorder; \ the utmost harmony has prevailed in the faculty, and tl1e relations of the college with 1 the Board of Control have been n1arked by I entire unity of plan and purpose. \The board extend to Dr. Webster' their ! best wishes for his restoration to perfect health, and his success in any pest of duty to which he may be called.\ The choice of a successor for Dr. Webster was made in1mediately, and Dr. A. V. V. 1 Darling. Dr. Raymond has always been interested in the \velfare and advancernent of his ~.L\.lrna Mater, and for the last four years has been the President of the General Alumni Association. Ile is an enthusiastic and energetic worker in anything he undertakes. His sern1ons are of the highest order, and he is noted as a ready and brilliant after dinner speaker~ Dr. Rayn1~nd is one of the youngest men ever called to the presidency of a college, being only 39 years of age. He is very popular· with the alun1ni and undergraduates, and will be heartily \vel corned by all who have at heart the interests of Old Union. AN ANCIENT VOLUME. Prof. Mosher has handed to THE CONCOR- DIENSIS for inspection an ancient and honor- able volutne, published in France in 1820. The work is en~itled, Description Statisq ue, Historique et Politique Des Etats- Unis De L' Arneriq ue Septentrionale, and was \Vritten in the French language by D. B. Warden, American Consul to Paris. The volume was found in Paris \vhile Prof. Mosher \Vas there as a student, and contains an extended gco- graphi cal, historical and political description of several states, an1ong which is New York.

Alonzo B. \'r Cornell in the college c11apel, January 19th. I-I e took as his subject the electro-magnetic telegraph, \vith \vhich he has had. life long experience. Gov. Cornell was introduced by Robert C. Alexander, of the board of trustees, and spoke for over an hour, holding the closest attention of the students : In his introduction Mr. Cornell referred to the fact that he has been for three years a trustee of Union during his incumbency of the Governor's chair. He also recalled the fact that nearly half a century be- fore, his father, Ezra Cornell, and the father of Gen. Butterfield were ·actively associated in constructing through the Mohawk valley the first line of telegraph established between New York and Buffalo. Mr. Cornell traced the evolution of the magnetic tele- graph fron1 the earliest rude exper-iments of Ben Franklin, in 1746, w·hen the identity of lightning with electricity was first established, to the electro-mag- net of Prof. Joseph Henry, in 1828, and to the more practical demonstrations and experiments of S. F. B. Jviorse in 1837. He dwelt upon the difficulties experi- enced in inducing congress to assist in exploiting the strange invention, and the discouragements encount- ered in building the first line, between Washington and Baltimore, in 1844, by which the practical utility of the telegraph was definitely established. There were still, however, said Gov. Cornell, many unbelievers. The proprietor of the largest New York paper refused to join the other papers in re- ceiving the Governor's message by telegraph from Albany, and was so badly beaten by his riv81S that thereafter his paper became one of the tnost generous patrons of the telegraph. In 1846 the wire was brought to the west bank of the Hudson, but there tne:t an impassable barrier, for no method of insula- tion frotn water had yet been devised. Finally, high n1asts were rigged on the Palisades near Fort Lee, and on Washington Heights on the other side, and a wire suspended betwe-en them. Then catne the era of local telegraph companies, with their rivalries, their extravagance, and their eventual bankruptcy followed by their consolidation and extension under the genius of the promoters of the Western Union Telegraph company, which has now 39o,ooo miles of pole lines and cables, with 770,- QDO- miles of wire in use. It has 21 ,ooo telegraph offices, with 4o,ooo etnployees, transmitted last year nearly 70!ooo,ooo messages, and earned last year $25 ,ooo,ooo. Gov. Cornell dwelt also upon the history of sub- ' marine telegraphy and its great success, of the utili- zation of the telegraph in times of war, in the bank- ing and newspaper business, in the operation of rail ways, in diplomacy, aJld in every-day affairs. He spoke of the value of the telegraph service as an educating medium, requiring as it does, the ut- most care and precision and inevitably fitting the cotnpetent operators for promotion to important and responsible duties. 1 ' •We are yet,\ said he, \in the infancy of electrical inquiry, and the development of the study of electri- city in our colleges and universities within recent years is one of the most remarkable phases oi 1nodern education. Hosts of bright young men and women are devoting thetnselves to investigation in this ex- tremely interesting science, and there can be no doubt that the early future has in store for us wonder- ful results.'' Gov. Cornell closed with an eloquent eulogy of the three great Americans who have led the world in the pathway of electrical science, Franklin, Henry, ahd Morse. He was heartily applauded when he closed, and as he left the chapel to take his train he \vas greeted with the vociferous Union yell. THE students should patronize those \vho advertise in our colun1ns.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. ~::....:=:===--- ------\-----=-.:-:-~·--:_~-_ ~-:··:------- --- . 'HARRY E. S·P.RAGUE. Since our last issue the college has been called upon to n1onrn the loss of one of its 1 m0st promising students. Harry E. Sprague, of the Sophornore class, was taken ill \Vith typhoid fever during the holidays, and after a severe sickness of about three weeks, died at his home in An1ster- dam, on January eighteenth. Mr. Sprague was president of his class during the Fresh· .man year, and one of its n1ost active metn- bers. He \vas a n1en1ber of the Chi Psi fraternity, a fine scholar, and, as a n1an, kind but firm, and exet11plary in his character. The following fron1 Prof. Truax, expresses the general sentiment of both the faculty and students: \When I returned to college at the begin- ning of this term, I was surprised not to find Mr. Sprague in his place, and greatly pained to learn that he was very ill. He \vas so faithful and earnest that I felt confident he -vvould appear at the earliest n1o1nent he could escape from the hands of the physician, and not anticipating any fatal turn in his illness, J reserved his seat. Close upon this can1e the news of his death. The shock to tne was very great, and the sense of personal loss keen. For although I met hin1 only in the class- co om, I was itn pressed by the excellence afternoon, January twentieth, at the hotne of his parents, in Arnsterdam, and were largely attended, the .rnembers of his fraternity and many of his classn1ates being present.

It is going to be a success. There is no doubt about it. Rev. Charles D. Nott, grandson of Dr. Eliphalet Nott, at one tin1e president of Union College, lectured in the chapel Tues- day afternoon at 2:30 o'clock. Subject: \Suc- cess in Life.\ The lecture occurred at an hour too late to be published in this issue of Much sorrow was manifested by the under- graduates when they learned that the resigna- tion .of Doctor Harrison E. Webster, tendered to the board of trustees about a year ago, had been accepted and a successor elected by that body. The resignation presented by Doctor Webster, on account of ill health, was not then accepted in the hope that the presider.t would recover. He was also given a vacation, ·which he spent in the south, from \vhich he returned somewhat recuperated shortly before the last cornn1encen1eBt. With the progress of the present college year and the strain of its exacting demands Doctor Webster found that he could no longer do himself or the college justice, consequently the resig,nation vvas accepted. When about five years ago the trustees of U nionr. College were in need of a man to place at the head of the coHege \vho could lift it frorn its then unpromising condition and secure for it more than its for,mer prestige they called to the presidency Harrison E. Webster of the class of '68. Their expectations were an1ply verified in the etninent capability of the man selected. Doctor Webster immediately set about his new duties with his accuston1ed vigor, and the result of his labor very soon tnanifested itself in the rapid advance of the college in the nutnber of its students and the renewed interest of its alumni and friends. The Doctor has worked ·with untiring energy for the interest of the college and has, by his personal n1agnetism and inspiring addresses before public gatherings, drawn to the college increased numbers of young men seeking ad- vanced educational facilities. During his ad- ministration the curriculum has been revised and extended ; the number of students has been trebled; the departments of instruction enlarged, and the buildings put in repair.

Thy once bright face I scarcely kne,v. Where has thy bean1ing visage flown ? Thy red cheeks that have pallid grown ? Thine eyes so dull, that once so bright, Shone like faiir beacons on the night? Thy noble form was erst thy pride, Now bowed, as though the fates deride. l-Ias son1e fair datnsel wrung thy heart ? Or torn herself from thee apart? l--Ias a~l the world proved false to thee, And friends deserted \vnHngly? Do dire forbodings 'round thee soar ? Does adverse fortune haunt thy door?
