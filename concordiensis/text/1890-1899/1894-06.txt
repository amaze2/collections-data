? THE ·CoNco~DIENSIS. VoL. XVII. UNION COLLEGE, JUNE zo, 1894. No. 16. PROFESSOR HENBY WHITEHORNE, Lt. D. Not the least of the events of the year just closing was the resignation of the Dean of the Faculty, Dr. Whitehornc. For eight years- two college generations-he has held that · office, much of the titne acting as President of the college. During that period he has come into very close relations with all the • students of the college. I~ very year his kind- ness to then1 has increased,· and every year they have regarded hin1 with nevv respect and affection. 1-Iis resignation was a surprise and a disa ppoi.nttnent, a personal grief to every student, for all are debtors to his kindness. Dr. Whitehorne was graduated at Wadhatn college, Oxford, in 1837, and can1e to this country in 1841, after a short stay in Canada. After teaching for five years in Brooklyn, N. Y., he took charge of St. Thon1as Hall, a · school of the Erotestant Episcopal church in Holly Springs, Miss. In 1854, he became Professor of Greek in the University of Missis- sippi, at Oxford, Miss., where the late Dr. F. A. P. Bc:unard, of Colun1bia college, \vas the President. There he ren1ained for seven years, when his vvork was brought to an end by the breaking out of the Civil War, \Yhich caused hin1 to leave the South in October, I 86r. He \Vas an Englishman, and was vvarn1ly attached to his southern hon1e, but when the choice had to be n1ade, he cast in his lot \vith the people of the North. 1'o cross the rebel lines, it \Vas necessary to obtain permission from the Confederate authorities. So Dr. Whitehorne \Vent to Richn1ond, and tnade application to Jefferson Davis, \vhon1 he had known in Mississippi. As he was about to enter Mr. Davis's office, he rnet President Barnard coming out, who told hin1 he had just asked for, and been re- fused, a sin1ilar pern1ission. Those who know Dr. Whitehorne will readily believe that if he was cast down, he \Vas not disn1ayed. He entered, n1ade known his request, and, to his surprise, was received very graciously. Men- tion \vas tnade of Dr. Barnard, and Davis said : \ I kno\V old Barnard ; \Ve can't trust him, but I think \Ve .can trust you.\ T'hen he urged the Professor to becon1e a Confederate agent in England, making him the most liberal offers if he would consent to return hotne and use his influence in his native land in behalf of the Confederacy. The Professor asked for tirr1e to consider the proposal, and Mr. Davis, eager to befriend an Englishtnan and to gain English support, gave the tn uch desired pern1ission to pass out of the Confederate lines. When the Professor \Vas safe in N e\v York, he gave no more thought to Mr. Davis's offer. Perhaps he ~ound ~hat l:e had exhausted all his diplon1acy 1n getting h1s pass. Mr. Davis, no doubt, was acting for his own advantage ; but Union tnen every\vhere will have a kindly thought for Jefferson Davis, because of a kind deed done to Dr. White- horne in a very trying hour. And it was very characteristic of our sturdy old Englishn1an, Southerner as he \Vas by long residence, to refuse to becorne rich by espousing a cause that he could not believe right. Professor Whitehorne ren1aincd in N evv York until r 863, when he became Principal of the Union Classical Institute, in Schenec- tady. After five years of very valuable ser- vice there, he \Vas elected Professor of Greek in Union college. In I 886, he was n1ade Dean of the college, and the next year was granted the degree of LL.D. In 1891, he was elected Presid~nt of the Union chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa society, which office . he still holds, During the past \Vinter he detennined to retire fron1 the office of Dean, and his resignation \Vas announced at the beginning of this term. He still holds the chair of Greek, and docs his \Vork vvith all his old-titne earnestness and thoroughness. Alumni of former years, however, \vill be pained to learn that the chalk-n1ark has dis- appeared from his floor, and that Freshmen are allowed to sit ·while they read. But he shows no other sign of. \Veakness. All who have been in Dr. \iVhitehorne's room kno·w his wonderful success as a teacher. I-Iis ~uccess as Dean of the college has been no less marked. I-I is direct and positive \Vays, his frankness and plainness of speech, his per- fect integrity and sincerity have always n1ade ' I

Those who still ovve their subscriptions for · the present volume of THE CONCORDIENSIS will confer a great favor on the editors if they pay said subscription at once. We need the money in order to close up our accounts and leave the credit of THE CONCORDIENSIS good for the succeeding board of editors. Well, we have won another pennant and this is becoming so common at Union that it docs not arouse the enthusiasm which such an event did in former years. 'The fact that ·winning pennants at Union is no longer an unusual occurrence does not, however, in the least detract from the credit which is due our base ball team and its manager and captain for the excellent vvork they have done the past season. The tcatn in many respects has been the best that ever played ball for Union. \iVith this issue of TI-iE CONCORDI£NSIS the senior editor and business n1anager step down and out, and the ne\v board will begin its duties :with the commencen1ent number. This volurne of TIIE CONCORDIENSIS has had the distinction of containing the accounts of some of the greatest victories ever scored by Union teams. Pennants in foot-ball, track athletics and base ball have been \von and THE (ONCORDIENSIS has endeavored to present to its readers in attractive style these victories and to keep up with the rapid advance ·which the college has been making during the past year. If the compliments which we have received from journalists, alumni, faculty, undergraduates and friends are merited, \Ve have been successful. We have given our subscribers more inserts and cuts than any previous volume, striving in this \\ 7 ay to make more in1pressive the pronli- nent events of the year. The use of these cuts has in son1e cases caused delays vvhich we hope have been pardoned. In conclusion we vvish to thank the students and alumni for ·their support and all those \vho have so kindly aided us with literary material. CONCORDIENSIS APPOINTMENTS.

KILPATRICK WINS AGAIN. On Saturday, June 9, on Travers Island were held the fifty-second annual gatnes of the N e\v York athletic club. Union's famous runner, I<ilpatrick,. recently joined the New York athletic club and \Vore the club colors at the recent contests. l(ilpatrick won easily the mile and half mile events. Being handi- capped in the rn ile he \von \vith such n1en as Morgan, Walsh and Jarvis as cot11petitors. The Ncrzv York Thnes says the foUo,ving con- cerning the chan1pion of Union: ''Kilpatrick bids fair to make his n1ark as a middle-distance runner. f-Ie is tall and slender, runs with good judgn1ent., has an enorn1ous stride and appears to cover ground vvith little effort. On the track he resembles Walter G. George, the great English runner, but his style is prettier than that of the pro- fessional. Kilpatrick is only nineteen years old, and with good handling he ought to keep on ilnproving. He is a great repeater. In one set of gatnes thisyear he vvon the quarter in 0.:5 I Yz, the half in 2:07, the mile in 4:39, and ran third in the 22o.,.yard dash. At the N e-vv York State intercollegiate meeting he was second in the quarter, first in the half, and first in the n1ile. At Berkeley Oval, in the intercollegiate gatnes, he easily won the half-n1ile from Woodhlllll of Yale. In l(il- patrick the N e\v York club has a man who \vill carry its colors to the front on many occasions.\ The base bQll tean1 has Leen photographed. The prizes \Von at S yracusc have been on exhibition at fi ulberts. Prof. T. W. Wright took the Juniors through the Edison works last Thursday.
