The association entertained crowded , houses and was received , with enthusiasm all along the route and many an alumnus felt his heart thrill with increased love for Alma Mater, while listening to the typical college progtam rendered by Union's . . mus1c1ans. Nearly 30 members of the club left Schenec- · tady Thursday afternoon and a large and en- thusiastic audience greeted the first. appearance · of the trip at Coxsackie. The Second Reformed · church of that place was filled to the doors, and the large audience by their frequent applause showed their appreciation of the music. Newburgh was visited for the third time on Friday. A good-sized audience attended the concert which was given in Trinity church. Long-continued applause followed every number and the clubs were recalled many· times. The prestige which Union College Musical associa- tion has at Newburgh was shown by the fact that, before the evening was over, Assistant Mati.ager Van Vlack had made an engagement ' for a return trip next year. All of the New- burgh dailies contained complimentary notices . of the concert. The members of the clubs were well enter- tained after the perfonnance. Some went to a \ chowder,\ where H Weedy\ distinguished himself as a song and dance artist ; some visited the various clubs of the city and others attended several dances that were being held. While in N ewhurgh the collegians stopped at the P-alatine. At New York the boys were entertained at Hotel Savoy and· wete. given a tally-ho ride throughout the length of Fifth avenue,. For this and many other acts of liberality the association · is indebted to Mr. Gilbert K. Harroun, the treasurer of the coHege . The trip closed Saturday night with the, New York concert, which was held in ·Carnegie Lyceum. Every seat was taken and standing room was at a pre:mium. The alumni of the great metropolis and its suburbs were out in fuH force and accorded the clubs a hearty t•eception. From a mus~ical as ~rell as a financial stand- point, the New York concert wa~ one of the · most successful ever given by the Union College Musical association. The mandolin club was much better and stronger than ever before, under the leadership of Clayton J. Heermance, r9o:r. Clarence D. Stewart, 1900, proved, as usual, the effi.~cient director of the banJo club, and Frederick Greene, '99, was in charge of the glee club. Among .the features of the New York concert was an effect- ive medley from'\ The Runavvay Girl,\ arranged by Harold J. Hinman, '99, who assumed charge of the Mandolin club while the piece was being played. A new Union song entitled, '' Rah! Rah ! Rah ! \ which was cotnposed by Dr. Joseph Alen O'Neill, '97, of New York, was sung by the glee club and '' The Trolley Pat·ty\ by the instrumentalists proved a favorite. Strictly college songs predotninated among the vocal selections. At the close of the concert aU of the \Sons of Old Union \ present, old, yo11ng and middle- aged, gathered on the stage and joined with ea- thusiasm in the singing of Ludlow's inspiring melody which has for so many years been dear to all who have lived within the shadows of the old, gray walls. For the success of the concert, the under- graduates are greatly indebted to the loyal al 1 Umni of the city and especially to Professor E~gar S. Barney, the genial secretary of the New York alumni association, through whose especial efforts the concert was made so great a success.

The first championship game of the season occurred on the campus, Wednesday afternoon, between Union and 'Colgate. The crowd was smaH, but the enthusiasm was intense, and it was in part due to the fi-equent yells of the students that\ the result vvas. favorable for Union. The game was loosely played, a large number of errors being cred i:ted to both sides. Union started in with som.e lively hitting and filled the bases. The ball was hit freely, but well guarded by Colgate. Hegeman was hit by pitched ball,. and the first run was credited to Union. Col- gate also secured one run in this inning. In the next, neither side managed to score. Colgate seemed sure of sending a man over the plate, but a neat doub1.e play by Lawton to Purchase to Hegeman, kept down the score. In the third and fourth ·Colgate secured three more runs, making the score 4 to I. The fifth inning 'brought in three runs for Union. With two men on bases, Lawton put · the ball over the terrace for a home run. Col- gate, however, took advantage of a run of errors in this inning and addedfour runs to their credit. Score, 8 to 4· In the eighth inning Union started in to change the seemingly .alrnost inevitable result, but with timely batting they m~naged .to pile up six more runs. Colgate went to pieces with their pitcher and to the end of the game Edwards had them at his mercy. The game closed with the score 10 to 8 in Union's favor. The score in detail : UNION. A.B. R. lB.

One of the .most useful additions to the lihrary -that has been made for some Hm.e is the set of · the Annual Literary Index for 1896, 1897~and 1898. Each vol. contains an index to periodicals, index to general literature, author index, biblio- graphies, necrology of writers and index .:to dates of principal events. The latter practically serves as an index to the files of any newspaper. The Index to General Literature and Author Index for 1898 contains title entries to '' The Library of the World's Best Literature,\ edited by Chas. Dudley Warner, issued at intervals during 1896-98. The annual entertainment and dance of Jhe Theta Sigma society of U. C. I. was held in Arcade hall last Friday evening and a most en- joyable time was had by the large number of young people present. The entertainment, consisting of recitations and a farce was held first, after which the seats were removed and dancing enjoyed until the small hours of the morning. A large number of college men were present among whom were : From the class of '99, Beardsley, Bradford, Davis, Purchase, Huntley, Sherwood, Strong, F. T. Wright; from 1900, Featherstonhaugh, Dunham, Lawton, Cullings, Paige, Rogers, Thomson, Willis, Brownell, Palmer and Ripley; from 1901, Clements, Golden, Hackett, Leavenworth, Merriman and Warner ; frotn 1902, Bothwell, Hawkes, Morss, Russum, Ostrander, Yates, Griffith and Wool- worth.

The :baseball season out of town was inaugur- ated last Saturday with a victory over the West Point cadets on their own grounds. The gam:e . was a good one to win and the team is to be · congratulated over the victory. Accompanied by Manager Gambee, and two substitutes the nine left Saturday -n1ornin;g on the 8 : 18 train. Arriving at West Point they were cordially received and as cordially treated during their entire stay. After dinner and before the game there was a review in full marching order of all the cadets, a sight well worth witnessing. The two tea~ms were evenly rna tched, but al- though Union n1ade only four hits and six .errors to the cadets' nine hits and four errors the collegians scored six runs to their opponents three. Union fielded well as also did West Point, but the team work of the former was better than the cadets'. Several times during ~he game a hit was all that was needed to raise · the cadets' score, but lack of ability to hit at the proper time lost them the game. Cook was be- hind the bat for Union and he played an error- less game. The rest of the team played uni- fonn ily good ball. The score in detail follows : UNION. A.B. R. l:B. P.O. A. E.

Reher- sals have been 'in progress for the past two months, and 'from· present in.dications a hrgh.:class, burnt cork entertainment may be expected. The musical abilities of the college boys are well-known, and, with the musical part of the entertainment under the direction of Prof. Rosf, the success of the pro- ject is assured. The tickets have been put on sale, and. everyone should see that the sho·w is well advertised, and that· all of his frie.nds have tickets. The motive which prompted the a:ffair is a com- m~ndable one, and since the proceeds will go into ' . . athietic fund, every. student should do all he can to make tl\e show a financial success. Those who . . have part~ ar~ working .{~ithfully, so that a good . ' . performance may be.given, an~ it is no more than fair that those, who have not the talent to do an act, should take hold and secure a good attendance. ON\CE MORE We call the attention· of the alumni to their unpaid subscriptions. The editors cannot run the paper on air, and it is· necessary that the out-standing subscriptions should be sent in imme- cliately. The better the support given by the alumni, the better paper the editors are able to publish. Our subscription lists contain the names of alumni well able to pay, but they do not seem ·to care enough for the college paper to give· it , their support. This is not loyalty to .Alma Mater by a ' . long shot. Kindly send your check by return mail .. WE ARE glad to see ''the copper''~ once more on the hill. He is a very necessary part of the college, and ·knows how to uphold the majesty of the law in a kindly but firm manner. We do not mean 'to;in- fer that a college policeman is necessary to k~ep order among the students, but rather that one is needed for the protection of them and of college property. There is a certain element who make themsel.ves mora or less a nuisance; they are always looking for trouble, or at least falling into it, and the services of a policeman are needed to keep this class at a distance. THE PRACTICE of the last two we.ek has dotle much for the baseball teatn, but there is still a. chance for improvement. We have been fortunate enougb to win the last two games although the team made many more errors than their opponents. The game with Colgate was very exciting, but it was not the most scientiflc game of baseball. that has been played on the'college campus. The game was one of those in which no one could te11 just what was likely to happen next. The· best· work was done in the last part of the game, and the team g-enerally deserves a great deal of credit, especially the battery. The rooting throughout the· game was strong· and enthusi~$tic, and it ·did a great deal towards; keeprng up the ·spirit ,of the players at the most critical moments. Let not the enthusiasm diminish until the season is over. j sic Co an of St El A . It; Hi s( H. T~ ·G. th 81 Fe S(; G D A '' F T E v E B Si n F ,, v f a ( c ; c ( (

An innovation in connection with the Harvard- Yale boat race has been announced in the way of a four-oared race between the substitutes of the two crews. This race will probably be rowed on a two-mile course after the university race and before the freshtnan race. Several members of the Yale faculty are reported as considering the advisability of intro- ducing team golf matches next year between faculty teams of the leading eastern colleges. The plan has been tried successfully by the faculties of several Scotch colleges.

The sucoessful interscholastic athletic meet given at the driving park last year under Union's auspices is to be duplicated next Saturday by one which the management hopes will he even better. The decided interest taken in it by the preparatory schools, the large number of entries ah-eady received, and the strenuous efforts of , those in charge to make the affair a success, all prophesy a happy termination. Already acceptances to the invitations sent out some time ago have been received from nineteen schools and it is not unlikely · that several more will shortly arrive. These accept- ances include the names of a number of the crack school athletes of eastern New York, and at present a list of one hundred and thirty one sepat·ate entries. The com petition ~ill nu- doubtedly be more severe than last year as the large New York city schools, that carried off most of the prizes last year will be engaged in a meet of their own at that time. The general program for the meet will be the same as that of last vear. Suitable entertain- ~ . ment will be provided for all. The visiting m~en will be accotnmodated at the various fraternity houses so far as possible, but all will be cared for. The n1eet will be run off promptly as a time schedule for the events has been arranged. In the evening an informal meeting will be held in the gymnasiun1, at which several short addresses will be made, the banner and prizes distdbuted, and light refreshments served. Altogether a cordial welcome will be extended by Old Union and everything possible wiU be done to give the visitors a \ royal good time.\ The schools entered are as follows : Saugerties high school, Catskill high school Clarerack institute, Cambridge high school, Cooperstown high school, Johnstown high school, Troy high school, Egbert high school, Amsterdam high school, Rex's preparatory 1chool of Utica, Troy academy, Troy conference academy, Rutland English classical institute, Utica free acaden1y, Troy business college, Union Classical institute, Albany high school, N. Y. State Nonnal high school, and Fott Edward high school. 1. All is over, all is over: College days are o'er. Soon we'll pass beyond the blue gate, U ndergra:ds no more. We must leave thee, dear old Union, Though our hearts repine, For no otl1er class e'er loved thee More than 111inety-nine. CHORUS. Lift your voices then old classmates; Bid a fond farewell, To our grand old Alma. Mater, That we love so well. 2. We have won the longed for honors, Graciously bestowed, For our zeal in seeking knowledge In this fatned abode. Wear we now a wreath of laurel, Happy fellows we; But we'll miss thee, dear old Union, When we're far from thee.-CHORUS. 3. Soon we'll say our last farewells, and With a parting clasp, We will join our hands together In a lingering grasp. Should this be our final parting, Brother, fare thee well; Take thee up the white man's burden, And thy grief dispel. -CHORUS. 4. Whitey old, and Uncle Billy, Loyal friends and true ; Perk and Ashy, Nance and Hoffy,- Long 1i ve all of you- Rip and Jimmie, Stoll and Tomtny, Pep and Pross and Pop, Opy, Spike, two Johns, and Freddie, And with Prexy stop- CHORUS. While we sing the chorus stronger In a fond farewell To our dear old Alma Mater, That we iove so well. GEO. C. ROWELL, '9'9~

Burrows, .Printer, 4:1:4 State Street, Schenectady, 1(. Y. Don't fail to attend the Williams-Union Meet at Ridgefield, .Albany, this afternoon. Every man in college ought to go. Train leaves for Albany at 1:33 p. m. WE no NOT believe the Hamilton team respons- ible for the itern which appeared in a Utica paper concerning their defeat at Union. Such a declara- tion, coming from them, would seen1 to be very unsportsmanlike, and in justice to Mr. Carver we refute the alleg-ation. A close observer of the game could not fail to see that Hamilton was defeated fairly. THOSE WHO witnessed the Hamilton-Union base- ball game last Saturday, could not fail to observe the marked im:provement in Union's playing over that of the preceeding games. Every man on the team was at his best, and Union won by superior work. If the tearn only plays as well in the game with Hobart today, we need not feel very anxious ' about the result. Let every man in college come out this morning and ·cheer the team on to victory. Remember what good rooting has done in the past. We need all that can be had all day long~ WE WISH to urge upon the students the necessity of an immediate paytnent of their baseball sub- scriptions. The schedule cannot be carried out as intended unless the money is paid in, and every man in college who has n.ot paid his subscription is in ~duty bound to .neet this obligation as soon as possible. The class collectors should make a thorough canvass of their classes, and every man should make it a point to look up the class collec- tor. In this way there will be saved a :g-reat deal of unnecessary delay. This also applies to the subscriptions for track athletics. There are many expenses incidental te the meets, and cash is needed badly at the present time. We know the students are anxious for the success of the college teams, and we know that they will give their hearty support when the necessity of prompt action is made clear. NEXT WEEK Saturday is the day of the Inter- scholastic meet. It is necessary that everybody should lend a hand at that time and give the visitors a pleasant time while they are with us. It would be a good idea to have a campus meeting the same evening, so that the boys can see some Union enthusiasm when it is bubbling over. There are any number of ways of entertaining the visi- tors, but of what ever sort it may be, it should be of a general college nature, so that the high school boys may feel that they are being entertained by the college. It will a waken new thoughts within them, after they have listened to the college songs and a few of those speeches given by members of the faculty, that are peculiarly characteristic of the campus meetings. Furthermore, the students should attend the meet and make the affair as enthusiastic as possible. ~Good cheering- and good singing will help to make the meet a lively one. Union, in taking up this idea of interscholastic meets, wishes to get the high schools interested in athletics. Therefore we must do all we can to show our enthusiasm, excite competition, and make a good impression.

as ion as a eal the is the ege ter- ody the us. be by of of in to JiamHtoQ ·was Easy. Un,ion,s chances for the baseball pennant this year we:re greatly strengthened, when on Satur- . day last, Hamilton was defeated. Only one · :error was made by Union and the iteam work ·was a v:ast improvement ove:r that in the ·Colgate . :game. There was a good sized crowd present which gave vent to its enthusiasm wid1 frequent Union songs and yells. In the first inning both :Sides failed to score. By a series of errors in the next Grout crossed the plate for Union's first run and was £ollowed by Smith . In the third inning no scoring wa·s done, but in the ne:x:t J. Millham scored Hamilton's first run. In the sixth French knocked a long fly into left field. The ball was blocked and he scored another run for Union before the sphere was returned to the box. This inning ended with the score 3 to I. In the seventh Baker was injured by Cook stealing second, but he was a~le to cont'in~e the game and Union's score was ra1sed .to 5 on s:~!lgles by Purchase and Lawton, and 1n the • etghth with the bases full, Grout was forced tn and Hamilton in their half added two to their score. Good batting by Union and errors by Hamil- ton in the ninth sent eight men across the plate for the Garnet while the best Hamilton could do was to go out in one, two, three order.

THE :{)ONCORDtENSfS. Last Wednesday evening the first cam~pus meeting of the spring term was held near Memorial Hall. After ,marching four abreast across the college terrace to the blue gate and back again, the students forn1ed a semi-circle around the west steps of the \round building,\ near which the preRident and the dean were seated, calmly waiting for the students to regain h . 'l'b . t etr equ1 1: nu1n. President Bradford of the senior class opened the meeting and called on Dr. Raymond who gave an enthusiastic speech, filled with words of encouragement and advice. Dean Ripton then made a speech, very brief, but to the point. Prof. Truax was then called :for, and he spoke entertainingly for some n1inutes, during which there were frequent outbursts of laughter and applause. · After Professors Opdyke and Pollard and a few under-graduates had addressed the meeting, the students formed in line and marched in single file about the campus and afterward through the principal streets of the city. While the speechmaking was going on, the freshm.en built a large bonfire on the terrace between . North and South colleges, which burst forth in , ' a blaze of glory.' 1.\he meeting did a great : deal of good. It has increased the enthusiastn : of the students and that is just what is needed .at this particular time. When college enthusiastn is strong, everybody takes more interest in college athletics, and this means a great deal. These campus meetings should be ot frequent · occurance from now until after the intercollegiate · meet. p~rsoQals. Messrs. Smith of Williams and Bradford, '98, were guests on the hill Saturday. Dr. Wells was present .and spoke at the educational convention held at Syracuse Uni- versity on May 2 and 3· Prof. Ashmore was in New York on Thurs- day and Friday, attending meetings of the . Managing Committee of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome, and of the Council of the ,Archreological Institute. . . \-' - .... \\ ,_,, J.

UQiOl), 9; tf:obart, S· The last league gam·e on H1·e campus was · played last Saturday morning a:nd resuHed in a hrHiiant victory for the wearers of the Gar-net. The visiting team was Hoba1t, and by this victory Union stands at the head of the league. But we will have to win on the western trip in order to land the pennant. ·One of the most interesting and encouraging features of the game was the fact that from the beginning Union had no difficulty in hitting the baH, and it was owing to this fact, combined with Hobart's poor fielding, tl1at the game was won. 'The game was not as exciting as the Hobart game of last year but it showed that our players are making steady improvement. The features of the game were the batting of Mallery, the strong work of Edwards, and that of the infield in general. The score is as follows : UNION. A. B.. R, :B. H. P.O. A. E.

:. I TtrE CONCORDIENSlS~ The Union- Williams duat athletic m·eet, ·which was ne:ld on the Ridgefield grounds at Albany last Saturday afternoon, was run off as scheduled, but it proved to be a battle with the elements, rather than a friendly contest between the representatives of two rival institutions of learning. The steady rain of the morning and early after- noon had put the track and field in such a miser- able condiitien that it was amusing to see the bicycle riders. wabble along the track, the runners p~ough through the mud and the jumpers ,., fall all over themselves \ in their effort to clear the bar at 4 feet 6 inches. In spite of the slow time, the dashes were the most exciting contests of the day. Price, Union's crack sprinter, was beaten out by only a few inches in the 100 and the 220. Taken as a whole, the meet was not entirely satisfactory. That the pennant would go to the Purple was a foregone conclusion, but it is probable that under favorable climatic conditions the honors would have been more evenly divided. The contest showed that Union has proper material which, with good, hard training, dur- ing the nex::t week, ought to make an excellent showing at the intercollegiate meet on May 30. · The result follows : 100-yard dash, :first heat.-Won by Price, Union; Rooney, Williams, second; Emerson, Williams, third.

Hartranft in Capitol Park was unveiled this afternoon in the presence of a large concourse of people. These exercises were followed by a parade, in which the survivors of the Third Division of the Ninth Army Corps, con1manded by Gen. Hartranft in the civil war, had the right of line. Postmaster-General Smith, '61, Secretary of War Alger, and Adjutant-General Corbin were were present at the unveiling. The statue was designed by F. Wellington Ruckstuhl of New York, and is regarded as one of the most artistic and lifelike equestrian statuei in the country. It represents Gen. Hartranft returning from war, receiving the plaudits of the people. It may not be geaerally known in the college that Gen. Hartranft was one of its alumni of the class of 1853· It wa& during his term as govet·nor of Pennsylvania that he revisited his Ahna Mater in company with Governor Hoff- man of New York, governor of that state, and also an alumni of 1846. - ·\ w ha the an th~ ta< tb:~ ad he In to JL el~ IE cc s: at w al tr. 4 6 c r 1::

Mann died at Milwaukee, Wis., May Ist. 1899· H·e was born at Scho- harie, N. Y., March 4th, 1821. He .entered the sophomore class of Williams college in 1840, and after two years of close application he left this college to enter Union college in Schenec- tady, ~here the following year he graduated in the classical course. He then read law:, and was adtnitted to the bar in the year 1847· In I 8 54 he went to Wisconsin, locating at West Bend. In r857 be was elected Judge of the Third Circuit to fill the vacan·cy caused by the resignation of Judge Larrabee. The following April he was elected for a tern1 of six years, and served until 1859, when he decided to go to Milwaukee where he practiced law until 1874, when he was appointed .T udge of the County Court by Gov. Taylor. Judge Mann was at the head of this court until the Superior Court was created. Since then he has devoted all of his time and attention to the Probate Court. Judge Mann was not a partisan, though his sentiments have always classed him as a Detnocrat. His wife, three daughters and a son survive him. IQtereolle~iate. Ostrander, the crack runner of Hamilton, won the half-mile in 1 : 59 3-5, and the mile in 4 : 44 at the open state athletic meet held May 6, under the auspices of Cornell. Professor Richard Norton, son of Professor Charles Eliott Norton, has been appointed Director of the Atnerican School of Classical Studies in Ron1e, for a period of five years, beginning in September, 1899· Professor Minton Warren, who occupies the chair of Latin at the Johns Hopkins University, has· been elected Chairman of the Managing Committee of the School, in succession to Pro- fessor Williatn Gardner Hale, resigned. More than a :doz:en years have elapsed since tl~e first World's Student Conference was held at Northfield, Mass., upon the invitation of Dwight L. Moody. Every year since that time as summer approaches, each of the larger educa- tional institutions of this section of the country selects its delegates, and large numbers of students from all parts of the world meet at this pleasant summ·er resort to be instructed by Bible study, Jectures and public addresses to become leaders in religious movements. The whole. thne, however, is not devoted to religious instruction, for the Northfield idea is to cultivate the religious nature of college m·en without neglecting physical development, so, interspersed between the rneetings, all sort of sports and exercises are enjoyed which invigorate the students for the serious work before them. The days spent at Northfield are never for- gotten. They always con1e to mind filled with thoughts of all that is best and most inspiring, of the ring of hundreds of -voices joining in the well-known hymns, of lectures and addresses full of religious zeal, and of friendly rivalry in all branches of athletics. Union is always well represented at this convention and this year ought to be no exception as it promises not to be. Professor Pepper, secretary of the faculty, has announced the following commencement stage appointments: Classicals-Charles C. Ballard of Schenec- tady, Snyder Gage of Johnstown, Irving W. Ketchutn of Schenectady, Edward W. Strong ' •. of Schenectady, Harrison K. Wright of Pulaski. Latin scientifics- Harold J. Hinman of Albany, Clayton A. Snyder of Middleburgh.

WE REFER to the business manager all those who wish to talk money. WE ARE GLAD to note that the railing of the \grand old seat of stone\ has been repaired by the ever faithful superintendent of the college g.rounds. THE PRELIMINARY sophomore and junjor ora- torical contests take place next Vi.Tednesday even- ing, and there should be a large number of con- testants. There is enough oratorical ability in the college. and those who possess it should get to work, so that the competition may be brisk. THE UNION NINE played another star game on last Saturday morning. The team has braced up wonderfully within the last few weeks and has demonstrated that it can play good ball. Every man on the team has done good work. Of course attendance. THE MEET at Albany last Saturday can by no means be called a successful one. Williams, from start to finish, had nearly everything her o:'lfvn way. While the result was a great disappoint- ment to Union, she accepted her defeat gracefully, and now realizes that she tnust settle down to good hard work. The Williams tean1 deserves a great , of credit for the good showing that it tnade. Such work is indicative of good training. . ~ New Floor for [I\emorial Jiall. The sophomore soiree last February establisl1ed the fact that Nott Men1orial Hall could be heated in the coldest of weather. The only objectionable feature of the soiree was the dance floor. It was evident that the cloth on the floor had outworn its usefulness, and a plan was rnade to put down a hard wood dance floor in the Round Building. The schen1e seemed feasible, but no one cared to take the tnatter in hand. When the senior ball committee was appointed the task seen1ed naturally to fall upon then1, as theirs would be the first class to need the floor. From the first President Ray1nond was a wann advocate of the plan to increase the usefulness of the Round Building. With his hearty co- operation and after much correspondence with the trustees consent was given to lay a continuous floor, on the condition that the floor and its lay- ing was to be no expense to the college. It is expected that the contractors will begin the work at once, as nearly all the funds have

the o as in no 0:'\CVll be the ble, as Of co- THE CONCORDtENSIS. been raised from the undergraduate body. With a new hard wood floor in the Round Building, aU the 'Social functions of the coliege now held down town may be successfully held on the hill. Just as soon as the floor is laid the Junior hop committee expect to give a dance-· the last one ·of the season. It is expected that the co1nmencen1ent ball will be one of the most enjoyable .ever hel,d at '. old Union. The committee in charge consists of-Havilah BeardsTey, A. 0. Casey, 'Geo. C. Foote, E. LeC. }fegeman, W. T. Purchase. On \/Vednesday, Thursday and Friday, the tenth ~to the twelfth of May occurred the sixty- sixth annual convention of Psi Upsilon fra- ternitJ. It was held with the Chi chapter at Cornell university, Ithaca. The chapters were well represented, there being about one hundred men in attendance. The Union chapter was represented by George Clark Foote, '99, and Wagner VanVlack, 1900. On Wednesday eveHing an infonnal reception was held at the chapter house. The greater part of 1\'hursday was occupied by business sessions of the convention and in the evening public literary exercises were held in Barnes Hall, over which Horatio G. vVhite, Harvard, '73, dean of the Cornell law school, presided. Prof. Gold·win Stnith, Cornell, '76, of Toronto, the celebrated writer and historian, delivered a tnasterly address on the \ Future of Poetrv.\ Mr. Richard Hovey, Dartmouth, '85, read a poern. On Friday afternoon a steamer was chartered for the occasion and the visitors were taken for a ride on Cayuga lake. They had an oppor\ tunity, also, of seeing the Cornell crews at work. The closing feature of the convention was the banquet. This was held Friday evening in the New Ithaca Hotel. Charles Hildreth Blair ' Cornell, '72, presided and there were many im- promptu speeches. '' The Sl-uHt Lin:e War \ is the titile ofa novel by Merwin-·· Wehste:r recently issued by the Macmi11aiil company. One of the authors is Henry Ki;tchell Webster who was instructor in oratory at Union last year. The action of the novel depends largely upon the attempts of a pro.minent trunk line to acquire by strategy and ev.en f()rce the short line vvhich is i1nportant to it £or a number of reasons. It is a lively story, and iRtroduces some characters quite new to fiction. Notable features or Outing for May include a trout fishing story, \The Da,m Leaper,\ by Wm. A. Whitney;'' Plovers and Plover Shoot- ing,\ by Ed. W. Sandys; \The :Challenge of Shamrock,\ by A . .f,.

'J.'he second annual invitation inter-scholastic athletic rneet, which was held under the au~pices of the Union College Athletic Association last Saturday afternoon proved a great success in spite of ciitnatic conditions. Representatives frotn about 20 schools n1et at the Driving Park accompani~d by tl11eir rooters, and strove for honors on track and field. 1'he meet, taken a vvhole, was tnore success- ful than last year's because of the absence of strong tean1s fron1 the large New York schools, which carried ofr the prizes last year. The schools represented were tnore nearly of the san1e grade, and con1petition was lively in all the events, especially in the sprints. Special 1nention nn1st be tnade of the victorious team frorn Cooperstown, the work of Bladworth of Claverack, and that of J. B. ~fhomas, Jr., of Blake school. The Cooperstown boys were a great lot of jun1pers, and their fine showing in ' the high jun1p, the shot put, and the hamtn.er throw, gave them the pennant. The Troy Con- ference Academy was represented by a strong all-around teatn. Their points were scattered through the different events and they catne close to winning. The events and winners follow. Considering the fact that several of the events took place during the rain, the Tecords are very good: 100 yard dash.-'.Von by H. Blad worth, Hudson River institute; G. T. Pollock, T. C.

The score at the beginning Qf the eighth was 7 to 3 in Vermont's favor, but the next two innings Union braced up and came within an ace of tieing the score. 1'wo runs were made in the eighth and in the ninth Mallery went out at first, Purchase sect1red a base on balls and Lawton made first on John- son's fumble.

Among the many enterprises of the students for the past year, from present indicati·ons none can equal in success the .ministrel entertainn1ent to be given at the Van Curler next Tuesday night. For the past four tnonth s weekly re- hearsals have been held and the greatest care has been exercised in bringing about the excellent showing the students are going to tnake. Under the direction of Prof. Rost, typical songs and capable singers have been chosen, and in all the lines of \burnt cork\ specialties and farces, the entertainment pro1nises to be of the highest order. There will be three divisions in the program. The first will be straight ministrel .. in which Messrs. Shelly, Barrett and Weed will render ballads ; the end men, Thebo, Minken, Enoch and Ripley, will give solos ; and a grand con- cert chorus of thirty, composed of the best n1usical talent in college, will give three chorus songs. The second part of the progran1me will be given up to specialties, in which a dozen or more ,~.clever artists\ will participate. The conclusion of the progran1tne will he a negro farce, with a cast of six characters. The whole entertainment 1s britnful of wit, humor and striking situations, and will be sure to give com- plete satisfaction to all wo attend. The purpose is a worthy one and should com- mand the attention and earnest endeavor of every student. The proceeds will be equa1ly divided between the n1usical and athletic associa- tions, and frotn the number of tickets already sold, the attendance promises to be large. The prices of tickets are 35, 50 and 75 cents. The sale of seats opens next Monday morning at the Van Curler, and it is the earnest desire of the managers that the students give their full.support toward securing a big success for the under- taking.

THE INTERSCHOLASTIC meet last Saturday waS a very successful one. The large attendance was inspiring, and the large number of entries for each event made the contest interesting. Many of the contestants showed up well, which proves that there is a deal of g·ood material in the high schools. Although the rain spoiled some of the events) Union has every reason to feel proud of the result of the work, that she was instrumental in bringing about. THIS IS THE last week of regular senior work. The class of '99 will soon pass from the sphere of undergraduate life, as the many preceding classes have done, adding a few more names to the long list of Union alumni. The four years that have been spent in the shadow of the ''old gray walls'' have been happy and profitable; time well •pent. exuberance, that we must act like get'itlemen and treat our visitors with the utmost respect. The other colleges are to be our guests, and the most cordial friendship should be shown to all. No matter what the circutnstances, Union should re- frain from indulging in any cheering that .might make the other teams fee1 uncomfortable. \Ve m.ay learn a lesson from the \Villiams 1neet. Al- though. they had everything their own way fr01n the beginning, they took the results as a tnatter of course, and did very little cheering. They did not make a great noise over their victory until Union was out of hearing distance. If things should cotne our way on the 30th, let us be calm and reserved until the proper time for an outburst of enthusiasm. Mr. George E. Raitt, 1900, president of the Y. M. C.

A. of Syracuse university, and student secretary of the college Y. M. C. A. As Mr. Jenkins has al- ready spent a couple of seasons at Northfield, his short addt·ess on the Northfield conference and the possibilities of the college Y. M. C. A. was exceptionally interesting to the fellows who had assetnbled in the rooms that evening. He spoke of Northfield itself, of the beautiful scenery in and around this delightful place. Then he briefly described a tnodel day at the conference, mentioning the names of several men who are especially prominent in the move- n1ent, and whose addresses before the student assembly are so full of thought, intellectual power and influence for good. He made an eloquent appeal to those who were interested in the Y. M. C. A. work to at- tend the conference, which will tako place dur- ing the ten days succeeding the cloiing of college. He mentioned the benefits to be de- rived by all who were sincerely interested in Y. M. C. A. work by attendance at this conference, and he closed by expressing the wish that aU who could possibly do so, would visit Northfield and obtain suggestions valuable not only in advancing the influence of the college Y. M. C. A., but also in directing their own lives to the best efforts. The Y. M. C. A. expects to have a large delegation of men at Northfield to represent Union this summer and any men who are think- ing of visiting Northfield should arrange for regular student rates.
