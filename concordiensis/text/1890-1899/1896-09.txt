2 THE CONO.ORDIENSIS. foot Ball pros.pe~~ts. The prospects for foot ball this year are not as en~ouraging as in the years gone by. The loss of such men as Lyon, '99, Peters, '97, Myers, '96, Hayes, '97, Sommer, '96, Sweet- land, '97, Terry, '96, Willis, '97, Taylor, '96, Beckw·ith, '96, MaBery, '96; Ba-rry, '99, and Hilton, '96 will make big holes which will be hard to fill. The practice comtnenced on the day of the opening of college. The failure to elect a captain last year leaves that important position vacant. Blodgett, '97, and Palmer, '97,. who were candidates last year will probably run £or the office again this fail. The seau1·ing of a coach has not been fully a'ecided upon as yet but it will not b~ long before some experienced tnan has the fellows in charge. Church, who brought . out our great team of last season, is unable to cotne. The following men have been playing on the campus, trying for the \varsity\: Book-- bout, '97, at centre ; Thomas, '98, Schmitter, '99, guards; Palmer, '97, Thatcher, 1900, tackles ; Price, '99, Gage, r9oo, ends; Stnith, '99, quarter; Jones,. '98, Crichton, '98, halves; and Hoxie, '98, at full back. Blodgett, '97:, will not return until the last of this week to re- sume his old place at guard. The \scrub\ is showing up fairly well and very shortly will give the \varsity\ sotne hard work.

There is tnaterial in the new class that can be developed and there is no reason why we should not have a better team than we had at times in the past. Every tnan should at least offer· his services if he does not know anything about the game. The class games are being ~rrang~ed for a.nd will be announced in a few days.

These yearly 1·eC'eptions are intended to give the new students an opportunity to meet the faculty, the pastors of the city . churches, the ~ upper class men, and especially tne men of their own class. The reception was well Httended and every one was made to feel hhnself at hon1e. The upper classmen sought the acquaintance of the new men and tried to bring them together as much as possible. It was not long before men1- · hers of the faculty, upper classtnen and freshmen were gathered in small groups, ~ecount!ng pleasant reminiscenses of the sumtner and talk- ing of the wotk of the present year. A number. of college songs were sung during the evening, and later refreshm.ents were served. The tnajority of the· faculty and the city pastors wen~ there to welcome the new tnen and greet the older ones. All were glad to meet President and Mrs. Raytnond who extended a welcome hand. Everyone was pleased with the recep- tion, and the Y. M. C. A. are entitled to tnost hearty thanks for m·aking the occasion one of such enjoytnent. Obituary. It is with deep regret that the first issue of this year's CoNCORDIENSIS announces the death of Hom·er Nellis of the class of '98. By his death his fellow students have been bereft of a friend and an esteemed associate. Mr. Nellis was an excellent student, of a kind and quiet disposition. He was a 111ember of the Delta Upsilon fraternity where he will be especially missed. His death occurred at his home in St. Johnsville, N. Y., on July 13, only a few weeks after his return hotne from college. Metnbers of his fraternity were present at the funeral cere- mony and the chapter sent a beautiful wreath of flowers.

Walker of the engineering department was married Sept. 10 to Miss M. Louise Brownell, at the home of her father John L. Brownell, Altatnont. Miss De Remer of this city acted as n1aid of honor. There were many .guests present at the wedding and the re- ception which followed. Instructor Walker is a graduate of the J\1assachusetts Institute of Technology where he also taught for some time, and he has been at Union for two years during which he has won the respect and esteem of the students. All join in congratulating the newly wedded couple. Arthur W. Peters, '97, now situated at Lock- port, N. Y., was married to Miss Mabelle Du- Bois Neher .of Rochester at Albany, Sept. 16, 1896. The ceremony occurred at the residence of her cousin, Mr. Van Allendorf, No. 162 Western Avenue. Many fine presents were re- ceived. Lord, '93 and Eatnes, '95 acted as ushers. Mr. J. R.

The annual freshman-sophomore cane rush took place on the cam pus last Monday, and although no bones were broken the .scTimtnage was very lively. The freshmen held' their first class tneeting in the chernical ·laboratory, and when ·they came out they were gree\'ted with a shower of salt. The sophomores in their turn were pelted with totnatoes and flour by the freshmen. Then\'a cane was produced and each class struggled fiercely for its possession. Frotn time to time a freshman would overcome a sophomore and be in turn thrown down by another, while an occasional flattened nose or bruised shin told of the prowess of son1e an- tagonist. Before any blood was spilled, how- ever, time was called and the cane was a warded to the sophomores 14 to ro. As a result no freshman will be allowed to carry a walking stick until the Easter vacation. ~OllQty Fair.

BURROWs, PRINTER AND BINDER, SCHENECTADY, H. V. This issue of THE CONCORDlENSIS has been sent to every student and to a large numb~r of the Alumni. THE PARTHENON, a monthly publication, will also be sent out as ·soon as published. Unless we hear from you, or the paper is· returned to us. we will continue sending it and bill you for it later. THE CoNCORDIENSIS is a <6ollege publication. The management of:its·business and the writing and editing of all its matter is directly under the control of the student body. The editors, and all the members of its reportorial staff are chosen by competition. The business manager is elected by his class, during his Sophomore year. The paper is self supporting and if carefully managed, yields an income of $100 to the editor in chief, $100 to the business manager and $50 to the literary editor. If the yearly receipts are more tl1an sufficient to pay the above salaries, one-half of the balance goes to the Athletic Board and the other half is add~d p'TO 1·ata to the salaries of the officers of the board. The editors are each allowed four copies of the paper. The members of the repor- torial staff are each allowed two copies, and those chosen from the Freshman class one copy. All men1bers of the Freshman· class who desire to ~nt·et the competition .fo:r position on the staff, will please hand their names either to the Literary Editor or to the Editor-in-Chief. Thi.Parthenon, which is to be issued monthly, is at present under the management of THE CoN- OORDIENSIS board. If it proves to be a ,suc~ss, . its management will probably be sep~rated next year fro1n. that of T:aE CoNCORDIENSIS. Posi · tions on its Board of Editors are open to the com- petitio11 of me tubers of the Junior, Sophomore and Freshman classes. . .All students are earnestly requested to con- tribute articles for publication. THE present issue of THE CONCORDIENSIS is a. de- parture from that form of publication which has been in vogue in Union College for the past nine- teen years.. With thi$ number we place in. the hands of the students of this college, a paper de· signed purely for the distribution of news of a local character, as well as all matter pertaining to the general government of the institution. In tbefutureTHE CONCORDIENSIS will be issued once a week. At the end of eacb month o.f tbe coll~ge year a small 1uagazine will be published, which, i·t is hoped, will be sufficiently interesting to the student body to obtain from them their hearty support. We do not expect that The Parthenon, because of its literary merits, shall rank among the great literary magazines of the day; we do not expect its circulation to extend far . beyond the boundaries of the college proper. We do expect, however. to produce a periodical which will re- flect the literary ability of the student body, and which should prove of absorbing interest to e'Very Qne, who, deeming himself worthy of a college education, has passed within the blue gates of \ Old Union.\ · The <board of editors have not entered upon this new venture without apprehensions of failure. It is their desire to place the publications of this college in fair comparison with those of other similar institutions. We expect, and must have the support of every student. We are not over sanguine of success, but have bolstere.d up our courage by oft repeating the old adage-nothing commenced, nothing done. IN ANOTHER column there is a notice regarding the college library. It states that students: are not allowed to take books from the library. It is the opinion of THE 00NCORDIENSIS that this rule is entirely out of keeping with the character· of this institution, and that it works to the disadvan- tage of both the student and the library. Many books have without doubt been intentionally stolen, but by far the greater portion of those which are now missing, have been taken· secretly by students who intended to return them. ,,A favorable opportunity for their return not ·occur- ring, the books have been lost. , . Why should not a student be allowed to take' a book fi'Oin the library and have it charg.ed to him ? Such a privilege is granted to the professors al!ld · instructors of the colleg·e. The library was cer- tainly created as much for the students us~· as' for the professors. ·The whole fault lies in the system. Eve.ry 'book should have its accompanying card, .and when the book is taken out, the card should be left with the librarian, who can, by referring to it, see who bas the book.' This is the system now followed· in all well regulated libraries, and until it is adopted here, books will be missed from the shelves, and when once gone the chances of their return are small indeed. =

' TilE' OONOORDIENSIS. ~. IF THE s-tudents of Union College are sufficiently interested in athletics to want a foot ball tean1 this fall, they will have one. The: matter ~ests~ entirely with the1n. As far as the individual is ' concerned, it is not a question altogether of \Veigbt : and ntusc]e but it is rather a question of college spirit. No -effective work of any kind was ever . done which was not animated by some degree of • enthusiasm.. The life and action of a man is de- tertnined in a great part by the atmosphere which surronnds him. So it is with the life and action of any foot ball team which WGtS ever created, its efficiency ,is exactly proportional to the intensity of the enthusiasm which supports it. It takes more than eleven men now-a-days to make a foot ball team. It requires something from every man in college, and if there is a single one who fails to do his part, just so far does he ·fail in · doing his duty to his college, and to his fellow students, who are earnestly striving for the glory of Old Union on the foot ball field. .THECONCORDIENSlS is the students'publication.. Such editorials as shall be printed in these eolumns Will reflect the wishes of the student body. Many articles which may appear in this paper in the future may not appeal to the faeulty as they do to the students. If some of them appear unjust or unc~lled for, it is not because we wish to stir up iii feeling, but because we write without that clear- ness of comprehension which an occasional atten- dance at faculty meeting might produce.

8 ----ADVERTISEMEN·TS.- One Man Says : \Saul's $U suits to order fit perfectly. If a mould of me had been taken, and the cloth had been poured into the mould, I could not have been fitted more exactly.\ Maybe that's exaggeration, but maybe it isn't. What we say is that our $14.00 Suits to Order Fit the man they are made for, or he needen't take them. They are full of wear and full of style. They are good dependable clothes, in spite of the small price. There are other good tailors in Albany, but they ·Charge more than Saul. They ean do as perfect tailoring as we do, but you pay them higher prices. You are the judge of the ma.tter. It's for you to say whether the cost shall be $14: at Saul's, or $20 to $25 sot:newhere else. Fall and Winter materials ready for your inspection.
