The story of the game in figures: On a trip through this ~state last week they played a tie game with Syracuse, won from Cornell 9-5~ from U ni~n 1o-5, and frotn West Point 6-4. Several changes in the make-up of our team were noticeable. Stewart was in right field l~n Mallery's place and he played a creditable game. Parshall was .seen for the first game on the campus behind the bat and his playing there fully confirmed the good reports brought back .of his w:ork at West Point. Wiley's spr~ined thumb kept him out of the game and his place was filled· by Nevins, who, however, lac!ks Wiley's expe~ience at covering first. Thatcher and Miner both pitched well, each being hi~t safely only six times. The second inning was the first. in which there was any scoring and then Vermont started in at such a pace that the result looked rather : dubious for the Garnet ; but after the second ; inning the playing was ·more nearly even, and . when neither side had scored in the third., Union began the fourth wi~th Parshall being hit by a pitched ball and Thatcher. taking his base on called balls. In an attempt to catch Parshall at second Miner threw the ball out in centre field and Parshall romped home. In the fifth Stewart singled and was followed by Cook who sent the ball over the short stops head. French was next up and he reached first, but· forced Cook out at second, Stewart making third.

TEE ·OONCORD-lENSIS. In the illustrated ~magazine supplement oflast 'Saturday's Mail an<i 1 . Express is printed a most interesting group '()f portraits representing some • of Union's famous. S()ns of '6o at the time ·of their :graduation and .at tl1e present. Accompanying the portraits was ,the foHow- ing, article : ]''rom the clim·a.x <Jf boyhood to the: fnU :maturity o'f manhood-from tihe happy days- and uights of ca.reless college 1ife, C(f)enae noetesque deorum, to tne serious thoughts~ of a busy career, such is the span -which separates the paraUel portraits -which we lLere present.

The class of 1860 at Union was a ilota.ble one, both in point of ll umbers and in the eminence -which many of its members have a:chieved since their graduation. At that period Union's classes -were the largest ela.sses graduated at a.:ny coltege in the country. 'The class following' '6@-that of ;'61-was also large and subsequently distinguished -containing such_ men as Postn1aster-Ge:neral Smith, Congressrnan Gillet, \Eli PerkJns, '' Hon. Edwin Einstein, Bon. Chester Holconbeand Hon. John M. Bailey-but after the out break of the war, signalized b-y the departure of a. company to the front com.posed of college students and led by Prof. Elias Peissner, the classes rapidly d-windled in size. The class of '60 graduated 104: men, while 58 others were at one time or another during t.he four years members of the class. A1nong the men of this remarkable class who have made their- >~nark in the world in the several walks of life are Wal'ner Miller, whose long politi- cal life was fittingly crowued by a term in the United States S'eaate; Samuel R. Tba.-yer, United :States Minister to the Nether lands under Presi- dent Harrison.; Charles E. Sprague, president of the Union Dbae Savings ,.Bank; F~·anli Loomis, general counsei of the New York Oentra.l Rail- road; Neil Gilrneur, ex-Superintendent of{nstruc- tion; William H. McElroy, orator, poet and litterateur editor of the Rochester Post- E:xpress; the late Douglas Campbell, author of ''The Puritan in Holl&nd, England and America;\ Charles E. Patterson, ex-.Speaker of the Assegtbly; Rev. Dr~ G. P.- Nichols, one of the most dis- tiaguished preachers of the Presbyterian Churcb; ·Gen. Americus V.

Casualty C~tnpany·; ~ev. ·Dr. David· McAllister,. ex-president of Allegheny College; and A. W. Gieason, William C. Trull and Henry L .. Smith, of the New York bar. Fully one-third of Union's class of '60 eJ}J;isted in the war ·for the Union, and not all of them came baek. Of those who did, hardly one came back without well deserved promotion for valor dis- played in· the field. No class has been more loyally devoted to the interests of thelr alma mater, and even today, after nearly 40 years out. of college, few classes except the very -youngest turn up at commencement with so ma.ny l~sty voices to sing the famous ''Song to Old Union\ as the class of 1860~ •' Then here's to thee, the brave and free, Old Union smiUng o'er us; And;·for many a day, as thy walls gr()W gray, May they ring with thy children's ehorua.

JUPITER PLUVIUS did not see fit to permit an addition to our baseball record last w.ednesday afternoon, the thne scheduled to meet Colgate, but the record up-to-date is very satisfactory not- withstanding. Any one who watched last Friday:s game with half an eye saw that ·captain Smith's men pia.yed baseball. They also saw that the team is gaining in spirit and strength .. with every game. Vermont defeated us. They won the game in the fatal third. It is something not to be ashamed of that the team in the face of defeat . thus assured, put up a game extremely plucky and extremely clever.

If this term's work is unusually prolific in low grades, doting parents sho-uld be all tile proader o'f their patriotic progeny. They .should regard with suspicion anytbing bigher than a nice respectable second. THE outburst of genuine patriotisin that signal- ized the departure of .the troops last Monday morning,. and in which the students of this college took snch creditable share, will live long in the minds and hearts of everyone present on that occaiioo. To Union's sons who have already gone, and to those-all who remain-who are ready to go, at our beloved Uncle Samuel's call there is the ever present inspiration of glorious ,example.

I know how eager the im- pulse is to leap to arms at the first call. It is a . worthy impulse, com1non to 1nany-a.n element of strength in our national Ufe. But of the thousands and tens of thousands who are now fairly blazing with sach an impulse, ho small percentage have serious obligations constraining them to do other- wise.

The Corlcordie11sis VoL. XXI. UNION COLLEG-E, MAY 14, 1898. No. 27. Dean Ripton addressed the students at last Sunday afternoon's Y. M. ·C .. A. meeting. Taking the war with Spain as his. general topic, he said : A great many ideas as 'to the jiUstification of the war are afloat in these days, especially in the newspapers. A New York paper recently pub- lished a so-called \account\ with Spain, in which the ''Maine\ was put on the debit side, and on the credit side were the vessels destroyed by Dewey and the prizes captured near Key West. Such an account interprets untruly the real spirit with which we go into the fight. It is not a war of vengeance, no true American thinks of it as such. Another paper published a cotn- muuication from the pen of a tnan once a senator, now a reporter of prize fights and the like, in which condemnation is pronounced on the nation, for its blood thirsty delight in battles, and the inhuman joy with which it received news of victory and waits for yet more blood- shed. further illustrated by comparisoN of England a.nd Spain. No one denies that ERgland':s policy is often thought to he a '' land-gra.bbi ng\ policy. No one denies that England makes mistakes in .a.dministration. Bat in spite @f all there is a eonscience in England that very largely atones for aiL The territory which she acqui,res she rules justly in the main and makes advancement , of man in it much tnore rapid than it would otherwise be. In short, England takes a broad v,i:ew of the duty of a powe,rfh1 nation to the world and exercises her 1-p.ight with jtilsHce and discretion. But on the other 'hand, what has Spain done? She has a wonderful history and considers it the keenest taunt when she says we bave none. For eight hundred years she fought to drive the Mohan1medans from h.er land. Her crusade was at home, while England, France and ,Gennany sought theirs far away. This de- veloped son1e strength, but made her shut her- self up. She lost the broad culture of the other nations. When America was discovered, large- ly through her influence, she sent nutnbers of tnissionaries to its shores. These men did a good work, but it 'vas not long before the proud personal element of the Spaniard showed itself. Unwilling to learn of others, she substituted the Spanish inquisition for aggress:i ve mission work. And here began her downfall. She received power, and not understanding or not accepting its responsibility, she abused and lost it. And for us Americans this is a warning. Whatever we may have been in the past, the capture of Manila gives us a different attitude. Possibly we are to join hands with England in extending justice over the world. Our p~licy of exclusive- ness has gone, we belong now to the world. Our sphere of action begins to widen and our power to enlarge; and the -way in which we accept and administer our increased power will determine the character of our :f:u ture for good or Now is this true? Is our joy over victory and our love of our soldiers the result of the men they have killed and the property they have destroyed? I think not. Take the veterans of the civil war, what we honor in them is not the destruction they caused but the sacrifice they made. Think of the veterans of the Mexican war. 'VVe pension and honor them, but we do not honor thetn as we do the boys of '61. 'Vhy not? Because we are not so proud of the principle for which they fought, the principle of ' mere territorial aggrandisement. And when we think of this we see that the nation is not at heart bl<:;od thirsty, that there is no n\lere thin veneer of civilization upon our savage nature, but that our heart's approval is given for sacri- fice in a just cause. The righteousness of this war can be still bad.

Wednesdar afternoon the campus was the scene, from a Union standpoint, of the best played baseball game of the season. The visitors were a team of semi-professional players representing the Cohoes Y. M. C. A. and there were among their number several old state leaguers. The teatn, short one player, did not reach town until3: 20 so that it was a few minutes after four when the game was called and, owing to the lateness of the hour, only eight innings were played, Parker, 1901, ~upplying the vacant position on the Cohoes team. 'fhe work of Captain Smith's men was the best thus far in the year and Thatcher's pitching far outshone his work in any previous game. 1'he visitors only three times succeeded in getting a man to first base and tnade only one hit off Thatcher's delivery. No scoring was done in the first inning but Union sent two men across the plate in the second, on two singles, a. base on balls and two errors. Neither side SC()red in the third or in the fourth but in the next, Stewart's two-bagger, Cook's single, and ar.. error netted one n1ore run. In the seventh F1·ench crossed tbe plate, and by some hard hitting in the eighth Union raised the score by four runs more.

TE:E CONCORDIENSIS. 'f]J..e advent .of the new catalogue shows a marked increase and sh<ength·ening'\ in several depar~tments. Notwithstanding tbe fact that the . entnu11ce req_ uiretnents are high and are strictly : ad:b.eTed to, the number of students in all de- , pa~rt~ments has not decreased perceptibly. The enb~~uiJ,ce :requiren1ente of each year are slightly big her it han those of the preceding year and in this way the standard of scholarship througb.out the course is raised. The course of the Medical ·· coBege has been changed frorn three to four · years. 'Tl1e facult.ies of the different departments · have been augmented considerably since last year. In the academic departrnent Frank F. 1 1'1:totnpson, E. E., instructor in phys·ics, A. A. Tyler, Ph. D., instructor in biology, John W. H. Pollard, B. L., instructor in physical culture, H:en.ry K. Webster, A. B., instructor in rhetoric and Frederic R. Jones, A. M., Ph. D. in- strl:l'ctor l1ave been added ; in. the schoo 1 of ~civa engineering Edgar B. Kay, C. E., in- stntctor in civil engineering and B. B. Brackett, Pb. D., instructor in electrical engineering; in the Medical college, George Blumer, M. D., adjunct professor of histology, Pathology and bacteriology, and Walter Foot Robinson,M. D., lecturer in electro-therapentics. Otherwise than efforts to make each depart- ment as thorough as possible, the changes in the carriculu tn have been slight. In the English language and literature departn1ent, studies in litet·ary criticis1n from Sidney to Pater are offered in substitution in certain years for the philosophy of English literature. In the bi0- logical departrnent four hours per week of 1<t b1·a tory work in structural botany and bacter- iology are required in the B. E. course. 'ren new cotn petitive prize scholarships are now offered yearly in the A. B. and Ph. B. courses.. There is one of $zoo, two of $r 50, three of $r35 and four of $r 20. These are open . to any student who has been awarded a tuition sch.olarship, but upon acquiring the prize scll.olarsbip he must relinquish the tuition scholarship.

State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. IMPORTANT as the two athletic meets of this week are, we should not forgcet the Inter-collegiate meet at Utica. on May 28. Union made a good start last year by winning the n1eet in a walkover, and there seems to be no especial reason why we should not make it tL cust()m. Modesty is always commendable, but an healthy rivalry is equally so, and we have no right to step aside to let another college win. Tl1e athletes who will re- present Union at Utica will undoubtedly do their best, and it will not be their fault if Union does LAST year witnessed the revival of the old custom of cam pus meetings, and -we all rein ember how much it did to keep up college spirit. 'The idea has been adopted this year by Cornell with .great success, and many other coUeges give those meetings a recognhed place in their :student life. The weather gods have not h~tberto been pro- pitious, but there will surely be 'SOme pleasant evenin,gs this month on which s:tLch a celebration might be held. Why not have one before the Utica meet~ It will brace up ou.1· enthusiasm more than anything else we could na.me. THIS week, Union is presented the opportunity of welcoming within its gates t:he representatives of a score of preparatory schools. The importance of the occasion is so great that tt can not fail to attract attention fro In the most a. pathetic. It is not merely a question of interesting so many sub- freshmen in Union's supedority as a :seat of learn- ing, but it should be a matter of giving every one of our visitors such an opinion of the place, that he will reme1nber and respect her wherever he may go for higher education. The only way to do this will be for every man to ta.ke part in what is going on. There'll be a reception; let every man be there with a glad hand. There'll be a meet; let every man be there wi-th his voice. THE Honorary Chancellorship of Union College is a position which confers an honour upon the occupant. But this year the conditions will be reversed and the occupant will confer honour upon the position. Those of 11s who heard Dr. not win the pennant. But a duty devolves upon Henry Van Dyke's lecture a year ago. on Robert those who are not athletes. To go out on the track and encourage ou-r athletes in their train- ing, to ·help rub them down afterward, to keep alive an intense college £Jpirlt, are easy things to do and they may be just wha-t is needed to insu1·e success. That is not all A large de legation should accompany the team to Utica, to encourage the men by rooting and lei them know that they are among friends. If we do this, there ought not to be much doubt of the result. Louis Stevenson will appreciate the treat which is in store for those who attend commenceinent. Born a gentleman, a clergyman by profession, distinguished also as an author and .a scbola.r, Dr. Van Dyke combines in himself all of those characteristics which distinguish the man of ideals from the Philistine. The college authorities are to be congratulated upon the felicity of their selection and the rest of us are to ee congratulated upon the pleasure we are to enjoy.

~--· ~ - .. - ' We WiQ from }'lamiltol]. runs coRi:ag in on as many hits, by ·Grout, Nevins.,. :R.(!)binson, Cook and French, and Par,shaU's :sacrifice, to which was added another The first baseball game under the rules of the newlv formed New York State Intercollegiate Athl~tic union took place on the campus Satur~ day afternoon before a large ·Cro~d of spectators. The opposing nines were Unton and her old rival, Hamilton, and as was the case last year, the Garnet was triumphant. The game was a loosely played one, the errors on both sides being far in excess of what they should ha.ve been, and although the score wa:s twice tied, ·Captain Smith's men were able to win out at any stage of the game. Aside frotn the error columns, the features were, the work of Millha m at third, and Robinson in left field, the latter's running catch of a foul fly being the prettiest play of the season seen on the cam pus. In the opening inning Mallery and Stewart were in the points for Union, but as the fonner was unable to locate the plate, they were succeeded in the second by Thatcher and Parshall. ·• in the eigl1fh but none in the ninth. With the score 16 it<J 10 against thetn Hamilton started in their ha!ltf @f the ninth with a rush. HuH singled, :S~tevens reached first on Cook's ·error, and Robertson took four balls. Then with the bases fuU Rog,ers made a two sacker, scoring all three men·. But it all ended there. Baker struck out, ·Cunningham followed suit, and Hey 1 went out on Robinson's phenornenal catch of a fo·ul fl. y. 'The score : The gan1e started with Union at bat. French and Mal:lery each took four balls, French scored on Robinson's single, Stnith's single sent Mallery and Robinson home, and he, too, scored on Wiley's hit to Baker, and Grout's sacrifice. Hamilton, however, also started in at a fast pace and before the inning was over had evened up the sco1~e. Stevens and Robertson \walked Baker hit safely to left field and Roger's scot·ed Stevens' on a short hit to Mallery and Stewart's error. Cunningham and Heyl singled and this with a passed ball brought in three more runs. In the second Union took four more and shut Hamilton out. In the third the run-making began to be n1onotonous, each side scoring two. In the second half of the inning Wiley's knee was in- jured and he retired for the rest of the game, Nevins going to first in his stead. The fourth saw no t·uns in Union's half while Hamilton sent three rnen across the plate on one error and clean hits by Cunningham, Heyl and Dunn. In the next no scoring was done and likewise the first half of the sixth, but in the second half Hamil- ton made one run, thus tieing the score. The seventh was the lucky one for the Garnet, five UNION. A. :B. R. 1:s. P. 0. A. E. Frencn, :,2b~ •. - •· •............. 6 3 2 3 1 1 ::Mallery, p. '0·'' ..

It was purdy an experi- . meN.t, but a most profitable and successful one it provefl to be, and its retnarkab1e success fixes it as an annual affair. All credit to Prof. Pollard and Manager Cox. The meet was first suggested by the form,er and he was ably assisted in the carrying of it on by the latter. Never in the history of the ,college was a n1eet so welltnanaged. Of the forty invitations sent out to the pre- paratory schools of Eastern New York, Ver- mont and Massachusetts, over twenty favorable replies were received, but the nuLnber was finally lowered to nineteen, .and of these, fifteen schools had at least one point to their credit when the rneet was over. The importance of a meet of this kind cannot be overestimated. Besides being of value to the athletes themselves, a feeling of rivalry is excited among the schools. The college, too, comes in for a good share of benefit. The boys who are attending preparatory schools are enabled to see the advantages each individual college offers, and in this particular instance Old Union must certainly have made a good im- pression upon her visitors. Prof. Pollard apportioned the athietes to the different fraternities and conseqnently all were well cared for. Two teams arrived on Friday and the remainder on Saturday before the hour of the meet, so that by half past two-the hour scheduled for the first event-the sturdy athletes were in their running suits ready to begin the afternoon's contests. A large crowd had gathered at the Driving Park and everything seetned to forecast a great day of sports. The weather was almost perfect and the track never in better condition. Event after event was called and contested and by half past five all was over. The schools from New York City, Barnard and Trinity were easy victors and were really in a higher class than the rest of the cotnpeting schools. There were many close finishes and two ties . The bicycle races a·J?d the dashes as usual gave the judges 1nuch trouble in picking the winners, the contestants so1netimes being within an inch or two of each other at the finish line. In the mile bicycle race a tim,e limit was set of 2 :5o, and as on the first trial the litnit was exceeded,. the race was run over-this thn·e in 2 :43. In the 100 yard dash, the I 20 yard hurdle, the 220 yard hurdle and the 220 yard dash the large number of entries made it necessary to run tria~ heats and semi-finals before the finals. When the points had been counted up it was found that Trinity took the pennant, with a tota~l score of 31 points. Barnard School was next with 28 points and the others followed in this order: Troy High school, 13; Newburgh Academy, I 2 ; Troy Conference Acadetny, r I ; Hudson High school, 9; Amsterdam High school, 5 ; Union Classical Institute, 4 ; Troy Academy, 3 ; La Salle Institute, 3 ; Albany High school, 3; and Fort Edvvard High school, Johnstown High school, Pulaski Union school, and Saugerties High school, each one point.

' ' • ' ' • • ' r, 9 THE CONCORDIENSIS. W;e have received the two following jokes , from Melville D. Landon, '6r, {Eli Perkins). They were addressed to th-e '' religious editor of , the Concordiensis.\ ELI'S ADVICE TO COLLEGE BOYS. \:Gallantry is all very well,\ said the golden- · haired Chri!stian Endeavorer, ''but sometirnes gallantry can be overdone. Now, when George ·c~une down from the college last night r remarked to him that Longfellow said kisses w.er.e much. sweeter in the dark-- '' And of course George turned down the gas?'' \ The idiot did nothing of the kind. He just sat there like a stick and said in stiff college • language thjlt if a girl were as handsome as I, he thought darkness would detract from the pleasantness of the occasion. It was a very nice christian complhnent, but there is a time to speak and a time to act.\ OLD GREEK WIT. The wit of the old Greek philosophers, Solon, Socrates and Aristippus, said Eli Perkins, con- sisted in proving a big lie by the sophistry of a syllogism like this: \Anything whose sun never sets, Cato, is im- mortal,\ said Aeschines. \ Yes, that is true, Aeschines.\ \ A hen's son never sets.'' \ True, too.\ \ Then a hen is immo1tal,\ said the satirist, laughing. To illustrate the wit and wisdotn of the Greeks I translate a few passages from Aeschines, the satirist: \ What good does education do a man any- way?\ asked the ignorant but proud Clinos. \An educated man,\ said Aeschines, \ can associate with himself (think, imagine and meditat.e. )\ ~' Why do you say it is better to be poor t4an '' What will you charge to educate tny boy?\ continued Clinos. ''Sixty drachma,\ said Aeschines. \That is too rnuch.. With sixty dra.chma I can buy a Rlave.\ ''Then go and buy one and you will have a pair,\ said Aeschines, laughing. Two addresses were delivered in the college chapel on Sunday afternoon, under Y. M. C. A. auspices. Dr. Jones first spoke, taking as his subje'ct : ''A Calling.\ This he defined as '' a well defined adaptability to that legitimate work in which one is best able to contribute the greatest good to mankind.\ His address proper con- sisted of a careful exposition and defence of this definition. The second speake\r was Mr. C. V. Vickery, a post-graduate student of Vale, now visiting eastern colleges in the interests of theN orthfield sutnmer school. His subject was: \ 1.'he responsibility of college christian young rnen.\ He dwelt at length upon the responsibility, and upon the opportunity of young tnen at college. To lead college men, said he, is to lead leaders, and it is doubtful if any n1an will ever have a like opportunity to win men for Christ. One of the principal V\rays of training tnen for the work this responsibility involves is at the North- field summer school, and for that reason a large nutnber should attend frotn every college association. j1oQor (T\eiJ ,RppoiQted. to be ignorant?\ ''Because the poorest beggar can beg money and get it, but the fool will beg in vain for The following cotnrnencement stage appoint- tnents have been made: Orrin G.

Another link was added to the chain of base- ball victories on Wednesday afternoon when the wearers of the garnet took their second league gatne, this time from Hobart. The gatne was certainly a tnost re.tnarkab1e one. Never in many years has the campus seen a gan1e so completely snatched away fron1 what seemed cet-tain .defeat. Up to the end of the seventh inning Union had been plaY'ing only a fair gam,e and the visitors had piled up eight runs while the best that Captain Srnith's men could do was to get .a. couple of tnen to third base. At the beginning of the eighth, however, the tide was turned. French started the ball rolling with a single to left field, ·Carver took four baH, and French scored on Parshall's single to L. Carr. With Carver on third and Pa1·sl1aH on second Thatcher raffled off a two-bagger and scored both tnen. Smith went out on a foul flv to H. Carr but Grout's three bagger over tl;e terrace brought Thatcher ho1ne and he, himself, scored on a passed balL In their half Hobart went out in one, two, three order, and Union again began her run t;naking. Cook went out at first on a hit to third but with French's single and Carver and Parshall to first on four balls, the bases were filled. Thatcher again saved the day with a two-bagger, he went scoring with Parshall on Smith's hit to second base and a wild throw. This made the score nine to eight in Union's favor and the lead was increased by one on Wiley's single. Thus was won the gatne, for Hobart vvent out ]n the same orde~r as in the previous inning. Next to the rernarkable batting streak in the eighth and ninth, the features of the gatne was the excellent work of Thatcher and Parshall, both in the field .and at bat. The score. HOBART. A.B. R. L.

The appointees from the different fraternities upon the 1900 Garnet board met at 2 : 30 Mon- day afternoon, at the Phi Gamma Delta house to cornplete their organization.. By special arrangement the editor-in-chief for the coming year has been given to the Phi Gamtn.a Delta fraternity of which S. H. French is the repre- sentative. The following officers wers elected : Busi- ness manager, E. M. Sanders; assistant business manager, H. P. Dunham; literary editor, M. F. Bender; assistant literary editor, George Featherstonehaugh; athletic editor, W2gner Van Vlack ; art editor, G. E. Raitt ; associate editors, Louis Tinning, P. L. Thon1pson and L. N. Boorn. E. R. Stillman represented the Medical College in the absence of C. K. Has- kell the regular appointee.

ib <;:t).~ ~eee:p:tioq to Our Visitors. The interscholastic meet was fittingly supplli.e- ! mented by an enthusiastic reception to the c·o:tl- testing teatns in the gymnasium last Saturday 1 evening. The prizes were not, as is usu~d., · given out at the track, but were reserved untiJl that time. The faculty and students turned olilt · en masse and gave the visiting men a m()st ·cordi~l welcotne. The gyn1nasiu.m, which had been decorated for th.e occasion with Union flags, college troph.ies and garnet bunting, presented a very pleasing appearance. Seats were arranged on aH sides and a large gtand piano was placed iu one corner. Shortly after eight o'clock the glee club, accorn panied by the whole college, struck up the ''Song to Old Union\ and followed tbat with several other Union songs. Three sho~·t addresses by members of the faculty were th~n listened to. President Raymond, in a happy manner, C()n- gra>tu1ated the sub-freshrnen upon their success in their respective ~events.. He said the object of the meet was not only to kindle a deeper interrest in school athtetics, hut also to give then'l a better idea of Union's composition and surroundings. He was aware that some of those present would go to other colleges, but also knew that not a few of them had Union definitely in mind. At any rate, however, he assured them of a hearty and sincere welcome to our college. Dr. Perkins and Dean Ripton foHowed the president, each giving a short 'enterta,ining two minute talk, interrupted by frequent laughter and applause. The forf\1-al presentation of 1nedals was then made by Mr. Pollard, each successful contest- ant stepping forward to receive his award of merit. The informal palt of the reception, during which light refresh-tnents were served, concluded the evening's program. Everyone present seemed to enjoy hitnself and there can be no doubt but that Union's hospitality was a decided success frotn every standpoint. Men's Linen Collars and Cuffs !

'The baseball team's trip the latter part of last w·eek proved a most unsuccessful one. Two games had been scheduled to be played at North Adams, Mass., one Friday with a semi-pro- fessional tea·m from North Adams and :the other Saturday with the \ Cuban X Giants.'' The latter team cancelled their game and :Perhaps it was just as well, for by Friday evening Captain ·Smith and his followers had seen enough of · North Adams, and they accordingly set out and ~.~eached Schenectady shortly after ·midnight. The gan1e Friday afternoon was not an especially good one. Union's nine played a listless ga tne and aided by the umpire, North Adams wo.n out. The score: UNION. A. B. R. LB. P. 0. A. E.

There were only two contestants from the junior class: Harold J. Hinman, of Albany, and Irving W. Ketchum, of Schenectady. The forn1er had chosen for his subject '' The Abuse of Power,\ which he treated historically, lead- ing up to some present day proble1ns. The sub- ;ect of the latter was \ The Dominant Character- istic of the Ancient Greek,\ in which he paid an eloquent tribute to their delicate sense of the beautiful in physique, art and language. Seven members from the sophomore class spoke from an appointrnent, from whom the following four were chosen: Leslie Nathan Broughton of Delhi, who took for his subject, \Joan of Arc,'' the story of whose life, he treated in an effective manner; Lester J. Hub- bard of Cohoes, who spoke on \ The Spirit of Progress,\ in discovery, invention and the up- lifting of hun1anity; William Dewey Loucks of Albany, who delivered an able eulogy on \ Abraham Lincoln\ ; Emil Lewis Winterberg of Tioga, Pa., whose oration on the ''Restriction of Immigration,\ treated of the social, political and tnoral dangers arising frotn too lax hnmigra- tion laws.

D., '66, wiH preach at Yale Sl!lnday, June 12. By the .appoin.t>tnent of Charles E.mory Smith to be Postmaster-General, we are reminded of that long line of men who have issued frotn the hallways of our sister college, Union, to dis- tinguish themselves in the professions and in high places of trust in the government. Union has an alumni ron of which tnany a large college might be proud. It is an inspiration to her undergraduates and a testimony to the thoroughness and man-making qualities of both her instructors and her curriculum.-Hamilton Review. Winona, Ind., May 19.-The Rev. Sheldon . Jackson, '55, preached the sermon opening the Presbyterian General assembly here today. He took for his text, H Begin to possess, that thou n1ayest inherit the land,\ Deuteronomy 2 ; 3 r, and dwelt upon ''The American Presbyterian Church, Its Position, Opportunity and Respon- sibility.\ He said, among other things: ''The nations of Europe and Asia ; the nations of antiquity (except Israel), were born in war and conquest, in blood and atnhition ; but these United States were founded by those who sought first and foremost a land where they could worship God untrammeled by kings and governments ; they came not for conquest, but for civil and religious liberty. \God shifted out of the three Kingdoms of Great Britain, Holland and France, the choicest

The features of Wednesday's game were a three-bagger by Cunninghatn, Thatcher's cus- tomary good work in the box, and a phenomenal catch by Carver. All the team, however, played well, and Thatcher was finely supported, only one error being put doV\rn against the field. The news of the victory was telegraphed to thi:s city and spread rapidly among the students on the hill., but whether a lack of spirit or the weather was responsible, the crowd that ought to have been at the station at 9 :48 to give the ''It is also worthy of note that of these four prominent factors ~in our early American hi:story, three-the Hollanders, Huguenots, .and Scotch and Scotch-Irish were Presbyterians; and the fourth the PHgrim Fathers, held in common with Presbyterians the Calvinistic creed, and many of their churches had the Presbyterian system of ruling elders, of whom Elder Brew- ster is a well known example. \As in colonial and revolutionary tim:es, so ever since, the Presbyterian has been among the frank foremost leaders in refor,ms and good ; victors a rousing welcom~e, was not there ; and the yell that was given by the three men who thought enough of the tearn to meet them was · not a very inspiring one, to say the least. government. \The Presbyterian church is a leading church in liberality.

The age demands consecrated men and women, consecrated time, consecrated energies, and consecrated wealth. Shall it have them ?

Union took another stride Wednesday in the race for the baseball championship of the New York State Intercollegiate Athletic Union when Captain Smith led his followers on to victory over Hamilton. The wearers of the Garnet went out to Clinton expecting the hardest kind of a struggle, for Hatnilton, at the conclusion of their game on the campus, declared they would \even up\ on the 25th.

Burrows, Printer, 412 State Street, Schenectady, N.Y. BY the time this number of the Concordiensis reaehes its readers, out athletes will be engaged in winning points at Utiea. Whether they will win sufficient points to win the meet, we cannot say. But all indications point to a hot contest with the chances in our favor. A great many students will attend the meet and by their presence and en- thusiasm the team will be urged on to victol\y. WE HAVE beautiful grounds, some good build- ings, a. go()d library, a fine faculty, a -winning base ball team, an unexcelled musical association and a team that ought to win the Utica. meet. But all these good things serve to make more conspicuous one notable deficiency. 'Ve refer to wall maps, of which we have less than the average prepara- tory school. A map of the United Sta.tes, two of England and one of France constitute the sum total of maps on the walls of our recitation rooms. The map of France is used as a map of Germany and of Italy by pointing out about where various · oar men found tbe ball in the eighth and held Hobart under a spell for the rest of the game, the side-lines went frantic. The charrn onee on, could not be broken. Not within our memory has the world seemed turned .so upside down. It was a great victory, for Hobart had been playing a fine game and came here with a good record. But -who can gainsay that Union also has been making a record this season? Captain 8rnith may j astly feel proud of his men. The good wishes and bearty support of all are with them. IT was with very mixed feelings that, last Mon- day morning, the senior class forruaUy turned over to '99 the management of undergraduate affairs. We remembered how we had first seen that eere- mony performed three years ago, and with the 1·emem brance there came a feeling of regret that ROW we had moved up together for the last tiine. Hereafter we n1ust depend on our own individual selves. We willl1ave no motive for advancement e:xeept such as co rues frorn our own an1 bition and struggle. We feel a ce1·tain satisfaction that we have nearly accornpanished our four years task, and an equal certainty that our future tasks will not be so pleasant as those that are now performed. We feel that we have not done all we wished nor as much as, perhaps, we ought. But we have tried to do something and to do it as well as we eould. If we have failed, we a1•e. sorry; if we have partially succeeded, we are grateful to those who have aided us and who have made our college course so full of pleasurable things. We are satis- fied that the class of '99 will do its part in keeping undergraduate life up to the sta,ndard that Union has maintained, and we wish them all success in their management of student interest.

A little : the order had been cancelled when the manage- note at the end of the Literary Notes in the ; ment found out the false pretense upon which the ·' .Tune number, informs us that Mr. Laurence ,. order had been secured. It was unfortunate that Hutton is about to cease writing the literary the game had been .arranged for, when the tea1n ·criticism of that magazine. It is said that nowa- days people read criticisms instead of books, and most critics have adapted themselves to the wants of that sort .of people. }fr. Hutton is one of the few who does not do that.

It is no exaggeration to say that since Lowell's death, Mr. Hutton has been the best critic in America. His ''Literary Landmarks., of Florence, Venice and Edinburgh, are gems. Such critics are extremely rare, and we can only hope that Mr. fiutton's 1·esignation will not be followed by any rliminntion in the quantity of his writings that we all enjoy so much. REALIZING that the man who complains is a nuisance, we bave tried to avoid finding fault with anybody. Eut with the utmost cheerfulness we propose to complain of the outrage perpetrated upon our baseball team at North Adams. The manage1· of a team at that place arranged for a game with our management, promising a guarantee of $55, with the understanding that the team should stay at the ·hotel. On reaching North Adams the hotel proved to be a low grogshop, with no accommodations and a resort not of gentle- men but of canaille. The t€ain very properly went to another hotel, and, the Cuban Giants having cancelled their game, proposed to return home that night. We pass by the unfair treatment which the team received on the diamond, for that is the fo1·tune of war. But at the close of the game, the North Adams manager presented a bill for meals and room which swallowed up the his :men were needlessly subj:ected to outrage. It is to be hoped that greater care will hereafter be e:x:ercised in the .arrangement of ga1.ues with un- known teams . An inter-seholastic athletic 1neet was held at Cornell last Saturday. WilHams l11as defeated Amherst in an athletic rneet by the score of 66 to 6o. Columbia was defeated by Cornell May 14 in a track meet by the score of 72 to 54· Cornell defeated Syracuse this year in track athleti:cs by the score of 62~ to 49~. The foundation has just been laid of a Phi Delta 'Theta chapter house at Syracuse. The Universities of Michigan and Pennsyl- vania are trying to arrange for a joint debate. The New York Alpha of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity has just been established at Cornell. . The attetnpt to amalgamate Harvard and the Massachusetts institute of Technology has been abandoned. Professor Tames Seth, who fills the chair of Morai Philosophy at Cornell, has been elected to the same position in the University of Edin- . burgh. Cornell, Columbia and Pennsylvania will row in the Inter-collegiate regatta this year. Sara- toga lake has been decided upon as the place and tb.e date is fixed for July I.
